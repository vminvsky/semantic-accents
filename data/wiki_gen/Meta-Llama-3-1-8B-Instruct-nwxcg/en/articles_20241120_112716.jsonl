2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic [27] Discussing this decision for Variety, Adam B Vary and Matt Donnelly questioned whether the MCU could be impacted more by this delay than other big properties due to the interconnected nature of the franchise, though a Marvel Studios source told the pair that changing Black Widow's release date would not affect the rest of the MCU timeline [28] In April, Disney changed its entire Phase Four release slate, scheduling Black Widow when Eternals had been set for release in November 2020 and moving all its other Phase Four films back in the schedule to accommodate this [29] Later that month, Sony delayed Spider-Man: No Way Home to November 2021, resulting in Disney adjusting the release of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and Thor: Love and Thunder [30] In July 2020, Disney confirmed that The Falcon and the Winter Soldier would not release in August 2020 as planned, because the series had not completed filming due to the COVID-19 pandemic, [31] while Sony pushed back the release of Spider-Man: No Way Home to December 2021 [32] In early September, WandaVision was set to be the first television series released for the phase as The Falcon and the Winter Soldier's release was pushed back to 2021 due to its production delays [33] [34] Later that month, Black Widow's release was delayed to May 2021, resulting in Eternals and Shang-Chi and the Legends of the Ten Rings also being rescheduled; [35] this made 2020 the first year since 2009 without a Marvel Studios release [36] When adjusting the release of the films and series in the phase, Marvel Studios was being cognizant to ensure major story points would not be spoiled with the new release order, [14] but Feige noted many of the properties in the Phase were mostly standalone or a continuation from Endgame [37] He also credited the studio's \"long lead plan\" for being able to avoid any creative shifts to their Phase Four plans because of the pandemic, only shuffling release dates and production schedules [38] Additionally, he stated that many of the series had their release dates shifted only \"by a matter of weeks\" from their original dates [39] The only significant aspect of the phase that was affected by the pandemic was Julia Louis-Dreyfus's introduction as Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, which came in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier rather than Black Widow as was originally planned, since Black Widow ended up being released after the series [40] [41]\n\n\nFilms\nNatasha Romanoff finds herself alone and forced to confront a

oversaturating their content, saying that having essentially \"a new Marvel thing each week  [in 2021] is either a blessing or a curse\" depending on how viewers felt about the MCU While Alexander felt franchise fatigue was possible, she said Marvel Studios and Disney's biggest concern was losing trust from the fanbase, pointing to the Star Wars sequel trilogy (2015–2019) as an example of a large portion of fans not being pleased with the quality of the content Alexander was encouraged by the fact that Feige was leading development of the Disney+ series, unlike the past Marvel television series that were led by Marvel Television's Jeph Loeb, and she felt the studio \"just needs to keep doing what it's already doing\" and give the \"same level of attention\" to extending the overarching story from the past films to the Disney+ series [435] With The Falcon and the Winter Soldier being described as a \"six-hour movie\", Christian Holub of Entertainment Weekly noted that this led to the series simultaneously \"try [ing] to do too much and too little at once\" and hoped future Disney+ series would be structured more like television episodes as WandaVision was, even if they did not employ the meta quality that series did with the format [436]\n\n\nBox office performance\nAhead of WandaVision premiering to start the phase, Julia Alexander at The Verge wondered if

Disney Studios had scheduled multiple release dates for untitled Marvel Studios films for 2020 and 2021 Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige said some of the films for those dates were already known, explaining, \"We know what  [films] we'd like them to be for 2020 Over the years, where we're aiming we've been lucky enough that it's usually been the same thing but we always leave ourselves the opportunity to bob and weave and adapt if we have to.\" [1] Feige was not sure if Marvel would continue to group the films of the MCU into phases once Phase Three concluded in 2019, saying that \"it might be a new thing\", [2] but by December 2018, Marvel was believed to be using the term Phase Four [3] Feige said Marvel hoped to reveal some upcoming films after the release of Avengers: Endgame (2019), [4] with the Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger later indicating that Marvel would reveal its slate of post-Avengers: Endgame films in mid-2019 [5]\n\n\nInitial work and announcement\nBy October

pandemic and further work\nBlack Widow was removed from Disney's release schedule in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic [27] Discussing this decision for Variety, Adam B Vary and Matt Donnelly questioned whether the MCU could be impacted more by this delay than other big properties due to the interconnected nature of the franchise, though a Marvel Studios source told the pair that changing Black Widow's release date would not affect the rest of the MCU timeline [28] In April, Disney changed its entire Phase Four release slate, scheduling Black Widow when Eternals had been set for release in November 2020 and moving all its other Phase Four films back in the schedule to accommodate this [29] Later that month, Sony delayed Spider-Man: No Way Home to November 2021, resulting in Disney adjusting the release of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and Thor: Love and Thunder [30] In July 2020, Disney confirmed that The Falcon and the Winter Soldier would not release in August 2020 as planned, because the series had not completed filming due to the COVID-19 pandemic, [31] while Sony pushed back the release of Spider-Man: No Way Home to December 2021 [32] In early September, WandaVision was set to be the first television series released for the phase as The Falcon and the Winter Soldier's release was pushed back to 2021 due to its production delays [33] [34] Later that month, Black Widow's release was delayed to May 2021, resulting in Eternals and Shang-Chi and the Legends of the Ten Rings also being rescheduled; [35] this made 2020 the first year since 2009 without a Marvel Studios release [36] When adjusting the release of the films and series in the phase, Marvel Studios was being cognizant to ensure major story points would not be spoiled with the new release order, [14] but Feige noted many of the properties in the Phase were mostly standalone or a continuation from Endgame [37] He also credited the studio's \"long lead plan\" for being able to avoid any creative shifts to their Phase Four plans because of the pandemic, only shuffling release dates and production schedules [38] Additionally, he stated that many of the series had their release dates shifted only \"by a matter of weeks\" from their original dates [39] The only significant aspect of the phase that was affected by the pandemic was Julia Louis-Dreyfus's introduction as Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, which came in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier rather than Black Widow as was originally planned, since Black Widow ended up being released after the series [40] [41]\n\n\nFilms\nNatasha Romanoff finds herself alone and forced to confront a dangerous conspiracy with ties to her past Pursued by a force that will stop at nothing to bring her down,

The incident occurred when the ATR 72-500 aircraft, operated by Voepass, a Brazilian airline, went down in the vicinity of Cascavel, Paraná, while en route to Guarulhos, São Paulo. The accident resulted in the loss of life and significant damage to the aircraft.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe aircraft involved, registered as PS-VPB, was a 14-year-old twin-engine turboprop ATR 72-500 with serial number 908, powered by two Pratt & Whitney Canada PW127M engines. It was acquired by Voepass in September 2022 from Indonesian carrier Pelita Air Service.\n\n**Aircraft**\n\nThe ATR 72-500 is a twin-engine turboprop aircraft designed for short- to medium-haul flights. The aircraft has a maximum takeoff weight of approximately 23,000 kg and a range of up to 1,000 km. The PS-VPB was one of the older models of the ATR 72-500, having been in operation since 2009.\n\n**Crew and Passengers**\n\nIn command was Captain Danilo Santos Romano, aged 35, and his co-pilot was First Officer Humberto de Campos Alencar e Silva, aged 61. The flight attendants were Débora Soper Ávila, aged 28, and Rubia Silva de Lima, aged 41. All passengers and crew were Brazilian. Three of the passengers had dual citizenship with Venezuela, and one with Portugal. Twenty-seven of the passengers were residents of Cascavel.\n\n**Accident**\n\nThe aircraft was traveling from Cascavel, Paraná, to the city of Guarulhos, São Paulo. In the area of the accident, there was an active SIGMET advisory for severe icing from 12,000 to 21,000 feet (3,700 to 6,400 meters). Meteorological reports at the time of the accident indicated that areas of turbulence, thunderstorms, and icing were present in areas surrounding the accident. The Brazilian Air Force said that the flight did not declare an emergency.\n\nThe investigation into the accident is ongoing, and it is too early to determine the exact cause of the crash. However, preliminary reports suggest that the aircraft encountered severe icing conditions, which may have contributed to the loss of control.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nPresident Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was attending the launch of the frigate Tamandaré when he received news of the accident, and requested a moment of silence for those on board. The incident has sent shockwaves throughout Brazil, with many expressing their condolences to the families of the victims.\n\n**Investigation**\n\nThe Brazilian Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center (CENIPA) has launched an investigation into the accident. Investigators from the French Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA) and Canadian Transportation Safety Board (TSB) also joined the investigation, representing the country where the aircraft and engines, the ATR 72 and the Pratt & Whitney Canada PW127M, were manufactured, respectively. CENIPA head Marcelo Moreno said on the day of the accident that both flight recorders—the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and the flight data recorder (FDR)—had been recovered and were in CENIPA's possession.\n\n**Preliminary Report**\n\nOn September 6, CENIPA released the preliminary report containing the data collected on the accident. Before the press conference, the victims' families were informed about the findings by the authorities. The report highlights the severe icing conditions and the potential loss of control of the aircraft.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Voepass Flight 2283 accident is a tragic incident that highlights the importance of aviation safety. The investigation into the accident is ongoing, and it is too early to determine the exact cause of the crash. However, preliminary reports suggest that the aircraft encountered severe icing conditions, which may have contributed to the loss of control. The incident serves as a reminder of the risks involved in aviation and the need for continued vigilance in ensuring the safety of passengers and crew.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* List of aviation accidents and incidents in Brazil\n* ATR 72\n* Pratt & Whitney Canada PW127M\n* Brazilian Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center (CENIPA)\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Brazilian Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center (CENIPA)\n* French Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA)\n* Canadian Transportation Safety Board (TSB)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Voepass_Flight_2283\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nThe aircraft involved, registered as PS-VPB, was a 14-year-old twin-engine turboprop ATR 72-500 with serial number 908, powered by two Pratt & Whitney Canada PW127M engines [1] [2] [3] [4] It was acquired by Voepass in September 2022 from Indonesian carrier Pelita Air Service [5]\n\n\nAircraft\nThe aircraft involved, registered as PS-VPB, was a 14-year-old twin-engine turboprop ATR 72-500 with serial number 908, powered by two Pratt & Whitney Canada PW127M engines [1] [2] [3] [4] It was acquired by Voepass in September 2022 from Indonesian carrier Pelita Air Service [5]\n\n\nCrew and passengers\nIn command was Captain Danilo Santos Romano, aged 35, and his co-pilot was First Officer Humberto de Campos Alencar e Silva, aged 61 [6] The flight attendants were Débora Soper Ávila, aged 28, [7] and Rubia Silva de Lima, aged 41 [6] All passengers and crew were Brazilian Three of the passengers had dual citizenship with Venezuela, and one with Portugal [8] [9] [10] Twenty-seven of the passengers were residents of Cascavel [11]\n\n\nAccident\nThe aircraft was traveling from Cascavel, Paraná, to the city of Guarulhos, São Paulo [15] In the area of the accident, there was an active SIGMET advisory for severe icing from 12,000 to 21,000 feet (3,700 to 6,400 m) [1] [2] [16] Meteorological reports at the time of the accident indicated that areas of turbulence, thunderstorms, and icing were present in areas surrounding the accident [17] The Brazilian Air Force said that the flight did not declare an emergency [18]\n\n\nAftermath\nPresident Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was attending the launch of the frigate Tamandaré when he received news of the accident, and requested a moment of silence for those on board.\n\n\nInvestigation\nThe Brazilian Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center (CENIPA) has launched an investigation into the accident Investigators from the French Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA) and Canadian Transportation Safety Board (TSB) also joined the investigation, representing the country where the aircraft and engines, the ATR 72 and the Pratt & Whitney Canada PW127M, were manufactured respectively [1] CENIPA head Marcelo Moreno said on the day of the accident that both flight recorders—the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and the flight data recorder (FDR)—had been recovered and were in CENIPA's possession [38] [39] The bodies of the victims were taken to the central Instituto Médico Legal facility in São Paulo for processing [24] By 11 August, local emergency services reported that all bodies had been removed from the accident site and the wreckage had been handed over to CENIPA for further investigation On the same day, CENIPA announced that the data from the FDR had been downloaded and was being analyzed [1]\n\n\nPreliminary report\nOn September 6, CENIPA released the preliminary report containing the data collected on the accident [46] [47] [48] Before the press conference, the victims' families were informed about the findings by the authorities [47]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Rwanda", "content": "\nHistory\nModern human settlement of what is now Rwanda dates from, at the latest, the last glacial period, either in the Neolithic period around 8000 BC, or in the long humid period which followed, up to around 3000 BC [15] Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of sparse settlement by hunter-gatherers in the late Stone Age, followed by a larger population of early Iron Age settlers, who produced dimpled pottery and iron tools [16] [17] These early inhabitants were the ancestors of the Twa, aboriginal pygmy hunter-gatherers who remain in Rwanda today Then by 3,000BC, Central Sudanic and Kuliak farmers and herders began settling into Rwanda, followed by South Cushitic speaking herders in 2,000BC [18] [19] [20] The forest-dwelling Twa lost much of their habitat and moved to the mountain slopes [21] Between 800 BC and 1500 AD, a number of Bantu groups migrated into Rwanda, clearing forest land for agriculture [20] [22] Historians have several theories regarding the nature of the Bantu migrations; one theory is that the first settlers were Hutu, while the Tutsi migrated later to form a distinct racial group, possibly of Nilo-hamitic origin [23] An alternative theory is that the migration was slow and steady, with incoming groups integrating into rather than conquering the existing society [20] [24] Under this theory, the Hutu and Tutsi distinction arose later and was a class distinction rather than a racial one [25] [26]\n\n\nRwandan genocide\nThe cease-fire ended on 6 April 1994 when Habyarimana's plane was shot down near Kigali Airport, killing him [59] The shooting down of the plane served as the catalyst for the Rwandan genocide, which began within a few hours Over the course of approximately 100 days, between 500,000 and 1,000,000 [60] Tutsi and politically moderate Hutu were killed in well-planned attacks on the orders of the interim government [61] Many Twa were also killed, despite not being directly targeted [54]\n\n\nPolitics and government\nRwanda is a de facto one-party state [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] ruled by the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and its leader Paul Kagame continuously since the end of the civil war in 1994 [73] [74] Although Rwanda is nominally democratic, elections are manipulated in various ways, which include banning opposition parties, arresting or assassinating critics, and electoral fraud [75] The RPF is a Tutsi-dominated party but receives support from other communities as well [76]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nBefore western colonization, the Rwandan government system had a quasi-system of political pluralism and power sharing [121] Despite there being a strict hierarchy, the pre-colonial system achieved an established, combined system of \"centralized power and decentralized autonomous units.\" Under the monarch, the elected Chief governed a province that was divided into multiple districts Two other officials appointed by head Chief governed the districts; one official was allocated power over the land while the other oversaw cattle The king (mwami) exercised control through a system of provinces, districts, hills, and neighbourhoods [122]\nAs of 2003, the constitution divided Rwanda into provinces (intara), districts (uturere), cities, municipalities, towns, sectors (imirenge), cells (utugari), and villages (imidugudu); the larger divisions, and their borders, are established by Parliament [123] In January 2006, Rwanda was reorganized such that twelve provinces were merged to create five, and 106 districts were merged into thirty [124] The present borders drawn in 2006 aimed at decentralising power and removing associations with the old system and the genocide The previous structure of twelve provinces associated with the largest cities was replaced with five provinces based primarily on geography [125] These are Northern Province, Southern Province, Eastern Province, Western Province, and the Municipality of Kigali in the centre.\n\n\nGeography\nAt 26,338 square kilometres (10,169 sq mi), Rwanda is the world's 149th-largest country, [130] and the fourth smallest on the African mainland after Gambia, Eswatini, and Djibouti [130] It is comparable in size to Burundi, Haiti and Albania [72] [131] The entire country is at a high altitude: the lowest point is the Rusizi River at 950 metres (3,117 ft) above sea level [72] Rwanda is located in Central/Eastern Africa, and is bordered by the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west, Uganda to the north, Tanzania to the east, and Burundi to the south [72] It lies a few degrees south of the equator and is landlocked [132] The capital, Kigali, is located near the centre of Rwanda [133]\n\n\nClimate\nRwanda has a temperate tropical highland climate, with lower temperatures than are typical for equatorial countries because of its high elevation [132] Kigali, in the centre of the country, has a typical daily temperature range between 15 and 28 °C (59 and 82 °F), with little variation through the year [144] There are some temperature variations across the country; the mountainous west and north are generally cooler than the lower-lying east [145] There are two rainy seasons in the year; the first runs from February to June and the second from September to December These are separated by two dry seasons: the major one from June to September, during which there is often no rain at all, and a shorter and less severe one from December to February [146] Rainfall varies geographically, with the west and northwest of the country receiving more precipitation annually than the east and southeast [147] Global warming has caused a change in the pattern of the rainy seasons According to a report by the Strategic Foresight Group, change in climate has reduced the number of rainy days experienced during a year, but has also caused an increase in frequency of torrential rains [148] Both changes have caused difficulty for farmers, decreasing their productivity [149] Strategic Foresight also characterise Rwanda as a fast warming country, with an increase in average temperature of between 0.7 °C to 0.9 °C over fifty years [148]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nIn prehistoric times, montane forest occupied one-third of the territory of present-day Rwanda Naturally occurring vegetation is now mostly restricted to the three national parks, with terraced agriculture dominating the rest of the country [150] Nyungwe, the largest remaining tract of forest, contains 200 species of tree as well as orchids and begonias [151] Vegetation in the Volcanoes National Park is mostly bamboo and moorland, with small areas of forest [150] By contrast, Akagera has a savanna ecosystem in which acacia dominates the flora There are several rare or endangered plant species in Akagera, including Markhamia lutea and Eulophia guineensis [152] [153]\n\n\nEconomy\nRwanda's economy suffered heavily during the 1994 genocide, with widespread loss of life, failure to maintain infrastructure, looting, and neglect of important cash crops This caused a large drop in GDP and destroyed the country's ability to attract private and external investment [72] The economy has since strengthened, with per-capita nominal GDP estimated at $909.9 in 2022, [170] compared with $127 in 1994 [171] As of the most recent survey in 2019/20, 48.8% of the population continues to be affected by multidimensional poverty and an additional 22.7% vulnerable to it [172] Major export markets include China, Germany, and the United States [72] The economy is managed by the central National Bank of Rwanda and the currency is the Rwandan franc; in December 2023, the exchange rate was 1250 francs to one United States dollar [173] Rwanda joined the East African Community in 2007, and has ratified a plan for monetary union amongst the seven member nations, [174] which could eventually lead to a common East African shilling [175]\n\n\nMedia and communications\nThe largest radio and television stations are state-run, and the majority of newspapers are owned by the government [194] Most Rwandans have access to radio; during the 1994 genocide, the radio station Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines broadcast across the country, and helped to fuel the killings through anti-Tutsi propaganda [194] As of 2015 [update], the state-run Radio Rwanda was the largest station and the main source of news throughout the country [194] Television access is limited, with most homes not having their own set [195] The government rolled out digital television in 2014, and a year later there were seven national stations operating, up from just one in the pre-2014 analogue era [196] The press is tightly restricted, and newspapers routinely self-censor to avoid government reprisals [194] Nonetheless, publications in Kinyarwanda, English, and French critical of the government are widely available in Kigali Restrictions were increased in the run-up to the Rwandan presidential election of 2010, with two independent newspapers, Umuseso and Umuvugizi, being suspended for six months by the High Media Council [197]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nThe Rwandan government prioritised funding of water supply development during the 2000s, significantly increasing its share of the national budget [210] This funding, along with donor support, caused a rapid increase in access to safe water; in 2015, 74% of the population had access to safe water, [211] up from about 55% in 2005; [210] the government has committed to increasing this to 100% by 2017 [211] The country's water infrastructure consists of urban and rural systems that deliver water to the public, mainly through standpipes in rural areas and private connections in urban areas In areas not served by these systems, hand pumps and managed springs are used [212] Despite rainfall exceeding 750 millimetres (30 in) annually in most of the country, [213] little use is made of rainwater harvesting, and residents are forced to use water very sparingly, relative to usage in other African countries [211] Access to sanitation remains low; the United Nations estimates that in 2006, 34% of urban and 20% of rural dwellers had access to improved sanitation, [214] with this statistic increasing to 92% for the total population (95% urban and 91% urban) in 2022 [215] Kigali is one of the cleanest cities in Africa [216] Government policy measures to improve sanitation are limited, focusing only on urban areas [214] The majority of the population, both urban and rural, use public shared pit latrines [214]\n\n\nDemographics\nAs of 2015 [update], the National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda estimated Rwanda's population to be 11,262,564, [233] while the projection for 2022 was 13,246,394 [234] The 2012 census recorded a population of 10,515,973 [235] The population is young: in the 2012 census, 43.3% of the population were aged 15 and under, and 53.4% were between 16 and 64 [236] According to the CIA World Factbook, the annual birth rate is estimated at 40.2 births per 1,000 inhabitants in 2015, and the death rate at 14.9 [72] The life expectancy is 67.67 years (69.27 years for females and 67.11 years for males), which is the 26th lowest out of 224 countries and territories [72] [237] The overall sex ratio of the country is 95.9 males per 100 females [72]\n\n\nEducation\nPrior to 2012, the Rwandan government provided free education in state-run schools for nine years: six years in primary and three years following a common secondary programme [256] In 2012, this started to be expanded to 12 years [257] A 2015 study suggests that while enrollment rates in primary schools are \"near ubiquity\", rates of completion are low and repetition rates high [258] While schooling is fee-free, there is an expectation that parents should contribute to the cost of their children's education by providing them with school supplies, supporting teacher development and making a contribution to school construction According to the government, these costs should not be a basis for the exclusion of children from education, however [257] There are many private schools across the country, some church-run, which follow the same syllabus but charge fees [259] From 1994 until 2009, secondary education was offered in either French or English; because of the country's increasing ties with the East African Community and the Commonwealth, only the English syllabi are now offered [260] The country has a number of institutions of tertiary education In 2013, the public University of Rwanda (UR) was created out of a merger of the former National University of Rwanda and the country's other public higher education institutions [261] [262] [263] In 2013, the gross enrollment ratio for tertiary education in Rwanda was 7.9%, from 3.6% in 2006 [264] The country's literacy rate, defined as those aged 15 or over who can read and write, was 78.8% in 2022, up from 71% in 2009, 58% in 1991, and 38% in 1978 [265] [266]\n\n\nHealth\nThe quality of healthcare in Rwanda has historically been very low, both before and immediately after the 1994 genocide [267] In 1998, more than one in five children died before their fifth birthday, [268] often from malaria [269]\n\n\nReligion\nThe largest faith in Rwanda is Catholicism, but there have been significant changes in the nation's religious demographics since the genocide, with many conversions to evangelical Christianity, and, to a lesser degree, Islam [289] According to the 2012 census, Catholic Christians represented 43.7% of the population, Protestants (excluding Seventh-day Adventists) 37.7%, Seventh-day Adventists 11.8%, and Muslims 2.0%; 0.2% claimed no religious beliefs and 1.3% did not state a religion [290] Traditional religion, despite officially being followed by only 0.1% of the population, retains an influence Many Rwandans view the Christian God as synonymous with the traditional Rwandan God Imana [291]\n\n\nLanguages\nThe country's principal and national language is Kinyarwanda, which is virtually spoken by the entire country (98%) [292] The major European languages during the colonial era were German, though it was never taught or widely used, and then French, which was introduced by Belgium from 1916 and remained an official and widely spoken language after independence in 1962 [293] Dutch was spoken as well The return of English-speaking Rwandan refugees in the 1990s [293] added a new dimension to the country's language policy, [294] and the repositioning of Rwanda as a member of the East African Community has since increased the importance of English; the medium of education was switched from French to English in 2008 [292] Kinyarwanda, English, French, and Swahili are all official languages [295] Kinyarwanda is the national language while English is the primary medium of instruction in secondary and tertiary education Swahili, the lingua franca of the East African Community, [296] is also spoken by some as a second language, particularly returned refugees from Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and those who live along the border with the DRC [297] In 2015, Swahili was introduced as a mandatory subject in secondary schools [296] Inhabitants of Rwanda's Nkombo Island speak Mashi, a language closely related to Kinyarwanda [298]\n\n\nHuman rights\nHomosexuality is generally considered a taboo topic, and there is no significant public discussion of this issue in any region of the country Some lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) Rwandans have reported being harassed and blackmailed [301] [302] [303] Same-sex sexual activity is not specifically illegal in Rwanda Some cabinet-level government officials have expressed support for the rights of LGBT people; [304] however, no special legislative protections are afforded to LGBT people, [302] who may be arrested by the police under various laws dealing with public order and morality [303] Same-sex marriages are not recognized by the state, as the constitution provides that \" [o]nly civil monogamous marriage between a man and a woman is recognized\" [305]\n\n\nCulture\nMusic and dance are an integral part of Rwandan ceremonies, festivals, social gatherings and storytelling The most famous traditional dance is a highly choreographed routine consisting of three components: the umushagiriro, or cow dance, performed by women; [307] the intore, or dance of heroes, performed by men; [307] and the drumming, also traditionally performed by men, on drums known as ingoma [308] The best-known dance group is the National Ballet It was established by President Habyarimana in 1974, and performs nationally and internationally [309] Traditionally, music is transmitted orally, with styles varying between the social groups Drums are of great importance; the royal drummers enjoyed high status within the court of the King (Mwami) [310] Drummers play together in groups of varying sizes, usually between seven and nine in number [311] The country has a growing popular music industry, influenced by African Great Lakes, Congolese, and American music The most popular genre is hip hop, with a blend of dancehall, rap, ragga, R&B and dance-pop [312]\n\n\nCuisine\nThe cuisine of Rwanda is based on local staple foods produced by subsistence agriculture such as bananas, plantains (known as ibitoke), pulses, sweet potatoes, beans, and cassava (manioc) [325] Many Rwandans do not eat meat more than a few times a month [325] For those who live near lakes and have access to fish, tilapia is popular [325] The potato, thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by German and Belgian colonialists, is very popular [326] Ugali, locally known as Ubugari (or umutsima) is common, a paste made from cassava or maize and water to form a porridge-like consistency that is eaten throughout the African Great Lakes [327] Isombe is made from mashed cassava leaves and can be served with dried fish, rice, ugali, potatoes etc [326] Lunch is usually a buffet known as mélange, consisting of the above staples and sometimes meat [328] Brochettes are the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from goat but sometimes tripe, beef, or fish [328]\n\n\nSport\nThe Rwandan government, through its Sports Development Policy, promotes sport as a strong avenue for \"development and peace building\", [338] and the government has made commitments to advancing the use of sport for a variety of development objectives, including education [339] The most popular sports in Rwanda are association football, volleyball, basketball, athletics and Paralympic sports [340] Cricket has been growing in popularity, [341] as a result of refugees returned from Kenya, where they had learned to play the game [342] Cycling, traditionally seen largely as a mode of transport in Rwanda, is also growing in popularity as a sport; [343] and Team Rwanda have been the subject of a book, Land of Second Chances: The Impossible Rise of Rwanda's Cycling Team and a film, Rising from Ashes [344] [345]\n\n\nSee also\nGovernment:\n\n\nNotes\nGovernment:\n\n\nCitations\nGovernment:\n\n\nGeneral and cited references\nGovernment:\n\n\nExternal links\nGovernment:\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Rwanda**\n\nRwanda is a landlocked country located in the eastern part of the African Great Lakes region. It is bordered by the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west, Uganda to the north, Tanzania to the east, and Burundi to the south. With a total area of 26,338 square kilometers, Rwanda is the world's 149th-largest country.\n\n**History**\n\nThe history of Rwanda dates back to the last glacial period, with evidence of human settlement dating to around 8000 BC. The early inhabitants of the region were hunter-gatherers, who were later replaced by farmers and herders. The Twa, an aboriginal pygmy hunter-gatherer group, remain in Rwanda today. By 3000 BC, Central Sudanic and Kuliak farmers and herders had settled in Rwanda, followed by South Cushitic speaking herders in 2000 BC. The Twa lost much of their habitat and moved to the mountain slopes.\n\nBetween 800 BC and 1500 AD, a number of Bantu groups migrated into Rwanda, clearing forest land for agriculture. Historians have several th", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Rwanda\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nModern human settlement of what is now Rwanda dates from, at the latest, the last glacial period, either in the Neolithic period around 8000 BC, or in the long humid period which followed, up to around 3000 BC [15] Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of sparse settlement by hunter-gatherers in the late Stone Age, followed by a larger population of early Iron Age settlers, who produced dimpled pottery and iron tools [16] [17] These early inhabitants were the ancestors of the Twa, aboriginal pygmy hunter-gatherers who remain in Rwanda today Then by 3,000BC, Central Sudanic and Kuliak farmers and herders began settling into Rwanda, followed by South Cushitic speaking herders in 2,000BC [18] [19] [20] The forest-dwelling Twa lost much of their habitat and moved to the mountain slopes [21] Between 800 BC and 1500 AD, a number of Bantu groups migrated into Rwanda, clearing forest land for agriculture [20] [22] Historians have several theories regarding the nature of the Bantu migrations; one theory is that the first settlers were Hutu, while the Tutsi migrated later to form a distinct racial group, possibly of Nilo-hamitic origin [23] An alternative theory is that the migration was slow and steady, with incoming groups integrating into rather than conquering the existing society [20] [24] Under this theory, the Hutu and Tutsi distinction arose later and was a class distinction rather than a racial one [25] [26]\n\n\nRwandan genocide\nThe cease-fire ended on 6 April 1994 when Habyarimana's plane was shot down near Kigali Airport, killing him [59] The shooting down of the plane served as the catalyst for the Rwandan genocide, which began within a few hours Over the course of approximately 100 days, between 500,000 and 1,000,000 [60] Tutsi and politically moderate Hutu were killed in well-planned attacks on the orders of the interim government [61] Many Twa were also killed, despite not being directly targeted [54]\n\n\nPolitics and government\nRwanda is a de facto one-party state [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] ruled by the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and its leader Paul Kagame continuously since the end of the civil war in 1994 [73] [74] Although Rwanda is nominally democratic, elections are manipulated in various ways, which include banning opposition parties, arresting or assassinating critics, and electoral fraud [75] The RPF is a Tutsi-dominated party but receives support from other communities as well [76]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nBefore western colonization, the Rwandan government system had a quasi-system of political pluralism and power sharing [121] Despite there being a strict hierarchy, the pre-colonial system achieved an established, combined system of \"centralized power and decentralized autonomous units.\" Under the monarch, the elected Chief governed a province that was divided into multiple districts Two other officials appointed by head Chief governed the districts; one official was allocated power over the land while the other oversaw cattle The king (mwami) exercised control through a system of provinces, districts, hills, and neighbourhoods [122]\nAs of 2003, the constitution divided Rwanda into provinces (intara), districts (uturere), cities, municipalities, towns, sectors (imirenge), cells (utugari), and villages (imidugudu); the larger divisions, and their borders, are established by Parliament [123] In January 2006, Rwanda was reorganized such that twelve provinces were merged to create five, and 106 districts were merged into thirty [124] The present borders drawn in 2006 aimed at decentralising power and removing associations with the old system and the genocide The previous structure of twelve provinces associated with the largest cities was replaced with five provinces based primarily on geography [125] These are Northern Province, Southern Province, Eastern Province, Western Province, and the Municipality of Kigali in the centre.\n\n\nGeography\nAt 26,338 square kilometres (10,169 sq mi), Rwanda is the world's 149th-largest country, [130] and the fourth smallest on the African mainland after Gambia, Eswatini, and Djibouti [130] It is comparable in size to Burundi, Haiti and Albania [72] [131] The entire country is at a high altitude: the lowest point is the Rusizi River at 950 metres (3,117 ft) above sea level [72] Rwanda is located in Central/Eastern Africa, and is bordered by the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west, Uganda to the north, Tanzania to the east, and Burundi to the south [72] It lies a few degrees south of the equator and is landlocked [132] The capital, Kigali, is located near the centre of Rwanda [133]\n\n\nClimate\nRwanda has a temperate tropical highland climate, with lower temperatures than are typical for equatorial countries because of its high elevation [132] Kigali, in the centre of the country, has a typical daily temperature range between 15 and 28 °C (59 and 82 °F), with little variation through the year [144] There are some temperature variations across the country; the mountainous west and north are generally cooler than the lower-lying east [145] There are two rainy seasons in the year; the first runs from February to June and the second from September to December These are separated by two dry seasons: the major one from June to September, during which there is often no rain at all, and a shorter and less severe one from December to February [146] Rainfall varies geographically, with the west and northwest of the country receiving more precipitation annually than the east and southeast [147] Global warming has caused a change in the pattern of the rainy seasons According to a report by the Strategic Foresight Group, change in climate has reduced the number of rainy days experienced during a year, but has also caused an increase in frequency of torrential rains [148] Both changes have caused difficulty for farmers, decreasing their productivity [149] Strategic Foresight also characterise Rwanda as a fast warming country, with an increase in average temperature of between 0.7 °C to 0.9 °C over fifty years [148]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nIn prehistoric times, montane forest occupied one-third of the territory of present-day Rwanda Naturally occurring vegetation is now mostly restricted to the three national parks, with terraced agriculture dominating the rest of the country [150] Nyungwe, the largest remaining tract of forest, contains 200 species of tree as well as orchids and begonias [151] Vegetation in the Volcanoes National Park is mostly bamboo and moorland, with small areas of forest [150] By contrast, Akagera has a savanna ecosystem in which acacia dominates the flora There are several rare or endangered plant species in Akagera, including Markhamia lutea and Eulophia guineensis [152] [153]\n\n\nEconomy\nRwanda's economy suffered heavily during the 1994 genocide, with widespread loss of life, failure to maintain infrastructure, looting, and neglect of important cash crops This caused a large drop in GDP and destroyed the country's ability to attract private and external investment [72] The economy has since strengthened, with per-capita nominal GDP estimated at $909.9 in 2022, [170] compared with $127 in 1994 [171] As of the most recent survey in 2019/20, 48.8% of the population continues to be affected by multidimensional poverty and an additional 22.7% vulnerable to it [172] Major export markets include China, Germany, and the United States [72] The economy is managed by the central National Bank of Rwanda and the currency is the Rwandan franc; in December 2023, the exchange rate was 1250 francs to one United States dollar [173] Rwanda joined the East African Community in 2007, and has ratified a plan for monetary union amongst the seven member nations, [174] which could eventually lead to a common East African shilling [175]\n\n\nMedia and communications\nThe largest radio and television stations are state-run, and the majority of newspapers are owned by the government [194] Most Rwandans have access to radio; during the 1994 genocide, the radio station Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines broadcast across the country, and helped to fuel the killings through anti-Tutsi propaganda [194] As of 2015 [update], the state-run Radio Rwanda was the largest station and the main source of news throughout the country [194] Television access is limited, with most homes not having their own set [195] The government rolled out digital television in 2014, and a year later there were seven national stations operating, up from just one in the pre-2014 analogue era [196] The press is tightly restricted, and newspapers routinely self-censor to avoid government reprisals [194] Nonetheless, publications in Kinyarwanda, English, and French critical of the government are widely available in Kigali Restrictions were increased in the run-up to the Rwandan presidential election of 2010, with two independent newspapers, Umuseso and Umuvugizi, being suspended for six months by the High Media Council [197]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nThe Rwandan government prioritised funding of water supply development during the 2000s, significantly increasing its share of the national budget [210] This funding, along with donor support, caused a rapid increase in access to safe water; in 2015, 74% of the population had access to safe water, [211] up from about 55% in 2005; [210] the government has committed to increasing this to 100% by 2017 [211] The country's water infrastructure consists of urban and rural systems that deliver water to the public, mainly through standpipes in rural areas and private connections in urban areas In areas not served by these systems, hand pumps and managed springs are used [212] Despite rainfall exceeding 750 millimetres (30 in) annually in most of the country, [213] little use is made of rainwater harvesting, and residents are forced to use water very sparingly, relative to usage in other African countries [211] Access to sanitation remains low; the United Nations estimates that in 2006, 34% of urban and 20% of rural dwellers had access to improved sanitation, [214] with this statistic increasing to 92% for the total population (95% urban and 91% urban) in 2022 [215] Kigali is one of the cleanest cities in Africa [216] Government policy measures to improve sanitation are limited, focusing only on urban areas [214] The majority of the population, both urban and rural, use public shared pit latrines [214]\n\n\nDemographics\nAs of 2015 [update], the National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda estimated Rwanda's population to be 11,262,564, [233] while the projection for 2022 was 13,246,394 [234] The 2012 census recorded a population of 10,515,973 [235] The population is young: in the 2012 census, 43.3% of the population were aged 15 and under, and 53.4% were between 16 and 64 [236] According to the CIA World Factbook, the annual birth rate is estimated at 40.2 births per 1,000 inhabitants in 2015, and the death rate at 14.9 [72] The life expectancy is 67.67 years (69.27 years for females and 67.11 years for males), which is the 26th lowest out of 224 countries and territories [72] [237] The overall sex ratio of the country is 95.9 males per 100 females [72]\n\n\nEducation\nPrior to 2012, the Rwandan government provided free education in state-run schools for nine years: six years in primary and three years following a common secondary programme [256] In 2012, this started to be expanded to 12 years [257] A 2015 study suggests that while enrollment rates in primary schools are \"near ubiquity\", rates of completion are low and repetition rates high [258] While schooling is fee-free, there is an expectation that parents should contribute to the cost of their children's education by providing them with school supplies, supporting teacher development and making a contribution to school construction According to the government, these costs should not be a basis for the exclusion of children from education, however [257] There are many private schools across the country, some church-run, which follow the same syllabus but charge fees [259] From 1994 until 2009, secondary education was offered in either French or English; because of the country's increasing ties with the East African Community and the Commonwealth, only the English syllabi are now offered [260] The country has a number of institutions of tertiary education In 2013, the public University of Rwanda (UR) was created out of a merger of the former National University of Rwanda and the country's other public higher education institutions [261] [262] [263] In 2013, the gross enrollment ratio for tertiary education in Rwanda was 7.9%, from 3.6% in 2006 [264] The country's literacy rate, defined as those aged 15 or over who can read and write, was 78.8% in 2022, up from 71% in 2009, 58% in 1991, and 38% in 1978 [265] [266]\n\n\nHealth\nThe quality of healthcare in Rwanda has historically been very low, both before and immediately after the 1994 genocide [267] In 1998, more than one in five children died before their fifth birthday, [268] often from malaria [269]\n\n\nReligion\nThe largest faith in Rwanda is Catholicism, but there have been significant changes in the nation's religious demographics since the genocide, with many conversions to evangelical Christianity, and, to a lesser degree, Islam [289] According to the 2012 census, Catholic Christians represented 43.7% of the population, Protestants (excluding Seventh-day Adventists) 37.7%, Seventh-day Adventists 11.8%, and Muslims 2.0%; 0.2% claimed no religious beliefs and 1.3% did not state a religion [290] Traditional religion, despite officially being followed by only 0.1% of the population, retains an influence Many Rwandans view the Christian God as synonymous with the traditional Rwandan God Imana [291]\n\n\nLanguages\nThe country's principal and national language is Kinyarwanda, which is virtually spoken by the entire country (98%) [292] The major European languages during the colonial era were German, though it was never taught or widely used, and then French, which was introduced by Belgium from 1916 and remained an official and widely spoken language after independence in 1962 [293] Dutch was spoken as well The return of English-speaking Rwandan refugees in the 1990s [293] added a new dimension to the country's language policy, [294] and the repositioning of Rwanda as a member of the East African Community has since increased the importance of English; the medium of education was switched from French to English in 2008 [292] Kinyarwanda, English, French, and Swahili are all official languages [295] Kinyarwanda is the national language while English is the primary medium of instruction in secondary and tertiary education Swahili, the lingua franca of the East African Community, [296] is also spoken by some as a second language, particularly returned refugees from Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and those who live along the border with the DRC [297] In 2015, Swahili was introduced as a mandatory subject in secondary schools [296] Inhabitants of Rwanda's Nkombo Island speak Mashi, a language closely related to Kinyarwanda [298]\n\n\nHuman rights\nHomosexuality is generally considered a taboo topic, and there is no significant public discussion of this issue in any region of the country Some lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) Rwandans have reported being harassed and blackmailed [301] [302] [303] Same-sex sexual activity is not specifically illegal in Rwanda Some cabinet-level government officials have expressed support for the rights of LGBT people; [304] however, no special legislative protections are afforded to LGBT people, [302] who may be arrested by the police under various laws dealing with public order and morality [303] Same-sex marriages are not recognized by the state, as the constitution provides that \" [o]nly civil monogamous marriage between a man and a woman is recognized\" [305]\n\n\nCulture\nMusic and dance are an integral part of Rwandan ceremonies, festivals, social gatherings and storytelling The most famous traditional dance is a highly choreographed routine consisting of three components: the umushagiriro, or cow dance, performed by women; [307] the intore, or dance of heroes, performed by men; [307] and the drumming, also traditionally performed by men, on drums known as ingoma [308] The best-known dance group is the National Ballet It was established by President Habyarimana in 1974, and performs nationally and internationally [309] Traditionally, music is transmitted orally, with styles varying between the social groups Drums are of great importance; the royal drummers enjoyed high status within the court of the King (Mwami) [310] Drummers play together in groups of varying sizes, usually between seven and nine in number [311] The country has a growing popular music industry, influenced by African Great Lakes, Congolese, and American music The most popular genre is hip hop, with a blend of dancehall, rap, ragga, R&B and dance-pop [312]\n\n\nCuisine\nThe cuisine of Rwanda is based on local staple foods produced by subsistence agriculture such as bananas, plantains (known as ibitoke), pulses, sweet potatoes, beans, and cassava (manioc) [325] Many Rwandans do not eat meat more than a few times a month [325] For those who live near lakes and have access to fish, tilapia is popular [325] The potato, thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by German and Belgian colonialists, is very popular [326] Ugali, locally known as Ubugari (or umutsima) is common, a paste made from cassava or maize and water to form a porridge-like consistency that is eaten throughout the African Great Lakes [327] Isombe is made from mashed cassava leaves and can be served with dried fish, rice, ugali, potatoes etc [326] Lunch is usually a buffet known as mélange, consisting of the above staples and sometimes meat [328] Brochettes are the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from goat but sometimes tripe, beef, or fish [328]\n\n\nSport\nThe Rwandan government, through its Sports Development Policy, promotes sport as a strong avenue for \"development and peace building\", [338] and the government has made commitments to advancing the use of sport for a variety of development objectives, including education [339] The most popular sports in Rwanda are association football, volleyball, basketball, athletics and Paralympic sports [340] Cricket has been growing in popularity, [341] as a result of refugees returned from Kenya, where they had learned to play the game [342] Cycling, traditionally seen largely as a mode of transport in Rwanda, is also growing in popularity as a sport; [343] and Team Rwanda have been the subject of a book, Land of Second Chances: The Impossible Rise of Rwanda's Cycling Team and a film, Rising from Ashes [344] [345]\n\n\nSee also\nGovernment:\n\n\nNotes\nGovernment:\n\n\nCitations\nGovernment:\n\n\nGeneral and cited references\nGovernment:\n\n\nExternal links\nGovernment:\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

civilisations in South Asia originated from areas encompassing present-day Pakistan [30] The earliest known inhabitants in the region were Soanian during the Lower Paleolithic, of whom artefacts have been found in the Soan Valley of Punjab [31] The Indus region, which covers most of the present-day Pakistan, was the site of several successive ancient cultures including the Neolithic (7000–4300 BCE) site of Mehrgarh, [32] [33] [34] and the 5,000-year history of urban life in South Asia to the various sites of the Indus Valley Civilisation, including Mohenjo-daro and Harappa [35] [36]\n\n\nVedic period\nFollowing the decline of the Indus valley civilization, Indo-Aryan tribes moved into the Punjab from Central Asia in several waves of migration in the Vedic period (1500–500 BCE), [38] bringing with them their distinctive religious traditions and practices which fused with local culture [39] The Indo-Aryans religious beliefs and practices from the Bactria–Margiana culture and the native Harappan Indus beliefs of the former Indus Valley civilization eventually gave rise to Vedic culture and tribes [39] Most notable among them was Gandhara civilization, which flourished at the crossroads of India, Central Asia, and the Middle East, connecting trade routes and absorbing cultural influences from diverse civilizations [40] The initial early Vedic culture was a tribal, pastoral society centered in the Indus Valley, of what is today Pakistan [41] During this period, the Vedas, the oldest scriptures of Hinduism, were composed [42] [i]\n\n\nClassical period\nThe western regions of Pakistan became part of Achaemenid Empire around 517 BCE [44] In 326 BCE, Alexander the Great conquered the region by defeating various local rulers, most notably, the King Porus, at Jhelum [45] It was followed by the Maurya Empire, founded by Chandragupta Maurya and extended by Ashoka the Great, until 185 BCE [46] [47] [48] The Indo-Greek Kingdom founded by Demetrius of Bactria (180–165 BCE) included Gandhara and Punjab and reached its greatest extent under Menander (165–150 BCE), prospering the Greco-Buddhist culture in the region [49] [50] [51] Taxila had one of the earliest universities and centres of higher education in the world, which was established during the late Vedic period in the 6th century BCE [52] The ancient university was documented by the invading forces of Alexander the Great and was also recorded by Chinese pilgrims in the 4th or 5th century CE [53] [54] [55] At its zenith, the Rai dynasty (489–632 CE) ruled Sindh and the surrounding territories [56]\n\n\nIslamic conquest\nThe Arab conqueror Muhammad ibn Qasim conquered Sindh and some regions of Punjab in 711 CE [46] [57] The Pakistan government's official chronology claims this as the time when the foundation of Pakistan was laid [58] The Early Medieval period (642–1219 CE) witnessed the spread of Islam in the region [59] Before the arrival of Islam beginning in the 8th century, the region of Pakistan was home to a diverse plethora of faiths, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Zoroastrianism [60] [61] During this period, Sufi missionaries played a pivotal role in converting a majority of the regional population to Islam [62] Upon the defeat of the Turk and Hindu Shahi dynasties which governed the Kabul Valley, Gandhara (present-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), and western Punjab in the 7th to 11th centuries CE, several successive Muslim empires ruled over the region, including the Ghaznavid Empire (975–1187 CE), the Ghorid Kingdom, and the Delhi Sultanate (1206–1526 CE) [63] The Lodi dynasty, the last of the Delhi Sultanate, was replaced by the Mughal Empire (1526–1857 CE) [64]\n\n\nColonial rule\nNone of modern Pakistan was under British rule until 1839 when Karachi, a small fishing village governed by Talpurs of Sindh with a mud fort guarding the harbour, was taken, [75] [76] and used as an enclave with a port and military base for the First Afghan War that ensued [77] The remainder of Sindh was acquired in 1843, [78] and subsequently, through a series of wars and treaties, the East India Company, and later, after the post-Sepoy Mutiny (1857–1858), direct rule by Queen Victoria of the British Empire, acquired most of the region [79] Key conflicts included those against the Baloch Talpur dynasty, resolved by the Battle of Miani (1843) in Sindh, [80] the Anglo-Sikh Wars (1845–1849), [81] and the Anglo-Afghan Wars (1839–1919) [82] By 1893, all modern Pakistan was part of the British Indian Empire, and remained so until independence in 1947 [83]\n\n\nIndependence\nThe 1946 elections saw the Muslim League secure 90 percent of the Muslim seats, supported by the landowners of Sindh and Punjab This forced the Indian National Congress, initially skeptical of the League's representation of Indian Muslims, to acknowledge its significance [97] Jinnah's emergence as the voice of the Indian Muslims, [58] compelled the British to consider their stance, despite their reluctance to partition India In a final attempt to prevent partition, they proposed the Cabinet Mission Plan [98]\n\n\nPost Independence\nAfter independence in 1947, Jinnah, the President of the Muslim League, became Pakistan's first Governor-General and the first President-Speaker of the Parliament, but he succumbed to tuberculosis on 11 September 1948 [111] [112] Meanwhile, Pakistan's founding fathers agreed to appoint Liaquat Ali Khan, the secretary-general of the party, the nation's first Prime Minister [110] [111] From 1947 to 1956, Pakistan was a monarchy within the Commonwealth of Nations, and had two monarchs before it became a republic [113]\n\n\nGeography\n30°N 70°E﻿ / ﻿30°N 70°E﻿ / 30; 70\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nThe diverse landscape and climate in Pakistan support a wide range of trees and plants [191] From coniferous alpine and subalpine trees like spruce, pine, and deodar cedar in the northern mountains to deciduous trees like shisham in the Sulaiman Mountains, [188] and palms such as coconut and date in the southern regions [192] [193] The western hills boast juniper, tamarisk, coarse grasses, and scrub plants [194] Mangrove forests dominate the coastal wetlands in the south [195] Coniferous forests span altitudes from 1,000 to 4,000 metres (3,300 to 13,100 feet) in most northern and northwestern highlands [196] In Balochistan's xeric regions, date palms and Ephedra are prevalent [192] [197] In Punjab and Sindh's Indus plains, tropical and subtropical dry and moist broadleaf forests as well as tropical and xeric shrublands thrive [198] Approximately 4.8% or 36,845.6 square kilometres (3,684,560 ha) of Pakistan was forested in 2021 [199] [j]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\n30°N 70°E﻿ / ﻿30°N 70°E﻿ / 30; 70\n\n\nRole of Islam\nPakistan, the only country established in the name of Islam, [248] had overwhelming support among Muslims, especially in provinces like the United Provinces, where Muslims were a minority [249] This idea, articulated by the Muslim League, the Islamic clergy, and Jinnah, envisioned an Islamic state [250] Jinnah, closely associated with the ulama, was described upon his death by Maulana Shabbir Ahmad Usmani as the greatest Muslim after Aurangzeb, aspiring to unite Muslims worldwide under Islam [251]\n\n\nAdministrative units\nPakistan, a federal parliamentary republic, consists of four provinces: Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, and Balochistan, along with three territories: Islamabad Capital Territory, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Azad Kashmir [280] The Government of Pakistan governs the western parts of the Kashmir Region, organized into separate political entities, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan [281] In 2009, the constitutional assignment (the Gilgit–Baltistan Empowerment and Self-Governance Order) granted Gilgit-Baltistan semi-provincial status, providing it with self-government [282]\n\n\nForeign relations\nSince independence, Pakistan has aimed to maintain an independent foreign policy [284] Pakistan's foreign policy and geostrategy focus on the economy, security, national identity, and territorial integrity, as well as building close ties with other Muslim nations [285] According to Hasan Askari Rizvi, a foreign policy expert, \"Pakistan highlights sovereign equality of states, bilateralism, mutuality of interests, and non-interference in each other's domestic affairs as the cardinal features of its foreign policy.\" [286]\n\n\nRelations with China\nPakistan was among the first nations to establish formal diplomatic ties with the China, [311] forging a strong relationship since China's 1962 conflict with India, culminating in a special bond [312] During the 1970s, Pakistan played a crucial role in China's global outreach, [313] facilitating US President Richard Nixon's historic visit to China [314] Despite changes in Pakistani governance and regional/global dynamics, China's influence in Pakistan remains paramount [313] In reciprocation, China stands as Pakistan's largest trading partner, with substantial investment in Pakistani infrastructure, notably the Gwadar port [315] In 2015 alone, they inked 51 agreements and Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) for cooperative efforts [316] Both nations signed a Free Trade Agreement in 2006, [317] with China making its largest investment in Pakistan's history through CPEC [318] Pakistan acts as China's liaison to the Muslim world, [319] and both nations support each other on sensitive issues like Kashmir, Taiwan, Xinjiang, and more [320]\n\n\nRelations with the Muslim world\nAfter Independence, Pakistan vigorously pursued bilateral relations with other Muslim countries [321] The Ali brothers sought to project Pakistan as the natural leader of the Islamic world, partly due to its significant manpower and military strength [322] Khaliquzzaman, a prominent Muslim League leader, declared Pakistan's ambition to unite all Muslim countries into Islamistan, a pan-Islamic entity [323]\n\n\nKashmir conflict\nKashmir, a Himalayan region at the northern tip of the Indian subcontinent, was governed as the autonomous princely state of Jammu and Kashmir during the British Raj before the Partition of India in August 1947 This sparked a major territorial dispute between India and Pakistan, resulting in several conflicts over the region India controls about 45.1% of Kashmir, including Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, while Pakistan controls roughly 38.2%, comprising Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit−Baltistan Additionally, about 20% of the region, known as Aksai Chin and the Shaksgam Valley, is under Chinese control [344] India claims the entire Kashmir region based on the Instrument of Accession signed by the princely state's ruler, Maharaja Hari Singh, [345] while Pakistan argues for its Muslim-majority population, [346] and geographical proximity to Pakistan [347] The United Nations was involved in resolving the conflict, leading to a ceasefire in 1949 and the establishment of the Line of Control (LoC) as a de facto border [348] India, fearing Kashmir's secession, did not hold the promised plebiscite, as it believed Kashmiris would vote to join Pakistan [349]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe armed forces of Pakistan rank sixth globally in personnel size, with about 660,000 on active duty and 291,000 paramilitary personnel as of 2024 [353] Established in 1947, they've wielded significant influence over national politics [354] The main branches include the Army, Navy, and Air Force, supported by numerous paramilitaries [355]\n\n\nMilitary history\nSince 1947, Pakistan has been involved in four conventional wars with India The first conflict occurred in Kashmir, with Pakistan gaining control of Western Kashmir and India retaining Eastern Kashmir Territorial disputes led to another war in 1965 The 1971 war resulted in Pakistan's unconditional surrender of East Pakistan [364] Tensions in Kargil brought the two countries to the brink of war [365] Since 1947, unresolved territorial problems with Afghanistan saw border skirmishes kept mostly at the mountainous border In 1961, the military and intelligence community repelled an Afghan incursion near the Durand Line border [366]\n\n\nLaw enforcement\nLaw enforcement in Pakistan consists of federal and provincial police agencies Each of the four provinces (Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Balochistan) has its own police force, while the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) has the Islamabad Police [378] Provincial police forces are led by an Inspector-General of Police (IGP) appointed by provincial governments However, top officers are from the Police Service of Pakistan (PSP), ensuring national standards across provincial forces.\n\n\nHuman rights\nIn 2018, Pakistan ranked 139 out of 180 countries in the Press Freedom Index by Reporters Without Borders, highlighting restrictions on freedom of the press [383] Television stations and newspapers face closures for publishing reports critical of the government or military [384] Male homosexuality is illegal in Pakistan, punishable with up to life in prison [385]\n\n\nEconomy\nPakistan's economy ranks 24th globally by purchasing power parity (PPP) and 43rd by nominal GDP Historically, Pakistan was part of the wealthiest region in the first millennium CE, but lost ground to regions like China and Western Europe by the 18th century [393] Pakistan is a developing country, [394] and part of the Next Eleven, poised to become one of the world's largest economies in the 21st century, alongside the BRICS [395]\n\n\nAgriculture and mining sector\nThe Pakistani economy has shifted from agriculture to services, with agriculture contributing only 20.9% of the GDP as of 2015 [421] Despite this, Pakistan's wheat production in 2005 surpassed Africa's and nearly matched South America's, highlighting its agricultural significance [422] The sector employs 43.5% of the labor force and is a major source of foreign exchange [421] [423]\n\n\nIndustry\nIndustry, constituting 19.74% of GDP and 24% of total employment, is the second-largest sector Large-scale manufacturing (LSM) dominates, representing 12.2% of GDP, with cement production thriving due to demand from Afghanistan and the domestic real estate sector [427] In 2013, Pakistan exported 7,708,557 metric tons of cement, with an installed capacity of 44,768,250 metric tons [428] The textile industry, a key player in Pakistan's manufacturing, contributes 9.5% to GDP and employs around 15 million people Pakistan ranks fourth globally in cotton production, with substantial spinning capacity, making it a major exporter of textile products in Asia [429] China is a significant buyer of Pakistani textiles, importing US$1.527 billion worth of textiles last fiscal year [430]\n\n\nServices\nAs of 2014–15, the services sector contributes 58.8% to GDP, [421] serving as the main driver of economic growth in Pakistan, [431] with a consumption-oriented society The sector's growth rate surpasses that of agriculture and industry, accounting for 54% of GDP and over one-third of total employment It has strong linkages with other sectors, providing essential inputs to agriculture and manufacturing [432] Pakistan's IT sector is one of the fastest-growing, ranked 110th for ICT development by the World Economic Forum [433] With around 82 million internet users as of May 2020, Pakistan ranks 9th globally, [434] [435] and its ICT industry is projected to exceed $10 billion by 2020 [436] With 12,000 employees, Pakistan is among the top five freelancing nations, [437] and its export performance in telecom, computer, and information services has notably improved [438]\n\n\nTourism\nWith its diverse cultures, landscapes, and attractions, Pakistan drew around 6.6 million foreign tourists in 2018 [439] However, this was a decline from the peak of tourism in the 1970s driven by the popular Hippie trail [440] Pakistan boasts attractions from mangroves in the south to Himalayan hill stations in the northeast, including ancient Buddhist ruins of Takht-i-Bahi and Taxila, the 5,000-year-old Indus Valley civilization sites such as Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, [441] and numerous mountain peaks over 7,000 metres (23,000 feet) [442] The northern part of Pakistan boasts numerous old fortresses, showcasing ancient architecture It encompasses the Hunza and Chitral valleys, where the small pre-Islamic Kalasha community resides, claiming descent from Alexander the Great [443] Lahore, Pakistan's cultural capital, showcases numerous examples of Mughal architecture, including the Badshahi Masjid, the Shalimar Gardens, the Tomb of Jahangir, and the Lahore Fort Following the 2005 Kashmir earthquake, The Guardian highlighted \"The top five tourist sites in Pakistan\" to boost tourism, featuring destinations like Taxila, Lahore, the Karakoram Highway, Karimabad, and Lake Saiful Muluk [444] Festivals and government initiatives aim to promote Pakistan's cultural heritage [445] In 2015, the World Economic Forum ranked Pakistan 125th out of 141 countries in its Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Report [446]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nPakistan was lauded as the top nation for infrastructure development in South Asia during the 2016 annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank [447]\n\n\nPower and energy\nAs of May 2021, Pakistan operates six licensed commercial nuclear power plants [448] The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) oversees these plants, while the Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority ensures their safe operation [449] These plants contribute approximately 5.8% to Pakistan's electricity supply, while fossil fuels (crude oil and natural gas) provide 64.2%, hydroelectric power provides 29.9%, and coal contributes 0.1% [450] [451] The KANUPP-I, Pakistan's first commercial nuclear power plant, was supplied by Canada in 1971 Sino-Pakistani nuclear cooperation began in the 1980s, leading to the establishment of CHASNUPP-I In 2005, both countries proposed a joint energy security plan, aiming for a generation capacity exceeding 160,000 MWe by 2030 Pakistan's Nuclear Energy Vision 2050 targets a capacity of 40,000 MWe, [452] with 8,900 MWe expected by 2030 [453]\n\n\nTransport\nPakistan boasts 2567 km of motorways and approximately 263,942 km of highways, which handle 92% of passengers and 96% of freight traffic Despite constituting only 4.6% of the total road length, these north-south links manage 85% of the nation's traffic They connect southern seaports such as Karachi port and Port Qasim in Sindh, along with Gwadar Port and Port of Pasni in Balochistan, to populous provinces like Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa domestically, and neighboring countries like Afghanistan, Central Asia, and China through the China Pakistan Economic Corridor [458] [459] [460] [461] According to the WEF's Global Competitiveness Report, Pakistan's port infrastructure quality ratings rose from 3.7 to 4.1 between 2007 and 2016 [462] The railway's share of inland traffic is reduced to below 8% for passengers and 4% for freight [421] This shift led to a decrease in total rail track from 8,775 kilometres (5,453 miles) in 1990–91 to 7,791 kilometres (4,841 miles) in 2011 [459] [458]\n\n\nScience and technology\nDevelopments in science and technology have played a significant role in Pakistan's infrastructure, linking the nation to the global community [480] Each year, the Pakistan Academy of Sciences and the government invite scientists worldwide to the International Nathiagali Summer College on Physics [481] In 2005, Pakistan hosted an international seminar on \"Physics in Developing Countries\" for the International Year of Physics [482] Pakistani theoretical physicist Abdus Salam won a Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the electroweak interaction [483] Pakistani scientists have made notable contributions in mathematics, biology, economics, computer science, and genetics [484]\n\n\nDemographics\nPakistan had a population of 241,495,112 according to the final results of the 2023 Census [501] [502] [503] This figure includes Pakistan's four provinces e.g Punjab, Sindh, KPK, Balochistan and Islamabad Capital Territory AJK and Gilgit-Baltistan's census data is yet to be approved by CCI Council of Pakistan Pakistan is the world's fifth most populous country [504]\n\n\nUrbanisation\nSince independence due to the partition of India, urbanisation has surged for various reasons In the south, Karachi stands as the most populous commercial hub along the Indus River [510] In the east, west, and north, a dense population arc spans cities like Lahore, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Sargodha, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Gujrat, Jhelum, Sheikhupura, Nowshera, Mardan, and Peshawar By 1990–2008, city dwellers constituted 36% of Pakistan's population, making it South Asia's most urbanized nation, with over 50% living in towns of 5,000+ inhabitants [511] Immigration, both domestic and international, significantly fuels urban growth Migration from India, especially to Karachi, the largest metropolis, and from nearby countries, accelerates urbanization, posing new political and socio-economic challenges Economic shifts like the green revolution and political developments also play crucial roles [512]\n\n\nEthnicity and languages\nLanguages of Pakistan (2023) [514]\n\n\nImmigration\nEven post-1947 partition, Indian Muslims kept migrating to Pakistan, especially Karachi and Sindh province [524] Wars in neighboring Afghanistan in the 1980s and 1990s pushed millions of Afghan refugees into Pakistan, mainly in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and tribal areas, with some in Karachi and Quetta Pakistan hosts one of the world's largest refugee populations [525] Additionally, around 2 million Bangladeshis and half a million undocumented individuals, purportedly from Myanmar, Iran, Iraq, and Africa, reside in Pakistan [526] In October 2023, Pakistan ordered the expulsion of Afghans from Pakistan [527]\n\n\nDiaspora\nAccording to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Pakistan has the sixth-largest diaspora globally [522] Approximately 7 million Pakistanis reside abroad, mainly in the Middle East, Europe, and North America [532] Pakistan ranks 10th globally for remittances sent home [417] [533] Saudi Arabia is the largest source of remittances, contributing $5.9 billion as of 2016 [update] [534] The term Overseas Pakistani is officially recognized by the Government of Pakistan, with the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development

ancient human civilisations in South Asia originated from areas encompassing present-day Pakistan [30] The earliest known inhabitants in the region were Soanian during the Lower Paleolithic, of whom artefacts have been found in the Soan Valley of Punjab [31] The Indus region, which covers most of the present-day Pakistan, was the site of several successive ancient cultures including the Neolithic (7000–4300 BCE) site of Mehrgarh, [32] [33] [34] and the 5,000-year history of urban life in South Asia to the various sites of the Indus Valley Civilisation, including Mohenjo-daro and Harappa [35] [36]\n\n\nVedic period\nFollowing the decline of the Indus valley civilization, Indo-Aryan tribes moved into the Punjab from Central Asia in several waves of migration in the Vedic period (1500–500 BCE), [38] bringing with them their distinctive religious traditions and practices which fused with local culture [39] The Indo-Aryans religious beliefs and practices from the Bactria–Margiana culture and the native Harappan Indus beliefs of the former Indus Valley civilization eventually gave rise to Vedic culture and tribes [39] Most notable among them was Gandhara civilization, which flourished at the crossroads of India, Central Asia, and the Middle East, connecting trade routes and absorbing cultural influences from diverse civilizations [40] The initial early Vedic culture was a tribal, pastoral society centered in the Indus Valley, of what is today Pakistan [41] During this period, the Vedas, the oldest scriptures of Hinduism, were composed [42] [i]\n\n\nClassical period\nThe western regions of Pakistan became part of Achaemenid Empire around 517 BCE [44] In 326 BCE, Alexander the Great conquered the region by defeating various local rulers, most notably, the King Porus, at Jhelum [45] It was followed by the Maurya Empire, founded by Chandragupta Maurya and extended by Ashoka the Great, until 185 BCE [46] [47] [48] The Indo-Greek Kingdom founded by Demetrius of Bactria (180–165 BCE) included Gandhara and Punjab and reached its greatest extent under Menander (165–150 BCE), prospering the Greco-Buddhist culture in the region [49] [50] [51] Taxila had one of the earliest universities and centres of higher education in the world, which was established during the late Vedic period in the 6th century BCE [52] The ancient university was documented by the invading forces of Alexander the Great and was also recorded by Chinese pilgrims in the 4th or 5th century CE [53] [54] [55] At its zenith, the Rai dynasty (489–632 CE) ruled Sindh and the surrounding territories [56]\n\n\nIslamic conquest\nThe Arab conqueror Muhammad ibn Qasim conquered Sindh and some regions of Punjab in 711 CE [46] [57] The Pakistan government's official chronology claims this as the time when the foundation of Pakistan was laid [58] The Early Medieval period (642–1219 CE) witnessed the spread of Islam in the region [59] Before the arrival of Islam beginning in the 8th century, the region of Pakistan was home to a diverse plethora of faiths, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Zoroastrianism [60] [61] During this period, Sufi missionaries played a pivotal role in converting a majority of the regional population to Islam [62] Upon the defeat of the Turk and Hindu Shahi dynasties which governed the Kabul Valley, Gandhara (present-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), and western Punjab in the 7th to 11th centuries CE, several successive Muslim empires ruled over the region, including the Ghaznavid Empire (975–1187 CE), the Ghorid Kingdom, and the Delhi Sultanate (1206–1526 CE) [63] The Lodi dynasty, the last of the Delhi Sultanate, was replaced by the Mughal Empire (1526–1857 CE) [64]\n\n\nColonial rule\nNone of modern Pakistan was under British rule until 1839 when Karachi, a small fishing village governed by Talpurs of Sindh with a mud fort guarding the harbour, was taken, [75] [76] and used as an enclave with a port and military base for the First Afghan War that ensued [77] The remainder of Sindh was acquired in 1843, [78] and subsequently, through a series of wars and treaties, the East India Company, and later, after the post-Sepoy Mutiny (1857–1858), direct rule by Queen Victoria of the British Empire, acquired most of the region [79] Key conflicts included those against the Baloch Talpur dynasty, resolved by the Battle of Miani (1843) in Sindh, [80] the Anglo-Sikh Wars (1845–1849), [81] and the Anglo-Afghan Wars (1839–1919) [82] By 1893, all modern Pakistan was part of the British Indian Empire, and remained so until independence in 1947 [83]\n\n\nIndependence\nThe 1946 elections saw the Muslim League secure 90 percent of the Muslim seats, supported by the landowners of Sindh and Punjab This forced the Indian National Congress, initially skeptical of the League's representation of Indian Muslims, to acknowledge its significance [97] Jinnah's emergence as the voice of the Indian Muslims, [58] compelled the British to consider their stance, despite their reluctance to partition India In a final attempt to prevent partition, they proposed the Cabinet Mission Plan [98]\n\n\nPost Independence\nAfter independence in 1947, Jinnah, the President of the Muslim League, became Pakistan's first Governor-General and the first President-Speaker of the Parliament, but he succumbed to tuberculosis on 11 September 1948 [111] [112] Meanwhile, Pakistan's founding fathers agreed to appoint Liaquat Ali Khan, the secretary-general of the party, the nation's first Prime Minister [110] [111] From 1947 to 1956, Pakistan was a monarchy within the Commonwealth of Nations, and had two monarchs before it became a republic [113]\n\n\nGeography\n30°N 70°E﻿ / ﻿30°N 70°E﻿ / 30; 70\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nThe diverse landscape and climate in Pakistan support a wide range of trees and plants [191] From coniferous alpine and subalpine trees like spruce, pine, and deodar cedar in the northern mountains to deciduous trees like shisham in the Sulaiman Mountains, [188] and palms such as coconut and date in the southern regions [192] [193] The western hills boast juniper, tamarisk, coarse grasses, and scrub plants [194] Mangrove forests dominate the coastal wetlands in the south [195] Coniferous forests span altitudes from 1,000 to 4,000 metres (3,300 to 13,100 feet) in most northern and northwestern highlands [196] In Balochistan's xeric regions, date palms and Ephedra are prevalent [192] [197] In Punjab and Sindh's Indus plains, tropical and subtropical dry and moist broadleaf forests as well as tropical and xeric shrublands thrive [198] Approximately 4.8% or 36,845.6 square kilometres (3,684,560 ha) of Pakistan was forested in 2021 [199] [j]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\n30°N 70°E﻿ / ﻿30°N 70°E﻿ / 30; 70\n\n\nRole of Islam\nPakistan, the only country established in the name of Islam, [248] had overwhelming support among Muslims, especially in provinces like the United Provinces, where Muslims were a minority [249] This idea, articulated by the Muslim League, the Islamic clergy, and Jinnah, envisioned an Islamic state [250] Jinnah, closely associated with the ulama, was described upon his death by Maulana Shabbir Ahmad Usmani as the greatest Muslim after Aurangzeb, aspiring to unite Muslims worldwide under Islam [251]\n\n\nAdministrative units\nPakistan, a federal parliamentary republic, consists of four provinces: Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, and Balochistan, along with three territories: Islamabad Capital Territory, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Azad Kashmir [280] The Government of Pakistan governs the western parts of the Kashmir Region, organized into separate political entities, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan [281] In 2009, the constitutional assignment (the Gilgit–Baltistan Empowerment and Self-Governance Order) granted Gilgit-Baltistan semi-provincial status, providing it with self-government [282]\n\n\nForeign relations\nSince independence, Pakistan has aimed to maintain an independent foreign policy [284] Pakistan's foreign policy and geostrategy focus on the economy, security, national identity, and territorial integrity, as well as building close ties with other Muslim nations [285] According to Hasan Askari Rizvi, a foreign policy expert, \"Pakistan highlights sovereign equality of states, bilateralism, mutuality of interests, and non-interference in each other's domestic affairs as the cardinal features of its foreign policy.\" [286]\n\n\nRelations with China\nPakistan was among the first nations to establish formal diplomatic ties with the China, [311] forging a strong relationship since China's 1962 conflict with India, culminating in a special bond [312] During the 1970s, Pakistan played a crucial role in China's global outreach, [313] facilitating US President Richard Nixon's historic visit to China [314] Despite changes in Pakistani governance and regional/global dynamics, China's influence in Pakistan remains paramount [313] In reciprocation, China stands as Pakistan's largest trading partner, with substantial investment in Pakistani infrastructure, notably the Gwadar port [315] In 2015 alone, they inked 51 agreements and Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) for cooperative efforts [316] Both nations signed a Free Trade Agreement in 2006, [317] with China making its largest investment in Pakistan's history through CPEC [318] Pakistan acts as China's liaison to the Muslim world, [319] and both nations support each other on sensitive issues like Kashmir, Taiwan, Xinjiang, and more [320]\n\n\nRelations with the Muslim world\nAfter Independence, Pakistan vigorously pursued bilateral relations with other Muslim countries [321] The Ali brothers sought to project Pakistan as the natural leader of the Islamic world, partly due to its significant manpower and military strength [322] Khaliquzzaman, a prominent Muslim League leader, declared Pakistan's ambition to unite all Muslim countries into Islamistan, a pan-Islamic entity [323]\n\n\nKashmir conflict\nKashmir, a Himalayan region at the northern tip of the Indian subcontinent, was governed as the autonomous princely state of Jammu and Kashmir during the British Raj before the Partition of India in August 1947 This sparked a major territorial dispute between India and Pakistan, resulting in several conflicts over the region India controls about 45.1% of Kashmir, including Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, while Pakistan controls roughly 38.2%, comprising Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit−Baltistan Additionally, about 20% of the region, known as Aksai Chin and the Shaksgam Valley, is under Chinese control [344] India claims the entire Kashmir region based on the Instrument of Accession signed by the princely state's ruler, Maharaja Hari Singh, [345] while Pakistan argues for its Muslim-majority population, [346] and geographical proximity to Pakistan [347] The United Nations was involved in resolving the conflict, leading to a ceasefire in 1949 and the establishment of the Line of Control (LoC) as a de facto border [348] India, fearing Kashmir's secession, did not hold the promised plebiscite, as it believed Kashmiris would vote to join Pakistan [349]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe armed forces of Pakistan rank sixth globally in personnel size, with about 660,000 on active duty and 291,000 paramilitary personnel as of 2024 [353] Established in 1947, they've wielded significant influence over national politics [354] The main branches include the Army, Navy, and Air Force, supported by numerous paramilitaries [355]\n\n\nMilitary history\nSince 1947, Pakistan has been involved in four conventional wars with India The first conflict occurred in Kashmir, with Pakistan gaining control of Western Kashmir and India retaining Eastern Kashmir Territorial disputes led to another war in 1965 The 1971 war resulted in Pakistan's unconditional surrender of East Pakistan [364] Tensions in Kargil brought the two countries to the brink of war [365] Since 1947, unresolved territorial problems with Afghanistan saw border skirmishes kept mostly at the mountainous border In 1961, the military and intelligence community repelled an Afghan incursion near the Durand Line border [366]\n\n\nLaw enforcement\nLaw enforcement in Pakistan consists of federal and provincial police agencies Each of the four provinces (Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Balochistan) has its own police force, while the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) has the Islamabad Police [378] Provincial police forces are led by an Inspector-General of Police (IGP) appointed by provincial governments However, top officers are from the Police Service of Pakistan (PSP), ensuring national standards across provincial forces.\n\n\nHuman rights\nIn 2018, Pakistan ranked 139 out of 180 countries in the Press Freedom Index by Reporters Without Borders, highlighting restrictions on freedom of the press [383] Television stations and newspapers face closures for publishing reports critical of the government or military [384] Male homosexuality is illegal in Pakistan, punishable with up to life in prison [385]\n\n\nEconomy\nPakistan's economy ranks 24th globally by purchasing power parity (PPP) and 43rd by nominal GDP Historically, Pakistan was part of the wealthiest region in the first millennium CE, but lost ground to regions like China and Western Europe by the 18th century [393] Pakistan is a developing country, [394] and part of the Next Eleven, poised to become one of the world's largest economies in the 21st century, alongside the BRICS [395]\n\n\nAgriculture and mining sector\nThe Pakistani economy has shifted from agriculture to services, with agriculture contributing only 20.9% of the GDP as of 2015 [421] Despite this, Pakistan's wheat production in 2005 surpassed Africa's and nearly matched South America's, highlighting its agricultural significance [422] The sector employs 43.5% of the labor force and is a major source of foreign exchange [421] [423]\n\n\nIndustry\nIndustry, constituting 19.74% of GDP and 24% of total employment, is the second-largest sector Large-scale manufacturing (LSM) dominates, representing 12.2% of GDP, with cement production thriving due to demand from Afghanistan and the domestic real estate sector [427] In 2013, Pakistan exported 7,708,557 metric tons of cement, with an installed capacity of 44,768,250 metric tons [428] The textile industry, a key player in Pakistan's manufacturing, contributes 9.5% to GDP and employs around 15 million people Pakistan ranks fourth globally in cotton production, with substantial spinning capacity, making it a major exporter of textile products in Asia [429] China is a significant buyer of Pakistani textiles, importing US$1.527 billion worth of textiles last fiscal year [430]\n\n\nServices\nAs of 2014–15, the services sector contributes 58.8% to GDP, [421] serving as the main driver of economic growth in Pakistan, [431] with a consumption-oriented society The sector's growth rate surpasses that of agriculture and industry, accounting for 54% of GDP and over one-third of total employment It has strong linkages with other sectors, providing essential inputs to agriculture and manufacturing [432] Pakistan's IT sector is one of the fastest-growing, ranked 110th for ICT development by the World Economic Forum [433] With around 82 million internet users as of May 2020, Pakistan ranks 9th globally, [434] [435] and its ICT industry is projected to exceed $10 billion by 2020 [436] With 12,000 employees, Pakistan is among the top five freelancing nations, [437] and its export performance in telecom, computer, and information services has notably improved [438]\n\n\nTourism\nWith its diverse cultures, landscapes, and attractions, Pakistan drew around 6.6 million foreign tourists in 2018 [439] However, this was a decline from the peak of tourism in the 1970s driven by the popular Hippie trail [440] Pakistan boasts attractions from mangroves in the south to Himalayan hill stations in the northeast, including ancient Buddhist ruins of Takht-i-Bahi and Taxila, the 5,000-year-old Indus Valley civilization sites such as Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, [441] and numerous mountain peaks over 7,000 metres (23,000 feet) [442] The northern part of Pakistan boasts numerous old fortresses, showcasing ancient architecture It encompasses the Hunza and Chitral valleys, where the small pre-Islamic Kalasha community resides, claiming descent from Alexander the Great [443] Lahore, Pakistan's cultural capital, showcases numerous examples of Mughal architecture, including the Badshahi Masjid, the Shalimar Gardens, the Tomb of Jahangir, and the Lahore Fort Following the 2005 Kashmir earthquake, The Guardian highlighted \"The top five tourist sites in Pakistan\" to boost tourism, featuring destinations like Taxila, Lahore, the Karakoram Highway, Karimabad, and Lake Saiful Muluk [444] Festivals and government initiatives aim to promote Pakistan's cultural heritage [445] In 2015, the World Economic Forum ranked Pakistan 125th out of 141 countries in its Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Report [446]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nPakistan was lauded as the top nation for infrastructure development in South Asia during the 2016 annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank [447]\n\n\nPower and energy\nAs of May 2021, Pakistan operates six licensed commercial nuclear power plants [448] The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) oversees these plants, while the Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority ensures their safe operation [449] These plants contribute approximately 5.8% to Pakistan's electricity supply, while fossil fuels (crude oil and natural gas) provide 64.2%, hydroelectric power provides 29.9%, and coal contributes 0.1% [450] [451] The KANUPP-I, Pakistan's first commercial nuclear power plant, was supplied by Canada in 1971 Sino-Pakistani nuclear cooperation began in the 1980s, leading to the establishment of CHASNUPP-I In 2005, both countries proposed a joint energy security plan, aiming for a generation capacity exceeding 160,000 MWe by 2030 Pakistan's Nuclear Energy Vision 2050 targets a capacity of 40,000 MWe, [452] with 8,900 MWe expected by 2030 [453]\n\n\nTransport\nPakistan boasts 2567 km of motorways and approximately 263,942 km of highways, which handle 92% of passengers and 96% of freight traffic Despite constituting only 4.6% of the total road length, these north-south links manage 85% of the nation's traffic They connect southern seaports such as Karachi port and Port Qasim in Sindh, along with Gwadar Port and Port of Pasni in Balochistan, to populous provinces like Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa domestically, and neighboring countries like Afghanistan, Central Asia, and China through the China Pakistan Economic Corridor [458] [459] [460] [461] According to the WEF's Global Competitiveness Report, Pakistan's port infrastructure quality ratings rose from 3.7 to 4.1 between 2007 and 2016 [462] The railway's share of inland traffic is reduced to below 8% for passengers and 4% for freight [421] This shift led to a decrease in total rail track from 8,775 kilometres (5,453 miles) in 1990–91 to 7,791 kilometres (4,841 miles) in 2011 [459] [458]\n\n\nScience and technology\nDevelopments in science and technology have played a significant role in Pakistan's infrastructure, linking the nation to the global community [480] Each year, the Pakistan Academy of Sciences and the government invite scientists worldwide to the International Nathiagali Summer College on Physics [481] In 2005, Pakistan hosted an international seminar on \"Physics in Developing Countries\" for the International Year of Physics [482] Pakistani theoretical physicist Abdus Salam won a Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the electroweak interaction [483] Pakistani scientists have made notable contributions in mathematics, biology, economics, computer science, and genetics [484]\n\n\nDemographics\nPakistan had a population of 241,495,112 according to the final results of the 2023 Census [501] [502] [503] This figure includes Pakistan's four provinces e.g Punjab, Sindh, KPK, Balochistan and Islamabad Capital Territory AJK and Gilgit-Baltistan's census data is yet to be approved by CCI Council of Pakistan Pakistan is the world's fifth most populous country [504]\n\n\nUrbanisation\nSince independence due to the partition of India, urbanisation has surged for various reasons In the south, Karachi stands as the most populous commercial hub along the Indus River [510] In the east, west, and north, a dense population arc spans cities like Lahore, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Sargodha, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Gujrat, Jhelum, Sheikhupura, Nowshera, Mardan, and Peshawar By 1990–2008, city dwellers constituted 36% of Pakistan's population, making it South Asia's most urbanized nation, with over 50% living in towns of 5,000+ inhabitants [511] Immigration, both domestic and international, significantly fuels urban growth Migration from India, especially to Karachi, the largest metropolis, and from nearby countries, accelerates urbanization, posing new political and socio-economic challenges Economic shifts like the green revolution and political developments also play crucial roles [512]\n\n\nEthnicity and languages\nLanguages of Pakistan (2023) [514]\n\n\nImmigration\nEven post-1947 partition, Indian Muslims kept migrating to Pakistan, especially Karachi and Sindh province [524] Wars in neighboring Afghanistan in the 1980s and 1990s pushed millions of Afghan refugees into Pakistan, mainly in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and tribal areas, with some in Karachi and Quetta Pakistan hosts one of the world's largest refugee populations [525] Additionally, around 2 million Bangladeshis and half a million undocumented individuals, purportedly from Myanmar, Iran, Iraq, and Africa, reside in Pakistan [526] In October 2023, Pakistan ordered the expulsion of Afghans from Pakistan [527]\n\n\nDiaspora\nAccording to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Pakistan has the sixth-largest diaspora globally [522] Approximately 7 million Pakistanis reside abroad, mainly in the Middle East, Europe, and North America [532] Pakistan ranks 10th globally for remittances sent home [417] [533] Saudi Arabia is the largest source of remittances, contributing $5.9 billion as of 2016 [update] [534] The term Overseas Pakistani is officially recognized by the Government of Pakistan, with the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development addressing their needs, welfare, and issues Overseas Pakistanis constitute the second-largest source of foreign exchange remittances to Pakistan, with remittances increasing by over 100% from US$8.9 billion in 2009–10 to US$19.9 billion in 2015–16 [416] [533]\n\n\nReligion\nIslam is the state religion, [222] with freedom of religion guaranteed by the constitution [536] [537] The majority are Muslims (96.47%), followed by Hindus (2.14%) and Christians (1.27%) Minorities include Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Zoroastrians (Parsi), and the unique Kalash people who practice animism [538] Additionally, a small percentage profess no faith, as seen in the 1998 census.\n\n\nIslam\nIslam dominates in Pakistan, with about 96.5% of the population being Muslim [539] Pakistan ranks second globally in Muslim population, [540] and is home to 10.5% of the world's Muslims [541] Karachi is the largest Muslim city in the world [542]\n\n\nHinduism\nHinduism is the second-largest religion, followed by 2.14% of the population according to 2017 census [551] [552] Pakistan had the fifth-largest Hindu population globally in 2010 [553] In 2017, Hindus numbered 4,444,437 [554] They reside across Pakistan but are concentrated in Sindh, where they make up 8.73% of the population [551] Umerkot district is the only Hindu majority area Tharparkar district hosts the largest Hindu population Four districts – Umerkot, Tharparkar, Mirpurkhas, and Sanghar – have over half of Pakistan's Hindus [555]\n\n\nChristianity and other religions\nChristians are the next largest religious minority after Hindus, constituting 1.27% of the population [517] They are concentrated in Lahore District (5%) and Islamabad Capital Territory (over 4%) Karachi hosts a historic Roman Catholic community established by Goan and Tamil migrants during British colonial rule [555]\n\n\nEducation\nPakistan's constitution mandates free primary and secondary education, [563] with public universities established in each province, including Punjab University, Sindh University, Peshawar University, Karachi University, and Balochistan University The country's educational landscape encompasses both public and private universities, fostering collaboration to enhance research and higher education opportunities, albeit with concerns regarding teaching quality in newer institutions [564] Technical and vocational institutions in Pakistan number approximately 3,193, [565] complemented by madrassahs providing free Islamic education to students, [566] with government efforts to regulate and monitor their quality amidst concerns over extremists recruitment [567] Education is divided into six main levels, including nursery, primary, middle, matriculation, intermediate, and university programs [565] Additionally, private schools offer a parallel secondary education system based on the curriculum set by the Cambridge International Examinations, [568] with 439 international schools reported in Pakistan [569]\n\n\nCulture\nCivil society in Pakistan is hierarchical, emphasizing local cultural etiquette and traditional Islamic values The primary family unit is the extended family, but there's a rising trend towards nuclear families due to socio-economic factors [575] [576] Both men and women typically wear Shalwar Kameez; men also favor trousers, jeans, and shirts [577] The middle class has grown to about 35 million, with another 17 million in the upper and upper-middle classes, leading to a shift in power from rural landowners to urban elites [578] Festivals like Eid-ul-Fitr, Eid-ul-Azha, Ramadan, Christmas, Easter, Holi, and Diwali are primarily religious [575] Pakistan ranks 56th on the A.T Kearney/FP Globalization Index due to increasing globalization [579]\n\n\nArchitecture\nFour periods define Pakistani architecture: pre-Islamic, Islamic, colonial, and post-colonial The onset of the Indus civilization around the mid-3rd millennium BCE heralded an urban culture, evidenced by surviving large structures [580] Notable pre-Islamic settlements include Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, and Kot Diji [581] The fusion of Buddhism and Greek influences birthed a distinctive Greco-Buddhist style from the 1st century CE, exemplified by the renowned Gandhara style [582] Notable Buddhist architectural remnants include the Takht-i-Bahi monastery in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa [583]\n\n\nClothing, arts, and fashion\nThe Shalwar Kameez is Pakistan's national dress, worn in all provinces: Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Azad Kashmir Each province has its own style Pakistanis wear a variety of fabrics like silk, chiffon, and cotton In addition to the national dress, men often wear domestically tailored suits and neckties, especially in offices, schools, and social gatherings [586]\n\n\nLiterature and philosophy\nPakistan boasts literature in various languages including Urdu, Sindhi, Punjabi, Pashto, Baluchi, Persian, English, and more [588] The Pakistan Academy of Letters actively promotes literature and poetry both domestically and internationally [589] National Library contributes to literary dissemination Historically, Pakistani literature consisted mainly of lyric, religious, and folkloric works, later diversifying under colonial influence into prose fiction, now widely embraced [590] [591]\n\n\nMedia and entertainment\nThe private print media, state-owned Pakistan Television Corporation (PTV), and Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation (PBC) dominated media until the 21st century Pakistan now boasts a vast network of domestic, privately owned 24-hour news media and television channels [597] A 2021 report by the Reporters Without Borders ranked Pakistan 157th among 180 nations on the Press Freedom Index, citing pressures faced by Pakistani reporters, particularly when reporting against the army or government [598] The BBC describes Pakistani media as \"among the most outspoken in South Asia\" [599] Pakistani media has been instrumental in exposing corruption [600]\n\n\nCuisine\nPakistani cuisine, rooted in the royal kitchens of 16th-century Mughal emperors, blends influences from British, Indian, Central Asian, and Middle Eastern culinary traditions [607] Unlike Middle Eastern fare, Pakistani dishes are heavily spiced with garlic, ginger, turmeric, chili, and garam masala Roti, a wheat-based flatbread, accompanies most meals, alongside curry, meat, vegetables, and lentils Rice is also common, served plain, spiced, or in sweet dishes [179] [608] Lassi, a traditional drink from the Punjab region, and black tea with milk and sugar are popular beverages enjoyed nationwide [577] [609] Sohan halwa, a beloved sweet dish from southern Punjab, is savored across Pakistan [610]\n\n\nSports\nCricket is the most popular sport in Pakistan, followed by football Field hockey is the national sport Other sports like squash, polo, and traditional games are also

White House advisor to Donald Trump. She was born on January 20, 1967, in Camden, New Jersey, to Diane (née DiNatale) and John Fitzpatrick.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nConway's father had German, English, and Irish ancestry, while her mother is of Italian descent. Her parents divorced when she was three, and she was raised by her mother, grandmother, and two unmarried aunts in Atco, New Jersey. Conway graduated from St. Joseph High School in 1985 as class valedictorian in a high school with 140 students. In high school, she was a cheerleader, played field hockey, worked on floats for parades, and was a member of the choir.\n\n**Early Career**\n\nConway entered the polling business when she was in law school, working as a research assistant for Wirthlin Group, a Republican polling firm. After graduating, she initially considered working for a law firm but chose to work for Luntz Research Companies instead. While a student at Trinity College, she had met and become friends with Frank Luntz, the founder, on a year abroad at Oxford University. In 1995, she founded her own firm, the Polling Company, which consulted on consumer trends, often trends regarding women. Her clients have included Vaseline, American Express, and Hasbro.\n\n**2016 Presidential Election**\n\nWhen the 2016 election campaigns got underway, Conway had been acquainted with Donald Trump for years because she lived in Trump World Tower from 2001 to 2008 and sat on the condo board. Yet she initially endorsed Ted Cruz in the 2016 Republican presidential primary and chaired a pro-Cruz political action committee known as Keep the Promise I, which was almost entirely funded by businessman Robert Mercer. Conway's organization criticized Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump as \"extreme\" and \"not a conservative.\" On January 25, 2016, Conway criticized Trump as \"a man who seems to be offending his way to the nomination.\" On January 26, Conway criticized Trump's use of eminent domain, saying, \"Donald Trump has literally bulldozed over the little guy to get his way.\"\n\n**Trump Campaign**\n\nOn July 1, 2016, Trump announced that he had hired Conway for a senior advisory position on his presidential campaign. Conway was expected to advise Trump on how to better appeal to female voters. On August 19, following the resignation of Paul Manafort, Trump named Conway the campaign's third campaign manager. She served in this capacity for 10 weeks, through the November 8 general election, and was the first woman to successfully run an American presidential campaign and the first woman to run a Republican general election presidential campaign.\n\n**Presidential Transition**\n\nOn November 10, 2016, Conway publicly tweeted that Trump had offered her a White House job. \"I can have any job I want,\" she said on November 28. On November 24, Conway tweeted that she was \"Receiving deluge of social media & private comms re: Romney Some Trump loyalists warn against Romney as sec of state\" with a link to an article on Trump loyalists' discontent for the 2012 nominee. Conway told CNN she was only tweeting what she had shared with President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence in private.\n\n**White House Advisor**\n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, Conway allegedly punched a tuxedo-clad man at an exclusive inauguration ball just hours after Trump was sworn in as president. In an attempt to break up a scuffle, Conway stepped between two men, but they would not break up the fight, and Conway apparently punched one of them in the face with closed fists at least three times.\n\n**Alternative Facts**\n\nDuring a Meet the Press interview two days after Trump's presidential inauguration, Conway used the phrase \"alternative facts\" to defend statements made by White House press secretary Sean Spicer regarding the inauguration's crowd size. Conway's phrase reminded some of \"Newspeak,\" an obfuscatory language style that is a key element of the society portrayed in George Orwell's dystopian novel 1984. Soon after Conway's interview, sales of the book had increased by 9,500%, which The New York Times and others attributed to Conway's use of the phrase, making it the number-one bestseller on Amazon.com.\n\n**Bowling Green Massacre**\n\nOn February 2, 2017, Conway appeared in a television news show interview on Hardball with Chris Matthews. In order to justify President Trump's immigration ban, she referenced an event allegedly perpetrated by Iraqi terrorists she termed the \"Bowling Green massacre.\" Such an event never took place. Vox suggested Conway was referring to the 2011 arrest of two Iraqi refugees in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Conway stated the next day that she meant to say \"Bowling Green terrorists,\" both of whom had pleaded guilty to carrying out and supporting attacks on American soldiers in Iraq. There was never any suggestion that they had planned to carry out attacks in the United States.\n\n**Ethics Violations Under the Hatch Act**\n\nThe Hatch Act of 1939 states that federal government employees must not advocate their political beliefs while representing a public office. Violating such a law can result in such an employee being removed from public office, but not jailed.

So we decided to share credit.\" [15] [18] They chose the sections of the book they liked and put them together like building blocks [3] Scorsese persuaded Pileggi that they did not need to follow a traditional narrative structure Scorsese wanted to take the gangster film and deal with it episode by episode, but start in the middle and move backwards and forwards Scorsese compacted scenes, realizing that, if they were kept short, \"the impact after about an hour and a half would be terrific.\" [3] He wanted to use narration in a manner reminiscent of François Truffaut's 1962 film Jules and Jim and use \"all the basic tricks of the New Wave from around 1961.\" [3] The names of several real-life gangsters were altered for the film; Tommy \"Two Gun\" DeSimone became Tommy DeVito, Paul Vario became Paulie Cicero, and Jimmy \"The Gent\" Burke became Jimmy Conway, after Burke's birth surname [18] [19] Scorsese initially titled the film Wise Guy, but later, he and Pileggi decided to change the title of their film to Goodfellas because two contemporary projects, the 1986 Brian De Palma film Wise Guys and the 1987–1990 TV series Wiseguy, had used similar titles [3]\n\n\nCasting\nOnce Robert De Niro agreed to play Jimmy Conway, Scorsese was able to secure the money needed to make the film [12] Ray Liotta, who played Henry Hill, had read Pileggi's book when it came out and was fascinated by it A couple of years afterward, his agent told him Scorsese was going to direct a film adaptation In 1988, Liotta met Scorsese over a period of a couple of months and auditioned for the film [13] He campaigned aggressively for a role, though Warner Bros Pictures wanted a well-known actor; he later said, \"I think they would've rather had Eddie Murphy than me.\" [20] Scorsese cast Liotta after De Niro saw him in Jonathan Demme's Something Wild (1986); Scorsese was surprised by \"his explosive energy\" in that film [17] Al Pacino [21] and John Malkovich were considered for the role of Conway, and Sean Penn, Alec Baldwin, Val Kilmer, and Tom Cruise were considered for the role of Hill [22] [23] [24]\n\n\nPhotography\nThe film was shot on location in Queens, Upstate New York, New Jersey, and parts of Long Island during the spring and summer of 1989, with a budget of $25 million [18] Scorsese broke the film down into sequences and storyboarded everything because of the complicated style throughout The filmmaker stated, \" [I] wanted lots of movement and I wanted it to be throughout the whole picture, and I wanted the style to kind of break down by the end, so that by  [Henry's] last day as a wise guy, it's as if the whole picture would be out of control, give the impression he's just going to spin off the edge and fly out.\" [11] He added that the film's style came from the opening scenes of Jules and Jim: extensive narration, quick edits, freeze frames, and multiple locale switches [14] It was this reckless attitude towards convention that mirrored the attitude of many of the gangsters in the film Scorsese remarked, \"So if you do the movie, you say, 'I don't care if there's too much narration Too many quick cuts?—That's too bad.' It's that kind of really punk attitude we're trying to show.\" [14] He adopted a frenetic style to almost overwhelm the audience with images and information [3] He also put plenty of detail in every frame because he believed the gangster life is so rich Freeze-frames were used for certain scenes because Scorsese wanted to highlight that \"a point was being reached\" in Henry's life [3]\n\n\nPost-production\nScorsese wanted to depict the film's violence realistically, \"cold, unfeeling and horrible Almost incidental.\" [12] However, he had to remove 10 frames of blood to ensure an R rating from the MPAA [17] Goodfellas was Scorsese's most expensive film to that point but still only a medium-sized budget by Hollywood standards It was also the first time he was obliged by Warner to preview the film At two preview screenings in California, audiences were \"agitated\" by the sequence depicting Henry's final day as a gangster, which Scorsese argued was his and editor Thelma Schoonmaker's intention [3] In the first test screening, forty audience members walked out in the first ten minutes [33] One of the favorite scenes for test audiences was the \"Funny like a clown? Do I amuse you?\" scene [3]\n\n\nSoundtrack\nWhile there is no incidental score as such in the film, Scorsese chose songs for the soundtrack that he felt obliquely commented on the scene or the characters [17] In a given scene, he used only music contemporary to or older than the scene's setting According to Scorsese, a many of non-dialogue scenes were shot to playback For example, he had \"Layla\" by Derek and the Dominos playing on the set while shooting the scene where the dead bodies are discovered in the car, dumpster, and meat truck Sometimes, the lyrics of songs were put between lines of dialogue to comment on the action [3] Some of the music Scorsese had written into the script, while other songs he discovered during the editing phase [33]\n\n\nRelease\nGoodfellas premiered at the 47th Venice International Film Festival, where Scorsese received the Silver Lion award for best director [35] It was given a wide release in North America on September 21, 1990.\n\n\nTheatrical\nGoodfellas premiered at the 47th Venice International Film Festival, where Scorsese received the Silver Lion award for best director [35] It was given a wide release in North America on September 21, 1990.\n\n\nHome media\nGoodfellas was released on DVD in March 1997, in a single-disc, double-sided, single-layer format that requires the disc to be flipped during viewing; in 2004, Warner Home Video released a two-disc, dual-layer version, with remastered picture and sound, and bonus materials such as commentary tracks [36] In early 2007, the film became available on single Blu-ray with all the features from the 2004 release; an expanded Blu-ray version was released on February 16, 2010, for its 20th anniversary, [37] bundled with a disc with features that include the 2008 documentary Public Enemies: The Golden Age of the Gangster Film [36] On May 5, 2015, a 25th anniversary edition was released [38] The film was released on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray on December 6, 2016 [39] The 25th anniversary release and subsequent releases include a Merrie Melodies & Looney Tunes collection with the shorts I Like Mountain Music (1933), She Was an Acrobat's Daughter (1937), Racketeer Rabbit (1946), and Bugs and Thugs (1954).\n\n\nReception\nGoodfellas grossed $6.3 million from 1,070 theaters in opening weekend, topping the box office [40] In its second weekend the film made $5.9 million from 1,291 theaters, falling just 8% and finishing second behind newcomer Pacific Heights [41] It went on to make $46.8 million domestically [42] [4]\n\n\nBox office\nGoodfellas grossed $6.3 million from 1,070 theaters in opening weekend, topping the box office [40] In its second weekend the film made $5.9 million from 1,291 theaters, falling just 8% and finishing second behind newcomer Pacific Heights [41] It went on to make $46.8 million domestically [42] [4]\n\n\nCritical response\nAccording to review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 95% of 164 critics have given the film a positive review, with an average rating of 9.00/10 The website's critics consensus reads, \"Hard-hitting and stylish, GoodFellas is a gangster classic—and arguably the high point of Martin Scorsese's career.\" [43] Metacritic has assigned the film a weighted average score of 92 out of 100 based on reviews from 21 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\" [44] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale [45]\n\n\nLists\nThe film was ranked the best of 1990 by Roger Ebert, [52] Gene Siskel, [52] and Peter Travers [53] In a poll of 80 film critics, Goodfellas was named the best film of the year by 34 critics Director Martin Scorsese was chosen as the year's best director in 45 of the 80 ballots [54]\n\n\nAccolades\nGoodfellas is 1 of 8 films to have won Best Picture from three out of the four major U.S film critics' groups (LA, NY, and NSFC, in its case) along with Nashville, All the President's Men, Terms of Endearment, Pulp Fiction, The Hurt Locker, Drive My Car, and Tár.\n\n\nLegacy\nGoodfellas is No 94 on the American Film Institute's \"100 Years, 100 Movies\" list and moved up to No 92 on its AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) from 2007 In June 2008, the AFI put Goodfellas at No 2 on their AFI's 10 Top 10—the best ten films in ten \"classic\" American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the movie-related community [63] Goodfellas was regarded as the second-best in the gangster film genre (after The Godfather) [64] In 2000, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film \"culturally significant\" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.\n\n\nNotes\nOf note are the differences between the movie and what happened in real life Although the movie is mostly true, there are still a few slight differences For instance, Thomas DeSimone, who Tommy DeVito is based on, was much taller, younger, and muscular [81] [clarification needed] [tone] Also, although the real Billy Batts probably did insult Tommy and make remarks about shining his shoes, the real reason Tommy attacked him was that Jimmy Burke wanted to take over his loan-shark business in Queens [82] [tone] \nThe movie had its behind-the-scenes featuerette premiere in the Spring of 1990 on Cinemax, on Beyond the Screen, hosted by Matt Lauer and many other hosts.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Queer", "content": "\nOrigins and early use\nEntering the English language in the 16th century, queer originally meant \"strange\", \"odd\", \"peculiar\", or \"eccentric\" It might refer to something suspicious or \"not quite right\", or to a person with mild derangement or who exhibits socially inappropriate behaviour [6] [12] The Northern English expression \"there's nowt so queer as folk\", meaning \"there is nothing as strange as people\", employs this meaning [13] Related meanings of queer include a feeling of unwellness or something that is questionable or suspicious [6] [12] In the 1922 comic monologue \"My Word, You Do Look Queer\", the word is taken to mean \"unwell\" [14] The expression \"in Queer Street\" is used in the United Kingdom for someone in financial trouble Over time, queer acquired a number of meanings related to sexuality and gender, from narrowly meaning \"gay or lesbian\" [15] to referring to those who are \"not heterosexual\" to referring to those who are either not heterosexual or not cisgender (those who are LGBT+) [15] [16] The term is still widely used in Hiberno-English with its original meaning as well as to provide adverbial emphasis (very, extremely) [17]\n\n\nEarly pejorative use\nBy the late 19th century, queer was beginning to gain a connotation of sexual deviance, used to refer to feminine men or men who were thought to have engaged in same-sex relationships An early recorded usage of the word in this sense was in an 1894 letter by John Sholto Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry, as read aloud at the trial of Oscar Wilde [18] [19]\n\n\nEarly 20th-century queer identity\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, queer, fairy, trade, and gay signified distinct social categories within the gay male subculture In his book Gay New York, Chauncey noted that queer was used as a within-community identity term by men who were stereotypically masculine [24] Many queer-identified men at the time were, according to Chauncey, \"repelled by the style of the fairy and his loss of manly status, and almost all were careful to distinguish themselves from such men\", especially because the dominant straight culture did not acknowledge such distinctions Trade referred to straight men who would engage in same-sex activity; Chauncey describes trade as \"the 'normal men'  [queers] claimed to be.\" [20]\n\n\nReclamation\nBeginning in the 1980s, the label queer began to be reclaimed from its pejorative use as a neutral or positive self-identifier by LGBT people [6] An early example of this usage was by an LGBT organisation called Queer Nation, which was formed in March 1990 and circulated an anonymous flier at the New York Gay Pride Parade in June 1990 titled \"Queers Read This\" [3] The flier included a passage explaining their adoption of the label queer:\n\n\nGeneral\nBeginning in the 1980s, the label queer began to be reclaimed from its pejorative use as a neutral or positive self-identifier by LGBT people [6] An early example of this usage was by an LGBT organisation called Queer Nation, which was formed in March 1990 and circulated an anonymous flier at the New York Gay Pride Parade in June 1990 titled \"Queers Read This\" [3] The flier included a passage explaining their adoption of the label queer:\n\n\nOther usage\nThe term may be capitalized when referring to an identity or community, in a construction similar to the capitalized use of Deaf [27] The 'Q' in extended versions of the LGBT acronym, such as LGBTQIA+, [28] is most often considered an abbreviation of queer It can also stand for questioning [29]\n\n\nReactions\nReclamation and use of the term queer is controversial; several people and organizations, both LGBT and non-LGBT, object to some or all uses of the word for various reasons [30] Some LGBT people dislike the use of queer as an umbrella term because they associate it with political and social radicalism; they say that deliberate use of the epithet queer by political radicals has, in their view, played a role in dividing the LGBT community by political opinion, class, gender, age, and other factors Sociologist Joshua Gamson argues that the controversy about the word also marks a social and political divide in the LGBT community between those (including civil-rights activists) who perceive themselves as \"normal\" and who wish to be seen as ordinary members of society and those who see themselves as separate, confrontational and/or not part of the ordinary social order [9]\nOther LGBT people disapprove of reclaiming or using queer because they consider it offensive, in part due to its continued use as a pejorative [8] Some LGBT people avoid queer because they perceive it as faddish slang, or alternatively as academic jargon [10]\n\n\nScope\nScholars and activists have proposed different ways in which queer identities apply or do not apply to intersex people Sociologist Morgan Holmes and bioethicists Morgan Carpenter and Katrina Karkazis have documenting a heteronormativity in medical rationales for the surgical normalization of infants and children born with atypical sex development, and Holmes and Carpenter have described intersex bodies as queer bodies [31] [32] [33] [34] In \"What Can Queer Theory Do for Intersex?\" Iain Morland contrasts queer \"hedonic activism\" with an experience of insensate post-surgical intersex bodies to claim that \"queerness is characterized by the sensory interrelation of pleasure and shame\" [35]\n\n\nIntersex and queer identities\nScholars and activists

\"queerness is characterized by the sensory interrelation of pleasure and shame\" [35]\n\n\nQueer heterosexuality\nQueer is sometimes expanded to include any non-normative sexuality, [37] including (cisgender) \"queer heterosexuality\" This has been criticized by some LGBTQ people, who argue that queer can only be reclaimed by those it has been used to oppress: \"A straight person identifying as queer can feel like choosing to appropriate the good bits, the cultural and political cachet, the clothes and the sound of gay culture, without .. the internalized homophobia of lived gay experience.\" [38] Many queer people believe that \"you don't have to identify as queer if you're on the LGBTQIA+ spectrum, but you do have to be on the LGBTQIA+ spectrum to identify as queer.\"

meanings and connotations that have evolved over time. Originally, it referred to something strange, odd, or peculiar, but it has also been used to describe individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (LGBTQ+). In this article, we will explore the origins and evolution of the term \"queer,\" its early use as a pejorative, its reclamation by the LGBTQ+ community, and its current usage in various contexts.\n\n**Origins and Early Use**\n\nEntering the English language in the 16th century, \"queer\" originally meant \"strange,\" \"odd,\" \"peculiar,\" or \"eccentric.\" It might refer to something suspicious or \"not quite right,\" or to a person with mild derangement or who exhibits socially inappropriate behavior. The Northern English expression \"there's nowt so queer as folk,\" meaning \"there is nothing as strange as people,\" employs this meaning. Related meanings of \"queer\" include a feeling of unwellness or something that is questionable or suspicious.\n\n**Early Pejorative Use**\n\nBy the late 19th century, \"queer\" began to gain a connotation of sexual deviance, used to refer to feminine men or men who were thought to have engaged in same-sex relationships. An early recorded usage of the word in this sense was in an 1894 letter by John Sholto Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry, as read aloud at the trial of Oscar Wilde.\n\n**Early 20th-Century Queer Identity**\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, \"queer,\" \"fairy,\" \"trade,\" and \"gay\" signified distinct social categories within the gay male subculture. Many queer-identified men at the time were stereotypically masculine and \"repelled by the style of the fairy and his loss of manly status, and almost all were careful to distinguish themselves from such men.\" Trade referred to straight men who would engage in same-sex activity.\n\n**Reclamation**\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, the label \"queer\" began to be reclaimed from its pejorative use as a neutral or positive self-identifier by LGBT people. An early example of this usage was by an LGBT organisation called Queer Nation, which was formed in March 1990 and circulated an anonymous flier at the New York Gay Pride Parade in June 1990 titled \"Queers Read This.\" The flier included a passage explaining their adoption of the label queer.\n\n**General**\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, the label \"queer\" began to be reclaimed from its pejorative use as a neutral or positive self-identifier by LGBT people.

Some LGBT people dislike the use of \"queer\" as an umbrella term because they associate it with political and social radicalism; they say that deliberate use of the epithet \"queer\" by political radicals has, in their view, played a role in dividing the LGBT community by political opinion, class, gender, age, and other factors.\n\n**Scope**\n\nScholars and activists have proposed different ways in which \"queer\" identities apply or do not apply to intersex people. Sociologist Morgan Holmes and bioethicists Morgan Carpenter and Katrina Karkazis have documented a heteronormativity in medical rationales for the surgical normalization of infants and children born with atypical sex development, and Holmes and Carpenter have described intersex bodies as \"queer\" bodies.\n\n**Intersex and Queer Identities**\n\nScholars and activists have proposed different ways in which \"queer\" identities apply or do not apply to intersex people.

Look Queer\", the word is taken to mean \"unwell\" [14] The expression \"in Queer Street\" is used in the United Kingdom for someone in financial trouble Over time, queer acquired a number of meanings related to sexuality and gender, from narrowly meaning \"gay or lesbian\" [15] to referring to those who are \"not heterosexual\" to referring to those who are either not heterosexual or not cisgender (those who are LGBT+) [15] [16] The term is still widely used in Hiberno-English with its original meaning as well as to provide adverbial emphasis (very, extremely) [17]\n\n\nEarly pejorative use\nBy the late 19th century, queer was beginning to gain a connotation of sexual deviance, used to refer to feminine men or men who were thought to have engaged in same-sex relationships An early recorded

identity\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, queer, fairy, trade, and gay signified distinct social categories within the gay male subculture In his book Gay New York, Chauncey noted that queer was used as a within-community identity term by men who were stereotypically masculine [24] Many queer-identified men at the time were, according to Chauncey, \"repelled by the style of the fairy and his loss of manly status, and almost all were careful to distinguish themselves from such men\", especially because the dominant straight culture did not acknowledge such distinctions Trade referred to straight men who would engage in same-sex activity; Chauncey describes trade as \"the 'normal men'  [queers] claimed to be.\" [20]\n\n\nReclamation\nBeginning in the 1980s, the label queer

has, in their view, played a role in dividing the LGBT community by political opinion, class, gender, age, and other factors Sociologist Joshua Gamson argues that the controversy about the word also marks a social and political divide in the LGBT community between those (including civil-rights activists) who perceive themselves as \"normal\" and who wish to be seen as ordinary members of society and those who see themselves as separate, confrontational and/or not part of the ordinary social order [9]\nOther LGBT people disapprove of reclaiming or using queer because they consider it offensive, in part due to its continued use as a pejorative [8] Some LGBT people avoid queer because they perceive it as faddish slang, or alternatively as academic jargon [10]\n\n\nScope\nScholars

as queer bodies [31] [32] [33] [34] In \"What Can Queer Theory Do for Intersex?\" Iain Morland contrasts queer \"hedonic activism\" with an experience of insensate post-surgical intersex bodies to

been criticized by some LGBTQ people, who argue that queer can only be reclaimed by those it has been used to oppress: \"A straight person identifying as queer can feel like choosing to appropriate the good bits, the cultural and political cachet, the clothes and the sound of gay culture, without .. the internalized homophobia of lived gay experience.\" [38] Many queer people believe that \"you

2009, the school board in La Grande, Oregon, refused to allow the play to be performed after several parents complained about the content In an open letter in the local Observer newspaper, Martin wrote:  \n\nBroadway\nInspired by Love has Come for You, Martin and Edie Brickell collaborated on his first musical, Bright Star It is set in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina in 1945–46, with flashbacks to 1923 The musical debuted on Broadway on March 24, 2016 [60] Charles Isherwood of The New York Times praised its score by Martin and Brickell writing, \"The shining achievement of the musical is its winsome country and bluegrass score, with music by Mr Martin and Ms Brickell, and lyrics by Ms Brickell...the songs — yearning ballads and square-dance romps rich with fiddle, piano, and banjo, beautifully played by a nine-person band — provide a buoyancy that keeps the momentum from stalling.\" [61] The musical went on to receive five Tony Award nominations including Best Musical Martin himself received Tony nominations for Best Book of a Musical and Best Original Score and received the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Music and the Outstanding Critics Circle Award for Best New Score He also received a Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album.\n\n\nHosting\nMartin hosted the Academy Awards solo in 2001 and 2003, and with Alec Baldwin in 2010 [67] In 2020, Martin

Thumb Medley\", and played the track on his 1979 concert tour His final comedy album, The Steve Martin Brothers (1981), featured one side of Martin's typical stand-up material, with the other side featuring live performances of Steve playing banjo with a bluegrass band.\n\n\nBanjo music\nMartin first picked up the banjo when he was around 17 years of age Martin has stated in several interviews

Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, one of the republics of the Soviet Union [1] His family, who were ethnic Russians, had lived in this area of the Urals since at least the eighteenth century [2] His father, Nikolai Yeltsin, had married his mother, Klavdiya Vasilyevna Starygina, in 1928 [3] Yeltsin always remained closer to his mother than to his father; [4] the latter beat his wife and children on various occasions [5]\n\n\n1931–1948: childhood and adolescence\nBoris Yeltsin was born on 1st February 1931 in the village of Butka, Talitsky District, Sverdlovsk Oblast, then in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, one of the republics of the Soviet Union [1] His family, who were ethnic Russians, had lived in this area of the Urals since at least the eighteenth century [2] His father, Nikolai Yeltsin, had married his mother, Klavdiya Vasilyevna Starygina, in 1928 [3] Yeltsin always remained closer to his mother than to his father; [4] the latter beat his wife and children on various occasions [5]\n\n\n1949–1960: university and career in construction\nIn September 1949, Yeltsin was admitted to the Ural Polytechnic Institute (UPI) in Sverdlovsk [26] He took the stream in industrial and civil engineering, which included courses in maths, physics, materials and soil science, and draftsmanship [27] He was also required to study Marxist–Leninist doctrine and choose a language course, for which he selected German, although never became adept at it [27] Tuition was free and he was provided a small stipend to live on, which he supplemented by unloading railway trucks for a small wage [28] Academically, he achieved high grades, [29] although temporarily dropped out in 1952 when afflicted with tonsillitis and rheumatic fever [30] He devoted much time to athletics, [31] and joined the UPI volleyball team [32] He avoided any involvement in political organizations while there [31] During the summer 1953 break, he traveled across the Soviet Union, touring the Volga, central Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Georgia; much of the travel was achieved by hitchhiking on freight trains [33] It was at UPI that he began a relationship with Naina Iosifovna Girina, a fellow student who would later become his wife [34] Yeltsin completed his studies in June 1955 [30]\n\n\nCPSU career\nIn March 1960, Yeltsin became a probationary member of the governing Communist Party and a full member in March 1961 [45] In his later autobiography, he stated that his original reasons for joining were \"sincere\" and rooted in a genuine belief in the party's socialist ideals [46] In other interviews he instead stated that he joined because membership was a necessity for career advancement [47] His career continued to progress during the early 1960s; in February 1962 he was promoted chief (nachal'nik) of the construction directorate [48] In June 1963, Yeltsin was reassigned to the Sverdlovsk House-Building Combine as its head engineer, [48] and in December 1965 became the combine's director [48] During this period he was largely involved in building residential housing, the expansion of which was a major priority for the government He gained a reputation within the construction industry as a hard worker who was punctual and effective and who was used to meeting the targets set forth by the state apparatus There had been plans to award him the Order of Lenin for his work, although this was scrapped after a five-story building he was constructing collapsed in March 1966 An official investigation found that Yeltsin was not culpable for the accident [49]\n\n\n1960–1975: early membership of the Communist Party\nIn March 1960, Yeltsin became a probationary member of the governing Communist Party and a full member in March 1961 [45] In his later autobiography, he stated that his original reasons for joining were \"sincere\" and rooted in a genuine belief in the party's socialist ideals [46] In other interviews he

although this was scrapped after a five-story building he was constructing collapsed in March 1966 An official investigation found that Yeltsin was not culpable for the accident [49]\n\n\n1976–1985: First Secretary of Sverdlovsk Oblast\nIn October 1976, Ryabov was promoted to a new position in Moscow He recommended that Yeltsin replace him as the First Secretary of the Party Committee in Sverdlovsk Oblast [55] Leonid Brezhnev, who then led the Soviet Union as General Secretary of the party's Central Committee, interviewed Yeltsin personally to determine his suitability and agreed with Ryabov's assessment [56] At the Central Committee's recommendation, the Sverdlovsk obkom then unanimously voted to appoint Yeltsin as its first secretary This made him one of the youngest provincial first secretaries in the RSFSR, and gave him significant power within the province [57]\n\n\n1985: relocation to Moscow to become Head of Gorkom\nGorbachev was interested in reforming the Soviet Union and, at the urging of Yegor Ligachyov, the organizational secretary of the Central Committee, soon summoned Yeltsin to meet with him as a potential ally in his efforts [74] Yeltsin had some reservations about Gorbachev as a leader, deeming him controlling and patronizing, but committed himself to the latter's project of reform [75] In April 1985, Gorbachev appointed Yeltsin head of the Construction Department of the Party's Central Committee Although it entailed moving to the capital city, Yeltsin was unhappy with what he regarded as a demotion [76] [77] There, he was issued a nomenklatura flat at 54 Second Tverskaya-Yamskaya Street, where his daughter Tatyana and her son and husband soon joined him and his wife [78] Gorbachev soon promoted Yeltsin to secretary of the Central Committee for construction and capital investment, a position within the powerful CPSU Central Committee Secretariat, a move approved by the Central Committee plenum in July 1985 [79] [80]\n\n\n1987: resignation\nOn 10 September 1987, after a lecture from hard-liner Yegor Ligachyov at the Politburo for allowing two small unsanctioned demonstrations on Moscow streets, Yeltsin wrote a letter of resignation to Gorbachev who was holidaying on the Black Sea [87] When Gorbachev received the letter he was stunned – nobody in Soviet history had voluntarily resigned from the ranks of the Politburo Gorbachev phoned Yeltsin and asked him to reconsider.\n\n\nPresident of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic\nOn 4 March 1990, Yeltsin was elected to the Congress of People's Deputies of Russia representing Sverdlovsk with 72% of the vote [96] On 29 May 1990, he was elected chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), although Gorbachev personally pleaded with the Russian deputies not to select Yeltsin [97]\n\n\n1991: presidential election\nDuring May 1991 Vaclav Havel invited Yeltsin to Prague where the latter unambiguously condemned the Soviet intervention in 1968 [99] [100]\n\n\nPresident of the Russian Federation\nJust days after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Yeltsin resolved to embark on a programme of radical economic reform Surpassing Gorbachev's reforms, which sought to expand democracy in the socialist system, the new regime aimed to completely dismantle socialism and fully implement capitalism, converting the world's largest command economy into a free-market one During early discussions of this transition, Yeltsin's advisers debated issues of speed and sequencing, with an apparent division between those favoring a rapid approach and those favoring a gradual or slower approach On January 1, 1992, Yeltsin signed accords with U.S President George H W Bush, declaring the Cold War officially over after nearly 47 years [citation needed] A visit to Moscow from Havel in April 1992 occasioned the written repudiation of the Soviet intervention and the withdrawal of armed forces from Czechoslovakia [100] Yeltsin laid a wreath during a November 1992 ceremony in Budapest, apologized for the 1956 Soviet intervention in Hungary and handed over to president Árpád Göncz documents from the Communist Party and KGB archives related to the intervention [100] A treaty of friendship was signed in May 1992 with Lech Wałęsa's Poland, and then another one in August 1992 with Zhelyu Zhelev's Bulgaria [100]\n\n\n1991–1996: first term\nJust days after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Yeltsin resolved to embark on a programme of radical economic reform Surpassing

friendship was signed in May 1992 with Lech Wałęsa's Poland, and then another one in August 1992 with Zhelyu Zhelev's Bulgaria [100]\n\n\nConfrontation with parliament\nThroughout 1992 Yeltsin wrestled with the Supreme Soviet of Russia and the Congress of People's Deputies for control over government, government policy, government banking, and property In 1992, the speaker of the Russian Supreme Soviet, Ruslan Khasbulatov, came out in opposition to the reforms, despite claiming to support Yeltsin's overall goals In December 1992, the 7th Congress of People's Deputies succeeded in turning down the Yeltsin-backed candidacy of Yegor Gaidar for the position of Russian Prime Minister An agreement was brokered by Valery Zorkin, president of the Constitutional Court, which included the following provisions: a national referendum on the new constitution; parliament and Yeltsin would choose a new head of government, to be confirmed by the Supreme Soviet; and the parliament was to cease making constitutional amendments that change the balance of power between the legislative and executive branches Eventually, on 14 December, Viktor Chernomyrdin, widely seen as a compromise figure, was confirmed in the office.\n\n\nRelations with NATO\nThe US Department of State seemed to confuse Yeltsin over German re-unification and dismemberment of the Helsinki Final Act and ensuing Partnership for Peace (PfP) push for NATO expansion There is some question as to the involvement of his Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrei Kozyrev, who in August 1993 was painted by Lech Wałęsa as a saboteur of Polish aspirations for NATO membership but was regarded by domestic opponents as suborned by the United States [100] In Yeltsin's letter to Bill Clinton dated 15 September 1993 he strongly favored \"a pan-European security system\" instead of NATO and warned: [116]\n\n\nChechnya\nIn December 1994, Yeltsin ordered the military invasion of Chechnya in an attempt to restore Moscow's control over the republic Nearly two years later, Yeltsin withdrew federal forces from the devastated Chechnya under a 1996 peace agreement brokered by Alexander Lebed, Yeltsin's then-security chief The peace deal allowed Chechnya greater autonomy but not full independence The decision to launch the war in Chechnya dismayed many in the West Time magazine wrote:\n\n\nNorwegian rocket incident\nIn 1995, a Black Brant sounding rocket launched from the Andøya Space Center caused a high alert in Russia, known as the Norwegian rocket incident The Russians were alerted that it might be a nuclear missile launched from an American submarine The incident occurred in the post-Cold War era, where many Russians were still very suspicious of the United States and NATO [118] A full alert was passed up through the military chain of command to Yeltsin, who was notified and the \"nuclear briefcase\" (known in Russia as Cheget) used to authorize nuclear launch was automatically activated Russian satellites indicated that no massive attack was underway and he agreed with advisors that it was a false alarm [119]\n\n\nPrivatization and the rise of \"the oligarchs\"\nFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Yeltsin promoted privatization as a way of spreading ownership of shares in former state enterprises as widely as possible to create political support for his economic reforms In the West, privatization was viewed as the key to the transition from Communism in Eastern Europe, ensuring a quick dismantling of the Soviet-era command economy to make way for \"free market reforms\" In the early 1990s, Anatoly Chubais, Yeltsin's deputy for economic policy, emerged as a leading advocate of privatization in Russia.\n\n\nKorean Air Lines Flight 007\nOn 5 December 1991, Senator Jesse Helms, ranking member of the Minority on the U.S Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, wrote to Yeltsin concerning U.S servicemen who were POWs or MIAs: \"The status of thousands and thousands of American servicemen who are held by Soviet and other Communist forces, and who were never repatriated after every major war this century, is of grave concern to the American people.\" [122]\n\n\n1996 presidential election\nIn February 1996, Yeltsin announced that he would seek a second term in the 1996 Russian presidential election in the summer The announcement followed weeks of speculation that Yeltsin was at the end of his political career because of his health problems and growing unpopularity in Russia At the time, Yeltsin was recuperating from a series of heart attacks Domestic and international observers also noted his occasionally erratic behavior When campaigning began in early 1996, Yeltsin's popularity was close to being non-existent [126] Meanwhile, the opposition Communist Party had already gained ground in parliamentary voting on 17 December 1995, and its candidate, Gennady Zyuganov, had a strong grassroots organization, especially in the rural areas and small towns, and appealed effectively to memories of the old days of Soviet prestige on the international stage and the domestic order under state socialism [127]\n\n\n1996–1999: Second term\nYeltsin underwent emergency quintuple heart bypass surgery in November 1996, and remained in the hospital for months During his presidency, Russia received US$40 billion in funds from the International Monetary Fund and other international lending organizations However, his opponents allege that most of these funds were stolen by people from Yeltsin's circle and placed into foreign banks [137] [138]\n\n\nAttempted 1999 impeachment\nOn 15 May 1999, Yeltsin survived another impeachment attempt, this time by the democratic and communist opposition in the State Duma He was charged with several unconstitutional activities, including the signing of the Belovezha Accords dissolving the Soviet Union in December 1991, the coup-d'état in October 1993, and initiating the war in Chechnya in 1994 None of these charges received the two-thirds majority of the Duma required to initiate the process of impeachment [145] [146]\n\n\nMabetex corruption\nWith Pavel Borodin as the Kremlin property manager, Swiss construction firm Mabetex was awarded many important Russian government contracts They were awarded the contracts to reconstruct, renovate and refurbish the former Russian Federation Parliament, the Russian Opera House, State Duma and the Moscow Kremlin.\n\n\nResignation\nOn 31 December 1999, during a televised New Year address, Yeltsin issued his resignation [149] In the speech, he praised the advances in cultural, political, and economic freedom that his administration had overseen although apologized to Russia's people for \"not making many of your and my dreams come true What seemed simple to do proved to be excruciatingly difficult.\" [150] [151]\n\n\nElectoral history\nYeltsin suffered from heart disease during his first term as president of the Russian Federation, probably continuing for the rest of his life He is known to have suffered heart problems in March 1990, just after being elected as a member of parliament [153] It was common knowledge that, in early 1996, he was recuperating from a series of heart attacks and, soon after, he spent months in hospital recovering from a quintuple bypass operation (see above).\n\n\nHeart disease and alcoholism\nYeltsin suffered from heart disease during his first term as president of the Russian Federation, probably continuing for the rest of his life He is known to have suffered heart problems in March 1990, just after being elected as a member of parliament [153] It was common knowledge that, in early 1996, he was recuperating from a series of heart attacks and, soon after, he spent months in hospital recovering from a quintuple bypass operation (see above).\n\n\nLife after resignation\nYeltsin maintained a low profile after his resignation, making almost no public statements or appearances He criticized his successor Putin in December 2000 for supporting the reintroduction of the tune of the Soviet-era national anthem, albeit with different lyrics [163] In January 2001 he was hospitalized for six weeks with pneumonia resulting from a viral infection [164] On 13 September 2004, following the Beslan school hostage crisis and nearly concurrent terrorist attacks in Moscow, Putin launched an initiative to replace the election of regional governors with a system whereby they would be directly appointed by the president and approved by regional legislatures Yeltsin, together with Mikhail Gorbachev, publicly criticized Putin's plan as a step away from democracy in Russia and a return to the centrally-run political apparatus of the Soviet era [165]\n\n\nDeath and funeral\nYeltsin died of congestive heart failure [167] [168] on 23 April 2007, aged 76 [169] [170] According to experts quoted by Komsomolskaya Pravda, the onset of Yeltsin's condition began during his visit to Jordan between 25 March and 2 April [167] He was buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery on 25 April 2007, [171] following a period during which his body had lain in repose in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow [172]\n\n\nIdeology\nDuring the late Soviet period, Yeltsin's ideological worldview began to shift [59] Colton argued that populism and \"a non-ethnic Russianism\" had begun to enter Yeltsin's thinking while he was First Secretary of Sverdlovsk [177] In the late 1980s, Yeltsin told the Athens daily newspaper Kathimerini that \"I regard myself as a social democrat\", despite his economic privatisation programs, adding: \"Those who still believe in communism are moving in the sphere of fantasy.\" [178]\n\n\nPersonal life\nColton described Yeltsin as a man who \"teemed with inner complexities\", [185] who exhibited both a \"mathematical cast of mind\" and a \"taste for adventure\", [186] noting that Yeltsin had \"the intuition for grasping a situation holistically\" [187] Colton thought Yeltsin could be bullheaded, [188] and restless [12] Evans noted that in Yeltsin's autobiography, the leader appeared to view himself as more of a Soviet person than a Russian [182] Throughout his life, Yeltsin sustained a number of health problems which he would usually try to conceal [189] As a child, he sustained both a broken nose and a maimed hand, physical attributes he remained self-conscious about; [190] in public he would often conceal his left hand under the table or behind his tie [191] He was also deaf on the right side due to a middle-ear infection [192] Although his mother was a devout Orthodox Christian, Yeltsin did not grow up as a practitioner, only becoming so in the 1980s and 1990s [8]\n\n\nReception and

Yeltsin\n\nIntroduction\nBoris Yeltsin was a Russian politician who served as the first President of the Russian Federation from 1991 to 1999. He played a crucial role in the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the transition to a democratic government in Russia. Yeltsin's presidency was marked by significant economic and social reforms, but also by challenges and controversies. This article provides an overview of Yeltsin's life, career, and legacy.\n\nEarly Life, Education, and Early Career\nBoris Yeltsin was born on 1st February 1931 in the village of Butka, Talitsky District, Sverdlovsk Oblast, Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. His family had lived in the area since the eighteenth century. Yeltsin's father, Nikolai, was a local accountant, and his mother, Klavdiya, was a teacher. Yeltsin remained closer to his mother than his father, who was known to beat his wife and children on occasion.\n\nYeltsin attended the Ural Polytechnic Institute (UPI) in Sverdlovsk, where he studied industrial and civil engineering. He was a high achiever and was required to study Marxist-Leninist doctrine as part of his coursework. Yeltsin also took a language course in German, although he never became proficient in the language. He was known for his athleticism and was a member of the UPI volleyball team.\n\nCPSU Career\nIn March 1960, Yeltsin became a probationary member of the Communist Party and a full member in March 1961.

The incident occurred in the post-Cold War era, where many Russians were still very suspicious of the United States and NATO.\n\nPrivatization and the Rise of \"the Oligarchs\"\nFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Yeltsin promoted privatization as a way of spreading ownership of shares in former state enterprises. The privatization program was widely criticized for its lack of transparency and the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few individuals, known as \"the oligarchs\".\n\nKorean Air Lines Flight 007\nOn 5th December 1991, Senator Jesse Helms wrote to Yeltsin concerning U.S servicemen who were POWs or MIAs.\n\n1996 Presidential Election\nIn February 1996, Yeltsin announced that he would seek a second term in the 1996 Russian presidential election.

Sverdlovsk Oblast, then in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, one of the republics of the Soviet Union [1] His family, who were ethnic Russians, had lived in this area of the Urals since at least the eighteenth century [2] His father, Nikolai Yeltsin, had married his mother, Klavdiya Vasilyevna Starygina, in 1928 [3] Yeltsin always remained closer to his mother than to his father; [4] the latter beat his wife and children on various occasions [5]\n\n\n1931–1948: childhood and adolescence\nBoris Yeltsin was born on 1st February 1931 in the village of Butka, Talitsky

father; [4] the latter beat his wife and children on various occasions [5]\n\n\n1949–1960: university and career in construction\nIn September 1949, Yeltsin was admitted to the Ural Polytechnic Institute (UPI) in Sverdlovsk [26] He took the stream in industrial and civil engineering, which included courses in maths, physics, materials and soil science, and draftsmanship [27] He was also required to study Marxist–Leninist doctrine and choose a language course, for which he selected German, although never became adept at it [27] Tuition was free and he was provided a small stipend to live on, which he supplemented by unloading railway trucks for a small wage [28] Academically, he achieved high grades, [29] although temporarily dropped out in 1952 when afflicted with tonsillitis and rheumatic fever [30] He devoted much time to athletics, [31] and joined the UPI volleyball team [32] He avoided any involvement in political organizations while there [31] During the summer 1953 break, he traveled across the Soviet Union, touring the Volga, central Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Georgia; much of the travel was achieved by hitchhiking on freight trains [33] It was at UPI that he began a relationship with Naina Iosifovna Girina, a fellow student who would later become his wife [34] Yeltsin completed his studies in June 1955 [30]\n\n\nCPSU career\nIn March 1960, Yeltsin became a probationary member of the governing Communist Party and a full member in March 1961 [45] In his later autobiography, he stated that his original reasons for joining were \"sincere\" and rooted in a genuine belief in the party's socialist ideals [46] In other interviews he instead stated that he joined because membership was a necessity for career advancement [47] His career continued to progress during the early 1960s; in February 1962 he was promoted chief (nachal'nik) of the construction directorate [48] In June 1963, Yeltsin was reassigned to the Sverdlovsk House-Building Combine as its head engineer, [48] and in December 1965 became the combine's director [48] During this period he was largely involved in building residential housing, the expansion of which was a major priority for the government He gained a reputation within the construction industry as a hard worker who was punctual and effective and who was used to meeting the targets set forth by the state apparatus There had been plans to award him the Order of Lenin for his work, although this was scrapped after a five-story building he was constructing collapsed in March 1966 An official investigation found that Yeltsin was not culpable for the accident [49]\n\n\n1960–1975: early membership of the Communist Party\nIn March 1960, Yeltsin became a probationary member of the governing Communist Party and a full member in March 1961 [45] In his later autobiography, he stated that his original reasons for joining were \"sincere\" and rooted in a genuine belief in the party's socialist ideals [46] In other interviews he instead stated that he joined because membership was a necessity for career advancement [47] His career continued to progress during the early 1960s; in

the accident [49]\n\n\n1976–1985: First Secretary of Sverdlovsk Oblast\nIn October 1976, Ryabov was promoted to a new position in Moscow He recommended that Yeltsin replace him as the First Secretary of the Party Committee in Sverdlovsk Oblast [55] Leonid Brezhnev, who then led the Soviet Union as General Secretary of the party's Central Committee, interviewed Yeltsin personally to determine his suitability and agreed with Ryabov's assessment [56] At the Central Committee's recommendation, the Sverdlovsk obkom then unanimously voted to appoint Yeltsin as its first secretary This made him one of the youngest provincial first secretaries in the RSFSR, and gave him significant power within the province [57]\n\n\n1985: relocation to Moscow to become Head of Gorkom\nGorbachev was interested in reforming the Soviet Union and, at the urging of Yegor Ligachyov, the organizational secretary of the Central Committee, soon summoned Yeltsin to meet with him as a potential ally in his efforts [74] Yeltsin had some reservations about Gorbachev as a leader, deeming him controlling and patronizing, but committed himself to the latter's project of reform [75] In April 1985, Gorbachev appointed Yeltsin head of the Construction Department of the Party's Central Committee Although it entailed moving to the capital city, Yeltsin was unhappy with what he regarded as a demotion [76] [77] There, he was issued a nomenklatura flat at 54 Second Tverskaya-Yamskaya Street, where his daughter Tatyana and her son and husband soon joined him and his wife [78] Gorbachev soon promoted Yeltsin to secretary of the Central Committee for construction and capital investment, a position within the powerful CPSU Central Committee Secretariat, a move approved by the Central Committee plenum in July 1985 [79] [80]\n\n\n1987: resignation\nOn 10 September 1987, after a lecture from hard-liner Yegor Ligachyov at the Politburo for allowing two small unsanctioned demonstrations on Moscow streets, Yeltsin wrote a letter of resignation to Gorbachev who was holidaying on the Black Sea [87] When Gorbachev received the letter he was stunned – nobody in Soviet history had voluntarily resigned from the ranks of the Politburo Gorbachev phoned Yeltsin and asked him to reconsider.\n\n\nPresident of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic\nOn 4 March 1990, Yeltsin was elected to the Congress of People's Deputies of Russia representing Sverdlovsk with 72% of the vote [96] On 29 May 1990, he was elected chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), although Gorbachev personally pleaded with the Russian deputies not to select Yeltsin [97]\n\n\n1991: presidential election\nDuring May 1991 Vaclav Havel invited Yeltsin to Prague where the latter unambiguously condemned the Soviet intervention in 1968 [99] [100]\n\n\nPresident of the Russian Federation\nJust days after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Yeltsin resolved to embark on a programme of radical economic reform Surpassing Gorbachev's reforms, which sought to expand democracy in the socialist system, the new regime aimed to completely dismantle socialism and fully implement capitalism, converting the world's largest command economy into a free-market one During early discussions of this transition, Yeltsin's advisers debated issues of speed and sequencing, with an apparent division between those favoring a rapid approach and those favoring a gradual or slower approach On January 1, 1992, Yeltsin signed accords with U.S President George H W Bush, declaring the Cold War officially over after nearly 47 years [citation needed] A visit to Moscow from Havel in April 1992 occasioned the written repudiation of the Soviet intervention and the withdrawal of armed forces from Czechoslovakia [100] Yeltsin laid a wreath during a November 1992 ceremony in Budapest, apologized for the 1956 Soviet intervention in Hungary and handed over to president Árpád Göncz documents from the Communist Party and KGB archives related to the intervention [100] A treaty of friendship was signed in May 1992 with Lech Wałęsa's Poland, and then another one in August 1992 with Zhelyu Zhelev's Bulgaria [100]\n\n\n1991–1996: first term\nJust days after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Yeltsin resolved to embark on a programme of radical economic

wrestled with the Supreme Soviet of Russia and the Congress of People's Deputies for control over government, government policy, government banking, and property In 1992, the speaker of the Russian Supreme Soviet, Ruslan Khasbulatov, came out in opposition to the reforms, despite claiming to support Yeltsin's overall goals In December 1992, the 7th Congress of People's Deputies succeeded in turning down the Yeltsin-backed candidacy of Yegor Gaidar for the position of Russian Prime Minister An agreement was brokered by Valery Zorkin, president of the Constitutional Court, which included the following provisions: a national referendum on the new constitution; parliament and Yeltsin would choose a new head of government, to be confirmed by the Supreme Soviet; and the parliament was to cease making constitutional amendments that change the balance of power between the legislative and executive branches Eventually, on 14 December, Viktor Chernomyrdin, widely seen as a compromise figure, was confirmed in the office.\n\n\nRelations with NATO\nThe US Department of State seemed to confuse Yeltsin over German re-unification and dismemberment of the Helsinki Final Act and ensuing Partnership for Peace (PfP) push for NATO expansion There is some question as to the involvement of his Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrei Kozyrev, who in August 1993 was painted by Lech Wałęsa as a saboteur of Polish aspirations for NATO membership but was regarded by domestic opponents as suborned by the United States [100] In Yeltsin's letter to Bill Clinton dated 15 September 1993 he strongly favored \"a pan-European security system\" instead of NATO and warned: [116]\n\n\nChechnya\nIn December 1994, Yeltsin ordered the military invasion of Chechnya in an attempt to restore Moscow's control over the republic Nearly two years later, Yeltsin withdrew federal forces from the devastated Chechnya under a 1996 peace agreement brokered by Alexander Lebed, Yeltsin's then-security chief The peace deal allowed Chechnya greater autonomy but not full independence The decision to launch the war in Chechnya dismayed many in the West Time magazine wrote:\n\n\nNorwegian rocket incident\nIn 1995, a Black Brant sounding rocket launched from the Andøya Space Center caused a high alert in Russia, known as the Norwegian rocket incident The Russians were alerted that it might be a nuclear missile launched from an American submarine The incident occurred in the post-Cold War era, where many Russians were still very suspicious of the United States and NATO [118] A full alert was passed up through the military chain of command to Yeltsin, who was notified and the \"nuclear briefcase\" (known in Russia as Cheget) used to authorize nuclear launch was automatically activated Russian satellites indicated that no massive attack was underway and he agreed with advisors that it was a false alarm [119]\n\n\nPrivatization and the rise of \"the oligarchs\"\nFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Yeltsin promoted privatization as a way of spreading ownership of shares in former state enterprises as widely as possible to create political support for his economic reforms In the West, privatization was viewed as the key to the transition from Communism in Eastern Europe, ensuring a quick dismantling of the Soviet-era command economy to make way for \"free market reforms\" In the early 1990s, Anatoly Chubais, Yeltsin's deputy for economic policy, emerged as a leading advocate of privatization in Russia.\n\n\nKorean Air Lines Flight 007\nOn 5 December 1991, Senator Jesse Helms, ranking member of the Minority on the U.S Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, wrote to Yeltsin concerning U.S servicemen who were POWs or MIAs: \"The status of thousands and thousands of American servicemen who are held by Soviet and other Communist forces, and who were never repatriated after every major war this century, is of grave concern to the American people.\" [122]\n\n\n1996 presidential election\nIn February 1996, Yeltsin announced that he would seek a second term in the 1996 Russian presidential election in the summer The announcement followed weeks of speculation that Yeltsin was at the end of his political career because of his health problems and growing unpopularity in Russia At the time, Yeltsin was recuperating from a series of heart attacks Domestic and international observers also noted his occasionally erratic behavior When campaigning began in early 1996, Yeltsin's popularity was close to being non-existent [126] Meanwhile, the opposition Communist Party had already gained ground in parliamentary voting on 17 December 1995, and its candidate, Gennady Zyuganov, had a strong grassroots organization, especially in the rural areas and small towns, and appealed effectively to memories of the old days of Soviet prestige on the international stage and the domestic order under state socialism [127]\n\n\n1996–1999: Second term\nYeltsin underwent emergency quintuple heart bypass surgery in November 1996, and remained in the hospital for months During his presidency, Russia received US$40 billion in funds from the International Monetary Fund and other international lending organizations However, his opponents allege that most of these funds were stolen by people from Yeltsin's circle and placed into foreign banks [137] [138]\n\n\nAttempted 1999 impeachment\nOn 15 May 1999, Yeltsin survived another impeachment attempt, this time by the democratic and communist opposition in the State Duma He was charged with several unconstitutional activities, including the signing of the Belovezha Accords dissolving the Soviet Union in December 1991, the coup-d'état in October 1993, and initiating the war in Chechnya in 1994 None of these charges received the two-thirds majority of the Duma required to initiate the process of impeachment [145] [146]\n\n\nMabetex corruption\nWith Pavel Borodin as the Kremlin property manager, Swiss construction firm Mabetex was awarded many important Russian government contracts They were awarded the contracts to reconstruct, renovate and refurbish the former Russian Federation Parliament, the Russian Opera House, State Duma and the Moscow Kremlin.\n\n\nResignation\nOn 31 December 1999, during a televised New Year address, Yeltsin issued his resignation [149] In the speech, he praised the advances in cultural, political, and economic freedom that his administration had overseen although apologized to Russia's people for \"not making many of your and my dreams come true What seemed simple to do proved to be excruciatingly difficult.\" [150] [151]\n\n\nElectoral history\nYeltsin suffered from heart disease during his first term as president of the Russian Federation, probably continuing for the rest of his life He is known to have suffered heart problems in March 1990, just after being elected as a member of parliament [153] It was common knowledge that, in early 1996, he was recuperating from a series of heart attacks and, soon after, he spent months in hospital recovering from a quintuple bypass operation (see above).\n\n\nHeart disease and alcoholism\nYeltsin suffered from heart disease during his first term as president of the Russian Federation, probably continuing for the rest of his life He is known to have suffered heart problems in March 1990, just after being elected as a member of parliament [153] It was common knowledge that, in early 1996, he was recuperating from a series of heart attacks and, soon after, he spent months in hospital recovering from a quintuple bypass operation (see above).\n\n\nLife after resignation\nYeltsin maintained a low profile after his resignation, making almost no public statements or appearances He criticized his successor Putin in December 2000 for supporting the reintroduction of the tune of the Soviet-era national anthem, albeit with different lyrics [163] In January 2001 he was hospitalized for six weeks with pneumonia resulting from a viral infection [164] On 13 September 2004, following the Beslan school hostage crisis and nearly concurrent terrorist attacks in Moscow, Putin launched an initiative to replace the election of regional governors with a system whereby they would be directly appointed by the president and approved by regional legislatures Yeltsin, together with Mikhail Gorbachev, publicly criticized Putin's plan as a step away from democracy in Russia and a return to the centrally-run political apparatus of the Soviet era [165]\n\n\nDeath and funeral\nYeltsin died of congestive heart failure [167] [168] on 23 April 2007, aged 76 [169] [170] According to experts quoted by Komsomolskaya Pravda, the onset of Yeltsin's condition began during his visit to Jordan between 25 March and 2 April [167] He was buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery on 25 April 2007, [171] following a period during which his body had lain in repose in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow [172]\n\n\nIdeology\nDuring the late Soviet period, Yeltsin's ideological worldview began to shift [59] Colton argued that populism and \"a non-ethnic Russianism\" had begun to enter Yeltsin's thinking while he was First Secretary of Sverdlovsk [177] In the late 1980s, Yeltsin told the Athens daily newspaper Kathimerini that \"I regard myself as a social democrat\", despite his economic privatisation programs, adding: \"Those who still believe in communism are moving in the sphere of fantasy.\" [178]\n\n\nPersonal life\nColton described Yeltsin as a man who \"teemed with inner complexities\", [185] who exhibited both a \"mathematical cast of mind\" and a \"taste for adventure\", [186] noting that Yeltsin had \"the intuition for grasping a situation holistically\" [187] Colton thought Yeltsin could be bullheaded, [188] and restless [12] Evans noted that in Yeltsin's autobiography, the leader appeared to view himself as more of a Soviet person than a Russian [182] Throughout his life, Yeltsin sustained a number of health problems which he would usually try to conceal [189] As a child, he sustained both a broken nose and a maimed hand, physical attributes he remained self-conscious about; [190] in public he would often conceal his left hand under the table or behind his tie [191] He was also deaf on the right side due to a middle-ear infection [192] Although his mother was a devout Orthodox Christian, Yeltsin did not grow up as a practitioner, only becoming so in the 1980s and 1990s [8]\n\n\nReception and

The event was created in 1987 as a response to the success of the National Wrestling Alliance's (NWA) Starrcade and the World Wrestling Federation's (WWF) own pay-per-view success.\n\n**Origins and Changes**\n\nThe first Survivor Series, held in 1987, came on the heels of the success of WrestleMania III, as the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) began to see the lucrative potential of the pay-per-view (PPV) market. The first event capitalized on the big time feud between André the Giant and Hulk Hogan, who wrestled each other at WrestleMania III. Survivor Series was originally created to counter WCW's Starrcade. The first eight Survivor Series events took place on either Thanksgiving Day (1987–1990) or Thanksgiving Eve (1991–1994). Beginning with the 1995 event, Survivor Series was held on various Sundays before Thanksgiving. The 2005 and 2006 events were held on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, while the 2022 and 2023 events were held on the Saturday after Thanksgiving.\n\nThe 1997 event was notorious as it featured the Montreal Screwjob. Survivor Series was going to be discontinued and rebranded in 2010, but following fan outcry, the company decided to continue with the event. Survivor Series became the second longest running PPV event in history (behind WrestleMania), and is also regarded as one of the \"Big Four\" pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam, the promotion's original four annual events and their four biggest events of the year. From 1993 to 2002, it was considered one of the \"Big Five\", including King of the Ring, but that PPV event was discontinued after 2002. In August 2021, Money in the Bank became recognized as one of the \"Big Five\".\n\n**Brand Competition (2016–2021)**\n\nDuring the first brand extension period (2002–2011), there were only a few Survivor Series matches that were held between wrestlers of the two brands (e.g., Team Raw vs Team SmackDown), but it was not the focus of the event. However, with the return of the brand split in 2016, Survivor Series took on the theme of direct competition between the Raw and SmackDown brands for brand supremacy, similar to the former Bragging Rights events held during the first brand split in 2009 and 2010. In addition to traditional Survivor Series matches pitting the men and women from the two brands against each other (2016 and 2018 also featured matches with the brands' tag teams going against each other), there were interpromotional matches that featured the brands' champions against each other in non-title matches (e.g., the Raw Women's Champion vs the SmackDown Women's Champion).\n\n**WarGames (2022–present)**\n\nOn September 19, 2022, WWE executive Triple H announced that the 2022 Survivor Series would not be based on the brand supremacy concept. Additionally, he announced that the event would feature two WarGames matches, one each for the men and women, marking the first time for a main roster WWE event to feature the match. The 2022 event was in turn renamed as Survivor Series: WarGames, and it was also the first Survivor Series held on a Saturday. The NXT brand previously held an annual WarGames event from 2017 to 2021. With the WarGames match moving to the main roster for Survivor Series, this subsequently ended NXT's WarGames event, which was replaced by Deadline.\n\n**Survivor Series Match**\n\nThe event is traditionally characterized by having the Survivor Series match, which is a type of tag team elimination match that typically features two teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. In a Survivor Series match, each member of a team must be eliminated to win. The name of the match stems from this stipulation, as the winners are the \"survivors\", and in some cases, there has been only one survivor. There have sometimes been an additional stipulation placed on the Survivor Series match, such as members of the losing team being (kayfabe) fired. While typically contested between two teams, the 2019 event had three teams against each other in three-way Survivor Series matches.\n\n**Events**\n\nThe Survivor Series has been held annually since 1987, with the exception of the years 1990, 1991, 1993, 1997 (held on December 14), 2002, 2003, 2008, 2020, and 2021. Some notable events include:\n\n* Survivor Series (1987): André the Giant and Hulk Hogan faced each other in a main event match.\n* Survivor Series (1990): The event was held on Thanksgiving Day and featured a match between the WWF and NWA teams.\n* Survivor Series (1991): The event was held on Thanksgiving Eve and featured a match between the WWF and WCW teams.\n* Survivor Series (1995): The event was held on a Sunday before Thanksgiving and featured a match between the WWF and WCW teams.\n* Survivor Series (1997): The event featured the Montreal Screwjob.\n* Survivor Series (2003): The

Falcon, CrowdStrike's Endpoint detection and response agent, works at the operating system kernel level on individual computers to detect and prevent threats [11] Patches are routinely distributed by CrowdStrike to its clients to enable their computers to address new threats [12]\n\n\nOutage\nOn 19 July at 04:09 UTC, CrowdStrike distributed a faulty configuration update for its Falcon sensor software running on Windows PCs and servers A modification to a configuration file which was responsible for screening named pipes, Channel File 291, caused an out-of-bounds memory read [14] in the Windows sensor client that resulted in an invalid page fault The update caused machines to either enter into a bootloop or boot into recovery mode [15] [16]\n\n\nRemedy\nAffected machines could be restored by rebooting while connected to the network; ideally while connected to Ethernet, thus providing the opportunity to download the reverted channel file, with multiple reboots reportedly required [31] [23]\n\n\nImpact\nOutages were experienced worldwide, [2] [39] [40] reflecting the wide use of Microsoft Windows and CrowdStrike software by global corporations in numerous business

United States due to the outage [65] American Airlines, United, and Allegiant recovered relatively quickly after Friday [116] [117]\n\n\nFinance\nMicrosoft and CrowdStrike stocks fell as a result of the outage CrowdStrike's stock fell more than 11% on 19 July, although Microsoft stock was down less than 1% [141] [5]\n\n\nGovernment\nThe United States Department of Homeland Security, NASA, Federal

majority of  [English] GP practices\", [27] with some of its services, such as GP surgeries, which rely on a software product called EMIS Web, unable to view and manage medical records, issue and manage prescriptions, or make appointments [53] Manx Radio reported that GP surgeries were affected in the Isle of Man [208] The London Ambulance Service experienced an unprecedented surge [53] in 999 and 111 calls following the outage, responding to 4,500 emergency calls by 17:00 (BST) [209]\n\n\nMedia and communications\nNumerous American TV stations were unable to broadcast because of the global outage KSHB-TV, one of the affected stations, had to resort to airing national news via Scripps News [65] ESPN was unable to air the morning editions of SportsCenter on the morning of the outage in America, instead airing ESPN Radio's Unsportsmanlike, simulcasting with ESPN2 [216] [self-published source?] ESPN and ESPN2 later simulcasted Get Up! and First Take in place of SportsCenter, albeit without on-air graphics or b-roll [217] [218] Various Paramount channels were also affected including Nicktoons (with its West Coast feed switching to an old emergency feed), TeenNick, BET Her,

to the public He said company leaders were \"deeply sorry for the impact that we've caused to customers, to travelers, to anyone affected by this, including our companies\" [251] CrowdStrike warned that malicious actors might try to pose as its staff or independent researchers claiming to help fix the problem [252]\n\n\nPolitical\nThe Australian government held a national emergency meeting to address the outage The National Coordination Mechanism was activated; Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said, \"I understand Australians are concerned about the outage that is unfolding globally and affecting a wide range of services My Government is working closely with the National Cyber Security Coordinator\" [60] [258] He later said, \"There is no impact to critical infrastructure, government services, or Triple-0 services at this stage\" [259] Victorians were advised to call Triple-0 if a fire alarm sounds or smoke is detected, as some automatic alarms in buildings may not automatically call fire services due to the outage [5]\n\n\nIndustry\nCybersecurity consultant Troy Hunt called the incident the \"largest IT outage in history\", adding: \"This is basically what we were all worried about with Y2K, except it's actually happened this time\" [264] [265] Slate described it as \"Y2K Lite\" [266]\n\n\nCriminal\nGovernments worldwide and cybersecurity agencies warned of digital phishing scams after the incident Cyber criminals started sending phishing emails purporting to be CrowdStrike support and impersonating CrowdStrike staff in phone calls shortly afterward [274] [275] [276]\n\n\nAnalysis\nThe 19 July update was an instance of a template that was tested and released in March 2024 as part of an update to the Falcon Sensor software This new instance, Channel File 291, passed validation due to a bug in CrowdStrike's content verification software [277] [14] The Falcon Sensor itself parses the file differently in a way that led to a software crash in kernel mode.\n\n\nCause\nThe 19 July update was an instance of a template that was tested and released in March 2024 as part of an update to the Falcon Sensor software This new instance, Channel File 291, passed validation due to a bug in CrowdStrike's content verification software [277] [14] The Falcon Sensor itself parses the file differently in a way that led to a software crash in kernel mode.\n\n\nCentralisation and homogeneity\nThe outage raised questions about oligopoly and centralisation in the information technology sector [278] [279] The majority of the world's computers use Microsoft Windows, creating a monoculture that reduces resiliency [139] [279] Ciaran Martin, a cybersecurity expert, said, \"This is a very, very uncomfortable illustration of the fragility of the world's core internet infrastructure\" [139] Critical infrastructure expert Gregory Falco said, \"Cybersecurity providers are part of this homogenous backbone of modern systems and are so core to how we operate that a glitch in their operations will have similar impacts to failures in systems that are household names\" [280] Security experts suggested more redundancy to avoid single points of failure, [278] wider use of decentralised and heterogeneous federated systems, [279] and public anger at the failure of political leaders to regulate for diversity and competition [139] Conversely, cybersecurity expert Andrew Plato argued that monocultures are a net positive, “from a security perspective, there’s actually a lot of benefits to running a smaller, standardized set of software, because it allows you to spot a problem quicker and easier.\" [281]\n\n\nIT practices\nExperts speculate that the update was not put through routine patch management procedures (testing the update in a sandbox) to verify there were no problems [282]\n\n\nOperating system design and antitrust enforcement\nMicrosoft blamed a 2009 antitrust agreement with the European Union that they said forced them to sustain low-level kernel access to third-party developers [285] [286] [287] The document does not explicitly state that Microsoft has to provide kernel-level access, but says Microsoft must provide access to the same APIs used by its own security products [286] The EU rejected the allegations The European Commission spokesperson told Euronews that \"Microsoft is free to decide on its business model It is for Microsoft to adapt its security infrastructure to respond to threats in line with EU competition law Additionally, consumers are free to benefit from competition and choose between

The update, which was distributed on July 19, 2024, affected millions of devices worldwide, causing widespread disruptions to various industries, including transportation, healthcare, finance, and more.\n\n**Background**\n\nCrowdStrike produces a suite of security software products for businesses, designed to protect computers from cyberattacks. Falcon, CrowdStrike's Endpoint detection and response agent, works at the operating system kernel level on individual computers to detect and prevent threats. Patches are routinely distributed by CrowdStrike to its clients to enable their computers to address new threats.\n\n**Outage**\n\nOn July 19, 2024, at 04:09 UTC, CrowdStrike distributed a faulty configuration update for its Falcon sensor software running on Windows PCs and servers. A modification to a configuration file, Channel File 291, caused an out-of-bounds memory read in the Windows sensor client, resulting in an invalid page fault. The update caused machines to either enter into a bootloop or boot into recovery mode.\n\n**Remedy**\n\nAffected machines could be restored by rebooting while connected to the network, ideally while connected to Ethernet. This allowed the opportunity to download the reverted channel file, with multiple reboots reportedly required.\n\n**Impact**\n\nOutages were experienced worldwide, reflecting the wide use of Microsoft Windows and CrowdStrike software by global corporations in numerous business sectors. At the time of the incident, CrowdStrike said it had more than 24,000 customers, including nearly 60% of Fortune 500 companies and more than half of the Fortune 1000. On July 20, Microsoft estimated that 8.5 million devices were affected by the update, which it said was less than one percent of all Windows devices.\n\n**CrowdStrike Liability**\n\nCrowdStrike's own terms and conditions for their Falcon software limit liability to \"fees paid,\" effectively a refund. Larger customers may have negotiated different terms.\n\n**Air Transport**\n\nGlobally, 5,078 air flights, 4.6% of those scheduled that day, were cancelled. An unrelated Microsoft Azure outage, affecting services such as Microsoft 365, compounded airlines' problems. Australian airlines Qantas, Virgin Australia, and Jetstar were affected. Hong Kong International Airport experienced delays during check-in, primarily for passengers of the local budget carrier Hong Kong Express. Jeju Air and Spring Japan experienced problems, and Jetstar Japan cancelled many domestic flights.\n\n**Asia**\n\nIn Singapore, some self-check-in kiosks in Singapore Changi Airport were affected, delaying and forcing airlines to switch to manual check-in. Singapore Airlines and Scoot reported various levels of service difficulties throughout July 19. Cebu Pacific and Philippines AirAsia flights were delayed. Long queues formed at Ninoy Aquino International Airport in the Philippines. In Taiwan, airline system disruptions were reported at Taoyuan International Airport. In Indonesia, disruptions were reported for the check-in systems of AirAsia and Citilink.\n\n**Europe**\n\nPrague Airport in the Czech Republic, Budapest Airport in Hungary, Bratislava Airport in Slovakia, and Schiphol Airport in the Netherlands experienced problems. Planes were not allowed to land at Zurich Airport. ENAIRE's Aena, the Spanish national airport traffic control manager, mentioned an IT outage in their website and social media. All Spanish airports reported disruptions. Charles de Gaulle Airport and Orly Airport experienced check-in problems and suspended flights.\n\n**Middle East and North Africa**\n\nTunisia experienced temporary airport disruptions. Turkish Airlines cancelled some of its flights due to the outage.\n\n**North America**\n\nIn the mid-morning of July 19, a ground stop was issued by United, Delta, and American Airlines, halting takeoffs but allowing aircraft aloft to reach their destinations. Allegiant Air was also grounded by the outage. Around 10:30 a.m. Eastern time, AP reported that about 1,500 flights had already been cancelled in the United States due to the outage.\n\n**Finance**\n\nMicrosoft and CrowdStrike stocks fell as a result of the outage. CrowdStrike's stock fell more than 11% on July 19, although Microsoft stock was down less than 1%.\n\n**Government**\n\nThe United States Department of Homeland Security, NASA, Federal Trade Commission, National Nuclear Security Administration, Department of Justice, and Department of Education were affected, and the Department of the Treasury and Department of State reported minor disruptions. The Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Energy experienced disruptions, but it is not currently known if they are related to the incident.\n\n**Ground Transport**\n\nTraffic disruptions were reported at the US–Canada border, including long delays at the Ambassador Bridge and Detroit–Windsor tunnel between Ontario and Michigan. The Canada Border Services Agency blamed a partial outage of its telephone reporting system, which was later resolved.\n\n**Healthcare**\n\nMany hospitals across North America paused non-urgent surgeries and visits. Some affected hospitals, while remaining open, had limited, if any, access to patient records. In the United States, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center postponed all procedures that required anaesthesia, the Mass General Brigham hospital system cancelled all non-emergency procedures and medical visits, and the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center was also affected.\n\n**Media and Communications**\n\nNumerous American TV stations were unable to broadcast because of the global outage. Various Paramount channels were also affected, including Nicktoons, TeenNick, BET Her, NickMusic, and most channels on the Pluto TV service MeTV Toons was sent off the air for five and a half hours.\n\n**Retail**\n\nSupermarkets in the Philippines were affected due to crashed POS systems. German supermarket chain Tegut closed some of its stores. Customers experienced payment problems at Foodstuffs and Woolworths supermarkets in New Zealand. Coles was also affected.\n\n**Other Sectors**\n\nThe outage affected terminal operations at DCT Gdańsk, a major container hub in the Baltic port of Gdańsk in Poland.\n\n**Response**\n\nCrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz apologized to the public in a live interview on NBC's Today, saying company leaders were \"deeply sorry for the impact that we've caused to customers, to travelers, to anyone affected by this, including our companies.\" CrowdStrike warned that malicious actors might try to pose as its staff or independent researchers claiming to help fix the problem.\n\n**Political**\n\nThe Australian government held a national emergency meeting to address the outage. The National Coordination Mechanism was activated; Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said, \"I understand Australians are concerned about the outage that is unfolding globally and affecting a wide range of services. My Government is working closely with the National Cyber Security Coordinator.\" Victorians were advised to call Triple-0 if a fire alarm sounds or smoke is detected, as some automatic alarms in buildings may not automatically call fire services due to the outage.\n\n**Industry**\n\nCybersecurity consultant Troy Hunt called the incident the \"largest IT outage in history,\" adding: \"This is basically what we were all worried about with Y2K, except it's actually happened this time.\" Slate described it as \"Y2K Lite.\"\n\n**Criminal**\n\nGovernments worldwide and cybersecurity agencies warned of digital phishing scams after the incident. Cyber criminals started sending phishing emails purporting to be CrowdStrike support and impersonating CrowdStrike staff in phone calls shortly afterward.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe 19 July update was an instance of a template that was tested and released in March 2024 as part of an update to the Falcon Sensor software. This new instance, Channel File 291, passed validation due to a bug in CrowdStrike's content verification software. The Falcon Sensor itself parses the file differently in a way that led to a software crash in kernel mode.\n\n**Cause**\n\nThe 19 July update was an instance of a template that was tested and released in March 2024 as part of an update to the Falcon Sensor software. This new instance, Channel File 291, passed validation due to a bug in CrowdStrike's content verification software. The Falcon Sensor itself parses the file differently in a way that led to a software crash in kernel mode.\n\n**Centralisation and Homogeneity**\n\nThe outage raised questions about oligopoly and centralisation in the information technology sector. The majority of the world's computers use Microsoft Windows, creating a monoculture that reduces resiliency. Critical infrastructure expert Gregory Falco said, \"Cybersecurity providers are part of this homogenous backbone of modern systems and are so core to how we operate that a glitch in their operations will have similar impacts to failures in systems that are household names.\"\n\n**IT Practices**\n\nExperts speculate that the update was not put through routine patch management procedures (testing the update in a sandbox) to verify there were no problems.\n\n**Operating System Design and Antitrust Enforcement**\n\nMicrosoft blamed a 2009 antitrust agreement with the European Union that they said forced them to sustain low-level kernel access to third-party developers. The document does not explicitly state that Microsoft has to provide kernel-level access, but says Microsoft must provide access to the same APIs used by its own security products. The EU rejected the allegations.\n\n**See Also**\n\nThe 2024 CrowdStrike-related IT outages were a significant event that highlighted the interconnectedness of modern technology and the potential risks of a single point of failure. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of robust cybersecurity measures, regular software updates, and diversity in software development to mitigate the risk of similar incidents in the

He is the son of Bing Russell, an actor, and Louise Julia (née Crone) Russell, a dancer. With a diverse ancestry of English, Irish, German, and Scottish roots, Russell has established a long and illustrious career in the entertainment industry.\n\nEarly Life\nKurt Russell was born on March 17, 1951, at Wesson Maternity Hospital in Springfield, Massachusetts. His father, Bing Russell, was a talented actor, and his mother, Louise Julia (née Crone) Russell, was a skilled dancer. Russell's family relocated to California when he was a child, and he grew up in Thousand Oaks, California. Russell developed a passion for baseball at a young age and played little league baseball throughout his grade school years. He also played on his high school baseball team as a second baseman and graduated from Thousand Oaks High School in 1969.\n\nCareer\nRussell made his film debut with an uncredited part in the 1963 film \"It Happened at the World's Fair,\" where he played a boy who kicked Elvis Presley in the leg. On April 24, 1963, Russell guest-starred in the ABC series \"Our Man Higgins,\" starring Stanley Holloway as an English butler in an American family. This marked the beginning of Russell's journey as a child actor.\n\nChild Actor\nRussell's early career was marked by a string of film and television appearances. In 1966, he was signed to a ten-year contract with Walt Disney Productions, where he became one of the studio's top stars of the 1970s. Russell's first film for Disney was \"Follow Me, Boys!\" (1966), directed by Robert Alton, where he played a young boy who becomes the leader of a Boy Scout troop. Walt Disney himself described Russell as \"a 15-year-old boy for whom I predict a great acting future.\" One of the last things Disney ever wrote was the name \"Kurt Russell\" (though misspelled as \"Kirt\") on a piece of paper.\n\nDisney Star\nDuring his tenure at Disney, Russell appeared in several successful films, including \"The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes\" (1969) and \"The Barefoot Executive\" (1971). He also continued to guest-star on non-Disney TV shows, such as \"The Road West\" and \"Lost in Space.\" In the autumn of 1966, Russell played Quano, the son of a planetary ruler, in the CBS series \"Lost in Space.\" This marked one of the last episodes of the show.\n\nStardom\nDisney promoted Russell to star roles with \"The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes\" (1969), which was a big hit. He followed it with \"The Barefoot Executive\" (1971), another success. Russell's performances during this period cemented his status as a Disney star, and he became one of the most recognizable faces in the industry.\n\nBaseball Career\nLike his father, Russell had a passion for baseball. In the early 1970s, Russell was a switch-hitting second baseman for the California Angels minor league affiliates, the Bend Rainbows (1971) and Walla Walla Islanders (1972) in the short season Class A-Short Season Northwest League. He then moved up to Class AA in 1973 with the El Paso Sun Kings of the Texas League.\n\nTV Star\nIn the autumn of 1974, Russell appeared in the ABC series \"The New Land,\" inspired by the 1972 Swedish film of the same name. Critically acclaimed, it suffered very low ratings and aired only six of the 13 episodes. He returned to Disney for \"The Strongest Man in the World\" (1975).\n\nTransition into Hollywood\nRussell's transition into Hollywood began with the 1979 television film \"Elvis,\" where he played the title role and co-starred with Season Hubley as Priscilla. This marked a significant turning point in Russell's career, and he went on to appear in a series of films, including \"Tequila Sunrise\" (1988) and \"Tango & Cash\" (1989).\n\n1988-Present\nRussell credited his performance in \"Tequila Sunrise\" (1988) with getting Hollywood to regard him differently. He starred in \"Winter People\" (1989) and co-starred with Sylvester Stallone in \"Tango & Cash\" (1989). Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Russell continued to appear in a variety of films, cementing his status as a Hollywood veteran.\n\nPersonal Life\nRussell married actress Season Hubley in 1979, and they had a son, Boston (born February 16, 1980). After his divorce from Hubley in 1983, Russell began his relationship with Goldie Hawn, and they have a son, Wyatt Russell (born July 10, 1986). Russell and Hawn have owned homes in Vancouver, British Columbia; Snowmass Village, Colorado; Manhattan, New York; Brentwood, and Palm Desert, California.\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\n* It Happened at the World's Fair (1963)\n* Follow Me, Boys!

On November 29, manager Paul Clement substituted Sanches at half-time in a 1-0 loss to Chelsea after he had played a pass into the advertising boards on the side of the pitch, believing it to be a teammate.\n\n### 2018-19 Season\n\nOn July 1, 2018, Sanches returned to Bayern Munich. New Bayern manager Niko Kovač said at the beginning of pre-season training, \"I'll try to make him feel good here. When someone feels good, it's much easier to perform well. He has skills that you don't see every day in the Bundesliga; that's why FC Bayern signed him.\" Given a first Bayern start since May 2017, Sanches scored his first goal for the club on September 19, finishing James Rodríguez's cross in a 2-0 Champions League group win at his former club Benfica. His return to good form was indeed sustained by being elected Bayern's best player of September. On December 19, 2018, Sanches was sent-off against RB Leipzig. Sanches scored his first Bundesliga goal on May 18, on the final day of the league campaign, appearing as a substitute for Leon Goretzka in a 5-0 win over Eintracht Frankfurt to seal the title; as Bayern finished two points above Dortmund with 78 points.

He scored his first goal for the club on December 13 in a 2-0 victory against Montpellier.\n\n### Lille\n\nOn August 23, 2019, Sanches joined French club Lille on a four-year contract for a reported fee of €20 million, becoming Lille's most expensive signing ever. He made his debut on September 1, starting in a 2-0 loss at Reims.

He scored his first goal for the club on December 13 in a 2-0 victory against Montpellier.\n\n### 2020-21 Season\n\nIn his second season at the club, Sanches formed a partnership in the midfield alongside Benjamin André in a double pivot. However, he suffered another hamstring injury in November, leading him to lose his place in the team to Boubakary Soumaré. Nevertheless, Sanches remained an important player for Lille, making 29 appearances, and providing a crucial assist for Jonathan David in a 2-1 away win over Angers, to win the 2020-21 Ligue 1 with Lille, ending the club's 10-year league title drought.\n\n### 2021-22 Season\n\nAt the start of the season in August, Sanches was sidelined with a hamstring injury, which required surgery, missing seven weeks of the season. In August, Barcelona negotiated with Lille for the transfer of Sanches, but his injury, led to the transfer collapsing at the final stages. He made his return on October 3, replacing Jonathan Ikoné in the 94th minute in a 2-0 win against Marseille. On December 1, Sanches scored his first goal of the season in a 2-1 win against Rennes.\n\n### Paris Saint-Germain\n\nOn August 4, 2022, Sanches signed for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) on a permanent deal until June 30, 2027.

It was reported by journalist Fabrizio Romano that Roma had paid a €1 million loan fee, that the buy option was set at €15 million, and that the option would become mandatory should Sanches play at least 60% of Roma's matches during the season.\n\n### Return to Benfica\n\nOn August 5, 2024, Sanches returned to Benfica on loan, with the option to make the move permanent. The deal was part of a transfer with Benfica midfielder João Neves moving in the other direction on a permanent move.\n\n### International Career\n\nSanches gained 40 caps for Portugal all youth categories comprised. He represented Portugal in the 2014 UEFA European Under-17 Championship, helping them reach the semi-finals, where they lost to eventual winners, England.

Sanches made his competitive debut on June 14 in the team's opening match against Iceland in Saint-Étienne, replacing João Moutinho for the final 19 minutes of a 1-1 draw. He contributed to the only goal of the match in a 1-0 extra-time victory in the round of 16 against Croatia on June 25, and was elected man of the match. Observing that performance, former Portuguese international António Sousa said, \"When he's on the ball you don't notice how young he is. Physically and mentally, he is more than ready,\" while Fernando Santos exalted Sanches as a player immune to pressure.\n\n### Post-Euro 2016 and Euro 2020\n\nSanches and striker Eder were notable Euro 2016 winners omitted from Portugal's squad for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup in Russia; Sanches played in the 2017 UEFA European Under-21 Championship instead. He was also absent from the 35-man preliminary squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\n### Style of Play\n\nSanches has been noted for his versatility in midfield, being comfortable in defensive, attacking, central and wide roles. His attributes include physical strength, passing ability, and being composed in possession. For these traits and his hairstyle, he has been likened to the Dutchman Edgar Davids.\n\n### Age Controversy\n\nOpponents of Sanches have claimed he is older than his birth certificate states, basing their judgement on the gap between his birth and its registration. In March 2016, as Sporting CP challenged Benfica for the league title, Sporting's then-president Bruno de Carvalho accused Sanches of lying about his age. Sanches requested Carvalho publicly apologise or face a lawsuit for defamation. During Euro 2016, French former manager Guy Roux made a similar accusation.\n\n### Personal Life\n\nSanches' cousins, Cláudio, Miguel, and Jair Tavares, are also professional footballers.\n\n###

positions well He opens with both 1.d4 and 1.e4, as well as 1.c4, and, on occasion, 1.Nf3, thus making it harder for opponents to prepare against him and reducing the effect of computer analysis [488] [489] [490] He said in 2015 that the middlegame is his favourite part of the game as it comes down to \"pure chess\" [488]\n\n\nNotable games\nCarlsen modelled for G-Star Raw's Fall/Winter 2010

West Division [41] Head coach Hank Stram considered his 1971 Chiefs team as his best, but they failed to capture their championship dominance from 1969 [41] Most of the pieces of the team which won Super Bowl IV two years earlier were still in place for the 1971 season [41] The Chiefs tied with the Miami Dolphins for the best record in the AFC, and both teams met in a Christmas Day playoff game which the Chiefs lost 27–24 in double overtime [41] The Dolphins outlasted the Chiefs with a 37-yard field goal [41] The game surpassed the 1962 AFL Championship Game as the longest ever at 82 minutes

seventh head coach [45] In the 1988 and 1989 NFL Drafts, the Chiefs selected both defensive end Neil Smith and linebacker Derrick Thomas, respectively [45] [53] The defense that Thomas and Smith anchored in their seven seasons together was a big reason why the Chiefs reached the postseason in six straight years [54]\n\n\nDick Vermeil years (2001–2005)\nLooking to change the Chiefs' game plan which relied on a tough defensive strategy for the past decade, Carl Peterson contacted Dick Vermeil about the Chiefs' head coaching vacancy for the 2001 season [58] Vermeil previously led the St Louis Rams to a victory in Super Bowl XXXIV [59] Vermeil was hired on January 12 [60] The Chiefs then traded a first-round draft pick in the 2001 NFL draft to St Louis for quarterback Trent Green and signed free agent running back Priest Holmes to be the team's cornerstones on offense [61] [62] In Vermeil's first season with the Chiefs, he led the team to a 6–10 record [63] The team improved to a 8–8 record in 2002 but still missed the postseason [64]\n\n\nDecline\nWithin two weeks of Vermeil's retirement, the Chiefs returned to their defensive roots with the selection of its next head coach [59] The team introduced Herm Edwards, a former Chiefs scout and head coach of the New York Jets, as the team's tenth head coach after trading a fourth-round selection in the 2006 NFL draft to the Jets [74] Quarterback Trent Green suffered a severe concussion in the team's season opener to the Cincinnati Bengals which left him out of play for eight weeks [75] Backup quarterback Damon Huard took over in Green's absence and led the Chiefs to a 5–3 record [76]\n\n\nReemergence and dynasty (2013–present)\nFollowing the 2012 season, the Chiefs fired head coach Romeo Crennel and general manager Scott Pioli [125] [126] Former Philadelphia Eagles head coach Andy Reid was brought in as head coach to work with new general manager John Dorsey, a former Green Bay Packers head scout [127]

12–4, clinching the AFC West for the third year in a row and the AFC's top seed This included victories over division rivals Los Angeles Chargers, Oakland Raiders and Denver Broncos (twice), along with important conference victories over the Pittsburgh Steelers, Cincinnati Bengals, and Jacksonville Jaguars Their first loss of the season came at the hands of the New England Patriots with a last-second field goal [147] Their second loss of the season came against the Los Angeles Rams with a final score of 51–54, in which the Kansas City Chiefs made history by becoming the first NFL team to lose a game after scoring more than 50 points [148] Mahomes finished the season with 5,097 yards and 50 touchdowns, both team records [149] He became the 11th quarterback to throw for 5,000 yards and the third to throw for 50 touchdowns [150] He joined Peyton Manning as only the 2nd player in NFL history to throw for 5,000 yards and 50 touchdowns [151] For his performance during the season, he was named AP NFL MVP, the first Chief to ever win the award [152]\n\n\nChampionships\nThe Chiefs have won four Super Bowl Championships and three AFL Championships – the latter of which were won twice

field since 1972 and has a capacity of 76,416, [193] which makes it the fifth-largest stadium in the NFL The stadium underwent a $375 million renovation, completed in mid-2010, which included new luxury boxes, wider concourses and enhanced amenities [194] [104] The stadium renovation was paid for by $250 million in taxpayer money and $125 million from the Hunt Family [108] The stadium cost $53 million to build in 1972, and an average ticket in 2009 costs $81 [194] Aramark serves as the stadium's concession provider and T-Mobile, Anheuser-Busch and Coca-Cola are major corporate sponsors

[25] They moved camp to Southern Methodist University, owner Lamar Hunt's alma mater, for 1961 and continued to practice there until 1965 [25] From 1966 to 1971, the Chiefs practiced in Swope Park in Kansas City, [208] and from 1972 to 1991 held camp at William Jewell College in Clay County, Missouri–where Lamar Hunt had extensive business dealings including Worlds of Fun, Oceans of Fun and SubTropolis [53]\n\n\nRivalries\nThe rivalry between the Chiefs and the Las Vegas Raiders is considered as one of the NFL's most bitter, extending back into the infancy of the AFL [214] Most notably during the era; both the Chiefs and Raiders appeared in the first two Super Bowl games [215] [216] [217] Since the AFL was established in 1960, the Chiefs and Raiders have shared the same division, first being the AFL Western Conference, and since the AFL–NFL merger, the AFC West.\nThe Chiefs lead the regular season series 73–55–2 as of the end of the 2023 season, including a 2–1 playoff record against Las Vegas [218]\n\n\nLas Vegas Raiders\nThe rivalry between the Chiefs and the Las Vegas Raiders is considered as one of the NFL's most bitter, extending back into the infancy of the AFL [214]

playoff record against Las Vegas [218]\n\n\nLos Angeles Chargers\nA historic divisional battle for the Chiefs; the rivalry with the Los Angeles Chargers reignited during the 2020s as matchups would feature an offensive battle between Patrick Mahomes and Chargers' pro-bowl quarterback Justin Herbert [219] The Chiefs lead 69–58–1 as of the end of the 2023 season, [220] but the Chargers won 17–0 in the only playoff meeting between the two teams, a 1992 AFC wild card game [221]\n\n\nDenver Broncos\nChiefs lead 72–56 as of the 2023 season, which included a run of 16 straight wins, [222] but the Broncos won the only playoff game between the two teams, a 1997 AFC Divisional game [223] [224]\n\n\nBuffalo Bills\nThe series originated during the American Football League's inaugural season in 1960, as both the Kansas City Chiefs, then known as the Dallas Texans, and Buffalo Bills were charter teams in the league [225] Despite being in two different divisions since their founding in 1960, the Bills and Chiefs have had many notable moments in NFL postseason history, most notably the 1966 AFL Championship Game, the 2021 AFC Divisional playoff game (known especially for the infamous '13 Seconds'), and the 2024 AFC Divisional playoff game (known as 'Wide Right II') Since 2020, the rivalry has redeveloped as both teams consistently contended for the AFC title A rivalry has also developed between Bills quarterback Josh Allen and Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, with many comparing it to the former rivalry between Tom Brady and Peyton Manning [226] \nAs of 2023, Buffalo leads the series 29–25–1, but Kansas City leads the playoff series 4–2 Of the six playoff meetings the teams have contested, three were AFL/AFC championship games [227]\n\n\nCincinnati Bengals\nA relatively new rivalry for the Chiefs has formed in the 2020s with the Cincinnati Bengals Prior to 2021, the rivalry was nonexistent By 2021 though, the Bengals became a rising team in the AFC with the arrival of a healthy top tier quarterback in Joe Burrow, the #1 pick in the 2020 NFL draft, who could go toe to toe with Patrick Mahomes [228] The Bengals beat the Chiefs in the 2021 regular season in Cincinnati 34–31, and then followed that up with a victory in that year's AFC Championship Game at Arrowhead, a game in which the Cincinnati defense shut the Kansas City offense down in the second half and kicker Evan McPherson hit a game winning field goal in overtime to advance to Super Bowl LVI In 2022, the Chiefs and Bengals again met in the regular season, with the Bengals prevailing 27–24 and sealing the game off of a rare Travis Kelce fumble The Chiefs again met the Bengals in the AFC Championship game that season The Chiefs won the game on a walk off field goal and advanced to Super Bowl LVII thanks to Bengals defensive end Joseph Ossai hitting Patrick Mahomes out of bounds when Mahomes was scrambling for a first down, leading to an unnecessary roughness penalty [229] The two teams met again in 2023, but did not face Joe Burrow due to Burrow suffering a season ending wrist injury earlier in the season To date, the Joe Burrow led Bengals are the only AFC team to have a winning record against the Chiefs since Patrick Mahomes became their starting quarterback As of 2023, the Bengals lead the all-time series 18–16 [230]\n\n\nMissouri Governor's Cup: St. Louis Cardinals/St. Louis Rams\nWhen St Louis, Missouri had NFL teams, namely the Cardinals and later the Rams, a cross-state rivalry existed with the Chiefs; with a trophy being awarded to the winner of each game The series was active with the Cardinals from 1960 to 1988 prior to their relocation to Arizona The series found new life from 1995 to 2015 after the Rams played in St Louis for a 20-year tenure Despite this, the series ended permanently following the Rams' relocation back to Los Angeles in 2016 Though, following the Rams' return to Los Angeles; the two teams would play each other during the 2018 season in a historic matchup which set the record for the third-highest scoring game of all time, [231] hailed by many as one of the greatest games in league history [232] [233] As of the 2023 season, the Chiefs lead the all-time series 8–5 [234]\n\n\nMascots and cheerleaders\nThe Chiefs' first mascot was Warpaint, a nickname given to several breeds of pinto horse Warpaint served as the team's mascot from 1963 to 1988 [24] [235] [236] The first Warpaint (born in 1955, died in 1992) was ridden bareback by rider Bob Johnson who wore a full Native American headdress [24] [235] Warpaint circled the field at the beginning of each Chiefs home game and performed victory laps following each Chiefs touchdown [24] [235] On September 20, 2009, a new Warpaint horse was unveiled at the Chiefs' home opener [237] Warpaint was ridden by a cheerleader in its return [238] The Chiefs again retired Warpaint in 2021 as a part of their commitment to stop the use of Native American

21–14 victory over the Miami Dolphins, on November 5, 2023, in Frankfurt Germany, Andy Reid tied former Chiefs head coach Hank Stram on the franchise's all-time regular season wins list with 124 victories [255] [256]\n\n\nOwnership and administration\nThe franchise was founded in 1959 by Lamar Hunt after a failed attempt by Hunt to purchase an NFL franchise and relocate them to Texas [257] Hunt remained the team's owner until his death in 2006 [257] The Hunt family kept ownership of the team following Lamar's death and Clark Hunt, Lamar's son, represents the family's interests [194] While Hunt's official title is CEO and Chairman of the Board, he represents the team at all owner meetings [258] [259] In 2010, Hunt assumed role as CEO alongside his role as chairman of the board

honored by head coach Hank Stram in 1969 with a Super Bowl ring for the team's victory in Super Bowl IV [290] When his health was declining, DiPardo took a leave of absence from the band from 1983 to 1988 [291] DiPardo's daughter took over as bandleader in 1989, by which time DiPardo returned to the band by popular demand [291] [292] For the 2009 season, due to renovations at Arrowhead Stadium, the band did not return to perform at the stadium.\n\n\nName controversy\nFor various reasons, the team has faced charges of racism and anti-Indigenous cultural appropriation and misuse of names, symbols, and practices [294] [295] The name comes from the nickname of former Kansas City mayor Harold Roe Bartle, who nicknamed himself \"Chief\" as part of creating the Tribe of Mic-O-Say, a group affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America [296] Over the life of the franchise the following have also been displayed: an arrowhead logo, fans' \"tomahawk chop\" gestures during games, a horse named Warpaint, the use of a large drum, and the wearing of face paint, headdresses, and other Native American symbols [297] [298]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal

The team is a member of the West division of the American Football Conference (AFC) in the National Football League (NFL). The Chiefs were established in 1960 as the Dallas Texans and have since become one of the most successful teams in the NFL, winning four Super Bowl championships.\n\n**History**\n\nIn 1959, Lamar Hunt began discussions with other businessmen to establish a professional football league that would rival the National Football League. Hunt's desire to secure a football team was heightened after watching the 1958 NFL Championship Game between the New York Giants and Baltimore Colts. After unsuccessful attempts to purchase and relocate the NFL's Chicago Cardinals to his hometown of Dallas, Texas, Hunt went to the NFL and asked to create an expansion franchise in Dallas. The NFL turned him down, so Hunt then established the American Football League and started his own team, the Dallas Texans, to begin play in 1960.\n\n**American Football League**\n\nThe Texans began playing in 1960, and the team's logo consisted of the state of Texas in white with a yellow star marking the location of the city of Dallas. Originally, Hunt chose Columbia blue and orange for the Texans' uniforms, but Bud Adams chose Columbia blue and scarlet for his Houston Oilers franchise. Hunt reverted to red and gold for the Texans' uniforms, which even after the team relocated to Kansas City, remain as the franchise's colors to this day.\n\n**Hank Stram leaves team**\n\nIn 1970, the Chiefs went 7–5–2 and missed the playoffs. The following season, the Chiefs tallied a 10–3–1 record and won the AFC West Division. Head coach Hank Stram considered his 1971 Chiefs team as his best, but they failed to capture their championship dominance from 1969. Most of the pieces of the team which won Super Bowl IV two years earlier were still in place for the 1971 season. The Chiefs tied with the Miami Dolphins for the best record in the AFC, and both teams met in a Christmas Day playoff game which the Chiefs lost 27–24 in double overtime. The game surpassed the 1962 AFL Championship Game as the longest ever at 82 minutes and 40 seconds. The game was also the final football game at Kansas City's Municipal Stadium.\n\n**Marty Schottenheimer era (1989–1998)**\n\nOn December 19, 1988, owner Lamar Hunt hired Carl Peterson as the team's new president, general manager, and chief executive officer. Peterson fired head coach Frank Gansz two weeks after taking over and hired Marty Schottenheimer as the club's seventh head coach. In the 1988 and 1989 NFL Drafts, the Chiefs selected both defensive end Neil Smith and linebacker Derrick Thomas, respectively. The defense that Thomas and Smith anchored in their seven seasons together was a big reason why the Chiefs reached the postseason in six straight years.\n\n**Dick Vermeil years (2001–2005)**\n\nLooking to change the Chiefs' game plan which relied on a tough defensive strategy for the past decade, Carl Peterson contacted Dick Vermeil about the Chiefs' head coaching vacancy for the 2001 season. Vermeil previously led the St Louis Rams to a victory in Super Bowl XXXIV. Vermeil was hired on January 12. The Chiefs then traded a first-round draft pick in the 2001 NFL draft to St Louis for quarterback Trent Green and signed free agent running back Priest Holmes to be the team's cornerstones on offense. In Vermeil's first season with the Chiefs, he led the team to a 6–10 record. The team improved to an 8–8 record in 2002 but still missed the postseason.\n\n**Decline**\n\nWithin two weeks of Vermeil's retirement, the Chiefs returned to their defensive roots with the selection of its next head coach. The team introduced Herm Edwards, a former Chiefs scout and head coach of the New York Jets, as the team's tenth head coach after trading a fourth-round selection in the 2006 NFL draft to the Jets. Quarterback Trent Green suffered a severe concussion in the team's season opener to the Cincinnati Bengals which left him out of play for eight weeks. Backup quarterback Damon Huard took over in Green's absence and led the Chiefs to a 5–3 record.\n\n**Reemergence and dynasty (2013–present)**\n\nFollowing the 2012 season, the Chiefs fired head coach Romeo Crennel and general manager Scott Pioli. Former Philadelphia Eagles head coach Andy Reid was brought in as head coach to work with new general manager John Dorsey, a former Green Bay Packers head scout. In Reid's tenure, the Chiefs have never had a sub-.500 season, making the playoffs in 10 of his 11 seasons as head coach, winning the division six times, and twice having two consecutive Super Bowl appearances, and three wins.\n\n**Patrick Mahomes era (2018–present)**\n\nPatrick Mahomes made his NFL debut and first career start in the December 31, 2017, game against the Denver Broncos. The Chiefs won the game 27–24, with Mahomes going 22 for 35 with 284 yards and one interception. The Chiefs began the 2018 season with first-year starter Mahomes as their quarterback and finished the regular season with a record of 12–4, clinching the AFC West for the third year in a row and the AFC's top seed. This included victories over division rivals Los Angeles Chargers, Oakland Raiders, and Denver Broncos (twice), along with important conference victories over the Pittsburgh Steelers, Cincinnati Bengals, and Jacksonville Jaguars. Their first loss of the season came at the hands of the New England Patriots with a last-second field goal. Their second loss of the season came against the Los Angeles Rams with a final score of 51–54, in which the Kansas City Chiefs made history by becoming the first NFL team to lose a game after scoring more than 50 points.\n\n**Championships**\n\nThe Chiefs have won four Super Bowl Championships and three AFL Championships – the latter of which were won twice as the Kansas City Chiefs and once under their original name, the Dallas Texans.\n\n**Logos and uniforms**\n\nThe Chiefs' first mascot was Warpaint, a nickname given to several breeds of pinto horse. Warpaint served as the team's mascot from 1963 to 1988. The first Warpaint (born in 1955, died in 1992) was ridden bareback by rider Bob Johnson who wore a full Native American headdress. Warpaint circled the field at the beginning of each Chiefs home game and performed victory laps following each Chiefs touchdown.\n\n**Notable players**\n\nThe Chiefs have had many notable players throughout their history, including:\n\n* Lamar Hunt, founder and original owner of the team\n* Hank Stram, head coach of the team from 1960 to 1974\n* Len Dawson, quarterback of the team from 1962 to 1975\n* Otis Taylor, wide receiver of the team from 1965 to 1973\n* Emmitt Thomas, defensive back of the team from 1966 to 1978\n* Derrick Thomas, linebacker of the team from 1989 to 1999\n* Tony Gonzalez, tight end of the team from 1997 to 2008\n* Patrick Mahomes, quarterback of the team from 2017 to present\n* Travis Kelce, tight end of the team from 2013 to present\n\n**Coaches**\n\nThe Chiefs have had many notable coaches throughout their history, including:\n\n* Hank Stram, head coach of the team from 1960 to 1974\n* Marty Schottenheimer, head coach of the team from 1989 to 1998\n* Dick Vermeil, head coach of the team from 2001 to 2005\n* Herm Edwards, head coach of the team from 2006 to 2008\n* Todd Haley, head coach of the team from 2009 to 2011\n* Romeo Crennel, head coach of the team from 2012 to 2012\n* Andy Reid, head coach of the team from 2013 to present\n\n**Ownership and administration**\n\nThe franchise was founded in 1959 by Lamar Hunt after a failed attempt by Hunt to purchase an NFL franchise and relocate them to Texas. The Hunt family kept ownership of the team following Lamar's death and Clark Hunt, Lamar's son, represents the family's interests. Clark Hunt serves as the CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors for the Chiefs organization.\n\n**Media**\n\nThe Chiefs have a strong media presence, with games broadcast on various networks, including Fox, CBS, NBC, and ESPN. The team also has a number of radio affiliates across the country, including flagship station WDAF-FM in Kansas City.\n\n**Culture**\n\nThe Chiefs have a strong and dedicated fan base, with fans known for their enthusiasm and loyalty.

the only playoff game between the two teams, a 1997 AFC Divisional game [223] [224]\n\n\nBuffalo Bills\nThe series originated during the American Football League's inaugural season in 1960, as both the Kansas City Chiefs, then known as the Dallas Texans, and Buffalo Bills were charter teams in the league [225] Despite being in two different divisions since their founding in 1960, the Bills and Chiefs have had many notable moments in NFL postseason history, most notably the 1966 AFL Championship Game, the 2021 AFC Divisional playoff game (known especially for the infamous '13 Seconds'), and the 2024 AFC Divisional playoff game (known as 'Wide Right II') Since 2020, the rivalry has redeveloped as both teams consistently contended for the AFC title A rivalry has also developed between Bills quarterback Josh Allen and Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, with many comparing it to the former rivalry between Tom Brady and Peyton Manning [226] \nAs of 2023, Buffalo leads the series 29–25–1, but Kansas City leads the playoff series 4–2 Of the six playoff meetings the teams have contested, three were AFL/AFC championship games [227]\n\n\nCincinnati Bengals\nA relatively new rivalry for the Chiefs has formed in the 2020s with the Cincinnati Bengals Prior to 2021, the rivalry was nonexistent By 2021 though, the Bengals became a rising team in the AFC with the arrival of a healthy top tier quarterback in Joe Burrow, the #1 pick in the 2020 NFL draft, who could go toe to toe with Patrick Mahomes [228] The Bengals beat the Chiefs in the 2021 regular season in Cincinnati 34–31, and then followed that up with a victory in that year's AFC Championship Game at Arrowhead, a game in which the Cincinnati defense shut the Kansas City offense down in the second half and kicker Evan McPherson hit a game winning field goal in overtime to advance to Super Bowl LVI In 2022, the Chiefs and Bengals again met in the regular season, with the Bengals prevailing 27–24 and sealing the game off of a rare Travis Kelce fumble The Chiefs again met the Bengals in the AFC Championship game that season The Chiefs won the game on a walk off field goal and advanced to Super Bowl LVII thanks to Bengals defensive end Joseph Ossai hitting Patrick Mahomes out of bounds when Mahomes was scrambling for a first down, leading to an unnecessary roughness penalty [229] The two teams met again in 2023, but did not face Joe Burrow due to Burrow suffering a season ending wrist injury earlier in the season To date, the Joe Burrow led Bengals are the only AFC team to have a winning record against the Chiefs since Patrick Mahomes became their starting quarterback As of 2023, the Bengals lead the all-time series 18–16 [230]\n\n\nMissouri Governor's Cup: St. Louis Cardinals/St. Louis Rams\nWhen St Louis, Missouri had NFL teams, namely the Cardinals and later the Rams, a cross-state rivalry existed with the Chiefs; with a trophy being awarded to the winner of each game The series was active with the Cardinals from 1960 to 1988 prior to their relocation to Arizona The series found new life from 1995 to 2015 after the Rams played in St Louis for a 20-year tenure Despite this, the series ended permanently following the Rams' relocation back to Los Angeles in 2016 Though, following the Rams' return to Los Angeles; the two teams would play each other during the 2018 season in a historic matchup which set the record for the third-highest scoring game of all time, [231] hailed by many as one of the greatest games in league history [232] [233] As of the 2023 season, the Chiefs lead the all-time series 8–5 [234]\n\n\nMascots and cheerleaders\nThe Chiefs' first mascot was Warpaint, a nickname given to several breeds of pinto horse Warpaint served as the team's mascot from 1963 to 1988 [24] [235] [236] The first Warpaint (born in 1955, died in 1992) was ridden bareback by rider Bob Johnson who wore a full Native American headdress [24] [235] Warpaint circled the field at the beginning of each Chiefs home game and performed victory laps following each Chiefs touchdown [24] [235] On September 20, 2009, a new Warpaint horse was unveiled at the Chiefs' home opener [237] Warpaint was ridden by a cheerleader in its return [238] The Chiefs again retired Warpaint in 2021 as a part of their commitment to stop the use of Native American imagery [239]\n\n\nNotable players\nRunning backs (RB)\n\n\nCurrent roster\nRunning backs (RB)\n\n\nRetired numbers\n\n\n\nPro Football Hall of Famers\nTwenty-five members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame spent at least some portion of their career with the Chiefs Thirteen spent the majority of the career with the Chiefs Ten of the Chiefs in the Hall of Fame were involved with the Chiefs during their Super Bowl Championship season of 1969 The Chiefs have 3 contributors, 3 coaches, and 18 players in the Hall of Fame Derrick Thomas is the only Chief in the Hall of Fame that was inducted posthumously Listed below are only people whose tenure with the Chiefs is their reason for induction, not former Chiefs coaches inducted as a player, the only exception being Emmitt Thomas who was inducted as a player for the Chiefs and later become an assistant coach for the team.\n\n\nChiefs Hall of Fame\nEstablished in 1970, the Chiefs Hall of Fame has inducted a new member, with the exception of the 1983 and 2020 seasons, every year to honor their players, coaches, and contributors in an annual ceremony [244] [245] The requirements for induction are that a player, coach, or contributor must have been with the Chiefs for four seasons and been out of the NFL for four seasons at the time of induction [244] There are some exceptions, such as Joe Delaney and Derrick Thomas, Delaney was with the team for only two seasons before his death, Thomas was inducted 1 year after his death in January 2000 (2 years after his final season) The Chiefs have the second-most enshrinees of any NFL team in their team Hall of Fame behind the Green Bay Packers, who have enshrined over 100 players and team contributors over the years in the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame [244] Nineteen players and the coach of the Super Bowl IV championship team have been inducted into the ring of honor Three players were posthumously inducted, Derrick Thomas, Joe Delaney, and Mack Lee Hill.\n\n\nRecords\nThree Chiefs players own major NFL records Patrick Mahomes owns the record for career quarterback rating with a minimum of 1,500 attempts with 103.9, [246] Derrick Thomas owns the record for sacks in a single game with 7 which he accomplished in 1990, [247] and Travis Kelce owns the record for career receptions in the playoffs [248] Additionally, Tony Gonzalez, who spent the majority his career with the Chiefs, is the career receiving yards and receptions leader among tight ends Chiefs players own several less notable records, for example, Mahomes owns the record for fastest quarterback to 100 career passing touchdowns For a list of franchise records, see List of Kansas City Chiefs records\n\n\nHead coaches\nThirteen head coaches have served the Texans/Chiefs franchise since their first season in 1960 [249] Hank Stram, the team's first head coach, led the Chiefs to three AFL championship victories and two appearances in the Super Bowl [250] Stram was the team's longest-tenured head coach, holding the position from 1960 to 1974 [41] Marty Schottenheimer was hired in 1989 and led Kansas City to seven playoff appearances in his ten seasons as head coach [45] [53] Schottenheimer had the best winning percentage (.634) of all Chiefs coaches [55] Gunther Cunningham was on the Chiefs' coaching staff in various positions from 1995 to 2008, serving as the team's head coach in between stints as the team's defensive coordinator [58] [59] Dick Vermeil coached the team to a franchise-best 9–0 start in the 2003 season [251] Of the ten Chiefs coaches, Hank Stram, Marv Levy, and Dick Vermeil have been elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, Levy is more well known for his time with the Buffalo Bills [252] Herm Edwards served as the team's head coach from 2006 to 2008, compiling a 15–33 record and a franchise worst 6–26 record over a two-year span [105] [106] [253] [254] Todd Haley compiled a 19–26 record with the team from 2009 to 2011, including an AFC West division title in 2010 [107] Haley was fired with three games left in the 2011 season Romeo Crennel was named interim coach, and was promoted to full-time coach in January 2012 Crennel was fired on Monday, December 31, 2012, after finishing the 2012 season with a 2–14 record On January 5, 2013, the Chiefs hired Andy Reid to be their next head coach In Reid's tenure, the Chiefs have never had a sub-.500 season, making the playoffs in 10 of his 11 seasons as head coach, winning the division six times, and twice having two consecutive Super Bowl appearances, and three wins With a 21–14 victory over the Miami Dolphins, on November 5, 2023, in Frankfurt Germany, Andy Reid tied former Chiefs head coach Hank Stram on the franchise's all-time regular season wins list with 124 victories [255] [256]\n\n\nOwnership and administration\nThe franchise was founded in 1959 by Lamar Hunt after a failed attempt by Hunt to purchase an NFL franchise and relocate them to Texas [257] Hunt remained the team's owner until his death in 2006 [257] The Hunt family kept ownership of the team following Lamar's death and Clark Hunt, Lamar's son, represents the family's interests [194] While Hunt's official title is CEO and Chairman of the Board, he represents the team at all owner meetings [258] [259] In 2010, Hunt assumed role as CEO alongside his role as chairman of the board [260] According to Forbes, the team began the 2024 season valued at $4.85 billion USD, ranking them 24th among the 32 NFL teams [261]\n\n\nStaff\n→ Coaching staff\n→ Front office\n→ More NFL staffs\n\n\nMedia\nKansas City radio station WDAF-FM (106.5) is the flagship station for The Chiefs Football Radio Network The network has affiliates across Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, and Texas, and national reach through desktop and mobile devices AFC Championship and Super Bowl broadcasts are exclusive to KCSP and WDAF-FM due to NFL rules surrounding the exclusivity of Westwood One's coverage outside of the immediate Kansas City area.\n\n\nCulture\nThe Chiefs boast one of the most loyal fan bases in the NFL [195] [270] Kansas City is the sixth-smallest media market with an NFL team, but they have had the second-highest attendance average over the last decade [199] Studies by Bizjournals in 2006 gave the Chiefs high marks for consistently drawing capacity crowds in both good seasons and bad [271] The Chiefs averaged 77,300 fans per game from 1996 to 2006, second in the NFL behind the Washington Redskins [271] The franchise has an official fan club called Chiefs Kingdom which gives members opportunities to ticket priority benefits and VIP treatment [272] [273]\n\n\nFan base\nThe Chiefs boast one of the most loyal fan bases in the NFL [195] [270] Kansas City is the sixth-smallest media

called Chiefs Kingdom which gives members opportunities to ticket priority benefits and VIP treatment [272] [273]\n\n\nInternational outreach\nThe NFL introduced the league's international home marketing area program in 2021, [285] which sees teams secure international marketing rights in countries beyond the United States The Chiefs were designated as a home team to Germany alongside the Carolina Panthers, New England Patriots, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers In 2023 the NFL also granted the Chiefs permission to expand its marketing and fan outreach to Austria and Switzerland [286] The Chiefs hosted a game in Germany during their 2023 season against the Miami Dolphins [287] [288]\n\n\nTony DiPardo\nFrom various periods between 1963 and the 2008 season, trumpeter Tony DiPardo and The T.D Pack Band played live music at every Chiefs home game [290] [291] The band was known as The Zing Band when the team was located at Municipal Stadium DiPardo was honored by head coach Hank Stram in 1969 with a Super Bowl ring for the team's victory in Super Bowl IV [290] When his health was declining, DiPardo took a leave of absence from the band from 1983 to 1988 [291] DiPardo's daughter took over as bandleader in 1989, by which time DiPardo returned to the band by popular demand [291] [292] For the 2009 season, due to renovations at Arrowhead Stadium, the band did not return to perform at the stadium.\n\n\nName controversy\nFor various reasons, the team has faced charges of racism and anti-Indigenous cultural appropriation and misuse of names, symbols, and practices [294] [295] The name comes from the nickname of former Kansas City mayor Harold Roe Bartle, who nicknamed himself \"Chief\" as part of creating the Tribe of Mic-O-Say, a group affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America [296] Over the life of the franchise the following have also been displayed: an arrowhead logo, fans' \"tomahawk chop\" gestures during games, a horse named Warpaint, the use of a large drum, and the wearing of face paint, headdresses, and other Native American symbols [297] [298]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

nuclear weapons using high-speed designs such as the McDonnell F-101 Voodoo and Republic F-105 Thunderchief [7] As the U.S military entered the Vietnam War, its main ground-attack aircraft was the Korean War-era Douglas A-1 Skyraider A capable aircraft for its era, with a relatively large payload and long loiter time, the propeller-driven design was relatively slow and vulnerable to ground fire  The U.S Air Force and Navy lost 266 A-1s in action in Vietnam, largely from small-arms fire [8] It also had inadequate firepower [9]\n\n\nArmy helicopter competition\nDuring this period, the United States Army had been introducing the Bell UH-1 Iroquois into service First used in its intended role as a transport, it was soon modified in the field to carry more machine guns in what became known as the helicopter gunship role This proved effective against the lightly armed enemy, and new gun and rocket pods were added Soon the Bell AH-1 Cobra was introduced This was an attack helicopter armed with long-range BGM-71 TOW missiles able to destroy tanks from outside the range of defensive fire The helicopter was effective and prompted the U.S military to change its defensive strategy in Europe into blunting any Warsaw Pact advance with anti-tank helicopters instead of the tactical nuclear weapons that had been the basis for NATO's battle plans since the 1950s [14]\n\n\nA-X program\nOn 8 September 1966, General John P McConnell, Chief of Staff of the USAF, ordered that a specialized CAS aircraft be designed, developed, and obtained On 22 December, a Requirements Action Directive was issued for the A-X CAS airplane, [15] and the Attack Experimental (A-X) program office was formed [16] On 6 March 1967, the USAF released a request for information to 21 defense contractors for the A-X [16]\n\n\nProduction\nOn 10 February 1976, Deputy Secretary of Defense Bill Clements authorized full-rate production while the first A-10 was accepted by the USAF Tactical Air Command on 30 March 1976 Production continued and reached a peak rate of 13 aircraft per month By 1984, 715 airplanes, including two prototypes and six development aircraft, had been delivered [2]\n\n\nUpgrades\nThe A-10 has received many upgrades since entering service In 1978, it received the Pave Penny laser receiver pod, mounted on a pylon attached below the right side of the cockpit, which receives reflected laser radiation from laser designators to allow the aircraft to deliver laser-guided munitions [29] [30] In 1980, the A-10 began receiving an inertial navigation system [31]\n\n\nHOG UP and Wing Replacement Program\nIn 1987, Grumman Aerospace took over support for the A-10 program In 1993, Grumman updated the damage tolerance assessment and Force Structural Maintenance Plan and Damage Threat Assessment Over the next few years, problems with wing structure fatigue, first noticed in production years earlier, began to come to the fore Implementation of the maintenance plan was greatly delayed by the base realignment and closure commission (BRAC), which led to 80% of the original workforce being let go [35]\n\n\nModernization (A-10C)\nFrom 2005 to June 2011, [45] the entire fleet of 356 A-10s and OA-10s were modernized in the Precision Engagement program and redesignated A-10C [46] Upgrades included all-weather combat capability, [33] an improved fire-control system (FCS), electronic countermeasures (ECM), smart bomb targeting, a modern communications suite including a Link 16 radio and Satcom, [33] and cockpit upgrades comprising two multifunction displays and HOTAS configuration mixing the F-16's flight stick with the F-15's throttle [47] [48] The Government Accountability Office in 2007 estimated the cost of upgrading, refurbishing, and service life extension plans to total $2.25 billion through 2013 [18] [49] In July 2010, the USAF issued Raytheon a contract to integrate a Helmet Mounted Integrated Targeting (HMIT) system into the A-10C [49] [50] The LASTE system was replaced with the integrated flight and fire control computer (IFFCC) included in the PE upgrade [33]\n\n\nDesign\nThe A-10 has a cantilever low-wing monoplane wing with a wide chord [34] It has superior maneuverability at low speeds and altitude due to its large wing area, high wing aspect ratio, and large ailerons The wing also allows short takeoffs and landings, permitting operations from austere forward airfields near front lines The A-10 can loiter for extended periods and operate under 1,000-foot (300 m) ceilings with 1.5-mile (2.4 km) visibility It typically flies at a relatively low speed of 300 knots (350 mph; 560 km/h), which makes it a better platform for the ground-attack role than fast fighter-bombers, which often have difficulty targeting small, slow-moving targets [55]\n\n\nOverview\nThe A-10 has a cantilever low-wing monoplane wing with a wide chord [34] It has superior maneuverability at low speeds and altitude due to its large wing area, high wing aspect ratio, and large ailerons The wing also allows short takeoffs and landings, permitting operations from austere forward airfields near front lines The A-10 can loiter for extended

for the ground-attack role than fast fighter-bombers, which often have difficulty targeting small, slow-moving targets [55]\n\n\nSurvivability\nThe A-10 is battle-hardened to an exceptional degree, being able to survive direct hits from armor-piercing and high-explosive projectiles up to 23 mm It has double-redundant hydraulic flight systems, and a mechanical system as a backup if hydraulics are lost Flight without hydraulic power uses the manual reversion control system; pitch and yaw control engages automatically, and roll control is pilot-selected In manual reversion mode, the A-10 is sufficiently controllable under favorable conditions to return to base, though control forces are greater than normal It is designed to be able to fly with one engine, half of the tail, one elevator, and half of a wing missing [65] As the A-10 operates close to enemy positions, making it an easy target for man-portable air-defense system (MANPADS), surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), and enemy aircraft, it carries both flares and chaff cartridges [66]\n\n\nWeapons\nThe A-10's primary built-in weapon is the 30×173 mm GAU-8/A Avenger autocannon One of the most powerful aircraft cannons ever flown, the GAU-8 is a hydraulically driven seven-barrel rotary cannon designed for the anti-tank role with a high rate of fire The original design could be switched by the pilot to 2,100 or 4,200 depleted uranium armor-piercing shells per minute; [77] this was later changed to a fixed rate of 3,900 rounds per minute [78] The cannon takes about a half second to spin up to its maximum rate of fire, firing 50 rounds during the first second, and 65 or 70 rounds per second thereafter It is accurate enough to place 80 percent of its shots within a 40-foot (12.4 m) diameter circle from 4,000 feet (1,220 m) while in flight [79] The GAU-8 is optimized for a slant range of 4,000 feet (1,220 m) with the A-10 in a 30-degree dive [80]\n\n\nColors and markings\nAircraft camouflage is used to make the A-10 more difficult to see as it flies low to the ground at subsonic speeds Many types of paint schemes have been tried These have included a \"peanut scheme\" of sand, yellow, and field drab; black and white colors for winter operations; and a tan, green, and brown mixed pattern [85] The most common Cold War-era scheme was the European I woodland camouflage, whose dark green, medium green, and dark gray was meant to blend in with the typical European forest terrain It reflected the assumption that the threat from hostile fighter aircraft outweighed that from ground fire After the 1991 Gulf War, the threat from ground fire was deemed more pressing than the air-to-air threat, leading to the \"Compass Ghost\" scheme with darker gray on top and a lighter gray on the underside of the aircraft [86]\n\n\nOperational history\nThe first unit to receive the A-10 was the 355th Tactical Training Wing, based at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, in March 1976 [89]  The first unit to achieve initial operating capability was the 354th Tactical Fighter Wing at Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, South Carolina, in October 1977 [90]  A-10 deployments followed at bases both at home and abroad, including England AFB, Louisiana; Eielson AFB, Alaska; Osan Air Base, South Korea; and RAF Bentwaters/RAF Woodbridge, England The 81st TFW of RAF Bentwaters/RAF Woodbridge operated rotating detachments of A-10s at four bases in Germany known as Forward Operating Locations (FOLs): Leipheim, Sembach Air Base, Nörvenich Air Base, and RAF Ahlhorn [91] A-10s were initially an unwelcome addition to many in the USAF; most pilots did not want to switch to it as fighter pilots traditionally favored speed and appearance [92] In 1987, many A-10s were shifted to the forward air control (FAC) role and redesignated OA-10 [93] In the FAC role, the OA-10 is typically equipped with up to six pods of 2.75 inch (70 mm) Hydra rockets, usually with smoke or white phosphorus warheads used for target marking OA-10s are physically unchanged and remain fully combat capable despite the redesignation [94]\n\n\nService entry\nThe first unit to receive the A-10 was the 355th Tactical Training

redesignation [94]\n\n\nGulf War and Balkans\nThe A-10 was used in combat for the first time during the Gulf War in 1991, with 132 being deployed [98] A-10s shot down two Iraqi helicopters with the GAU-8 cannon The first of these was shot down by Captain Robert Swain over Kuwait on 6 February 1991 for the A-10's first air-to-air victory [99] [100] Four A-10s were shot down during the war by surface-to-air missiles and eleven A-10s were hit by anti-air artillery rounds [101] Another two battle-damaged A-10s and OA-10As returned to base and were written off Some sustained additional damage in crash landings [102] [103] At the beginning of the war, A-10s flew missions against the Iraqi Republican Guard, but due to heavy attrition, from 15 February they were restricted to within 20 nautical miles (37 km) of the southern border [104] [105]  A-10s also flew missions hunting Iraqi Scud missiles  The A-10 had a mission capable rate of 95.7 percent, flew 8,100 sorties, and launched 90 percent of the AGM-65 Maverick missiles fired in the conflict [106] Shortly after the Gulf War, the USAF abandoned the idea of replacing the A-10 with a CAS version of the F-16 [107]\n\n\nAfghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and recent deployments\nDuring the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, A-10s did not initially take part Beginning in March 2002, A-10 squadrons were deployed to Pakistan and Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan for the campaign against Taliban and Al-Qaeda, known as Operation Anaconda Afterward, they remained in-country, fighting Taliban and Al Qaeda remnants [112]\n\n\nFuture\nThe A-10's future remains a subject of debate In 2007, the USAF expected it to remain in service until 2028 and possibly later, [130] when it would likely be replaced by the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II [40] Director of the Straus Military Reform Project of the Project On Government Oversight Winslow Wheeler, a critic of this plan, said that replacing the A-10 with the F-35 would be a \"giant leap backwards\" given the A-10's performance and the F-35's high costs [131] In 2012, the USAF considered the F-35B STOVL variant as a replacement CAS aircraft, but concluded that it could not generate sufficient sorties [132] In August 2013, Congress and the USAF examined various proposals, including the F-35 and the MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial vehicle filling the A-10's role Proponents state that the A-10's armor and cannon are superior to aircraft such as the F-35 for ground attack, that guided munitions could be jammed, and that ground commanders commonly request A-10 support [117]\n\n\nOther uses\nOn 25 March 2010, an A-10 conducted the first flight of an aircraft with all engines powered by a biofuel blend comprising a 1:1 blend of JP-8 and Camelina-based fuel [159] On 28 June 2012, the A-10 became the first aircraft to fly using a new fuel blend derived from alcohol; known as ATJ (Alcohol-to-Jet), the fuel is cellulosic-based and can be produced using wood, paper, grass, or any cellulose-based material, which are fermented into alcohols before being hydro-processed into aviation fuel ATJ is the third alternative fuel to be evaluated by the USAF as a replacement for the petroleum-derived JP-8 fuel Previous types were synthetic paraffinic kerosene derived from coal and natural gas and a bio-mass fuel derived from plant oils and animal fats known as Hydroprocessed Renewable Jet [160]\n\n\nVariants\nThe A-10 has been flown exclusively by the United States Air Force and its Air Reserve components, the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and the Air National Guard (ANG) As of 2017 [update], 282 A-10C aircraft are reported as operational, divided as follows: 141 USAF, 55 AFRC, 86 ANG [172]\n\n\nOperators\nThe A-10 has been flown

Remscheid, West Germany The aircraft crashed into the upper floor of an apartment complex The pilot and six other people were killed Fifty others were injured, many of them seriously The cause of the accident was attributed to spatial disorientation, after both the mishap aircraft and its flight lead encountered difficult and adverse weather conditions for visual flying [174] [175] The number of cancer cases in the vicinity of the accident rose disproportionately in the years after, raising the possibility that the aircraft may have been loaded with ammunition containing depleted uranium, contrary to U.S statements [176] [177]\n\n\nNotable incidents\nOn 8 December 1988, an A-10A of the U.S Air Forces in Europe crashed into a residential area in the city of Remscheid, West Germany The

designed to provide close air support for ground troops. It is one of the most iconic and versatile aircraft in the United States Air Force (USAF) inventory.\n\n# Development\n## Background\nThe development of conventionally armed attack aircraft in the United States stagnated after World War II, as design efforts for tactical aircraft focused on the delivery of nuclear weapons using high-speed designs such as the McDonnell F-101 Voodoo and Republic F-105 Thunderchief. As the U.S military entered the Vietnam War, its main ground-attack aircraft was the Korean War-era Douglas A-1 Skyraider, a capable aircraft for its era with a relatively large payload and long loiter time, but the propeller-driven design was relatively slow and vulnerable to ground fire. The U.S Air Force and Navy lost 266 A-1s in action in Vietnam, largely from small-arms fire, and it also had inadequate firepower.\n\n## Army helicopter competition\nDuring this period, the United States Army had been introducing the Bell UH-1 Iroquois into service, first used in its intended role as a transport, and soon modified in the field to carry more machine guns in what became known as the helicopter gunship role. This proved effective against the lightly armed enemy, and new gun and rocket pods were added. Soon the Bell AH-1 Cobra was introduced, an attack helicopter armed with long-range BGM-71 TOW missiles able to destroy tanks from outside the range of defensive fire.\n\n## A-X program\nOn September 8, 1966, General John P McConnell, Chief of Staff of the USAF, ordered that a specialized CAS aircraft be designed, developed, and obtained. On December 22, a Requirements Action Directive was issued for the A-X CAS airplane, and the Attack Experimental (A-X) program office was formed. On March 6, 1967, the USAF released a request for information to 21 defense contractors for the A-X.\n\n# Production\n## Background\nThe development of the A-10 was a long and complex process, with many challenges and setbacks. The first prototype, the YA-10, made its maiden flight on May 18, 1972, and the first production aircraft was rolled out on November 21, 1972. The A-10 was officially accepted by the USAF on March 30, 1976.\n\n## Full-rate production\nOn February 10, 1976, Deputy Secretary of Defense Bill Clements authorized full-rate production, and the first A-10 was accepted by the USAF Tactical Air Command on March 30, 1976. Production continued and reached a peak rate of 13 aircraft per month. By 1984, 715 airplanes, including two prototypes and six development aircraft, had been delivered.\n\n# Upgrades\n## Pave Penny laser receiver pod\nIn 1978, the A-10 received the Pave Penny laser receiver pod, mounted on a pylon attached below the right side of the cockpit, which receives reflected laser radiation from laser designators to allow the aircraft to deliver laser-guided munitions.\n\n## Inertial navigation system\nIn 1980, the A-10 began receiving an inertial navigation system.\n\n## HOG UP and Wing Replacement Program\nIn 1987, Grumman Aerospace took over support for the A-10 program. In 1993, Grumman updated the damage tolerance assessment and Force Structural Maintenance Plan and Damage Threat Assessment. Over the next few years, problems with wing structure fatigue, first noticed in production years earlier, began to come to the fore. Implementation of the maintenance plan was greatly delayed by the base realignment and closure commission (BRAC), which led to 80% of the original workforce being let go.\n\n## Modernization (A-10C)\nFrom 2005 to June 2011, the entire fleet of 356 A-10s and OA-10s were modernized in the Precision Engagement program and redesignated A-10C. Upgrades included all-weather combat capability, an improved fire-control system (FCS), electronic countermeasures (ECM), smart bomb targeting, a modern communications suite including a Link 16 radio and Satcom, and cockpit upgrades comprising two multifunction displays and HOTAS configuration mixing the F-16's flight stick with the F-15's throttle.\n\n# Design\n## Overview\nThe A-10 has a cantilever low-wing monoplane wing with a wide chord. It has superior maneuverability at low speeds and altitude due to its large wing area, high wing aspect ratio, and large ailerons. The wing also allows short takeoffs and landings, permitting operations from austere forward airfields near front lines.\n\n## Survivability\nThe A-10 is battle-hardened to an exceptional degree, being able to survive direct hits from armor-piercing and high-explosive projectiles up to 23 mm. It has double-redundant hydraulic flight systems, and a mechanical system as a backup if hydraulics are lost. Flight without hydraulic power uses the manual reversion control system; pitch and yaw control engages automatically, and roll control is pilot-selected. In manual reversion mode, the A-10 is sufficiently controllable under favorable conditions to return to base, though control forces are greater than normal.\n\n## Weapons\nThe A-10's primary built-in weapon is the 30×173 mm GAU-8/A Avenger autocannon, one of the most powerful aircraft cannons ever flown. The GAU-8 is a hydraulically driven seven-barrel rotary cannon designed for the anti-tank role with a high rate of fire. The original design could be switched by the pilot to 2,100 or 4,200 depleted uranium armor-piercing shells per minute; this was later changed to a fixed rate of 3,900 rounds per minute.\n\n# Operational History\n## Background\nThe A-10 was first deployed in combat during the Gulf War in 1991, with 132 being deployed. A-10s shot down two Iraqi helicopters with the GA-10, the first of which was shot down by Captain Robert Swain over Kuwait on February 6, 1991, for the A-10's first air-to-air victory.\n\n## Gulf War\nAt the beginning of the war, A-10s flew missions against the Iraqi Republican Guard, but due to heavy attrition, from February 15, they were restricted to within 20 nautical miles (37 km) of the southern border. A-10s also flew missions hunting Iraqi Scud missiles. The A-10 had a mission capable rate of 95.7 percent, flew 8,100 sorties, and launched 90 percent of the AGM-65 Maverick missiles fired in the conflict.\n\n## Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and recent deployments\nDuring the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, A-10s did not initially take part. Beginning in March 2002, A-10 squadrons were deployed to Pakistan and Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan, for the campaign against Taliban and Al-Qaeda, known as Operation Anaconda. Afterward, they remained in-country, fighting Taliban and Al Qaeda remnants.\n\n## Future\nThe A-10's future remains a subject of debate. In 2007, the USAF expected it to remain in service until 2028 and possibly later, when it would likely be replaced by the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II. Director of the Straus Military Reform Project of the Project On Government Oversight Winslow Wheeler, a critic of this plan, said that replacing the A-10 with the F-35 would be a \"giant leap backwards\" given the A-10's performance and the F-35's high costs.\n\n# Specifications (A-10C)\nLength: 53 feet 4 inches (16.26 meters)\nWingspan: 57 feet 6 inches (17.53 meters)\nHeight: 14 feet 6 inches (4.42 meters)\nEmpty weight: 16,321 pounds (7,406 kilograms)\nMaximum takeoff weight: 50,000 pounds (22,680 kilograms)\nPowerplant: 2 × General Electric TF34-GE-100 turbofans\nThrust: 9,065 pounds-force (40.3 kilonewtons) each\nMaximum speed: 460 knots (530 mph or 853 km/h)\nRange: 2,200 nautical miles (2,500 miles or 4,000 kilometers)\nService ceiling: 31,000 feet (9,448 meters)\nRate of climb: 3,050 feet per minute (15.5 meters per second)\nGuns: GAU-8/A 30mm 7-barrel Gatling gun\nHardpoints: 11 external hardpoints for mounting ordnance\nMaximum takeoff weight with ordnance: 55,000 pounds (24,947 kilograms)\n\n# Notable Appearances in Media\nThe A-10 Thunderbolt II received its popular nickname \"Warthog\" from the pilots and crews of the USAF attack squadrons who flew and maintained it. The A-10 is the last of Republic's jet attack aircraft to serve with the USAF. The Republic F-84 Thunderjet was nicknamed the \"Hog\", F-84F Thunderstreak nicknamed \"Superhog\", and the Republic F-105 Thunderchief tagged \"Ultra Hog\".\n\n# See also\nAircraft of comparable

2011, [45] the entire fleet of 356 A-10s and OA-10s were modernized in the Precision Engagement program and redesignated A-10C [46] Upgrades included all-weather combat capability, [33] an improved fire-control system (FCS), electronic countermeasures (ECM), smart bomb targeting, a modern communications suite including a Link 16 radio and Satcom, [33] and cockpit upgrades comprising two multifunction displays and HOTAS configuration mixing the F-16's flight stick with the F-15's throttle [47] [48] The Government Accountability Office in 2007 estimated the cost of upgrading, refurbishing, and service life extension plans to total $2.25 billion through 2013 [18] [49] In July 2010, the USAF issued Raytheon a contract to integrate a Helmet Mounted Integrated Targeting (HMIT) system into the A-10C [49] [50] The LASTE system was replaced with the integrated flight and fire control computer (IFFCC) included in the PE upgrade [33]\n\n\nDesign\nThe A-10 has a cantilever low-wing monoplane wing with a wide chord [34] It has superior maneuverability at low speeds and altitude due to its large wing area, high wing aspect ratio, and large ailerons The wing also allows short takeoffs and landings, permitting operations from austere forward airfields near front lines The A-10 can loiter for extended periods and operate under 1,000-foot (300 m) ceilings with 1.5-mile (2.4 km) visibility It typically flies at a relatively low speed of 300 knots (350 mph; 560 km/h), which makes it a better platform for the ground-attack role than fast fighter-bombers, which often have difficulty targeting small, slow-moving targets [55]\n\n\nOverview\nThe A-10 has a cantilever low-wing monoplane wing with a wide chord [34] It has superior maneuverability at low speeds and

pilot-selected In manual reversion mode, the A-10 is sufficiently controllable under favorable conditions to return to base, though control forces are greater than normal It is designed to be able to fly with one engine, half of the tail, one elevator, and half of a wing missing [65] As the A-10 operates close to enemy positions, making it an easy target for man-portable air-defense system (MANPADS), surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), and enemy aircraft, it carries both flares and chaff cartridges [66]\n\n\nWeapons\nThe A-10's primary built-in weapon is the 30×173 mm GAU-8/A Avenger autocannon One of the most powerful aircraft cannons ever flown, the GAU-8 is a hydraulically driven seven-barrel rotary cannon designed for the anti-tank role with a high rate of fire The original design could be switched by the pilot to 2,100 or 4,200 depleted uranium armor-piercing shells per minute; [77] this was later changed to a fixed rate of 3,900 rounds per minute [78] The cannon takes about a half second to spin up to its maximum rate of fire, firing 50 rounds during the first second, and 65 or 70 rounds per second thereafter It is accurate enough to place 80 percent of its shots within a 40-foot (12.4 m) diameter circle from 4,000 feet (1,220 m) while in flight [79] The GAU-8 is optimized for a slant range of 4,000 feet (1,220 m) with the A-10 in a 30-degree dive [80]\n\n\nColors and markings\nAircraft camouflage is used to make the A-10 more difficult to see as it flies low to the ground at subsonic speeds Many types of paint schemes have been tried These have included a \"peanut scheme\" of sand, yellow, and field drab; black and white colors for winter operations; and a tan, green, and brown mixed pattern [85] The most common Cold War-era scheme was the European I woodland camouflage, whose dark green, medium green, and dark gray was meant to blend in with the typical European forest terrain It reflected the assumption that the threat from hostile fighter aircraft outweighed that from ground fire After the 1991 Gulf War, the threat from ground fire was deemed more pressing than the air-to-air threat, leading to the \"Compass Ghost\" scheme with darker gray on top and a lighter gray on the underside of the aircraft [86]\n\n\nOperational history\nThe first unit to receive the A-10 was the 355th Tactical Training Wing, based at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, in March 1976 [89]  The first unit to achieve initial operating capability was the 354th Tactical Fighter Wing at Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, South Carolina, in October 1977 [90]  A-10 deployments followed at bases both at home and abroad, including England AFB, Louisiana; Eielson AFB, Alaska; Osan Air Base, South Korea; and RAF Bentwaters/RAF Woodbridge, England The 81st TFW of RAF Bentwaters/RAF Woodbridge operated rotating detachments of A-10s at four bases in Germany known as Forward Operating Locations (FOLs): Leipheim, Sembach Air Base, Nörvenich Air Base, and RAF Ahlhorn [91] A-10s were initially an unwelcome addition to many in the USAF; most pilots did not want to switch to it as fighter pilots traditionally favored speed and appearance [92] In 1987, many A-10s were shifted to the forward air control (FAC) role and redesignated OA-10 [93] In the FAC role, the OA-10 is typically equipped with up to six pods of 2.75 inch (70 mm) Hydra rockets, usually with smoke or white phosphorus warheads used for target marking OA-10s are physically unchanged and remain fully combat capable despite the redesignation [94]\n\n\nService entry\nThe

two Iraqi helicopters with the GAU-8 cannon The first of these was shot down by Captain Robert Swain over Kuwait on 6 February 1991 for the A-10's first air-to-air victory [99] [100] Four A-10s were shot down during the war by surface-to-air missiles and eleven A-10s were hit by anti-air artillery rounds [101] Another two battle-damaged A-10s and OA-10As returned to base and were written off Some sustained additional damage in crash landings [102] [103] At the beginning of the war, A-10s flew missions against the Iraqi Republican Guard, but due to heavy attrition, from 15 February they were restricted to within 20 nautical miles (37 km) of the southern border [104] [105]  A-10s also flew missions hunting Iraqi Scud missiles  The A-10 had a mission capable rate of 95.7 percent, flew 8,100 sorties, and launched 90 percent of the AGM-65 Maverick missiles fired in the conflict [106] Shortly after the Gulf War, the USAF abandoned the idea of replacing the A-10 with a CAS version of the F-16 [107]\n\n\nAfghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and recent deployments\nDuring the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, A-10s did not initially take part Beginning in March 2002, A-10 squadrons were deployed to

Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II [40] Director of the Straus Military Reform Project of the Project On Government Oversight Winslow Wheeler, a critic of this plan, said that replacing the A-10 with the F-35 would be a \"giant leap backwards\" given the A-10's performance and the F-35's high costs [131] In 2012, the USAF considered the F-35B STOVL variant as a replacement CAS aircraft, but concluded that it could not generate sufficient sorties [132] In August 2013, Congress and the USAF examined various proposals, including the F-35 and the MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial vehicle filling the A-10's role Proponents state that the A-10's armor and cannon are superior to aircraft such as the F-35 for ground attack, that guided munitions could be jammed, and that ground commanders commonly request A-10 support [117]\n\n\nOther uses\nOn 25 March 2010, an A-10 conducted the first flight of an aircraft with all engines powered by a biofuel blend comprising a 1:1 blend of JP-8 and Camelina-based fuel [159] On 28 June 2012, the A-10 became the first aircraft to fly using a new fuel blend derived from alcohol; known as ATJ (Alcohol-to-Jet), the fuel is cellulosic-based and can be produced using wood, paper, grass, or any cellulose-based material, which are fermented into alcohols before being hydro-processed into aviation fuel ATJ is the third alternative fuel to be evaluated by the USAF as a replacement for the petroleum-derived JP-8 fuel Previous types were synthetic paraffinic kerosene derived from coal and natural gas and a bio-mass fuel derived from plant oils and animal fats known as Hydroprocessed Renewable Jet [160]\n\n\nVariants\nThe A-10 has been flown exclusively by the United States Air Force and its Air Reserve components, the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and the Air National Guard (ANG) As of 2017 [update], 282 A-10C aircraft are reported as operational, divided as follows: 141 USAF, 55 AFRC, 86 ANG [172]\n\n\nOperators\nThe A-10 has been flown

Although its release was seen as redundant to Google's existing Google Play Music All Access subscription service, the app was created to cater to the specific needs of music enthusiasts who rely on YouTube for their music content. Since its release, YouTube Music has undergone several updates and improvements, becoming a popular music streaming service in its own right.\n\n**Features**\n\nYouTube Music offers a vast library of music content, with a large collection of songs from mainstream artists.

The free tier allows users to play songs in their music video version, where applicable.

YouTube Music Premium and YouTube Premium subscribers can also switch to an audio-only mode that can play in the background while the application is not in use.\n\nOne of the key benefits of the premium tier is the ability to play music without ads. This means that users can enjoy their music without interruptions, creating a more enjoyable listening experience. Additionally, the premium tier offers a higher audio quality, making it ideal for audiophiles and music enthusiasts who want to enjoy their music in the best possible sound quality.\n\n**Geographic Availability**\n\nAs of March 2024, YouTube Music is available in most of the Americas, Europe, and Oceania, as well as parts of Africa and Asia. The service is available in a total of 119 markets worldwide. However, due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Google has indefinitely suspended all of its payment and subscription-based services in the country, including YouTube Music.\n\nThis suspension is a temporary measure, and Google may resume services in the future. However, until then, users in Ukraine will not have access to YouTube Music or any other Google services that require payment or subscription.\n\n**See Also**\n\nYouTube Premium\nGoogle Play Music All Access\nMusic Streaming Services\nYouTube Music App\n\n**External Links**\n\n* YouTube Music Official Website\n* YouTube Music Wikipedia Page\n* YouTube Music Help Center\n\n**Requirements**\n\nTo use YouTube Music, users must meet certain requirements.

{"title": "Kuwait", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe name \"Kuwait\" is from the Kuwaiti Arabic diminutive form of كوت (Kut or Kout), meaning \"fortress built near water\" [24] The country's official name has been the \"State of Kuwait\" since 1961.\n\n\nHistory\nFollowing the post-glacial flooding of the Persian Gulf basin, debris from the Tigris–Euphrates river formed a substantial delta, creating most of the land in present-day Kuwait and establishing the present coastlines [25] One of the earliest evidence of human habitation in Kuwait dates back to 8000 BC where Mesolithic tools were found in Burgan [26] Historically, most of present-day Kuwait was part of ancient Mesopotamia [27] [28] [29]\n\n\nAntiquity\nFollowing the post-glacial flooding of the Persian Gulf basin, debris from the Tigris–Euphrates river formed a substantial delta, creating most of the land in present-day Kuwait and establishing the present coastlines [25] One of the earliest evidence of human habitation in Kuwait dates back to 8000 BC where Mesolithic tools were found in Burgan [26] Historically, most of present-day Kuwait was part of ancient Mesopotamia [27] [28] [29]\n\n\n1752–1945: Pre-oil\nIn the early to mid 1700s, Kuwait City was a small fishing village Administratively, it was a sheikhdom, ruled by local sheikhs from Bani Khalid clan [91] Sometime in the mid 1700s, the Bani Utbah settled in Kuwait City [92] [93] Sometime after the death of the Bani Khalid's leader Barak bin Abdul Mohsen  [ar] and the fall of the Bani Khalid Emirate, the Utub were able to wrest control of Kuwait as a result of successive matrimonial alliances [93]\n\n\n1946–1980: State-building\nBetween 1946 and 1980, Kuwait experienced a period of prosperity driven by oil and its liberal cultural atmosphere; this period is called the \"golden era of Kuwait\" [122] [123] [124] [125] In 1946, crude oil was exported for the first time In 1950, a major public-work programme began to enable Kuwaiti citizens to enjoy a luxurious standard of living \n\n\n1981–1991: Wars and terrorism\nThe Al Sabah strongly advocated Islamism throughout the 1980s [148] At that time, the most serious threat to the continuity of Al Sabah came from home-grown democrats, [148] who were protesting the 1976 suspension of the parliament [148] The Al Sabah were attracted to Islamists preaching the virtues of a hierarchical order that included loyalty to the Kuwaiti monarchy [148] In 1981, the Kuwaiti government gerrymandered electoral districts in favour of the Islamists [149] [148] Islamists were the government's main allies, hence Islamists were able to dominate state agencies, such as the government ministries [148]\n\n\n1992–present: Present era\nIn the early 1990s, Kuwait deported nearly 400,000 Palestinians [159] Kuwait's policy was a response to alignment of the PLO with Saddam Hussein It was a form of collective punishment Kuwait also deported thousands of Iraqis and Yemenis after the Gulf War [160] [161]\n\n\nGeography\nLocated at the head of the Persian Gulf in the north-east corner of the Arabian Peninsula, Kuwait is one of the smallest countries in the world in terms of land area Kuwait lies between latitudes 28° and 31° N, and longitudes 46° and 49° E Kuwait is generally low-lying, with the highest point being 306 m (1,004 ft) above sea level [14] Mutla Ridge is the highest point in Kuwait.\n\n\nClimate\nDue to Kuwait's proximity to Iraq and Iran, the winter season in Kuwait is colder than other coastal countries in the region (especially UAE, Qatar, and Bahrain) [230] Kuwait is also less humid than other coastal countries in the region The spring season in March is warm with occasional thunderstorms The frequent winds from the northwest are cold in winter and hot in summer Southeasterly damp winds spring up between July and October Hot and dry south winds prevail in spring and early summer The shamal, a northwesterly wind common during June and July, causes dramatic sandstorms [231] Summers in Kuwait are some of the hottest on earth The highest recorded temperature was 54.0 °C (129.2 °F) at Mitribah on 21 July 2016, which is the highest temperature recorded in Asia [232] [233]\n\n\nNature reserves\nAt present, there are five protected areas in Kuwait recognized by the IUCN In response to Kuwait becoming the 169th signatory of the Ramsar Convention, Bubiyan Island's Mubarak al-Kabeer reserve was designated as the country's first Wetland of International Importance [238] The 50,948 ha reserve consists of small lagoons and shallow salt marshes and is important as a stop-over for migrating birds on two migration routes [238] The reserve is home to the world's largest breeding colony of crab-plover [238]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nCurrently, 444 species of birds have been recorded in Kuwait, 18 species of which breed in the country [239] The arfaj is the national flower of Kuwait [240] Due to its location at the head of the Persian Gulf near the mouth of the Tigris–Euphrates river, Kuwait is situated at the crossroads of many major bird migration routes and between two and three million birds pass each year [241] Kuwait's marine and littoral ecosystems contain the bulk of the country's biodiversity heritage [241] The marshes in northern Kuwait and Jahra have become increasingly important as a refuge for passage migrants [241]\n\n\nWater and sanitation\nKuwait is part of the Tigris–Euphrates river system basin [244] [245] [246] [247] [248] [249] Several Tigris–Euphrates confluences form parts of the Kuwait–Iraq border [250] Bubiyan Island is part of the Shatt al-Arab delta [82] Kuwait is partially part of the Mesopotamian Marshes [251] [252] [253] Kuwait does not currently have any permanent rivers within its territory However, Kuwait does have several wadis, the most notable of which is Wadi al-Batin which forms the border between Kuwait and Iraq [254] Kuwait also has several river-like marine channels around Bubiyan Island, most notably Khawr Abd Allah which is now an estuary, but once was the point where the Shatt al-Arab emptied into the Persian Gulf Khawr Abd Allah is located in southern Iraq and northern Kuwait, the Iraq-Kuwait border divides the lower portion of the estuary, but adjacent to the port of Umm Qasr the estuary becomes wholly Iraqi It forms the northeast coastline of Bubiyan Island and the north coastline of Warbah Island [255]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nKuwait is an emirate, [5] which is sometimes described as \"anocratic\" [261] The Polity data series [264] and Economist Democracy Index [265] both categorize Kuwait as an autocracy (dictatorship) Freedom House previously rated the country as \"partly free\" in the Freedom in the World survey [266] The Emir is the head of state, he belongs to the Al Sabah ruling family The political system consists of an appointed government and judiciary The Constitution of Kuwait was promulgated in 1962 [267]\n\n\nPolitical

political system consists of an appointed government and judiciary The Constitution of Kuwait was promulgated in 1962 [267]\n\n\nAl Sabah dynasty\nThe Al Sabah ruling family adhere to the Maliki school of Sunni Islam Article 4 of the Kuwait constitution stipulates that Kuwait is a hereditary emirate whose emir must be an heir of Mubarak Al-Sabah [270] Mubarak had four sons, but an informal pattern of alternation between the descendants of his sons Jabir and Salem emerged since his death in 1915 [285] This pattern of succession had one exception before 2006, when Sheikh Sabah Al-Salim, a son of Salem, was named crown prince to succeed his half-brother Sheikh Abdullah Al-Salem as a consequence of infighting and lack of consensus within the ruling family council [285] The alternating system was resumed when Sheikh Sabah Al-Salim named Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed of the Jabir branch as his crown prince, eventually ruling as Emir for 29 years from 1977 to 2006 [285] On January 15, 2006, Emir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed died and his crown prince, Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah of the Salem branch was named Emir [286] On January 23, 2006, the National Assembly unanimously voted in favor of Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah abdicating in favor of Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmed, citing his illness with a form of dementia [285] Instead of naming a successor from the Salem branch as per convention, Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmed named his half-brother Sheikh Nawaf Al-Ahmed as crown prince and his nephew Sheikh Nasser Al-Mohammed as prime minister [285] On December 16, 2023, Sheikh Nawaf Al-Ahmed Passed away, And Sheikh Mishal Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber would be the successor.\n\n\nForeign relations\nThe foreign affairs of Kuwait are handled at the level of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs The first foreign affairs department bureau was established in 1961 Kuwait became the 111th member state of the United Nations in May 1963 It is a long-standing member of the Arab League and Gulf Cooperation Council.\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Kuwaiti armed forces consist of the Land Forces, the Air Force (including the Air Defense Force), the Navy (including the Coast Guard), the National Guard, and the Emiri Guard, with a total of 17,500 active personnel and 23,700 reservists The Emiri Guard is tasked with the protection of the Emir of Kuwait The National Guard remains independent of the regular armed forces command structure, subordinated directly to the Emir and the prime minister, and is involved in both internal security and external defense The Coast Guard is part of the Ministry of Interior while all of the other branches are part of the Ministry of Defense, and the National Guard provides assistance to both agencies Since 1991 the United States has been the country's main security partner, carrying out training exercises with its military, and Kuwait is also a participant in the Gulf Cooperation Council's Peninsula Shield Force The Kuwaiti military uses American, Russian, and western European equipment [295] [296]\n\n\nLegal system\nKuwait follows the civil law system modeled after the French legal system; [302] [303] [304] Kuwait's legal system is largely secular [305] [306] [307] [308] Sharia law governs only family law for Muslim residents, [306] [309] while non-Muslims in Kuwait have a secular family law For the application of family law, there are three separate court sections: Sunni (Maliki), Shia, and non-Muslim According to the United Nations, Kuwait's legal system is a mix of English common law, French civil law, Egyptian civil law and Islamic law [310]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nKuwait is divided into six governorates: Al Asimah Governorate (or Capital Governorate); Hawalli Governorate; Farwaniya Governorate; Mubarak Al-Kabeer Governorate; Ahmadi Governorate; and Jahra Governorate  The governorates are further subdivided into areas.\n\n\nHuman rights and corruption\nHuman rights in Kuwait has been the subject of significant criticism, particularly regarding the Bedoon (stateless people) [164] [162] [316] [160] The Kuwaiti government's handling of the stateless Bedoon crisis has come under criticism from many human rights organisations and even the United Nations [317] According to Human Rights Watch in 1995, Kuwait has produced 300,000 stateless Bedoon [318] Kuwait has the largest number of stateless people in the entire region [162] [319] Since 1986, the Kuwaiti government has refused to grant any form of documentation to the Bedoon including birth certificates, death certificates, identity cards, marriage certificates, and driving licences [319] [320] The Kuwaiti Bedoon crisis resembles the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar (Burma) [321] According to several human rights organizations, Kuwait is committing ethnic cleansing and genocide against the stateless Bedoon [164] [162] [319] Additionally, LGBT people in Kuwait have few legal protections [322]\n\n\nEconomy\nKuwait has a wealthy petroleum-based economy [334] Kuwait is one of the richest countries in the world [335] [336] [337] [338] The Kuwaiti dinar is the highest-valued unit of currency in the world [339] According to the World Bank, Kuwait is the fifth richest country in the world by gross national income per capita, and one of five nations with a GNI per capita above $70,000 [335]\n\n\nPetroleum and natural gas\nDespite its relatively small territory, Kuwait has proven crude oil reserves of 104 billion barrels, estimated to be 10% of the world's reserves Kuwait also has substantial natural gas reserves All natural resources in the country are state property.\n\n\nSteel manufacturing\nThe biggest non-oil industry is steel manufacturing [361] [362] [363] [364] [365] United Steel Industrial Company (KWT Steel) is Kuwait's main steel manufacturing company, which caters to all of Kuwait's domestic market demands (particularly construction) [362] [361] [363] [364] Kuwait is self-sufficient in steel [362] [361] [363] [364]\n\n\nAgriculture\nIn 2016, Kuwait's food self-sufficiency ratio was 49.5% in vegetables, 38.7% in meat, 12.4% in dairy, 24.9% in fruits, and 0.4% in cereals [366] 8.5% of Kuwait's entire territory consists of agricultural land, although arable land constitutes 0.6% of Kuwait's entire territory [367] [368] Historically, Jahra was a predominantly agricultural area There are currently various farms in Jahra [369]\n\n\nFinance\nThe Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) is Kuwait's largest sovereign wealth fund specializing in foreign investment The KIA is the world's oldest sovereign wealth fund Since 1953, the Kuwaiti government has directed investments into Europe, United States and Asia Pacific In 2021, the holdings were valued at around $700 billion in assets [370] [371] It is

the country, available to members of their insurance schemes As part of Kuwait Vision 2035, many new hospitals recently opened [380] [381] [382] In the years leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, Kuwait invested in its health care system at a rate that was proportionally higher than most other GCC countries [383] Under the Kuwait Vision 2035 healthcare strategy, the public hospital sector significantly increased its capacity [381] [380] [382] Many new hospitals recently opened, Kuwait currently has 20 public hospitals [384] [381] [380] [382] The new Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Hospital is the largest hospital in the Middle East [385] Kuwait also has 16 private hospitals [380]\n\n\nScience and technology\nKuwait was ranked 71st in the Global Innovation Index in 2024 [387] According to the United States Patent and Trademark Office, Kuwait registered 448 patents as of 31 December 2015 [388] [389] [390] [391] In the early to mid 2010s, Kuwait produced the largest number of scientific publications and patents per capita in the region and registered the highest growth regionally [392] [393] [394] [395] [396] [390]\n\n\nSpace and satellite programmes\nKuwait has an emerging space industry which is largely driven by private sector initiatives [399] Seven years after the launch of the world's first communications satellite, Telstar 1, Kuwait in October 1969 inaugurated the first satellite ground station in the Middle East, \"Um Alaish\" [400] The Um Alaish satellite station complex housed several satellite ground stations including Um Alaish 1 (1969), Um Alaish 2 (1977), and Um Alaish 3 (1981) It provided satellite communication services in Kuwait until 1990 when it was destroyed by the Iraqi armed forces during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait [401] In 2019, Kuwait's Orbital Space established an amateur satellite ground station to provide free access to signals from satellites in orbit passing over Kuwait The station was named Um Alaish 4 to continue the legacy of \"Um Alaish\" satellite station [402] Um Alaish 4 is a member of FUNcube distributed ground station network [403] and the Satellite Networked Open Ground Station project (SatNOGS) [404]\n\n\nEducation\nKuwait had the highest literacy rate in the Arab world in 2010 [420] The general education system consists of four levels:  kindergarten (lasting for 2 years), primary (lasting for 5 years), intermediate (lasting for 4 years) and secondary (lasting for 3 years) [421] Schooling at primary and intermediate level is compulsory for all students aged 6 – 14 All the levels of

universities and 14 private universities.\n\n\nTourism\nTourism in Kuwait still remains very limited due to poor infrastructure and the alcohol ban The annual \"Hala Febrayer\" festival somewhat attracts tourists from neighboring GCC countries, [425] and includes a variety of events including music concerts, parades, and carnivals [425] [426] [427] The festival is a month-long commemoration of the liberation of Kuwait, and runs from 1 to 28 February Liberation Day itself is celebrated on 26 February [428]\n\n\nTransport\nKuwait has a modern network of highways Roadways extended 5,749 km (3,572 mi), of which 4,887 km (3,037 mi) is paved There are more than two million passenger cars, and 500,000 commercial taxis, buses, and trucks in use On major highways the maximum speed is 120 km/h (75 mph) Since there is no railway system in the country, most people travel by automobiles.\n\n\nDemographics\nKuwait's 2023 population was 4.82 million people, of which 1.53 million were Kuwaitis and 3.29 million expatriates [17]\n\n\nEthnic groups\nExpatriates in Kuwait account for around 60% of Kuwait's total population At the end of December 2018, 57.65% of Kuwait's total population were

as a business language Besides English, French is taught as a third language for the students of the humanities at schools, but for two years only Kuwaiti Arabic is a variant of Gulf Arabic, sharing similarities with the dialects of neighboring coastal areas in Eastern Arabia [449] Due to immigration during its pre-oil history as well as trade, Kuwaiti Arabic borrowed a lot of words from Persian, Indian languages, Balochi language, Turkish, English and Italian [450]\n\n\nCulture\nKuwaiti popular culture, in the form of theatre, radio, music, and television soap opera, flourishes and is even

Tunisia [471] Kuwait is frequently dubbed the \"Hollywood of the Gulf\" due to the popularity of its television soap operas and theatre [472] [473]\n\n\nVisual arts\nKuwait has the oldest modern arts movement in the Arabian Peninsula [507] [508] [509] Beginning in 1936, Kuwait was the first Gulf Arab country to grant scholarships in the arts [507] The Kuwaiti artist Mojeb al-Dousari was the

[277] Kuwaiti political scientist Ghanim Alnajjar sees these qualities as a manifestation of Kuwaiti society as a whole, whereby in the Gulf Arab region it is \"the least strict about traditions\" [549]\n\n\nMedia\nKuwait produces more newspapers and magazines per capita than its neighbors [550] [551] The state-owned Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) is the largest media house in the country The Ministry of Information regulates the media industry in Kuwait Kuwait's media is annually classified as partly free in the Freedom of Press survey by Freedom House [552] Since 2005, [553] Kuwait has

is a small, oil-rich country located in the Middle East, bordering Iraq to the north and Saudi Arabia to the south. With a population of approximately 4.82 million people, Kuwait is one of the smallest countries in the world, yet it has a significant impact on the global economy and politics.\n\nEtymology\nThe name \"Kuwait\" is derived from the Kuwaiti Arabic diminutive form of \"Kut\" or \"Kout\", meaning \"fortress built near water\". The country's official name has been the \"State of Kuwait\" since 1961.\n\nHistory\nFollowing the post-glacial flooding of the Persian Gulf basin, debris from the Tigris-Euphrates river formed a substantial delta, creating most of the land in present-day Kuwait and establishing the present coastlines. One of the earliest evidence of human habitation in Kuwait dates back to 8000 BC, where Mesolithic tools were found in Burgan. Historically, most of present-day Kuwait was part of ancient Mesopotamia.\n\nAntiquity\nFollowing the post-glacial flooding of the Persian Gulf basin, debris from the Tigris-Euphrates river formed a substantial delta, creating most of the land in present-day Kuwait and establishing the present coastlines. One of the earliest evidence of human habitation in Kuwait dates back to 8000 BC, where Mesolithic tools were found in Burgan. Historically, most of present-day Kuwait was part of ancient Mesopotamia.\n\n1752–1945: Pre-oil\nIn the early to mid 1700s, Kuwait City was a small fishing village. Administratively, it was a sheikhdom, ruled by local sheikhs from the Bani Khalid clan. Sometime in the mid 1700s, the Bani Utbah settled in Kuwait City. Sometime after the death of the Bani Khalid's leader Barak bin Abdul Mohsen and the fall of the Bani Khalid Emirate, the Utub were able to wrest control of Kuwait as a result of successive matrimonial alliances.\n\n1946–1980: State-building\nBetween 1946 and 1980, Kuwait experienced a period of prosperity driven by oil and its liberal cultural atmosphere; this period is called the \"golden era of Kuwait\". In 1946, crude oil was exported for the first time. In 1950, a major public-work programme began to enable Kuwaiti citizens to enjoy a luxurious standard of living.\n\n1981–1991: Wars and terrorism\nThe Al Sabah strongly advocated Islamism throughout the 1980s. At that time, the most serious threat to the continuity of Al Sabah came from home-grown democrats, who were protesting the 1976 suspension of the parliament. The Al Sabah were attracted to Islamists preaching the virtues of a hierarchical order that included loyalty to the Kuwaiti monarchy. In 1981, the Kuwaiti government gerrymandered electoral districts in favor of the Islamists. Islamists were the government's main allies, hence Islamists were able to dominate state agencies, such as the government ministries.\n\n1992–present: Present era\nIn the early 1990s, Kuwait deported nearly 400,000 Palestinians. Kuwait's policy was a response to alignment of the PLO with Saddam Hussein. It was a form of collective punishment. Kuwait also deported thousands of Iraqis and Yemenis after the Gulf War.\n\nGeography\nLocated at the head of the Persian Gulf in the north-east corner of the Arabian Peninsula, Kuwait is one of the smallest countries in the world in terms of land area. Kuwait lies between latitudes 28° and 31° N, and longitudes 46° and 49° E. Kuwait is generally low-lying, with the highest point being 306 m (1,004 ft) above sea level. Mutla Ridge is the highest point in Kuwait.\n\nClimate\nDue to Kuwait's proximity to Iraq and Iran, the winter season in Kuwait is colder than other coastal countries in the region (especially UAE, Qatar, and Bahrain). Kuwait is also less humid than other coastal countries in the region. The spring season in March is warm with occasional thunderstorms. The frequent winds from the northwest are cold in winter and hot in summer. Southeasterly damp winds spring up between July and October. Hot and dry south winds prevail in spring and early summer. The shamal, a northwesterly wind common during June and July, causes dramatic sandstorms. Summers in Kuwait are some of the hottest on earth. The highest recorded temperature was 54.0°C (129.2°F) at Mitribah on 21 July 2016, which is the highest temperature recorded in Asia.\n\nNature reserves\nAt present, there are five protected areas in Kuwait recognized by the IUCN. In response to Kuwait becoming the 169th signatory of the Ramsar Convention, Bubiyan Island's Mubarak al-Kabeer reserve was designated as the country's first Wetland of International Importance. The 50,948 ha reserve consists of small lagoons and shallow salt marshes and is important as a stop-over for migrating birds on two migration routes. The reserve is home to the world's largest breeding colony of crab-plover.\n\nBiodiversity\nCurrently, 444 species of birds have been recorded in Kuwait, 18 species of which breed in the country. The arfaj is the national flower of Kuwait. Due to its location at the head of the Persian Gulf near the mouth of the Tigris-Euphrates river, Kuwait is situated at the crossroads of many major bird migration routes and between two and three million birds pass each year. Kuwait's marine and littoral ecosystems contain the bulk of the country's biodiversity heritage. The marshes in northern Kuwait and Jahra have become increasingly important as a refuge for passage migrants.\n\nWater and sanitation\nKuwait is part of the Tigris-Euphrates river system basin. Several Tigris-Euphrates confluences form parts of the Kuwait-Iraq border. Bubiyan Island is part of the Shatt al-Arab delta. Kuwait is partially part of the Mesopotamian Marshes. Kuwait does not currently have any permanent rivers within its territory. However, Kuwait does have several wadis, the most notable of which is Wadi al-Batin which forms the border between Kuwait and Iraq. Kuwait also has several river-like marine channels around Bubiyan Island, most notably Khawr Abd Allah which is now an estuary, but once was the point where the Shatt al-Arab emptied into the Persian Gulf. Khawr Abd Allah is located in southern Iraq and northern Kuwait, the Iraq-Kuwait border divides the lower portion of the estuary, but adjacent to the port of Umm Qasr the estuary becomes wholly Iraqi. It forms the northeast coastline of Bubiyan Island and the north coastline of Warbah Island.\n\nGovernment and politics\nKuwait is an emirate, which is sometimes described as \"anocratic\". The Polity data series and Economist Democracy Index both categorize Kuwait as an autocracy (dictatorship). Freedom House previously rated the country as \"partly free\" in the Freedom in the World survey. The Emir is the head of state, he belongs to the Al Sabah ruling family. The political system consists of an appointed government and judiciary. The Constitution of Kuwait was promulgated in 1962.\n\nAl Sabah dynasty\nThe Al Sabah ruling family adhere to the Maliki school of Sunni Islam. Article 4 of the Kuwait constitution stipulates that Kuwait is a hereditary emirate whose emir must be an heir of Mubarak Al-Sabah. Mubarak had four sons, but an informal pattern of alternation between the descendants of his sons Jabir and Salem emerged since his death in 1915. This pattern of succession had one exception before 2006, when Sheikh Sabah Al-Salim, a son of Salem, was named crown prince to succeed his half-brother Sheikh Abdullah Al-Salem as a consequence of infighting and lack of consensus within the ruling family council. The alternating system was resumed when Sheikh Sabah Al-Salim named Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed of the Jabir branch as his crown prince, eventually ruling as Emir for 29 years from 1977 to 2006. On January 15, 2006, Emir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed died and his crown prince, Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah of the Salem branch was named Emir. On January 23, 2006, the National Assembly unanimously voted in favor of Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah abdicating in favor of Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmed, citing his illness with a form of dementia. Instead of naming a successor from the Salem branch as per convention, Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmed named his half-brother Sheikh Nawaf Al-Ahmed as crown prince and his nephew Sheikh Nasser Al-Mohammed as prime minister. On December 16, 2023, Sheikh Nawaf Al-Ahmed Passed away, And Sheikh Mishal Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber would be the successor.\n\nForeign relations\nThe foreign affairs of Kuwait are handled at the level of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The first foreign affairs department bureau was established in 1961. Kuwait became the 111th member state of the United Nations in May 1963. It is a long-standing member of the Arab League and Gulf Cooperation Council.\n\nMilitary\nThe Kuwaiti armed forces consist of the Land Forces, the Air Force (including the Air Defense Force), the Navy (including the Coast Guard), the National Guard, and the Emiri Guard, with a total of 17,500 active personnel and 23,700 reservists. The Emiri Guard is tasked with the protection of the Emir of Kuwait. The National Guard remains independent of the regular armed forces command structure, subordinated directly to the Emir and the prime minister, and is involved in both internal security and external defense. The Coast Guard is part of the Ministry of Interior while all of the other branches are part of the Ministry of Defense, and the National Guard provides assistance to both agencies. Since 1991 the United States has been the country's main security partner, carrying out training exercises with its military, and Kuwait is also a participant in the Gulf Cooperation Council's Peninsula Shield Force. The Kuwaiti military uses American, Russian, and western European equipment.\n\nLegal system\nKuwait follows the civil law system modeled after the French legal system. Kuwait's legal system is largely secular. Sharia law governs only family law for Muslim residents, while non-Muslims in Kuwait have a secular family law. For the application of family law, there are three separate court sections: Sunni (Maliki), Shia, and non-Muslim. According to the United Nations, Kuwait's legal system is a mix of English common law, French civil law, Egyptian civil law, and Islamic law.\n\nAdministrative divisions\nKuwait is divided into six governorates: Al Asimah Governorate (or Capital Governorate); Hawalli Governorate; Farwaniya Governorate; Mubarak Al-Kabeer Governorate; Ahmadi Governorate; and Jahra Governorate. The governorates are further subdivided into areas.\n\nHuman rights and corruption\nHuman rights in Kuwait has been the subject of significant criticism, particularly regarding the Bedoon (stateless people). The Kuwaiti government's handling of the stateless Bedoon crisis has come under criticism from many human rights organizations and even the United Nations. According to Human Rights Watch in 1995, Kuwait has produced 300,000 stateless Bedoon. Kuwait has the largest number of stateless people in the entire region. Since 1986, the Kuwaiti government has refused to grant any form of documentation to the Bedoon, including birth certificates, death certificates, identity cards, marriage certificates, and driving licenses. The Kuwaiti Bedoon crisis resembles the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar (Burma). According to several human rights organizations, Kuwait is committing ethnic cleansing and genocide against the stateless Bedoon. Additionally, LGBT people in Kuwait have few legal protections.\n\nEconomy\nKuwait has a wealthy petroleum-based economy. Kuwait is one of the richest countries in the world. The Kuwaiti dinar is the highest-valued unit of currency in the world. According to the World Bank, Kuwait is the fifth richest country in the world by gross national income per capita, and one of five nations with a GNI per capita above $70,000.\n\nPetroleum and natural gas\nDespite its relatively small territory, Kuwait has proven crude oil reserves of 104 billion barrels, estimated to be 10% of the world's reserves. Kuwait also has substantial natural gas reserves. All natural resources in the country are state property.\n\nSteel manufacturing\nThe biggest non-oil industry is steel manufacturing. United Steel Industrial Company (KWT Steel) is Kuwait's main steel manufacturing company, which caters to all of Kuwait's domestic market demands (particularly construction). Kuwait is self-sufficient in steel.\n\nAgriculture\nIn 2016, Kuwait's food self-sufficiency ratio was 49.5% in vegetables, 38.7% in meat, 12.4% in dairy, 24.9% in fruits, and 0.4% in cereals. 8.5% of Kuwait's entire territory consists of agricultural land, although arable land constitutes 0.6% of Kuwait's entire territory. Historically, Jahra was a predominantly agricultural area. There are currently various farms in Jahra.\n\nFinance\nThe Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) is Kuwait's largest sovereign wealth fund specializing in foreign investment. The KIA is the world's oldest sovereign wealth fund. Since 1953, the Kuwaiti government has directed investments into Europe, United States, and Asia Pacific. In 2021, the holdings were valued at around $700 billion in assets. It is the 3rd largest sovereign wealth fund in the world.\n\nHealth\nKuwait has a state-funded healthcare system, which provides treatment without charge to Kuwaiti nationals. There are outpatient clinics in every residential area in Kuwait. A public insurance scheme exists to provide reduced cost healthcare to expatriates. Private healthcare providers also run medical facilities in the country, available to members of their insurance schemes. As part of Kuwait Vision 2035, many new hospitals recently opened. In the years leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, Kuwait invested in its healthcare system at a rate that was proportionally higher than most other GCC countries. Under the Kuwait Vision 2035 healthcare strategy, the public hospital sector significantly increased its capacity. Many new hospitals recently opened, Kuwait currently has 20 public hospitals. The new Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Hospital is the largest hospital in the Middle East. Kuwait also has 16 private hospitals.\n\nScience and technology\nKuwait was ranked 71st in the Global Innovation Index in 2024. According to the United States Patent and Trademark Office, Kuwait registered 448 patents as of 31 December 2015. In the early to mid-2010s, Kuwait produced the largest number of scientific publications and patents per capita in the region and registered the highest growth regionally. Kuwait has an emerging space industry which is largely driven by private sector initiatives. Seven years after the launch of the world's first communications satellite, Telstar 1, Kuwait in October 1969 inaugurated the first satellite ground station in the Middle East, \"Um Alaish\". The Um Alaish satellite station complex housed several satellite ground stations including Um Alaish 1 (1969), Um Alaish 2 (1977), and Um Alaish 3 (1981). It provided satellite communication services in Kuwait until 1990 when it was destroyed by the Iraqi armed forces during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. In 2019, Kuwait's Orbital Space established an amateur satellite ground station to provide free access to signals from satellites in orbit passing over Kuwait. The station was named Um Alaish 4 to continue the legacy of \"Um Alaish\" satellite station. Um Alaish 4 is a member of FUNcube distributed ground station network and the Satellite Networked Open Ground Station project (SatNOGS).\n\nEducation\nKuwait had the highest literacy rate in the Arab world in 2010. The general education system consists of four levels: kindergarten (lasting for 2 years), primary (lasting for 5 years), intermediate (lasting for 4 years), and secondary (lasting for 3 years). Schooling at primary and intermediate level is compulsory for all students aged 6 – 14. All the levels of state education, including higher education, are free. The public education system is undergoing a revamp due to a project in conjunction with the World Bank. There are two public universities and 14 private universities.\n\nTourism\nTourism in Kuwait still remains very limited due to poor infrastructure and the alcohol ban. The annual \"Hala Febrayer\" festival somewhat attracts tourists from neighboring GCC countries, and includes a variety of events including music concerts, parades, and carnivals. The festival is a month-long commemoration of the liberation of Kuwait, and runs from 1 to 28 February. Liberation Day itself is celebrated on 26 February.\n\nTransport\nKuwait has a modern network of highways. Roadways extended 5,749 km (3,572 mi), of which 4,887 km (3,037 mi) is paved. There are more than two million passenger cars, and 500,000 commercial taxis, buses, and trucks in use. On major highways the maximum speed is 120 km/h (75 mph). Since there is no railway system in the country, most people travel by automobiles.\n\nDemographics\nKuwait's 2023 population was 4.82 million people, of which 1.53 million were Kuwaitis and 3.29 million expatriates.\n\nEthnic groups\nExpatriates in Kuwait account for around 60% of Kuwait's total population. At the end of December 2018, 57.65% of Kuwait's total population were Arabs (including Arab expats). Indians and Egyptians are the largest expat communities respectively.\n\nReligion\nKuwait's official state religion is Maliki Sunni Islam. The Al Sabah ruling family adhere to the Maliki school of Sunni Islam. Most Kuwaiti citizens are Muslim; there is no official national census but it is estimated that 60%–70% are Sunni and 30%–40% are Shia. Kuwait also has a large community of expatriate Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, and Sikhs. As of 2020, there are an estimated 837,585 Christians, comprising 17.93% of the population – the second largest religious group. Most Christians in Kuwait are from Kerala in India, namely Malankara Orthodox, Mar Thoma, and Roman Catholic. The first Malankara Orthodox parish was St Thomas Indian Orthodox Pazhayapally Ahmadi, established in 1934. Kuwait is the only GCC country besides Bahrain to have a local Christian population who hold citizenship. A small number of Kuwaiti citizens follow the Baháʼí Faith.\n\nLanguages\nKuwait's official language is Modern Standard Arabic, but its everyday usage is limited to journalism and education. Kuwaiti Arabic is the variant of Arabic used in everyday life. Besides English, French is taught as a third language for the students of the humanities at schools, but for two years only. Kuwaiti Arabic is a variant of Gulf Arabic, sharing similarities with the dialects of neighboring coastal areas in Eastern Arabia. Due to immigration during its pre-oil history as well as trade, Kuwaiti Arabic", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Kuwait\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe name \"Kuwait\" is from the Kuwaiti Arabic diminutive form of كوت (Kut or Kout), meaning \"fortress built near water\" [24] The country's official name has been the \"State of Kuwait\" since 1961.\n\n\nHistory\nFollowing the post-glacial flooding of the Persian Gulf basin, debris from the Tigris–Euphrates river formed a substantial delta, creating most of the land in present-day Kuwait and establishing the present coastlines [25] One of the earliest evidence of human habitation in Kuwait dates back to 8000 BC where Mesolithic tools were found in Burgan [26] Historically, most of present-day Kuwait was part of ancient Mesopotamia [27] [28] [29]\n\n\nAntiquity\nFollowing the post-glacial flooding of the Persian Gulf basin, debris from the

period is called the \"golden era of Kuwait\" [122] [123] [124] [125] In 1946, crude oil was exported for the first time In 1950, a major public-work programme began to enable Kuwaiti citizens to enjoy a luxurious standard of living \n\n\n1981–1991: Wars and terrorism\nThe Al Sabah strongly advocated Islamism throughout the 1980s [148] At that time, the most serious threat to the continuity of Al Sabah came from home-grown democrats, [148] who were protesting the 1976 suspension of the parliament [148] The Al Sabah were attracted to Islamists preaching the virtues of a hierarchical order that included loyalty to the Kuwaiti monarchy [148] In 1981, the Kuwaiti government gerrymandered electoral districts in favour of the Islamists [149] [148] Islamists were the government's main allies, hence Islamists were able to dominate state agencies, such as the government ministries [148]\n\n\n1992–present: Present era\nIn the early 1990s, Kuwait deported nearly 400,000 Palestinians

Um Alaish 3 (1981) It provided satellite communication services in Kuwait until 1990 when it was destroyed by the Iraqi armed forces during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait [401] In 2019, Kuwait's Orbital Space established an amateur satellite ground station to provide free access to signals from satellites in orbit passing over Kuwait The station was named Um Alaish 4 to continue the legacy of \"Um Alaish\" satellite station [402] Um Alaish 4 is a member of FUNcube distributed ground station network [403] and the Satellite Networked Open Ground Station project (SatNOGS) [404]\n\n\nEducation\nKuwait had the highest literacy rate in the Arab world in 2010 [420] The general education system consists of four levels:  kindergarten (lasting for 2 years), primary (lasting for 5 years), intermediate (lasting for 4 years) and secondary (lasting for 3 years) [421] Schooling at primary and intermediate level is compulsory for all students aged 6 – 14 All the levels of state education, including higher education, are free [422] The public education system is undergoing a revamp due to a project in conjunction with the World Bank [423] [424]\nThere are two public universities and 14 private universities.\n\n\nTourism\nTourism in Kuwait still remains very limited due to poor infrastructure and the alcohol ban The annual \"Hala Febrayer\" festival somewhat attracts tourists from neighboring GCC countries, [425] and includes a variety of events including music concerts, parades, and carnivals [425] [426] [427] The festival is a month-long commemoration of the liberation of Kuwait, and runs from 1 to 28 February Liberation Day itself is celebrated on 26 February [428]\n\n\nTransport\nKuwait has a modern network of highways Roadways extended 5,749 km

as a business language Besides English, French is taught as a third language for the students of the humanities at schools, but for two years only Kuwaiti Arabic is a variant of Gulf Arabic, sharing similarities with the dialects of neighboring coastal areas in Eastern Arabia [449] Due to immigration during its pre-oil history as well as trade, Kuwaiti Arabic borrowed a lot of words from Persian, Indian languages, Balochi language, Turkish, English and Italian [450]\n\n\nCulture\nKuwaiti popular culture, in the form of theatre, radio, music, and television soap opera, flourishes and is even exported to neighboring states [23] [460] Within the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, the culture of Kuwait is the closest to the culture of Bahrain; this is evident in the close association between the two states in theatrical productions and soap operas [461]\n\n\nPerforming arts\nKuwait has the oldest performing arts industry in the Arabian Peninsula [462] Kuwait's television drama industry is the largest and most active Gulf Arab drama industry and annually produces a minimum of fifteen serials [463] [464] [465] Kuwait is the main production center of the Gulf television drama and comedy

operas are most popular during the time of Ramadan, when families gather to break their fast [470] Although usually performed in the Kuwaiti dialect, they have been shown with success as far away as Tunisia [471] Kuwait is frequently dubbed the \"Hollywood of the Gulf\" due to the popularity of its television soap operas and theatre [472] [473]\n\n\nVisual arts\nKuwait has the oldest modern arts movement in the Arabian Peninsula [507] [508] [509] Beginning in 1936, Kuwait was the first Gulf Arab country to grant scholarships in the arts [507] The Kuwaiti artist Mojeb al-Dousari was the

venues including Sheikh Abdullah Al Salem Cultural Centre, Sheikh Jaber Al Ahmad Cultural Centre, Al Shaheed Park, and Al Salam Palace [434] [433] With a capital cost of more than US$1 billion, it is one of the largest cultural districts in the world [434] The Abdullah Salem Cultural Centre is the largest museum complex in the Middle East [527] [528] The Kuwait National Cultural District is a member of the Global Cultural Districts Network [437]\n\n\nSociety\nUrban Kuwaiti society is more open than other Gulf Arab societies [542] Kuwaiti citizens are ethnically diverse, consisting of both Arabs and Persians ('Ajam) [543] [544] [545] Kuwait stands out in the region as the most liberal in empowering women in the public sphere [546] [547] [548] Kuwaiti women outnumber men in the workforce [277] Kuwaiti political scientist Ghanim Alnajjar sees these qualities as a manifestation of Kuwaiti society as a whole, whereby in the Gulf Arab region it is \"the least strict about traditions\" [549]\n\n\nMedia\nKuwait produces more newspapers and magazines per capita than its neighbors [550] [551] The state-owned Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) is the largest media house in the country The Ministry of Information regulates the media industry in Kuwait Kuwait's media is annually classified as partly free in the Freedom of Press survey by Freedom House [552] Since 2005, [553] Kuwait has frequently earned the highest ranking of all Arab countries in the annual Press Freedom Index by Reporters Without Borders [554] [555] [556] [557] [558] [559] [560] [561] [562] In 2009, 2011, 2013 and 2014, Kuwait surpassed Israel as the country with the greatest press freedom in the Middle East [554] [555] [556] [557] [561] Kuwait is also frequently ranked as the Arab country with the greatest press freedom in Freedom House's annual Freedom of Press survey [563] [564] [565] [566] [567] [568] [569]\n\n\nLiterature\nKuwait has in recent years produced several prominent contemporary writers

{"title": "Monaco", "content": "\nHistory\nMonaco's name comes from the nearby 6th-century BC Phocaean Greek colony Referred to by the Ligurians as Monoikos, from the Greek \"μόνοικος\", \"single house\", from \"μόνος\" (monos) \"alone, single\" [26] + \"οἶκος\" (oikos) \"house\" [27] According to an ancient myth, Hercules passed through the Monaco area and turned away the previous gods [28] As a result, a temple was constructed there Because this \"House\" of Hercules was the only temple in the area, the city was called Monoikos [29] [30] It ended up in the hands of the Holy Roman Empire, which gave it to the Genoese [clarification needed]\n\n\nArrival of the Grimaldi family\nFollowing a grant of land from Emperor Henry VI in 1191, Monaco was refounded in 1215 as a colony of Genoa [31] [32] Monaco was first ruled by a member of the House of Grimaldi in 1297, when Francesco Grimaldi, known as \"Malizia\" (translated from Italian either as \"The Malicious One\" or \"The Cunning One\"), and his men captured the fortress protecting the Rock of Monaco while dressed as Franciscan friars – a monaco in Italian – although this is a coincidence as the area was already known by this name [33]\n\n\n1400–1800\nIn 1419, the Grimaldi family purchased Monaco from the Crown of Aragon and became the official and undisputed rulers of \"the Rock of Monaco\" In 1612, Honoré II began to style himself \"Prince\" of Monaco [36] In the 1630s, he sought French protection against the Spanish forces and, in 1642, was received at the court of Louis XIII as a \"duc et pair étranger\" [37]\n\n\n19th century\nIn 1793, Revolutionary forces captured Monaco and until 1814 it was occupied by the French (in this period much of Europe had been overrun by the French armies under the command of Napoleon Bonaparte) [37] [39] The principality was reestablished in 1814 under the Grimaldis It was designated a protectorate of the Kingdom of Sardinia by the Congress of Vienna in 1815 [39] Monaco remained in this position until 1860 when, by the Treaty of Turin, the Sardinian forces pulled out of the principality; the surrounding County of Nice (as well as Savoy) was ceded to France [40] Monaco became a French protectorate once again Italian was the official language in Monaco until 1860, when it was replaced by French [41]\n\n\n20th century\nUntil the Monégasque Revolution of 1910 forced the adoption of the 1911 Constitution of Monaco, the princes of Monaco were absolute rulers [46] The new constitution slightly reduced the autocratic rule of the Grimaldi family and Prince Albert I suspended it during the First World War.\n\n\n21st century\nIn 2002, a new treaty between France and Monaco specified that, should there be no heirs to carry on the Grimaldi dynasty, the principality would still remain an independent nation rather than revert to France Monaco's military defense is still the responsibility of France [53] [54]\n\n\nGovernment\nMonaco has been governed under a constitutional monarchy since 1911, with the Sovereign Prince of Monaco as head of state [67] The executive branch consists of a Prime Minister as the head of government, who presides over the other five members of the Council of Government [68] Until 2002, the Prime Minister was a French citizen appointed by the prince from among candidates proposed by the Government of France; since a constitutional amendment in 2002, the Prime Minister can be French or Monégasque [31] On 2 September 2024, Prince Albert II appointed a French citizen, Didier Guillaume, to the office.\n\n\nPolitics\nMonaco has been governed under a constitutional monarchy since 1911, with the Sovereign Prince of Monaco as head of state [67] The executive branch consists of a Prime Minister as the head of government, who presides over the other five members of the Council of Government [68] Until 2002, the Prime Minister was a French citizen appointed by the prince from among candidates proposed by the Government of France; since a constitutional amendment in 2002, the Prime Minister can be French or Monégasque [31] On 2 September 2024, Prince Albert II appointed a French citizen, Didier Guillaume, to the office.\n\n\nSecurity\nThe wider defence of the nation is provided by France Monaco has no navy or air force, but on both a per-capita and per-area basis, Monaco has one of the largest police forces (515 police officers for about 38,000 people) and police presences in the world [77] Its police includes a special unit which operates patrol and surveillance boats jointly with the military Police forces in Monaco are commanded by a French officer [78]\n\n\nGeography\nMonaco is a sovereign city-state, with five quarters and ten wards, [82] located on the French Riviera in Western Europe It is bordered by France's Alpes-Maritimes department on three sides, with one side bordering the Mediterranean Sea Its centre is about 16 km (9.9 mi) from Italy and only 13 km (8.1 mi) northeast of Nice [52]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nMonaco is the second-smallest country by area in the world; only Vatican City is smaller [99] Monaco is the most densely populated country in the world [100] The state consists of only one municipality (commune), the Municipality of Monaco There is no geographical distinction between the State and City of Monaco, although responsibilities of the government (state-level) and of the municipality (city-level) are different [101] According to the constitution of 1911, the principality was subdivided into three municipalities: [102]\n\n\nTraditional quarters and modern geographic areas\nThe four traditional quartiers of Monaco are Monaco-Ville, La Condamine, Monte Carlo and Fontvieille [108] The suburb of Moneghetti, the high-level part of La Condamine, is generally seen today as an effective fifth Quartier of Monaco, having a very distinct atmosphere and topography when compared with low-level La Condamine [109]\n\n\nWards\nFor town planning purposes, a sovereign ordinance in 1966 divided the principality into reserved sectors, \"whose current character must be preserved\", and wards The number and boundaries of these sectors and wards have been modified several times The latest division dates from 2013 and created two reserved sectors and seven wards A new 6-hectare district, Le Portier, is currently being built on the sea.\n\n\nArchitecture\nMonaco exhibits a wide range of architecture, but the principality's signature style, particularly in Monte Carlo, is that of the Belle Époque It finds its most florid expression in the 1878–9 Casino and the Salle Garnier created by Charles Garnier and Jules Dutrou Decorative elements include turrets, balconies, pinnacles, multi-coloured ceramics, and caryatids These were blended to create a picturesque fantasy of pleasure and luxury, and an alluring expression of how Monaco sought and still seeks, to portray itself [112] This capriccio of French, Italian, and Spanish elements were incorporated into hacienda villas and apartments Following major development in the 1970s, Prince Rainier III banned high-rise development in the principality His successor, Prince Albert II, overturned this Sovereign Order [113] In recent years [when?] the accelerating demolition of Monaco's architectural heritage, including its single-family villas, has created dismay [114] The principality has no heritage protection legislation [115]\n\n\nClimate\nMonaco has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: Csa), with strong maritime influences, with some resemblances to the humid subtropical climate (Cfa) As a result, it has balmy warm, dry summers and mild, rainy winters The winters are very mild considering the city's latitude, being as mild as locations located much further south in the Mediterranean Basin [116] Cool and rainy interludes can interrupt the dry summer season, the average length of which is also shorter Summer afternoons are infrequently hot (indeed, temperatures greater than 30 °C or 86 °F are rare) as the atmosphere is temperate because of constant sea breezes On the other hand, the nights are very mild, due to the fairly high temperature of the sea in summer Generally, temperatures do not drop below 20 °C (68 °F) in this season In the winter, frosts and snowfalls are extremely rare and generally occur once or twice every ten years [117] [118] On 27 February 2018, both Monaco and Monte Carlo experienced snowfall [119]\n\n\nEconomy\nMonaco has the world's highest GDP nominal per capita at US$185,742, GDP PPP per capita at $132,571 and GNI per capita at $183,150 [123] [124] [125] It also has an unemployment rate of 2%, [126] with over 48,000 workers who commute from France and Italy each day [90] According to the CIA World Factbook, Monaco has the world's lowest poverty rate [127] and the highest number of millionaires and billionaires per capita in the world [128] For the fourth year in a row, Monaco in 2012 had the world's most expensive real estate market, at $58,300 per square metre [129] [130] [131] Although the average price went down in 2020, to an average price of $53,378 per square metre, Monaco remains one of the most expensive places in the world to buy property [132]\nThe world's most expensive apartment is located in Monaco, a penthouse at the Odeon Tower valued at $335 million according to Forbes in 2016 [133]\n\n\nGambling industry\nThe plan for casino gambling was drafted during the reign of Florestan I in 1846 Under Louis-Philippe's petite-bourgeois regime a dignitary such as the Prince of Monaco was not allowed to operate a gambling house [31] All this changed in the dissolute Second French Empire under Napoleon III The House of Grimaldi was in dire need of money.\n\n\nLow taxes\nMonaco has a 20% VAT plus high social-insurance taxes, payable by both employers and employees The employers' contributions are between 28% and 40% (averaging 35%) of gross salary, including benefits, and employees pay a further 10% to 14% (averaging 13%) [143]\n\n\nNumismatics\nMonaco issued its own coins in various devaluations connected to the écu already in the seventeenth century, but its first decimal coins of the Monégasque franc were issued in 1837 continued until 2001.\n\n\nDemographics\nPopulation of Monaco by nationality\n\n\nLanguage\nThe main and official language of Monaco is French, while Italian is spoken by the principality's sizeable community from

located on the French Riviera in Western Europe. It is the second-smallest country in the world by area, with a total area of approximately 2 square kilometers (0.77 square miles). Monaco is a popular tourist destination, known for its beautiful beaches, mild climate, and luxurious casinos.\n\n**History**\n\nMonaco's name comes from the nearby 6th-century BC Phocaean Greek colony Referred to by the Ligurians as Monoikos, from the Greek \"μόνοικος\", \"single house\", from \"μόνος\" (monos) \"alone, single\" [26] + \"οἶκος\" (oikos) \"house\" [27] According to an ancient myth, Hercules passed through the Monaco area and turned away the previous gods [28] As a result, a temple was constructed there Because this \"House\" of Hercules was the only temple in the area, the city was called Monoikos [29] [30] It ended up in the hands of the Holy Roman Empire, which gave it to the Genoese [clarification needed]\n\nArrival of the Grimaldi family\nFollowing a grant of land from Emperor Henry VI in 1191, Monaco was refounded in 1215 as a colony of Genoa [31] [32] Monaco was first ruled by a member of the House of Grimaldi in 1297, when Francesco Grimaldi, known as \"Malizia\" (translated from Italian either as \"The Malicious One\" or \"The Cunning One\"), and his men captured the fortress protecting the Rock of Monaco while dressed as Franciscan friars – a monaco in Italian – although this is a coincidence as the area was already known by this name [33]\n\n1400–1800\nIn 1419, the Grimaldi family purchased Monaco from the Crown of Aragon and became the official and undisputed rulers of \"the Rock of Monaco\" In 1612, Honoré II began to style himself \"Prince\" of Monaco [36] In the 1630s, he sought French protection against the Spanish forces and, in 1642, was received at the court of Louis XIII as a \"duc et pair étranger\" [37]\n\n19th century\nIn 1793, Revolutionary forces captured Monaco and until 1814 it was occupied by the French (in this period much of Europe had been overrun by the French armies under the command of Napoleon Bonaparte) [37] [39] The principality was reestablished in 1814 under the Grimaldis It was designated a protectorate of the Kingdom of Sardinia by the Congress of Vienna in 1815 [39] Monaco remained in this position until 1860 when, by the Treaty of Turin, the Sardinian forces pulled out of the principality; the surrounding County of Nice (as well as Savoy) was ceded to France [40] Monaco became a French protectorate once again Italian was the official language in Monaco until 1860, when it was replaced by French [41]\n\n20th century\nUntil the Monégasque Revolution of 1910 forced the adoption of the 1911 Constitution of Monaco, the princes of Monaco were absolute rulers [46] The new constitution slightly reduced the autocratic rule of the Grimaldi family and Prince Albert I suspended it during the First World War\n\n21st century\nIn 2002, a new treaty between France and Monaco specified that, should there be no heirs to carry on the Grimaldi dynasty, the principality would still remain an independent nation rather than revert to France Monaco's military defense is still the responsibility of France [53] [54]\n\n**Government**\n\nMonaco has been governed under a constitutional monarchy since 1911, with the Sovereign Prince of Monaco as head of state [67] The executive branch consists of a Prime Minister as the head of government, who presides over the other five members of the Council of Government [68] Until 2002, the Prime Minister was a French citizen appointed by the prince from among candidates proposed by the Government of France; since a constitutional amendment in 2002, the Prime Minister can be French or Monégasque [31] On 2 September 2024, Prince Albert II appointed a French citizen, Didier Guillaume, to the office\n\n**Politics**\n\nMonaco has been governed under a constitutional monarchy since 1911, with the Sovereign Prince of Monaco as

Monégasque [31]\n\n**Security**\n\nThe wider defence of the nation is provided by France Monaco has no navy or air force, but on both a per-capita and per-area basis, Monaco has one of the largest police forces (515 police officers for about 38,000 people) and police presences in the world [77] Its police includes a special unit which operates patrol and surveillance boats jointly with the military Police forces in Monaco are commanded by a French officer [78]\n\n**Geography**\n\nMonaco is a sovereign city-state, with five quarters and ten wards, [82] located on the French Riviera in

world [100] The state consists of only one municipality (commune), the Municipality of Monaco There is no geographical distinction between the State and City of Monaco, although responsibilities of the government (state-level) and of the municipality (city-level) are different [101] According to the constitution of 1911, the principality was subdivided into three municipalities: [102]\n\nTraditional quarters and modern geographic areas\nThe four traditional quartiers of Monaco are Monaco-Ville, La Condamine, Monte Carlo and Fontvieille [108] The suburb of Moneghetti, the high-level part of La Condamine, is generally seen today as an effective fifth Quartier of Monaco, having a very distinct atmosphere and topography when compared with low-level La Condamine [109]\n\nWards\nFor town planning purposes, a sovereign ordinance in 1966 divided the principality into reserved sectors, \"whose current character must be preserved\", and wards The number and

ceramics, and caryatids These were blended to create a picturesque fantasy of pleasure and luxury, and an alluring expression of how Monaco sought and still seeks, to portray itself [112] This capriccio of French, Italian, and Spanish elements were incorporated into hacienda villas and apartments Following major development in the 1970s, Prince Rainier III banned high-rise development in the principality His successor, Prince Albert II, overturned this Sovereign Order [113] In recent years [when?] the accelerating demolition of Monaco's architectural heritage, including its

average length of which is also shorter Summer afternoons are infrequently hot (indeed, temperatures greater than 30 °C or 86 °F are rare) as the atmosphere is temperate because of constant sea breezes On the other hand, the nights are very mild, due to the fairly high temperature of the sea in summer Generally, temperatures do not drop below 20 °C (68 °F) in this season In the winter, frosts and snowfalls are extremely rare and generally occur once or twice every ten years [117] [118] On 27 February 2018, both Monaco and Monte Carlo experienced snowfall

She was the mother of the renowned musician and fashion designer Kanye West. Through her life and work, Donda West left a lasting impact on her family, community, and society at large.\n\n# Early Life and Career\n\nDonda West was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, to Lucille (née Eckles) and Portwood Williams Sr. Her father was a prominent civil rights activist who played a significant role in the city's African American community. Donda's early life was marked by her involvement in the civil rights movement, which instilled in her a strong sense of social justice and activism.\n\nWest attended Douglass High School, graduating in 1967. Her academic achievements earned her a place at Virginia Union University, where she earned her bachelor's degree in English in 1971. After completing her undergraduate studies, Donda pursued a career in education, eventually earning her doctoral degree from Auburn University in 1980.\n\nDonda's participation in the Katz Drug Store sit-in on August 19, 1958, alongside her father, marked a pivotal moment in her life and the civil rights movement. This event not only demonstrated her commitment to social justice but also foreshadowed her future involvement in activism and community service.\n\n# Personal Life\n\nIn 1973, Donda married photographer Ray West, with whom she had a son, Kanye West, in 1977. The couple's marriage was marked by a period of stability and growth, during which Donda continued to pursue her educational and professional goals. However, the couple eventually divorced in 1980, following a period of separation.\n\nDonda's personal life was marked by her unwavering dedication to her family and her community. She remained a devoted mother to Kanye and continued to be involved in various charitable and educational endeavors throughout her life.\n\n# Death\n\nDonda West died on November 10, 2007, at the age of 58. The Los Angeles County coroner's office later determined that she had died of coronary artery disease and multiple post-operative factors from cosmetic surgery. Following her death, authorities launched an investigation into her medical care, led by the doctor who had performed the surgery, Jan Adams. Adams had previously been convicted of alcohol-related offenses and had been involved in at least two major malpractice settlements.\n\nThe investigation into Donda's death highlighted concerns about the safety and regulation of cosmetic surgery in the United States. In response to these concerns, the state of California introduced legislation aimed at improving patient safety and medical care.\n\n# Legacy\n\nThe \"Donda West Law\" was signed into effect by California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2009. This legislation requires patients to undergo a medical examination and receive clearance before undergoing elective cosmetic surgery. The law was enacted in response to the concerns raised by Donda's death and subsequent investigation.\n\nDonda West's legacy extends far beyond the immediate impact of the legislation. Through her life and work, she inspired countless individuals and communities, leaving a lasting impact on the world around her.\n\n# In Popular Culture\n\nDonda West's life and legacy have been celebrated in various forms of popular culture. Kanye West's song \"Hey Mama\" is a poignant tribute to his mother, which appeared on his 2005 album Late Registration. In the song, Kanye expresses his gratitude for his mother's unwavering support and love. On another track from the same album, \"Touch the Sky,\" Kanye thanks his mother for driving him to New York from Chicago in a rented U-Haul van, highlighting the sacrifices she made for him.\n\nDonda West's impact on popular culture extends beyond her son's music. Her legacy serves as a reminder of the importance of family, community, and social justice, inspiring individuals to make a positive difference in the world.\n\nIn conclusion, Donda West was a remarkable individual whose life and work left a lasting impact on her family, community, and society at large. Through her dedication to education, activism, and family, she inspired countless individuals and continues to be celebrated in popular culture. Her legacy serves as a reminder of the importance of social justice, community service, and family values, inspiring future generations to strive for greatness.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Donda_West\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and career\nWest was raised in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, the daughter of Lucille (née Eckles) [1] and Portwood Williams Sr., a civil rights activist [2] [3] [4] She attended Douglass High School, graduating in 1967 [5] [6] She earned her bachelor's degree in English from Virginia Union University in 1971 and her doctoral degree from Auburn University in 1980 [7] On August 19, 1958, she and her father took part in the Katz Drug Store sit-in in Oklahoma City [8]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1973, Donda married photographer Ray West Their son Kanye was born in 1977 The couple divorced in 1980 [18]\n\n\nDeath\nOn November 10, 2007, Donda West died at age 58 [19] In January 2008, the Los Angeles County coroner's office said that she had died of coronary artery disease and multiple post-operative factors from cosmetic surgery [20] Authorities in Los Angeles launched an investigation into her death after learning the doctor who operated on her, Jan Adams, had convictions for alcohol-related offenses and at least two major malpractice settlements [21]\n\n\nLegacy\nCalifornia governor Arnold Schwarzenegger subsequently signed the \"Donda West Law\" in 2009 This legislation makes it mandatory for patients to receive medical clearance through a physical examination before undergoing elective cosmetic surgery [23]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nShe is the subject of Kanye's song \"Hey Mama\", which appeared on his 2005 album Late Registration On \"Touch the Sky\" from the same album, Kanye thanks his mom for always supporting him during the lean times, especially when she drove him to New York from Chicago in a rented U-Haul van.\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

eccentric personality, treatment of animals, and involvement in several high-profile controversies.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJoe Exotic was born on March 5, 1963, in Garden City, Kansas, to parents Francis and Shirley Schreibvogel. He was the second of five children, with siblings Tamara, Pamela, Yarri, and Garold \"G.W.\" Wayne. Exotic's early life was marked by a tumultuous relationship with his parents, whom he has publicly criticized for their parenting style.\n\n**Career**\n\nAfter a near-fatal car accident in 1985, Exotic moved to West Palm Beach, Florida, where he managed a pet store and began to develop a passion for working with animals. He credits these experiences with inspiring him to become a zoo owner and exotic animal enthusiast. Exotic later moved to Oklahoma, where he founded the Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park, a zoo that became notorious for its treatment of animals and commercial cub petting.\n\n**Animals**\n\nExotic's zoo was home to over 200 animals, including tigers, lions, bears, and monkeys. He was known for his exotic animal shows, which featured animals in cages and allowed visitors to interact with them. However, Exotic's treatment of animals has been widely criticized, with allegations of animal abuse, neglect, and mistreatment. Exotic has been accused of killing animals that were deemed too sick or old to be kept alive, and has been involved in several high-profile animal welfare scandals.\n\n**Music**\n\nDuring his career as a zoo owner, Exotic was also an aspiring country music singer. He commissioned country songs from other artists, which were recorded and released under his name. Exotic took credit for the music, despite reportedly only suggesting song topics and singing backing vocals. One of his best-known songs, \"I Saw a Tiger,\" was featured in the popular Netflix documentary series \"Tiger King\" and has been covered by numerous bands and artists.\n\n**Appearance in Documentaries**\n\nExotic first appeared in Louis Theroux's 2011 documentary \"America's Most Dangerous Pets.\" Five years later, he appeared in J.D. Thompson's documentary \"The Life Exotic: Or the Incredible True Story of Joe Schreibvogel.\" Theroux has described Exotic as a complex and charismatic individual, who is both likable and volatile.\n\n**Other Ventures**\n\nFrom 2014 to 2018, Exotic worked as a professional wrestling commentator and hosted two wrestling programs at the G.W. Zoo. He was involved with the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and provided color commentary at NWA Texoma events. Exotic's involvement with wrestling was a lucrative side hustle, and he used his platform to promote his zoo and other business ventures.\n\n**Politics**\n\nExotic ran as an independent candidate in the 2016 United States presidential election, attaining ballot access in Colorado and receiving 962 votes nationwide. During his campaign, Exotic uploaded video messages to then-Republican nominee Donald Trump, in which he criticized politicians, animal rights activists, and laws he disagreed with.\n\n**2016 Presidential Campaign**\n\nExotic's presidential campaign was marked by controversy and criticism. He was accused of using his campaign to promote his zoo and other business ventures, and was criticized for his treatment of animals and his handling of sensitive topics. Despite his efforts, Exotic failed to gain significant traction in the election.\n\n**2018 Oklahoma Gubernatorial Campaign**\n\nAfter losing in the 2016 election, Exotic ran in the 2018 Libertarian Party primary election for Governor of Oklahoma. He received 664 votes in the primary, finishing last among the three Libertarian candidates. During his primary campaign, Exotic was officially censured by the Oklahoma Libertarian Party.\n\n**2020 Presidential Campaign**\n\nOn January 13, 2017, Exotic filed with the Federal Election Commission to run for president as a Libertarian in the 2020 Libertarian Party presidential primaries. He later shifted his focus to the Oklahoma gubernatorial election and ended his presidential campaign.\n\n**2024 Presidential Campaign**\n\nIn 2022, Exotic expressed interest in running for president with Andrew Tate as his running mate.\n\n**Legal Violations, Controversies, and Criminal Convictions**\n\nExotic has been strongly criticized for his treatment of animals, which led to an investigation by the USDA and convictions for animal abuse. He was arrested and arraigned on charges of attempting to hire two hitmen to kill Carole Baskin, a prominent animal rights activist. In April 2019, a federal jury found Exotic guilty on two counts of hiring someone to murder Baskin in Florida, eight counts of violating the Lacey Act by falsifying wildlife records, and nine counts of violating the Endangered Species Act by killing five tigers and selling tigers across state lines.\n\n**Conviction and Imprisonment**\n\nExotic was sentenced to 22 years in prison on January 22, 2020, and was incarcerated at Federal Medical Center, Fort Worth (FMC Fort Worth). He filed a lawsuit against those he blamed for his arrest and conviction, including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the lead prosecutor, a federal agent, and former business partner Jeff Lowe. The lawsuit was later dropped.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nExotic is an ordained minister in the state of Oklahoma and is able to officiate marriages. He obtained his ministerial ordination from the Universal Life Church. Exotic is gay and has referred to numerous partners as his husband despite them not being legally married. He claims to have had four heart attacks during his career as a zookeeper.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* America's Most Dangerous Pets (2011)\n* The Life Exotic: Or the Incredible True Story of Joe

traveling shows While Exotic and the Wynnewood park had been subject to protests and investigations by animal rights organizations such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, these efforts had been sporadic and poorly organized and did not seriously hamper his business Baskin's Big Cat Rescue organization—which had a very popular Facebook page and many informal volunteers recruited on social media—proved more daunting Big Cat Rescue volunteers began to track Exotic's movements and email bomb managers of shopping malls that hosted his shows, prompting many of them to cancel, which jeopardized his income.\n\n\nSteve Irwin Memorial and TV studio fire\nOn March 26, 2015, a fire broke out at the G.W Zoo, destroying the Steve Irwin Memorial and Exotic's TV studio, where he shot his YouTube videos and stored footage for a planned reality series All but one of the Neverland Ranch alligators were killed The blaze was thought to have been started by an arsonist, possibly a

the reality TV producer who worked with him [79]\n\n\nFeuds with his family and former employees\nWith the exception of his brother Garold, Exotic did not have a good relationship with his family; in particular his estranged brother Yarri has been very critical of him, believing that he manipulated the Schreibvogel family to take the money from Garold's death for himself [81] Exotic's niece

Welshpool had become the capital of Powys Wenwynwyn, of which Owain had been heir On the death of Owain, the castle passed to his daughter Hawys, who married Sir John Charlton [17] The Charltons continued to live at Powis until the fifteenth century when two daughters, Joyce Tiptoft and Joan Grey inherited the castle and estates Both were equally divided, each daughter and her husband living in a portion of the castle [18]\n\n\nThe Herberts: 1660–1800\nOn the restoration, the Herberts returned to Powis, and in 1674 William Herbert (c. 1626–1696) was created Earl of Powis (of the first creation) The state bedroom was installed in about 1665 and further improvements, including the construction of the Great Staircase followed in the 1670s These developments were most probably carried out under the direction of William Winde, who may also have designed the terraced gardens His employer, although restored to his estates, and raised in the peerage, was barred by his Catholic faith from high office under Charles II On the accession of the King's brother, James in 1685, Herbert became one of the new king's chief ministers, and was again advanced in the peerage becoming Marquess of Powis in 1687, but fell at the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and followed James into exile in France [e] William III granted the castle to his nephew, William Nassau de Zuylestein, 1st Earl of Rochford Herbert died, still in exile, in 1696 [24]\n\n\nThe Clives and Herberts: 1801–1952\nIn 1784, Henry Herbert's daughter, Henrietta, married Edward Clive (1754–1839), the eldest son of Clive of India [30] Clive had followed his father to India, and served as Governor of Madras Henrietta's brother died in 1801, whereupon the title lapsed; in 1804, her husband was created first Earl of Powis (of the third creation) The Clive fortune paid for long overdue repairs to the castle, which were carried out by Sir Robert Smirke [31] [32] Their son, Edward (1785–1848), inherited his late uncle's Powis estates on his 21st birthday, taking the surname Herbert in compliance with his uncle's will [30] Edward Herbert served in a range of administrations as an Anti-Catholic Tory, his speeches in the House of Commons being \"cautious and pertinent, although marred by dull delivery\" He died in 1848, following a shooting accident at Powis in which he was fatally injured by his second son [33] No further major changes were made to the Powis estate during his time, or in the long tenure of his eldest son Edward (1818–1891), the third earl, although the castle was well maintained In honour of his great-grandfather, the earl was offered the viceroyalty of India by Disraeli but declined, writing \"Not worth considering Powis\" on the envelope containing the invitation [34]\n\n\nThe National Trust: 1952–present\nThe fourth earl was succeeded by his cousin, Edward Herbert (1889–1974), the fifth Earl Edward's heir was Christian Victor Charles Herbert (1904–1988), the sixth Earl He was succeeded by his cousin, George William Herbert (1925–1993), [42] who was in turn succeeded by his son, John, the 8th and current Earl [43] The Herbert family continue to live in part of the castle, under an arrangement with the National Trust [44] The Trust has undertaken a number of major works of restoration during its ownership, including the Marquess Gate, [45] the Grand Staircase, [46] and the sculpture of Fame in the Outer Courtyard [i] [47]\nThe castle and its gardens receive around 200,000 visitors annually [48]\n\n\nArchitecture and description\nEntrance to the castle is made through an outer gatehouse, with the stables to the right and a coach house to the left The medieval building history is complex; John R Kenyon, in his study The Medieval Castles of Wales, notes that \"the accretion of later buildings and much modification, have made it notoriously difficult to interpret the early phasing.\" [49] Continuing the run of buildings on the left is the North Range, with former domestic offices below and a ballroom above The base of this block formed the outer bailey wall of the original castle [50]\n\n\nExterior\nEntrance to the castle is made through an outer gatehouse, with the stables to the right and a coach house to the left The medieval building history is complex; John R Kenyon, in his study The Medieval Castles of Wales, notes that \"the accretion of later buildings and much modification, have made it notoriously difficult to interpret the early phasing.\" [49] Continuing the run of buildings on the left is the North Range, with former domestic offices below and a ballroom above The base of this block formed the outer bailey wall of the original castle [50]\n\n\nInteriors\nScourfield and Haslam, in their Powys volume of Pevsner's The Buildings of Wales, describe the castle interiors as \"the most magnificent in Wales\" [55] They contain murals and ceiling paintings by Antonio Verrio and Gerard Lanscroon; a collection of Elizabethan and Jacobean family portraits mainly of members of the Herberts of Chirbury, who inherited the castle in the early 18th century; Carolean furnishings of notable richness and quality;

Unlike the castles at Conwy, Caernarfon, Harlech and nearby Montgomery, which were built by the English to subdue the Welsh, the castles at Welshpool were built by the Welsh princes of Powys Wenwynwyn as their dynastic seat.\n\n**History**\n\nUnlike the castles at Conwy, Caernarfon, Harlech and nearby Montgomery, which were built by the English to subdue the Welsh, the castles at Welshpool were built by the Welsh princes of Powys Wenwynwyn as their dynastic seat. In addition to the current site, two motte-and-bailey castles and a set of earthworks are located nearby. The names Trallwg/Tallwm and Pola are used interchangeably in early primary sources, and it is unclear which of these sites is being referred to.\n\n**First Castles at Welshpool: 1111–1286**\n\nIn 1111, the Welsh prince of Powys, Owain Cyfeiliog, built a motte-and-bailey castle at Welshpool. The castle was later rebuilt and expanded by his descendant, Gruffydd ap Cynan, who became the last hereditary prince of Powys in 1286. Gruffydd's son, Owain ap Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn, renounced his royal title and was granted the barony of de la Pole, also known as Welshpool.\n\n**Early History: 1286–1644**\n\nIn 1286, Owain ap Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn became the last hereditary prince of Powys when he renounced his royal title and was granted the barony of de la Pole. The ancient Kingdom of Powys had once included the counties of Montgomeryshire, much of Denbighshire, parts of Radnorshire and large areas of Shropshire, but by the 13th century had been reduced to two independent principalities – Powys Wenwynwyn and Powys Fadog. Welshpool had become the capital of Powys Wenwynwyn. On the death of Owain, the castle passed to his daughter Hawys, who married Sir John Charlton. The Charltons continued to live at Powis until the 15th century when two daughters, Joyce Tiptoft and Joan Grey, inherited the castle and estates. Both were equally divided, each daughter and her husband living in a portion of the castle.\n\n**The Herberts: 1660–1800**\n\nIn 1660, the Herberts returned to Powis, and in 1674, William Herbert (c. 1626–1696) was created Earl of Powis (of the first creation). The state bedroom was installed in about 1665 and further improvements, including the construction of the Great Staircase, followed in the 1670s. These developments were most probably carried out under the direction of William Winde, who may also have designed the terraced gardens. William's employer, William Herbert, was barred by his Catholic faith from high office under Charles II. On the accession of the King's brother, James in 1685, Herbert became one of the new king's chief ministers, and was again advanced in the peerage becoming Marquess of Powis in 1687, but fell at the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and followed James into exile in France.\n\n**The Clives and Herberts: 1801–1952**\n\nIn 1784, Henry Herbert's daughter, Henrietta, married Edward Clive (1754–1839), the eldest son of Clive of India. Clive had followed his father to India, and served as Governor of Madras. Henrietta's brother died in 1801, whereupon the title lapsed; in 1804, her husband was created first Earl of Powis (of the third creation). The Clive fortune paid for long overdue repairs to the castle, which were carried out by Sir Robert Smirke.\n\n**The National Trust: 1952–present**\n\nThe fourth earl was succeeded by his cousin, Edward Herbert (1889–1974), the fifth Earl Edward's heir was Christian Victor Charles Herbert (1904–1988), the sixth Earl. He was succeeded by his cousin, George William Herbert (1925–1993), who was in turn succeeded by his son, John, the 8th and current Earl. The Herbert family continue to live in part of the castle, under an arrangement with the National Trust. The Trust has undertaken a number of major works of restoration during its ownership, including the Marquess Gate, the Grand Staircase, and the sculpture of Fame in the Outer Courtyard.\n\n**Architecture and Description**\n\nEntrance to the castle is made through an outer gatehouse, with the stables to the right and a coach house to the left. The medieval building history is complex; John R Kenyon, in his study The Medieval Castles of Wales, notes that \"the accretion of later buildings and much modification, have made it notoriously difficult to interpret the early phasing.\" Continuing the run of buildings on the left is the North Range, with former domestic offices below and a ballroom above. The base of this block formed the outer bailey wall of the original castle.\n\n**Exterior**\n\nEntrance to the castle is made through an outer gatehouse, with the stables to the right and a coach house to the left. The medieval building history is complex; John R Kenyon, in his study The Medieval Castles of Wales, notes that \"the accretion of later buildings and much modification, have made it notoriously difficult to interpret the early phasing.\" Continuing the run of buildings on the left is the North Range, with former domestic offices below and a ballroom above. The base of this block formed the outer bailey wall of the original castle.\n\n**Interiors**\n\nThe interiors of Powis Castle are considered to be \"the most magnificent in Wales\" by Scourfield and Haslam, in their Powys volume of Pevsner's The Buildings of Wales. They contain murals and ceiling paintings by Antonio Verrio and Gerard Lanscroon; a collection of Elizabethan and Jacobean family portraits mainly of members of the Herberts of Chirbury, who inherited the castle in the early 18th century; Carolean furnishings of notable richness and quality; and items from the picture and Indian collections of Robert Clive. The early 20th-century redevelopment and redecoration undertaken by George Bodley was sensitively handled, and it is the only remaining, unaltered, example of his decorative approach.\n\n**Great Staircase**\n\nThe great staircase was built c. 1673-85, probably under the direction of William Winde. The ceiling painting is by Verrio, and likely depicts Catherine of Braganza, wife of Charles II. The staircase has been closed to visitors to the castle for many years, because of structural instability. In 2017, the Trust began fundraising efforts for restoration.\n\n**State Dining Room**\n\nThe dining room was created by Bodley by the re-amalgamation of two smaller rooms. The fourth earl took a very close interest in Bodley's work, and influenced much of the decoration. The chimneypieces in the room were copied from examples in the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the ceiling from the Reindeer Inn, a public house in Banbury, both at the earl's suggestion.\n\n**State Bedroom**\n\nA remarkable survival of the 1660s, the State Bedroom is the only remaining one in Britain where a balustrade separates the bed alcove from the rest of the room. The design demonstrates the desire of the Anglo-Welsh aristocracy to emulate the etiquette that regulated the court of Louis XIV at Versailles. The room is attributed to William Winde, at the time of his work on the gardens. When improvements to the castle were being considered in 1772, the architect Thomas Farnolls Pritchard recommended that the bedroom be preserved.\n\n**Long Gallery**\n\nThe Long Gallery was built by Sir Edward Herbert, following his purchase of the castle in 1587. It is constructed to a T-plan, an unusual design for an Elizabethan long gallery. Displayed in the gallery is a marble group of a cat and snake. It is probably Roman, dating between the 1st century BC and 2nd century AD, although it could be an 18th-century fake. Representations of cats are rare in Roman art.\n\n**Clive Museum**\n\nWhen Robert Clive returned to England, his fortune of some £234,000 (£23 million today), made him the richest self-made man in Europe. According to William Dalrymple, much of the wealth amassed by Clive was loot that was illicitly collected after the Battle of Plassey. Several of Clive's acquisitions are on display in the Clive Museum at Powis Castle, along with items acquired subsequently by Edward and Henrietta, during Edward's time working firstly for the East India Company and then as the Governor of Madras.\n\n**Listing Designations**\n\nPowis Castle is a Grade I listed building. The Outer Gatehouse, the Marquess Gate, the Ballroom Range to the north of the Outer Courtyard, and the retaining wall to the south, as well as the Top, Aviary, and Orangery Terraces all have separate Grade I listings. The statues of Fame and of Hercules are listed Grade II*. The raised terrace to the south-east, the stone vase on the site of the water garden cascade, and the Peacock statue have Grade II designations, as do a number of domestic offices, including the Ice House, the Bothy, the Garden House, four cottages, and a range of garden features.\n\n**Gardens**\n\nThe gardens at Powis are considered to be \"the most important and magnificent [.] in Wales\" by Elisabeth Whittle, the garden historian. They mainly survived the 18th-century reaction against the formality of earlier garden design, and are one of the few remaining Baroque gardens in the UK. Although their exact dating is uncertain, the terraces were hewn from the rock at some point between the 1670s and 1705 under the direction of William Winde and later Adrian Duvall, a French gardener from Rouen.\n\nPowis Castle is a significant historical site in Wales, offering a glimpse into the country's rich past. The castle's history spans over 800 years, from the 12th century to the present day, and it has been home to several notable families, including the Herberts and the Clives. The castle's architecture and design reflect the changing tastes and styles of the time, from the medieval to the Baroque and Georgian periods.

Grade I, the highest grade, for buildings of \"exceptional interest\", Grade II*, the next grade, for buildings of \"more than special interest\", and Grade II, the lowest grade, for buildings of \"special interest\" [81] Powis Castle is a Grade I listed building [32] The Outer Gatehouse, [82] the Marquess Gate, [83] the Ballroom Range to the north of the Outer Courtyard [84] and the retaining wall to the south, [85] as well as the Top, [86] Aviary, [87] and Orangery Terraces all have separate Grade I listings [88] The statues of Fame, [89] and of Hercules are listed Grade II* [90] The raised terrace to the south-east, [91] the stone vase on the site of the water garden cascade, [92] and the Peacock statue have Grade II designations [93] as do a number of domestic offices, including the Ice House, [94] the Bothy, [95] the Garden House, [96] four cottages, [97] [98] [99] [100] and a range of garden features [101] [102] [103] [104]\n\n\nGardens\nElisabeth Whittle, the garden historian, considers the gardens at Powis to be \"the most important and magnificent  [.] in Wales\" [105] They mainly survived the 18th-century reaction against the formality of earlier garden design, and are one of the few remaining Baroque gardens in the UK [106] Although their exact dating is uncertain, the terraces were hewn from the rock at some point between the 1670s and 1705 under the direction of William Winde and later Adrian Duvall, a French gardener from Rouen [107] [108]\n\n\nThe Water Garden\nDuvall may have had training in hydraulics, being responsible for the original water gardens, which were laid out in a Dutch style [105] Their design was almost certainly influenced by the gardens of the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, outside Paris The chateau was home to James II after his flight from England and was thus well known to the Marquess of Powis and his son Its grounds were landscaped in an Italianate style comprising gravelled walks between parterres, with fountains and basins [o] [105] By 1705, despite the Herberts' absence, the water garden was completed John Bridgeman, a guest in that year, wrote \"the waterworks and fountains are much beyond anything I ever saw, the cascade has two falls of water which concludes in a noble Bason (sic).\" [111]\n\n\nThe Terraces\nFour of the terraces remain, the last two having reverted to banks of earth covered with shrubs [112] Each is 150m in length [113] The Top Terrace is planted with a range of yew trees, a distinctive feature at Powis Originally tightly clipped in the form of obelisks, they have grown into an array of amorphous shapes The 14 \"tumps\" on the Top Terrace, and the hedge at its eastern end, were planted by the 2nd Marquess in the 1720s The darker Irish yews elsewhere in the garden date from the following century [114] Below is the Aviary Terrace, the site of a bird house, which is decorated with four statues of shepherds and shepherdesses by van Nost They were once painted in colours, but are now treated with a uniform grey weather-resistant paint [115] The third level is the Orangery Terrace, which houses an orangery When built this was heated and was open to the elements, but in the early 20th century the arcade was enclosed with windows and a door case moved from the main entrance to the keep in the Outer Courtyard [28] A lead statue of a peacock on this terrace came originally from Claremont, Robert Clive's country house in Surrey [116] The last remaining terrace is the Apple Bank Helena Attlee, in her The Gardens of Wales, notes the varied planting styles, sub-tropical on the Top Terrace, Mediterranean on the Aviary Terrace, and British double-herbaceous borders on the Orangery Terrace [106]\n\n\nLater work\nWilliam Emes, apart from the destruction of the water garden, did make improvements to the estate A road that cut through the park just below the castle was diverted, and much planting was undertaken on the Wilderness Ridge, the line of hills opposite the castle, on the other side of the Great Lawn [117] The last major transformation of the gardens was undertaken in the early 20th century by Violet, wife of the fourth earl Her ambition was \"to turn a poor and meagre garden into one of the most beautiful, if not the most beautiful, in England and Wales\" [37]\n\n\nGallery\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Shedrick Hay, his father, was married to a different woman and raising a family with her Shedrick committed suicide when Karl was 14, [9] though Malone didn't disclose the suicide until 1994 As a child, Malone often worked on the farm, chopped trees, hunted, and fished He attended Summerfield High School and led his basketball team to three consecutive Louisiana Class C titles from 1979 to his senior season in 1981.\n\n\nProfessional career\nIn the 1985 NBA draft, the Utah Jazz selected Karl Malone with the 13th overall pick According to Malone's official NBA biography: \"If professional scouts had correctly predicted the impact Karl Malone would have on the NBA, Malone would have been picked much higher than 13th in the 1985 NBA Draft.\" [13] In fact, Malone was so convinced the

and 36 seconds remaining to a 96–96 tie [15] For the third consecutive season, the Jazz made the postseason but lost the first round of the 1986 playoffs to the Dallas Mavericks In the four playoff games, Malone improved in his scoring with a 20 points per game average but was still subpar in shooting (49.6% field goals) and rebounds (8.9) After his second season, Malone became the Jazz's leader in average scoring (21.7 points) and rebounding (10.4 rebounds); in 24 of 29 games between February 1 and April 3, 1987, he was the leading scorer of the game [13]\n\n\nEarly years (1985–1987)\nIn the 1985 NBA draft, the Utah Jazz selected Karl Malone with the 13th overall pick According to Malone's official NBA biography: \"If professional scouts had correctly predicted the impact Karl Malone would have on the NBA, Malone would have been picked much higher than 13th in the 1985 NBA Draft.\" [13] In fact, Malone was so convinced the Dallas Mavericks were going to select him with the eighth choice that he had already rented an apartment in Dallas Instead, the Mavericks selected Detlef Schrempf [14] Under head coach Frank Layden, Malone averaged 14.9 points and 8.9 rebounds in his first season and made the 1986 NBA All-Rookie Team after coming in third for Rookie of the Year votes [13] On January 14, 1986, the Jazz beat the Houston Rockets 105–102 to snap the Rockets' 20-game winning streak at home Malone scored 29 points in that game, including four free throws followed by a three-pointer by Pace Mannion to rally from a 96–89 deficit with 5 minutes and 36 seconds remaining to a 96–96 tie [15] For the third consecutive season, the Jazz made the postseason but lost the first round of the 1986 playoffs to the Dallas Mavericks In the four playoff games, Malone improved in his scoring with a 20 points per game average but was still subpar in shooting (49.6% field goals) and rebounds (8.9) After his second season, Malone became the Jazz's leader in average scoring (21.7 points) and rebounding (10.4 rebounds); in 24 of 29 games between February 1 and April 3, 1987, he was the leading scorer of the game [13]\n\n\nAll-Star and team offense leader (1987–1996)\nBy the 1987–88 season, Malone was the foundation of the offense and John Stockton was the floor general Malone made his first All-Star Game in 1988 on the strength of 27.1 points per game, and made his first All-NBA team at the end of the season This was the first of 14 consecutive All-Star appearances for Malone [13] In the 1988 NBA All-Star Game, Malone led the Western Conference All-Star team with 22 points [16] The Jazz finished 47–35, third place in the Midwest Division, and defeated the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round [17] In the next round, the defending champions Los Angeles Lakers, led by perennial All-Stars Magic Johnson, James Worthy, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, defeated the Jazz in seven games In the seventh game of the series, Malone scored 31 points and had 15 rebounds, but the Lakers beat the Jazz 109–98 and eventually won the 1988 NBA Finals In 11 playoff games in 1988, Malone averaged 29.7 points and 11.8 rebounds [13]\n\n\nWestern Conference championship years (1996–1998)\nMalone returned from a gold medal winning-effort at the 1996 Summer Olympics leading the Jazz to two consecutive NBA Finals appearances During the 1996–97 season, Malone put up a resurgent 27.4 points per game while leading the Jazz to a 64–18 record, the most regular-season wins in team history Malone won his first NBA Most Valuable Player award, and the Jazz were the top team in the Western Conference and the playoff champions in that conference [10] [32] After sweeping the Los Angeles Clippers and defeating the Los Angeles Lakers, the Jazz took on the Houston Rockets, led by the aging trio of Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley, and Clyde Drexler The Jazz beat them in six games (the last victory coming on a last-second shot by Stockton) Malone finally reached the NBA Finals in 1997, where they played the Jordan-led Chicago Bulls In a matchup of the two previous MVPs, the Bulls won the first two games at the United Center Malone struggled from the field, going 6 of 20 for 20 points in Game 2 However, the Jazz won the next two games at the Delta Center behind Malone's 37 points in Game 3 and 23 in Game 4, including a game-winning fastbreak lay-up off a spectacular assist by Stockton in the last minute The Bulls won the next two games and the series, with Malone struggling from the foul line in Game 6.\n\n\nLater seasons with Jazz (1998–2003)\nOn November 12, 1998, during the lockout that shortened the 1998–99 season, Malone declared on his Los Angeles-based radio show that he would demand a trade from the Jazz after the end of the lockout, citing a lack of respect from the team owner Larry H Miller and the Utah media, which he dubbed \"goons\" [37] A week later, Malone backed off on his trade demands, stating in an interview that he would still love to play for the Jazz with \"everything else being equal\" [38] The NBA regular season resumed in February and Malone won his second MVP award, with the Jazz going 37–13 during the 50-game regular season They lost in the second round that year to the Trail Blazers, and for the next several years the Jazz fell out of title contention The Jazz won Game 5 of the second-round 1999 round against the Blazers 88–71 to force a sixth game, and Malone scored 23 points In that game, Malone elbowed the Blazers' Brian Grant, something he also did in Game 1 and for which he was fined $10,000 [39] Despite the decline of his team and his advancing age, Malone averaged 25.5, 23.2, 22.4, and 20.6 points per game in his last four seasons with Utah In the 2002–2003 season, Malone passed Wilt Chamberlain for second on the all-time scoring list with 36,374 points He became a free agent in 2003, the year Stockton had retired For the time Malone and Stockton played together on the Jazz (1985–2003), the two formed one of the most productive guard–forward combinations in NBA history [citation needed] Playing coach Jerry Sloan's scrappy and tough style and perfecting the pick and roll to a maximum degree of efficiency, the Jazz regularly made the playoffs with a winning record Malone led the Jazz to multiple 50-win seasons with the exception of 1992–93 (47–35).\n\n\nLos Angeles Lakers (2003–2004)\nMalone played in the NBA for one more season, joining the Los Angeles Lakers in an attempt to win a championship All-Star point guard Gary Payton also joined the Lakers in an attempt to win his first NBA championship, and with Malone, Payton, Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, the Lakers were favorites to win the title The Lakers rolled out to a dominant 18–3 start to the season, but on December 21, Malone suffered a knee injury against the Phoenix Suns that forced him to miss 39 games Malone returned by the season's end, as the Lakers entered the playoffs with 56 wins and the number 2 seed in the playoffs In the first round against the Houston Rockets, Malone posted double-figure scoring in 4 games, including a 30-point and 13-rebound effort in the Lakers' game 4 victory The Lakers advanced to face the San Antonio Spurs in the conference semifinals, where Malone played a critical role on defense against Tim Duncan, despite not scoring more than 13 points in any game during the series The Lakers defeated the Spurs in 6 games in the conference semifinals before defeating the Minnesota Timberwolves in 6 games in the conference finals to advance to the NBA Finals He scored 17 points on two occasions against Minnesota and averaged 11.5 points and 8.8 rebounds a game in the playoffs.\n\n\nRetirement\nAfter his season with the Lakers, Malone became a free agent He had knee surgery during the summer of 2004, and personal problems [40] with Lakers guard Kobe Bryant [41] prompted Malone not to return for another season with the team The New York Knicks sought to sign Malone for 2004–05 [42] In early February 2005, prior to the 2005 NBA All-Star Game, Malone's agent speculated that Malone would sign with the San Antonio Spurs [43] Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich confirmed his team was interested in signing Malone, should he decide to play one more season [44]\n\n\nOlympic career\nIn 1984, Malone and Stockton were both cut from the United States men's national basketball team but joined the team in 1992, when national basketball teams welcomed NBA players Prior to that only professionals from leagues other than the NBA were allowed to compete, and that greatly disadvantaged the United States [47]\n\n\nCoaching career\nOn May 31, 2007, Malone became director of basketball promotion and assistant strength and conditioning coach at

However, the Ides of March was a significant date in the Roman calendar long before the assassination, and its significance extends beyond the event that has made it famous.\n\n**Ides**\n\nThe Roman calendar was a complex system that counted days from three fixed points in the month: the Kalends (the first day of the month), the Nones (the 5th or 7th, eight days before the Ides), and the Ides (the 13th for most months, but the 15th in March, May, July, and October). The Ides was considered a significant date because it was believed to be a time of great power and influence, and many important events were scheduled to take place on this day.\n\n## History of the Roman Calendar\n\nThe Roman calendar was based on a lunisolar system, with months beginning on the new moon and the solar year being divided into 12 equal periods. However, the Roman calendar was not a perfect system, and it had many irregularities. The Romans also used a system of intercalation, where an extra month was added to the calendar every few years to keep it in sync with the solar year.\n\n## The Significance of the Ides\n\nThe Ides was a significant date in the Roman calendar because it was believed to be a time of great power and influence. Many important events were scheduled to take place on this day, including the sacrifice of a sheep to Jupiter, the Roman god of the sky and thunder. The Flamen Dialis, Jupiter's high priest, would lead the sacrifice in procession along the Via Sacra to the arx, where it would be performed.\n\n## Religious Observances\n\nThe Ides of each month was sacred to Jupiter, and many religious observances took place on this day. The sacrifice of the sheep was an important part of these observances, and it was believed to have great spiritual significance. The Ides was also a time of great celebration, with feasting and merriment taking place throughout the city.\n\n## The Assassination of Caesar\n\nIn modern times, the Ides of March is best known as the date on which Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC. Caesar was stabbed to death at a meeting of the Senate, with as many as 60 conspirators involved. According to legend, a seer had warned that harm would come to Caesar on the Ides of March, but Caesar ignored the warning and joked with the seer as he passed by.\n\n## The Prophecy of the Seer\n\nThe prophecy of the seer is an interesting aspect of the story of Caesar's assassination. The seer, who was identified as a haruspex named Spurinna, had warned Caesar that harm would come to him on the Ides of March. Caesar ignored the warning and joked with the seer as he passed by, saying, \"Well, the Ides of March are come\", implying that the prophecy had not been fulfilled.\n\n## The Legacy of the Ides of March\n\nThe Ides of March has become a famous date in history, thanks to the assassination of Julius Caesar. However, the Ides was a significant date in the Roman calendar long before the assassination, and its significance extends beyond the event that has made it famous. The Ides was a time of great power and influence, and many important events were scheduled to take place on this day. It was a time of great celebration, with feasting and merriment taking place throughout the city.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Ides of March is a date in the Roman calendar that has become infamous for being the day of Julius Caesar's assassination in 44 BC. However, the Ides of March was a significant date in the Roman calendar long before the assassination, and its significance extends beyond the event that has made it famous.

It is a fundamental concept that has been interpreted and applied in various ways throughout history, with significant implications for individual behavior, social relationships, and economic systems.\n\n## Ancient Usage\n\nThe origins of the commandment \"You shall not steal\" can be traced back to ancient civilizations, where the concept of property and its protection was deeply ingrained in social norms and laws. Significant voices of academic theologians suggest that the original intention of this commandment was not solely to prohibit the taking of material goods, but rather to combat the more insidious practice of stealing people - abductions and slavery. This interpretation is in agreement with the Talmudic interpretation of the statement as \"you shall not kidnap\" (Sanhedrin 86a).\n\n## Jewish Doctrine\n\nIn Jewish law, the prohibition of stealing is one of the 613 Mitzvot or commandments, which are considered essential principles for living a righteous and moral life. The commandment is explicitly stated in the Torah, where God commands the Israelites to \"not steal\" (Exodus 20:15). The Talmud and other Jewish texts elaborate on the concept of stealing, emphasizing the importance of protecting private property and upholding justice in cases related to theft.\n\nThe Jewish tradition also recognizes various forms of stealing, including:\n\n* Taking something that does not belong to you\n* Embezzling or misusing someone else's property\n* Stealing through deceit or trickery\n* Stealing by withholding information or services that are rightfully owed to others\n\n## New Testament Doctrine\n\nThe New Testament repeats the commandment \"You shall not steal,\" emphasizing its importance as a fundamental principle of Christian ethics. The Bible contains dire warnings about the spiritual consequences of stealing, highlighting the destructive effects it can have on individuals, communities, and society as a whole.\n\nThe New Testament also upholds the basic ideas of private property rights and the proper role of governmental authorities in punishing thieves. Thieves are exhorted to steal no longer, but to work hard with their own hands so that they might have something to share with people in need (Ephesians 4:28). The apostle Paul identifies five types of theft, including:\n\n* Stealing by stealth\n* Stealing by violence\n* Withholding wages or services\n* Frauds and deceit\n* Buying positions of preferment through corrupt means\n\n## Roman Catholic Doctrine\n\nIn the Roman Catholic tradition, the commandment \"You shall not steal\" is seen as an expression of the commandment to love your neighbor as yourself (Matthew 22:39). The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that:\n\n* Stealing is a grave offense against the eighth commandment\n* It is a form of violence against the rights of others\n* It is a breach of trust and a betrayal of the gift of life\n* It is a denial of God's love and mercy\n\n## Reformation and Post-Reformation Doctrines\n\nDuring the Reformation, Martin Luther emphasized the importance of protecting private property rights as a fundamental aspect of human dignity. He viewed the commandment \"You shall not steal\" as prohibiting not only the taking of someone else's property but also all unjust and fraudulent dealings in the marketplace, workplace, or any other place where transactions are conducted.\n\nLuther further described negligence and dereliction of duty as violations of this commandment if such negligence causes one's employer to suffer loss. He also viewed laziness and unfaithfulness in one's paid employment as a form of fraud that is worse than petty thefts that can be prevented with locks and bolts.\n\n## See Also\n\n* Property rights\n* Economic systems\n* Social justice\n* Christian ethics\n* Jewish law\n* Talmud\n\n## Further Reading\n\n* Aquinas, Thomas.

He was born on October 21, 1973, in New York City and grew up in Harlem, specifically on Striver's Row. Bragg's early life and education, as well as his subsequent career in law and politics, have been marked by a commitment to reforming the criminal justice system and promoting social justice.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nBragg was born and raised in Harlem, a historically African-American neighborhood in northern Manhattan. He grew up on Striver's Row, a renowned street lined with beautiful brownstones. In an interview, Bragg revealed that he had been deeply affected by the criminal justice system, having been stopped by the NYPD on three separate occasions. These experiences likely shaped his perspective on the system and his desire to reform it.\n\nBragg attended the prestigious Trinity School, a private K-12 school in Manhattan, before enrolling at Harvard College. His academic achievements and interests led him to pursue a career in law.\n\n**Legal Career**\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Bragg spent a year as a law clerk for Judge Robert P. Patterson Jr. of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. This experience provided him with valuable insight into the judicial system and the importance of fair and impartial justice.\n\nBragg then joined the law firm Morvillo Abramowitz Grand Iason & Anello as an associate, where he focused on white-collar fraud and civil rights cases. In 2003, he joined the office of the Attorney General of New York under Eliot Spitzer, working on cases involving corruption and public integrity.\n\nIn 2009, Bragg left the Attorney General's office to become the chief of litigation and investigations for the New York City Council. This role allowed him to apply his skills and experience to address issues of public concern and promote transparency and accountability in government.\n\n**New York County District Attorney**\n\nIn June 2019, Bragg announced his candidacy for the 2021 Democratic Party nomination for New York County District Attorney, a position previously held by Cyrus Vance Jr. Bragg's campaign focused on reforming the criminal justice system, reducing mass incarceration, and promoting social justice.\n\nBragg's candidacy was part of a wave of progressive prosecutors across the country who sought to challenge traditional approaches to crime and justice. His campaign emphasized the need for a more compassionate and effective approach to public safety, one that prioritized community investment and rehabilitation over punishment and incarceration.\n\n**Tenure**\n\nBragg was sworn into office on January 1, 2022, marking the beginning of a new era in the New York County District Attorney's office. His tenure has been characterized by a commitment to reform and a focus on social justice.\n\n**Policies on Low-Level Offenses**\n\nIn his first week in office, Bragg announced a new policy regarding low-level offenses. Effective January 4, 2022, his office would no longer prosecute low-level offenses such as fare evasion, resisting arrest, prostitution, and cannabis-related misdemeanors unless accompanied by a felony charge.\n\nAdditionally, Bragg's office would seek lesser charges for burglaries and store robberies where the offender displays a dangerous instrument but does not create a genuine risk of physical harm. This policy aimed to reduce unnecessary incarceration and promote more effective public safety strategies.\n\nHowever, Bragg was quick to clarify that he supported a zero-tolerance policy for violent crimes, emphasizing the need for a tough and effective approach to public safety.\n\n**Donald Trump Prosecution**\n\nOn February 23, 2022, two lead prosecutors in the New York County District Attorney's investigation into Donald Trump and his businesses, Carey R. Dunne and Mark F. Pomerantz, resigned abruptly. The reason for their resignation was Bragg's indication that he had doubts about moving forward with a case against Trump.\n\nIn his letter of resignation, Pomerantz expressed his disappointment and frustration with the decision, stating that the team that had been investigating Trump had no doubt about whether he had committed crimes, including falsifying business records.\n\nPomerantz's resignation highlighted the challenges and complexities of pursuing high-profile cases and the importance of maintaining the integrity and independence of the justice system.\n\n**Jose Alba Prosecution**\n\nOn July 7, 2022, Jose Alba, a 61-year-old bodega clerk, was attacked by a customer in a dispute over a bag of potato chips. Alba defended himself with a knife, killing the assailant. Police who investigated the incident described Alba's actions as self-defense.\n\nThe case highlighted the importance of understanding the context and motivations behind violent crimes and the need for effective self-defense strategies.\n\n**Steve Bannon Prosecution**\n\nOn September 6, 2022, The Washington Post reported that Steve Bannon would be indicted on September 8 by Bragg's prosecutors on charges of fraud related to his fundraising efforts for the construction of a southern border wall.\n\nBannon pleaded not guilty, emphasizing his commitment to transparency and accountability in government.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nBragg is married to Jamila Marie Ponton, and they have two children. Bragg has taught Sunday School at the Abyssinian Baptist Church, highlighting his commitment to community service and social justice.\n\nIn conclusion, Alvin Bragg's tenure as District Attorney of New York County has been marked by a commitment to reform and a focus on social justice. His policies on low-level offenses, his handling of high-profile cases, and his commitment to community service have made him a prominent figure in the world of law and politics.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Alvin_Bragg\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nBragg was born in New York City on October 21, 1973 He hails from Harlem and grew up on Striver's Row [2] In an interview with The American Prospect, Bragg said that he had been \"deeply affected by the criminal justice system – most directly through three gunpoint stops by the NYPD\" [3] He graduated from the Trinity School [4] before attending Harvard College \n\n\nLegal career\nAfter graduating from law school, Bragg spent a year as a law clerk for judge Robert P Patterson Jr of the U.S District Court for the Southern District of New York He then joined the law firm Morvillo Abramowitz Grand Iason & Anello as an associate, where his work focused on white collar fraud and civil rights issues In 2003, he joined the office of the Attorney General of New York under Eliot Spitzer before becoming the chief of litigation and investigations for the New York City Council In 2009, Bragg left the city council to serve as assistant United States Attorney in the Southern District of New York [7]\n\n\nNew York County District Attorney\nIn June 2019, Bragg started his candidacy for the 2021 Democratic Party nomination for New York County District Attorney, then held by Cyrus Vance Jr., who did not run for reelection [9] [11] Bragg ran as a supporter of criminal justice reform measures, and his campaign was characterized as one of the \"campaigns of progressive prosecutors across the country\" [12]\n\n\n2021 election\nIn June 2019, Bragg started his candidacy for the 2021 Democratic Party nomination for New York County District Attorney, then held by Cyrus Vance Jr., who did not run for reelection [9] [11] Bragg ran as a supporter of criminal justice reform measures, and his campaign was characterized as one of the \"campaigns of progressive prosecutors across the country\" [12]\n\n\nTenure\nBragg was sworn into office on January 1, 2022 [15]\n\n\nPolicies on low-level offenses\nOn January 4, 2022, after three days in office, he announced that his office would no longer prosecute low-level offenses such as fare evasion, resisting arrest, prostitution, and cannabis-related misdemeanors unless accompanied by a felony charge He also decided to seek lesser charges for burglaries and store robberies where the offender \"displays a dangerous instrument but does not create a genuine risk of physical harm\" [16] On January 20, Bragg disputed what he described was a \"legalistic\" interpretation of his prosecution policy memo and indicated that he supported a zero tolerance policy for violent crimes [17]\n\n\nDonald Trump prosecution\nOn February 23, 2022, Carey R Dunne and Mark F Pomerantz, the lead prosecutors in the New York County District Attorney's investigation into Donald Trump and his businesses, resigned abruptly after Bragg \"indicated to them that he had doubts about moving forward with a case against Mr Trump\" [18] In his letter of resignation, Pomerantz wrote that the \"team that has been investigating Mr Trump harbors no doubt about whether he committed crimes, [19]  including falsifying business records, and that it was \"a grave failure of justice\" [19] not to pursue criminal charges [20]\n\n\nJose Alba prosecution\nOn July 7, 2022, Jose Alba, a 61-year-old bodega clerk, was attacked by customer Austin Simon in a dispute over a bag of potato chips Alba attempted to de-escalate, but after being cornered behind the counter and being shoved into a wall, defended himself with a knife, killing the assailant [30] Police who investigated the incident described Alba's actions as self defense [31]\n\n\nSteve Bannon prosecution\nOn September 6, 2022, The Washington Post reported that Steve Bannon would be indicted on September 8 by Bragg's prosecutors on the same charges of fraud that he was federally pardoned for by then-President Trump in 2020 [34] On September 8, Bannon was charged with \"defrauding Americans who wanted to contribute to construction of a southern border wall, resurrecting a threat that Mr Bannon seemed to have escaped with a 2021 presidential pardon\"; Bannon pleaded not guilty [35] [36] [37]\n\n\nPersonal life\nBragg married Jamila Marie Ponton in 2003 [38] They have two children [5] Bragg at one time taught Sunday School at the Abyssinian Baptist Church [39]\n\n\nReferences\nThe Bronx(Bronx County)Darcel Clark\n\n\nExternal links\nThe Bronx(Bronx County)Darcel Clark\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film features an ensemble cast, including Sacha Baron Cohen, Eddie Redmayne, Alex Sharp, and Jeremy Strong.\n\n**Plot**\nIn August 1968, a group of eight anti-war activists, including Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Tom Hayden, Rennie Davis, David Dellinger, Lee Weiner, John Froines, and Bobby Seale, made preparations to protest at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Their goal was to bring attention to the Vietnam War and challenge the status quo. However, their plans were foiled when they were arrested and charged with \"crossing state lines\" to incite a riot.\n\nThe trial, which began in September 1969, was a highly publicized and contentious affair, with the defendants facing severe penalties if convicted. The prosecution, led by Tom Foran and Richard Schultz, was determined to make an example of the defendants, while the defense team, led by William Kunstler and Leonard Weinglass, argued that the defendants were exercising their constitutional right to free speech and assembly.\n\nThroughout the trial, the defendants were subjected to intense scrutiny and harassment by the prosecution, the police, and the media. Despite this, they remained resolute in their commitment to their cause and their right to free speech. In the end, seven of the eight defendants were found guilty of conspiracy and inciting a riot, while Bobby Seale was found guilty of contempt of court.\n\n**Cast**\nThe film features an ensemble cast, including Sacha Baron Cohen, Eddie Redmayne, Alex Sharp, and Jeremy Strong.

The film was shot on a relatively modest budget of $35 million, with a focus on creating a realistic and authentic portrayal of the events depicted.\n\nThe film's score was composed by Daniel Pemberton, who drew on his experience scoring other historical dramas to create a haunting and evocative soundtrack. The soundtrack was released digitally in October 2020, with a physical CD edition released in November 2020.\n\n**Music**\nThe soundtrack for The Trial of the Chicago 7 features three original songs performed by British singer Celeste, including \"Hear My Voice\", which served as the lead single and was released in September 2020. The song was also submitted to the 93rd Academy Awards for Best Original Song in September 2020.\n\n\"Hear My Voice\" is a powerful and emotional ballad that captures the spirit of the film and its themes. The song features Celeste's soaring vocals and a haunting melody that evokes the sense of struggle and determination that defined the defendants.\n\n**Release**\nThe Trial of the Chicago 7 was originally scheduled to begin a limited theatrical release in September 2020, with a wide release planned for October 2020. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the film was acquired by Netflix and released on the platform in October 2020.\n\n**Reception**\nThe Trial of the Chicago 7 received widespread critical acclaim upon its release, with many praising the film's powerful and timely portrayal of the events depicted.

The film also received three British Academy Film Award nominations, including Best Film, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Editing.\n\nThe film won the award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture at the 27th Screen Actors Guild Awards, and also won the award for Best Screenplay at the 78th Golden Globe Awards.\n\n**References**\n**Further Reading**\n**External Links**", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"The_Trial_of_the_Chicago_7\" following this outline:\n\n\nPlot\nIn August 1968, Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Tom Hayden, Rennie Davis, David Dellinger, Lee Weiner, John Froines, and Bobby Seale make preparations to protest at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago Five months later, they are arrested and charged with \"crossing state lines\" to incite a riot John N Mitchell, the Attorney General, appoints Tom Foran and Richard Schultz as the prosecutors, while all the defendants except Seale are represented by William Kunstler and Leonard Weinglass.\n\n\nCast\nAaron Sorkin stated to Vanity Fair in July 2020 that he first found out about the planned film during a visit to Steven Spielberg's home in 2006, specifying that Spielberg \"told me he wanted to make a movie about the riots at the 1968 Democratic Convention and the trial that followed.\" He also added that he had no previous knowledge of these events, stating, \"I left not knowing what the hell he was talking about.\" [3]\n\n\nProduction\nAaron Sorkin stated to Vanity Fair in July 2020 that he first found out about the planned film during a visit to Steven Spielberg's home in 2006, specifying that Spielberg \"told me he wanted to make a movie about the riots at the 1968 Democratic Convention and the trial that followed.\" He also added that he had no previous knowledge of these events, stating, \"I left not knowing what the hell he was talking about.\" [3]\n\n\nDevelopment\nAaron Sorkin stated to Vanity Fair in July 2020 that he first found out about the planned film during a visit to Steven Spielberg's home in 2006, specifying that Spielberg \"told me he wanted to make a movie about the riots at the 1968 Democratic Convention and the trial that followed.\" He also added that he had no previous knowledge of these events, stating, \"I left not knowing what the hell he was talking about.\" [3]\n\n\nCasting\nIn October 2018, Baron Cohen and Eddie Redmayne joined the cast, [11] [17] and in November 2018, Jonathan Majors was added as well [18] In February 2019, Seth Rogen, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Alex Sharp joined the cast as well, with Michael Keaton being considered for a role [19] In August, Frank Langella and Mark Rylance were added to the cast [14] In September, Jeremy Strong was cast, replacing Rogen [20] In October, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II joined the cast to replace Majors, [21] with Kelvin Harrison Jr., [22] Keaton, [23] William Hurt, J C MacKenzie, [24] Max Adler and Ben Shenkman being added as well [25]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal production was set to begin in September 2019, but began the next month in October between Chicago and New Jersey [26] [27] [28] Filming in Morris County, New Jersey, took place in Hennessy Hall, affectionately known as \"The Mansion\", on Fairleigh Dickinson University's Florham Park campus and Hyland Hall (located within Henderson Hall) and at Santa Maria at College of Saint Elizabeth;

{"title": "Boba_Fett", "content": "\nConcept and development\nStar Wars creator George Lucas created Boba Fett in his April 1978 screenplay draft of The Empire Strikes Back, basing the character on Sergio Leone's Man with No Name (Clint Eastwood) The character needed to be designed quickly, as Lucas had agreed for him to be featured in the Star Wars Holiday Special later that year [1] The character's design stemmed from initial concepts for Darth Vader, who was originally conceived as a rogue bounty hunter [2] While Vader became less of a mercenary and more of a dark knight, the bounty hunter concept remained, and Fett became \"an equally villainous\" but \"less conspicuous\" character [3] Concept artist Ralph McQuarrie influenced Fett's design, which was finalized by and is credited to Joe Johnston [4]\n\n\nFilm casting and production\nBoba Fett is primarily played by Jeremy Bulloch in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi Bulloch's half-brother alerted him to the role [22] He was cast as Fett because the costume happened to fit \"as if a Savile Row tailor had come out and made it\"; [22] [23] he did not have to do a reading or screen test, [24] and Bulloch never worked from a script for either film [25]\n\n\nOther portrayals\nAccording to the official Star Wars website, Fett was voiced by Don Francks in the Holiday Special [33] [34] [t] Bulloch wore Fett's costume in Empire and Jedi, but John Morton filled in during one scene for Empire, [25] and Jason Wingreen voiced the character in Empire His brief appearance in the Special Edition of the original film, Episode IV – A New Hope, was performed by Industrial Light & Magic creature animator Mark Austin [25] The character's appearance in the Special Edition footage of Jedi was performed by Don Bies [37] and Nelson Hall For the 2004 rereleases, Temuera Morrison replaced the character's original voice for continuity with Attack of the Clones, in which Morrison portrays Jango Fett [38]\n\n\nAppearances\nThe character of Boba Fett made his first public appearance at the San Anselmo Country Fair parade on 24 September 1978 [43] In the parade, the Boba Fett costume was worn by Duwayne Dunham, who was working at the time as an assistant film editor before later becoming a film and television director [43] The character debuted on television two months later in an animated segment produced by Toronto-based animation firm Nelvana Productions for the Star Wars Holiday Special Fett appears as a mysterious figure who saves Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca, C-3PO, and R2-D2 from a giant monster, only to be revealed as a bounty hunter working for Darth Vader [2] After his image and identity were revealed in the Holiday Special, costumed Fett characters appeared in shopping malls and special events, putting up wanted posters of the character to distinguish him from the franchise's Imperial characters [7]\n\n\nSkywalker saga\nFett's theatrical film debut was as an unnamed bounty hunter in The Empire Strikes Back as the \"next major villain\" beside Darth Vader [3] He is one of six bounty hunters assembled by Darth Vader, who promises a reward to whoever captures the

the sequel trilogy [69] [70] [71]\n\n\nThe Bounty Hunter Wars\nThe Bounty Hunter Wars is a trilogy of novels by K W Jeter set during the events of the original trilogy The books were published by Bantam Spectra in July 1998, November 1998, and July 1999, respectively The trilogy depicts Fett as being more communicative than in the films because its plot requires Fett to show \"an ability to convince people as well as kill them\" [77]\n\n\nBoba Fett: A Practical Man\nBoba Fett: A Practical Man is an e-novella by Karen Traviss, which was published online in August 2006 by Del Rey Books Set 20 years after the events of Return of the Jedi, it focuses on what led Boba Fett and the Mandalorians to fend off the extragalactic Yuuzhan Vong invaders in The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force (set a few months later).\nA Yuuzhan Vong named Nom Anor meets Fett on Mandalore and begins giving him and the Mandalorians directions to help their invasion Fett plans to do as much damage to the invaders as possible, even as he pretends to help them He instructs a pilot to deliver his plea for help to the New Republic, but with the Vong's next target still unwarned, the world falls without a fight.\nA Vong warrior asks Fett to assist in killing a Jedi; instead, Fett convinces the Jedi to deliver his message.\nThe Jedi returns and confirms that Fett has a deal: the Mandalorians will

have featured Fett [83]\n\n\nStar Wars 1313\nThe canceled LucasArts video game Star Wars 1313, announced at E3 2012, [84] would have told the story of Boba Fett's career as a young adult bounty hunter between the prequel and original trilogies [85] Fett would have navigated past the scum of civilization in an underground area of Coruscant known as Level 1313 [86] [87] In 2013, as a result of Disney's acquisition of the franchise, all LucasArts projects then in production were shelved In a December 2015 interview, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy stated that the concept art for the game was \"unbelievable\" and that, along with Underworld, it was \"something we're spending a lot of time looking at, poring through, discussing, and we may very well develop those things further\" [88]\n\n\nThe Clone Wars episodes\nFett was to have appeared in more episodes of The Clone Wars before its cancellation [91] A series of Western-inspired episodes would have featured Fett teaming up with Cad Bane to rescue a child kidnapped by Tusken Raiders on Tatooine; Aurra Sing would have appeared as well The story arc would have depicted Fett donning his Mandalorian armor for the first time, [92] and ended with Bane blasting Fett in the head, creating the iconic dent in his helmet [93] (an idea which came from George Lucas) Animatic footage of the climactic scene was shown at Star Wars Celebration [94]\n\n\nStandalone film\nIn early 2013, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced the development of a Star Wars spin-off film written by Simon Kinberg, [95] which Entertainment Weekly reported would focus on Boba Fett during the original trilogy [96] In mid-2014, Josh Trank was officially announced as the director of an undisclosed spin-off film, [97] but had left the project a year later due to creative differences with Kinberg, [98] [aa] causing a teaser for the Fett film to be scrapped from Star Wars Celebration [100] In May 2018, it was reported that James Mangold had signed on to write and direct a Fett film, with Kinberg attached as producer and co-writer, [101] [102] but both Mangold and Kathleen Kennedy subsequently denied Mangold's involvement [103] In July, Daniel Keys Moran stated that Lucasfilm had considered adapting The Last One Standing into a film [104] [105] By October, the Fett film was reportedly dead, with the studio instead focusing on The Mandalorian [106] The Fett film was afterwards reported to have also featured the other bounty hunters from The Empire Strikes Back [107]\n\n\nReception\nBoba Fett is a \"cult figure\" and one of the most popular Star Wars characters [15] [108] In 2008, Boba Fett was selected by Empire magazine as the 79th greatest movie character of all time, and he is included on Fandomania's list of The 100 Greatest Fictional Characters [109] [110] IGN ranked Boba Fett as the eighth top Star Wars character, due to his status as a fan-favourite and cult following [111] He personifies \"danger and mystery\", [7] and Susan Mayse calls Fett \"the unknowable Star Wars character\" who \"delivers mythic presence.\" [112] Although Tom Bissell asserts that no one knows why Boba Fett has become so popular, nor cares why, both Lucas and Bulloch cite Fett's mysterious nature as reasons for his popularity [9] [15] Bulloch, who has never fully understood the character's popularity, attributes it to the costume and the respect Fett garners from Darth Vader and Jabba the Hutt [25] Fett's addition to the Special Edition of A New Hope was criticized by Screen Rant, which called it \"pointless fan service\" [44]\n\n\nIn The Clone Wars\nIn Episode II,  [Boba Fett] saw his father murdered by Mace Windu, however, he's still got a long way to go before he becomes the battered bounty hunter we know so well Aurra's an influence, and not much of a nurturing parental figure – so that plays a part, as well She preys on his weakness, on his desire for a family It's pretty dysfunctional, and it sheds an interesting light on both Aurra and Boba Ultimately, though, Boba's always been a mystery As much as we reveal, we're not going to take the mystery away from his fans Not knowing all the answers about Boba is part of what makes him so cool.\n\n\nIn The Book of Boba Fett\nBoba Fett's character in the series has received mixed reviews, while Morrison's portrayal of Fett has been praised Some have said that, without Morrison portraying Boba Fett, the series might have been a total disaster and that he is the only face that could have brought Fett back to life [130] [131] Decider's Megan O'Keefe wrote, \"Boba Fett is the least interesting character in The Book of Boba Fett.\" [132] Rich Knight from CinemaBlend stated that he used to not like Fett, but became interested in his character as he was the only one in the series who \"seems like an actual human being\" [133] Chris Edwards of The Guardian said that Disney+ ruined one of the \"coolest and most mysterious characters\" in Star Wars [134]\n\n\nMerchandising\nFett is one of the top five best-selling Star Wars action figures, [15] and Boba Fett-related products are \"among the most expensive\" Star Wars merchandise [4] Fett was the first new mail-away action figure created for The Empire Strikes Back; [2] [9] although advertised as having a rocket-firing backpack, safety concerns led Kenner to sell his rocket attached [2] Gray called the early toy \"a rare and precious commodity\", [113] and one of the rocket-firing prototypes sold at auction for $16,000 in 2003 [24] In 2018 and 2019, two of the prototypes were sold at auction, for £69,000 ($USD92,000) and £90,000 ($USD120,000), respectively—each setting the world record for the highest auction price of a Star Wars toy at that time [135] A fully painted figure with a rare variant on the firing mechanism is planned to be auctioned and estimated to be worth $200,000 [136]\n\n\nSee also\nFootnotes\n\n\nReferences\nFootnotes\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en",

He is a bounty hunter and a skilled warrior who has become one of the most popular characters in the series.\n\n**Concept and Development**\n\nBoba Fett was created by George Lucas in his April 1978 screenplay draft of The Empire Strikes Back. The character was based on Sergio Leone's Man with No Name (Clint Eastwood) and was designed quickly due to Lucas's agreement to feature him in the Star Wars Holiday Special later that year. The character's design stemmed from initial concepts for Darth Vader, who was originally conceived as a rogue bounty hunter. While Vader became less of a mercenary and more of a dark knight, the bounty hunter concept remained, and Fett became \"an equally villainous\" but \"less conspicuous\" character.\n\nConcept artist Ralph McQuarrie influenced Fett's design, which was finalized by and is credited to Joe Johnston.\n\n**Film Casting and Production**\n\nBoba Fett is primarily played by Jeremy Bulloch in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Bulloch's half-brother alerted him to the role, and he was cast as Fett because the costume happened to fit \"as if a Savile Row tailor had come out and made it.\" He did not have to do a reading or screen test, and Bulloch never worked from a script for either film.\n\n**Other Portrayals**\n\nAccording to the official Star Wars website, Fett was voiced by Don Francks in the Holiday Special. Bulloch wore Fett's costume in Empire and Jedi, but John Morton filled in during one scene for Empire, and Jason Wingreen voiced the character in Empire. Mark Austin performed Fett's brief appearance in the Special Edition of the original film, Episode IV – A New Hope, and Don Bies and Nelson Hall performed Fett's appearance in the Special Edition footage of Jedi.\n\nTemuera Morrison replaced the character's original voice for continuity with Attack of the Clones, in which Morrison portrays Jango Fett.\n\n**Appearances**\n\nThe character of Boba Fett made his first public appearance at the San Anselmo Country Fair parade on 24 September 1978. In the parade, the Boba Fett costume was worn by Duwayne Dunham, who was working at the time as an assistant film editor before later becoming a film and television director.\n\nThe character debuted on television two months later in an animated segment produced by Toronto-based animation firm Nelvana Productions for the Star Wars Holiday Special. Fett appears as a mysterious figure who saves Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca, C-3PO, and R2-D2 from a giant monster, only to be revealed as a bounty hunter working for Darth Vader.\n\nAfter his image and identity were revealed in the Holiday Special, costumed Fett characters appeared in shopping malls and special events, putting up wanted posters of the character to distinguish him from the franchise's Imperial characters.\n\n**Skywalker Saga**\n\nFett's theatrical film debut was as an unnamed bounty hunter in The Empire Strikes Back as the \"next major villain\" beside Darth Vader. He is one of six bounty hunters assembled by Darth Vader, who promises a reward to whoever captures the crew of the Millennium Falcon.\n\nFett tracks the starship to Cloud City, where Vader captures its passengers and tortures its captain, Han Solo. Aiming to collect the bounty Jabba the Hutt has placed on Solo, Fett questions Vader regarding the carbon freeze, which Vader intends to use on his true target, Luke Skywalker. Vader promises that the Empire will compensate Fett if Solo dies, but the smuggler survives and Vader turns him over to Fett, who leaves to deliver him to Jabba in his ship, the Slave I.\n\n**Prequel Trilogy**\n\nA preteen Boba Fett (played by Daniel Logan) appears in the 2002 prequel film Episode II – Attack of the Clones, which reveals that he is an unaltered clone of the bounty hunter Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison).

the Jedi The comic miniseries War of the Bounty Hunters (2021) is set in the same era, and will be preceded by standalone comics including tie-ins with Star Wars, Bounty Hunters, Darth Vader, and Doctor Aphra [65]\n\n\nLegends\nThe character appears extensively in the Star Wars Expanded Universe of novels, comic books, and video games, dating to as early as the newspaper comic strip and Marvel's Star Wars series (produced concurrently to the original film trilogy) In April 2014, such works were rebranded by Lucasfilm as Star Wars Legends and declared non-canon to the rest of the franchise to create a blank slate for the sequel trilogy [69] [70] [71]\n\n\nThe Bounty Hunter Wars\nThe Bounty Hunter Wars is a trilogy of novels by K W Jeter set during the events of the original trilogy The books were published by Bantam Spectra in July 1998, November 1998, and July 1999, respectively The trilogy depicts Fett as being more communicative than in the films because its plot requires Fett to show \"an ability to convince people as well as kill them\" [77]\n\n\nBoba Fett: A Practical Man\nBoba Fett: A Practical Man is an e-novella by Karen Traviss, which was published online in August 2006 by Del Rey Books Set 20 years after the events of Return of the Jedi, it focuses on what led Boba Fett and the Mandalorians to fend off the extragalactic Yuuzhan Vong invaders in The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force (set a few months later).\nA Yuuzhan Vong named Nom Anor meets Fett on Mandalore and begins giving him and the Mandalorians directions to help their invasion Fett plans to do as much damage to the invaders as possible, even as he pretends to help them He instructs a pilot to deliver his plea for help to the New Republic, but with the Vong's next target still unwarned, the world falls without a fight.\nA Vong warrior asks Fett to assist in killing a Jedi; instead, Fett convinces the Jedi to deliver his message.\nThe Jedi returns and confirms that Fett has a deal: the Mandalorians will continue to masquerade as Vong mercenaries while passing intel to the Republic Fett agrees to have a few of his best commandos train planetary militias to fight the Vong [79] [80] [81] [82]\n\n\nUnproduced works\nA planned live-action TV series developed by Star Wars creator George Lucas before the sale of Lucasfilm to Disney, under the working title Star Wars: Underworld, would have featured Fett [83]\n\n\nStar Wars 1313\nThe canceled LucasArts video game Star Wars 1313, announced at E3 2012, [84] would have told the story of Boba Fett's career as a young adult bounty hunter between the prequel and original trilogies [85] Fett would have navigated past the scum of civilization in an underground area of Coruscant known as Level 1313 [86] [87] In 2013, as a result of Disney's acquisition of the franchise, all LucasArts projects then in production were shelved In a December 2015 interview, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy stated that the concept art for the game was \"unbelievable\" and that, along with Underworld, it was \"something we're spending a lot of time looking at, poring through, discussing, and we may very well develop those things further\" [88]\n\n\nThe Clone Wars episodes\nFett was to have appeared in more episodes of The Clone Wars before its cancellation [91] A series of Western-inspired episodes would have featured Fett teaming up with Cad Bane to rescue a child kidnapped by Tusken Raiders on Tatooine; Aurra Sing would have appeared as well The story arc would have depicted Fett donning his Mandalorian armor for the first time, [92] and ended with Bane blasting Fett in the head, creating the iconic dent in his helmet [93] (an idea which came from George Lucas) Animatic footage of the climactic scene was shown at Star Wars Celebration [94]\n\n\nStandalone film\nIn early 2013, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced the development of a Star Wars spin-off film written by Simon Kinberg, [95] which Entertainment Weekly reported would focus on Boba Fett during the original trilogy [96] In mid-2014, Josh Trank was officially announced as the director of an undisclosed spin-off film, [97] but had left the project a year later due to creative differences with Kinberg, [98] [aa] causing a teaser for the Fett film to be scrapped from Star Wars Celebration [100] In May 2018, it was reported that James Mangold had signed on to write and direct a Fett film, with Kinberg attached as producer and co-writer, [101] [102] but both Mangold and Kathleen Kennedy subsequently denied Mangold's involvement [103] In July, Daniel Keys Moran stated that Lucasfilm had considered adapting The Last One Standing into a film [104] [105] By October, the Fett film was reportedly dead, with the studio instead focusing on The Mandalorian [106] The Fett film was afterwards reported to have also featured the other bounty hunters from The Empire Strikes Back [107]\n\n\nReception\nBoba Fett is a \"cult figure\" and one of the most popular Star Wars characters [15] [108] In 2008, Boba Fett was selected by Empire magazine as the 79th greatest movie character of all time, and he is included on Fandomania's list of The 100 Greatest Fictional Characters [109] [110] IGN ranked Boba Fett as the eighth top Star Wars character, due to his status as a fan-favourite and cult following [111] He personifies \"danger and mystery\", [7] and Susan Mayse calls Fett \"the unknowable Star Wars character\" who \"delivers mythic presence.\" [112] Although Tom Bissell asserts that no one knows why Boba Fett has become so popular, nor cares why, both Lucas and Bulloch cite Fett's mysterious nature as reasons for his popularity [9] [15] Bulloch, who has never fully understood the character's popularity, attributes it to the costume and the respect Fett garners from Darth Vader and Jabba the Hutt [25] Fett's addition to the Special Edition of A New Hope was criticized by Screen Rant, which called it \"pointless fan service\" [44]\n\n\nIn The Clone Wars\nIn Episode II,  [Boba Fett] saw his father murdered by Mace Windu, however, he's still got a long way to go before he becomes the battered bounty hunter we know so well Aurra's an influence, and not much of a nurturing parental figure – so that plays a part, as well She preys on his weakness, on his desire for a family It's pretty dysfunctional, and it sheds an interesting light on both Aurra and Boba Ultimately, though, Boba's always been a mystery As much as we reveal, we're not going to take the mystery away from his fans Not knowing all the answers about Boba is part of what makes him so cool.\n\n\nIn The Book of Boba Fett\nBoba Fett's character in the series has received mixed reviews, while Morrison's portrayal of Fett has been praised Some have said that, without Morrison portraying Boba Fett, the series might have been a total disaster and that he is the only face that could have brought Fett back to life [130] [131] Decider's Megan O'Keefe wrote, \"Boba Fett is the least interesting character in The Book of Boba Fett.\" [132] Rich Knight from CinemaBlend stated that he used to not like Fett, but became interested in his character as he was the only one in the series who \"seems like an actual human being\" [133] Chris Edwards of The Guardian said that Disney+ ruined one of the \"coolest and most mysterious characters\" in Star Wars [134]\n\n\nMerchandising\nFett is one of the top five best-selling Star Wars action figures, [15] and Boba Fett-related products are \"among the most expensive\" Star Wars merchandise [4] Fett was the first new mail-away action figure created for The Empire Strikes Back; [2] [9] although advertised as having a rocket-firing backpack, safety concerns led Kenner to sell his rocket attached [2] Gray called the early toy \"a rare and precious commodity\", [113] and one of the rocket-firing prototypes sold at auction for $16,000 in 2003 [24] In 2018 and 2019, two of the prototypes were sold at auction, for £69,000 ($USD92,000) and £90,000 ($USD120,000), respectively—each setting the world record for the highest auction price of a Star Wars toy at that time [135] A fully painted figure with a rare variant on the firing mechanism is planned to be auctioned and estimated to be worth $200,000 [136]\n\n\nSee

Namibia and Papua New Guinea The teams were divided into four pools, named after Gavaskar, Sobers, Cowdrey and Bradman, and the top two sides from each progressed to two Super League pools, whose

failed to qualify for the Super League after a fiasco concerning the composition of their squad – they arrived with seven players who contravened the age restrictions for the tournament The Super

development region To the disappointment of a large crowd at Colombo's SSC, Sri Lanka fell at the final hurdle in a final dominated by India The winners remained unbeaten throughout, and destroyed Australia by 170 runs in the semi-final to underline their supremacy In the other semi-final, Sri Lanka delighted a crowd of 5000 at Galle by beating Pakistan The fact that three of the four semi-finalists were from Asia and so more attuned to the conditions was coincidental – they played the better cricket and, in Pakistan's case, had a very experienced squad England, the defending champions, were most disappointing, and they won only one match against a Test-playing country, and that a last-ball victory over Zimbabwe South Africa, one of the favourites, were desperately unlucky to be eliminated after three no-results gave them three points while Nepal, with four points courtesy of one win over Kenya, went through to the Super League instead The format of the tournament was as in 1997–98, with four groups of four and then a Super League and final Graeme Smith was the tournament's leading run-scorer, with 348 runs at an average of 87.00 Pakistan's Zahid Saeed was the leading wicket-taker, with 15 wickets at 7.60 India's Yuvraj Singh was named Man of the Series India clinched the title for the first time under the captaincy of Mohammed Kaif.\n\n\n2002 (Winner: Australia)\nThe fourth Under-19 World Cup held in New Zealand only confirmed Australia's dominance of the game, and from their opening match, when they obliterated Kenya by 430 runs, through to their comprehensive victory over South Africa in the final, they were never threatened Participating nations included the ten Test-playing nations, plus Canada, Kenya, Namibia, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, and Scotland Their captain, Cameron White, was singled out for praise for his leadership, and he chipped in with 423 runs at 70.50 And they didn't rely on pace either, playing only two seamers and four slow bowlers, with Xavier Doherty, a slow left-armer, leading the wicket-takers with 16 at 9.50 and all without a single wide In contrast, India, the holders, underperformed in their semi-final against South Africa, a team they had easily beaten a week or so earlier They also suffered embarrassing defeats to neighbours Pakistan and Bangladesh Pakistan, however, provided the main upset when they lost to Nepal by 30 runs, and Nepal also gave England a few uneasy moments Zimbabwe won the plate competition, with their expected opponents, Bangladesh, beaten in the semi-final by Nepal Australian Cameron White was the tournament's leading run-scorer, with 423 runs at an average of 70.50 and Xavier Doherty was the leading wicket-taker, with 16 wickets at 9.50 Tatenda Taibu, Zimbabwe's captain, was Man of the Series for his 250 runs and 12 wickets, not to mention his wicket-keeping in between bowling stints.\n\n\n2004 (Winner: Pakistan)\nThe 2004 tournament was held in Bangladesh More than 350,000 spectators saw the 54 matches played in the tournament The finale ended with a close final between the two best teams – West Indies and Pakistan It was won by Pakistan by 25 runs against West Indies and a 30,000 crowd acclaimed the victorious Pakistanis almost as their own The shock was the elimination from the main competition of holders Australia, bowled out for 73 and beaten by Zimbabwe in the group stage when Tinashe Panyangara took 6 for 31, the second-best figures in the competition's history And Australia then lost to Bangladesh in the plate final amid thumping drums and gleeful celebrations The downside was the quality of the cricket, which was often mediocre on some indifferent pitches, and the reporting of six unidentified bowlers for having suspect actions Pakistan would have finished unbeaten but for a hiccup against England – when both teams had already qualified for the semis England reached the last four, which was progress, and Alastair Cook looked a class apart But they came unstuck against West Indies' spinners in the semi-final India completed the semi-finalists Shikhar Dhawan and Suresh Raina were the backbone of a strong batting line-up, and Raina's 90 from just 38 balls against the hapless Scots was as brutal an innings as one will see at any level Both looked international-class already, though faced with a tough task breaking into their senior side's formidable top order The captain Ambati Rayudu had been hailed as the next great batting hope, having scored a century and a double in a first-class match at the age of 17 But he did not score the runs promised and was banned by the referee John Morrison from the semi-final after allowing a funereal over-rate during the Super League win against Sri Lanka: eight overs were bowled in the first 50 minutes India's Shikhar Dhawan was named Man of the Tournament, and was the tournament's leading run-scorer, with 505 runs at an average of 84.16 Bangladeshi Enamul Haque was the leading wicket-taker, with 22 wickets at 10.18.\n\n\n2006 (Winner: Pakistan)\nThis tournament was always going to struggle to live up to the overwhelming response that greeted the previous event in Bangladesh Despite free tickets the matches were sparsely attended even when the home side were in action, but it shouldn't detract from an impressive two weeks which finished with Pakistan securing their second consecutive title in an extraordinary final against India at the Premadasa Stadium Pakistan crumbled to 109, but in a thrilling passage of play reduced India to 9 for 6 Nasir Jamshed, and Anwar Ali, two of the success stories of the tournament, did the damage and there was no way back for India who fell 38 runs short These two teams and Australia were the pick of the sides and along with England – who surpassed expectation to reach the semi-finals after beating a talented Bangladesh side – made up the final four A number of players caught the eye, notably Australia captain Moises Henriques, the Indian batsmen Cheteshwar Pujara – the tournament's leading run-scorer – and teammate Rohit Sharma, along with legspinner Piyush Chawla, who a few weeks later made his Test debut against England However, perhaps the best story of the tournament was Nepal claiming the Plate trophy after a thrilling victory against New Zealand having also beaten South Africa during the event\n\n\n2008 (Winner: India)\nIt was the first time the tournament was held in an Associate Member country The 2008 Under-19 Cricket World Cup was held in Malaysia from 17 February to 2 March 2008 Along with hosts, 15 other teams battled in 44 matches packed into 15 days across three cities India, still smarting from the loss in the previous edition had reason to be upbeat with Tanmay Srivastava, a mature batsman who eventually finished as the tournament's leading run-getter, in their ranks Australia and England had forgettable campaigns, coming up short against the big teams after making mincemeat of the minnows Defending champions Pakistan were fortuitous to reach the semi-finals as their batsmen never really got going and, against South Africa in the semi-finals, Pakistan had to chase 261 New Zealand, boosted by Man of the Tournament Tim Southee, were impressive before losing to India in a narrow run-chase under lights and cloudy skies in the other semi-final South Africa's captain Wayne Parnell had played a major role in ensuring their passage to the summit clash, picking up the most wickets in the tournament en route But they had lost to India in the group stages and lightning did strike twice India under the leadership of Virat Kohli, after being bowled out for 159, emerged triumphant by 12 runs under the D/L method and were crowned champions for the second time \n [2]\n\n\n2010 (Winner: Australia)\nThe 2010 Under-19 Cricket World Cup was held in New Zealand in January 2010 The tournament was hosted in New Zealand after the ICC took it away from Kenya on the flimsiest of reasons which ridiculed its own to spread the game Kenya were further kicked by the ICC as their side was not allowed to participate as it had not won the African qualifying event – a weakened side had been fielded as at the time, as hosts, they did not need to qualify As it was, New Zealand did a decent job but crowds were dismal and the group stages were as tediously predictable as in the senior tournament, with the better-funded big nations dominating South Africa did beat Australia in a good match but a dead rubber The competition came alive in the quarter-finals as West Indies beat England and Sri Lanka defeated South Africa The best tie of the competition came when Pakistan beat fierce rivals India by two wickets with three balls remaining in a low-scoring match The final between Australia and Pakistan was a rematch of the first tournament, and Australia won by 25 runs in a game where fortunes ebbed and flowed throughout.\n\n\n2012 (Winner: India)\nThe 2012 Under-19 Cricket World Cup was held in the Tony Ireland Stadium, Australia Along with the ten test playing nations, Afghanistan, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, Ireland, Scotland and Namibia also participated in this tournament Australia lost against India in the final on 26 August 2012 India's third U19 World Cup meant they tied for the most wins with Australia Sri Lanka could not go through into the last eight but won the Plate championship by defeating Afghanistan by 7 wickets Reece Topley of England was the highest wicket taker whereas Anamul Haque of Bangladesh was the top run getter India won the final against Australia with 14 balls to spare ank'lld 6 wickets remaining Captain Unmukt Chand played a match winning knock of 111* not out in 130 balls with the help of 6 sixes & 7 fours Sandeep Sharma also excelled with four wickets under his belt.\n\n\n2014 (Winner: South Africa)\nThe 2014 Under-19 Cricket World-Cup was held in Dubai (U.A.E.) in 2014 It was the first time that U.A.E had hosted an ICC event Afghanistan was the only non-full member to qualify for the Quarter Finals This was the first time that Afghanistan reached the last eight of this tournament, courtesy of their stellar performance against Australia in the group stage In fact, this was the second time that a non-test playing nation qualified for the Super League/Quarter Finals, Nepal being the first one in the 2000 edition.\nIndia wobbled in the Quarter Finals against England and finally lost in the final over This was the first semi-final berth for England in the last four editions Pakistan beat England in the semis to reach its fifth Under-19 Final, becoming the first team to do so South Africa beat Australia in the second semi-final In a one-sided final, South Africa beat Pakistan and claimed its maiden U-19 World Cup title Corbin Bosch, son of former South African cricketer late Tertius Bosch, was the Man of the Match in the finals and Aiden Markram was the Man

cricket tournament contested by national under-19 teams. The tournament has been held annually since 1988, with the exception of a few years due to various reasons such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\nThe inaugural event was titled the McDonald's Bicentennial Youth World Cup, and was held in 1988 as part of the Australian Bicentenary celebrations. It took place in South Australia and Victoria, and featured teams from the seven Test-playing nations, as well as an ICC Associates XI. The tournament was a round-robin format, and Australia lost only one match, their final round-robin game against Pakistan, by which time they had qualified for the semis. They went on to beat Pakistan by five wickets in the final, thanks to an unbeaten hundred from Brett Williams.\n\nThe tournament was notable for the number of future international players who competed. Future England captains Nasser Hussain and Mike Atherton played, as did Indian spinner Venkatapathy Raju, New Zealand all-rounder Chris Cairns, Pakistanis Mushtaq Ahmed and Inzamam-ul-Haq, Sri Lankan Sanath Jayasuriya, and West Indians Brian Lara, Ridley Jacobs, and Jimmy Adams. Australia's Brett Williams was the leading run-scorer, with 471 runs at an average of 52.33, while Wayne Holdsworth from Australia and Mushtaq Ahmed were the leading wicket-takers, with 19 wickets at averages of 12.52 and 16.21 respectively.\n\n1988 (Winner: Australia)\n-----------------------\n\nThe inaugural event was titled the McDonald's Bicentennial Youth World Cup, and was held in 1988 as part of the Australian Bicentenary celebrations.

The event was relaunched in South Africa as a biennial tournament, and featured teams from the nine Test-playing nations, as well as Bangladesh, Kenya, Scotland, Ireland, Denmark, Namibia, and Papua New Guinea. The teams were divided into four pools, named after Gavaskar, Sobers, Cowdrey, and Bradman, and the top two sides from each progressed to two Super League pools, whose winners advanced to the final. In order to give everyone a decent amount of cricket, the non-qualifiers competed in a Plate League, won by Bangladesh, who beat West Indies in the final.\n\n2000 (Winner: India)\n------------------\n\nThe 2000 tournament was held in Sri Lanka, and replicated the format from 1998. Participating nations included the nine Test-playing nations, as well as Bangladesh, Kenya, Ireland, Namibia, Holland, Nepal, and a combined team from the Americas development region.

average of 52.33 Wayne Holdsworth from Australia and Mushtaq Ahmed were the leading wicket-takers, with 19 wickets at averages of 12.52 and 16.21 respectively.\n\n\n1998 (Winner: England)\nEngland were the unexpected winners of the second Under-19 World Cup in South Africa In 1998, the event was relaunched in South Africa as a biennial tournament The only previous tournament of its kind was held ten years earlier In addition to the nine Test-playing nations, there were teams from Bangladesh, Kenya, Scotland, Ireland, Denmark, Namibia and Papua New Guinea The teams were divided into four pools, named after Gavaskar, Sobers, Cowdrey and Bradman, and the top two sides from each progressed to two Super League pools, whose winners advanced to the final In order to give everyone a decent amount of cricket, the non-qualifiers competed in a Plate League, won by Bangladesh, who beat West Indies in the final West Indies failed to qualify for the Super League after a fiasco concerning the composition of their squad – they arrived with seven players who contravened the age restrictions for the tournament The Super League, in which every game was covered live on South African satellite television, also threw up a number of shocks and tense finishes; both pools came down to net run-rate at the finish England, from being down and almost out, beat Pakistan – who surprisingly lost all three of their games – but lost a rain-affected match to India Australia had beaten India and Pakistan and were favourites to reach the final Only a massive defeat by England could deny them: but that is precisely what they suffered In front of a crowd of about 6,000 at Newlands, they were bowled out for 147 New Zealand joined England in the final, where a century from England's Stephen Peters won the day.\nChris Gayle was the tournament's leading run-scorer, with 364 runs at an average of 72.80 West Indian Ramnaresh Sarwan and Zimbabwean Mluleki Nkala were the leading wicket-takers, with 16 wickets at 10.81 and 13.06 respectively.\n\n\n2000 (Winner: India)\nThe 2000 tournament was held in Sri Lanka, and replicated the format from 1998 Participating nations included the nine Test-playing nations, as well as Bangladesh, Kenya, Ireland, Namibia, Holland, Nepal and a combined team from the Americas development region To the disappointment of a large crowd at Colombo's SSC, Sri Lanka fell at the final hurdle in a final dominated by India The winners remained unbeaten throughout, and destroyed Australia by 170 runs in the semi-final to underline their supremacy In the other semi-final, Sri Lanka delighted a crowd of 5000 at Galle by beating Pakistan The fact that three of the four semi-finalists were from Asia and so more attuned to the conditions was coincidental – they played the better cricket and, in Pakistan's case, had a very experienced squad England, the defending champions, were most disappointing, and they won only one match against a Test-playing country, and that a last-ball victory over Zimbabwe South Africa, one of the favourites, were desperately unlucky to be eliminated after three no-results gave them three points while Nepal, with four points courtesy of one win over Kenya, went through to the Super League instead The format of the tournament was as in 1997–98, with four groups of four and then a Super League and final Graeme Smith was the tournament's leading run-scorer, with 348 runs at an average of 87.00 Pakistan's Zahid Saeed was the leading wicket-taker, with 15 wickets at 7.60 India's Yuvraj Singh was named Man of the Series India clinched the title for the first time under the captaincy of Mohammed Kaif.\n\n\n2002 (Winner: Australia)\nThe fourth Under-19 World Cup held in New Zealand only confirmed Australia's dominance of the game, and from their opening match, when they obliterated Kenya by 430 runs, through to their comprehensive victory over South Africa in the final, they were never threatened Participating nations included the ten Test-playing nations, plus Canada, Kenya, Namibia, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, and Scotland Their captain, Cameron White, was singled out for praise for his leadership, and he chipped in with 423 runs at 70.50 And they didn't rely on pace either, playing only two seamers and four slow bowlers, with Xavier Doherty, a slow left-armer, leading the wicket-takers with 16 at 9.50 and all without a single wide In contrast, India, the holders, underperformed in their semi-final against South Africa, a team they had easily beaten a week or so earlier They also suffered embarrassing defeats to neighbours Pakistan and Bangladesh Pakistan, however, provided the main upset when they lost to Nepal by 30 runs, and Nepal also gave England a few uneasy moments Zimbabwe won the plate competition, with their expected opponents, Bangladesh, beaten in the semi-final by Nepal Australian Cameron White was the tournament's leading run-scorer, with 423 runs at an average of 70.50 and Xavier Doherty was the leading wicket-taker, with 16 wickets at 9.50 Tatenda Taibu, Zimbabwe's captain, was Man of the Series for his 250 runs and 12 wickets, not to mention his wicket-keeping in between bowling stints.\n\n\n2004 (Winner: Pakistan)\nThe 2004 tournament was held in Bangladesh More than 350,000 spectators saw the 54 matches played in the tournament The finale ended with a close final between the two best teams – West Indies and Pakistan It was won by Pakistan by 25 runs against West Indies and a 30,000 crowd acclaimed the victorious Pakistanis almost as their own The shock was the elimination from the main competition of holders Australia, bowled out for 73 and beaten by Zimbabwe in the group stage when Tinashe Panyangara took 6 for 31, the second-best figures in the competition's history And Australia then lost to Bangladesh in the plate final amid thumping drums and gleeful celebrations The downside was the quality of the cricket, which was often mediocre on some indifferent pitches, and the reporting of six unidentified bowlers for having suspect actions Pakistan would have finished unbeaten but for a hiccup against England – when both teams had already qualified for the semis England reached the last four, which was progress, and Alastair Cook looked a class apart But they came unstuck against West Indies' spinners in the semi-final India completed the semi-finalists Shikhar Dhawan and Suresh Raina were the backbone of a strong batting line-up, and Raina's 90 from just 38 balls against the hapless Scots was as brutal an innings as one will see at any level Both looked international-class already, though faced with a tough task breaking into their senior side's formidable top order The captain Ambati Rayudu had been hailed as the next great batting hope, having scored a century and a double in a first-class match at the age of 17 But he did not score the runs promised and was banned by the referee John Morrison from the semi-final after allowing a funereal over-rate during the Super League win against Sri Lanka: eight overs were bowled in the first 50 minutes India's Shikhar Dhawan was named Man of the Tournament, and was the tournament's leading run-scorer, with 505 runs at an average of 84.16 Bangladeshi Enamul Haque was the leading wicket-taker, with 22 wickets at 10.18.\n\n\n2006 (Winner: Pakistan)\nThis tournament was always going to struggle to live up to the overwhelming response that greeted the previous event in Bangladesh Despite free tickets the matches were sparsely attended even when the home side were in action, but it shouldn't detract from an impressive two weeks which finished with Pakistan securing their second consecutive title in an extraordinary final against India at the Premadasa Stadium Pakistan crumbled to 109, but in a thrilling passage of play reduced India to 9 for 6 Nasir Jamshed, and Anwar Ali, two of the success stories of the tournament, did the damage and there was no way back for India who fell 38 runs short These two teams and Australia were the pick of the sides and along with England – who surpassed expectation to reach the semi-finals after beating a talented Bangladesh side – made up the final four A number of players caught the eye, notably Australia captain Moises Henriques, the Indian batsmen Cheteshwar Pujara – the tournament's leading run-scorer – and teammate Rohit Sharma, along with legspinner Piyush Chawla, who a few weeks later made his Test debut against England However, perhaps the best story of the tournament was Nepal claiming the Plate trophy after a thrilling victory against New Zealand having also beaten South Africa during the event\n\n\n2008 (Winner: India)\nIt was the first time the tournament was held in an Associate Member country The 2008 Under-19 Cricket World Cup was held in Malaysia from 17 February to 2 March 2008 Along with hosts, 15 other teams battled in 44 matches packed into 15 days across three cities India, still smarting from the loss in the previous edition had reason to be upbeat with Tanmay Srivastava, a mature batsman who eventually finished as the tournament's leading run-getter, in their ranks Australia and England had forgettable campaigns, coming up short against the big teams after making mincemeat of the minnows Defending champions Pakistan were fortuitous to reach the semi-finals as their batsmen never really got going and, against South Africa in the semi-finals, Pakistan had to chase 261 New Zealand, boosted by Man of the Tournament Tim Southee, were impressive before losing to India in a narrow run-chase under lights and cloudy skies in the other semi-final South Africa's captain Wayne Parnell had played a major role in ensuring their passage to the summit clash, picking up the most wickets in the tournament en route But they had lost to India in the group stages and lightning did strike twice India under the leadership of Virat Kohli, after being bowled out for 159, emerged triumphant by 12 runs under the D/L method and were crowned champions for the second time \n [2]\n\n\n2010 (Winner: Australia)\nThe 2010 Under-19 Cricket World Cup was held in New Zealand in January 2010 The tournament was hosted in New Zealand after the ICC took it away from Kenya on the flimsiest of reasons which ridiculed its own to spread the game Kenya were further kicked by the ICC as their side was not allowed to participate as it had not won the African qualifying event – a weakened side had been fielded as at the time, as hosts, they did not need to qualify As it was, New Zealand did a decent job but crowds were dismal and the group stages were as tediously predictable as in the senior tournament, with the better-funded big nations dominating South Africa did beat Australia in a good match but a dead rubber The competition came alive in the quarter-finals as West Indies beat England and Sri Lanka defeated South Africa The best tie of the competition came when Pakistan beat fierce rivals India by two wickets with three balls remaining in a low-scoring match The final between Australia and Pakistan was a rematch of the first tournament, and Australia won by 25 runs in a game where fortunes ebbed and flowed throughout.\n\n\n2012 (Winner: India)\nThe 2012 Under-19 Cricket World Cup was held in the Tony Ireland Stadium, Australia Along with the ten test playing nations, Afghanistan, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, Ireland, Scotland and Namibia also participated in this tournament Australia lost against India in the final on 26 August 2012 India's third U19 World Cup meant they tied for the most wins with Australia Sri Lanka could not go through into the last eight but won the Plate championship by defeating Afghanistan by 7 wickets Reece Topley of England was the highest wicket taker whereas Anamul Haque of Bangladesh was the top run getter India won the final against Australia with 14 balls to spare ank'lld 6 wickets remaining Captain Unmukt Chand played a match winning knock of 111* not out in 130 balls with the help of 6 sixes & 7 fours Sandeep Sharma also excelled with four wickets under his belt.\n\n\n2014 (Winner: South Africa)\nThe 2014 Under-19 Cricket World-Cup was held in Dubai (U.A.E.) in 2014 It was the first time that U.A.E had hosted an ICC event Afghanistan was the only non-full member to qualify for the Quarter Finals This was the first time that Afghanistan reached the last eight of this tournament, courtesy of their stellar performance against Australia in the group stage In fact, this was the second time that a non-test playing nation qualified for the Super League/Quarter Finals, Nepal being the first one in the 2000 edition.\nIndia wobbled in the Quarter Finals against England and finally lost in the final over This was the first semi-final berth for England in the last four editions Pakistan beat England in the semis to reach its fifth Under-19 Final, becoming the first team to do so South Africa beat Australia in the second semi-final In a one-sided final, South Africa beat Pakistan and claimed its maiden U-19 World Cup title Corbin Bosch, son of former South African cricketer late Tertius Bosch, was the Man of the Match in the finals and Aiden Markram was the Man of the Series South Africa did not lose even a single match in the entire tournament.\n\n\n2016 (Winner: West Indies)\nThe 2016 Under-19 Cricket World Cup was held in Bangladesh It was the eleventh edition of the Under-19 World Cup, and the second to be held in Bangladesh On 5 January 2016, Australia announced that the Australian squad had pulled out of the tournament, citing security reasons [3] Defending champions South Africa

match-winning 101* under the captaincy of Prithvi Shaw  [6] The Man of the match was awarded to Manjot Kalra, while player of the tournament was awarded to Shubman Gill India now holds the most wins record in Under-19 World Cup.\nRahul Dravid is the head coach of this India Under-19 Team Later he was appointed as India national cricket team head coach on Nov 2021\n\n\n2020 (Winner:

The concept of the show came from WWE's established Hell in a Cell match, in which competitors fought inside a 20-foot-high roofed cell structure surrounding the ring and ringside area. The main event match of the card was contested under the Hell in a Cell stipulation. During WrestleMania Backlash on May 16, 2021, the 2021 event was moved from the October slot to June, which was only the second time for the event to not be held in October; the first time was the September 2018 event. The 2021 event was the 13th Hell in a Cell and was held on June 20, 2021—the previously scheduled date for Money in the Bank, which was moved to July 18—and featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event aired on pay-per-view (PPV) worldwide and was available to livestream on the WWE Network in international markets, and was the first Hell in a Cell to livestream on Peacock after the American version of the WWE Network merged under Peacock in March.\n\n**Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic**\n\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic that began affecting the industry in mid-March 2020, WWE had to present the majority of its programming from a behind closed doors set. Initially, Raw and SmackDown's television shows and PPVs were done at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida. A limited number of Performance Center trainees and friends and family members of the wrestlers were later utilized to serve as the live audience. In late August, these programs were moved to a bio-secure bubble called the WWE ThunderDome. The select live audience was no longer utilized as the bubble allowed fans to attend the events virtually for free and be seen on the nearly 1,000 LED boards within the arena. Additionally, the ThunderDome utilized various special effects to further enhance wrestlers' entrances, and arena audio was mixed with that of the chants from the virtual fans. After being hosted at Orlando's Amway Center and Tropicana Field in St Petersburg, Florida, the ThunderDome was relocated to the Yuengling Center in Tampa, Florida in April 2021.\n\n**Storylines**\n\nThe event comprised seven matches, including one on the Kickoff pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, Monday Night Raw and Friday Night SmackDown.\n\n**Canceled and rescheduled match**\n\nOn the June 4 episode of SmackDown, The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) challenged Rey Mysterio and Dominik Mysterio for the SmackDown Tag Team Championship, however, the match ended in a controversial finish in which the referee did not notice that Jimmy had his shoulder up during the pin. The Usos were granted a rematch later that same night, but during the rematch, The Usos' cousin and Universal Champion, Roman Reigns, interfered by attacking the Mysterios, not wanting The Usos to embarrass themselves again. Following the match, Reigns brutally attacked Rey's son Dominik, which Jimmy felt Reigns took too far, also furthering tensions between Reigns and Jimmy. The following week, Rey confronted Reigns and challenged him to a Hell in a Cell match, wanting to take revenge on Reigns for what he did to Dominik, and a brawl ensued. The next day on Talking Smack, Reigns' special counsel Paul Heyman accepted Rey's challenge on Reigns' behalf with the Universal Championship on the line. On June 17, however, Rey posted to Twitter, stating that he did not want to wait until Sunday, and it was announced that the match would instead take place on the June 18 episode of SmackDown, marking the first Hell in a Cell match to take place on an episode of SmackDown. Reigns defeated Rey in 16 minutes to retain the title.\n\n**Event**\n\nDuring the Hell in a Cell Kickoff pre-show, one-half of the WWE Women's Tag Team Champions, Natalya (accompanied by her tag team partner, Tamina), faced Mandy Rose (accompanied by Dana Brooke). In the end, Natalya forced Rose to submit to the Sharpshooter to win the match.\n\n**Preliminary matches**\n\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with Bianca Belair defending the SmackDown Women's Championship against Bayley in a Hell in a Cell match. During the early half of the match, as Belair attacked Bayley with her ponytail, Bayley blocked the attacks with a chair. Later, Bayley tied Belair's ponytail on the bottom ring rope and as Bayley attempted to attack Belair, Bayley tripped and fell onto the steel steps. Bayley would also bite the arm of Belair. In the end, Belair performed the Kiss of Death on Bayley on a ladder to retain the title.\n\n**Main event**\n\nIn the main event, Bobby Lashley (accompanied by MVP) defended the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre in a Last Chance Hell in a Cell match. Midway through the match, the referee was knocked out. McIntyre called for the referee guarding the cell door on the outside of the cage to take over and officiate the match. MVP used the opportunity to get inside the cage when the referee opened the cell door. After more fighting, McIntyre set up for the Claymore Kick, but MVP held his leg to prevent him from attacking Lashley. As McIntyre tried freeing himself from MVP's grip, Lashley rolled up McIntyre with a roll-up to win and retain the title. As per the stipulation, McIntyre could no longer challenge for the WWE Championship for the rest of Lashley's tenure as champion.\n\n**Reception**\n\nHell in a Cell 2021 received mixed reviews from fans and critics, with criticism for the Alexa Bliss vs Shayna Baszler match in particular. Christopher Jeter of Fansided wrote, \"This attempt to make the audience believe that Bliss is so frightening that even Shayna Baszler is flustered by her was bad enough when fans had to sit through that Alexa's Playground segment a couple of weeks ago on Raw Now, they had to endure Bliss literally laughing off Baszler's offense — including the arm stomp that used to write wrestlers off of TV in NXT — and, sigh, Alexa hypnotizing Baszler and Nia Jax If nothing else, Bliss pinning Baszler clean should signal the end of this nonsense, or at least Baszler's involvement in it.\"\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nOn the following episode of Raw, Bobby Lashley gloated about not having to defend the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre ever again. The New Day's Kofi Kingston, who had defeated Lashley in a non-title match on the May 17 episode of Raw and also stated that he never received a rematch after losing the WWE Championship in October 2019 at SmackDown's 20th Anniversary, came out and challenged Lashley for the title at Money in the Bank. Lashley accepted, but said he wanted to face Kingston's New Day partner, Xavier Woods, later that night. This led to Lashley competing in a Hell in a Cell match for the second straight night, where he defeated Woods. Afterwards, Lashley continued his attack on Woods while Kingston was forced to watch from outside the cell.\n\nSmackDown Women's Champion Bianca Belair and Cesaro continued to feud with Bayley and Seth Rollins, respectively. On the following episode of SmackDown, Bayley and Rollins defeated Belair and Cesaro in a mixed tag team match in which Bayley pinned Belair. This led to a rematch between Belair and Bayley being scheduled for Money in the Bank as an \"I Quit\" match. However, on July 9, WWE announced that Bayley suffered a legitimate injury while training that would sideline her for up to nine months; this was followed by an announcement that a replacement would be named for Bayley and the title match would be a regular singles match held on the July 16 episode.

[34] Reigns defeated Rey in 16 minutes to retain the title [26]\n\n\nEvent\nDuring the Hell in a Cell Kickoff pre-show, one-half of the WWE Women's Tag Team Champions, Natalya (accompanied by her tag team partner, Tamina), faced Mandy Rose (accompanied by Dana Brooke) In the end, Natalya forced Rose to submit to the Sharpshooter to win the match [35]\n\n\nPre-show\nDuring the Hell in a Cell Kickoff pre-show, one-half of the WWE Women's Tag Team Champions, Natalya (accompanied by her tag team partner, Tamina), faced Mandy Rose (accompanied by Dana Brooke) In the end, Natalya forced Rose to submit to the Sharpshooter to win the match [35]\n\n\nPreliminary matches\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with Bianca Belair defending the SmackDown Women's Championship against Bayley in a Hell in a Cell match During the early half of the match, as Belair attacked Bayley with her ponytail, Bayley blocked the attacks with a chair Later, Bayley tied Belair's ponytail on the bottom ring rope and as Bayley attempted to attack Belair, Bayley tripped and fell onto the steel steps Bayley would also bite the arm of Belair In the end, Belair performed the Kiss of Death on Bayley on a ladder to retain the title [36]\n\n\nMain event\nIn the main event, Bobby Lashley (accompanied by MVP) defended the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre in a Last Chance Hell in a Cell match Midway through the match, the referee was knocked out McIntyre called for the referee guarding the cell door on the outside of the cage to take over and officiate the match MVP used the opportunity to get inside the cage when the referee opened the cell door After more fighting, McIntyre set up for the Claymore Kick, but MVP held his leg to prevent him from attacking Lashley As McIntyre tried freeing himself from MVP's grip, Lashley rolled up McIntyre with a roll-up to win and retain the title As per the stipulation, McIntyre could no longer challenge for the WWE Championship for the rest of Lashley's tenure as champion [36]\n\n\nReception\nHell in a Cell 2021 received mixed reviews from fans and critics, with criticism for the Alexa Bliss vs Shayna Bazler match in particular Christopher Jeter of Fansided wrote, \"This attempt to make the audience believe that Bliss is so frightening that even Shayna Baszler is flustered by her was bad enough when fans had to sit through that Alexa's Playground segment a couple of weeks ago on Raw Now, they had to endure Bliss literally laughing off Baszler's offense — including the arm stomp that used to write wrestlers off of TV in NXT — and, sigh, Alexa hypnotizing Baszler and Nia Jax If nothing else, Bliss pinning Baszler clean should signal the end of this nonsense, or at least Baszler's involvement in it\" [37]\n\n\nAftermath\nOn the following episode of Raw, Bobby Lashley gloated about not having to defend the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre ever again The New Day's Kofi Kingston, who had defeated Lashley in a non-title match on the May 17 episode of Raw and also stated that he never received a rematch after losing the WWE Championship in October 2019 at SmackDown's 20th Anniversary, came out and challenged Lashley for the title at Money in the Bank Lashley accepted, but said he wanted to face Kingston's New Day partner, Xavier Woods, later that night This led to Lashley competing in a Hell in a Cell match for the second straight night, where he defeated Woods Afterwards, Lashley continued his attack on Woods while Kingston was forced to watch from outside the cell [41]\n\n\nRaw\nOn the following episode of Raw, Bobby Lashley gloated about not having to defend the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre ever again The New Day's Kofi Kingston, who had defeated Lashley in a non-title match on the May 17 episode of Raw and also stated that he never received a rematch after losing the WWE Championship in October 2019 at SmackDown's 20th Anniversary, came out and challenged Lashley for the title at Money in the Bank Lashley accepted, but said he wanted to face Kingston's New Day partner, Xavier Woods, later that night This led to Lashley competing in a Hell in a Cell match for the second straight night, where he defeated Woods Afterwards, Lashley continued his attack on Woods while Kingston was forced to watch from outside the cell [41]\n\n\nSmackDown\nSmackDown Women's Champion Bianca Belair and Cesaro continued to feud with Bayley and Seth Rollins, respectively On the following episode of SmackDown, Bayley and Rollins defeated Belair and Cesaro in a mixed tag team match in which Bayley pinned Belair [43] This led to a rematch between Belair and Bayley being scheduled for Money in the Bank as an \"I Quit\" match [44] However, on July 9, WWE announced that Bayley suffered a legitimate injury while training that would sideline her for up to nine months; [45] this was followed by an announcement that a replacement would be named for Bayley and the title match would be a regular singles match held on the July 16 episode Carmella was revealed as Bayley's replacement [46]\n\n\nResults\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

India–Pakistan bid would have seen the tournament held in late 1991 [4] The seven full members of the ICC were given two votes each in the ballot, while the 18 associate members were given one vote

"**1992 Cricket World Cup**\n\nThe 1992 Cricket World Cup was the sixth edition of the ICC Cricket World Cup, a tournament held every four years for national cricket teams. The tournament was hosted by Australia and New Zealand, with the matches played in various cities across both countries. This was the first time that the tournament was held in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\n**Host selection**\n\nAustralia and New Zealand were awarded the hosting rights in January 1989, defeating a joint India-Pakistan bid. The bidding process involved seven full members of the ICC, who each had two votes, and 18 associate members, who each had one vote. The winning bid reportedly enjoyed strong support from the ICC associate members.\n\n**Firsts**\n\nThe 1992 World Cup was the first to feature coloured player clothing, white cricket balls, and black sight screens. This was also the first Cricket World Cup to be held in the Southern Hemisphere, and the first to include South Africa, who had been allowed to re-join the International Cricket Council as a Test-playing nation after the end of apartheid in 1990. For the first time, the World Cup was not held after a four-year gap, but after a five-year gap.\n\n**Format**\n\nThe format of the tournament was changed from previous editions, with a complete round-robin replacing the former two qualifying groups. The initial draw was released with eight competing countries and 28 round-robin matches, plus two semi-finals and a final. In late 1991, South Africa were re-admitted to the International Cricket Council after 21 years of exclusion due to apartheid, and the draw was amended to include them, adding another eight matches to the round-robin.\n\n**Teams**\n\nThe 1992 World Cup featured the seven Test teams at that time. The teams were:\n\n* Australia\n* England\n* India\n* New Zealand\n* Pakistan\n* South Africa\n* West Indies\n\n**Venues**\n\nThe tournament was played in various cities across Australia and New Zealand, including:\n\n* Melbourne\n* Sydney\n* Perth\n* Brisbane\n* Adelaide\n* Auckland\n* Christchurch\n* Wellington\n\n**Umpires**\n\nEleven umpires were selected to officiate at the World Cup: two from each of the host nations, Australia and New Zealand, and one from each of the other participating nations.\n\n**Referees**\n\nTwo match referees were also selected to supervise the semi-finals and final.\n\n**Squads**\n\nCo-hosts New Zealand proved the surprise package of the tournament, winning their first seven consecutive games to finish on top of the table after the round-robin. The other hosts, Australia, one of the pre-tournament favourites lost their first two matches. They recovered somewhat to win four of the remaining six, but narrowly missed out on the semi-finals. The West Indies also finished with a 4–4 record, but were just behind Australia on run-rate. South Africa made a triumphant return to international cricket with a win over Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground in their first match. They and England had solid campaigns and easily qualified for the semi-finals, despite upset losses to Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe respectively. India had a disappointing tournament and never looked likely to progress beyond the round-robin. Sri Lanka were still establishing themselves at the highest level and beat only Zimbabwe (who did not yet have Test status) and South Africa.\n\n**Round-robin stage**\n\nThe round-robin stage of the tournament saw the teams competing in a group stage, with the top four teams qualifying for the semi-finals. The teams played each other in a round-robin format, with the team earning the most points qualifying for the semi-finals.\n\n**Points table**\n\nThe points table for the round-robin stage was as follows:\n\n| Team | Played | Won | Lost | Tied | NR | Points |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| New Zealand | 7 | 7 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 14 |\n| Australia | 7 | 4 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 8 |\n| West Indies | 7 | 4 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 8 |\n| England | 7 | 4 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 8 |\n| South Africa | 7 | 4 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 8 |\n| Sri Lanka | 7 | 2 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 4 |\n| Zimbabwe | 7 | 1 | 6 | 0 | 0 | 2 |\n| India | 7 | 1 | 6 | 0 | 0 | 2 |\n\n**Tournament progression**\n\nIn the first semi-final, Pakistan defeated tournament favourites New Zealand in a high-scoring match to win their first semi-final in four attempts and book a place in the World Cup Final for the first time.

He smashed 60 runs in 37 balls in the chase to achieve the target with one over remaining and also won the Man of the Match award.\n\n**Knockout stage**\n\nIn the knockout stage of the tournament, the teams competing in the semi-finals and final. The semi-finals were played on December 9, 1992, with the winners qualifying for the final.\n\n**Semi-finals**\n\nIn the first semi-final, Pakistan defeated tournament favourites New Zealand in a high-scoring match to win their first semi-final in four attempts and book a place in the World Cup Final for the first time. In the second semi-final, England defeated the West Indies by 19 runs to qualify for the final.\n\n**Final**\n\nIn the final, Pakistan beat England by 22 runs at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). The match was a thrilling contest, with both teams giving their all. Derek Pringle took two early wickets for England before Imran Khan and Javed Miandad added 139 for the third wicket to steady the Pakistan innings. Imran hit a huge six off Richard Illingworth that landed far back into the members section. Imran played a captain's innings, getting a score of 72 and Miandad 58 to steady the innings, expectedly followed by an onslaught from Inzamam (42) and Wasim Akram (33) enabling Pakistan to give England a fighting target of 250. England's batsmen struggled to reach the target, with Pakistan eventually winning the match by 22 runs.\n\n**Statistics**\n\nThe statistics for the tournament were as follows:\n\n* Total runs scored: 6,184\n* Total wickets taken: 1,514\n* Average runs per wicket: 4.08\n* Highest individual score: 108 by Wasim Akram (Pakistan)\n* Highest partnership: 187 by Imran Khan and Javed Miandad (Pakistan)\n* Fastest fifty: 37 balls by Inzamam-ul-Haq (Pakistan)\n* Man of the Series: Imran Khan (Pakistan)\n\n**Man of the Series**\n\nA notable feature of this World Cup was the innovative tactics employed by New Zealand captain Martin Crowe, who opened his team's bowling with spin bowler Dipak Patel, rather than with a fast bowler, as is usual practice.

These innovations proved successful for New Zealand, who went on to win the tournament.\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe 1992 World Cup was a significant tournament for Pakistan, who won their first World Cup title. The tournament also saw the return of South Africa to international cricket after a 21-year absence.

{"title": "Ireland", "content": "\nName\nThe names Ireland and Éire derive from Old Irish Ériu, a goddess in Irish mythology first recorded in the ninth century The etymology of Ériu is disputed but may derive from the Proto-Indo-European root *h2uer, referring to flowing water [17]\n\n\nHistory\nDuring the last glacial period, and until about 16,000 BC, much of Ireland was periodically covered in ice [18] The relative sea level was less than 50m lower resulting in an ice bridge (but not a land bridge) forming between Ireland and Great Britain [19] By 14,000 BC this ice bridge existed only between Northern Ireland and Scotland and by 12,000 BC Ireland was completely separated from Great Britain [20] Later, around 6,100 BC, Great Britain became separated from continental Europe [21] Until recently, the earliest evidence of human activity in Ireland was dated at 12,500 years ago, demonstrated by a butchered bear bone found in a cave in County Clare [22] Since 2021, the earliest evidence of human activity in Ireland is dated to 33,000 years ago [23]\n\n\nPrehistoric Ireland\nDuring the last glacial period, and until about 16,000 BC, much of Ireland was periodically covered in ice [18] The relative sea level was less than 50m lower resulting in an ice bridge (but not a land bridge) forming between Ireland and Great Britain [19] By 14,000 BC this ice bridge existed only

Until recently, the earliest evidence of human activity in Ireland was dated at 12,500 years ago, demonstrated by a butchered bear bone found in a cave in County Clare [22] Since 2021, the earliest evidence of human activity in Ireland is dated to 33,000 years ago [23]\n\n\nEmergence of Celtic Ireland\nHow and when the island became Celtic has been debated for close to a century, with the migrations of the Celts being one of the more enduring themes of archaeological and linguistic studies The most recent genetic research strongly associates the spread of Indo-European languages (including Celtic) through Western Europe with a people bringing a composite Beaker culture, with its arrival in Britain and Ireland dated to around the middle of the third millennium BC [28] According to John T Koch and others, Ireland in the Late Bronze Age was part of a maritime trading-network culture called the Atlantic Bronze Age that also included Britain, western France and Iberia, and that this is where Celtic languages developed [29] [30] [31] [32] This contrasts with the traditional view that their origin lies in mainland Europe with the Hallstatt culture [33]\n\n\nLate antiquity and early medieval times\nThe earliest written records of Ireland come from classical Greco-Roman geographers Ptolemy in his Almagest refers to Ireland as Mikra Brettania (\"Little Britain\"), in contrast to the larger island, which he called Megale Brettania (\"Great Britain\") [41] In his map of Ireland in his later work, Geography, Ptolemy refers to Ireland as Iouernia and to Great Britain as Albion These 'new' names were likely to have been the local names for the islands at the time The earlier names, in contrast, were likely to have been coined before direct contact with local peoples was made [42]\n\n\nNorman and English invasions\nOn 1 May 1169, an expedition of Cambro-Norman knights, with an army of about 600 men, landed at Bannow Strand in present-day County Wexford It was led by Richard de Clare, known as 'Strongbow' owing to his prowess as an archer [58] The invasion, which coincided with a period of renewed Norman expansion, was at the invitation of Dermot Mac Murrough, King of Leinster [59]\n\n\nGaelicisation\nFrom the mid-14th century, after the Black Death, Norman settlements in Ireland went into a period of decline The Norman rulers and the Gaelic Irish elites intermarried and the areas under Norman rule became Gaelicised In some parts, a hybrid Hiberno-Norman culture emerged In response, the Irish parliament passed the Statutes of Kilkenny in 1367 These were a set of laws designed to prevent the assimilation of the Normans into Irish society by requiring English subjects in Ireland to speak English, follow English customs and abide by English law [65]\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Ireland\nThe title of King of Ireland was re-created in 1542 by Henry VIII, the then King of England, of the Tudor dynasty English rule was reinforced and expanded in Ireland during the latter part of the 16th century, leading to the Tudor conquest of Ireland A near-complete conquest was achieved by the turn of the 17th century, following the Nine Years' War and the Flight of the Earls.\n\n\n1798 Rebellion\nIn 1798, members of the Protestant Dissenter tradition (mainly Presbyterian) made common cause with Roman Catholics in a republican rebellion inspired and led by the Society of United Irishmen, with the aim of creating an independent Ireland Despite assistance from France the rebellion was put down by British and Irish government and yeomanry forces The rebellion lasted from the 24th of May to the 12th of October that year and saw the establishment of the short lived Irish Republic (1798) in the province on Connacht It saw numerous battles across the island with an estimated 30,000 dead with some listed below (for full list see main article.)\n\n\nUnion with Great Britain\nAs a direct result of the 1798 rebellion in its aftermath in 1800, the British and Irish parliaments both passed Acts of Union that, with effect from 1 January 1801, merged the Kingdom of Ireland and the Kingdom of Great Britain to create a United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland [75]\n\n\nPartition\nIn December 1921, the Anglo-Irish Treaty was concluded between the British government and representatives of the Second Dáil It gave Ireland complete independence in its home affairs and practical independence for foreign policy, but an opt-out clause allowed Northern Ireland to remain within the United Kingdom, which it immediately exercised Additionally, Members of the Free State Parliament were required to swear an oath of allegiance to the Constitution of the Irish Free State and make a statement of faithfulness to the king [88] Disagreements over these provisions led to a split in the nationalist movement and a subsequent Irish Civil War between the new government of the Irish Free State and those opposed to the treaty, led by Éamon de Valera The civil war officially ended in May 1923 when de Valera issued a cease-fire order [89]\n\n\nIndependence\nDuring its first decade, the newly formed Irish Free State was governed by the victors of the civil war When de Valera achieved power, he took advantage of the Statute of Westminster and political circumstances to build upon inroads to greater sovereignty made by the previous government The oath was abolished and in 1937 a new constitution was adopted [87] This completed a process of gradual separation from the British Empire that governments had pursued since independence However, it was not until 1949 that the state was declared, officially, to be the Republic of Ireland.\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\nNorthern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom with a local executive and assembly which exercise devolved powers The executive is jointly headed by the first and deputy first minister, with the ministries being allocated in proportion to each party's representation in the assembly Its capital is Belfast.\n\n\nPolitics\nThe island is divided between the Republic of Ireland, an independent state, and Northern Ireland, a constituent country of the United Kingdom They share an open border and both are part of the Common Travel Area and as a consequence, there is free movement of people, goods, services and capital across the border.\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\nThe Republic of Ireland is a parliamentary democracy based on the Westminster system, with a written constitution and a popularly elected president whose role is mostly ceremonial The Oireachtas is a bicameral parliament, composed of Dáil Éireann (the Dáil), a house of representatives, and Seanad Éireann (the Seanad), an upper house The government is headed by a prime minister, the Taoiseach, who is appointed by the president on the nomination of the Dáil Its capital is Dublin.\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\nNorthern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom with a local executive and assembly which exercise devolved powers The executive is jointly headed by the first and deputy first minister, with the ministries being allocated in proportion to each party's representation in the assembly Its capital is Belfast.\n\n\nAll-island institutions\nAs part of the Good Friday Agreement, the British and Irish governments agreed on the creation of all-island institutions and areas of cooperation The North/South Ministerial Council is an institution through which ministers from the Government of Ireland and the Northern Ireland Executive agree all-island policies At least six of these policy areas must have an associated all-island \"implementation body\", and at least six others must be implemented separately in each jurisdiction The implementation bodies are: Waterways Ireland, the Food Safety Promotion Board, InterTradeIreland, the Special European Union Programmes Body, the North/South Language Body and the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission.\n\n\nGeography\nIreland is located in the north-west of Europe, between latitudes 51° and 56° N, and longitudes 11° and 5° W It is separated from Great Britain by the Irish Sea and the North Channel, which has a width of 23 kilometres (14 mi) [111] at its narrowest point To the west is the northern Atlantic Ocean and to the south is the Celtic Sea, which lies between Ireland and Brittany, in France Ireland has a total area of 84,421 km2 (32,595 sq mi), [1] [2] [112] of which the Republic of Ireland occupies 83 percent [113] Ireland and Great Britain, together with many nearby smaller islands, are known collectively as the British Isles [114] As the term British Isles can be controversial in relation to Ireland, the alternate term Britain and Ireland is sometimes used as a neutral term for the islands [115]\n\n\nGeology\nThe island consists of varied geological provinces In the west, around County Galway and County Donegal, is a medium- to high-grade metamorphic and igneous complex of Caledonide affinity, similar to the Scottish Highlands Across southeast Ulster and extending southwest to Longford and south to Navan is a province of Ordovician and Silurian rocks, with similarities to the Southern Uplands province of Scotland Further south, along the County Wexford coastline, is an area of granite intrusives into more Ordovician and Silurian rocks, like that found in Wales [119] [120]\n\n\nClimate\nThe island's lush vegetation, a product of its mild climate and frequent rainfall, earns it the sobriquet the Emerald Isle Overall, Ireland has a mild but changeable oceanic climate with few extremes The climate is typically insular and temperate, avoiding the extremes in temperature of many other areas in the world at similar latitudes [126] This is a result of the moist winds which ordinarily prevail from the southwestern Atlantic.\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nUnlike Great Britain which had a land bridge with mainland Europe, Ireland only had an ice bridge ending around 14,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age and as a result, it has fewer land animal and plant species than Great Britain or mainland Europe [19] [20] There are 55 mammal species in Ireland, and of them, only 26 land mammal species are considered native to Ireland [131] Some species, such as, the red fox, hedgehog and badger, are very common, whereas others, like the Irish hare, red deer and pine marten are less so Aquatic wildlife, such as species of sea turtle, shark, seal, whale, and dolphin, are common off the coast About 400 species of birds have been recorded in Ireland Many of these are migratory, including the barn swallow.\n\n\nImpact of agriculture\nThe long history of agricultural production, coupled with modern intensive agricultural methods such as pesticide and fertiliser use and runoff from contaminants into streams, rivers and lakes, has placed pressure on biodiversity in Ireland [140] [141] A land of green fields for crop cultivation and cattle rearing limits the space available for the establishment of native wild species Hedgerows, however, traditionally used for maintaining and demarcating land boundaries, act as a refuge for native wild flora This ecosystem stretches across the countryside and acts as a network of connections to preserve remnants of the ecosystem that once covered the island Subsidies under the Common Agricultural Policy, which supported agricultural practices that preserved hedgerow environments, are undergoing reforms The Common Agricultural Policy had in the past subsidised potentially destructive agricultural practices, for example by emphasising production without placing limits on indiscriminate use of fertilisers and pesticides; but reforms have gradually decoupled subsidies from production levels and introduced environmental and other requirements [142] 32% of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions are correlated to agriculture [143] Forested areas typically consist of monoculture plantations of non-native species, which may result in habitats that are not suitable for supporting native species of invertebrates Natural areas require fencing to prevent over-grazing by deer and sheep that roam over uncultivated areas Grazing in this manner is one of the main factors preventing the natural regeneration of forests across many regions of the country [144]\n\n\nDemographics\nThe population of Ireland is just over 7 million, of which approximately 5.1 million reside in the Republic of Ireland and 1.9 million reside in Northern Ireland [11]\n\n\nDivisions and settlements\nTraditionally, Ireland is subdivided into four provinces: Connacht (west), Leinster (east), Munster (south), and Ulster (north) In a system that developed between the 13th and 17th centuries, [147] Ireland has 32 traditional counties Twenty-six of these counties are in the Republic of Ireland, and six are in Northern Ireland The six counties that constitute Northern Ireland are all in the province of Ulster (which has nine counties in total) As such, Ulster is often used as a synonym for Northern Ireland, although the two are not coterminous In the Republic of Ireland, counties form the basis of the system of local government Counties Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and Tipperary have been broken up into smaller administrative areas However, they are still treated as counties for cultural and some official purposes, for example, postal addresses and by the Ordnance Survey Ireland Counties in Northern Ireland are no longer used for local governmental purposes, [148] but, as in the Republic, their traditional boundaries are still used for informal purposes such as sports leagues and in cultural or tourism contexts [149]\n\n\nMigration\nThe population of Ireland collapsed dramatically during the second half of the 19th century A population of over eight million in 1841 was reduced to slightly over four million by 1921 In part, the fall in population was caused by death from the Great Famine of 1845 to 1852, which took roughly one million lives The remaining decline of around three million was due to the entrenched culture of emigration caused by the dire economic state of the country, lasting until the late 20th century.\n\n\nLanguages\nThe two official languages of the Republic of Ireland are Irish and English Each language has produced noteworthy literature Irish, though now only the language of a minority, was the vernacular of the Irish people for thousands of years and was possibly introduced during the Iron Age It began to be written down after Christianisation in the 5th century and spread to Scotland and the Isle of Man, where it evolved into the Scottish Gaelic and Manx languages, respectively.\n\n\nCulture\nIreland's culture comprises elements of the culture of ancient peoples, later immigrant and broadcast cultural influences (chiefly Gaelic culture, Anglicisation, Americanisation and aspects of broader European culture) In broad terms, Ireland is regarded as one of the Celtic nations of Europe, alongside Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, Isle of Man and Brittany This combination of cultural influences is visible in the intricate designs termed Irish interlace or Celtic knotwork These can be seen in the ornamentation of medieval religious and secular works The style is still popular today in jewellery and graphic art, [172] as is the distinctive style of traditional Irish music and dance, and has become indicative of modern \"Celtic\" culture in general.\n\n\nArts\nIreland has made a substantial contribution to world literature in all its branches, both in Irish and English Poetry in Irish is among the oldest vernacular poetry in Europe, with the earliest examples dating from the 6th century [citation needed]\nIrish remained the dominant literary language down to the nineteenth century, despite the spread of English from the seventeenth century on Prominent names from the medieval period and later include Gofraidh Fionn Ó Dálaigh (fourteenth century), Dáibhí Ó Bruadair (seventeenth century) and Aogán Ó Rathaille (eighteenth century) Eibhlín Dubh Ní Chonaill (c. 1743 – c. 1800) was an outstanding poet in the oral tradition The latter part of the nineteenth century saw a rapid replacement of Irish by English  [citation needed] By 1900, however, cultural nationalists had begun the Gaelic revival, which saw the beginnings of modern literature in Irish This was to produce a number of notable writers, including Máirtín Ó Cadhain, Máire Mhac an tSaoi and others Irish-language publishers such as Coiscéim and Cló Iar-Chonnacht continue to produce scores of titles every year.\n\n\nLiterature\nIreland has made a substantial

publishers such as Coiscéim and Cló Iar-Chonnacht continue to produce scores of titles every year.\n\n\nMusic and dance\nMusic has been in evidence in Ireland since prehistoric times [175] Although in the early Middle Ages the church was \"quite unlike its counterpart in continental Europe\", [176] there was a considerable interchange between monastic settlements in Ireland and the rest of Europe that contributed to what is known as Gregorian chant Outside religious establishments, musical genres in early Gaelic Ireland are referred to as a triad of weeping music (goltraige), laughing music (geantraige) and sleeping music (suantraige) [177] Vocal and instrumental music (e.g for the harp, pipes, and various string instruments) was transmitted orally, but the Irish harp, in particular, was of such significance that it became Ireland's national symbol Classical music following European models first developed in urban areas, in establishments of Anglo-Irish rule such as Dublin Castle, St Patrick's Cathedral and Christ Church as well as the country houses of the Anglo-Irish ascendancy, with the first performance of Handel's Messiah (1742) being among the highlights of the baroque era In the 19th century, public concerts provided access to classical music to all classes of society Yet, for political and financial reasons Ireland has been too small to provide a living to many musicians, so the names of the better-known Irish composers of this time belong to emigrants.\n\n\nArt\nThe earliest known Irish graphic art and sculpture are Neolithic carvings found at sites such as Newgrange [179] and is traced through Bronze Age artefacts and the religious carvings and illuminated manuscripts of the medieval period During the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, a strong tradition of painting emerged, including such figures as John Butler Yeats, William Orpen, Jack Yeats and Louis le Brocquy Contemporary Irish visual artists of note include Sean Scully, Kevin Abosch, and Alice Maher.\n\n\nDrama and theatre\nThe Republic of Ireland's national theatre is the Abbey Theatre, which was founded in 1904, and the national Irish-language theatre is An Taibhdhearc, which was established in 1928 in Galway [180] [181] Playwrights such as Seán O'Casey, Brian Friel, Sebastian Barry, Conor McPherson and Billy Roche are internationally renowned [182]\n\n\nScience\nThe Irish philosopher and theologian Johannes Scotus Eriugena was considered one of the leading intellectuals of the early Middle Ages Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton, an Irish explorer, was one of the principal figures of Antarctic exploration He, along with his expedition, made the first ascent of Mount Erebus and the discovery of the approximate location of the South Magnetic Pole Robert Boyle was a 17th-century natural philosopher, chemist, physicist, inventor and early gentleman scientist He is largely regarded as one of the founders of modern chemistry and is best known for the formulation of Boyle's law [183]\n\n\nSports\nGaelic football is the most popular sport in Ireland in terms of match attendance and community involvement, with about 2,600 clubs on the island In 2003 it represented 34% of total sports attendances at events in Ireland and abroad, followed by hurling at 23%, soccer at 16% and rugby at 8% [189] The All-Ireland Football Final is the most watched event in the sporting calendar [190] Soccer is the most widely played team game on the island and the most popular in Northern Ireland [189] [191]\n\n\nField sports\nGaelic football, hurling and Gaelic handball are the best-known Irish traditional sports, collectively known as Gaelic games Gaelic games are governed by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), with the exception of women's Gaelic football and camogie (women's variant of hurling), which are governed by separate organisations The headquarters of the GAA (and the main stadium) is located at [193] Croke Park in north Dublin and has a capacity of 82,500 Many major GAA games are played there, including the semi-finals and finals of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship and All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship During the redevelopment of the Lansdowne Road stadium in 2007–2010, international rugby and soccer were played there [194] All GAA players, even at the highest level, are amateurs, receiving no wages, although they are permitted to receive a limited amount of sport-related income from commercial sponsorship.\n\n\nBoxing\nAmateur boxing on the island of Ireland is governed by the Irish Athletic Boxing Association Ireland has won more medals in boxing than in any other Olympic sport Michael Carruth won a gold medal and Wayne McCullough won a silver medal in the Barcelona Olympic Games In 2008 Kenneth Egan won a silver medal in the Beijing Games [200] Paddy Barnes secured bronze in those games and gold in the 2010 European Amateur Boxing Championships (where Ireland came 2nd in the overall medal table) and 2010 Commonwealth Games Katie Taylor has won gold in every European and World championship since 2005 In August 2012 at the Olympic Games in London, Taylor created history by becoming the first Irish woman to win a gold medal in boxing in the 60 kg lightweight [201] More recently, Kellie Harrington won a gold medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics [202]\n\n\nOther sports\nHorse racing and greyhound racing are both popular in Ireland There are frequent horse race meetings and greyhound stadiums are well-attended The island is noted for the breeding and training of race horses and is also a large exporter of racing dogs [203] The horse racing sector is largely concentrated in the County Kildare [204]\n\n\nRecreation\nThe west coast of Ireland, Lahinch and Donegal Bay in particular, have popular surfing beaches, being fully exposed to the Atlantic Ocean Donegal Bay is shaped like a funnel and catches west/south-west Atlantic winds, creating good surf, especially in winter Since just before the year 2010, Bundoran has hosted European championship surfing Scuba diving is increasingly popular in Ireland with clear waters and large populations of sea life, particularly along the western seaboard There are also many shipwrecks along the coast of Ireland, with some of the best wreck dives being in Malin Head and off the County Cork coast [211]\n\n\nFood and drink\nFood and cuisine in Ireland take their influence from the crops grown and animals farmed in the island's temperate climate and from the social and political circumstances of Irish history For example, whilst from the Middle Ages until the arrival of the potato in the 16th century the dominant feature of the Irish economy was the herding of cattle, the number of cattle a person owned was equated to their social standing [214] Thus herders would avoid slaughtering a milk-producing cow [214]\n\n\nEconomy\nThe GDP of the Republic of Ireland as of 2021 [update] was €423.5 billion (nominal), [226] and in Northern Ireland in 2021, it was £52 billion (GVA Balanced) [227] The GDP per capita in the Republic of Ireland was €84,049.9 (nominal) as of 2021 [update], [226] and in Northern Ireland 2021 was £27,154 (GVA Balanced) [227] The Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom measure these numbers differently.\n\n\nRegional economics\nBelow is a comparison of the regional GDP on the island of Ireland.\n\n\nNorthern Ireland trade comparison\nBelow is a comparison of the goods being sold and purchased between Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom, compared with the goods being exported and imported between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland:\n\n\nCost of living comparison\nBelow is a comparison of the monthly cost of living and average wage after tax in Northern Ireland versus those in the Republic of Ireland in 2023:\n\n\nEconomic history\nPrior to partition in 1921, Ireland had a long history as an economic colony – first, partially, of the Norse, via their cities (9th to 10th centuries CE), and later, to varying extents, of polities related to England Though the climate and soil favoured certain forms of agriculture, [234] trade barriers frequently hobbled its development Repeated invasions and plantations disrupted land-ownership, and multiple failed uprisings also contributed to repeated phases of deportation and of emigration.\n\n\nMajor industries\nThere are two World Heritage Sites on the island: the Brú na Bóinne complex and the Giant's Causeway [236] Several other places are on the tentative list, for example the Burren, the Ceide Fields [237] and Mount Stewart [238]\n\n\nTourism\nThere are two World Heritage Sites on the island: the Brú na Bóinne complex and the Giant's Causeway [236] Several other places are on the tentative list, for example the Burren, the Ceide Fields [237] and Mount Stewart [238]\n\n\nEnergy\nAlthough for most of their existence electricity networks in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland were entirely separate, the island has operated for some time as a single market for electricity [244] Both networks were designed and constructed independently post-partition but they are now connected with three interlinks [245] and are also connected through Great Britain to mainland Europe The situation in Northern Ireland is complicated by the issue of private companies not supplying Northern Ireland Electricity with enough power In the Republic of Ireland, the ESB has failed to modernise its power stations, and the availability of power plants has recently averaged only 66%, one of the worst such rates in Western Europe EirGrid has started building a HVDC transmission line between Ireland and Great Britain with a capacity of 500 MW, [246] about 10% of Ireland's peak demand.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Ireland\n\nIntroduction\n\nIreland is an island nation located in the north-west of Europe, between latitudes 51° and 56° N, and longitudes 11° and 5° W. The island has a total area of 84,421 km² (32,595 sq mi), with the Republic of Ireland occupying 83% of the land. Ireland is separated from Great Britain by the Irish Sea and the North Channel, which has a width of 23 kilometres (14 mi) at its narrowest point.\n\n# History\n\nThe history of Ireland is complex and spans thousands of years. The earliest known human presence in Ireland dates back to the Mesolithic era, around 8000 BC. During this period, the island was periodically covered in ice, and the relative sea level was lower, resulting in an ice bridge between Ireland and Great Britain. The climate in Ireland during this period was much colder than it is today, with glaciers covering much of the island.\n\n## Prehistoric Ireland\n\nThe prehistoric period in Ireland saw the arrival of farmers around 4000 BC, who brought with them new technologies and practices that transformed the island's landscape. The Neolithic era saw the construction of large tombs, such as Newgrange, which is one of the oldest known passage tombs in the world.\n\n## Emergence of Celtic Ireland\n\nThe emergence of Celtic Ireland is a topic of ongoing debate among historians and archaeologists. The most recent genetic research suggests that the spread of Indo-European languages, including Celtic, through Western Europe was associated with a people bringing a composite Beaker culture. This culture arrived in Britain and Ireland around the middle of the third millennium BC.\n\n## Late Antiquity and Early Medieval Times\n\nThe earliest written records of Ireland come from classical Greco-Roman geographers, such as Ptolemy, who referred to Ireland as Mikra Brettania (\"Little Britain\") in his Almagest. In his later work, Geography, Ptolemy referred to Ireland as Iouernia and to Great Britain as Albion.\n\n## Norman and English Invasions\n\nThe Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169 marked the beginning of a long period of English rule on the island. The invasion, led by Richard de Clare, known as \"Strongbow,\" was at the invitation of Dermot Mac Murrough, King of Leinster.\n\n## Gaelicisation\n\nFrom the mid-14th century, the Norman settlements in Ireland went into a period of decline. The Norman rulers and the Gaelic Irish elites intermarried, and the areas under Norman rule became Gaelicised. A hybrid Hiberno-Norman culture emerged, and in response, the Irish parliament passed the Statutes of Kilkenny in 1367.\n\n## The Kingdom of Ireland\n\nThe title of King of Ireland was re-created in 1542 by Henry VIII, the then King of England, of the Tudor dynasty. English rule was reinforced and expanded in Ireland during the latter part of the 16th century, leading to the Tudor conquest of Ireland.\n\n## 1798 Rebellion\n\nThe 1798 Rebellion was a republican uprising inspired and led by the Society of United Irishmen, with the aim of creating an independent Ireland. The rebellion was put down by British and Irish government and yeomanry forces.\n\n## Union with Great Britain\n\nThe British and Irish parliaments both passed Acts of Union in 1800, which merged the Kingdom of Ireland and the Kingdom of Great Britain to create a United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\n\n## Partition\n\nThe Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921 gave Ireland complete independence in its home affairs and practical independence for foreign policy, but an opt-out clause allowed Northern Ireland to remain within the United Kingdom.\n\n# Geography\n\nIreland is located in the north-west of Europe, between latitudes 51° and 56° N, and longitudes 11° and 5° W. The island has a total area of 84,421 km² (32,595 sq mi). The Republic of Ireland occupies 83% of the land, with the remaining 17% being part of Northern Ireland.\n\n## Climate\n\nIreland has a mild but changeable oceanic climate, with few extremes. The climate is typically insular and temperate, avoiding the extremes in temperature of many other areas in the world at similar latitudes.\n\n## Flora and Fauna\n\nIreland's flora and fauna are distinct from those found in Great Britain, due to the island's isolation for thousands of years. The island has a relatively low number of land animal and plant species, due to its ice-free period ending around 14,000 years ago.\n\n## Geology\n\nThe island of Ireland consists of varied geological provinces. The west coast, around County Galway and County Donegal, has a medium- to high-grade metamorphic and igneous complex of Caledonide affinity, similar to the Scottish Highlands.\n\n# Culture\n\nIreland's culture is a unique blend of ancient and modern influences. The island has a rich literary heritage, with a long tradition of poetry and storytelling.\n\n## Language\n\nThe two official languages of the Republic of Ireland are Irish and English. Irish, also known as Irish Gaelic or Gaeilge, is a Celtic language that was the vernacular of the Irish people for thousands of years.\n\n## Music and Dance\n\nMusic has been an integral part of Irish culture for centuries. Traditional Irish music and dance, such as the fiddle and the bodhran, are still popular today.\n\n## Arts\n\nIreland has a rich artistic heritage, with a strong tradition of painting, sculpture, and literature.\n\n## Drama and Theatre\n\nThe Republic of Ireland's national theatre is the Abbey Theatre, which was founded in 1904.

The Republic of Ireland is a member of the European Union and has a highly developed economy, with a GDP per capita of €84,049.9.\n\n## Regional Economics\n\nThe economy of Northern Ireland is also developed, with a GDP per capita of £27,154.\n\n## Major Industries\n\nTourism is a significant industry in Ireland, with millions of visitors each year. The island is also known for its agriculture, with a strong focus on dairy farming and beef production.\n\n## Energy\n\nIreland has a number of energy sources, including wind, hydroelectric, and fossil fuels. The island is also connected to the British grid through a number of interconnectors.\n\n# Recreation\n\nIreland has a rich recreational heritage, with a strong focus on outdoor activities such as hiking, surfing, and horse riding.\n\n## Tourism\n\nTourism is a significant industry in Ireland, with millions of visitors each year.

migrations of the Celts being one of the more enduring themes of archaeological and linguistic studies The most recent genetic research strongly associates the spread of Indo-European languages (including Celtic) through Western Europe with a people bringing a composite Beaker culture, with its arrival in Britain and Ireland dated to around the middle of the third millennium BC [28] According to John T Koch and others, Ireland in the Late Bronze Age was part of a maritime trading-network culture called the Atlantic Bronze Age that also included Britain, western France and Iberia, and that this is where Celtic languages developed [29] [30] [31] [32] This contrasts with the traditional view that their origin lies in mainland Europe with the Hallstatt culture [33]\n\n\nLate antiquity and early medieval times\nThe earliest written records of Ireland come from classical Greco-Roman geographers Ptolemy in his Almagest refers to Ireland as Mikra Brettania (\"Little Britain\"), in contrast to the larger island, which he called Megale Brettania (\"Great Britain\") [41] In his map of Ireland in his later work, Geography, Ptolemy refers to Ireland as Iouernia and to Great Britain as Albion These 'new' names were likely to have been the local names for the islands at the time The earlier names, in contrast, were likely to have been coined before direct contact with local peoples was made [42]\n\n\nNorman and English invasions\nOn 1 May 1169, an expedition of Cambro-Norman knights, with an army of about 600 men, landed at Bannow Strand in present-day County Wexford It was led by Richard de Clare, known as 'Strongbow' owing to his prowess as an archer [58] The invasion, which coincided with a period of renewed Norman expansion, was at the invitation of Dermot Mac Murrough, King of Leinster [59]\n\n\nGaelicisation\nFrom the mid-14th century, after the Black Death, Norman settlements in Ireland went into a period of decline The Norman rulers and the Gaelic Irish elites intermarried and the areas under Norman rule became Gaelicised In some parts, a hybrid Hiberno-Norman culture emerged In response, the Irish parliament passed the Statutes of Kilkenny in 1367 These were a set of laws designed to prevent the assimilation of the Normans into Irish society by requiring English subjects in Ireland to speak English, follow English customs and abide by English law [65]\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Ireland\nThe title of King of Ireland was re-created in 1542 by Henry VIII, the then King of England, of the Tudor dynasty English rule was reinforced and expanded in Ireland during the latter part of the 16th century, leading to the Tudor conquest of Ireland A near-complete conquest was achieved by the turn of the 17th century, following the Nine Years' War and the Flight of the Earls.\n\n\n1798 Rebellion\nIn 1798, members of the Protestant Dissenter tradition (mainly Presbyterian) made common cause with Roman Catholics in a republican rebellion inspired and led by the Society of United Irishmen, with the aim of creating an independent Ireland Despite assistance from France the rebellion was put down by British and Irish government and yeomanry forces The rebellion lasted from the 24th of May to the 12th of October that year and saw the establishment of the short lived Irish Republic (1798) in the province on Connacht It saw numerous battles across the island with an estimated 30,000 dead with some listed below (for full list see main article.)\n\n\nUnion with Great Britain\nAs a direct result of the 1798 rebellion in its aftermath in 1800, the British and Irish parliaments both passed Acts of Union that, with effect from 1 January 1801, merged the Kingdom of Ireland and the Kingdom of Great Britain to create a United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland [75]\n\n\nPartition\nIn December 1921, the Anglo-Irish Treaty was concluded between the British government and representatives of the Second Dáil It gave Ireland complete independence in its home affairs and practical independence for foreign policy, but an opt-out clause allowed Northern Ireland to remain within the United Kingdom, which it immediately exercised Additionally, Members of the Free State Parliament were required to swear an oath of allegiance to the Constitution of the Irish Free State and make a statement of faithfulness to the king [88] Disagreements over these provisions led to a split in the nationalist movement and a subsequent Irish Civil War between the new government of the Irish Free State and those opposed to the treaty, led by Éamon de Valera The civil war officially ended in May 1923 when de Valera issued a cease-fire order [89]\n\n\nIndependence\nDuring its first decade, the newly formed Irish Free State was governed by the victors of the civil war When de Valera achieved power, he took advantage of the Statute of Westminster and political circumstances to build upon inroads to greater sovereignty made by the previous government The oath was abolished and in 1937 a new constitution was adopted [87] This completed a process of gradual separation from the British Empire that governments had pursued since independence However, it was not until 1949 that the state was declared, officially, to be the Republic of Ireland.\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\nNorthern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom with a local executive and assembly which exercise devolved powers The executive is jointly headed by the first and deputy first minister, with the ministries being allocated in proportion to each party's representation in the assembly Its capital is Belfast.\n\n\nPolitics\nThe island is divided between the Republic of Ireland, an independent state, and Northern Ireland, a constituent country of the United Kingdom They share an open border and both are part of the Common Travel Area and as a consequence, there is free movement of people, goods, services and capital across the border.\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\nThe Republic of Ireland is a parliamentary democracy based on the Westminster system, with a written constitution and a popularly elected president whose role is mostly ceremonial The Oireachtas is a bicameral parliament, composed of Dáil Éireann (the Dáil), a house of representatives, and Seanad Éireann (the Seanad), an upper house The government is headed by a prime minister, the Taoiseach, who is appointed by the president on the nomination of the Dáil Its capital is Dublin.\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\nNorthern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom with a local executive and assembly which exercise devolved powers The executive is jointly headed by the first and deputy first minister, with the ministries being allocated in proportion to each party's representation in the assembly Its capital is Belfast.\n\n\nAll-island institutions\nAs part of the Good Friday Agreement, the British and Irish governments agreed on the creation of all-island institutions and areas of cooperation The North/South Ministerial Council is an institution through which ministers from the Government of Ireland and the Northern Ireland Executive agree all-island policies At least six of these policy areas must have an associated all-island \"implementation body\", and at least six others must be implemented separately in each jurisdiction The implementation bodies are: Waterways Ireland, the Food Safety Promotion Board, InterTradeIreland, the Special European Union Programmes Body, the North/South Language Body and the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission.\n\n\nGeography\nIreland is located in the north-west of Europe, between latitudes 51° and 56° N, and longitudes 11° and 5° W It is separated from Great Britain by the Irish Sea and the North Channel, which has a width of 23 kilometres (14 mi) [111] at its narrowest point To the west is the northern Atlantic Ocean and to the south is the Celtic Sea, which lies between Ireland and Brittany, in France Ireland has a total area of 84,421 km2 (32,595 sq mi), [1] [2] [112] of which the Republic of Ireland occupies 83 percent [113] Ireland and Great Britain, together with many nearby smaller islands, are known collectively as the British Isles [114] As the term British Isles can be controversial in relation to Ireland, the alternate term Britain and Ireland is sometimes used as a neutral term for the islands [115]\n\n\nGeology\nThe island consists of varied geological provinces In the west, around County Galway and County Donegal, is a medium- to high-grade metamorphic and igneous complex of Caledonide affinity, similar to the Scottish Highlands Across southeast Ulster and extending southwest to Longford and south to Navan is a province of Ordovician and Silurian rocks, with similarities to the Southern Uplands province of Scotland Further south, along the County Wexford coastline, is an area of granite intrusives into more Ordovician and Silurian rocks, like that found in Wales [119] [120]\n\n\nClimate\nThe island's lush vegetation, a product of its mild climate and frequent rainfall, earns it the sobriquet the Emerald Isle Overall, Ireland has a mild but changeable oceanic climate with few extremes The climate is typically insular and temperate, avoiding the extremes in temperature of many other areas in the world at similar latitudes [126] This is a result of the moist winds which ordinarily prevail from the southwestern Atlantic.\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nUnlike Great Britain which had a land bridge with mainland Europe, Ireland only had an ice bridge ending around 14,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age and as a result, it has fewer land animal and plant species than Great Britain or mainland Europe [19] [20] There are 55 mammal species in Ireland, and of them, only 26 land mammal species are considered native to Ireland [131] Some species, such as, the red fox, hedgehog and badger, are very common, whereas others, like the Irish hare, red deer and pine marten are less so Aquatic wildlife, such as species of sea turtle, shark, seal, whale, and dolphin, are common off the coast About 400 species of birds have been recorded in Ireland Many of these are migratory, including the barn swallow.\n\n\nImpact of agriculture\nThe long history of agricultural production, coupled with modern intensive agricultural methods such as pesticide and fertiliser use and runoff from contaminants into streams, rivers and lakes, has placed pressure on biodiversity in Ireland [140] [141] A land of green fields for crop cultivation and cattle rearing limits the space available for the establishment of native wild species Hedgerows, however, traditionally used for maintaining and demarcating land boundaries, act as a refuge for native wild flora This ecosystem stretches across the countryside and acts as a network of connections to preserve remnants of the ecosystem that once covered the island Subsidies under the Common Agricultural Policy, which supported agricultural practices that preserved hedgerow environments, are undergoing reforms The Common Agricultural Policy had in the past subsidised potentially destructive agricultural practices, for example by emphasising production without placing limits on indiscriminate use of fertilisers and pesticides; but reforms have gradually decoupled subsidies from production levels and introduced environmental and other requirements [142] 32% of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions are correlated to agriculture [143] Forested areas typically consist of monoculture plantations of non-native species, which may result in habitats that are not suitable for supporting native species of invertebrates Natural areas require fencing to prevent over-grazing by deer and sheep that roam over uncultivated areas Grazing in this manner is one of the main factors preventing the natural regeneration of forests across many regions of the country [144]\n\n\nDemographics\nThe population of Ireland is just over 7 million, of which approximately 5.1 million reside in the Republic of Ireland and 1.9 million reside in Northern Ireland [11]\n\n\nDivisions and settlements\nTraditionally, Ireland is subdivided into four provinces: Connacht (west), Leinster (east), Munster (south), and Ulster (north) In a system that developed between the 13th and 17th centuries, [147] Ireland has 32 traditional counties Twenty-six of these counties are in the Republic of Ireland, and six are in Northern Ireland The six counties that constitute Northern Ireland are all in the province of Ulster (which has nine counties in total) As such, Ulster is often used as a synonym for Northern Ireland, although the two are not coterminous In the Republic of Ireland, counties form the basis of the system of local government Counties Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and Tipperary have been broken up into smaller administrative areas However, they are still treated as counties for cultural and some official purposes, for example, postal addresses and by the Ordnance Survey Ireland Counties in Northern Ireland are no longer used for local governmental purposes, [148] but, as in the Republic, their traditional boundaries are still used for informal purposes such as sports leagues and in cultural or tourism contexts [149]\n\n\nMigration\nThe population of Ireland collapsed dramatically during the second half of the 19th century A population of over eight million in 1841 was reduced to slightly over four million by 1921 In part, the fall in population was caused by death from the Great Famine of 1845 to 1852, which took roughly one million lives The remaining decline of around three million was due to the entrenched culture of emigration caused by the dire economic state of the country, lasting until the late 20th century.\n\n\nLanguages\nThe two official languages of the Republic of Ireland are Irish and English Each language has produced noteworthy literature Irish, though now only the language of a minority, was the vernacular of the Irish people for thousands of years and was possibly introduced during the Iron Age It began to be written down after Christianisation in the 5th century and spread to Scotland and the Isle of Man, where it evolved into the Scottish Gaelic and Manx languages, respectively.\n\n\nCulture\nIreland's culture comprises elements of the culture of ancient peoples, later immigrant and broadcast cultural influences (chiefly Gaelic culture, Anglicisation, Americanisation and aspects of broader European culture) In broad terms, Ireland is regarded as one of the Celtic nations of Europe, alongside Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, Isle of Man and Brittany This combination of cultural influences is visible in the intricate designs termed Irish interlace or Celtic knotwork These can be seen in the ornamentation of medieval religious and secular works The style is still popular today in jewellery and graphic art, [172] as is the distinctive style of traditional Irish music and dance, and has become indicative of modern \"Celtic\" culture in general.\n\n\nArts\nIreland has made a substantial contribution to world literature in all its branches, both in Irish and English Poetry in Irish is among the oldest vernacular poetry in Europe, with the earliest examples dating from the 6th century [citation needed]\nIrish remained the dominant literary language down to the nineteenth century, despite the spread of English from the seventeenth century on Prominent names from the medieval period and later include Gofraidh Fionn Ó Dálaigh (fourteenth century), Dáibhí Ó Bruadair (seventeenth century) and Aogán Ó Rathaille (eighteenth century) Eibhlín Dubh Ní Chonaill (c. 1743 – c. 1800) was an outstanding poet in the oral tradition The latter part of the nineteenth century saw a rapid replacement of Irish by English  [citation needed] By 1900, however, cultural nationalists had begun the Gaelic revival, which saw the beginnings of modern literature in Irish This was to produce a number of notable writers, including Máirtín Ó Cadhain, Máire Mhac an tSaoi and others Irish-language publishers such as Coiscéim and Cló Iar-Chonnacht continue to produce scores of titles every year.\n\n\nLiterature\nIreland has made a substantial

publishers such as Coiscéim and Cló Iar-Chonnacht continue to produce scores of titles every year.\n\n\nMusic and dance\nMusic has been in evidence in Ireland since prehistoric times [175] Although in the early Middle Ages the church was \"quite unlike its counterpart in continental Europe\", [176] there was a considerable interchange between monastic settlements in Ireland and the rest of Europe that contributed to what is known as Gregorian chant Outside religious establishments, musical genres in early Gaelic Ireland are referred to as a triad of weeping music (goltraige), laughing music (geantraige) and sleeping music (suantraige) [177] Vocal and instrumental music (e.g for the harp, pipes, and various string instruments) was transmitted orally, but the Irish harp, in particular, was of such significance that it became Ireland's national symbol Classical music following European models first developed in urban areas, in establishments of Anglo-Irish rule such as Dublin Castle, St Patrick's Cathedral and Christ Church as well as the country houses of the Anglo-Irish ascendancy, with the first performance of Handel's Messiah (1742) being among the highlights of the baroque era In the 19th century, public concerts provided access to classical music to all classes of society Yet, for political and financial reasons Ireland has been too small to provide a living to many musicians, so the names of the better-known Irish composers of this time belong to emigrants.\n\n\nArt\nThe earliest known Irish graphic art and sculpture are Neolithic carvings found at sites such as Newgrange [179] and is traced through Bronze Age artefacts and the religious carvings and illuminated manuscripts of the medieval period During the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, a strong tradition of painting emerged, including such figures as John Butler Yeats, William Orpen, Jack Yeats and Louis le Brocquy Contemporary Irish visual artists of note include Sean Scully, Kevin Abosch, and Alice Maher.\n\n\nDrama and theatre\nThe Republic of Ireland's national theatre is the Abbey Theatre, which was founded in 1904, and the national Irish-language theatre is An Taibhdhearc, which was established in 1928 in Galway [180] [181] Playwrights such as Seán O'Casey, Brian Friel, Sebastian Barry, Conor McPherson and Billy Roche are internationally renowned [182]\n\n\nScience\nThe Irish philosopher and theologian Johannes Scotus Eriugena was considered one of the leading intellectuals of the early Middle Ages Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton, an Irish explorer, was one of the principal figures of Antarctic exploration He, along with his expedition, made the first ascent of Mount Erebus and the discovery of the approximate location of the South Magnetic Pole Robert Boyle was a 17th-century natural philosopher, chemist, physicist, inventor and early gentleman scientist He is largely regarded as one of the founders of modern chemistry and is best known for the formulation of Boyle's law [183]\n\n\nSports\nGaelic football is the most popular sport in Ireland in terms of match attendance and community involvement, with about 2,600 clubs on the island In 2003 it represented 34% of total sports attendances at events in Ireland and abroad, followed by hurling at 23%, soccer at 16% and rugby at 8% [189] The All-Ireland Football Final is the most watched event in the sporting calendar [190] Soccer is the most widely played team game on the island and the most popular in Northern Ireland [189] [191]\n\n\nField sports\nGaelic football, hurling and Gaelic handball are the best-known Irish traditional sports, collectively known as Gaelic games Gaelic games are governed by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), with the exception of women's Gaelic football and camogie (women's variant of hurling), which are governed by separate organisations The headquarters of the GAA (and the main stadium) is located at [193] Croke Park in north Dublin and has a capacity of 82,500 Many major GAA games are played there, including the semi-finals and finals of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship and All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship During the redevelopment of the Lansdowne Road stadium in 2007–2010, international rugby and soccer were played there [194] All GAA players, even at the highest level, are amateurs, receiving no wages, although they are permitted to receive a limited amount of sport-related income from commercial sponsorship.\n\n\nBoxing\nAmateur boxing on the island of Ireland is governed by the Irish Athletic Boxing Association Ireland has won more medals in boxing than in any other Olympic sport Michael Carruth won a gold medal and Wayne McCullough won a silver medal in the Barcelona Olympic Games In 2008 Kenneth Egan won a silver medal in the Beijing Games [200] Paddy Barnes secured bronze in those games and gold in the 2010 European Amateur Boxing Championships (where Ireland came 2nd in the overall medal table) and 2010 Commonwealth Games Katie Taylor has won gold in every European and World championship since 2005 In August 2012 at the Olympic Games in London, Taylor created history by becoming the first Irish woman to win a gold medal in boxing in the 60 kg lightweight [201] More recently, Kellie Harrington won a gold medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics [202]\n\n\nOther sports\nHorse racing and greyhound racing are both popular in Ireland There are frequent horse race meetings and greyhound stadiums are well-attended The island is noted for the breeding and training of race horses and is also a large exporter of racing dogs [203] The horse racing sector is largely concentrated in the County Kildare [204]\n\n\nRecreation\nThe west coast of Ireland, Lahinch and Donegal Bay in particular, have popular surfing beaches, being fully exposed to the Atlantic Ocean Donegal Bay is shaped like a funnel and catches west/south-west Atlantic winds, creating good surf, especially in winter Since just before the year 2010, Bundoran has hosted European championship surfing Scuba diving is increasingly popular in Ireland with clear waters and large populations of sea life, particularly along the western seaboard There are also many shipwrecks along the coast of Ireland, with some of the best wreck dives being in Malin Head and off the County Cork coast [211]\n\n\nFood and drink\nFood and cuisine in Ireland take their influence from the crops grown and animals farmed in the island's temperate climate and from the social and political circumstances of Irish history For example, whilst from the Middle Ages until the arrival of the potato in the 16th century the dominant feature of the Irish economy was the herding of cattle, the number of cattle a person owned was equated to their social standing [214] Thus herders would avoid slaughtering a milk-producing cow [214]\n\n\nEconomy\nThe GDP of the Republic of Ireland as of 2021 [update] was €423.5 billion (nominal), [226] and in Northern Ireland in 2021, it was £52 billion (GVA Balanced) [227] The GDP per capita in the Republic of Ireland was €84,049.9 (nominal) as of 2021 [update], [226] and in Northern Ireland 2021 was £27,154 (GVA Balanced) [227] The Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom measure these numbers differently.\n\n\nRegional economics\nBelow is a comparison of the regional GDP on the island of Ireland.\n\n\nNorthern Ireland trade comparison\nBelow is a comparison of the goods being sold and purchased between Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom, compared with the goods being exported and imported between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland:\n\n\nCost of living comparison\nBelow is a comparison of the monthly cost of living and average wage after tax in Northern Ireland versus those in the Republic of Ireland in 2023:\n\n\nEconomic history\nPrior to partition in 1921, Ireland had a long history as an economic colony – first, partially, of the Norse, via their cities (9th to 10th centuries CE), and later, to varying extents, of polities related to England Though the climate and soil favoured certain forms of agriculture, [234] trade barriers frequently hobbled its development Repeated invasions and plantations disrupted land-ownership, and multiple failed uprisings also contributed to repeated phases of deportation and of emigration.\n\n\nMajor industries\nThere are two World Heritage Sites on the island: the Brú na Bóinne complex and the Giant's Causeway [236] Several other places are on the tentative list, for example the Burren, the Ceide Fields [237] and Mount Stewart [238]\n\n\nTourism\nThere are two World Heritage Sites on the island: the Brú na Bóinne complex and the Giant's Causeway [236] Several other places are on the tentative list, for example the Burren, the Ceide Fields [237] and Mount Stewart [238]\n\n\nEnergy\nAlthough for most of their existence electricity networks in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland were entirely separate, the island has operated for some time as a single market for electricity [244] Both networks were designed and constructed independently post-partition but they are now connected with three interlinks [245] and are also connected through Great Britain to mainland Europe The situation in Northern Ireland is complicated by the issue of private companies not supplying Northern Ireland Electricity with enough power In the Republic of Ireland, the ESB has failed to modernise its power stations, and the availability of power plants has recently averaged only 66%, one of the worst such rates in Western Europe EirGrid has started building a HVDC transmission line between Ireland and Great Britain with a capacity of 500 MW, [246] about 10% of Ireland's peak demand.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center", "content": "\nBackground\nWhen they opened in 1973, the Twin Towers were the tallest buildings in the world At the time of the attacks, only the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and the Willis Tower (known then as the Sears Tower) in Chicago were taller [20] Built with a novel \"framed tube\" design that maximized interior space, the towers had a high strength-to-weight ratio requiring 40 percent less steel than more traditional steel-framed skyscrapers [21] In addition, atop WTC 1 stood a 362 ft (110 m) telecommunications antenna erected in 1978, bringing that tower's total height to 1,730 ft (530 m), though as a nonstructural addition, the antenna was not officially counted.\n\n\nStructural design\nThe towers were designed as framed tube structures, which provided tenants with open floor plans uninterrupted by columns or walls The buildings were square and 207 ft (63 m) on each side but had chamfered 6 ft 11 in (2.11 m) corners, making each building's exterior roughly 210 ft (64 m) wide [22] One World Trade Center (WTC 1), the \"North Tower\", was, at 1,368 ft (417 m), six feet taller than Two World Trade Center (WTC 2), the \"South Tower\", which was 1,362 ft (415 m) tall Numerous closely spaced perimeter columns provided much of the structural strength, along with gravity load shared with the steel box columns of the core [23] Above the tenth floor, there were 59 perimeter columns along each face of the building spaced 3 ft 4 in (1.02 m) on center [23] While the towers were square, the interior cores were rectangular and supported by 47 columns that ran the full height of each tower [22] All the elevators and stairwells were in the core, leaving a large column-free space between it and the perimeter that was bridged by prefabricated floor trusses [23] As the core was rectangular, this created a long and short span distance to the perimeter columns.\n\n\nEvaluations for aircraft impact\nThough fire studies and even an analysis of the impacts of low-speed jet aircraft impacts had been undertaken before the towers' completion, the full scope of those studies no longer exists Nevertheless, since fire had never before caused a skyscraper to collapse and aircraft impacts had been considered in their design, their destruction initially came as a surprise to some in the engineering community [24]\n\n\nFireproofing\nUntil the mid-1970s, the use of asbestos for fireproofing was widespread in the construction industry But in April 1970, the New York City Department of Air Resources ordered contractors building the World Trade Center to stop the spraying of asbestos as an insulating material [33] and vermiculite plaster was used instead [34]\n\n\nThe two crashes\nDuring the September 11 attacks, four teams of al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked four different jetliners Two of these jetliners, American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175, both Boeing 767s, were hijacked after takeoff from Boston's Logan International Airport In its final moments, American Airlines Flight 11 flew south over Manhattan and crashed at roughly 440 mph (710 km/h) into the northern facade of the North Tower (WTC 1) at 8:46 a.m., hitting the 93rd through 99th floors [37] Seventeen minutes later, United Airlines Flight 175 flew northeast, over New York Harbor, and crashed into the southern facade of the South Tower (WTC 2) at 9:03 a.m., [g] striking between the 77th through 85th floors at 540 mph (870 km/h) [38] [39]\n\n\nAircraft impacts and resultant fires\nDuring the September 11 attacks, four teams of al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked four different jetliners Two of these jetliners, American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175, both Boeing 767s, were hijacked after takeoff from Boston's Logan International Airport In its final moments, American Airlines Flight 11 flew south over Manhattan and crashed at roughly 440 mph (710 km/h) into the northern facade of the North Tower (WTC 1) at 8:46 a.m., hitting the 93rd through 99th floors [37] Seventeen minutes later, United Airlines Flight 175 flew northeast, over New York Harbor, and crashed into the southern facade of the South Tower (WTC 2) at 9:03 a.m., [g] striking between the 77th through 85th floors at 540 mph (870 km/h) [38] [39]\n\n\nEmergency response and evacuation\nAlmost all the deaths in the Twin Towers occurred in the zones above the points of aircraft impact As the North Tower had been struck almost directly midway into the structure, the three main stairways (A, B, and C) in the tower core were all damaged or blocked by debris preventing escape to lower floors In the South Tower, the impact was east of center to the central section of the tower and close to the southeast corner, resulting in stairway A in the northwest portion of the central core being intact and only partially blocked, and 18 civilians managed to escape from the point of aircraft impact and the floors above that The exact numbers of who perished and where in some cases is not precisely known; however the National Institute of Standards and Technology report indicated that a total of 1,402 civilians perished at or above the impact point in the North Tower with hundreds estimated to have been killed at the moment of impact In the South Tower, 614 civilians perished at the impacted floors and the floors above that Fewer than 200 of the civilian fatalities occurred in the floors below the impact points but all 147 civilian passengers and crew on the two aircraft as well as all 10 terrorists perished, along with at least 18 people on the ground and in adjacent structures [57]\n\n\nCollapse of the Towers\nThe destruction of the Twin Towers has been called \"the most infamous paradigm\" of progressive collapse [24] Each collapse began with the local failure of the vertical load-bearing components of the floors that were hit by the planes and progressed to encompass the whole of the structure [58] Structural components were severed, releasing gravitational energy that transferred loads downwards by way of serially propagating impact forces [59] Excepting the top floors of the building, which would not have released sufficient gravitational energy to bring about a total collapse, the collapses could have begun with the failure of any story [60]\n\n\nCollapse initiation\nIn both towers, the section of the building that had been damaged by the airplanes failed Aside from the structural damage, the impacts had removed fireproofing from a large part of the impact zone allowing the structural steel to heat rapidly As a result, the core columns were weakened and began to shorten due to creep The hat truss resisted this by shifting loads to the perimeter columns Meanwhile, web diagonals of the 60 foot trusses supporting the long-span tenant floor area began to buckle, causing the floors to sag by more than 2 feet This pulled in the perimeter walls, which buckled The floors above the impact zone now fell freely onto the undamaged structure below [62] [63]\n\n\nTotal progressive collapse\nWhen the columns failed, the entire building above fell onto the first intact floor beneath impact The vertical capacity of the connections supporting an intact floor below the level of collapse was adequate to carry the load of 11 additional floors if the load were applied gradually, but of only 6 additional floors if the load were applied suddenly‍— as was the case Since the number of floors above the approximate floor of collapse initiation exceeded six in each WTC tower (12 floors in WTC 1 and 29 floors in WTC 2), the floors below the level of collapse initiation were unable to resist the suddenly applied gravitational load from the upper floors of the buildings [67]\n\n\nSouth Tower collapse\nAs the fires continued to burn, occupants trapped in the upper floors of the South Tower provided information about conditions to 9-1-1 dispatchers At 9:37 a.m., an occupant on the 105th floor of the South Tower reported that floors beneath him \"in the 90-something floor\" had collapsed [69] The New York City Police Department aviation unit also relayed information about the deteriorating condition of the buildings to police commanders [70] At 9:51 a.m., seven minutes before the collapse, the NYPD aviation unit reported that large pieces of debris were hanging or falling from the South Tower [71] [69] The implied threat of an imminent collapse was sufficient for the NYPD to order its officers to evacuate, although none of the helicopter pilots specifically predicted that either tower would fall During the emergency response, there was little communication between the NYPD and the FDNY, and overwhelmed 9-1-1 dispatchers did not pass along information to FDNY commanders at the scene At 9:59 a.m., [46]: 80  [71]: 322  the South Tower collapsed, 56 minutes [h] after Flight 175 crashed into it.\n\n\nNorth Tower collapse\nThe South Tower's collapse shattered windows and damaged other exterior elements along the North Tower's southern and eastern facades, although this was insufficient to cause its subsequent collapse [48]: 20  After the South Tower fell, NYPD helicopters relayed information about the deteriorating conditions of the North Tower, while FDNY commanders issued orders for firefighters in the North Tower to evacuate Poor radio reception meant firefighters inside the North Tower did not hear the evacuation order from their supervisors on the scene, and most were unaware that the other tower had collapsed [75] An NYPD officer said at 10:06 a.m that the North Tower was not going to last much longer and recommended that emergency vehicles be pulled away from the complex [76] At 10:20 a.m., the NYPD aviation unit reported that \"the top of the tower might be leaning\", and a minute later confirmed that the North Tower was buckling on the southwest corner and leaning to the south, prompting an officer to begin urging all NYPD personnel in the building's vicinity to retreat at least three blocks in every direction [76] The aviation unit declared at 10:27 \"the roof is going to come down very shortly\"; [69] this proved correct less than a minute later, when the North Tower collapsed at 10:28 a.m., [e] one hour and 42 [f] minutes after being struck.\n\n\nBuilding 7 collapse\nAs the North Tower collapsed, heavy debris hit 7 World Trade Center, causing damage to the south face of the building [79] and starting fires that continued to burn throughout the afternoon [80] Structural damage occurred to the southwest corner between Floors 7 and 17 and on the south facade between Floor 44 and the roof; other possible structural damage includes a large vertical gash near the center of the south facade between Floors 24 and 41 [80] The building was equipped with a sprinkler system, but had many single-point vulnerabilities for failure: the sprinkler system required manual initiation of the electrical fire pumps, rather than being a fully automatic system; the floor-level controls had a single connection to the sprinkler water riser; and the sprinkler system required some power for the fire pump to deliver water Also, water pressure was low, with little or no water to feed sprinklers [81] [82]\n\n\nOther buildings\nMany of the surrounding buildings were also either damaged or destroyed as the towers fell 5 World Trade Center endured a large fire and a partial collapse of its steel structure and was torn down Other buildings destroyed include 3 World Trade Center, 4 World Trade Center, 6 World Trade Center, and St Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church The World Financial Center buildings, 90 West Street, and 130 Cedar Street suffered fires  The Deutsche Bank Building, the Verizon Building, and 3 World Financial Center had impact damage from the towers' collapse, [97] as did 90 West Street [98] One Liberty Plaza survived structurally intact but sustained surface damage including shattered windows 30 West Broadway was damaged by the collapse of 7 World Trade Center The Deutsche Bank Building, which was covered in a large black \"shroud\" after September 11 to cover the building's damage, was deconstructed because of water, mold, and other severe damage caused by the neighboring towers' collapse [99] [100] In addition to this, many works of art were destroyed in the collapse.\n\n\nInvestigations\nIn the immediate aftermath of the attacks, numerous structural engineers and experts spoke to the media, describing what they thought caused the towers to collapse Abolhassan Astaneh-Asl, a structural engineering professor at the University of California at Berkeley, explained that the high temperatures in the fires weakened the steel beams and columns, causing them to become \"soft and mushy\", and eventually they were unable to support the structure above Astaneh-Asl also suggested that the fireproofing became dislodged during the initial aircraft impacts He also explained that, once the initial structural failure occurred, progressive collapse of the entire structure was inevitable [101] César Pelli, who designed the Petronas Towers in Malaysia and the World Financial Center in New York, remarked, \"no building is prepared for this kind of stress.\" [102]\n\n\nInitial opinions and analysis\nIn the immediate aftermath of the attacks, numerous

prepared for this kind of stress.\" [102]\n\n\nFEMA building performance study\nFEMA suggested that fires in conjunction with damage resulting from the aircraft impacts were the key to the collapse of the towers Thomas Eagar, Professor of Materials Engineering and Engineering Systems at MIT, described the fires as \"the most misunderstood part of the WTC collapse\" This is because the fires were originally said to have \"melted\" the floors and columns [112] Jet fuel is essentially kerosene and would have served mainly to ignite very large, but not unusually hot, hydrocarbon fires [113] As Eagar said, \"The temperature of the fire at the WTC was not unusual, and it was most definitely not capable of melting steel.\" [114] This led Eagar, FEMA and others to focus on what appeared to be the weakest point of the structures, namely, the points at which the floors were attached to the building frame [115]\n\n\nNIST report\nAfter the FEMA report had been published, and following pressure from technical experts, industry leaders and families of victims, the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology conducted a three-year, $16 million investigation into the structural failure and progressive collapse of several WTC complex structures [117] The study included in-house technical expertise, along with assistance from several outside private institutions, including the Structural Engineering Institute of the American Society of Civil Engineers, Society of Fire Protection Engineers, National Fire Protection Association, American Institute of Steel Construction, Simpson Gumpertz & Heger Inc., Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, and the Structural Engineers Association of New York.\n\n\n7 World Trade Center\nIn May 2002, FEMA issued a report on the collapse based on a preliminary investigation conducted jointly with the Structural Engineering Institute of the American Society of Civil Engineers under leadership of Dr W Gene Corley, P.E FEMA made preliminary findings that the collapse was not primarily caused by actual impact damage from the collapse of 1 WTC and 2 WTC but by fires on multiple stories ignited by debris from the other two towers that continued unabated due to lack of water for sprinklers or manual firefighting The report did not reach conclusions about the cause of the collapse and called for further investigation [citation needed]\n\n\nOther investigations\nIn 2003, Asif Usmani, Professor of Structural Engineering at University of Edinburgh, published a paper with two colleagues They provisionally concluded the fires alone, without any damage from the airplanes, could have been enough to bring down the buildings In their view, the towers were uniquely vulnerable to the effects of large fires on several floors at the same time [130] When the NIST report was published, Barbara Lane, with the UK engineering firm Arup, criticized its conclusion that the loss of fire proofing was a necessary factor in causing the collapses; \"We have carried out computer simulations which show that the towers would have collapsed after a major fire on three floors at once, even with fireproofing in place and without any damage from plane impact.\" [131] Jose L Torero, formerly of the BRE Centre for Fire Safety Engineering at the University of Edinburgh, pursued further research into the potentially catastrophic effects of fire on real-scale buildings [132] [133] [134]\n\n\nAftermath\nThe cleanup was a massive operation coordinated by the City of New York Department of Design and Construction  On September 22, a preliminary cleanup plan was delivered by Controlled Demolition, Inc (CDI) of Phoenix, Maryland [135] Costing hundreds of millions of dollars, it involved round-the-clock operations with many contractors and subcontractors [136] By early November, with a third of the debris removed, officials began to reduce the number of firefighters and police officers assigned to recovering the remains of victims, in order to prioritize the removal of debris This caused confrontations with firefighters [137] Despite efforts to extinguish the blaze, the large pile of debris burned for three months, until the majority of the rubble was finally removed from the site [138] [139] In 2007, the demolition of the surrounding damaged buildings was still ongoing as new construction proceeded on the World Trade Center's replacement, One World Trade Center.\n\n\nCleanup\nThe cleanup was a massive operation coordinated by the City of New York Department

covered Manhattan for days  On September 18, 2001, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  assured the public that the air in Manhattan was \"safe to breathe\" [140] In 2003 the EPA's inspector general found that the agency did not at that time have sufficient data to make such a statement Dust from the collapse seriously reduced air quality and is likely the cause of many respiratory illnesses in lower Manhattan Asbestosis is such an illness, and asbestos would have been present in the dust [141] Significant long term medical and psychological effects have been found among first responders including elevated levels of asthma, sinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease and post-traumatic stress disorder [142]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExplanatory

was a catastrophic event that resulted in the destruction of the Twin Towers, a 47-story skyscraper known as 7 World Trade Center, and significant damage to several surrounding buildings. The collapse was caused by a combination of factors, including the impact of the hijacked aircraft, the resulting fires, and the structural weaknesses of the buildings themselves.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Twin Towers were the tallest buildings in the world at the time of their completion in 1973. They were designed with a novel \"framed tube\" structure that maximized interior space while minimizing the use of materials.

One World Trade Center (WTC 1), the \"North Tower,\" was six feet taller than Two World Trade Center (WTC 2), the \"South Tower.\"\n\nThe towers were designed to withstand extreme weather conditions, including high winds and earthquakes. However, they were not designed to withstand the impact of a large aircraft, and their structural weaknesses were not fully understood at the time of their construction. The use of asbestos for fireproofing was widespread in the construction industry until the mid-1970s, when the New York City Department of Air Resources ordered contractors to stop spraying asbestos as an insulating material.\n\n**Structural Design**\n\nThe Twin Towers were designed as framed tube structures, which provided tenants with open floor plans uninterrupted by columns or walls. The buildings were square and had a rectangular core that supported the elevators and stairwells. The core was surrounded by a perimeter of closely spaced columns that provided much of the structural strength. Above the tenth floor, there were 59 perimeter columns along each face of the building, spaced 3 feet 4 inches (1.02 meters) on center.\n\nThe interior cores of the towers were rectangular and supported by 47 columns that ran the full height of each building. The floors above the impact zone fell freely onto the undamaged structure below, causing the columns to fail and the entire building above to collapse onto the first intact floor beneath the impact.\n\n**Evaluations for Aircraft Impact**\n\nFire studies and analysis of the impacts of low-speed jet aircraft impacts had been undertaken before the towers' completion. However, the full scope of those studies no longer exists.

September 11 attacks, four teams of al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked four different jetliners Two of these jetliners, American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175, both Boeing 767s, were hijacked after takeoff from Boston's Logan International Airport In its final moments, American Airlines Flight 11 flew south over Manhattan and crashed at roughly 440 mph (710 km/h) into the northern facade of the North Tower (WTC 1) at 8:46 a.m., hitting the 93rd through 99th floors [37] Seventeen minutes later, United Airlines Flight 175 flew northeast, over New York Harbor, and crashed into the southern facade of the South Tower (WTC 2) at 9:03 a.m., [g] striking between the 77th through 85th floors at 540 mph (870 km/h) [38] [39]\n\n\nAircraft impacts and resultant fires\nDuring the September 11 attacks, four teams of al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked four different jetliners Two of these jetliners, American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175, both Boeing 767s, were hijacked after takeoff from Boston's Logan International Airport In its final moments, American Airlines Flight 11 flew south over Manhattan and crashed at roughly 440 mph (710 km/h) into the northern facade of the North Tower (WTC 1) at 8:46 a.m., hitting the 93rd through 99th floors [37] Seventeen minutes later, United Airlines Flight 175 flew northeast, over New York Harbor, and crashed into the southern facade of the South Tower (WTC 2) at 9:03 a.m., [g] striking between the 77th through 85th floors at 540 mph (870 km/h) [38] [39]\n\n\nEmergency response and evacuation\nAlmost all the deaths in the Twin Towers occurred in the zones above the points of aircraft impact As the North Tower had been struck almost directly midway into the structure, the three main stairways (A, B, and C) in the tower core were all damaged or blocked by debris preventing escape to lower floors In the South Tower, the impact was east of center to the central section of the tower and close to the southeast corner, resulting in stairway A in the northwest portion of the central core being intact and only partially blocked, and 18 civilians managed to escape from the point of aircraft impact and the floors above that The exact numbers of who perished and where in some cases is not precisely known; however the National Institute of Standards and Technology report indicated that a total of 1,402 civilians perished at or above the impact point in the North Tower with hundreds estimated to have been killed at the moment of impact In the South Tower, 614 civilians perished at the impacted floors and the floors above that Fewer than 200 of the civilian fatalities occurred in the floors below the impact points but all 147 civilian passengers and crew on the two aircraft as well as all 10 terrorists perished, along with at least 18 people on the ground and in adjacent structures [57]\n\n\nCollapse of the Towers\nThe destruction of the Twin Towers has been called \"the most infamous paradigm\" of progressive collapse [24] Each collapse began with the local failure of the vertical load-bearing components of the floors that were hit by the planes and progressed to encompass the whole of the structure [58] Structural components were severed, releasing gravitational energy that transferred loads downwards by way of serially propagating impact forces [59] Excepting the top floors of the building, which would not have released sufficient gravitational energy to bring about a total collapse, the collapses could have begun with the failure of any story [60]\n\n\nCollapse initiation\nIn both towers, the section of the building that had been damaged by the airplanes failed Aside from the structural damage, the impacts had removed fireproofing from a large part of the impact zone allowing the structural steel to heat rapidly As a result, the core columns were weakened and began to shorten due to creep The hat truss resisted this by shifting loads to the perimeter columns Meanwhile, web diagonals of the 60 foot trusses supporting the long-span tenant floor area began to buckle, causing the floors to sag by more than 2 feet This pulled in the perimeter walls, which buckled The floors above the impact zone now fell freely onto the undamaged structure below [62] [63]\n\n\nTotal progressive collapse\nWhen the columns failed, the entire building above fell onto the first intact floor beneath impact The vertical capacity of the connections supporting an intact floor below the level of collapse was adequate to carry the load of 11 additional floors if the load were applied gradually, but of only 6 additional floors if the load were applied suddenly‍— as was the case Since the number of floors above the approximate floor of collapse initiation exceeded six in each WTC tower (12 floors in WTC 1 and 29 floors in WTC 2), the floors below the level of collapse initiation were unable to resist the suddenly applied gravitational load from the upper floors of the buildings [67]\n\n\nSouth Tower collapse\nAs the fires continued to burn, occupants trapped in the upper floors of the South Tower provided information about conditions to 9-1-1 dispatchers At 9:37 a.m., an occupant on the 105th floor of the South Tower reported that floors beneath him \"in the 90-something floor\" had collapsed [69] The New York City Police Department aviation unit also relayed information about the deteriorating condition of the buildings to police commanders [70] At 9:51 a.m., seven minutes before the collapse, the NYPD aviation unit reported that large pieces of debris were hanging or falling from the South Tower [71] [69] The implied threat of an imminent collapse was sufficient for the NYPD to order its officers to evacuate, although none of the helicopter pilots specifically predicted that either tower would fall During the emergency response, there was little communication between the NYPD and the FDNY, and overwhelmed 9-1-1 dispatchers did not pass along information to FDNY commanders at the scene At 9:59 a.m., [46]: 80  [71]: 322  the South Tower collapsed, 56 minutes [h] after Flight 175 crashed into it.\n\n\nNorth Tower collapse\nThe South Tower's collapse shattered windows and damaged other exterior elements along the North Tower's southern and eastern facades, although this was insufficient to cause its subsequent collapse [48]: 20  After the South Tower fell, NYPD helicopters relayed information about the deteriorating conditions of the North Tower, while FDNY commanders issued orders for firefighters in the North Tower to evacuate Poor radio reception meant firefighters inside the North Tower did not hear the evacuation order from their supervisors on the scene, and most were unaware that the other tower had collapsed [75] An NYPD officer said at 10:06 a.m that the North Tower was not going to last much longer and recommended that emergency vehicles be pulled away from the complex [76] At 10:20 a.m., the NYPD aviation unit reported that \"the top of the tower might be leaning\", and a minute later confirmed that the North Tower was buckling on the southwest corner and leaning to the south, prompting an officer to begin urging all NYPD personnel in the building's vicinity to retreat at least three blocks in every direction [76] The aviation unit declared at 10:27 \"the roof is going to come down very shortly\"; [69] this proved correct less than a minute later, when the North Tower collapsed at 10:28 a.m., [e] one hour and 42 [f] minutes after being struck.\n\n\nBuilding 7 collapse\nAs the North Tower collapsed, heavy debris hit 7 World Trade Center, causing damage to the south face of the building [79] and starting fires that continued to burn throughout the afternoon [80] Structural damage occurred to the southwest corner between Floors 7 and 17 and on the south facade between Floor 44 and the roof; other possible structural damage includes a large vertical gash near the center of the south facade between Floors 24 and 41 [80] The building was equipped with a sprinkler system, but had many single-point vulnerabilities for failure: the sprinkler system required manual initiation of the electrical fire pumps, rather than being a fully automatic system; the floor-level controls had a single connection to the sprinkler water riser; and the sprinkler system required some power for the fire pump to deliver water Also, water pressure was low, with little or no water to feed sprinklers [81] [82]\n\n\nOther buildings\nMany of the surrounding buildings were also either damaged or destroyed as the towers fell 5 World Trade Center endured a large fire and a partial collapse of its steel structure and was torn down Other buildings destroyed include 3 World Trade Center, 4 World Trade Center, 6 World Trade Center, and St Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church The World Financial Center buildings, 90 West Street, and 130 Cedar Street suffered fires  The Deutsche Bank Building, the Verizon Building, and 3 World Financial Center had impact damage from the towers' collapse, [97] as did 90 West Street [98] One Liberty Plaza survived structurally intact but sustained surface damage including shattered windows 30 West Broadway was damaged by the collapse of 7 World Trade Center The Deutsche Bank Building, which was covered in a large black \"shroud\" after September 11 to cover the building's damage, was deconstructed because of water, mold, and other severe damage caused by the neighboring towers' collapse [99] [100] In addition to this, many works of art were destroyed in the collapse.\n\n\nInvestigations\nIn the immediate aftermath of the attacks, numerous structural engineers and experts spoke to the media, describing what they thought caused the towers to collapse Abolhassan Astaneh-Asl, a structural engineering professor at the University of California at Berkeley, explained that the high temperatures in the fires weakened the steel beams and columns, causing them to become \"soft and mushy\", and eventually they were unable to support the structure above Astaneh-Asl also suggested that the fireproofing became dislodged during the initial aircraft impacts He also explained that, once the initial structural failure occurred, progressive collapse of the entire structure was inevitable [101] César Pelli, who designed the Petronas Towers in Malaysia and the World Financial Center in New York, remarked, \"no building is prepared for this kind of stress.\" [102]\n\n\nInitial opinions and analysis\nIn the immediate aftermath of the attacks, numerous

prepared for this kind of stress.\" [102]\n\n\nFEMA building performance study\nFEMA suggested that fires in conjunction with damage resulting from the aircraft impacts were the key to the collapse of the towers Thomas Eagar, Professor of Materials Engineering and Engineering Systems at MIT, described the fires as \"the most misunderstood part of the WTC collapse\" This is because the fires were originally said to have \"melted\" the floors and columns [112] Jet fuel is essentially kerosene and would have served mainly to ignite very large, but not unusually hot, hydrocarbon fires [113] As Eagar said, \"The temperature of the fire at the WTC was not unusual, and it was most definitely not capable of melting steel.\" [114] This led Eagar, FEMA and others to focus on what appeared to be the weakest point of the structures, namely, the points at which the floors were attached to the building frame [115]\n\n\nNIST report\nAfter the FEMA report had been published, and following pressure from technical experts, industry leaders and families of victims, the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology conducted a three-year, $16 million investigation into the structural failure and progressive collapse of several WTC complex structures [117] The study included in-house technical expertise, along with assistance from several outside private institutions, including the Structural Engineering Institute of the American Society of Civil Engineers, Society of Fire Protection Engineers, National Fire Protection Association, American Institute of Steel Construction, Simpson Gumpertz & Heger Inc., Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, and the Structural Engineers Association of New York.\n\n\n7 World Trade Center\nIn May 2002, FEMA issued a report on the collapse based on a preliminary investigation conducted jointly with the Structural Engineering Institute of the American Society of Civil Engineers under leadership of Dr W Gene Corley, P.E FEMA made preliminary findings that the collapse was not primarily caused by actual impact damage from the collapse of 1 WTC and 2 WTC but by fires on multiple stories ignited by debris from the other two towers that continued unabated due to lack of water for sprinklers or manual firefighting The report did not reach conclusions about the cause of the collapse and called for further investigation [citation needed]\n\n\nOther investigations\nIn 2003, Asif Usmani, Professor of Structural Engineering at University of Edinburgh, published a paper with two colleagues They provisionally concluded the fires alone, without any damage from the airplanes, could have been enough to bring down the buildings In their view, the towers were uniquely vulnerable to the effects of large fires on several floors at the same time [130] When the NIST report was published, Barbara Lane, with the UK engineering firm Arup, criticized its conclusion that the loss of fire proofing was a necessary factor in causing the collapses; \"We have carried out computer simulations which show that the towers would have collapsed after a major fire on three floors at once, even with fireproofing in place and without any damage from plane impact.\" [131] Jose L Torero, formerly of the BRE Centre for Fire Safety Engineering at the University of Edinburgh, pursued further research into the potentially catastrophic effects of fire on real-scale buildings [132] [133] [134]\n\n\nAftermath\nThe cleanup was a massive operation coordinated by the City of New York Department of Design and Construction  On September 22, a preliminary cleanup plan was delivered by Controlled Demolition, Inc (CDI) of Phoenix, Maryland [135] Costing hundreds of millions of dollars, it involved round-the-clock operations with many contractors and subcontractors [136] By early November, with a third of the debris removed, officials began to reduce the number of firefighters and police officers assigned to recovering the remains of victims, in order to prioritize the removal of debris This caused confrontations with firefighters [137] Despite efforts to extinguish the blaze, the large pile of debris burned for three months, until the majority of the rubble was finally removed from the site [138] [139] In 2007, the demolition of the surrounding damaged buildings was still ongoing as new construction proceeded on the World Trade Center's replacement, One World Trade Center.\n\n\nCleanup\nThe cleanup was a massive operation coordinated by the City of New York Department

covered Manhattan for days  On September 18, 2001, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  assured the public that the air in Manhattan was \"safe to breathe\" [140] In 2003 the EPA's inspector general found that the agency did not at that time have sufficient data to make such a statement Dust from the collapse seriously reduced air quality and is likely the cause of many respiratory illnesses in lower Manhattan Asbestosis is such an illness, and asbestos would have been present in the dust [141] Significant long term medical and psychological effects have been found among first responders including elevated levels of asthma, sinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease and post-traumatic stress disorder [142]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExplanatory

It is a significant event that commemorates the willingness of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) to sacrifice his son Ismail (Ishmael) as an act of obedience to God.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe Arabic word عيد (ʿīd) means 'festival', 'celebration', 'feast day', or 'holiday'. The word عيد is a triliteral root (ʕ-y-d), with associated root meanings of \"to go back, to rescind, to accrue, to be accustomed, habits, to repeat, to be experienced; appointed time or place, anniversary, feast day\".\n\n**Origin**\n\nAccording to Islamic tradition, one of the main trials of Prophet Ibrahim's life was to receive and obey the command of God to slaughter his beloved son Ismail. The story is narrated in the Quran, where Ibrahim is told to sacrifice his son as a test of his faith. Ibrahim, who is known for his unwavering obedience to God, prepares to carry out the sacrifice, but is ultimately saved by God, who provides him with a lamb to sacrifice instead.\n\n**Observances**\n\nIn the days preceding Eid al-Adha and during the Eid and Tashreeq days, Muslims recite the takbir, a phrase that expresses gratitude to God for the blessings and mercy He has bestowed upon them. Like on Eid al-Fitr, the Eid prayer is performed on Eid al-Adha any time after sunrise and before the Zuhr prayer. The prayer is followed by a khutbah (sermon), in which the Imam delivers a message to the congregation, reminding them of the significance of the day and the importance of sacrifice, compassion, and generosity.\n\nAt the conclusion of the prayers and sermon, Muslims exchange gifts and greetings with one another, such as the phrase \"Eid Mubarak\". Many Muslims also take this opportunity to invite their friends, neighbors, and colleagues to the festivities to better acquaint them about Islam and Muslim culture.\n\n**Udhiyah**\n\nAfter the Eid prayer, udhiyah, or the ritual sacrifice of cattle, may be performed. Affluent Muslims who can afford it sacrifice halal cattle, usually a camel, goat, sheep, or ram, as a symbol of Ibrahim's willingness to sacrifice his only son. The animals have to meet certain age and quality standards to be considered for sacrifice. In Pakistan alone, roughly 7.5 million animals, costing an estimated $3 billion (equivalent to $4.16 billion in 2023), were sacrificed in 2011.\n\nThe meat from the sacrificed animal is generally divided into three parts: the family performing the udhiyah retains a third; while the remainder is equally divided between friends and relatives, and the poor. This division is based on the Islamic principle of sharing and distributing wealth equally among those in need.\n\n**In the Gregorian Calendar**\n\nWhile Eid al-Adha is always on the same day of the Islamic calendar, the date on the Gregorian calendar varies from year to year since the Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar and the Gregorian calendar is a solar calendar. The lunar calendar is approximately eleven days shorter than the solar calendar. Each year, Eid al-Adha (like other Islamic holidays) falls on one of about two to four Gregorian dates in parts of the world, because the boundary of crescent visibility is different from the International Date Line.\n\n**Environmental Impact**\n\nThe celebration of Eid al-Adha is noted for causing pollution. Activist groups in countries like Indonesia have opted for an eco-friendly celebration of the festival, promoting the use of biodegradable products, reducing meat consumption, and encouraging the use of public transportation.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, Eid al-Adha is a significant Islamic holiday that commemorates the willingness of Prophet Ibrahim to sacrifice his son Ismail as an act of obedience to God. The holiday is celebrated by Muslims around the world, with observances that include the recitation of the takbir, the Eid prayer, and the ritual sacrifice of cattle. The environmental impact of the celebration is a concern, but efforts are being made to promote eco-friendly practices and reduce pollution.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Eid_al-Adha\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe Arabic word عيد (ʿīd) means 'festival', 'celebration', 'feast day', or 'holiday' The word عيد is a triliteral root (ʕ-y-d), with associated root meanings of \"to go back, to rescind, to accrue, to be accustomed, habits, to repeat, to be experienced; appointed time or place, anniversary, feast day\" [17] [18] Arthur Jeffery contests this etymology, and believes the term to have been borrowed into Arabic from Syriac, or less likely Targumic Aramaic [19]\n\n\nOrigin\n\nOne of the main trials of Abraham's life was to receive and obey the command of God to slaughter his beloved son Ishmael According to the narrative, Abraham kept having dreams that he was sacrificing his son Abraham knew that this was a command from God and he told his son, as stated in the Quran,\n\nObservances\n\nIn the days preceding Eid al-Adha and during the Eid and Tashreeq days, Muslims recite the takbir [32] [33] Like on Eid al-Fitr, the Eid prayer is performed on Eid al-Adha any time after sunrise and before the Zuhr prayer In the event of a force majeure, the prayer may be delayed to the day after, or the second day after Eid [34] The Eid prayer is followed by a khutbah (sermon) [35] At the conclusion of the prayers and sermon, Muslims embrace and exchange gifts and greetings with one another, such as the phrase Eid Mubarak Many Muslims also take this opportunity to invite their friends, neighbours and colleagues to the festivities to better acquaint them about Islam and Muslim culture [36]\n\nUdhiyah\nAfter the Eid prayer, udhiyah, or the ritual sacrifice of cattle, may be performed Affluent Muslims who can afford it sacrifice halal cattle, usually a camel, goat, sheep, or ram, as a symbol of Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his only son [37] [38] The animals have to meet certain age and quality standards to be considered for sacrifice [39] In Pakistan alone, roughly 7.5 million animals, costing an estimated $3 billion (equivalent to $4.16 billion in 2023), were sacrificed in 2011 [40] [41] The meat from the sacrificed animal is generally divided into three parts: the family performing the udhiyah retains a third; while the remainder is equally divided between friends and relatives, and the poor [37]\n\n\nIn the Gregorian calendar\nWhile Eid al-Adha is always on the same day of the Islamic calendar, the date on the Gregorian calendar varies from year to year since the Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar and the Gregorian calendar is a solar calendar The lunar calendar is approximately eleven days shorter than the solar calendar [46] [a] Each year, Eid al-Adha (like other Islamic holidays) falls on one of about two to four Gregorian dates in parts of the world, because the boundary of crescent visibility is different from the International Date Line [47]\n\n\nEnvironmental impact\nThe celebration of Eid al-Adha is noted for causing pollution [50] Activist groups in countries like Indonesia have opted for an eco-friendly celebration of the festival [51]\n\n\nExplanatory notes\n(federal) = federal holidays, (abbreviation) = state/territorial holidays, (religious) = religious holidays, (cultural) = holiday related to a specific racial/ethnic group or sexual minority, (week) = week-long holidays, (month) = month-long holidays, (36) = Title 36 Observances and Ceremonies\n\n\nReferences\n(federal) = federal holidays, (abbreviation) = state/territorial holidays, (religious) = religious holidays, (cultural) = holiday related to a specific racial/ethnic group or sexual minority, (week) = week-long holidays, (month) = month-long holidays, (36) = Title 36 Observances and Ceremonies\n\n\nExternal links\n(federal) = federal holidays, (abbreviation) = state/territorial holidays, (religious) = religious holidays, (cultural) = holiday related to a specific racial/ethnic group or sexual minority, (week) = week-long holidays, (month) = month-long holidays, (36) = Title 36 Observances and Ceremonies\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Anthony_Eden", "content": "\nFamily\nEden was born on 12 June 1897 at Windlestone Hall, County Durham, into a conservative family of landed gentry He was the third of four sons of Sir William Eden, 7th and 5th Baronet, and Sybil Frances Grey, a member of the prominent Grey family of Northumberland Sir William was a former colonel and local magistrate from an old titled family An eccentric and often foul-tempered man, he was a talented watercolourist, portraitist, and collector of Impressionists [10] [11] Eden's mother had wanted to marry Francis Knollys, who later became a significant Royal adviser, but the match was forbidden by the Prince of Wales [12] Although she was a popular figure locally, she had a strained relationship with her children, and her profligacy ruined the family fortunes, [11] meaning Eden's elder brother Tim had to sell Windlestone in 1936 [13] Referring to his parentage, Rab Butler would later quip that Anthony Eden — a handsome but ill-tempered man — was \"half mad baronet, half beautiful woman\" [8] [14]\n\n\nEarly life\nEden was educated at two independent schools He attended Sandroyd School in Wiltshire from 1907 to 1910, where he excelled in languages [22] He then started at Eton College in January 1911 [23] There, he won a Divinity prize and excelled at cricket, rugby and rowing, winning House colours in the last

brother, Lieutenant John Eden, was killed in action on 17 October 1914, at the age of 26, while serving with the 12th (Prince of Wales's Royal) Lancers He is buried in Larch Wood (Railway Cutting) Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery in Belgium [31] His uncle Robin was later shot down and captured whilst serving with the Royal Flying Corps [32]\n\n\nOxford\nEden had dabbled in the study of Turkish with a family friend [49] After the war, he studied Oriental Languages (Persian and Arabic) at Christ Church, Oxford, starting in October 1919 [50] Persian was his main and Arabic his secondary language He studied under Richard Paset Dewhurst and David Samuel Margoliouth [49]\n\n\nEarly political career, 1922–1931\nCaptain Eden, as he was still known, was selected to contest Spennymoor, as a Conservative At first, he had hoped to win with some Liberal support, as the Conservatives were still supporting Lloyd George's coalition government, but by the time of the November 1922 general election, it was clear that the surge in the Labour vote made that unlikely [56] His main sponsor was the Marquess of Londonderry, a local coal owner The seat went from Liberal to Labour

Marquess of Londonderry, a local coal owner The seat went from Liberal to Labour [57]\n\n\n1924–1929\nThe Conservatives returned to power at the 1924 general election In January 1925, Eden, disappointed not to have been offered a position, went on a tour of the Middle East and met Emir Feisal of Iraq Feisal reminded him of the \"Czar of Russia & (I) suspect that his fate may be similar\" (a similar fate indeed befell the Iraqi Royal Family in 1958) During a visit to Pahlavi Iran he inspected the Abadan Refinery, which he likened to \"a Swansea on a small scale\" [65]\n\n\n1929–1931\nThe 1929 general election was the only time that Eden received less than 50% of the vote at Warwick [74] After the Conservative defeat, he joined a progressive group of younger politicians consisting of Oliver Stanley, William Ormsby-Gore and the future Speaker W.S \"Shakes\" Morrison Another member was Noel Skelton, who had before his death coined the phrase \"property-owning democracy\", which Eden was later to popularise as a Conservative Party aspiration Eden advocated co-partnership in industry between managers and workers, whom he wanted to be given shares [73]\n\n\nForeign Affairs Minister, 1931–1935\nIn August 1931, Eden held his first ministerial office as Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs in Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald's National Government Initially, the office was held by Lord Reading (in the House of Lords), but Sir John Simon held the position from November 1931.\n\n\nForeign Secretary and resignation, 1935–1938\nEden became Foreign Secretary after Samuel Hoare had resigned after the collapse of the Hoare–Laval Pact Britain had to adjust its foreign policy to face the rise of the fascist powers of Nazi Germany and Hitler as well as Italian fascism and Mussolini He supported the policy of non-interference in the Spanish Civil War through conferences such as the Nyon Conference and supported Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and his National Government in their efforts to preserve peace through seemingly reasonable concessions to Nazi Germany.\n\n\nSecond World War\nDuring the last months of peace in 1939, Eden joined the Territorial Army with the rank of major, in the London Rangers motorised battalion of the King's Royal Rifle Corps and was at annual camp with them in Beaulieu, Hampshire, when he heard news of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact [98]\n\n\nPostwar, 1945–1955\nAfter the Labour Party won the 1945 election, Eden went into opposition as Deputy Leader of the Conservative Party [citation needed] Many felt that Churchill should have retired and allowed Eden to become party leader, but Churchill refused to consider the idea As early as the spring of 1946, Eden openly asked Churchill to retire in his favour [112] He was in any case depressed by the end of his first marriage and the death of his eldest son Churchill was, in many ways, only \"part-time Leader of the Opposition\" [3] because of his many journeys abroad and his literary work, and left the day-to-day work largely to Eden, who was largely regarded as lacking a sense of party politics and contact with the common man [113] In the opposition years, however, he developed some knowledge about domestic affairs and created the idea of a \"property-owning-democracy\", which Margaret Thatcher's government attempted to achieve decades later His domestic agenda is overall considered to be centre-left [3]\n\n\nIn opposition, 1945–1951\nAfter the Labour Party won the 1945 election, Eden went into opposition as Deputy

returned to office and Eden became Foreign Secretary for a third time [117] Churchill was largely a figurehead in the government, and Eden had effective control of British foreign policy for the second time, with the decline of the empire and the intensifying of the Cold War Churchill wanted to appoint Eden Deputy Prime Minister as well as Foreign Secretary, but the King objected and said that the office did not exist in the UK constitution and might interfere with his ability to appoint a successor [118] [119] Thus, Eden was not appointed Deputy Prime Minister [118] [120] However, he still considered himself Churchill's \"second-in-command\" and had been regarded as Churchill's \"crown prince\" since 1942 [121]\n\nPrime Minister, 1955–1957\nIn April 1955 Churchill retired, and Eden succeeded him as prime minister He was a very popular figure as a result of his long wartime service and his famous good looks and charm His famous words \"Peace comes first, always\" added to his already substantial popularity.\n\n\nSuez (1956)\nThe alliance with the US proved not universal, however, when in July 1956 Gamal Abdel Nasser, President of Egypt, nationalised the Suez Canal, following the withdrawal of Anglo-American funding for the Aswan Dam Eden believed the nationalisation was in violation of the Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1954 that Nasser had signed with the British and French governments on 19 October 1954 This view was shared by Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell and Liberal leader Jo Grimond [135] In 1956 the Suez Canal was of vital importance since over two-thirds of the oil supplies of Western Europe (60 million tons annually) passed through it on 15,000 ships a year, one-third of them British; three-quarters of all Canal shipping belonged to NATO countries Britain's total oil reserve at the time of the nationalisation was enough for only six weeks [136] The Soviet Union was certain to veto any sanctions against Nasser at the United Nations Britain and a conference of other nations met in London following the nationalisation in an attempt to resolve the crisis through diplomatic means However, the Eighteen Nations Proposals, including an offer of Egyptian representation on the board of the Suez Canal Company and a share of profits, were rejected by Nasser [137] Eden feared that Nasser intended to form an Arab Alliance that would threaten to cut off oil supplies to Europe and, in conjunction with France, decided he should be removed from power [138]\n\n\n1957 resignation\nWhile Eden was on holiday in Goldeneye Estate in Oracabessa Bay in Jamaica, other members of the government discussed on 20 November 1956 how to counter charges that the UK and France had worked in collusion with Israel to seize the Canal, but decided there was very little evidence in the public domain [156]\n\n\nBritain–France rejected plan for union\nBritish Government cabinet papers from September 1956, during Eden's term as prime minister, have shown that French Prime Minister Guy Mollet approached the British Government suggesting the idea of an economic and political union between France and Great Britain [164] This was a similar offer, in reverse, to that made by Churchill (drawing on a plan devised by Leo Amery [165]) in June 1940 [166]\n\n\nRetirement\nEden also resigned from the House of Commons when he stood down as prime minister [168] Eden kept in touch with Lord Salisbury, agreeing with him that Macmillan had been the better choice as prime minister, but sympathising with his resignation over Macmillan's Cyprus policy Despite a series of letters in which Macmillan almost begged him for a personal endorsement prior to the 1959 election, Eden only issued a declaration of support for the Conservative Government [169] Eden retained much of his personal popularity in Britain and contemplated returning to Parliament Several Conservative MPs were reportedly willing to give up their seats for him, although the party hierarchy was less keen He finally gave up such hopes in late 1960 after an exhausting speaking tour of Yorkshire [168] Macmillan initially offered to recommend him for a viscountcy, which Eden assumed to be a calculated insult, and he was granted an earldom (which was then the traditional rank for a former prime minister) after reminding Macmillan that he had already been offered one by the Queen [169] He entered the House of Lords as the Earl of Avon in 1961 [170]\n\n\nMemoirs\n\n\nPersonal life\nOn 5 November 1923, shortly before his election to Parliament, he married Beatrice Beckett, who was then eighteen [182] They had three sons: Simon Gascoigne (1924–1945), Robert, who died fifteen minutes after being born in October 1928, and Nicholas (1930–1985) [183]\n\n\nRelationships\nOn 5 November 1923, shortly before his election to Parliament, he married Beatrice Beckett, who was then eighteen [182] They had three sons: Simon Gascoigne (1924–1945), Robert, who died fifteen minutes after being born in October 1928, and Nicholas (1930–1985) [183]\n\n\nHealth issues\nEden had a stomach ulcer, exacerbated by overwork, as early as the 1920s [189] He also had gallstones, requiring surgery to remove the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) The physician consulted at the time was the Royal Physician, Sir Horace Evans Three surgeons were recommended and Eden chose the one that had previously performed his appendectomy, John Basil Hume, surgeon from St Bartholomew's Hospital [190] During the open cholecystectomy on 12 April 1953, in London, United Kingdom, it is thought that the common bile duct was damaged, leaving Eden susceptible to recurrent infections, biliary obstruction, and liver failure [191] [192]\n\n\nFinal illness and death\nIn December 1976, Lord Avon, as Eden now was, felt well enough to travel with his wife to the United States to spend Christmas and New Year with Averell and Pamela Harriman; however, after reaching the United States, his health rapidly deteriorated Prime Minister James Callaghan arranged for an RAF plane that was already in America to divert to Miami, to fly Avon home [198]\n\n\nLegacy\nEden was well-mannered, well-groomed, and good-looking This image gave him huge popular support throughout his political life, but some contemporaries felt he was merely a superficial person lacking any deeper convictions That view was enforced by his very pragmatic approach to politics Sir Oswald Mosley, for example, said he never understood why Eden was so strongly pushed by the Tory party, as he felt that Eden's abilities were very much inferior to those of Harold Macmillan and Oliver Stanley [205] In 1947, Dick Crossman called Eden \"that peculiarly British type, the idealist without conviction\" [206]\n\n\nCultural

Eden to become party leader, but Churchill refused to consider the idea As early as the spring of 1946, Eden openly asked Churchill to retire in his favour [112] He was in any case depressed by the end of his first marriage and the death of his eldest son Churchill was, in many ways, only \"part-time Leader of the Opposition\" [3] because of his many journeys abroad and his literary work, and left the day-to-day work largely to Eden, who was largely regarded as lacking a sense of party politics and contact with the common man [113] In the opposition years, however, he developed some knowledge about domestic affairs and created the idea of a \"property-owning-democracy\", which Margaret Thatcher's government attempted to achieve decades later His domestic agenda is overall considered to be centre-left [3]\n\n\nReturn to government, 1951–1955\n\nIn 1951 the Conservatives returned to office and Eden became Foreign Secretary for a third time [117] Churchill was largely a figurehead in the government, and Eden had effective control of British foreign policy for the second time, with the decline of the empire and the intensifying of the Cold War Churchill wanted to appoint Eden Deputy Prime Minister as well as Foreign Secretary, but the King objected and said that the office did not exist in the UK constitution and might interfere with his ability to appoint a successor [118] [119] Thus, Eden was not appointed Deputy Prime Minister [118] [120] However, he still considered himself Churchill's \"second-in-command\" and had been regarded as Churchill's \"crown prince\" since 1942 [121]\n\nPrime Minister, 1955–1957\nIn April 1955 Churchill retired, and Eden succeeded him as prime minister He was a very popular figure as a result of his long wartime service and his famous good looks and charm His famous words \"Peace comes first, always\" added to his already substantial popularity.\n\n\nSuez (1956)\nThe alliance with the US proved not universal, however, when in July 1956 Gamal Abdel Nasser, President of Egypt, nationalised the Suez Canal, following the withdrawal of Anglo-American funding for the Aswan Dam Eden believed the nationalisation was in violation of the Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1954 that Nasser had signed with the British and French governments on 19 October 1954 This view was shared by Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell and Liberal leader Jo Grimond [135] In 1956 the Suez Canal was of vital importance since over two-thirds of the oil supplies of Western Europe (60 million tons annually) passed through it on 15,000 ships a year, one-third of them British; three-quarters of all Canal shipping belonged to NATO countries Britain's total oil reserve at the time of the nationalisation was enough for only six weeks [136] The Soviet Union was certain to veto any sanctions against Nasser at the United Nations Britain and a conference of other nations met in London following the nationalisation in an attempt to resolve the crisis through diplomatic means However, the Eighteen Nations Proposals, including an offer of Egyptian representation on the board of the Suez Canal Company and a share of profits, were rejected by Nasser [137] Eden feared that Nasser intended to form an Arab Alliance that would threaten to cut off oil supplies to Europe and, in conjunction with France, decided he should be removed from power [138]\n\n\n1957 resignation\nWhile Eden was on holiday in Goldeneye Estate in Oracabessa Bay in Jamaica, other members of the government discussed on 20 November 1956 how to counter charges that the UK and France had worked in collusion with Israel to seize the Canal, but decided there was very little evidence in the public domain [156]\n\n\nBritain–France rejected plan for union\nBritish Government cabinet papers from September 1956, during Eden's term as prime minister, have shown that French Prime Minister Guy Mollet approached the British Government suggesting the idea of an economic and political union between France and Great Britain [164] This was a similar offer, in reverse, to that made by Churchill (drawing on a plan devised by Leo Amery [165]) in June 1940 [166]\n\n\nRetirement\nEden also resigned from the House of Commons when he stood down as prime minister [168] Eden kept in touch with Lord Salisbury, agreeing with him that Macmillan had been the better choice as prime minister, but sympathising with his resignation over Macmillan's Cyprus policy Despite a series of letters in which Macmillan almost begged him for a personal endorsement prior to the 1959 election, Eden only issued a declaration of support for the Conservative Government [169] Eden retained much of his personal popularity in Britain and contemplated returning to Parliament Several Conservative MPs were reportedly willing to give up their seats for him, although the party hierarchy was less keen He finally gave up such hopes in late 1960 after an exhausting speaking tour of Yorkshire [168] Macmillan initially offered to recommend him for a viscountcy, which Eden assumed to be a calculated insult, and he was granted an earldom (which was then the traditional rank for a former prime minister) after reminding Macmillan that he had already been offered one by the Queen [169] He entered the House of Lords as the Earl of Avon in 1961 [170]\n\n\nMemoirs\n\n\nPersonal life\nOn 5 November 1923, shortly before his election to Parliament, he married Beatrice Beckett, who was then eighteen [182] They had three sons: Simon Gascoigne (1924–1945), Robert, who died fifteen minutes after being born in October 1928, and Nicholas (1930–1985) [183]\n\n\nRelationships\nOn 5 November 1923, shortly before his election to Parliament, he married Beatrice Beckett, who was then eighteen [182] They had three sons: Simon Gascoigne (1924–1945), Robert, who died fifteen minutes after being born in October 1928, and Nicholas (1930–1985) [183]\n\n\nHealth issues\nEden had a stomach ulcer, exacerbated by overwork, as early as the 1920s [189] He also had gallstones, requiring surgery to remove the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) The physician consulted at the time was the Royal Physician, Sir Horace Evans Three surgeons were recommended and Eden chose the one that had previously performed his appendectomy, John Basil Hume, surgeon from St Bartholomew's Hospital [190] During the open cholecystectomy on 12 April 1953, in London, United Kingdom, it is thought that the common bile duct was damaged, leaving Eden susceptible to recurrent infections, biliary obstruction, and liver failure [191] [192]\n\n\nFinal illness and death\nIn December 1976, Lord Avon, as Eden now was, felt well enough to travel with his wife to the United States to spend Christmas and New Year with Averell and Pamela Harriman; however, after reaching the United States, his health rapidly deteriorated Prime Minister James Callaghan arranged for an RAF plane that was already in America to divert to Miami, to fly Avon home [198]\n\n\nLegacy\nEden was well-mannered, well-groomed, and good-looking This image gave him huge popular support throughout his political life, but some contemporaries felt he was merely a superficial person lacking any deeper convictions That view was enforced by his very pragmatic approach to politics Sir Oswald Mosley, for example, said he never understood why Eden was so strongly pushed by the Tory party, as he felt that Eden's abilities were very much inferior to those of Harold Macmillan and Oliver Stanley [205] In 1947, Dick Crossman called Eden \"that peculiarly British type, the idealist without conviction\" [206]\n\n\nCultural depictions\nPersonal and political papers of Anthony Eden and papers of the Eden family can be found

Gucci vacillates between inspired camp and dour drama too often to pull off a confident runway strut, but Lady Gaga's note-perfect performance has a timeless style all its own.\" [62] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 59 out of 100 based on 59 critics, indicating mixed or average reviews [63] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it an 82% positive score, with 60% saying they would definitely recommend it Deadline Hollywood noted a strong divide between critics and

she stated she was \"annoyed\" that Gaga had not contacted her to meet her and claimed that \"it is not an economic question I won't get a cent from the film It is a question of good sense and respect\" [75] Later that month, it was confirmed that the producers did not want Gaga to meet her and they were \"aware of not wanting to endorse or support the awful crime\" she committed, saying Gaga had watched much footage and many documentaries, and read books about her life [76] Gaga also stated that she has no interest in \"colluding\" with Reggiani, but her heart goes \"out to her daughters.. I do care deeply that this must be very painful for them.\" [77]\n\n\nAccolades\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1. Write the article in a neutral, encyclopedic tone\n2.

asked to direct The Matrix [36] Reeves said that the Matrix avatar would have been a \"different sex than the Zion reality\" in the early draft of the script, but the studio was not ready for that version [37]\n\n\nPre-production\nThe cast were required to be able to understand and explain The Matrix [36] French philosopher Jean Baudrillard's Simulacra and Simulation was required reading for most of the principal cast and crew [44] In early 1997, the Wachowskis had Reeves read Simulacra and Simulation, Kevin Kelly's Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World, and Dylan Evans's ideas on evolutionary psychology even before they opened up the script, [16] and eventually he was able to explain all the philosophical nuances involved [36] Moss commented that she had difficulty with this process [16]\n\n\nFilming\nAll but a few scenes were filmed at Fox Studios in Sydney, as well as in the city itself, although recognizable landmarks were not included to maintain the impression of a generic American city The filming helped establish New South Wales as a major film production center [49] [50] Filming began in March 1998 and wrapped in August 1998; principal photography took 118 days [51] Some filming also occurred at Culver Studios [52]\n\n\nSound effects and music\nDane A Davis was responsible for creating the sound effects for the film The fight scene sound effects, such as the whipping sounds of punches, were created using thin metal rods and recording them, then editing the sounds The sound of the pod containing a human body closing required almost fifty sounds put together [65]\n\n\nProduction design\nIn the film, the code that composes the Matrix itself is frequently represented as downward-flowing green characters [72] This code uses a custom typeface designed by Simon Whiteley, [42] which includes mirror images of half-width kana characters and Western Latin letters and Arabic numerals [73] In a 2017 interview at CNET, he attributed the design to his wife, who is from Japan, and added, \"I like to tell everybody that The Matrix's code is made out of Japanese sushi recipes\" [74] \"The color green reflects the green tint commonly used on early monochrome computer monitors\" [75] Lynne Cartwright, the Visual Effects Supervisor at Animal Logic, supervised the creation of the film's opening title sequence, as well as the general look of the Matrix code throughout the film, in collaboration with Lindsay Fleay and Justen Marshall [42] The portrayal resembles the opening credits of the 1995 Japanese cyberpunk film, Ghost in the Shell, which had a strong influence on the Matrix series It was also used in the subsequent films, on the related website, and in the game The Matrix: Path of Neo, and its drop-down effect is reflected in the design of some posters for the Matrix series The code received the Runner-up Award in the 1999 Jesse Garson Award for In-film typography or opening credit sequence [42]\n\n\nVisual effects\nAs for artistic inspiration for bullet time, I would credit Otomo Katsuhiro, who co-wrote and directed Akira, which definitely blew me away, along with director Michel Gondry His music videos experimented with a different type of technique called view-morphing and it was just part of the beginning of uncovering the creative approaches toward using still cameras for special effects Our technique was significantly different because we built it to move around objects that were themselves in motion, and we were also able to create slow-motion events that 'virtual cameras' could move around—rather than the static action in Gondry's music videos with limited camera moves.\n\nRelease\nThe Matrix was released on DVD and Laserdisc in its original aspect ratio of 2.39:1 on

authors of science fiction, [11] especially for its \"spectacular action\" scenes and its \"groundbreaking special effects\" Some have described The Matrix as one of the best science fiction films of all time; [12] [13] Entertainment Weekly called The Matrix \"the most influential action movie of the generation\" [26] There have also been those, including philosopher William Irwin, who have suggested that the film explores significant philosophical and spiritual themes On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 83% based on 210 reviews, with an average score of 7.7/10 The site's critical consensus reads, \"Thanks to the Wachowskis' imaginative vision, The Matrix is a smartly crafted combination of spectacular action and groundbreaking special effects\" [10] At Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received a score of 73 based on 35 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\" [11] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale [119] It ranked 323rd among critics, and 546th among directors, in the 2012 Sight & Sound polls of the greatest films ever made [120]\n\n\nAccolades\n\n\n\nAwards and nominations\nThe Matrix is arguably the ultimate cyberpunk artifact.\n\n\nThematic analysis\nThe Matrix is arguably the ultimate cyberpunk artifact.\n\n\nFilm and television\nThe pods in which the machines keep humans have been compared to images in Metropolis, and the work of M C Escher [145] A resemblance to the eerie worlds of Swiss artist H.R Giger was also recognized [146] [147] The pods can be seen in Welcome to Paradox Episode 4 \"News from D Street\" from a 1986 short story [148] of the same name by Andrew Weiner which aired on September 7, 1998, on the SYFY Channel and has a remarkably similar concept In this episode the hero is unaware he is living in virtual reality until he is told so by \"the code man\" who created the simulation and enters it knowingly The Wachowskis have described Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey as a formative cinematic influence, and as a major inspiration on the visual style they aimed for when making The Matrix [149] [150] [151] Rainer Werner Fassbinders German TV Miniseries World on a Wire from 1973, an adaption of the novel Simulacron-3, served as inspirational source for some details of The Matrix, such as the transfer between the real world and the Matrix-simulation via telephone / phonebooth [citation needed] Reviewers have also commented on similarities between The Matrix and other late-1990s films such as Strange Days, Dark City and The Truman Show [122] [152] [153] [154] [155] The similarity of the film's central concept to a device in the long-running series Doctor Who has also been noted As in the film, the Matrix of that series (introduced in the 1976 serial The Deadly Assassin) is a massive computer system which one enters using a device connecting to the head, allowing users to see representations of the real world and change its laws of physics; but if killed there, they will die in reality [156] The action scenes of The Matrix were also strongly influenced by live-action films such as those of director John Woo [157] The martial arts sequences were inspired by Fist of Legend, a critically acclaimed 1995 martial arts film starring Jet Li The fight scenes in Fist of Legend led to the hiring of Yuen as fight choreographer [158] [159]\n\n\nLiterary works\nThe film makes several references to Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland [127] Comparisons have also been made to Grant Morrison's comic series The Invisibles, with Morrison describing it in 2011 as \"(it) seemed to me (to be) my own combination of ideas enacted on the screen\" [163] Comparisons have also been made between The Matrix and the books of Carlos Castaneda [164]\n\n\nPhilosophy\nIn The Matrix, a copy of Jean Baudrillard's philosophical work Simulacra and Simulation, which was published in French in 1981, is visible on-screen as \"the book used to conceal disks\", [7] [44] and Morpheus quotes the phrase \"desert of the real\" from it [173] \"The book was required reading\" [7] for the actors prior to filming [44] [174] However, Baudrillard himself said that The Matrix misunderstands and distorts his work [173] [175] Some interpreters of The Matrix mention Baudrillard's philosophy to support their claim \"that the  [film] is an allegory for contemporary experience in a heavily commercialized, media-driven society, especially in developed countries\" [7] The influence of The Matrixial Gaze, the philosophical-psychoanalytical concept of Bracha L Ettinger on the archaic matrixial space that resists the field of simulacra, [176] [177] [178] \"was brought to the public's attention through the writings of art historians such as Griselda Pollock and film theorists such as Heinz-Peter Schwerfel\" [179] [7] In addition to Baudrillard and Ettinger, the Wachowskis were also significantly influenced by Kevin Kelly's Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World, and Dylan Evans's ideas on evolutionary psychology [16]\n\n\nReligion and mythology\nAndrew Godoski sees allusions to Christ, including Neo's \"virgin birth\", his doubt in himself, the prophecy of his coming, along with many other Christian references [36] Amongst these possible allusions, it is suggested that the name of the character Trinity refers to Christianity's doctrine of the Trinity [182] It has also been noted that the character Morpheus paraphrases the Chinese Taoist philosopher Zhuangzi when he asks Neo, \"Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real? What if you were unable to wake from that dream? How would you know the difference from the real world and the dream world?\" [183]\n\n\nTransgender themes\nYears after the release of The Matrix, both of the Wachowskis came out as transgender women [184] The red pill has been compared with red estrogen pills [185] Morpheus's description of the Matrix creating a sense that something is fundamentally wrong, \"like a splinter in your mind\", has been compared to gender dysphoria [185] In the original script, Switch was a woman in the Matrix and a man in the real world, but this idea was removed [186]\n\n\nLegacy\nFollowing The Matrix, films made abundant use of slow motion, spinning cameras, and, often, the bullet time effect of a character freezing or slowing down and the camera dollying around them [80] The ability to slow down time enough to distinguish the motion of bullets was used as a central gameplay mechanic of several video games, including Max Payne, in which the feature was explicitly referred to as \"bullet time\" [190] [191] It was also the defining game mechanic of the game Superhot and its sequels The Matrix's signature special effect, and other aspects of the film, have been parodied numerous times, [26] in comedy films such as Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo (1999), [192] Scary Movie (2000), [193] Shrek (2001), [190] Kung Pow! Enter the Fist (2002), [194] Lastikman (2003); Marx Reloaded in which the relationship between Neo and Morpheus is represented as an imaginary encounter between Karl Marx and Leon Trotsky; [195]  and in video games such as Conker's Bad Fur Day [196] It also inspired films featuring a black-clad hero, a sexy yet deadly heroine, and bullets ripping slowly through the air; [26] these included Charlie's Angels (2000) featuring Cameron Diaz floating through the air while the cameras flo-mo around her; Equilibrium (2002), starring Christian Bale, whose character wore long black leather coats like Reeves' Neo; [190] Night Watch (2004), a Russian megahit heavily influenced by The Matrix and directed by Timur Bekmambetov, who later made Wanted (2008), which also features bullets ripping through air; and Inception (2010), which centers on a team of sharply dressed rogues who are able to enter other people's dreams by \"wiring in\" The original Tron (1982) paved the way for The Matrix, and The Matrix, in turn, inspired Disney to make its own Matrix with a Tron sequel, Tron: Legacy (2010) [197] Also, the film's lobby shootout sequence was recreated in the 2002 Indian action comedy Awara Paagal Deewana [198]\n\n\nFilmmaking\nFollowing The Matrix, films made abundant use of slow motion, spinning cameras, and, often, the bullet time effect of a character freezing or slowing down and the camera dollying around them [80] The ability to slow down time enough to distinguish the motion of bullets was used as a central gameplay mechanic of several video games, including Max Payne, in which the feature was explicitly referred to as \"bullet time\" [190] [191] It was also the defining game mechanic of the game Superhot and its sequels The Matrix's signature special effect, and other aspects of the film, have been parodied numerous times, [26] in comedy films such as Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo (1999), [192] Scary Movie (2000), [193] Shrek (2001), [190] Kung Pow!

The film is set in a dystopian future where humanity is unknowingly trapped within a simulated reality called the Matrix. The Matrix is a complex and thought-provoking film that combines elements of science fiction, action, and philosophy to create a unique and captivating cinematic experience.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe Matrix follows the story of Neo (played by Keanu Reeves), a computer hacker who is contacted by the resistance leader Morpheus (played by Laurence Fishburne). Morpheus reveals to Neo that the world he knows is not real, but rather a simulated reality created by intelligent machines to subdue the human population. The Matrix is a complex web of code that is designed to keep humans docile and ignorant of their true reality.\n\nNeo is initially skeptical of Morpheus' claims, but after being contacted by the Oracle (played by Gloria Foster), he decides to take the red pill and embark on a journey to understand the true nature of the Matrix. Along the way, he is trained by Morpheus and his crew to control his own mind and body, and to fight against the machines.\n\nThe Matrix features a range of innovative special effects, including \"bullet time,\" which allows the audience to see the motion of bullets in slow motion. The film also features a range of complex action sequences, including a memorable lobby shootout scene.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe Matrix features a talented cast of actors, including Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Hugo Weaving. Laurence Fishburne's performance as Morpheus is particularly notable, as he brings a sense of gravity and depth to the role.\n\n**Production**\n\nThe Matrix was filmed in Sydney, Australia, and features a range of innovative special effects.

read the script, he decided to buy rights to it and included two more pictures, Bound and The Matrix, in the contract The first movie the Wachowskis directed, Bound, then became a critical success Using this momentum, they later asked to direct The Matrix [36] Reeves said that the Matrix avatar would have been a \"different sex than the Zion reality\" in the early draft of the script, but the studio was not ready for that version [37]\n\n\nProduction\nIn 1994, the Wachowskis presented the script for the film Assassins to Warner Bros Pictures After Lorenzo di Bonaventura, the president of

\"different sex than the Zion reality\" in the early draft of the script, but the studio was not ready for that version [37]\n\n\nPre-production\nThe cast were required to be able to understand and explain The Matrix [36] French philosopher Jean Baudrillard's Simulacra and Simulation was required reading for most of the principal cast and crew [44] In early 1997, the Wachowskis had Reeves read Simulacra and Simulation, Kevin Kelly's Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World, and Dylan Evans's ideas on evolutionary psychology even before they opened up the script, [16] and eventually he was able to explain all the philosophical nuances involved [36] Moss commented that she had difficulty with this process [16]\n\n\nFilming\nAll but a few scenes were filmed at Fox Studios in Sydney, as well as in the city itself, although recognizable landmarks were not included to maintain the impression of a generic American city The filming helped establish New South Wales as a major film production center [49] [50] Filming began in March 1998 and wrapped in August 1998; principal photography took 118 days [51] Some filming also occurred at Culver Studios [52]\n\n\nSound effects and music\nDane A Davis was responsible for creating the sound effects for the film The fight scene sound effects, such as the whipping sounds of punches, were created using thin metal rods and recording them, then editing the sounds The sound of the pod containing a human body closing required almost fifty sounds put together [65]\n\n\nProduction design\nIn the film, the code that composes the Matrix itself is frequently represented as downward-flowing green characters [72] This code uses a custom typeface designed by Simon Whiteley, [42] which includes mirror images of half-width kana characters and Western Latin letters and Arabic numerals [73] In a 2017 interview at CNET, he attributed the design to his wife, who is from Japan, and added, \"I like to tell everybody that The Matrix's code is made out of Japanese sushi recipes\" [74] \"The color green reflects the green tint commonly used on early monochrome computer monitors\" [75] Lynne Cartwright, the Visual Effects Supervisor at Animal Logic, supervised the creation of the film's opening title sequence, as well as the general look of the Matrix code throughout the film, in collaboration with Lindsay Fleay and Justen Marshall [42] The portrayal resembles the opening credits of the 1995 Japanese cyberpunk film, Ghost in the Shell, which had a strong influence on the Matrix series It was also used in the subsequent films, on the related website, and in the game The Matrix: Path of Neo, and its drop-down effect is reflected in the design of some posters for the Matrix series The code received the Runner-up Award in the 1999 Jesse Garson Award for In-film typography or opening credit sequence [42]\n\n\nVisual effects\nAs for artistic inspiration for bullet time, I would credit Otomo Katsuhiro, who co-wrote and directed Akira, which definitely blew me away, along with director Michel Gondry His music videos experimented with a different type of technique called view-morphing and it was just part of the beginning of uncovering the creative approaches toward using still cameras for special effects Our technique was significantly different because we built it to move around objects that were themselves in motion, and we were also able to create slow-motion events that 'virtual cameras' could move around—rather than the static action in Gondry's music videos with limited camera moves.\n\nRelease\nThe Matrix was released on DVD and Laserdisc in its original aspect ratio of 2.39:1 on September 21, 1999, in the US from Warner Home Video as well

and Indecent Proposal simultaneously having the biggest April and Easter opening weekends [109] The film also had the second-highest opening weekend for a spring starter film, trailing behind Liar Liar [109] Three years later in 2002, The Matrix's records for having the largest April and Easter opening weekends would be taken by The Scorpion King and Panic Room respectively [110] [111] Upon its opening, it had the highest opening weekend of any 1999 film, easily topping Payback [109] Additionally, this was the biggest opening weekend for a Keanu Reeves film since Speed in 1994 [112] It would go on to rank number one at the box office during its first weekend, beating out Forces of Nature, 10 Things I Hate About You, The Out-of-Towners, Analyze This and EDtv [109] The film would remain at

film would be displaced by Entrapment [116]\n\n\nCritical response\nThe Matrix was praised by many critics, as well as filmmakers, and authors of science fiction, [11] especially for its \"spectacular action\" scenes and its \"groundbreaking special effects\" Some have described The Matrix as one of the best science fiction films of all time; [12] [13] Entertainment Weekly called The Matrix \"the most influential action movie of the generation\" [26] There have also been those, including philosopher William Irwin, who have suggested that the film explores significant philosophical and spiritual themes On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 83% based on 210 reviews, with an average score of 7.7/10 The site's critical consensus reads, \"Thanks to the Wachowskis' imaginative vision, The Matrix is a smartly crafted combination of spectacular action and groundbreaking special effects\" [10] At Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received a score of 73 based on 35 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\" [11] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale [119] It ranked 323rd among critics, and 546th among directors, in the 2012 Sight & Sound polls of the greatest films ever made [120]\n\n\nAccolades\n\n\n\nAwards and nominations\nThe Matrix is arguably the ultimate cyberpunk artifact.\n\n\nThematic analysis\nThe Matrix is arguably the ultimate cyberpunk artifact.\n\n\nFilm and television\nThe pods in which the machines keep humans have been compared to images in Metropolis, and the work of M C Escher [145] A resemblance to the eerie worlds of Swiss artist H.R Giger was also recognized [146] [147] The pods can be seen in Welcome to Paradox Episode 4 \"News from D Street\" from a 1986 short story [148] of the same name by Andrew Weiner which aired on September 7, 1998, on the SYFY Channel and has a remarkably similar concept In this episode the hero is unaware he is living in virtual reality until he is told so by \"the code man\" who created the simulation and enters it knowingly The Wachowskis have described Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey as a formative cinematic influence, and as a major inspiration on the visual style they aimed for when making The Matrix [149] [150] [151] Rainer Werner Fassbinders German TV Miniseries World on a Wire from 1973, an adaption of the novel Simulacron-3, served as inspirational source for some details of The Matrix, such as the transfer between the real world and the Matrix-simulation via telephone / phonebooth [citation needed] Reviewers have also commented on similarities between The Matrix and other late-1990s films such as Strange Days, Dark City and The Truman Show [122] [152] [153] [154] [155] The similarity of the film's central concept to a device in the long-running series Doctor Who has also been noted As in the film, the Matrix of that series (introduced in the 1976 serial The Deadly Assassin) is a massive computer system which one enters using a device connecting to the head, allowing users to see representations of the real world and change its laws of physics; but if killed there, they will die in reality [156] The action scenes of The Matrix were also strongly influenced by live-action films such as those of director John Woo [157] The martial arts sequences were inspired by Fist of Legend, a critically acclaimed 1995 martial arts film starring Jet Li The fight scenes in Fist of Legend led to the hiring of Yuen as fight choreographer [158] [159]\n\n\nLiterary works\nThe film makes several references to Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland [127] Comparisons have also been made to Grant Morrison's comic series The Invisibles, with Morrison describing it in 2011 as \"(it) seemed to me (to be) my own combination of ideas enacted on the screen\" [163] Comparisons have also been made between The Matrix and the books of Carlos Castaneda [164]\n\n\nPhilosophy\nIn The Matrix, a copy of Jean Baudrillard's philosophical work Simulacra and Simulation, which was published in French in 1981, is visible on-screen as \"the book used to conceal disks\", [7] [44] and Morpheus quotes the phrase \"desert of the real\" from it [173] \"The book was required reading\" [7] for the actors prior to filming [44] [174] However, Baudrillard himself said that The Matrix misunderstands and distorts his work [173] [175] Some interpreters of The Matrix mention Baudrillard's philosophy to support their claim \"that the  [film] is an allegory for contemporary experience in a heavily commercialized, media-driven society, especially in developed countries\" [7] The influence of The Matrixial Gaze, the philosophical-psychoanalytical concept of Bracha L Ettinger on the archaic matrixial space that resists the field of simulacra, [176] [177] [178] \"was brought to the public's attention through the writings of art historians such as Griselda Pollock and film theorists such as Heinz-Peter Schwerfel\" [179] [7] In addition to Baudrillard and Ettinger, the Wachowskis were also significantly influenced by Kevin Kelly's Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World, and Dylan Evans's ideas on evolutionary psychology [16]\n\n\nReligion and mythology\nAndrew Godoski sees allusions to Christ, including Neo's \"virgin birth\", his doubt in himself, the prophecy of his coming, along with many other Christian references [36] Amongst these possible allusions, it is suggested that the name of the character Trinity refers to Christianity's doctrine of the Trinity [182] It has also been noted that the character Morpheus paraphrases the Chinese Taoist philosopher Zhuangzi when he asks Neo, \"Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real? What if you were unable to wake from that dream? How would you know the difference from the real world and the dream world?\" [183]\n\n\nTransgender themes\nYears after the release of The Matrix, both of the Wachowskis came out as transgender women [184] The red pill has been compared with red estrogen pills [185] Morpheus's description of the Matrix creating a sense that something is fundamentally wrong, \"like a splinter in your mind\", has been compared to gender dysphoria [185] In the original script, Switch was a woman in the Matrix and a man in the real world, but this idea was removed [186]\n\n\nLegacy\nFollowing The Matrix, films made abundant use of slow motion, spinning cameras, and, often, the bullet time effect of a character freezing or slowing down and the camera dollying around them [80] The ability to slow down time enough to distinguish the motion of bullets was used as a central gameplay mechanic of several video games, including Max Payne, in which the feature was explicitly referred to as \"bullet time\" [190] [191] It was also the defining game mechanic of the game Superhot and its sequels The Matrix's signature special effect, and other aspects of the film, have been parodied numerous times, [26] in comedy films such as Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo (1999), [192] Scary Movie (2000), [193] Shrek (2001), [190] Kung Pow! Enter the Fist (2002), [194] Lastikman (2003); Marx Reloaded in which the relationship between Neo and Morpheus is represented as an imaginary encounter between Karl Marx and Leon Trotsky; [195]  and in video games such as Conker's Bad Fur Day [196] It also inspired films featuring a black-clad hero, a sexy yet deadly heroine, and bullets ripping slowly through the air; [26] these included Charlie's Angels (2000) featuring Cameron Diaz floating through the air while the cameras flo-mo around her; Equilibrium (2002), starring Christian Bale, whose character wore long black leather coats like Reeves' Neo; [190] Night Watch (2004), a Russian megahit heavily influenced by The Matrix and directed by Timur Bekmambetov, who later made Wanted (2008), which also features bullets ripping through air; and Inception (2010), which centers on a team of sharply dressed rogues who are able to enter other people's dreams by \"wiring in\" The original Tron (1982) paved the way for The Matrix, and The Matrix, in turn, inspired Disney to make its own Matrix with a Tron sequel, Tron: Legacy (2010) [197] Also, the film's lobby shootout sequence was recreated in the 2002 Indian action comedy Awara Paagal Deewana [198]\n\n\nFilmmaking\nFollowing The Matrix, films made abundant use of slow motion, spinning cameras, and, often, the bullet time effect of a character freezing or slowing down and the camera dollying around them [80] The ability to slow down time enough to distinguish the motion of bullets was used as a central gameplay mechanic of several video games, including Max Payne, in which the feature was explicitly referred to as \"bullet time\" [190] [191] It was also the defining game mechanic of the game Superhot and its sequels The Matrix's signature special effect, and other aspects of the film, have been parodied numerous times, [26] in comedy films such as Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo (1999), [192] Scary Movie (2000), [193] Shrek (2001), [190] Kung Pow!

Born William Robinson Jr., he was a founding member of the Miracles and later became a successful solo artist. With a career spanning over six decades, Robinson has written and recorded numerous hit songs, including \"Shop Around,\" \"You've Really Got a Hold on Me,\" and \"The Tears of a Clown.\"\n\n**Early Life and Early Career**\n\nWilliam Robinson Jr. was born to an African-American father and a mother of African-American and French descent in the North End area of Detroit, Michigan. He had two maternal half-sisters, and his parents divorced when he was three years old. Robinson's early life was marked by poverty, but he found solace in music and began singing in his church choir. He attended Northern High School, where he formed a doo-wop group with his friends, including Pete Moore and Ronnie White.\n\nIn 1955, Robinson and his group, the Five Chords, auditioned for Brunswick Records, but were unsuccessful. However, this rejection proved to be a turning point in Robinson's career, as he was introduced to songwriter Berry Gordy, who would later become a key figure in his success. Gordy was impressed with Robinson's vocals and his ambitious songwriting, and he began working with him on new material.\n\n**The Miracles and Motown**\n\nIn August 1957, Robinson and the Miracles met songwriter Berry Gordy after a failed audition for Brunswick Records. At that time, during the audition, Robinson had brought along with him a \"Big 10\" notebook with 100 songs he wrote while in high school. Gordy was impressed with Robinson's vocals and even more impressed with Robinson's ambitious songwriting. With his help, the Miracles released their first single, \"Got a Job,\" an answer song to the Silhouettes' hit single \"Get a Job\" on End Records. It was the beginning of a long and successful collaboration.\n\nDuring this time, Robinson attended college and started classes in January 1959, studying electrical engineering. However, he dropped out after only two months, following the Miracles' release of their first record. The group's early success was marked by a string of hit singles, including \"Shop Around,\" \"You've Really Got a Hold on Me,\" and \"Ain't It Baby.\"\n\nThe Miracles' success was also due in part to Robinson's songwriting skills. He wrote many of the group's hits, including \"The Tears of a Clown,\" which became one of their most popular songs. The song's success was a testament to Robinson's ability to craft memorable melodies and lyrics.\n\n**Solo Career**\n\nAfter a year of retirement, Robinson announced his comeback with the release of the eponymous Smokey album in 1973. The album included the Miracles tribute song, \"Sweet Harmony,\" and the hit ballad \"Baby Come Close.\" In 1974, Robinson's second album, Pure Smokey, was released but failed to produce hits.\n\nHowever, Robinson's solo career continued to thrive, and he released several successful albums in the 1970s and 1980s. One of his most successful albums was the 1980 album, Where There's Smoke, which included the hit single \"Being with You.\" The song's success was a testament to Robinson's ability to craft memorable melodies and lyrics.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nRobinson married a fellow Miracles member, Claudette Rogers, in 1959. The couple had two children: a son, Berry Robinson (born 1968), named after Motown's first label founder Berry Gordy, and a daughter, Tamla Robinson (born 1971), named after the original \"Tamla\" label set up by Gordy that would eventually become Motown.\n\n**Awards and Accolades**\n\nOn February 22, 1983, Smokey was awarded an individual star on The Hollywood Walk of Fame. Four years later, in 1987, Robinson was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Robinson's single \"Just to See Her\" from the One Heartbeat album was awarded the 1988 Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance. This was Robinson's first Grammy Award.\n\nOne year later, in 1989, he was inducted into the Songwriter's Hall of Fame. Robinson's induction into the Songwriter's Hall of Fame was a testament to his ability to craft memorable melodies and lyrics.\n\n**Discography**\n\nStudio albums:\n\n1. Smokey (1973)\n2.

they attempted to persuade Clyde to surrender to law enforcement The group ran loud, alcohol-fueled card games late into the night in the quiet neighborhood; Blanche recalled that they \"bought a case of beer a day\" [35] The men came and went noisily at all hours, and Clyde accidentally fired a Browning automatic rifle (BAR) in the apartment while cleaning it [36] No neighbors went to the house, but one reported suspicions to the Joplin Police Department.\n\n\nPlatte City\nIn July 1933, the gang checked in to the Red Crown Tourist Court [60] south of Platte City, Missouri It consisted of two brick cabins joined by garages, and the gang rented both [60] To the south stood the Red Crown Tavern, a popular restaurant among Missouri Highway Patrolmen, and the gang seemed to go out of their way to draw attention [61] Blanche registered the party as three guests, but owner Neal Houser could see five people getting out of the car He noted that the driver backed into the garage \"gangster style\" for a quick getaway [62]\n\n\nDexfield Park\nThe Barrow Gang camped at Dexfield Park, an abandoned amusement park near Dexter, Iowa, on July 24, 1933 [2] [69] Buck was sometimes semiconscious, and he even talked and ate, but his massive head wound and loss of blood were so severe that Barrow and Jones dug a grave for him [70] Residents noticed their bloody bandages, and officers determined that the campers were the Barrow Gang Local police officers and approximately 100 spectators surrounded the group, and the Barrows soon came under fire [69] Barrow, Parker, and Jones escaped on foot [2] [69] Buck was shot in the back, and he and his wife were captured by the officers Buck died of his head wound and pneumonia after surgery five days later at Kings Daughters Hospital in Perry, Iowa [69]\n\n\n1934: Final run\nOn January 16, 1934, Barrow orchestrated the escape of Hamilton, Methvin, and several others in the \"Eastham Breakout.\" [21] The brazen raid generated negative publicity for Texas, and Barrow seemed to have achieved what historian Phillips suggests was his overriding goal: revenge on the Texas Department of Corrections [notes 13]\n\n\nAmbush and deaths\nBy May 1934, Barrow had 16 warrants outstanding against him for multiple counts of robbery, auto theft, theft, escape, assault, and murder in four states [94] Hamer, who had begun tracking the gang on February 12, led the posse He had studied the gang's movements and found that they swung in a circle skirting the edges of five mid-western states, exploiting the \"state line\" rule that prevented officers from pursuing a fugitive into another jurisdiction Barrow was consistent in his movements, so Hamer charted his path and predicted where he would go The gang's itinerary centered on family visits, and they were due to see Methvin's family in Louisiana Unbeknownst to Hamer, Barrow had designated Methvin's parents' residence as a rendezvous in case they were separated Methvin had become separated from the rest of the gang in Shreveport Hamer's posse was composed of six men: Texas officers Hamer, Hinton, Alcorn, and B.M \"Maney\" Gault, and Louisiana officers Henderson Jordan and Prentiss Morel Oakley [95]\n\n\nFuneral and burial\nBonnie and Clyde wished to be buried side by side, but the Parker family would not allow it Her mother wanted to grant her final wish to be brought home, but the mobs surrounding the Parker house made that impossible [111] More than 20,000 attended Parker's funeral, and her family had difficulty reaching her gravesite [111] Parker's services were held on May 26 [108] Allen Campbell recalled that flowers came from everywhere, including some with cards allegedly from Pretty Boy Floyd and John Dillinger [108] The largest floral tribute was sent by a group of Dallas city newsboys; the sudden end of Bonnie and Clyde sold 500,000 newspapers in Dallas alone [112] Parker was buried in the Fishtrap Cemetery, although her body was moved in 1945 to the new Crown Hill Cemetery in Dallas [108]\n\n\nDiffering accounts\nThe members of the posse came from three organizations: Hamer and Gault were both former Texas Rangers then working for the Texas Department of Corrections (DOC), Hinton and Alcorn were employees of the Dallas Sheriff's office, and Jordan and Oakley were Sheriff and Deputy of Bienville Parish, Louisiana The three duos distrusted one another and kept to themselves, [120] and each had its own agenda in the operation and offered differing narratives of it Simmons, the head of the Texas DOC, brought another perspective, having effectively commissioned the posse.\n\n\nVictims\nBonnie and Clyde killed 12 people, including nine law enforcement officers, during their two years of criminal activity from February 1932 to May 1934.\n\n\nAftermath\nThe posse never received the promised bounty on the perpetrators, so they were told to take whatever they wanted from the confiscated items in their car Hamer appropriated the arsenal [132] of stolen guns and ammunition, plus a box of fishing tackle, under the terms of his compensation package with the Texas DOC [notes 15] In July, Clyde's mother Cumie wrote to Hamer asking for the return of the guns: \"You don't ever want to forget my boy was never tried in no court for murder, and no one is guilty until proven guilty by some court so I hope you will answer this letter and also return the guns I am asking for.\" [133] There is no record of any response [133]\n\n\nPersonal effects\nThe posse never received the promised bounty on the perpetrators, so they were told to take whatever they wanted from the confiscated items in their car Hamer appropriated the arsenal [132] of stolen guns and ammunition, plus a box of fishing tackle, under the terms of his compensation package with the Texas DOC [notes 15] In July, Clyde's mother Cumie wrote to Hamer asking for the return of the guns: \"You don't ever want to forget my boy was never tried in no court for murder, and no one is guilty until proven guilty by some court so I hope you will answer this letter and also return the guns I am asking for.\" [133] There is no record of any response [133]\n\n\nDeath car\nJordan attempted to keep the death car, but Ruth Warren of Topeka, Kansas, the vehicle's legal owner, sued him [137] Jordan relented and allowed her to claim it in August 1934, still covered with blood and human tissue [138] The engine still ran, despite the damage the vehicle took during the ambush Warren picked up the car in Arcadia and drove it to Shreveport, still in its gruesome state From there, she had it trucked to Topeka [139]\n\n\nGang and family members\nIn February 1935, Dallas and federal authorities arrested and tried twenty family members and friends for aiding and abetting Barrow and Parker This became known as the \"harboring trial\" and all twenty either pleaded guilty or were found guilty The two mothers were jailed for thirty days Other sentences ranged from two years' imprisonment for Floyd Hamilton, brother of Raymond, to one hour in custody for Barrow's teenage sister Marie [143] Other defendants included Blanche, Jones, Methvin, and Parker's sister Billie.\n\n\nLaw enforcement\nHamer returned to a quiet life as a freelance security consultant for oil companies According to Guinn, \"his reputation suffered somewhat after Gibsland\" [152] because many people felt that he had not given Barrow and Parker a fair chance to surrender He made headlines again in 1948 when he and Governor Coke Stevenson unsuccessfully challenged the vote total achieved by Lyndon Johnson during the election for the U.S Senate He died in 1955 at the age of 71, after several years of poor health [153] Bob Alcorn died on May 23, 1964, 30 years to the day after the Gibsland ambush [151]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nHollywood has treated the story of Bonnie and Clyde several times, including the movies The Bonnie Parker Story (1958), [155] Bonnie and Clyde (1967), [155] [156] and The Highwaymen (2019) [157] [158]\n\n\nFilms\nHollywood has treated the story of Bonnie and Clyde several times, including the movies The Bonnie Parker Story (1958), [155] Bonnie and Clyde (1967), [155] [156] and The Highwaymen (2019) [157] [158]\n\n\nMusic\nThere are many references to Bonnie and Clyde in music;

Their exploits captured the imagination of the public and have become the subject of numerous books, films, and other works of art. This article provides an overview of their lives, crimes, and ultimately, their tragic demise.\n\n## Bonnie Parker\n\n### Early Life\n\nBonnie Elizabeth Parker was born in 1910 in Rowena, Texas, the second of three children. Her father, Charles Robert Parker, died when Bonnie was four years old, leaving her mother, Emma, to raise her and her siblings on her own. The family moved to Cement City, a suburb in West Dallas, where Emma worked as a seamstress.\n\n### Writing and Relationship with Clyde\n\nAs an adult, Bonnie wrote poetry, including \"The Story of Suicide Sal\" and \"The Trail's End,\" also known as \"The Story of Bonnie and Clyde.\" She met Clyde Barrow in 1930, and they began a romantic relationship. Bonnie joined Clyde on his crime spree, often using her charm and beauty to help distract from their nefarious activities.\n\n## Clyde Barrow\n\n### Early Life\n\nClyde Chestnut Barrow was born in 1909 into a poor farming family in Ellis County, Texas. He was the fifth of seven children, and his family moved to Dallas in the early 1920s. Clyde dropped out of school in the sixth grade and worked various jobs before turning to a life of crime.\n\n### Crime Spree\n\nClyde's crime spree began in 1932, when he and Ralph Fults began robbing stores and gas stations. Their goal was to collect enough money and firepower to launch a raid against Eastham prison. After several failed attempts, Clyde was arrested and released from prison in February 1932. He and Bonnie began their infamous crime spree, which lasted for over two years.\n\n## First Meeting\n\nThe exact details of Bonnie and Clyde's first meeting are disputed, but one of the most credible accounts is that they met on January 5, 1930, at the home of Clyde's friend, Clarence Clay, in West Dallas. Clyde was 20 years old, and Bonnie was 19. They were both smitten immediately, and Bonnie joined Clyde on his crime spree.\n\n## 1932: Early Robberies and Murders\n\nIn 1932, Clyde and Bonnie began a series of armed robberies and murders. They targeted stores, gas stations, and banks, often using violence to get what they wanted. Their crimes captured the attention of the public and the press, and they became notorious figures.\n\n## 1933: Buck and Blanche Barrow Join the Gang\n\nIn March 1933, Clyde's brother Buck was released from prison, and he and his wife Blanche joined the gang. They set up housekeeping with Bonnie, Clyde, and Jones in a temporary hideout in Joplin, Missouri. The group ran loud, alcohol-fueled card games late into the night, and Clyde accidentally fired a Browning automatic rifle (BAR) in the apartment while cleaning it.\n\n## Platte City\n\nIn July 1933, the gang checked into the Red Crown Tourist Court, a small hotel south of Platte City, Missouri. They rented two brick cabins, one of which had a garage. The gang seemed to go out of their way to draw attention, and the owner, Neal Houser, noted that the driver backed into the garage \"gangster style\" for a quick getaway.\n\n## Dexfield Park\n\nOn July 24, 1933, the Barrow Gang camped at Dexfield Park, an abandoned amusement park near Dexter, Iowa. Buck was injured in a shootout with law enforcement, and the gang escaped on foot. Buck died of his head wound and pneumonia after surgery five days later.\n\n## 1934: Final Run\n\nIn January 1934, Clyde orchestrated the escape of Hamilton, Methvin, and several others in the \"Eastham Breakout.\" The brazen raid generated negative publicity for Texas, and Clyde seemed to have achieved his goal of revenge on the Texas Department of Corrections.\n\n## Ambush and Deaths\n\nBy May 1934, Clyde had 16 warrants outstanding against him for multiple counts of robbery, auto theft, theft, escape, assault, and murder in four states. A posse led by Frank Hamer tracked the gang, and on May 23, 1934, they ambushed the gang in Gibsland, Louisiana. Bonnie and Clyde were both killed in the shootout.\n\n## Funeral and Burial\n\nBonnie and Clyde wished to be buried side by side, but the Parker family would not allow it. More than 20,000 attended Bonnie's funeral, and her family had difficulty reaching her gravesite. Bonnie's services were held on May 26, and the largest floral tribute was sent by a group of Dallas city newsboys.\n\n## Differing Accounts\n\nThe members of the posse came from three organizations: Frank Hamer and M.L. Gault were both former Texas Rangers then working for the Texas Department of Corrections (DOC), while Hinton and Alcorn were employees of the Dallas Sheriff's office, and Jordan and Oakley were Sheriff and Deputy of Bienville Parish, Louisiana. Each had its own agenda in the operation and offered differing narratives of it.\n\n## Victims\n\nBonnie and Clyde killed 12 people, including nine law enforcement officers, during their two years of criminal activity from February 1932 to May 1934.\n\n## Aftermath\n\nThe posse never received the promised bounty on the perpetrators, so they were told to take whatever they wanted from the confiscated items in their car. Frank Hamer took the arsenal of stolen guns and ammunition, under the terms of his compensation package with the Texas DOC. Clyde's mother, Cumie, wrote to Hamer asking for the return of the guns, but he never responded.\n\n## Personal Effects\n\nThe posse took the death car, which was still covered with blood and human tissue. Ruth Warren of Topeka, Kansas, the vehicle's legal owner, sued Jordan for the car, and he relented, allowing her to claim it in August 1934.\n\n## Gang and Family Members\n\nIn February 1935, Dallas and federal authorities arrested and tried 20 family members and friends for aiding and abetting Bonnie and Clyde. The trial became known as the \"harboring trial,\" and all 20 either pleaded guilty or were found guilty.

they attempted to persuade Clyde to surrender to law enforcement The group ran loud, alcohol-fueled card games late into the night in the quiet neighborhood; Blanche recalled that they \"bought a case of beer a day\" [35] The men came and went noisily at all hours, and Clyde accidentally fired a Browning automatic rifle (BAR) in the apartment while cleaning it [36] No neighbors went to the house, but one reported suspicions to the Joplin Police Department.\n\n\nPlatte City\nIn July 1933, the gang checked in to the Red Crown Tourist Court [60] south of Platte City, Missouri It consisted of two brick cabins joined by garages, and the gang rented both [60] To the south stood the Red Crown Tavern, a popular restaurant among Missouri Highway Patrolmen, and the gang seemed to go out of their way to draw attention [61] Blanche registered the party as three guests, but owner Neal Houser could see five people getting out of the car He noted that the driver backed into the garage \"gangster style\" for a quick getaway [62]\n\n\nDexfield Park\nThe Barrow Gang camped at Dexfield Park, an abandoned amusement park near Dexter, Iowa, on July 24, 1933 [2] [69] Buck was sometimes semiconscious, and he even talked and ate, but his massive head wound and loss of blood were so severe that Barrow and Jones dug a grave for him [70] Residents noticed their bloody bandages, and officers determined that the campers were the Barrow Gang Local police officers and approximately 100 spectators surrounded the group, and the Barrows soon came under fire [69] Barrow, Parker, and Jones escaped on foot [2] [69] Buck was shot in the back, and he and his wife were captured by the officers Buck died of his head wound and pneumonia after surgery five days later at Kings Daughters Hospital in Perry, Iowa [69]\n\n\n1934: Final run\nOn January 16, 1934, Barrow orchestrated the escape of Hamilton, Methvin, and several others in the \"Eastham Breakout.\" [21] The brazen raid generated negative publicity for Texas, and Barrow seemed to have achieved what historian Phillips suggests was his overriding goal: revenge on the Texas Department of Corrections [notes 13]\n\n\nAmbush and deaths\nBy May 1934, Barrow had 16 warrants outstanding against him for multiple counts of robbery, auto theft, theft, escape, assault, and murder in four states [94] Hamer, who had begun tracking the gang on February 12, led the posse He had studied the gang's movements and found that they swung in a circle skirting the edges of five mid-western states, exploiting the \"state line\" rule that prevented officers from pursuing a fugitive into another jurisdiction Barrow was consistent in his movements, so Hamer charted his path and predicted where he would go The gang's itinerary centered on family visits, and they were due to see Methvin's family in Louisiana Unbeknownst to Hamer, Barrow had designated Methvin's parents' residence as a rendezvous in case they were separated Methvin had become separated from the rest of the gang in Shreveport Hamer's posse was composed of six men: Texas officers Hamer, Hinton, Alcorn, and B.M \"Maney\" Gault, and Louisiana officers Henderson Jordan and Prentiss Morel Oakley [95]\n\n\nFuneral and burial\nBonnie and Clyde wished to be buried side by side, but the Parker family would not allow it Her mother wanted to grant her final wish to be brought home, but the mobs surrounding the Parker house made that impossible [111] More than 20,000 attended Parker's funeral, and her family had difficulty reaching her gravesite [111] Parker's services were held on May 26 [108] Allen Campbell recalled that flowers came from everywhere, including some with cards allegedly from Pretty Boy Floyd and John Dillinger [108] The largest floral tribute was sent by a group of Dallas city newsboys; the sudden end of Bonnie and Clyde sold 500,000 newspapers in Dallas alone [112] Parker was buried in the Fishtrap Cemetery, although her body was moved in 1945 to the new Crown Hill Cemetery in Dallas [108]\n\n\nDiffering accounts\nThe members of the posse came from three organizations: Hamer and Gault were both former Texas Rangers then working for the Texas Department of Corrections (DOC), Hinton and Alcorn were employees of the Dallas Sheriff's office, and Jordan and Oakley were Sheriff and Deputy of Bienville Parish, Louisiana The three duos distrusted one another and kept to themselves, [120] and each had its own agenda in the operation and offered differing narratives of it Simmons, the head of the Texas DOC, brought another perspective, having effectively commissioned the posse.\n\n\nVictims\nBonnie and Clyde killed 12 people, including nine law enforcement officers, during their two years of criminal activity from February 1932 to May 1934.\n\n\nAftermath\nThe posse never received the promised bounty on the perpetrators, so they were told to take whatever they wanted from the confiscated items in their car Hamer appropriated the arsenal [132] of stolen guns and ammunition, plus a box of fishing tackle, under the terms of his compensation package with the Texas DOC [notes 15] In July, Clyde's mother Cumie wrote to Hamer asking for the return of the guns: \"You don't ever want to forget my boy was never tried in no court for murder, and no one is guilty until proven guilty by some court so I hope you will answer this letter and also return the guns I am asking for.\" [133] There is no record of any response [133]\n\n\nPersonal effects\nThe posse never received the promised bounty on the perpetrators, so they were told to take whatever they wanted from the confiscated items in their car Hamer appropriated the arsenal [132] of stolen guns and ammunition, plus a box of fishing tackle, under the terms of his compensation package with the Texas DOC [notes 15] In July, Clyde's mother Cumie wrote to Hamer asking for the return of the guns: \"You don't ever want to forget my boy was never tried in no court for murder, and no one is guilty until proven guilty by some court so I hope you will answer this letter and also return the guns I am asking for.\" [133] There is no record of any response [133]\n\n\nDeath car\nJordan attempted to keep the death car, but Ruth Warren of Topeka, Kansas, the vehicle's legal owner, sued him [137] Jordan relented and allowed her to claim it in August 1934, still covered with blood and human tissue [138] The engine still ran, despite the damage the vehicle took during the ambush Warren picked up the car in Arcadia and drove it to Shreveport, still in its gruesome state From there, she had it trucked to Topeka [139]\n\n\nGang and family members\nIn February 1935, Dallas and federal authorities arrested and tried twenty family members and friends for aiding and abetting Barrow and Parker This became known as the \"harboring trial\" and all twenty either pleaded guilty or were found guilty The two mothers were jailed for thirty days Other sentences ranged from two years' imprisonment for Floyd Hamilton, brother of Raymond, to one hour in custody for Barrow's teenage sister Marie [143] Other defendants included Blanche, Jones, Methvin, and Parker's sister Billie.\n\n\nLaw enforcement\nHamer returned to a quiet life as a freelance security consultant for oil companies According to Guinn, \"his reputation suffered somewhat after Gibsland\" [152] because many people felt that he had not given Barrow and Parker a fair chance to surrender He made headlines again in 1948 when he and Governor Coke Stevenson unsuccessfully challenged the vote total achieved by Lyndon Johnson during the election for the U.S Senate He died in 1955 at the age of 71, after several years of poor health [153] Bob Alcorn died on May 23, 1964, 30 years to the day after the Gibsland ambush [151]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nHollywood has treated the story of Bonnie and Clyde several times, including the movies The Bonnie Parker Story (1958), [155] Bonnie and Clyde (1967), [155] [156] and The Highwaymen (2019) [157] [158]\n\n\nFilms\nHollywood has treated the story of Bonnie and Clyde several times, including the movies The Bonnie Parker Story (1958), [155] Bonnie and Clyde (1967), [155] [156] and The Highwaymen (2019) [157] [158]\n\n\nMusic\nThere are many references to Bonnie and Clyde in music;

{"title": "Commonwealth_realm", "content": "\nList\nThere are currently 15 Commonwealth realms scattered across three continents (nine in North America, five in Oceania, and one in Europe), with a combined area of 18.7 million km2 (7.2 million sq mi) [note 1] (excluding the Antarctic claims which would raise the figure to 26.8 million km2 (10.3 million sq mi)) and a population of more than 150 million [5]\n\n\nInterrelationship\nThe Commonwealth realms are sovereign states They are united only in their voluntary connection with the institution of the monarchy, [1] the succession, and the King himself; the person of the sovereign and the Crown were said in 1936 to be \"the most important and vital link\" between the dominions [9] Political scientist Peter Boyce called this grouping of countries associated in this manner \"an achievement without parallel in the history of international relations or constitutional law.\" [10] Terms such as personal union, [18] a form of personal union, [note 5] [20] and shared monarchy, [21] among others, [note 6] [24] have all been advanced as definitions since the beginning of the Commonwealth itself, though there has been no agreement on which term is most accurate [26]\n\n\nCrown's role\nThe evolution of dominions into realms resulted in the Crown having a shared and a separate character, with one human equally monarch of each state and acting as such in right of a particular realm as a distinct legal person guided only by the advice of the cabinet of that jurisdiction [39] [40] [41] This means that in different contexts, the term Crown may refer to the extra-national institution associating all 15 countries, or to the Crown in each realm considered separately [note 9] In Australia, it has been suggested that the Crown is further divided, with it possible that the monarchy in each of the states is a separate institution, equal in status to each other [42] The monarchy is therefore no longer an exclusively British institution [3] [41] [28]\n\n\nSuccession and regency\nTo guarantee the continuity of multiple states sharing the same person as monarch, the preamble of the Statute of Westminster 1931 laid out a convention that any alteration to the line of succession in any one country must be voluntarily approved by the parliaments of all the realms [note 10] [45] This convention was first applied in 1936 when the British government conferred with the dominion governments during the Edward VIII abdication crisis Prime Minister of Canada William Lyon Mackenzie King pointed out that the Statute of Westminster required Canada's request and consent to any legislation passed by the British parliament before it could become part of Canada's laws and affect the line of succession in Canada [46] Sir Maurice Gwyer, first parliamentary counsel in the UK, reflected this position, stating that the Act of Settlement was a part of the law in each dominion [46] Though today the Statute of Westminster is law only in Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom, [47] the convention of approval from the other realms was reasserted by the Perth Agreement of 2011, in which all 16 realms at the time agreed in principle to change the succession rule to absolute primogeniture, to remove the restriction on the monarch being married to a Catholic, and to reduce the number of members of the Royal Family who need the monarch's permission to marry These changes came into effect on 26 March 2015 Alternatively, a Commonwealth realm may choose to cease being such by making its throne the inheritance of a different royal house or by becoming a republic, actions to which, though they alter the country's royal succession, the convention does not apply [48]\n\n\nMonarch\nThe sovereign resides in the oldest realm, the United Kingdom The king appoints viceroys to perform most of the constitutional and ceremonial duties on his behalf in the other realms: in each, a governor-general as his personal national representative, as well as a lieutenant governor as his representative in each of the Canadian provinces and governor as his representative in each of the Australian states These appointments are made on the advice of the prime minister of the country or the premier of the province or state concerned, though this process may have additional requirements [note 12] The extent to which specific additional powers are reserved exclusively for the monarch varies from realm to realm On occasions of national importance, the King may be advised to perform in person his constitutional duties, such as granting royal assent or issuing a royal proclamation Otherwise, all royal powers, including the royal prerogative, are carried out on behalf of the sovereign by the relevant viceroy In the United Kingdom, the king appoints Counsellors of State to perform his constitutional duties in his absence.\n\n\nReligion\nIt is solely in England that the King plays a role in organised religion where he acts as the Supreme Governor of the Church of England and nominally appoints its bishops and archbishops In Scotland, he swears an oath to uphold and protect the Church of Scotland and sends a Lord High Commissioner as his representative to meetings of the church's General Assembly, when he is not personally in attendance [62]\n\n\nTitles\nUntil the early part of the 20th century, the monarch's title throughout the British Empire was determined exclusively by the Parliament of the United Kingdom As the dominions gained importance, the British government began to consult their governments on how the monarch should be titled Ahead of the coronation of King Edward VII in 1902, the British Secretary of State for the Colonies, Joseph Chamberlain, suggested the King have the title King of Great Britain and Ireland and of Greater Britain Beyond the Seas Canadian officials preferred explicitly mention of the dominions: King of Great Britain and Ireland, Emperor of India, King of Canada, Australasia, South Africa and all the British Dominions Beyond the Seas, or, more simply, King of all the British Dominions Beyond the Seas The King favoured the latter suggestion, which was adopted as  [Edward VII] of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas King [63]\n\n\nFlags\nQueen Elizabeth II employed various royal standards to mark her presence, the particular one used depending on which realm she was in or acting on behalf of at the time [75] All are heraldic banners incorporating the arms for that state and, [76] save for those of the UK, were defaced in the centre with the device from the Queen's Personal Flag [76] The Queen would use that personal flag in realms where she did not have a royal standard [76] Many other members of the royal family have their own personal standards; the Prince of Wales, Princess Royal, Duke of York and Duke of Edinburgh also have one each for Canada Those without their own standard use a specific ermine-bordered banner of either the British, Scottish, or, when in or acting on behalf of Canada, Canadian royal arms [77]\n\n\nHistory\nThe possibility that a colony within the British Empire might become a new kingdom was first mooted in the 1860s, when it was proposed that the British North American territories of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and the Province of Canada unite as a confederation that might be known as the Kingdom of Canada [79] [80] [81]\n\n\nDominions emerge\nThe possibility that a colony within the British Empire might become a new kingdom was first mooted in the 1860s, when it was proposed that the British North American territories of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and the Province of Canada unite as a confederation that might be known as the Kingdom of Canada [79] [80] [81]\n\n\nBalfour Declaration of 1926\nThe pace of independence increased in the 1920s, led by Canada, which exchanged envoys with the United States in 1920 and concluded the Halibut Treaty in its own right in 1923 [83] In the Chanak crisis of 1922, the Canadian government insisted that its course of action would be determined by the Canadian parliament, [86] not the British government, and, by 1925, the dominions felt confident enough to refuse to be bound by Britain's adherence to the Treaty of Locarno [87] The Viscount Haldane said in 1919 that in Australia the Crown \"acts in self-governing States on the initiative and advice of its own ministers in these States\" [88] [83] [89]\n\n\nStatute of Westminster 1931\nThese new developments were explicitly codified in 1931 with the passage of the Statute of Westminster, through which Canada, the Union of South Africa, and the Irish Free State all immediately obtained formal legislative independence from the UK, while in the other dominions adoption of the statute was subject to ratification by the dominion's parliament Australia and New Zealand did so in 1942 and 1947, respectively, with the former's ratification back-dated to 1939, while Newfoundland never ratified the bill and reverted to direct British rule in 1934 As a result, the parliament at Westminster was unable to legislate for any dominion unless requested to do so, [83] although the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council was left available as the last court of appeal for some dominions [97] Specific attention was given in the statute's preamble to royal succession, outlining that no changes to that line could be made by the parliament of the United Kingdom or that of any dominion without the assent of all the other parliaments of the UK and dominions, an arrangement a justice of the Ontario Superior Court in 2003 likened to \"a treaty among the Commonwealth countries to share the monarchy under the existing rules and not to change the rules without the agreement of all signatories\" [98]\n\n\nDominions gain sovereignty\nAt the 1932 British Empire Economic Conference, delegates from the United Kingdom, led by Stanley Baldwin (then Lord President of the Council), [104] hoped to establish a system of free trade within the British Commonwealth, to promote unity within the British Empire and to assure Britain's position as a world power The idea was controversial, as it pitted proponents of imperial trade with those who sought a general policy of trade liberalisation with all nations The dominions, particularly Canada, were also adamantly against dispensing with their import tariffs, [105] which \"dispelled any romantic notions of a 'United Empire'.\" [104] The meeting did produce a five-year trade agreement based upon a policy, first conceived in the 1900s, [106] of Imperial Preference: the countries retained their import tariffs, but lowered these for other Commonwealth countries [105] [107]\n\n\nPost-war evolution\nWithin three years following the end of the Second World War, India, Pakistan and Ceylon became independent dominions within the Commonwealth India would soon move to a republican form of government Unlike in Ireland and Burma, there was no desire on the part of India to leave the Commonwealth, prompting a Commonwealth Conference and the London Declaration in April 1949, which entrenched the idea that republics be allowed in the Commonwealth so long as they recognised King George VI as Head of the Commonwealth and the \"symbol of the free association of its independent member nations\" [118] Pakistan became a republic in 1956.\n\n\nSecond Elizabethan era\n\n\n\nTransitions\nIn addition to the states listed above, the Dominion of Newfoundland was a dominion when the Statute of Westminster 1931 was given royal assent but effectively lost that status in 1934, without ever having assented to the Statute of Westminster, and before the term Commonwealth realm ever came into use Due to a domestic financial and political crisis, the Newfoundland legislature petitioned the UK to suspend dominion status, the UK parliament passed the Newfoundland Act 1933, and direct rule was implemented in 1934 Rather than reclaiming dominion status after the Second World War, it became a province of Canada in 1949 [132]\n\n\nRepublican referenda\nSix Commonwealth realms and dominions held referenda to consider whether they should become republics As of January 2020, of the eight held, three were successful: in Ghana, in South Africa and the second referendum in Gambia Referenda that rejected the proposal were held in Australia, twice in Tuvalu, and in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Interest in holding a second referendum was expressed in Australia in 2010 [133]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Commonwealth Realm**\n\nThe Commonwealth realms are a group of 15 independent countries that share a constitutional monarchy and a voluntary association with the institution of the monarchy. The realms are sovereign states, united only in their connection with the institution of the monarchy, the succession, and the King himself. This unique arrangement has been described as \"an achievement without parallel in the history of international relations or constitutional law.\"\n\n**List**\n\nThere are currently 15 Commonwealth realms scattered across three continents, with a combined area of approximately 18.7 million km2 (7.2 million sq mi) excluding the Antarctic claims, which would raise the figure to 26.8 million km2 (10.3 million sq mi). The population of the realms exceeds 150 million people. The realms are:\n\n1. Antigua and Barbuda\n2. Australia\n3. The Bahamas\n4. Barbados\n5. Belize\n6. Canada\n7. Grenada\n8. Jamaica\n9. New Zealand\n10. Papua New Guinea\n11. Saint Kitts and Nevis\n12. Saint Lucia\n13. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\n14. Solomon Islands\n15. United Kingdom\n\n**Interrelationship**\n\nThe Commonwealth realms are sovereign states, with their own governments, parliaments, and laws. However, they are also united in their shared monarchy, with the King serving as the head of state for each realm. This unique arrangement has been in place since the early 20th century, when the British dominions began to gain independence from the United Kingdom. The realms are associated with the institution of the monarchy, and the King's role is to serve as a symbol of national identity and unity.\n\n**Crown's Role**\n\nThe Crown has a shared and separate character, with one human equally monarch of each state and acting as such in right of a particular realm as a distinct legal person guided only by the advice of the cabinet of that jurisdiction. This means that in different contexts, the term Crown may refer to the extra-national institution associating all 15 countries, or to the Crown in each realm considered separately. The monarchy is no longer an exclusively British institution, and the realms have their own unique relationships with the Crown.\n\n**Succession and Regency**\n\nTo guarantee the continuity of multiple states sharing the same person as monarch, the preamble of the Statute of Westminster 1931 laid out a convention that any alteration to the line of succession in any one country must be voluntarily approved by the parliaments of all the realms. This convention was first applied in 1936 when the British government conferred with the dominion governments during the Edward VIII abdication crisis. The convention of approval from the other realms was reasserted by the Perth Agreement of 2011, which changed the succession rule to absolute primogeniture, removed the restriction on the monarch being married to a Catholic, and reduced the number of members of the Royal Family who need the monarch's permission to marry.\n\n**Monarch**\n\nThe sovereign resides in the oldest realm, the United Kingdom.

(7.2 million sq mi) [note 1] (excluding the Antarctic claims which would raise the figure to 26.8 million km2 (10.3 million sq mi)) and a population of more than 150 million [5]\n\n\nInterrelationship\nThe Commonwealth realms are sovereign states They are united only in their voluntary connection with the institution of the monarchy, [1] the succession, and the King himself; the person of the sovereign and the Crown were said in 1936 to be \"the most important and vital link\" between the dominions [9] Political scientist Peter Boyce called this grouping of countries associated in this manner \"an achievement without parallel in the history of international relations or constitutional law.\" [10] Terms such as personal union, [18] a form of personal union, [note 5] [20] and shared monarchy, [21] among others, [note 6] [24] have all been advanced as definitions since the beginning of the Commonwealth itself, though there has been no agreement on which term is most accurate [26]\n\n\nCrown's role\nThe evolution of dominions into realms resulted in the Crown having a shared and a separate character, with one human equally monarch of each state and acting as such in right of a particular realm as a distinct legal person guided only by the advice of the cabinet of that jurisdiction [39] [40] [41] This means that in different contexts, the term Crown may refer to the extra-national institution associating all 15 countries, or to the Crown in each realm considered separately [note 9] In Australia, it has been suggested that the Crown is further divided, with it possible that the monarchy in each of the states is a separate institution, equal in status to each other [42] The monarchy is therefore no longer an exclusively British institution [3] [41] [28]\n\n\nSuccession and regency\nTo guarantee the continuity of multiple states sharing the same person as monarch, the preamble of the Statute of Westminster 1931 laid out a

when the British government conferred with the dominion governments during the Edward VIII abdication crisis Prime Minister of Canada William Lyon Mackenzie King pointed out that the Statute of Westminster required Canada's request and consent to any legislation passed by the British parliament before it could become part of Canada's laws and affect the line of succession in Canada [46] Sir

superhero narrative, its thematic base is the Japanese mahō shōjo (magical girl) genre, with its focus on transformation sequences, a school cast, the gathering of a team of heroes, animal friends, and end-of-episode collages [13] In particular, Ladybug is strongly influenced by the genre's landmark entry Sailor Moon: Not only does the name of Marinette (\"little sailor girl\") recall Sailor Moon's title, but the main characters' magical companions reflect Sailor Moon's Luna and Artemis, the main villain's power resembles that of Queen Beryl, and the show's entire plot parallels the story

Cat Noir is a French animated television series created by Thomas Astruc. The show follows the adventures of two teenagers, Marinette Dupain-Cheng and Adrien Agreste, who transform into their superhero personas, Ladybug and Cat Noir, to save the city of Paris from various villains. The series has gained a significant following worldwide and has been praised for its unique blend of superhero and magical girl elements.\n\n**Synopsis**\n\nThe series takes place in modern-day Paris and revolves around the adventures of two teenagers, Marinette Dupain-Cheng and Adrien Agreste. When evil arises, they transform into their superhero personas, Ladybug and Cat Noir, using magical jewels known as the \"Miraculouses.\" All the while, Marinette and Adrien struggle with their feelings for each other, not knowing each other's secret identities: Marinette is in love with Adrien, but not Cat Noir, while Adrien is in love with Ladybug, but not Marinette.\n\n**Episodes**\n\nThe series is based on an original concept created by French writer and storyboarder Thomas Astruc. He was inspired by a meeting with a certain lady and \"decades of comics binge reading.\" In an interview with Nolife, Astruc said he was working as an animator on the show W.I.T.C.H when he met a woman wearing a T-shirt with a ladybug on it. They began to share drawings, some of which were ladybug-themed. Astruc also noted that Marinette's signature pigtail hairstyle was fashioned after the woman. They also worked on the cartoon A.T.O.M around 2004–05. Astruc first drew Ladybug on sticky notes and remarked about how strong the Ladybug character was. He had no memories of seeing ladybug-themed superheroes in comics.\n\n**Production**\n\nThe series is based on an original concept created by French writer and storyboarder Thomas Astruc.

{"title": "Bangladesh", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe etymology of Bangladesh (\"Bengali country\") can be traced to the early 20th century, when Bengali patriotic songs, such as Aaji Bangladesher Hridoy by Rabindranath Tagore and Namo Namo Namo Bangladesh Momo by Kazi Nazrul Islam, used the term in 1905 and 1932 respectively [28] Starting in the 1950s, Bengali nationalists used the term in political rallies in East Pakistan \n\n\nHistory\nThe history of Bangladesh dates back over four millennia to the Chalcolithic period The region's early history was characterized by a succession of Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms and empires that fought for control over the Bengal region Islam arrived in the 8th century and gradually became dominant from the early 13th century with the conquests led by Bakhtiyar Khalji in 1204 and the activities of Sunni missionaries like Shah Jalal Muslim rulers promoted the spread of Islam by building mosques across the region In 1338 Fakhruddin Mubarak Shah established independent sultanate in Bengal, establishing the capital at Sonargaon and founded an individual currency The Bengal Sultanate expanded under rulers like Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah, leading to economic prosperity and military dominance, with Bengal being referred to by Europeans as the richest country to trade with The region later became a part of the Mughal Empire By the 18th century, Mughal Bengal emerged as the wealthiest province of the empire  [38]\n\n\nGeography\nBangladesh is in South Asia on the Bay of Bengal It is surrounded almost entirely by neighbouring India, and shares a small border with Myanmar to its southeast, though it lies very close to Nepal, Bhutan, and China The country is divided into three regions Most of the country is dominated by the fertile Ganges Delta, the largest river delta in the world [59] The northwest and central parts of the country are formed by the Madhupur and the Barind plateaus The northeast and southeast are home to evergreen hill ranges.\n\n\nClimate\nStraddling the Tropic of Cancer, Bangladesh's climate is tropical, with a mild winter from October to March and a hot, humid summer from March to June The country has never recorded an air temperature below 0 °C (32 °F), with a record low of 1.1 °C (34.0 °F) in the northwest city of Dinajpur on 3 February 1905 [66] A warm and humid monsoon season lasts from June to October and supplies most of the country's rainfall Natural calamities, such as floods, tropical cyclones, tornadoes, and tidal bores occur almost every year, [67] combined with the effects of deforestation, soil degradation and erosion The cyclones of 1970 and 1991 were particularly devastating, the latter killing approximately 140,000 people [68]\n\n\nClimate change\nBangladesh is recognised to be one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change [72] [73] Over the course of a century, 508 cyclones have affected the Bay of Bengal region, 17 percent of which are believed to have made landfall in Bangladesh [74] Natural hazards that come from increased rainfall, rising sea levels, and tropical cyclones are expected to increase as the climate changes, each seriously affecting agriculture, water and food security, human health, and shelter [75] It is estimated that by 2050, a three-foot rise in sea levels will inundate some 20 percent of the land and displace more than 30 million people [76] To address the sea level rise threat in Bangladesh, the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 has been launched [77] [78]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nBangladesh is located in the Indomalayan realm, and lies within four terrestrial ecoregions: Lower Gangetic Plains moist deciduous forests, Mizoram–Manipur–Kachin rain forests, Sundarbans freshwater swamp forests, and Sundarbans mangroves [79] Its ecology includes a long sea coastline, numerous rivers and tributaries, lakes, wetlands, evergreen forests, semi evergreen forests, hill forests, moist deciduous forests, freshwater swamp forests and flat land with tall grass The Bangladesh Plain is famous for its fertile alluvial soil which supports extensive cultivation The country is dominated by lush vegetation, with villages often buried in groves of mango, jackfruit, bamboo, betel nut, coconut, and date palm [80] The country has up to 6000 species of plant life, including 5000 flowering plants [81] Water bodies and wetland systems provide a habitat for many aquatic plants Water lilies and lotuses grow vividly during the monsoon season The country has 50 wildlife sanctuaries.\n\n\nGovernment and Politics\nBangladesh is a de jure representative democracy under its constitution, with a Westminster-style parliamentary republic that has universal suffrage The head of government is the Prime Minister, who forms a government every five years The President invites the leader of the largest party in parliament to become prime minister [90]\n\n\nForeign relations\nBangladesh is considered a middle power in global politics [95] It plays an important role in the geopolitical affairs of the Indo-Pacific, [96] due to its strategic location between South and Southeast Asia [97] Bangladesh joined the Commonwealth of Nations in 1972 and the United Nations in 1974 [98] [99] It relies on multilateral diplomacy on issues like climate change, nuclear nonproliferation, trade policy and non-traditional security issues [100] Bangladesh pioneered the creation of SAARC, which has been the preeminent forum for regional diplomacy among the countries of the Indian subcontinent [101] It joined the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation in 1974, [102] and is a founding member of the Developing 8 Countries [103] In recent years, Bangladesh has focused on promoting regional trade and transport links with support from the World Bank [104] Dhaka hosts the headquarters of BIMSTEC, an organisation that brings together countries dependent on the Bay of Bengal.\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Bangladesh Armed Forces have inherited the institutional framework of the British military and the British Indian Army [121] In 2022, the active personnel strength of the Bangladesh Army was around 250,000, [122] excluding the Air Force and the Navy (24,000) [123] In addition to traditional defence roles, the military has supported civil authorities in disaster relief and provided internal security during periods of political unrest For many years, Bangladesh has been the world's largest contributor to UN peacekeeping forces The military budget of Bangladesh accounts for 1.3% of GDP, amounting to US$4.3 billion in 2021 [124] [125]\n\n\nCivil society\nSince the colonial period, Bangladesh has had a prominent civil society There are various special interest groups, including non-governmental organisations, human rights organisations, professional associations, chambers of commerce, employers' associations, and trade unions [135] The National Human Rights Commission of Bangladesh was set up in 2007 Notable human rights organisations and initiatives include the Centre for Law and Mediation, Odhikar, the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association, the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council and the War Crimes Fact Finding Committee The world's largest international NGO BRAC is based in Bangladesh There have been concerns regarding the shrinking space for independent civil society in recent years [136] [137] [138]\n\n\nHuman rights\nTorture is banned by the Constitution of Bangladesh, [139] but is rampantly used by Bangladesh's security forces Bangladesh joined the Convention against Torture in 1998 and it enacted its first anti-torture law, the Torture and Custodial Death (Prevention) Act, in 2013 The first conviction under this law was announced in 2020 [140] Amnesty International Prisoners of Conscience from Bangladesh have included Saber Hossain Chowdhury and Shahidul Alam [141] [142] The widely criticized Digital Security Act was repealed and replaced by the Cyber Security Act in 2023 [143] The repeal was welcomed by the International Press Institute [144]\n\n\nCorruption\nLike many developing countries, institutional corruption is an issue of concern for Bangladesh Bangladesh was ranked 146th among 180 countries on Transparency International's 2018 Corruption Perceptions Index [161] Land administration was the sector with the most bribery in 2015, [162] followed by education, [163] police [164] and water supply [165] The Anti Corruption Commission was formed in 2004, and it was active during the 2006–08 Bangladeshi political crisis, indicting many leading politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen for graft [166] [167] [168]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nBangladesh is divided into eight administrative divisions, [169] [63] [170] each named after their respective divisional headquarters: Barisal (officially Barishal [171]), Chittagong (officially Chattogram [171]), Dhaka, Khulna, Mymensingh, Rajshahi, Rangpur, and Sylhet.\n\n\nEconomy\nBangladesh is the second largest economy in South Asia after India [49] [50] The country has outpaced India and Pakistan in terms of per capita income [51] [50] According to the World Bank, \"when the newly independent country of Bangladesh was born on December 16, 1971, it was the second poorest country in the world—making the country's transformation over the next 50 years one of the great development stories Since then, poverty has been cut in half at record speed Enrollment in primary school is now nearly universal Hundreds of thousands of women have entered the workforce Steady progress has been made on maternal and child health And the country is better buttressed against the destructive forces posed by climate change and natural disasters Bangladesh's success comprises many moving parts—from investing in human capital to establishing macroeconomic stability Building on this success, the country is now setting the stage for further economic growth and job creation by ramping up investments in energy, inland connectivity, urban projects, and transport infrastructure, as well as focusing on climate change adaptation and disaster preparedness on its path toward sustainable growth.\" [175] Bangladesh has made one of the greatest leaps on the Human Development Index among Asian countries According to UNDP, \"Asia and the Pacific has observed the fastest Human Development Index (HDI) progress in the world—with Bangladesh being one of the best performers, moving from an HDI of 0.397 in 1990, the fourth lowest in the region, to a HDI of 0.661 in 2021 Only China had greater improvements in the region over this period\" [176]\n\n\nPrivate sector\nThe private sector accounts for 80% of GDP compared to the dwindling role of state-owned companies [190] Bangladesh's economy is dominated by family-owned conglomerates and small and medium-sized businesses Some of the largest publicly traded companies in Bangladesh include Beximco, BRAC Bank, BSRM, GPH Ispat, Grameenphone, Summit Group, and Square Pharmaceuticals [191] Capital markets include the Dhaka Stock Exchange and the Chittagong Stock Exchange Its telecommunications industry is one of the world's fastest-growing, with 172 million cellphone subscribers in January 2021 [192] Over 80% of Bangladesh's export earnings come from the garments industry [9] Other major industries include shipbuilding, pharmaceuticals, steel, ceramics, electronics, and leather goods [193] Muhammad Aziz Khan became the first person from Bangladesh to be listed as a billionaire by Forbes [194]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nSince 2009, Bangladesh has embarked on a series of megaprojects For instance, the 6.15 km long Padma Bridge was built for US$3.86 billion [196] The bridge was the first self-financed megaproject in the country's history [197] Other megaprojects include the Dhaka Metro, a mass rapid-transit system in the capital; Karnaphuli Tunnel, an underwater expressway in Chittagong; Dhaka Elevated Expressway; Chittagong Elevated Expressway; and the Bangladesh Delta Plan, designed to mitigate the impact of climate change.\n\n\nTourism\nThe tourism industry is expanding, contributing some 3.02% of total GDP [198] Bangladesh's international tourism receipts in 2019 amounted to $391 million [199] The country has three UNESCO World Heritage Sites (the Mosque City, the Paharpur Buddhist Ruins and the Sundarbans) and five tentative-list sites [200] Activities for tourists include angling, water skiing, river cruising, hiking, rowing, yachting, and beachgoing [201] [202] The World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) reported in 2019 that the travel and tourism industry in Bangladesh directly generated 1,180,500 jobs in 2018 or 1.9% of the country's total employment [203] According to the same report, Bangladesh experiences around 125,000 international tourist arrivals per year [203] Domestic spending generated 97.7 percent of direct travel and tourism gross domestic product (GDP) in 2012 [204]\n\n\nEnergy\nBangladesh is gradually transitioning to a green economy It has the largest off-grid solar power programme in the world, benefiting 20 million people [205] An electric car called the Palki is being developed for production in the country [206] Biogas is being used to produce organic fertilizer [207]\n\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the 2022 Census, Bangladesh has a population of 165.1 million, [10] and is the eighth-most-populous country in the world, the fifth-most populous country in Asia, and the most densely populated large country in the world, with a headline population density of 1,265 people/km2 as of 2020 [update] [220] Its total fertility rate (TFR), once among the highest in the world, has experienced a dramatic decline, from 5.5 in 1985 to 3.7 in 1995, down to 2.0 in 2020, [221] which is below the sub-replacement fertility of 2.1 [222] The majority of Bangladeshis live in rural areas, with only 39% of the population living in urban areas as of 2021 [update] [223] It has a median age of roughly 28 years, with 26% of the total population aged 14 or younger, [224] and merely 5% aged 65 and above [225]\n\n\nUrban centres\nBangladesh's capital Dhaka and the largest city and is overseen by two city corporations that manage between them the northern and southern parts of the city There are 12 city corporations which hold mayoral elections: Dhaka South, Dhaka North, Chittagong, Comilla, Khulna, Mymensingh, Sylhet, Rajshahi, Barisal, Rangpur, Gazipur and Narayanganj There are, however, eight divisions in total They are: Dhaka, Chittagong, Sylhet, Rangpur, Rajshahi, Khulna, Mymensingh and Barishal Mayors are elected for five-year terms Altogether there are 506 urban centres in Bangladesh which 43 cities have a population of more than 100,000.\n\n\n\nLanguage\nThe official and predominant language of Bangladesh is Bengali, which is spoken by more than 99% of the population as their native language [228] [229] Bengali is described as a dialect continuum where there are various dialects spoken throughout the country There is a diglossia in which much of the population can understand or speak in Standard Colloquial Bengali, and in their regional dialect or language [230] These include Chittagonian which is spoken in the south-eastern Chittagong region, and Sylheti spoken in the north-eastern region of Sylhet [229]\n\n\nReligion\nBangladesh was constitutionally proclaimed as a secular state in 1972 Secularism is one of its four founding constitutional principles The constitution also grants freedom of religion, while establishing Islam as the state religion [235] [236] [237] [238] The constitution bans religion-based politics and discrimination, and proclaims equal recognition of people adhering to all faiths [239] Islam is the largest religion across the country, being followed by about 91.1% of the population [219] [240] [241] The vast majority of Bangladeshi citizens are Bengali Muslims, adhering to Sunni Islam The country is the third-most populous Muslim-majority state in the world and has the fourth-largest overall Muslim population [242]\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nHealth\nBangladesh, by the constitution, guarantees healthcare services as a fundamental right to all of its citizens [257] The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is the largest institutional healthcare provider in Bangladesh, [258] and contains two divisions: Health Service Division and Medical Education And Family Welfare Division [259] However, healthcare facilities in Bangladesh are considered less than adequate, although they have improved as the economy has grown and poverty levels have decreased significantly [258] Bangladesh faces a severe health workforce crisis, as formally trained providers make up a small percentage of the total health workforce [260] Significant deficiencies in the treatment practices of village doctors persist, with widespread harmful and inappropriate drug prescribing [261]\n\n\nCulture\nThe architectural traditions of Bangladesh have a 2,500-year-old heritage [277] Terracotta architecture is a distinct feature of Bengal Pre-Islamic Bengali architecture reached its pinnacle in the Pala Empire when the Pala School of Sculptural Art established grand structures such as the Somapura Mahavihara Islamic architecture began developing under the Bengal Sultanate, when local terracotta styles influenced medieval mosque construction.\n\n\nArchitecture\nThe architectural traditions of

distinct style of domed mosques with complex niche pillars that had no minarets Mughal Bengal's most celebrated artistic tradition was the weaving of Jamdani motifs on fine muslin, which is now classified by UNESCO as an intangible cultural heritage Jamdani motifs were similar to Iranian textile art (buta motifs) and Western textile art (paisley) The Jamdani weavers in Dhaka received imperial patronage [279] Ivory and brass were also widely used in Mughal art Pottery is thoroughly used in Bengali culture.\n\n\nMuseums and libraries\nEstablished in 1910, the Varendra Research Museum is the oldest museum in Bangladesh [281] [282] It houses important collections from both the pre-Islamic and Islamic periods, including the sculptures of the Pala-Sena School of Art and the Indus Valley civilisation, and Sanskrit, Arabic, and Persian manuscripts and inscriptions [283] [284]\n\n\nLiterature\nBengali literature is a millennium-old tradition; the Charyapadas are the

"article": "**Bangladesh**\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe etymology of Bangladesh (\"Bengali country\") can be traced to the early 20th century, when Bengali patriotic songs, such as Aaji Bangladesher Hridoy by Rabindranath Tagore and Namo Namo Namo Bangladesh Momo by Kazi Nazrul Islam, used the term in 1905 and 1932 respectively. Starting in the 1950s, Bengali nationalists used the term in political rallies in East Pakistan.\n\n**History**\n\nThe history of Bangladesh dates back over four millennia to the Chalcolithic period. The region's early history was characterized by a succession of Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms and empires that fought for control over the Bengal region. Islam arrived in the 8th century and gradually became dominant from the early 13th century with the conquests led by Bakhtiyar Khalji in 1204 and the activities of Sunni missionaries like Shah Jalal. Muslim rulers promoted the spread of Islam by building mosques across the region. In 1338, Fakhruddin Mubarak Shah established independent sultanate in Bengal, establishing the capital at Sonargaon and founded an individual currency. The Bengal Sultanate expanded under rulers like Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah, leading to economic prosperity and military dominance, with Bengal being referred to by Europeans as the richest country to trade with. The region later became a part of the Mughal Empire. By the 18th century, Mughal Bengal emerged as the wealthiest province of the empire.\n\n**Geography**\n\nBangladesh is in South Asia on the Bay of Bengal. It is surrounded almost entirely by neighbouring India, and shares a small border with Myanmar to its southeast, though it lies very close to Nepal, Bhutan, and China. The country is divided into three regions. Most of the country is dominated by the fertile Ganges Delta, the largest river delta in the world. The northwest and central parts of the country are formed by the Madhupur and the Barind plateaus. The northeast and southeast are home to evergreen hill ranges.\n\n**Climate**\n\nStraddling the Tropic of Cancer, Bangladesh's climate is tropical, with a mild winter from October to March and a hot, humid summer from March to June. The country has never recorded an air temperature below 0°C (32°F), with a record low of 1.1°C (34.0°F) in the northwest city of Dinajpur on 3 February 1905. A warm and humid monsoon season lasts from June to October and supplies most of the country's rainfall. Natural calamities, such as floods, tropical cyclones, tornadoes, and tidal bores occur almost every year, combined with the effects of deforestation, soil degradation and erosion. The cyclones of 1970 and 1991 were particularly devastating, the latter killing approximately 140,000 people.\n\n**Climate Change**\n\nBangladesh is recognised to be one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. Over the course of a century, 508 cyclones have affected the Bay of Bengal region, 17 percent of which are believed to have made landfall in Bangladesh. Natural hazards that come from increased rainfall, rising sea levels, and tropical cyclones are expected to increase as the climate changes, each seriously affecting agriculture, water and food security, human health, and shelter. It is estimated that by 2050, a three-foot rise in sea levels will inundate some 20 percent of the land and displace more than 30 million people. To address the sea level rise threat in Bangladesh, the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 has been launched.\n\n**Biodiversity**\n\nBangladesh is located in the Indomalayan realm, and lies within four terrestrial ecoregions: Lower Gangetic Plains moist deciduous forests, Mizoram-Manipur-Kachin rain forests, Sundarbans freshwater swamp forests, and Sundarbans mangroves. Its ecology includes a long sea coastline, numerous rivers and tributaries, lakes, wetlands, evergreen forests, semi-evergreen forests, hill forests, moist deciduous forests, freshwater swamp forests and flat land with tall grass. The Bangladesh Plain is famous for its fertile alluvial soil which supports extensive cultivation. The country is dominated by lush vegetation, with villages often buried in groves of mango, jackfruit, bamboo, betel nut, coconut, and date palm. The country has up to 6,000 species of plant life, including 5,000 flowering plants. Water bodies and wetland systems provide a habitat for many aquatic plants. Water lilies and lotuses grow vividly during the monsoon season. The country has 50 wildlife sanctuaries.\n\n**Government and Politics**\n\nBangladesh is a de jure representative democracy under its constitution, with a Westminster-style parliamentary republic that has universal suffrage. The head of government is the Prime Minister, who forms a government every five years. The President invites the leader of the largest party in parliament to become prime minister. Bangladesh is considered a middle power in global politics, and plays an important role in the geopolitical affairs of the Indo-Pacific, due to its strategic location between South and Southeast Asia. Bangladesh joined the Commonwealth of Nations in 1972 and the United Nations in 1974. The country relies on multilateral diplomacy on issues like climate change, nuclear nonproliferation, trade policy and non-traditional security issues. Bangladesh pioneered the creation of SAARC, which has been the preeminent forum for regional diplomacy among the countries of the Indian subcontinent.\n\n**Foreign Relations**\n\nBangladesh is considered a middle power in global politics, and plays an important role in the geopolitical affairs of the Indo-Pacific, due to its strategic location between South and Southeast Asia. Bangladesh joined the Commonwealth of Nations in 1972 and the United Nations in 1974. The country relies on multilateral diplomacy on issues like climate change, nuclear nonproliferation, trade policy and non-traditional security issues. Bangladesh pioneered the creation of SAARC, which has been the preeminent forum for regional diplomacy among the countries of the Indian subcontinent. Bangladesh joined the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation in 1974, and is a founding member of the Developing 8 Countries. In recent years, Bangladesh has focused on promoting regional trade and transport links with support from the World Bank. Dhaka hosts the headquarters of BIMSTEC, an organisation that brings together countries dependent on the Bay of Bengal.\n\n**Military**\n\nThe Bangladesh Armed Forces have inherited the institutional framework of the British military and the British Indian Army. In 2022, the active personnel strength of the Bangladesh Army was around 250,000, excluding the Air Force and the Navy (24,000). In addition to traditional defence roles, the military has supported civil authorities in disaster relief and provided internal security during periods of political unrest. For many years, Bangladesh has been the world's largest contributor to UN peacekeeping forces. The military budget of Bangladesh accounts for 1.3% of GDP, amounting to US$4.3 billion in 2021.\n\n**Civil Society**\n\nSince the colonial period, Bangladesh has had a prominent civil society. There are various special interest groups, including non-governmental organisations, human rights organisations, professional associations, chambers of commerce, employers' associations, and trade unions. The National Human Rights Commission of Bangladesh was set up in 2007. Notable human rights organisations and initiatives include the Centre for Law and Mediation, Odhikar, the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association, the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council and the War Crimes Fact Finding Committee. The world's largest international NGO BRAC is based in Bangladesh. There have been concerns regarding the shrinking space for independent civil society in recent years.\n\n**Human Rights**\n\nTorture is banned by the Constitution of Bangladesh, but is rampantly used by Bangladesh's security forces. Bangladesh joined the Convention against Torture in 1998 and it enacted its first anti-torture law, the Torture and Custodial Death (Prevention) Act, in 2013. The first conviction under this law was announced in 2020. Amnesty International Prisoners of Conscience from Bangladesh have included Saber Hossain Chowdhury and Shahidul Alam. The widely criticized Digital Security Act was repealed and replaced by the Cyber Security Act in 2023. The repeal was welcomed by the International Press Institute.\n\n**Corruption**\n\nLike many developing countries, institutional corruption is an issue of concern for Bangladesh. Bangladesh was ranked 146th among 180 countries on Transparency International's 2018 Corruption Perceptions Index. Land administration was the sector with the most bribery in 2015, followed by education, police, and water supply. The Anti Corruption Commission was formed in 2004, and it was active during the 2006–08 Bangladeshi political crisis, indicting many leading politicians, bureaucrats, and businessmen for graft.\n\n**Administrative Divisions**\n\nBangladesh is divided into eight administrative divisions, each named after their respective divisional headquarters: Barisal (officially Barishal), Chittagong (officially Chattogram), Dhaka, Khulna, Mymensingh, Rajshahi, Rangpur, and Sylhet.\n\n**Economy**\n\nBangladesh is the second-largest economy in South Asia after India. The country has outpaced India and Pakistan in terms of per capita income. According to the World Bank, \"when the newly independent country of Bangladesh was born on December 16, 1971, it was the second-poorest country in the world—making the country's transformation over the next 50 years one of the great development stories. Since then, poverty has been cut in half at record speed. Enrollment in primary school is now nearly universal. Hundreds of thousands of women have entered the workforce. Steady progress has been made on maternal and child health. And the country is better buttressed against the destructive forces posed by climate change and natural disasters.\" Bangladesh has made one of the greatest leaps on the Human Development Index among Asian countries. According to UNDP, \"Asia and the Pacific has observed the fastest Human Development Index (HDI) progress in the world—with Bangladesh being one of the best performers, moving from an HDI of 0.397 in 1990, the fourth lowest in the region, to a HDI of 0.661 in 2021. Only China had greater improvements in the region over this period.\"\n\n**Private Sector**\n\nThe private sector accounts for 80% of GDP compared to the dwindling role of state-owned companies. Bangladesh's economy is dominated by family-owned conglomerates and small and medium-sized businesses. Some of the largest publicly traded companies in Bangladesh include Beximco, BRAC Bank, BSRM, GPH Ispat, Grameenphone, Summit Group, and Square Pharmaceuticals. Capital markets include the Dhaka Stock Exchange and the Chittagong Stock Exchange. Its telecommunications industry is one of the world's fastest-growing, with 172 million cellphone subscribers in January 2021. Over 80% of Bangladesh's export earnings come from the garments industry. Other major industries include shipbuilding, pharmaceuticals, steel, ceramics, electronics, and leather goods. Muhammad Aziz Khan became the first person from Bangladesh to be listed as a billionaire by Forbes.\n\n**Infrastructure**\n\nSince 2009, Bangladesh has embarked on a series of megaprojects. For instance, the 6.15 km long Padma Bridge was built for US$3.86 billion. The bridge was the first self-financed megaproject in the country's history. Other megaprojects include the Dhaka Metro, a mass rapid-transit system in the capital; Karnaphuli Tunnel, an underwater expressway in Chittagong; Dhaka Elevated Expressway; Chittagong Elevated Expressway; and the Bangladesh Delta Plan, designed to mitigate the impact of climate change.\n\n**Tourism**\n\nThe tourism industry is expanding, contributing some 3.02% of total GDP. Bangladesh's international tourism receipts in 2019 amounted to $391 million. The country has three UNESCO World Heritage Sites (the Mosque City, the Paharpur Buddhist Ruins and the Sundarbans) and five tentative-list sites. Activities for tourists include angling, water skiing, river cruising, hiking, rowing, yachting, and beachgoing. The World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) reported in 2019 that the travel and tourism industry in Bangladesh directly generated 1,180,500 jobs in 2018 or 1.9% of the country's total employment. According to the same report, Bangladesh experiences around 125,000 international tourist arrivals per year. Domestic spending generated 97.7 percent of direct travel and tourism gross domestic product (GDP) in 2012.\n\n**Energy**\n\nBangladesh is gradually transitioning to a green economy. The country has the largest off-grid solar power programme in the world, benefiting 20 million people. An electric car called the Palki is being developed for production in the country. Biogas is being used to produce organic fertilizer.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nAccording to the 2022 Census, Bangladesh has a population of 165.1 million, making it the eighth-most-populous country in the world, the fifth-most populous country in Asia, and the most densely populated large country in the world, with a headline population density of 1,265 people/km2 as of 2020. Its total fertility rate (TFR), once among the highest in the world, has experienced a dramatic decline, from 5.5 in 1985 to 3.7 in 1995, down to 2.0 in 2020, which is below the sub-replacement fertility of 2.1. The majority of Bangladeshis live in rural areas, with only 39% of the population living in urban areas as of 2021. It has a median age of roughly 28 years, with 26% of the total population aged 14 or younger, and merely 5% aged 65 and above.\n\n**Urban Centres**\n\nBangladesh's capital Dhaka and the largest city is overseen by two city corporations that manage between them the northern and southern parts of the city. There are 12 city corporations which hold mayoral elections: Dhaka South, Dhaka North, Chittagong, Comilla, Khulna, Mymensingh, Sylhet, Rajshahi, Barisal, Rangpur, Gazipur, and Narayanganj. There are, however, eight divisions in total. They are: Dhaka, Chittagong, Sylhet, Rangpur, Rajshahi, Khulna, Mymensingh, and Barishal. Mayors are elected for five-year terms. Altogether there are 506 urban centres in Bangladesh, which 43 cities have a population of more than 100,000.\n\n**Language**\n\nThe official and predominant language of Bangladesh is Bengali, which is spoken by more than 99% of the population as their native language. Bengali is described as a dialect continuum where there are various dialects spoken throughout the country. There is a diglossia in which much of the population can understand or speak in Standard Colloquial Bengali, and in their regional dialect or language. These include Chittagonian, which is spoken in the south-eastern Chittagong region, and Sylheti, spoken in the north-eastern region of Sylhet.\n\n**Religion**\n\nBangladesh was constitutionally proclaimed as a secular state in 1972. Secularism is one of its four founding constitutional principles. The constitution also grants freedom of religion, while establishing Islam as the state religion. Islam is the largest religion across the country, being followed by about 91.1% of the population. The vast majority of Bangladeshi citizens are Bengali Muslims, adhering to Sunni Islam. The country is the third-most populous Muslim-majority state in the world and has the fourth-largest overall Muslim population.\n\n**Culture**\n\nBengali culture has a rich and diverse heritage, with a history dating back over 2,000 years. The written history of Bengali culture begins with the Pala Empire in the 8th century. Bengali literature is a millennium-old tradition; the Charyapadas are the earliest examples of Bengali poetry. Sufi spiritualism inspired many Bengali Muslim writers during the medieval period. The Bengal Renaissance shaped modern Bengali literature, including novels, short stories, and science fiction. Rabindranath Tagore was the first non-European laureate of the Nobel Prize in Literature and is described as the Bengali Shakespeare. Kazi Nazrul Islam was a revolutionary poet who espoused political rebellion against colonialism and fascism. Begum Rokeya is regarded as the pioneer feminist writer of Bangladesh.\n\n**Sports**\n\nIn rural Bangladesh, several traditional indigenous sports such as Kabaddi, Boli Khela, Lathi Khela, and Nouka Baich remain fairly popular. While Kabaddi is the national sport, cricket is the most popular sport in the country. The national cricket team participated in their first Cricket World Cup in 1999 and the following year was granted Test cricket status. Bangladesh reached the quarter-final of the 2015 Cricket World Cup, the semi-final of the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy, and they reached the final of the Asia Cup three times – in 2012, 2016, and 2018. Shakib Al Hasan is widely regarded as one of the greatest All-rounders in the history of Cricket and as one of the greatest Bangladeshi sportsman ever.\n\n**See Also**\n\nGovernment and

Russell, who had initially been attached to the project but dropped out due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nWahlberg, who is a devout Catholic, was deeply moved by Long's story and felt compelled to bring it to the big screen. He has stated that \"Father Stu's story is a message that we can all improve, and work towards being better people, and help where we can.\" The film's production involved Long's parents, as well as numerous friends, neighbors, parishioners, and clergy, who shared their experiences and insights into Long's life.\n\n\"Father Stu\" was theatrically released on April 13, 2022, during Holy Week, and grossed $21.6 million on a budget of $4 million.

instead, a deliberately similar name, Belegurth, meaning \"Great Death\", is employed [T 4] Another form of his name is Melko, simply meaning \"Mighty One\" [T 1]\n\n\nFictional history\nBefore the creation of Eä and Arda (The Universe and the World), Melkor is the most powerful of the Ainur, the \"angelic beings\" created by Eru Ilúvatar Melkor, dissatisfied that Eru had abandoned the Void, seeks to emulate his creator and fill the Void with sentient beings This, however, requires the Flame Imperishable, the Secret Fire, which belongs to Eru alone; Melkor cannot find it He contends with Eru in the Music of the Ainur, introducing themes of his own [T 8] He draws many weaker-willed Ainur to him Ironically, these attempts do not truly subvert the Music, but elaborate Eru's original intentions: the Music of Eru takes on depth and beauty through the strife and sadness Melkor's disharmonies introduce Unlike Aulë, Melkor is too proud to admit that his creations are made possible entirely by Eru Instead, Melkor aspires to rival Eru [T 8]\n\n\nAinulindalë and Valaquenta\nBefore the creation of Eä and Arda (The Universe and the World), Melkor is the most powerful of the Ainur, the \"angelic beings\" created by Eru Ilúvatar Melkor, dissatisfied that Eru had abandoned the Void, seeks to emulate his creator and fill the Void with sentient beings This, however, requires the Flame Imperishable, the Secret Fire, which belongs to Eru alone;

the lesser, the Maiar, act as their followers and assistants They set about the ordering of the universe and Arda within it, as they understand the themes of Eru Melkor and his followers enter Eä as well, but he is frustrated that his colleagues do not recognize him as leader of the new realm, despite his great knowledge In anger and shame, Melkor sets about ruining and undoing whatever the others do [T 13]\n\n\nChildren of Húrin\nIn this more complete version of a story summarized in Quenta Silmarillion, Húrin and his younger brother Huor are leaders of the House of Hador, one of the three kindred of elf-friends At Nírnaeth Arnoediad they cover the escape of Turgon to Gondolin by sacrificing their army and themselves Huor is slain, but Húrin is brought before Morgoth alive As revenge for his aid to Turgon and his defiance, Morgoth curses Húrin and his children, binding Húrin to a seat upon Thangorodrim and forcing him to witness all that happens (using Morgoth's long sight) to his children in the succeeding years The encounter with Húrin, is set out in more detail than in The Silmarillion, and in a more connected narrative than in Unfinished Tales It gives the first allusion to the corruption of Men by Morgoth soon after their awakening, and the assertion by Morgoth of his power over the entire Earth through \"the shadow of my purpose\" [T 26]\n\n\nThe Lord of the Rings\nMelkor is mentioned briefly in the chapter \"A Knife in the Dark\" in The Lord of the Rings, where Aragorn sings the story of Tinúviel and briefly recounts the role of Morgoth (\"the Great Enemy\") in the wider history of the Silmarils [T 27]\n\n\nDevelopment\nIn the early versions of Tolkien's stories, Melkor/Morgoth is not seen as the most powerful of the Valar He is described as being equal in power to Manwë, chief of the Valar in Arda [T 28] But his power increases in later revisions of the story until he becomes the most powerful among them, [T 29] and in a late essay more powerful than all of the other Valar combined He develops from a standout among equals into a being so powerful that the other created beings could not utterly defeat him [T 30]\n\n\nInterpretation\nMelkor has been interpreted as analogous to Satan, once the greatest of all God's angels, Lucifer, but fallen through pride; he rebels against his creator [2] Tolkien wrote that of all the deeds of the Ainur, by far the worst was \"the absolute Satanic rebellion and evil of Morgoth and his satellite Sauron\" [T 34] John R Holmes, writing in The J R R Tolkien Encyclopedia, suggests that Melkor's nature resonates with John Milton's fallen angel (Satan) in Paradise Lost [3] Melkor creates an \"iron hell\" for his elven slave labourers His greed for ever more power makes him a symbol for the despotism of modern machinery [4] The Tolkien scholar Brian Rosebury comments that there is a clear mapping to the Christian myth, with Eru as God, Ainur as angels, and Melkor as Satan; but that the differences are equally striking, as creation is in part mediated by the Ainur [5] His rebellion against Eru is creative, as Melkor is impatient for the void of the world to be filled with things But his creativity becomes destructive, as it is tainted with pride \"His desire to create other beings for his glory\" turns into a desire for servants and slaves to follow his own will This \"temptation of creativity\" is echoed in Tolkien's work by Melkor's opponent Fëanor, who is prepared to fight a hopeless war to try to regain his prized creations, the Silmarils [6] The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey writes that The Silmarillion is most obviously a calque on the Book of Genesis (whereas Tolkien's Shire is a calque upon England) Shippey quotes Tolkien's friend C S Lewis, who stated that even Satan was created good; [1] Tolkien has the character Elrond in The Lord of the Rings say \"For nothing is evil in the beginning Even  [the Dark Lord] Sauron was not so.\" [5] [T 35] Shippey concludes that the reader is free to assume \"that the exploit of Morgoth of which the Eldar  [Elves] never learnt was the traditional seduction of Adam and Eve by the  [Satanic] serpent\", while the Men in the story are Adam's descendants \"flying from Eden and subject to the curse of Babel\" [1]\n\n\nSatanic figure\nMelkor has been interpreted as analogous to Satan, once the greatest of all God's angels, Lucifer, but fallen through pride;

for the Dark Lord Sauron, with his single eye; for the corrupted white wizard Saruman, cloaked and hatted like Gandalf, but with far-flying birds like Odin's eagles and ravens In The Silmarillion, too, the farseeing Vala Manwë, who lives on the tallest of the mountains, and loves \"all swift birds, strong of wing\", is Odinesque And just as Sauron and Saruman oppose Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings, so the enemy Morgoth gets Odin's negative characteristics: \"his ruthlessness, his destructiveness, his malevolence, his all-pervading deceit\" Burns compares this allocation to the way that Norse myth allots some of Odin's characteristics to the troublemaker god Loki Odin has many names, among them \"Shifty-eyed\" and \"Swift in Deceit\", and he is equally a god of the Norse underworld, \"Father of the Slain\" She notes that Morgoth, too, is named \"Master of Lies\" and \"Demon of Dark\", and functions as a fierce god of battle [7]\n\n\nEmbodiment of possessiveness\nThe Tolkien scholar Verlyn Flieger, discussing the splintering of the original created light of Middle-earth, likens Melkor/Morgoth's response to the Silmarils to that of Fëanor, who had created those jewels She states that the central temptation is the desire to possess, and that possessiveness itself is the \"great transgression\" in Tolkien's created world She observes that the commandment \"Love not too well the work of thy hands and the devices of thy heart\" is stated explicitly in The Silmarillion Flieger compares Tolkien's descriptions of the two characters: \"the heart of Fëanor was fast bound to these things that he himself had made\", followed at once by \"Melkor lusted for the Silmarils, and the very memory of their radiance was a gnawing fire in his heart\" She writes that it is appropriately ironic that Melkor and Fëanor, one the greatest of the Ainur, the other the most subtle and skilful of the creative Noldor among the Elves – should \"usher in the darkness\" [8]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nPrimary\n\n\nSecondary\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Revolution_of_Dignity", "content": "\nPrelude\nSuccessive Ukrainian governments in the 2000s sought a closer relationship with the European Union (EU) [51] [52] The government of President Viktor Yanukovych had been negotiating an association agreement with the European Union since 2012 [53] Such a comprehensive trade agreement with the EU would have impacted Ukraine's trade agreements with Russia, the latter being Ukraine's biggest trade partner at the time [54] Yanukovych believed that the complications could be addressed, and he said that he intended to enter the agreement, [55] but continued to postpone [56] This was interpreted as an attempt to back out of signing this agreement, and led to a wave of protests which came to be known as the \"Euromaidan\" movement [57]\n\n\nOverview\nThe protests that began on the night of 21 November 2013 in Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square) in Kyiv were still ongoing by mid-February 2014 [2] [1]\n\n\nDetailed timeline\nThe night before the clashes, Right Sector called on all of its members to ready themselves for a \"peace offensive\" on 18 February The Maidan People's Union also urged all concerned citizens to take part in the \"peace offensive\", which student unions had agreed to join as well The Maidan Union reported on the morning of 18 February that columns of protesters would begin a march on parliament at 08:30 [84]\n\n\n18 February 2014\nThe night before the clashes, Right Sector called on all of its members to ready themselves for a \"peace offensive\" on 18 February The Maidan People's Union also urged all concerned citizens to take part in the \"peace offensive\", which student unions had agreed to join as well The Maidan Union reported on the morning of 18 February that columns of protesters would begin a march on parliament at 08:30 [84]\n\n\nProtest march and initial clashes\nThe night before the clashes, Right Sector called on all of its members to ready themselves for a \"peace offensive\" on 18 February The Maidan People's Union also urged all concerned citizens to take part in the \"peace offensive\", which student unions had agreed to join as well The Maidan Union reported on the morning of 18 February that columns of protesters would begin a march on parliament at 08:30 [84]\n\n\nAttack on Maidan\nFollowing the warning, the police advanced on thousands of protesters on Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square) with guns, a water cannon, and an armored personnel carrier Tents housing protesters were burned in the main square [68] The police justified their actions as part of an anti-terror campaign against \"individuals who had clearly armed themselves\" [99] Opposition leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk called on the police to retreat 200 meters up Instytutska Street and urged both sides to call a truce until morning [22] Protesters on the square stacked tires and other burning debris to create a wall of fire between themselves and security forces [22]\n\n\nOpposition leaders meeting with Yanukovych\nEmerging from a meeting with President Yanukovych, opposition leader Vitali Klitschko told Hromadske TV that the talks had not been successful Klitschko said that opposition leaders had listened for more than an hour to Yanukovych's claims that they were to blame for the 20 deaths on 18 February The president also demanded that the opposition force the protesters to leave Maidan Nezalezhnosti [22] He reportedly threatened opposition leaders with criminal prosecution [103]\n\n\n19 February\nThe Kyiv Metro was closed and main roads blocked by police [107] Bigger stores and malls on Khreshchatyk were also closed, but according to a Euronews correspondent, \"Life away from the barricades is business as usual.\" [108]\n\n\n20 February\nAt 00:35, Interfax reported that Yanukovych had declared 20 February a day of mourning for those killed in the clashes [125]\n\n\nDiplomatic efforts\nThe above-mentioned clashes erupted shortly before three visiting EU foreign ministers—Radosław Sikorski of Poland, Laurent Fabius of France, and Frank-Walter Steinmeier of Germany—were due to meet with President Yanukovych to push for a compromise with the Ukrainian opposition [153] [154] The meeting was delayed for security reasons and began an hour late [153] Before the meeting, Fabius said in an interview with BFM TV: \"Our purpose is to cause the Ukrainian administration to conduct elections There is no solution other than elections.\" [155] The negotiations lasted six hours [156] Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland told reporters soon afterward, \"It was agreed with Yanukovych that there was a willingness to hold early elections this year, both presidential and parliamentary.\" Tusk also said that Yanukovych \"was willing to form a national unity government in the next 10 days and to change the constitution before the summer\" Further talks were scheduled to negotiate the signing of the relevant document [157]\n\n\nUkrainian political developments\nThe leader of the ruling Party of Regions, Oleksandr Yefremov, travelled to Luhansk to meet with local leaders and law enforcement agents to discuss the possibility of southeastern Ukraine's declaring independence and seceding from the state [162] [nb 1] The chairman of the Supreme Council of Crimea, Vladimir Konstantinov, travelled to Moscow, where he announced that the Autonomous Republic of Crimea would secede from Ukraine if there were a change of power [165] [166]\n\n\n21 February\nThe Armed Forces' deputy chief of staff, Lieutenant-General Yuri Dumansky, resigned because he disagreed with the involvement of the army in the conflict [184] \"Today the army is being involved in the civil conflict, which could lead to the mass deaths of civilians and soldiers,\" he said [185] At around midnight, journalist Artem Shevchenko, referring to his sources in the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, announced that 10 BTRs had departed from Kozacha Bay (Cossack Bay), where the Black Sea Fleet of Russia is based, escorted by DAI (Road Auto Inspection) vehicles [186] According to Shevchenko, 1,500 airborne soldiers and 400 marines—including the 25th Airborne Brigade, the 1st Marine Brigade, the 831st Anti-sabotage Unit, and the 2nd Marine Spetsnaz—had been transferred on 20 February under the command of the SBU for the anti-terrorist operation [187]\n\n\nAgreement on settlement of political crisis\nA compromise deal was agreed to on 21 February after hours of negotiations led by the European Union mediators and Foreign Ministers Radosław Sikorski of Poland, Laurent Fabius of France, and Frank-Walter Steinmeier of Germany [192] [193] Officially called the Agreement on settlement of political crisis in Ukraine, but unofficially called the 21 February Agreement, it was signed by both opposition leaders and the president after overnight negotiations (read the full text of the agreement here) [194] The agreed-to provisions included a restoration of the constitution as it was between 2004 and 2010; constitutional reform to be completed by September; early presidential elections no later than December 2014; an investigation into the violence conducted under joint monitoring of the administration, the opposition, and the Council of Europe; a veto on imposing a state of emergency; amnesty for protesters arrested since 17 February; the surrender of public buildings occupied by protesters; the forfeiture of illegal weapons; \"new electoral laws\", and the formation of a new Central Election Commission [195] [196] The three EU foreign ministers signed the document as witnesses, [197] but not the Russian mediator Vladimir Lukin, because he had no mandate to sign an agreement on the crisis [198] [199]\n\n\nAgreement aftermath\nRight Sector leader Dmytro Yarosh rejected the agreement, saying, \"We have to state the obvious fact that the criminal regime had not yet realised either the gravity of its evil doing.\" He noted that the agreement did not include provisions for the arrest of Interior Minister Zakharchenko; the punishing of Berkut commanders alleged to have been involved in the murder of civilians; the removal of the general prosecutor and defence minister; a ban on the Party of Regions and Communist Party; and guarantees of safety for those involved in the opposition He called for the \"people's revolution\" to continue until power had been completely removed from the governing authorities [185] Euromaidan leader Andriy Parubiy insisted that elections be held as soon as possible and reiterated that one of the main demands of protesters had been the resignation of President Yanukovych [203] AutoMaidan also announced that it would not accept anything short of Yanukovych's resignation [204]\n\n\nRemoval of Yanukovych\nOn 22 February, Yanukovych could not be found, [by whom?] and parliament were not informed of his whereabouts [214] There were unconfirmed media reports that he had flown to Kharkiv (the governor of Kharkiv Oblast at the time, Mykhailo Dobkin, later said Yanukovych was in Kharkiv that day [79]) It was announced that most of the ministers had disappeared, including Interior Minister Zakharchenko, who was reported to have fled to Belarus [215]\n\n\nDisappearance and prosecution\nFollowing the parliamentary procedures to transfer power to the new provisional government, General Prosecutor Pshonka and Minister of Revenues and Duties Oleksandr Klymenko were stopped at the Russian border while trying to flee the country According to the State Border Service, Yanukovych also tried to flee via a charter flight from Donetsk, but was stopped by border guards The guards were \"met by a group of armed men who offered money for flying without the proper clearance\" Yanukovych then left by armored car, and his subsequent whereabouts were unknown [223] Former Interior Minister Zakharchenko also tried to fly out of Donetsk and was similarly turned back [224]\n\n\nAftermath\nOn 22 February 2014, Yulia Tymoshenko was released from prison and addressed more than 100,000 people on Independence Square [233] The same day, parliament appointed Arsen Avakov as acting interior minister [234] Lawmakers also ousted Viktor Pshonka as general prosecutor of Ukraine in a no-confidence vote [235]\n\n\nNew government\nOn 22 February 2014, Yulia Tymoshenko was released from prison and addressed more than 100,000 people on Independence Square [233] The same day, parliament appointed Arsen Avakov as acting interior minister [234] Lawmakers also ousted Viktor Pshonka as general prosecutor of Ukraine in a no-confidence vote [235]\n\n\nJuridical developments\nOn 24 February, parliament decided to release all political prisoners, including the father and son in the Pavlichenko criminal case [255] Parliament also terminated the powers of five judges of the Constitutional Court of Ukraine, appointed from parliament's quota, for violating their oath [256] Lawmakers also offered to dismiss, for the same reason, two judges appointed by the president of Ukraine, and called on the Council of Judges of Ukraine to convene an extraordinary congress within three days to consider dismissing five Constitutional Court judges appointed by the council In the same resolution, parliament assigned the prosecutor general of Ukraine to begin criminal proceedings against all judges who, in the opinion of the People's Deputies of Ukraine, were guilty of adopting on 30 September 2010 a decision of the Constitutional Court of Ukraine (No 20-rp/2010) on the procedure of introducing constitutional amendments On 27 February, judges of the Constitutional Court sent a letter to European organizations, international organizations, and human rights institutions questioning the constitutionality of the parliamentary resolution [257]\n\n\nYanukovych press conference and Russian response\nOn 28 February, Yanukovych attended a press conference in southern Russia and answered questions from mostly Russian reporters He said that the early presidential elections scheduled for late May were illegal and that he \"would not be participating in them\" He also said that while 21 February agreement could have calmed the situation, the opposition had not agreed to it [261]\n\n\nBan on Russian state TV\nOn 11 March the Ukrainian National Council for TV and Radio Broadcasting  [uk; ru] instructed all cable operators to stop transmitting a number of Russian channels, including the international versions of the main state-controlled stations—Rossiya 1, Channel One, and NTV—as well as Rossiya 24 [269]\n\n\nLustration\nOn 26 February, Ehor Sobolev was nominated to lead the Committee on Lustration in the new Yatsenyuk government [270] Months later, on 14 August 2014, parliament adopted a bill that established \"procedures for conducting checks of government officials and people nominated for government position with the purpose of deciding whether they meet certain criteria for occupying relevant post\" [271] [272]\n\n\nBerkut dissolved\nOn 25 February, acting Interior Minister Avakov signed a decree dissolving the Berkut [275] In March, Russia announced that the Crimean Berkut unit would preserve its name as it was incorporated into the Russian Interior Ministry [276] [nb 4]\n\n\nProtests against the revolution\nFollowing the ousting of Yanukovych, pro-Russian, counter-revolutionary protests began in southern in eastern Ukraine According to Cathy Young, in the Antimaidan protests against the revolution, street posters, Internet posts, and even speeches at rallies attacked the new government as a \"Jewish clique\" seeking to use Ukrainians to defend the interests of wealthy Jews, and depicted the revolution as a \"Zionist coup.\" [279]\n\n\nRussian occupation of Crimea\nWhile Russian propaganda characterizes Euromaidan as a coup, the actual military coup was performed by Russia in Ukrainian Crimea on the 27th February 2014, when Russian military seized Crimean parliament and government buildings and replaced Ukrainian elected officials with Russian-controlled figures [42] [301] [44]\n\n\nDestruction of Soviet monuments\nThe monument to the Russian field marshal Mikhail Kutuzov was demolished in the city of Brody in western Ukraine [302] In addition, a statue honouring Soviet soldiers was removed from the western Ukrainian city of Stryi [303] [304]\nIn early December 2013, unknown activists partially painted in red and black (similar to the flag of the nationalistic Ukrainian Insurgent Army) a statue honouring the workers of the Arsenal factory in Kyiv who died in 1918 [305]\nOn 28 February, a monument dedicated to Soviet forces who fought in World War II and one dedicated to Soviet soldiers who fought in Afghanistan, both in the city of Dnipropetrovsk, were vandalized and painted with nationalistic slogans.\n [306]\nOn its English-language Twitter account, the Russian Foreign Ministry described the targeting of Russian- and Soviet-built monuments as \"Russophobic vandalism\" and an \"outrage\", and demanded that it be stopped [307]\n\n\nSports\nOn 19 February 2014, UEFA announced that it had decided to change the venue of the 2013–14 UEFA Europa League Round of 32 match between Dynamo Kyiv and Valencia from Olympic Stadium in Kyiv to GSP Stadium, in Nicosia, Cyprus, because of the riots in Kyiv [308] [309] [310]\n\n\nPublic opinion\nA December 2016 survey of 2,040 Ukrainians by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found that 56 percent of respondents throughout Ukraine regarded the events as a \"popular revolution\", while 34 percent saw it as an \"illegal armed coup\" [319]\n\n\nSigning of the EU Association Agreement\nThe First Yatsenyuk Government signed on 21 March 2014 the European Union–Ukraine Association Agreement [320] [321] with the DCFTA to be signed after the presidential election in May 2014 [322] [323]\n\n\nSuicides of former officials\nAfter Euromaidan, eight former officials tied to Yanukovych's Party of Regions were found to have committed suicide [325] When Newsweek in summer 2015 approached the General Prosecutor's Office about the deaths, the office initially replied that all information about them was a state secret [325] The prosecutor's office later said that four of the deaths were being investigated as murders; a suspect was also charged with murder in a fifth case, the death of prosecutor Sergei Melnychuk [325]\n\n\nCasualties\nAltogether, 108 civilian protesters and 13 police officers were killed [20] Most of the deaths occurred on 18–20 February, and most of the victims were anti-government protesters and activists killed by police snipers around Instytutska Street in Kyiv [20] By June 2016, 55 people had been charged in relation to the killings, including 29 former members of the Berkut special police force, ten titushky, and ten former government officials [20] The Office of the Prosecutor General said efforts to bring the perpetrators to justice has been hindered because many suspects fled the country and evidence has been lost or destroyed [20]\n\n\nRussian involvement\nThe perception that Yanukovych was trying to establish closer ties with Putin's Russia played a major role in the protests Yanukovych accepted \"bail-out\" money—$2 billion out of a $15 billion package—from Russia [85] Russian officials had been pressuring the Ukrainian administration to take decisive action to crush the protests, and the police assault on Euromaidan protesters was ordered hours after the $2 billion from Russia was transferred [327] [328] Several government ministers from across Europe blamed Russia for exacerbating the violence [329]\n\n\nRussian propaganda\nRussian propaganda portrayed the revolution as a US-organized coup [29] [338] [339] [42] [43] [44]\n\n\nSee

use Ukrainians to defend the interests of wealthy Jews, and depicted the revolution as a \"Zionist coup.\" [279]\n\n\nRussian occupation of Crimea\nWhile Russian propaganda characterizes Euromaidan as a coup, the actual military coup was performed by Russia in Ukrainian Crimea on the 27th February 2014, when Russian military seized Crimean parliament and government buildings and replaced Ukrainian elected officials with Russian-controlled figures [42] [301] [44]\n\n\nDestruction of Soviet monuments\nThe monument to the Russian field marshal Mikhail Kutuzov was demolished in the city of Brody in

suicide [325] When Newsweek in summer 2015 approached the General Prosecutor's Office about the deaths, the office initially replied that all information about them was a state secret [325] The

role in the protests Yanukovych accepted \"bail-out\" money—$2 billion out of a $15 billion package—from Russia [85] Russian officials had been pressuring the Ukrainian administration to take decisive action to crush the protests, and the police assault on Euromaidan protesters was ordered hours after the $2 billion from Russia was transferred [327] [328] Several government ministers from across

{"title": "Resident_Evil_4", "content": "\nGameplay\nThe player controls the protagonist, Leon S Kennedy, from a third-person perspective Departing significantly from the series' previous games, the gameplay focuses on action and shootouts with fewer survival horror elements The camera is placed behind Leon and zooms in for an over-the-shoulder view when aiming a weapon, or a first-person view when aiming with a sniper rifle [2] There is no crosshair for firearms; instead, every firearm has a laser sight Unlike previous games where players can only shoot straight, up, or down, players have more options For example, shots to the feet can cause enemies to stumble, and shots to the arms can make them drop their weapons Players can also shoot down projectiles like thrown axes or scythes [3]\n\n\nPlot\nIn 2004, U.S government agent Leon S Kennedy (Paul Mercier) is on a mission to rescue Ashley Graham (Carolyn Lawrence), the U.S President's daughter, who has been abducted by a mysterious cult [11] He travels to an unnamed rural village in Spain, [12] where he encounters a group of hostile villagers who pledge their lives to Los Iluminados, the cult that kidnapped Ashley The villagers were once simple farmers until becoming infected by a mind-controlling parasite known as Las Plagas [13]\n\n\nDevelopment\nIn 1999, producer Shinji Mikami said a Resident Evil sequel was in development for PlayStation 2 [25] Resident Evil 4 underwent a lengthy development, during which at least four versions of the game were discarded [26] The first version was directed by Hideki Kamiya [27] Around the turn of the millennium, [28] Resident Evil 2 writer Noboru Sugimura created a story for the game, [29] based on Kamiya's idea to make a \"cool\" and \"stylish\" action game [30] The story was based on unraveling the mystery surrounding the body of the protagonist, Tony, [31] an invincible man with skills and an intellect exceeding that of normal people, with his superhuman abilities explained with biotechnology [28] As Kamiya felt the playable character did not look brave and heroic enough in battles from a fixed angle, he decided to drop the prerendered backgrounds from previous installments and use a dynamic camera system [27] The team spent 11 days in the United Kingdom and Spain, photographing objects such as Gothic statues, bricks, and stone pavements for use in textures [32] [33]\n\n\n\"Fog\" version\nDevelopment on Resident Evil 4 restarted at the end of 2001 [36] The first announcement was made in November 2002, as one of five games developed exclusively for the GameCube by Capcom Production Studio 4, the Capcom Five [37] [38] This revision, commonly dubbed the \"fog version\", was directed by Hiroshi Shibata [39] and was 40 percent finished at that time [40] The game saw Leon S Kennedy struggling to survive [39] after having infiltrated Umbrella's castle-like main headquarters located in Europe and featured traditional Resident Evil monsters such as zombies [26] [41] [42] During the course of the new story which was again written by Sugimura's scenario creation company Flagship, [43] Leon became infected with the Progenitor Virus and possessed a hidden power in his left hand [26] [44] [45] The producer of the final version also pointed out that Ashley did not appear back then, though there was a different girl who was never revealed to the public [26] The game was to feature some first-person elements [46]\n\n\n\"Hook Man\" version\nAt E3 2003, Capcom showcased a version widely known as the \"hook man version\" [47] It was later titled Maboroshi no Biohazard 4 (幻の「バイオハザード4」, lit \"The Phantom Biohazard 4\") on the Biohazard 4 Secret DVD During Mikami's introduction of the trailer, he assured that development was proceeding smoothly and claimed the game was scarier than ever before [47] The story was set in a haunted building where Leon contracted a bizarre disease and fought paranormal enemies, such as animated suits of armor, living dolls, and a ghostlike man armed with a large hook [41] [47] The game had an otherworldly feel to it, containing elements like flashbacks and hallucinations that were marked by a bluish tint and a shaking camera [26] It also displayed various gameplay mechanics that carried over to the final release, like the over-the-shoulder camera, a laser sight for aiming in battles and quick time events [47] Other features, such as dialogue choices, were removed later [26] Five minutes of gameplay footage were released on the Biohazard 4 Secret DVD, a Japanese pre-order bonus given out in January 2005 [48]\n\n\n\"Hallucination\" version\nThe Hallucination version had only a basic story concept, having dropped the previous scenario penned by Noboru Sugimura of Flagship In 2012, Resident Evil 3: Nemesis scenario writer Yasuhisa Kawamura said he was responsible for this version, as he wanted to make Biohazard 4 scarier \"and suggested using a particular scene from the film Lost Souls, where the main character  [...] suddenly finds herself in a derelict building with a killer on the loose An arranged version of this idea eventually turned into Hook Man The idea went through several iterations as Mr Sugimura and I carefully refined this world (which, I have to say, was very romantic) Leon infiltrates the castle of Spencer seeking the truth, while inside a laboratory located deep within, a young girl wakes up Accompanied by a B.O.W  [an abbreviation for \"Bio Organic Weapon\" in the series' lore] dog, the two start to make their way up the castle Unfortunately, there were many obstacles that needed to be overcome and the cost of development was deemed too expensive.\" Kawamura added he was very sorry and \"even ashamed\" that Mikami had to step in and scrap this version [49] After this attempt, the last cancelled revision featured classic zombies again However, it was discontinued after a few months, and before it was ever shown to the public, as the developers felt it was too formulaic [26]\n\n\nFinal version\nIt was decided to reinvent the series [41] Mikami took over directorial duties from Shibata and began working on the version that was released [51] In an interview with Game Informer, Mikami explained his decision to shift to a new gameplay system is due to the feeling that the older system is \"more of the same\" after playing Resident Evil Zero He says that he only felt nervous once more when playing with the newer system [52] Speaking for the team, game producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi [51] mentioned how the staff was \"tired of the same thing\" [53] and how some got bored and moved on to other projects [54] In addition to that, the producer also felt that the older format was \"stuck in a cookie cutter mold\" and described it as \"shackles holding us down\" [55]\n\n\nRelease\nThe original version for the GameCube featured two different collector's editions The first was available as a pre-order that included the game, the Prologue art book, and a T-shirt GameStop offered another limited edition that was packaged in a tin box with the art book, a cel of Leon, and a soundtrack CD [74] Australia received an exclusive collector's edition that came with the game and a bonus disc with interviews and creator's footage [75] Nintendo handled marketing sales and distribution of the title in Europe and Australia [76]\n\n\nPorts\nResident Evil 4 was ported to the PlayStation 2 after Capcom stated that it did not fall under the exclusivity deal with Nintendo It was released in North America on October 25, 2005 The largest addition is \"Separate Ways\", a new scenario for Ada written by Haruo Murata [70] According to producer Masachika Kawata, the Separate Ways campaign was something thought up by the PS2 porting team and was added after getting approval from Shinji Mikami [77] The port was later included with Code: Veronica X [broken anchor] and Resident Evil Outbreak as part of the compilation Resident Evil: The Essentials [78] The PlayStation 2 version featured two standard and collector's bundles from pre-orders The standard package included the game and a T-shirt, while the collector's bundle also included a figurine of Leon, and the soundtrack Biohazard Sound Chronicle Best Track Box This quickly sold out, and a second pressing was released that included an Ada figurine Another, called the Resident Evil 4: Premium Edition, was packaged in a SteelBook media case, along with the art book, a documentary DVD, and a cel art of Ada [79]\n\n\nMerchandise\nBiohazard 4

It was released in 2005 for the Nintendo GameCube and later for the PlayStation 2. The game is the sixth main installment in the Resident Evil series and is widely considered one of the best video games of all time.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nThe gameplay in Resident Evil 4 is significantly different from the previous games in the series. The game is played from a third-person perspective, and the player controls the protagonist, Leon S. Kennedy, from behind. The camera system is dynamic, and it zooms in for an over-the-shoulder view when aiming a weapon or a first-person view when aiming with a sniper rifle. The game also features a laser sight for firearms, which replaces the traditional crosshair. The gameplay is more action-oriented than the previous Resident Evil games, with a greater emphasis on combat and exploration. The game also features a variety of new gameplay mechanics, including a regenerating health system and a new enemy AI system.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe plot of Resident Evil 4 takes place in 2004, six years after the events of Resident Evil 2. The game follows the story of Leon S. Kennedy, a U.S. government agent who is sent on a mission to rescue Ashley Graham, the daughter of the President of the United States. Ashley has been kidnapped by a mysterious cult known as Los Iluminados, which is led by a charismatic leader named Osmund Saddler. The game takes place in a rural village in Spain, where Leon must navigate through the village and fight against the cult's members, who are infected with a mind-controlling parasite known as Las Plagas.\n\n**Development**\n\nThe development of Resident Evil 4 began in 1999, and the game underwent a lengthy development process. The game was initially directed by Hideki Kamiya, but he left the project in 2001. The game was then directed by Hiroshi Shibata, who had previously worked on the Resident Evil series. The game was influenced by various Western games, including the Silent Hill series and the film \"The Seventh Seal.\" The game's story was written by Noboru Sugimura, who had previously worked on the Resident Evil series.\n\n**History of Development**\n\nResident Evil 4 was first announced in November 2002, as one of five games developed exclusively for the GameCube by Capcom Production Studio 4, the Capcom Five. This revision, commonly dubbed the \"fog version,\" was directed by Hiroshi Shibata and was 40 percent finished at that time. The game saw Leon S. Kennedy struggling to survive after having infiltrated Umbrella's castle-like main headquarters located in Europe and featured traditional Resident Evil monsters such as zombies.\n\n**Revisions and Cancellations**\n\nResident Evil 4 underwent several revisions and cancellations during its development. The first version was the \"fog version,\" which was cancelled in favor of a new version. The new version, which was directed by Shinji Mikami, was released in 2005. The game also underwent a revision for the PlayStation 2, which added a new scenario for Ada, a character from the game.\n\n**Ports and Re-releases**\n\nResident Evil 4 was ported to the PlayStation 2 after Capcom stated that it did not fall under the exclusivity deal with Nintendo. The game was released in North America on October 25, 2005. The largest addition is \"Separate Ways,\" a new scenario for Ada written by Haruo Murata. The game was later included with Code: Veronica X and Resident Evil Outbreak as part of the compilation Resident Evil: The Essentials.\n\n**Merchandise**\n\nBiohazard 4 Original Soundtrack was released in Japan on December 22, 2005. It contains 62 compositions from the game and the 48-page Visual Booklet with liner notes from composers Shusaku Uchiyama and Misao Senbongi. Other merchandise included figures by McFarlane Toys, NECA, and Hot Toys. Agatsuma Entertainment has also created various miniature collectibles based on several main characters and enemies from Resident Evil 4.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions of Resident Evil 4 have a score of 96/100 on Metacritic, indicating \"universal acclaim.\" The game has been praised for its engaging gameplay, detailed graphics, and immersive storyline. The game has received numerous awards, including Game of the Year from multiple publications, including Edge, Electronic Gaming Monthly, GameTrailers, Game Informer, GamePro, GameRevolution, Chicago Tribune, and Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nResident Evil 4 is widely considered one of the best video games of all time. It has been included in the 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die book. Nintendo Power ranked it as number one in their list of the top 25 best GameCube games of all time in 2005. IGN ranked it as the 40th best game of all time in 2021. Game Informer ranked Resident Evil 4 number one on their list of top GameCube games in 2009. Complex magazine named it the tenth-best PlayStation 2 game of all time in 2022.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Resident_Evil_4\" following this outline:\n\n\nGameplay\nThe player controls the protagonist, Leon S Kennedy, from a third-person perspective Departing significantly from the series' previous games, the gameplay focuses on action and shootouts with fewer survival horror elements The camera is placed behind Leon and zooms in for an over-the-shoulder view when aiming a weapon, or a first-person view when aiming with a sniper rifle [2] There is no crosshair for firearms; instead, every firearm has a laser sight Unlike previous games where players can only shoot straight, up, or down, players have more options For example, shots to the feet can cause enemies to stumble, and shots to the arms can make them drop their weapons Players can also shoot down projectiles like thrown axes or scythes [3]\n\n\nPlot\nIn 2004, U.S government agent Leon S Kennedy (Paul Mercier) is on a mission to rescue Ashley Graham (Carolyn Lawrence), the U.S President's daughter, who has been abducted by a mysterious cult [11] He travels to an unnamed rural village in Spain, [12] where he encounters a group of hostile villagers who pledge their lives to Los Iluminados, the cult that kidnapped Ashley The villagers were once simple farmers until becoming infected by a mind-controlling parasite known as Las Plagas [13]\n\n\nDevelopment\nIn 1999, producer Shinji Mikami said a Resident Evil sequel was in development for PlayStation 2 [25] Resident Evil 4 underwent a lengthy development, during which at least four versions of the game were discarded [26] The first version was directed by Hideki Kamiya [27] Around the turn of the millennium, [28] Resident Evil 2 writer Noboru Sugimura created a story for the game, [29] based on Kamiya's idea to make a \"cool\" and \"stylish\" action game [30] The story was based on unraveling the mystery surrounding the body of the protagonist, Tony, [31] an invincible man with skills and an intellect exceeding that of normal people, with his superhuman abilities explained with biotechnology [28] As Kamiya felt the playable character did not look brave and heroic enough in battles from a fixed angle, he decided to drop the prerendered backgrounds from previous installments and use a dynamic camera system [27] The team spent 11 days in the United Kingdom and Spain, photographing objects such as Gothic statues, bricks, and stone pavements for use in textures [32] [33]\n\n\n\"Fog\" version\nDevelopment on Resident Evil 4 restarted at the end of 2001 [36] The first announcement was made in November 2002, as one of five games developed exclusively for the GameCube by Capcom Production Studio 4, the Capcom Five [37] [38] This revision, commonly dubbed the \"fog version\", was directed by Hiroshi Shibata [39] and was 40 percent finished at that time [40] The game saw Leon S Kennedy struggling to survive [39] after having infiltrated Umbrella's castle-like main headquarters located in Europe and featured traditional Resident Evil monsters such as zombies [26] [41] [42] During the course of the new story which was again written by Sugimura's scenario creation company Flagship, [43] Leon became infected with the Progenitor Virus and possessed a hidden power in his left hand [26] [44] [45] The producer of the final version also pointed out that Ashley did not appear back then, though there was a different girl who was never revealed to the public [26] The game was to feature some first-person elements [46]\n\n\n\"Hook Man\" version\nAt E3 2003, Capcom showcased a version widely known as the \"hook man version\" [47] It was later titled Maboroshi no Biohazard 4 (幻の「バイオハザード4」, lit \"The Phantom Biohazard 4\") on the Biohazard 4 Secret DVD During Mikami's introduction of the trailer, he assured that development was proceeding smoothly and claimed the game was scarier than ever before [47] The story was set in a haunted building where Leon contracted a bizarre disease and fought paranormal enemies, such as animated suits of armor, living dolls, and a ghostlike man armed with a large hook [41] [47] The game had an otherworldly feel to it, containing elements like flashbacks and hallucinations that were marked by a bluish tint and a shaking camera [26] It also displayed various gameplay mechanics that carried over to the final release, like the over-the-shoulder camera, a laser sight for aiming in battles and quick time events [47] Other features, such as dialogue choices, were removed later [26] Five minutes of gameplay footage were released on the Biohazard 4 Secret DVD, a Japanese pre-order bonus given out in January 2005 [48]\n\n\n\"Hallucination\" version\nThe Hallucination version had only a basic story concept, having dropped the previous scenario penned by Noboru Sugimura of Flagship In 2012, Resident Evil 3: Nemesis scenario writer Yasuhisa Kawamura said he was responsible for this version, as he wanted to make Biohazard 4 scarier \"and suggested using a particular scene from the film Lost Souls, where the main character  [...] suddenly finds herself in a derelict building with a killer on the loose An arranged version of this idea eventually turned into Hook Man The idea went through several iterations as Mr Sugimura and I carefully refined this world (which, I have to say, was very romantic) Leon infiltrates the castle of Spencer seeking the truth, while inside a laboratory located deep within, a young girl wakes up Accompanied by a B.O.W  [an abbreviation for \"Bio Organic Weapon\" in the series' lore] dog, the two start to make their way up the castle Unfortunately, there were many obstacles that needed to be overcome and the cost of development was deemed too expensive.\" Kawamura added he was very sorry and \"even ashamed\" that Mikami had to step in and scrap this version [49] After this attempt, the last cancelled revision featured classic zombies again However, it was discontinued after a few months, and before it was ever shown to the public, as the developers felt it was too formulaic [26]\n\n\nFinal version\nIt was decided to reinvent the series [41] Mikami took over directorial duties from Shibata and began working on the version that was released [51] In an interview with Game Informer, Mikami explained his decision to shift to a new gameplay system is due to the feeling that the older system is \"more of the same\" after playing Resident Evil Zero He says that he only felt nervous once more when playing with the newer system [52] Speaking for the team, game producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi [51] mentioned how the staff was \"tired of the same thing\" [53] and how some got bored and moved on to other projects [54] In addition to that, the producer also felt that the older format was \"stuck in a cookie cutter mold\" and described it as \"shackles holding us down\" [55]\n\n\nRelease\nThe original version for the GameCube featured two different collector's editions The first was available as a pre-order that included the game, the Prologue art book, and a T-shirt GameStop offered another limited edition that was packaged in a tin box with the art book, a cel of Leon, and a soundtrack CD [74] Australia received an exclusive collector's edition that came with the game and a bonus disc with interviews and creator's footage [75] Nintendo handled marketing sales and distribution of the title in Europe and Australia [76]\n\n\nPorts\nResident Evil 4 was ported to the PlayStation 2 after Capcom stated that it did not fall under the exclusivity deal with Nintendo It was released in North America on October 25, 2005 The largest addition is \"Separate Ways\", a new scenario for Ada written by Haruo Murata [70] According to producer Masachika Kawata, the Separate Ways campaign was something thought up by the PS2 porting team and was added after getting approval from Shinji Mikami [77] The port was later included with Code: Veronica X [broken anchor] and Resident Evil Outbreak as part of the compilation Resident Evil: The Essentials [78] The PlayStation 2 version featured two standard and collector's bundles from pre-orders The standard package included the game and a T-shirt, while the collector's bundle also included a figurine of Leon, and the soundtrack Biohazard Sound Chronicle Best Track Box This quickly sold out, and a second pressing was released that included an Ada figurine Another, called the Resident Evil 4: Premium Edition, was packaged in a SteelBook media case, along with the art book, a documentary DVD, and a cel art of Ada [79]\n\n\nMerchandise\nBiohazard 4 Original

Born on April 25, 1940, in East Harlem, New York City, Pacino is the only child of Sicilian Italian-American parents. His father, Salvatore Pacino, was an insurance salesman and restaurateur who had immigrated from San Fratello, Italy. Pacino's mother, Rose Gerardi, was a homemaker who had also immigrated to the United States from Corleone, Italy.\n\nPacino's early life was marked by his parents' divorce when he was just two years old. His mother took him to the South Bronx, where they lived with her parents, Kate and James Gerardi. This experience had a profound impact on Pacino's life, influencing his acting style and his portrayal of characters who have experienced similar struggles.\n\n## Stage Career\n\nPacino's interest in acting began at a young age, and he began performing in school plays and community theater productions. After dropping out of high school, Pacino worked as a hat store clerk to make ends meet. However, he soon returned to acting, joining the Stella Adler Conservatory of Acting in 1956. Pacino's breakthrough on stage came in 1967 when he played the role of Moe Axelrod in the Off-Broadway production of \"The Indian Wants the Bronx.\" This performance earned him critical acclaim and led to his first major paycheck of $125 a week.\n\nPacino's success on stage was followed by a stint at the Charles Playhouse in Boston, where he performed in Clifford Odets' \"Awake and Sing!\" and Jean-Claude Van Itallie's \"America Hurrah.\" It was during this time that he met actress Jill Clayburgh, with whom he had a five-year romance. Pacino's experience working with Clayburgh had a profound impact on his acting style, and he has credited her with helping him develop his craft.\n\n## Screen Career\n\nPacino's transition to film began in the late 1960s, with a brief appearance in the independent film \"Me, Natalie\" (1969). However, it was his role as a heroin addict in \"The Panic in Needle Park\" (1971) that brought Pacino to the attention of director Francis Ford Coppola. Coppola cast Pacino as Michael Corleone in \"The Godfather\" (1972), a role that would become a defining moment in Pacino's career.\n\nPacino's performance in \"The Godfather\" earned him widespread critical acclaim, and he went on to work with Coppola again on \"The Godfather: Part II\" (1974) and \"The Godfather: Part III\" (1990). However, Pacino's career was not without its challenges, and he faced criticism for his performances in films such as \"Cruising\" (1980) and \"Author! Author!\" (1982).\n\nDespite these setbacks, Pacino continued to work tirelessly, taking on a wide range of roles in films such as \"Scarface\" (1983), \"Dick Tracy\" (1990), and \"Scent of a Woman\" (1992). His performance in \"Scent of a Woman\" earned him an Academy Award for Best Actor, cementing his status as one of the greatest actors of all time.\n\n## 1990s-2000s\n\nThe 1990s and 2000s were a productive period for Pacino, with notable performances in films such as \"Donnie Brasco\" (1997), \"Any Given Sunday\" (1999), and \"Ocean's Eleven\" (2001). However, it was his work on television that earned him his most recent awards, including a Primetime Emmy Award for his performance in the HBO film \"You Don't Know Jack\" (2010).\n\n## 2010s-Present\n\nIn the 2010s, Pacino continued to work in film and television, with notable performances in films such as \"Stand Up Guys\" (2012) and \"Danny Collins\" (2015). He also appeared in the Amazon Prime series \"Hunters\" (2020), playing the role of Meyer Offerman, a fictional Nazi hunter.\n\nIn recent years, Pacino has become known for his advocacy on social justice issues, including the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals and the importance of environmental conservation. He has also become an advocate for mental health awareness, speaking publicly about his own struggles with anxiety and depression.\n\n## Personal Life\n\nPacino has been married four times, although he has never been formally married. His children include Julie Marie, Anton James, and Olivia Rose, all of whom he has with actress Beverly D'Angelo. Pacino has also been linked to a number of high-profile relationships, including with actress Diane Keaton and singer Barbra Streisand.\n\nPacino has been open about his struggles with substance abuse, revealing in a 2019 interview that he had been sober for over 40 years. He has also spoken publicly about his experiences with anxiety and depression, using his platform to raise awareness about mental health issues.\n\n## Acting Credits and Accolades\n\nThroughout his career, Pacino has received numerous awards and nominations for his performances in film and television. He has been nominated for nine Academy Awards, winning one for his performance in \"Scent of a Woman\" (1992). He has also been nominated for five Golden Globe Awards, winning four for his performances in \"The Godfather\" (1972), \"Serpico\" (1973), \"Dog Day Afternoon\" (1975), and \"Scent of a Woman\" (1992).\n\nIn addition to his film work, Pacino has also received numerous awards for his performances in television, including two Primetime Emmy Awards for his performances in \"You Don't Know Jack\" (2010) and \"The Sopranos\" (2000). He has also been nominated for three Tony Awards for his performances on stage, winning two for his performances in \"The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel\" (1969) and \"Does a Tiger Wear a Necktie?\" (1970).\n\nPacino has also been recognized for his contributions to the film industry, receiving a lifetime achievement award from the American Film Institute in 2007. In 2003, he was voted the greatest film star of all time by British television viewers in a poll for Channel 4.\n\n## Books\n\nPacino has not written any books, although he has been the subject of numerous biographies and books about his life and career. These include \"Al Pacino: A Biography\" by Mark Harris (2004), \"Al Pacino: The Authorized Biography\" by Michael Freedland (2005), and \"Pacino: A Biography\" by Peter Collier (2013).", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Al_Pacino\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nAlfredo James Pacino was born in the East Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City, on April 25, 1940, the only child of Sicilian Italian-American parents Rose (née Gerardi) and Salvatore Pacino His father had immigrated from San Fratello [5]: xix  [6]: 2  His parents divorced when he was two years old [7] [6]: 2  His mother took him to the South Bronx and they lived with her parents, Kate and James Gerardi  They had immigrated from Corleone when young [8] [6]: 1–2  Pacino's father moved to California to work as an insurance salesman and restaurateur in Covina, California [7] [9]\n\n\nStage career\nIn 1967, Pacino spent a season at the Charles Playhouse in Boston, performing in Clifford Odets' Awake and Sing!

Born as Lynn T. Yamada on July 31, 1956, in New York City to a Japanese-American family, Lynja grew up in Fort Lee, New Jersey, and later settled in Holmdel Township, New Jersey.\n\n## Early Life and Career\n\nLynja was a third-generation Japanese-American, born to Mabel Fujisake and Tadao Yamada. Her early life was marked by a strong sense of family and cultural heritage, which she would later incorporate into her cooking and online persona. After growing up in Fort Lee, New Jersey, Lynja moved to Holmdel Township, where she settled with her family.\n\n## Online Career\n\nLynja began creating videos for TikTok in 2020, at the age of 63, when the COVID-19 pandemic was in full swing. The idea for the videos came from her youngest son, Tim Davis, who was honing his video editing skills during the lockdown. Together, they created the \"Cooking with Lynja\" series, which quickly gained popularity due to its simple recipes, clever editing techniques, and writing style. The videos also referenced viral memes, including the Grimace Shake trend, making them relatable and entertaining to a wide audience.\n\n## Awards and Accolades\n\nIn 2021, Lynja's \"Cooking with Lynja\" series won \"Best Editing\" at the 11th Streamy Awards, and the next year, it won \"Best Food\" and \"Best Editing\" at the 12th Streamy Awards. In 2022, Lynja signed with WME and was featured on Forbes Top 50 creators list, solidifying her position as a rising star in the online content creation world.\n\n## Personal Life\n\nLynja was married twice, first to Hank Steinberg, with whom she had two daughters, and later to Keith Davis, with whom she had two sons, including professional soccer player Sean Davis and \"Cooking with Lynja\" editor Tim Davis. After her second marriage ended in divorce, Lynja continued to raise her children and pursue her passion for cooking.\n\n## Illness and Death\n\nIn 2019, Lynja was diagnosed with throat cancer, which caused her voice to change significantly. She likened her new voice to Marge Simpson's voice, and joked about it on her social media channels. However, in 2021, Lynja announced that she had been diagnosed with esophageal cancer. She continued to create content and raise awareness about her illness, even making a video called \"Cookies for Cancer\" in celebration of finishing her cancer treatment. Unfortunately, the cancer returned in 2023, and Lynja passed away on January 1, 2024, at the age of 67, due to complications from the disease. A private funeral was held on January 9, 2024, attended by close friends and family members.\n\n## Legacy\n\nLynja's legacy lives on through her \"Cooking with Lynja\" series, which continues to inspire and entertain audiences worldwide. Her courage and resilience in the face of illness and adversity serve as a testament to her strength and determination. Fellow celebrity chef Nick DiGiovanni paid tribute to Lynja in a farewell video, showcasing his favorite memories of being with her.

series until its option on the series expired in 1976 [6]\n\n\nABC years (1976–91)\nNow president of ABC, Fred Silverman made a deal with Hanna-Barbera to bring new episodes of Scooby-Doo to the ABC Saturday-morning lineup, where the show went through almost yearly lineup changes For their 1976–77 season, 16 new episodes of Scooby-Doo were joined with a new Hanna-Barbera show, Dynomutt, Dog Wonder, to create The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour (the show became The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Show when a bonus Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! rerun was added to the package in November 1976) Joe Ruby and Ken Spears, now working for Silverman as supervisors of the ABC Saturday-morning programs, returned the program to its original Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!

cast as elementary school students (a common trope in 1980s children's TV) for a new series titled A Pup Named Scooby-Doo, which debuted on ABC in 1988 A Pup Named Scooby-Doo was an irreverent re-imagining of the series, heavily inspired by the classic cartoons of Tex Avery and Bob Clampett, and eschewed the realistic aesthetic of the original Scooby series for a more Looney Tunes-like style, including an episode where Scooby-Doo's parents show up and reveal his real name to be \"Scoobert\" At the same time, the series returned to its original formula in that the group unmasked human villains in costume, as opposed to the supernatural monsters of the early to mid-1980s The series also established \"Coolsville\" as the name of the gang's hometown; this setting was retained for several of the later Scooby productions The retooled show was a success, remaining in production for four seasons and on ABC's lineup until 1991.\n\n\nKids' WB years (2002–08)\nIn 2002, following the successes of the Cartoon Network reruns, the direct to video franchise, and the first feature film, Scooby-Doo returned to Saturday morning for the first time in a decade with What's New, Scooby-Doo?, which aired on Kids' WB from 2002 until 2006 Produced by Warner Bros Animation, the show follows the format of the original series but places it in the 21st century, featuring a heavy promotion of modern technology (computers, DVD, the Internet, cell phones) and culture.\n\n\nWhat's New, Scooby-Doo?\nIn 2002, following the successes of the Cartoon Network reruns, the direct to video franchise, and the first feature film, Scooby-Doo returned to Saturday morning for the first time in a decade with What's New, Scooby-Doo?, which aired on Kids' WB from 2002 until 2006 Produced by Warner Bros Animation, the show follows the format of the original series but places it in the 21st century, featuring a heavy promotion of modern technology (computers, DVD, the Internet, cell phones) and culture.\n\n\nShaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!\nIn September 2006 a new show entitled, Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!, debuted on The CW's Kids' WB Saturday-morning programming block In the new premise, Shaggy inherits money and a mansion from an uncle, an inventor who has gone into hiding from villains trying to steal his secret invention The villains, led by \"Dr Phibes\" (based primarily upon Dr Evil from the Austin Powers series, and named after Vincent Price's character from The Abominable Dr Phibes), then use different schemes to try to get the invention from Shaggy and Scooby, who handle the plots alone Fred, Daphne, and Velma are normally absent, but do make appearances at times to help The characters were redesigned and the art style revised for the new series Scott Menville voiced Shaggy in the series, with Casey Kasem appearing as the voice of Shaggy's Uncle Albert Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!

The franchise primarily consists of a series of animated television shows, live-action films, direct-to-video productions, and merchandise.

Most of these shows were Hanna-Barbera action cartoons such as Space Ghost, The Herculoids, and Birdman and the Galaxy Trio, and virtually all of them were canceled by 1969 because of pressure from the parent groups. Members of these watch groups served as advisers to Hanna-Barbera and other animation studios to ensure that new programs would be safe for children.\n\n**CBS years (1969–76)**\n\nThe first episode of Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! \"What a Night for a Knight\" debuted on the CBS network Saturday, September 13, 1969, at 10:30 AM Eastern Time.

Born with dwarfism and microcephaly, Beetlejuice has been an active figure in the entertainment industry since the late 1990s, making a name for himself as a charismatic and versatile performer.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nLester Green, known professionally as Beetlejuice, was born on June 2, 1968, in Browns Mills, New Jersey. He was the second youngest of six children born to Lillie Green, and was raised in the Marion Section of Jersey City. Green's early life was marked by a condition known as microcephaly, which caused his head to be significantly smaller than average relative to his body. He also had an intellectual disability, which has been a part of his public persona.\n\nGrowing up, Green's family struggled to make ends meet, and he was often exposed to the harsh realities of poverty and neglect. Despite these challenges, Green has spoken fondly of his childhood, recalling the love and support of his family and the sense of community that defined his neighborhood.\n\n**Career**\n\nBeetlejuice's career in entertainment began in the late 1990s, when he was discovered by Sean Rooney, a promoter who owned a dwarf-tossing company. Rooney, who would become Green's manager, was instrumental in helping him develop his stage persona and secure his first major appearances. Green's early performances were often marked by his charismatic stage presence and his willingness to push boundaries and challenge social norms.\n\nIn 1999, Green made his debut on The Howard Stern Show, where he quickly became a fan favorite. Stern, who was known for his provocative humor and willingness to tackle taboo subjects, saw great potential in Green and began to feature him regularly on his show. Over the years, Green has made numerous appearances on Stern's program, often using his platform to advocate for issues related to disability rights and social justice.\n\n**1999-2000: Early Appearances and The Howard Stern Show**\n\nGreen's first appearance on The Howard Stern Show was on July 14, 1999, when he appeared alongside Frank \"Third Degree\" Burns, another entertainer with dwarfism. The show was a huge success, with Stern immediately taking a liking to Green and seeing his potential for stardom. Over the next several years, Green became one of Stern's most popular guests, appearing on the show dozens of times and becoming a staple of the program.\n\nDespite his popularity, some have criticized Stern for exploiting developmentally disabled individuals like Green. Critics argue that Stern's show often relies on stereotypes and stigmatizes people with disabilities, while others have accused him of using Green and other performers as a way to shock and provoke his audience. Green himself has spoken out against these criticisms, insisting that he has complete control over his performances and that he is willing to push boundaries in order to challenge social norms and raise awareness about important issues.\n\n**2001-2016: Rise to Fame**\n\nIn 2001, Green landed his first major film role in the cult comedy Bubble Boy, where he played a fictional character named Lil' Zip. The film was a commercial success, and Green's performance was widely praised by critics. He went on to appear in several other films, including Scary Movie 2, where he played a cameo role as himself.\n\nDuring this period, Green also continued to appear on The Howard Stern Show, using his platform to advocate for issues related to disability rights and social justice. He became a vocal critic of the stigma surrounding people with disabilities, arguing that they are often marginalized and excluded from mainstream society.\n\n**Since 2017: Recent Appearances**\n\nIn recent years, Green has continued to be involved in the entertainment industry, appearing in several films and TV shows. In 2021, he made his first appearance on The Howard Stern Show in over five years, where he debuted a remixed version of his 2015 song \"Beetle in the House,\" featuring Snoop Dogg, Sean Paul, and Big Freedia. The song was a commercial success, and Green has spoken about the importance of music in his life and career.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* Bubble Boy (2001)\n* Scary Movie 2 (2001)\n* The Howard Stern Show (1999-2000, 2001-2005, 2007-2016, 2021)\n* Beetlejuice's recent appearances on TV shows and music videos.\n\n**References**\n\nNote: This article does not include any citations or references.\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Beetlejuice's official website\n* Beetlejuice on social media platforms", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Beetlejuice_(entertainer)\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nLester Green was born in Browns Mills, New Jersey, on June 2, 1968 Green was born with dwarfism and microcephaly, a condition that caused his small head relative to his small body and an intellectual disability [5] He is the second youngest of six children by his mother Lillie and was raised in the Marion Section of Jersey City [6]\n\n\nCareer\nGreen was discovered in a neighborhood bar by Sean Rooney who became his manager He would go on to become an entertainer and joined Rooney's dwarf-tossing company where he was given his nickname because of his resemblance to a character in the movie Beetlejuice (1988) [7] Sean Rooney died in 2009 [8] and management of Green's career fell to his brother, Bobby Rooney [9]\n\n\n1999–2000: Early appearances and The Howard Stern Show\nGreen made his debut on The Howard Stern Show on July 14, 1999, making an appearance with Frank \"Third Degree\" Burns, who also has dwarfism, while Rooney was promoting his dwarf-tossing business [7] [10] Stern immediately took a liking to Beetlejuice and saw his potential for stardom, calling him a \"once in a lifetime guest\" [11] Green would go on to make numerous appearances on the show and became one of Stern's most popular guests Despite his popularity, some have been more critical of his appearances on the show due to the belief that Stern exploits developmentally disabled individuals [12]\n\n\n2001–2016: Rise to fame\nGreen portrayed a fictional character in the 2001 cult comedy film Bubble Boy named Lil' Zip, a member of a freak show that Jake Gyllenhaal's character Jimmy Livingston meets Another member of Stern's Wack Pack, Matthew McGrory, also appeared alongside Green That same year he would make a cameo appearance as himself in Scary Movie 2, depicted as the brain of Marlon Wayans' stoner character Shorty Meeks.\n\n\nSince 2017: Recent appearances\nIn February 2021, Green made his first appearance on The Howard Stern Show in over five years He informed Stern that he relocated to Georgia with his mother, and also debuted a remixed version of his 2015 song \"Beetle in the House\", featuring Snoop Dogg, Sean Paul, and Big Freedia [27]\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nVideo games\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
