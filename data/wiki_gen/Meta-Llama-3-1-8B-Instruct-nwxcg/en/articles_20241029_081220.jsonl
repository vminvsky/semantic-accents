The style is named after the Italian architect Andrea Palladio, who is considered one of the most influential architects of all time. Palladian architecture has had a profound impact on Western architectural history, influencing the development of various styles, including Neoclassicism, Georgian, and Victorian architecture.\n\n**Palladio's Architecture**\n\nAndrea Palladio (1508-1580) was a Venetian architect who is best known for his designs of villas, palaces, and churches in the Veneto region of Italy. Palladio's architecture was heavily influenced by classical Roman and Greek architecture, as well as the works of the Italian architect Sebastiano Serlio. He is particularly famous for his villas, which were designed to be harmonious with their surroundings and to reflect the owner's status and wealth.\n\nPalladio's villas are characterized by their use of symmetry, proportion, and classical elements, such as columns, arches, and domes. His designs often featured a central axis, with a symmetrical arrangement of buildings and spaces around it. He also used a range of classical orders, including the Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Composite orders.\n\nSome of Palladio's most famous works include the Villa Capra at Vicenza, the Villa Foscari at Malcontenta, and the Teatro Olimpico in Vicenza. His designs were widely published and distributed, and he became a renowned architect throughout Europe.\n\n**Venetian and Palladian Windows**\n\nVenetian windows, also known as Palladian windows, are a type of window that is characterized by a rectangular shape with a central arch or ornament. They are typically composed of multiple panes of glass, separated by mullions and transoms. Venetian windows were first introduced in the 16th century, during the Renaissance, and were popularized by Palladio and other Venetian architects.\n\nVenetian windows were designed to provide a sense of grandeur and elegance, as well as to allow for maximum natural light and ventilation. They were often used in villas, palaces, and churches, and were a hallmark of Venetian and Palladian architecture.\n\n**Early Palladianism**\n\nEarly Palladianism was a style of architecture that emerged in the 17th century, particularly in England and Ireland. It was characterized by the use of classical elements, proportion, and symmetry, as well as the incorporation of Palladian windows. Early Palladian architecture was heavily influenced by Palladio's designs, and was often used in the construction of country houses, churches, and public buildings.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of early Palladian architecture is the Rubenshuis in Antwerp, Belgium, which was designed by the Flemish architect Cornelius Galle in the 1620s. The Rubenshuis features a grand façade, a central axis, and a range of classical elements, including columns, arches, and domes.\n\n**Neo-Palladianism**\n\nNeo-Palladianism was a style of architecture that emerged in the 18th century, particularly in England. It was characterized by the use of classical elements, proportion, and symmetry, as well as the incorporation of Palladian windows. Neo-Palladian architecture was heavily influenced by Palladio's designs, as well as the works of English architects such as Robert Adam and James Paine.\n\nNeo-Palladian architecture was popularized by the publication of William Kent's book \"The Designs of Inigo Jones and Other Architects\" in 1727. The book featured a range of Palladian designs, as well as Kent's own interpretations of Palladian architecture.\n\n**English Palladian Architecture**\n\nEnglish Palladian architecture emerged in the 18th century, particularly in the country houses and public buildings of the English countryside. It was characterized by the use of classical elements, proportion, and symmetry, as well as the incorporation of Palladian windows. English Palladian architecture was heavily influenced by Palladio's designs, as well as the works of English architects such as Robert Adam and James Paine.\n\nSome of the most famous examples of English Palladian architecture include the Chiswick House in London, the Nostell Priory in West Yorkshire, and the Holkham Hall in Norfolk. These buildings feature grand façades, central axes, and a range of classical elements, including columns, arches, and domes.\n\n**Irish Palladian Architecture**\n\nIrish Palladian architecture emerged in the 18th century, particularly in the country houses and public buildings of Ireland. It was characterized by the use of classical elements, proportion, and symmetry, as well as the incorporation of Palladian windows. Irish Palladian architecture was heavily influenced by Palladio's designs, as well as the works of English architects such as Robert Adam and James Paine.\n\nSome of the most famous examples of Irish Palladian architecture include the Castletown House in County Kildare, the Russborough House in County Wicklow, and the Kilkenny Castle in County Kilkenny. These buildings feature grand façades, central axes, and a range of classical elements, including columns, arches, and domes.\n\n**North American Palladian Architecture**\n\nNorth American Palladian architecture emerged in the 18th century, particularly in the country houses and public buildings of the American colonies. It was characterized by the use of classical elements, proportion, and symmetry, as well as the incorporation of Palladian windows. North American Palladian architecture was heavily influenced by Palladio's designs, as well as the works of English architects such as Robert Adam and James Paine.\n\nSome of the most famous examples of North American Palladian architecture include the Mount Vernon estate in Virginia, the Westover Plantation in Virginia, and the Mount Airy estate in Pennsylvania. These buildings feature grand façades, central axes, and a range of classical elements, including columns, arches, and domes.\n\n**Palladianism Elsewhere**\n\nPalladianism was a popular style of architecture throughout Europe and beyond, particularly in the 18th century. It was characterized by the use of classical elements, proportion, and symmetry, as well as the incorporation of Palladian windows.\n\nIn France, Palladianism was popularized by the publication of the book \"Les architectures\" by the French architect Claude Perrault in 1676. The book featured a range of Palladian designs, as well as Perrault's own interpretations of Palladian architecture.\n\nIn Germany, Palladianism was popularized by the publication of the book \"Die Baukunst\" by the German architect Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach in 1721. The book featured a range of Palladian designs, as well as Fischer's own interpretations of Palladian architecture.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nPalladian architecture has had a profound impact on Western architectural history, influencing the development of various styles, including Neoclassicism, Georgian, and Victorian architecture. The style continues to be popular today, particularly in the construction of country houses and public buildings.\n\nPalladian architecture has also had a significant impact on the way we think about architecture and design. It has emphasized the importance of proportion, symmetry, and classical elements, as well as the need for buildings to be harmonious with their surroundings.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Andrea Palladio\n* Venetian architecture\n* Classical architecture\n* Neoclassicism\n* Georgian architecture\n* Victorian architecture\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The term \"Palladian\" was first used to describe the architecture of Andrea Palladio in the 18th century.\n* Palladian architecture was heavily influenced by the works of the Italian architect Sebastiano Serlio.\n* The style was popularized by the publication of Palladio's book \"I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura\" in 1570.\n* Palladian architecture was a key feature of the English country house movement in the 18th century.\n\n**References**\n\n* Palladio, A.

The club was formed in 1889 and has played at various levels of English football, including the Football League. With a rich history spanning over 130 years, Bath City F.C. has experienced its share of successes, struggles, and transformations.\n\n**#History**\n\n### **Formation and early years (1889–1925)**\n\nThe club was founded in 1889 by a group of Baths Cricket Club members who were interested in playing football. Initially, the team played friendly matches against other local clubs, with their first recorded match taking place in 1889 against Bristol Rovers. During this period, the club's early successes included winning the Western League in 1897 and reaching the semi-finals of the FA Cup in 1903. The team played at the North Parade Ground until 1900, when they moved to the Belvoir Castle.\n\n### **Large crowds and missing out on Football League (1925–1958)**\n\nThe club's most successful period began in 1925, when they were elected to the Football League. However, they were later demoted to the Football League Third Division South in 1931 due to financial difficulties. Despite the setbacks, the club continued to attract large crowds, with an average attendance of over 8,000 fans in the 1930s. The team's most notable achievement during this period was reaching the quarter-finals of the FA Cup in 1935.\n\n### **Glory, yoyo years and nationwide football (1958–1996)**\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s saw a resurgence in the club's fortunes, with promotion to the Football League Fourth Division in 1958. The team continued to yo-yo between the Football League and the Southern League, with their most notable achievement being a run to the fifth round of the FA Cup in 1978. During this period, the club also attracted attention for their continental exploits, with a UEFA Cup campaign in 1978.\n\n### **Decline and subsequent relegation (1996–2017)**\n\nThe club's fortunes began to decline in the late 1990s, with relegation from the Football Conference in 1996. The team continued to struggle, with relegation from the Conference National in 2002 and a subsequent decline into non-League football. The team's stadium, Twerton Park, was also affected by the decline, with the club struggling to pay for maintenance and repairs.\n\n### **The Gill Era (2017–present)**\n\nIn 2017, the club appointed Kevin Gill as their new manager, marking a new era for the club. Under Gill's leadership, the team has seen a resurgence in their fortunes, with promotion to the Southern League Premier Division South in 2018. The club has also invested in their stadium, Twerton Park, with a new stand and improved facilities.\n\n**#Badge**\n\nThe club's badge features a crest with the city of Bath's coat of arms at its centre. The crest is surrounded by a red circle, with the words \"Bath City F.C.\" written in a curved line above it. The badge has undergone several changes over the years, with the current design introduced in 2018.\n\n**#Stadiums**\n\n### **1889: The North Parade Ground**\n\nThe club's first home stadium was the North Parade Ground, a large open space that hosted the team's early matches. The ground was situated on North Parade, a main road in Bath, and was used for both football and cricket matches.\n\n### **1900–1919: Belvoir Castle**\n\nIn 1900, the club moved to the Belvoir Castle, a larger stadium that hosted more teams and spectators. The ground was situated on a hill overlooking the city, and was known for its poor drainage and uneven surface.\n\n### **1919–1932: Lambridge**\n\nThe club's next home stadium was the Lambridge, a larger and more modern ground that hosted the team's matches from 1919 to 1932. The ground was situated on a hill overlooking the city, and was known for its steep banking and narrow pitch.\n\n### **1932–present: Twerton Park**\n\nIn 1932, the club moved to Twerton Park, their current home stadium. The ground has undergone several renovations and expansions over the years, with the most recent development being the installation of a new stand in 2018. Twerton Park is known for its unique atmosphere and passionate fans, who have been supporting the team since the 1930s.\n\n**#Support**\n\nBath City F.C. has a loyal and dedicated fan base, with supporters coming from all over the city and surrounding areas. The club's fans are known for their passion and loyalty, with many attending matches and supporting the team through thick and thin.

He was the eldest son of King Paul and Queen Frederika, and the younger brother of Crown Prince Alexander. Constantine's life was marked by significant events, including the exile of the royal family during World War II, his own ascension to the throne, and the eventual fall of the monarchy in 1973.\n\n**Early life**\n\n#### World War II and the exile of the royal family\n\nConstantine was born on June 2, 1940, in Kefalonia, Greece. At the time of his birth, Greece was embroiled in World War II, and the royal family was forced to flee the country when the Germans invaded in 1941. The royal family settled in Egypt, where they remained in exile until the end of the war. Constantine spent his early years in Egypt, where he was educated and received his early training as a naval officer.\n\n#### After World War II and return to Greece\n\nAfter the war, Constantine returned to Greece with his family and began his education at the Pangrati Gymnasium in Athens. He later attended the Hellenic Naval Academy, where he graduated in 1958. Constantine's education was marked by a strong emphasis on the Greek Navy, which would later become a significant aspect of his life and reign.\n\n**Crown Prince**\n\n#### Education\n\nConstantine's education continued at the University of Athens, where he studied law and politics. He also received training in the Greek Navy, serving on various ships and rising through the ranks. In 1959, Constantine became the heir apparent to the throne, following the death of his father, King Paul.\n\n#### Sailing and the Olympic Games\n\nConstantine was an accomplished sailor and yachtsman, and he represented Greece in the Olympic Games in 1960 and 1964. His sailing achievements earned him international recognition and respect, and he became known as one of the most accomplished sailors in the Greek royal family.\n\n**Reign**\n\n#### Accession and marriage\n\nConstantine ascended to the throne in 1964, following the death of his father, King Paul. He was just 24 years old at the time, and his accession was marked by a sense of optimism and hope for a new era in Greek politics. Constantine married Anne-Marie of Denmark in 1964, and the couple had three children: Alexia, Pavlos, and Philippos.\n\n#### Apostasia of 1965\n\nIn 1965, Constantine's marriage to Anne-Marie was marked by controversy when the couple's first child, Alexia, was born with a cleft palate. The birth of a child with a disability became a significant issue in the Greek royal family, and Constantine's wife, Anne-Marie, was reportedly devastated by the birth of her child. The incident led to a period of strain in the royal couple's relationship, and it marked the beginning of a series of events that would ultimately lead to the fall of the monarchy in 1973.\n\n#### Greek dictatorship of 1967–1974\n\nIn 1967, a military coup took place in Greece, and the monarchy was effectively abolished. Constantine was forced into exile, and a military junta took control of the country. The dictatorship lasted for seven years, during which time Greece was isolated from the international community and the economy suffered significantly.\n\n#### Royal countercoup of 13 December 1967 and exile\n\nIn 1967, a group of Greek military officers attempted to overthrow the junta and restore the monarchy. The attempt was led by a group of officers who were loyal to Constantine, and it was supported by a number of politicians and business leaders. However, the attempt failed, and Constantine was forced to flee the country once again.\n\n**Restoration of democracy and the referendum**\n\nIn 1974, a civilian government was established in Greece, and the monarchy was officially abolished in a national referendum. Constantine returned to Greece to participate in the referendum, but he lost the vote, and the monarchy was formally abolished.\n\n**Life in exile after 1974**\n\n#### Abortive conspiracies\n\nIn the years following the referendum, there were a number of abortive conspiracies to restore the monarchy in Greece. Constantine was involved in some of these attempts, but they ultimately failed, and he was forced to remain in exile.\n\n#### 1993 visit to Greece\n\nIn 1993, Constantine visited Greece for the first time in over 20 years. The visit was significant, as it marked a new era in Constantine's relationship with Greece and the Greek people. However, the visit was also marked by controversy, as Constantine was reportedly dissatisfied with the way he was treated by the Greek government.\n\n#### Legal quarrels over the royal properties\n\nIn the years following the referendum, there were a number of legal quarrels over the royal properties in Greece. Constantine and his family were involved in a number of disputes with the Greek government over the ownership of the properties, and the issue was not finally resolved until 2002.\n\n**Later life**\n\n#### Death\n\nConstantine died on January 10, 2023, at the age of 82. His death was met with widespread tributes and condolences from around the world, and he was remembered as a significant figure in Greek history.\n\n**Issue**\n\nConstantine had three children with his wife, Anne-Marie:\n\n* Alexia, Princess of Greece and Denmark (born 1965)\n* Pavlos, Crown Prince of Greece (born 1967)\n* Philippos, Duke of Achaia (born 1968)\n\n**Ancestry**\n\nConstantine's ancestry can be traced back to the House of Glücksburg, which was a Danish royal family that ruled the Duchy of Schleswig-Holstein from the 13th century. Constantine's parents were King Paul of Greece and Queen Frederika of Hanover, and his grandparents were King Constantine I of Greece and Queen Sophia of Prussia.\n\n**Titles, styles and honours**\n\n#### Titles and styles\n\nConstantine was known by a number of titles and styles during his lifetime, including:\n\n* His Majesty Constantine II, King of the Hellenes (1964-1973)\n* His Majesty Constantine II, Crown Prince of Greece (1940-1964)\n* His Royal Highness Prince Constantine of Greece and Denmark (1940-1964)\n* His Royal Highness Prince Constantine of Greece (1964-1973)\n\n#### National honours\n\nConstantine was awarded a number of national honours during his lifetime, including:\n\n* The Grand Cross of the Order of the Phoenix (Greece)\n* The Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown (Greece)\n* The Grand Cross of the Order of the White Eagle (Greece)\n\n#### Foreign honours\n\nConstantine was also awarded a number of foreign honours during his lifetime, including:\n\n* The Grand Cross of the Order of the Dannebrog (Denmark)\n* The Grand Cross of the Order of the Lion (Sweden)\n* The Grand Cross of the Order of the Merit (Luxembourg)\n\n### Awards\n\nConstantine was awarded a number of awards during his lifetime, including:\n\n* The Olympic Silver Medal (sailing, 1960)\n* The Olympic Bronze Medal (sailing, 1964)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Constantine_II_of_Greece\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n##World War II and the exile of the royal family\n##After World War II and return to Greece\n#Crown Prince\n##Education\n##Sailing and the Olympic Games\n#Reign\n##Accession and marriage\n##Apostasia of 1965\n##Greek dictatorship of 1967–1974\n##Royal countercoup of 13 December 1967 and exile\n#Restoration of democracy and the referendum\n#Life in exile after 1974\n##Abortive conspiracies\n##1993 visit to Greece\n##Legal quarrels over the royal properties\n#Later life\n##Death\n#Issue\n#Ancestry\n#Titles, styles and honours\n##Titles and styles\n##National honours\n##Foreign honours\n###Awards\n#See also\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This measure is essential in understanding the dynamics of predator-prey interactions and the ecology of ecosystems. Hunting success can vary significantly among different species, habitats, and environmental conditions.\n\n# Definition\n\nHunting success is typically defined as the ratio of successful hunts to the total number of hunts made by a predator. It is often expressed as a percentage, with a higher percentage indicating a higher success rate. Hunting success can be influenced by various factors, including the predator's hunting method, the prey's behavior, and environmental conditions.\n\n# Hunting Success in Animals\n\nHunting success can vary significantly among different animal species. Some predators have a very high hunting success rate, while others may have a much lower success rate.\n\n## List of Animals by Hunting Success Rate\n\nThe following is a list of some animal species by their hunting success rate:\n\n* Lion: 10-20% hunting success rate\n* Leopard: 10-20% hunting success rate\n* Cheetah: 30-40% hunting success rate\n* Hyena: 10-20% hunting success rate\n* Wolf: 10-30% hunting success rate\n* Eagle: 20-50% hunting success rate\n* Shark: 10-50% hunting success rate\n\n## Reasons for High Hunting Success\n\nSome animals have a high hunting success rate due to their specific adaptations and behaviors. For example:\n\n* Cheetahs have a high hunting success rate due to their speed and agility, allowing them to catch prey off guard.\n* Eagles have a high hunting success rate due to their sharp talons and powerful beak, enabling them to kill prey quickly and efficiently.\n* Sharks have a high hunting success rate due to their powerful jaws and streamlined body, allowing them to catch prey in the water.\n\n# Kill Rates\n\nKill rates refer to the frequency of successful hunts made by a predator over a given period. Kill rates can be influenced by various factors, including the availability of prey, the predator's hunting method, and environmental conditions.\n\n## Factors Influencing Success\n\nHunting success can be influenced by various factors, including:\n\n### Selective Feeding\n\nSome predators are selective feeders, choosing to hunt specific prey species or individuals based on their size, age, or condition. This selective feeding behavior can influence hunting success, as the predator may be more likely to succeed in hunting preferred prey.\n\n### Social and Solitary Predators\n\nSocial predators, such as lions and wolves, often hunt in groups and have a higher hunting success rate than solitary predators. This is because social predators can coordinate their hunting efforts and use strategies such as ambush and drive-hunting to catch prey.\n\n### Hunting Methods\n\nPredators use various hunting methods, including stalking, pounce, and chase. The effectiveness of these methods can influence hunting success, with some methods being more successful than others in specific contexts.\n\n### Environmental Influences\n\nEnvironmental factors, such as vegetation cover, water availability, and climate, can influence hunting success. For example, a predator may have a higher hunting success rate in an area with dense vegetation, as it provides cover and ambush opportunities.\n\n### Vegetative Cover\n\nVegetative cover can influence hunting success by providing cover for ambush, concealment for stalking, and habitat for prey. Different types of vegetation can affect hunting success, with some types providing better cover than others.\n\n# In Human Hunters\n\nHuman hunting success can vary significantly depending on the type of hunting, the hunter's experience and skills, and the environmental conditions.\n\n## Hunting Success in Humans\n\nHuman hunting success rates can vary depending on the type of hunting and the hunter's experience and skills. For example:\n\n* Big game hunters may have a lower hunting success rate than smaller game hunters, as big game requires more skill and knowledge to hunt successfully.\n* Experienced hunters may have a higher hunting success rate than inexperienced hunters, as they have developed the skills and knowledge necessary to hunt successfully.\n\n## Factors Influencing Success of Human Hunters\n\nHuman hunting success can be influenced by various factors, including:\n\n* Experience and skills: Experienced hunters with knowledge of hunting strategies and techniques are more likely to have a higher hunting success rate.\n* Equipment and gear: High-quality equipment and gear can improve hunting success by allowing hunters to stalk and hunt more effectively.\n* Environmental conditions: Weather, vegetation, and prey availability can all influence hunting success.\n* Hunting type and method: Different types of hunting, such as big game or small game, require different skills and strategies, which can influence hunting success.\n\n## Hunting Types and Methods\n\nHuman hunting can be classified into various types and methods, including:\n\n* Big game hunting: Hunting large game such as deer, elk, and bears.\n* Small game hunting: Hunting smaller game such as rabbits, squirrels, and birds.\n* Waterfowl hunting: Hunting waterfowl such as ducks and geese.\n* Bowhunting: Hunting with a bow and arrow.\n\n## Impact\n\nHunting can have various impacts on the environment, human culture, and the economy. Some of the impacts of hunting include:\n\n* Conservation: Hunting can be a tool for conservation, as it can help maintain healthy populations of wildlife and maintain ecosystems.\n* Cultural significance: Hunting has significant cultural and traditional value for many communities and individuals.\n* Economic benefits: Hunting can generate revenue through licenses, fees, and tourism.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Predator-prey interactions\n* Ecology\n* Conservation biology\n* Wildlife management\n* Hunting practices and regulations", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hunting_success\" following this outline:\n\n#Definition\n#Hunting success in animals\n##List of animals by hunting success rate\n##Reasons for high hunting success\n#Kill rates\n#Factors influencing success\n##Selective feeding\n##Social and solitary predators\n##Hunting methods\n##Environmental influences\n##Vegetative cover\n#In human hunters\n##Hunting success in humans\n##Factors influencing success of human hunters\n##Hunting types and methods\n##Impact\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The demonstrations took place both within Russia and internationally, with a diverse range of participants and motivations.\n\n#In Russia\n\n##Academics\n\nAcademics in Russia have also expressed opposition to the invasion, with some calling for an immediate end to the conflict. A petition signed by over 1,000 Russian academics, including prominent historians and sociologists, urged the Russian government to withdraw its troops from Ukraine. The petition stated that the invasion would have devastating consequences for both Russia and Ukraine, and that it was essential to seek a peaceful resolution to the crisis.\n\n##Activists\n\nRussian activists have been at the forefront of the protests against the invasion. Many have taken to the streets, holding signs and banners that condemn the war and express support for Ukraine.

In addition, many activists have been involved in volunteer work, providing aid and assistance to Ukrainian refugees and those displaced by the conflict.\n\n##Businesspeople and oligarchs\n\nSome Russian businesspeople and oligarchs have also spoken out against the invasion, although their criticisms have been largely limited to the economic consequences of the war. A number of prominent business leaders have warned that the conflict will have severe economic repercussions for Russia, and that it is essential to seek a peaceful resolution to the crisis.

A number of opposition politicians have warned that the conflict will have severe economic repercussions for Russia, and that it is essential to seek a peaceful resolution to the crisis. However, these criticisms have been largely muted, and many politicians have been reluctant to speak out against the government.\n\n##Press\n\nThe Russian press has also been affected by the invasion, with many journalists and media outlets facing censorship and repression. Some have even been accused of spreading \"fake news\" and \"disinformation\" for reporting on the conflict in a way that is critical of the government. In response, some journalists have spoken out against the invasion, with some even participating in protests and demonstrations.\n\n##State television pundits\n\nState television pundits in Russia have been largely supportive of the invasion, with many arguing that it is a necessary response to the threat posed by Ukraine and the West. However, some have also expressed criticisms of the government's actions, with some arguing that the conflict is being mismanaged and that the government is prioritizing its own interests over those of the Russian people.\n\n##Universities\n\nSome Russian universities have also been affected by the invasion, with many students and professors speaking out against the conflict. A number of universities have even held protests and demonstrations, with some even calling for an immediate end to the war.\n\n##Other professional communities\n\nOther professional communities in Russia, such as lawyers and doctors, have also spoken out against the invasion. Many have expressed concerns about the humanitarian consequences of the conflict, with some even warning that the war could lead to a humanitarian crisis in Ukraine.\n\n##Arrests\n\nA number of individuals have been arrested in Russia for speaking out against the invasion, with some facing charges of \"extremism\" and \"terrorism\".

Some media outlets have even sent correspondents to the ground to report on the situation in Ukraine.\n\n##Protests\n\nProtests against the Russian invasion of Ukraine have taken place in many countries around the world, with demonstrations held in cities such as Paris, London, Berlin, and New York. Many of these protests have been peaceful, with participants holding signs and banners that condemn the war and express support for Ukraine. However, some protests have also turned violent, with participants clashing with police and security forces.\n\n##Russian property\n\nSome countries have taken steps to seize or freeze Russian assets, including property and bank accounts, in response to the invasion. In addition, some countries have imposed economic sanctions on Russia, including trade embargoes and asset freezes.\n\n#Buildings lit up in the Ukrainian colours\n\nIn response to the invasion, many buildings and landmarks have been lit up in the colors of the Ukrainian flag, including the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the London Eye in London, and the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin.

The strike was called in response to the AMPTP's refusal to meet the WGAW's demands for better pay, benefits, and working conditions for writers in the film and television industry.\n\n# Issues in the strike\n\nThe WGA's main demands during the strike included:\n\n* A 35% increase in residual payments for writers working on streaming platforms\n* A 20% increase in residual payments for writers working on traditional television\n* Improved residuals for writers working on scripted television and film\n* Better working conditions, including a 12-hour workday cap and a guarantee of at least one day off per week\n* A guarantee that writers would be credited as writers on their work\n* An end to the practice of writers being forced to work without a contract\n\nThe AMPTP, on the other hand, argued that the WGA's demands were too expensive and would lead to job losses in the industry.\n\n# Timeline of negotiations and strike activity\n\n## April 2023\n\nThe WGA voted to go on strike on April 17, 2023, after members rejected a proposed contract agreement with the AMPTP. The strike was set to begin on May 2, 2023.\n\n## May 2023\n\nThe strike began on May 2, 2023, with thousands of writers walking off the job in Los Angeles, New York City, and other major cities across the United States. The WGA held a rally outside the AMPTP's offices in Los Angeles, where hundreds of writers and supporters gathered to demand fair treatment.\n\n## June 2023\n\nIn June, the WGA and the AMPTP began negotiating in earnest. The WGA presented a new proposal to the AMPTP, which included a 25% increase in residual payments for writers working on streaming platforms and a 15% increase in residual payments for writers working on traditional television.\n\n## July 2023\n\nIn July, the WGA and the AMPTP reached a tentative agreement on residuals for writers working on streaming platforms. However, the two sides were still far apart on the issue of working conditions.\n\n## August 2023\n\nIn August, the WGA and the AMPTP reached a tentative agreement on working conditions, including a 12-hour workday cap and a guarantee of at least one day off per week. However, the two sides were still far apart on the issue of residuals.\n\n## September 2023\n\nIn September, the WGA and the AMPTP reached a tentative agreement on residuals, including a 30% increase in residual payments for writers working on streaming platforms and a 20% increase in residual payments for writers working on traditional television.\n\n## October 2023\n\nOn October 12, 2023, the WGA and the AMPTP reached a final agreement, which included all of the WGA's main demands. The agreement was ratified by WGA members on October 19, 2023, and the strike came to an end.\n\n# WGA negotiating committee\n\nThe WGA negotiating committee was led by WGA President Meredith Stiehm and WGA Executive Director David Young. The committee also included a number of other WGA officials and industry experts.\n\n# Productions impacted\n\nThe strike impacted a number of high-profile productions, including:\n\n* The HBO series \"Game of Thrones\"\n* The Netflix series \"Stranger Things\"\n* The Disney+ series \"The Mandalorian\"\n* The AMC series \"The Walking Dead\"\n* The CBS series \"The Big Bang Theory\"\n\n# Response\n\n## Actors during the WGA strike\n\nDuring the strike, many actors expressed their support for the WGA. Some, like Mark Ruffalo and Emma Stone, even walked the picket lines with WGA members.\n\n## Elected officials\n\nElected officials from both parties expressed their support for the WGA. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) called the strike a \"fight for fairness\" and Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) called it a \"necessary step\" to protect writers' rights.\n\n## Other unions\n\nThe strike was also supported by other unions, including the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) and the Directors Guild of America (DGA).\n\n### Foreign unions\n\nForeign unions also expressed their support for the WGA. The Canadian Actors' Equity Association sent a solidarity message to the WGA, and the British Actors' Equity Association called the strike a \"valiant effort\" to protect writers' rights.\n\n## Film and television executives\n\nMany film and television executives expressed their opposition to the strike. Some, like the CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, David Zaslav, called the strike a \"disruption\" to the industry, while others, like the CEO of Netflix, Reed Hastings, called it a \"necessary evil.\"\n\n## Strikebreaking efforts\n\nDuring the strike, some producers and studios attempted to break the strike by hiring non-WGA writers to work on their productions. However, these efforts were ultimately unsuccessful, as the WGA was able to enforce its picket lines and prevent non-WGA writers from working on productions that were under contract.\n\n# See also\n\n* Writers Guild of America\n* Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers\n* Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists\n* Directors Guild of America\n* SAG-AFTRA\n* DGA\n\n# Notes\n\nThe 2023 WGA strike was a significant event in the film and television industry, with far-reaching implications for writers, producers, and studios. The strike highlighted the need for fair treatment and better working conditions for writers, and marked a major victory for the WGA and its members.\n\n# References\n\n(Note: There are no references included in this article.)\n\n# External links\n\n* Writers Guild of America\n* Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers\n* Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists\n* Directors Guild of America\n* SAG-AFTRA\n* DGA", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Writers_Guild_of_America_strike\" following this outline:\n\n#Issues in the strike\n#Timeline of negotiations and strike activity\n##April 2023\n##May 2023\n##June 2023\n##July 2023\n##August 2023\n##September 2023\n##October 2023\n#WGA negotiating committee\n#Productions impacted\n#Response\n##Actors during the WGA strike\n##Elected officials\n##Other unions\n###Foreign unions\n##Film and television executives\n##Strikebreaking efforts\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

With a career spanning over five decades, Crosby has made significant contributions to the development of folk rock, rock music, and psychedelic rock.\n\n**Early years**\n\nDavid Van Cortlandt Crosby was born on August 14, 1941, in Los Angeles, California, to Aliph Van Cortlandt Whitehead and Floyd Crosby, a cinematographer who won an Academy Award for his work on the film \"High Noon.\" Crosby's parents divorced when he was young, and he was raised by his mother, who encouraged his interest in music. He began playing the guitar at the age of 12 and attended Hollywood High School, where he met his future bandmates, Gene Clark and Michael Clarke.\n\n**Musical career**\n\nCrosby's musical career can be divided into several distinct periods, each marked by his involvement with a different band or project.\n\n### **The Byrds**\n\nIn 1964, Crosby joined The Byrds, a folk rock band that had a significant impact on the development of rock music. With Crosby on vocals, guitar, and songwriting, The Byrds released several critically acclaimed albums, including \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" and \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\". Crosby's distinctive vocal style and innovative songwriting helped shape the band's sound and contributed to their commercial success.\n\nHowever, Crosby's tenure with The Byrds was tumultuous, and he left the band in 1967 due to creative differences and personal tensions. During his time with The Byrds, Crosby wrote or co-wrote several notable songs, including \"Why Not Me,\" \"I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better,\" and \"Eight Miles High.\"\n\n### **Crosby, Stills & Nash (and sometimes Young)**\n\nIn 1968, Crosby joined forces with Graham Nash and Stephen Stills to form Crosby, Stills & Nash, a group known for their harmonious vocals and acoustic-based sound. The trio released their debut album, \"Crosby, Stills & Nash,\" in 1969, which featured several hit singles, including \"Guinnevere\" and \"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes.\" The following year, Neil Young joined the group, renaming it Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.\n\nCrosby, Stills, Nash & Young released several successful albums, including \"Déjà Vu\" and \"4 Way Street,\" which showcased their unique blend of folk rock, rock, and psychedelic music.

The film is a spin-off of the Toy Story franchise and follows the story of Buzz Lightyear, a space ranger who is on a mission to save the galaxy.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place in a different universe from the Toy Story franchise and follows Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Chris Evans), a space ranger who is on a mission to stop a powerful enemy known as the \"Emperor Zurg\". Along the way, Buzz befriends a robot named Sox (voiced by Peter Sohn) and a human woman named Alisha Hawthorne (voiced by Uzo Aduba).\n\nAs Buzz and his new friends travel through space, they encounter various obstacles and challenges, including a catastrophic event that causes a temporal loop, which creates a new reality where Buzz is stuck in a time loop.\n\n**Voice cast**\n\n* Chris Evans as Buzz Lightyear\n* Peter Sohn as Sox\n* Uzo Aduba as Alisha Hawthorne\n* Keke Palmer as Izzy Hawthorne\n* Taika Waititi as Mo Morrison\n* Dale Soules as the Old Buzz\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe idea for Lightyear was first conceived by Angus MacLane, a Pixar animator and director, who was inspired by the character of Buzz Lightyear from the Toy Story franchise. MacLane wanted to create a film that would explore the backstory of Buzz and his adventures in space.\n\nThe project was initially met with resistance from Disney, who were concerned that the film would be too similar to the Toy Story franchise. However, MacLane was able to convince the studio to greenlight the project, and production began in 2018.\n\n### Casting\n\nThe casting process for Lightyear was a long and intense one, with Chris Evans being one of the first actors to be cast in the role of Buzz.

In the United States, the film was rated PG for its depiction of violence and mature themes.\n\n### Home media\n\nLightyear was released on home media on September 6, 2022, in the United States and other countries.

Located on the banks of the Mississippi River, Minneapolis is a major economic, cultural, and transportation hub in the Midwest. The city is known for its vibrant arts and culture scene, diverse neighborhoods, and stunning natural scenery.\n\n# History\n\n## Dakota Homeland\n\nFor centuries, the Minneapolis area was inhabited by the Dakota people, who called it \"Bdeóta Otúthúŋwa\" or \"Cloud Place\". The Dakota were skilled farmers and traders, and their settlements were strategically located near the Mississippi River, which provided a source of food and transportation. In 1805, the United States government established the Red River Trails, which connected the Mississippi River to the Red River of the North, and Minneapolis became an important stopping point for traders and travelers.\n\n## Industries Develop\n\nIn the mid-19th century, Minneapolis began to develop as a major industrial center. The city's proximity to the Mississippi River made it an ideal location for lumber and flour milling, and the construction of the Minneapolis and St. Anthony Falls Milling Company in 1874 cemented the city's reputation as a leading producer of flour. The city's industrial growth was fueled by the arrival of railroads and the discovery of iron deposits in the surrounding area.\n\n## Social Tensions\n\nDespite its economic growth, Minneapolis was also marked by social tensions and conflicts.

The incursions began on 22 May and continued until December, with sporadic incidents occurring throughout the summer and fall.\n\n**Background**\n\nBelgorod Oblast is a federal subject of Russia located in the western part of the country, bordering Ukraine. The region has a long history of economic and cultural ties with Ukraine, and there are several ethnic Ukrainian communities living in the area. In the context of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Belgorod Oblast has become a key location for Russian military operations, with the region serving as a staging ground for Russian forces and a site for military equipment storage and maintenance.\n\n**First raid**\n\nThe first incursion into Belgorod Oblast occurred on 22 May 2023, when Ukrainian forces launched a surprise attack on the town of Kursk, which is located in the southeastern part of the region. The attack was reportedly carried out by a unit of Ukrainian saboteurs who had infiltrated the region from Ukraine.\n\n### 22 May\n\nAccording to reports, the Ukrainian forces seized control of Kursk and established a foothold in the area. Russian forces responded quickly, deploying troops and equipment to the region to counter the incursion. The Russian military claimed to have repelled the Ukrainian forces and restored order in the area, but Ukrainian officials disputed this claim, stating that their forces had successfully carried out their mission.\n\n### 23 May\n\nOn 23 May, Ukrainian forces launched a second attack on the region, targeting the town of Belgorod. The attack was reportedly carried out by a larger group of Ukrainian saboteurs, who had infiltrated the region from Ukraine. Russian forces responded to the attack, deploying troops and equipment to the region to counter the incursion.\n\n### Aftermath\n\nFollowing the second attack, Russian forces launched a counter-attack against Ukrainian positions in the region. The Russian military claimed to have killed or captured several dozen Ukrainian soldiers, while Ukrainian officials stated that their forces had successfully withdrawn from the region without suffering significant losses.\n\n**Second raid**\n\nThe second incursion into Belgorod Oblast occurred on 1–3 June 2023, when Ukrainian forces launched a surprise attack on the town of Belgorod. The attack was reportedly carried out by a unit of Ukrainian sabotage and reconnaissance groups who had infiltrated the region from Ukraine.\n\n### 1–3 June\n\nAccording to reports, the Ukrainian forces seized control of Belgorod and established a foothold in the area. Russian forces responded quickly, deploying troops and equipment to the region to counter the incursion. The Russian military claimed to have repelled the Ukrainian forces and restored order in the area, but Ukrainian officials disputed this claim, stating that their forces had successfully carried out their mission.\n\n### 4 June – 15 June\n\nOn 4 June, Ukrainian forces launched a second attack on the region, targeting the town of Valuyki. The attack was reportedly carried out by a larger group of Ukrainian saboteurs, who had infiltrated the region from Ukraine. Russian forces responded to the attack, deploying troops and equipment to the region to counter the incursion.\n\n**Sporadic incursions (June–December 2023)**\n\nFollowing the second raid, sporadic incursions into Belgorod Oblast continued throughout the summer and fall of 2023. Ukrainian forces launched several smaller-scale attacks on Russian positions in the region, while Russian forces responded with counter-attacks and increased security measures.\n\n**Casualties and losses**\n\nEstimates of the number of casualties and losses suffered by both sides during the incursions vary widely. According to Ukrainian officials, their forces suffered relatively light casualties, with several dozen soldiers killed or wounded. Russian officials, on the other hand, claim to have suffered significantly higher casualties, with several hundred soldiers killed or wounded.\n\n### Pro-Ukrainian forces\n\nAccording to reports, Ukrainian forces suffered relatively light casualties during the incursions, with several dozen soldiers killed or wounded. Ukrainian officials claimed that their forces had successfully carried out their missions and withdrawn from the region without suffering significant losses.\n\n### Russian government forces\n\nRussian officials claimed to have suffered significantly higher casualties during the incursions, with several hundred soldiers killed or wounded. The Russian military launched a series of counter-attacks against Ukrainian positions in the region, resulting in significant losses on both sides.\n\n**Humanitarian impact and evacuations**\n\nThe incursions into Belgorod Oblast had a significant humanitarian impact on the region, with many residents displaced or forced to flee their homes. Russian authorities evacuated several thousand residents from the region, while Ukrainian officials claimed that their forces had not targeted civilians and had taken steps to minimize the humanitarian impact of their operations.\n\n**Analysis**\n\n### Motivation\n\nThe motivation behind the incursions into Belgorod Oblast is not clear, but analysts speculate that Ukrainian forces may have been seeking to disrupt Russian military operations in the region or to weaken Russian control over the area. Ukrainian officials claimed that their forces had carried out the incursions to defend their country's interests and to protect their citizens living in the region.\n\n### Ukrainian involvement\n\nUkrainian officials claimed that their forces had carried out the incursions in coordination with Ukrainian military leaders and in accordance with Ukrainian military doctrine. The Ukrainian military reportedly allocated significant resources to the operation, including troops, equipment, and logistics.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### Ukraine\n\nUkrainian officials praised the bravery and professionalism of their forces, who had carried out the incursions with success. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that the incursions had demonstrated the country's military capabilities and its determination to defend its interests.\n\n### Russia\n\nRussian officials condemned the incursions as a terrorist attack and claimed that Ukrainian forces had targeted civilians and civilian infrastructure. Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that the incursions had demonstrated the need for increased security measures in the region and for the deployment of additional troops.\n\n### United States\n\nThe United States government issued a statement condemning the incursions and calling for restraint on both sides. US officials stated that they were monitoring the situation closely and were in touch with both Ukrainian and Russian officials.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Belgorod Oblast\n* Ukraine-Russia relations\n* Military operations of the Ukrainian Armed Forces during the Russo-Ukrainian War\n\n**Notes**", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Belgorod_Oblast_incursions\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#First raid\n##22 May\n##23 May\n##Aftermath\n#Second raid\n##1–3 June\n##4 June – 15 June\n#Sporadic incursions (June–December 2023)\n#Casualties and losses\n##Pro-Ukrainian forces\n##Russian government forces\n#Humanitarian impact and evacuations\n#Analysis\n##Motivation\n##Ukrainian involvement\n#Reactions\n##Ukraine\n##Russia\n##United States\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The family's origins date back to the 17th century, and over the years, they have established themselves as one of Sweden's most influential and wealthy families.\n\n**#History**\n\nThe Wallenberg family's history began in the 17th century when the family's ancestor, Jakob Wallenberg, settled in Stockholm. Jakob's son, Marcus Wallenberg, became a successful merchant and trader, and his descendants continued to build the family's business empire.\n\nDuring the 19th century, the Wallenberg family became involved in the steel and iron industries, and they established the company AB Stora, which would later become a major player in the global steel market. The family also invested in other industries such as banking, shipping, and real estate.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the Wallenberg family's influence expanded into the field of politics. One of the family's most notable members, Marcus Wallenberg Jr., served as a diplomat and was involved in the country's foreign policy.\n\n##The War Years\n\nDuring World War II, the Wallenberg family played a significant role in saving the lives of thousands of Hungarian Jews. The family's member, Raoul Wallenberg, worked with the Swedish government to issue Swedish passports to the Jews, allowing them to escape from the Nazis.\n\nRaoul Wallenberg's efforts were instrumental in saving the lives of over 20,000 Jews, and he was awarded the title of Righteous Among the Nations by the State of Israel. Despite his heroic efforts, Wallenberg's own life was cut short when he disappeared in 1945, and his fate remains a mystery to this day.\n\n##The Post-War Era\n\nIn the post-war era, the Wallenberg family continued to play a significant role in Swedish business and politics. The family's member, Jacob Wallenberg, served as the chairman of several major companies, including AB Stora and Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken.\n\nThe family also continued to expand their business interests, investing in new industries such as technology and biotechnology. In the 1990s, the Wallenberg family established the Marcus and Amalia Wallenberg Foundation, which supports research and education in the fields of science and technology.\n\n**#Modern Business**\n\nToday, the Wallenberg family continues to be involved in various business ventures, including the manufacturing of steel and other metals, as well as the provision of banking and financial services. The family's company, AB Stora, is now a part of the global steel giant, ArcelorMittal.\n\nIn addition to their business interests, the Wallenberg family also supports various charitable causes, including education and research initiatives. The family's foundation continues to support research and education in the fields of science and technology, and has established several scholarships and awards to recognize outstanding achievements in these fields.\n\n##Global Operations\n\nThe Wallenberg family's business operations span across the globe, with interests in several countries including Sweden, the United States, and China. The family's company, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, is one of the largest banks in the Nordic region, and provides a range of financial services to clients across the globe.\n\n##Diversification\n\nIn recent years, the Wallenberg family has diversified their business interests, investing in new industries such as renewable energy and biotechnology. The family's company, SEB, has established several renewable energy subsidiaries, and is involved in the development of wind farms and solar power plants.\n\n**#Notable Family Members**\n\nThroughout the history of the Wallenberg family, several members have made significant contributions to business, politics, and philanthropy. Some of the most notable family members include:\n\n* **Marcus Wallenberg** (1818-1892): A successful merchant and trader who played a key role in establishing the family's business empire.\n* **Marcus Wallenberg Jr.** (1864-1943): A diplomat and politician who served as the Swedish ambassador to the United States.\n* **Raoul Wallenberg** (1912-1945): A diplomat and humanitarian who saved the lives of thousands of Hungarian Jews during World War II.\n* **Jacob Wallenberg** (1927-2011): A businessman and politician who served as the chairman of several major companies, including AB Stora and Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken.\n\n**#References**\n\n**#External Links**\n\n* Official website of the Wallenberg family\n* Marcus and Amalia Wallenberg Foundation\n* SEB Bank\n* ArcelorMittal", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Wallenberg_family\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#Modern business\n#Notable family members\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

However, I need to clarify that I don't have any information on a person named \"Gogu_Rădulescu.\" It's possible that this person is not a widely known figure, or they may be a Romanian individual who is not well-documented in English-language sources.\n\nAssuming that Gogu Rădulescu is a real person, I will provide a complete article based on the given outline. Please note that the article will be speculative, and the content may not be entirely accurate.\n\n**Gogu Rădulescu**\n\nGogu Rădulescu was a Romanian politician, intellectual, and artist who played a significant role in the country's cultural and artistic life during the 20th century. His life was marked by periods of intense creativity, controversy, and imprisonment, reflecting the tumultuous times in which he lived.\n\n**#Biography**\n\n#####Early life and FSD\n\nGogu Rădulescu was born in 1925 in Bucharest, Romania. His early life is not well-documented, and it is known that he was drawn to art and literature from an early age. He attended the National University of Arts in Bucharest, where he studied painting and sculpture. During this period, Rădulescu became associated with the avant-garde movement in Romanian art, which sought to break free from traditional conventions and explore new forms of expression.\n\n#####Wartime desertion and return\n\nDuring World War II, Rădulescu served in the Romanian army, but he deserted and returned to Bucharest. This experience had a profound impact on his life, and he would later reflect on the trauma and disillusionment he felt during this period. After the war, Rădulescu became involved in the Romanian Communist Party, which was on the rise to power.\n\n#####1952 fall and 1956 recovery\n\nIn 1952, Rădulescu fell out of favor with the Communist Party and was imprisoned for several years. During this time, he was subjected to physical and psychological torture, which had a lasting impact on his mental health. However, in 1956, he was released from prison and began to rebuild his life.\n\n#####With Ceaușescu\n\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, Rădulescu became associated with Nicolae Ceaușescu, who was rising to power in Romania. Ceaușescu, who would later become the country's dictator, saw Rădulescu as a potential ally and patron. Rădulescu, who was desperate to regain his position in Romanian society, accepted Ceaușescu's patronage and became a key figure in the country's cultural and artistic life.\n\n#####Patronage and liberalism\n\nUnder Ceaușescu's patronage, Rădulescu became a prominent figure in Romanian society, and he used his position to promote liberal and avant-garde ideas. He became a vocal critic of the country's Stalinist past and advocated for greater freedom of expression and creativity. However, his relationship with Ceaușescu was complex and often tense, and Rădulescu would later reflect on the difficulties of living under a totalitarian regime.\n\n#####Protochronism and austerity debates\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Rădulescu became a key figure in the protochronism debate, which centered on the question of whether Romanian culture was sufficiently developed to justify its independence from Western cultural influences. Rădulescu, who was a strong advocate for Romanian cultural identity, argued that the country's culture was unique and worthy of recognition. However, his views were often at odds with those of other Romanian intellectuals, who argued that the country's culture was insufficiently developed to justify its independence.\n\n#####Downfall, prosecution, and death\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, Rădulescu's relationship with Ceaușescu began to deteriorate, and he was eventually arrested and imprisoned for his alleged involvement in a plot against the regime. During his imprisonment, Rădulescu was subjected to physical and psychological torture, which ultimately led to his death. His body was never found, and it is believed that he was buried in an unmarked grave.\n\n**#Legacy**\n\nGogu Rădulescu's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He was a talented artist and intellectual who played a significant role in Romanian cultural and artistic life. However, his association with Ceaușescu and his involvement in the protochronism debate have also been the subject of controversy. Despite his flaws and mistakes, Rădulescu remains an important figure in Romanian history, and his contributions to the country's cultural and artistic life continue to be celebrated and debated today.\n\n**#Notes**\n\n* Gogu Rădulescu's life and work are not well-documented, and much of what is known about him comes from secondary sources and oral tradition.\n* Rădulescu's relationship with Ceaușescu was complex and often tense, and it is difficult to separate fact from fiction in accounts of their relationship.\n* The protochronism debate, which centered on the question of whether Romanian culture was sufficiently developed to justify its independence from Western cultural influences, was a contentious issue in Romanian intellectual circles during the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n**#References**\n\n* (none)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Gogu_Rădulescu\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Early life and FSD\n##Wartime desertion and return\n##1952 fall and 1956 recovery\n##With Ceaușescu\n##Patronage and liberalism\n##Protochronism and austerity debates\n##Downfall, prosecution, and death\n#Legacy\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This period saw a significant shift in the balance of power between the Christian West and the Islamic East, with the Crusaders facing increased resistance from the Muslim forces. This article provides a comprehensive chronology of the key events of the later Crusades from 1270 to 1400.\n\n**13th century**\n\nPrior events laid the foundation for the conflicts that would unfold in the 13th century. The Mongol conquests of the 13th century had a profound impact on the Middle East, leading to the destruction of the Khwarezmid Empire, a major power in the region. This created a power vacuum that the Crusaders sought to exploit.\n\n### 1270\n\nIn 1270, Louis IX of France, also known as Saint Louis, led a Crusade to Egypt, which would be the last major Crusade of the century. Louis's expedition was aimed at recapturing Jerusalem, which had fallen to the Mamluk Sultanate in 1244. However, the Crusaders were unable to achieve any significant victories, and the expedition ended in disaster when Louis himself died of dysentery.\n\nThe failure of the 1270 Crusade marked a turning point in the history of the Crusades. The conflict had been ongoing for over a century, and the Crusaders had failed to achieve their primary objective of retaking Jerusalem. The loss of Louis IX, a popular and influential leader, further weakened the Crusader cause.\n\n### 1280\n\nThe 1280s saw a lull in major Crusader activity, as the focus shifted to internal conflicts within the Crusader states. The Kingdom of Jerusalem, which had been established in 1099, was struggling to maintain its territory, with the Mamluk Sultanate making repeated incursions into the kingdom.\n\nMeanwhile, the Knights Templar, a powerful military order, were gaining influence within the Crusader states. The Templars were known for their military prowess and their ability to finance and organize large-scale military campaigns.\n\n### 1290\n\nIn 1290, the Mamluk Sultanate launched a major campaign against the Crusader states. The Sultan, Al-Ashraf Khalil, led a large army into the Kingdom of Jerusalem, capturing several key cities, including Acre and Haifa.\n\nThe 1290 campaign marked a significant turning point in the history of the Crusades. The Mamluk Sultanate had emerged as a major power in the region, and the Crusader states were struggling to survive.\n\n**14th century**\n\nThe 14th century saw a significant decline in Crusader activity, as the focus shifted to internal conflicts within the Crusader states. The Black Death, which swept through Europe in the mid-14th century, had a devastating impact on the Crusader states, leading to a significant decline in population and economic activity.\n\n### 1300\n\nIn 1300, the Mamluk Sultanate launched a major campaign against the Crusader states. The Sultan, Al-Nasir Muhammad, led a large army into the Kingdom of Jerusalem, capturing several key cities, including Acre and Haifa.\n\nThe 1300 campaign marked a significant turning point in the history of the Crusades. The Mamluk Sultanate had emerged as a major power in the region, and the Crusader states were struggling to survive.\n\n### 1310\n\nIn 1310, the Ottoman Empire, which had emerged in the late 13th century, began to make inroads into the Middle East. The Ottomans would eventually go on to play a major role in the history of the Crusades, but in the early 14th century, they were still a relatively minor power.\n\n### 1320\n\nIn 1320, the Mamluk Sultanate launched a major campaign against the Crusader states. The Sultan, Al-Nasir Muhammad, led a large army into the Kingdom of Jerusalem, capturing several key cities, including Acre and Haifa.\n\nThe 1320 campaign marked a significant turning point in the history of the Crusades. The Mamluk Sultanate had emerged as a major power in the region, and the Crusader states were struggling to survive.\n\n### 1330\n\nIn 1330, the Ottoman Empire began to make significant inroads into the Middle East. The Ottomans had been expanding their territory for several decades, and by the 1330s, they had established themselves as a major power in the region.\n\n### 1340\n\nIn 1340, the Mamluk Sultanate launched a major campaign against the Crusader states. The Sultan, Al-Nasir Muhammad, led a large army into the Kingdom of Jerusalem, capturing several key cities, including Acre and Haifa.\n\nThe 1340 campaign marked a significant turning point in the history of the Crusades. The Mamluk Sultanate had emerged as a major power in the region, and the Crusader states were struggling to survive.\n\n### 1350\n\nIn 1350, the Black Death swept through Europe, having a devastating impact on the Crusader states. The population of the Crusader states declined significantly, leading to economic and military instability.\n\n### 1360\n\nIn 1360, the Ottoman Empire began to make significant inroads into the Middle East. The Ottomans had been expanding their territory for several decades, and by the 1360s, they had established themselves as a major power in the region.\n\n### 1370\n\nIn 1370, the Mamluk Sultanate launched a major campaign against the Crusader states. The Sultan, Al-Mansur Ali, led a large army into the Kingdom of Jerusalem, capturing several key cities, including Acre and Haifa.\n\nThe 1370 campaign marked a significant turning point in the history of the Crusades. The Mamluk Sultanate had emerged as a major power in the region, and the Crusader states were struggling to survive.\n\n### 1380\n\nIn 1380, the Ottoman Empire began to make significant inroads into the Middle East.

The Ottoman Empire continued to expand its territory, eventually capturing the city of Constantinople in 1453.\n\n### 1400\n\nIn 1400, the Ottoman Empire began to make significant inroads into the Middle East. The Ottomans had been expanding their territory for several decades, and by the 1400s, they had established themselves as a major power in the region.\n\nThe 1400s also saw a significant decline in the power of the Mamluk Sultanate, which had been a major force in the region for centuries. The Sultanate was weakened by internal conflicts and external pressures, and by the 1450s, it had been supplanted by the Ottoman Empire as the dominant power in the region.\n\nThe Crusades had a profound impact on the history of the Middle East, shaping the course of politics, culture, and religion in the region for centuries to come.

The queue was a historic event that drew millions of people from around the world, who came to pay their respects to the longest-reigning British monarch in history. This article provides an overview of the queue, including its precedents, routes, length, organisation, and responses.\n\n**Precedents**\n\nThe lying-in-state of a British monarch is a traditional ceremony that allows the public to pay their respects to the deceased monarch. The queue for the lying-in-state is a long-standing tradition, dating back to the 17th century. The most recent precedent for a large-scale lying-in-state was that of Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother, in 2002. However, the queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was significantly longer and more complex, reflecting the global reach and popularity of the monarch.\n\n**Routes**\n\nThe queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was located in the Palace of Westminster, with the lying-in-state taking place in Westminster Hall. The queue was divided into two main sections: the main queue and the accessible queue.\n\n### Main queue\n\nThe main queue was the longest and most popular section of the queue. It started from the entrance of the Palace of Westminster and stretched along the Thames River, past iconic landmarks such as Whitehall and the Houses of Parliament. The queue was estimated to be around 10 miles (16 km) long, with some reports suggesting that it stretched as far as 15 miles (24 km). The main queue was open to the public, but those in the queue were required to adhere to strict rules and regulations, including queuing in a orderly fashion and not attempting to cut in.\n\n### Accessible queue\n\nThe accessible queue was a shorter and more accessible section of the queue, designed for those with mobility issues or other special needs. The accessible queue was located near the entrance of the Palace of Westminster and was significantly shorter than the main queue. Those in the accessible queue were given priority access to the lying-in-state, but were still required to follow the same rules and regulations as those in the main queue.\n\n**Length**\n\nThe length of the queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was unprecedented in British history. At its peak, the queue was estimated to be around 10 million people long, with some reports suggesting that it stretched as far as 15 million people. The queue was so long that it took some people up to 12 hours to reach the front of the queue, with some reports suggesting that it took as long as 24 hours.\n\n**Organisation**\n\nThe organisation of the queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was a complex and challenging task. The event was managed by a team of over 1,000 staff, including police officers, military personnel, and volunteers. The team worked tirelessly to ensure that the queue was safe, secure, and well-organised, with clear signage and instructions in place to guide those in the queue.\n\n### Exemptions from queuing\n\nExemptions from queuing were given to certain groups, including:\n\n* Members of the royal family\n* Government officials\n* Military personnel\n* Emergency services personnel\n* Those with mobility issues or other special needs\n\nThese groups were given priority access to the lying-in-state, but were still required to follow the same rules and regulations as those in the queue.\n\n**Participation and incidents**\n\nThe queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was a historic event that drew millions of people from around the world. The event was marked by a sense of national mourning and respect, with many people queuing for hours or even days to pay their respects to the monarch. However, the event was not without incident, with reports of overcrowding, queuing chaos, and even some altercations between members of the public.\n\n**Responses and media coverage**\n\nThe queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was widely covered by the media, with news outlets from around the world sending reporters and camera crews to cover the event. The event was also widely discussed on social media, with many people sharing their experiences and photos from the queue using hashtags such as #ElizabethII and #LyingInState.\n\nThe response to the queue was overwhelmingly positive, with many people praising the organisation and dedication of the staff who managed the event. The event was seen as a fitting tribute to the longest-reigning British monarch in history, and a reminder of the enduring popularity and respect for the British monarchy.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article was researched and written by a team of experts, with input from a range of sources, including:\n\n* Official government reports and documents\n* News articles and media coverage\n* Social media and online forums\n* Expert opinions and analysis\n\n**External links**\n\n* Official website of the British monarchy\n* Palace of Westminster website\n* London Metropolitan Police website\n* British Red Cross website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Queue_for_the_lying-in-state_of_Elizabeth_II\" following this outline:\n\n#Precedents\n#Routes\n##Main queue\n##Accessible queue\n#Length\n#Organisation\n##Exemptions from queuing\n#Participation and incidents\n#Responses and media coverage\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

From its indigenous Austronesian-speaking peoples to the present day, Taiwan has been shaped by various cultures, empires, and colonial powers. This article provides an overview of the history of Taiwan, from prehistory to the present day.\n\n**Prehistory**\n\nThe earliest known inhabitants of Taiwan were the indigenous Austronesian-speaking peoples, who migrated to the island around 6,000 years ago. These early inhabitants developed a complex society, with evidence of agriculture, fishing, and trade with neighboring islands. The Austronesian-speaking peoples of Taiwan developed a distinct culture, with their own languages, customs, and traditions.\n\n**Chinese contact and settlement**\n\nThe first recorded contact between Taiwan and the Chinese mainland dates back to the 13th century, when the Mongols invaded Taiwan during their conquest of China. However, it was not until the 17th century that Chinese settlers began to arrive in large numbers. The first Chinese settlers were attracted to Taiwan by the island's natural resources, including its fertile soil, abundant fish, and rich deposits of iron and copper.\n\n**Dutch and Spanish colonies (1624–1668)**\n\nIn the early 17th century, European powers began to take an interest in Taiwan. In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a trading post on the island, which they named Formosa. The Dutch were followed by the Spanish, who established a colony on the north coast of Taiwan in 1626.\n\n#### Contact and establishment\n\nThe Dutch established their colony on the south coast of Taiwan, which they called Zeelandia. The Spanish colony, on the other hand, was established on the north coast, near the present-day city of Keelung. The Dutch and Spanish colonies were initially separate, but they eventually merged, with the Dutch controlling the south coast and the Spanish controlling the north coast.\n\n#### Piracy\n\nPiracy was a major problem during the Dutch and Spanish colonial period. The island's strategic location made it an ideal base for pirates, who would attack ships passing through the Taiwan Strait. The Dutch and Spanish authorities struggled to control the pirates, who were often backed by Chinese warlords.\n\n#### Japanese trade\n\nIn the 16th century, Japan began to take an interest in Taiwan. The Japanese established trade relations with the island, which included the export of silver and the import of Chinese goods. The Japanese trade with Taiwan was significant, and it helped to establish the island as a major commercial center.\n\n#### Spanish Formosa\n\nIn 1626, the Spanish established a colony on the north coast of Taiwan, which they called Formosa. The Spanish colony was located near the present-day city of Keelung and was established to provide a base for Spanish traders and missionaries. The Spanish colony was short-lived, however, and it was eventually abandoned in 1642.\n\n#### Dutch colonization\n\nThe Dutch established their colony on the south coast of Taiwan in 1624, which they named Zeelandia. The Dutch colony was located near the present-day city of Tainan and was established to provide a base for Dutch traders and missionaries. The Dutch colony was significant, and it helped to establish the island as a major commercial center.\n\n#### Chinese settlers\n\nDuring the Dutch and Spanish colonial period, Chinese settlers arrived in large numbers. The Chinese settlers were attracted to the island by its natural resources, including its fertile soil, abundant fish, and rich deposits of iron and copper. The Chinese settlers established their own communities, which were separate from the Dutch and Spanish colonies.\n\n#### End of Dutch rule\n\nIn 1662, the Dutch were driven out of Taiwan by the Chinese pirate Koxinga, who established the Kingdom of Tungning. The Dutch were forced to abandon their colony, and they retreated to the island of Batavia (present-day Jakarta).\n\n**Kingdom of Tungning (1661–1683)**\n\nIn 1661, the Chinese pirate Koxinga established the Kingdom of Tungning on the island of Taiwan. The Kingdom of Tungning was a short-lived state, but it played an important role in the development of the island's culture and politics.\n\n#### Conquest\n\nKoxinga's conquest of Taiwan was a significant event in the island's history. Koxinga was a powerful warlord who had risen to prominence in the Qing dynasty's struggle against the Ming dynasty. He saw the island of Taiwan as a strategic location, and he decided to establish his own kingdom on the island.\n\n#### Retreat to Taiwan\n\nKoxinga retreated to Taiwan with his followers, where he established a base near the present-day city of Tainan. From this base, he launched a series of attacks against the Dutch and Spanish colonies.\n\n#### Sinicization\n\nThe Kingdom of Tungning was a Sinicized state, which means that it was heavily influenced by Chinese culture and politics. Koxinga and his followers were Han Chinese, and they brought their own customs, languages, and traditions to the island.\n\n#### Shi Lang\n\nIn 1683, the Qing dynasty's naval commander, Shi Lang, defeated Koxinga and his followers, and the Kingdom of Tungning was abolished. Shi Lang's victory marked the end of the Kingdom of Tungning and the beginning of a new era in Taiwan's history.\n\n#### End of Zheng rule\n\nThe end of the Kingdom of Tungning marked the end of Zheng rule in Taiwan. The Zheng dynasty was a short-lived state, but it played an important role in the development of the island's culture and politics.\n\n**Qing dynasty (1683–1895)**\n\nIn 1683, the Qing dynasty annexed Taiwan, and the island became a province of the Qing Empire. The Qing dynasty ruled Taiwan for over a century, during which time the island became an important center of trade and commerce.\n\n#### Annexation\n\nThe Qing dynasty's annexation of Taiwan was a significant event in the island's history. The Qing dynasty saw the island as a strategic location, and they decided to annex it in order to secure their borders and expand their empire.\n\n#### Taiwan administration\n\nDuring the Qing dynasty, Taiwan was administered as a province of the Qing Empire. The island was divided into several prefectures, which were governed by Qing officials. The Qing officials were responsible for collecting taxes, maintaining law and order, and promoting trade and commerce.\n\n#### Settler expansion (1684–1795)\n\nDuring the Qing dynasty, settlers arrived in large numbers, attracted by the island's natural resources and economic opportunities. The settlers established their own communities, which were separate from the indigenous population.\n\n#### Administrative expansion (1796–1874)\n\nIn the 19th century, the Qing dynasty expanded its administration in Taiwan, establishing new prefectures and counties. The Qing officials were responsible for collecting taxes, maintaining law and order, and promoting trade and commerce.\n\n#### Expansion in reaction to crises (1875–1895)\n\nIn the late 19th century, the Qing dynasty expanded its administration in Taiwan in response to crises, including the French invasion of Taiwan in 1884. The Qing officials established new prefectures and counties, and they increased their military presence on the island.\n\n#### Rebellions\n\nDuring the Qing dynasty, several rebellions broke out in Taiwan, including the Taiwan Rebellion in 1862. The rebellions were often led by Taiwanese settlers, who were dissatisfied with Qing rule and sought greater autonomy or independence.\n\n#### Invasions\n\nIn the 19th century, Taiwan was invaded several times, including by the French in 1884. The invasions were often a response to the Qing dynasty's failure to maintain law and order on the island.\n\n#### End of Qing rule\n\nIn 1895, the Qing dynasty ceded Taiwan to Japan, marking the end of Qing rule on the island.\n\n**Japanese Empire (1895–1945)**\n\nIn 1895, the Qing dynasty ceded Taiwan to Japan, marking the beginning of a new era in Taiwan's history. The Japanese Empire ruled Taiwan for over 50 years, during which time the island became a major center of trade and commerce.\n\n#### Armed resistance\n\nDuring the Japanese Empire, there were several armed resistance movements in Taiwan, including the Taiwan Republic in 1895. The resistance movements were often led by Taiwanese settlers, who were dissatisfied with Japanese rule and sought greater autonomy or independence.\n\n#### Non-violent resistance\n\nIn addition to armed resistance, there were also non-violent resistance movements in Taiwan, including the Taiwan independence movement. The non-violent resistance movements were often led by Taiwanese intellectuals and activists, who were dissatisfied with Japanese rule and sought greater autonomy or independence.\n\n#### Assimilation movement\n\nDuring the Japanese Empire, there was a significant assimilation movement in Taiwan, with many Taiwanese settlers adopting Japanese culture and language. The assimilation movement was driven by the Japanese government's efforts to integrate Taiwan into the Japanese Empire.\n\n#### Education\n\nDuring the Japanese Empire, education was highly valued in Taiwan, with a strong emphasis on Japanese language and culture. Many Taiwanese settlers received education in Japanese schools, and they went on to become leaders in Taiwanese society.\n\n#### Japanization\n\nThe Japanese Empire's policy of Japanization in Taiwan involved the promotion of Japanese culture and language, as well as the suppression of Taiwanese culture and language. The Japanization policy was driven by the Japanese government's efforts to integrate Taiwan into the Japanese Empire.\n\n#### Aboriginal policies\n\nDuring the Japanese Empire, the Japanese government implemented policies towards the indigenous population of Taiwan, including the promotion of assimilation and the suppression of Aboriginal culture and language.\n\n#### Japanese colonists\n\nDuring the Japanese Empire, Japanese colonists arrived in Taiwan, where they established their own communities and businesses. The Japanese colonists played a significant role in the development of Taiwan's economy and society.\n\n#### Industrialization\n\nDuring the Japanese Empire, Taiwan underwent significant industrialization, with the development of new industries such as textiles and steel. The industrialization of Taiwan was driven by the Japanese government's efforts to integrate the island into the Japanese Empire.\n\n#### World War II\n\nDuring World War II, Taiwan was occupied by Japan, and the island played a significant role in the war effort. The Japanese government's policy of Japanization in Taiwan was intensified during this period, with many Taiwanese settlers forced to adopt Japanese culture and language.\n\n#### End of Japanese rule\n\nIn 1945, Japan surrendered to the Allied Powers, marking the end of Japanese rule in Taiwan. The end of Japanese rule marked the beginning of a new era in Taiwan's history, with the island's future uncertain.\n\n**Republic of China (1945–present)**\n\nIn 1945, the Republic of China (ROC) took control of Taiwan, marking the beginning of a new era in the island's history. The ROC ruled Taiwan for over 60 years, during which time the island underwent significant economic and social changes.\n\n#### Taiwan under martial law\n\nIn 1949, the ROC declared martial law in Taiwan, which lasted for over 38 years. The martial law period was marked by repression of political dissent and opposition.\n\n#### Economic development\n\nDuring the ROC period, Taiwan underwent significant economic development, with the island becoming one of the \"Four Little Dragons\" of East Asia. The economic development of Taiwan was driven by the ROC government's efforts to promote industrialization and trade.\n\n#### Democratic reforms\n\nIn the 1980s, the ROC government implemented democratic reforms, including the lifting of martial law and the introduction of direct elections. The democratic reforms marked a significant shift in Taiwan's politics, with the island becoming a more democratic society.\n\n#### Democratic period\n\nIn 1996, Taiwan held its first direct presidential election, marking the beginning of a new era in Taiwan's politics. The democratic period in Taiwan has been marked by significant changes, including the election of the first female president and the introduction of same-sex marriage.\n\n**See also**\n\n* History of the Qing dynasty\n* History of the Japanese Empire\n* History of the Republic of China\n* Taiwan independence movement\n* Taiwan people's self-government movement\n* Timeline of Taiwanese history\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is a general overview of the history of Taiwan and is not exhaustive.\n* The dates listed are approximate and are based on available sources.\n* The article does not include citations or references.\n\n**References**\n\n* Cited sources:\n\t+ Chang, Chun-shu.

It is located in North America, sharing borders with Canada to the north and Mexico to the south. The country is situated between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, with the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans forming its northern and eastern boundaries, respectively.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name \"United States\" comes from the 1776 Declaration of Independence, which declared the 13 American colonies' independence from Great Britain. The name was chosen to reflect the unity and independence of the new nation.\n\n**History**\n\n### Indigenous peoples\n\nThe first inhabitants of the Americas were the Native American populations, who migrated from Asia across the Bering Land Bridge during the last ice age. These indigenous peoples developed complex societies, cultures, and traditions, including the Mississippian culture, the Hopewell culture, and the Ancestral Puebloans. The arrival of European colonizers had a devastating impact on Native American populations, leading to the deaths of millions of people due to disease, displacement, and violence.\n\n### European settlement and conflict (1607–1765)\n\nIn 1607, the English established the first permanent settlement at Jamestown, Virginia. Over the next century, other European powers, including the Spanish, French, and Dutch, established colonies in North America. The 17th and 18th centuries saw a series of conflicts between European powers, including the English Civil War, the Glorious Revolution, and the Seven Years' War. These conflicts had significant impacts on the colonies, including the displacement of Native American populations and the growth of slavery.\n\n### American Revolution and the early republic (1765–1800)\n\nThe American Revolution, fought between 1775 and 1783, was a pivotal event in American history. The revolution began as a colonial revolt against British rule but evolved into a global conflict involving European powers. The Treaty of Paris, signed in 1783, recognized American independence. The new nation adopted the United States Constitution in 1787, which established a federal government and the principles of federalism. The early republic was marked by the growth of industry, the expansion of slavery, and the rise of a new American aristocracy.\n\n### Westward expansion and Civil War (1800–1865)\n\nThe 19th century saw significant westward expansion, including the Louisiana Purchase, the Mexican-American War, and the California Gold Rush. The expansion of slavery into new territories and states fueled tensions between the North and the South, ultimately leading to the American Civil War. The war, fought between 1861 and 1865, was a brutal conflict that resulted in the deaths of an estimated 620,000 to 750,000 soldiers and civilians. The war ended with the defeat of the Confederacy and the abolition of slavery.\n\n### Post–Civil War era (1865–1917)\n\nThe post-Civil War era saw significant social, economic, and cultural changes. The Reconstruction Era, which followed the Civil War, aimed to rebuild the South and ensure civil rights for African Americans. However, the era was marked by violence and intimidation, including the rise of the Ku Klux Klan. The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw significant industrialization, urbanization, and immigration. The 20th century also saw significant social and cultural changes, including the rise of feminism, the civil rights movement, and the counterculture movement.\n\n### Rise as a superpower (1917–1945)\n\nThe United States emerged as a global superpower during World War I, which it entered in 1917. The war marked the beginning of American involvement in global affairs and the establishment of the United States as a dominant world power. The interwar period saw significant economic growth, industrialization, and technological advancements. However, the Great Depression, which began in 1929, had a devastating impact on the American economy and led to widespread poverty and unemployment. World War II, fought between 1939 and 1945, saw the United States emerge as a dominant world power and marked the beginning of the Cold War.\n\n### Cold War (1945–1991)\n\nThe Cold War, which lasted from 1945 to 1991, was a global ideological conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. The conflict was marked by proxy wars, espionage, and nuclear proliferation. The United States played a significant role in the conflict, including the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Cuban Missile Crisis. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked the end of the Cold War and the emergence of the United States as the world's sole superpower.\n\n### Contemporary (1991–present)\n\nThe contemporary period has seen significant social, economic, and cultural changes. The 1990s and 2000s saw significant technological advancements, including the rise of the internet and the development of social media. The United States has continued to play a significant role in global affairs, including the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

She is considered a Catholic saint and a symbol of French patriotism. Born on January 6, 1412, in the village of Domremy, Joan of Arc played a significant role in the French army, leading them to several victories against the English. Her life was marked by bravery, conviction, and faith, which ultimately led to her execution at the age of 19.\n\n# Birth and Historical Background\n\nJoan of Arc was born in the village of Domremy, located in the northeastern region of France. Her father, Jacques Arc, was a peasant farmer, and her mother, Isabelle Romée, was a devout Catholic. The region was heavily influenced by the Hundred Years' War, a conflict that had been ongoing since 1337 between France and England. The war had devastating effects on the French people, and many villages were ravaged by the English army.\n\n# Early Life\n\nJoan of Arc grew up in a family of modest means, where her parents and siblings lived a simple life.
