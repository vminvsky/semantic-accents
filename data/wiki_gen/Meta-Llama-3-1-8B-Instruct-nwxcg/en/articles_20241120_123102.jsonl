{"title": "Dwight_D._Eisenhower", "content": "\nFamily background\nThe Eisenhauer (German for \"iron hewer\" or \"iron miner\") family migrated from the German village of Karlsbrunn to the Province of Pennsylvania in 1741 [4] Accounts vary as to how and when the German name Eisenhauer was anglicized [5]\n\n\nEarly life and education\nEisenhower was born David Dwight Eisenhower in Denison, Texas, on October 14, 1890, the third of seven sons born to Ida and David [8] His mother soon reversed his two forenames after his birth to avoid the confusion of having two Davids in the family [9] He was named Dwight after the evangelist Dwight L Moody [10] All of the boys were nicknamed \"Ike\", such as \"Big Ike\" (Edgar) and \"Little Ike\" (Dwight); the nickname was intended as an abbreviation of their last name [11] By World War II, only Dwight was still called \"Ike\" [4]\n\n\nPersonal life\nWhile Eisenhower was stationed in Texas, he met Mamie Doud of Boone, Iowa [4] They were immediately taken with each other He proposed to her on Valentine's Day in 1916 [36] A November wedding date in Denver was moved up to July 1 due to the impending American entry into World War I; Funston approved 10 days of leave for their wedding [37] The Eisenhowers moved many times during their first 35 years of marriage [38]\n\n\nWorld War I (1914–1918)\nEisenhower served initially in logistics and then the infantry at various camps in Texas and Georgia until 1918 When the US entered World War I, he immediately requested an overseas assignment but was denied and assigned to Ft Leavenworth, Kansas [52] In February 1918, he was transferred to Camp Meade in Maryland with the 65th Engineers His unit was later ordered to France, but, to his chagrin, he received orders for the new tank corps, where he was promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel in the National Army [53] He commanded a unit that trained tank crews at Camp Colt – his first command Though Eisenhower and his tank crews never saw combat, he displayed excellent organizational skills as well as an ability to accurately assess junior officers' strengths and make optimal placements of personnel [54]\n\n\nBetween the Wars (1918–1939)\nAfter the war, Eisenhower reverted to his regular rank of captain and a few days later was promoted to major, a rank he held for 16 years [58] The major was assigned in 1919 to a transcontinental Army convoy to test vehicles and dramatize the need for improved roads Indeed, the convoy averaged only 5 miles per hour (8.0 km/h) from Washington, D.C to San Francisco; later the improvement of highways became a signature issue for Eisenhower as president [59]\n\n\nIn service of generals\nAfter the war, Eisenhower reverted to his regular rank of captain and a few days later was promoted to major, a rank he held for 16 years [58] The major was assigned in 1919 to a transcontinental Army convoy to test vehicles and dramatize the need for improved roads Indeed, the convoy averaged only 5 miles per hour (8.0 km/h) from Washington, D.C to San Francisco; later the improvement of highways became a signature issue for Eisenhower as president [59]\n\n\nPhilippine tenure (1935–1939)\nIn 1935, he accompanied MacArthur to the Philippines, where he served as assistant military adviser to the Philippine government in developing their army MacArthur allowed Eisenhower to handpick an officer whom he thought would contribute to the mission Hence he chose James Ord, a classmate of his at West Point Having been brought up in Mexico, which inculcated into him the Spanish culture which influenced both Mexico and the Philippines, Ord was deemed the right pick for the job Eisenhower had strong philosophical disagreements with MacArthur regarding the role of the Philippine Army and the leadership qualities that an American army officer should exhibit and develop in his subordinates The antipathy between Eisenhower and MacArthur lasted the rest of their lives [72]\n\n\nWorld War II (1939–1945)\nEisenhower returned to the United States in December 1939 and was assigned as commanding officer of the 1st Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment at Fort Lewis, Washington, later becoming the regimental executive officer In March 1941 he was promoted to colonel and assigned as chief of staff of the newly activated IX Corps under Major General Kenyon Joyce In June 1941, he was appointed chief of staff to General Walter Krueger, Commander of the Third Army, at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas After successfully participating in the Louisiana Maneuvers, he was promoted to brigadier general on October 3, 1941 [78] [79]\n\n\nOperations Torch and Avalanche\nIn November 1942, Eisenhower was also appointed Supreme Commander Allied Expeditionary Force of the North African Theater of Operations (NATOUSA) through the new operational Headquarters Allied (Expeditionary) Force Headquarters (A(E)FHQ) The word \"expeditionary\" was dropped soon after his appointment for security reasons [failed verification] The campaign in North Africa was designated Operation Torch and was planned in the underground headquarters within the Rock of Gibraltar Eisenhower was the first non-British person to command Gibraltar in 200 years [84]\n\n\nSupreme Allied commander and Operation Overlord\nIn December 1943, President Roosevelt decided that Eisenhower – not Marshall – would be Supreme Allied Commander in Europe The following month, he resumed command of ETOUSA and the following month was officially designated as the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), serving in a dual role until the end of hostilities in Europe in May 1945 [89] He was charged in these positions with planning and carrying out the Allied assault on the coast of Normandy in June 1944 under the code name Operation Overlord, the liberation of Western Europe and the invasion of Germany [90]\n\n\nLiberation of France and victory in Europe\nEvery ground commander seeks the battle of annihilation; so far as conditions permit, he tries to duplicate in modern war the classic example of Cannae.\n\nAfter World War II (1945–1953)\nFollowing the German unconditional surrender, Eisenhower was appointed military governor of the American-occupied zone of Germany, located primarily in Southern Germany, and headquartered in Frankfurt am Main Upon discovery of the Nazi concentration camps, he ordered camera crews to document evidence for use in the Nuremberg Trials He reclassified German prisoners of war (POWs) in US custody as Disarmed Enemy Forces (DEFs), who were no longer subject to the Geneva Convention Eisenhower followed the orders laid down by the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) in directive JCS 1067 but softened them by bringing in 400,000 tons of food for civilians and allowing more fraternization [104] [105] [106] In response to the devastation in Germany, including food shortages and an influx of refugees, he arranged distribution of American food and medical equipment [107] His actions reflected the new American attitudes of the German people as Nazi victims not villains, while aggressively purging the ex-Nazis [108] [109]\n\n\nMilitary Governor of the American-occupied zone of Germany\nFollowing the German unconditional surrender, Eisenhower was appointed military governor of the

American attitudes of the German people as Nazi victims not villains, while aggressively purging the ex-Nazis [108] [109]\n\n\nArmy Chief of Staff\nIn November 1945, Eisenhower returned to Washington to replace Marshall as Chief of Staff of the Army His main role was the rapid demobilization of millions of soldiers, which was delayed by lack of shipping Eisenhower was convinced in 1946 that the Soviet Union did not want war and that friendly relations could be maintained; he strongly supported the new United Nations and favored its involvement in the control of atomic bombs However, in formulating policies regarding the atomic bomb and relations with the Soviets, Truman was guided by the State Department and ignored Eisenhower and the Pentagon Indeed, Eisenhower had opposed the use of the atomic bomb against the Japanese, writing, \"First, the Japanese were ready to surrender and it wasn't necessary to hit them with that awful thing Second, I hated to see our country be the first to use such a weapon.\" [110] Initially, Eisenhower hoped for cooperation with the Soviets [111] He even visited Warsaw in 1945 Invited by Bolesław Bierut and decorated with the highest military decoration, he was shocked by the scale of destruction in the city [112] However, by mid-1947, as east–west tensions over economic recovery in Germany and the Greek Civil War escalated, Eisenhower agreed with a containment policy to stop Soviet expansion [111]\n\n\n1948 presidential election\nIn June 1943, a visiting politician had suggested to Eisenhower that he might become president after the war Believing that a general should not participate in politics, Merlo J Pusey wrote that \"figuratively speaking,  [Eisenhower] kicked his political-minded visitor out of his office\" As others asked him about his political future, Eisenhower told one that he could not imagine wanting to be considered for any political job \"from dogcatcher to Grand High Supreme King of the Universe\", and another that he could not serve as Army Chief of Staff if others believed he had political ambitions In 1945, Truman told Eisenhower during the Potsdam Conference that if desired, the president would help the general win the 1948 election, [113] and in 1947 he offered to run as Eisenhower's running mate on the Democratic ticket if MacArthur won the Republican nomination [114]\n\n\nPresident at Columbia University and NATO Supreme Commander\nIn 1948, Eisenhower became President of Columbia University, an Ivy League university in New York City, where he was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa [116] The choice was subsequently characterized as not having been a good fit for either party [117] During that year, Eisenhower's memoir, Crusade in Europe, was published [118] It was a major financial success [119] Eisenhower sought the advice of Augusta National's Roberts about the tax implications of this, [119] and in due course Eisenhower's profit on the book was substantially aided by what author David Pietrusza calls \"a ruling without precedent\" by the Department of the Treasury  It held that Eisenhower was not a professional writer, but rather, marketing the lifetime asset of his experiences, and thus he had to pay only capital gains tax on his $635,000 advance instead of the much higher personal tax rate This ruling saved Eisenhower about $400,000 [120]\n\n\nPresidential campaign of 1952\nPresident Truman sensed a broad-based desire for an Eisenhower candidacy for president, and he again pressed him to run for the office as a Democrat in 1951 But Eisenhower voiced his disagreements with the Democrats and declared himself to be a Republican [139] A \"Draft Eisenhower\" movement in the Republican Party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the 1952 presidential election to counter the candidacy of non-interventionist Senator Robert A Taft The effort was a long struggle; Eisenhower had to be convinced that political circumstances had created a genuine duty to offer himself as a candidate and that there was a mandate from the public for him to be their president Henry Cabot Lodge Jr and others succeeded in convincing him, and he resigned his command at NATO in June 1952 to campaign full-time [140]\n\n\nElection of 1956\nIn the United States presidential election of 1956, Eisenhower, the popular incumbent, was re-elected The election was a re-match of 1952, as his opponent in 1956 was Stevenson, a former Illinois governor, whom Eisenhower had defeated four years earlier Compared to the 1952 election, Eisenhower gained Kentucky, Louisiana, and West Virginia from Stevenson, while losing Missouri His voters were less likely to bring up his leadership record Instead what stood out this time \"was the response to personal qualities — to his sincerity, his integrity and sense of duty, his virtue as a family man, his religious devotion, and his sheer likeableness.\" [150]\n\n\nPresidency (1953–1961)\nTruman and Eisenhower had minimal discussions about the transition of administrations due to a complete estrangement between them as a result of campaigning [151] Eisenhower selected Joseph M Dodge as his budget director, then asked Herbert Brownell Jr and Lucius D Clay to make recommendations for his cabinet appointments He accepted their recommendations without exception; they included John Foster Dulles and George M Humphrey with whom he developed his closest relationships, as well as Oveta Culp Hobby His cabinet consisted of several corporate executives and one labor leader, and one journalist dubbed it \"eight millionaires and a plumber\" [152] The cabinet was known for its lack of personal friends, office seekers, or experienced government administrators He also upgraded the role of the National Security Council in planning all phases of the Cold War [153]\n\n\nAtoms for Peace\nEisenhower gave the Atoms for Peace speech to the United Nations General Assembly on 8 December 1953, advocating for constructive use of nuclear fission for electrical energy and nuclear medicine instead of nuclear arms race proliferation The speech led to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 which allowed the civilian world to develop nuclear fission technology for peaceful and prosperous purposes [169] [170]\n\n\nInterstate Highway System\nEisenhower championed and signed the bill that authorized the Interstate Highway System in 1956 [171] He justified the project through the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 as essential to American security during the Cold War.\n\n\nARPA\nThe Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) was put together by Eisenhower and his Science Advisory Committee in early 1958 in response to the successful launch of the first orbital satellite from the Soviet Union Sputnik 1 ARPA eventually created the ARPANET which was a predecessor to the internet [176] [177]\n\n\nForeign policy\nThe United States foreign policy of the Dwight D Eisenhower administration, from 1953 to 1961, focused on the Cold War with the Soviet Union and its satellites The United States built up a stockpile of nuclear weapons and nuclear delivery systems to deter military threats and save money while cutting back on expensive Army combat units  A major uprising broke out in Hungary in 1956; the Eisenhower administration did not become directly involved, but condemned the military invasion by the Soviet Union Eisenhower sought to reach a nuclear test ban treaty with the Soviet Union, but following the 1960 U-2 incident the Kremlin canceled a scheduled summit in Paris.\n\n\nSpace Race\nEisenhower and the CIA had known since at least January 1957, nine months before Sputnik, that Russia had the capability to launch a small payload into orbit and was likely to do so within a year [178]\n\n\nKorean War, Free China and Red China\nIn late 1952, Eisenhower went to Korea and discovered a military and political stalemate Once in office, when the Chinese People's Volunteer Army began a buildup in the Kaesong sanctuary, he considered using nuclear weapons if an armistice was not reached Whether China was informed of the potential for nuclear force is unknown [186]  His earlier military reputation in Europe was effective with the Chinese communists [187] The National Security Council, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Strategic Air Command (SAC) devised detailed plans for nuclear war against Red China [188] With the death of Stalin in March 1953, Russian support for a Chinese communist hard-line weakened and China decided to compromise on the prisoner issue [189]\n\n\nSoutheast Asia\nEarly in 1953, the French asked Eisenhower for help in French Indochina against the Communists, supplied from China, who were fighting the First Indochina War Eisenhower sent Lt General John W O'Daniel to Vietnam to assess the French forces there [197] Chief of Staff Matthew Ridgway dissuaded the President from intervening by presenting a comprehensive estimate of the massive military deployment that would be necessary Eisenhower stated prophetically that \"this war would absorb our troops by divisions.\" [198]\n\n\nLegitimation of Francoist Spain\nThe Pact of Madrid, signed on September 23, 1953, by Francoist Spain and the United States, was a significant effort to break international isolation of Spain, together with the Concordat of 1953 This development came at a time when other victorious Allies and much of the rest of the world remained hostile [b] to a fascist regime sympathetic to the cause of the former Axis powers and established with Nazi assistance This accord took the form of three separate executive agreements that pledged the United States to furnish economic and military aid to Spain.\n\n\nMiddle East and Eisenhower doctrine\nEven before he was inaugurated Eisenhower accepted a request from the British government to restore the Shah of Iran (Mohammad Reza Pahlavi) to power He therefore authorized the CIA to overthrow Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh [209] This resulted in increased strategic control over Iranian oil by US and British companies [210]\n\n\n1960 U-2 incident\nOn 1 May 1960, a United States U-2 spy plane was shot down by the Soviet Air Defence Forces while conducting photographic aerial reconnaissance deep inside Soviet territory Flown by American pilot Francis Gary Powers, the aircraft had taken off from Peshawar, Pakistan, and crashed near Sverdlovsk (present-day Yekaterinburg), after being hit by a surface-to-air missile Powers parachuted to the ground and was captured.\n\n\nCivil rights\nWhile President Truman's 1948 Executive Order 9981 had begun the process of desegregating the Armed Forces, actual implementation had been slow Eisenhower made clear his stance in his first State of the Union address in February 1953, saying \"I propose to use whatever authority exists in the office of the President to end segregation in the District of Columbia, including the Federal Government, and any segregation in the Armed Forces\" [218] When he encountered opposition from the services, he used government control of military spending to force the change through, stating \"Wherever Federal Funds are expended ..., I do not see how any American can justify .. a discrimination in the expenditure of those funds\" [219] When Robert B Anderson, Eisenhower's first Secretary of the Navy, argued that the US Navy must recognize the \"customs and usages prevailing in certain geographic areas of our country which the Navy had no part in creating,\" Eisenhower overruled him: \"We have not taken and we shall not take a single backward step There must be no second class citizens in this country.\" [220]\n\n\nRelations with Congress\nEisenhower had a Republican Congress for only his first two years in office; in the Senate, Republicans held the majority by a one-vote margin Despite being Eisenhower's political opponent for the 1952 Republican presidential nomination, Senator Majority Leader Robert A Taft assisted Eisenhower a great deal by promoting the President's proposals among the \"Old Guard\" Republican Senators Taft's death in July 1953—six months into Eisenhower's presidency—affected Eisenhower both personally and professionally The President noted he had lost \"a dear friend\" with Taft's passing Eisenhower disliked Taft's successor as Majority Leader, Senator William Knowland, and the relationship between the two men led to tension between the Senate and the White House [232]\n\n\nJudicial appointments\nEisenhower appointed the following Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States:\n\n\nSupreme Court\nEisenhower appointed the following Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States:\n\n\nStates admitted to the Union\nTwo states were admitted to the Union during Eisenhower's presidency.\n\n\nHealth issues\nEisenhower began chain smoking cigarettes at West Point, often three or four packs a day He joked that he \"gave  [himself] an order\" to stop cold turkey in 1949 However, Evan Thomas says the true story was more complex At first, he removed cigarettes and ashtrays, but that did not work He told a friend:\n\n\nEnd of presidency\nThe 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution, which set a two-term limit on the presidency, was ratified in 1951 Eisenhower was the first president constitutionally prevented from serving a third term.\n\n\nPost-presidency (1961–1969)\nFollowing the presidency, Eisenhower moved to the place where he and Mamie had spent much of their post-war time, a working farm adjacent to the battlefield at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, 70 miles (110 km) from his ancestral home in Elizabethville, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania [270] [271] They also maintained a retirement home in Palm Desert, California [272]\n\n\nDeath\nAt 12:25 p.m on March 28, 1969, Eisenhower died from congestive heart failure at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C., at age 78 [277] The following day, his body was moved to the Washington National Cathedral's Bethlehem Chapel, where he lay in repose for 28 hours [278] He was then transported to the United States Capitol, where he lay in state in the Capitol Rotunda on March 30 and 31 [279] A state funeral was conducted at the Washington National Cathedral on March 31 [280] The president and First Lady, Richard and Pat Nixon, attended, as did former president Lyndon Johnson Also among the 2,000 guests that were invited were the UN Secretary-General U Thant and 191 foreign delegates from 78 countries, including 10 foreign heads of state and government Guests included President Charles de Gaulle of France, who was in the United States for the first time since the state funeral of John F Kennedy, [281] Chancellor Kurt-Georg Kiesinger of West Germany, King Baudouin of Belgium and Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran [280]\n\n\nLegacy and memory\nEisenhower's reputation declined in the immediate years after he left office During his presidency, he was widely seen by critics as an inactive, uninspiring, golf-playing president This was in stark contrast to his vigorous young successor, John F Kennedy, who was 26 years his junior Despite his unprecedented use of Army troops to enforce a federal desegregation order at Central High School in Little Rock, Eisenhower was criticized for his reluctance to support the civil rights movement to the degree that activists wanted Eisenhower also attracted criticism for his handling of the 1960 U-2 incident and the associated international embarrassment, [285] [286] for the Soviet Union's perceived leadership in the nuclear arms race and the Space Race, and for his failure to publicly oppose McCarthyism [287] In particular, Eisenhower was criticized for failing to defend George C Marshall from attacks by Joseph McCarthy, though he privately deplored McCarthy's tactics [288]\n\n\nTributes and memorials\nThe Interstate Highway System is officially known as the \"Dwight D Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways\" It was inspired in part by Eisenhower's experiences in World War II, where he recognized the advantages of the autobahn system in Germany [174] Commemorative signs reading \"Eisenhower Interstate System\" and bearing Eisenhower's permanent 5-star rank insignia were introduced in 1993 and now are displayed throughout the Interstate System Several highways are also named for him, including the Eisenhower Expressway (Interstate 290) near Chicago, the Eisenhower Tunnel on Interstate 70 west of Denver, and Interstate 80 in California [302]\n\n\nHonors\nEisenhower received the Freedom honor from several locations, including:\n\n\nAwards and decorations\nEisenhower received the Freedom honor from several locations,

Eisenhower**\n\nDwight David Eisenhower was the 34th President of the United States, serving from 1953 to 1961. He was a five-star general in the United States Army during World War II and the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe.\n\n**Family Background**\n\nThe Eisenhauer family migrated from the German village of Karlsbrunn to the Province of Pennsylvania in 1741. Accounts vary as to how and when the German name Eisenhauer was anglicized. The family had a long history of military service, with several members serving in the American Revolution and the Civil War.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nEisenhower was born David Dwight Eisenhower in Denison, Texas, on October 14, 1890, the third of seven sons born to Ida and David. His mother soon reversed his two forenames after his birth to avoid the confusion of having two Davids in the family. He was named Dwight after the evangelist Dwight L Moody. All of the boys were nicknamed \"Ike\", such as \"Big Ike\" (Edgar) and \"Little Ike\" (Dwight); the nickname was intended as an abbreviation of their last name. By World War II, only Dwight was still called \"Ike\".\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nWhile Eisenhower was stationed in Texas, he met Mamie Doud of Boone, Iowa. They were immediately taken with each other. He proposed to her on Valentine's Day in 1916. A November wedding date in Denver was moved up to July 1 due to the impending American entry into World War I; Funston approved 10 days of leave for their wedding. The Eisenhowers moved many times during their first 35 years of marriage.\n\n**World War I (1914–1918)**\n\nEisenhower served initially in logistics and then the infantry at various camps in Texas and Georgia until 1918. When the US entered World War I, he immediately requested an overseas assignment but was denied and assigned to Ft Leavenworth, Kansas. In February 1918, he was transferred to Camp Meade in Maryland with the 65th Engineers. His unit was later ordered to France, but, to his chagrin, he received orders for the new tank corps, where he was promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel in the National Army. He commanded a unit that trained tank crews at Camp Colt – his first command.\n\n**Between the Wars (1918–1939)**\n\nAfter the war, Eisenhower reverted to his regular rank of captain and a few days later was promoted to major, a rank he held for 16 years. The major was assigned in 1919 to a transcontinental Army convoy to test vehicles and dramatize the need for improved roads. Indeed, the convoy averaged only 5 miles per hour from Washington, D.C to San Francisco; later the improvement of highways became a signature issue for Eisenhower as president.\n\n**Philippine Tenure (1935–1939)**\n\nIn 1935, he accompanied MacArthur to the Philippines, where he served as assistant military adviser to the Philippine government in developing their army. MacArthur allowed Eisenhower to handpick an officer whom he thought would contribute to the mission. Hence he chose James Ord, a classmate of his at West Point. Having been brought up in Mexico, which inculcated into him the Spanish culture which influenced both Mexico and the Philippines, Ord was deemed the right pick for the job. Eisenhower had strong philosophical disagreements with MacArthur regarding the role of the Philippine Army and the leadership qualities that an American army officer should exhibit and develop in his subordinates. The antipathy between Eisenhower and MacArthur lasted the rest of their lives.\n\n**World War II (1939–1945)**\n\nEisenhower returned to the United States in December 1939 and was assigned as commanding officer of the 1st Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment at Fort Lewis, Washington, later becoming the regimental executive officer. In March 1941 he was promoted to colonel and assigned as chief of staff of the newly activated IX Corps under Major General Kenyon Joyce. In June 1941, he was appointed chief of staff to General Walter Krueger, Commander of the Third Army, at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas. After successfully participating in the Louisiana Maneuvers, he was promoted to brigadier general on October 3, 1941.\n\n**Operations Torch and Avalanche**\n\nIn November 1942, Eisenhower was appointed Supreme Commander Allied Expeditionary Force of the North African Theater of Operations (NATOUSA) through the new operational Headquarters Allied (Expeditionary) Force Headquarters (A(E)FHQ). The campaign in North Africa was designated Operation Torch and was planned in the underground headquarters within the Rock of Gibraltar. Eisenhower was the first non-British person to command Gibraltar in 200 years.\n\n**Supreme Allied Commander and Operation Overlord**\n\nIn December 1943, President Roosevelt decided that Eisenhower – not Marshall – would be Supreme Allied Commander in Europe. The following month, he resumed command of ETOUSA and the following month was officially designated as the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), serving in a dual role until the end of hostilities in Europe in May 1945. He was charged in these positions with planning and carrying out the Allied assault on the coast of Normandy in June 1944 under the code name Operation Overlord, the liberation of Western Europe and the invasion of Germany.\n\n**Liberation of France and Victory in Europe**\n\nEvery ground commander seeks the battle of annihilation; so far as conditions permit, he tries to duplicate in modern war the classic example of Cannae. Eisenhower's military leadership played a crucial role in the Allied victory in World War II.\n\n**Post-War (1945–1953)**\n\nFollowing the German unconditional surrender, Eisenhower was appointed military governor of the American-occupied zone of Germany, located primarily in Southern Germany, and headquartered in Frankfurt am Main. Upon discovery of the Nazi concentration camps, he ordered camera crews to document evidence for use in the Nuremberg Trials. He reclassified German prisoners of war (POWs) in US custody as Disarmed Enemy Forces (DEFs), who were no longer subject to the Geneva Convention.\n\n**Army Chief of Staff**\n\nIn November 1945, Eisenhower returned to Washington to replace Marshall as Chief of Staff of the Army. His main role was the rapid demobilization of millions of soldiers, which was delayed by lack of shipping. He was convinced in 1946 that the Soviet Union did not want war and that friendly relations could be maintained; he strongly supported the new United Nations and favored its involvement in the control of atomic bombs.\n\n**Election of 1952**\n\nPresident Truman sensed a broad-based desire for an Eisenhower candidacy for president, and he again pressed him to run for the office as a Democrat in 1951. However, Eisenhower voiced his disagreements with the Democrats and declared himself to be a Republican. A \"Draft Eisenhower\" movement in the Republican Party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the 1952 presidential election to counter the candidacy of non-interventionist Senator Robert A Taft.\n\n**Presidency (1953–1961)**\n\nTruman and Eisenhower had minimal discussions about the transition of administrations due to a complete estrangement between them as a result of campaigning.

He accepted their recommendations without exception; they included John Foster Dulles and George M Humphrey with whom he developed his closest relationships, as well as Oveta Culp Hobby. The cabinet was known for its lack of personal friends, office seekers, or experienced government administrators.\n\n**Atoms for Peace**\n\nEisenhower gave the Atoms for Peace speech to the United Nations General Assembly on 8 December 1953, advocating for constructive use of nuclear fission for electrical energy and nuclear medicine instead of nuclear arms race proliferation.

He joked that he \"gave [himself] an order\" to stop cold turkey in 1949. However, Evan Thomas says the true story was more complex. At first, he removed cigarettes and ashtrays, but that did not work. He told a friend, \"I am a cigarette smoker and I am going to keep on smoking.\"\n\n**End of Presidency**\n\nThe 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution, which set a two-term limit on the presidency, was ratified in 1951.

Decorations**\n\nEisenhower received many awards and decorations during his lifetime, including the Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, the Army Distinguished Service Medal, and the

(April 5, 1943)\n* General (December 16, 1944)\n* General of the Army (December 20, 1944)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Dwight_D._Eisenhower\" following this outline:\n\n\nFamily background\nThe Eisenhauer (German for \"iron hewer\" or \"iron miner\") family migrated from the German village of Karlsbrunn to the Province of Pennsylvania in 1741 [4] Accounts vary as to how and when the German name Eisenhauer was anglicized [5]\n\n\nEarly life and education\nEisenhower was born David Dwight Eisenhower in Denison, Texas, on October 14, 1890, the third of seven sons born to Ida and David [8] His mother soon reversed his two forenames after his birth to avoid the confusion of having two Davids in the family [9] He was named Dwight after the evangelist Dwight L Moody [10] All of the boys were nicknamed \"Ike\", such as \"Big Ike\" (Edgar) and \"Little Ike\" (Dwight); the nickname was intended as an abbreviation of their last name [11] By World War II, only Dwight was still called \"Ike\" [4]\n\n\nPersonal life\nWhile Eisenhower was stationed in Texas, he met Mamie Doud of Boone, Iowa [4] They were immediately taken with each other He proposed to her on Valentine's Day in 1916 [36] A November wedding date in Denver was moved up to July 1 due to the impending American entry into World War I; Funston approved 10 days of leave for their wedding [37] The Eisenhowers moved many times during their first 35 years of marriage [38]\n\n\nWorld War I (1914–1918)\nEisenhower served initially in logistics and then the infantry at various camps in Texas and Georgia until 1918 When the US entered World War I, he immediately requested an overseas assignment but was denied and assigned to Ft Leavenworth, Kansas [52] In February 1918, he was transferred to Camp Meade in Maryland with the 65th Engineers His unit was later ordered to France, but, to his chagrin, he received orders for the new tank corps, where he was promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel in the National Army [53] He commanded a unit that trained tank crews at Camp Colt – his first command Though Eisenhower and his tank crews never saw combat, he displayed excellent organizational skills as well as an ability to accurately assess junior officers' strengths and make optimal placements of personnel [54]\n\n\nBetween the Wars (1918–1939)\nAfter the war, Eisenhower reverted to his regular rank of captain and a few days later was promoted to major, a rank he held for 16 years [58] The major was assigned in 1919 to a transcontinental Army convoy to test vehicles and dramatize the need for improved roads Indeed, the convoy averaged only 5 miles per hour (8.0 km/h) from Washington, D.C to San Francisco; later the improvement of highways became a signature issue for Eisenhower as president [59]\n\n\nIn service of generals\nAfter the war, Eisenhower reverted to his regular rank of captain and a few days later was promoted to major, a rank he held for 16 years [58] The major was assigned in 1919 to a transcontinental Army convoy to test vehicles and dramatize the need for improved roads Indeed, the convoy averaged only 5 miles per hour (8.0 km/h) from Washington, D.C to San Francisco; later the improvement of highways became a signature issue for Eisenhower as president [59]\n\n\nPhilippine tenure (1935–1939)\nIn 1935, he accompanied MacArthur to the Philippines, where he served as assistant military adviser to the Philippine government in developing their army MacArthur allowed Eisenhower to handpick an officer whom he thought would contribute to the mission Hence he chose James Ord, a classmate of his at West Point Having been brought up in Mexico, which inculcated into him the Spanish culture which influenced both Mexico and the Philippines, Ord was deemed the right pick for the job Eisenhower had strong philosophical disagreements with MacArthur regarding the role of the Philippine Army and the leadership qualities that an American army officer should exhibit and develop in his subordinates The antipathy between Eisenhower and MacArthur lasted the rest of their lives [72]\n\n\nWorld War II (1939–1945)\nEisenhower returned to the United States in December 1939 and was assigned as commanding officer of the 1st Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment at Fort Lewis, Washington, later becoming the regimental executive officer In March 1941 he was promoted to colonel and assigned as chief of staff of the newly activated IX Corps under Major General Kenyon Joyce In June 1941, he was appointed chief of staff to General Walter Krueger, Commander of the Third Army, at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas After successfully participating in the Louisiana Maneuvers, he was promoted to brigadier general on October 3, 1941 [78] [79]\n\n\nOperations Torch and Avalanche\nIn November 1942, Eisenhower was also appointed Supreme Commander Allied Expeditionary Force of the North African Theater of Operations (NATOUSA) through the new operational Headquarters Allied (Expeditionary) Force Headquarters (A(E)FHQ) The word \"expeditionary\" was dropped soon after his appointment for security reasons [failed verification] The campaign in North Africa was designated Operation Torch and was planned in the underground headquarters within the Rock of Gibraltar Eisenhower was the first non-British person to command Gibraltar in 200 years [84]\n\n\nSupreme Allied commander and Operation Overlord\nIn December 1943, President Roosevelt decided that Eisenhower – not Marshall – would be Supreme Allied Commander in Europe The following month, he resumed command of ETOUSA and the following month was officially designated as the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), serving in a dual role until the end of hostilities in Europe in May 1945 [89] He was charged in these positions with planning and carrying out the Allied assault on the coast of Normandy in June 1944 under the code name Operation Overlord, the liberation of Western Europe and the invasion of Germany [90]\n\n\nLiberation of France and victory in Europe\nEvery ground commander seeks the battle of annihilation; so far as conditions permit, he tries to duplicate in modern war the classic example of Cannae.\n\nAfter World War II (1945–1953)\nFollowing the German unconditional surrender, Eisenhower was appointed military governor of the American-occupied zone of Germany, located primarily in Southern Germany, and headquartered in Frankfurt am Main Upon discovery of the Nazi concentration camps, he ordered camera crews to document evidence for use in the Nuremberg Trials He reclassified German prisoners of war (POWs) in US custody as Disarmed Enemy Forces (DEFs), who were no longer subject to the Geneva Convention Eisenhower followed the orders laid down by the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) in directive JCS 1067 but softened them by bringing in 400,000 tons of food for civilians and allowing more fraternization [104] [105] [106] In response to the devastation in Germany, including food shortages and an influx of refugees, he arranged distribution of American food and medical equipment [107] His actions reflected the new American attitudes of the German people as Nazi victims not villains, while aggressively purging the ex-Nazis [108] [109]\n\n\nMilitary Governor of the American-occupied zone of Germany\nFollowing the German unconditional surrender, Eisenhower was appointed military governor of the American-occupied zone of Germany, located primarily in Southern Germany, and headquartered in Frankfurt am Main Upon discovery of the Nazi concentration camps, he ordered camera crews to document evidence for use in the Nuremberg Trials He reclassified German prisoners of war (POWs) in US custody as Disarmed Enemy Forces (DEFs), who were no longer subject to the Geneva Convention Eisenhower followed the orders laid down by the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) in directive JCS 1067 but softened them by bringing in 400,000 tons of food for civilians and allowing more fraternization [104] [105] [106] In response to the devastation in Germany, including food shortages and an influx of refugees, he arranged distribution of American food and medical equipment [107] His actions reflected the new American attitudes of the German people as Nazi victims not villains, while aggressively purging the ex-Nazis [108] [109]\n\n\nArmy Chief of Staff\nIn November 1945, Eisenhower returned to Washington to replace Marshall as Chief of Staff of the Army His main role was the rapid demobilization of millions of soldiers, which was delayed by lack of shipping Eisenhower was convinced in 1946 that the Soviet Union did not want war and that friendly relations could be maintained; he strongly supported the new United Nations and favored its involvement in the control of atomic bombs However, in formulating policies regarding the atomic bomb and relations with the Soviets, Truman was guided by the State Department and ignored Eisenhower and the Pentagon Indeed, Eisenhower had opposed the use of the atomic bomb against the Japanese, writing, \"First, the Japanese were ready to surrender and it wasn't necessary to hit them with that awful thing Second, I hated to see our country be the first to use such a weapon.\" [110] Initially, Eisenhower hoped for cooperation with the Soviets [111] He even visited Warsaw in 1945 Invited by Bolesław Bierut and decorated with the highest military decoration, he was shocked by the scale of destruction in the city [112] However, by mid-1947, as east–west tensions over economic recovery in Germany and the Greek Civil War escalated, Eisenhower agreed with a containment policy to stop Soviet expansion [111]\n\n\n1948 presidential election\nIn June 1943, a visiting politician had suggested to Eisenhower that he might become president after the war Believing that a general should not participate in politics, Merlo J Pusey wrote that \"figuratively speaking,  [Eisenhower] kicked his political-minded visitor out of his office\" As others asked him about his political future, Eisenhower told one that he could not imagine wanting to be considered for any political job \"from dogcatcher to Grand High Supreme King of the Universe\", and another that he could not serve as Army Chief of Staff if others believed he had political ambitions In 1945, Truman told Eisenhower during the Potsdam Conference that if desired, the president would help the general win the 1948 election, [113] and in 1947 he offered to run as Eisenhower's running mate on the Democratic ticket if MacArthur won the Republican nomination [114]\n\n\nPresident at Columbia University and NATO Supreme Commander\nIn 1948, Eisenhower became President of Columbia University, an Ivy League university in New York City, where he was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa [116] The choice was subsequently characterized as not having been a good fit for either party [117] During that year, Eisenhower's memoir, Crusade in Europe, was published [118] It was a major financial success [119] Eisenhower sought the advice of Augusta National's Roberts about the tax implications of this, [119] and in due course Eisenhower's profit on the book was substantially aided by what author David Pietrusza calls \"a ruling without precedent\" by the Department of the Treasury  It held that Eisenhower was not a professional writer, but rather, marketing the lifetime asset of his experiences, and thus he had to pay only capital gains tax on his $635,000 advance instead of the much higher personal tax rate This ruling saved Eisenhower about $400,000 [120]\n\n\nPresidential campaign of 1952\nPresident Truman sensed a broad-based desire for an Eisenhower candidacy for president, and he again pressed him to run for the office as a Democrat in 1951 But Eisenhower voiced his disagreements with the Democrats and declared himself to be a Republican [139] A \"Draft Eisenhower\" movement in the Republican Party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the 1952 presidential election to counter the candidacy of non-interventionist Senator Robert A Taft The effort was a long struggle; Eisenhower had to be convinced that political circumstances had created a genuine duty to offer himself as a candidate and that there was a mandate from the public for him to be their president Henry Cabot Lodge Jr and others succeeded in convincing him, and he resigned his command at NATO in June 1952 to campaign full-time [140]\n\n\nElection of 1956\nIn the United States presidential election of 1956, Eisenhower, the popular incumbent, was re-elected The election was a re-match of 1952, as his opponent in 1956 was Stevenson, a former Illinois governor, whom Eisenhower had defeated four years earlier Compared to the 1952 election, Eisenhower gained Kentucky, Louisiana, and West Virginia from Stevenson, while losing Missouri His voters were less likely to bring up his leadership record Instead what stood out this time \"was the response to personal qualities — to his sincerity, his integrity and sense of duty, his virtue as a family man, his religious devotion, and his sheer likeableness.\" [150]\n\n\nPresidency (1953–1961)\nTruman and Eisenhower had minimal discussions about the transition of administrations due to a complete estrangement between them as a result of campaigning [151] Eisenhower selected Joseph M Dodge as his budget director, then asked Herbert Brownell Jr and Lucius D Clay to make recommendations for his cabinet appointments He accepted their recommendations without exception; they included John Foster Dulles and George M Humphrey with whom he developed his closest relationships, as well as Oveta Culp Hobby His cabinet consisted of several corporate executives and one labor leader, and one journalist dubbed it \"eight millionaires and a plumber\" [152] The cabinet was known for its lack of personal friends, office seekers, or experienced government administrators He also upgraded the role of the National Security Council in planning all phases of the Cold War [153]\n\n\nAtoms for Peace\nEisenhower gave the Atoms for Peace speech to the United Nations General Assembly on 8 December 1953, advocating for constructive use of nuclear fission for electrical energy and nuclear medicine instead of nuclear arms race proliferation The speech led to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 which allowed the civilian world to develop nuclear fission technology for peaceful and prosperous purposes [169] [170]\n\n\nInterstate Highway System\nEisenhower championed and signed the bill that authorized the Interstate Highway System in 1956 [171] He justified the project through the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 as essential to American security during the Cold War.\n\n\nARPA\nThe Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) was put together by Eisenhower and his Science Advisory Committee in early 1958 in response to the successful launch of the first orbital satellite from the Soviet Union Sputnik 1 ARPA eventually created the ARPANET which was a predecessor to the internet [176] [177]\n\n\nForeign policy\nThe United States foreign policy of the Dwight D Eisenhower administration, from 1953 to 1961, focused on the Cold War with the Soviet Union and its satellites The United States built up a stockpile of nuclear weapons and nuclear delivery systems to deter military threats and save money while cutting back on expensive Army combat units  A major uprising broke out in Hungary in 1956; the Eisenhower administration did not become directly involved, but condemned the military invasion by the Soviet Union Eisenhower sought to reach a nuclear test ban treaty with the Soviet Union, but following the 1960 U-2 incident the Kremlin canceled a scheduled summit in Paris.\n\n\nSpace Race\nEisenhower and the CIA had known since at least January 1957, nine months before Sputnik, that Russia had the capability to launch a small payload into orbit and was likely to do so within a year [178]\n\n\nKorean War, Free China and Red China\nIn late 1952, Eisenhower went to Korea and discovered a military and political stalemate Once in office, when the Chinese People's Volunteer Army began a buildup in the Kaesong sanctuary, he considered using nuclear weapons if an armistice was not reached Whether China was informed of the potential for nuclear force is unknown [186]  His earlier military reputation in Europe was effective with the Chinese communists [187] The National Security Council, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Strategic Air Command (SAC) devised detailed plans for nuclear war against Red China [188] With the death of Stalin in March 1953, Russian support for a Chinese communist hard-line weakened and China decided to compromise on the prisoner issue [189]\n\n\nSoutheast Asia\nEarly in 1953, the French asked Eisenhower for help in French Indochina against the Communists, supplied from China, who were fighting the First Indochina War Eisenhower sent Lt General John W O'Daniel to Vietnam to assess the French forces there [197] Chief of Staff Matthew Ridgway dissuaded the President from intervening by presenting a comprehensive estimate of the massive military deployment that would be necessary Eisenhower stated prophetically that \"this war would absorb our troops by divisions.\" [198]\n\n\nLegitimation of Francoist Spain\nThe Pact of Madrid, signed on September 23, 1953, by Francoist Spain and the United States, was a significant effort to break international isolation of Spain, together with the Concordat of 1953 This development came at a time when other victorious Allies and much of the rest of the world remained hostile [b] to a fascist regime sympathetic to the cause of the former Axis powers and established with Nazi assistance This accord took the form of three separate executive agreements that pledged the United States to furnish economic and military aid to Spain.\n\n\nMiddle East and Eisenhower doctrine\nEven before he was inaugurated Eisenhower accepted a request from the British government to restore the Shah of Iran (Mohammad Reza Pahlavi) to power He therefore authorized the CIA to overthrow Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh [209] This resulted in increased strategic control over Iranian oil by US and British companies [210]\n\n\n1960 U-2 incident\nOn 1 May 1960, a United States U-2 spy plane was shot down by the Soviet Air Defence Forces while conducting photographic aerial reconnaissance deep inside Soviet territory Flown by American pilot Francis Gary Powers, the aircraft had taken off from Peshawar, Pakistan, and crashed near Sverdlovsk (present-day Yekaterinburg), after being hit by a surface-to-air missile Powers parachuted to the ground and was captured.\n\n\nCivil rights\nWhile President Truman's 1948 Executive Order 9981 had begun the process of desegregating the Armed Forces, actual implementation had been slow Eisenhower made clear his stance in his first State of the Union address in February 1953, saying \"I propose to use whatever authority exists in the office of the President to end segregation in the District of Columbia, including the Federal Government, and any segregation in the Armed Forces\" [218] When he encountered opposition from the services, he used government control of military spending to force the change through, stating \"Wherever Federal Funds are expended ..., I do not see how any American can justify .. a discrimination in the expenditure of those funds\" [219] When Robert B Anderson, Eisenhower's first Secretary of the Navy, argued that the US Navy must recognize the \"customs and usages prevailing in certain geographic areas of our country which the Navy had no part in creating,\" Eisenhower overruled him: \"We have not taken and we shall not take a single backward step There must be no second class citizens in this country.\" [220]\n\n\nRelations with Congress\nEisenhower had a Republican Congress for only his first two years in office; in the Senate, Republicans held the majority by a one-vote margin Despite being Eisenhower's political opponent for the 1952 Republican presidential nomination, Senator Majority Leader Robert A Taft assisted Eisenhower a great deal by promoting the President's proposals among the \"Old Guard\" Republican Senators Taft's death in July 1953—six months into Eisenhower's presidency—affected Eisenhower both personally and professionally The President noted he had lost \"a dear friend\" with Taft's passing Eisenhower disliked Taft's successor as Majority Leader, Senator William Knowland, and the relationship between the two men led to tension between the Senate and the White House [232]\n\n\nJudicial appointments\nEisenhower appointed the following Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States:\n\n\nSupreme Court\nEisenhower appointed the following Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States:\n\n\nStates admitted to the Union\nTwo states were admitted to the Union during Eisenhower's presidency.\n\n\nHealth issues\nEisenhower began chain smoking cigarettes at West Point, often three or four packs a day He joked that he \"gave  [himself] an order\" to stop cold turkey in 1949 However, Evan Thomas says the true story was more complex At first, he removed cigarettes and ashtrays, but that did not work He told a friend:\n\n\nEnd of presidency\nThe 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution, which set a two-term limit on the presidency, was ratified in 1951 Eisenhower was the first president constitutionally prevented from serving a third term.\n\n\nPost-presidency (1961–1969)\nFollowing the presidency, Eisenhower moved to the place where he and Mamie had spent much of their post-war time, a working farm adjacent to the battlefield at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, 70 miles (110 km) from his ancestral home in Elizabethville, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania [270] [271] They also maintained a retirement home in Palm Desert, California [272]\n\n\nDeath\nAt 12:25 p.m on March 28, 1969, Eisenhower died from congestive heart failure at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C., at age 78 [277] The following day, his body was moved to the Washington National Cathedral's Bethlehem Chapel, where he lay in repose for 28 hours [278] He was then transported to the United States Capitol, where he lay in state in the Capitol Rotunda on March 30 and 31 [279] A state funeral was conducted at the Washington National Cathedral on March 31 [280] The president and First Lady, Richard and Pat Nixon, attended, as did former president Lyndon Johnson Also among the 2,000 guests that were invited were the UN Secretary-General U Thant and 191 foreign delegates from 78 countries, including 10 foreign heads of state and government Guests included President Charles de Gaulle of France, who was in the United States for the first time since the state funeral of John F Kennedy, [281] Chancellor Kurt-Georg Kiesinger of West Germany, King Baudouin of Belgium and Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran [280]\n\n\nLegacy and memory\nEisenhower's reputation declined in the immediate years after he left office During his presidency, he was widely seen by critics as an inactive, uninspiring, golf-playing president This was in stark contrast to his vigorous young successor, John F Kennedy, who was 26 years his junior Despite his unprecedented use of Army troops to enforce a federal desegregation order at Central High School in Little Rock, Eisenhower was criticized for his reluctance to support the civil rights movement to the degree that activists wanted Eisenhower also attracted criticism for his handling of the 1960 U-2 incident and the associated international embarrassment, [285] [286] for the Soviet Union's perceived leadership in the nuclear arms race and the Space Race, and for his failure to publicly oppose McCarthyism [287] In particular, Eisenhower was criticized for failing to defend George C Marshall from attacks by Joseph McCarthy, though he privately deplored McCarthy's tactics [288]\n\n\nTributes and memorials\nThe Interstate Highway System is officially known as the \"Dwight D Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways\" It was inspired in part by Eisenhower's experiences in World War II, where he recognized the advantages of the autobahn system in Germany [174] Commemorative signs reading \"Eisenhower Interstate System\" and bearing Eisenhower's permanent 5-star rank insignia were introduced in 1993 and now are displayed throughout the Interstate System Several highways are also named for him, including the Eisenhower Expressway (Interstate 290) near Chicago, the Eisenhower Tunnel on Interstate 70 west of Denver, and Interstate 80 in California [302]\n\n\nHonors\nEisenhower

The G-patch domain is a conserved sequence motif found in various proteins that play important roles in different cellular processes. While the function of GPATCH2L is still unknown, its paralog, GPATCH3, has been shown to participate in innate immune response and ocular and craniofacial development. In this article, we will provide an overview of GPATCH2L, including its transcript variants, protein structure, interacting proteins, gene regulation, and evolution.\n\n**Transcript Variants**\n\nThere are 23 different transcript variants in GPATCH2L Homo sapiens. The most common is transcript variant 1, and each transcript variant uses different exons. The transcript variants are generated through alternative splicing, which is a process where a single gene can produce multiple proteins with different functions.\n\n**Protein**\n\nThe GPATCH2L human protein (NP_060396) has a molecular weight of 54,260 Da and consists of 482 amino acids with a predicted isoelectric point of 8.77. It has 17 different isoforms, and the most common is isoform 1. Every human GPATCH2L isoform has a GPATCH2L domain, but no other significant smaller repeats were found. The human GPATCH2L protein in prostate tissue reveals distinct positivity in glandular cells, according to immunohistochemical staining of human prostate GPATCH2L Antibody (HPA018856) in IHC from The Human Protein Atlas.\n\n**Secondary and Tertiary Structure**\n\nTwo figures show the predicted tertiary structure of GPATCH2L human protein from AlphaFold. Four alpha helix bundles and two beta sheets are observable and these are annotated on conceptual translation.\n\n**Interacting Proteins**\n\nGPATCH2L human protein is known to interact with KRR1, DDX10, and NOL6 within the nucleolus and nucleus.\n\n**Gene Level Regulation**\n\nGPATCH2L human gene has a promoter located in ch14:76150912 - 76151972. The length of the promoter is 1061 bp.\n\n**Transcription Factor Binding Sites**\n\nIn the below table, 5 transcription factors are predicted to bind within a conserved section of the transcriptional regulatory region. Unlike 19 transcription factors in the table, MAZF is only specifically active in cartilage and skeleton tissues. Also, PLAG is only specifically active in bone marrow cells, digestive system, embryonic structures, endocrine system, germ cells, and hematopoietic system.\n\n**Transcript Level Regulation**\n\nRNA-seq was performed on tissue samples from 95 human individuals representing 27 different tissues to identify tissue-specificity protein-coding genes at NCBI. RNA-seq data shows high expression within the bone marrow, testis, and brain tissue in GPATCH2L human mRNA. Tissues with low expression are the pancreas, liver, and salivary glands.\n\n**Expression Pattern**\n\nRNA-seq was performed on tissue samples from 95 human individuals representing 27 different tissues to identify tissue-specificity protein-coding genes at NCBI. RNA-seq data shows high expression within the bone marrow, testis, and brain tissue in GPATCH2L human mRNA. Tissues with low expression are the pancreas, liver, and salivary glands.\n\n**NCBI GEO Profile Across All Tissues**\n\nSignificantly different gene expressions in tissues are shown in a microarray-assessed tissue expression pattern (GDS596) in GPATCH2L Homo sapiens from NCBI GEO. The high gene expressions in cerebellum, fetal brain, bone marrow, ovary, prostate, and lung tissues in RNA-seq data are extremely low in GDS596. However, the gene expressions in liver, pancreas, salivary gland, and fetal liver tissues remain low in every gene database record.\n\n**Predicted Stem-Loops and miRNA Targeting**\n\nThe nucleic acid secondary structure of human GPATCH2L (5’UTR) shows one stem-loop, inframe stop codon, start codon, and exon boundaries. In this stem-loop, g and g are not connected. However, these are conserved in the multiple sequence alignment of this stem-loop region. In the 3'UTR figure, there are 10 stem-loops and these are zoomed in another figure. Although 3-3), 3-6), 3-9) show weird structure (3: CCTT, 6: CAT, TTC, 9:GTG), every letter is conserved in its multiple sequence alignment. Especially, 3-8) includes hsa-miRNA-205 in its stem-loop, and every letter of hsa-miRNA-205 is conserved in the multiple sequence alignment.\n\n**Protein Level Regulation**\n\nGPATCH2L protein is highly expressed in the bone marrow tissues, according to immunohistochemical staining of human hematopoietic cells in bone marrow tissue GPATCH2L Antibody (HPA018856) in IHC from The Human Protein Atlas. Also, it has shown that GPATCH2L protein is highly expressed in human respiratory epithelial cells in bronchus tissue and human cells in endometrial stroma and glandular cells in endometrium tissue.\n\n**Immunochemistry (IHC)**\n\nGPATCH2L protein is highly expressed in the bone marrow tissues, according to immunohistochemical staining of human hematopoietic cells in bone marrow tissue GPATCH2L Antibody (HPA018856) in IHC from The Human Protein Atlas. Also, it has shown that GPATCH2L protein is highly expressed in human respiratory epithelial cells in bronchus tissue and human cells in endometrial stroma and glandular cells in endometrium tissue.\n\n**Protein Localization and Abundance**\n\nGPATCH2L Homo sapiens protein is mainly localized to the nucleoplasm, according to GPATCH2L antibody staining from The Human Protein Atlas and Thermo Fisher Scientific. Also, 82.6% of GPATCH2L human protein is predicted to be located in the nucleus, according to PSORT II and pI/MW tool from Expasy. GPATCH2L human protein is Isoleucine poor (I−), Serine rich (S+), and Arginine rich (R+) compared to other human proteins.\n\n**Homology and Evolution**\n\nGPATCH2L Homo sapiens has orthologs in Mammalia, Reptilia, Amphibia, Mollusca, Arthropoda, Ave, Fish, and Invertebrate. The values [query cover values (%), sequence identity (%), and sequence similarity (%)] decrease as the group changes into more distant orthologs from Homo sapiens, such as Invertebrates. However, frogs are unusual in that they have a very low sequence identity (36.8% - 38.0%). Also, the class of fungi and bacteria that contain GPATCH2L homologs was not able to be found using NCBI Homologene.\n\n**Orthologs and Paralogs**\n\nGPATCH2L Homo sapiens has orthologs in Mammalia, Reptilia, Amphibia, Mollusca, Arthropoda, Ave, Fish, and Invertebrate. The values [query cover values (%), sequence identity (%), and sequence similarity (%)] decrease as the group changes into more distant orthologs from Homo sapiens, such as Invertebrates. However, frogs are unusual in that they have a very low sequence identity (36.8% - 38.0%). Also, the class of fungi and bacteria that contain GPATCH2L homologs was not able to be found using NCBI Homologene.\n\n**Evolution**\n\nGPATCH2L evolves more slowly compared to Fibrinogen Alpha Chain but faster than Cytochrome C. In the unrooted tree of GPATCH2L protein, only one mammal (human) is included since every species in mammals is very closely related to each other, showing various short lines Arthropoda in invertebrates shows the longest line, meaning that they have diverged the longest.\n\n**Distant Homologs**\n\nThe closest organisms that do/do not have GPATCH2L are as follows: In reptiles, GPATCH2L homologs in crocodile, turtle, snake, lizard, gecko were found by using NCBI Blast, while there were no homologs in skink, chameleon, and iguana. In amphibians, GPATCH2L homologs in frog, toad, and salamander were found by using NCBI Blast, while other types of amphibians, such as caecilian, microsauria, and labyrinthodontia, do not contain GPATCH2L gene. In Invertebrates, NCBI Blast demonstrates that scallop, starfish, octopus, spider have GPATCH2L gene, but sponge and jellyfish do not. Lastly, there are no GPATCH2L homolog in fungi and bacteria, according to NCBI Blast.\n\n**Function and Biochemistry**\n\nGPATCH2L’s function is still unknown; however, the paralog GPATCH3 has been shown to participate in innate immune response within mammals. GPATCH 3 negatively regulates RLR-mediated innate antiviral response, disrupting VISA signalosome assembly. It has also shown to participate in ocular and craniofacial development.\n\n**Clinical Significance**\n\nAn SNP (rs935332) within the human GPATCH2L region is related to scleroderma renal crisis (SRC), according to the validation cohort. Immunostaining of renal biopsy sections demonstrated an increase in tubular expression of GPATCH2L, despite the absence of any genetic replication for the associated SNP.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"GPATCH2L\" following this outline:\n\n\nTranscript variants\nThere are 23 different transcript variants in GPATCH2L Homo sapiens The most common is transcript variant 1 and each transcript variant uses different exons.\n\n\nProtein\nThe GPATCH2L human protein (NP_060396) has a molecular weight of 54,260 Da and consists of 482 amino acids with a predicted isoelectric point of 8.77 [8] It has 17 different isoforms and the most common is isoform 1 Every human GPATCH2L isoform has a GPATCH2L domain, but no other significant smaller repeats were found as be seen in the schematic illustration below Also, human GPATCH2L protein in prostate tissue reveals distinct positivity in glandular cells, according to immunohistochemical staining of human prostate GPATCH2L Antibody (HPA018856) in IHC from The Human Protein Atlas [9]\n\n\nSecondary and tertiary structure\nTwo figures show the predicted tertiary structure of GPATCH2L human protein from AlphaFold [11] Four Alpha helix bundles and two Beta sheets are observable and these are annotated on conceptual translation.\n\n\nInteracting proteins\nGPATCH2L human protein is known to interact with KRR1, DDX10, and NOL6 within the nucleolus and nucleus.\n\n\nGene level regulation\nGPATCH2L human gene has a promoter  [GXP_207451]\tlocated in ch14:76150912 -

ABV.\n\n\nRecreational\nDrinking culture is the set of traditions and social behaviors that surround the consumption of alcoholic beverages as a recreational drug and social lubricant Although alcoholic beverages and social attitudes toward drinking vary around the world, nearly every civilization has independently discovered the processes of brewing beer, fermenting wine and distilling spirits [23]\n\n\nDrinking styles\nIn today's society, there is a growing awareness of this, reflected in the variety of approaches to alcohol use, each emphasizing responsible choices Sober curious describes a mindset or approach where someone is consciously choosing to reduce or eliminate alcohol consumption, not drinking and driving, being aware of your surroundings, not pressuring others to drink, and being able to quit anytime However, they are not necessarily committed to complete sobriety.\n\n\nBinge drinking\nBinge drinking is a style of drinking that is popular in several countries worldwide, and overlaps somewhat with social drinking since it is often done in groups The degree of intoxication however, varies between and within various cultures that engage in this practice A binge on alcohol can occur over hours, last up to several days, or in the event of extended abuse, even weeks Due to the long term effects of alcohol abuse, binge drinking is considered to be a major public health issue [126]\n\n\nDefinition\nHeavy alcohol use is defined differently by various health organizations The CDC defines \"Current heavier drinker\" as consuming more than 7 drinks per week for women and more than 14 drinks per week for men Additionally, \"Heavy drinking day (also referred to as episodic heavy drinking\" is characterized as having 4 or more drinks on a single occasion for women and 5 or more for men, in the past year [40] The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) provides gender-specific guidelines for heavy drinking According to NIAAA, men who consume five or more US standard drinks in a single day or 15 or more drinks within a week are considered heavy drinkers For women, the threshold is lower, with four or more drinks in a day or eight or more drinks per week classified as heavy drinking In contrast, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) takes a different approach to defining heavy alcohol use SAMHSA considers heavy alcohol use to be engaging in binge drinking behaviors on five or more days within a month This definition focuses more on the frequency of excessive drinking episodes rather than specific drink counts [28]\n\n\nLight, moderate, responsible, and social drinking\nLight drinking, moderate drinking, responsible drinking, and social drinking are often used interchangeably, but with slightly different connotations:\n\n\nHeavy drinking\nA 2007 study at the University of Texas at Austin monitored the drinking habits of 541 students over two football seasons It revealed that high-profile game days ranked among the heaviest drinking occasions, similar to New Year's Eve Male students increased their consumption for all games, while socially active female students drank heavily during away games Lighter drinkers also showed a higher likelihood of risky behaviors during away games as their intoxication increased This research highlights specific drinking patterns linked to collegiate sports events [38]\n\n\nDefinition\nHeavy alcohol use is defined differently by various health organizations The CDC defines \"Current heavier drinker\" as consuming more than 7

headlines about studies associating light or moderate drinking with health benefits and reduced mortality Some researchers have suggested there are health benefits from wine, especially red wine, and that a glass a day can be good for the heart But there's more to the story No research has proved a cause-and-effect link between drinking alcohol and better heart health.\" [51]\n\n\nDutch courage\nDutch courage, also known as pot-valiance or liquid courage, refers to courage gained from intoxication with alcohol.\n\n\nCriminal\nAlbeit not a valid intoxication defense, weakening the inhibitions by drunkenness is occasionally used as a tool to commit planned offenses such as property crimes including theft and robbery, and violent crimes including assault, murder, or rape – which sometimes but not always occurs in alcohol-facilitated sexual assaults where the victim is also drugged.\n\n\nWarfare\nAlcohol has a long association of military use, and has been called \"liquid courage\" for its role in preparing troops for battle, anaesthetize injured soldiers, and celebrate military victories It has also served as a coping mechanism for combat stress reactions and a means of decompression from combat to everyday life However, this reliance on alcohol can have negative consequences for physical and mental health [67] Military and veteran populations face significant challenges in addressing the co-occurrence of PTSD and alcohol use disorder [68] Military personnel who show symptoms of PTSD, major depressive disorder, alcohol use disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder show higher levels of suicidal ideation [69]\n\n\nFood energy\nThe use of alcohol as a staple food source is considered inconvenient due to the fact that it increases the blood alcohol content (BAC) However, alcohol is a significant source of food energy for individuals with alcoholism and those who engage in binge drinking; For example, individuals with drunkorexia, engage in the combination of self-imposed malnutrition and binge drinking to avoid weight gain from alcohol, to save money for purchasing alcohol, [74] and to facilitate alcohol intoxication [75] Also, in alcoholics who get most of their daily calories from alcohol, a deficiency of thiamine can produce Korsakoff's syndrome, which is associated with serious brain damage [76]\n\n\nSpiritual\nSpiritual use of moderate alcohol consumption is found in some religions and schools with esoteric influences, including the Hindu tantra sect Aghori, in the Sufi Bektashi Order and Alevi Jem ceremonies, [80] in the Rarámuri religion, in the Japanese religion Shinto, [81] by the new religious movement Thelema, in Vajrayana Buddhism, and in Vodou faith of Haiti.\n\n\nContraindication\nIn the US, alcohol is subject to the FDA drug labeling Pregnancy Category X (Contraindicated in pregnancy).\n\n\nPregnancy\nIn the US, alcohol is subject to the FDA drug labeling Pregnancy Category X (Contraindicated in pregnancy).\n\n\nRisks\nEthanol is classified as a teratogen [83] [84] [medical citation needed]—a substance known to cause birth defects; according to the U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), alcohol consumption by women who are not using birth control increases the risk of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) This group of conditions encompasses fetal alcohol syndrome, partial fetal alcohol syndrome, alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, static encephalopathy, and alcohol-related birth defects [85] The CDC currently recommends complete abstinence from alcoholic beverages for women of child-bearing age who are pregnant, trying to become pregnant, or are sexually active and not using birth control [86]\n\n\nFetal alcohol spectrum disorder\nEthanol is classified as a teratogen [83] [84] [medical citation needed]—a substance known to cause birth defects; according to the U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), alcohol consumption by women who are not using birth control increases the risk of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) This group of conditions encompasses fetal alcohol syndrome, partial fetal alcohol syndrome, alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, static encephalopathy, and alcohol-related birth defects [85] The CDC currently recommends complete abstinence from alcoholic beverages for women of child-bearing age who are pregnant, trying to become pregnant, or are sexually active and not using birth control [86]\n\n\nMiscarriage\nMiscarriage, also known in medical terms as a spontaneous abortion, is the death and expulsion of an embryo or fetus before it can survive independently.\n\n\nSudden infant death syndrome\nDrinking of alcohol by parents is linked to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) [89] One study found a positive correlation between the two during New Years celebrations and weekends [90] Another found that alcohol use disorder was linked to a more than doubling of risk [91]\n\n\nAdverse effects\nAlcohol has a variety of short-term and long-term adverse effects Alcohol has both short-term, and long-term effects on the memory, and sleep It also has reinforcement-related adverse effects, including alcoholism, dependence, and withdrawal; The most severe withdrawal symptoms, associated with physical dependence, can include seizures and delirium tremens, which in rare cases can be fatal Alcohol use is directly related to considerable morbidity and mortality, for instance due to intoxication and alcohol-related health problems [92] The World Health Organization advises that there is no safe level of alcohol consumption [93]\n\n\nShort-term effects\nThe amount of ethanol in the body is typically quantified by blood alcohol content (BAC); weight of ethanol per unit volume of blood Small doses of ethanol, in general, are stimulant-like [103] and produce euphoria and relaxation; people experiencing these symptoms tend to become talkative and less inhibited, and may exhibit poor judgement At higher dosages (BAC > 1 gram/liter), ethanol acts as a central nervous system (CNS) depressant, [103] producing at progressively higher dosages, impaired sensory and motor function, slowed cognition, stupefaction, unconsciousness, and possible death Ethanol is commonly consumed as a recreational substance, especially while socializing, due to its psychoactive effects.\n\n\nCentral nervous system impairment\nAlcohol causes generalized CNS depression, is a positive allosteric GABAA modulator and is associated and related with decreased anxiety, decreased social inhibition, sedation, impairment of cognitive, memory, and sensory function, cognitive, memory, motor, and sensory impairment It slows and impairs cognition and reaction time and the cognitive skills, impairs judgement, interferes with motor function resulting in motor incoordination, numbness, impairs memory formation, and causes sensory impairment.\n\n\nGastrointestinal effects\nAlcohol can cause nausea and vomiting in sufficiently high amounts (varying by person).\n\n\nHangover\nA hangover is the experience of various unpleasant physiological and psychological effects usually following the consumption of alcohol, such as wine, beer, and liquor Hangovers can last for several hours or for more than 24 hours Typical symptoms of a hangover may include headache, drowsiness, concentration problems, dry mouth, dizziness, fatigue, gastrointestinal distress (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), absence of hunger, light sensitivity, depression, sweating, hyper-excitability, irritability, and anxiety (often referred to as \"hangxiety\") [106] [107]\n\n\nHoliday heart syndrome\nHoliday heart syndrome, also known as alcohol-induced atrial arrhythmias, is a syndrome defined by an irregular heartbeat and palpitations [111] associated with high levels of ethanol consumption [112] [113] Holiday heart syndrome was discovered in 1978 when Philip Ettinger discovered the connection between arrhythmia and alcohol consumption [114] It received its common name as it is associated with the binge drinking common during the holidays [115] It is unclear how common this syndrome is 5-10% of cases of atrial fibrillation may be related to this condition, but it could be as high 63% [116]\n\n\nPositional alcohol nystagmus\nPositional alcohol nystagmus (PAN) is nystagmus (visible jerkiness in eye movement) produced when the head is placed in a sideways position PAN occurs when the specific gravity of the membrane space of the semicircular canals in the ear differs from the specific gravity of the fluid in the canals because of the presence of alcohol [117]\n\n\nAllergic-like reactions\nEthanol-containing beverages can cause alcohol flush reactions, exacerbations of rhinitis and, more seriously and commonly, bronchoconstriction in patients with a history of asthma, and in some cases, urticarial skin eruptions, and systemic dermatitis Such reactions can occur within 1–60 minutes of ethanol ingestion, and may be caused by: [120]\n\n\nLong-term effects\nAccording to The Lancet, 'four industries (tobacco, unhealthy food, fossil fuel, and alcohol) are responsible for at least a third of global deaths per year' [123] In 2024, the World Health Organization published a report including these figures [124] [125]\n\n\nAlcoholism\nAlcoholism or its medical diagnosis alcohol use disorder refers to alcohol addiction, alcohol dependence, dipsomania, and/or alcohol abuse It is a major problem and many health problems as well as death can result from excessive alcohol use [128] [92] Alcohol dependence is linked to a lifespan that is reduced by about 12 years relative to the average person [128] In 2004, it was estimated that 4% of deaths worldwide were attributable to alcohol use [92] Deaths from alcohol are split about evenly between acute causes (e.g., overdose, accidents) and chronic conditions [92] The leading chronic alcohol-related condition associated with death is alcoholic liver disease [92] Alcohol dependence is also associated with cognitive impairment and organic brain damage [128] Some researchers have found that even one alcoholic drink a day increases an individual's risk of health problems by 0.4% [129]\n\n\nBrain damage\nWhile many people associate alcohol's effects with intoxication, the long-term impact of alcohol on the brain can be severe Binge drinking, or heavy episodic drinking, can lead to alcohol-related brain damage that occurs after a relatively short period of time This brain damage increases the risk of alcohol-related dementia, and abnormalities in mood and cognitive abilities.\n\n\nDementia\nAlcohol-related dementia (ARD) is a form of dementia caused by long-term, excessive consumption of alcohol, resulting in neurological damage and impaired cognitive function [141]\n\n\nMarchiafava–Bignami disease\nMarchiafava–Bignami disease is a progressive neurological disease of alcohol use disorder, characterized by corpus callosum demyelination and necrosis and subsequent atrophy The disease was first described in 1903 by the Italian pathologists Amico Bignami and Ettore Marchiafava in an Italian Chianti drinker [142] [143]\n\n\nLiver damage\nConsuming more than 30 grams of pure alcohol per day over an extended period can significantly increase the risk of developing alcoholic liver disease [145] During the metabolism of alcohol via the respective dehydrogenases, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is converted into reduced NAD Normally, NAD is used to metabolize fats in the liver, and as such alcohol competes with these fats for the use of NAD Prolonged exposure to alcohol means that fats accumulate in the liver, leading to the term 'fatty liver' Continued consumption (such as in alcohol use disorder) then leads to cell death in the hepatocytes as the fat stores reduce the function of the cell to the point of death These cells are then replaced with scar tissue, leading to the condition called cirrhosis.\n\n\nCancer\nAlcoholic beverages have been classified as carcinogenic by leading health organizations for more than two decades, including the WHO's IARC (Group 1 carcinogens) [19] and the U.S NTP, [146] raising concerns about the potential cancer risk associated with alcohol consumption.\n\n\nCardiovascular disease\nExcessive daily alcohol consumption and binge drinking can cause a higher risk of stroke, coronary artery disease, heart failure, fatal hypertensive disease, and fatal aortic aneurysm [151]\n\n\nCardiomyopathy\nAlcoholic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is a disease in which the long-term consumption of alcohol leads to heart failure [156] ACM is a type of dilated cardiomyopathy The heart is unable to pump blood efficiently, leading to heart failure It can affect other parts of the body if the heart failure is severe It is most common in males between the ages of 35 and 50.\n\n\nHearing loss\nAlcohol, classified as an ototoxin (ear toxin), [157] can contribute to hearing loss sometimes referred to as \"cocktail deafness\" after exposure to loud noises in drinking environments [158] [159]\n\n\nWithdrawal syndrome\nDiscontinuation of alcohol after extended heavy use and associated tolerance development (resulting in dependence) can result in withdrawal Alcohol withdrawal can cause confusion, paranoia, anxiety, insomnia, agitation, tremors, fever, nausea, vomiting, autonomic dysfunction, seizures, and hallucinations In severe cases, death can result.\n\n\nCortisol\nResearch has looked into the effects of alcohol on the amount of cortisol that is produced in the human body Continuous consumption of alcohol over an extended period of time has been shown to raise cortisol levels in the body Cortisol is released during periods of high stress, and can result in the temporary shut down of other physical processes, causing physical damage to the body.\n\n\nGout\nThere is a strong association between gout the consumption of alcohol, and sugar-sweetened beverages, [165] with wine presenting somewhat less of a risk than beer or spirits [166] [167]\n\n\nKetoacidosis\nAlcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA) is a specific group of symptoms and metabolic state related to alcohol use [168] Symptoms often include abdominal pain, vomiting, agitation, a fast respiratory rate, and a specific \"fruity\" smell [169] Consciousness is generally normal [170] Complications may include sudden death [170]\n\n\nMental disorders\nMental disorders can be a significant risk factor for alcohol abuse.\n\n\nAustrian syndrome\nAustrian syndrome, also known as Osler's triad, is a medical condition that was named after Robert Austrian in 1957 The presentation of the condition consists of pneumonia, endocarditis, and meningitis, all caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae It is associated with alcoholism due to hyposplenism (reduced splenic functioning) and can be seen in males between the ages of 40 and 60 years old [174] Robert Austrian was not the first one to describe the condition, but Richard Heschl (around 1860s) or William Osler were not able to link the signs to the bacteria because microbiology was not yet developed.\n\n\nPolyneuropathy\nAlcoholic polyneuropathy is a neurological disorder in which peripheral nerves throughout the body malfunction simultaneously It is defined by axonal degeneration in neurons of both the sensory and motor systems and initially occurs at the distal ends of the longest axons in the body This nerve damage causes an individual to experience pain and motor weakness, first in the feet and hands and then progressing centrally Alcoholic polyneuropathy is caused primarily by chronic alcoholism; however, vitamin deficiencies are also known to contribute to its development.\n\n\nSpecific population\nBabies exposed to alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and some antidepressants (SSRIs) during pregnancy may experience neonatal withdrawal [175]\n\n\nPregnant women\nBabies exposed to alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and some antidepressants (SSRIs) during pregnancy may experience neonatal withdrawal [175]\n\n\nOther effects\nAlcohol consumption is associated with lower sperm concentration, percentage of normal morphology, and semen volume, but not sperm motility [178]\n\n\nSocial issues\nAlcohol use is stereotypically associated with crime, [189] both violent and non-violent [128] Some crimes are uniquely tied to alcohol, such as public intoxication or underage drinking, while others are simply more likely to occur together with alcohol consumption Crime perpetrators are much more likely to be intoxicated than crime victims Many alcohol laws have been passed to criminalize various alcohol-related activities [189] [190] Underage drinking and drunk driving are the most prevalent alcohol-specific offenses in the United States [189] and a major problem in many countries worldwide [191] [192] [193] About one-third of arrests in the United States involve alcohol misuse, [128] and arrests for alcohol-related crimes constitute a high proportion of all arrests made by police in the U.S and elsewhere [194] In general, programs aimed at reducing society's consumption of alcohol, including education in schools, are seen as an effective long-term solution Strategies aiming to reduce alcohol consumption among adult offenders have various estimates of effectiveness [195] Policing alcohol-related street disorder and enforcing compliance checks of alcohol-dispensing businesses has proven successful in reducing public perception of and fear of criminal activities [189]\n\n\nAlcohol-related crimes\nAlcohol use is stereotypically associated with crime, [189] both violent and non-violent [128] Some crimes are uniquely tied to alcohol, such as public intoxication or underage drinking, while others are simply more likely to occur together with alcohol consumption Crime perpetrators are much more likely to be intoxicated than crime victims Many alcohol laws have been passed to criminalize various alcohol-related activities [189] [190] Underage drinking and drunk driving are the most prevalent alcohol-specific offenses in the United States [189] and a major problem in many countries worldwide [191] [192] [193] About one-third of arrests in the United States involve alcohol misuse, [128] and arrests for alcohol-related crimes constitute a high proportion of all arrests made by police in the U.S and elsewhere [194] In general, programs aimed at reducing society's consumption of alcohol, including education in schools, are seen as an effective long-term solution Strategies aiming to reduce alcohol consumption among adult offenders have various estimates of effectiveness [195] Policing alcohol-related street disorder and enforcing compliance checks of alcohol-dispensing businesses has proven successful in reducing public perception of and fear of criminal activities [189]\n\n\nPublic-order crimes\nPublic-order crimes caused by drinking include drunk driving, domestic violence, and alcohol-related sexual assaults.\n\n\nAutomobile accidents\nA 2002 study found 41% of people fatally injured in traffic accidents were in alcohol-related crashes [200] Misuse of alcohol is associated with more than 40% of deaths that occur in automobile accidents every year [128] The risk of a fatal car accident increases exponentially with the level of alcohol in the driver's blood [201]\n\n\nNegligence\nNegligence in alcohol consumption can have a ripple effect on environmentally responsible behavior Examples:\n\n\nPublic drunkenness\nPublic drunkenness or intoxication is a common problem in many jurisdictions Public intoxication laws vary widely by jurisdiction, but include public nuisance laws, open-container laws, and prohibitions on drinking alcohol in public or certain areas The offenders are often lower class individuals and this crime has a very high recidivism rate, with numerous instances of repeated instances of the arrest, jail, release without treatment cycle The high number of arrests for public drunkenness often reflects rearrests of the same offenders [194]\n\n\nSexual assaults\nRape is any sexual activity that occurs without the freely given consent of one of the parties involved This includes alcohol-facilitated sexual assault which is considered rape in most if not all jurisdictions, [207] or non-consensual condom removal which is criminalized in some countries (see the map below).\n\n\nAlcohol-facilitated sexual assault\nOne of the most common date rape drugs is alcohol, [211] [212] [213] administered either surreptitiously [214] or consumed voluntarily, [211] rendering the victim unable to make informed decisions or give consent The perpetrator then facilitates sexual assault or rape, a crime known as alcohol- or drug-facilitated sexual assault (DFSA) [215] [207] [216] However, sex with an unconscious victim is considered rape in most if not all jurisdictions, and some assailants have committed \"rapes of convenience\" whereby they have assaulted a victim after he or she had become unconscious from drinking too much [217] The risk of individuals either experiencing or perpetrating sexual violence and risky sexual behavior increases with alcohol abuse, [218] and by the consumption of caffeinated alcoholic drinks [219] [220]\n\n\nNon-consensual condom removal\nNon-consensual condom removal, or \"stealthing\", [221] is the practice of a person removing a condom during sexual intercourse without consent, when their sex partner has only consented to condom-protected sex [222] [223] Purposefully damaging a condom before or during intercourse may also be referred to as stealthing, [224] regardless of who damaged the condom.\n\n\nWartime sexual violence\nThe use of alcohol is a documented factor in wartime sexual violence.\n\n\nViolent crime\nThe World Health Organization has noted that out of social problems created by the harmful use of alcohol, \"crime and violence related to alcohol consumption\" are likely the most significant issue [198] In the United States, 15% of robberies, 63% of intimate partner violence incidents, 37% of sexual assaults, 45–46% of physical assaults and 40–45% of homicides (murders) involved use of alcohol [230] [196] A 1983 study for the United States found that 54% of violent crime perpetrators, arrested in that country, had been consuming alcohol before their offenses [194] In 2002, it was estimated that 1 million violent crimes in the U.S were related to alcohol use [128] More than 43% of violent encounters with police involve alcohol [128] Alcohol is implicated in more than two-thirds of cases of intimate partner violence [128] Studies also suggest there may be links between alcohol abuse and child abuse [189] In the United Kingdom, in 2015/2016, 39% of those involved in violent crimes were under alcohol influence [231] A significant portion, 40%, of homicide victims tested positive for alcohol in the US [232] International studies are similar, with an estimate that 63% of violent crimes worldwide involves the use of alcohol [196]\n\n\nMethanol laced alcohol\nOutbreaks of methanol poisoning have occurred when methanol is used to lace moonshine (bootleg liquor) [234] This is commonly done to bulk up the original product to gain profit Because of its similarities in both appearance and odor to ethanol (the alcohol in beverages), it is difficult to differentiate between the two.\n\n\nAlternative routes of administration\nAlternative methods of alcohol administration like alcohol enema, alcohol inhalation, vodka eyeballing, or using alcohol powder (which can be added to water to make an alcoholic beverage, or inhaled with a nebulizer), all carry significant health risks.\n\n\nBinge drinking\nBinge drinking is a style of drinking that is popular in several countries worldwide, and overlaps somewhat with social drinking since it is often done in groups The degree of intoxication however, varies between and within various cultures that engage in this practice A binge on alcohol can occur over hours, last up to several days, or in the event of extended abuse, even weeks Due to the long term effects of alcohol abuse, binge drinking is considered to be a major public health issue [126]\n\n\nEmotional issues\nIn emotional self-regulation, some people turn to drugs such as alcohol Drug use, an example of response modulation, can be used to alter emotion-associated physiological responses For example, alcohol can produce sedative and anxiolytic effects [243] A 2013 study found that immature defense mechanisms are linked to placing a higher value on junk food, alcohol, and television [244]\n\n\nHurtful communication\nAlcohol may cause hurtful communication.\n\n\nDrunk dialing\nDrunk dialing refers to an intoxicated person making phone calls that they would not likely make if sober, often a lonely individual calling former or current love interests.\n\n\nIn vino veritas\nIn vino veritas is a Latin phrase that means 'in wine, there is truth', suggesting a person under the influence of alcohol is more likely to speak their hidden thoughts and desires.\n\n\nRisky sexual behavior\nSome studies have made a connection between hookup culture and substance use [249] Most students said that their hookups occurred after drinking alcohol [249] [250] [251] Frietas stated that in her study, the relationships between drinking and the party scene and between alcohol and hookup culture were \"impossible to miss\" [252]: 41 \n\n\nSexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancy\nAlcohol intoxication is associated with an increased risk that people will become involved in risky sexual behaviors, such as unprotected sex [255] Both men, [256] and women, [257] reported higher intentions to avoid using a condom when they were intoxicated by alcohol.\n\n\nSocietal damage\nAlcohol causes a plethora of detrimental effects in society [128] A 2023 systematic review estimated the societal costs of alcohol use to be around 2.6% of the GDP [265] Many emergency room visits involve alcohol use [128] Alcohol availability and consumption rates and alcohol rates are positively associated with nuisance, loitering, panhandling, and disorderly conduct in public space [189]\n\n\nCollege\nMany students attending colleges, universities, and other higher education institutions consume alcoholic beverages The laws and social culture around this practice vary by country and institution type, and within an institution, some students may drink heavily whereas others may not drink at all In the United States, drinking tends to be particularly associated with fraternities.\n\n\nPoverty\nAlcohol consumption can contribute to secondary poverty (where people fall back into poverty after escaping it) The Bureau of Labor Statistics found that \"the average American consumer dedicates 1 percent of all their spending to alcohol\" [271]\n\n\nUnsustainable tourism\nSome popular tourist destinations, are cracking down on the impacts of tourism from excessive drinking In an effort to promote a more sustainable tourism industry, these locations are implementing new regulations to curb binge drinking This includes Llucmajor, Palma, Calvia (Magaluf) in Majorca and Sant Antoni in Ibiza, where late-night sales of alcohol will be banned This comes after years of issues with rowdy tourists and the negative impacts it has on local residents [272]\n\n\nSuicide\nMost people are under the influence of sedative-hypnotic drugs (such as alcohol or benzodiazepines) when they die by suicide, [273] with alcoholism present in between 15% and 61% of cases [274] Countries that have higher rates of alcohol use and a greater density of bars generally also have higher rates of suicide [275] About 2.2–3.4% of those who have been treated for alcoholism at some point in their life die by suicide [275] Alcoholics who attempt suicide are usually male, older, and have tried to take their own lives in the past [274] In adolescents who misuse alcohol, neurological and psychological dysfunctions may contribute to the increased risk of suicide [276]\n\n\nInteractions\nA 2023 study suggests a link between alcohol consumption and worse COVID-19 outcomes Researchers analyzed data from over 1.6 million people and found that any level of alcohol consumption increased the risk of severe illness, intensive care unit admission, and needing ventilation compared to non-drinkers Even a history of drinking was associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 These findings suggest that avoiding alcohol altogether might be beneficial during the pandemic [277]\n\n\nDisorders\nA 2023 study suggests a link between alcohol consumption and worse COVID-19 outcomes Researchers analyzed data from over 1.6 million people and found that any level of alcohol consumption increased the risk of severe illness, intensive care unit admission, and needing ventilation compared to non-drinkers Even a history of drinking was associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 These findings suggest that avoiding alcohol altogether might be beneficial during the pandemic [277]\n\n\nCOVID-19\nA 2023 study suggests a link between alcohol consumption and worse COVID-19 outcomes Researchers analyzed data from over 1.6 million people and found that any level of alcohol consumption increased the risk of severe illness, intensive care unit admission, and needing ventilation compared to non-drinkers Even a history of drinking was associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 These findings suggest that avoiding alcohol altogether might be beneficial during the pandemic [277]\n\n\nDiabetes\nSee the insulin section.\n\n\nHepatitis\nAlcohol consumption can be especially dangerous for those with pre-existing liver damage from hepatitis B or C Even relatively low amounts of alcohol can be life-threatening in these cases, [278] so a strict adherence to abstinence is highly recommended [279]\n\n\nHistamine intolerance\nAlcohol may release histamine in individuals with histamine intolerance [280]\n\n\nMental disorders\nMental disorders can be a significant risk factor for alcohol abuse.\n\n\nPeptic ulcer disease\nIn patients who have a peptic ulcer disease (PUD), the mucosal layer is broken down by ethanol PUD is commonly associated with the bacteria Helicobacter pylori, which secretes a toxin that weakens the mucosal wall, allowing acid and protein enzymes to penetrate the weakened barrier Because alcohol stimulates the stomach to secrete acid, a person with PUD should avoid drinking alcohol on an empty stomach Drinking alcohol causes more acid release, which further damages the already-weakened stomach wall [287] Complications of this disease could include a burning pain in the abdomen, bloating and in severe cases, the presence of dark black stools indicate internal bleeding [104] A person who drinks alcohol regularly is strongly advised to reduce their intake to prevent PUD aggravation [104]\n\n\nDosage forms\nAlcohol-induced dose dumping (AIDD) is by definition an unintended rapid release of large amounts of a given drug, when administered through a modified-release dosage while co-ingesting ethanol [288] This is considered a pharmaceutical disadvantage due to the high risk of causing drug-induced toxicity by increasing the absorption and serum concentration above the therapeutic window of the drug The best way to prevent this interaction is by avoiding the co-ingestion of both substances or using specific controlled-release formulations that are resistant to AIDD.\n\n\nAlcohol induced dose dumping (AIDD)\nAlcohol-induced dose dumping (AIDD) is by definition an unintended rapid release of large amounts of a given drug, when administered through a modified-release dosage while co-ingesting ethanol [288] This is considered a pharmaceutical disadvantage due to the high risk of causing drug-induced toxicity by increasing the absorption and serum concentration above the therapeutic window of the drug The best way to prevent this interaction is by avoiding the co-ingestion of both substances or using specific controlled-release formulations that are resistant to AIDD.\n\n\nDrugs\nAlcohol can intensify the sedation caused by antipsychotics, and certain antidepressants [289]\n\n\nHypnotics/sedatives\nAlcohol can intensify the sedation caused by hypnotics/sedatives such as barbiturates, benzodiazepines, sedative antihistamines, opioids, nonbenzodiazepines/Z-drugs (such as zolpidem and zopiclone) [289]\n\n\nDisulfiram-like drugs\nDisulfiram inhibits the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, which in turn results in buildup of acetaldehyde, a toxic metabolite of ethanol with unpleasant effects The medication or drug is commonly used to treat alcohol use disorder, and results in immediate hangover-like symptoms upon consumption of alcohol, this effect is widely known as disulfiram effect.\n\n\nDisulfiram\nDisulfiram inhibits the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, which in turn results in buildup of acetaldehyde, a toxic metabolite of ethanol with unpleasant effects The medication or drug is commonly used to treat alcohol use disorder, and results in immediate hangover-like symptoms upon consumption of alcohol, this effect is widely known as disulfiram effect.\n\n\nMetronidazole\nMetronidazole is an antibacterial agent that kills bacteria by damaging cellular DNA and hence cellular function [292] Metronidazole is usually given to people who have diarrhea caused by Clostridioides difficile bacteria Patients who are taking metronidazole are sometimes advised to avoid alcohol, even after 1 hour following the last dose Although older data suggested a possible disulfiram-like effect of metronidazole, newer data has challenged this and suggests it does not actually have this effect.\n\n\nInsulin\nAlcohol consumption can cause hypoglycemia in diabetics on certain medications, such as insulin or sulfonylurea, by blocking gluconeogenesis [293]\n\n\nNSAIDs\nThe concomitant use of NSAIDs with alcohol and/or tobacco products significantly increases the already elevated risk of peptic ulcers during NSAID therapy [294] [better source needed]\n\n\nStimulants\nControlled animal and human studies showed that caffeine (energy drinks) in combination with alcohol increased the craving for more alcohol more strongly than alcohol alone [297] These findings correspond to epidemiological data that people who consume energy drinks generally showed an increased tendency to take alcohol and other substances [298] [299]\n\n\nMethanol and ethylene glycol\nThe rate-limiting steps for the elimination of ethanol are in common with certain other substances As a result, the blood alcohol concentration can be used to modify the rate of metabolism of toxic alcohols, such as methanol and ethylene glycol Methanol itself is not highly toxic, but its metabolites formaldehyde and formic acid are; therefore, to reduce the rate of production and concentration of these harmful metabolites, ethanol can be ingested [305] Ethylene glycol poisoning can be treated in the same way.\n\n\nWarfarin\nExcessive use of alcohol is also known to affect the metabolism of warfarin and can elevate the INR, and thus increase the risk of bleeding [306] The U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) product insert on warfarin states that alcohol should be avoided [307] The Cleveland Clinic suggests that when taking warfarin one should not drink more than \"one beer, 6 oz of wine, or one shot of alcohol per day\" [308]\n\n\nSpecial population\nLevels of liver enzymes in the bloodstream should be frequently checked in daily alcohol drinkers, pregnant women, IV drug users, people over 35, and those who have chronic liver disease, severe kidney dysfunction, peripheral neuropathy, or HIV infection since they are more likely to develop hepatitis from INH [309] [310]\n\n\nIsoniazid\nLevels of liver enzymes in the bloodstream should be frequently checked in daily alcohol drinkers, pregnant women, IV drug users, people over 35, and those who have chronic liver disease, severe kidney dysfunction, peripheral neuropathy, or HIV infection since they are more likely to develop hepatitis from INH [309] [310]\n\n\nPharmacology\nAlcohol works in the brain primarily by increasing the effects of γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), [311] the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain; by facilitating GABA's actions, alcohol suppresses the activity of the CNS [311]\n\n\nSafety\nSymptoms of ethanol overdose may include nausea, vomiting, CNS depression, coma, acute respiratory failure, or death Levels of even less than 0.1% can cause intoxication, with unconsciousness often occurring at 0.3–0.4% [289] Death from ethanol consumption is possible when blood alcohol levels reach 0.4% A blood level of 0.5% or more is commonly fatal The oral median lethal dose (LD50) of ethanol in rats is 5,628 mg/kg Directly translated to human beings, this would mean that if a person who weighs 70 kg (150 lb) drank a 500 mL (17 US fl oz) glass of pure ethanol, they would theoretically have a 50% risk of dying The highest blood alcohol level ever recorded, in which the subject survived, is 1.41% [319]\n\n\nToxicity\nEthanol is classified as a hepatotoxin, [324] neurotoxin, [325] [326] and ototoxin, [157] which has acute toxic effects on the liver, the nervous system, and the ears, respectively However, ethanol's acute effects on these organs are usually reversible This means that even with a single episode of heavy drinking, the body can typically repair itself from the initial damage Methanol laced alcohol on the other hand can cause blindness even in small quantities.\n\n\nChemistry\nEthanol is also known chemically as alcohol, ethyl alcohol, or drinking alcohol It is a simple alcohol with a molecular formula of C2H6O and a molecular weight of 46.0684 g/mol The molecular formula of ethanol may also be written as CH3−CH2−OH or as C2H5−OH The latter can also be thought of as an ethyl group linked to a hydroxyl (alcohol) group and can be abbreviated as EtOH Ethanol is a volatile, flammable, colorless liquid with a slight characteristic odor Aside from its use as a psychoactive and recreational substance, ethanol is also commonly used as an antiseptic and disinfectant, a chemical and medicinal solvent, and a fuel.\n\n\nProduction\nEthanol is produced naturally as a byproduct of the metabolic processes of yeast and hence is present in any yeast habitat, including even endogenously in humans, but it does not cause raised blood alcohol content as seen in the rare medical condition auto-brewery syndrome (ABS) It is manufactured through hydration of ethylene or by brewing via fermentation of sugars with yeast (most commonly Saccharomyces cerevisiae) The sugars are commonly obtained from sources like steeped cereal grains (e.g., barley), grape juice, and sugarcane products (e.g., molasses, sugarcane juice) Ethanol–water mixture which can be further purified via distillation.\n\n\nHome-made alcoholic beverages\nHomebrewing is the brewing of beer   or other alcoholic beverages on a small scale for personal, non-commercial purposes Supplies, such as kits and fermentation tanks, can be purchased locally at specialty stores or online Beer was brewed domestically for thousands of years before its commercial production, although its legality has varied according to local regulation Homebrewing is closely related to the hobby of home distillation, the production of alcoholic spirits for personal consumption; however home distillation is generally more tightly regulated.\n\n\nHomebrewing\nHomebrewing is the brewing of beer   or other alcoholic beverages on a small scale for personal, non-commercial purposes Supplies, such as kits and fermentation tanks, can

Homebrewing is closely related to the hobby of home distillation, the production of alcoholic spirits for personal consumption; however home distillation is generally more tightly regulated.\n\n\nMoonshine\nAlthough methanol is not produced in toxic amounts by fermentation of sugars from grain starches, [327] it is a major occurrence in fruit spirits [328] However, in modern times, reducing methanol with the absorption of a molecular sieve is a practical method for production [329]\n\n\nAnalogues\nEthanol has a variety of analogues, many of which have similar actions and effects In chemistry, \"alcohol\" can encompass other mind-altering alcohols besides the kind we drink Some examples include synthetic drugs like ethchlorvynol and methylpentynol, once used in medicine Also, ethanol is colloquially referred to as \"alcohol\" because it is the most prevalent alcohol in alcoholic beverages But technically all alcoholic beverages contain several types of psychoactive alcohols, that are categorized as primary, secondary, or tertiary Primary, and secondary alcohols, are oxidized to aldehydes, and ketones, respectively, while tertiary alcohols are generally resistant to oxidation [330] Ethanol is a primary alcohol that has unpleasant actions in the body, many of which are mediated by its toxic metabolite acetaldehyde [331] Less prevalent alcohols found in alcoholic beverages, are secondary, and tertiary alcohols For example, the tertiary alcohol 2M2B which is up to 50 times more potent than ethanol and found in trace quantities in alcoholic beverages, has been synthesized and used as a designer drug Alcoholic beverages are sometimes laced with toxic alcohols, such as methanol (the simplest alcohol) and isopropyl alcohol [16] A mild, brief exposure to isopropyl alcohol (which is only moderately more toxic than ethanol) is unlikely to cause any serious harm But many methanol poisoning incidents have occurred through history, since methanol is lethal even in small quantities, as little as 10–15 milliliters (2–3 teaspoons) Ethanol is used to treat methanol and ethylene glycol toxicity.\n\n\nSociety and culture\nAlcohol education is the planned provision of information and skills relevant to living in a world where alcohol is commonly misused [332] The World Health Organisations (WHO) Global Status Report on Alcohol and Health, highlights the fact that alcohol will be a larger problem in later years, with estimates suggesting it will be the leading cause of disability and death [333] Informing people on alcohol and harmful drinking should become a priority.\n\n\nEvolving alcohol norms\nAlcohol education is the planned provision of information and skills relevant to living in a world where alcohol is commonly misused [332] The World Health Organisations (WHO) Global Status Report on Alcohol and Health, highlights the fact that alcohol will be a larger problem in later years, with estimates suggesting it

alcohol will be a larger problem in later years, with estimates suggesting it will be the leading cause of disability and death [333] Informing people on alcohol and harmful drinking should become a priority.\n\n\nDenormalization\nIn October 2024, the WHO Regional Office for Europe has launched the \"Redefine alcohol\" campaign to address alcohol-related health risks, as alcohol causes nearly 1 in 11 deaths in the region The campaign aims to raise awareness about alcohol's link to over 200 diseases, including several cancers, and to encourage healthier choices by sharing research and personal stories It also calls for stricter regulation of alcohol to reduce its societal harm This initiative is part of the WHO/EU Evidence into Action Alcohol Project, which seeks to reduce alcohol-related harm across Europe [334]\n\n\nIntermittent sobriety\nIntermittent sobriety refers to planned periods of abstinence from alcohol, often as part of awareness campaigns or personal health initiatives [335] [336]\n\n\nSober curious\nSober curious is a cultural movement and lifestyle of consuming no or limited alcohol that started in the late 2010s [citation needed] It differs from traditional abstinence in that it is not founded on asceticism, religious condemnation of alcohol or previous alcohol abuse, but motivated by a curiosity of a sober lifestyle Markets have reacted by offering a wider selection of non-alcoholic beverages [337]\n\n\nUsage\nThe recommended maximum intake (or safe limits) of alcohol varies from no intake, to daily, weekly, or daily/weekly guidelines provided by health agencies of governments The World Health Organization published a statement in The Lancet Public Health in April 2023 that \"there is no safe amount that does not affect health\" [15]\n\n\nConsumption recommendations\nThe recommended maximum intake (or safe limits) of alcohol varies from no intake, to daily, weekly, or daily/weekly guidelines provided by health agencies of governments The World Health Organization published a statement in The Lancet Public Health in April 2023 that \"there is no safe amount that does not affect health\" [15]\n\n\nDrinking culture\nEthanol is typically consumed as a recreational substance by mouth in the form of alcoholic beverages such as beer, wine, and spirits It is commonly used in social settings due to its capacity to enhance sociability.\n\n\nPsychosocial factors\nResearch has shown that various psychosocial factors can influence alcohol consumption patterns throughout an individual's life.\n\n\nReligion\nThe relationship between religion and alcohol exhibits variations across cultures, geographical areas, and religious denominations Some religions emphasize moderation and responsible use as a means of honoring the divine gift of life, while others impose outright bans on alcohol as a means of honoring the divine gift of life Moreover, within the same religious tradition, there are many adherents that may interpret and practice their faith's teachings on alcohol in diverse ways Hence, a wide range of factors, such as religious affiliation, levels of religiosity, cultural traditions, family influences, and peer networks, collectively influence the dynamics of this relationship.\n\n\nMisconceptions\nWhile the terms \"drug\" and \"medicine\" are sometimes used interchangeably, \"drug\" can have a negative connotation, often associated with illegal substances like cocaine or heroin [355] Criticism of the alcohol industry may note that the industry argues that \"alcohol is not a drug\" [356] [357] However, the term \"Alcohol and Other Drugs\" emphasizes this inclusion by grouping alcohol with other substances that alter mood and behavior.\n\n\nLaw\nAlcohol consumption is fully legal and available in most countries of the world [363] Home made alcoholic beverages with low alcohol content like wine, and beer is also legal in most countries, but distilling moonshine outside of a registered distillery remains illegal in most of them.\n\n\nLegal status\nAlcohol consumption is fully legal and available in most countries of the world [363] Home made alcoholic beverages with low alcohol content like wine, and beer is also legal in most countries, but distilling moonshine outside of a registered distillery remains illegal in most of them.\n\n\nAlcohol packaging warning messages\nAlcohol packaging warning messages (alcohol warning labels, AWLs [369]) are warning messages that appear on the packaging of alcoholic drinks concerning their health effects.\n\n\nMinimum pricing policies\nIn 2018, Scotland became the first country to implement a minimum unit pricing policy for alcohol, setting the price at 50 pence per unit This measure aimed to reduce alcohol-related harm by making cheap, high-strength alcohol less accessible As of September 2024, the minimum price has increased to 65 pence per unit, reflecting efforts to address inflation and continue reducing alcohol-related deaths and hospital admissions [371]\n\n\nCriticism of the alcohol industry\nA 2019 survey conducted by the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) showed that only 45% of Americans were aware of the associated risk of cancer due to alcohol consumption, up from 39% in 2017 [372] The AICR believes that alcohol advertising about the healthy cardiovascular benefits of modest alcohol overshadow messages about the increased cancer risks [372]\n\n\nStandard drink\nA standard drink is a measure of alcohol consumption representing a fixed amount of pure ethanol, used in relation to recommendations about alcohol consumption and its relative risks to health The size of a standard drink varies from 8g to 20g across countries, but 10g alcohol (12.7 millilitres) is used in the World Health Organization (WHO) Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT)'s questionnaire form example, [379] and has been adopted by more countries than any other amount [380]\n\n\nHistory\nThe consumption of alcohol has a long human history Beginning with the Gin Craze, excessive drinking and drunkenness developed into a major problem for public health [381] [382] Prohibition marked a turning point, as alcohol transitioned from widely accepted to strictly controlled, recognized as a dangerous drug After its repeal, societal views softened dramatically Alcohol consumption became normalized, and for many years, the public remained largely unaware of the well-established dangers, including its carcinogenic and teratogenic properties However, a recent shift has brought these risks back to light The WHO's 2023 declaration that no amount of alcohol consumption is entirely safe served as a wake-up call.\n\n\nAncient World\nSince antiquity, prior to the development of modern agents, alcohol was used as a general anaesthetic [383]\n\n\nLate Middle Ages\nAlcohol has been used as an antiseptic as early as 1363 with evidence to support its use becoming available in the late 1800s [citation needed]\n\n\nEarly modern period\nThe popular story dates the etymology of the term Dutch courage to English soldiers fighting in the Anglo-Dutch Wars [386] (1652–1674) and perhaps as early as the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648) One version states that jenever (or Dutch gin) was used by English soldiers for its calming effects before battle, and for its purported warming properties on the body in cold weather Another version has it that English soldiers noted the bravery-inducing effects of jenever on Dutch soldiers [387] [388]\n\n\nModern period\nDuring the early modern period (1500–1800), sailors required significant quantities of fresh water on extended voyages Since desalinating sea water was not practical, fresh water was taken aboard in casks, but quickly developed algae and became slimy Stagnant water was sweetened with beer or wine to make it palatable, which involved more casks and was subject to spoilage As longer voyages became more common, the storage of the sailors' substantial daily ration of water plus beer or wine became a problem Also, the rum ration (also called the tot) was a daily amount of rum given to sailors on Royal Navy ships It started 1866 and was abolished in 1970 after concerns that the intake of strong alcohol would lead to unsteady hands when working machinery.\n\n\nAlcohol as a gateway drug\nAlcohol and nicotine prime the brain for a heightened response to other drugs and are, like marijuana, also typically used before a person progresses to other, more harmful substances.\" [393]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "# Alcohol\n\nAlcohol, also known as ethanol, is a psychoactive substance that is widely consumed for recreational and social purposes. It is a colorless, volatile liquid with a characteristic odor and is typically consumed in the form of beverages such as beer, wine, and spirits. Alcohol has been a part of human culture for thousands of years and has been used for various purposes, including as a medicinal agent, an antiseptic, and as a means of social lubrication.\n\n## Medical\n\nAlcohol has been used as a medical treatment for various conditions, including as a general anesthetic, an antiseptic, and a treatment for certain types of pain. However, excessive consumption of alcohol can lead to a range of negative health effects, including liver damage, increased risk of certain cancers, and impaired cognitive function. The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that no amount of alcohol consumption is entirely safe, and that the health risks associated with drinking are dose-dependent.\n\n## Recreational\n\nAlcohol is widely consumed for recreational purposes, often in social settings. The effects of alcohol can vary depending on the amount consumed, the individual's tolerance, and the presence of other substances. At low doses, alcohol can produce feelings of relaxation and sociability, but at higher doses, it can lead to impaired coordination, slowed reaction times, and increased risk of accidents and injuries.\n\n## Social\n\nAlcohol is often consumed in social settings, and its effects can be amplified by the presence of others. The social aspect of drinking can be a key factor in its appeal, with many people using alcohol as a way to relax and connect with others. However, excessive drinking can also have negative social consequences, including impaired relationships, increased risk of violence, and decreased productivity.\n\n## History\n\nThe consumption of alcohol has a long history, with evidence of its use dating back to ancient civilizations. In ancient Greece and Rome, wine was considered a staple of the diet and was used for both medicinal and recreational purposes. The widespread use of alcohol has continued through the centuries, with various cultures developing their own unique traditions and customs around drinking.\n\n## Effects\n\nThe effects of alcohol can vary depending on the amount consumed, the individual's tolerance, and the presence of other substances. At low doses, alcohol can produce feelings of relaxation and sociability, but at higher doses, it can lead to impaired coordination, slowed reaction times, and increased risk of accidents and injuries. Long-term excessive drinking can lead to a range of negative health effects, including liver damage, increased risk of certain cancers, and impaired cognitive function.\n\n## Risks\n\nExcessive drinking can have significant risks, including impaired cognitive function, increased risk of accidents and injuries, and negative social consequences. Long-term excessive drinking can lead to a range of negative health effects, including liver damage, increased risk of certain cancers, and impaired cognitive function.\n\n## Treatment and support\n\nThose struggling with alcohol use disorder can seek treatment and support through various channels, including counseling, support groups, and medication-assisted therapy. Treatment can range from outpatient counseling to residential rehabilitation programs and can involve a range of modalities, including individual and group therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and medication-assisted therapy.\n\n## Society and culture\n\nAlcohol is deeply ingrained in many cultures, with various societies developing unique traditions and customs around drinking. While some cultures view drinking as a social and recreational activity, others view it as a health risk and a potential gateway to more serious substance use. Understanding the cultural and societal context of drinking can help individuals and communities develop targeted interventions and support.\n\n## Regulation\n\nThe regulation of alcohol varies widely across the world, with different countries imposing their own unique laws and restrictions. Some countries have implemented minimum unit pricing policies, while others have restricted the hours and places where alcohol can be consumed. Understanding the regulation of alcohol can help individuals and communities develop targeted interventions and support.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAlcohol is a complex substance with a long history and a significant impact on society. While it can be consumed in moderation, excessive drinking can have negative health effects and social consequences. Understanding the effects, risks, and regulation of alcohol can help individuals and communities develop targeted interventions and support.\n\n## See also\n\n* Substance use disorder\n* Addiction\n*

traditions and social behaviors that surround the consumption of alcoholic beverages as a recreational drug and social lubricant Although alcoholic beverages and social attitudes toward drinking vary around the world, nearly every civilization has independently discovered the processes of brewing beer, fermenting wine and distilling spirits [23]\n\n\nDrinking styles\nIn today's society, there is a growing awareness of this, reflected in the variety of approaches to alcohol use, each emphasizing responsible choices Sober curious describes a mindset or approach where someone is consciously choosing to reduce or eliminate alcohol consumption, not drinking and driving, being aware of your surroundings, not pressuring others to drink, and being able to quit anytime However, they are not necessarily committed to complete sobriety.\n\n\nBinge drinking\nBinge drinking is a style of drinking that is popular in several countries worldwide, and overlaps somewhat with social drinking since it is often done in groups The degree of intoxication however, varies between and within various cultures that engage in this practice A binge on alcohol can occur over hours, last up to several days, or in the event of extended abuse, even weeks Due to the long term effects of alcohol abuse, binge drinking is considered to be a major public health issue [126]\n\n\nDefinition\nHeavy alcohol use is defined differently by various health organizations The CDC defines \"Current heavier drinker\" as consuming more than 7 drinks per week for women and more than 14 drinks per week for men Additionally, \"Heavy drinking day (also referred to as episodic heavy drinking\" is characterized as having 4 or more drinks on a single occasion for women and 5 or more for men, in the past year [40] The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) provides gender-specific guidelines for heavy drinking According to NIAAA, men who consume five or more US standard drinks in a single day or 15 or more drinks within a week are considered heavy drinkers For women, the threshold is lower, with four or more drinks in a day or eight or more drinks per week classified as heavy drinking In contrast, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) takes a different approach to defining heavy alcohol use SAMHSA considers heavy alcohol use to be engaging in binge drinking behaviors on five or more days within a month This definition focuses more on the frequency of excessive drinking episodes rather than specific drink counts [28]\n\n\nLight, moderate, responsible, and social drinking\nLight drinking, moderate drinking, responsible drinking, and social drinking are often used interchangeably, but with slightly different connotations:\n\n\nHeavy drinking\nA 2007 study at the University of Texas at Austin monitored the drinking habits of 541 students over two football seasons It revealed that high-profile game days ranked among the heaviest drinking occasions, similar to New Year's Eve Male students increased their consumption for all games, while socially active female students drank heavily during away games Lighter drinkers also showed a higher likelihood of risky behaviors during away games as their intoxication increased This research highlights specific drinking patterns linked to collegiate sports events [38]\n\n\nDefinition\nHeavy alcohol use is defined differently by various health organizations The CDC defines \"Current heavier drinker\" as consuming more than 7 drinks per week for women and more than 14 drinks per week for men Additionally, \"Heavy drinking day (also referred to as episodic heavy drinking\" is characterized as having 4 or more drinks on a single occasion for women and 5

counts [28]\n\n\nSelf-medication\nThe therapeutic index for ethanol is 10% [42]\n\n\nUnscientific\nThe American Heart Association warn that \"We've all seen the headlines about studies associating light or moderate drinking with health benefits and reduced mortality Some researchers have suggested there are health benefits from wine, especially red wine, and that a glass a day can be good for the heart But there's more to the story No research has proved a cause-and-effect link between drinking alcohol and better heart health.\" [51]\n\n\nDutch courage\nDutch courage, also known as pot-valiance or liquid courage, refers to courage gained from intoxication with alcohol.\n\n\nCriminal\nAlbeit not a valid intoxication defense, weakening the inhibitions by drunkenness is occasionally used as a tool to commit planned offenses such as property crimes including theft and robbery, and violent crimes including assault, murder, or rape – which sometimes but not always occurs in alcohol-facilitated sexual assaults where the victim is also drugged.\n\n\nWarfare\nAlcohol has a long association of military use, and has been called \"liquid courage\" for its role in preparing troops for battle, anaesthetize injured soldiers, and celebrate military victories It has also served as a coping mechanism for combat stress reactions and a means of decompression from combat to everyday life However, this reliance on alcohol can have negative consequences for physical and mental health [67] Military and veteran populations face significant challenges in addressing the co-occurrence of PTSD and alcohol use disorder [68] Military personnel who show symptoms of PTSD, major depressive disorder, alcohol use disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder show higher levels of suicidal ideation [69]\n\n\nFood energy\nThe use of alcohol as a staple food source is considered inconvenient due to the fact that it increases the blood alcohol content (BAC) However, alcohol is a significant source of food energy for individuals with alcoholism and those who engage in binge drinking; For example, individuals with drunkorexia, engage in the combination of self-imposed malnutrition and binge drinking to avoid weight gain from alcohol, to save money for purchasing alcohol, [74] and to facilitate alcohol intoxication [75] Also, in alcoholics who get most of their daily calories from alcohol, a deficiency of thiamine can produce Korsakoff's syndrome, which is associated with serious brain damage [76]\n\n\nSpiritual\nSpiritual use of moderate alcohol consumption is found in some religions and schools with esoteric influences, including the Hindu tantra sect Aghori, in the Sufi Bektashi Order and Alevi Jem ceremonies, [80] in the Rarámuri religion, in the Japanese religion Shinto, [81] by the new religious movement Thelema, in Vajrayana Buddhism, and in Vodou faith of Haiti.\n\n\nContraindication\nIn the US, alcohol is subject to the FDA drug labeling Pregnancy Category X (Contraindicated in pregnancy).\n\n\nPregnancy\nIn the US, alcohol is subject to the FDA drug labeling Pregnancy Category X (Contraindicated in pregnancy).\n\n\nRisks\nEthanol is classified as a teratogen [83] [84] [medical citation needed]—a substance known to cause birth defects; according to the U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), alcohol consumption by women who are not using birth control increases the risk of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) This group of conditions encompasses fetal alcohol syndrome, partial fetal alcohol syndrome, alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, static encephalopathy, and alcohol-related birth defects [85] The CDC currently recommends complete abstinence from alcoholic beverages for women of child-bearing age who are pregnant, trying to become pregnant, or are sexually active and not using birth control [86]\n\n\nFetal alcohol spectrum disorder\nEthanol is classified as a teratogen [83] [84] [medical citation needed]—a substance known to cause birth defects; according to the U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), alcohol consumption by women who are not using birth control increases the risk of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) This group of conditions encompasses fetal alcohol syndrome, partial fetal

for women of child-bearing age who are pregnant, trying to become pregnant, or are sexually active and not using birth control [86]\n\n\nMiscarriage\nMiscarriage, also known in medical terms as a spontaneous abortion, is the death and expulsion of an embryo or fetus before it can survive independently.\n\n\nSudden infant death syndrome\nDrinking of alcohol by parents is linked to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) [89] One study found a positive correlation between the two during New Years celebrations and weekends [90] Another found that alcohol use disorder was linked to a more than doubling of risk [91]\n\n\nAdverse effects\nAlcohol has a variety of short-term and long-term adverse effects Alcohol has both short-term, and long-term effects on the memory, and sleep It also has reinforcement-related adverse effects, including alcoholism, dependence, and withdrawal; The most severe withdrawal symptoms, associated with physical dependence, can include seizures and delirium tremens, which in rare cases can be fatal Alcohol use is directly related to considerable morbidity and mortality, for instance due to intoxication and alcohol-related health problems [92] The World Health Organization advises that there is no safe level of alcohol consumption [93]\n\n\nShort-term effects\nThe amount of ethanol in the body is typically quantified by blood alcohol content (BAC); weight of ethanol per unit volume of blood Small doses of ethanol, in general, are stimulant-like [103] and produce euphoria and relaxation; people experiencing these symptoms tend to become talkative and less inhibited, and may exhibit poor judgement At higher dosages (BAC > 1 gram/liter), ethanol acts as a central nervous system (CNS) depressant, [103] producing at progressively higher dosages, impaired sensory and motor function, slowed cognition, stupefaction, unconsciousness, and possible death Ethanol is commonly consumed as a recreational substance, especially while socializing, due to its psychoactive effects.\n\n\nCentral nervous system impairment\nAlcohol causes generalized CNS depression, is a positive allosteric GABAA modulator and is associated and related with decreased anxiety, decreased social inhibition, sedation, impairment of cognitive, memory, and sensory function, cognitive, memory, motor, and sensory impairment It slows and impairs cognition and reaction time and the cognitive skills, impairs judgement, interferes with motor function resulting in motor incoordination, numbness, impairs memory formation, and causes sensory impairment.\n\n\nGastrointestinal effects\nAlcohol can cause nausea and vomiting in sufficiently high amounts (varying by person).\n\n\nHangover\nA hangover is the experience of various unpleasant physiological and psychological effects usually following the consumption of alcohol, such as wine, beer, and liquor Hangovers can last for several hours or for more than 24 hours Typical symptoms of a hangover may include headache, drowsiness, concentration problems, dry mouth, dizziness, fatigue, gastrointestinal distress (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), absence of hunger, light sensitivity, depression, sweating, hyper-excitability, irritability, and anxiety (often referred to as \"hangxiety\") [106] [107]\n\n\nHoliday heart syndrome\nHoliday heart syndrome, also known as alcohol-induced atrial arrhythmias, is a syndrome defined by an irregular heartbeat and palpitations [111] associated with high levels of ethanol consumption [112] [113] Holiday heart syndrome was discovered in 1978 when Philip Ettinger discovered the connection between arrhythmia and alcohol consumption [114] It received its common name as it is associated with the binge drinking common during the holidays [115] It is unclear how common this syndrome is 5-10% of cases of atrial fibrillation may be related to this condition, but it could be as high 63% [116]\n\n\nPositional alcohol nystagmus\nPositional alcohol nystagmus (PAN) is nystagmus (visible jerkiness in eye movement) produced when the head is placed in a sideways position PAN occurs when the specific gravity of the membrane space of the semicircular canals in the ear differs from the specific gravity of the fluid in the canals because of the presence of alcohol [117]\n\n\nAllergic-like reactions\nEthanol-containing beverages can cause alcohol flush reactions, exacerbations of rhinitis and, more seriously and commonly, bronchoconstriction in patients with a history of asthma, and in some cases, urticarial skin eruptions, and systemic dermatitis Such reactions can occur within 1–60 minutes of ethanol ingestion, and may be caused by: [120]\n\n\nLong-term effects\nAccording to The Lancet, 'four industries (tobacco, unhealthy food, fossil fuel, and alcohol) are responsible for at least a third of global deaths per year' [123] In 2024, the World Health Organization published a report including these figures [124] [125]\n\n\nAlcoholism\nAlcoholism or its medical diagnosis alcohol use disorder refers to alcohol addiction, alcohol dependence, dipsomania, and/or alcohol abuse It is a major problem and many health problems as well as death can result from excessive alcohol use [128] [92] Alcohol dependence is linked to a lifespan that is reduced by about 12 years relative to the average person [128] In 2004, it was estimated that 4% of deaths worldwide were attributable to alcohol use [92] Deaths from alcohol are split about evenly between acute causes (e.g., overdose, accidents) and chronic conditions [92] The leading chronic alcohol-related condition associated with death is alcoholic liver disease [92] Alcohol dependence is also associated with cognitive impairment and organic brain damage [128] Some researchers have found that even one alcoholic drink a day increases an individual's risk of health problems by 0.4% [129]\n\n\nBrain damage\nWhile many people associate alcohol's effects with intoxication, the long-term impact of alcohol on the brain can be severe Binge drinking, or heavy episodic drinking, can lead to alcohol-related brain damage that occurs after a relatively short period of time This brain damage increases the risk of alcohol-related dementia, and abnormalities in mood and cognitive abilities.\n\n\nDementia\nAlcohol-related dementia (ARD) is a form of dementia caused by long-term, excessive consumption of alcohol, resulting in neurological damage and impaired cognitive function [141]\n\n\nMarchiafava–Bignami disease\nMarchiafava–Bignami disease is a progressive neurological disease of alcohol use disorder, characterized by corpus callosum demyelination and necrosis and subsequent atrophy The disease was first described in 1903 by the Italian pathologists Amico Bignami and Ettore Marchiafava in an Italian Chianti drinker [142] [143]\n\n\nLiver damage\nConsuming more than 30 grams of pure alcohol per day over an extended period can significantly increase the risk of developing alcoholic liver disease [145] During the metabolism of alcohol via the respective dehydrogenases, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is converted into reduced NAD Normally, NAD is used to metabolize fats in the liver, and as such alcohol competes with these fats for the use of NAD Prolonged exposure to alcohol means that fats accumulate in the liver, leading to the term 'fatty liver' Continued consumption (such as in alcohol use disorder) then leads to cell death in the hepatocytes as the fat stores reduce the function of the cell to the point of death These cells are then replaced with scar tissue, leading to the condition called cirrhosis.\n\n\nCancer\nAlcoholic beverages have been classified as carcinogenic by leading health organizations for more than two decades, including the WHO's IARC (Group 1 carcinogens) [19] and the U.S NTP, [146] raising concerns about the potential cancer risk associated with alcohol consumption.\n\n\nCardiovascular disease\nExcessive daily alcohol consumption and binge drinking can cause a higher risk of stroke, coronary artery disease, heart failure, fatal hypertensive disease, and fatal aortic aneurysm [151]\n\n\nCardiomyopathy\nAlcoholic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is a disease in which the long-term consumption of alcohol leads to heart failure [156] ACM is a type of dilated cardiomyopathy The heart is unable to pump blood efficiently, leading to heart failure It can affect other parts of the body if the heart failure is severe It is most common in males between the ages of 35 and 50.\n\n\nHearing loss\nAlcohol, classified as an ototoxin (ear toxin), [157] can contribute to hearing loss sometimes referred to as \"cocktail deafness\" after exposure to loud noises in drinking environments [158] [159]\n\n\nWithdrawal syndrome\nDiscontinuation of alcohol after extended heavy use and associated tolerance development (resulting in dependence) can result in withdrawal Alcohol withdrawal can cause confusion, paranoia, anxiety, insomnia, agitation, tremors, fever, nausea, vomiting, autonomic dysfunction, seizures, and hallucinations In severe cases, death can result.\n\n\nCortisol\nResearch has looked into the effects of alcohol on the amount of cortisol that is produced in the human body Continuous consumption of alcohol over an extended period of time has been shown to raise cortisol levels in the body Cortisol is released during periods of high stress, and can result in the temporary shut down of other physical processes, causing physical damage to the body.\n\n\nGout\nThere is a strong association between gout the consumption of alcohol, and sugar-sweetened beverages, [165] with wine presenting somewhat less of a risk than beer or spirits [166] [167]\n\n\nKetoacidosis\nAlcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA) is a specific group of symptoms and metabolic state related to alcohol use [168] Symptoms often include abdominal pain, vomiting, agitation, a fast respiratory rate, and a specific \"fruity\" smell [169] Consciousness is generally normal [170] Complications may include sudden death [170]\n\n\nMental disorders\nMental disorders can be a significant risk factor for alcohol abuse.\n\n\nAustrian syndrome\nAustrian syndrome, also known as Osler's triad, is a medical condition that was named after Robert Austrian in 1957 The presentation of the condition consists of pneumonia, endocarditis, and meningitis, all caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae It is associated with alcoholism due to hyposplenism (reduced splenic functioning) and can be seen in males between the ages of 40 and 60 years old [174] Robert Austrian was not the first one to describe the condition, but Richard Heschl (around 1860s) or William Osler were not able to link the signs to the bacteria because microbiology was not yet developed.\n\n\nPolyneuropathy\nAlcoholic polyneuropathy is a neurological disorder in which peripheral nerves throughout the body malfunction simultaneously It is defined by axonal degeneration in neurons of both the sensory and motor systems and initially occurs at the distal ends of the longest axons in the body This nerve damage causes an individual to experience pain and motor weakness, first in the feet and hands and then progressing centrally Alcoholic polyneuropathy is caused primarily by chronic alcoholism; however, vitamin deficiencies are also known to contribute to its development.\n\n\nSpecific population\nBabies exposed to alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and some antidepressants (SSRIs) during pregnancy may experience neonatal withdrawal [175]\n\n\nPregnant women\nBabies exposed to alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and some antidepressants (SSRIs) during pregnancy may experience neonatal withdrawal [175]\n\n\nOther effects\nAlcohol consumption is associated with lower sperm concentration, percentage of normal morphology, and semen volume, but not sperm motility [178]\n\n\nSocial issues\nAlcohol use is stereotypically associated with crime, [189] both violent and non-violent [128] Some crimes are uniquely tied to alcohol, such as public intoxication or underage drinking, while others are simply more likely to occur together with alcohol consumption Crime perpetrators are much more likely to be intoxicated than crime victims Many alcohol laws have been passed to criminalize various alcohol-related activities [189] [190] Underage drinking and drunk driving are the most prevalent alcohol-specific offenses in the United States [189] and a major problem in many countries worldwide [191] [192] [193] About one-third of arrests in the United States involve alcohol misuse, [128] and arrests for alcohol-related crimes constitute a high proportion of all arrests made by police in the U.S and elsewhere [194] In general, programs aimed at reducing society's consumption of alcohol, including education in schools, are seen as an effective long-term solution Strategies aiming to reduce alcohol consumption among adult offenders have various estimates of effectiveness [195] Policing alcohol-related street disorder and enforcing compliance checks of alcohol-dispensing businesses has proven successful in reducing public perception of and fear of criminal activities [189]\n\n\nAlcohol-related crimes\nAlcohol use is stereotypically associated with crime, [189] both violent and non-violent [128] Some crimes are uniquely tied to alcohol, such as public intoxication or underage drinking, while others are simply more likely to occur together with alcohol consumption Crime perpetrators are much more likely to be intoxicated than crime victims Many alcohol laws have been passed to criminalize various alcohol-related activities [189] [190] Underage drinking and drunk driving are the most prevalent alcohol-specific offenses in the United States [189] and a major problem in many countries worldwide [191] [192] [193] About one-third of arrests in the United States involve alcohol misuse, [128] and arrests for alcohol-related crimes constitute a high proportion of all arrests made by police in the U.S and elsewhere [194] In general, programs aimed at reducing society's consumption of alcohol, including education in schools, are seen as an effective long-term solution Strategies aiming to reduce alcohol consumption among adult offenders have various estimates of effectiveness [195] Policing alcohol-related street disorder and enforcing compliance checks of alcohol-dispensing businesses has proven successful in reducing public perception of and fear of criminal activities [189]\n\n\nPublic-order crimes\nPublic-order crimes caused by drinking include drunk driving, domestic violence, and alcohol-related sexual assaults.\n\n\nAutomobile accidents\nA 2002 study found 41% of people fatally injured in traffic accidents were in alcohol-related crashes [200] Misuse of alcohol is associated with more than 40% of deaths that occur in automobile accidents every year [128] The risk of a fatal car accident increases exponentially with the level of alcohol in the driver's blood [201]\n\n\nNegligence\nNegligence in alcohol consumption can have a ripple effect on environmentally responsible behavior Examples:\n\n\nPublic drunkenness\nPublic drunkenness or intoxication is a common problem in many jurisdictions Public intoxication laws vary widely by jurisdiction, but include public nuisance laws, open-container laws, and prohibitions on drinking alcohol in public or certain areas The offenders are often lower class individuals and this crime has a very high recidivism rate, with numerous instances of repeated instances of the arrest, jail, release without treatment cycle The high number of arrests for public drunkenness often reflects rearrests of the same offenders [194]\n\n\nSexual assaults\nRape is any sexual activity that occurs without the freely given consent of one of the parties involved This includes alcohol-facilitated sexual assault which is considered rape in most if not all jurisdictions, [207] or non-consensual condom removal which is criminalized in some countries (see the map below).\n\n\nAlcohol-facilitated sexual assault\nOne of the most common date rape drugs is alcohol, [211] [212] [213] administered either surreptitiously [214] or consumed voluntarily, [211] rendering the victim unable to make informed decisions or give consent The perpetrator then facilitates sexual assault or rape, a crime known as alcohol- or drug-facilitated sexual assault (DFSA) [215] [207] [216] However, sex with an unconscious victim is considered rape in most if not all jurisdictions, and some assailants have committed \"rapes of convenience\" whereby they have assaulted a victim after he or she had become unconscious from drinking too much [217] The risk of individuals either experiencing or perpetrating sexual violence and risky sexual behavior increases with alcohol abuse, [218] and by the consumption of caffeinated alcoholic drinks [219] [220]\n\n\nNon-consensual condom removal\nNon-consensual condom removal, or \"stealthing\", [221] is the practice of a person removing a condom during sexual intercourse without consent, when their sex partner has only consented to condom-protected sex [222] [223] Purposefully damaging a condom before or during intercourse may also be referred to as stealthing, [224] regardless of who damaged the condom.\n\n\nWartime sexual violence\nThe use of alcohol is a documented factor in wartime sexual violence.\n\n\nViolent crime\nThe World Health Organization has noted that out of social problems created by the harmful use of alcohol, \"crime and violence related to alcohol consumption\" are likely the most significant issue [198] In the United States, 15% of robberies, 63% of intimate partner violence incidents, 37% of sexual assaults, 45–46% of physical assaults and 40–45% of homicides (murders) involved use of alcohol [230] [196] A 1983 study for the United States found that 54% of violent crime perpetrators, arrested in that country, had been consuming alcohol before their offenses [194] In 2002, it was estimated that 1 million violent crimes in the U.S were related to alcohol use [128] More than 43% of violent encounters with police involve alcohol [128] Alcohol is implicated in more than two-thirds of cases of intimate partner violence [128] Studies also suggest there may be links between alcohol abuse and child abuse [189] In the United Kingdom, in 2015/2016, 39% of those involved in violent crimes were under alcohol influence [231] A significant portion, 40%, of homicide victims tested positive for alcohol in the US [232] International studies are similar, with an estimate that 63% of violent crimes worldwide involves the use of alcohol [196]\n\n\nMethanol laced alcohol\nOutbreaks of methanol poisoning have occurred when methanol is used to lace moonshine (bootleg liquor) [234] This is commonly done to bulk up the original product to gain profit Because of its similarities in both appearance and odor to ethanol (the alcohol in beverages), it is difficult to differentiate between the two.\n\n\nAlternative routes of administration\nAlternative methods of alcohol administration like alcohol enema, alcohol inhalation, vodka eyeballing, or using alcohol powder (which can be added to water to make an alcoholic beverage, or inhaled with a nebulizer), all carry significant health risks.\n\n\nBinge drinking\nBinge drinking is a style of drinking that is popular in several countries worldwide, and overlaps somewhat with social drinking since it is often done in groups The degree of intoxication however, varies between and within various cultures that engage in this practice A binge on alcohol can occur over hours, last up to several days, or in the event of extended abuse, even weeks Due to the long term effects of alcohol abuse, binge drinking is considered to be a major public health issue [126]\n\n\nEmotional issues\nIn emotional self-regulation, some people turn to drugs such as alcohol Drug use, an example of response modulation, can be used to alter emotion-associated physiological responses For example, alcohol can produce sedative and anxiolytic effects [243] A 2013 study found that immature defense mechanisms are linked to placing a higher value on junk food, alcohol, and television [244]\n\n\nHurtful communication\nAlcohol may cause hurtful communication.\n\n\nDrunk dialing\nDrunk dialing refers to an intoxicated person making phone calls that they would not likely make if sober, often a lonely individual calling former or current love interests.\n\n\nIn vino veritas\nIn vino veritas is a Latin phrase that means 'in wine, there is truth', suggesting a person under the influence of alcohol is more likely to speak their hidden thoughts and desires.\n\n\nRisky sexual behavior\nSome studies have made a connection between hookup culture and substance use [249] Most students said that their hookups occurred after drinking alcohol [249] [250] [251] Frietas stated that in her study, the relationships between drinking and the party scene and between alcohol and hookup culture were \"impossible to miss\" [252]: 41 \n\n\nSexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancy\nAlcohol intoxication is associated with an increased risk that people will become involved in risky sexual behaviors, such as unprotected sex [255] Both men, [256] and women, [257] reported higher intentions to avoid using a condom when they were intoxicated by alcohol.\n\n\nSocietal damage\nAlcohol causes a plethora of detrimental effects in society [128] A 2023 systematic review estimated the societal costs of alcohol use to be around 2.6% of the GDP [265] Many emergency room visits involve alcohol use [128] Alcohol availability and consumption rates and alcohol rates are positively associated with nuisance, loitering, panhandling, and disorderly conduct in public space [189]\n\n\nCollege\nMany students attending colleges, universities, and other higher education institutions consume alcoholic beverages The laws and social culture around this practice vary by country and institution type, and within an institution, some students may drink heavily whereas others may not drink at all In the United States, drinking tends to be particularly associated with fraternities.\n\n\nPoverty\nAlcohol consumption can contribute to secondary poverty (where people fall back into poverty after escaping it) The Bureau of Labor Statistics found that \"the average American consumer dedicates 1 percent of all their spending to alcohol\" [271]\n\n\nUnsustainable tourism\nSome popular tourist destinations, are cracking down on the impacts of tourism from excessive drinking In an effort to promote a more sustainable tourism industry, these locations are implementing new regulations to curb binge drinking This includes Llucmajor, Palma, Calvia (Magaluf) in Majorca and Sant Antoni in Ibiza, where late-night sales of alcohol will be banned This comes after years of issues with rowdy tourists and the negative impacts it has on local residents [272]\n\n\nSuicide\nMost people are under the influence of sedative-hypnotic drugs (such as alcohol or benzodiazepines) when they die by suicide, [273] with alcoholism present in between 15% and 61% of cases [274] Countries that have higher rates of alcohol use and a greater density of bars generally also have higher rates of suicide [275] About 2.2–3.4% of those who have been treated for alcoholism at some point in their life die by suicide [275] Alcoholics who attempt suicide are usually male, older, and have tried to take their own lives in the past [274] In adolescents who misuse alcohol, neurological and psychological dysfunctions may contribute to the increased risk of suicide [276]\n\n\nInteractions\nA 2023 study suggests a link between alcohol consumption and worse COVID-19 outcomes Researchers analyzed data from over 1.6 million people and found that any level of alcohol consumption increased the risk of severe illness, intensive care unit admission, and needing ventilation compared to non-drinkers Even a history of drinking was associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 These findings suggest that avoiding alcohol altogether might be beneficial during the pandemic [277]\n\n\nDisorders\nA 2023 study suggests a link between alcohol consumption and worse COVID-19 outcomes Researchers analyzed data from over 1.6 million people and found that any level of alcohol consumption increased the risk of severe illness, intensive care unit admission, and needing ventilation compared to non-drinkers Even a history of drinking was associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 These findings suggest that avoiding alcohol altogether might be beneficial during the pandemic [277]\n\n\nCOVID-19\nA 2023 study suggests a link between alcohol consumption and worse COVID-19 outcomes Researchers analyzed data from over 1.6 million people and found that any level of alcohol consumption increased the risk of severe illness, intensive care unit admission, and needing ventilation compared to non-drinkers Even a history of drinking was associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 These findings suggest that avoiding alcohol altogether might be beneficial during the pandemic [277]\n\n\nDiabetes\nSee the insulin section.\n\n\nHepatitis\nAlcohol consumption can be especially dangerous for those with pre-existing liver damage from hepatitis B or C Even relatively low amounts of alcohol can be life-threatening in these cases, [278] so a strict adherence to abstinence is highly recommended [279]\n\n\nHistamine intolerance\nAlcohol may release histamine in individuals with histamine intolerance [280]\n\n\nMental disorders\nMental disorders can be a significant risk factor for alcohol abuse.\n\n\nPeptic ulcer disease\nIn patients who have a peptic ulcer disease (PUD), the mucosal layer is broken down by ethanol PUD is commonly associated with the bacteria Helicobacter pylori, which secretes a toxin that weakens the mucosal wall, allowing acid and protein enzymes to penetrate the weakened barrier Because alcohol stimulates the stomach to secrete acid, a person with PUD should avoid drinking alcohol on an empty stomach Drinking alcohol causes more acid release, which further damages the already-weakened stomach wall [287] Complications of this disease could include a burning pain in the abdomen, bloating and in severe cases, the presence of dark black stools indicate internal bleeding [104] A person who drinks alcohol regularly is strongly advised to reduce their intake to prevent PUD aggravation [104]\n\n\nDosage forms\nAlcohol-induced dose dumping (AIDD) is by definition an unintended rapid release of large amounts of a given drug, when administered through a modified-release dosage while co-ingesting ethanol [288] This is considered a pharmaceutical disadvantage due to the high risk of causing drug-induced toxicity by increasing the absorption and serum concentration above the therapeutic window of the drug The best way to prevent this interaction is by avoiding the co-ingestion of both substances or using specific controlled-release formulations that are resistant to AIDD.\n\n\nAlcohol induced dose dumping (AIDD)\nAlcohol-induced dose dumping (AIDD) is by definition an unintended rapid release of large amounts of a given drug, when administered through a modified-release dosage while co-ingesting ethanol [288] This is considered a pharmaceutical disadvantage due to the high risk of causing drug-induced toxicity by increasing the absorption and serum concentration above the therapeutic window of the drug The best way to prevent this interaction is by avoiding the co-ingestion of both substances or using specific controlled-release formulations that are resistant to AIDD.\n\n\nDrugs\nAlcohol can intensify the sedation caused by antipsychotics, and certain antidepressants [289]\n\n\nHypnotics/sedatives\nAlcohol can intensify the sedation caused by hypnotics/sedatives such as barbiturates, benzodiazepines, sedative antihistamines, opioids, nonbenzodiazepines/Z-drugs (such as zolpidem and zopiclone) [289]\n\n\nDisulfiram-like drugs\nDisulfiram inhibits the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, which in turn results in buildup of acetaldehyde, a toxic metabolite of ethanol with unpleasant effects The medication or drug is commonly used to treat alcohol use disorder, and results in immediate hangover-like symptoms upon consumption of alcohol, this effect is widely known as disulfiram effect.\n\n\nDisulfiram\nDisulfiram inhibits the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, which in turn results in buildup of acetaldehyde, a toxic metabolite of ethanol with unpleasant effects The medication or drug is commonly used to treat alcohol use disorder, and results in immediate hangover-like symptoms upon consumption of alcohol, this effect is widely known as disulfiram effect.\n\n\nMetronidazole\nMetronidazole is an antibacterial agent that kills bacteria by damaging cellular DNA and hence cellular function [292] Metronidazole is usually given to people who have diarrhea caused by Clostridioides difficile bacteria Patients who are taking metronidazole are sometimes advised to avoid alcohol, even after 1 hour following the last dose Although older data suggested a possible disulfiram-like effect of metronidazole, newer data has challenged this and suggests it does not actually have this effect.\n\n\nInsulin\nAlcohol consumption can cause hypoglycemia in diabetics on certain medications, such as insulin or sulfonylurea, by blocking gluconeogenesis [293]\n\n\nNSAIDs\nThe concomitant use of NSAIDs with alcohol and/or tobacco products significantly increases the already elevated risk of peptic ulcers during NSAID therapy [294] [better source needed]\n\n\nStimulants\nControlled animal and human studies showed that caffeine (energy drinks) in combination with alcohol increased the craving for more alcohol more strongly than alcohol alone [297] These findings correspond to epidemiological data that people who consume energy drinks generally showed an increased tendency to take alcohol and other substances [298] [299]\n\n\nMethanol and ethylene glycol\nThe rate-limiting steps for the elimination of ethanol are in common with certain other substances As a result, the blood alcohol concentration can be used to modify the rate of metabolism of toxic alcohols, such as methanol and ethylene glycol Methanol itself is not highly toxic, but its metabolites formaldehyde and formic acid are; therefore, to reduce the rate of production and concentration of these harmful metabolites, ethanol can be ingested [305] Ethylene glycol poisoning can be treated in the same way.\n\n\nWarfarin\nExcessive use of alcohol is also known to affect the metabolism of warfarin and can elevate the INR, and thus increase the risk of bleeding [306] The U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) product insert on warfarin states that alcohol should be avoided [307] The Cleveland Clinic suggests that when taking warfarin one should not drink more than \"one beer, 6 oz of wine, or one shot of alcohol per day\" [308]\n\n\nSpecial population\nLevels of liver enzymes in the bloodstream should be frequently checked in daily alcohol drinkers, pregnant women, IV drug users, people over 35, and those who have chronic liver disease, severe kidney dysfunction, peripheral neuropathy, or HIV infection since they are more likely to develop hepatitis from INH [309] [310]\n\n\nIsoniazid\nLevels of liver enzymes in the bloodstream should be frequently checked in daily alcohol drinkers, pregnant women, IV drug users, people over 35, and those who have chronic liver disease, severe kidney dysfunction, peripheral neuropathy, or HIV infection since they are more likely to develop hepatitis from INH [309] [310]\n\n\nPharmacology\nAlcohol works in the brain primarily by increasing the effects of γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), [311] the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain; by facilitating GABA's actions, alcohol suppresses the activity of the CNS [311]\n\n\nSafety\nSymptoms of ethanol overdose may include nausea, vomiting, CNS depression, coma, acute respiratory failure, or death Levels of even less than 0.1% can cause intoxication, with unconsciousness often occurring at 0.3–0.4% [289] Death from ethanol consumption is possible when blood alcohol levels reach 0.4% A blood level of 0.5% or more is commonly fatal The oral median lethal dose (LD50) of ethanol in rats is 5,628 mg/kg Directly translated to human beings, this would mean that if a person who weighs 70 kg (150 lb) drank a 500 mL (17 US fl oz) glass of pure ethanol, they would theoretically have a 50% risk of dying The highest blood alcohol level ever recorded, in which the subject survived, is 1.41% [319]\n\n\nToxicity\nEthanol is classified as a hepatotoxin, [324] neurotoxin, [325] [326] and ototoxin, [157] which has acute toxic effects on the liver, the nervous system, and the ears, respectively However, ethanol's acute effects on these organs are usually reversible This means that even with a single episode of heavy drinking, the body can typically repair itself from the initial damage Methanol laced alcohol on the other hand can cause blindness even in small quantities.\n\n\nChemistry\nEthanol is also known chemically as alcohol, ethyl alcohol, or drinking alcohol It is a simple alcohol with a molecular formula of C2H6O and a molecular weight of 46.0684 g/mol The molecular formula of ethanol may also be written as CH3−CH2−OH or as C2H5−OH The latter can also be thought of as an ethyl group linked to a hydroxyl (alcohol) group and can be abbreviated as EtOH Ethanol is a volatile, flammable, colorless liquid with a slight characteristic odor Aside from its use as a psychoactive and recreational substance, ethanol is also commonly used as an antiseptic and disinfectant, a chemical and medicinal solvent, and a fuel.\n\n\nProduction\nEthanol is produced naturally as a byproduct of the metabolic processes of yeast and hence is present in any yeast habitat, including even endogenously in humans, but it does not cause raised blood alcohol content as seen in the rare medical condition auto-brewery syndrome (ABS) It is manufactured through hydration of ethylene or by brewing via fermentation of sugars with yeast (most commonly Saccharomyces cerevisiae) The sugars are commonly obtained from sources like steeped cereal grains (e.g., barley), grape juice, and sugarcane products (e.g., molasses, sugarcane juice) Ethanol–water mixture which can be further purified via distillation.\n\n\nHome-made alcoholic beverages\nHomebrewing is the brewing of beer   or other alcoholic beverages on a small scale for personal, non-commercial purposes Supplies, such as kits and fermentation tanks, can be purchased locally at specialty stores or online Beer was brewed domestically for thousands of years before its commercial production, although its legality has varied according to local regulation Homebrewing is closely related to the hobby of home distillation, the production of alcoholic spirits for personal consumption; however home distillation is generally more tightly regulated.\n\n\nHomebrewing\nHomebrewing is the brewing of beer   or other alcoholic beverages on a small scale for personal, non-commercial purposes Supplies, such as kits and fermentation tanks, can

Homebrewing is closely related to the hobby of home distillation, the production of alcoholic spirits for personal consumption; however home distillation is generally more tightly regulated.\n\n\nMoonshine\nAlthough methanol is not produced in toxic amounts by fermentation of sugars from grain starches, [327] it is a major occurrence in fruit spirits [328] However, in modern times, reducing methanol with the absorption of a molecular sieve is a practical method for production [329]\n\n\nAnalogues\nEthanol has a variety of analogues, many of which have similar actions and effects In chemistry, \"alcohol\" can encompass other mind-altering alcohols besides the kind we drink Some examples include synthetic drugs like ethchlorvynol and methylpentynol, once used in medicine Also, ethanol is colloquially referred to as \"alcohol\" because it is the most prevalent alcohol in alcoholic beverages But technically all alcoholic beverages contain several types of psychoactive alcohols, that are categorized as primary, secondary, or tertiary Primary, and secondary alcohols, are oxidized to aldehydes, and ketones, respectively, while tertiary alcohols are generally resistant to oxidation [330] Ethanol is a primary alcohol that has unpleasant actions in the body, many of which are mediated by its toxic metabolite acetaldehyde [331] Less prevalent alcohols found in alcoholic beverages, are secondary, and tertiary alcohols For example, the tertiary alcohol 2M2B which is up to 50 times more potent than ethanol and found in trace quantities in alcoholic beverages, has been synthesized and used as a designer drug Alcoholic beverages are sometimes laced with toxic alcohols, such as methanol (the simplest alcohol) and isopropyl alcohol [16] A mild, brief exposure to isopropyl alcohol (which is only moderately more toxic than ethanol) is unlikely to cause any serious harm But many methanol poisoning incidents have occurred through history, since methanol is lethal even in small quantities, as little as 10–15 milliliters (2–3 teaspoons) Ethanol is used to treat methanol and ethylene glycol toxicity.\n\n\nSociety and culture\nAlcohol education is the planned provision of information and skills relevant to living in a world where alcohol is commonly misused [332] The World Health Organisations (WHO) Global Status Report on Alcohol and Health, highlights the fact that alcohol will be a larger problem in later years, with estimates suggesting it will be the leading cause of disability and death [333] Informing people on alcohol and harmful drinking should become a priority.\n\n\nEvolving alcohol norms\nAlcohol education is the planned provision of information and skills relevant to living in a world where alcohol is commonly misused [332] The World Health Organisations (WHO) Global Status Report on Alcohol and Health, highlights the fact that alcohol will be a larger problem in later years, with estimates suggesting it will be the leading cause of disability and death [333] Informing people on alcohol and harmful drinking should become a priority.\n\n\nAlcohol education\nAlcohol education is the planned provision of

alcohol will be a larger problem in later years, with estimates suggesting it will be the leading cause of disability and death [333] Informing people on alcohol and harmful drinking should become a priority.\n\n\nDenormalization\nIn October 2024, the WHO Regional Office for Europe has launched the \"Redefine alcohol\" campaign to address alcohol-related health risks, as alcohol causes nearly 1 in 11 deaths in the region The campaign aims to raise awareness about alcohol's link to over 200 diseases, including several cancers, and to encourage healthier choices by sharing research and personal stories It also calls for stricter regulation of alcohol to reduce its societal harm This initiative is part of the WHO/EU Evidence into Action Alcohol Project, which seeks to reduce alcohol-related harm across Europe [334]\n\n\nIntermittent sobriety\nIntermittent sobriety refers to planned periods of abstinence from alcohol, often as part of awareness campaigns or personal health initiatives [335] [336]\n\n\nSober curious\nSober curious is a cultural movement and lifestyle of consuming no or limited alcohol that started in the late 2010s [citation needed] It differs from traditional abstinence in that it is not founded on asceticism, religious condemnation of alcohol or previous alcohol abuse, but motivated by a curiosity of a sober lifestyle Markets have reacted by offering a wider selection of non-alcoholic beverages [337]\n\n\nUsage\nThe recommended maximum intake (or safe limits) of alcohol varies from no intake, to daily, weekly, or daily/weekly guidelines provided by health agencies of governments The World Health Organization published a statement in The Lancet Public Health in April 2023 that \"there is no safe amount that does not affect health\" [15]\n\n\nConsumption recommendations\nThe recommended maximum intake (or safe limits) of alcohol varies from no intake, to daily, weekly, or daily/weekly guidelines provided by health agencies of governments The World Health Organization published a statement in The Lancet Public Health in April 2023 that \"there is no safe amount that does not affect health\" [15]\n\n\nDrinking culture\nEthanol is typically consumed as a recreational substance by mouth in the form of alcoholic beverages such as beer, wine, and spirits It is commonly used in social settings due to its capacity to enhance sociability.\n\n\nPsychosocial factors\nResearch has shown that various psychosocial factors can influence alcohol consumption patterns throughout an individual's life.\n\n\nReligion\nThe relationship between religion and alcohol exhibits variations across cultures, geographical areas, and religious denominations Some religions emphasize moderation and responsible use as a means of honoring the divine gift of life, while others impose outright bans on alcohol as a means of honoring the divine gift of life Moreover, within the same religious tradition, there are many adherents that may interpret and practice their faith's teachings on alcohol in diverse ways Hence, a wide range of factors, such as religious affiliation, levels of religiosity, cultural traditions, family influences, and peer networks, collectively influence the dynamics of this relationship.\n\n\nMisconceptions\nWhile the terms \"drug\" and \"medicine\" are sometimes used interchangeably, \"drug\" can have a negative connotation, often associated with illegal substances like cocaine or heroin [355] Criticism of the alcohol industry may note that the industry argues that \"alcohol is not a drug\" [356] [357] However, the term \"Alcohol and Other Drugs\" emphasizes this inclusion by grouping alcohol with other substances that alter mood and behavior.\n\n\nLaw\nAlcohol consumption is fully legal and available in most countries of the world [363] Home made alcoholic beverages with low alcohol content like wine, and beer is also legal in most countries, but distilling moonshine outside of a registered distillery remains illegal in most of them.\n\n\nLegal status\nAlcohol consumption is fully legal and available in most countries of the world [363] Home made alcoholic beverages with low alcohol content like wine, and beer is also legal in most countries, but distilling moonshine outside of a registered distillery remains illegal in most of them.\n\n\nAlcohol packaging warning messages\nAlcohol packaging warning messages (alcohol warning labels, AWLs [369]) are warning messages that appear on the packaging of alcoholic drinks concerning their health effects.\n\n\nMinimum pricing policies\nIn 2018, Scotland became the first country to implement a minimum unit pricing policy for alcohol, setting the price at 50 pence per unit This measure aimed to reduce alcohol-related harm by making cheap, high-strength alcohol less accessible As of September 2024, the minimum price has increased to 65 pence per unit, reflecting efforts to address inflation and continue reducing alcohol-related deaths and hospital admissions [371]\n\n\nCriticism of the alcohol industry\nA 2019 survey conducted by the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) showed that only 45% of Americans were aware of the associated risk of cancer due to alcohol consumption, up from 39% in 2017 [372] The AICR believes that alcohol advertising about the healthy cardiovascular benefits of modest alcohol overshadow messages about the increased cancer risks [372]\n\n\nStandard drink\nA standard drink is a measure of alcohol consumption representing a fixed amount of pure ethanol, used in relation to recommendations about alcohol consumption and its relative risks to health The size of a standard drink varies from 8g to 20g across countries, but 10g alcohol (12.7 millilitres) is used in the World Health Organization (WHO) Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT)'s questionnaire form example, [379] and has been adopted by more countries than any other amount [380]\n\n\nHistory\nThe consumption of alcohol has a long human history Beginning with the Gin Craze, excessive drinking and drunkenness developed into a major problem for public health [381] [382] Prohibition marked a turning point, as alcohol transitioned from widely accepted to strictly controlled, recognized as a dangerous drug After its repeal, societal views softened dramatically Alcohol consumption became normalized, and for many years, the public remained largely unaware of the well-established dangers, including its carcinogenic and teratogenic properties However, a recent shift has brought these risks back to light The WHO's 2023 declaration that no amount of alcohol consumption is entirely safe served as a wake-up call.\n\n\nAncient World\nSince antiquity, prior to the development of modern agents, alcohol was used as a general anaesthetic [383]\n\n\nLate Middle Ages\nAlcohol has been used as an antiseptic as early as 1363 with evidence to support its use becoming available in the late 1800s [citation needed]\n\n\nEarly modern period\nThe popular story dates the etymology of the term Dutch courage to English soldiers fighting in the Anglo-Dutch Wars [386] (1652–1674) and perhaps as early as the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648) One version states that jenever (or Dutch gin) was used by English soldiers for its calming effects before battle, and for its purported warming properties on the body in cold weather Another version has it that English soldiers noted the bravery-inducing effects of jenever on Dutch soldiers [387] [388]\n\n\nModern period\nDuring the early modern period (1500–1800), sailors required significant quantities of fresh water on extended voyages Since desalinating sea water was not practical, fresh water was taken aboard in casks, but quickly developed algae and became slimy Stagnant water was sweetened with beer or wine to make it palatable, which involved more casks and was subject to spoilage As longer voyages became more common, the storage of the sailors' substantial daily ration of water plus beer or wine became a problem Also, the rum ration (also called the tot) was a daily amount of rum given to sailors on Royal Navy ships It started 1866 and was abolished in 1970 after concerns that the intake of strong alcohol would lead to unsteady hands when working machinery.\n\n\nAlcohol as a gateway drug\nAlcohol and nicotine prime the brain for a heightened response to other drugs and are, like marijuana, also typically used before a person progresses to other, more harmful substances.\" [393]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

he also played a wide variety of electric and acoustic guitars from companies such as Rickenbacker, Gibson, and Fender As a slide guitarist, he favoured the open E and open G tunings [44]\n\n\nChanges in band dynamics and estrangement from bandmates\nOldham recognised the financial advantages of band members writing their own songs, as exemplified by Lennon–McCartney, and that playing covers would not sustain a band in the limelight for long Further, he wanted to make Jagger's charisma and flamboyance a focus of live performances Jones saw his influence over the Stones' direction wane as their repertoire comprised fewer blues covers than he preferred; more Jagger/Richards originals developed (although many still had a bluesy sound), and Oldham increased his own managerial control, displacing Jones from yet another role [47]\n\n\nLegal issues and departure from the Rolling Stones\nJones was arrested a second time on 21 May 1968 for possession of cannabis, which he said had been left by previous tenants of the flat Because he was on probation at the time, he faced a long jail sentence if found guilty The jury found him guilty, but the judge had sympathy for Jones; instead of jailing him, he fined him £50 (equivalent to £1,095 in 2023 [22]) plus £105 in costs (equivalent to £2,300 in 2023 [22]) and told him: \"For goodness' sake, don't get into trouble again or it really will be serious.\" [57]\n\n\nDeath\nAt around midnight on the night of 2–3 July 1969, Jones was discovered motionless at the bottom of his swimming pool at Cotchford Farm His Swedish girlfriend, Anna Wohlin, was convinced he was alive when he was taken out of the pool, insisting he still had a pulse However, by the time the doctors arrived, it was too late, and he was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital at the age of 27 The coroner's report stated it was a drowning, later clarified as \"death by misadventure\", and noted his liver and heart were greatly enlarged by past drug and alcohol abuse [64] [66]\n\n\nMurder theory\nTheories surrounding Jones's death developed soon afterwards, with associates of the Stones claiming to have information that he was murdered [73] [74] According to rock biographer Philip Norman, \"the murder theory would bubble back to the surface every five years or so\" [73] In 1993, it was reported that Jones was murdered by Frank Thorogood, a builder who was doing construction work on the property He was the last person to see Jones alive Thorogood allegedly confessed the murder to the Rolling Stones' driver Tom Keylock, [75] who later denied this [76] The Thorogood theory was dramatised in the 2005 film Stoned [77] Thorogood is alleged to have killed Jones in a fight over money; he had been paid £18,000 for work on Cotchford Farm but he wanted another £6,000 [78] The killing is alleged to have been covered up by senior police officers when they discovered how badly the investigation into Jones's death had been botched by the local police [78]\n\n\nSongwriting credits\nUnsure and insecure as a composer, Jones was not a prolific songwriter The 30-second \"Rice Krispies\" jingle for Kellogg's, co-written with the J Walter Thompson advertising agency in 1963 and performed by the Rolling Stones incognito, was credited to Jones;

He was a talented multi-instrumentalist and played a significant role in shaping the band's sound and style in the early years.\n\n**Biography**\n\nLewis Brian Hopkin Jones was born on February 28, 1942, in the Park Nursing Home in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. He was the first of two children to Lewis Blount Jones and Louisa Beatrice Jones (née Simmonds), a middle-class couple of Welsh descent. Jones's early life was marked by illness, including an attack of croup at the age of four, which left him with asthma that lasted for the rest of his life.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJones's family moved to Cheltenham, where he spent most of his childhood. He had a close relationship with his parents, who encouraged his musical interests from an early age. Jones's sister, Pamela, was born in 1943, and his sister, Barbara, was born in 1946. Tragically, Pamela died of leukemia in 1945 at the age of two.\n\n**Relationships and Fatherhood**\n\nJones's first child was born in 1958 to a female friend, but the baby was given up for adoption. Jones never had any further children of his own.\n\n**Forming the Rolling Stones**\n\nIn the late 1950s, Jones left Cheltenham and moved to London, where he became friends with fellow musicians Alexis Korner, Paul Jones, and Jack Bruce. He started a group called the Roosters, which later evolved into the Rolling Stones. Jones became the group's guitarist, singer, and leader, and his talent and charisma helped shape the band's early sound.\n\n**Musical Contributions**\n\nJones was a gifted multi-instrumentalist, proficient on a wide variety of musical instruments. He was particularly skilled on the guitar, and his playing style was characterized by his use of slide and open tunings. Jones's ability to play a wide variety of instruments is evident on the Rolling Stones' albums \"Aftermath\" (1966), \"Between the Buttons\" (1967), and \"Their Satanic Majesties Request\" (1967). He also played a wide range of electric and acoustic guitars from companies such as Rickenbacker, Gibson, and Fender.\n\n**Changes in Band Dynamics and Estrangement from Bandmates**\n\nAs the Rolling Stones' popularity grew, the band's dynamics began to change. The band's manager, Andrew Oldham, recognized the financial advantages of band members writing their own songs, and he encouraged Jagger and Richards to focus on their own songwriting. This led to a decline in Jones's influence over the band's direction, as the band began to rely more on Jagger and Richards's original material. Jones's relationship with the other band members also began to deteriorate, as he felt increasingly marginalized and excluded from the band's decision-making process.\n\n**Legal Issues and Departure from the Rolling Stones**\n\nIn May 1968, Jones was arrested for possession of cannabis, which he claimed had been left by previous tenants of his flat. He was found guilty and fined £50, plus £105 in costs. However, the judge had sympathy for Jones and warned him to stay out of trouble.\n\n**Death**\n\nJones's death on July 3, 1969, was a shock to the music world. He was found motionless at the bottom of his swimming pool at Cotchford Farm, his home in Sussex. The coroner's report stated that Jones had died by drowning, but it was later clarified as \"death by misadventure.\" Jones's liver and heart were found to be greatly enlarged due to past drug and alcohol abuse.\n\n**Murder Theory**\n\nThere have been various theories surrounding Jones's death, including speculation that he was murdered by Frank Thorogood, a builder who was working on the property at the time. According to this theory, Thorogood killed Jones in a fight over money, and the killing was covered up by senior police officers. However, there is no concrete evidence to support this theory, and the official cause of death remains \"death by misadventure.\"\n\n**Songwriting Credits**\n\nJones was not a prolific songwriter, and his contributions to the Rolling Stones' songwriting credits were largely overlooked. However, he was credited as a co-writer on some of the band's earliest songs, including \"Rice Krispies,\" a 30-second jingle that was performed by the band incognito.\n\n**Other Contributions**\n\nJones's passion for world music led him to record with the Master Musicians of Joujouka, a Moroccan ensemble. The recording, titled \"Brian Jones Presents the Pipes of Pan at Joujouka,\" was released in 1971 and later re-released in 1995.\n\n**Equipment**\n\nJones's main guitar in the early years was a Harmony Stratotone, which he later replaced with a Gretsch Double Anniversary in two-tone green. He also played various Gibson Firebird models, a Gibson ES-330, and a Gibson Les Paul.\n\n**Public Image and Legacy**\n\nJones's musicianship, fashion sense, and hairstyle all contributed to his enduring public image and legacy. He was a true original, and his influence can still be seen in many modern musicians.\n\n**Discography**\n\nWith the Rolling Stones:\n\n* \"The Rolling Stones\" (1964)\n* \"12 X 5\" (1964)\n* \"The Rolling Stones No. 2\" (1965)\n* \"Out of Our Heads\" (1965)\n* \"December's Children (And Everybody's)\" (1965)\n* \"Aftermath\" (1966)\n* \"Between the Buttons\" (1967)\n* \"Their Satanic Majesties Request\" (1967)\n* \"Beggars Banquet\" (1968)\n* \"Let It Bleed\" (1969)\n\nThis article provides a comprehensive overview of Brian Jones's life and career, from his early days as a young musician to his tragic death and his lasting legacy as a true original.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Brian_Jones\" following this outline:\n\n\nBiography\nLewis Brian Hopkin Jones [2] [3] was born in the Park Nursing Home in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, on Saturday, 28 February 1942 [4] An attack of croup at the age of four left Jones with asthma that lasted for the rest of his life His middle-class parents, Lewis Blount Jones and Louisa Beatrice Jones (née Simmonds), were of Welsh descent Brian had two sisters: Pamela, who was born on 3 October 1943 [5] and died on 14 October 1945 of leukaemia;

When playing favourites Hungary in the group stage, West Germany lost 3–8, and faced the Hungarian \"Mighty Magyars\" again in the final Hungary had gone unbeaten for 32 consecutive matches, and West

the best clubs from the various Regionalligas were assembled into the new Bundesliga In 1964, Helmut Schön took over as coach, replacing Herberger who had been in office for 28 years.\n\n\n1974 World Cup title on home soil\nIn 1971, Franz Beckenbauer became captain of the national team, and he led West Germany to victory at the European Championship at Euro 1972, defeating the Soviet Union 3–0 in the final [42] [43]\n\n\nLate 1970s and early 1980s\nWest Germany failed to defend their titles in the next two major international tournaments They lost to Czechoslovakia in the UEFA Euro 1976 final in a penalty shootout 5–3, [48] their last penalty shootout loss in a major tournament as of 2022 [49]\n\n\nBeckenbauer's managing success (1984–1990)\nAfter West Germany were eliminated in the first

Spain 2–0 in the group stage, [59] West Germany's hopes of winning the tournament on home soil were spoiled by the Netherlands, as the Dutch beat them 2–1 in the semi-finals [60] [61]\n\n\nOlympic football\nEast Germany did however achieve significantly greater success in Olympic football than the amateur teams fielded by the Western NOC of Germany due to using its elite players from the top domestic league In 1956, 1960, and 1964 both states had sent a United Team of Germany For 1964, the East German side had beaten their Western counterparts in order to be selected They went on to win the bronze medal for Germany As GDR, they won bronze in 1972 in Munich, gold in 1976 in Montreal, and silver in 1980 in Moscow.\n\n\nBerti Vogts years (1990–1998)\nIn February 1990, three months after the fall of the Berlin Wall, East Germany and West Germany were drawn together in UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying Group 5 In November 1990, the East German association Deutscher Fußball-Verband integrated into the DFB, by which time the East Germany team had ceased operations, playing its last match on 12 September 1990 The unified Germany national team completed the European Championship qualifying group The East German 1990–91 league continued, with a restructuring of German leagues in 1991–92 The first game with a unified Germany national team was against Switzerland on 19 December [66]\n\n\nErich Ribbeck and Rudi Völler years (2000–2004)\nIn Euro 2000, the team went out in the first round, drawing with Romania, then suffering a 1–0 defeat to England and were routed 3–0 by Portugal (which fielded their backup players, having already advanced) [75] Ribbeck resigned, and was replaced by Rudi Völler [76]\n\n\nResurgence under Klinsmann (2004–2006)\nKlinsmann's main task was to lead the national team to a good showing at the 2006 World Cup in Germany He relieved goalkeeper Kahn of the captaincy and announced that Kahn and longtime backup Jens Lehmann would be competing for the position of starting goaltender, a decision that angered Kahn and Lehmann eventually won that contest [86] Expectations for the team were low, which was not helped by veteran defender Christian Wörns being dropped (after Wörns criticised Klinsmann for designating him only as a backup player on the squad), a choice roundly panned in Germany Italy routed Germany 4–1 in a March 2006 exhibition game, and Klinsmann bore the brunt of the criticism as the team was ranked only 22nd in the world entering the 2006 World Cup [87]\n\n\nLöw era (2006–2021)\nGermany's entry into

United States They first faced Portugal in a match billed by some as the \"team of all the talents against the team of The Talent (Cristiano Ronaldo)\", routing the Portuguese 4–0 thanks to a hat-trick by Thomas Müller [109] [110] In their match with Ghana, they led the game before Ghana fought back to lead the match Klose scored a goal to level Germany 2–2, his 15th World Cup goal to join former Brazil striker Ronaldo at the pinnacle of World Cup Finals scorers They then went on to defeat the Klinsmann-led United States 1–0, securing them a spot in the knockout stages.\n\n\nEuro 2016 to 2017 Confederations Cup\nAfter several players retired from the team following the 2014 World Cup win, including Philipp Lahm, Per Mertesacker and Miroslav Klose, the team had a disappointing start in the UEFA Euro 2016 qualifiers They defeated Scotland 2–1 at home, then suffered a 2–0 loss at Poland (the first in their history), a 1–1 draw against the Republic of Ireland, and a 4–0 win over Gibraltar Troubles during qualifying for the 2016 European Championship continued, drawing at home, as well as losing away, to Ireland; the team also only narrowly defeated Scotland on two occasions, but handily won the return against Poland and both games against Gibraltar (who competed for the first time) They would eventually win their group and qualify for the tournament.\n\n\nDisappointment at the 2018 World Cup, 2018–19 UEFA Nations League and Euro 2020\nAfter winning all their qualifying matches and the Confederations Cup the previous year, Germany started their 2018 World Cup campaign with a defeat to Mexico, their first loss in an opening match since the 1982 World Cup [126] Germany defeated Sweden 2–1 in their second game via an injury-time winner from Toni Kroos, but were subsequently eliminated following a 2–0 loss to South Korea, their first exit in the first round since 1938 and first in the group stage since the format had been reintroduced in 1950 With this result Germany became the fifth defending champions to be eliminated in the group stages of the World Cup, following Brazil in 1966, France in 2002, Italy in 2010, and Spain in 2014 [127] [128]\n\n\nRecent years (2021–present)\nFollowing Germany's disappointment at Euro 2020, Hansi Flick, former Bayern Munich manager, took over as coach of the national team On 11 October 2021, Germany beat North Macedonia 4–0 to become the first team (outside of the hosts) to qualify for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar [136] In the 2022–23 Nations League, Germany recorded their first-ever competitive win against Italy as the Germans beat the visitors 5–2 This was Germany's fourth game and first win in the league, however the Germans finished third in the group [137]\n\n\nTeam image\nThe national team's home

tournament [149] The away shirt colour has changed several times Historically, a green shirt with white shorts is the most often used alternative colour combination, derived from the DFB colours –

War II However, the first team to play Germany after WWII, as stated above, was actually Switzerland [150] Other colours such as red, grey and black have also been used.\n\n\nKits and crest\nThe

Portugal (which fielded their backup players, having already advanced) [75] Ribbeck resigned, and was replaced by Rudi Völler [76]\n\n\nResurgence under Klinsmann (2004–2006)\nKlinsmann's main task was to lead the national team to a good showing at the 2006 World Cup in Germany He relieved goalkeeper Kahn of the captaincy and announced that Kahn and longtime backup Jens Lehmann would be competing for the position of starting goaltender, a decision that angered Kahn and Lehmann eventually won that contest [86] Expectations for the team were low, which was not helped by veteran defender Christian Wörns being dropped (after Wörns criticised Klinsmann for designating him only as a backup player on the squad), a choice roundly panned in Germany Italy routed Germany 4–1 in a March 2006 exhibition game, and Klinsmann bore the brunt of the criticism as the team was ranked only 22nd in the world entering the 2006 World Cup [87]\n\n\nLöw era (2006–2021)\nGermany's entry into the Euro 2008 qualifying round was marked by the promotion of Joachim Löw following the resignation of Klinsmann [95]\nAt UEFA Euro 2008, Germany won two out of three matches in group play to advance to the knockout round [96]\nThey defeated Portugal 3–2 in the quarter-final, [97]\nand won their semi-final against Turkey [98]\nGermany lost the final against Spain 1–0, finishing as the runners-up

Euro 2008, Germany won two out of three matches in group play to advance to the knockout round [96]\nThey defeated Portugal 3–2 in the quarter-final, [97]\nand won their semi-final against Turkey [98]\nGermany lost the final against Spain 1–0, finishing as the runners-up [99]\n\n\n2014 World Cup victory\nGermany were placed in Group G of the 2014 World Cup, [108] with Portugal, Ghana, and the United States They first faced Portugal in a match billed by some as the \"team of all the talents against the team of The Talent (Cristiano Ronaldo)\", routing the Portuguese 4–0 thanks to a hat-trick by Thomas Müller [109] [110] In their match with Ghana, they led the game before Ghana fought back to lead the match Klose scored a goal to level Germany 2–2, his 15th World Cup goal to join former Brazil striker Ronaldo at the pinnacle of World Cup Finals scorers They then went on to defeat the Klinsmann-led United States 1–0, securing them a spot in the knockout stages.\n\n\nEuro 2016 to 2017 Confederations Cup\nAfter several players retired from the team following the 2014 World Cup win, including Philipp Lahm, Per Mertesacker and Miroslav Klose, the team had a disappointing start in the UEFA Euro 2016 qualifiers They defeated Scotland 2–1 at home, then suffered a 2–0 loss at Poland (the first in their history), a 1–1 draw against the Republic of Ireland, and a 4–0 win over Gibraltar Troubles during qualifying for the 2016 European Championship continued, drawing at home, as well as losing away, to Ireland; the team also only narrowly defeated Scotland on two occasions, but handily won the return against Poland and both games against Gibraltar (who competed for the first time) They would eventually win their group and qualify for the tournament.\n\n\nDisappointment at the 2018 World Cup, 2018–19 UEFA Nations League and Euro 2020\nAfter winning all their qualifying matches and the Confederations Cup the previous year, Germany started their 2018 World Cup campaign with a defeat to Mexico, their first loss in an opening match since the 1982 World Cup [126] Germany defeated Sweden 2–1 in their second game via an injury-time winner from Toni Kroos, but were subsequently eliminated following a 2–0 loss to South Korea, their first exit in the first round since 1938 and first in the group stage since the format had been reintroduced in 1950 With this result Germany became the fifth defending champions to be eliminated in the group stages of the World Cup, following Brazil in 1966, France in 2002, Italy in 2010, and Spain in 2014 [127] [128]\n\n\nRecent years (2021–present)\nFollowing Germany's disappointment at Euro 2020, Hansi Flick, former Bayern Munich manager, took over as coach of the national team On 11 October 2021, Germany beat North Macedonia 4–0 to become the first team (outside of the hosts) to qualify for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar [136] In the 2022–23 Nations League, Germany recorded their first-ever competitive win against Italy as the Germans beat the visitors 5–2 This was Germany's fourth game and first win in the league, however the Germans finished third in the group [137]\n\n\nTeam image\nThe national team's home kit has been traditionally a white shirt, black shorts, and white socks The colours are derived from the 19th-century flag of the North German State of Prussia [148] Since 1988, many of the home kit's designs incorporate details patterned after the modern German flag For the 2014 World Cup, Germany's kit was white shorts rather than the traditional black due to FIFA's kit clashing rule for the tournament [149] The away shirt colour has changed several times Historically, a green shirt with white shorts is the most often used alternative colour combination, derived from the DFB colours – though it is often erroneously reported that the choice is in recognition of the fact that Ireland, whose home shirts are green, were the first nation to play Germany in a friendly game after World War II However, the first team to play Germany after WWII, as stated above, was actually Switzerland [150] Other colours such as red, grey and black have also been used.\n\n\nKits and crest\nThe

[71] The actor also went on a strict weight-loss diet to play the slim crime fighter [17] The Green Hornet was a critical disappointment; Adam Graham of the Detroit News called it \"a big, sloppy, loud, grating mess of a movie,\" [72] and the Arizona Republic's Bill Goodykoontz found its story to have fallen apart [73] Nonetheless, it still opened at No 1 at the box office, making $33 million in its opening weekend before going on to gross more than $225 million [74] In 2011, Rogen and Evan Goldberg founded the production company Point Grey Pictures, named after Point Grey Secondary School, which they both attended [75]\n\n\n2015–present: Career expansion\nRogen portrayed Apple Inc co-founder Steve Wozniak in the Danny Boyle–directed Steve Jobs biopic (2015), based on a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin His performance in the film was widely praised, and he was commended by Wozniak himself for doing an \"excellent job.\" [100] [101] In November 2015, Rogen starred alongside Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anthony Mackie in the Christmas-themed comedy The Night Before as three best friends who annually reunite to celebrate Christmas Eve [102] In 2016, he reprised his voice role as Master Mantis in Kung Fu Panda 3 and as Mac Radner in the Neighbors sequel Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising [103] [104] Along with Goldberg and Sam Catlin, Rogen developed the television series Preacher for Sony Pictures Television, which premiered on AMC in May 2016 [105] The show is based on the comic book series of the same name that was created by Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon and follows a small-town preacher named Jesse Custer (played by Dominic Cooper) who possesses a superpower that allows him to command others to do as he says [106] His last release of 2016 was the animated comedy Sausage Party, which, in addition to voicing the lead character Frank – a sausage that tries to escape his fate in a supermarket – he co-wrote and produced Sausage Party became the most commercially successful R-rated animated film of all time, overtaking South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut (1999) [107] Associated Press critic Lindsey Bahr wrote of the film: \"There is no one out there making comedies quite like Rogen and Goldberg They are putting their definitive stamp on the modern American comedy one decency-smashing double entendre at a time.\" [108]\n\n\nPolitical views and activism\nPolitically, Rogen describes himself as \"left wing\" [136]\n\n\nViews on Israel\nDuring his July 2020 promotional tour for his comedy, An American Pickle, Rogen said he was \"fed a huge amount of lies about Israel\" growing up, commenting: \"They never tell you that – 'Oh, by the way, there were people there.' They make it seem like it was just like sitting there, like the fucking door's open.\"\n\n\nPersonal life\nRogen began dating writer and actress Lauren Miller in 2004 They met while he was working on Da Ali G Show [22] They became engaged on September 29, 2010 [156] and married on October 2, 2011 in Sonoma County, California [157] Miller has had minor onscreen roles in a few of Rogen's films [158] They have stated they do not plan to have children [159]\n\n\nFilmography and awards\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The Clone Wars as the voice of all the clone troopers, including the members of the Bad Batch, Captain Rex, and many others [7] [13] Baker replaced New Zealand actor Temuera Morrison, who portrayed the clones—as well as the bounty hunter Jango Fett whose genetic material the clones are created from—in the Star Wars prequel films [85] Also starring in The Bad Batch is Michelle Ang as Omega, a young female clone of Jango Fett [27] Ang was cast in-part because her New Zealand accent aligns with Morrison's, and she was grateful for the opportunity to embrace that side of her identity considering she does not look like \"what the world thinks of when they think New Zealander\" as a person of Chinese and Malaysian descent Baker and Ang recorded the first episode of the series together, but other work commitments forced Ang to travel home to New Zealand soon after and the COVID-19 pandemic prevented her from returning to record with Baker for many subsequent episodes Ang instead recorded much of her dialogue for the series remotely over video calls [29] Ang and Baker were able to record the series finale together in-person, which they said was an emotional experience for them and the crew [86]\n\n\nMusic\nKevin Kiner was confirmed to be composing the score for the series in January 2021, after previously doing so for The Clone Wars and Rebels [89] As with the other animated Star Wars series, Kevin collaborated with his children Sean and Deana [90] David Glen Russell and Peter Lam also provided additional music [91] [92] Sean and Deana Kiner are credited as co-composers with Kevin Kiner for the third season [citation needed]\n\n\nMarketing\nLucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy promoted the series at Disney's Investor Day event on December 10, 2020, revealing the first trailer for the series Jacob Oller of Syfy Wire felt the trailer made the series look like a more action-heavy version of The Clone Wars, and compared it to the 1980s television series The A-Team [7] Ahead of the series premiere, characters from the series were also added to the mobile role-playing game Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes as unlockable, playable characters [100]\n\n\nRelease\nStar Wars: The Bad Batch premiered on Disney+ on May 4, 2021, which is Star Wars Day, [101] with a special 70-minute episode [13] The rest of the 16-episode first season was

The Clone Wars as the voice of all the clone troopers, including the members of the Bad Batch, Captain Rex, and many others [7] [13] Baker replaced New Zealand actor Temuera Morrison, who portrayed the clones—as well as the bounty hunter Jango Fett whose genetic material the clones are created from—in the Star Wars prequel films [85] Also starring in The Bad Batch is Michelle Ang as Omega, a young female clone of Jango Fett [27] Ang was cast in-part because her New Zealand accent aligns with Morrison's, and she was grateful for the opportunity to embrace that side of her identity considering she does not look like \"what the world thinks of when they think New Zealander\" as a person of Chinese and Malaysian descent Baker and Ang recorded the first episode of the series together, but other work commitments forced Ang to travel home to New Zealand soon after and the COVID-19 pandemic prevented her from returning to record with Baker for many subsequent episodes Ang instead recorded much of her dialogue for the series remotely over video calls [29] Ang and Baker were able to record the series finale together in-person, which they said was an emotional experience for them and the crew [86]\n\n\nMusic\nKevin Kiner was confirmed to be composing the score for the series in January 2021, after previously doing so for The Clone Wars and Rebels [89] As with the other animated Star Wars series, Kevin collaborated with his children Sean and Deana [90] David Glen Russell and Peter Lam also provided additional music [91] [92] Sean and Deana Kiner are credited as co-composers with Kevin Kiner for the third season [citation needed]\n\n\nMarketing\nLucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy promoted the series at Disney's Investor Day event on December 10, 2020, revealing the first trailer for the series Jacob Oller of Syfy Wire felt the trailer made the series look like a more action-heavy version of The Clone Wars, and compared it to the 1980s television series The A-Team [7] Ahead of the series premiere, characters from the series were also added to the mobile role-playing game Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes as unlockable, playable characters [100]\n\n\nRelease\nStar Wars: The Bad Batch premiered on Disney+ on May 4, 2021, which is Star Wars Day, [101] with a special 70-minute episode [13] The rest of the 16-episode first season was

{"title": "Godzilla_(franchise)", "content": "\nHistory\nThe Godzilla film series is broken into several different eras reflecting a characteristic style and corresponding to the same eras used to classify all kaiju eiga (monster movies) in Japan The first, second, and fourth eras refer to the Japanese emperor during production: the Shōwa era, the Heisei era, and the Reiwa era The third is called the Millennium era, as the emperor (Heisei) is the same, but these films are considered to have a different style and storyline than the Heisei era.\n\n\nShōwa era (1954–1975)\nThe initial series of films are named after the Shōwa era (as all of these films were produced during Emperor Shōwa's reign) [19] [20] This Shōwa timeline spanned from 1954, with Godzilla, to 1975, with Terror of Mechagodzilla \n\n\nHeisei era (1984–1995)\nToho rebooted the series in 1984 with The Return of Godzilla, starting the second era of Godzilla films, known as the Heisei series [38] The Return of Godzilla serves as a direct sequel to the original 1954 film and ignores the subsequent events of the Shōwa era The Return of Godzilla was released in 1984, five years before the new Emperor, but is considered part of this era, as it is a direct predecessor to Godzilla vs Biollante (1989), which came out in the first year of the new Emperor's reign [39]\n\n\nMillennium era (1999–2004)\nToho rebooted the franchise for a second time with the 1999 film Godzilla 2000: Millennium starting the third era of Godzilla films, known as the Millennium series [40] [41] The Millennium series is treated similarly to an anthology series where each film is a standalone story, with the 1954 film serving as the only previous point of reference Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla and Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S are the only films in the Millennium era to share continuity with each other and are also connected to 1961's Mothra.\n\n\nReiwa era (2016–present)\nIn December 2014, Toho announced plans for a new Godzilla film of its own for a 2016 release [43] The film is Toho's reboot of the Godzilla franchise, after Legendary Pictures' reboot in 2014; the film is co-directed by Hideaki Anno and Shinji Higuchi (both of whom collaborated on the anime Neon Genesis Evangelion), with the screenplay by Anno and the visual effects directed by Higuchi [44] [45] [46] Principal photography began in September and ended in October with the special effects work following in November that year [47] [48] Shin Godzilla was released in Japan on July 29, 2016, in IMAX, 4DX, and MX4D to positive reviews and was a box office success [49]\n\n\nAmerican films\nIn 2007, a CGI Godzilla appeared in the Toho slice of life film Always: Sunset on Third Street 2 [122] In an imaginary sequence, Godzilla destroys part of 1959 Tokyo, with one of the main protagonists getting angry that Godzilla damaged his car showroom The making of the sequence was kept a secret Godzilla has been referenced in, and has briefly appeared in, several other films [123] [124] Godzilla guest starred in the show Crayon Shin-chan as an antagonist [125] Godzilla also appears in cave paintings (alongside Rodan, Mothra and King Ghidorah) in a post-credits scene in Kong: Skull Island In 2019, Godzilla made an appearance in the anime film Shinkansen Henkei Robo Shinkalion the Movie: Mirai Kara Kita Shinsoku no ALFA-X [126]\n\n\nThe Volcano Monsters (1957)\nThe producers of Godzilla, King of the Monsters! – Harry Rybnick, Richard Kay, Edward Barison, Paul Schreibman, and Edmund Goldman – purchased the North American rights to the 1955 sequel Godzilla Raids Again but rather than localize or dub the film in English, they chose to produce a new film that would repurpose the effects footage from Godzilla Raids Again; filming was expected to begin in June 1957 Rybnick hired Ib Melchior and Edwin Watson to write a script, titled The Volcano Monsters, that focused on a new story with American characters centered around the effects footage Toho approved of the idea in early 1957 and shipped the Godzilla and Anguirus suits for additional photography to be shot at Howard A Anderson's special effects studio Rybnick and Barison originally made a deal with AB-PT Pictures Corp to co-finance the film but plans for The Volcano Monsters were cancelled after AB-PT Pictures folded Schreibman, Goldman, and new financier Newton P Jacobs, decided to dub Godzilla Raids Again into English instead [70] [71]\n\n\nUnproduced 3D film (1983)\nIn 1983, director Steve Miner pitched his idea for an American 3D production of Godzilla to Toho, with storyboards by William Stout and a script written by Fred Dekker, titled Godzilla: King of the Monsters in 3D, which would have featured Godzilla rampaging through San Francisco in an attempt to find its offspring [73] Various studios and producers expressed interest but passed it over due to high budget concerns [74] The film would have featured a full scale animatronic Godzilla head built by Rick Baker, stop motion animation executed by David W Allen, an articulated stop motion Godzilla figure created by Stephen Czerkas, and additional storyboards by Doug Wildey [75] [76] The production design would have been overseen by William Stout [77]\n\n\nTriStar Pictures (1998–2000)\nIn October 1992, TriStar Pictures acquired the rights from Toho with plans to produce a trilogy [85] Director Jan de Bont and writers Terry Rossio and Ted Eliott developed a script that had Godzilla battling a shape-shifting alien called \"the Gryphon\" De Bont later left the project after budget disagreements with the studio [86] Roland Emmerich was hired to direct and co-write a new script with producer Dean Devlin.\n\n\nLegendary Pictures (2014–present)\nIn 2004, director Yoshimitsu Banno acquired permission from Toho to produce a short IMAX Godzilla film In 2009, the project was turned over to Legendary Pictures to be redeveloped as a feature film [96] Announced in March 2010, the film was co-produced with Warner Bros Pictures and was directed by Gareth Edwards [97] [98]\n\n\nFilmography\nGodzilla\n\n\nToho films\nGodzilla\n\n\nAmerican films\nIn 2007, a CGI Godzilla appeared in the Toho slice of life film Always: Sunset on Third Street 2 [122] In an imaginary sequence, Godzilla destroys part of 1959 Tokyo, with one of the main protagonists getting angry that Godzilla damaged his car showroom The making of the sequence was kept a secret Godzilla has been referenced in, and has briefly appeared in, several other films [123] [124] Godzilla guest starred in the show Crayon Shin-chan as an antagonist [125] Godzilla also appears in cave paintings (alongside Rodan, Mothra and King Ghidorah) in a post-credits scene in Kong: Skull Island In 2019, Godzilla made an appearance in the anime film Shinkansen Henkei Robo Shinkalion the Movie: Mirai Kara Kita Shinsoku no ALFA-X [126]\n\n\nGuest appearances\nIn 2007, a CGI Godzilla appeared in the Toho slice of life film Always: Sunset on Third Street 2 [122] In an imaginary sequence, Godzilla destroys part of 1959 Tokyo, with one of the main protagonists getting angry that Godzilla damaged his car showroom The making of the sequence was kept a secret Godzilla has been referenced in, and has briefly appeared in, several other films [123] [124] Godzilla guest starred in the show Crayon Shin-chan as an antagonist [125] Godzilla also appears in cave paintings (alongside Rodan, Mothra and King Ghidorah) in a post-credits scene in Kong: Skull Island In 2019, Godzilla made an appearance in the anime film Shinkansen Henkei Robo Shinkalion the Movie: Mirai Kara Kita Shinsoku no ALFA-X [126]\n\n\nLocalized releases\nIn 1956, Jewell Enterprises Inc., released Godzilla, King of the Monsters!, an American localization of Godzilla (1954) This version removed most of the political themes and social commentaries, resulting in 30 minutes of footage from the Japanese version replaced with new footage featuring Raymond Burr interacting with Japanese actors and look-alikes to make it seem like Burr was a part of the original Japanese production In addition, the soundtrack and sound effects were slightly altered and some dialogue was dubbed into English [32] This release is referred to as an \"Americanization\" or the \"Americanized\" version by some sources [127] [128] [129] Similar localizations (or Americanizations) occurred for the U.S releases of King Kong vs Godzilla [130] and The Return of Godzilla, released in the U.S as Godzilla 1985;

The franchise has grown to become one of the most recognizable and beloved monster movies of all time, with a vast array of films, television shows, video games, and other media. The franchise has undergone several revisions and reboots over the years, resulting in a complex and diverse body of work.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Godzilla film series is broken into several different eras reflecting a characteristic style and corresponding to the same eras used to classify all kaiju eiga (monster movies) in Japan. The first, second, and fourth eras refer to the Japanese emperor during production: the Shōwa era, the Heisei era, and the Reiwa era. The third is called the Millennium era, as the emperor (Heisei) is the same, but these films are considered to have a different style and storyline than the Heisei era.\n\n**Shōwa era (1954–1975)**\n\nThe initial series of films are named after the Shōwa era (as all of these films were produced during Emperor Shōwa's reign). This Shōwa timeline spanned from 1954, with Godzilla, to 1975, with Terror of Mechagodzilla. The Shōwa era films are characterized by their dark and serious tone, often reflecting the fears and anxieties of the Japanese people following World War II.\n\n**Heisei era (1984–1995)**\n\nToho rebooted the series in 1984 with The Return of Godzilla, starting the second era of Godzilla films, known as the Heisei series. The Return of Godzilla serves as a direct sequel to the original 1954 film and ignores the subsequent events of the Shōwa era. The Heisei era films are marked by a more lighthearted and humorous tone, often incorporating comedic elements and action sequences.\n\n**Millennium era (1999–2004)**\n\nToho rebooted the franchise for a second time with the 1999 film Godzilla 2000: Millennium starting the third era of Godzilla films, known as the Millennium series. The Millennium series is treated similarly to an anthology series where each film is a standalone story, with the 1954 film serving as the only previous point of reference. Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla and Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S are the only films in the Millennium era to share continuity with each other and are also connected to 1961's Mothra.\n\n**Reiwa era (2016–present)**\n\nIn December 2014, Toho announced plans for a new Godzilla film of its own for a 2016 release. The film is Toho's reboot of the Godzilla franchise, after Legendary Pictures' reboot in 2014; the film is co-directed by Hideaki Anno and Shinji Higuchi (both of whom collaborated on the anime Neon Genesis Evangelion), with the screenplay by Anno and the visual effects directed by Higuchi. Principal photography began in September and ended in October with the special effects work following in November that year. Shin Godzilla was released in Japan on July 29, 2016, in IMAX, 4DX, and MX4D to positive reviews and was a box office success.\n\n**American films**\n\nIn 2007, a CGI Godzilla appeared in the Toho slice of life film Always: Sunset on Third Street 2. In an imaginary sequence, Godzilla destroys part of 1959 Tokyo, with one of the main protagonists getting angry that Godzilla damaged his car showroom. The making of the sequence was kept a secret. Godzilla has been referenced in, and has briefly appeared in, several other films. Godzilla guest starred in the show Crayon Shin-chan as an antagonist. Godzilla also appears in cave paintings (alongside Rodan, Mothra, and King Ghidorah) in a post-credits scene in Kong: Skull Island. In 2019, Godzilla made an appearance in the anime film Shinkansen Henkei Robo Shinkalion the Movie: Mirai Kara Kita Shinsoku no ALFA-X.\n\n**Localized releases**\n\nIn 1956, Jewell Enterprises Inc., released Godzilla, King of the Monsters!, an American localization of Godzilla (1954). This version removed most of the political themes and social commentaries, resulting in 30 minutes of footage from the Japanese version replaced with new footage featuring Raymond Burr interacting with Japanese actors and look-alikes to make it seem like Burr was a part of the original Japanese production. In addition, the soundtrack and sound effects were slightly altered and some dialogue was dubbed into English. This release is referred to as an \"Americanization\" or the \"Americanized\" version by some sources.\n\n**Godzilla in the United States**\n\nGodzilla and its likeness has appeared in various television-related media, including Robot Chicken, Roseanne, Animaniacs, South Park, Malcolm In The Middle, Chappelle's Show, Rugrats, a Nike commercial with Charles Barkley battling Godzilla, and multiple appearances on The Simpsons, including a Halloween spoof titled Homerzilla.\n\n**Video games**\n\nA game called Gojira-kun (which was originally going to be titled Gojiraland) was released for the MSX in 1985. In 1990, Gojira-kun: Kaijū Daikōshin was released for the Game Boy. In 1993, Super Godzilla was released for the SNES. In 2004, Godzilla: Save the Earth was released by Atari. In 2007, Godzilla: Unleashed was released for the Wii and DS. The 2014 video game Godzilla was released by Bandai Namco. In May 2022, Call of Duty: Warzone featured a cross-over event for Godzilla vs Kong. Godzilla would be confirmed to play in the Kaiju fighting game GigaBash as a guest character.\n\n**Literature**\n\nA Godzilla series of books was published by Random House during the late 1990s and the first half of 2000. The company created different series for different age groups, the Scott Ciencin series being aimed at preteens and the Marc Cerasini series being aimed at teens and young adults. Several manga have been derived from specific Godzilla films and both Marvel and Dark Horse have published Godzilla comic book series (1977–1979 and 1987–1999, respectively). In 2011, IDW Publishing started a new series, Godzilla: Kingdom of Monsters (published in book form under the same title), rebooting the Godzilla story. It was followed by two sequel series, Godzilla (published in book form as Godzilla: History's Greatest Monster) and Godzilla: Rulers of Earth (published in book form as Godzilla: Complete Rulers of Earth Volume 1 and Godzilla: Complete Rulers of Earth Volume 2), as well as seven five-issue miniseries to date.\n\n**Music**\n\nGodzilla: The Album, the soundtrack album of Godzilla (1998), sold 2.5 million copies worldwide. The album's lead single, \"Come with Me\" by Puff Daddy featuring Jimmy Page, sold a certified 2.025 million copies worldwide. Its Japan-exclusive single, \"Lose Control\" by Japanese rock band L'Arc-en-Ciel, sold 938,401 copies in Japan. Shin Godzilla Ongakushuu, the soundtrack album of Shin Godzilla (2016), sold 43,951 copies in Japan. Mars (1991), an album by the Japanese rock duo B'z featuring a Godzilla-themed song, sold 1,730,500 copies in Japan.\n\n**Geographic features**\n\nThe largest megamullion, located 600 kilometres to the south-east of Okinotorishima, the southernmost Japanese island, is named the Godzilla Megamullion. The Japan Coast Guard played a role in naming the feature, reaching an agreement with Toho who owns the rights to Godzilla. Toho's Chief Godzilla officer Keiji Ota stated that \"I am truly honored that (the megamullion) bears Godzilla's name, the Earth's most powerful monster.\"\n\n**Cultural impact**\n\nGodzilla is one of the most recognizable symbols of Japanese popular culture worldwide and is an important facet of Japanese films, embodying the kaiju subset of the tokusatsu genre. It has been considered an allegory of nuclear weapons. The earlier Godzilla films, especially the original Godzilla, portrayed Godzilla as a frightening, nuclear monster. Godzilla represented the fears that many Japanese held about the nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the possibility of recurrence.\n\n**Awards**\n\nIn 1996, Godzilla received an award for Lifetime Achievement at the MTV Movie Awards. Creator and producer Shōgo Tomiyama accepted on his behalf via satellite and was joined by \"Godzilla\" himself.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Godzilla_(franchise)\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nThe Godzilla film series is broken into several different eras reflecting a characteristic style and corresponding to the same eras used to classify all kaiju eiga (monster movies) in Japan The first, second, and fourth eras refer to the Japanese emperor during production: the Shōwa era, the Heisei era, and the Reiwa era The third is called the Millennium era, as the emperor (Heisei) is the same, but these films are considered to have a different style and storyline than the Heisei era.\n\n\nShōwa era (1954–1975)\nThe initial series of films are named after the Shōwa era (as all of these films were produced during Emperor Shōwa's reign) [19] [20] This Shōwa timeline spanned from 1954, with Godzilla, to 1975, with Terror of Mechagodzilla \n\n\nHeisei era (1984–1995)\nToho rebooted the series in 1984 with The Return of Godzilla, starting the second era of Godzilla films, known as the Heisei series [38] The Return of Godzilla serves as a direct sequel to the original 1954 film and ignores the subsequent events of the Shōwa era The Return of Godzilla was released in 1984, five years before the new Emperor, but is considered part of this era, as it is a direct predecessor to Godzilla vs Biollante (1989), which came out in the first year of the new Emperor's reign [39]\n\n\nMillennium era (1999–2004)\nToho rebooted the franchise for a second time with the 1999 film Godzilla 2000: Millennium starting the third era of Godzilla films, known as the Millennium series [40] [41] The Millennium series is treated similarly to an anthology series where each film is a standalone story, with the 1954 film serving as the only previous point of reference Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla and Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S are the only films in the Millennium era to share continuity with each other and are also connected to 1961's Mothra.\n\n\nReiwa era (2016–present)\nIn December 2014, Toho announced plans for a new Godzilla film of its own for a 2016 release [43] The film is Toho's reboot of the Godzilla franchise, after Legendary Pictures' reboot in 2014;

Her life has been a remarkable blend of personal struggles, professional achievements, and dedication to her family.\n\n## Early Life and Education\n\nOracene Price was born in 1952 in Saginaw, Michigan, the daughter of an automotive worker from the Mississippi Delta. Growing up in a working-class family, Price was instilled with the values of hard work and resilience. She graduated from Buena Vista High School in 1970 and went on to attend Western Michigan University, where she further developed her academic and personal interests.\n\n## Personal Life and Marriage\n\nIn her younger years, Price was married to Yusef Rasheed, with whom she had three daughters: Yetunde Price (1972–2003), Lyndrea Price, and Isha Price. After Rasheed's passing, Price embarked on a new journey, marrying Richard Williams, a charismatic tennis coach who would eventually help shape the careers of their two youngest daughters, Venus and Serena.\n\nThe Williams family's life took a dramatic turn when they moved to Florida, where Richard Williams had secured a coaching position for their daughters with renowned coach Rick Macci. This move proved to be a pivotal moment in the family's history, as it provided the girls with access to top-notch training and mentorship.\n\n## Coaching and Mentorship\n\nWhile often overlooked in favor of her husband's coaching style, Oracene Price's influence on her daughters' development cannot be overstated. As a coach, she did not follow a traditional approach but instead focused on building a strong foundation of self-esteem and outside interests for her daughters. By encouraging them to pursue activities beyond tennis, Price helped her girls develop a well-rounded personality and a sense of purpose.\n\nPrice's approach to coaching was characterized by her emphasis on the importance of family and community. She played a vital role in creating a supportive environment that allowed her daughters to thrive, both on and off the court. Her dedication to their well-being and happiness was evident in the way she balanced her daughters' competing schedules, ensured they had time for friends and hobbies, and provided a stable and loving home life.\n\n## The Williams Sisters' Rise to Prominence\n\nVenus and Serena Williams, Oracene's two youngest daughters, have gone on to achieve unparalleled success in the world of professional tennis. Both have won numerous Grand Slam tournaments, held the number one ranking in the world, and have been recognized as two of the greatest tennis players of all time.\n\nTheir journey to the top was not without its challenges, however. The sisters faced numerous setbacks, including injuries, controversy, and personal struggles. Through it all, Oracene Price remained a constant source of support and encouragement, providing guidance and reassurance when her daughters needed it most.\n\n## Legacy and Impact\n\nOracene Price's legacy extends far beyond her role as the mother of two tennis superstars. She has inspired countless young athletes and parents with her dedication to her family and her commitment to helping her daughters achieve their dreams.\n\nThrough her own experiences and the lessons she has learned along the way, Price has shown the world that with hard work, perseverance, and a strong support system, anything is possible. Her story serves as a testament to the power of motherhood, the importance of family, and the enduring spirit of the human spirit.\n\nIn the end, Oracene Price's life has been a remarkable journey of love, loss, and triumph. Her influence will continue to be felt for generations to come, inspiring and motivating those around her to reach for their own dreams and aspirations.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Oracene_Price\" following this outline:\n\n\nBiography\nNicknamed \"Brandy\", Price was born in Saginaw, Michigan in 1952 Her father was an automotive worker from the Mississippi Delta [1] She graduated from Buena Vista High School in 1970 and from Western Michigan University [1] [2] She has three daughters from a previous marriage to Yusef Rasheed: Yetunde Price (1972–2003), [3] who was a former beauty salon owner and registered nurse; Lyndrea Price, a Web designer; and Isha Price, a lawyer After Rasheed's death, while working as a nurse, Oracene married Richard Williams and had two more daughters, Venus Williams and Serena Williams Both Venus and Serena are high-ranked professional tennis players who have won numerous Grand Slam tournaments She helped her husband as he began coaching Venus and Serena in tennis The Williams family moved to Florida on the offer of Rick Macci to coach their daughters for free [4] [5]\n\n\nCoaching\nPrice's coaching has arguably been overshadowed by her role as mother, but as a coach she has been called underappreciated [12] Price is not a coach in a traditional sense (though she did learn tennis herself to help teach her daughters the technical aspects of the game) and is instead credited, along with Richard  for helping to build a solid foundation of self-esteem and outside interests for her daughters [13]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Denmark_national_football_team", "content": "\nTeams\nApart from the men's senior A-level team, Denmark competes with a women's national team, and has teams at various youth levels for both men and women, most prominently the under-21 national team Historically, the A-level team competed in the Olympics until and including the 1988 tournament, whereafter Olympic games count as under-21 national games In addition to the A-level team and youth teams, Denmark also has a special league national team named Ligalandsholdet, with the best Danish footballers from the Nordic leagues The Ligalandsholdet was created in January 1983, and has played unofficial games for the national team during the winter break of the Nordic leagues every year since, save for 2005 and 2011 Sometimes the media also refer to Ligalandsholdet as Denmark's B-team, as the best Danish footballers selected for the A-team often play in leagues outside of the Nordic countries As such, the national team coach has on several occasions outlined the purpose of having unofficial matches played by Ligalandsholdet as an opportunity of testing new potential upcoming Danish players for the A-team.\n\n\nHistory\nOn 12 April 1896, Denmark XI defeated Podilatikos Syllogos Athinon, either 9–0 or 15–0, at the Neo Phaliron Velodrome in Athens in a demonstration game during the 1896 Olympic Games [5]\n\n\nAmateur years\nOn 12 April 1896, Denmark XI defeated Podilatikos Syllogos Athinon, either 9–0 or 15–0, at the Neo Phaliron Velodrome in Athens in a demonstration game during the 1896 Olympic Games [5]\n\n\nDanish Dynamite (1980–1990)\nIn the 1982 FIFA World Cup qualification, Denmark finished with four wins and four losses, including a 3–1 win against the eventual World Cup champions Italy, but Denmark failed to qualify for the final tournament Qualification for UEFA Euro 1984 saw Denmark defeat England at Wembley Stadium when Allan Simonsen converted a penalty kick for a 1–0 win Denmark qualified for their first international tournament since 1964, and the team was dubbed \"Danish Dynamite\" in a competition for the official Danish Euro 1984 song [9] Denmark's participation ended in the semi-final when the team lost on penalties to Spain, most remembered for Preben Elkjær's penalty miss, his shorts torn apart Following the strong performance at the finals, the name \"Danish Dynamite\" became a mainstay for the following decade of the Denmark national team under head coach Sepp Piontek [11]\n\n\nThe Møller Nielsen fairytale: 1992 European Championship\nDenmark began Euro 1992 qualification with a home victory against the Faroe Islands, and followed up with an away draw against Northern Ireland and a 2–0 home loss against Yugoslavia Danes Michael Laudrup and Brian Laudrup opted to quit the national team in November 1990 When Nielsen subsequently decided to dismiss quality players such as Jan Mølby and Jan Heintze from the squad due to disciplinary problems, several newspapers began demanding that Nielsen step down as head coach Despite this, Denmark won the rest of their five matches in the qualification group, including a 2–1 away win against Yugoslavia This was not enough to qualify, as the team still had to settle for second place in the group, behind Yugoslavia.\n\n\nDecline and revival (1993–2000)\nIn August 1993, Michael Laudrup decided to settle his ongoing dispute with Richard Møller Nielsen about the team tactics and made a comeback to the national team However, the following years Denmark saw mixed results, as they first failed to qualify for the 1994 World Cup, but then won the 1995 Confederations Cup (then known as King Fahd Cup), beating Copa América champions Argentina 2–0 in the final As defending champions at Euro 1996, Denmark disappointed with a lackluster performance after an early elimination in the group stage The team had achieved a respectable win against Turkey, a draw against Portugal and only a defeat to Croatia.\n\n\nThe Olsen Gang (2000–2015)\nMorten Olsen was named the new manager for Denmark in 2000 and the team was quickly dubbed the \"Olsen Gang\", a reference to the series of Danish movies based around the main character Egon Olsen and his genius (criminal) plans The nickname was also used for the Danish team as an alternative to the more commonly used \"Danish Dynamite\", already in those days when Olsen played as a captain Denmark's tactics shifted from the preferred 4–4–2 formation practised by Bo Johansson to an even more attacking style with an emphasis on the wingers available at the time, namely Jesper Grønkjær and Dennis Rommedahl [18] Accordingly, Olsen's preferred formation was either a 4–3–3 or a 4–2–3–1 [19] [20] Olsen even possessed an outspoken opposition to the 4–4–2 system, as he threatened to leave his position as head coach in the event he was asked to deploy Denmark in that formation [21] To support the development of players for the new tactical 4–3–3 system, all national youth teams also changed their formation [22] Another change Olsen brought to the national team was to stress the importance of only using fit players who had been granted regular playing time at their club However, at times he was forced to compromise from this principle, as the pool of players available in the relatively small nation did not always provide him viable substitute options.\n\n\nHareide era: 2016–2020\nNew coach Åge Hareide presided over the Danish campaign during the qualification stages [29] Denmark, ranked number 24 in the FIFA World Rankings at the time of the draw, were drawn into Group E, alongside Poland, Montenegro, Romania, Armenia, and Kazakhstan [30]\nDespite suffering early defeats to Poland and Montenegro, [31] [32] the Danes rallied, and secured second place in the group, and a berth in the play-offs, with a 1–0 away to Montenegro [33] Denmark were rewarded for their second-place finish with a play-off against the Republic of Ireland [34] Denmark secured qualification with a 5–1 win at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin, which included a hat-trick by Christian Eriksen, who added to his tally of eight goals in qualification [35]\n\n\nHjulmand era: 2020–2024\nAt UEFA Euro 2020, Denmark were beaten 1–0 by Finland; in a match marked by Christian Eriksen's heart attack in the 42nd minute [59] which led to the match being suspended for over two hours In the following match, Denmark lost their second match to Belgium 2–1, despite initially taking the lead They avoided elimination in the final round of

round of 16, Denmark won by a large margin (4–0) which earned them a quarter-final tie with the Czech Republic Denmark won the tie 2–1 to progress to the next round [60] Their European Championship run ended with an extra time defeat to England in the semi-finals [61] Mikkel Damsgaard opened the scoring with a sublime free-kick on the half-hour mark before England equalised and subsequently won in extra time Despite the elimination, Denmark's performance was widely praised by the sporting press, in particular for its resilience in overcoming the difficult situation caused by Eriksen's heart condition in the first group match, and for its high-quality teamwork and attacking play [60]\n\n\nTeam image\nApart from the national team, Denmark is famous for its traveling fans, known as roligans

Scotland They were collectively given the FIFA FairPlay Award at the 1984 European Championships [74] The term \"roligan\" was invented by the editors of the Danish newspaper B.T in 1985, and later

Forum Copenhagen later was built) [78] As the facilities were considered too small, a new stadium in Copenhagen was built with the name Idrætsparken Since its opening on 25 May 1911, it has hosted all the home matches of the football club KB and most of the home matches of the national team During the first 82 years of the national team, from October 1908 until November 1990, Denmark played a total

the Denmark national football team has changed throughout the history From 1908 to 1918, the DBU preferred to assign a manager with the overall responsibility This was followed by a long era from 1919 to 1956 where either no manager or only a caretaker manager was assigned When the DBU assigned Arne Sørensen (November 1956 – December 1961) and Poul Petersen (January 1962 –December 1966) as managers for a rolling period of several years, they were given the responsibility to coach the physical training and decide the team tactics before and during each match, but had no influence upon the selection of players for the national squad, which was a job for the specially-appointed selection committee, the UdtagelsesKomitéen [93]\n\n\nManager history\nThis is a complete overview of every

Football Association (DBU). The team's home stadium is Parken Stadium in Copenhagen, and their current head coach is Kasper Hjulmand.\n\n**Teams**\n\nApart from the men's senior A-level team, Denmark competes with a women's national team, and has teams at various youth levels for both men and women, most prominently the under-21 national team. Historically, the A-level team competed in the Olympics until and including the 1988 tournament, whereafter Olympic games count as under-21 national games.\n\nIn addition to the A-level team and youth teams, Denmark also has a special league national team named Ligalandsholdet, with the best Danish footballers from the Nordic leagues. The Ligalandsholdet was created in January 1983, and has played unofficial games for the national team during the winter break of the Nordic leagues every year since, save for 2005 and 2011. Sometimes the media also refer to Ligalandsholdet as Denmark's B-team, as the best Danish footballers selected for the A-team often play in leagues outside of the Nordic countries.\n\n**History**\n\nOn 12 April 1896, Denmark XI defeated Podilatikos Syllogos Athinon, either 9–0 or 15–0, at the Neo Phaliron Velodrome in Athens in a demonstration game during the 1896 Olympic Games.\n\n### Amateur years\n\nOn 12 April 1896, Denmark XI defeated Podilatikos Syllogos Athinon, either 9–0 or 15–0, at the Neo Phaliron Velodrome in Athens in a demonstration game during the 1896 Olympic Games.\n\n### Danish Dynamite (1980–1990)\n\nIn the 1982 FIFA World Cup qualification, Denmark finished with four wins and four losses, including a 3–1 win against the eventual World Cup champions Italy, but Denmark failed to qualify for the final tournament. Qualification for UEFA Euro 1984 saw Denmark defeat England at Wembley Stadium when Allan Simonsen converted a penalty kick for a 1–0 win. Denmark qualified for their first international tournament since 1964, and the team was dubbed \"Danish Dynamite\" in a competition for the official Danish Euro 1984 song. Denmark's participation ended in the semi-final when the team lost on penalties to Spain, most remembered for Preben Elkjær's penalty miss, his shorts torn apart.\n\nFollowing the strong performance at the finals, the name \"Danish Dynamite\" became a mainstay for the following decade of the Denmark national team under head coach Sepp Piontek.\n\n### The Møller Nielsen fairytale: 1992 European Championship\n\nDenmark began Euro 1992 qualification with a home victory against the Faroe Islands, and followed up with an away draw against Northern Ireland and a 2–0 home loss against Yugoslavia. Dansen Michael Laudrup and Brian Laudrup opted to quit the national team in November 1990. When Nielsen subsequently decided to dismiss quality players such as Jan Mølby and Jan Heintze from the squad due to disciplinary problems, several newspapers began demanding that Nielsen step down as head coach. Despite this, Denmark won the rest of their five matches in the qualification group, including a 2–1 away win against Yugoslavia. This was not enough to qualify, as the team still had to settle for second place in the group, behind Yugoslavia.\n\n### Decline and revival (1993–2000)\n\nIn August 1993, Michael Laudrup decided to settle his ongoing dispute with Richard Møller Nielsen about the team tactics and made a comeback to the national team. However, the following years Denmark saw mixed results, as they first failed to qualify for the 1994 World Cup, but then won the 1995 Confederations Cup (then known as King Fahd Cup), beating Copa América champions Argentina 2–0 in the final. As defending champions at Euro 1996, Denmark disappointed with a lackluster performance after an early elimination in the group stage. The team had achieved a respectable win against Turkey, a draw against Portugal and only a defeat to Croatia.\n\n### The Olsen Gang (2000–2015)\n\nMorten Olsen was named the new manager for Denmark in 2000 and the team was quickly dubbed the \"Olsen Gang\", a reference to the series of Danish movies based around the main character Egon Olsen and his genius (criminal) plans. The nickname was also used for the Danish team as an alternative to the more commonly used \"Danish Dynamite\", already in those days when Olsen played as a captain. Denmark's tactics shifted from the preferred 4–4–2 formation practised by Bo Johansson to an even more attacking style with an emphasis on the wingers available at the time, namely Jesper Grønkjær and Dennis Rommedahl. Accordingly, Olsen's preferred formation was either a 4–3–3 or a 4–2–3–1. Olsen even possessed an outspoken opposition to the 4–4–2 system, as he threatened to leave his position as head coach in the event he was asked to deploy Denmark in that formation. To support the development of players for the new tactical 4–3–3 system, all national youth teams also changed their formation. Another change Olsen brought to the national team was to stress the importance of only using fit players who had been granted regular playing time at their club. However, at times he was forced to compromise from this principle, as the pool of players available in the relatively small nation did not always provide him viable substitute options.\n\n### Hareide era: 2016–2020\n\nNew coach Åge Hareide presided over the Danish campaign during the qualification stages. Denmark, ranked number 24 in the FIFA World Rankings at the time of the draw, were drawn into Group E, alongside Poland, Montenegro, Romania, Armenia, and Kazakhstan. Despite suffering early defeats to Poland and Montenegro, the Danes rallied, and secured second place in the group, and a berth in the play-offs, with a 1–0 away to Montenegro. Denmark were rewarded for their second-place finish with a play-off against the Republic of Ireland. Denmark secured qualification with a 5–1 win at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin, which included a hat-trick by Christian Eriksen, who added to his tally of eight goals in qualification.\n\n### Hjulmand era: 2020–2024\n\nAt UEFA Euro 2020, Denmark were beaten 1–0 by Finland; in a match marked by Christian Eriksen's heart attack in the 42nd minute, which led to the match being suspended for over two hours. In the following match, Denmark lost their second match to Belgium 2–1, despite initially taking the lead. They avoided elimination in the final round of matches with an impressive 4–1 victory against Russia. They therefore became the first team to qualify for the knockout phase of a European Championship despite two opening defeats. Facing Wales in the round of 16, Denmark won by a large margin (4–0) which earned them a quarter-final tie with the Czech Republic. Denmark won the tie 2–1 to progress to the next round. Their European Championship run ended with an extra time defeat to England in the semi-finals. Mikkel Damsgaard opened the scoring with a sublime free-kick on the half-hour mark before England equalised and subsequently won in extra time. Despite the elimination, Denmark's performance was widely praised by the sporting press, in particular for its resilience in overcoming the difficult situation caused by Eriksen's heart condition in the first group match, and for its high-quality teamwork and attacking play.\n\n**Team image**\n\nApart from the national team, Denmark is famous for its traveling fans, known as roligans. The movement emerged during the 1980s as the declared opposition to hooliganism. The goal of the roligan movement is calm, yet cheerful, support during the matches, as \"rolig\" means \"calm\" in the Danish language. The roligans have since developed an image of easy-going nature and rabid support, and are often considered amongst the world's best national team fans, along with the Tartan Army of Scotland. They were collectively given the FIFA FairPlay Award at the 1984 European Championships. The term \"roligan\" was invented by the editors of the Danish newspaper B.T in 1985, and later included in the Danish dictionary. Just before the 1986 World Cup, the roligan movement was organized in order to support the national team at the tournament.\n\n**Rivalry**\n\nDenmark's main rival is Sweden. The countries have played against each other 107 times, of which Denmark have won 40, drawn 20 and lost 47. The first match between the teams was an 8–0 Denmark win in May 1913. Denmark won their first five matches against Sweden before their first defeat in October 1916, 4–0.\n\n**Kit**\n\nThe team kit is produced by Danish company Hummel. It is all-red with white details to reflect the colours of the Danish national flag.

of the Nordic leagues every year since, save for 2005 and 2011 Sometimes the media also refer to Ligalandsholdet as Denmark's B-team, as the best Danish footballers selected for the A-team often play in leagues outside of the Nordic countries As such, the national team coach has on several occasions outlined the purpose of having unofficial matches played by Ligalandsholdet as an opportunity of testing new potential upcoming Danish players for the A-team.\n\n\nHistory\nOn 12 April 1896, Denmark XI defeated Podilatikos Syllogos Athinon, either 9–0 or 15–0, at the Neo Phaliron Velodrome in Athens in a demonstration game during the 1896 Olympic Games [5]\n\n\nAmateur years\nOn 12 April 1896, Denmark XI defeated Podilatikos Syllogos Athinon, either 9–0 or 15–0, at the Neo Phaliron Velodrome in Athens in a demonstration game during the 1896 Olympic Games [5]\n\n\nDanish Dynamite (1980–1990)\nIn the 1982 FIFA World Cup qualification, Denmark finished with four wins and four losses, including a 3–1 win against the eventual World Cup champions Italy, but Denmark failed to qualify for the final tournament Qualification for UEFA Euro 1984 saw Denmark defeat England at Wembley Stadium when Allan Simonsen converted a penalty kick for a 1–0 win Denmark qualified for their first international tournament since 1964, and the team was dubbed \"Danish Dynamite\" in a competition for the official Danish Euro 1984 song [9] Denmark's participation ended in the semi-final when the team lost on penalties to Spain, most remembered for Preben Elkjær's penalty miss, his shorts torn apart Following the strong performance at the finals, the name \"Danish Dynamite\" became a mainstay for the following decade of the Denmark national team under head coach Sepp Piontek [11]\n\n\nThe Møller Nielsen fairytale: 1992 European Championship\nDenmark began Euro 1992 qualification with a home victory against the Faroe Islands, and followed up with an away draw against Northern Ireland and a 2–0 home loss against Yugoslavia Danes Michael Laudrup and Brian Laudrup opted to quit the national team in November 1990 When Nielsen subsequently decided to dismiss quality players such as Jan Mølby and Jan Heintze from the squad due to disciplinary problems, several newspapers began demanding that Nielsen step down as head coach Despite this, Denmark won the rest of their five matches in the qualification group, including a 2–1 away win against Yugoslavia This was not enough to qualify, as the team still had to settle for second place in the group, behind Yugoslavia.\n\n\nDecline and revival (1993–2000)\nIn August 1993, Michael Laudrup decided to settle his ongoing dispute with Richard Møller Nielsen about the team tactics and made a comeback to the national team However, the following years Denmark saw mixed results, as they first failed to qualify for the 1994 World Cup, but then won the 1995 Confederations Cup (then known as King Fahd Cup), beating Copa América champions Argentina 2–0 in the final As defending champions at Euro 1996, Denmark disappointed with a lackluster performance after an early elimination in the group stage The team had achieved a respectable win against Turkey, a draw against Portugal and only a defeat to Croatia.\n\n\nThe Olsen Gang (2000–2015)\nMorten Olsen was named the new manager for Denmark in 2000 and the team was quickly dubbed the \"Olsen Gang\", a reference to the series of Danish movies based around the main character Egon Olsen and his genius (criminal) plans The nickname was also used for the Danish team as an alternative to the more commonly used \"Danish Dynamite\", already in those days when Olsen played as a captain Denmark's tactics shifted from the preferred 4–4–2 formation practised by Bo Johansson to an even more attacking style with an emphasis on the wingers available at the time, namely Jesper Grønkjær and Dennis Rommedahl [18] Accordingly, Olsen's preferred formation was either a 4–3–3 or a 4–2–3–1 [19] [20] Olsen even possessed an outspoken opposition to the 4–4–2 system, as he threatened to leave his position as head coach in the event he was asked to deploy Denmark in that formation [21] To support the development of players for the new tactical 4–3–3 system, all national youth teams also changed their formation [22] Another change Olsen brought to the national team was to stress the importance of only using fit players who had been granted regular playing time at their club However, at times he was forced to compromise from this principle, as the pool of players available in the relatively small nation did not always provide him viable substitute options.\n\n\nHareide era: 2016–2020\nNew coach Åge Hareide presided over the Danish campaign during the qualification stages [29] Denmark, ranked number 24 in the FIFA World Rankings at the time of the draw, were drawn into Group E, alongside Poland, Montenegro, Romania, Armenia, and Kazakhstan [30]\nDespite suffering early defeats to Poland and Montenegro, [31] [32] the Danes rallied, and secured second place in the group, and a berth in the play-offs, with a 1–0 away to Montenegro [33] Denmark were rewarded for their second-place finish with a play-off against the Republic of Ireland [34] Denmark secured qualification with a 5–1 win at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin, which included a hat-trick by Christian Eriksen, who added to his tally of eight goals in qualification [35]\n\n\nHjulmand era: 2020–2024\nAt UEFA Euro 2020, Denmark were beaten 1–0 by Finland; in a match marked by Christian Eriksen's heart attack in the 42nd minute [59] which led to the match being suspended for over two hours In the following match, Denmark lost their second match to Belgium 2–1, despite initially taking the lead They avoided elimination in the final round of matches with an impressive 4–1 victory against Russia They therefore became the first team to qualify for the knockout phase of a European Championship despite two opening defeats Facing Wales in the round of 16, Denmark won by a large margin (4–0) which earned them a quarter-final tie with the Czech Republic Denmark won the tie 2–1 to progress to the next round [60] Their European Championship run ended with an extra time defeat to England in the semi-finals [61] Mikkel Damsgaard opened the scoring with a sublime free-kick on the half-hour mark before England equalised and subsequently won in extra time Despite the elimination, Denmark's performance was widely praised by the sporting press, in particular for its resilience in overcoming the difficult situation caused by Eriksen's heart condition in the first group match, and for its high-quality teamwork and attacking play [60]\n\n\nTeam image\nApart from the national team, Denmark is famous for its traveling fans, known as roligans The movement emerged during the 1980s as the declared opposition to hooliganism The goal of the roligan movement is calm, yet cheerful, support during the matches, as \"rolig\" means \"calm\" in the Danish language The roligans have since developed an image of easy-going nature and rabid support, and are often considered amongst the world's best national team fans, along with the Tartan Army of Scotland They were collectively given the FIFA FairPlay Award at the 1984 European Championships [74] The term \"roligan\" was invented by the editors of the Danish newspaper B.T in 1985, and later included in the Danish dictionary [75] Just before the 1986 World Cup, the roligan movement was organized in order to support the national team at the tournament.\n\n\nSupporters\nApart from the national team, Denmark is famous for its traveling fans, known as roligans The movement emerged during the 1980s as the declared

each other 107 times, of which Denmark have won 40, drawn 20 and lost 47 The first match between the teams was an 8–0 Denmark win in May 1913 Denmark won their first five matches against Sweden before their first defeat in October 1916, 4–0.\n\n\nKit\nThe team kit is produced by Danish company Hummel It is all-red with white details to reflect the colours of the Danish national flag Prior to the

spectators at the stadium \"KBs baner\" (located in the area \"Granen\", where the Forum Copenhagen later was built) [78] As the facilities were considered too small, a new stadium in Copenhagen was built with the name Idrætsparken Since its opening on 25 May 1911, it has hosted all the home matches of the football club KB and most of the home matches of the national team During the first 82 years of the national team, from October 1908 until November 1990, Denmark played a total number of 254 A-level home matches, of which 232 were played in Idrætsparken Among all the played home matches in Idrætsparken, Denmark achieved 125 victories (54%), 41 draws (18%) and 66 defeats (28%) The stadium reached a record of 51,600 spectators for the 1–2 game against Sweden in June 1957

assign a manager with the overall responsibility This was followed by a long era from 1919 to 1956 where either no manager or only a caretaker manager was assigned When the DBU assigned Arne Sørensen (November 1956 – December 1961) and Poul Petersen (January 1962 –December 1966) as managers for a rolling period of several years, they were given the responsibility to coach the physical training and decide the team tactics before and during each match, but had no influence upon the selection of players for the national squad, which was a job for the specially-appointed selection committee, the UdtagelsesKomitéen [93]\n\n\nManager history\nThis is a complete overview of every national team manager since the first official game in October 1908 From 1911 to 1961, a total of 169 games were played without a designated manager.\n\n\nManager records\nThe following 23 players were selected for the UEFA Nations League matches on 15 and 18 November 2024 against  Spain and  Serbia,

players are freely chosen by the national team manager They are normally assembled from their respective club teams at the Hotel Marienlyst in Elsinore for a week-long training camp preluding the upcoming match Friendly matches are typically played on a Wednesday evening World Cup qualifiers are played on both Saturday and Wednesday evenings, while Euro qualifiers now take place on both a Friday and Tuesday evening when playing two matches in a row, or on a Friday/Saturday/Tuesday at rounds with only one match scheduled [94] [95]\n\n\nBest players of all time\nIn November 2006, the DBU nominated eight Denmark national team footballers for the \"Best Danish Footballer of All Time\" award The nominated players were Morten Olsen, Henning Jensen, Allan Simonsen, Preben Elkjær, Michael Laudrup, Brian Laudrup, Peter Schmeichel and Jon Dahl Tomasson The winner of the award was decided by a public vote arranged by the broadcasting channel TV2, which ended with Michael Laudrup as a clear winner, with 58% of the votes [96]\n\n\nHall of Fame\nDenmark's Hall of Fame was established in October 2008, as a special award to celebrate the best footballers, teams and coaches; throughout the history of the national team A jury with six people (representing the newspapers, authors of football books, active players of the national team, TV2, the DBU, and a Hall of Fame member), each year has the job to award one or two new members for the Hall of Fame The award is handed out at the official Danish Football Awards, which is a yearly television broadcast event – organized by the DBU in November throughout 2008 to 2013 and subsequently moved to a later date in February Besides receiving the award, all Hall of Fame members are also invited to leave a footprint in bronze, to decorate the entrance hall at \"Fodboldens hus\" -the DBU headquarters in Brøndby [97] When the DBU celebrated its 125-year anniversary in May 2014, it decided to make an extraordinary award of nine additional Hall of Fame Members, all playing during the first half of the DBU national team's existence, from 1908 to 1964 [98] Because of financial restraints, the DBU cancelled the planned televised broadcast of the Football Award in February 2015, and for the same reason opted not to award any new Hall of Fame members in this specific year The DBU expected to return awarding new Hall of Fame members again, when the next broadcast Football Award event was organized in February 2016 [99]\n\n\nHall of Fame members\nSorted by last year appearing in the national football team.\n\n\nPayment\nEach national team player receives a set amount of money per match, including bonuses for a win and qualification for European Championship and World Cup tournaments Throughout the

American author Stephenie Meyer. The series includes Twilight (2008), The Twilight Saga: New Moon (2009), The Twilight Saga: Eclipse (2010), The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1 (2011), and The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2 (2012). The films were directed by Catherine Hardwicke, Chris Weitz, David Slade, and Bill Condon, and were written by Melissa Rosenberg.\n\n## Development\n\nThe Twilight Saga began development in 2003, when Paramount Pictures' MTV Films acquired the rights to Stephenie Meyer's novel Twilight. At the time, Meyer was concerned that the film adaptation would deviate too far from the original novel, and there were concerns that the film's script was too different from the book. However, Meyer eventually sold the film rights to the studio, and production on the first film began in 2007.\n\n## Casting\n\nThe casting process for the Twilight Saga films was a long and arduous one. Kristen Stewart was on the set of Adventureland when director Catherine Hardwicke visited her for an informal screen test, which \"captivated\" the director. Hardwicke did not initially choose Robert Pattinson for the role of Edward Cullen, but after an audition at her home with Stewart, he was selected. Pattinson, however, did not enjoy playing his assigned character, Edward Cullen. Meyer allowed Pattinson to view a manuscript of the unfinished Midnight Sun, which chronicles the events in Twilight from Edward's point of view.\n\n## Production\n\nPrincipal photography for Twilight took 44 days, after more than a week of rehearsals, and completed on May 2, 2008. Similar to her directorial debut Thirteen, Hardwicke opted for an extensive use of hand-held cinematography to make the film \"feel real.\" Meyer visited the production set three times and was consulted on different aspects of the story. She also has a brief cameo in the film. To make their bodily movements more elegant, and to get used to their characters' fighting styles, the cast playing vampires participated in rehearsals with a dance choreographer and observed the physicality of different panthera. Instead of shooting at Forks High School itself, scenes taking place at the school were filmed at Kalama High School and Madison High School. Other scenes were also filmed in St Helens, Oregon, and Hardwicke conducted some reshooting in Pasadena, California, in August.\n\n## Films\n\nThe Twilight Saga consists of five films, each based on one of the novels by Stephenie Meyer.\n\n### Twilight (2008)\n\nTwilight was directed by Catherine Hardwicke and written by Melissa Rosenberg. The film focuses on the development of a personal relationship between teenager Bella Swan and vampire Edward Cullen, and the subsequent efforts of Edward and his family to keep Bella safe from a separate group of hostile vampires. Edward refuses to grant Bella's request to transform her into a vampire so that they can be together forever, arguing that she should have a normal human life.\n\n### The Twilight Saga: New Moon (2009)\n\nThe Twilight Saga: New Moon was directed by Chris Weitz and written by Melissa Rosenberg. The film follows the Cullens' departure from Forks, and Bella Swan's fall into a deep depression. This depression persists until Bella develops a strong friendship with Jacob Black. She consequently discovers that Jacob has unwillingly become a werewolf. Jacob and his tribe must protect Bella from Victoria, and a gregarious herd of vampires. Edward tells Bella that he will change her into a vampire if she agrees to marry him.\n\n### The Twilight Saga: Eclipse (2010)\n\nThe Twilight Saga: Eclipse was directed by David Slade and written by Melissa Rosenberg. The film follows Bella Swan as she develops awareness of the possible complications of marrying a vampire. Jacob Black and the rest of the wolves form a temporary alliance with the Cullens to battle Victoria and her army of newborn vampires to keep Bella safe. Jacob unsuccessfully tries to convince Bella to leave Edward and be with him instead. Edward proposes to Bella and she accepts it.\n\n### The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1 (2011)\n\nThe Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1 was directed by Bill Condon, and author Stephenie Meyer co-produced the film along with Karen Rosenfelt and Wyck Godfrey. The script was written by Melissa Rosenberg. The book's plot was split into two films, the first of which was released on November 18, 2011. The filming of Breaking Dawn began in November 2010.\n\n### The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2 (2012)\n\nThe Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2 was released on November 16, 2012. The second part of Breaking Dawn sees the climax of Bella and Edward's relationship. Bella must learn, as a newly transformed vampire, to use her special shield powers, as well as protect her half-human half-vampire daughter, Renesmee. The film also shows the final battle between The Cullens, along with vampires from the Denali Clan, and other vampire friends, as well as the wolves from the Quileute Tribe, against The Volturi.\n\n## Soundtracks\n\nThe soundtracks for the Twilight Saga films were chosen by music supervisor Alexandra Patsavas.

The conflict has been marked by periods of relative calm punctuated by outbreaks of violence, including rocket attacks and airstrikes.\n\n**Initial attacks**\n\nThe Israel–Hamas war began in December 2008, when Israel launched a military operation in the Gaza Strip, which it had occupied since 1967. The operation, known as Operation Cast Lead, was launched in response to a significant increase in rocket attacks by Hamas against Israeli towns and cities.\n\nThe Israeli military had been building up forces along the Gaza border for several days prior to the launch of the operation. On December 27, 2008, Israeli forces launched a series of airstrikes against Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip, including rocket launch sites, command centers, and military installations. The airstrikes were followed by a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip, which began on December 27, 2008.\n\n**Invasion of the Gaza Strip**\n\nThe Israeli military invasion of the Gaza Strip was a major escalation of the conflict between Israel and Hamas. The invasion was characterized by significant violence and destruction, with the Israeli military using a combination of artillery, tank fire, and air power to attack Hamas targets.\n\nThe Israeli military also imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip, restricting the movement of people and goods into and out of the territory. The blockade was implemented in an effort to weaken Hamas and prevent it from receiving military supplies and funding.\n\nDuring the invasion, the Israeli military targeted Hamas militants, as well as civilians who were accused of supporting the organization. The Israeli military also destroyed infrastructure, including homes, schools, and hospitals.\n\nThe invasion of the Gaza Strip lasted for three weeks, ending on January 18, 2009. During this period, the Israeli military reported that it had killed over 1,000 Hamas militants, while Hamas reported that over 1,400 Palestinians had been killed.\n\n**First ceasefire**\n\nOn January 18, 2009, Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire, which was brokered by Egypt. The ceasefire was intended to bring an end to the violence between Israel and Hamas, and to allow for the delivery of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe ceasefire was widely observed, with both sides reporting a significant decrease in violence. However, the ceasefire was also criticized for not addressing the underlying issues that had led to the conflict, including the Israeli blockade and the displacement of Palestinians.\n\n**Yemen airstrikes**\n\nIn August 2009, Israel launched a series of airstrikes against Hamas targets in Yemen, which was believed to be a key transit point for Hamas militants and supplies. The airstrikes were intended to weaken Hamas and prevent it from receiving military supplies and funding.\n\nThe airstrikes were widely condemned, with many countries calling for restraint and a return to the ceasefire. The airstrikes also led to a significant increase in tensions between Israel and Yemen, which had previously been a key ally of the United States in the region.\n\n**Rafah offensive**\n\nIn January 2010, Israeli forces launched a series of airstrikes against Hamas targets in the Rafah refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. The airstrikes were intended to weaken Hamas and prevent it from launching rocket attacks against Israeli towns and cities.\n\nThe airstrikes were widely condemned, with many countries calling for restraint and a return to the ceasefire. The airstrikes also led to a significant increase in tensions between Israel and Hamas, which had previously agreed to a ceasefire.\n\n**Al-Mawasi attack**\n\nIn January 2010, Israeli forces launched a series of airstrikes against Hamas targets in the Al-Mawasi area of the Gaza Strip. The airstrikes were intended to weaken Hamas and prevent it from launching rocket attacks against Israeli towns and cities.\n\nThe airstrikes were widely condemned, with many countries calling for restraint and a return to the ceasefire.

Growing up in a close-knit family, Peña's early life was marked by a strong sense of discipline and athleticism. She graduated from Mt.

Her early life was marked by a strong sense of determination and resilience, traits that would serve her well in her future endeavors.\n\n## Early Career\n\nPeña's introduction to mixed martial arts (MMA) came at a young age, when she enrolled in a cardio kickboxing class. The physicality and discipline of the sport quickly captivated her, and she soon transitioned to MMA training. After going 2-0 as an amateur, Peña made her professional MMA debut in May 2009.

The injury, which involved damage to her ACL, MCL, LCL, and meniscus, required surgery and a lengthy rehabilitation period. Despite the setbacks, Peña persevered and eventually returned to competition, showcasing her resilience and determination.\n\n## Film and Television\n\nPeña has made appearances in various films and television shows, including the award-winning mixed martial arts documentary Fight Life. The film, directed by James Z Feng, provides an intimate look at the lives of MMA fighters and their families. Peña's appearance in the documentary offers a candid glimpse into her own life and career, showcasing her struggles and triumphs as a professional fighter.\n\n## Personal Life\n\nJulianna Peña is the younger sister of former KREM 2 reporter and morning/noon meteorologist Grace Peña. The two sisters share a close bond and have appeared together in various public events. Peña's personal life is marked by a strong sense of family and community, reflecting her Mexican and Venezuelan heritage.\n\n## Legal Issues\n\nIn 2015, Peña was arrested in Spokane, Washington, and charged with two counts of assault. The incident occurred after an altercation with bar staff following an earlier street fight involving her training partner, Josh Gow. A stipulation order of continuance was later granted, allowing Peña to avoid prosecution if she had no further incidents for a year.\n\n## Championships and Accomplishments\n\n## Mixed Martial Arts\n\n## Mixed Martial Arts Record\n\n## Pay-Per-View Bouts", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Julianna_Peña\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nThe youngest of four siblings, Julianna was born and raised in Spokane, Washington [5] Julianna graduated in 2007 from Mt Spokane High School [7] She then attended Spokane Community College [8] In order to lose weight and channel aggression in her early adulthood, she enrolled in a cardio kickboxing class and subsequently transitioned to mixed martial arts [5]\n\n\nMixed martial arts career\nAfter going 2–0 as an amateur, Peña made her professional MMA debut in May 2009 [9] She won four consecutive fights but suffered her first defeat in April 2012 to future fellow The Ultimate Fighter 18 cast member Sarah Moras in a 140-pound catchweight bout [10]  The fight took place just two months and one week after Peña was involved in an accident with a drunk driver while walking in downtown Spokane in which she was knocked unconscious and suffered a broken nose [11] [9]  Ten months later she returned to professional competition in a fight in the flyweight division, a move down from the bantamweight division, losing by unanimous decision.\n\n\nEarly career\nAfter going 2–0 as an amateur, Peña made her professional MMA debut in May 2009 [9] She won four consecutive fights but suffered her first defeat in April 2012 to future fellow The Ultimate Fighter 18 cast member Sarah Moras in a 140-pound catchweight bout [10]  The fight took place just two months and one week after Peña was involved in an accident with a drunk driver while walking in downtown Spokane in which she was knocked unconscious and suffered a broken nose [11] [9]  Ten months later she returned to professional competition in a fight in the flyweight division, a move down from the bantamweight division, losing by unanimous decision.\n\n\nThe Ultimate Fighter\nIn August 2013, it was announced that Peña was one of the fighters selected to be on The Ultimate Fighter: Team Rousey vs Team Tate [12]\n\n\nUltimate Fighting Championship\nPeña faced Jessica Rakoczy in the finals on November 30, 2013, at The Ultimate Fighter 18 Finale She won the bout via TKO in the final seconds of the first round and became TUF 18 women's bantamweight champion [17]\n\n\nInjury\nPeña was expected to face Jessica Andrade at UFC 171 on March 15, 2014 [18] However, Peña pulled out of the bout after suffering an injury to her right knee  She suffered the injury while grappling in training, ultimately damaging, among other aspects, her ACL, MCL, LCL and meniscus Despite the severity of the injury, doctors assured Peña that her right knee would return to full strength following surgery and rehabilitation [19] The injury kept Peña out of action for the rest of 2014 [20]\n\n\nUFC return\nPeña returned to face Milana Dudieva on April 4, 2015, at UFC Fight Night 63 She won the fight via TKO in the first round  The win also earned Peña her first Performance of the Night bonus award [21]\n\n\nBantamweight champion\nPeña was expected to face Amanda Nunes for the UFC Women's Bantamweight Championship on August 7, 2021, at UFC 265 [41] However Nunes tested positive for COVID-19 on July 29, 2021 [42] [43] The bout was rescheduled to UFC 269 on December 11, 2021 [44] After a dominant round one from Nunes, Peña came back in the second to win the bout and championship by rear-naked choke submission in what is regarded as one of the biggest upsets in UFC history [45] [46] [47] [48]\n\n\nFilm and television\nPeña was featured in the award-winning mixed martial arts documentary Fight Life, the film is directed by James Z Feng and was released in 2012 [57]\n\n\nPersonal life\nJulianna is the younger sister of former KREM 2 reporter and morning/noon meteorologist Grace Peña [59] Peña is of Mexican and Venezuelan descent [60]\n\n\nLegal issues\nOn  December 20, 2015, Peña was arrested in Spokane, Washington and charged with two counts of assault due to an altercation with bar staff following an earlier street fight in which Josh Gow, her training partner on the Sikjitsu fight team, had been injured A judge later granted a stipulation order of continuance in her case such that if Peña had no other incidents for a year, the case would be dismissed [62]\n\n\nChampionships and accomplishments\n [80]\n\n\nMixed martial arts\n [80]\n\n\nMixed martial arts record\n [80]\n\n\nPay-per-view bouts\n\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Rolihlahla, [a] a Xhosa term colloquially meaning \"troublemaker\", [5] and in later years became known by his clan name, Madiba [6] His patrilineal great-grandfather, Ngubengcuka, was ruler of the Thembu Kingdom in the Transkeian Territories of South Africa's modern Eastern Cape province [7] One of Ngubengcuka's sons, named Mandela, was Nelson's grandfather and the source of his surname [8]

throne but recognised as hereditary royal councillors [9]\n\n\nChildhood: 1918–1934\nMandela was born on 18 July 1918, in the village of Mvezo in Umtata, then part of South Africa's Cape Province [2] He was given the forename Rolihlahla, [a] a Xhosa term colloquially meaning \"troublemaker\", [5] and in later years became known by his clan name, Madiba [6] His patrilineal great-grandfather, Ngubengcuka, was ruler of the Thembu Kingdom in the Transkeian Territories of South Africa's modern Eastern Cape province [7] One of Ngubengcuka's sons, named Mandela, was Nelson's grandfather and the source of his surname [8] Because Mandela was the king's child by a wife of the Ixhiba clan, a so-called \"Left-Hand House\", the descendants of his cadet branch of the royal family were morganatic, ineligible to inherit the throne but recognised as hereditary royal councillors [9]\n\n\nClarkebury, Healdtown, and Fort Hare: 1934–1940\nIntending to gain skills needed to become a privy councillor for the Thembu royal house, Mandela began his secondary education in 1933 at Clarkebury Methodist High School in Engcobo, a Western-style institution that was the largest school for black Africans in Thembuland [26] Made to socialise with other students on an equal basis, he claimed that he lost his \"stuck up\" attitude, becoming best friends with a girl for the first time; he began playing sports and developed his lifelong love of gardening [27] He completed his Junior Certificate in two years, [28] and in 1937 he moved to Healdtown, the Methodist college in Fort Beaufort attended by most Thembu royalty, including Justice [29] The headmaster emphasised the superiority of European culture and government, but Mandela became increasingly interested in native African culture, making his first non-Xhosa friend, a speaker of Sotho, and coming under the influence of one of his favourite teachers, a Xhosa who broke taboo by marrying a Sotho [30] Mandela spent much of his spare time at Healdtown as a long-distance runner and boxer, and in his second year he became a prefect [31]\n\n\nArriving in Johannesburg: 1941–1943\nReturning to Mqhekezweni in December 1940, Mandela found that Jongintaba had arranged marriages for him and Justice; dismayed, they fled to Johannesburg via Queenstown, arriving in April 1941 [40] Mandela found work as a night watchman at Crown Mines, his \"first sight of South African capitalism in action\", but was fired when the induna (headman) discovered that he was a runaway [41] He stayed with a cousin in George Goch Township, who introduced Mandela to realtor and ANC activist Walter Sisulu The latter secured Mandela a job as an articled clerk at the law firm of Witkin, Sidelsky and Eidelman, a company run by Lazar Sidelsky, a liberal Jew sympathetic to the ANC's cause [42] At the firm, Mandela befriended Gaur Radebe—a Hlubi member of the ANC and Communist Party—and Nat Bregman, a Jewish communist who became his first white friend [43] Mandela attended Communist Party gatherings, where he was impressed that Europeans, Africans, Indians, and Coloureds mixed as equals He later stated that he did not join the party because its atheism conflicted with his Christian faith, and because he saw the South African struggle as being racially based rather than as class warfare [44] To continue his higher education, Mandela signed up to a University of South Africa correspondence course, working on his bachelor's degree at night [45]\n\n\nEarly revolutionary activity\nMandela began studying law at the University of the Witwatersrand, where he was the only black African student and faced racism There, he befriended liberal and communist European, Jewish and Indian students, among them Joe Slovo and Ruth First [51] Becoming increasingly politicised, Mandela marched in August 1943 in support of a successful bus boycott to reverse fare rises [52] Joining the ANC, he was increasingly influenced by Sisulu, spending time with other activists at Sisulu's Orlando house, including his old friend Oliver Tambo [53] In 1943, Mandela met Anton Lembede, an ANC member affiliated with the \"Africanist\" branch of African nationalism, which was virulently opposed to a racially united front against colonialism and imperialism or to an alliance with the communists [54] Despite his friendships with non-blacks and communists, Mandela embraced Lembede's views, believing that black Africans should be entirely independent in their struggle for political self-determination [55] Deciding on the need for a youth wing to mass-mobilise Africans in opposition to their subjugation, Mandela was among a delegation that approached ANC president Alfred Bitini Xuma on the subject at his home in Sophiatown; the African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) was founded on Easter Sunday 1944 in the Bantu Men's Social Centre, with Lembede as president and Mandela as a member of its executive committee [56]\n\n\nLaw studies and the ANC Youth League: 1943–1949\nMandela began studying law at the University of the Witwatersrand, where he was the only black African student and faced racism There, he befriended liberal and communist European, Jewish and Indian students, among them Joe Slovo and Ruth First [51] Becoming increasingly politicised, Mandela marched in August 1943 in support of a successful bus boycott to reverse fare rises [52] Joining the ANC, he was increasingly influenced by Sisulu, spending time with other activists at Sisulu's Orlando house, including his old friend Oliver Tambo [53] In 1943, Mandela met Anton Lembede, an ANC member affiliated with the \"Africanist\" branch of African nationalism, which was virulently opposed to a racially united front against colonialism and

Social Centre, with Lembede as president and Mandela as a member of its executive committee [56]\n\n\nDefiance Campaign and Transvaal ANC Presidency: 1950–1954\nMandela took Xuma's place on the ANC national executive in March 1950, [70] and that same year was elected national president of the ANCYL [71] In March, the Defend Free Speech Convention was held in Johannesburg, bringing together African, Indian and communist activists to call a May Day general strike in protest against apartheid and white minority rule Mandela opposed the strike because it was multi-racial and not ANC-led, but a majority of black workers took part, resulting in increased police repression and the introduction of the Suppression of Communism Act, 1950, affecting the actions of all protest groups [72] At the ANC national conference of December 1951, he continued arguing against a racially united front, but was outvoted [73]\n\n\nCongress of the People and the Treason Trial: 1955–1961\nWe, the people of South Africa, declare for all our country and the world to know:That South Africa belongs to all who live in it, black and white, and that no government can justly claim authority unless it is based on the will of the people.\n\n\nMK, the SACP, and African tour: 1961–62\nDisguised as a chauffeur, Mandela travelled around the country incognito, organising the ANC's new cell structure and the planned mass stay-at-home strike Referred to as the \"Black Pimpernel\" in the press—a reference to Emma Orczy's 1905 novel The Scarlet Pimpernel—a warrant for his arrest was put out by the police [112] Mandela held secret meetings with reporters, and after the government failed to prevent the strike, he warned them that many anti-apartheid activists would soon resort to violence through groups like the PAC's Poqo [113] He believed that the ANC should form an armed group to channel some of this violence in a controlled direction, convincing both ANC leader Albert Luthuli—who was morally opposed to violence—and allied activist groups of its necessity [114]\n\n\nImprisonment\nOn 5 August 1962, police captured Mandela along with fellow activist Cecil Williams near Howick [130] Many MK members suspected that the authorities had been tipped off with regard to Mandela's whereabouts, although Mandela himself gave these ideas little credence [131] In later years, Donald Rickard, a former American diplomat, revealed that the Central Intelligence Agency, which feared Mandela's associations with communists, had informed the South African police of his location [132] [133] Jailed in Johannesburg's Marshall Square prison, Mandela was charged with inciting workers' strikes and leaving the country without permission Representing himself with Slovo as legal advisor, Mandela intended to use the trial to showcase \"the ANC's moral opposition to racism\" while supporters demonstrated outside the court [134] Moved to Pretoria, where Winnie could visit him, he began correspondence studies for a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) degree from the University of London International Programmes [135] His hearing began in October, but he disrupted proceedings by wearing a traditional kaross, refusing to call any witnesses, and turning his plea of mitigation into a political speech Found guilty, he was sentenced to five years' imprisonment; as he left the courtroom, supporters sang \"Nkosi Sikelel iAfrika\" [136]\n\n\nArrest and Rivonia trial: 1962–1964\nOn 5 August 1962, police captured Mandela along with fellow activist Cecil Williams near Howick [130] Many MK members suspected that the authorities had been tipped off with regard to Mandela's whereabouts, although Mandela himself gave these ideas little credence [131] In later years, Donald Rickard, a former American diplomat, revealed that the Central Intelligence Agency, which feared Mandela's associations with communists, had informed the South African police of his location [132] [133] Jailed in Johannesburg's Marshall Square prison, Mandela was charged with inciting workers' strikes and leaving the country without permission Representing himself with Slovo as legal advisor, Mandela intended to use the trial to showcase \"the ANC's moral opposition to racism\" while supporters demonstrated outside the court [134] Moved to Pretoria, where Winnie could visit him, he began

traditional kaross, refusing to call any witnesses, and turning his plea of mitigation into a political speech Found guilty, he was sentenced to five years' imprisonment; as he left the courtroom, supporters sang \"Nkosi Sikelel iAfrika\" [136]\n\n\nRobben Island: 1964–1982\nIn 1964, Mandela and his co-accused were transferred from Pretoria to the prison on Robben Island, remaining there for the next 18 years [145] Isolated from non-political prisoners in Section B, Mandela was imprisoned in a damp concrete cell measuring 8 feet (2.4 m) by 7 feet (2.1 m), with a straw mat on which to sleep [146] Verbally and physically harassed by several white prison wardens, the Rivonia Trial prisoners spent their days breaking rocks into gravel, until being reassigned in January 1965 to work in a lime quarry Mandela was initially forbidden to wear sunglasses, and the glare from the lime permanently damaged his eyesight [147] At night, he worked on his LLB degree, which he was obtaining from the University of London through a correspondence course with Wolsey Hall, Oxford, but newspapers were forbidden, and he was locked in solitary confinement on several occasions for the possession of smuggled news clippings [148] He was initially classified as the lowest grade of prisoner, Class D, meaning that he was permitted one visit and one letter every six months, although all mail was heavily censored [149]\n\n\nPollsmoor Prison: 1982–1988\nIn April 1982, Mandela was transferred to Pollsmoor Prison in Tokai, Cape Town, along with senior ANC leaders Walter Sisulu, Andrew Mlangeni, Ahmed Kathrada and Raymond Mhlaba; they believed that they were being isolated to remove their influence on younger activists at Robben Island [175] Conditions at Pollsmoor were better than at Robben Island, although Mandela missed the camaraderie and scenery of the island [176] Getting on well with Pollsmoor's commanding officer, Brigadier Munro, Mandela was permitted to create a roof garden; [177] he also read voraciously and corresponded widely, now being permitted 52 letters a year [178] He was appointed patron of the multi-racial United Democratic Front (UDF), founded to combat reforms implemented by South African president P W Botha Botha's National Party government had permitted Coloured and Indian citizens to vote for their own parliaments, which had control over education, health and housing, but black Africans were excluded from the system Like Mandela, the UDF saw this as an attempt to divide the anti-apartheid movement on racial lines [179]\n\n\nVictor Verster Prison and release: 1988–1990\nRecovering from tuberculosis exacerbated by the damp conditions in his cell, [191] Mandela was moved to Victor Verster Prison, near Paarl, in December 1988 He was housed in the relative comfort of a warder's house with a personal cook, and he used the time to complete his LLB degree [192] While there, he was permitted many visitors and organised secret communications with exiled ANC leader Oliver Tambo [193] [194]\n\n\nEnd of apartheid and elections\nMandela proceeded on an African tour, meeting supporters and politicians in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Libya and Algeria, and continuing to Sweden, where he was reunited with Tambo, and London, where he appeared at the Nelson Mandela: An International Tribute for a Free South Africa concert at Wembley Stadium [206] Encouraging foreign countries to support sanctions against the apartheid government, he met President François Mitterrand in France, Pope John Paul II in the Vatican, and Thatcher in the United Kingdom In the United States, he met President George H W Bush, addressed both Houses of Congress and visited eight cities, being particularly popular among the African American community [207] In Cuba, he became friends with President Castro, whom he had long admired [208] He met President R Venkataraman in India, President Suharto in Indonesia, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in Malaysia, and Prime Minister Bob Hawke in Australia He visited Japan, but not the Soviet Union, a longtime ANC supporter [209]\n\n\nEarly negotiations: 1990–91\nMandela proceeded on an African tour, meeting supporters and politicians in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Libya and Algeria, and continuing to Sweden, where he was reunited with Tambo, and London, where he appeared at the Nelson Mandela: An International Tribute for a Free South Africa concert at Wembley Stadium [206] Encouraging foreign countries to support sanctions against the apartheid government, he met President François Mitterrand in France, Pope John Paul II in the Vatican, and Thatcher in the United Kingdom In the United States, he met President George H W Bush, addressed both Houses of Congress and visited eight cities, being particularly popular among the African American community [207] In Cuba, he became friends with President Castro, whom he had long admired [208] He met President R Venkataraman in India, President Suharto in Indonesia, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in Malaysia, and Prime Minister Bob Hawke in Australia He visited Japan, but not the Soviet Union, a longtime ANC supporter [209]\n\n\nCODESA talks: 1991–92\nThe Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) began in December 1991 at the Johannesburg World Trade Centre, attended by 228 delegates from 19 political parties Although Cyril Ramaphosa led the ANC's delegation, Mandela remained a key figure After de Klerk used the closing speech to condemn the ANC's violence, Mandela took to the stage to denounce de Klerk as the \"head of an illegitimate, discredited minority regime\" Dominated by the National Party and ANC, little negotiation was achieved [217] CODESA 2 was held in May 1992, at which de Klerk insisted that post-apartheid South Africa must use a federal system with a rotating presidency to ensure the protection of ethnic minorities; Mandela opposed this, demanding a unitary system governed by majority rule [218] Following the Boipatong massacre of ANC activists by government-aided Inkatha militants, Mandela called off the negotiations, before attending a meeting of the Organisation of African Unity in Senegal, at which he called for a special session of the UN Security Council and proposed that a UN peacekeeping force be stationed in South Africa to prevent \"state terrorism\" [219] Calling for domestic mass action, in August the ANC organised the largest-ever strike in South African history, and supporters marched on Pretoria [220]\n\n\nGeneral election: 1994\nWith the election set for 27 April 1994, the ANC began campaigning, opening 100 election offices and orchestrating People's Forums across the country at which Mandela could appear, as a popular figure with great status among black South Africans [229] The ANC campaigned on a Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) to build a million houses in five years, introduce universal free education and extend access to water and electricity The party's slogan was \"a better life for all\", although it was not explained how this development would be funded [230] With the exception of the Weekly Mail and the New Nation, South Africa's press opposed Mandela's election, fearing continued ethnic strife, instead supporting the National or Democratic Party [231] Mandela devoted much time to fundraising for the ANC, touring North America, Europe and Asia to meet wealthy donors, including former supporters of the apartheid regime [232] He also urged a reduction in the voting age from 18 to 14; rejected by the ANC, this policy became the subject of ridicule [233]\n\n\nPresidency of South Africa: 1994–1999\nThe newly elected National Assembly's first act was to formally elect Mandela as South Africa's first black chief executive His inauguration took place in Pretoria on 10 May 1994, televised to a billion viewers globally The event was attended by four thousand guests, including world leaders from a wide range of geographic and ideological backgrounds [239] Mandela headed a Government of National Unity dominated by the ANC—which had no experience of governing by itself—but containing representatives from the National Party and Inkatha Under the Interim Constitution, Inkatha and the National Party were entitled to seats in the government by virtue of winning at least 20 seats In keeping with earlier agreements, both de Klerk and Thabo Mbeki were given the position of Deputy President [240] [241] Although Mbeki had not been his first choice for the job, Mandela grew to rely heavily on him throughout his presidency, allowing him to shape policy details [242] Moving into the presidential office at Tuynhuys in Cape Town, Mandela allowed de Klerk to retain the presidential residence in the Groote Schuur estate, instead settling into the nearby Westbrooke manor, which he renamed \"Genadendal\", meaning \"Valley of Mercy\" in Afrikaans [243] Retaining his Houghton home, he also had a house built in his home village of Qunu, which he visited regularly, meeting with locals, and judging tribal disputes [244]\n\n\nNational reconciliation\nGracious but steely,  [Mandela] steered a country in turmoil toward a negotiated settlement: a country that days before its first democratic election remained violent, riven by divisive views and personalities He endorsed national reconciliation, an idea he did not merely foster in the abstract, but performed with panache and conviction in reaching out to former adversaries He initiated an era of hope that, while not long-lasting, was nevertheless decisive, and he garnered the highest international recognition and affection.\n\n\nDomestic programmes\nMandela's administration inherited a country with a huge disparity in wealth and services between white and black communities Of a population of 40 million, around 23 million lacked electricity or adequate sanitation, and 12 million lacked clean water supplies, with 2 million children not in school and a third of the population illiterate There was 33% unemployment, and just under half of the population lived below the poverty line [267] Government financial reserves were nearly depleted, with a fifth of the national budget being spent on debt repayment, meaning that the extent of the promised Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) was scaled back, with none of the proposed nationalisation or job creation [268] In 1996, the RDP was replaced with a new policy, Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR), which maintained South Africa's mixed economy but placed an emphasis on economic growth through a framework of market economics and the encouragement of foreign investment; many in the ANC derided it as a neo-liberal policy that did not address social inequality, no matter how Mandela defended it [269] In adopting this approach, Mandela's government adhered to the \"Washington consensus\" advocated by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund [270]\n\n\nForeign affairs\nMandela expressed the view that \"South Africa's future foreign relations  [should] be based on our belief that human rights should be the core of international relations\" [285] Following the South African example, Mandela encouraged other nations to resolve conflicts through diplomacy and reconciliation [286] In September 1998, Mandela was appointed secretary-general of the Non-Aligned Movement, who held their annual conference in Durban He used the event to criticise the \"narrow, chauvinistic interests\" of the Israeli government in stalling negotiations to end the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and urged India and Pakistan to negotiate to end the Kashmir conflict, for which he was criticised by both Israel and India [287] Inspired by the region's economic boom, Mandela sought greater economic relations with East Asia, in particular with Malaysia, although this was prevented by the 1997 Asian financial crisis [288] He extended diplomatic recognition to the People's Republic of China (PRC), who were growing as an economic force, and initially also to Taiwan, who were already longstanding investors in the South African economy However, under pressure from the PRC, he cut recognition of Taiwan in November 1996, and he paid an official visit to Beijing in May 1999 [289]\n\n\nWithdrawing from politics\nThe new Constitution of South Africa was agreed upon by parliament in May 1996, enshrining a series of institutions to place checks on political and administrative authority within a constitutional democracy [303] De Klerk opposed the implementation of this constitution, and that month he and the National Party withdrew from the coalition government in protest, claiming that the ANC were not treating them as equals [304] The ANC took over the cabinet positions formerly held by the Nationals, with Mbeki becoming sole Deputy President [305] Inkatha remained part of the coalition, [306] and when both Mandela and Mbeki were out of the country in September 1998, Buthelezi was appointed \"Acting President\", marking an improvement in his relationship with Mandela [307] Although Mandela had often governed decisively in his first two years as president, [308] he had subsequently increasingly delegated duties to Mbeki, retaining only a close personal supervision of intelligence and security measures [309] During a 1997 visit to London, he said that \"the ruler of South Africa, the de facto ruler, is Thabo Mbeki\" and that he was \"shifting everything to him\" [308]\n\n\nPost-presidency and final years\nRetiring in June 1999, Mandela aimed to lead a quiet family life, divided between Johannesburg and Qunu Although he set about authoring a sequel to his first autobiography, to be titled The Presidential Years, it remained unfinished and was only published posthumously in 2017 [316] Mandela found such seclusion difficult and reverted to a busy public life involving a daily programme of tasks, meetings with world leaders and celebrities, and—when in Johannesburg—working with the Nelson Mandela Foundation, founded in 1999 to focus on rural development, school construction, and combating HIV/AIDS [317] Although he had been heavily criticised for failing to do enough to fight the HIV/AIDS pandemic during his presidency, he devoted much of his time to the issue following his retirement, describing it as \"a war\" that had killed more than \"all previous wars\"; affiliating himself with the Treatment Action Campaign, he urged Mbeki's government to ensure that HIV-positive South Africans had access to anti-retrovirals [318] Meanwhile, Mandela was successfully treated for prostate cancer in July 2001 [319] [320]\n\n\nContinued activism and philanthropy: 1999–2004\nRetiring in June 1999, Mandela aimed to lead a quiet family life, divided between Johannesburg and Qunu Although he set about authoring a sequel to his first autobiography, to be titled The Presidential Years, it remained unfinished and was only published posthumously in 2017 [316] Mandela found such seclusion difficult and reverted to a busy public life involving a daily programme of tasks, meetings with world leaders and celebrities, and—when in Johannesburg—working with the Nelson Mandela Foundation, founded in 1999 to focus on rural development, school construction, and combating HIV/AIDS [317] Although he had been heavily criticised for failing to do enough to fight the HIV/AIDS pandemic during his presidency, he devoted much of his time to the issue following his retirement, describing it as \"a war\" that had killed more than \"all previous wars\"; affiliating himself with the Treatment Action Campaign, he urged Mbeki's government to ensure that HIV-positive South Africans had access to anti-retrovirals [318] Meanwhile, Mandela was successfully treated for prostate cancer in July 2001 [319] [320]\n\n\n\"Retiring from retirement\": 2004–2013\nIn June 2004, aged 85 and amid failing health, Mandela announced that he was \"retiring from retirement\" and retreating from public life, remarking, \"Don't call me, I will call you.\" [330] Although continuing to meet with close friends and family, the foundation discouraged invitations for him to appear at public events and denied most interview requests [319]\n\n\nIllness and death: 2011–2013\nIn February 2011, Mandela was briefly hospitalised with a respiratory infection, attracting international attention, [342] [343] before being re-admitted for a lung infection and gallstone removal in December 2012 [344] [345] After a successful medical procedure in early March 2013, [346] his lung infection recurred and he was briefly hospitalised in Pretoria [347] In June 2013, his lung infection worsened and he was readmitted to a Pretoria hospital in serious condition [348] The Archbishop of Cape Town Thabo Makgoba visited Mandela at the hospital and prayed with Machel, [349] while Zuma cancelled a trip to Mozambique to visit him the following day [350] In September 2013, Mandela was discharged from hospital, [351] although his condition remained unstable [352]\n\n\nPolitical ideology\nA friend once asked me how I could reconcile my creed of African nationalism with a belief in dialectical materialism For me, there was no contradiction I was first and foremost an African nationalist fighting for our emancipation from minority rule and the right to control our own destiny But at the same time, South Africa and the African continent were part of the larger world Our problems, while distinctive and special, were not unique, and a philosophy that placed those problems in an international and historical context of the greater world and the course of history was valuable I was prepared to use whatever means necessary to speed up the erasure of human prejudice and the end of chauvinistic and violent nationalism.\n\n\nDemocracy\nAlthough he presented himself in an autocratic manner in several speeches, Mandela was a devout believer in democracy and abided by majority decisions even when deeply disagreeing with them [377] He had exhibited a commitment to the values of democracy and human rights since at least the 1960s [378] He held a conviction that \"inclusivity, accountability and freedom of speech\" were the fundamentals of democracy, [379] and was driven by a belief in natural and human rights [380] Suttner argued that there were \"two modes of leadership\" that Mandela adopted On one side he adhered to ideas about collective leadership, although on the other believed that there were scenarios in which a leader had to be decisive and act without consultation to achieve a particular objective [381]\n\n\nSocialism and Marxism\nMandela advocated the ultimate establishment of a classless society, [383] with Sampson describing him as being \"openly opposed to capitalism, private land-ownership and the power of big money\" [384] Mandela was influenced by Marxism, and during the revolution he advocated scientific socialism [385] He denied being a communist at the Treason Trial, [386] and maintained this stance both when later talking to journalists, [387] and in his autobiography, where he outlined that the cooperation with the SACP was pragmatic, asking rhetorically, \"who is to say that we were not using them?\" [388] According to the sociologist Craig Soudien, \"sympathetic as Mandela was to socialism, a communist he was not.\" [389] Conversely, the biographer David Jones Smith stated that Mandela \"embraced communism and communists\" in the late 1950s and early 1960s, [390] while the historian Stephen Ellis commented that Mandela had assimilated much of the Marxist–Leninist ideology by 1960 [391]\n\n\nPersonality and personal life\nMandela was widely considered a charismatic leader, [397] described by biographer Mary Benson as \"a born mass leader who could not help magnetizing people\" [398] He was highly image conscious and throughout his life always sought out fine quality clothes, with many commentators believing that he carried himself in a regal manner [399] His aristocratic heritage was repeatedly emphasised by supporters, thus contributing to his \"charismatic power\" [400] While living in Johannesburg in the 1950s, he cultivated the image of the \"African gentleman\", having \"the pressed clothes, correct manners, and modulated public speech\" associated with such a position [401] In doing so, Lodge argued that Mandela became \"one of the first media politicians .. embodying a glamour and a style that projected visually a brave new African world of modernity and freedom\" [367] Mandela was known to change his clothes several times a day, and he became so associated with highly coloured Batik shirts after assuming the presidency that they came to be known as \"Madiba shirts\" [402] [403]\n\n\nReception and legacy\nBy the time of his death, within South Africa Mandela was widely considered both \"the father of the nation\" [438] and \"the founding father of democracy\" [439] Outside of South Africa, he was a \"global icon\", [440] with the scholar of South African studies Rita Barnard describing him as \"one of the most revered figures of our time\" [441] One biographer considered him \"a modern democratic hero\" [442] Some have portrayed Mandela in messianic terms, [443] in contrast to his own statement that \"I was not a messiah, but an ordinary man who had become a leader because of extraordinary circumstances.\" [444] He is often cited alongside Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr as one of the 20th century's exemplary anti-racist and anti-colonial leaders [445] Boehmer described him as \"a totem of the totemic values of our age: toleration and liberal democracy\" [446] and \"a universal symbol of social justice\" [447]\n\n\nOrders, decorations, monuments, and honours\nOver the course of his life, Mandela was given over 250 awards, accolades, prizes, honorary degrees and citizenships in recognition of his political achievements [466] Among his awards were the Nobel Peace Prize, [227] the US Presidential Medal of Freedom, [467] the Soviet Union's Lenin Peace Prize, [466] and the Libyan Al-Gaddafi International Prize for Human Rights [468] In 1990, India awarded him the Bharat Ratna, [469] and in 1992 Pakistan gave him their Nishan-e-Pakistan [470] The same year, he was awarded the Atatürk Peace Award by Turkey; he at first refused the award, citing human rights violations committed by Turkey at the time, [471] but later accepted the award in 1999 [466] He was appointed to the Order of Isabella the Catholic [472] and the Order of Canada, [473] and was the first living person to be made an honorary Canadian citizen [474] Queen Elizabeth II appointed him as a Bailiff Grand Cross of the Order of St John and granted him membership in the Order of Merit [475]\n\n\nBiographies and popular media\nThe first biography of Mandela was based on brief interviews with him that the author, Mary Benson, had conducted in the 1960s [483] Two authorised biographies were later produced by friends of Mandela [484] The first was Fatima Meer's Higher Than Hope, which was heavily influenced by Winnie and thus placed great emphasis on Mandela's family [485] The second was Anthony Sampson's Mandela, published in 1999 [484] Other biographies included Martin Meredith's Mandela, first published in 1997, and Tom Lodge's Mandela, brought out in 2006 [484]\n\n\nSee

and politician who served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election. Mandela was a key figure in the fight against apartheid and became an international symbol of resistance against racial oppression.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nMandela was born on 18 July 1918, in the village of Mvezo in Umtata, then part of South Africa's Cape Province. He was given the forename Rolihlahla, which means \"troublemaker\" in the Xhosa language. Mandela's patrilineal great-grandfather, Ngubengcuka, was the ruler of the Thembu Kingdom in the Transkeian Territories of South Africa's modern Eastern Cape province. Mandela's grandfather, who shared the same name as his great-grandfather, was a son of Ngubengcuka and a member of the royal family.\n\n**Childhood: 1918-1934**\n\nMandela was born into a royal family and was raised in a small village in the Eastern Cape. He was the firstborn son of his parents and was expected to follow in the footsteps of his ancestors. Mandela's early life was marked by a strict upbringing, with his parents emphasizing the importance of education and community service. He was educated at a local school and later at a Methodist school in Engcobo, where he became friends with a girl for the first time and developed a love for sports and gardening.\n\n**Clarkebury, Healdtown, and Fort Hare: 1934-1940**\n\nMandela began his secondary education at Clarkebury Methodist High School in Engcobo, Western-style institution that was the largest school for black Africans in Thembuland. At Clarkebury, Mandela was socialized with other students on an equal basis and lost his \"stuck-up\" attitude. He befriended a Sotho-speaking student and was influenced by a Xhosa teacher who broke taboo by marrying a Sotho. Mandela spent his free time as a long-distance runner and boxer and became a prefect in his second year.\n\n**Arriving in Johannesburg: 1941-1943**\n\nMandela returned to Mqhekezweni in December 1940 and was arranged to be married by his guardian, Jongintaba. Dismayed, Mandela and his friend Justice fled to Johannesburg via Queenstown, arriving in April 1941. Mandela found work as a night watchman at Crown Mines and was fired when the induna discovered that he was a runaway. He stayed with a cousin in George Goch Township, who introduced Mandela to realtor and ANC activist Walter Sisulu. Sisulu secured Mandela a job as an articled clerk at the law firm of Witkin, Sidelsky and Eidelman.\n\n**Early revolutionary activity**\n\nMandela attended Communist Party gatherings and was impressed by the fact that Europeans, Africans, Indians, and Coloureds mixed as equals. He was not a member of the Communist Party, but he believed that the ANC should form an armed group to channel some of the violence in a controlled direction. Mandela convinced ANC leader Albert Luthuli and other activists of the necessity of forming an armed group, and the ANC Youth League was founded in 1944.\n\n**Law studies and the ANC Youth League: 1943-1949**\n\nMandela began studying law at the University of the Witwatersrand, where he was the only black African student and faced racism. He befriended liberal and communist European, Jewish, and Indian students, including Joe Slovo and Ruth First. Mandela became increasingly politicized and marched in support of a bus boycott to reverse fare rises. He joined the ANC and led the Youth League, which was founded in 1944.\n\n**Defiance Campaign and Transvaal ANC Presidency: 1950-1954**\n\nMandela took Xuma's place on the ANC national executive in March 1950 and became national president of the ANCYL in the same year. The Defend Free Speech Convention was held in Johannesburg, bringing together African, Indian, and communist activists to call a May Day general strike in protest against apartheid. Mandela opposed the strike, which was led by the National Party and Inkatha. He was outvoted and the strike was called off.\n\n**Congress of the People and the Treason Trial: 1955-1961**\n\nThe Congress of the People was held in Kliptown in 1955, where the Freedom Charter was adopted. Mandela became a key figure in the ANC and was arrested in 1956 with 155 other leaders for high treason. The Treason Trial lasted for three years, during which time Mandela was in prison and was subjected to conditions that included solitary confinement and denial of medical treatment.\n\n**Imprisonment**\n\nMandela was imprisoned on Robben Island in 1964 and spent the next 18 years in prison. He was isolated from non-political prisoners and was forced to work in a lime quarry. Mandela was subjected to physical harassment by white prison wardens and was forbidden to wear sunglasses. He was locked in solitary confinement several times for possession of smuggled news clippings.\n\n**Pollsmoor Prison: 1982-1988**\n\nMandela was transferred to Pollsmoor Prison in 1982, where he was joined by other senior ANC leaders. Conditions at Pollsmoor were better than on Robben Island, and Mandela was permitted to create a roof garden. He was allowed to receive 52 letters a year and was visited by Winnie Madikizela.\n\n**Victor Verster Prison and release: 1988-1990**\n\nMandela was transferred to Victor Verster Prison in 1988, where he was housed in the relative comfort of a warder's house. He was permitted many visitors and organized secret communications with exiled ANC leader Oliver Tambo.\n\n**Presidency of South Africa: 1994-1999**\n\nMandela was elected President of South Africa in 1994 and became the country's first black head of state. He was inaugurated in Pretoria on 10 May 1994 and was given the title \"the father of the nation.\" Mandela's presidency was marked by a Government of National Unity, which included representatives from the ANC, National Party, and Inkatha.\n\n**National reconciliation**\n\nMandela's presidency was marked by a commitment to national reconciliation. He endorsed the idea of inclusivity, accountability, and freedom of speech, and was driven by a belief in natural and human rights. Mandela believed that there were two modes of leadership: collective leadership and decisive leadership. He adhered to the former in most cases, but also believed that there were scenarios in which a leader had to be decisive and act without consultation to achieve a particular objective.\n\n**Socialism and Marxism**\n\nMandela advocated the ultimate establishment of a classless society. He was influenced by Marxism and during the revolution, he advocated scientific socialism. Mandela denied being a communist at the Treason Trial and maintained this stance both when talking to journalists and in his autobiography. He believed that the cooperation with the South African Communist Party was pragmatic.\n\n**Personality and personal life**\n\nMandela was widely considered a charismatic leader. He was image-conscious and cultivated the image of the \"African gentleman.\" Mandela was known to change his clothes several times a day and became associated with brightly colored Batik shirts after assuming the presidency.\n\n**Reception and legacy**\n\nMandela was a global icon and a symbol of resistance against racial oppression. He is often cited alongside Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. as one of the 20th century's exemplary anti-racist and anti-colonial leaders. Mandela was given over 250 awards, accolades, prizes, honorary degrees, and citizenships in recognition of his political achievements.\n\n**Biographies and popular media**\n\nThe first biography of Mandela was based on brief interviews with him that the author, Mary Benson, had conducted in the 1960s.

Mandela began his secondary education in 1933 at Clarkebury Methodist High School in Engcobo, a Western-style institution that was the largest school for black Africans in Thembuland [26] Made to socialise with other students on an equal basis, he claimed that he lost his \"stuck up\" attitude, becoming best friends with a girl for the first time; he began playing sports and developed his lifelong love of gardening [27] He completed his Junior Certificate in two years, [28] and in 1937 he moved to Healdtown, the Methodist college in Fort Beaufort attended by most Thembu royalty, including Justice [29] The headmaster emphasised the superiority of European culture and government, but Mandela became increasingly interested in native African culture, making his first non-Xhosa friend, a speaker of Sotho, and coming under the influence of one of his favourite teachers, a Xhosa who broke taboo by marrying a Sotho [30] Mandela spent much of his spare time at Healdtown as a long-distance runner and boxer, and in his second year he became a prefect [31]\n\n\nArriving in Johannesburg: 1941–1943\nReturning to Mqhekezweni in December 1940, Mandela found that Jongintaba had arranged marriages for him and Justice; dismayed, they fled to Johannesburg via Queenstown, arriving in April 1941 [40] Mandela found work as a night watchman at Crown Mines, his \"first sight of South African capitalism in action\", but was fired when the induna (headman) discovered that he was a runaway [41] He stayed with a cousin in George Goch Township, who introduced Mandela to realtor and ANC activist Walter Sisulu The latter secured Mandela a job as an articled clerk at the law firm of Witkin, Sidelsky and Eidelman, a company run by Lazar Sidelsky, a liberal Jew sympathetic to the ANC's cause [42] At the firm, Mandela befriended Gaur Radebe—a Hlubi member of the ANC and Communist Party—and Nat Bregman, a Jewish communist who became his first white friend [43] Mandela attended Communist Party gatherings, where he was impressed that Europeans, Africans, Indians, and Coloureds mixed as equals He later stated that he did not join the party because its atheism conflicted with his Christian faith, and because he saw the South African struggle as being racially based rather than as class warfare [44] To continue his higher education, Mandela signed up to a University of South Africa correspondence course, working on his bachelor's degree at night [45]\n\n\nEarly revolutionary activity\nMandela began studying law at the University of the Witwatersrand, where he was the only black African student and faced racism There, he befriended liberal and communist European, Jewish and Indian students, among them Joe Slovo and Ruth First [51] Becoming increasingly politicised, Mandela marched in August 1943 in support of a successful bus boycott to reverse fare rises [52] Joining the ANC, he was increasingly influenced by Sisulu, spending time with other activists at Sisulu's Orlando house, including his old friend Oliver Tambo [53] In 1943, Mandela met Anton Lembede, an ANC member affiliated with the \"Africanist\" branch of African nationalism, which was virulently opposed to a racially united front against colonialism and imperialism or to an alliance with the communists [54] Despite his friendships with non-blacks and communists, Mandela embraced Lembede's views, believing that black Africans should be entirely independent in their struggle for political self-determination [55] Deciding on the need for a youth wing to mass-mobilise Africans in opposition to their subjugation, Mandela was among a delegation that approached ANC president Alfred Bitini Xuma on the subject at his home in Sophiatown; the African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) was founded on Easter Sunday 1944 in the Bantu Men's Social Centre, with Lembede as president and Mandela as a member of its executive committee [56]\n\n\nLaw studies and the ANC

March 1950, [70] and that same year was elected national president of the ANCYL [71] In March, the Defend Free Speech Convention was held in Johannesburg, bringing together African, Indian and communist activists to call a May Day general strike in protest against apartheid and white minority rule Mandela opposed the strike because it was multi-racial and not ANC-led, but a majority of black workers took part, resulting in increased police repression and the introduction of the Suppression of Communism Act, 1950, affecting the actions of all protest groups [72] At the ANC national conference of December 1951, he continued arguing against a racially united front, but was outvoted [73]\n\n\nCongress of the People and the Treason Trial: 1955–1961\nWe, the people of South Africa, declare for all our country and the world to know:That South Africa belongs to all who live in it, black and white, and that no government can justly claim authority unless it is based on the will of the people.\n\n\nMK, the SACP, and African tour: 1961–62\nDisguised as a chauffeur, Mandela travelled around the country incognito, organising the ANC's new cell structure and the planned mass stay-at-home strike Referred to as the \"Black Pimpernel\" in the press—a reference to Emma Orczy's 1905 novel The Scarlet Pimpernel—a warrant for his arrest was put out by the police [112] Mandela held secret meetings with reporters, and after the government failed to prevent the strike, he warned them that many anti-apartheid activists would soon resort to violence through groups like the PAC's Poqo [113] He believed that the ANC should form an armed group to channel some of this violence in a controlled direction, convincing both ANC leader Albert Luthuli—who was morally opposed to violence—and allied activist groups of its necessity [114]\n\n\nImprisonment\nOn 5 August 1962, police captured Mandela along with fellow activist Cecil Williams near Howick [130] Many MK members suspected that the authorities had been tipped off with regard to Mandela's whereabouts, although Mandela himself gave these ideas little credence [131] In later years, Donald Rickard, a former American diplomat, revealed that the Central Intelligence Agency, which feared Mandela's associations with communists, had informed the South African police of his location [132] [133] Jailed in Johannesburg's Marshall Square prison, Mandela was charged with inciting workers' strikes and leaving the country without permission Representing himself with Slovo as legal advisor, Mandela intended to use the trial to showcase \"the ANC's moral opposition to racism\" while supporters demonstrated outside the court [134] Moved to Pretoria, where Winnie could visit him, he began correspondence studies for a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) degree from the University of London International Programmes [135] His hearing began in October, but he disrupted proceedings by wearing a traditional kaross, refusing to call any witnesses, and turning his plea of mitigation into a political speech Found guilty, he was sentenced to five years' imprisonment; as he left the courtroom, supporters sang \"Nkosi Sikelel iAfrika\" [136]\n\n\nArrest and Rivonia trial: 1962–1964\nOn 5 August 1962, police captured Mandela along with fellow activist Cecil Williams near Howick [130] Many MK members suspected that

[136]\n\n\nRobben Island: 1964–1982\nIn 1964, Mandela and his co-accused were transferred from Pretoria to the prison on Robben Island, remaining there for the next 18 years [145] Isolated from non-political prisoners in Section B, Mandela was imprisoned in a damp concrete cell measuring 8 feet (2.4 m) by 7 feet (2.1 m), with a straw mat on which to sleep [146] Verbally and physically harassed by several white prison wardens, the Rivonia Trial prisoners spent their days breaking rocks into gravel, until being reassigned in January 1965 to work in a lime quarry Mandela was initially forbidden to wear sunglasses, and the glare from the lime permanently damaged his eyesight [147] At night, he worked on his LLB degree, which he was obtaining from the University of London through a correspondence course with Wolsey Hall, Oxford, but newspapers were forbidden, and he was locked in solitary confinement on several occasions for the possession of smuggled news clippings [148] He was initially classified as the lowest grade of prisoner, Class D, meaning that he was permitted one visit and one letter every six months, although all mail was heavily censored [149]\n\n\nPollsmoor Prison: 1982–1988\nIn April 1982, Mandela was transferred to Pollsmoor Prison in Tokai, Cape Town, along with senior ANC leaders Walter Sisulu, Andrew Mlangeni, Ahmed Kathrada and Raymond Mhlaba; they believed that they were being isolated to remove their influence on younger activists at Robben Island [175] Conditions at Pollsmoor were better than at Robben Island, although Mandela missed the camaraderie and scenery of the island [176] Getting on well with Pollsmoor's commanding officer, Brigadier Munro, Mandela was permitted to create a roof garden; [177] he also read voraciously and corresponded widely, now being permitted 52 letters a year [178] He was appointed patron of the multi-racial United Democratic Front (UDF), founded to combat reforms implemented by South African president P W Botha Botha's National Party government had permitted Coloured and Indian citizens to vote for their own parliaments, which had control over education, health and housing, but black Africans were excluded from the system Like Mandela, the UDF saw this as an attempt to divide the anti-apartheid movement on racial lines [179]\n\n\nVictor Verster Prison and release: 1988–1990\nRecovering from tuberculosis exacerbated by the damp conditions in his cell, [191] Mandela was moved to Victor Verster Prison, near Paarl, in December 1988 He was housed in the relative comfort of a warder's house with a personal cook, and he used the time to complete his LLB degree [192] While there, he was permitted many visitors and organised secret communications with exiled ANC leader Oliver Tambo [193] [194]\n\n\nEnd of apartheid and elections\nMandela proceeded on an African tour, meeting supporters and politicians in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Libya and Algeria, and continuing to Sweden, where he was reunited with Tambo, and London, where he appeared at the Nelson Mandela: An International Tribute for a Free South Africa concert at Wembley Stadium [206] Encouraging foreign countries to support sanctions against the apartheid government, he met President François Mitterrand in France, Pope John Paul II in the Vatican, and Thatcher in the United Kingdom In the United States, he met President George H W Bush, addressed both Houses of Congress and visited eight cities, being particularly popular among the African American community [207] In Cuba, he became friends with President Castro, whom he had long admired [208] He met President R Venkataraman in India, President Suharto in Indonesia, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in Malaysia, and Prime Minister Bob Hawke in Australia He visited Japan, but not the Soviet Union, a longtime ANC supporter [209]\n\n\nEarly negotiations: 1990–91\nMandela proceeded on an African tour, meeting

[209]\n\n\nCODESA talks: 1991–92\nThe Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) began in December 1991 at the Johannesburg World Trade Centre, attended by 228 delegates from 19 political parties Although Cyril Ramaphosa led the ANC's delegation, Mandela remained a key figure After de Klerk used the closing speech to condemn the ANC's violence, Mandela took to the stage to denounce de Klerk as the \"head of an illegitimate, discredited minority regime\" Dominated by the National Party and ANC, little negotiation was achieved [217] CODESA 2 was held in May 1992, at which de Klerk insisted that post-apartheid South Africa must use a federal system with a rotating presidency to ensure the protection of ethnic minorities; Mandela opposed this, demanding a unitary system governed by majority rule [218] Following the Boipatong massacre of ANC activists by government-aided Inkatha militants, Mandela called off the negotiations, before attending a meeting of the Organisation of African Unity in Senegal, at which he called for a special session of the UN Security Council and proposed that a UN peacekeeping force be stationed in South Africa to prevent \"state terrorism\" [219] Calling for domestic mass action, in August the ANC organised the largest-ever strike in South African history, and supporters marched on Pretoria [220]\n\n\nGeneral election: 1994\nWith the election set for 27 April 1994, the ANC began campaigning, opening 100 election offices and orchestrating People's Forums across the country at which Mandela could appear, as a popular figure with great status among black South Africans [229] The ANC campaigned on a Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) to build a million houses in five years, introduce universal free education and extend access to water and electricity The party's slogan was \"a better life for all\", although it was not explained how this development would be funded [230] With the exception of the Weekly Mail and the New Nation, South Africa's press opposed Mandela's election, fearing continued ethnic strife, instead supporting the National or Democratic Party [231] Mandela devoted much time to fundraising for the ANC, touring North America, Europe and Asia to meet wealthy donors, including former supporters of the apartheid regime [232] He also urged a reduction in the voting age from 18 to 14; rejected by the ANC, this policy became the subject of ridicule [233]\n\n\nPresidency of South Africa: 1994–1999\nThe newly elected National Assembly's first act was to formally elect Mandela as South Africa's first black chief executive His inauguration took place in Pretoria on 10 May 1994, televised to a billion viewers globally The event was attended by four thousand guests, including world leaders from a wide range of geographic and ideological backgrounds [239] Mandela headed a Government of National Unity dominated by the ANC—which had no experience of governing by itself—but containing representatives from the National Party and Inkatha Under the Interim Constitution, Inkatha and the National Party were entitled to seats in the government by virtue of winning at least 20 seats In keeping with earlier agreements, both de Klerk and Thabo Mbeki were given the position of Deputy President [240] [241] Although Mbeki had not been his first choice for the job, Mandela grew to rely heavily on him throughout his presidency, allowing him to shape policy details [242] Moving into the presidential office at Tuynhuys in Cape Town, Mandela allowed de Klerk to retain the presidential residence in the Groote Schuur estate, instead settling into the nearby Westbrooke manor, which he renamed \"Genadendal\", meaning \"Valley of Mercy\" in Afrikaans [243] Retaining his Houghton home, he also had a house built in his home village of Qunu, which he visited regularly, meeting with locals, and judging tribal disputes [244]\n\n\nNational reconciliation\nGracious but steely,  [Mandela] steered a country in turmoil toward a negotiated settlement: a country that days before its first democratic election remained violent, riven by divisive views and personalities He endorsed national reconciliation, an idea he did not merely foster in the abstract, but performed with panache and conviction in reaching out to former adversaries He initiated an era of hope that, while not long-lasting, was nevertheless decisive, and he garnered the highest international recognition and affection.\n\n\nDomestic programmes\nMandela's administration inherited a country with a huge disparity in wealth and services between white and black communities Of a population of 40 million, around 23 million lacked electricity or adequate sanitation, and 12 million lacked clean water supplies, with 2 million children not in school and a third of the population illiterate There was 33% unemployment, and just under half of the population lived below the poverty line [267] Government financial reserves were nearly depleted, with a fifth of the national budget being spent on debt repayment, meaning that the extent of the promised Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) was scaled back, with none of the proposed nationalisation or job creation [268] In 1996, the RDP was replaced with a new policy, Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR), which maintained South Africa's mixed economy but placed an emphasis on economic growth through a framework of market economics and the encouragement of foreign investment; many in the ANC derided it as a neo-liberal policy that did not address social inequality, no matter how Mandela defended it [269] In adopting this approach, Mandela's government adhered to the \"Washington consensus\" advocated by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund [270]\n\n\nForeign affairs\nMandela expressed the view that \"South Africa's future foreign relations  [should] be based on our belief that human rights should be the core of international relations\" [285] Following the South African example, Mandela encouraged other nations to resolve conflicts through diplomacy and reconciliation [286] In September 1998, Mandela was appointed secretary-general of the Non-Aligned Movement, who held their annual conference in Durban He used the event to criticise the \"narrow, chauvinistic interests\" of the Israeli government in stalling negotiations to end the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and urged India and Pakistan to negotiate to end the Kashmir conflict, for which he was criticised by both Israel and India [287] Inspired by the region's economic boom, Mandela sought greater economic relations with East Asia, in particular with Malaysia, although this was prevented by the 1997 Asian financial crisis [288] He extended diplomatic recognition to the People's Republic of China (PRC), who were growing as an economic force, and initially also to Taiwan, who were already longstanding investors in the South African economy However, under pressure from the PRC, he cut recognition of Taiwan in November 1996, and he paid an official visit to Beijing in May 1999 [289]\n\n\nWithdrawing from politics\nThe new Constitution of South Africa was agreed upon by parliament in May 1996, enshrining a series of institutions to place checks on political and administrative authority within a constitutional democracy [303] De Klerk opposed the implementation of this constitution, and that month he and the National Party withdrew from the coalition government in protest, claiming that the ANC were not treating them as equals [304] The ANC took over the cabinet positions formerly held by the Nationals, with Mbeki becoming sole Deputy President [305] Inkatha remained part of the coalition, [306] and when both Mandela and Mbeki were out of the country in September 1998, Buthelezi was appointed \"Acting President\", marking an improvement in his relationship with Mandela [307] Although Mandela had often governed decisively in his first two years as president, [308] he had subsequently increasingly delegated duties to Mbeki, retaining only a close personal supervision of intelligence and security measures [309] During a 1997 visit to London, he said that \"the ruler of South Africa, the de facto ruler, is Thabo Mbeki\" and that he was \"shifting everything to him\" [308]\n\n\nPost-presidency and final years\nRetiring in June 1999, Mandela aimed to lead a quiet family life, divided between Johannesburg and Qunu Although he set about authoring a sequel to his first autobiography, to be titled The Presidential Years, it remained unfinished and was only published posthumously in 2017 [316] Mandela found such seclusion difficult and reverted to a busy public life involving a daily programme of tasks, meetings with world leaders and celebrities, and—when in Johannesburg—working with the Nelson Mandela Foundation, founded in 1999 to focus on rural development, school construction, and combating HIV/AIDS [317] Although he had been heavily criticised for failing to do enough to fight the HIV/AIDS pandemic during his presidency, he devoted much of his time to the issue following his retirement, describing it as \"a war\" that had killed more than \"all previous wars\"; affiliating himself with the Treatment Action Campaign, he urged Mbeki's government to ensure that HIV-positive South Africans had access to anti-retrovirals [318] Meanwhile, Mandela was successfully treated for prostate cancer in July 2001 [319] [320]\n\n\nContinued activism and philanthropy: 1999–2004\nRetiring in June 1999, Mandela aimed to lead a quiet family life, divided between Johannesburg and Qunu Although he set about authoring a sequel to his first autobiography, to be titled The Presidential Years, it remained unfinished and was only published posthumously in 2017 [316] Mandela found such seclusion difficult and reverted to a busy public life involving a daily programme of tasks, meetings with world leaders and celebrities, and—when in Johannesburg—working with the Nelson Mandela Foundation, founded in 1999 to focus on rural development, school construction, and combating HIV/AIDS [317] Although he had been heavily criticised for failing to do enough to fight the HIV/AIDS pandemic during his presidency, he devoted much of his time to the issue following his retirement, describing it as \"a war\" that had killed more than \"all previous wars\"; affiliating himself with the Treatment Action Campaign, he urged Mbeki's government to ensure that HIV-positive South Africans had access to anti-retrovirals [318] Meanwhile, Mandela was successfully treated for prostate cancer in July 2001 [319] [320]\n\n\n\"Retiring from retirement\": 2004–2013\nIn June 2004, aged 85 and amid failing health, Mandela announced that he was \"retiring from retirement\" and retreating from public life, remarking, \"Don't call me, I will call you.\" [330] Although continuing to meet with close friends and family, the foundation discouraged invitations for him to appear at public events and denied most interview requests [319]\n\n\nIllness and death: 2011–2013\nIn February 2011, Mandela was briefly hospitalised with a respiratory infection, attracting international attention, [342] [343] before being re-admitted for a lung infection and gallstone removal in December 2012 [344] [345] After a successful medical procedure in early March 2013, [346] his lung infection recurred and he was briefly hospitalised in Pretoria [347] In June 2013, his lung infection worsened and he was readmitted to a Pretoria hospital in serious condition [348] The Archbishop of Cape Town Thabo Makgoba visited Mandela at the hospital and prayed with Machel, [349] while Zuma cancelled a trip to Mozambique to visit him the following day [350] In September 2013, Mandela was discharged from hospital, [351] although his condition remained unstable [352]\n\n\nPolitical ideology\nA friend once asked me how I could reconcile my creed of African nationalism with a belief in dialectical materialism For me, there was no contradiction I was first and foremost an African nationalist fighting for our emancipation from minority rule and the right to control our own destiny But at the same time, South Africa and the African continent were part of the larger world Our problems, while distinctive and special, were not unique, and a philosophy that placed those problems in an international and historical context of the greater world and the course of history was valuable I was prepared to use whatever means necessary to speed up the erasure of human prejudice and the end of chauvinistic and violent nationalism.\n\n\nDemocracy\nAlthough he presented himself in an autocratic manner in several speeches, Mandela was a devout believer in democracy and abided by majority decisions even when deeply disagreeing with them [377] He had exhibited a commitment to the values of democracy and human rights since at least the 1960s [378] He held a conviction that \"inclusivity, accountability and freedom of speech\" were the fundamentals of democracy, [379] and was driven by a belief in natural and human rights [380] Suttner argued that there were \"two modes of leadership\" that Mandela adopted On one side he adhered to ideas about collective leadership, although on the other believed that there were scenarios in which a leader had to be decisive and act without consultation to achieve a particular objective [381]\n\n\nSocialism and Marxism\nMandela advocated the ultimate establishment of a classless society, [383] with Sampson describing him as being \"openly opposed to capitalism, private land-ownership and the power of big money\" [384] Mandela was influenced by Marxism, and during the revolution he advocated scientific socialism [385] He denied being a communist at the Treason Trial, [386] and maintained this stance both when later talking to journalists, [387] and in his autobiography, where he outlined that the cooperation with the SACP was pragmatic, asking rhetorically, \"who is to say that we were not using them?\" [388] According to the sociologist Craig Soudien, \"sympathetic as Mandela was to socialism, a communist he was not.\" [389] Conversely, the biographer David Jones Smith stated that Mandela \"embraced communism and communists\" in the late 1950s and early 1960s, [390] while the historian Stephen Ellis commented that Mandela had assimilated much of the Marxist–Leninist ideology by 1960 [391]\n\n\nPersonality and personal life\nMandela was widely considered a charismatic leader, [397] described by biographer Mary Benson as \"a born mass leader who could not help magnetizing people\" [398] He was highly image conscious and throughout his life always sought out fine quality clothes, with many commentators believing that he carried himself in a regal manner [399] His aristocratic heritage was repeatedly emphasised by supporters, thus contributing to his \"charismatic power\" [400] While living in Johannesburg in the 1950s, he cultivated the image of the \"African gentleman\", having \"the pressed clothes, correct manners, and modulated public speech\" associated with such a position [401] In doing so, Lodge argued that Mandela became \"one of the first media politicians .. embodying a glamour and a style that projected visually a brave new African world of modernity and freedom\" [367] Mandela was known to change his clothes several times a day, and he became so associated with highly coloured Batik shirts after assuming the presidency that they came to be known as \"Madiba shirts\" [402] [403]\n\n\nReception and legacy\nBy the time of his death, within South Africa Mandela was widely considered both \"the father of the nation\" [438] and \"the founding father of democracy\" [439] Outside of South Africa, he was a \"global icon\", [440] with the scholar of South African studies Rita Barnard describing him as \"one of the most revered figures of our time\" [441] One biographer considered him \"a modern democratic hero\" [442] Some have portrayed Mandela in messianic terms, [443] in contrast to his own statement that \"I was not a messiah, but an ordinary man who had become a leader because of extraordinary circumstances.\" [444] He is often cited alongside Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr as one of the 20th century's exemplary anti-racist and anti-colonial leaders [445] Boehmer described him as \"a totem of the totemic values of our age: toleration and liberal democracy\" [446] and \"a universal symbol of social justice\" [447]\n\n\nOrders, decorations, monuments, and honours\nOver the course of his life, Mandela was given over 250 awards, accolades, prizes, honorary degrees and citizenships in recognition of his political achievements [466] Among his awards were the Nobel Peace Prize, [227] the US Presidential Medal of Freedom, [467] the Soviet Union's Lenin Peace Prize, [466] and the Libyan Al-Gaddafi International Prize for Human Rights [468] In 1990, India awarded him the Bharat Ratna, [469] and in 1992 Pakistan gave him their Nishan-e-Pakistan [470] The same year, he was awarded the Atatürk Peace Award by Turkey; he at first refused the award, citing human rights violations committed by Turkey at the time, [471] but later accepted the award in 1999 [466] He was appointed to the Order of Isabella the Catholic [472] and the Order of Canada, [473] and was the first living person to be made an honorary Canadian citizen [474] Queen Elizabeth II appointed him as a Bailiff Grand Cross of the Order of St John and granted him membership in the Order of Merit [475]\n\n\nBiographies and popular media\nThe first biography of Mandela was based on brief interviews with him that the author, Mary Benson, had conducted in the 1960s [483] Two authorised biographies were later produced by friends of Mandela [484] The first was Fatima Meer's Higher Than Hope, which was heavily influenced by Winnie and thus placed great emphasis on Mandela's family [485] The second was Anthony Sampson's Mandela, published in 1999 [484] Other biographies included Martin Meredith's Mandela, first published in 1997, and Tom Lodge's Mandela, brought out in 2006 [484]\n\n\nSee

Meriwether as Catwoman, Cesar Romero as the Joker, Burgess Meredith as the Penguin and Frank Gorshin as the Riddler [12]\n\n\n1970s and 80s\nIn the late 1970s, Batman's popularity was waning [14] CBS was interested in producing a Batman in Outer Space film Producers Michael Uslan and Benjamin Melniker purchased the film rights of Batman from DC Comics on October 3, 1979 It was Uslan's wish \"to make the definitive, dark, serious version of Batman, the way Bob Kane and Bill Finger had envisioned him in 1939 A creature of the night; stalking criminals in the shadows.\" [14] Richard Maibaum was approached to write a script with Guy Hamilton to direct, but the two turned down the offer Uslan was unsuccessful with pitching Batman to various movie studios because they wanted the film to be similar to the campy 1960s TV series Columbia Pictures and United Artists were among those to turn down the film [15]\n\n\nTim Burton and Joel Schumacher series\nTim Burton took over as director of the first Batman film in 1986 Steve Englehart and Julie Hickson wrote film treatments before Sam Hamm wrote the first screenplay [23] [25] Numerous A-list actors were considered for the role of Batman before Michael Keaton was cast Keaton was a controversial choice for the role since, by 1988, he had become typecast as a comedic actor and many observers doubted he could portray a serious role [23] Jack Nicholson accepted the role of the Joker under strict conditions that dictated a high salary, a portion of the box office profits and his shooting schedule Nicholson's final salary is reported to be as high as $50 million [19] [26] [27] [28] Principal photography took place at Pinewood Studios from October 1988 to January 1989 [29] The budget escalated from $30 million to $48 million, [26] while the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike forced Hamm to drop out Rewrites were performed by Warren Skaaren, Charles McKeown [19] and Jonathan Gems [30] Batman received positive reviews, broke numerous box office records, and won the Academy Award for Best Art Direction The film grossed over $400 million, [23] and left a legacy over the modern perception of the superhero film genre [31]\n\n\nFilmography\nFollowing a rejected Batman origin story reboot Joss Whedon pitched in December 2002, [100] [101] Warner Bros hired Christopher Nolan and David S Goyer to script Batman Begins [102] The duo aimed for a darker and more realistic tone, with humanity and realism being the basis of the film [103] The film was primarily shot in the United Kingdom and Chicago, [104] [105] and relied on traditional stunts and scale models with minimal use of computer-generated imagery Christian Bale starred as Batman, Liam Neeson as Ra's al Ghul, and Cillian Murphy as Jonathan Crane/The Scarecrow Katie Holmes appears in the movie as Wayne's love interest, Rachel Dawes, a role created for the film Alfred Pennyworth was played by Michael Caine, Jim Gordon was portrayed by Gary Oldman and Lucius Fox by Morgan Freeman A new Batmobile (called the Tumbler) and a more mobile Batsuit were both created specifically for the film [106] [107]\n\n\nBatman (1989)\nTim Burton took over as director of the first Batman film in 1986 Steve Englehart and Julie Hickson wrote film treatments before Sam Hamm wrote the first screenplay [23] [25] Numerous A-list actors were considered for the

genre [31]\n\n\nBatman Returns (1992)\nBurton originally did not want to direct a sequel because of his mixed emotions over the previous film [17] Sam Hamm's first script had the Penguin and Catwoman searching for hidden treasure [32] Daniel Waters delivered a script that satisfied Burton, which convinced him to direct the film Wesley Strick went uncredited for writing the shooting draft, deleting the Robin character, reworking the Penguin's characterization and \"normalizing\" all dialogue Strick remained as the on-set writer throughout the production process and received top-billing screenplay credit the early trailers, while Waters had sole story credit [33] [34] Various A-list actresses lobbied hard for the role of Catwoman before Michelle Pfeiffer was cast, while Danny DeVito signed on to portray the Penguin [35] Filming started at Warner Bros in Burbank, California in June 1991 Batman Returns was released with financial success, but Warner Bros was disappointed with the film's box office run because it earned less than its predecessor [36] However, Batman Returns was released to generally positive reviews, [37] with praise for its action sequences, performances, Danny Elfman's score, effects and villains, although its dark tone and high level of violence for a PG-13 film was criticized [36] McDonald's shut down its Happy Meal tie-in for Batman Returns [38]\n\n\nBatman Forever (1995)\nAlthough Batman Returns was a financial success, Warner Bros felt the film should have made more money The studio decided to change the direction of the Batman film series to be more mainstream Joel Schumacher replaced Tim Burton as director, while Burton decided to stay on as producer [39] However, Michael Keaton did not like the new direction the film series was heading in, [40] and was replaced by Val Kilmer as Batman Chris O'Donnell was introduced as Robin, Jim Carrey starred as The Riddler, while Tommy Lee Jones starred as Two-Face Filming started in September 1994, [39] and Schumacher found Kilmer and Jones difficult to work with [41] Batman Forever was released on June 16, 1995, with financial success, earning over $350 million worldwide and three Academy Award nominations [42] The film received mixed reviews from critics, with criticism directed towards the CGI, Kilmer's performance, costume designs and tonal departure from previous films, but praising the visuals, action sequences and performances of Carrey and Jones [43]\n\n\nBatman & Robin (1997)\nAfter the release of Batman Forever, Warner Bros started development on Batman & Robin, commissioning it on fast track for an adamant June 1997 release [44] Val Kilmer did not return, because of scheduling conflicts with The Saint, [45] and was replaced by George Clooney Arnold Schwarzenegger starred as Mr Freeze, while Uma Thurman played Poison Ivy, Alicia Silverstone played Batgirl, and Robert Swenson played Bane Chris O'Donnell reprised his role as Robin Michael Gough and Pat Hingle are the only cast members to appear in all four films as Alfred Pennyworth and Commissioner Gordon respectively Principal photography began in September 1996 [46] and finished in January 1997, [47] two weeks ahead of the shooting schedule [48]\n\n\nProposals for a fifth film\nDuring the filming of Batman & Robin, Warner Bros was impressed with the dailies, prompting them to immediately hire Joel Schumacher to reprise his directing duties for a third film Writer Akiva Goldsman, who worked on Batman Forever and Batman & Robin, turned down the chance to write the script [48] In late 1996, Warner Bros and Schumacher hired Mark Protosevich to write the script for a fifth Batman film A projected mid-1999 release date was announced [54] Los Angeles Times described their film as \"continuing in the same vein with multiple villains and more silliness\" [55] Schumacher, however, later claimed that the film would have been darker and closer in tone to the first two films in the series [56] Titled Batman Unchained but often incorrectly referred to as Batman Triumphant, [2] Protosevich's script had the Scarecrow as the main villain and the Joker would return as a hallucination in Batman's mind caused by the Scarecrow's fear toxin Harley Quinn would appear as a supporting character, written as the Joker's daughter trying to kill Batman to avenge her father's death [57] The film would have depicted the Scarecrow and Harley Quinn teaming up to drive Batman insane and have him committed to Arkham Asylum After their defeat, the film would have ended with Bruce Wayne traveling to Bali and entering a cave, where he allows himself to be swarmed by bats to symbolize that he has conquered fear [56] Clooney, O'Donnell, and Silverstone were set to reprise the roles of Batman, Robin, and Batgirl [58] Schumacher had also approached Nicolas Cage for the role of Scarecrow in Batman & Robin as a cameo appearance to set up an appearance in Batman Unchained, [59] before ultimately casting Coolio [60]\n\n\nBatman Unchained\nDuring the filming of Batman & Robin, Warner Bros was impressed with the dailies, prompting them to immediately hire Joel Schumacher

[60]\n\n\nBatman: DarKnight\nDespite Warner Bros and Schumacher's interest with Year One, Lee Shapiro, a comic book fan, and Stephen Wise pitched the studio with a script titled Batman: DarKnight in mid-1998 DarKnight, which was largely inspired by The Dark Knight Returns, had Bruce Wayne giving up his crime fighting career after becoming disillusioned with his alias's inability to inspire fear and mystique in his enemies, and Dick Grayson attending Gotham University [61] Dr Jonathan Crane uses his position as professor of psychology at Gotham University and as head psychiatrist at Arkham Asylum to conduct his fear experiments (this element would later appear in Batman Begins) During a vengeful confrontation with a colleague, Dr Kirk Langstrom, Crane unknowingly initiates Kirk's transformation into the creature known as Man-Bat Citizens of Gotham believe Man-Bat's nightly activities to be Batman's \"bloodthirsty\" return Bruce once again becomes Batman \"to clear his name,\" and solve the mystery of Man-Bat [61] Kirk struggles with his \"man-vs.-monster\" syndrome, as he longs to both reunite with his wife and get revenge on Crane, while Crane exacts revenge on those responsible for his dismissal from both Arkham and the university while encountering truths about his past As with Schumacher's idea for Batman Unchained, the film would have had a darker tone [56] Warner Bros Pictures formally decided not to move forward with the project in 2001, and passed on Batman: DarKnight in favor of other projects [56] [61] In 2015, the screenplay was released on Amazon [62]\n\n\nRobin spin-off\nChris O'Donnell revealed in a 2012 interview with Access Hollywood that a Robin spin-off had been considered; the project was canceled after Batman & Robin [63]\n\n\nBatgirl\nIn December 2021, Keaton was revealed to be appearing in the DC Extended Universe film Batgirl, reprising his role from Batman and Batman Returns [64] Keaton had been expected to first reprise the role for the DCEU in The Flash prior to that film's delay to 2023 Batgirl was ultimately canceled in post-production.\n\n\nOnStar commercials\nThe Batman OnStar commercials were a series of six television commercials featuring Batman, created by ad-agency Campbell-Ewald and aired from 2000 to the beginning of 2002 [65]\n\n\nAbandoned reboot attempts\nIn 1999, new Warner studio head Alan Horn promised five tent-poles a year He wanted to revive the Batman and Superman franchises as tentpoles [55] Wolfgang Petersen was to direct Superman: Flyby, [67] [68] but Andrew Kevin Walker pitched Warner Bros an idea titled Batman vs Superman with Peterson as director Superman: Flyby was put on hold, [67] and Akiva Goldsman was hired to rewrite Walker's Batman vs Superman [69] [55]\n\n\nBatman vs. Superman\nIn 1999, new Warner studio head Alan Horn promised five tent-poles a year He wanted to revive the Batman and Superman franchises as tentpoles [55] Wolfgang Petersen was to direct Superman: Flyby, [67] [68] but Andrew Kevin Walker pitched Warner Bros an idea titled Batman vs Superman with Peterson as director Superman: Flyby was put on hold, [67] and Akiva Goldsman was hired to rewrite Walker's Batman vs Superman [69] [55]\n\n\nBatman Beyond\nThe studio decided it was best to consider a live-action Batman Beyond film [55] and an adaptation of Frank Miller's Batman: Year One Warner Bros would then greenlight whichever idea suited them the most [69] By September 2000, Warner Bros was developing a live action screen adaptation of Batman Beyond, written by Paul Dini, Neal Stephenson and Boaz Yakin, with the possibility of Yakin directing [76]\n\n\nBatman: Year One\nWarner Bros abandoned Batman Beyond almost instantly in favor of an adaptation of Frank Miller's 1987 comic book story arc Batman: Year One [69] After Batman and Robin, Schumacher felt he \"owe [d] the Batman culture a real Batman movie I would go back to the basics and make a dark portrayal of the Dark Knight.\" [77] He had approached Warner Bros to adapt Batman: Year One in mid-1998 [77] Aronofsky and Miller intended to reboot the Batman franchise, \"it's somewhat based on the comic book,\" Aronofsky said \"Toss out everything you can imagine about Batman! Everything! We're starting completely anew.\" [80] Regular Aronofsky collaborator, Matthew Libatique, was set as cinematographer [81] At the same time, Warner Bros was moving forward on a Catwoman spin-off [82]\n\n\nJustice League: Mortal\nIn February 2007, during pre-production for The Dark Knight, Warner Bros hired husband and wife screenwriting duo Michelle and Kieran Mulroney to script a Justice League film [86] featuring a younger Batman in a separate franchise [87] George Miller was hired to direct the following September, [88] with Armie Hammer cast as Batman a month later [89] [90] and Teresa Palmer as Talia al Ghul [91] Filming had nearly commenced at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney, but was pushed back over the Writers Guild of America strike, and once more when the Australian Film Commission denied Warner Bros a 45 percent tax rebate over lack of Australian actors in the film [92] Production offices were moved to Vancouver Film Studios in Canada for an expected July 2008 start and a planned summer 2009 theatrical release date, [93] [94] but Warner Bros ultimately canceled Justice League following the success of The Dark Knight Hammer's option on his contract lapsed and the studio was more willing to proceed with Christopher Nolan to finish his trilogy separately with The Dark Knight Rises [95]\n\n\nThe Dark Knight trilogy\nThe Dark Knight trilogy consists of Batman Begins (2005), The Dark Knight (2008), and The Dark Knight Rises (2012), all directed by Christopher Nolan Collectively grossing over $2.4 billion at the worldwide box office, the trilogy has been ranked among the greatest ever made [96] [97] [98]\n\n\nFilmography\nFollowing a rejected Batman origin story reboot Joss Whedon pitched in December 2002, [100] [101] Warner Bros hired Christopher Nolan and David S Goyer to script Batman Begins [102] The duo aimed for a darker and more realistic tone, with humanity and realism being the basis of the film [103] The film was primarily shot in the United Kingdom and Chicago, [104] [105] and relied on traditional stunts and scale models with minimal use of computer-generated imagery Christian Bale starred as Batman, Liam Neeson as Ra's al Ghul, and Cillian Murphy as Jonathan Crane/The Scarecrow Katie Holmes appears in the movie as Wayne's love interest, Rachel Dawes, a role created for the film Alfred Pennyworth was played by

[107]\n\n\nBatman Begins (2005)\nFollowing a rejected Batman origin story reboot Joss Whedon pitched in December 2002, [100] [101] Warner Bros hired Christopher Nolan and David S Goyer to script

role as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Heath Ledger as The Joker, and Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent / Two-Face Katie Holmes turned down her role as Rachel, and Maggie Gyllenhaal was cast instead Principal photography began in April 2007 in Chicago and concluded in November Other locations included Pinewood Studios, Ministry of Sound in London and Hong Kong.\n\n\nThe Dark Knight Rises (2012)\nNolan wanted the story for the third and final installment to keep him emotionally invested \"On a more superficial level, I have to ask the question,\" he reasoned, \"how many good third movies in a franchise can people name?\" [127] He returned out of finding a necessary way to continue the story, but feared midway through filming he would find a sequel redundant [128] The Dark Knight Rises is intended to complete Nolan's Batman trilogy [129] By December 2008, Nolan completed a rough story outline, before he committed himself to Inception [130] In February 2010, work on the screenplay was commencing with David S Goyer and Jonathan Nolan [131] When Goyer left to work on the Superman reboot, Jonathan was writing the script based on the story by his brother and Goyer [132] Tom Hardy was cast as Bane and Anne Hathaway plays Selina Kyle [133] Joseph Gordon-Levitt was cast as Robin John Blake, [134] [135] and Marion Cotillard was cast as Miranda Tate Filming began in May 2011 and concluded in November [136] Nolan chose not to film in 3-D but, by focusing on improving image quality and scale using the IMAX format, hoped to push technological boundaries while nevertheless making the style of the film consistent with the previous two [137] Nolan had several meetings with IMAX Vice-President David Keighley to work on the logistics of projecting films in digital IMAX venues [138] The Dark Knight Rises featured more scenes shot in IMAX than The Dark Knight [138] Cinematographer Wally Pfister expressed interest in shooting the film entirely in IMAX [139] [140]\n\n\nDC Extended Universe\nOn June 13, 2013, a source from Warner Bros told The Wrap that they were discussing more Man of Steel films, as well as a Superman/Batman film, Wonder Woman, and Aquaman [142] Warner Bros announced that Superman and Batman would unite in a new film, a follow-up to Man of Steel (2013), taking its inspiration from the comic The Dark Knight Returns and set for release in 2015 [143] [144] [145] Goyer stated at the Superman 75th Anniversary Panel at Comic-Con, that Batman and Superman would face off, and titles under consideration were Superman vs Batman or Batman vs Superman [146] On August 22, 2013, The Hollywood Reporter announced the casting of Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne/Batman [147] [148] On January 17, 2014, it was announced that the film had been delayed from its original July 17, 2015, release date to May 6, 2016, in order to give the filmmakers \"time to realize fully their vision, given the complex visual nature of the story\" [149] The film's release was moved again to March 25, 2016, \"avoiding a high-profile showdown with Captain America: Civil War on May 6, 2016\" [150]\n\n\nBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016)\nOn June 13, 2013, a source from Warner Bros told The Wrap that they were discussing more Man of Steel films, as well as a Superman/Batman film, Wonder Woman, and Aquaman [142] Warner Bros announced that Superman and Batman would unite in a new film, a follow-up to Man of Steel (2013), taking its inspiration from the comic The Dark Knight Returns and set for release in 2015 [143] [144] [145] Goyer stated at the

\"avoiding a high-profile showdown with Captain America: Civil War on May 6, 2016\" [150]\n\n\nJustice League (2017)\nShortly after filming had finished for Man of Steel, Warner Bros hired Will Beall to script a new Justice League film in June 2012 [151] With the release of Man of Steel in June 2013, Goyer was hired to write a new Justice League script, with the Beall draft being scrapped [152] In April 2014, it was announced that Zack Snyder would also be directing Goyer's Justice League script [153] Warner Bros was reportedly courting Chris Terrio to rewrite Justice League the following July, after having been impressed with his rewrite of Batman v Superman [154] During post-production of the film, Zack Snyder left the film due to the death of his daughter [155] Joss Whedon took over the project and wrote and directed reshoots [155]\n\n\nZack Snyder's Justice League (2021)\nThe divisive reaction toward the final cut of Justice League, with Zack Snyder leaving directorial duties and the final cut of the film in the hands of Joss Whedon, has led to an argument comparing the situation to the one experienced by the film Superman II Both Justice League and Superman II feature a director that was replaced, for different reasons, before the completion of a film, which led to a second director coming in and making substantial changes to the tone of each film Although the reasoning behind each director's departure differs, Richard Donner was able to complete his cut of Superman II in 2005 [156] In the belief that Snyder had shot enough material for a finished film, a campaign for a \"Snyder Cut\" was started to allow Snyder to receive a similar treatment to Donner Arguments are made that Snyder's vision would be more cohesive to the previous films than the actual theatrical cut, which Snyder has refused to see Warner Bros initially remained silent regarding any intention of making a \"Snyder Cut\" [157] In March 2019, Snyder confirmed his original cut does exist, and stated that it is up to Warner Bros to release it [158] Despite this, in November, Variety reported that Warner Bros was unlikely to release Snyder's version of Justice League in theaters or on HBO Max, calling it a \"pipe dream\" [159] In December, however, Snyder posted a photo in his Vero account, which showed boxes with tapes labeled \"Z.S J.L Director's cut\", and with the caption \"Is it real? Does it exist? Of course it does.\" [160] On May 20, 2020, Snyder officially announced that HBO Max will be releasing his cut of Justice League on their service in 2021 [161] The cut would cost $70+ million to complete the special effects, musical score, editing, and additional shooting While initially planned to be a four part miniseries, it was later clarified the cut would be released as a four hour long movie [162] [163] [164] [165] [166] Snyder stated this version will be non-canonical to DC Extended Universe continuity, but it would exist in a slightly alternate universe [167] Affleck, Miller, Fisher, Heard, and Manganiello returned to their respective roles for additional photography, in order to finish the project, with Jared Leto also reprising his role as The Joker from Suicide Squad [168] [169]\n\n\nThe Flash (2023)\nIn June 2020, Michael Keaton entered talks to reprise his role from the Tim Burton Batman films in the DCEU film The Flash, released in 2023 According to The Hollywood Reporter, Warner Bros hoped for Keaton to return for multiple DCEU films in a way \"akin to the role played by Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, something of a mentor or guide or even string-puller.\" [170] In August 2020, Keaton officially signed on, with Ben Affleck also announced to be reprising his version of the character for the film Affleck stated that his scenes in the film were his favorite as the character [171] [172] Along with Keaton and Affleck playing Batman in different timelines, George Clooney makes a cameo as Bruce Wayne in the closing scene Adam West makes a posthumous appearance as Batman through the use of CGI and archive footage.\n\n\nCameos (2016–2023)\nIn addition to major roles, Batman has made various cameo appearances in other DCEU films.\n\n\nJoker films\nJoker, directed by Todd Phillips, [176] is set during the 1980s, where a failed stand-up comedian named Arthur Fleck turns to a life of crime and chaos in Gotham City and calls himself Joker [177] Bruce Wayne, a child portrayed by Dante Pereira-Olson, encounters Fleck when the latter attempts and fails to gain entry into Wayne Manor Fleck later sees Bruce in a darkened alley with the bodies of his parents, who had been fatally shot by an assailant who wears a clown mask.\n\n\nThe Batman films\n\n\n\nDC Universe\nAfter filmmaker James Gunn and producer Peter Safran were appointed in October 2022 to serve as the co-chairmen and co-CEOs of the then-newly formed DC Studios to develop plans for a new DC shared universe slate, Gunn stated in

was interested in producing a Batman in Outer Space film Producers Michael Uslan and Benjamin Melniker purchased the film rights of Batman from DC Comics on October 3, 1979 It was Uslan's wish \"to make the definitive, dark, serious version of Batman, the way Bob Kane and Bill Finger had envisioned him in 1939 A creature of the night; stalking criminals in the shadows.\" [14] Richard Maibaum was approached to write a script with Guy Hamilton to direct, but the two turned down the offer Uslan was unsuccessful with pitching Batman to various movie studios because they wanted the film to be similar to the campy 1960s TV series Columbia Pictures and United Artists were among those to turn down the film [15]\n\n\nTim Burton and Joel Schumacher series\nTim Burton took over as director of the first Batman film in 1986 Steve Englehart and Julie Hickson wrote film treatments before Sam Hamm wrote the first screenplay [23] [25] Numerous A-list actors were considered for the role of Batman

searching for hidden treasure [32] Daniel Waters delivered a script that satisfied Burton, which convinced him to direct the film Wesley Strick went uncredited for writing the shooting draft, deleting the Robin character, reworking the Penguin's characterization and \"normalizing\" all dialogue Strick remained as the on-set writer throughout the production process and received top-billing screenplay credit the early trailers, while Waters had sole story credit [33] [34] Various A-list actresses lobbied hard for the role of Catwoman before Michelle Pfeiffer was cast, while Danny DeVito signed on to portray the Penguin [35] Filming started at Warner Bros in Burbank, California in June 1991 Batman Returns was released with financial success, but Warner Bros was disappointed with the film's box office run because it earned less than its predecessor [36] However, Batman Returns was released to generally positive reviews, [37] with praise for its action sequences, performances, Danny Elfman's score, effects and villains, although its dark tone and high level of violence for a PG-13 film was criticized [36] McDonald's shut down its Happy Meal tie-in for Batman Returns [38]\n\n\nBatman Forever (1995)\nAlthough Batman Returns was a financial success, Warner Bros felt the film should have made more money The studio decided to change the direction of the Batman film series to be more mainstream Joel Schumacher replaced Tim Burton as director, while Burton decided to stay on as producer [39] However, Michael Keaton did not like the new direction the film series was heading in, [40] and was replaced by Val Kilmer as Batman Chris O'Donnell was introduced as Robin, Jim Carrey starred as The Riddler, while Tommy Lee Jones starred as Two-Face Filming started in September 1994, [39] and Schumacher found Kilmer and Jones difficult to work with [41] Batman Forever was released on June 16, 1995, with financial success, earning over $350 million worldwide and three Academy Award nominations [42] The film received mixed reviews from critics, with criticism directed towards the CGI, Kilmer's performance, costume designs and tonal departure from previous films, but praising the visuals, action sequences and performances of Carrey and Jones [43]\n\n\nBatman & Robin (1997)\nAfter the release of Batman Forever, Warner Bros started development on Batman & Robin, commissioning it on fast track for an adamant June 1997 release [44] Val Kilmer did not return, because of scheduling conflicts with The Saint, [45] and was replaced by George Clooney Arnold Schwarzenegger starred as Mr Freeze, while Uma Thurman played Poison Ivy, Alicia Silverstone played Batgirl, and Robert Swenson played Bane Chris O'Donnell reprised his role as Robin Michael Gough and

immediately hire Joel Schumacher to reprise his directing duties for a third film Writer Akiva Goldsman, who worked on Batman Forever and Batman & Robin, turned down the chance to write the script [48] In late 1996, Warner Bros and Schumacher hired Mark Protosevich to write the script for a fifth Batman film A projected mid-1999 release date was announced [54] Los Angeles Times described their film as \"continuing in the same vein with multiple villains and more silliness\" [55] Schumacher, however, later claimed that the film would have been darker and closer in tone to the first two films in the series [56] Titled Batman Unchained but often incorrectly referred to as Batman Triumphant, [2] Protosevich's script had the Scarecrow as the main villain and the Joker would return as a hallucination in Batman's mind caused by the Scarecrow's fear toxin Harley Quinn would appear as a supporting character, written as the Joker's daughter trying to kill Batman to avenge her father's death [57] The film would have depicted the Scarecrow and Harley Quinn teaming up to drive Batman insane and have him committed to Arkham Asylum After their defeat, the film would have ended with Bruce Wayne traveling to Bali and entering a cave, where he allows himself to be swarmed by bats to symbolize that he has conquered fear [56] Clooney, O'Donnell, and Silverstone were set to reprise the roles of Batman, Robin, and Batgirl [58] Schumacher had also approached Nicolas Cage for the role of Scarecrow in Batman & Robin as a cameo appearance to set up an appearance in Batman Unchained, [59] before ultimately casting Coolio [60]\n\n\nBatman Unchained\nDuring the filming of Batman & Robin, Warner Bros was impressed with the dailies, prompting them to immediately hire Joel Schumacher

[60]\n\n\nBatman: DarKnight\nDespite Warner Bros and Schumacher's interest with Year One, Lee Shapiro, a comic book fan, and Stephen Wise pitched the studio with a script titled Batman: DarKnight in mid-1998 DarKnight, which was largely inspired by The Dark Knight Returns, had Bruce Wayne giving up his crime fighting career after becoming disillusioned with his alias's inability to inspire fear and mystique in his enemies, and Dick Grayson attending Gotham University [61] Dr Jonathan Crane uses his position as professor of psychology at Gotham University and as head psychiatrist at Arkham Asylum to conduct his fear experiments (this element would later appear in Batman Begins) During a vengeful confrontation with a colleague, Dr Kirk Langstrom, Crane unknowingly initiates Kirk's transformation into the creature known as Man-Bat Citizens of Gotham believe Man-Bat's nightly activities to be Batman's \"bloodthirsty\" return Bruce once again becomes Batman \"to clear his name,\" and solve the mystery of Man-Bat [61] Kirk struggles with his \"man-vs.-monster\" syndrome, as he longs to both reunite with his wife and get revenge on Crane, while Crane exacts revenge on those responsible for his dismissal from both Arkham and the university while encountering truths about his past As with Schumacher's idea for Batman Unchained, the film would have had a darker tone [56] Warner Bros Pictures formally decided not to move forward with the project in 2001, and passed on Batman: DarKnight in favor of other projects [56] [61] In 2015, the screenplay was released on Amazon [62]\n\n\nRobin spin-off\nChris O'Donnell revealed in a 2012 interview with Access Hollywood that a Robin spin-off had been considered; the project was canceled after Batman & Robin [63]\n\n\nBatgirl\nIn December 2021, Keaton was revealed to be appearing in the DC Extended Universe film Batgirl, reprising his role from Batman and Batman Returns [64] Keaton had been expected to first reprise the role for the DCEU in The Flash prior to that film's delay to 2023 Batgirl was ultimately canceled in post-production.\n\n\nOnStar commercials\nThe Batman OnStar commercials were a

was hired to rewrite Walker's Batman vs Superman [69] [55]\n\n\nBatman Beyond\nThe studio decided it was best to consider a live-action Batman Beyond film [55] and an adaptation of Frank Miller's Batman: Year One Warner Bros would then greenlight whichever idea suited them the most [69] By September 2000, Warner Bros was developing a live action screen adaptation of Batman Beyond, written by Paul Dini, Neal Stephenson and Boaz Yakin, with the possibility of Yakin directing [76]\n\n\nBatman: Year One\nWarner Bros abandoned Batman Beyond almost instantly in favor of an adaptation of Frank Miller's 1987 comic book story arc Batman: Year One [69] After Batman and Robin, Schumacher felt he \"owe [d] the Batman culture a real Batman movie I would go back to the basics and make a dark portrayal of the Dark Knight.\" [77] He had approached Warner Bros to adapt Batman: Year One in mid-1998 [77] Aronofsky and Miller intended to reboot the Batman franchise, \"it's somewhat based on the comic book,\" Aronofsky said \"Toss out everything you can imagine about Batman! Everything! We're starting completely anew.\" [80] Regular Aronofsky collaborator, Matthew Libatique, was set as cinematographer [81] At the same time, Warner Bros was moving forward on a Catwoman spin-off

Film Commission denied Warner Bros a 45 percent tax rebate over lack of Australian actors in the film [92] Production offices were moved to Vancouver Film Studios in Canada for an expected July 2008 start and a planned summer 2009 theatrical release date, [93] [94] but Warner Bros ultimately canceled Justice League following the success of The Dark Knight Hammer's option on his contract lapsed and the studio was more willing to proceed with Christopher Nolan to finish his trilogy separately with The Dark Knight Rises [95]\n\n\nThe Dark Knight trilogy\nThe Dark Knight trilogy consists of Batman Begins (2005), The Dark Knight (2008), and The Dark Knight Rises (2012), all directed by Christopher Nolan Collectively grossing over $2.4 billion at the worldwide box office, the trilogy has been ranked among the greatest ever made [96] [97] [98]\n\n\nFilmography\nFollowing a rejected Batman origin story reboot Joss Whedon pitched in December 2002, [100] [101] Warner Bros hired

photography began in April 2007 in Chicago and concluded in November Other locations included Pinewood Studios, Ministry of Sound in London and Hong Kong.\n\n\nThe Dark Knight Rises (2012)\nNolan wanted the story for the third and final installment to keep him emotionally invested \"On a more superficial level, I have to ask the question,\" he reasoned, \"how many good third movies in a franchise can people name?\" [127] He returned out of finding a necessary way to continue the story, but feared midway through filming he would find a sequel redundant [128] The Dark Knight Rises is intended to complete Nolan's Batman trilogy [129] By December 2008, Nolan completed a rough story outline, before he committed himself to Inception [130] In February 2010, work on the screenplay was

the style of the film consistent with the previous two [137] Nolan had several meetings with IMAX Vice-President David Keighley to work on the logistics of projecting films in digital IMAX venues [138] The Dark Knight Rises featured more scenes shot in IMAX than The Dark Knight [138] Cinematographer Wally Pfister expressed interest in shooting the film entirely in IMAX [139] [140]\n\n\nDC

project and wrote and directed reshoots [155]\n\n\nZack Snyder's Justice League (2021)\nThe divisive reaction toward the final cut of Justice League, with Zack Snyder leaving directorial duties and the final cut of the film in the hands of Joss Whedon, has led to an argument comparing the situation to the one experienced by the film Superman II Both Justice League and Superman II feature a director that was replaced, for different reasons, before the completion of a film, which led to a second director coming in and making substantial changes to the tone of each film Although the reasoning behind each director's departure differs, Richard Donner was able to complete his cut of Superman II in 2005 [156] In the belief that Snyder had shot enough material for a finished film, a campaign for a \"Snyder Cut\" was started to allow Snyder to receive a similar treatment to Donner Arguments are made that Snyder's vision would be more cohesive to the previous films than the actual theatrical cut, which Snyder has refused to see Warner Bros initially remained silent regarding any intention of making a \"Snyder Cut\" [157] In March 2019, Snyder confirmed his original cut does exist, and stated that it is up to Warner Bros to release it [158] Despite this, in November, Variety reported that Warner Bros was unlikely to release Snyder's version of Justice League in theaters or on HBO Max, calling it a \"pipe dream\" [159] In December, however, Snyder posted a photo in his Vero account, which showed boxes with tapes labeled \"Z.S J.L Director's cut\", and with the caption \"Is it real? Does it exist? Of course it does.\" [160] On May 20, 2020, Snyder officially announced that HBO Max will be releasing his cut of Justice League on their service in 2021 [161] The cut would cost $70+ million to complete the special effects, musical score, editing, and additional shooting While initially planned to be a four part miniseries, it was later clarified the cut would be released as a four hour long movie [162] [163] [164] [165] [166] Snyder stated this version will be non-canonical to DC Extended Universe continuity, but it would exist in a slightly alternate universe [167] Affleck, Miller, Fisher, Heard, and Manganiello returned to their respective roles for additional photography, in order to finish the project, with Jared Leto also reprising his role as The Joker from Suicide Squad

Hollywood Reporter, Warner Bros hoped for Keaton to return for multiple DCEU films in a way \"akin to the role played by Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, something of a mentor or guide or even string-puller.\" [170] In August 2020, Keaton officially signed on, with Ben Affleck also announced to be reprising his version of the character for the film Affleck stated that his scenes in the film were his favorite as the character [171] [172] Along with Keaton and Affleck playing Batman in different timelines, George Clooney makes a cameo as Bruce Wayne in the

The two became friends and recorded demos with others from the school. In 1992, they formed a band, Darlin', with Bangalter on bass, Homem-Christo on guitar, and Laurent Brancowitz on guitar and drums. The trio named themselves after the Beach Boys song \"Darlin'\", which they covered along with an original composition.\n\n## Early career and Darlin'\n\nIn 1992, Darlin' released a multi-artist EP under Duophonic Records, a label owned by the London-based band Stereolab. The EP included a cover of the Beach Boys song \"Darlin'\", as well as an original composition. Darlin' was invited to open for shows in the United Kingdom, marking the beginning of their live performance career.\n\n## First performances and singles\n\nIn September 1993, Daft Punk attended a rave at EuroDisney, where they met Stuart Macmillan of Slam, the co-founder of the Scottish label Soma Quality Recordings. They gave him a demo tape, which formed the basis for Daft Punk's debut single, \"The New Wave\", a limited release in 1994. The single also contained the final mix of \"The New Wave\" called \"Alive\", which appeared on Daft Punk's first album.\n\n## Homework\n\nDaft Punk released their debut album, Homework, in 1997. The album revived house music and departed from the Eurodance formula. It combined established club styles and the \"burgeoning eclecticism\" of big beat. In 1997, Daft Punk embarked on an international concert tour, Daftendirektour, using their home equipment for the live stage. On 25 May, they headlined the Tribal Gathering festival at Luton Hoo, England, with Orbital and Kraftwerk.\n\n## Discovery\n\nDaft Punk's second album, Discovery, was released in 2001. They said it was an attempt to reconnect with the playful, open-minded attitude associated with the discovery phase of childhood. The album reached No 2 in the UK, and its lead single, \"One More Time\", was a hit. The song is heavily autotuned and compressed. The singles \"Digital Love\" and \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\" were also successful in the UK and on the US Dance Chart, and \"Face to Face\" hit number one on the US club play charts.\n\n## Human After All and Alive 2007\n\nIn March 2005, Daft Punk released their third album, Human After All, the result of six weeks of writing and recording. Reviews were mixed, with criticism for its repetitiveness and darker mood. \"Robot Rock\", \"Technologic\", \"Human After All\" and \"The Prime Time of Your Life\" were released as singles. A Daft Punk anthology CD/DVD, Musique Vol 1 1993–2005, was released on 4 April 2006.

It was included in a 20th-anniversary compilation of the Soma label.

Sean Cooper of AllMusic described it as a blend of acid house, techno, pop, indie rock, hip hop, progressive house, funk, and electro.\n\n## Image\n\nFor most public and media appearances, Daft Punk wore costumes that concealed their faces. Bangalter said they wanted the focus to be on their music, and that masks allowed them to control their image while retaining their anonymity and protecting their personal lives. He said that the 1974 film Phantom of the Paradise, in which the main character prominently wears a mask, was \"the foundation for a lot of what we're about artistically\". Daft Punk were also fans of the 1970s band Space, who wore space suits with helmets that hid their appearance.\n\n## Media appearances\n\nDaft Punk's popularity has been partially attributed to their appearances in mainstream media.

The New York Times credited Daft Punk with helping make dance music mainstream.\n\n## Discography\n\nIn October 2011, Daft Punk placed 28th in a \"top-100 DJs of 2011\" list by DJ Magazine after placing in the 44th position the year before.

{"title": "Puyi", "content": "\nEmperor of China (1908–1912)\nChosen by Empress Dowager Cixi, [2] Puyi became emperor at the age of 2 years and 10 months in December 1908 after the Guangxu Emperor, Puyi's half-uncle, died childless on 14 November Titled the Xuantong Emperor, Puyi's introduction to the life of an emperor began when palace officials arrived at his family residence to take him On the evening of 13 November, without any advance notice, a procession of eunuchs and guardsmen led by the palace chamberlain left the Forbidden City for the Northern Mansion to inform Prince Chun that they were taking away his two-year-old son Puyi to be the new emperor The toddler Puyi screamed and resisted as the officials ordered the eunuch attendants to pick him up Puyi's parents said nothing when they learned that they were losing their son As Puyi wept, screaming that he did not want to leave his parents, he was forced into a palanquin that took him to the Forbidden City [3] Wang Lianshou, Puyi's wet nurse, was the only person from the Northern Mansion allowed to go with him [4] Upon arriving at the Forbidden City, Puyi was taken to see Cixi [5] Puyi later wrote:\n\n\nEunuchs and the Household Department\nSeparated from his family, Puyi lived his childhood in a regime of virtual seclusion in the Forbidden City, surrounded by guards, eunuchs and other servants who treated him like a god The emperor's upbringing was a mixture of pampering and mistreatment, as he was required to follow all the rules of rigid Chinese imperial protocol and was unable to behave like a normal child [15] [failed verification – see discussion]\n\n\nAbdication\nOn 10 October 1911, the army garrison in Wuhan mutinied, sparking a widespread revolt in the Yangtze river valley and beyond, demanding the overthrow of the Qing dynasty that had ruled China since 1644 The strongman general Yuan Shikai was dispatched by the court to crush the revolution, but was unable to, as by 1911 public opinion had turned decisively against the Qing, and many Chinese had no wish to fight for a dynasty that was seen as having lost the mandate of heaven [21] Puyi's father, Prince Chun, served as a regent until 6 December, when Empress Dowager Longyu took over following the Xinhai Revolution [22]\n\n\nLife in the Forbidden City (1912–1924)\nUnder the \"Articles of Favourable Treatment of the Great Qing Emperor after His Abdication\", signed with the new Republic of China, Puyi was to retain his imperial title and be treated by the government of the Republic with the protocol attached to a foreign monarch Puyi and the imperial court were allowed to remain in the northern half of the Forbidden City (the Private Apartments) as well as in the Summer Palace A hefty annual subsidy of four million silver taels was granted by the Republic to the imperial household, although it was never fully paid and was abolished after just a few years Puyi was not informed in February 1912 that his reign had ended and China was now a republic, and continued to believe that he was still emperor for some time In 1913, when Empress Dowager Longyu died, President Yuan arrived at the Forbidden City to pay his respects, which Puyi's tutors told him meant that major changes were afoot [25]\n\n\nBrief restoration (1917)\nIn 1917, the warlord Zhang Xun restored Puyi to the throne from 1 to 12 July [27] Zhang Xun ordered his army to keep their queues to display loyalty to the emperor However, then-Premier of the Republic of China Duan Qirui ordered a Caudron Type D plane, piloted by Pan Shizhong (潘世忠) with bombardier Du Yuyuan (杜裕源) from Nanyuan airfield, to drop three bombs over the Forbidden City as a show of force against Zhang Xun, causing the death of a eunuch, but otherwise inflicting minor damage [28] [29] This is the first aerial bombardment recorded by a Chinese Air Force, and the restoration failed due to extensive opposition across China [30]\n\n\nRelationship with Reginald Johnston\nOn 3 March 1919, the Scottish scholar and diplomat Reginald Johnston arrived in the Forbidden City to serve as Puyi's tutor [31] President Xu Shichang believed the monarchy would eventually be restored, and to prepare Puyi for the challenges of the modern world had hired Johnston to teach Puyi \"subjects such as political science, constitutional history and English\" [32] Johnston was allowed only five texts in English to give Puyi to read: Alice in Wonderland and translations into English of the \"Four Great Books\" of Confucianism; the Analects, the Mencius, the Great Learning and the Doctrine of the Mean [32] But he disregarded the rules, and taught Puyi about world history with a special focus on British history [33] Besides history, Johnston taught Puyi philosophy and about what he saw as the superiority of monarchies to republics [33] Puyi remembered that his tutor's piercing blue eyes \"made me feel uneasy .. I found him very intimidating and studied English with him like a good boy, not daring to talk about other things when I got bored .. as I did with my other Chinese tutors\" [31]\n\n\nMarriage\nIn March 1922, the Dowager Consorts decided that Puyi should be married, and gave him a selection of photographs of aristocratic teenage girls to choose from Puyi first chose Erdet Wenxiu as his wife, but was told that she was acceptable only as a concubine, so he would have to choose again Puyi later claimed that the faces were too small to distinguish between [48] Puyi then chose Gobulo Wanrong, the daughter of one of Manchuria's richest aristocrats, who had been educated in English by American missionaries in Tianjin, who was considered to be an acceptable empress by the Dowager Consorts On 15 March 1922, the betrothal of Puyi and Wanrong was announced in the newspapers On 17 March, Wanrong took the train to Beijing, and on 6 April, Puyi went to the Qing family shrine to inform his ancestors that he would be married to her later that year Puyi did not meet Wanrong until their wedding [49]\n\n\nExpulsion from the Forbidden City (1924)\nOn 23 October 1924, a coup led by the warlord Feng Yuxiang took control of Beijing Feng, the latest of the warlords to take Beijing, was seeking legitimacy and decided that abolishing the unpopular Articles of Favourable Settlement was an easy way to win the crowd's approval [67] Feng unilaterally revised the \"Articles of Favourable Treatment\" on 5 November 1924, abolishing Puyi's imperial title and privileges and reducing him to a private citizen of the Republic of China Puyi was expelled from the Forbidden City the same day [68] He was given three hours to leave [67] He spent a few days at the house of his father Prince Chun, and then temporarily resided in the Japanese embassy in Beijing [69] Puyi left his father's house together with Johnston and his chief servant Big Li without informing Prince Chun's servants, slipped his followers, and went to the Japanese legation Puyi had originally wanted to go to the British Legation, but Johnston had insisted that he would be safer with the Japanese For Johnston, the system where the Japanese people worshipped their emperor as a living god was much closer to his ideal than the British constitutional monarchy, and he constantly steered Puyi in a pro-Japanese direction [70]\n\n\nResidence in Tianjin (1925–1931)\nIn February 1925, Puyi moved to the Japanese concession of Tianjin, first into the Zhang Garden, and in 1929 [75] into the former residence of Lu Zongyu known as the Garden of Serenity [76] A British journalist, Henry Woodhead, called Puyi's court a \"doggy paradise\" as both Puyi and Wanrong were dog lovers who owned several very spoiled dogs while Puyi's courtiers spent an inordinate amount of time feuding with one another [77] Woodhead stated that the only people who seemed to get along at Puyi's court were Wanrong and Wenxiu, who were \"like sisters\" [78] Tianjin was, after Shanghai, the most cosmopolitan Chinese city, with large British, French, German, Russian and Japanese communities As an emperor, Puyi was allowed to join several social clubs that normally only admitted whites During this period, Puyi and his advisers Chen Baochen, Zheng Xiaoxu, and Luo Zhenyu discussed plans to restore Puyi as Emperor Zheng and Luo favoured enlisting assistance from external parties, while Chen opposed the idea In June 1925, the warlord Zhang Zuolin visited Tianjin to meet Puyi \"Old Marshal\" Zhang, an illiterate former bandit, ruled Manchuria, a region equal in size to Germany and France combined, which had a population of 30 million and was the most industrialised region in China Zhang kowtowed to Puyi at their meeting and promised to restore the House of Qing if Puyi made a large financial donation to his army Zhang warned Puyi in a \"roundabout way\" not to trust his Japanese friends Zhang fought in the pay of the Japanese, but by this time his relations with the Kwantung Army were becoming strained In June 1927, Zhang captured Beijing and Behr observed that if Puyi had had more courage and returned to Beijing, he might have been restored to the Dragon Throne [79] Puyi was noted to have said in a 1927 article in The Illustrated London News, that \"I never wish to be Emperor again\" [80]\n\n\nCaptive in Manchuria (1931–1932)\nIn September 1931, Puyi sent a letter to Jirō Minami, the Japanese Minister of War, expressing his desire to be restored to the throne [92] On the night of 18 September 1931, the Mukden Incident began when the Japanese Kwantung Army blew up a section of railroad belonging to the Japanese-owned South Manchurian Railroad company and blamed the warlord Marshal Zhang Xueliang [93] On this pretext the Kwantung Army began a general offensive with the aim of conquering all of Manchuria [94] Puyi was visited by Kenji Doihara, head of the espionage office of the Japanese Kwantung Army, who proposed establishing Puyi as head of a Manchurian state The Japanese further bribed a café worker to tell Puyi that a contract was out on his life in an attempt to frighten Puyi into moving [95]\n\n\nPuppet rule of Manchukuo (1932–1945)\nPuyi accepted the Japanese offer and on 1 March 1932 was installed as the Chief Executive of Manchukuo, a puppet state of the Empire of Japan, under the era name Datong One contemporary commentator, Wen Yuan-ning, quipped that Puyi had now achieved the dubious distinction of having been \"made emperor three times without knowing why and apparently without relishing it.\" [103]\n\n\nAs emperor of Manchukuo\nOn 1 March 1934, he was crowned Emperor of Manchukuo, under the regnal title Kangde in Changchun A sign of the true rulers of Manchukuo was the presence of General Masahiko Amakasu during the coronation; ostensibly there as the film director to record the coronation, Amakasu served as Puyi's minder, keeping a careful watch on him to prevent him from going off script [120] Wanrong was excluded from the coronation: her addiction to opium, anti-Japanese feelings, dislike of Puyi, and growing reputation for being \"difficult\" and unpredictable led Amakasu to the conclusion that she could not be trusted to behave [121] Though submissive in public to the Japanese, Puyi was constantly at odds with them in private He resented being \"Head of State\" and then \"Emperor of Manchukuo\" rather than being fully restored as a Qing Emperor At his enthronement, he clashed with Japan over dress; they wanted him to wear a military uniform like those used by the Manchukuo military, whereas he considered it an insult to wear anything but traditional Manchu robes In a typical compromise, he wore a Western military uniform to his enthronement [122] (the only Chinese emperor ever to do so) and a dragon robe to the announcement of his accession at the Temple of Heaven [123] Puyi was driven to his coronation in a Lincoln limousine with bulletproof windows followed by nine Packards, and during his coronation scrolls were read out while sacred wine bottles were opened for the guests to celebrate the beginning of a \"Reign of Tranquillity and Virtue\" [124] The invitations for the coronation were issued by the Kwantung Army and 70% of those who attended Puyi's coronation were Japanese [121] Time magazine published an article about Puyi's coronation in March 1934 [125]\n\n\nCollapse of Manchukuo\nOn 9 August 1945, the Kwantung Army's commander General Otozō Yamada told Puyi that the Soviet Union had declared war on Japan and the Red Army had entered Manchukuo Yamada was assuring Puyi that the Kwantung Army would easily defeat the Red Army, when the air raid sirens sounded and the Red Air Force began a bombing raid, forcing all to hide in the basement While Puyi prayed to the Buddha, Yamada fell silent as the bombs fell, destroying Japanese barracks next to the Salt Tax Palace [181] In the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation, 1,577,725 Soviet and Mongol troops stormed into Manchuria in a combined arms offensive with tanks, artillery, cavalry, aircraft and infantry working closely together that overwhelmed the Kwantung Army, who had not expected a Soviet invasion until 1946 and were short of both tanks and anti-tank guns [182]\n\n\nLater life (1945–1967)\nThe Soviets took Puyi to the Siberian town of Chita He lived in a sanatorium, then later in Khabarovsk near the Chinese border, where he was treated well and allowed to keep some of his servants As a prisoner, Puyi spent his days praying and expected the prisoners to treat him as an emperor and slapped the faces of his servants when they displeased him [192]\n\n\nSoviet imprisonment and trial\nThe Soviets took Puyi to the Siberian town of Chita He lived in a sanatorium, then later in Khabarovsk near the Chinese border, where he was treated well and allowed to keep some of his servants As a prisoner, Puyi spent his days praying and expected the prisoners to treat him as an emperor and slapped the faces of his servants when they displeased him [192]\n\n\nIn the People's Republic\nAfter the Chinese Communist Party came to power in 1949, Puyi was repatriated to China after negotiations between the Soviet Union and China [200] [201] Puyi was of considerable value to Mao, as Behr noted: \"In the eyes of Mao and other Chinese Communist leaders, Pu Yi, the last Emperor, was the epitome of all that had been evil in old Chinese society If he could be shown to have undergone sincere, permanent change, what hope was there for the most diehard counter-revolutionary? The more overwhelming the guilt, the more spectacular the redemption-and the greater glory of the Chinese Communist Party.\" [202] Puyi was to be subjected to \"remodelling\" to make him into a Communist [203]\n\n\nContinued imprisonment\nAfter the Chinese Communist Party came to power in 1949, Puyi was repatriated to China after negotiations between the Soviet Union and China [200] [201] Puyi was of considerable value to Mao, as Behr noted: \"In the eyes of Mao and other Chinese Communist leaders, Pu Yi, the last Emperor, was the epitome of all that had been evil in old Chinese society If he could be shown to have undergone sincere, permanent change, what hope was there for the most diehard counter-revolutionary? The more overwhelming the guilt, the more spectacular the redemption-and the greater glory of the Chinese Communist Party.\" [202] Puyi was to be subjected to \"remodelling\" to make him into a Communist [203]\n\n\nRelease\nPuyi came to Beijing on 9 December 1959 with special permission from Mao and lived for the next six months in an ordinary Beijing residence with his sister before being transferred to a government-sponsored hotel He had the job of sweeping the streets, and got lost on his first day of work, which led him to tell astonished passers-by: \"I'm Puyi, the last Emperor of the Qing dynasty I'm staying with relatives and can't find my way home\" [213] One of Puyi's first acts upon returning to Beijing was to visit the Forbidden City as a tourist; he pointed out to other tourists that many of the exhibits were the things he had used in his youth He voiced his support for the Communists and worked as a gardener at the Beijing Botanical Gardens The role brought Puyi a degree of happiness he had never known as an emperor, though he was notably clumsy [214]\n\n\nDeath\nThe Cultural Revolution broke out in 1966, and the Red Guards that had been encouraged by Mao saw Puyi, who symbolised imperial China, as an easy target Puyi was placed under protection by the local public security bureau and, although his food rations, salary, and various luxuries, including his sofa and desk, were removed, he was not publicly humiliated as was common at the time The Red Guards attacked Puyi for his book From Emperor to Citizen because it had been translated into English and French, which displeased the Red Guards and led to copies of the book being burned in the streets Various members of the Qing family, including Pujie, had their homes raided and burned by Red Guards, but Zhou Enlai used his influence to protect Puyi and the rest of the Qing from the worst abuses inflicted by the Red Guard Jin Yuan, the man who had \"remodelled\" Puyi in the 1950s, fell victim to the Red Guard and became a prisoner in Fushun for several years, while Li Wenda, who had ghostwritten From Emperor to Citizen, spent seven years in solitary confinement [225] However, Puyi's health began to decline He died in Beijing of complications arising from kidney cancer and heart disease on 17 October 1967 at the age of 61 [226]\n\n\nTitles, honours, and decorations\nWhen he ruled as emperor of the Qing dynasty (and therefore emperor of China) from 1908 to 1912 and during his brief restoration in 1917, Puyi's era name was \"Xuantong\", so he was known as the \"Xuantong Emperor\" (simplified Chinese: 宣统皇帝; traditional Chinese: 宣統皇帝; pinyin: Xuāntǒng Huángdì; Wade–Giles: Hsüan1-t'ung3 Huang2-ti4) during those two periods Puyi was also allowed to retain his title as Emperor of the Great Qing, being treated like a foreign monarch by the Republic of China until 5 November 1924.\n\n\nTitles\nWhen he ruled as emperor of the Qing dynasty (and therefore emperor of China) from 1908 to 1912 and during his brief restoration in 1917, Puyi's era name was \"Xuantong\", so he was known as the \"Xuantong Emperor\" (simplified Chinese: 宣统皇帝;

Born Aixinjueluo Puyi, he was the 12th and final emperor of the Qing dynasty, which had ruled China since 1644.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nPuyi was born on February 7, 1906, in the Forbidden City in Beijing, China. His father, Prince Chun, was the second son of the Emperor Guangxu. Puyi was chosen by Empress Dowager Cixi to succeed his half-uncle, the Guangxu Emperor, who died childless on November 14, 1908.\n\n**Emperor of China (1908-1912)**\n\nPuyi became emperor at the age of 2 years and 10 months in December 1908. He was titled the Xuantong Emperor. His introduction to the life of an emperor began when palace officials arrived at his family residence to take him to the Forbidden City. Puyi wept and screamed as he was forced to leave his parents. He was taken to see Empress Dowager Cixi, who was the actual ruler of China.\n\nPuyi lived his childhood in a regime of virtual seclusion in the Forbidden City, surrounded by guards, eunuchs, and other servants who treated him like a god. His upbringing was a mixture of pampering and mistreatment, as he was required to follow all the rules of rigid Chinese imperial protocol and was unable to behave like a normal child.\n\n**Abdication**\n\nOn October 10, 1911, the army garrison in Wuhan mutinied, sparking a widespread revolt in the Yangtze river valley and beyond, demanding the overthrow of the Qing dynasty. Puyi's father, Prince Chun, served as a regent until December 6, when Empress Dowager Longyu took over following the Xinhai Revolution.\n\n**Life in the Forbidden City (1912-1924)**\n\nUnder the \"Articles of Favourable Treatment of the Great Qing Emperor after His Abdication\", signed with the new Republic of China, Puyi was to retain his imperial title and be treated by the government of the Republic with the protocol attached to a foreign monarch. Puyi and the imperial court were allowed to remain in the northern half of the Forbidden City and in the Summer Palace. A hefty annual subsidy of four million silver taels was granted to the imperial household, although it was never fully paid and was abolished after just a few years.\n\n**Brief Restoration (1917)**\n\nIn 1917, the warlord Zhang Xun restored Puyi to the throne from July 1 to 12. Zhang Xun ordered his army to keep their queues to display loyalty to the emperor. However, Premier Duan Qirui ordered a plane to drop bombs over the Forbidden City as a show of force against Zhang Xun, causing the death of a eunuch.\n\n**Relationship with Reginald Johnston**\n\nOn March 3, 1919, Reginald Johnston arrived in the Forbidden City to serve as Puyi's tutor. Johnston believed the monarchy would eventually be restored, and to prepare Puyi for the challenges of the modern world had hired Johnston to teach Puyi subjects such as political science, constitutional history, and English.\n\n**Marriage**\n\nIn March 1922, the Dowager Consorts decided that Puyi should be married. Puyi was given a selection of photographs of aristocratic teenage girls to choose from. Puyi chose Gobulo Wanrong, the daughter of one of Manchuria's richest aristocrats, who had been educated in English by American missionaries in Tianjin.\n\n**Expulsion from the Forbidden City (1924)**\n\nOn October 23, 1924, a coup led by the warlord Feng Yuxiang took control of Beijing. Feng abolished Puyi's imperial title and privileges, reducing him to a private citizen of the Republic of China. Puyi was given three hours to leave the Forbidden City.\n\n**Residence in Tianjin (1925-1931)**\n\nIn February 1925, Puyi moved to the Japanese concession of Tianjin, first into the Zhang Garden, and in 1929 into the Garden of Serenity. Puyi's court was known as a \"doggy paradise\" as Puyi and his wife Wanrong were dog lovers who owned several very spoiled dogs.\n\n**Captive in Manchuria (1931-1932)**\n\nIn September 1931, Puyi sent a letter to Jirō Minami, the Japanese Minister of War, expressing his desire to be restored to the throne. On September 18, 1931, the Mukden Incident began when the Japanese Kwantung Army blew up a section of railroad belonging to the Japanese-owned South Manchurian Railroad company.\n\n**Puppet Rule of Manchukuo (1932-1945)**\n\nPuyi accepted the Japanese offer and on March 1, 1932, was installed as the Chief Executive of Manchukuo, a puppet state of the Empire of Japan. Puyi was crowned Emperor of Manchukuo on March 1, 1934, under the regnal title Kangde.\n\n**Collapse of Manchukuo (1945)**\n\nOn August 9, 1945, the Kwantung Army's commander General Otozō Yamada told Puyi that the Soviet Union had declared war on Japan and the Red Army had entered Manchukuo. The Soviet Union took Puyi to the Siberian town of Chita, where he was treated well and allowed to keep some of his servants.\n\n**Later Life (1945-1967)**\n\nAfter the Chinese Communist Party came to power in 1949, Puyi was repatriated to China after negotiations between the Soviet Union and China. Puyi was subjected to \"remodelling\" to make him into a Communist. However, Puyi's health began to decline, and he died in Beijing on October 17, 1967, at the age of 61.\n\n**Titles, Honours, and Decorations**\n\nPuyi was known as the Xuantong Emperor from 1908 to 1912 and from 1917 to 1924. He was also allowed to retain his title as Emperor of the Great Qing, being treated like a foreign monarch by the Republic of China until November 5, 1924.\n\n**Portrayal in Media**\n\nPuyi's life has been portrayed in various films and television shows, including \"The Last Emperor\" and \"Empress Dowager Cixi\".", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Puyi\" following this outline:\n\n\nEmperor of China (1908–1912)\nChosen by Empress Dowager Cixi, [2] Puyi became emperor at the age of 2 years and 10 months in December 1908 after the Guangxu Emperor, Puyi's half-uncle, died childless on 14 November Titled the Xuantong Emperor, Puyi's introduction to the life of an emperor began when palace officials arrived at his family residence to take him On the evening of 13 November, without any advance notice, a procession of eunuchs and guardsmen led by the palace chamberlain left the Forbidden City for the Northern Mansion to inform Prince Chun that they were taking away his two-year-old son Puyi to be the new emperor The toddler Puyi screamed and resisted as the officials ordered the eunuch attendants to pick him up Puyi's parents said nothing when they learned that they were losing their son As Puyi wept, screaming that he did not want to leave his parents, he was forced into a palanquin that took him to the Forbidden City [3] Wang Lianshou, Puyi's wet nurse, was the only person from the Northern Mansion allowed to go with him [4] Upon arriving at the Forbidden City, Puyi was taken to see Cixi [5] Puyi later wrote:\n\n\nEunuchs and the Household Department\nSeparated from his family, Puyi lived his childhood in a regime of virtual seclusion in the Forbidden City, surrounded by guards, eunuchs and other servants who treated him like a god The emperor's upbringing was a mixture of pampering and mistreatment, as he was required to follow all the rules of rigid Chinese imperial protocol and was unable to behave like a normal child [15] [failed verification – see discussion]\n\n\nAbdication\nOn 10 October 1911, the army garrison in Wuhan mutinied, sparking a widespread revolt in the Yangtze river valley and beyond, demanding the overthrow of the Qing dynasty that had ruled China since 1644 The strongman general Yuan Shikai was dispatched by the court to crush the revolution, but was unable to, as by 1911 public opinion had turned decisively against the Qing, and many Chinese had no wish to fight for a dynasty that was seen as having lost the mandate of heaven [21] Puyi's father, Prince Chun, served as a regent until 6 December, when Empress Dowager Longyu took over following the Xinhai Revolution [22]\n\n\nLife in the Forbidden City (1912–1924)\nUnder the \"Articles of Favourable Treatment of the Great Qing Emperor after His Abdication\", signed with the new Republic of China, Puyi was to retain his imperial title and be treated by the government of the Republic with the protocol attached to a foreign monarch Puyi and the imperial court were allowed to remain in the northern half of the Forbidden City (the Private Apartments) as well as in the Summer Palace A hefty annual subsidy of four million silver taels was granted by the Republic to the imperial household, although it was never fully paid and was abolished after just a few years Puyi was not informed in February 1912 that his reign had ended and China was now a republic, and continued to believe that he was still emperor for some time In 1913, when Empress Dowager Longyu died, President Yuan arrived at the Forbidden City to pay his respects, which Puyi's tutors told him meant that major changes were afoot [25]\n\n\nBrief restoration (1917)\nIn 1917, the warlord Zhang Xun restored Puyi to the throne from 1 to 12 July [27] Zhang Xun ordered his army to keep their queues to display loyalty to the emperor However, then-Premier of the Republic of China Duan Qirui ordered a Caudron Type D plane, piloted by Pan Shizhong (潘世忠) with bombardier Du Yuyuan (杜裕源) from Nanyuan airfield, to drop three bombs over the Forbidden City as a show of force against Zhang Xun, causing the death of a eunuch, but otherwise inflicting minor damage [28] [29] This is the first aerial bombardment recorded by a Chinese Air Force, and the restoration failed due to extensive opposition across China [30]\n\n\nRelationship with Reginald Johnston\nOn 3 March 1919, the Scottish scholar and diplomat Reginald Johnston arrived in the Forbidden City to serve as Puyi's tutor [31] President Xu Shichang believed the monarchy would eventually be restored, and to prepare Puyi for the challenges of the modern world had hired Johnston to teach Puyi \"subjects such as political science, constitutional history and English\" [32] Johnston was allowed only five texts in English to give Puyi to read: Alice in Wonderland and translations into English of the \"Four Great Books\" of Confucianism; the Analects, the Mencius, the Great Learning and the Doctrine of the Mean [32] But he disregarded the rules, and taught Puyi about world history with a special focus on British history [33] Besides history, Johnston taught Puyi philosophy and about what he saw as the superiority of monarchies to republics [33] Puyi remembered that his tutor's piercing blue eyes \"made me feel uneasy .. I found him very intimidating and studied English with him like a good boy, not daring to talk about other things when I got bored .. as I did with my other Chinese tutors\" [31]\n\n\nMarriage\nIn March 1922, the Dowager Consorts decided that Puyi should be married, and gave him a selection of photographs of aristocratic teenage girls to choose from Puyi first chose Erdet Wenxiu as his wife, but was told that she was acceptable only as a concubine, so he would have to choose again Puyi later claimed that the faces were too small to distinguish between [48] Puyi then chose Gobulo Wanrong, the daughter of one of Manchuria's richest aristocrats, who had been educated in English by American missionaries in Tianjin, who was considered to be an acceptable empress by the Dowager Consorts On 15 March 1922, the betrothal of Puyi and Wanrong was announced in the newspapers On 17 March, Wanrong took the train to Beijing, and on 6 April, Puyi went to the Qing family shrine to inform his ancestors that he would be married to her later that year Puyi did not meet Wanrong until their wedding [49]\n\n\nExpulsion from the Forbidden City (1924)\nOn 23 October 1924, a coup led by the warlord Feng Yuxiang took control of Beijing Feng, the latest of the warlords to take Beijing, was seeking legitimacy and decided that abolishing the unpopular Articles of Favourable Settlement was an easy way to win the crowd's approval [67] Feng unilaterally revised the \"Articles of Favourable Treatment\" on 5 November 1924, abolishing Puyi's imperial title and privileges and reducing him to a private citizen of the Republic of China Puyi was expelled from the Forbidden City the same day [68] He was given three hours to leave [67] He spent a few days at the house of his father Prince Chun, and then temporarily resided in the Japanese embassy in Beijing [69] Puyi left his father's house together with Johnston and his chief servant Big Li without informing Prince Chun's servants, slipped his followers, and went to the Japanese legation Puyi had originally wanted to go to the British Legation, but Johnston had insisted that he would be safer with the Japanese For Johnston, the system where the Japanese people worshipped their emperor as a living god was much closer to his ideal than the British constitutional monarchy, and he constantly steered Puyi in a pro-Japanese direction [70]\n\n\nResidence in Tianjin (1925–1931)\nIn February 1925, Puyi moved to the Japanese concession of Tianjin, first into the Zhang Garden, and in 1929 [75] into the former residence of Lu Zongyu known as the Garden of Serenity [76] A British journalist, Henry Woodhead, called Puyi's court a \"doggy paradise\" as both Puyi and Wanrong were dog lovers who owned several very spoiled dogs while Puyi's courtiers spent an inordinate amount of time feuding with one another [77] Woodhead stated that the only people who seemed to get along at Puyi's court were Wanrong and Wenxiu, who were \"like sisters\" [78] Tianjin was, after Shanghai, the most cosmopolitan Chinese city, with large British, French, German, Russian and Japanese communities As an emperor, Puyi was allowed to join several social clubs that normally only admitted whites During this period, Puyi and his advisers Chen Baochen, Zheng Xiaoxu, and Luo Zhenyu discussed plans to restore Puyi as Emperor Zheng and Luo favoured enlisting assistance from external parties, while Chen opposed the idea In June 1925, the warlord Zhang Zuolin visited Tianjin to meet Puyi \"Old Marshal\" Zhang, an illiterate former bandit, ruled Manchuria, a region equal in size to Germany and France combined, which had a population of 30 million and was the most industrialised region in China Zhang kowtowed to Puyi at their meeting and promised to restore the House of Qing if Puyi made a large financial donation to his army Zhang warned Puyi in a \"roundabout way\" not to trust his Japanese friends Zhang fought in the pay of the Japanese, but by this time his relations with the Kwantung Army were becoming strained In June 1927, Zhang captured Beijing and Behr observed that if Puyi had had more courage and returned to Beijing, he might have been restored to the Dragon Throne [79] Puyi was noted to have said in a 1927 article in The Illustrated London News, that \"I never wish to be Emperor again\" [80]\n\n\nCaptive in Manchuria (1931–1932)\nIn September 1931, Puyi sent a letter to Jirō Minami, the Japanese Minister of War, expressing his desire to be restored to the throne [92] On the night of 18 September 1931, the Mukden Incident began when the Japanese Kwantung Army blew up a section of railroad belonging to the Japanese-owned South Manchurian Railroad company and blamed the warlord Marshal Zhang Xueliang [93] On this pretext the Kwantung Army began a general offensive with the aim of conquering all of Manchuria [94] Puyi was visited by Kenji Doihara, head of the espionage office of the Japanese Kwantung Army, who proposed establishing Puyi as head of a Manchurian state The Japanese further bribed a café worker to tell Puyi that a contract was out on his life in an attempt to frighten Puyi into moving [95]\n\n\nPuppet rule of Manchukuo (1932–1945)\nPuyi accepted the Japanese offer and on 1 March 1932 was installed as the Chief Executive of Manchukuo, a puppet state of the Empire of Japan, under the era name Datong One contemporary commentator, Wen Yuan-ning, quipped that Puyi had now achieved the dubious distinction of having been \"made emperor three times without knowing why and apparently without relishing it.\" [103]\n\n\nAs emperor of Manchukuo\nOn 1 March 1934, he was crowned Emperor of Manchukuo, under the regnal title Kangde in Changchun A sign of the true rulers of Manchukuo was the presence of General Masahiko Amakasu during the coronation; ostensibly there as the film director to record the coronation, Amakasu served as Puyi's minder, keeping a careful watch on him to prevent him from going off script [120] Wanrong was excluded from the coronation: her addiction to opium, anti-Japanese feelings, dislike of Puyi, and growing reputation for being \"difficult\" and unpredictable led Amakasu to the conclusion that she could not be trusted to behave [121] Though submissive in public to the Japanese, Puyi was constantly at odds with them in private He resented being \"Head of State\" and then \"Emperor of Manchukuo\" rather than being fully restored as a Qing Emperor At his enthronement, he clashed with Japan over dress; they wanted him to wear a military uniform like those used by the Manchukuo military, whereas he considered it an insult to wear anything but traditional Manchu robes In a typical compromise, he wore a Western military uniform to his enthronement [122] (the only Chinese emperor ever to do so) and a dragon robe to the announcement of his accession at the Temple of Heaven [123] Puyi was driven to his coronation in a Lincoln limousine with bulletproof windows followed by nine Packards, and during his coronation scrolls were read out while sacred wine bottles were opened for the guests to celebrate the beginning of a \"Reign of Tranquillity and Virtue\" [124] The invitations for the coronation were issued by the Kwantung Army and 70% of those who attended Puyi's coronation were Japanese [121] Time magazine published an article about Puyi's coronation in March 1934 [125]\n\n\nCollapse of Manchukuo\nOn 9 August 1945, the Kwantung Army's commander General Otozō Yamada told Puyi that the Soviet Union had declared war on Japan and the Red Army had entered Manchukuo Yamada was assuring Puyi that the Kwantung Army would easily defeat the Red Army, when the air raid sirens sounded and the Red Air Force began a bombing raid, forcing all to hide in the basement While Puyi prayed to the Buddha, Yamada fell silent as the bombs fell, destroying Japanese barracks next to the Salt Tax Palace [181] In the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation, 1,577,725 Soviet and Mongol troops stormed into Manchuria in a combined arms offensive with tanks, artillery, cavalry, aircraft and infantry working closely together that overwhelmed the Kwantung Army, who had not expected a Soviet invasion until 1946 and were short of both tanks and anti-tank guns [182]\n\n\nLater life (1945–1967)\nThe Soviets took Puyi to the Siberian town of Chita He lived in a sanatorium, then later in Khabarovsk near the Chinese border, where he was treated well and allowed to keep some of his servants As a prisoner, Puyi spent his days praying and expected the prisoners to treat him as an emperor and slapped the faces of his servants when they displeased him [192]\n\n\nSoviet imprisonment and trial\nThe Soviets took Puyi to the Siberian town of Chita He lived in a sanatorium, then later in Khabarovsk near the Chinese border, where he was treated well and allowed to keep some of his servants As a prisoner, Puyi spent his days praying and expected the prisoners to treat him as an emperor and slapped the faces of his servants when they displeased him [192]\n\n\nIn the People's Republic\nAfter the Chinese Communist Party came to power in 1949, Puyi was repatriated to China after negotiations between the Soviet Union and China [200] [201] Puyi was of considerable value to Mao, as Behr noted: \"In the eyes of Mao and other Chinese Communist leaders, Pu Yi, the last Emperor, was the epitome of all that had been evil in old Chinese society If he could be shown to have undergone sincere, permanent change, what hope was there for the most diehard counter-revolutionary? The more overwhelming the guilt, the more spectacular the redemption-and the greater glory of the Chinese Communist Party.\" [202] Puyi was to be subjected to \"remodelling\" to make him into a Communist [203]\n\n\nContinued imprisonment\nAfter the Chinese Communist Party came to power in 1949, Puyi was repatriated to China after negotiations between the Soviet Union and China [200] [201] Puyi was of considerable value to Mao, as Behr noted: \"In the eyes of Mao and other Chinese Communist leaders, Pu Yi, the last Emperor, was the epitome of all that had been evil in old Chinese society If he could be shown to have undergone sincere, permanent change, what hope was there for the most diehard counter-revolutionary? The more overwhelming the guilt, the more spectacular the redemption-and the greater glory of the Chinese Communist Party.\" [202] Puyi was to be subjected to \"remodelling\" to make him into a Communist [203]\n\n\nRelease\nPuyi came to Beijing on 9 December 1959 with special permission from Mao and lived for the next six months in an ordinary Beijing residence with his sister before being transferred to a government-sponsored hotel He had the job of sweeping the streets, and got lost on his first day of work, which led him to tell astonished passers-by: \"I'm Puyi, the last Emperor of the Qing dynasty I'm staying with relatives and can't find my way home\" [213] One of Puyi's first acts upon returning to Beijing was to visit the Forbidden City as a tourist; he pointed out to other tourists that many of the exhibits were the things he had used in his youth He voiced his support for the Communists and worked as a gardener at the Beijing Botanical Gardens The role brought Puyi a degree of happiness he had never known as an emperor, though he was notably clumsy [214]\n\n\nDeath\nThe Cultural Revolution broke out in 1966, and the Red Guards that had been encouraged by Mao saw Puyi, who symbolised imperial China, as an easy target Puyi was placed under protection by the local public security bureau and, although his food rations, salary, and various luxuries, including his sofa and desk, were removed, he was not publicly humiliated as was common at the time The Red Guards attacked Puyi for his book From Emperor to Citizen because it had been translated into English and French, which displeased the Red Guards and led to copies of the book being burned in the streets Various members of the Qing family, including Pujie, had their homes raided and burned by Red Guards, but Zhou Enlai used his influence to protect Puyi and the rest of the Qing from the worst abuses inflicted by the Red Guard Jin Yuan, the man who had \"remodelled\" Puyi in the 1950s, fell victim to the Red Guard and became a prisoner in Fushun for several years, while Li Wenda, who had ghostwritten From Emperor to Citizen, spent seven years in solitary confinement [225] However, Puyi's health began to decline He died in Beijing of complications arising from kidney cancer and heart disease on 17 October 1967 at the age of 61 [226]\n\n\nTitles, honours, and decorations\nWhen he ruled as emperor of the Qing dynasty (and therefore emperor of China) from 1908 to 1912 and during his brief restoration in 1917, Puyi's era name was \"Xuantong\", so he was known as the \"Xuantong Emperor\" (simplified Chinese: 宣统皇帝; traditional Chinese: 宣統皇帝; pinyin: Xuāntǒng Huángdì; Wade–Giles: Hsüan1-t'ung3 Huang2-ti4) during those two periods Puyi was also allowed to retain his title as Emperor of the Great Qing, being treated like a foreign monarch by the Republic of China until 5 November 1924.\n\n\nTitles\nWhen he ruled as emperor of the Qing dynasty (and therefore emperor of China) from 1908 to 1912 and during his brief restoration in 1917, Puyi's era name was \"Xuantong\", so he was known as the \"Xuantong Emperor\" (simplified Chinese: 宣统皇帝;

[11] After initially forecasting an expenditure of €40-50 million, the Veneto Region allocated funding up to €85 million to build the new Olympic venues An annual expenditure of €400,000 was also

Baldwin has also been in the public eye for her personal life, including a high-profile relationship with rapper Angel Haze.\n\n### Early Life\n\nIreland Baldwin was born on October 5, 1995, in Los Angeles, California, to actors Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger. Her parents' marriage ended in divorce when Ireland was just a child, and she has since had several half-siblings through her father's second marriage. Baldwin's uncle is actor Stephen Baldwin, and her cousins include model Hailey Bieber. Her early life was marked by a close-knit family and a strong sense of identity. Baldwin has spoken publicly about the challenges of growing up in a family of actors, saying that she often felt like she was \"losing herself\" in the process.\n\n### Career\n\nBaldwin's career as a model began in 2013, when she signed with IMG Models in March of that year. Her first major modeling gig was a swimwear editorial for the New York Post in April 2013. The editorial was a huge success, and Baldwin soon found herself in high demand. In May 2013, she appeared in W Magazine's It Trend, It Girl feature, which further solidified her status as a rising star in the fashion world. In June 2013, Baldwin was named Vanity Fair's It Girl, photographed by Patrick Demarchelier. This marked a major milestone in her career, as it solidified her status as a leading model in the industry.\n\nIn July 2013, Baldwin made her magazine cover debut, appearing on the cover of Modern Luxury's Beach issue. The cover was a white bikini shot that showcased her physique and style. In September 2013, Elle magazine interviewed Baldwin, featuring her in a editorial spread photographed by Thomas Whiteside and styled by Joe Zee. This marked a major turning point in her career, as it cemented her status as a leading model and fashion icon. Later in 2013, Baldwin appeared in an editorial for DuJour magazine, photographed by Bruce Weber.\n\n### Acting Career\n\nIn addition to her successful modeling career, Baldwin has also begun to make a name for herself as an actress. Her acting debut came in 2013, when she appeared in the film Grudge Match. In the film, Baldwin played a younger version of Kim Basinger's character, Sally. The film was a comedy-drama that starred Robert De Niro and Sylvester Stallone, and Baldwin's performance was well-received by critics.\n\n### Personal Life\n\nBaldwin's personal life has also been the subject of much attention in the media. In 2014, she was in a high-profile relationship with rapper Angel Haze. The two were together for several months before breaking up in 2015. After the breakup, Baldwin checked herself into Malibu's Soba Recovery Center for \"emotional trauma.\" The relationship between Baldwin and Haze was a tumultuous one, marked by public feuds and social media drama. Despite their breakup, the two have remained friends and have even collaborated on music projects together.\n\nIn 2015, Haze released a song called \"Candlxs\" that was dedicated to Baldwin. The song's lyrics were a heartfelt tribute to their relationship, and the music video featured footage of the two together. The song was a major hit, and it solidified Haze's status as a rising star in the music industry.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Ireland_Baldwin\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nBaldwin was born in Los Angeles to actors Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger [2] She is also the niece of actors Stephen, Daniel, and William Baldwin and cousin to model Hailey Bieber She has three younger half-sisters (Carmen, Lucia, and Ilaria) as well as four half-brothers (Rafael, Leonardo, Romeo, and Eduardo) through her father's second marriage [6]\n\n\nCareer\nBaldwin signed with IMG Models in March 2013 [8] In April, she made her modeling debut in a swimwear editorial for the New York Post [9] [10] In May, Baldwin appeared in W Magazine's It Trend, It Girl feature [11] Baldwin was Vanity Fair's It Girl in June, photographed by Patrick Demarchelier [12] Her first magazine cover appearance was for Modern Luxury's second issue of Beach in July, appearing in a white bikini [13] Elle interviewed Baldwin in its September 2013 issue [14] [15] The editorial accompanying the interview was photographed by Thomas Whiteside and styled by Joe Zee [16] She appeared in an editorial for DuJour magazine, photographed by Bruce Weber [17] Baldwin made her acting debut in the film Grudge Match, playing a younger version of Kim Basinger's character, Sally [3]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn 2014, Baldwin was in a relationship with rapper Angel Haze [27] In 2015, Haze devoted their track \"Candlxs\" to Baldwin; the cover art depicting Baldwin and Haze was painted by Haze Several months later Baldwin ended the relationship before checking herself into Malibu's Soba Recovery Center for \"emotional trauma\" [28]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This adaptation is thought to have occurred independently in multiple groups of decapod crustaceans.\n\n**Definition of Carcinised Morphology**\n\nLancelot Alexander Borradaile, a British zoologist, first proposed the concept of carcinisation in 1916. He observed that certain crustaceans, such as crabs, had evolved a body shape that was distinct from their more primitive, asymmetrical ancestors. This new body shape, characterized by a broad, flat body and a short, broad tail, was thought to be an adaptation to a more sedentary lifestyle.\n\n**Examples**\n\nCarcinisation is believed to have occurred independently in at least five groups of decapod crustaceans. One of the most well-studied examples is the evolution of king crabs (family Lithodidae) from hermit crabs. Hermit crabs are asymmetrical and fit well into spiral snail shells, but king crabs, despite not using snail shells for shelter, have also evolved asymmetrical abdomens.\n\n**Hypercarcinisation**\n\nAn exceptional form of carcinisation is seen in the porcelain crab Allopetrolisthes spinifrons. In addition to the shortened body form, A. spinifrons also shows similar sexual dimorphism to that seen in true crabs, where males have a shorter pleon than females.\n\n**Selective Pressures and Benefits**\n\nIndependently arising from multiple ancestral crustacean taxa, the crab-like traits exhibited vary between individual species and taxa. However, all crabs and carcinised organisms are decapods. Correlations between the folding of the pleon tail and widening of the cephalothorax across disparate decapod species suggest similar evolutionary pressures. Some occurrences of carcinisation are derived from convergent but distinct developmental pathways, while others may be instances of homologous parallelism from shared ancestral body plans.\n\n**Evolutionary Tradeoffs**\n\nThe caridoid escape reaction is an innate danger response in crustaceans such as lobsters and crayfish, which contracts abdominal flexions and sends the crustacean flying backward in the water. However, in crabs and false crabs, which have undergone carcinisation, the necessary muscles are no longer developed enough to facilitate this evasion strategy. Instead, they are best suited to escape by ground pursuit.\n\n**Coconut Crabs (Birgus latro)**\n\nWhile most incidences of carcinisation are in aquatic Anomura populations, it has evolved in the planet's largest land-dwelling invertebrate, the coconut crab. A number of true crab-like features, such as a wide carapace, and a low abdomen with strong supporting legs, allow these crustaceans to wield muscular claws and manipulate their terrestrial environments with greater ease. The lack of an extended pleon greatly benefits their mobility.\n\n**Decarcinisation**\n\nSome crab-shaped species have evolved away from the crab form in a process called decarcinisation. Decarcinisation, or the loss of the crab-like body, has occurred multiple times in both Brachyura and Anomura. However, there are varying degrees of carcinisation and decarcinisation. Thus, not all species can necessarily be distinctly classified as \"carcinised\" or \"decarcinised\".\n\n**Semi-Carcinisation**\n\nSome species, such as the coconut crab, have retained their crab-like phenotype but have reduced or lost their outer casing, often referred to as \"domiciles\". This necessitates a \"semi-carcinised\" label.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCarcinisation is a complex and multifaceted process of evolutionary adaptation that has occurred independently in multiple groups of decapod crustaceans. The crab-like morphology that has resulted from this process is thought to be an adaptation to a more sedentary lifestyle, but it has also brought about tradeoffs in terms of the loss of the caridoid escape reaction. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms and selective pressures that have driven the evolution of carcinisation in these species.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Carcinisation\" following this outline:\n\n\nDefinition of carcinised morphology\nIt was stated by Lancelot Alexander Borradaile in 1916 that: [3]\n\n\nExamples\nCarcinisation is believed to have occurred independently in at least five groups of decapod crustaceans: [4]\n\n\nKing crabs\nThe example of king crabs (family Lithodidae) evolving from hermit crabs has been particularly well studied, and evidence in their biology supports this theory For example, most hermit crabs are asymmetrical, and fit well into spiral snail shells; the abdomens of king crabs, even though they do not use snail shells for shelter, are also asymmetrical [13] [14] [15] [16]\n\n\nHypercarcinisation\nAn exceptional form of carcinisation, termed \"hypercarcinisation\", is seen in the porcelain crab Allopetrolisthes spinifrons In addition to the shortened body form, A spinifrons also shows similar sexual dimorphism to that seen in true crabs, where males have a shorter pleon than females [17]\n\n\nSelective pressures and benefits\nIndependently arising from multiple ancestral crustacean taxa, the crab-like traits exhibited vary between individual species and taxa However, all crabs and carcinised organisms are decapods Correlations between the folding of the pleon tail and widening of the cephalothorax across disparate decapod species suggest similar evolutionary pressures Some occurrences of carcinisation are derived from convergent but distinct developmental pathways, while others may be instances of homologous parallelism [15] from shared ancestral body plans.\n\n\nEvolutionary tradeoffs\nThe caridoid escape reaction is an innate danger response in crustaceans such as lobsters and crayfish, which contracts abdominal flexions and sends the crustacean flying backward in the water [21] Brachyura and species which have undergone carcinization have strongly bent and immobile tails, which prevent them from using this evasion strategy The necessary muscles are no longer developed enough in these species to facilitate the necessary tail flipping Crabs and false crabs are best suited to escape by ground pursuit in comparison to the quick aquatic escape provided by the caridoid escape reaction.\n\n\nCoconut crabs (Birgus latro)\nWhile most incidences of carcinization are in aquatic Anomura populations, it has evolved in the planet’s largest land-dwelling invertebrate, Coconut crabs A number of true crab-like features, such as a wide carapace, and a low abdomen with strong supporting legs, allow these crustaceans to wield muscular claws and manipulate their terrestrial environments with greater ease [22] The lack of an extended pleon greatly benefits their mobility In this case, brachyuraform traits accommodate comfortable terrestrial locomotion and are far more pronounced in maturity, after the larval and post-larval stages which remain obligatorily aquatic [23] The repeated emergence of carcinised morphological structures suggests selective pressures in various Anomura niches and habitus often favor carcinization, though this may fluctuate and is sometimes reversed by the opposite process of decarcinisation [24]\n\n\nDecarcinisation\nSome crab-shaped species have evolved away from the crab form in a process called decarcinisation Decarcinisation, or the loss of the crab-like body, has occurred multiple times in both Brachyura and Anomura [25] [26] However, there are varying degrees of carcinisation and decarcinisation Thus, not all species can necessarily be distinctly classified as \"carcinised\" or \"decarcinised\" Some examples include the coconut crab, as well as other hermit crabs, that have lost or reduced their outer casing, often referred to as \"domiciles\" While they retain their crab-like phenotype, their reduction in or lack of domicile necessitates a \"semi-carcinised\" label.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "The_Legend_of_Zelda", "content": "\nGameplay\nGameplay of The Legend of Zelda games feature a mix of puzzles, action-adventure, and exploration These elements have remained constant throughout the series, with refinements and additions featured in each new game Later games in the series include stealth gameplay, where the player must avoid enemies while proceeding through a level, as well as racing elements Although the games can be beaten with a minimal amount of exploration and side quests, the player is frequently rewarded with helpful items or increased abilities for solving puzzles or exploring hidden areas Some items are consistent and appear many times throughout the series (such as bombs and bomb flowers, which can be used both as weapons and to open blocked or hidden doorways; boomerangs, which can kill or paralyze enemies; keys for locked doors; magic swords, shields, and bows and arrows), while others are unique to a single game Though the games contain role-playing elements (Zelda II: The Adventure of Link is the only one to include an experience system), they emphasize straightforward hack-and-slash-style combat over the strategic, turn-based or active time combat of series like Final Fantasy The game's role-playing elements, however, have led to much debate over whether or not the Zelda games should be classified as action role-playing games, a genre on which the series has had a strong influence [1] Miyamoto himself disagreed with the role-playing label, and classified Zelda as \"a real-time adventure game\"; he said he was \"not interested in systems where everything in the game is decided by stats and numbers\" but what's \"important to me is to preserve as much of that \"live\" feeling as possible\" which he said \"action games are better suited in conveying\" to players [2]\n\n\nInspiration\nThe Legend of Zelda was principally inspired by Shigeru Miyamoto's \"explorations\" as a young boy in the hillsides, forests, and caves surrounding his childhood home in Sonobe, Japan where he ventured into forests with secluded lakes, caves, and rural villages According to Miyamoto, one of his most memorable experiences was the discovery of a cave entrance in the middle of the woods [3] After some hesitation, he apprehensively entered the cave, and explored its depths with the aid of a lantern Miyamoto has referred to the creation of the Zelda games as an attempt to bring to life a \"miniature garden\" for players to play with in each game of the series [4]\n\n\nAudio\nGames in The Legend of Zelda series frequently feature in-game musical instruments, particularly in musical puzzles, which are widespread [19] Often, instruments trigger game events: for example, the recorder in The Legend of Zelda can reveal secret areas, as well as warp Link to the dungeon entrances This warping with music feature has also been used in A Link to the Past and Link's Awakening In Ocarina of Time, playing instruments is a core part of the game, with the player needing to play the instrument through the use of the game controller to succeed [20] Ocarina of Time is \" [one of the] first contemporary non-dance title [s] to feature music-making as part of its gameplay\", [21] using music as a heuristic device and requiring the player to utilise songs to progress in the game [22] – a game mechanic that is also present in Majora's Mask [23]\n\n\nPlot\nThe Legend of Zelda takes place predominantly in a medieval Western Europe-inspired fantasy world called Hyrule, [27] [28] which has developed a deep history and wide geography over the series's many releases Much of the backstory of the creation of Hyrule was revealed in the games A Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, The Wind Waker, Twilight Princess, Skyward Sword, and A Link Between Worlds Hyrule's principal inhabitants are pointy-eared, elf-like humanoids called Hylians, which include the player character, Link, and the eponymous princess, Zelda.\n\n\nSetting\nThe Legend of Zelda takes place predominantly in a medieval Western Europe-inspired fantasy world called Hyrule, [27] [28] which has developed a deep history

Skyward Sword, and A Link Between Worlds Hyrule's principal inhabitants are pointy-eared, elf-like humanoids called Hylians, which include the player character, Link, and the eponymous princess, Zelda.\n\n\nStory\nAccording to the in-game backstories, the world of Hyrule was created by the three golden goddesses: Din, Farore, and Nayru [32] Before departing, the goddesses left a sacred artifact called the Triforce, which could grant powers to the user It physically manifests itself as three golden triangles in which each embodies one of the goddesses' virtues: Power, Courage, and Wisdom [33] However, because the Triforce has no will of its own and it can not judge between good and evil, it will grant any wish indiscriminately [34] [35] Because of this, it was placed within an alternate world called the \"Sacred Realm\" or the \"Golden Land\" until one worthy of its power and has balanced virtues of Power, Wisdom, and Courage in their heart could obtain it, in its entirety If a person is not of a balanced heart, the triforce part that the user mostly believes in will stay with that person and the remainder will seek out others In order to master and control the triforce as a whole, the user must get the other parts found in other individuals and bring them together to reunite them The Sacred Realm can itself be affected by the heart of those who enter it: those who are pure will make it a paradise, while those who are evil will transform it into a dark realm [36]\n\n\nFictional chronology\nThe chronology of the Legend of Zelda series was a subject of much debate among fans until an official timeline was released within the Hyrule Historia collector's book, first released in Japan in December 2011 [45] [46] Prior to its release, in a 2003 interview, series creator Shigeru Miyamoto confirmed the existence of an internal document which connected all the games, with series producer Eiji Aonuma later revealing in 2010 the confidential nature of this document, which only Miyamoto himself and the director of each game had access to [47] [48]\n\n\nCharacters\nThe central protagonist of The Legend of Zelda series, Link is the name of various young male Hylians who characteristically wear a green tunic and a pointed cap, and are the bearers of the Triforce of Courage In most games, the player can give Link a different name before the start of the adventure, and he will be referred by that given name throughout by the non-player characters (NPCs) Miyamoto said in a 2002 interview that he named the protagonist \"Link\" because the character is/was supposed to be the \"link\" between the player and the game world The various Links each have a special title, such as \"Hero of Time\", \"Hero of the Winds\" or \"Hero chosen by the gods\" Like many silent protagonists in video games, Link does not speak, only producing grunts, yells, etc Despite the player not seeing the dialogue, it is referenced second-hand by in-game characters, showing that he is not, in fact, mute Link is shown as a silent protagonist so that the audience is able to have their own thoughts as to how their Link would answer the characters instead of him having scripted responses.\n\n\nLink\nThe central protagonist of The Legend of Zelda series, Link is the name of various young male Hylians who characteristically wear a green tunic and a pointed cap,

of Hyrule and the guardian of the Triforce of Wisdom Her name is present in many of her female ancestors and descendants While most games require Link to save Zelda from Ganon, she sometimes plays a supporting role in battle, using magical powers and weapons such as Light Arrows to aid Link With the exception of the CD-i games, she was not playable in the main series until Spirit Tracks, where she becomes a spirit and can possess a Phantom Knight that can be controlled by the player Zelda appears under various other aliases and alter egos, including Sheik (in Ocarina of Time) and Tetra (in The Wind Waker and Phantom Hourglass) In Skyward Sword, it is revealed that the Zelda of that game is a reincarnation of the goddess Hylia, whose power flows through the royal bloodline The name \"Zelda\" derives from the American novelist Zelda Fitzgerald [74]\n\n\nGanon\nGanon, also known as Ganondorf in his humanoid form, is the main antagonist and the final boss in the majority of The Legend of Zelda games In the series, Ganondorf is the leader of a race of desert brigands called the Gerudo, which consists entirely of female warriors save for one man born every one hundred years He is significantly taller than other human NPCs, but his looks vary between games, often taking the form of a monstrous anthropomorphic boar His specific motives vary from game to game, but most often his plans include him kidnapping Princess Zelda and planning to achieve domination of Hyrule and presumably the world beyond it To this end, he seeks the Triforce, a powerful magical relic He often possesses a portion of the Triforce called the Triforce of Power, which gives him great strength However, it is often not enough to accomplish his ends, leading him to hunt the remaining Triforce pieces Unlike Link, Zelda, and most other recurring characters, he is actually the same person in every game, with the exception of Four Swords Adventures, where he is a reincarnation of the original In each game the battles with him are different and he fights using different styles The game Skyward Sword indicates that Ganon is a reincarnation of an evil deity known as Demise.\n\n\nDevelopment\nThe Legend of Zelda, the first game of the series, was first released in Japan on February 21, 1986, on the Famicom Disk System [75] A cartridge version for the Nintendo Entertainment System, using battery-backed memory, was released in the United States on August 22, 1987, and in Europe on November 27, 1987 The game features a \"Second Quest\", accessible either upon completing the game, or by registering one's name as \"ZELDA\" when starting a new quest The \"Second Quest\" features different dungeons and item placement, and more difficult enemies [76] A modified version of the original Famicom game, BS Zelda no Densetsu, was released for the Super Famicom's satellite-based expansion, Satellaview, on August 6, 1995, in Japan A second Satellaview game, BS Zelda no Densetsu MAP2 was released for the Satellaview on December 30 the same year Both games featured rearranged dungeons, an altered overworld, and new voice-acted plot-lines [77]\n\n\n1986–1997: 2D origins\nThe Legend of Zelda, the first game of the series, was first released in Japan on February 21, 1986, on the Famicom Disk System [75] A cartridge version for the Nintendo Entertainment System, using battery-backed memory, was released in the United States on August 22, 1987, and in Europe on November 27, 1987 The game features a \"Second Quest\", accessible either upon completing the game,

MAP2 was released for the Satellaview on December 30 the same year Both games featured rearranged dungeons, an altered overworld, and new voice-acted plot-lines [77]\n\n\n1998–2001: Transition to 3D\nAfter five years without a new game, the series made the transition to 3D with Ocarina of Time for the Nintendo 64, which was released in November 1998 This game, initially known as Zelda 64, retains the core gameplay of the previous 2D games, and was very successful commercially and critically, considered by many critics and gamers to be the best video game of all time, and ranking highly on IGN and EGM's \"greatest games of all time\" lists, as well as scoring perfect scores in several video game publications [84] In February 2006, it was ranked by Nintendo Power as the best game released for a Nintendo console [85] The game was originally developed for the poorly selling, Japanese-only 64DD, but was converted to cartridge format when the 64DD hardware was delayed [86] A new gameplay mechanic, lock-on targeting, is used in the game, which focuses the camera on a nearby target and alters the player's actions relative to that target [87] Such mechanics allow precise sword fighting in a 3D space The game heavily uses context-sensitive button play, which enabled the player to control various actions with Link using only one button on the Nintendo 64's controller Each action was handled slightly differently but all used the 'A' button to perform For instance, standing next to a block and pressing 'A' made Link grab it (enabling him to push/pull it), but moving forwards into a block and pressing 'A' allowed Link to climb the block The game featured the first appearance of Link's horse, Epona, allowing Link to travel quickly across land and fire arrows from horseback Those who preordered the game received a gold-colored cartridge in a limited edition box with a golden plastic card affixed, reading \"Collector's Edition\" [88] In some stores that had this \"Collector's Edition\" quickly sell out, a small and rare Zelda pin was given instead It is the sword and shield emblem with \"Zelda\" written on it Very few of them are known to remain Ocarina of Time was re-released on the GameCube in 2002, when it was offered as a pre-order incentive for The Wind Waker in the U.S., Canada and Japan [89] It includes the cancelled 64DD expansion for Ocarina of Time known as Ura Zelda during development Named Ocarina of Time Master Quest, the game was given reorganized dungeon layouts for greater difficulty [89] [90] Europe continued to receive this \"Two-Game Bonus Disc\" free in every copy of The Wind Waker, except for the discounted Player's Choice version Ocarina of Time was available through the Wii's Virtual Console service [91] Nintendo re-released it for the Wii U Virtual Console in July 2015 Ocarina of Time 3D for the 3DS, featuring remade graphics and stereoscopic 3D, was released in mid-June 2011 Ocarina of Time has been made available on the higher tier of Nintendo Switch Online in HD resolution.\n\n\n2002–2005: Introduction of Toon Link and multiplayer\nThe Game Boy Advance release of A Link to the Past in 2002 featured a new game, Four Swords, [75] the first multiplayer Zelda This game introduced Toon Link, a name first used in Super Smash Bros Brawl to refer to cartoon-based visual designs of Link Four Swords Anniversary Edition [100] was released on September 28, 2011, as free DSiWare available until February 20, 2012.\n\n\n2006–2011: Motion and touch-based swordplay\nIn November 2006, Twilight Princess was released as the first Zelda game on the Wii, and later in December as the last Nintendo-published game for the GameCube, the console for which it was originally developed The Wii version features motion controls and a reversed world where everything that is in the west on the GameCube is in the east on the Wii The display is mirrored in order to make Link right-handed to make use of the Wii Remote feel more natural for the majority of players The game chronicles the struggle of a young adult Link to confront the troubles of the \"Twilight Realm\", a mysterious force that appears around and interacts with Hyrule When he enters this realm, he is transformed into a wolf, and loses the ability to use his sword, shield or other items, but gains other abilities such as sharpened senses from his new form Twilight Princess includes an incarnation of Link's horse, Epona, for fast transportation, and features mounted battle scenarios including boss battles that were not seen in previous games Twilight Princess diverted from the cel-shading of Wind Waker, integrating graphics featuring more detailed textures, giving the game a darker atmosphere The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD released for Wii U in 2016 [106]\n\n\n2013–present: Open-world emphasis\nIn 2013, Nintendo released A Link Between Worlds for the Nintendo 3DS, a sequel to A Link to the Past [111] [112] Progression is more open-ended than previous titles, with the possibility of completing many of the game's dungeons in any order Certain dungeon obstacles require the use of rented or purchased items.\n\n\nOther games\nThroughout the lifespan of The Legend of Zelda series, a number of games (including main series games as well as re-releases and spin-offs) in varying states of completeness have had their releases cancelled Perhaps the earliest of these was Gottlieb's The Legend of Zelda Pinball Machine (cancelled 1993) After securing a license from Nintendo to produce two Nintendo-franchise-based pinball machines, pinball designer Jon Norris was tasked with designing the table Before it was completed, Gottlieb decided to repurpose the game with an American Gladiators theme Licensing for this version ultimately fell through and the game was released as simply Gladiators (November 1993) [121]\n\n\nCancelled games\nThroughout the lifespan of The Legend of Zelda

universe of The Legend of Zelda but are not directly connected to the main The Legend of Zelda series Both map versions of the game BS Zelda no Densetsu for the Satellaview (released in August and December 1995) could be considered spin-offs due to the fact that they star the \"Hero of Light\" (portrayed by either the Satellaview's male or female avatar) as opposed to Link as the protagonist of Hyrule [citation needed] A third Satellaview game released in March 1997, BS Zelda no Densetsu Inishie no Sekiban (BS The Legend of Zelda: Ancient Stone Tablets) could also be considered a spin-off for the same reason [citation needed] Other spin-off games include Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland for the Nintendo DS, an RPG released in September 2006 in Japan (Summer of 2007 in the UK) to star supporting character Tingle A second Tingle game is Tingle's Balloon Fight DS for the Nintendo DS Here Tingle again stars in this spin-off arcade style platformer, released in April 2007 only in Japan and available solely to Platinum Club Nintendo members.\n\n\nReception\nThe Legend of Zelda series has received outstanding levels of acclaim from critics and the public Ocarina of Time, Skyward Sword, Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom have each received a perfect 10/10 score by British Edge magazine [208] All four plus Wind Waker also received a 40/40 score (10/10 by four

its brilliance despite its heavy use of MIDI It has been ranked the seventh-greatest game by Electronic Gaming Monthly, whereas Ocarina of Time was ranked eighth [221] [222] The series won GameFAQs Best Series Ever competition [223]\n\n\nLegacy\nMultiple members of the game industry have expressed how Zelda games have impacted them, including Rockstar Games founder and Grand Theft Auto director, Dan Houser, who said that Zelda and Mario games on Nintendo 64 greatly influenced them in developing Grand Theft Auto series, as well in other 3D games in general [240] Rockstar founder and Grand Theft Auto director Sam Houser also cited the influence of Zelda, describing Grand Theft Auto III as \"Zelda meets Goodfellas\" [241] Ōkami director Hideki Kamiya (Capcom, PlatinumGames) said that he has been influenced by The Legend of Zelda series in developing the game, citing A Link to the Past as his favorite game of all time [242] Soul Reaver and Uncharted director, Amy Hennig (Crystal Dynamics and Naughty Dog), cited Zelda as inspiration for the Legacy of Kain series, noting A Link to the Past's influence on Blood Omen and Ocarina of Time's influence on Soul Reaver [243] Soul

[244] Wing Commander and Star Citizen director, Chris Roberts (Origin Systems and Cloud Imperium Games), cited Zelda as an influence on his action role-playing game, Times of Lore [245]\n\n\nCross-overs\nThe Legend of Zelda series has crossed over into other Nintendo and third-party video games, most prominently in the Super Smash Bros series of fighting games published by

The series follows the adventures of a brave hero, known as Link, as he battles to save the kingdom of Hyrule from various evil forces. The series has been praised for its innovative gameplay, engaging storylines, and memorable characters.\n\n# Gameplay\nThe Legend of Zelda series features a mix of puzzles, action-adventure, and exploration. These elements have remained constant throughout the series, with refinements and additions featured in each new game. Later games in the series have included stealth gameplay, where the player must avoid enemies while proceeding through a level, as well as racing elements.\n\nThe games in the series emphasize straightforward hack-and-slash-style combat over the strategic, turn-based or active time combat of series like Final Fantasy. However, the game's role-playing elements, such as the experience system in Zelda II, have led to much debate over whether or not the Zelda games should be classified as action role-playing games.\n\n## Inspiration\nThe Legend of Zelda was principally inspired by Shigeru Miyamoto's \"explorations\" as a young boy in the hillsides, forests, and caves surrounding his childhood home in Sonobe, Japan. Miyamoto has said that one of his most memorable experiences was the discovery of a cave entrance in the middle of the woods. He has referred to the creation of the Zelda games as an attempt to bring to life a \"miniature garden\" for players to play with in each game of the series.\n\n## Audio\nGames in The Legend of Zelda series frequently feature in-game musical instruments, particularly in musical puzzles, which are widespread. Often, instruments trigger game events: for example, the recorder in The Legend of Zelda can reveal secret areas, as well as warp Link to the dungeon entrances. This warping with music feature has also been used in A Link to the Past and Link's Awakening.\n\n## Plot\nThe Legend of Zelda takes place predominantly in a medieval Western Europe-inspired fantasy world called Hyrule, which has developed a deep history and wide geography over the series's many releases. Much of the backstory of the creation of Hyrule was revealed in the games A Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, The Wind Waker, Twilight Princess, Skyward Sword, and A Link Between Worlds.\n\n## Setting\nThe Legend of Zelda takes place predominantly in a medieval Western Europe-inspired fantasy world called Hyrule, which has developed a deep history and wide geography over the series's many releases. Hyrule's principal inhabitants are pointy-eared, elf-like humanoids called Hylians, which include the player character, Link, and the eponymous princess, Zelda.\n\n## Story\nAccording to the in-game backstories, the world of Hyrule was created by the three golden goddesses: Din, Farore, and Nayru. Before departing, the goddesses left a sacred artifact called the Triforce, which could grant powers to the user. The Triforce physically manifests itself as three golden triangles in which each embodies one of the goddesses' virtues: Power, Courage, and Wisdom.\n\n## Characters\nThe central protagonist of The Legend of Zelda series, Link is the name of various young male Hylians who characteristically wear a green tunic and a pointed cap, and are the bearers of the Triforce of Courage. In most games, the player can give Link a different name before the start of the adventure, and he will be referred by that given name throughout by the non-player characters.\n\n## Development\nThe Legend of Zelda, the first game of the series, was first released in Japan on February 21, 1986, on the Famicom Disk System.

remained constant throughout the series, with refinements and additions featured in each new game Later games in the series include stealth gameplay, where the player must avoid enemies while proceeding through a level, as well as racing elements Although the games can be beaten with a minimal amount of exploration and side quests, the player is frequently rewarded with helpful items or increased abilities for solving puzzles or exploring hidden areas Some items are consistent and appear many times throughout the series (such as bombs and bomb flowers, which can be used both as weapons and to open blocked or hidden doorways; boomerangs, which can kill or paralyze enemies; keys for locked doors; magic swords, shields, and bows and arrows), while others are unique to a single game Though the games contain role-playing elements (Zelda II: The Adventure of Link is the only one to include an experience system), they emphasize straightforward hack-and-slash-style combat over the strategic, turn-based or active time combat of series like Final Fantasy The game's role-playing elements, however, have led to much debate over whether or not the Zelda games should be classified as action role-playing games, a genre on which the series has had a strong influence [1] Miyamoto himself disagreed with the role-playing label, and classified Zelda as \"a real-time adventure game\"; he said he was \"not interested in systems where everything in the game is decided by stats and numbers\" but what's \"important to me is to preserve as much of that \"live\" feeling as possible\" which he said \"action games are better suited in conveying\" to players [2]\n\n\nInspiration\nThe Legend of Zelda was principally inspired by Shigeru Miyamoto's \"explorations\" as a young boy in the hillsides, forests, and caves surrounding his childhood home in Sonobe, Japan where he ventured into forests with secluded lakes, caves, and rural villages According to Miyamoto, one of his most memorable experiences was the discovery of a cave entrance in the middle of the woods [3] After some hesitation, he apprehensively entered the cave, and explored its depths with the aid of a lantern Miyamoto has referred to the creation of the Zelda games as an attempt to bring to life a \"miniature garden\" for players to play with in each game of the series [4]\n\n\nAudio\nGames in The Legend of Zelda series frequently feature in-game musical instruments, particularly in musical puzzles, which are widespread [19] Often, instruments trigger game events: for example, the recorder in The Legend of Zelda can reveal secret areas, as well as warp Link to the dungeon entrances This warping with music feature has also been used in A Link to the Past and Link's Awakening In Ocarina of Time, playing instruments is a core part of the game, with the player needing to play the instrument through the use of the game controller to succeed [20] Ocarina of Time is \" [one of the] first contemporary non-dance title [s] to feature music-making as part of its gameplay\", [21] using music as a heuristic device and requiring the player to utilise songs to progress in the game [22] – a game mechanic that is also present in Majora's Mask [23]\n\n\nPlot\nThe Legend of Zelda takes place predominantly in a medieval Western Europe-inspired fantasy world called Hyrule, [27] [28] which has

artifact called the Triforce, which could grant powers to the user It physically manifests itself as three golden triangles in which each embodies one of the goddesses' virtues: Power, Courage, and Wisdom [33] However, because the Triforce has no will of its own and it can not judge between good and evil, it will grant any wish indiscriminately [34] [35] Because of this, it was placed within an alternate world called the \"Sacred Realm\" or the \"Golden Land\" until one worthy of its power and has balanced virtues of Power, Wisdom, and Courage in their heart could obtain it, in its entirety If a person is not of a balanced heart, the triforce part that the user mostly believes in will stay with that person and the remainder will seek out others In order to master and control the triforce as a whole, the user must get the other parts found in other individuals and bring them together to reunite them The Sacred Realm can itself be affected by the heart of those who enter it: those who are pure will make it a paradise, while those who are evil will transform it into a dark realm [36]\n\n\nFictional chronology\nThe chronology of the Legend of Zelda series was a subject of much debate among fans until an official timeline was released within the Hyrule Historia collector's book, first released in Japan in December 2011 [45] [46] Prior to its release, in a 2003 interview, series creator Shigeru Miyamoto confirmed the existence of an internal document which connected all the games, with series producer Eiji Aonuma later revealing in 2010 the confidential nature of this document, which only Miyamoto himself and the director of each game had access to [47] [48]\n\n\nCharacters\nThe central protagonist of The Legend of Zelda series, Link is the name of various young male Hylians who characteristically wear a green tunic and a pointed cap, and are the bearers of the Triforce of Courage In most games, the player can give Link a different name before the start of the adventure, and he will be referred by that given name throughout by the non-player characters (NPCs) Miyamoto said in a 2002 interview that he named the protagonist \"Link\" because the character is/was supposed to be the \"link\" between the player and the game world The various Links each have a special title, such as \"Hero of Time\", \"Hero of the Winds\" or \"Hero chosen by the gods\" Like many silent protagonists in video games, Link does not speak, only producing grunts, yells, etc Despite the player not seeing the dialogue, it is referenced second-hand by in-game characters, showing that he is not, in fact, mute Link is shown as a silent protagonist so that the audience is able to have their own thoughts as to how their Link would answer the characters instead of him having scripted responses.\n\n\nLink\nThe central protagonist of The Legend of Zelda series, Link is the name of various young male Hylians who characteristically wear a green tunic and a pointed cap,

of Hyrule and the guardian of the Triforce of Wisdom Her name is present in many of her female ancestors and descendants While most games require Link to save Zelda from Ganon, she sometimes plays a supporting role in battle, using magical powers and weapons such as Light Arrows to aid Link With the exception of the CD-i games, she was not playable in the main series until Spirit Tracks, where she becomes a spirit and can possess a Phantom Knight that can be controlled by the player Zelda appears under various other aliases and alter egos, including Sheik (in Ocarina of Time) and Tetra (in The Wind Waker and Phantom Hourglass) In Skyward Sword, it is revealed that the Zelda of that game is a reincarnation of the goddess Hylia, whose power flows through the royal bloodline The name \"Zelda\" derives from the American novelist Zelda Fitzgerald [74]\n\n\nGanon\nGanon, also known as Ganondorf in his humanoid form, is the main antagonist and the final boss in the majority of The Legend of Zelda games In the series, Ganondorf is the leader of a race of desert brigands called the Gerudo, which consists entirely of female warriors save for one man born every one hundred years He is significantly taller than other human NPCs, but his looks vary between games, often taking the form of a monstrous anthropomorphic boar His specific motives vary from game to game, but most often his plans include him kidnapping Princess Zelda and planning to achieve domination of Hyrule and presumably the world beyond it To this end, he seeks the Triforce, a powerful magical relic He often possesses a portion of the Triforce called the Triforce of Power, which gives him great strength However, it is often not enough to accomplish his ends, leading him to hunt the remaining Triforce pieces Unlike Link, Zelda, and most other recurring characters, he is actually the same person in every game, with the exception of Four Swords Adventures, where he is a reincarnation of the original In each game the battles with him are different and he fights using different styles The game Skyward Sword indicates that Ganon is a reincarnation of an evil deity known as Demise.\n\n\nDevelopment\nThe Legend of Zelda, the first game of the series, was first released in Japan on February 21, 1986, on the Famicom Disk System [75] A cartridge version for the Nintendo Entertainment System, using battery-backed memory, was released in the United States on August 22, 1987, and in Europe on November 27, 1987 The game features a \"Second Quest\", accessible either upon completing the game, or by registering one's name as \"ZELDA\" when starting a new quest The \"Second Quest\" features different dungeons and item placement, and more difficult enemies [76] A modified version of the original Famicom game, BS Zelda no Densetsu, was released for the Super Famicom's satellite-based expansion, Satellaview, on August 6, 1995, in Japan A second Satellaview game, BS Zelda no Densetsu MAP2 was released for the Satellaview on December 30 the same year Both games featured rearranged dungeons, an altered overworld, and new voice-acted plot-lines [77]\n\n\n1986–1997: 2D

3D\nAfter five years without a new game, the series made the transition to 3D with Ocarina of Time for the Nintendo 64, which was released in November 1998 This game, initially known as Zelda 64, retains the core gameplay of the previous 2D games, and was very successful commercially and critically, considered by many critics and gamers to be the best video game of all time, and ranking highly on IGN and EGM's \"greatest games of all time\" lists, as well as scoring perfect scores in several video game publications [84] In February 2006, it was ranked by Nintendo Power as the best game released for a Nintendo console [85] The game was originally developed for the poorly selling, Japanese-only 64DD, but was converted to cartridge format when the 64DD hardware was delayed [86] A new gameplay mechanic, lock-on targeting, is used in the game, which focuses the camera on a nearby target and alters the player's actions relative to that target [87] Such mechanics allow precise sword fighting in a 3D space The game heavily uses context-sensitive button play, which enabled the player to control various actions with Link using only one button on the Nintendo 64's controller Each action was handled slightly differently but all used the 'A' button to perform For instance, standing next to a block and pressing 'A' made Link grab it (enabling him to push/pull it), but moving forwards into a block and pressing 'A' allowed Link to climb the block The game featured the first appearance of Link's horse, Epona, allowing Link to travel quickly across land and fire arrows from horseback Those who preordered the game received a gold-colored cartridge in a limited edition box with a golden plastic card affixed, reading \"Collector's Edition\" [88] In some stores that had this \"Collector's Edition\" quickly sell out, a small and rare Zelda pin was given instead It is the sword and shield emblem with \"Zelda\" written on it Very few of them are known to remain Ocarina of Time was re-released on the GameCube in 2002, when it was offered as a pre-order incentive for The Wind Waker in the U.S., Canada and Japan [89] It includes the cancelled 64DD expansion for Ocarina of Time known as Ura Zelda during development Named Ocarina of Time Master Quest, the game was given reorganized dungeon layouts for greater difficulty [89] [90] Europe continued to receive this \"Two-Game Bonus Disc\" free in every copy of The Wind Waker, except for the discounted Player's Choice version Ocarina of Time was available through the Wii's Virtual Console service [91] Nintendo re-released it for the Wii U Virtual Console in July 2015 Ocarina of Time 3D for the 3DS, featuring remade graphics and stereoscopic 3D, was released in mid-June 2011 Ocarina of Time has been made available on the higher tier of Nintendo Switch Online in HD resolution.\n\n\n2002–2005: Introduction of Toon Link and multiplayer\nThe Game Boy Advance release of A Link to the Past in 2002 featured a new game, Four Swords, [75] the first multiplayer Zelda This game introduced Toon Link, a name first used in Super Smash Bros Brawl to refer to cartoon-based visual designs of Link Four Swords Anniversary Edition [100] was released on September 28, 2011, as free DSiWare available until February 20, 2012.\n\n\n2006–2011: Motion and touch-based swordplay\nIn November 2006, Twilight Princess was released as the first Zelda game on the Wii, and later in December as the last Nintendo-published game for the GameCube, the console for which it was originally developed The Wii version features motion controls and a reversed world where everything that is in the west on the GameCube is in the east on the Wii The display is mirrored in order to make Link right-handed to make use of the Wii Remote feel more natural for the majority of players The game chronicles the struggle of a young adult Link to confront the troubles of the \"Twilight Realm\", a mysterious force that appears around and interacts with Hyrule When he enters this realm, he is transformed into a wolf, and loses the ability to use his sword, shield or other items, but gains other abilities such as sharpened senses from his new form Twilight Princess includes an incarnation of Link's horse, Epona, for fast transportation, and features mounted battle scenarios including boss battles that were not seen in previous games Twilight Princess diverted from the cel-shading of Wind Waker, integrating graphics featuring more detailed textures, giving the game a darker atmosphere The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD released for Wii U in 2016 [106]\n\n\n2013–present: Open-world emphasis\nIn 2013, Nintendo released A Link Between Worlds for the Nintendo 3DS, a sequel to A Link to the Past [111] [112] Progression is more open-ended than previous titles, with the possibility of completing many of the game's dungeons in any order Certain dungeon obstacles require the use of rented or purchased items.\n\n\nOther games\nThroughout the lifespan of The Legend of Zelda series, a number of games (including main series games as well as re-releases and spin-offs) in varying states of completeness have had their releases cancelled Perhaps the earliest of these was Gottlieb's The Legend of Zelda Pinball Machine (cancelled 1993) After securing a license from Nintendo to produce two Nintendo-franchise-based pinball machines, pinball designer Jon Norris was tasked with designing the table Before it was completed, Gottlieb decided to repurpose the game with an American Gladiators theme Licensing for this version ultimately fell through and the game was released as simply Gladiators (November 1993) [121]\n\n\nCancelled games\nThroughout the lifespan of The Legend of Zelda

as simply Gladiators (November 1993) [121]\n\n\nSpin-off games\nAs the franchise has grown in popularity, several games have been released that are set within or star a minor character from the universe of The Legend of Zelda but are not directly connected to the main The Legend of Zelda series Both map versions of the game BS Zelda no Densetsu for the Satellaview (released in August and December 1995) could be considered spin-offs due to the fact that they star the \"Hero of Light\" (portrayed by either the Satellaview's male or female avatar) as opposed to Link as the protagonist of Hyrule [citation needed] A third Satellaview game released in March 1997, BS Zelda no Densetsu Inishie no Sekiban (BS The Legend of Zelda: Ancient Stone Tablets) could also be considered a spin-off for the same reason [citation needed] Other spin-off games include Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland for the Nintendo DS, an RPG released in September 2006 in Japan (Summer of 2007 in the UK) to star supporting character Tingle A second Tingle game is Tingle's Balloon Fight DS for the Nintendo DS Here Tingle again stars in this spin-off arcade style platformer, released in April 2007 only in Japan and available solely to Platinum Club Nintendo members.\n\n\nReception\nThe Legend of Zelda series has received outstanding levels of acclaim from critics and the public Ocarina of Time, Skyward Sword, Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom have each received a perfect 10/10 score by British Edge magazine [208] All four plus Wind Waker also received a 40/40 score (10/10 by four reviewers) by Japanese Famitsu magazine, [209] [210] making Zelda one of the few series with multiple perfect scores Ocarina of Time was even listed by Guinness World Records as the highest-rated video game in history, citing its Metacritic score of 99 out of 100 [211] Computer and Video Games awarded The Wind Waker and Twilight Princess a score of 10/10 [212] [213] A Link to the Past has won

Richard Wagner's use of leitmotifs to identify characters and themes [219] Ocarina of Time was so well received that sales increased for real ocarinas [220] IGN praised the music of Majora's Mask for its brilliance despite its heavy use of MIDI It has been ranked the seventh-greatest game by Electronic Gaming Monthly, whereas Ocarina of Time was ranked eighth [221] [222] The series won GameFAQs Best Series Ever competition [223]\n\n\nLegacy\nMultiple members of the game industry have expressed how Zelda games have impacted them, including Rockstar Games founder and Grand Theft Auto director, Dan Houser, who said that Zelda and Mario games on Nintendo 64 greatly influenced them in developing Grand Theft Auto series, as well in other 3D games in general [240] Rockstar founder and Grand Theft Auto director Sam Houser also cited the influence of Zelda, describing Grand Theft Auto III as \"Zelda meets Goodfellas\" [241] Ōkami director Hideki Kamiya (Capcom, PlatinumGames) said that he has been influenced by The Legend of Zelda series in developing the game, citing A Link to the Past as his favorite game of all time [242] Soul Reaver and Uncharted director, Amy Hennig (Crystal Dynamics and Naughty Dog), cited Zelda as inspiration for the Legacy of Kain series, noting A Link to the Past's influence on Blood Omen and Ocarina of Time's influence on Soul Reaver [243] Soul Reaver and Uncharted creator, Richard Lemarchand (Crystal Dynamics and Naughty Dog), also cited A Link to the Past's approach to combining gameplay with storytelling as inspiration for Soul Reaver [244] Wing Commander and Star Citizen director, Chris Roberts (Origin Systems and Cloud Imperium Games), cited Zelda as an influence on his action role-playing game, Times of Lore [245]\n\n\nCross-overs\nThe Legend of Zelda series has crossed over into other Nintendo and third-party video games, most prominently in the Super Smash Bros series of fighting games published by

to transform into Sheik as well), Ganondorf, and Young Link (the child version of Link from Ocarina of Time) were added to the player roster for Super Smash Bros Melee, and appeared in all subsequent releases except for \"Young Link\" (who is later replaced by \"Toon Link\" from The Wind Waker, in subsequent releases Super Smash Bros Brawl and Super Smash Bros for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U) Both Young Link and Toon Link appear in the fifth installment, Super Smash Bros Ultimate Other elements from the series, such as locations and items, are also included throughout the Smash Bros series Outside of the series, Nintendo allowed for the use of Link as a playable character exclusively in the GameCube release of Namco's fighting game Soulcalibur II [255]\n\n\nIn other media\nA 13-episode

1993 live-action film adaptation of Super Mario Bros [280] In 2013, Aonuma said that, if the development of a film began, the company would want to use the opportunity to embrace audience interaction in some capacity [281] [282] In June 2023, it was said that Nintendo was close to closing a deal with Illumination and Universal Pictures to produce a film adaptation of the franchise following the success of their film, The Super Mario Bros Movie, [283] but Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri denied these reports later that month [284]\n\n\nNotes\nWorks cited\n\n\nReferences\nWorks

and David Bale, an entrepreneur and activist [2] [3] [4] Bale has remarked, \"I was born in Wales but I'm not Welsh—I'm English.\" [5] He has two elder sisters, Sharon and Louise, and a half-sister from his father's first marriage, Erin [4] One of his grandfathers was a comedian while the other was a stand-in for John Wayne [6] Bale and his family left Wales when he was two years old, [7] and after living in Portugal and Oxfordshire, England, they settled in Bournemouth [8] As well as saying that the family had lived in 15 towns by the time he was 15, Bale described the frequent relocation as being driven by \"necessity rather than choice\" and acknowledged that it had a major influence on his career selection [7] [9] [10] He attended Bournemouth School, later saying he left school at age 16 [11] [12] Bale's parents divorced in 1991, and at age 17, he moved with his sister Louise and their father to Los Angeles [13]\n\n\nCareer\nAfter deciding to become an actor at age ten, Bale secured a minor role in the 1986 television film Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna Its star, Amy Irving, who was married to director Steven Spielberg, subsequently recommended Bale for Spielberg's 1987 film Empire of the Sun [19] At age 13, Bale was chosen from over 4,000 actors to portray a British boy in a World War II Japanese internment camp [20] For the film, he spoke with an upper-class cadence without the help of a dialogue coach [21] The role propelled Bale to fame, [22] and his work earned him acclaim and the inaugural Best Performance by a Juvenile Actor Award from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures [23] Earlier in the same year, he starred in the fantasy film Mio in the Land of Faraway, based on the novel Mio, My Son by Astrid Lindgren [24] [25] The fame from Empire of the Sun led to Bale being bullied in school and finding the pressures of working as an actor unbearable [26] He grew distrustful of the acting profession because of media attention but said that he felt obligated at a young age to continue to act for financial reasons [22] Around this time, actor and filmmaker Kenneth Branagh persuaded Bale to appear in his film Henry V in 1989, which drew him back into acting [23] The following year, Bale played Jim Hawkins opposite Charlton Heston as Long John Silver in Treasure Island, a television film adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's book of the same name [27]\n\n\nEarly roles and breakthrough (1986–1999)\nAfter deciding to become an actor at age ten, Bale secured a minor role in the 1986 television film Anastasia: The Mystery of

decline (2000–2004)\nBale played Patrick Bateman, an investment banker and serial killer, in American Psycho, a film adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis's novel of the same name, directed by Mary Harron While Harron had chosen Bale for the part, the film's production and distribution company, Lionsgate, originally disagreed and hired Leonardo DiCaprio to play Bateman with Oliver Stone to direct Bale and Harron were brought back after DiCaprio and Stone had left the project [37] [38] Bale exercised and tanned himself for months to achieve Bateman's chiseled physique and had his teeth capped to assimilate to the character's narcissistic nature [39] [40] American Psycho premiered at the 2000 Sundance Film Festival Harron said critic Roger Ebert named it the most hated film at the event [41] Of Bale's work, Ebert wrote he \"is heroic in the way he allows the character to leap joyfully into despicability; there is no instinct for self-preservation here, and that is one mark of a good actor.\" [42] The film was released in April 2000, becoming a commercial and critical success and later developing a cult following; [43] [44] the role established Bale as a leading man [15] [45]\n\n\nBatman and dramatic roles (2005–2008)\nBale portrayed American billionaire Bruce Wayne and his superhero alias Batman in Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins, a reboot of the Batman film series Nolan cast Bale, who was still fairly unknown at the time, because Bale had \"exactly the balance of darkness and light\" Nolan sought [63] [64] For the part, Bale regained the weight he lost for The Machinist and built muscle, weighing 220 pounds (100 kg) [65] He trained in weapons, Wing Chun Kung Fu and the Keysi Fighting Method [66] Acknowledging the story's peculiar circumstances involving a character \"who thinks he can run around in a batsuit in the middle of the night\", Bale said he and Nolan had deliberately approached it with \"as realistic a motivation as possible\", referencing Wayne's parents' murder [54] Bale voiced Wayne and Batman differently He employed gravelly tone qualities for Batman, which Nolan believed reinforced the character's visual appearance [67] Batman Begins was released in the US in June 2005 [68] Tim Grierson and Will Leitch of Vulture complimented Bale's \"sensitive, intelligent portrayal of a spoiled, wayward Bruce who finally grows up (and fights crime).\" [34] The performance earned Bale the MTV Movie Award for Best Hero [69]\n\n\nThe Dark Knight trilogy completion and acclaim (2009–2012)\nIn February 2008, Warner Bros announced that Bale would star as rebellion leader John Connor in the post-apocalyptic action film Terminator Salvation, [89] directed by McG, who cited Bale as \"the most credible actor of his generation\" [90] In February 2009, an audio recording of a tirade on the film's set in July 2008 involving Bale was released It captured him directing profanities towards and threatening to attack the film's cinematographer Shane Hurlbut, who walked onto the set during the filming of a scene acted by Bale and Bryce Dallas Howard, and culminated in Bale threatening to quit the film if Hurlbut was not fired [91] [92] Several colleagues in the film industry defended Bale, attributing the incident to his dedication to acting [91] [93] [94] Bale publicly apologised in February 2009, calling the outburst \"inexcusable\" and his behaviour \"way out of order\" and affirming to have made amends with Hurlbut [95] [96] Terminator Salvation was released in May 2009 to tepid reviews [97] [98] Claudia Puig of USA Today considered Bale's work to be \"surprisingly one-dimensional\", while The Age's Jake Wilson wrote he gave one of his least compelling performances [99] [100] Bale later admitted he knew during production that the film would not revitalise the Terminator franchise as he had wished [101] He asserted he would not work with McG again [98]\n\n\nContinued critical success (2013–2018)\nIn 2013, Bale played a steel mill worker in Scott Cooper's thriller Out of the Furnace [123] Cooper rewrote the film's script with Bale in mind before the two even met and would not proceed with the project without the actor's involvement [12] Critics commended the film and deemed it an excellent beginning of the next phase in Bale's career after playing Batman, [124] [125] with Kristopher Tapley of Variety noting his work in the film was his best [126] That same year, he starred in American Hustle, which reunited him with David O Russell after their work on The Fighter [127] To play con artist Irving Rosenfeld, Bale studied footage of interviews with real-life con artist Mel Weinberg, who served as inspiration for the character [12] He gained 43 pounds (20 kg), shaved part of his head and adopted a slouched posture, which reduced his height by 3 inches (7.6 cm) and caused him to suffer a herniated disc [128] [129] Russell indicated that Robert De Niro, who appeared in an uncredited role, did not recognise Bale when they were first introduced [130] Writing for the New York Daily News, Joe Neumaier found Bale's performance to be \"sad, funny and riveting\" [131] He was nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award for his work [110] [132]\n\n\nRecent career (2018–present)\nFor the 2018 biographical comedy drama Vice, written and directed by Adam McKay, Bale underwent a major body transformation once again, as he gained over 40 pounds (18 kg) and shaved his head to portray US Vice President Dick Cheney [128] He described Cheney, who is reckoned the most influential and loathed vice president in US history, as \"quiet and secretive\" [147] [148] The film reunited Bale with Amy Adams, with whom he had co-starred in The Fighter and American Hustle [149] It received positive reviews, and The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw commended Bale's \"terrifically and in fact rather scarily plausible\" Cheney impersonation [150] Lauded by critics, the performance won Bale the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and garnered him an Academy Award nomination [151] [152] During his acceptance speech at the 76th Golden Globe Awards, Bale thanked Satan for inspiring his Cheney portrayal, which elicited a response from Cheney's daughter and US Representative Liz Cheney, who stated that Bale ruined his opportunity to play \"a real superhero\" [153]\n\n\nArtistry and public image\nBale is known for his exhaustive dedication to the weight fluctuations that his parts demand as well as \"the intensity with which he completely inhabits his roles\", [6] [167] with The Washington Post's Ann Hornaday rating him among the most physically gifted actors of his generation [168] Max O'Connell of RogerEbert.com deemed Bale's commitment to altering his physical appearance \"an anchoring facet to a depiction of obsession\" in his performances, [169] while the Los Angeles Times's Hugh Hart likened the urgency that drives Bale's acting style to method acting, adding that it \"convincingly animates even his most extreme physical transformations.\" [128] Bale has said that he does not practise method acting and that he does not use a particular technique [170] He named Rowan Atkinson as his template as an actor and added that he was mesmerised by him when they worked together [171] He also studied the work of Gary Oldman, crediting him as the reason for his pursuit of acting [172]\n\n\nPersonal life\nBale has lived in Los Angeles since the 1990s [15] He holds US citizenship [147] [180] Bale married Sandra \"Sibi\" Blažić, a former American  model of Serbian descent, in Las Vegas on 29 January 2000 [175] [181] [182] [183] They have a daughter and a son [181] In 2000, Bale became feminist Gloria Steinem's stepson following her marriage to his father, who died in 2003 of brain lymphoma [184] [185]\n\n\nActing credits and accolades\nAccording to the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, which assigns films scores based on the number of positive critical reviews they receive, some of Bale's highest-scoring films are The Dark Knight (2008), Ford v Ferrari (2019), American Hustle

renowned Indian nuclear physicist and polymath who played a crucial role in the development of India's nuclear energy program. He is often referred to as the \"father of the Indian nuclear program\" and one of the most prominent scientists in the country's history. Bhabha was a multifaceted individual who made significant contributions to various fields, including physics, engineering, and philosophy.\n\nEarly Life\n\nHomi Jehangir Bhabha was born on October 30, 1909, in Mumbai, India, into a wealthy Parsi family. His father, Jehangir Hormusji Bhabha, was a well-known lawyer, and his mother, Meherbai Framji Panday, was a member of the influential Petit family. Bhabha was named after his paternal grandfather, Hormusji Bhabha, who was the Inspector-General of Education in Mysore. He received his early education at Mumbai's Cathedral and John Connon School.\n\nUniversity Studies in India\n\nBhabha's academic career began at Elphinstone College in Mumbai, where he enrolled after passing his Senior Cambridge Examination with honors at the age of 15. However, he was too young to join any college abroad, so he continued his studies in India. In 1927, he attended the Royal Institute of Science in Mumbai, where he witnessed a public lecture by Arthur Compton, who would later win the Nobel Prize in physics for his discovery of the Compton effect. Bhabha later stated that he first heard of cosmic rays, the subject of his future research, at this lecture.\n\nUniversity Studies in Cambridge\n\nIn 1928, Bhabha joined Gonville and Caius College of Cambridge University, where he studied theoretical physics under the supervision of Ralph Fowler. At the time, the Cavendish Laboratory was the center of several breakthroughs in experimental physics, including the discovery of the neutron, the transmutation of lithium with high-energy protons, and the discovery of chemical isotopes. Bhabha worked at the Cavendish Laboratory while pursuing his PhD degree and made significant contributions to the field of nuclear physics.\n\nCareer\n\nBhabha returned to India in 1939, before the start of World War II, and accepted a post of reader in physics at the Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru. In 1940, the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust supported his experimental cosmic ray physics research with a grant. Bhabha's research focused on the study of cosmic rays and their interaction with matter. He proposed the idea of building a research center to study cosmic rays and their applications in physics.\n\nIndian Institute of Science\n\nBhabha's work at the Indian Institute of Science led to the establishment of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) in 1945. TIFR was a research institute dedicated to the study of fundamental sciences, including physics, chemistry, and mathematics. Bhabha was the director of TIFR from its inception and played a crucial role in shaping the institute's research agenda.\n\nTata Institute of Fundamental Research\n\nBhabha's vision for TIFR was to establish a center of excellence for fundamental research in India. He believed that the institute should focus on basic sciences, including physics, chemistry, and mathematics, and explore their applications in various fields. Under Bhabha's leadership, TIFR made significant contributions to the field of nuclear physics, including the development of nuclear reactors and the study of cosmic rays.\n\nIndia's Nuclear Energy Programme\n\nBhabha is credited with formulating a strategy for India's nuclear energy program. He proposed a three-stage plan for the development of nuclear energy, which focused on extracting power from thorium reserves rather than uranium reserves. This strategy stood in contrast to other countries, which were primarily focused on uranium-based nuclear energy. Bhabha's plan was adopted by the Indian government in 1958 as the country's three-stage nuclear power program.\n\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency\n\nBhabha represented India in International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) conferences and served as the President of the United Nations Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in Geneva, Switzerland in 1955. He was a strong advocate for the peaceful use of atomic energy and believed that it should be available to all countries for peaceful purposes.\n\nAllegations of Developing Nuclear Explosives Capability\n\nBhabha was aware of the risks of nuclear proliferation and the potential for nuclear explosives to be developed by countries without adequate safeguards. He stated that the negotiated IAEA safeguards were not sufficient to deter a state from developing weapons capability. However, Bhabha's views on this matter were not consistently applied, and he later advocated for the development of nuclear explosives in India.\n\nLobbying to Build Nuclear Explosives\n\nAfter the Chinese nuclear test in 1964, Bhabha began to publicly call for the development of nuclear explosives in India. However, Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, Nehru's successor, sought security guarantees from the existing nuclear powers and declared that India's nuclear establishment was not to make any experiments or perfect any devices that were not needed for peaceful uses of atomic energy.\n\nInterest in and Patronage of the Arts\n\nBhabha was a classical music and opera enthusiast and believed that the arts were an essential part of human culture. He was a strong supporter of the arts and believed that they should be promoted and encouraged. Bhabha's love for the arts led him to push for Vienna to be the headquarters of the IAEA, as it would allow him to attend the state opera during IAEA meetings.\n\nAwards and Honours\n\nBhabha's doctoral thesis won him the Adams Prize in 1942, making him the first Indian to receive the honor. He was also awarded the Hopkins Prize by the Cambridge Philosophical Society in 1948.\n\nDeath\n\nBhabha died on January 24, 1966, when Air India Flight 101 crashed near Mont Blanc. A misunderstanding between Geneva Airport and the pilot was cited as the official reason for the crash. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi paid tribute to Bhabha, stating that he was a \"great scientist and a great patriot.\"\n\nAssassination Claims\n\nSeveral theories have been advanced regarding the circumstances surrounding Bhabha's death, including claims that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was involved in paralyzing India's nuclear program. An investigation into the crash revealed that a diplomatic bag containing calendars and a personal letter was recovered near the crash site in 2012.\n\nLegacy\n\nBhabha is remembered as the \"father of the Indian nuclear program\" and one of the most prominent scientists in the country's history. After his death, the Atomic Energy Establishment at Mumbai was renamed the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in his honor. The auditorium at TIFR was named the Homi Bhabha Auditorium, and it was inaugurated by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1968.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about

He is best known for his portrayal of Jon Snow in the HBO fantasy drama series Game of Thrones, which ran from 2011 to 2019. Harington's early life and ancestry, as well as his career in theatre and television, have been marked by a mix of traditional education and early exposure to the performing arts.\n\n**Early Life and Ancestry**\n\nChristopher Catesby Harington, as he was born, was named after Christopher Marlowe, a renowned English playwright. However, he preferred the nickname \"Kit,\" which he used throughout his life. Harington's parents, Sir David Harington, 15th Bt, and Deborah Jane Catesby, a former playwright, instilled in him a love for the arts from a young age. Through his father, Harington descends from Scottish politician Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville, while on his mother's side, he claims a family connection with Robert Catesby, the leader of the Gunpowder Plot.\n\nHarington's family has a complex and storied history, with connections to both sides of the Gunpowder Plot. His father's side links him to King James I, the target of the assassination attempt, and to Lord Harington of Exton, who was in the Houses of Parliament that Catesby and his co-conspirators tried to blow up. This mix of historical connections has made Harington's family tree a fascinating area of study.\n\n**Career**\n\nBefore becoming an actor, Harington considered a career in journalism. However, while still at drama school, he landed his first major role as Albert in the National Theatre's adaptation of War Horse. The play, which won two Olivier Awards, brought Harington significant recognition and paved the way for his future career. He later appeared in Posh, a dark ensemble comedy about upper-class men attending Oxford University.\n\n**2008-2010: Early Work in Theatre**\n\nHarington's early work in theatre showcased his ability to take on complex and nuanced roles. His experience in War Horse and Posh demonstrated his range and versatility as an actor.

they were seen by around 38 people, but most bystanders did nothing to intervene [18] [19] Two people confronted Thompson and Venables, but they either claimed that Bulger was their brother, or that he was lost, and that they were taking him to a police station [20] At one point, the boys took Bulger into a pet shop, from which they were ejected [21]\n\n\nInvestigation\nPolice suspected that the boys had sexually assaulted Bulger, as his shoes, socks, trousers, and underpants had been removed The pathologist's report, which was read out in court, found that Bulger's foreskin had been forcibly pulled back [24] [31] When Thompson and Venables were questioned about this aspect of the attack by detectives and a child psychiatrist, Eileen Vizard, the pair were reluctant to give details [4] [21] [32] When Venables was let out on parole, his psychiatrist, Susan Bailey, reported that \"visiting and revisiting the issue with Jon as a child, and now as an adolescent, he gives no account of any sexual element to the offence.\" [4]\n\n\nLegal proceedings\nThe fact that the suspects were so young came as a shock to investigating officers, headed by Detective Superintendent Albert Kirby of Merseyside Police Early press reports and police statements had referred to Bulger being seen with \"two youths\" (suggesting that the killers were teenagers), the ages of the boys being difficult to ascertain from the images captured by CCTV [30] Forensic tests confirmed that both boys had the same blue paint on their clothing as found on Bulger's body Both had blood on their shoes; the blood on Thompson's shoe was matched to Bulger's through DNA tests A pattern of bruising on Bulger's right cheek matched the features of the upper part of a shoe worn by Thompson; a paint mark in the toecap of one of Venables's shoes indicated he must have used \"some force\" when he kicked Bulger [34] Thompson is said to have asked police whether Bulger had been taken to hospital to \"get him alive again.\" [35]\n\n\nArrest\nThe fact that the suspects were so young came as a shock to investigating officers, headed by Detective Superintendent Albert Kirby of Merseyside Police Early press reports and police statements had referred to Bulger being seen with \"two youths\" (suggesting that the killers were teenagers), the ages of the boys being difficult to ascertain from the images captured by CCTV [30] Forensic tests confirmed that both boys had the same blue paint on their clothing as found on Bulger's body Both had blood on their shoes;

regarding the fairness of the trial of Thompson and Venables, they stated: \"The public trial process in an adult court must be regarded in the case of an 11 year-old child as a severely intimidating procedure.\" [36]\n\n\nLater developments\nIn the months after the trial, and following the birth of their second son, the marriage of Bulger's parents, Ralph and Denise, broke down; they divorced in 1995 [71]\n\n\nDissolution of James Bulger's family\nIn the months after the trial, and following the birth of their second son, the marriage of Bulger's parents, Ralph and Denise, broke down;

however, Thompson's lack of remorse at the time, in stark contrast to Venables, led to considerable scrutiny from the parole panel Upon release, both Thompson and Venables had lost all trace of their Scouse accent [78]\n\n\nFalse identification and internet trolling\nIn April 2010, a 19-year-old man from the Isle of Man was given a three-month suspended prison sentence for falsely claiming in a Facebook message that one of his former colleagues was Thompson In passing sentence, Deputy High Bailiff Alastair Montgomerie said that the teenager had \"put that person at significant risk of serious harm\" and in a \"perilous position\" by making the allegation [84]\n\n\nInternet photo posts\nOn 25 February 2013, the Attorney General's Office announced that it was instituting contempt of court proceedings against several people who had allegedly published photographs online showing Thompson or Venables as adults [86] A spokesman commented:\n\n\nTrolling and stalking of James' mother\nOn 14 July 2016, a woman from Margate in Kent was jailed for three years after sending Twitter messages to Bulger's mother, in which she posed as one of his killers, and as Bulger's ghost [93] The sentence was reduced to 2+1⁄2 years on appeal [94]\n\n\nLater life of Jon Venables\nShortly before his 2001 release, when aged 17, Venables was alleged to have had sex with a woman who worked at the Red Bank secure unit where he was held In April 2011, in the aftermath of his 2010 imprisonment, these allegations were outlined in a Sunday Times Magazine article written by David James Smith, who had been following the Bulger case since the 1993 trial, and again later in a BBC documentary titled Jon Venables: What went wrong? The female staff member was suspended for sexual misconduct; she never returned to work at Red Bank [4] [96] A spokesman for St Helens Council denied that the incident had been covered up, saying, \"All allegations were thoroughly investigated by an independent team on the orders of the Home Office and chaired by Arthur de Frischling, a retired prison governor.\" [97]\n\n\nRelationships\nShortly before his 2001 release, when aged 17, Venables was alleged to have had sex with a woman who worked at the Red Bank secure unit where he was held In April 2011, in the aftermath of his 2010 imprisonment, these allegations were outlined in a Sunday Times Magazine article written by David James Smith, who had been following the Bulger case since the 1993 trial, and again later in a BBC documentary titled Jon Venables: What went wrong?

\"All allegations were thoroughly investigated by an independent team on the orders of the Home Office and chaired by Arthur de Frischling, a retired prison governor.\" [97]\n\n\nMisdemeanours while on release 2002–2008\nVenables began living independently in March 2002 Some time thereafter, he began a relationship with a woman who had a five-year-old child; it is not known whether Venables had already begun downloading child abuse images at the time of dating the woman, although he denies having ever met the child [4]\n\n\n2010 imprisonment\nVenables contacted his probation officer in February 2010, reporting that he feared that his new identity had been compromised at his place of work When the officer arrived at his flat, Venables was attempting to remove or destroy the hard drive of his computer with a knife and a tin opener [4] The officer's suspicions were aroused, and the computer was taken away for examination leading to the discovery of the child sexual abuse material, which included children as young as two being raped by adults, [98] [99] and penetrative rape of seven- or eight-year-olds [4]\n\n\nNew identity 2011\nOn 4 May 2011, it was reported that Venables would once again be given a new identity, following what was described as a \"serious security breach\", which revealed an identity that he had been using before his imprisonment in 2010; details of the breach could not be reported for legal reasons [121] A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice commented: \"Such a change of identity is extremely rare, and granted only when the police assess that there is clear and credible evidence of a sustained threat to the offender's life on release into the community.\" [122] The incident occurred after a man from Exeter posted photographs on a website devoted to identifying paedophiles, allegedly showing Venables as an adult, and revealing his name [123]\n\n\n2013 parole hearing and release\nIn November 2011, it was reported that officials had decided that Venables would stay in prison for the foreseeable future, as he would be likely to reveal his true identity if released A Ministry of Justice spokesman declined to comment on the reports [124] On 4 July 2013, it was reported that the Parole Board for England and Wales had approved the release again of Venables [125] [126] On 3 September 2013, it was reported that Venables had been released from prison [127]\n\n\n2017 imprisonment\nOn 23 November 2017, it was reported that Venables had again been recalled to prison for possession of more child sexual abuse imagery The Ministry of Justice declined to comment on the reports [128] On 5 January 2018, Venables was charged with unspecified offences relating to indecent images of children [129] On 7 February 2018, Venables pleaded guilty to possession of indecent images of children for a second time He pleaded guilty via video link to three charges of making indecent images of children, and one of possessing a \"paedophile manual\", that included advice for would-be child molesters, including instructions on child grooming and evading detection [130] He admitted being in possession of 392 category A, 148 category B, and 630 category C child sexual abuse images, and was sentenced to three years and four months in prison In September 2020, he was denied parole [131] On 13 December 2023, Venables was again denied parole, with the Parole Board saying that \"The panel was not satisfied that release at this point would be safe for the protection of the public.\" [132]\n\n\n2019 legal challenge to lift anonymity refused\nOn 4 March 2019, Bulger's father, Ralph, lost a legal challenge to lift the lifelong order protecting Venables' anonymity Judge Andrew McFarlane turned down the request, saying that the \"uniquely notorious\" nature of the case meant there is \"a strong possibility, if not a probability, that if his identity were known, he would be pursued, resulting in grave and possibly fatal consequences.\" [133]\n\n\nPotential overseas resettlement\nIn late June 2019, it was reported that British officials had considered resettling Venables in Canada, Australia, or New Zealand, due to the high costs behind protecting his anonymity British authorities had reportedly spent £65,000 in legal fees to keep Venables' identity a secret [134] [135] In response to media coverage, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern remarked that, due to his criminal history, Venables would need an exemption under New Zealand's Immigration Act 2009, and that he should \"not bother\" applying [136] [137]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nIn August 2001, a stage play titled The Age of Consent by Peter Morris was performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe The play featured an 18-year-old

Order: Double or Nothing (made in 2003), was withdrawn from stores in the UK following reports that it contained an image of Bulger The image in question is the CCTV frame of Bulger being led away by Thompson and Venables The scene in the game involves a computer-generated detective pointing out the picture, which is meant to represent a fictional child abduction that the player is then asked to investigate Bulger's family, along with many others, complained, and the game was subsequently withdrawn by its UK distributor, GSP.\n\n\n2008 'true crime'-style stage play\nIn 2008, Swedish

television (CCTV) at the New Strand Shopping Centre in Bootle on 12 February 1993 showed Thompson and Venables casually observing children, apparently selecting a target [8] The boys were playing truant from their local primary school, which they did regularly [9] Throughout the day, Thompson and Venables were seen shoplifting various items, including sweets, batteries, a troll doll, and a can of blue Humbrol modelling paint [10] One of the boys later said that before abducting Bulger, they were planning to abduct a child, lead him to the busy road alongside the shopping centre, and push

observing children, apparently selecting a target [8] The boys were playing truant from their local primary school, which they did regularly [9] Throughout the day, Thompson and Venables were seen shoplifting various items, including sweets, batteries, a troll doll, and a can of blue Humbrol modelling paint [10] One of the boys later said that before abducting Bulger, they were planning to abduct a child, lead him to the busy road alongside the shopping centre, and push him into the oncoming traffic [11]\n\n\nAbduction\nThat same afternoon, two-year-old James Patrick Bulger, from Kirkby, went with his mother, Denise, to the New Strand Shopping Centre While inside the A.R Tym's butcher's shop on the lower floor of the centre at around 15:40, Denise, who had let go of her son's hand to pay for her shopping, realised that her son was missing [4] [12] Thompson and Venables had approached Bulger, took him by the hand, and led him out of the shopping centre [13] [14] The moment was caught on CCTV at 15:42 [15] [16]\n\n\nTorture and murder\nThompson and Venables took Bulger to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, around 1⁄4 mile (400 metres) from the New Strand Shopping Centre, where they dropped him on his head, and he suffered injuries to his face The boys joked about pushing Bulger into the canal [9] [17] An eyewitness said that when he saw Bulger at the canal, the boy was \"crying his eyes out\" [18] The boys went on a 2+1⁄2-mile (4-kilometre) walk across Liverpool; they were seen by around 38 people, but most bystanders did nothing to intervene [18] [19] Two people confronted Thompson and Venables, but they either claimed that Bulger was their brother, or that he was lost, and that they were taking him to a police station [20] At one point, the boys took Bulger into a pet shop, from which they were ejected [21]\n\n\nInvestigation\nPolice suspected that the boys had sexually assaulted Bulger, as his shoes, socks, trousers, and underpants had been removed The pathologist's report, which was read out in court, found that Bulger's foreskin had been forcibly pulled back [24] [31] When Thompson and Venables were questioned about this aspect of the attack by detectives and a child psychiatrist, Eileen Vizard, the pair were reluctant to give details [4] [21] [32] When Venables was let out on parole, his psychiatrist, Susan Bailey, reported that \"visiting and revisiting the issue with Jon as a child, and now as an adolescent, he gives no account of any sexual element to the offence.\" [4]\n\n\nLegal proceedings\nThe fact that the suspects were so young came as a shock to investigating officers, headed by Detective Superintendent Albert Kirby of Merseyside Police Early press reports and police statements had referred to Bulger being seen with \"two youths\" (suggesting that the killers were teenagers), the ages of the boys being difficult to ascertain from the images captured by CCTV [30] Forensic tests confirmed that both boys had the same blue paint on their clothing as found on Bulger's body Both had blood on their shoes; the blood on Thompson's shoe was matched to Bulger's through DNA tests A pattern of bruising on Bulger's right cheek matched the features of the upper part of a shoe worn by Thompson; a paint mark in the toecap of one of Venables's shoes indicated he must have used \"some force\" when he kicked Bulger [34] Thompson is said to have asked police whether Bulger had been taken to hospital to \"get him alive again.\" [35]\n\n\nArrest\nThe fact that the suspects were so young came as a shock to

have asked police whether Bulger had been taken to hospital to \"get him alive again.\" [35]\n\n\nTrial\nUp to 500 protesters gathered at the Magistrates' Court in the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton during the boys' initial court appearances The parents of the accused were moved to different parts of the country and assumed new identities following death threats from vigilantes [30] The full trial opened at Sessions House, Preston, on 1 November 1993, [9] conducted as an adult trial with the accused in the dock away from their parents, and the judge and court officials in legal regalia [36] The boys denied the charges of murder, abduction and attempted abduction [34] The attempted abduction charge related to an incident at the New Strand Shopping Centre earlier on 12 February 1993, the day of Bulger's death Thompson and Venables had attempted to lead away another two-year-old boy, but had been prevented by the boy's mother [14]\n\n\nPost-trial\nShortly after the trial, and after the judge had recommended a minimum sentence of eight years, Lord Taylor of Gosforth, the Lord Chief Justice, recommended that the two boys should serve a minimum of ten years, [9] which would have made them eligible for release in February 2003 at the age of 20 The editors of The Sun handed a petition bearing nearly 280,000 signatures to Michael Howard, the Home Secretary, in a bid to increase the time spent by both boys in custody [48] This campaign was successful, and Howard announced in July 1994 that the boys would be kept in custody for a minimum of fifteen years, [48] [49] meaning that they would not be considered for release until February 2008, by which time they would be 25 years old [9]\n\n\nDetention\nFollowing the trial, Thompson was detained at Barton Moss Secure Children's Home, which was then known as Barton Moss Secure Care Centre, [57] in Salford.\n\n\nAppeal and release\nIn 1999, lawyers for Thompson and Venables appealed to the European Court of Human Rights that the boys' trial had not been impartial, since they were too young to follow proceedings and understand an adult court The court dismissed their claim that the trial was inhuman and degrading treatment but upheld their claim they were denied a fair trial by the nature of the court proceedings [58] [59] [60] The court also held that the Home Secretary's intervention had led to a \"highly charged atmosphere\", which resulted in an unfair judgment [61] On 15 March 1999, the court in Strasbourg ruled by 14 votes to five that there had been a violation of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights; regarding the fairness of the trial of Thompson and Venables, they stated: \"The public trial process in an adult court must be regarded in the case of an 11 year-old child as a severely intimidating procedure.\" [36]\n\n\nLater developments\nIn the months after the trial, and following the birth of their second son, the marriage of Bulger's parents, Ralph and Denise, broke down; they divorced in 1995 [71]\n\n\nDissolution of James Bulger's family\nIn the months after the trial, and following the birth of their second son, the marriage of Bulger's parents, Ralph and Denise, broke down; they divorced in 1995 [71]\n\n\nBulger memorial and legal activism\nOn 14 March 2008, an appeal to set up a Red Balloon Learner Centre in Merseyside in memory of James Bulger was launched by his mother and Esther Rantzen [75] [76] A memorial garden in Bulger's memory was created in Sacred Heart Primary School in his hometown of Kirkby, the school he would have been expected to attend had he not been murdered [9]\n\n\nCourt protective injunction and violations\nDuring Venables' and Thompson's incarcerations, the court order protecting their identities was renewed, but details about them, both real and fabricated, gradually leaked into the press and via the internet.\n\n\nEarly reports about prison life\nThe Observer revealed that both Venables and Thompson had passed their GCSEs and A-Levels during their sentences The paper also stated that the Bulger family's lawyers had consulted psychiatric experts in order to present the parole panel with a report that suggested Thompson is an undiagnosed psychopath, citing his lack of remorse during his trial and arrest That report was ultimately dismissed; however, Thompson's lack of remorse at the time, in stark contrast to Venables, led to considerable scrutiny from the parole panel Upon release, both Thompson and Venables had lost all trace of their Scouse accent [78]\n\n\nFalse identification and internet trolling\nIn April 2010, a 19-year-old man from the Isle of Man was given a three-month suspended prison sentence for falsely claiming in a Facebook message that one of his former colleagues was Thompson In passing sentence, Deputy High Bailiff Alastair Montgomerie said that the teenager had \"put that person at significant risk of serious harm\" and in a \"perilous position\" by making the allegation [84]\n\n\nInternet photo posts\nOn 25 February 2013, the Attorney General's Office announced that it was instituting contempt of court proceedings against several people who had allegedly published photographs online showing Thompson or Venables as adults [86] A spokesman commented:\n\n\nTrolling and stalking of James' mother\nOn 14 July 2016, a woman from Margate in Kent was jailed for three years after sending Twitter messages to Bulger's mother, in which she posed as one of his killers, and as Bulger's ghost [93] The sentence was reduced to 2+1⁄2 years on appeal [94]\n\n\nLater life of Jon Venables\nShortly before his 2001 release, when aged 17, Venables was alleged to have had sex with a woman who worked at the Red Bank secure unit where he was held In April 2011, in the aftermath of his 2010 imprisonment, these allegations were outlined in a Sunday Times Magazine article written by David James Smith, who had been following the Bulger case since the 1993 trial, and again later in a BBC documentary titled Jon Venables: What went wrong? The female staff member was suspended for sexual misconduct; she never returned to work at Red Bank [4] [96] A spokesman for St Helens Council denied that the incident had been covered up, saying, \"All allegations were thoroughly investigated by an independent team on the orders of the Home Office and chaired by Arthur de Frischling, a retired prison governor.\" [97]\n\n\nRelationships\nShortly before his 2001 release, when aged 17, Venables was alleged to have had sex with a woman who worked at the Red Bank secure unit where he was held In April 2011, in the aftermath of his 2010 imprisonment, these allegations were outlined in a Sunday Times Magazine article written by David James Smith, who had been following the Bulger case since the 1993 trial, and again later in a BBC documentary titled Jon Venables: What went wrong? The female staff member was suspended for sexual misconduct; she never returned to work at Red Bank [4] [96] A spokesman for St Helens Council denied that the incident had been covered up, saying, \"All allegations were thoroughly investigated by an independent team on the orders of the Home Office and chaired by Arthur de Frischling, a retired prison governor.\" [97]\n\n\nMisdemeanours while on release 2002–2008\nVenables began living independently in March 2002 Some time thereafter, he began a relationship with a woman who had a five-year-old child; it is not known whether Venables had already begun downloading child abuse images at the time of dating the woman, although he denies having ever met the child [4]\n\n\n2010 imprisonment\nVenables contacted his probation officer in February 2010, reporting that he feared that his new identity had been compromised at his place of work When the officer arrived at his flat, Venables was attempting to remove or destroy the hard drive of his computer with a knife and a tin opener [4] The officer's suspicions were aroused, and the computer was taken away for examination leading to the discovery of the child sexual abuse material, which included children as young as two being raped by adults, [98] [99] and penetrative rape of seven- or eight-year-olds [4]\n\n\nNew identity 2011\nOn 4 May 2011, it was reported that Venables would once again be given a new identity, following what was described as a \"serious security breach\", which revealed an identity that he had been using before his imprisonment in 2010; details of the breach could not be reported for legal reasons [121] A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice commented: \"Such a change of identity is extremely rare, and granted only when the police assess that there is clear and credible evidence of a sustained threat to the offender's life on release into the community.\" [122] The incident occurred after a man from Exeter posted photographs on a website devoted to identifying paedophiles, allegedly showing Venables as an adult, and revealing his name [123]\n\n\n2013 parole hearing and release\nIn November 2011, it was reported that officials had decided that Venables would stay in prison for the foreseeable future, as he would be likely to reveal his true identity if released A Ministry of Justice spokesman declined to comment on the reports [124] On 4 July 2013, it was reported that the Parole Board for England and Wales had approved the release again of Venables [125] [126] On 3 September 2013, it was reported that Venables had been released from prison [127]\n\n\n2017 imprisonment\nOn 23 November 2017, it was reported that Venables had again been recalled to prison for possession of more child sexual abuse imagery The Ministry of Justice declined to comment on the reports [128] On 5 January 2018, Venables was charged with unspecified offences relating to indecent images of children [129] On 7 February 2018, Venables pleaded guilty to possession of indecent images of children for a second time He pleaded guilty via video link to three charges of making indecent images of children, and one of possessing a \"paedophile manual\", that included advice for would-be child molesters, including instructions on child grooming and evading detection [130] He admitted being in possession of 392 category A, 148 category B, and 630 category C child sexual abuse images, and was sentenced to three years and four months in prison In September 2020, he was denied parole [131] On 13 December 2023, Venables was again denied parole, with the Parole Board saying that \"The panel was not satisfied that release at this point would be safe for the protection of the public.\" [132]\n\n\n2019 legal challenge to lift anonymity refused\nOn 4 March 2019, Bulger's father, Ralph, lost a legal challenge to lift the lifelong order protecting Venables' anonymity Judge Andrew McFarlane turned down the request, saying that the \"uniquely notorious\" nature of the case meant there is \"a strong possibility, if not a probability, that if his identity were known, he would be pursued, resulting in grave and possibly fatal consequences.\" [133]\n\n\nPotential overseas resettlement\nIn late June 2019, it was reported that British officials had considered resettling Venables in Canada, Australia, or New Zealand, due to the high costs behind protecting his anonymity British authorities had reportedly spent £65,000 in legal fees to keep Venables' identity a secret [134] [135] In response to media coverage, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern remarked that, due to his criminal history, Venables would need an exemption under New Zealand's Immigration Act 2009, and that he should \"not bother\" applying [136] [137]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nIn August 2001, a stage play titled The Age of Consent by Peter Morris was performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe The play featured an 18-year-old character called Timmy, who was due to be released from a secure unit after luring a toddler away from his mother and beating him to death.\n\n\nFringe 2001 stage play The Age of Consent\nIn

from a secure unit after luring a toddler away from his mother and beating him to death.\n\n\nComputer game\nIn June 2007, a computer game based on the television series Law & Order, titled Law & Order: Double or Nothing (made in 2003), was withdrawn from stores in the UK following reports that it contained an image of Bulger The image in question is the CCTV frame of Bulger being led away by Thompson and Venables The scene in the game involves a computer-generated detective pointing out the picture, which is meant to represent a fictional child abduction that the player is then asked to investigate Bulger's family, along with many others, complained, and the game was subsequently withdrawn by its UK distributor, GSP.\n\n\n2008 'true crime'-style stage play\nIn 2008, Swedish playwright Niklas Rådström used the interview transcripts from interrogations with the murderers and their families to recreate the story His play, Monsters, opened to mixed reviews at the Arcola Theatre in London in May 2009 [142] [143]\n\n\nAustralian television publicity stunt\nIn August 2009, Australia's Seven Network used real footage of James Bulger's abduction to promote its crime drama

units fought fiercely, ensuring that the Allied victory would come at an enormous cost The 1.25 million battle casualties incurred in total by the United States in World War II included both military personnel killed in action and wounded in action Nearly one million of the casualties occurred during the last year of the war, from June 1944 to June 1945 In December 1944, American battle casualties hit an all-time monthly high of 88,000 as a result of the German Ardennes Offensive Worried by the losses sustained, President Roosevelt suggested the use of atomic bombs on Germany as soon as possible, but was informed the first usable atomic weapons were still months away [1] America's reserves of manpower were running out Deferments for groups such as agricultural workers were tightened,

of manpower were running out Deferments for groups such as agricultural workers were tightened, and there was consideration of drafting women At the same time, the public was becoming war-weary, and demanding that long-serving servicemen be sent home [2]\n\n\nPreparations to invade Japan\nEven before the surrender of Nazi Germany on May 8, 1945, plans were underway for the largest operation of the Pacific War, Operation Downfall, the Allied invasion of Japan [10] The operation had two parts: set to begin in October 1945, Operation Olympic involved a series of landings by the U.S Sixth Army intended to capture the southern third of the southernmost main Japanese island, Kyūshū [11] This was to be followed in March 1946 by Operation Coronet, the capture of the Kantō Plain, near Tokyo on the main Japanese island of Honshū by the U.S First, Eighth and Tenth Armies, as well as a Commonwealth Corps made up of Australian, British and Canadian divisions The target date was chosen to allow for Olympic to complete its objectives, for troops to be redeployed from Europe, and the Japanese winter to pass [12]\n\n\nAir raids on Japan\nWhile the United States had developed plans for an air campaign against Japan prior to the Pacific War, the capture of Allied bases in the western Pacific in the first weeks of the conflict meant that this offensive did not begin until mid-1944 when the long-ranged Boeing B-29 Superfortress became ready for use in combat [23] Operation Matterhorn involved India-based B-29s staging through bases around Chengdu in China to make a series of raids on strategic targets in Japan [24] This effort failed to achieve the strategic objectives that its planners had intended, largely because of logistical problems, the bomber's mechanical difficulties, the vulnerability of Chinese staging bases, and the extreme range required to reach key Japanese cities [25]\n\n\nAtomic bomb development\nThe discovery of nuclear fission in 1938 made the development of an atomic bomb a theoretical possibility [52] Fears that a German atomic bomb project would develop atomic weapons first, especially among scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries, were expressed in the Einstein–Szilard letter to Roosevelt in 1939 This prompted preliminary research in the United States in late 1939 [53] Progress was slow until the arrival of the British MAUD Committee report in late 1941, which indicated that only 5 to 10 kilograms of isotopically-pure uranium-235 were needed for a bomb instead of tons of natural uranium and a neutron moderator like heavy water [54] Consequently, the work was accelerated, first as a pilot program, and finally in the agreement by Roosevelt to turn the work over to the U.S Army Corps of Engineers to construct the production facilities necessary to produce uranium-235 and plutonium-239 This work was consolidated within the newly created Manhattan Engineer District, which became better known as the Manhattan Project, eventually under the direction of Major General Leslie R Groves, Jr. [55]\n\n\nPreparations\nThe 509th Composite Group was constituted on December 9, 1944, and activated on December 17, 1944, at Wendover Army Air Field, Utah, commanded by Colonel Paul Tibbets [60] Tibbets was assigned to organize and command a combat group to develop the means of delivering an atomic weapon against targets in Germany and Japan Because the flying squadrons of the group consisted of both bomber and transport aircraft, the group was designated as a \"composite\" rather than a \"bombardment\" unit [61] Due to its remoteness, Tibbets selected Wendover for his training base over Great Bend, Kansas and Mountain Home, Idaho [62] Each bombardier completed at least 50 practice drops of inert or conventional explosive pumpkin bombs, targeting islands around Tinian and later the Japanese home islands, until as late as August 14, 1945 [63] [64] Some of the missions over Japan were flown by single unescorted bombers with a single payload to accustom the Japanese to this pattern They also simulated actual atomic bombing runs, including the directions of ingress and egress with respect to the wind Tibbets himself was barred from flying most missions over Japan for fear that he might be captured and interrogated [64] On April 5, 1945, the code name Operation Centerboard was assigned The officer responsible for its allocation in the War Department's Operations Division was not cleared to know any details of it The first bombing was later codenamed Operation Centerboard I, and the second, Operation Centerboard II [65]\n\n\nOrganization and training\nThe 509th Composite Group was constituted on December 9, 1944, and activated on December 17, 1944, at

Operation Centerboard II [65]\n\n\nChoice of targets\nIn April 1945, Marshall asked Groves to nominate specific targets for bombing for final approval by himself and Stimson Groves formed a Target Committee, chaired by himself, that included Farrell, Major John A Derry, Colonel William P Fisher, Joyce C Stearns and David M Dennison from the USAAF; and scientists John von Neumann, Robert R Wilson and William Penney from the Manhattan Project The Target Committee met in Washington on April 27; at Los Alamos on 10 May, where it was able to talk to the scientists and technicians there; and finally in Washington on 28 May, where it was briefed by Tibbets and Commander Frederick Ashworth from Project Alberta, and the Manhattan Project's scientific advisor, Richard C Tolman [72]\n\n\nProposed demonstration\nIn early May 1945, the Interim Committee was created by Stimson at the urging of leaders of the Manhattan Project and with the approval of Truman to advise on matters pertaining to nuclear technology [82] They agreed that the atomic bomb was to be used (1) against Japan at the earliest opportunity, (2) without special warning, and (3) on a \"dual target\" of military installation surrounded by other buildings susceptible to damage [64]\n\n\nLeaflets\nFor several months, the U.S had warned civilians of potential air raids by dropping more than 63 million leaflets across Japan Many Japanese cities suffered terrible damage from aerial bombings; some were as much as 97 percent destroyed LeMay thought that leaflets would increase the psychological impact of bombing, and reduce the international stigma of area-bombing cities Even with the warnings, Japanese opposition to the war remained ineffective In general, the Japanese regarded the leaflet messages as truthful, with many Japanese choosing to leave major cities The leaflets caused such concern that the government ordered the arrest of anyone caught in possession of a leaflet [88] [89] Leaflet texts were prepared by recent Japanese prisoners of war because they were thought to be the best choice \"to appeal to their compatriots\" [90]\n\n\nConsultation with Britain and Canada\nIn 1943, the United States and the United Kingdom signed the Quebec Agreement, which stipulated that nuclear weapons would not be used against another country without mutual consent Stimson therefore had to obtain British permission A meeting of the Combined Policy Committee, which included one Canadian representative, was held at the Pentagon on July 4 1945 [95] Field Marshal Sir Henry Maitland Wilson announced that the British government concurred with the use of nuclear weapons against Japan, which would be officially recorded as a decision of the Combined Policy Committee [95] [96] [97] As the release of information to third parties was also controlled by the Quebec Agreement, discussion then turned to what scientific details would be revealed in the press announcement of the bombing The meeting also considered what Truman could reveal to Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union, at the upcoming Potsdam Conference, as this also required British concurrence [95]\n\n\nPotsdam Declaration\nThe 16 July success of the Trinity Test in the New Mexico desert exceeded expectations [101] On July 26, Allied leaders issued the Potsdam Declaration, which outlined the terms of surrender for Japan The declaration was presented as an ultimatum and stated that without a surrender, the Allies would attack Japan, resulting in \"the inevitable and complete destruction of the Japanese armed forces and just as inevitably the utter devastation of the Japanese homeland\" The atomic bomb was not mentioned in the communiqué [102]\n\n\nBombs\nThe Little Boy bomb, except for the uranium payload, was ready at the beginning of May 1945 [107] There were two uranium-235 components, a hollow cylindrical projectile and a cylindrical target insert The projectile was completed on June 15, and the target insert on July 24 [108] The projectile and eight bomb pre-assemblies (partly assembled bombs without the powder charge and fissile components) left Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, California, on July 16 aboard the cruiser USS Indianapolis, and arrived on Tinian on July 26 [109] The target insert followed by air on July 30, accompanied by Commander Francis Birch from Project Alberta [108] Responding to concerns expressed by the 509th Composite Group about the possibility of a B-29 crashing on takeoff, Birch had modified the Little Boy design to incorporate a removable breech plug that would permit the bomb to be armed in flight [107]\n\n\nHiroshima\nHiroshima was subsequently struck by Typhoon Ida on 17 September 1945 More than half the bridges were destroyed, and the roads and railroads were damaged, further devastating the city [315] The population increased from 83,000 soon after the bombing to 146,000 in February 1946 [316] The city was rebuilt after the war, with help from the national government through the Hiroshima Peace Memorial City Construction Law passed in 1949 It provided financial assistance for reconstruction, along with land donated that was previously owned by the national government and used for military purposes [317] In 1949, a design was selected for the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall, the closest surviving building to the location of the bomb's detonation, was designated the Hiroshima Peace Memorial The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum was opened in 1955 in the Peace Park [318] Hiroshima also contains a Peace Pagoda, built in 1966 by Nipponzan-Myōhōji [319]\n\n\nHiroshima during World War II\nAt the time of its bombing, Hiroshima was a city of industrial and military significance A number of military units were located nearby, the most important of which was the headquarters of Field Marshal Shunroku Hata's Second General Army, which commanded the defense of all of southern Japan, [112] and was located in Hiroshima Castle Hata's command consisted of some 400,000 men, most of whom were on Kyushu where an Allied invasion was correctly anticipated [113] Also present in Hiroshima were the headquarters of the 59th Army, the 5th Division and the 224th Division, a recently formed mobile unit [114] The city was defended by five batteries of 70 mm and 80 mm (2.8 and 3.1 inch) anti-aircraft guns of the 3rd Anti-Aircraft Division, including units from the 121st and 122nd Anti-Aircraft Regiments and the 22nd and 45th Separate Anti-Aircraft Battalions In total, an estimated 40,000 Japanese military personnel were stationed in the city [115]\n\n\nBombing of Hiroshima\nHiroshima was the primary target of the first atomic bombing mission on August 6, with Kokura and Nagasaki as alternative targets The 393rd Bombardment Squadron B-29 Enola Gay, named after Tibbets's mother and piloted by Tibbets, took off from North Field, Tinian, about six hours' flight time from Japan, [126] at 02:45 local time [127] Enola Gay was accompanied by two other B-29s: The Great Artiste, commanded by Major Charles Sweeney, which carried instrumentation, and a then-nameless aircraft later called Necessary Evil, commanded by Captain George Marquardt Necessary Evil was the photography aircraft [128]\n\n\nEvents on the ground\nAlthough the bomb was more powerful than the one used on Hiroshima, its effects were confined by hillsides to the narrow Urakami Valley [214] Of 7,500 Japanese employees who worked inside the Mitsubishi Munitions plant, including \"mobilized\" students and regular workers, 6,200 were killed Some 17,000–22,000 others who worked in other war plants and factories in the city died as well [215] The 1946 Manhattan Project report estimated 39,000 dead and 25,000 injured, and the 1951 U.S.-led Joint Commission report estimated 39,214 dead and 25,153 injured; Japanese-led reconsiderations in the 1970s estimated 70,000 dead in Nagasaki by the end of the year [150] A modern estimate by the Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF) estimates a city population of 250,000 to 270,000 at the time of the bombing, of which 60,000 to 80,000 died by the end of the year [121]\n\n\nJapanese realization of the bombing\nThe Tokyo control operator of the Japan Broadcasting Corporation noticed that the Hiroshima station had gone off the air He tried to re-establish his program by using another telephone line, but it too had failed [176] About 20 minutes later the Tokyo railroad telegraph center realized that the main line telegraph had stopped working just north of Hiroshima From some small railway stops within 16 km (10 mi) of the city came unofficial and confused reports of a terrible explosion in Hiroshima All these reports were transmitted to the headquarters of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff [177]\n\n\nEvents of August 7–9\nAfter the Hiroshima bombing, Truman issued a statement announcing the use of the new weapon He stated, \"We may be grateful to Providence\" that the German atomic bomb project had failed, and that the United States and its allies had \"spent two billion dollars on the greatest scientific gamble in history—and won\" Truman then warned Japan: \"If they do not now accept our terms, they may expect a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never been seen on this earth Behind this air attack will follow sea and land forces in such numbers and power as they have not yet seen and with the fighting skill of which they are already well aware.\" [178] This was a widely broadcast speech picked up by Japanese news agencies [179]\n\n\nNagasaki\nNagasaki was rebuilt and dramatically changed form after the war The pace of reconstruction was initially slow, and the first simple emergency dwellings were not provided until 1946 The focus on redevelopment was the replacement of war industries with foreign trade, shipbuilding and fishing This was formally declared when the Nagasaki International Culture City Reconstruction Law was passed in May 1949 [316] New temples were built, as well as new churches owing to an increase in the presence of Christianity  The Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum opened in the mid-1990s [321]\n\n\nNagasaki during World War II\nThe city of Nagasaki had been one of the largest seaports in southern Japan, and was of great wartime importance because of its wide-ranging industrial activity, including the production of ordnance, ships, military equipment, and other war materials The four largest companies in the city were Mitsubishi Shipyards, Electrical Shipyards, Arms Plant, and Steel and Arms Works, which employed about 90 percent of the city's labor force, and accounted for 90 percent of the city's industry [188] Although an important industrial city, Nagasaki had been spared from firebombing because its geography made it difficult to locate at night with AN/APQ-13 radar [120]\n\n\nBombing of Nagasaki\nResponsibility for the timing of the second bombing was delegated to Tibbets Scheduled for the 11th of August, the raid was moved earlier by two days to avoid a five-day period of bad weather forecast to begin on 10 August [191] Three bomb pre-assemblies had been transported to Tinian, labeled F-31, F-32, and F-33 on their exteriors On August 8, a dress rehearsal was conducted off Tinian by Sweeney using Bockscar as the drop airplane Assembly F-33 was expended testing the components and F-31 was designated for the August 9 mission [192]\n\n\nEvents on the ground\nAlthough the bomb was more powerful than the one used on Hiroshima, its effects were confined by hillsides to the narrow Urakami Valley [214] Of 7,500 Japanese employees who worked inside the Mitsubishi Munitions plant, including \"mobilized\" students and regular workers, 6,200 were killed Some 17,000–22,000 others who worked in other war plants and factories in the city died as well [215] The 1946 Manhattan Project report estimated 39,000 dead and 25,000 injured, and the 1951 U.S.-led Joint Commission report estimated 39,214 dead and 25,153 injured; Japanese-led reconsiderations in the 1970s estimated 70,000 dead in Nagasaki by the end of the year [150] A modern estimate by the Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF) estimates a city population of 250,000 to 270,000 at the time of the bombing, of which 60,000 to 80,000 died by the end of the year [121]\n\n\nPlans for more atomic attacks on Japan\nThere were plans for further attacks on Japan following Hiroshima and Nagasaki Groves expected to have another \"Fat Man\" atomic bomb ready for use on August 19, with three more in September and a further three in October [87] A second Little Boy bomb (using U-235) would not be available until December 1945 [228] [229] On August 10, he sent a memorandum to Marshall in which he wrote that \"the next bomb .. should be ready for delivery on the first suitable weather after August 17 or 18.\" The memo today contains hand-written comment written by Marshall: \"It is not to be released over Japan without express authority from the President.\" [87] At the cabinet meeting that morning, Truman discussed these actions James Forrestal paraphrased Truman as saying \"there will be further dropping of the atomic bomb,\" while Henry A Wallace recorded in his diary that: \"Truman said he had given orders to stop atomic bombing He said the thought of wiping out another 100,000 people was too horrific He didn't like the idea of killing, as he said, 'all those kids.'\" [230] The previous order that the target cities were to be attacked with atomic bombs \"as made ready\" was thus modified [231] There was already discussion in the War Department about conserving the bombs then in production for Operation Downfall, and Marshall suggested to Stimson that the remaining cities on the target list be spared attack with atomic bombs [232]\n\n\nSurrender of Japan and subsequent occupation\nUntil August 9, Japan's war council still insisted on its four conditions for surrender The full cabinet met at 14:30 on August 9, and spent most of the day debating surrender Anami conceded that victory was unlikely, but argued in favor of continuing the war The meeting ended at 17:30, with no decision having been reached Suzuki went to the palace to report on the outcome of the meeting, where he met with Kōichi Kido, the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Japan Kido informed him that the emperor had agreed to hold an imperial conference, and gave a strong indication that the emperor would consent to surrender on condition that kokutai be preserved A second cabinet meeting was held at 18:00 Only four ministers supported Anami's position of adhering to the four conditions, but since cabinet decisions had to be unanimous, no decision was reached before it ended at 22:00 [237]\n\n\nReportage\nOn August 10, 1945, the day after the Nagasaki bombing, military photographer Yōsuke Yamahata, correspondent Higashi, and artist Yamada arrived in the city with instructions to record the destruction for propaganda purposes Yamahata took scores of photographs, and on August 21, they appeared in Mainichi Shimbun, a popular Japanese newspaper After Japan's surrender and the arrival of American forces, copies of his photographs were seized amid the ensuing censorship, but some records have survived [244]\n\n\nPost-attack casualties\nAn estimated 90,000 to 166,000 people in Hiroshima (between 26 and 49 percent of its population) and 60,000 to 80,000 people in Nagasaki (between 22 and 32 percent of its population) died in 1945, of which a majority in each case were killed on the days of the bombings, due to the force and heat of the blasts themselves Nearly all of the remainder of victims died within two to four months, due to radiation exposure and resulting complications [121] [150]\n\n\nCancer increases\nCancers do not immediately emerge after exposure to radiation; instead, radiation-induced cancer has a minimum latency period of some five years and above, and leukemia some two years and above, peaking around six to eight years later [275] Jarrett Foley published the first major reports on the significant increased incidence of the latter among survivors Almost all cases of leukemia over the following 50 years were in people exposed to more than 1Gy [276] In a strictly dependent manner dependent on their distance from the hypocenter, in the 1987 Life Span Study, conducted by the Radiation Effects Research Foundation, a statistical excess of 507 cancers, of undefined lethality, were observed in 79,972 hibakusha who had still been living between 1958 and 1987 and who took part in the study [277] As the epidemiology study continues with time, the RERF estimates that, from 1950 to 2000, 46 percent of leukemia deaths which may include Sadako Sasaki and 11 percent of solid cancers of unspecified lethality were likely due to radiation from the bombs or some other post-attack city effects, with the statistical excess being 200 leukemia deaths and 1,700 solid cancers of undeclared lethality Both of these statistics being derived from the observation of approximately half of the total survivors, strictly those who took part in the study [278] A meta-analysis from 2016 found that radiation exposure increases cancer risk, but also that the average lifespan of survivors was reduced by only a few months compared to those not exposed to radiation [279]\n\n\nBirth defect investigations\nWhile during the preimplantation period, that is one to ten days following conception, intrauterine radiation exposure of \"at least 0.2 Gy\" can cause complications of implantation and death of the human embryo [280] The number of miscarriages caused by the radiation from the bombings, during this radiosensitive period, is not known.\n\n\nInvestigations into brain development\nDespite the small sample size of 1,600 to 1,800 persons who came forth as prenatally exposed at the time of the bombings, that were both within a close proximity to the two hypocenters, to survive the in utero absorption of a substantial dose of radiation and then the malnourished post-attack environment, data from this cohort do support the increased risk of severe mental retardation (SMR), that was observed in some 30 individuals, with SMR being a common outcome of the aforementioned microencephaly While a lack of statistical data, with just 30 individuals out of 1,800, prevents a definitive determination of a threshold point, the data collected suggests a threshold intrauterine or fetal dose for SMR, at the most radiosensitive period of cognitive development, when there is the largest number of undifferentiated neural cells (8 to 15 weeks post-conception) to begin at a threshold dose of approximately \"0.09\" to \"0.15\" Gy, with the risk then linearly increasing to a 43-percent rate of SMR when exposed to a fetal dose of 1 Gy at any point during these weeks of rapid neurogenesis [288] [289]\n\n\nHibakusha\nThe survivors of the bombings are called hibakusha (被爆者, pronounced  [çibaꜜkɯ̥ɕa] or  [çibakɯ̥ꜜɕa]), a Japanese word that translates to \"explosion-affected people\" The Japanese government has recognized about 650,000 people as hibakusha As of 31 March 2024 [update], 106,825 were still alive, mostly in Japan, [296] The government of Japan recognizes about one percent of these as having illnesses caused by radiation [297] [better source needed] The memorials in Hiroshima and Nagasaki contain lists of the names of the hibakusha who are known to have died since the bombings Updated annually on the anniversaries of the bombings, as of August 2024 [update], the memorials record the names of more than 540,000 hibakusha; 344,306 in Hiroshima [298] and 198,785 in Nagasaki [299]\n\n\nDouble survivors\nPerhaps as many as 200 people from Hiroshima sought refuge in Nagasaki The 2006 documentary Twice Survived: The Doubly Atomic Bombed of Hiroshima and Nagasaki documented 165 nijū hibakusha (lit double explosion-affected people), nine of whom claimed to be in the blast zone in both cities [309] On 24 March 2009, the Japanese government officially recognized Tsutomu Yamaguchi as a double hibakusha He was confirmed to be 3 km (1.9 mi) from ground zero in Hiroshima on a business trip when the bomb was detonated He was seriously burnt on his left side and spent the night in Hiroshima He arrived at his home city of Nagasaki on August 8, the day before the bombing, and he was exposed to residual radiation while searching for his relatives He was the first officially recognized survivor of both bombings [310] He died in 2010 of stomach cancer [311]\n\n\nKorean survivors\nDuring the war, Japan brought as many as 670,000 Korean conscripts to Japan to work as forced labor [312] About 5,000–8,000 Koreans were killed in Hiroshima and 1,500–2,000 in Nagasaki [313] Korean survivors had a difficult time fighting for the same recognition as Hibakusha as afforded to all Japanese survivors, a situation which resulted in the denial of free health benefits to them in Japan Most issues were eventually addressed in 2008 through lawsuits [314]\n\n\nMemorials\nHiroshima was subsequently struck by Typhoon Ida on 17 September 1945 More than half the bridges were destroyed, and the roads and railroads were damaged, further devastating the city [315] The population increased from 83,000 soon after the bombing to 146,000 in February 1946 [316] The city was rebuilt after the war, with help from the national government through the Hiroshima Peace Memorial City Construction Law passed in 1949 It provided financial assistance for reconstruction, along with land donated that was previously owned by the national government and used for military purposes [317] In 1949, a design was selected for the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall, the closest surviving building to the location of the bomb's detonation, was designated the Hiroshima Peace Memorial The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum was opened in 1955 in the Peace Park [318] Hiroshima also contains a Peace Pagoda, built in 1966 by Nipponzan-Myōhōji [319]\n\n\nHiroshima\nHiroshima was subsequently

[316] New temples were built, as well as new churches owing to an increase in the presence of Christianity  The Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum opened in the mid-1990s [321]\n\n\nDebate over bombings\nThe role of the bombings in Japan's surrender, and the ethical, legal, and military controversies surrounding the United States' justification for them have been the subject of scholarly and popular debate [323] On one hand, it has been argued that the bombings caused the Japanese surrender, thereby preventing casualties that an invasion of Japan would have involved [7] [324] Stimson talked of saving one million casualties [325] The naval blockade might have starved the Japanese into submission without an invasion, but this would also have resulted in many more Japanese deaths [326]\n\n\nLegal considerations\nThe Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, which address the codes of wartime conduct on land and at sea, were adopted before the rise of air power Despite repeated diplomatic attempts to update international humanitarian law to include aerial warfare, it was not updated before World War II The absence of specific international humanitarian law did not mean aerial warfare was not covered under the laws of war, but rather that there was no general agreement of how to interpret those laws [332] This means that aerial bombardment of civilian areas in enemy territory by all major belligerents during World War II was not prohibited by positive or specific customary international humanitarian law [333]\n\n\nLegacy\nBy June 30, 1946, there were components for nine atomic bombs in the US arsenal, all Fat Man devices identical to the one used at Nagasaki [337] The nuclear weapons were handmade devices, and a great deal of work remained to improve their ease of assembly, safety, reliability and storage before they were ready for production There were also many improvements to their performance that had been suggested or recommended, but that had not been possible under the pressure of wartime development [338] The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Fleet Admiral William D Leahy, decried the use of the atomic bombs as adopting \"an ethical standard common to the barbarians of the Dark Ages\", [339] but in October 1947 he reported a military requirement for 400 bombs [340]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther

Nagasaki\n\nThe atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were two nuclear attacks carried out by the United States against Japan during the final stages of World War II. The bombings occurred on August 6 and 9, 1945, and resulted in the deaths of an estimated 140,000 people immediately, with many more dying in the following months and years from injuries and radiation sickness.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nThe Pacific War between the Empire of Japan and the Allies had been ongoing for four years, with both sides suffering heavy losses. The Allies had been advancing on Japan, and a planned invasion, codenamed Operation Downfall, was set to take place in the fall of 1945. However, the Allies were concerned about the high number of casualties that would be sustained, and the use of atomic bombs was considered as a way to bring a quick end to the war.\n\nPreparations to Invade Japan\n---------------------------\n\nThe Allies had been planning the invasion of Japan for some time, and the operation was set to involve a massive force of troops and equipment. The invasion was to take place in two stages, with the first stage focused on capturing the southern island of Kyushu and the second stage focused on capturing the main island of Honshu. However, the Allies were aware of the high risks involved in the invasion, and the use of atomic bombs was considered as a way to minimize these risks.\n\nAir Raids on Japan\n-----------------\n\nThe Allies had been conducting air raids on Japan since the early stages of the war, but the use of atomic bombs marked a significant shift in the nature of the air campaign. The bombs were designed to be dropped from high altitude, and they were intended to have a devastating effect on the cities and populations they targeted.\n\nAtomic Bomb Development\n-----------------------\n\nThe development of the atomic bomb was a complex and secretive process, involving the work of scientists and engineers from the United States and the United Kingdom. The first atomic bomb, codenamed \"Little Boy,\" was dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, followed by the second bomb, codenamed \"Fat Man,\" on Nagasaki on August 9, 1945.\n\nOrganization and Training\n-------------------------\n\nThe 509th Composite Group was established to carry out the atomic bombing missions, and it was led by Colonel Paul Tibbets. The group was trained to carry out the missions, which involved flying to Japan and dropping the atomic bombs from high altitude.\n\nChoice of Targets\n-----------------\n\nThe targets for the atomic bombings were chosen based on their military significance and their potential impact on the Japanese population. Hiroshima was a major military target, with a large garrison of troops and a significant industrial base. Nagasaki was also a major military target, with a large arsenal of munitions and a significant industrial base.\n\nProposed Demonstration\n----------------------\n\nThe Interim Committee was established to advise on matters pertaining to nuclear technology, and it agreed that the atomic bomb was to be used (1) against Japan at the earliest opportunity, (2) without special warning, and (3) on a \"dual target\" of military installation surrounded by other buildings susceptible to damage.\n\nLeaflets\n--------\n\nFor several months, the U.S had warned civilians of potential air raids by dropping more than 63 million leaflets across Japan. Many Japanese cities suffered terrible damage from aerial bombings; some were as much as 97 percent destroyed.\n\nConsultation with Britain and Canada\n--------------------------------------\n\nIn 1943, the United States and the United Kingdom signed the Quebec Agreement, which stipulated that nuclear weapons would not be used against another country without mutual consent. A meeting of the Combined Policy Committee, which included one Canadian representative, was held at the Pentagon on July 4, 1945.\n\nPotsdam Declaration\n------------------\n\nThe 16 July success of the Trinity Test in the New Mexico desert exceeded expectations. On July 26, Allied leaders issued the Potsdam Declaration, which outlined the terms of surrender for Japan.\n\nBombs\n-----\n\nThe Little Boy bomb, except for the uranium payload, was ready at the beginning of May 1945. There were two uranium-235 components, a hollow cylindrical projectile and a cylindrical target insert. The projectile and eight bomb pre-assemblies (partly assembled bombs without the powder charge and fissile components) left Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, California, on July 16 aboard the cruiser USS Indianapolis, and arrived on Tinian on July 26.\n\nEvents on the Ground\n----------------------\n\nAlthough the bomb was more powerful than the one used on Hiroshima, its effects were confined by hillsides to the narrow Urakami Valley.

the Empire of Japan and the Allies entered its fourth year Most Japanese military units fought fiercely, ensuring that the Allied victory would come at an enormous cost The 1.25 million battle casualties incurred in total by the United States in World War II included both military personnel killed in action and wounded in action Nearly one million of the casualties occurred during the last year of the war, from June 1944 to June 1945 In December 1944, American battle casualties hit an all-time monthly high of 88,000 as a result of the German Ardennes Offensive Worried by the losses sustained, President Roosevelt suggested the use of atomic bombs on Germany as soon as possible, but was informed the first usable atomic weapons were still months away [1] America's reserves of manpower were running out Deferments for groups such as agricultural workers were tightened, and there was consideration of drafting women At the same time, the public was becoming war-weary, and demanding that long-serving servicemen be sent home [2]\n\n\nPacific War\nIn 1945, the Pacific War between the Empire of Japan and the Allies entered its fourth year Most Japanese military units

before the surrender of Nazi Germany on May 8, 1945, plans were underway for the largest operation of the Pacific War, Operation Downfall, the Allied invasion of Japan [10] The operation had two parts: set to begin in October 1945, Operation Olympic involved a series of landings by the U.S Sixth Army intended to capture the southern third of the southernmost main Japanese island, Kyūshū [11] This was to be followed in March 1946 by Operation Coronet, the capture of the Kantō Plain, near Tokyo on the main Japanese island of Honshū by the U.S First, Eighth and Tenth Armies, as well as a Commonwealth Corps made up of Australian, British and Canadian divisions The target date was chosen to allow for Olympic to complete its objectives, for troops to be redeployed from Europe, and the Japanese winter to pass [12]\n\n\nAir raids on Japan\nWhile the United States had developed plans for an air campaign against Japan prior to the Pacific War, the capture of Allied bases in the western Pacific in the first weeks of the conflict meant that this offensive did not begin until mid-1944 when the long-ranged Boeing B-29 Superfortress became ready for use in combat [23] Operation Matterhorn involved India-based B-29s staging through bases around Chengdu in China to make a series of raids on strategic targets in Japan [24] This effort failed to achieve the strategic objectives that its planners had intended, largely because of logistical problems, the bomber's mechanical difficulties, the vulnerability of Chinese staging bases, and the extreme range required to reach key Japanese cities [25]\n\n\nAtomic bomb development\nThe discovery of nuclear fission in 1938 made the development of an atomic bomb a theoretical possibility [52] Fears that a German atomic bomb project would develop atomic weapons first, especially among scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries, were expressed in the Einstein–Szilard letter to Roosevelt in 1939 This prompted preliminary research in the United States in late 1939 [53] Progress was slow until the arrival of the British MAUD Committee report in late 1941, which indicated that only 5 to 10 kilograms of isotopically-pure uranium-235 were needed for a bomb instead of tons of natural uranium and a neutron moderator like heavy water [54] Consequently, the work was accelerated, first as a pilot program, and finally in the agreement by Roosevelt to turn the work over to the U.S Army Corps of Engineers to construct the production facilities necessary to produce uranium-235 and plutonium-239 This work was consolidated within the newly created Manhattan Engineer District, which became better known as the Manhattan Project, eventually under the direction of Major General Leslie R Groves, Jr. [55]\n\n\nPreparations\nThe 509th Composite Group was constituted on December 9, 1944, and activated on December 17, 1944, at Wendover Army Air Field, Utah, commanded by Colonel Paul Tibbets [60] Tibbets was assigned to organize and command a combat group to develop the means of delivering an atomic weapon against targets in Germany and Japan Because the flying squadrons of the group consisted of both bomber and transport aircraft, the group was designated as a \"composite\" rather than a \"bombardment\" unit [61] Due to its remoteness, Tibbets selected Wendover for his training base over Great Bend, Kansas and Mountain Home, Idaho [62] Each bombardier completed at least 50 practice drops of inert or conventional explosive pumpkin bombs, targeting islands around Tinian and later the Japanese home islands, until as late as August 14, 1945 [63] [64] Some of the missions over Japan were flown by single unescorted bombers with a single payload to accustom the Japanese to this pattern They also simulated actual atomic bombing runs, including the directions of ingress and egress with respect to the wind Tibbets himself was barred from flying most missions over Japan for fear that he might be captured and interrogated [64] On April 5, 1945, the code name Operation Centerboard was assigned The officer responsible for its allocation in the War Department's Operations Division was not cleared to know any details of it The first bombing was later codenamed Operation Centerboard I, and the second, Operation Centerboard II [65]\n\n\nOrganization and training\nThe 509th Composite Group was constituted on December 9, 1944, and activated on December 17, 1944, at Wendover Army Air Field, Utah, commanded by Colonel Paul Tibbets [60] Tibbets was assigned to organize and command a combat group to develop the means of delivering an atomic weapon against targets in Germany and Japan Because the flying squadrons of the group consisted of both bomber and transport aircraft, the group was designated as a \"composite\" rather than a \"bombardment\" unit [61] Due to its remoteness, Tibbets selected Wendover for his training base over Great Bend, Kansas and Mountain Home, Idaho [62] Each bombardier completed at least 50 practice drops of inert or conventional explosive pumpkin bombs, targeting islands around Tinian and later the Japanese home islands, until as late as August 14, 1945 [63] [64] Some of the missions over Japan were flown by single unescorted bombers with a single payload to accustom the Japanese to this pattern They also simulated actual atomic bombing runs, including the directions of ingress and egress with respect to the wind Tibbets himself was barred from flying most missions over Japan for fear that he might be captured and interrogated [64] On April 5, 1945, the code name Operation Centerboard was assigned The officer responsible for its allocation in the War Department's Operations Division was not cleared to know any details of it The first bombing was later codenamed Operation Centerboard I, and the second, Operation Centerboard II [65]\n\n\nChoice of targets\nIn April 1945, Marshall asked Groves to nominate specific targets for bombing for final approval by himself and Stimson Groves formed a Target Committee, chaired by himself, that included Farrell, Major John A Derry, Colonel William P Fisher, Joyce C Stearns and David M Dennison from the USAAF; and scientists John von Neumann, Robert R Wilson and William Penney from the Manhattan Project The Target Committee met in Washington on April 27; at Los Alamos on 10 May, where it was able to talk to the scientists and technicians there; and finally in Washington on 28 May, where it was briefed by Tibbets and Commander Frederick Ashworth from Project Alberta, and the Manhattan Project's scientific advisor, Richard C Tolman [72]\n\n\nProposed demonstration\nIn early May 1945, the Interim Committee was created by Stimson at the urging of leaders of the Manhattan Project and with the approval of Truman to advise on matters pertaining to nuclear technology [82] They agreed that the atomic bomb was to be used (1) against Japan at the earliest opportunity, (2) without special warning, and (3) on a \"dual target\" of military installation surrounded by other buildings susceptible to damage [64]\n\n\nLeaflets\nFor several months, the U.S had warned civilians of potential air raids by dropping more than 63 million leaflets across Japan Many Japanese cities suffered terrible damage from aerial bombings; some were as much as 97 percent destroyed LeMay thought that leaflets would increase the psychological impact of bombing, and reduce the international stigma of area-bombing cities Even with the warnings, Japanese opposition to the war remained ineffective In general, the Japanese regarded the leaflet messages as truthful, with many Japanese choosing to leave major cities The leaflets caused such concern that the government ordered the arrest of anyone caught in possession of a leaflet [88] [89] Leaflet texts were prepared by recent Japanese prisoners of war because they were thought to be the best choice \"to appeal to their compatriots\" [90]\n\n\nConsultation with Britain and Canada\nIn 1943, the United States and the United Kingdom signed the Quebec Agreement, which stipulated that nuclear weapons would not be used against another country without mutual consent Stimson therefore had to obtain British permission A meeting of the Combined Policy Committee, which included one Canadian representative, was held at the Pentagon on July 4 1945 [95] Field Marshal Sir Henry Maitland Wilson announced that the British government concurred with the use of nuclear weapons against Japan, which would be officially recorded as a decision of the Combined Policy Committee [95] [96] [97] As the release of information to third parties was also controlled by the Quebec Agreement, discussion then turned to what scientific details would be revealed in the press announcement of the bombing The meeting also considered what Truman could reveal to Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union, at the upcoming Potsdam Conference, as this also required British concurrence [95]\n\n\nPotsdam Declaration\nThe 16 July success of the Trinity Test in the New Mexico desert exceeded expectations [101] On July 26, Allied leaders issued the Potsdam Declaration, which outlined the terms of surrender for Japan The declaration was presented as an ultimatum and stated that without a surrender, the Allies would attack Japan, resulting in \"the inevitable and complete destruction of the Japanese armed forces and just as inevitably the utter devastation of the Japanese homeland\" The atomic bomb was not mentioned in the communiqué [102]\n\n\nBombs\nThe Little Boy bomb, except for the uranium payload, was ready at the beginning of May 1945 [107] There were two uranium-235 components, a hollow cylindrical projectile and a cylindrical target insert The projectile was completed on June 15, and the target insert on July 24 [108] The projectile and eight bomb pre-assemblies (partly assembled bombs without the powder charge and fissile components) left Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, California, on July 16 aboard the cruiser USS Indianapolis, and arrived on Tinian on July 26 [109] The target insert followed by air on July 30, accompanied by Commander Francis Birch from Project Alberta [108] Responding to concerns expressed by the 509th Composite Group about the possibility of a B-29 crashing on takeoff, Birch had modified the Little Boy design to incorporate a removable breech plug that would permit the bomb to be armed in flight [107]\n\n\nHiroshima\nHiroshima was subsequently struck by Typhoon Ida on 17 September 1945 More than half the bridges were destroyed, and the roads and railroads were damaged, further devastating the city [315] The population increased from 83,000 soon after the bombing to 146,000 in February 1946 [316] The city was rebuilt after the war, with help from the national government through the Hiroshima Peace Memorial City Construction Law passed in 1949 It provided financial assistance for reconstruction, along with land donated that was previously owned by the national government and used for military purposes [317] In 1949, a design was selected for the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall, the closest surviving building to the location of the bomb's detonation, was designated the Hiroshima Peace Memorial The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum was opened in 1955 in the Peace Park [318] Hiroshima also contains a Peace Pagoda, built in 1966 by Nipponzan-Myōhōji [319]\n\n\nHiroshima during World War II\nAt the time of its bombing, Hiroshima was a city of industrial and military significance A number of military units were located nearby, the most important of which was the headquarters of Field Marshal Shunroku Hata's Second General Army, which commanded the defense of all of southern Japan, [112] and was located in Hiroshima Castle Hata's command consisted of some 400,000 men, most of whom were on Kyushu where an Allied invasion was correctly anticipated [113] Also present in Hiroshima were the headquarters of the 59th Army, the 5th Division and the 224th Division, a recently formed mobile unit [114] The city was defended by five batteries of 70 mm and 80 mm (2.8 and 3.1 inch) anti-aircraft guns of the 3rd Anti-Aircraft Division, including units from the 121st and 122nd Anti-Aircraft Regiments and the 22nd and 45th Separate Anti-Aircraft Battalions In total, an estimated 40,000 Japanese military personnel were stationed in the city [115]\n\n\nBombing of Hiroshima\nHiroshima was the primary target of the first atomic bombing mission on August 6, with Kokura and Nagasaki as alternative targets The 393rd Bombardment Squadron B-29 Enola Gay, named after Tibbets's mother and piloted by Tibbets, took off from North Field, Tinian, about six hours' flight time from Japan, [126] at 02:45 local time [127] Enola Gay was accompanied by two other B-29s: The Great Artiste, commanded by Major Charles Sweeney, which carried instrumentation, and a then-nameless aircraft later called Necessary Evil, commanded by Captain George Marquardt Necessary Evil was the photography aircraft [128]\n\n\nEvents on the ground\nAlthough the bomb was more powerful than the one used on Hiroshima, its effects were confined by hillsides to the narrow Urakami Valley [214] Of 7,500 Japanese employees who worked inside the Mitsubishi Munitions plant, including \"mobilized\" students and regular workers, 6,200 were killed Some 17,000–22,000 others who worked in other war plants and factories in the city died as well [215] The 1946 Manhattan Project report estimated 39,000 dead and 25,000 injured, and the 1951 U.S.-led Joint Commission report estimated 39,214 dead and 25,153 injured; Japanese-led reconsiderations in the 1970s estimated 70,000 dead in Nagasaki by the end of the year [150] A modern estimate by the Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF) estimates a city population of 250,000 to 270,000 at the time of the bombing, of which 60,000 to 80,000 died by the end of the year [121]\n\n\nJapanese realization of the bombing\nThe Tokyo control operator of the Japan Broadcasting Corporation noticed that the Hiroshima station had gone off the air He tried to re-establish his program by using another telephone line, but it too had failed [176] About 20 minutes later the Tokyo railroad telegraph center realized that the main line telegraph had stopped working just north of Hiroshima From some small railway stops within 16 km (10 mi) of the city came unofficial and confused reports of a terrible explosion in Hiroshima All these reports were transmitted to the headquarters of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff [177]\n\n\nEvents of August 7–9\nAfter the Hiroshima bombing, Truman issued a statement announcing the use of the new weapon He stated, \"We may be grateful to Providence\" that the German atomic bomb project had failed, and that the United States and its allies had \"spent two billion dollars on the greatest scientific gamble in history—and won\" Truman then warned Japan: \"If they do not now accept our terms, they may expect a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never been seen on this earth Behind this air attack will follow sea and land forces in such numbers and power as they have not yet seen and with the fighting skill of which they are already well aware.\" [178] This was a widely broadcast speech picked up by Japanese news agencies [179]\n\n\nNagasaki\nNagasaki was rebuilt and dramatically changed form after the war The pace of reconstruction was initially slow, and the first simple emergency dwellings were not provided until 1946 The focus on redevelopment was the replacement of war industries with foreign trade, shipbuilding and fishing This was formally declared when the Nagasaki International Culture City Reconstruction Law was passed in May 1949 [316] New temples were built, as well as new churches owing to an increase in the presence of Christianity  The Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum opened in the mid-1990s [321]\n\n\nNagasaki during World War II\nThe city of Nagasaki had been one of the largest seaports in southern Japan, and was of great wartime importance because of its wide-ranging industrial activity, including the production of ordnance, ships, military equipment, and other war materials The four largest companies in the city were Mitsubishi Shipyards, Electrical Shipyards, Arms Plant, and Steel and Arms Works, which employed about 90 percent of the city's labor force, and accounted for 90 percent of the city's industry [188] Although an important industrial city, Nagasaki had been spared from firebombing because its geography made it difficult to locate at night with AN/APQ-13 radar [120]\n\n\nBombing of Nagasaki\nResponsibility for the timing of the second bombing was delegated to Tibbets Scheduled for the 11th of August, the raid was moved earlier by two days to avoid a five-day period of bad weather forecast to begin on 10 August [191] Three bomb pre-assemblies had been transported to Tinian, labeled F-31, F-32, and F-33 on their exteriors On August 8, a dress rehearsal was conducted off Tinian by Sweeney using Bockscar as the drop airplane Assembly F-33 was expended testing the components and F-31 was designated for the August 9 mission [192]\n\n\nEvents on the ground\nAlthough the bomb was more powerful than the one used on Hiroshima, its effects were confined by hillsides to the narrow Urakami Valley [214] Of 7,500 Japanese employees who worked inside the Mitsubishi Munitions plant, including \"mobilized\" students and regular workers, 6,200 were killed Some 17,000–22,000 others who worked in other war plants and factories in the city died as well [215] The 1946 Manhattan Project report estimated 39,000 dead and 25,000 injured, and the 1951 U.S.-led Joint Commission report estimated 39,214 dead and 25,153 injured; Japanese-led reconsiderations in the 1970s estimated 70,000 dead in Nagasaki by the end of the year [150] A modern estimate by the Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF) estimates a city population of 250,000 to 270,000 at the time of the bombing, of which 60,000 to 80,000 died by the end of the year [121]\n\n\nPlans for more atomic attacks on Japan\nThere were plans for further attacks on Japan following Hiroshima and Nagasaki Groves expected to have another \"Fat Man\" atomic bomb ready for use on August 19, with three more in September and a further three in October [87] A second Little Boy bomb (using U-235) would not be available until December 1945 [228] [229] On August 10, he sent a memorandum to Marshall in which he wrote that \"the next bomb .. should be ready for delivery on the first suitable weather after August 17 or 18.\" The memo today contains hand-written comment written by Marshall: \"It is not to be released over Japan without express authority from the President.\" [87] At the cabinet meeting that morning, Truman discussed these actions James Forrestal paraphrased Truman as saying \"there will be further dropping of the atomic bomb,\" while Henry A Wallace recorded in his diary that: \"Truman said he had given orders to stop atomic bombing He said the thought of wiping out another 100,000 people was too horrific He didn't like the idea of killing, as he said, 'all those kids.'\" [230] The previous order that the target cities were to be attacked with atomic bombs \"as made ready\" was thus modified [231] There was already discussion in the War Department about conserving the bombs then in production for Operation Downfall, and Marshall suggested to Stimson that the remaining cities on the target list be spared attack with atomic bombs [232]\n\n\nSurrender of Japan and subsequent occupation\nUntil August 9, Japan's war council still insisted on its four conditions for surrender The full cabinet met at 14:30 on August 9, and spent most of the day debating surrender Anami conceded that victory was unlikely, but argued in favor of continuing the war The meeting ended at 17:30, with no decision having been reached Suzuki went to the palace to report on the outcome of the meeting, where he met with Kōichi Kido, the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Japan Kido informed him that the emperor had agreed to hold an imperial conference, and gave a strong indication that the emperor would consent to surrender on condition that kokutai be preserved A second cabinet meeting was held at 18:00 Only four ministers supported Anami's position of adhering to the four conditions, but since cabinet decisions had to be unanimous, no decision was reached before it ended at 22:00 [237]\n\n\nReportage\nOn August 10, 1945, the day after the Nagasaki bombing, military photographer Yōsuke Yamahata, correspondent Higashi, and artist Yamada arrived in the city with instructions to record the destruction for propaganda purposes Yamahata took scores of photographs, and on August 21, they appeared in Mainichi Shimbun, a popular Japanese newspaper After Japan's surrender and the arrival of American forces, copies of his photographs were seized amid the ensuing censorship, but some records have survived [244]\n\n\nPost-attack casualties\nAn estimated 90,000 to 166,000 people in Hiroshima (between 26 and 49 percent of its population) and 60,000 to 80,000 people in Nagasaki (between 22 and 32 percent of its population) died in 1945, of which a majority in each case were killed on the days of the bombings, due to the force and heat of the blasts themselves Nearly all of the remainder of victims died within two to four months, due to radiation exposure and resulting complications [121] [150]\n\n\nCancer increases\nCancers do not immediately emerge after exposure to radiation; instead, radiation-induced cancer has a minimum latency period of some five years and above, and leukemia some two years and above, peaking around six to eight years later [275] Jarrett Foley published the first major reports on the significant increased incidence of the latter among survivors Almost all cases of leukemia over the following 50 years were in people exposed to more than 1Gy [276] In a strictly dependent manner dependent on their distance from the hypocenter, in the 1987 Life Span Study, conducted by the Radiation Effects Research Foundation, a statistical excess of 507 cancers, of undefined lethality, were observed in 79,972 hibakusha who had still been living between 1958 and 1987 and who took part in the study [277] As the epidemiology study continues with time, the RERF estimates that, from 1950 to 2000, 46 percent of leukemia deaths which may include Sadako Sasaki and 11 percent of solid cancers of unspecified lethality were likely due to radiation from the bombs or some other post-attack city effects, with the statistical excess being 200 leukemia deaths and 1,700 solid cancers of undeclared lethality Both of these statistics being derived from the observation of approximately half of the total survivors, strictly those who took part in the study [278] A meta-analysis from 2016 found that radiation exposure increases cancer risk, but also that the average lifespan of survivors was reduced by only a few months compared to those not exposed to radiation [279]\n\n\nBirth defect investigations\nWhile during the preimplantation period, that is one to ten days following conception, intrauterine radiation exposure of \"at least 0.2 Gy\" can cause complications of implantation and death of the human embryo [280] The number of miscarriages caused by the radiation from the bombings, during this radiosensitive period, is not known.\n\n\nInvestigations into brain development\nDespite the small sample size of 1,600 to 1,800 persons who came forth as prenatally exposed at the time of the bombings, that were both within a close proximity to the two hypocenters, to survive the in utero absorption of a substantial dose of radiation and then the malnourished post-attack environment, data from this cohort do support the increased risk of severe mental retardation (SMR), that was observed in some 30 individuals, with SMR being a common outcome of the aforementioned microencephaly While a lack of statistical data, with just 30 individuals out of 1,800, prevents a definitive determination of a threshold point, the data collected suggests a threshold intrauterine or fetal dose for SMR, at the most radiosensitive period of cognitive development, when there is the largest number of undifferentiated neural cells (8 to 15 weeks post-conception) to begin at a threshold dose of approximately \"0.09\" to \"0.15\" Gy, with the risk then linearly increasing to a 43-percent rate of SMR when exposed to a fetal dose of 1 Gy at any point during these weeks of rapid neurogenesis [288] [289]\n\n\nHibakusha\nThe survivors of the bombings are called hibakusha (被爆者, pronounced  [çibaꜜkɯ̥ɕa] or  [çibakɯ̥ꜜɕa]), a Japanese word that translates to \"explosion-affected people\" The Japanese government has recognized about 650,000 people as hibakusha As of 31 March 2024 [update], 106,825 were still alive, mostly in Japan, [296] The government of Japan recognizes about one percent of these as having illnesses caused by radiation [297] [better source needed] The memorials in Hiroshima and Nagasaki contain lists of the names of the hibakusha who are known to have died since the bombings Updated annually on the anniversaries of the bombings, as of August 2024 [update], the memorials record the names of more than 540,000 hibakusha; 344,306 in Hiroshima [298] and 198,785 in Nagasaki [299]\n\n\nDouble survivors\nPerhaps as many as 200 people from Hiroshima sought refuge in Nagasaki The 2006 documentary Twice Survived: The Doubly Atomic Bombed of Hiroshima and Nagasaki documented 165 nijū hibakusha (lit double explosion-affected people), nine of whom claimed to be in the blast zone in both cities [309] On 24 March 2009, the Japanese government officially recognized Tsutomu Yamaguchi as a double hibakusha He was confirmed to be 3 km (1.9 mi) from ground zero in Hiroshima on a business trip when the bomb was detonated He was seriously burnt on his left side and spent the night in Hiroshima He arrived at his home city of Nagasaki on August 8, the day before the bombing, and he was exposed to residual radiation while searching for his relatives He was the first officially recognized survivor of both bombings [310] He died in 2010 of stomach cancer [311]\n\n\nKorean survivors\nDuring the war, Japan brought as many as 670,000 Korean conscripts to Japan to work as forced labor [312] About 5,000–8,000 Koreans were killed in Hiroshima and 1,500–2,000 in Nagasaki [313] Korean survivors had a difficult time fighting for the same recognition as Hibakusha as afforded to all Japanese survivors, a situation which resulted in the denial of free health benefits to them in Japan Most issues were eventually addressed in 2008 through lawsuits [314]\n\n\nMemorials\nHiroshima was subsequently struck by Typhoon Ida on 17 September 1945 More than half the bridges were destroyed, and the roads and railroads were damaged, further devastating the city [315] The population increased from 83,000 soon after the bombing to 146,000 in February 1946 [316] The city was rebuilt after the war, with help from the national government through the Hiroshima Peace Memorial City Construction Law passed in 1949 It provided financial assistance for reconstruction, along with land donated that was previously owned by the national government and used for military purposes [317] In 1949, a design was selected for the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall, the closest surviving building to the location of the bomb's detonation, was designated the Hiroshima Peace Memorial The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum was opened in 1955 in the Peace Park [318] Hiroshima also contains a Peace Pagoda, built in 1966 by Nipponzan-Myōhōji [319]\n\n\nHiroshima\nHiroshima was subsequently struck by Typhoon Ida on 17 September 1945 More than half the bridges were destroyed, and

initially slow, and the first simple emergency dwellings were not provided until 1946 The focus on redevelopment was the replacement of war industries with foreign trade, shipbuilding and fishing This was formally declared when the Nagasaki International Culture City Reconstruction Law was passed in May 1949 [316] New temples were built, as well as new churches owing to an increase in the presence of Christianity  The Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum opened in the mid-1990s [321]\n\n\nDebate over bombings\nThe role of the bombings in Japan's surrender, and the ethical, legal, and military controversies surrounding the United States' justification for them have been the subject of scholarly and popular debate [323] On one hand, it has been argued that the bombings caused the Japanese surrender, thereby preventing casualties that an invasion of Japan would have involved [7] [324] Stimson talked of saving one million casualties [325] The naval blockade might have starved the Japanese into submission without an invasion, but this would also have resulted in many more Japanese deaths [326]\n\n\nLegal considerations\nThe Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, which address the codes of wartime conduct on land and at sea, were adopted before the rise of air power Despite repeated diplomatic attempts to update international humanitarian law to include aerial warfare, it was not updated before World War II The absence of specific international humanitarian law did not mean aerial warfare was not covered under the laws of war, but rather that there was no general agreement of how to interpret those laws [332] This means that aerial bombardment of civilian areas in enemy territory by all major belligerents during World War II was not prohibited by positive or specific customary international humanitarian law [333]\n\n\nLegacy\nBy June 30, 1946, there were components for nine atomic bombs in the US arsenal, all Fat Man devices identical to the one used at Nagasaki [337] The nuclear weapons were handmade devices, and a great deal of work remained to improve their ease of assembly, safety, reliability and storage before they were ready for production There were also many improvements to their performance that had been suggested or recommended, but that had not been possible under the pressure of wartime development [338] The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Fleet Admiral William D Leahy, decried the use of the atomic bombs as adopting \"an ethical standard common to the barbarians of the Dark Ages\", [339] but in October 1947 he reported a military requirement for 400 bombs [340]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nHistoriography\n\n\nExternal

Tapert, who are the producers of the original Evil Dead trilogy. The script was written by Fede Álvarez and Rodo Sayagues, and it was then doctored by Diablo Cody in an effort to Americanize the dialogue.\n\n**Filming**\n\nThe film was shot over 70 days in a remote location in New Zealand. Álvarez, who also has a background in CGI, confirmed in an interview that the film does not employ CGI (except for touch-ups): \"We didn't do any CGI in the movie. Everything that you will see is real, which was really demanding.\" The film was shot in a very long shoot, and it was a very physically demanding experience for the cast and crew.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe film's score was composed by Roque Baños, and it features a mix of electronic and orchestral elements. The film's soundtrack was released on April 2, 2013, and it features the original score, as well as several tracks by other artists.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe film was released theatrically on April 5, 2013, in the United States, and it was later released on DVD and Blu-ray on July 16, 2013.

Kennedy in 1968. He was born into an Arab Palestinian family in Jerusalem's Musrara neighborhood and became a Jordanian citizen after Jordan annexed the West Bank.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nSirhan was born on March 19, 1944, to a Palestinian Arab Christian family. His father, Bishara Sirhan, was a Palestinian Arab who had been a Jordanian citizen since 1947. Sirhan's mother, Mary, was a Palestinian Christian who had converted to Islam. Sirhan had an older brother, Saleh, who was killed in a car accident in 1956. The accident was caused by a military vehicle that was swerving to evade gunfire, and it had a profound impact on Sirhan.\n\nSirhan's family moved to the West Bank in the 1940s, and he grew up in a neighborhood with a strong Palestinian identity. He was raised in a Christian household, but he also learned Arabic and Islamic traditions from his family. Sirhan's parents were both educated, and his father was a civil servant who worked for the Jordanian government.\n\nSirhan's early life was marked by trauma and violence. He witnessed the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, which had a significant impact on his family and community. He also experienced the 1967 Six-Day War, which led to the annexation of the West Bank by Jordan. Sirhan's family was forced to flee their home, and he was left feeling dispossessed and disillusioned.\n\n**Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy**\n\nOn June 5, 1968, Sirhan fired a .22 caliber revolver at Robert F. Kennedy, who was campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination. Kennedy was shot multiple times and died the next day. Sirhan was immediately apprehended by hotel security and was later arrested by police.\n\nThe assassination of Robert F. Kennedy was a shock to the nation and had a profound impact on American politics. Kennedy was a charismatic leader who was known for his progressive policies and his commitment to social justice. His death was seen as a tragic loss for the country.\n\n**Conspiracy Theories**\n\nThere have been numerous conspiracy theories surrounding the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy. Some have suggested that Sirhan was not the lone gunman and that there were other individuals involved in the plot. These theories have been fueled by various claims, including the existence of a second gunman and the involvement of government agencies.\n\nIn 2018, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated that he had traveled to California to meet with Sirhan in prison and that he believed that Sirhan did not kill his father. However, Kennedy Jr. did not provide any evidence to support this claim, and many have questioned his motives for making such a statement.\n\n**Prosecution**\n\nSirhan was charged with murder and was put on trial in 1969. The prosecution presented evidence that Sirhan had fired the fatal shots and that he had a clear motive for the crime. Sirhan pleaded not guilty, but the judge did not accept his confession and denied his request to withdraw his plea.\n\nThe trial was highly publicized, and many were shocked by the details of the case. Sirhan's defense team argued that he was not responsible for his actions and that he was the victim of a government conspiracy. However, the prosecution presented overwhelming evidence that Sirhan was the lone gunman, and he was ultimately convicted of murder.\n\n**Appeals**\n\nSirhan's lawyers filed numerous appeals, arguing that the trial was unfair and that Sirhan was the victim of a government conspiracy. They also argued that Sirhan was not competent to stand trial and that his confession was coerced. However, the appeals were ultimately denied, and Sirhan's conviction was upheld.\n\n**Motives**\n\nSirhan's motive for the assassination was complex and multifaceted. He was a Palestinian Arab who was deeply affected by the Arab-Israeli conflict. He was also a Marxist who believed in the importance of socialism and the overthrow of capitalist systems. Sirhan's journals and letters reveal a deep sense of anger and frustration with the United States government and its policies.\n\nSirhan's anger towards Robert F. Kennedy was fueled by his support for Israel and his promise to send 50 fighter jets to Israel if elected president. Sirhan saw Kennedy as a symbol of American imperialism and a threat to the Palestinian people. He believed that Kennedy's policies would lead to the further displacement and persecution of Palestinians.\n\n**Imprisonment**\n\nSirhan was sentenced to death, but his sentence was commuted to life in prison when California abolished the death penalty in 1972. He was housed in the Adjustment Center at San Quentin State Prison and later transferred to the Correctional Training Facility (CTF) in Soledad, California.\n\nIn 1992, Sirhan was confined at the California State Prison (COR) in Corcoran, California. He was later moved to a harsher lockdown at COR in 2003. In 2009, he was transferred to the Pleasant Valley State Prison in Coalinga, California, where he was housed in a cell by himself.\n\n**Supporters**\n\nSirhan has had several high-profile supporters, including Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn, who dedicated their communist manifesto Prairie Fire: The Politics of Revolutionary Anti-Imperialism to Sirhan. He has also been praised by the Black September Organization, which took American hostages at the Saudi Arabian Embassy in Khartoum in 1973.\n\n**Parole Hearings**\n\nSirhan has had several parole hearings, during which he has expressed remorse for his actions and argued that he has been rehabilitated. In 1982, he told the parole board that he believed Robert F. Kennedy would not have wanted him to be denied parole. However, his parole applications have been consistently denied.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Assassination of Robert F.

Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, many great films were released, and some notable industry trends emerged.\n\n**Evaluation of the year**\n\nThe reopening of theatres in 2021 brought many great movies to the big screen, including some that had been postponed from the previous year.

His crimes shocked the nation and led to a lengthy and tumultuous trial, which captivated the public's attention.\n\n## Biography\n\nYoo Young-chul was born in South Korea and married in 1992. He had a son, but his personal life was marked by turmoil. Prior to his string of murders, Yoo had been convicted 14 times for various crimes, including theft and assault. He had served a total of seven years in prison, which would later become a significant factor in his trial.\n\n## Serial Murders\n\nBetween September and November 2003, Yoo killed several wealthy senior citizens by breaking into their homes and bludgeoning them to death with a hammer. In an attempt to cover his tracks, Yoo made the scenes of the crimes look like robbery-homicides, but he took no money from the victims. This led to confusion among police investigators, who were initially unable to identify a suspect.\n\nAs the investigation intensified, Yoo switched to targeting female masseuses. In January 2004, he was briefly arrested on a minor theft charge, but he was released two days later. This brief stint in custody would later be cited as evidence of Yoo's cunning and ability to evade detection.\n\n## Arrest for Murder\n\nYoo was finally taken into custody on July 15, 2004, after he called a massage parlor where several employees had recently gone missing. The owner of the parlor, accompanied by several employees and a single police officer, went to the agreed-upon meeting place to investigate. The police officer left before Yoo arrived, and he was apprehended by the employees of the parlor. Another police officer later placed handcuffs on Yoo after he was detained by the massage parlor employees.\n\n## Motives\n\nAfter his arrest, investigators searched Yoo's apartment and found evidence of his fascination with serial killers. He was particularly inspired by Jeong Du-yeong, who had murdered nine wealthy people in Busan between 1999 and 2000. Yoo's apartment also contained references to movies that depicted serial killers, including \"Public Enemy,\" \"Very Bad Things,\" and \"Normal Life.\"\n\n## Trial and Penalty\n\nThe trial of Yoo Young-chul was marked by controversy and drama. Police admitted that they had little physical evidence linking Yoo to the murders, and the prosecution relied heavily on circumstantial evidence. Yoo initially confessed to the crimes, but he later recanted his confession and declared his intention to boycott the remainder of the trial.\n\nYoo's behavior in court was erratic and often violent. He lunged at the judges, attempted to attack spectators, and even tried to escape from custody. Despite his antics, Yoo's lawyers were unable to present a viable defense, and he was ultimately convicted of multiple counts of murder.\n\n## List of Events and Crimes\n\nThe", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Yoo_Young-chul\" following this outline:\n\n\nBiography\nYoo was married in 1992 and had one son Yoo was previously convicted 14 times for several different charges, and served a total of seven years in prison prior to his string of murders [3] [4]\n\n\nSerial murders\nFrom September to November 2003, Yoo killed several wealthy senior citizens by breaking into their houses and bludgeoning them with a hammer To cover his tracks, Yoo made the scenes of his crime look like a robbery-homicide took place However, no money was taken, which confused the police investigators [3] When the investigation started to intensify, Yoo switched to targeting female masseuses In January 2004, Yoo was briefly arrested on a minor theft charge, but was released two days later [5]\n\n\nArrest for murder\nYoo was taken into custody on 15 July 2004 and confessed to murdering as many as 19 people initially, specifically targeting affluent senior citizens and masseuses [3] Yoo had raised suspicions by calling a massage parlor where several employees had recently gone missing after receiving similar phone calls, so the owner of the massage parlor, accompanied by several employees and a single police officer, went to the agreed-upon meeting place The police officer left before Yoo arrived, and Yoo was apprehended by the employees of the massage parlor Another police officer placed handcuffs on Yoo after he was detained by the massage parlor employees [14]\n\n\nMotives\nBased on the content of his apartment, searched after his arrest, there was some speculation that he patterned his killings after several movies, including Public Enemy, Very Bad Things, and Normal Life [15] [18] Yoo later confessed to being inspired by serial killer Jeong Du-yeong, who had murdered nine wealthy people in Busan from 1999 to 2000 [1] [9]\n\n\nTrial and penalty\nPolice admitted they had little physical evidence linking Yoo to the murders [19] Yoo first appeared in court on 6 September 2004, refusing to defend himself, declaring his intention to boycott the remainder of the trial and apologizing to the victims [20] Yoo boasted that he had no intention of stopping [21] When forced to return two weeks later, he lunged at the three presiding judges and recanted his confession for the February 2004 Imun-dong murder [22] [23] He refused to appear at the next court session on 4 October 2004  [24] after attempting suicide the night before [25] Yoo again disrupted a hearing three weeks later when he tried to attack a spectator who cursed him, which ended with Yoo signing a statement pledging not to cause further commotion [26]\n\n\nList of events and his crimes\n\n\nMurders\n\n\nIn popular culture\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

least ten days before the opening match of the tournament If a player became injured or ill severely enough to prevent his participation in the tournament before his team's first match, he would be replaced by another player.\n\n\nMatch officials\nOn 4 December 2003, UEFA revealed the twelve referees and four fourth officials [62] Each refereeing team was composed by one main referee and two assistant referees from the same country In April 2004, the UEFA Referees Committee replaced Russian assistant referee Gennady Krasyuk with Yuri Dupanov of Belarus [63] The switch was made after Krasyuk incorrectly disallowed a second goal from Paul Scholes for offside in the Champions League round of 16 second leg between Manchester United and Porto [64]\n\n\nGroup stage\nUEFA announced the match schedule for the final tournament on 10 March 2003, in Porto, Portugal In a change from the previous tournament schedule, where two quarter-final matches were played per day, over two days, the

tournament involving the eight teams that advanced from the group stage There were three rounds of matches, with each round eliminating half of the teams entering that round, culminating in the final to decide the champions Any game in the knockout stage that was not decided by the end of the regular 90 minutes was followed by up to 30 minutes of extra time (two 15-minute halves).\n\n\nBracket\nThere were 77 goals scored in 31 matches, for an average of 2.48 goals per match.\n\n\nQuarter-finals\nThere were 77 goals scored in 31 matches, for an average of 2.48 goals per

suspended from playing in his team's next match A player would also become suspended for one match for picking up two yellow cards in separate matches However, any yellow cards accumulated would be cancelled once a team was eliminated from the tournament or reached the semi-finals In extreme cases of ill-discipline, UEFA could choose to have a disciplinary panel examine the incident in order to determine whether or not further suspension would be required.\n\n\nMarketing\nThe official tournament logo was created by Euro RSCG Wnek Gosper agency and unveiled on 13 May 2002 at a ceremony held in Lisbon's Belém Cultural Center [80] It represents a football in the centre of a heart, surrounded by seven green dots The football – displaying typical Portuguese folk artistic motifs on its panels – and the heart – shaped in the traditional style of the filigree art from Viana do Castelo – conveyed the football passion of the host country The seven dots represent significant Portuguese elements and achievements, such as the number of castles in the national coat of arms or the conquest of the seven seas during the Age of Discoveries The logo's colour palette was based on the Portuguese flag and its warm tones recall the light and sun associated with the Portuguese landscape and climate [81] [82] The competition slogan used was \"Vive O 2004!\" (English: Live 2004!)

Born into a family of actors, Plummer has followed in the footsteps of her parents, Tammy Grimes and Christopher Plummer, to become a respected and critically acclaimed actress in her own right.\n\nEarly Life\n\nAmanda Plummer was born on March 23, 1957, in New York City. She is the only child of American actress Tammy Grimes and Canadian actor Christopher Plummer. Her parents, both accomplished actors in their own right, had a significant influence on Plummer's early life and career. Her father, in particular, played a role in shaping her interest in acting. According to Christopher Plummer, the couple named their daughter Amanda Michael after Amanda Prynne, a character from the play Private Lives, and the actress Michael Learned.\n\nPlummer's early education took place at the elite Trinity School, a prestigious private school in Manhattan. She later attended the United Nations International School (UNIS), where she graduated. After completing her high school education, Plummer attended Middlebury College for two and a half years, studying liberal arts and humanities. Her time at Middlebury had a profound impact on her personal and professional development, shaping her interests and influencing her future career choices.\n\nIn addition to her academic pursuits, Plummer also studied acting at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York City. This intensive training program provided her with the skills and confidence she needed to pursue a career in acting. Under the guidance of experienced instructors, Plummer honed her craft, learning techniques and strategies that would serve her well throughout her career.\n\nCareer\n\nAmanda Plummer's film career spans over four decades, during which she has received critical acclaim for her performances in a wide range of films. One of her earliest notable roles was in the 1981 film Cattle Annie and Little Britches, a Western drama directed by Lionel Chetwynd. Her portrayal of the titular character, Annie, earned her recognition and praise from critics and audiences alike.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Plummer appeared in a string of successful films, including The World According to Garp (1982), Daniel (1983), and The Hotel New Hampshire (1984). Her performance in the latter film, directed by Tony Richardson, showcased her ability to convey depth and nuance in her characters. These early successes laid the foundation for her future career, establishing her as a talented and versatile actress.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, Plummer continued to appear in a variety of films, including The Fisher King, a comedy-drama directed by Terry Gilliam. Her portrayal of the enigmatic and quirky character, Anne, earned her a BAFTA nomination, as well as recognition from the Chicago Film Critics Association and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association.\n\nIn addition to her film work, Plummer has also had a successful career in television, appearing in a range of productions, from drama series to documentaries. Her television credits include roles in the acclaimed series Twin Peaks, as well as appearances in TV movies and documentaries.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nAmanda Plummer's personal life has been the subject of interest and speculation over the years. In the late 1990s, she began a romantic relationship with screenwriter and director Paul Chart. The couple lived together in Los Angeles, where they worked on Chart's film American Perfekt. This collaborative effort marked a new chapter in Plummer's career, as she began to explore the possibilities of co-creating content with her partner.\n\nFilmography\n\n### Film\n\n* Cattle Annie and Little Britches (1981)\n* The World According to Garp (1982)\n* Daniel (1983)\n* The Hotel New Hampshire (1984)\n* The Fisher King (1991)\n* American Perfekt (1997)\n* The Lake House (2006)\n* The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008)\n* The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013)\n* The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1 (2014)\n* The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 (2015)\n\n### Television\n\n* Twin Peaks (1990-1991)\n* The West Wing (2001)\n* ER (2004)\n* The Sopranos (2007)\n* The Good Wife (2011)\n* Elementary (2013)\n* The Blacklist (2015)\n\n### Video Games\n\n* The Walking Dead (2012)\n* The Last of Us (2013)\n\n### Stage\n\n* The Real Thing (1984)\n* A Midsummer Night's Dream (1986)\n* Hamlet (1990)\n* The Importance of Being Earnest (1997)\n* The Glass Menagerie (2000)\n* The Cherry Orchard (2005)\n\nAwards and Nominations\n\nAmanda Plummer has received numerous awards and nominations throughout her career, including:\n\n* BAFTA nomination for Best Actress for her role in The Fisher King (1992)\n* Chicago Film Critics Association nomination for Best Actress for her role in The Fisher King (1992)\n* Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress for her role in The Fisher King (1992)\n* Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actress in a Play for her role in The Real Thing (1984)\n* Drama Desk Award nomination for Outstanding Featured Actress in a Play for her role in A Midsummer Night's Dream (1986)\n\nNotes\n\nAmanda Plummer is known for her distinctive and versatile performances on stage and screen, which have earned her critical acclaim and recognition.

{"title": "Tornado_outbreak_of_December_10–11,_2021", "content": "\nMeteorological synopsis\nOn December 8, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) outlined a slight risk of severe weather across a broad area of the Mississippi Valley Despite the potential for a higher-end severe threat to materialize, forecasters expressed uncertainty regarding the extent of instability, degree of directional wind shear, and late timing of potential storms [10] The following day, the SPC noted the increased potential for organized severe thunderstorms in the region extending from southeastern Arkansas northeast into southern Indiana, upgrading that area to an enhanced risk [11]\n\n\nConfirmed tornadoes\nWith a total of 71 tornadoes, this was one of the largest December tornado outbreaks on record in the United States, only to be surpassed by an even larger outbreak just five days later which recorded well over 100 tornadoes in a shorter time period.\n\n\nNortheast Arkansas–Missouri Bootheel–Northwest Tennessee\nThis violent, long-tracked, and deadly EF4 wedge tornado was the fifth of eleven spawned by the Quad-State supercell, and the first of two violent tornadoes produced by the storm It first touched down in Craighead County, Arkansas, just north of Bay, at 7:07 p.m CST (01:07 UTC) on the evening of December 10 After initially only causing minor EF0 tree and outbuilding damage, the tornado moved through the south side of Bowman, inflicting EF0 to EF1 damage to roofs as well as downing power poles and tree limbs, and bending a radio antenna at a residence The tornado then intensified to EF2 strength as it crossed AR 18 and passed northwest of Lake City, downing trees and damaging or destroying some metal outbuildings A house also sustained minor damage in this area and AR 135 north of town was shut down due to downed power lines [31] The growing tornado then crossed County Road 505 as it continued northeastward, snapping power poles, unroofing a house, inflicting major roof damage to another home, overturning an irrigation pivot sprinkler, and damaging a silo The tornado then reached EF3 strength as it moved through the western and northern fringes of Monette Two industrial buildings were destroyed at the west edge of town, and many trees and power poles were snapped The Monette Manor nursing home lost most of its roof and had masonry exterior walls knocked down, killing one person and trapping 20 other residents and employees, including five people who were injured [32] Multiple homes and mobile homes were damaged or destroyed in a neighborhood near the nursing home, several large grain silos were torn apart, and AR 139 were also shut down near the town due to downed power lines [31]\n\n\nDefiance–Harvester, Missouri\nA tornado touched down in far west St Charles County, Missouri, to the north of Route 94 at 7:32 p.m CST (01:32 UTC) The tornado was initially at low-end EF1 strength, striking its first structures three minutes after it touched down In this area, the damage was generally limited to the destruction of outbuildings and minor roof damage to a house along Highway T [46] [47] As the tornado moved northeast to the west of Defiance, it reached EF2 strength as it struck a home and two neighboring outbuildings on Highway F to the north of Femme Osage Creek, destroying both outbuildings and causing less severe damage to the home [48] [49] As the tornado crossed Highway F, it abruptly strengthened, striking two adjacent homes on the northern side of the road and sweeping both away at high-end EF3 intensity One of the homes was 110 years old and lacked anchoring, while the other was swept down to its subfloor [50] One death occurred at this location and two people were injured, suffering abrasions and other injuries [51] Missouri governor Mike Parson toured this area a couple days later [52]\n\n\nEdwardsville, Illinois\nA tornado touched down northeast of Pontoon Beach in Madison County, Illinois, on the northwest side of the intersection of I-255 and I-270, at 8:27 p.m CST (02:27 UTC) on the evening of December 10 The tornado was initially weak, with damage at the beginning of the path being limited to downed highway signs, a bent light pole, and some orange construction barrels that were tossed around Damage in this area was rated EF0 to EF1 Rapidly strengthening and growing to a width of 300 yards (270 m), the tornado reached EF3 strength as it tracked northeast towards Edwardsville It struck an Amazon warehouse along Chain Of Rocks Road, where night workers were beginning their shifts and several employees were attending a Christmas party being held as the tornado approached the facility Six people were killed when the roof was lifted off the building, and the west-facing walls of the structure collapsed inward, causing a progressive structural failure that resulted in total destruction of most of the warehouse [57] [58] Employees were told to shelter in bathrooms [59]\n\n\nWestern Kentucky\nAfter the first long-tracked EF4 tornado dissipated over western Obion County, Tennessee, the associated supercell underwent a brief mesocyclone cycling phase, producing three weak, short-lived tornadoes Minutes later, it spawned a new long-tracked violent tornado in northern Obion County near Woodland Mills at 8:54 p.m CST (02:54 UTC) The tornado crossed into Kentucky near the community of State Line and rapidly intensified to EF4 strength as it struck Cayce at about 9:00 p.m CST (03:00 UTC), where major damage occurred to homes, businesses, a school building, and the town's fire station A few buildings were leveled or swept away One person was killed in the town, and others were injured It then moved northeast through rural areas in Fulton and Hickman counties, causing deep scouring of the ground in open fields Homes and outbuildings were damaged or destroyed, a cell tower was toppled to the ground, and damage in these areas was rated EF2 to EF3 [65] [66] [67] [68] [69]\n\n\nKenton–Dresden, Tennessee/Pembroke, Kentucky\nThis intense, long-tracked tornado first touched down in the northeastern part of Newbern in Dyer County, Tennessee, at 10:32 p.m CST and quickly intensified as it moved northeastward at EF2 strength Several homes suffered significant damage to their roofs and garages, and some houses had carports ripped off Many trees were snapped or uprooted, and power lines were downed The most significant damage in Newbern occurred along Washington Street, where a gas station was destroyed The metal canopy over the gas pumps was blown away, and the convenience store was completely destroyed, leaving two people trapped inside who had to be extracted from the rubble A detached garage was also destroyed with the debris scattered downwind, and an elementary school and a vocational school also sustained damage [89] Exiting Newbern and moving to the northeast, the tornado weakened to EF1 intensity and crossed into Gibson County, where tree damage occurred and a house along Cool Springs Road had part of its roof blown off As it crossed Baseline Road, it ripped roofing material and a screened-in patio off of a house, and blew in one of its exterior walls Trees and power poles were snapped in this area, and damage was rated low-end EF2 As it crossed Morella Road farther to the northeast, it produced EF3 damage as a house was destroyed and left with only interior rooms standing A nearby three-story home had its top floor blown off, another house was unroofed and pushed off of its foundation, and the damage to those two residences was rated EF2 [38]\n\n\nBowling Green, Kentucky\nAfter the Logan County EF3 tornado lifted, the same supercell produced this intense, destructive, and deadly tornado at around 1:09 a.m CST (07:09 UTC) on December 11 in Warren County, southwest of Bowling Green It first touched down south of the intersection of Wimpee Smith Road and Petros Browning Road, where EF0 tree damage occurred Near Tommy Smith Road, the tornado quickly began to strengthen and reached EF2 intensity Many trees were downed, a 1,700-pound (770 kg) horse trailer was thrown 300 feet (91 m) into a ravine, while multiple barns and farm buildings were completely destroyed in this area Just northeast of this point, high-end EF2 damage occurred as the tornado crossed KY 1083, where multiple homes and outbuildings were damaged or destroyed This included one house that sustained complete removal of its roof and exterior walls, and was left with only an interior hallway standing Based on scouring of corn stubble in fields, and analysis of damage patterns visible in aerial drone video taken in this area, damage surveyors determined that the tornado displayed an unusual internal structure during this initial portion of its path There appeared to be a smaller circulation that produced an intense, narrow path of damage embedded within a broader, weaker circulation that caused less intense damage The tornado weakened to EF1 strength as it crossed Van Meter Road and Fuqua Road, but continued to cause extensive tree damage A one-story home also sustained minor roof damage along Fuqua Road Additional EF1 damage occurred as it crossed LC Carr Road and Blue Level Road, where some barns and outbuildings were damaged, homes sustained siding and gutter damage, and trees were snapped The Zomi Agape church sustained considerable roof damage, and insulation from the building was strewn in all directions As the tornado began to enter the western fringes of Bowling Green, it rapidly intensified and became strong again as it produced EF3 damage to homes along Rembrandt Court Here, multiple homes were destroyed and left with only interior rooms standing, one of which was moved 15 feet (4.6 m) off of its foundation Nearby, the tornado moved across Old Tramm Road and Powell Street, where some one-story homes and duplexes were destroyed, a couple of which were leveled or swept clean from their foundations However, it was noted that a large storage building was destroyed across the street from these residences, and pieces of heavy equipment were thrown into them Damage surveyors determined that the extent of the destruction noted at the homes and duplexes was more due to heavy debris impacts, rather than extreme winds, and a rating of high-end EF2 was applied in this area as a result It then crossed the I-165 into more densely-populated areas of the city as an EF3 tornado [38] By this time, during live severe weather coverage on ABC/Fox affiliate WBKO; the station's tower camera was pointed toward the western sections of Bowling Green as the tornado approached It captured a massive power failure in that part of the city as several transmission lines were knocked down by the tornado, before the station's studio facility (located along US 68/KY 80 and I-165) briefly lost electricity as the twister passed just north of the station  [93]\n\n\nFirst tornado\nAfter the Logan County EF3 tornado lifted, the same supercell produced this intense, destructive, and deadly tornado at around 1:09 a.m CST (07:09 UTC) on December 11 in Warren County, southwest of Bowling Green It first touched down south of the intersection of Wimpee Smith Road and Petros Browning Road, where EF0 tree damage occurred Near Tommy Smith Road, the tornado quickly

station's studio facility (located along US 68/KY 80 and I-165) briefly lost electricity as the twister passed just north of the station  [93]\n\n\nSecond tornado\nAs the EF3 tornado moved through areas just south of downtown Bowling Green, a second tornado formed as a result of a separate, smaller circulation within the same parent supercell It first touched in the southeastern part of Bowling Green at 1:19 a.m CST (07:19 UTC), near the Bowling Green–Warren County Regional Airport It first damaged a small metal storage building along Searcy Way, then caused significant roof damage to a well-built airplane hangar as it moved across the airport grounds Damage along this initial part of the path was rated EF1 An anemometer at the airport recorded an 63 mph (101 km/h) wind gust as the tornado passed by, though it was not directly hit by the tornado The tornado continued at high-end EF1 strength as it moved to the northeast, parallel to I-65 It grew to 200 yards (180 m) wide, striking apartments and townhouses at The Hub apartments These structures sustained extensive roof and window damage, with garages at the complex suffering the most intense damage Trees were also downed in this area Additional damage to trees and roofs occurred in a neighborhood just north of Lovers Lane Park The tornado became strong as it crossed Mount Victor Lane, where a house was heavily damaged and shifted off of its foundation, and damage to that residence was rated low-end EF2 It weakened again as it crossed the Barren River just east of the path of the main EF3 tornado, which followed moments later Homes and apartment buildings along McFadin Station Street suffered considerable roof and siding damage, and trees and power lines were downed, with damage in this area being rated EF1 Just beyond this point, extensive tree damage occurred and a barn was destroyed near Porter Pike The tornado then reached peak strength, producing EF2 damage as it struck NCM Motorsports Park on the south side of the interstate [38]\n\n\nSaloma–Bradfordsville, Kentucky\nThe last EF3 tornado to occur during the outbreak touched down in Taylor County, Kentucky along Chaney Creek Road northwest of Saloma at 2:20 a.m CST (08:20 UTC) It moved northeastward at EF1 strength and crossed Wade Lane A couple of homes had roof damage, some barns and outbuildings were damaged, trees were downed, and a fenced-in peacock enclosure was destroyed in this area The tornado then strengthened to EF2 intensity as it moved across Quisenberry Road, where multiple mobile homes were obliterated and a woman was killed in one of them It then caused high-end EF2 damage as it crossed KY 527, heavily damaging or destroying several outbuildings and completely removing the second story of a brick home A commercial building was completely destroyed at this location as well, and hundreds of large trees were snapped or uprooted as the tornado crossed Big Pitman Creek The tornado reached its peak intensity near the rural community of Hobson as it crossed Sanders Road at EF3 intensity Three poorly-anchored homes were completely swept away in this area, two of which were reduced to their subfloors, while a third had its subfloor torn off and blown away, leaving only the home's basement foundation behind A couple of other homes sustained major structural damage, including one that had its entire second floor torn off and destroyed Trees were snapped and partially debarked, vehicles were thrown and mangled, and some ground scarring was noted in aerial surveys of this area [38]\n\n\nNon-tornadic effects\nThe initial winter storm, unofficially referred to by The Weather Channel (TWC) as Winter Storm Atticus, [101] [102] entered the Western United States on December 9 The storm brought the first measurable snowfall of the rainy season to Utah In southern Wyoming and Colorado, the storm dropped a maximum total of 3 feet (0.91 m) of snow in the mountains [1] The storm led to Denver seeing 0.3 inches (0.76 cm), which became their first snowfall of the winter, the latest date on record for this occurrence [103] On December 10, Las Vegas dipped to 32 °F (0 °C) for the first time since February 5, 2020 [104]\n\n\nImpact and aftermath\nNine states were affected by the outbreak with five states being heavily impacted; homes and businesses incurring severe damage in many communities along the path of each of the storms, many of which collapsed and were reduced to rubble The tornadoes resulted in 89 fatalities, 74 of which occurred in Kentucky, and hundreds of injuries [124]\n\n\nRescue and recovery\nRecovery efforts are currently underway, as disaster-aid and humanitarian groups, such as the American Red Cross, The Salvation Army, Adventist Community Services, and World Vision are collecting donations and traveling to or shipping relief items to affected areas to provide aid [143] At least 1,000 families were left homeless or had their properties severely damaged [144] Kentucky state parks provided free housing to those who could not go back to their homes [145] Up to 450 National Guard members were activated to help out with recovery in Kentucky [125] Several firefighters in the Crescent Township, Pennsylvania, volunteer fire department are planning to travel to Mayfield on December 21 to help with cleanup, bringing donated supplies [146]\n\n\nCompanies affected\nMultiple workers at the Mayfield Consumer Products candle factory that was destroyed when the long-track EF4 tornado hit Mayfield, Kentucky, alleged that supervisors told them they would be fired if they left their shifts early ahead of the storm's direct hit on the city Company spokespeople have denied the allegations [147] On December 17, it was reported that multiple workers (only one was named due to fear of reprisal) filed a class-action lawsuit against the company The lawsuit alleged that the company had up to three and a half hours to allow employees to leave before the tornado hit the factory and showed a flagrant indifference to the rights of the workers [148] It was later brought to light that the factory had committed 12 OSHA safety violations in 2019, for which they were forced to pay a fine of $9,810 (2019 USD); specific violations included one stating that safeguards during emergency situations must be working properly at all times, one stating that there had to be people who could perform first aid and one stating that first aid supplies need to be available [149] The Kentucky OSHA board is currently investigating the factory

the United States, resulting in 89 fatalities and hundreds of injuries. The outbreak occurred on December 10 and 11, 2021, and was one of the deadliest tornado outbreaks in the United States in recent years.\n\n**Meteorological Synopsis**\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center (SPC) outlined a slight risk of severe weather across a broad area of the Mississippi Valley on December 8. Despite the potential for a higher-end severe threat to materialize, forecasters expressed uncertainty regarding the extent of instability, degree of directional wind shear, and late timing of potential storms. The following day, the SPC noted the increased potential for organized severe thunderstorms in the region, extending from southeastern Arkansas northeast into southern Indiana, upgrading that area to an enhanced risk.\n\n**Confirmed Tornadoes**\n\nWith a total of 71 tornadoes, this was one of the largest December tornado outbreaks on record in the United States, only to be surpassed by an even larger outbreak just five days later, which recorded well over 100 tornadoes in a shorter time period.\n\n**Northeast Arkansas–Missouri Bootheel–Northwest Tennessee**\n\nThis violent, long-tracked, and deadly EF4 wedge tornado was the fifth of eleven spawned by the Quad-State supercell, and the first of two violent tornadoes produced by the storm. The tornado first touched down in Craighead County, Arkansas, just north of Bay, at 7:07 p.m. CST (01:07 UTC) on the evening of December 10. After initially only causing minor EF0 tree and outbuilding damage, the tornado moved through the south side of Bowman, inflicting EF0 to EF1 damage to roofs as well as downing power poles and tree limbs. The tornado then intensified to EF2 strength as it crossed AR 18 and passed northwest of Lake City, downing trees and damaging or destroying some metal outbuildings. A house also sustained minor damage in this area, and AR 135 north of town was shut down due to downed power lines. The growing tornado then crossed County Road 505 as it continued northeastward, snapping power poles, unroofing a house, inflicting major roof damage to another home, overturning an irrigation pivot sprinkler, and damaging a silo. The tornado then reached EF3 strength as it moved through the western and northern fringes of Monette, where two industrial buildings were destroyed at the west edge of town, and many trees and power poles were snapped. The Monette Manor nursing home lost most of its roof and had masonry exterior walls knocked down, killing one person and trapping 20 other residents and employees, including five people who were injured. Multiple homes and mobile homes were damaged or destroyed in a neighborhood near the nursing home, several large grain silos were torn apart, and AR 139 were also shut down near the town due to downed power lines.\n\n**Defiance–Harvester, Missouri**\n\nA tornado touched down in far west St. Charles County, Missouri, to the north of Route 94 at 7:32 p.m. CST (01:32 UTC). The tornado was initially at low-end EF1 strength, striking its first structures three minutes after it touched down. In this area, the damage was generally limited to the destruction of outbuildings and minor roof damage to a house along Highway T. As the tornado moved northeast to the west of Defiance, it reached EF2 strength as it struck a home and two neighboring outbuildings on Highway F to the north of Femme Osage Creek, destroying both outbuildings and causing less severe damage to the home. As the tornado crossed Highway F, it abruptly strengthened, striking two adjacent homes on the northern side of the road and sweeping both away at high-end EF3 intensity. One of the homes was 110 years old and lacked anchoring, while the other was swept down to its subfloor. One death occurred at this location, and two people were injured, suffering abrasions and other injuries.\n\n**Edwardsville, Illinois**\n\nA tornado touched down northeast of Pontoon Beach in Madison County, Illinois, on the northwest side of the intersection of I-255 and I-270, at 8:27 p.m. CST (02:27 UTC) on the evening of December 10. The tornado was initially weak, with damage at the beginning of the path being limited to downed highway signs, a bent light pole, and some orange construction barrels that were tossed around. Rapidly strengthening and growing to a width of 300 yards, the tornado reached EF3 strength as it tracked northeast towards Edwardsville. It struck an Amazon warehouse along Chain Of Rocks Road, where night workers were beginning their shifts and several employees were attending a Christmas party being held as the tornado approached the facility. Six people were killed when the roof was lifted off the building, and the west-facing walls of the structure collapsed inward, causing a progressive structural failure that resulted in total destruction of most of the warehouse.\n\n**Western Kentucky**\n\nAfter the first long-tracked EF4 tornado dissipated over western Obion County, Tennessee, the associated supercell underwent a brief mesocyclone cycling phase, producing three weak, short-lived tornadoes. Minutes later, it spawned a new long-tracked violent tornado in northern Obion County near Woodland Mills at 8:54 p.m. CST (02:54 UTC). The tornado crossed into Kentucky near the community of State Line and rapidly intensified to EF4 strength as it struck Cayce at about 9:00 p.m. CST (03:00 UTC), where major damage occurred to homes, businesses, a school building, and the town's fire station. A few buildings were leveled or swept away. One person was killed in the town, and others were injured.\n\n**Kenton–Dresden, Tennessee/Pembroke, Kentucky**\n\nThis intense, long-tracked tornado first touched down in the northeastern part of Newbern in Dyer County, Tennessee, at 10:32 p.m. CST. It quickly intensified as it moved northeastward at EF2 strength. Several homes suffered significant damage to their roofs and garages, and some houses had carports ripped off. Many trees were snapped or uprooted, and power lines were downed. The most significant damage in Newbern occurred along Washington Street, where a gas station was destroyed. The metal canopy over the gas pumps was blown away, and the convenience store was completely destroyed, leaving two people trapped inside who had to be extracted from the rubble. A detached garage was also destroyed with the debris scattered downwind, and an elementary school and a vocational school also sustained damage.\n\n**Bowling Green, Kentucky**\n\nAfter the Logan County EF3 tornado lifted, the same supercell produced this intense, destructive, and deadly tornado at around 1:09 a.m. CST on December 11 in Warren County, southwest of Bowling Green. The tornado first touched down south of the intersection of Wimpee Smith Road and Petros Browning Road, where EF0 tree damage occurred. Near Tommy Smith Road, the tornado quickly began to strengthen and reached EF2 intensity. Many trees were downed, a 1,700-pound horse trailer was thrown 300 feet into a ravine, while multiple barns and farm buildings were completely destroyed in this area. Just northeast of this point, high-end EF2 damage occurred as the tornado crossed KY 1083, where multiple homes and outbuildings were damaged or destroyed. This included one house that sustained complete removal of its roof and exterior walls, and was left with only an interior hallway standing.\n\n**Saloma–Bradfordsville, Kentucky**\n\nThe last EF3 tornado to occur during the outbreak touched down in Taylor County, Kentucky along Chaney Creek Road northwest of Saloma at 2:20 a.m. CST.

destroyed This included one house that sustained complete removal of its roof and exterior walls, and was left with only an interior hallway standing Based on scouring of corn stubble in fields, and analysis of damage patterns visible in aerial drone video taken in this area, damage surveyors determined that the tornado displayed an unusual internal structure during this initial portion of its path There appeared to be a smaller circulation that produced an intense, narrow path of damage embedded within a broader, weaker circulation that caused less intense damage The tornado weakened to EF1 strength as it crossed Van Meter Road and Fuqua Road, but continued to cause extensive tree damage A one-story home also sustained minor roof damage along Fuqua Road Additional EF1 damage occurred as it crossed LC Carr Road and Blue Level Road, where some barns and outbuildings were damaged, homes sustained siding and gutter damage, and trees were snapped The Zomi Agape church sustained considerable roof damage, and insulation from the building was strewn in all directions As the tornado began to enter the western fringes of Bowling Green, it rapidly intensified and became strong again as it produced EF3 damage to homes along Rembrandt Court Here, multiple homes were destroyed and left with only interior rooms standing, one of which was moved 15 feet (4.6 m) off of its foundation Nearby, the tornado moved across Old Tramm Road and Powell Street, where some one-story homes and duplexes were destroyed, a couple of which were leveled or swept clean from their foundations However, it was noted that a large storage building was destroyed across the street from these residences, and pieces of heavy equipment were thrown into them Damage surveyors determined that the extent of the destruction noted at the homes and duplexes was more due to heavy debris impacts, rather than extreme winds, and a rating of high-end EF2 was applied in this area as a result It then crossed the I-165 into more densely-populated areas of the city as an EF3 tornado [38] By this time, during live severe weather coverage on ABC/Fox affiliate WBKO; the station's tower camera was

a second tornado formed as a result of a separate, smaller circulation within the same parent supercell It first touched in the southeastern part of Bowling Green at 1:19 a.m CST (07:19 UTC), near the Bowling Green–Warren County Regional Airport It first damaged a small metal storage building along Searcy Way, then caused significant roof damage to a well-built airplane hangar as it moved across the airport grounds Damage along this initial part of the path was rated EF1 An anemometer at the airport recorded an 63 mph (101 km/h) wind gust as the tornado passed by, though it was not directly hit by the tornado The tornado continued at high-end EF1 strength as it moved to the northeast, parallel to I-65 It grew to 200 yards (180 m) wide, striking apartments and townhouses at The Hub apartments These structures sustained extensive roof and window damage, with garages at the complex suffering the most intense damage Trees were also downed in this area Additional damage to trees and roofs occurred in a neighborhood just north of Lovers Lane Park The tornado became strong as it crossed Mount Victor Lane, where a house was heavily damaged and shifted off of its foundation, and damage to that residence was rated low-end EF2 It weakened again as it crossed the Barren River just east of the path of the main EF3 tornado, which followed moments later Homes and apartment buildings along McFadin Station Street suffered considerable roof and siding damage, and trees and power lines were downed, with damage in this area being rated EF1 Just beyond this point, extensive tree damage occurred and a barn was destroyed near Porter Pike The tornado then reached peak strength, producing EF2 damage as it struck NCM Motorsports Park on the south side of the interstate [38]\n\n\nSaloma–Bradfordsville, Kentucky\nThe last EF3 tornado to occur during the outbreak touched down in Taylor County, Kentucky along Chaney Creek Road northwest of Saloma at 2:20 a.m CST (08:20 UTC) It moved northeastward at EF1 strength and crossed Wade Lane A couple of homes had roof damage, some barns and outbuildings were damaged, trees were downed, and a fenced-in peacock enclosure was destroyed in this area The tornado then strengthened to EF2 intensity as it moved across Quisenberry Road, where multiple mobile homes were obliterated and a woman was killed in one of them It then caused high-end EF2 damage as it crossed KY 527, heavily damaging or destroying several outbuildings and completely removing the second story of a brick home A commercial building was completely destroyed at this location as well, and hundreds of large trees were snapped or uprooted as the tornado crossed Big Pitman Creek The tornado reached its peak intensity near the rural community of Hobson as it crossed Sanders Road at EF3 intensity Three poorly-anchored homes were completely swept away in this area, two of which were reduced to their subfloors, while a third had its subfloor torn off and blown away, leaving only the home's basement foundation behind A couple of other homes sustained major structural damage, including one that had its entire second floor torn off and destroyed Trees were snapped and partially debarked, vehicles were thrown and mangled, and some ground scarring was noted in aerial surveys of this area [38]\n\n\nNon-tornadic effects\nThe initial winter storm, unofficially referred to by The Weather Channel (TWC) as Winter Storm Atticus, [101] [102] entered the Western United States on December 9 The storm brought the first measurable snowfall of the rainy season to Utah In southern Wyoming and Colorado, the storm dropped a maximum total of 3 feet (0.91 m) of snow in the mountains [1] The storm led to Denver seeing 0.3 inches (0.76 cm), which became their first snowfall of the winter, the latest date on record for this occurrence [103] On December 10, Las Vegas dipped to 32 °F (0 °C) for the first time since February 5, 2020 [104]\n\n\nImpact and aftermath\nNine states were affected by the outbreak with five states being heavily impacted; homes and businesses incurring severe damage in many communities along the path of each of the storms, many of which collapsed and were reduced to rubble The tornadoes resulted in 89 fatalities, 74 of which occurred in Kentucky, and hundreds of injuries [124]\n\n\nRescue and recovery\nRecovery efforts are currently underway, as disaster-aid and humanitarian groups, such as the American Red Cross, The Salvation Army, Adventist Community Services, and World Vision are collecting donations and traveling to or shipping relief items to affected areas to provide aid [143] At least 1,000 families were left homeless or had their properties severely damaged [144] Kentucky state parks provided free housing to those who could not go back to their homes [145] Up to 450 National Guard members were activated to help out with recovery in Kentucky [125] Several firefighters in the Crescent Township, Pennsylvania, volunteer fire department are planning to travel to Mayfield on December 21 to help with cleanup, bringing donated supplies [146]\n\n\nCompanies affected\nMultiple workers at the Mayfield Consumer Products candle factory that was destroyed when the long-track EF4 tornado hit Mayfield, Kentucky, alleged that supervisors told them they would be fired if they left their shifts early ahead of the storm's direct hit on the city Company spokespeople have denied the allegations [147] On December 17, it was reported that multiple workers (only one was named due to fear of reprisal) filed a class-action lawsuit against the company The lawsuit alleged that the company had up to three and a half hours to allow employees to leave before the tornado hit the factory and showed a flagrant indifference to the rights of the workers [148] It was later brought to light that the factory had committed 12 OSHA safety violations in 2019, for which they were forced to pay a fine of $9,810 (2019 USD); specific violations included one stating that safeguards during emergency situations must be working properly at all times, one stating that there had to be people who could perform first aid and one stating that first aid supplies need to be available [149] The Kentucky OSHA board is currently investigating the factory [149]\n\n\nPolitical\n\"I

The title is not automatic or heritable, but rather an honor bestowed by the monarch to their eldest son or heir. The title is considered a symbol of the British monarchy's connection to Wales, a country that has been part of the United Kingdom since the 13th century.\n\n**Welsh Princes of Wales**\n\nThe first known use of the title \"Prince of Wales\" dates back to the 1160s, when Owain Gwynedd, ruler of the Kingdom of Gwynedd, used it in a letter to Louis VII of France. Owain's aim in using the title was likely to claim pre-eminence over other native Welsh rulers. Following Owain's death in 1170, no other ruler adopted the title until 1245, when Rhys ap Gruffydd of Deheubarth used several titles, including \"Prince of Wales\" or \"Prince of the Welsh.\"\n\n**Origins to 1283**\n\nThe title \"Prince of Wales\" gained more widespread use in the 13th century, particularly after the conquest of Wales by Edward I of England in 1282. Edward began the custom of granting the title to the heir apparent to the English throne, and his son, Edward of Caernarfon, was invested as the first Plantagenet Prince of Wales in 1301.

The title is also associated with a range of ceremonial and symbolic roles, including the investiture of the Prince of Wales, which is typically held at Caernarfon Castle in Wales.\n\n**Insignia**\n\nThe Prince of Wales's feathers are the badge of the Prince of Wales by virtue of being the heir apparent. The ostrich feathers are generally traced back to Edward of Woodstock ('The Black Prince'), who bore them as an alternative to his differenced royal arms.

later King Edward VIII) was invested as Prince of Wales at Caernarfon Castle in July 1911 This was the first such public investiture for centuries He had been created Prince of Wales in June 1910.\n\n\n1969 investiture of Prince Charles\nAlthough the investiture of Charles as Prince of Wales in 1969 took place during a period of social change and a growing Welsh nationalist movement, it was largely welcomed by people in Wales [40] The investiture was also attended, by invitation, by 3,500 people who lived and worked in Wales [41] In the UK, the press focused on the pomp and regalia, with newspaper headlines such as \"Welsh go wild for Their Royal Prince\" and \"Proud Wales takes Prince to her heart.\" [42] It was also supported by the Secretary of State for Wales at the time, George Thomas, although he remained a controversial figure in Wales [43] Thomas later said to Prime Minister Harold Wilson that Charles's speech had \"boosted Welsh nationalism.\" [42]\n\n\nWilliam as Prince of Wales\nOn 9 September 2022 (the day after his accession to the throne), during his first address as king, Charles III said of his son William, \"Today I am proud to create him Prince of Wales, Tywysog Cymru The country whose title I've been so greatly privileged to bear during so much of my life of duty.\" [50] Buckingham Palace stated that \"The Prince and Princess  [of Wales] look forward to celebrating Wales's proud history and traditions as well as a future that is full of promise\" [51] The First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, noted that \"William will be absolutely aware of the sensitivities that surround the title...\" [50]\n\n\nContemporary debate\nCharles III proclaimed William as Prince of Wales on 9 September 2022, the day after the death of Elizabeth II, surprising Mark Drakeford, First Minister of Wales, who said he had not been given notice of the announcement The creation of a new Prince of Wales was  the catalyst for a renewed debate on the title, and already, on 8 September, a petition had been started calling for the title to be ended The petition had garnered 25,000 signatures in its first few days [54]\n\n\nTitle\nCharles III proclaimed William as Prince of Wales on 9 September 2022, the day after the death of Elizabeth II, surprising Mark Drakeford, First Minister of Wales, who said he had not been given notice of the announcement The creation of a new Prince of Wales was  the catalyst for a renewed debate on the title, and already, on 8 September, a petition had been started calling for the title to be ended The petition had garnered 25,000 signatures in its first few days [54]\n\n\nOpinion polls\nA BBC Wales poll in 1999 showed that 73% of Welsh speakers believed the title should continue after Charles [58] A BBC poll in 2009, 40 years following the investiture, revealed 58% of Welsh people support the title \"Prince of Wales\"; 26% opposed the title However, only 16% responded that Wales had benefited from having a prince [59] [60]\n\n\nList of princes of Wales (English or British heirs apparent)\nThe current sovereign Charles III was the longest serving Prince of Wales for 64 years and 44 days between 1958 and 2022, and the oldest person to hold the position He was also heir apparent for longer than any other in British history [79] Upon the death of his mother on 8 September 2022, Charles became king and the title merged with the Crown [80] The following day, King Charles III bestowed the title upon his elder son, Prince William, Duke of Cornwall and Cambridge [81] [52] Prince William is the oldest person to be created Prince of Wales.\n\n\nFamily tree\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Pan_Am_Flight_103", "content": "\nAircraft\nThe aircraft operating Pan Am Flight 103 was a Boeing 747-121, MSN 19646, registered as N739PA [9] and named Clipper Maid of the Seas [10] Before 1979, it had been named Clipper Morning Light [citation needed] It was the 15th 747 built and had first flown on 25 January 1970 It was delivered to Pan Am on 15 February, [11] [12] one month after the first 747 entered service with Pan Am [11] [13] In 1978, as Clipper Morning Light, it had appeared in \"Conquering the Atlantic\", the fourth episode of the BBC Television documentary series Diamonds in the Sky, presented by Julian Pettifer [14]\n\n\nFlight\nPan Am 103 originated as a feeder flight at Frankfurt Airport, West Germany, using a Boeing 727 and the flight number PA103-A Both Pan Am and Trans World Airlines routinely changed the type of aircraft operating different legs of a flight PA103 was bookable as either a single Frankfurt–New York or a Frankfurt–Detroit itinerary, though a scheduled change of aircraft took place in London's Heathrow Airport [citation needed]\n\n\nExplosion and impact timeline\nOn its arrival at Heathrow Terminal 3 on the day of the disaster, the passengers and their luggage (as well as an unaccompanied suitcase which was part of the interline luggage on the feeder flight) were transferred directly to Clipper Maid of the Seas, a Boeing 747-100 with the registration N739PA whose previous flight had originated from Los Angeles and arrived via San Francisco as flight PA 124, landing at 12 noon and parking at Gate K-14 [17] The plane, which operated the flight's transatlantic leg, pushed back from the terminal at 18:04 and took off from runway 27R at 18:25, bound for New York JFK Airport and then Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport Contrary to many popular accounts of the disaster (though repeated, with reference, below), the flight, which had a scheduled gate departure time of 18:00, left Heathrow airport on time [18] [19]\n\n\nDeparture\nOn its arrival at Heathrow Terminal 3 on the day of the disaster, the passengers and their luggage (as well as an unaccompanied suitcase which was part of the interline luggage on the feeder flight) were transferred directly to Clipper Maid of the Seas, a Boeing 747-100 with the registration N739PA whose previous flight had originated from Los Angeles and arrived via San Francisco as flight PA 124, landing at 12 noon and parking at Gate K-14 [17] The plane, which operated the flight's transatlantic leg, pushed back from the terminal at 18:04 and took off from runway 27R at 18:25, bound for New York JFK Airport and then Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport Contrary to many popular accounts of the disaster (though repeated, with reference, below), the flight, which had a scheduled gate departure time of 18:00, left Heathrow airport on time [18] [19]\n\n\nLoss of contact\nAt 18:58, the aircraft established two-way radio contact with Shanwick Oceanic Area Control in Prestwick on 123.95 MHz.\n\n\nDisintegration of aircraft\nThe explosion punched a 50 cm (20 in) hole on the left side of the fuselage Investigators from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) concluded that no emergency procedures had been started in the cockpit [24] The CVR, located in the tail section of the aircraft, was found in a field by police searchers within 24 hours No distress call was recorded; a 180-millisecond hissing noise could be heard as the explosion destroyed the aircraft's communications center [25] The explosion in the aircraft hold was magnified by the uncontrolled decompression of the fuselage – a large difference in pressure between the aircraft's interior and exterior The aircraft's elevator- and rudder-control cables had been disrupted and the fuselage pitched downwards and to the left [26]\n\n\nFuselage impact\nThe fuselage continued moving forward and down until it reached 19,000 ft (5,800 m), when its dive became nearly vertical [22]: 44  Due to the extreme flutter, the vertical stabilizer disintegrated, which in turn produced large yawing movements As the forward fuselage continued to disintegrate, the flying debris tore off both of the horizontal stabilizers, while the rear fuselage, the remaining three engines, and the fin torque box separated [24] The rear fuselage, parts of the baggage hold, and three landing gear units landed at Rosebank Crescent [22]: 44  The fuselage consisting of the main wing box structure landed in Sherwood Crescent, destroying three homes and creating a large impact crater The 200,000 lb (91,000 kg) of jet fuel ignited by the impact started fires, which destroyed several additional houses [22]: 4  Investigators determined that both wings had landed in the Sherwood Crescent crater, saying, \"the total absence of debris from the wing primary structure found remote from the crater confirmed the initial impression that the complete wing box structure had been present at the main impact.\" [22]: 16 \n\n\nVictims\nAll 243 passengers and 16 crew members were killed, as were 11 residents of Lockerbie on the ground Of the 270 total fatalities, 190 were American citizens and 43 were British citizens Nineteen other nationalities were represented, with four or fewer passengers per country [10] [27]\n\n\nCrew\nFlight 103 was under the command of Captain James B MacQuarrie (55), a Pan Am pilot since 1964 with almost 11,000 flight hours, of which over 4,000 had been accrued in 747 aircraft He previously served three years in the U.S Navy and five years in the Massachusetts Air National Guard, where he held the rank of major First Officer Raymond R Wagner (52), a pilot with Pan Am since 1966 with almost 5,500 hours in the 747 and a total of nearly 12,000 hours, had previously served eight years in the New Jersey National Guard Flight Engineer Jerry D Avritt (46), who joined Pan Am in 1980 after 13 years with National Airlines, had more than 8,000 hours of flying time, with nearly 500 hours in the 747 The cockpit crew was based at John F Kennedy International Airport [22]\n\n\nPassengers\nThirty-five of the passengers were students from Syracuse University, who participated in the university's Division of International Programs Abroad (abbreviated as \"DIPA Program\" and renamed to \"Syracuse University Abroad\" in 2006, while also known as \"Syracuse Abroad\" and \"Study Abroad Program\") and were returning home for Christmas following a semester in Syracuse's London and European campuses Ten of these students were from other universities and colleges (including but not limited to Colgate University and University of Colorado) having collaborative relationships with Syracuse  Several of the students were due to connect to Pan Am Express Flight 4919 to Syracuse Hancock International Airport at JFK Airport later that evening.\n\n\nSyracuse University students\nThirty-five of the passengers were students from Syracuse

Pan Am Express Flight 4919 to Syracuse Hancock International Airport at JFK Airport later that evening.\n\n\nNotable passengers\nProminent among the passenger victims was the 50-year-old UN Commissioner for Namibia (then South West Africa), Bernt Carlsson, who would have attended the signing ceremony of the New York Accords at the UN headquarters the following day [30] James Fuller, CEO of Volkswagen of America, was returning home together with marketing director Lou Marengo from a meeting with Volkswagen executives in Germany [31] Also aboard were Irish Olympic sailor Peter Dix, [32] rock musician Paul Jeffreys and his wife, Rachel Jeffreys (née Jones) [33] [34] Dr Irving Sigal, a molecular biologist [35] and Jonathan White, 33, an American accountant, son of David White, American actor who played Larry Tate on “Bewitched.”\n\n\nUS government officials\nAboard the flight were Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) Special Agents Daniel Emmett O'Connor and Ronald Albert Lariviere [36] [37] Matthew Gannon, the Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) deputy station chief in Beirut, Lebanon, was sitting in seat 14J, which was located in the business class (branded as \"Clipper Class\") cabin [38] A group of US intelligence specialists was on board the flight Their presence gave rise to speculations and conspiracy theories that one or more of them had been targeted [39]\n\n\nLockerbie residents\nEleven Lockerbie residents on Sherwood Crescent were killed when the wing section hit the house at 13 Sherwood Crescent at more than 800 km/h (500 mph) and exploded, creating a crater 47 m (154 ft) long and with a volume of 560 m3 (20,000 cu ft; 730 cu yd) [22] The property was completely destroyed and its two occupants were killed Their bodies were never found Several other houses and their foundations were destroyed, and 21 others were damaged beyond repair.\n\n\nPrior alerts\nTwo alerts were released shortly before the bombing.\n\n\nHelsinki warning\nOn 5 December 1988 (16 days prior to the attack), the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a security bulletin saying that, on that day, a man with an Arabic accent had telephoned the US Embassy in  Helsinki, Finland, and told them that a Pan Am flight from Frankfurt to the United States would be blown up within the next two weeks by someone associated with the Abu Nidal Organization; he said a Finnish woman would carry the bomb on board as an unwitting courier [46]\n\n\nPLO's warning\nJust days before the bombing, security forces in European countries, including the UK, were put on alert after a warning from the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) that extremists might launch terrorist attacks to undermine the then-ongoing dialogue between the United States and the PLO [50]\n\n\nClaims of responsibility\nOn the day of the bombing, the French Directorate-General for External Security was informed by their British counterpart MI6 that the UK suspected the Libyans to be behind the bombing [51]\n\n\nInvestigation\nThe initial investigation into the crash site by Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary involved many helicopter surveys, satellite imaging, and a search of the area by police and soldiers The wreckage of the crash was scattered over 2,000 square kilometres (770 sq mi), and AAIB investigators were confronted by a massive jigsaw puzzle in trying to piece the plane back together In total, 4 million pieces of wreckage were collected and registered on computer files More than 10,000 pieces of debris were retrieved, tagged, and entered into a computer tracking system The perpetrators had apparently intended the plane to crash into the sea, destroying any traceable evidence, but  its explosion over land left a trail of evidence [62]\n\n\nCivil investigation\nThe initial investigation into the crash site by Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary involved many helicopter surveys, satellite imaging, and a search of the area by police and soldiers The wreckage of the crash was scattered over 2,000 square kilometres (770 sq mi), and AAIB investigators were confronted by a massive jigsaw puzzle in trying to piece the plane back together In total,

sea, destroying any traceable evidence, but  its explosion over land left a trail of evidence [62]\n\n\nWitnesses\nThe clothes were traced to a Maltese merchant, Tony Gauci, who became a key prosecution witness, testifying that he sold the clothes to a man of Libyan appearance Gauci was interviewed 23 times, giving contradictory evidence about who had bought the clothes, that person's age and appearance, and the date of purchase, but later identified Abdelbaset al-Megrahi As Megrahi had only been in Malta on 7 December, that date was assumed to be the purchase date This date is in doubt, as Gauci had testified that Malta's Christmas lights had not been on when the clothes had been purchased; the lights were later found to have been switched on on 6 December Scottish police had also failed to inform the defense that another witness had testified seeing Libyan men making a similar purchase on a different day [63] An official report, providing information not made available to the defense during the original trial, stated that on 19 April 1999, four days before identifying al-Megrahi for the first time, Gauci had seen a picture of al-Megrahi in a magazine that connected him to the bombing, a fact that could have distorted his judgement [64] Gauci was shown the same magazine during his testimony at al-Megrahi's trial and asked if he had identified the photograph in April 1999 as being the person who purchased the clothing; he was then asked if that person was in the court Gauci then identified al-Megrahi for the court, stating, \"He is the man on this side He resembles him a lot\" [65]\n\n\nCriminal inquiry\nKnown as the Lockerbie bombing and the Lockerbie air disaster in the UK, it was described by Scotland's Lord Advocate as the UK's largest criminal inquiry led by the smallest police force in Britain, Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary [68]\n\n\nAftermath\nFollowing the bombing, as information emerged that warnings had been received, many people, both relatives of the victims as well as the general public, were outraged at the FAA and airlines for not disclosing information Frustrated with a lack of accountability from government officials and agencies, the families of the victims created a lobbyist/support group known as \"The Victims of Pan AmFlight 103\" This group, with the support of United States Senator Alfonse D'Amato of New York, in hearings before the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, offered the group's prepared statement for inclusion in the record of the hearings [75]\n\n\nTrial, appeals, and release\nOn 3 May 2000, the trial of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah began Megrahi was found guilty of 270 counts of murder on 31 January 2001, and was sentenced to life imprisonment in Scotland; his co-defendant, Fhimah, was found not guilty [76]\n\n\nAppeal\nThe defense team had 14 days in which to appeal against Megrahi's conviction, and an additional six weeks to submit the full grounds of the appeal These were considered by a judge sitting in private who decided to grant Megrahi leave to appeal The only basis for an appeal under Scots law is that  a \"miscarriage of justice\" had occurred, which is not defined in statute, so  the appeal court must determine the meaning of these words in each case [78] Because three judges and one alternate judge had presided over the trial, five judges were required to preside over the Court of Criminal Appeal: Lord Cullen, Lord Justice-General, Lord Kirkwood, Lord Osborne, Lord Macfadyen, and Lord Nimmo Smith.\n\n\nSCCRC review\nMegrahi's lawyers applied to the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) on 23 September 2003 to have his case referred back to the Court of Criminal Appeal for a fresh appeal against conviction The application to the SCCRC followed the publication of two reports in February 2001 and March 2002 by Hans Köchler, who had been an international observer at Camp Zeist, appointed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations Köchler described the decisions of the trial and appeal courts as a \"spectacular miscarriage of justice\" [80] Köchler also issued a series of statements in 2003, 2005, and 2007 calling for an independent international inquiry into the case and accusing the West of \"double standards in criminal justice\" in relation to the Lockerbie trial on the one hand and the HIV trial in Libya on the other [81] [82] [83]\n\n\nSecond appeal\nA procedural hearing at the Appeal Court took place on 11 October 2007 when prosecution lawyers and Megrahi's defense counsel, Maggie Scott QC, discussed a number of legal issues with a panel of three judges [88] One of the issues concerned a number of documents that were shown before the trial to the prosecution, but were not disclosed to the defense The documents are understood to relate to the Mebo MST-13 timer that allegedly detonated the PA103 bomb [89] Maggie Scott also asked for documents relating to an alleged payment of $2 million made to Maltese merchant, Tony Gauci, for his testimony at the trial, which led to the conviction of Megrahi [90]\n\n\nCompassionate release and controversy\nOn 25 July 2009, Megrahi applied to be released from jail on compassionate grounds [94] Three weeks later, on 12 August 2009, Megrahi applied to have his second appeal dropped and was granted compassionate release for his terminal prostate cancer [95] [96] On 20 August 2009, Megrahi was released from prison and traveled by chartered jet to Libya [97] [98] [99]\nHis survival beyond the approximate \"three-month\" prognosis generated some controversy It is believed that, following his release, Al-Megrahi was prescribed abiraterone and prednisone, a combination that extends median survival by an average of 14.8 months After hospital treatment ended, he returned to his family home Following his release, Megrahi published evidence on the Internet that was gathered for the abandoned second appeal which he claimed would clear his name [100]\n\n\n2020 indictment\nIn 2020, US authorities indicted Libyan national Abu Agila Mohammad Mas'ud Kheir Al-Marimi for participating in the bombing [105] In December 2022, the United States government obtained custody of 71-year-old Mas'ud [106] [107]\n\n\nAlleged motives\nUntil 2002, Libya had never formally admitted to carrying out the 1988 Lockerbie bombing On 16 August 2003, Libya formally admitted responsibility for Pan Am Flight 103 in a letter presented to the president of the United Nations Security Council Felicity Barringer of The New York Times said that the letter had \"general language that lacked any expression of remorse\" for the people killed in the bombing [111] The letter stated that it \"accepted responsibility for the actions of its officials\" [112]\n\n\nLibya\nUntil 2002, Libya had never formally admitted to carrying out the 1988 Lockerbie bombing On 16 August 2003, Libya formally admitted responsibility for Pan Am Flight 103 in a letter presented to the president of the United Nations Security Council Felicity Barringer of The New York Times said that the letter had \"general language that lacked any expression of remorse\" for the people killed in the bombing [111] The letter stated that it \"accepted responsibility for the actions of its officials\" [112]\n\n\nDemands for independent inquiry\nPrior to the abandonment of Megrahi's second appeal against conviction and while new evidence could be still tested in court, there had been few calls for an independent inquiry into the Lockerbie bombing Demands for such an inquiry emerged later, and became more insistent On 2 September 2009, former MEP Michael McGowan demanded that the UK government call for an urgent, independent inquiry led by the UN to find out the truth about Pan Am flight 103 \"We owe it to the families of the victims of Lockerbie and the international community to identify those responsible,\" McGowan said [122] Two online petitions were started: one calling for a UK public inquiry into the Lockerbie bombing; [123] the other a UN inquiry into the murder of UN Commissioner for Namibia, Bernt Carlsson, in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing In September 2009, a third petition which was addressed to the President of the United Nations General Assembly demanded that the UN should \"institute a full public inquiry\" into the Lockerbie disaster [124]\n\n\nClaims of Gaddafi involvement\nOn 23 February 2011, amidst the Libyan Civil War, Mustafa Abdul Jalil, former Libyan Justice Minister (and later member and Chairman of the anti-Gaddafi National Transitional Council), alleged that he had evidence that Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi, had personally ordered Abdelbaset al-Megrahi to bomb Pan Am Flight 103 [130] [131]\n\n\nAlternative theories\nBased on a 1995 investigation by journalists Paul Foot and John Ashton, alternative explanations of the plot to commit the Lockerbie bombing were listed by The Guardian's Patrick Barkham in 1999 [133] Following the Lockerbie verdict in 2001 and the appeal in 2002, attempts have been made to re-open the case amid allegations that Libya was framed One theory suggests the bomb on the plane was detonated by radio Another theory suggests the CIA prevented the suitcase containing the bomb from being searched Iran's involvement is alleged, either in association with a Palestine militant group, or in loading the bomb while the plane was at Heathrow The US Defense Intelligence Agency alleges that Ali Akbar Mohtashamipur (Ayatollah Mohtashemi), a member of the Iranian government, paid US$10 million for the bombing:\n\n\nPCAST statement\nOn 29 September 1989, President Bush appointed Ann McLaughlin Korologos, former Secretary of Labor, to chair the President's Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism (PCAST) to review and report on aviation security policy in the light of the sabotage of flight PA103 Oliver Revell, the FBI's Executive Assistant Director, was assigned to advise and assist PCAST in their task [138]\n\n\nCompensation\nOn 29 May 2002, Libya offered up to US$2.7 billion to settle claims by the families of the 270 killed in the Lockerbie bombing, representing US$10 million per family The Libyan offer was that 40% of the money would be released when United Nations sanctions, suspended in 1999, were canceled; another 40% when US trade sanctions were lifted; and the final 20% when the US State Department removed Libya from its list of states sponsoring terrorism [140] [141]\n\n\nFrom Libya\nOn 29 May 2002, Libya offered up to US$2.7 billion to settle claims by the families of the 270 killed in the Lockerbie bombing, representing US$10 million per family The Libyan offer was that 40% of the money would be released when United Nations sanctions, suspended in 1999, were canceled; another 40% when US trade sanctions were lifted; and the final 20% when the US State Department removed Libya from its list of states sponsoring terrorism [140] [141]\n\n\nFebruary 2011\nIn an interview with Swedish newspaper Expressen on 23 February 2011, Mustafa Abdul Jalil, former Justice Secretary of Libya, claimed to have evidence that Gaddafi personally ordered Al-Megrahi to carry out the bombing [130]\n\n\nContingency fees for lawyers\nOn 5 December 2003, Jim Kreindler revealed that his Park Avenue law firm would receive an initial contingency fee of around US$1 million from each of the 128 American families Kreindler represents The firm's fees could exceed US$300 million eventually Kreindler argued that the fees were justified, since \"Over the past seven years we have had a dedicated team working tirelessly on this and we deserve the contingency fee we have worked so hard for, and I think we have provided the relatives with value for money.\" [144]\n\n\nFrom Pan Am\nIn 1992, a US federal court found Pan Am guilty of willful misconduct due to lax security screening caused by failure to implement baggage reconciliation, a new security program mandated by the FAA prior to the incident, which requires unaccompanied luggage to be searched by hand and to ensure passengers board flights onto which they have checked baggage; Pan Am relied more on the less-effective method of x-ray screening Two of Pan Am's subsidiaries, Alert Management Inc., which handled Pan Am's security at foreign airports, and Pan American World Services, were also found guilty [160]\n\n\nMemorials and tributes\nThere are several private and public memorials to the PA103 victims Dark Elegy is the work of sculptor Suse Lowenstein of Long Island, whose son Alexander, then 21, was a passenger on the flight The work consists of 43 nude statues of the wives and mothers who lost a husband or a child Inside each sculpture there is a personal memento of the victim [161]\n\n\nUnited States\nOn 3 November 1995, then-U.S President Bill Clinton dedicated a Memorial Cairn to the victims at Arlington National Cemetery, [162] and there are similar memorials at Syracuse University; Dryfesdale Cemetery, near Lockerbie; and in Sherwood Crescent, Lockerbie [163]\n\n\nThe Women of

103**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nPan Am Flight 103 was a scheduled international passenger flight that was destroyed by a terrorist bomb on December 21, 1988. The bombing occurred over Lockerbie, Scotland, resulting in the deaths of 270 people. The flight was operated by a Boeing 747-121, with registration N739PA, and was flying from Frankfurt, West Germany to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, with a scheduled stop in London.\n\n**Aircraft**\n\nThe aircraft operating Pan Am Flight 103 was a Boeing 747-121, with the registration number N739PA and the name Clipper Maid of the Seas. The plane was built in 1969 and had been delivered to Pan American World Airways on February 15, 1970. It was the 15th 747 built by Boeing and had flown over 18,000 hours before the disaster. The plane had a seating capacity of 365 passengers and had a crew of 16.\n\n**Flight**\n\nPan Am Flight 103 originated as a feeder flight at Frankfurt Airport, West Germany, using a Boeing 727 and the flight number PA103-A. The flight was scheduled to depart Frankfurt at 18:00 and arrive at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport at 18:45. The aircraft was then supposed to fly to Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, where it would arrive at 20:05. However, the flight was changed to a Boeing 747-100, with the registration number N739PA, and the flight was operated as a direct flight from Frankfurt to New York.\n\n**Explosion and Impact Timeline**\n\nThe aircraft departed Frankfurt Airport at 18:00 and landed at London's Heathrow Airport at 18:04. The passengers and their luggage were transferred directly to the Boeing 747-100, which was parked at Gate K-14. The plane took off from Heathrow Airport at 18:25 and flew over Lockerbie, Scotland. At 18:58, the aircraft established two-way radio contact with Shanwick Oceanic Area Control in Prestwick. However, this was the last communication from the aircraft. The explosion occurred at an altitude of 31,000 feet, and the impact occurred at 19,000 feet.\n\n**Loss of Contact**\n\nThe aircraft lost contact with air traffic control at 18:58, and a distress call was not made. The CVR, located in the tail section of the aircraft, was found in a field by police searchers within 24 hours. No emergency procedures had been started in the cockpit, and the CVR recorded a 180-millisecond hissing noise as the explosion destroyed the aircraft's communications center.\n\n**Disintegration of Aircraft**\n\nThe explosion punched a 50cm hole on the left side of the fuselage, disrupting the elevator- and rudder-control cables. The fuselage pitched downwards and to the left, and the vertical stabilizer disintegrated, producing large yawing movements. The forward fuselage continued to disintegrate, and the flying debris tore off both of the horizontal stabilizers. The rear fuselage, parts of the baggage hold, and three landing gear units landed a", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Pan_Am_Flight_103\" following this outline:\n\n\nAircraft\nThe aircraft operating Pan Am Flight 103 was a Boeing 747-121, MSN 19646, registered as N739PA [9] and named Clipper Maid of the Seas [10] Before 1979, it had been named Clipper Morning Light [citation needed] It was the 15th 747 built and had first flown on 25 January 1970 It was delivered to Pan Am on 15 February, [11] [12] one month after the first 747 entered service with Pan Am [11] [13] In 1978, as Clipper Morning Light, it had appeared in \"Conquering the Atlantic\", the fourth episode of the BBC Television documentary series Diamonds in the Sky, presented by Julian Pettifer [14]\n\n\nFlight\nPan Am 103 originated as a feeder flight at Frankfurt Airport, West Germany, using a Boeing 727 and the flight number PA103-A Both Pan Am and Trans World Airlines routinely changed the type of aircraft operating different legs of a flight PA103 was bookable as either a single Frankfurt–New York or a Frankfurt–Detroit itinerary, though a scheduled change of aircraft took place in London's Heathrow Airport [citation needed]\n\n\nExplosion and impact timeline\nOn its arrival at Heathrow Terminal 3 on the day of the disaster, the passengers and their luggage (as well as an unaccompanied suitcase which was part of the interline luggage on the feeder flight) were transferred directly to Clipper Maid of the Seas, a Boeing 747-100 with the registration N739PA whose previous flight had originated from Los Angeles and arrived via San Francisco as flight PA 124, landing at 12 noon and parking at Gate K-14 [17] The plane, which operated the flight's transatlantic leg, pushed back from the terminal at 18:04 and took off from runway 27R at 18:25, bound for New York JFK Airport and then Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport Contrary to many popular accounts of the disaster (though repeated, with reference, below), the flight, which had a scheduled gate departure time of 18:00, left Heathrow airport on time [18] [19]\n\n\nDeparture\nOn its arrival at Heathrow Terminal 3 on the day of the disaster, the passengers and their luggage (as well as an unaccompanied suitcase which was part of the interline luggage on the feeder flight) were transferred directly to Clipper Maid of the Seas, a Boeing 747-100 with the registration N739PA whose previous flight had originated from Los Angeles and arrived via San Francisco as flight PA 124, landing at 12 noon and parking at Gate K-14 [17] The plane, which operated the flight's transatlantic leg, pushed back from the terminal at 18:04 and took off from runway 27R at 18:25, bound for New York JFK Airport and then Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport Contrary to many popular accounts of the disaster (though repeated, with reference, below), the flight, which had a scheduled gate departure time of 18:00, left Heathrow airport on time [18] [19]\n\n\nLoss of contact\nAt 18:58, the aircraft established two-way radio contact with Shanwick Oceanic Area Control in Prestwick on 123.95 MHz.\n\n\nDisintegration of aircraft\nThe explosion punched a 50 cm (20 in) hole on the left side of the fuselage Investigators from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) concluded that no emergency procedures had been started in the cockpit [24] The CVR, located in the tail section of the aircraft, was found in a field by police searchers within 24 hours No distress call was recorded; a 180-millisecond hissing noise could be heard as the explosion destroyed the aircraft's communications center [25] The explosion in the aircraft hold was magnified by the uncontrolled decompression of the fuselage – a large difference in pressure between the aircraft's interior and exterior The aircraft's elevator- and rudder-control cables had been disrupted and the fuselage pitched downwards and to the left [26]\n\n\nFuselage impact\nThe fuselage continued moving forward and down until it reached 19,000 ft (5,800 m), when its dive became nearly vertical [22]: 44  Due to the extreme flutter, the vertical stabilizer disintegrated, which in turn produced large yawing movements As the forward fuselage continued to disintegrate, the flying debris tore off both of the horizontal stabilizers, while the rear fuselage, the remaining three engines, and the fin torque box separated [24] The rear fuselage, parts of the baggage hold, and three landing gear units landed at Rosebank Crescent [22]: 44  The fuselage consisting of the main wing box structure landed in Sherwood Crescent, destroying three homes and creating a large impact crater The 200,000 lb (91,000 kg) of jet fuel ignited by the impact started fires, which destroyed several additional houses [22]: 4  Investigators determined that both wings had landed in the Sherwood Crescent crater, saying, \"the total absence of debris from the wing primary structure found remote from the crater confirmed the initial impression that the complete wing box structure had been present at the main impact.\" [22]: 16 \n\n\nVictims\nAll 243 passengers and 16 crew members were killed, as were 11 residents of Lockerbie on the ground Of the 270 total fatalities, 190 were American citizens and 43 were British citizens Nineteen other nationalities were represented, with four or fewer passengers per country [10] [27]\n\n\nCrew\nFlight 103 was under the command of Captain James B MacQuarrie (55), a Pan Am pilot since 1964 with almost 11,000 flight hours, of which over 4,000 had been accrued in 747 aircraft He previously served three years in the U.S Navy and five years in the Massachusetts Air National Guard, where he held the rank of major First Officer Raymond R Wagner (52), a pilot with Pan Am since 1966 with almost 5,500 hours in the 747 and a total of nearly 12,000 hours, had previously served eight years in the New Jersey National Guard Flight Engineer Jerry D Avritt (46), who joined Pan Am in 1980 after 13 years with National Airlines, had more than 8,000 hours of flying time, with nearly 500 hours in the 747 The cockpit crew was based at John F Kennedy International Airport [22]\n\n\nPassengers\nThirty-five of the passengers were students from Syracuse University, who participated in the university's Division of International Programs Abroad (abbreviated as \"DIPA Program\" and renamed to \"Syracuse University Abroad\" in 2006, while also known as \"Syracuse Abroad\" and \"Study Abroad Program\") and were returning home for Christmas following a semester in Syracuse's London and European campuses Ten of these students were from other universities and colleges (including but not limited to Colgate University and University of Colorado) having collaborative relationships with Syracuse  Several of the students were due to connect to Pan Am Express Flight 4919 to Syracuse Hancock International Airport at JFK Airport later that evening.\n\n\nSyracuse University students\nThirty-five of the passengers were students from Syracuse

Pan Am Express Flight 4919 to Syracuse Hancock International Airport at JFK Airport later that evening.\n\n\nNotable passengers\nProminent among the passenger victims was the 50-year-old UN Commissioner for Namibia (then South West Africa), Bernt Carlsson, who would have attended the signing ceremony of the New York Accords at the UN headquarters the following day [30] James Fuller, CEO of Volkswagen of America, was returning home together with marketing director Lou Marengo from a meeting with Volkswagen executives in Germany [31] Also aboard were Irish Olympic sailor Peter Dix, [32] rock musician Paul Jeffreys and his wife, Rachel Jeffreys (née Jones) [33] [34] Dr Irving Sigal, a molecular biologist [35] and Jonathan White, 33, an American accountant, son of David White, American actor who played Larry Tate on “Bewitched.”\n\n\nUS government officials\nAboard the flight were Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) Special Agents Daniel Emmett O'Connor and Ronald Albert Lariviere [36] [37] Matthew Gannon, the Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) deputy station chief in Beirut, Lebanon, was sitting in seat 14J, which was located in the business class (branded as \"Clipper Class\") cabin [38] A group of US intelligence specialists was on board the flight Their presence gave rise to speculations and conspiracy theories that one or more of them had been targeted [39]\n\n\nLockerbie residents\nEleven Lockerbie residents on Sherwood Crescent were killed when the wing section hit the house at 13 Sherwood Crescent at more than 800 km/h (500 mph) and exploded, creating a crater 47 m (154 ft) long and with a volume of 560 m3 (20,000 cu ft; 730 cu yd) [22] The property was completely destroyed and its two occupants were killed Their bodies were never found Several other houses and their foundations were destroyed, and 21 others were damaged beyond repair.\n\n\nPrior alerts\nTwo alerts were released shortly before the bombing.\n\n\nHelsinki warning\nOn 5 December 1988 (16 days prior to the attack), the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a security bulletin saying that, on that day, a man with an Arabic accent had telephoned the US Embassy in  Helsinki, Finland, and told them that a Pan Am flight from Frankfurt to the United States would be blown up within the next two weeks by someone associated with the Abu Nidal Organization; he said a Finnish woman would carry the bomb on board as an unwitting courier [46]\n\n\nPLO's warning\nJust days before the bombing, security forces in European countries, including the UK, were put on alert after a warning from the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) that extremists might launch terrorist attacks to undermine the then-ongoing dialogue between the United States and the PLO [50]\n\n\nClaims of responsibility\nOn the day of the bombing, the French Directorate-General for External Security was informed by their British counterpart MI6 that the UK suspected the Libyans to be behind the bombing [51]\n\n\nInvestigation\nThe initial investigation into the crash site by Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary involved many helicopter surveys, satellite imaging, and a search of the area by police and soldiers The wreckage of the crash was scattered over 2,000 square kilometres (770 sq mi), and AAIB investigators were confronted by a massive jigsaw puzzle in trying to piece the plane back together In total, 4 million pieces of wreckage were collected and registered on computer files More than 10,000 pieces of debris were retrieved, tagged, and entered into a computer tracking system The perpetrators had apparently intended the plane to crash into the sea, destroying any traceable evidence, but  its explosion over land left a trail of evidence [62]\n\n\nCivil investigation\nThe initial investigation into the crash site by Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary involved many helicopter surveys, satellite imaging, and a search of the area by police and soldiers The wreckage of the crash was scattered over 2,000 square kilometres (770 sq mi), and AAIB investigators were confronted by a massive jigsaw puzzle in trying to piece the plane back together In total,

sea, destroying any traceable evidence, but  its explosion over land left a trail of evidence [62]\n\n\nWitnesses\nThe clothes were traced to a Maltese merchant, Tony Gauci, who became a key prosecution witness, testifying that he sold the clothes to a man of Libyan appearance Gauci was interviewed 23 times, giving contradictory evidence about who had bought the clothes, that person's age and appearance, and the date of purchase, but later identified Abdelbaset al-Megrahi As Megrahi had only been in Malta on 7 December, that date was assumed to be the purchase date This date is in doubt, as Gauci had testified that Malta's Christmas lights had not been on when the clothes had been purchased; the lights were later found to have been switched on on 6 December Scottish police had also failed to inform the defense that another witness had testified seeing Libyan men making a similar purchase on a different day [63] An official report, providing information not made available to the defense during the original trial, stated that on 19 April 1999, four days before identifying al-Megrahi for the first time, Gauci had seen a picture of al-Megrahi in a magazine that connected him to the bombing, a fact that could have distorted his judgement [64] Gauci was shown the same magazine during his testimony at al-Megrahi's trial and asked if he had identified the photograph in April 1999 as being the person who purchased the clothing; he was then asked if that person was in the court Gauci then identified al-Megrahi for the court, stating, \"He is the man on this side He resembles him a lot\" [65]\n\n\nCriminal inquiry\nKnown as the Lockerbie bombing and the Lockerbie air disaster in the UK, it was described by Scotland's Lord Advocate as the UK's largest criminal inquiry led by the smallest police force in Britain, Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary [68]\n\n\nAftermath\nFollowing the bombing, as information emerged that warnings had been received, many people, both relatives of the victims as well as the general public, were outraged at the FAA and airlines for not disclosing information Frustrated with a lack of accountability from government officials and agencies, the families of the victims created a lobbyist/support group known as \"The Victims of Pan AmFlight 103\" This group, with the support of United States Senator Alfonse D'Amato of New York, in hearings before the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, offered the group's prepared statement for inclusion in the record of the hearings [75]\n\n\nTrial, appeals, and release\nOn 3 May 2000, the trial of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah began Megrahi was found guilty of 270 counts of murder on 31 January 2001, and was sentenced to life imprisonment in Scotland; his co-defendant, Fhimah, was found not guilty [76]\n\n\nAppeal\nThe defense team had 14 days in which to appeal against Megrahi's conviction, and an additional six weeks to submit the full grounds of the appeal These were considered by a judge sitting in private who decided to grant Megrahi leave to appeal The only basis for an appeal under Scots law is that  a \"miscarriage of justice\" had occurred, which is not defined in statute, so  the appeal court must determine the meaning of these words in each case [78] Because three judges and one alternate judge had presided over the trial, five judges were required to preside over the Court of Criminal Appeal: Lord Cullen, Lord Justice-General, Lord Kirkwood, Lord Osborne, Lord Macfadyen, and Lord Nimmo Smith.\n\n\nSCCRC review\nMegrahi's lawyers applied to the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) on 23 September 2003 to have his case referred back to the Court of Criminal Appeal for a fresh appeal against conviction The application to the SCCRC followed the publication of two reports in February 2001 and March 2002 by Hans Köchler, who had been an international observer at Camp Zeist, appointed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations Köchler described the decisions of the trial and appeal courts as a \"spectacular miscarriage of justice\" [80] Köchler also issued a series of statements in 2003, 2005, and 2007 calling for an independent international inquiry into the case and accusing the West of \"double standards in criminal justice\" in relation to the Lockerbie trial on the one hand and the HIV trial in Libya on the other [81] [82] [83]\n\n\nSecond appeal\nA procedural hearing at the Appeal Court took place on 11 October 2007 when prosecution lawyers and Megrahi's defense counsel, Maggie Scott QC, discussed a number of legal issues with a panel of three judges [88] One of the issues concerned a number of documents that were shown before the trial to the prosecution, but were not disclosed to the defense The documents are understood to relate to the Mebo MST-13 timer that allegedly detonated the PA103 bomb [89] Maggie Scott also asked for documents relating to an alleged payment of $2 million made to Maltese merchant, Tony Gauci, for his testimony at the trial, which led to the conviction of Megrahi [90]\n\n\nCompassionate release and controversy\nOn 25 July 2009, Megrahi applied to be released from jail on compassionate grounds [94] Three weeks later, on 12 August 2009, Megrahi applied to have his second appeal dropped and was granted compassionate release for his terminal prostate cancer [95] [96] On 20 August 2009, Megrahi was released from prison and traveled by chartered jet to Libya [97] [98] [99]\nHis survival beyond the approximate \"three-month\" prognosis generated some controversy It is believed that, following his release, Al-Megrahi was prescribed abiraterone and prednisone, a combination that extends median survival by an average of 14.8 months After hospital treatment ended, he returned to his family home Following his release, Megrahi published evidence on the Internet that was gathered for the abandoned second appeal which he claimed would clear his name [100]\n\n\n2020 indictment\nIn 2020, US authorities indicted Libyan national Abu Agila Mohammad Mas'ud Kheir Al-Marimi for participating in the bombing [105] In December 2022, the United States government obtained custody of 71-year-old Mas'ud [106] [107]\n\n\nAlleged motives\nUntil 2002, Libya had never formally admitted to carrying out the 1988 Lockerbie bombing On 16 August 2003, Libya formally admitted responsibility for Pan Am Flight 103 in a letter presented to the president of the United Nations Security Council Felicity Barringer of The New York Times said that the letter had \"general language that lacked any expression of remorse\" for the people killed in the bombing [111] The letter stated that it \"accepted responsibility for the actions of its officials\" [112]\n\n\nLibya\nUntil 2002, Libya had never formally admitted to carrying out the 1988 Lockerbie bombing On 16 August 2003, Libya formally admitted responsibility for Pan Am Flight 103 in a letter presented to the president of the United Nations Security Council Felicity Barringer of The New York Times said that the letter had \"general language that lacked any expression of remorse\" for the people killed in the bombing [111] The letter stated that it \"accepted responsibility for the actions of its officials\" [112]\n\n\nDemands for independent inquiry\nPrior to the abandonment of Megrahi's second appeal against conviction and while new evidence could be still tested in court, there had been few calls for an independent inquiry into the Lockerbie bombing Demands for such an inquiry emerged later, and became more insistent On 2 September 2009, former MEP Michael McGowan demanded that the UK government call for an urgent, independent inquiry led by the UN to find out the truth about Pan Am flight 103 \"We owe it to the families of the victims of Lockerbie and the international community to identify those responsible,\" McGowan said [122] Two online petitions were started: one calling for a UK public inquiry into the Lockerbie bombing; [123] the other a UN inquiry into the murder of UN Commissioner for Namibia, Bernt Carlsson, in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing In September 2009, a third petition which was addressed to the President of the United Nations General Assembly demanded that the UN should \"institute a full public inquiry\" into the Lockerbie disaster [124]\n\n\nClaims of Gaddafi involvement\nOn 23 February 2011, amidst the Libyan Civil War, Mustafa Abdul Jalil, former Libyan Justice Minister (and later member and Chairman of the anti-Gaddafi National Transitional Council), alleged that he had evidence that Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi, had personally ordered Abdelbaset al-Megrahi to bomb Pan Am Flight 103 [130] [131]\n\n\nAlternative theories\nBased on a 1995 investigation by journalists Paul Foot and John Ashton, alternative explanations of the plot to commit the Lockerbie bombing were listed by The Guardian's Patrick Barkham in 1999 [133] Following the Lockerbie verdict in 2001 and the appeal in 2002, attempts have been made to re-open the case amid allegations that Libya was framed One theory suggests the bomb on the plane was detonated by radio Another theory suggests the CIA prevented the suitcase containing the bomb from being searched Iran's involvement is alleged, either in association with a Palestine militant group, or in loading the bomb while the plane was at Heathrow The US Defense Intelligence Agency alleges that Ali Akbar Mohtashamipur (Ayatollah Mohtashemi), a member of the Iranian government, paid US$10 million for the bombing:\n\n\nPCAST statement\nOn 29 September 1989, President Bush appointed Ann McLaughlin Korologos, former Secretary of Labor, to chair the President's Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism (PCAST) to review and report on aviation security policy in the light of the sabotage of flight PA103 Oliver Revell, the FBI's Executive Assistant Director, was assigned to advise and assist PCAST in their task [138]\n\n\nCompensation\nOn 29 May 2002, Libya offered up to US$2.7 billion to settle claims by the families of the 270 killed in the Lockerbie bombing, representing US$10 million per family The Libyan offer was that 40% of the money would be released when United Nations sanctions, suspended in 1999, were canceled; another 40% when US trade sanctions were lifted; and the final 20% when the US State Department removed Libya from its list of states sponsoring terrorism [140] [141]\n\n\nFrom Libya\nOn 29 May 2002, Libya offered up to US$2.7 billion to settle claims by the families of the 270 killed in the Lockerbie bombing, representing US$10 million per family The Libyan offer was that 40% of the money would be released when United Nations sanctions, suspended in 1999, were canceled; another 40% when US trade sanctions were lifted; and the final 20% when the US State Department removed Libya from its list of states sponsoring terrorism [140] [141]\n\n\nFebruary 2011\nIn an interview with Swedish newspaper Expressen on 23 February 2011, Mustafa Abdul Jalil, former Justice Secretary of Libya, claimed to have evidence that Gaddafi personally ordered Al-Megrahi to carry out the bombing [130]\n\n\nContingency fees for lawyers\nOn 5 December 2003, Jim Kreindler revealed that his Park Avenue law firm would receive an initial contingency fee of around US$1 million from each of the 128 American families Kreindler represents The firm's fees could exceed US$300 million eventually Kreindler argued that the fees were justified, since \"Over the past seven years we have had a dedicated team working tirelessly on this and we deserve the contingency fee we have worked so hard for, and I think we have provided the relatives with value for money.\" [144]\n\n\nFrom Pan Am\nIn 1992, a US federal court found Pan Am guilty of willful misconduct due to lax security screening caused by failure to implement baggage reconciliation, a new security program mandated by the FAA prior to the incident, which requires unaccompanied luggage to be searched by hand and to ensure passengers board flights onto which they have checked baggage; Pan Am relied more on the less-effective method of x-ray screening Two of Pan Am's subsidiaries, Alert Management Inc., which handled Pan Am's security at foreign airports, and Pan American World Services, were also found guilty [160]\n\n\nMemorials and tributes\nThere are several private and public memorials to the PA103 victims Dark Elegy is the work of sculptor Suse Lowenstein of Long Island, whose son Alexander, then 21, was a passenger on the flight The work consists of 43 nude statues of the wives and mothers who lost a husband or a child Inside each sculpture there is a personal memento of the victim [161]\n\n\nUnited States\nOn 3 November 1995, then-U.S President Bill Clinton dedicated a Memorial Cairn to the victims at Arlington National Cemetery, [162] and there are similar memorials at Syracuse University; Dryfesdale Cemetery, near Lockerbie; and in Sherwood Crescent, Lockerbie [163]\n\n\nThe Women of Lockerbie\nThe Women of Lockerbie (2003) is a play written by Deborah Brevoort which depicts a woman from New Jersey roaming the hills of Lockerbie, Scotland  This mother tragically lost her son in the bombing of the Pan Am Flight 103  While in Lockerbie, 7 years after the flight, she meets the women who witnessed and were affected by the crash itself while she attempts to find closure [170] This play has received the Silver Medal from the Onassis International Playwriting Competition and the  Kennedy Center Fund for New American Plays award [171]\n\n\nLockerbie\nThe main UK memorial is at Dryfesdale Cemetery about one mile (1.5 kilometres) west of Lockerbie There is a semicircular stone wall in the garden of remembrance with the names and nationalities of all the victims along with individual funeral stones and memorials Inside the chapel at Dryfesdale there is a book of remembrance There are memorials in Lockerbie and Moffat Roman Catholic churches, where plaques list the names of all 270 victims In Lockerbie Town Hall Council Chambers, there is a stained-glass window depicting flags of the 21 countries whose citizens lost their lives in the disaster There is also a book of remembrance at Lockerbie public library and another at Tundergarth Church [172] [173] In Sherwood Crescent there is a garden of remembrance to the seven Lockerbie residents killed when the aircraft's main wreckage fell there, destroying their homes [174]\n\n\nWreckage of the aircraft\nThe Air Accidents Investigation Branch reassembled a large part of the fuselage to aid with the investigation;

elder son of George Bingham, 6th Earl of Lucan, an Anglo-Irish peer, and his wife, Kaitlin Elizabeth Anne Dawson John was the great-great-grandson of George Bingham, 3rd Earl of Lucan, who led the Charge of the Light Brigade A blood clot found in his mother's lung forced her to remain in a nursing home, so John, as he became known, was initially cared for by the family's nurserymaid, Lucy Sellers Aged three years, John attended a pre-prep school in Tite Street with his elder sister Jane In 1939, with the Second World War approaching, the two were taken to the relative safety of Wales [6] [7]\n\n\nCareer\nOn leaving the British Army in 1954, Lucan joined William Brandt's Sons and Co., a London-based merchant bank, on an annual salary of £500 [7] In 1960 he met Stephen Raphael, a rich stockbroker who was a skilled backgammon player [nb 3] They holidayed together in the Bahamas, went water-skiing, and played golf, backgammon and poker [13] Lucan became a regular gambler and an early member of John Aspinall's Clermont gaming club, located in Berkeley Square [14]\n\n\nPersonal life\nLucan met his future wife, Veronica Duncan, early in 1963 [18] She was born in 1937 to Major Charles Moorhouse Duncan and his wife, Thelma Veronica's father had died in a car accident when she was young, after which the family moved to South Africa Her mother remarried, and her family returned to England, where her new stepfather became manager of a hotel in Guildford With her sister, Christina, she was educated at St Swithun's School, Winchester [19]\n\n\nMarriage and lifestyle\nLucan met his future wife, Veronica Duncan, early in 1963 [18] She was born in 1937 to Major Charles Moorhouse Duncan and his wife, Thelma Veronica's father had died in a car accident when she was young, after which the family moved to South Africa Her mother remarried, and her family returned to England, where her new stepfather became manager of a hotel in Guildford With her sister, Christina, she was educated at St Swithun's School, Winchester [19]\n\n\nSeparation\nSome months later Lucan moved again, to a larger rented flat in nearby Elizabeth Street Despite an early attempt by his wife at reconciliation, by that point all Lucan wanted from the marriage was custody of his children In an effort to demonstrate that Veronica was unfit to look after them, Lucan began to spy on his family (his car was regularly seen parked in Lower Belgrave Street), later employing private detectives to perform the same task He also canvassed doctors, who explained that his wife had not \"gone mad\", but was suffering from depression and anxiety [37]\n\n\nGambling\nLosing the court case proved devastating for Lucan It had cost him an estimated £20,000, and by late 1974 his financial position was dire As he drank more heavily and started chain-smoking, his friends began to worry [49] In drunken conversations with some of them, including Aspinall and his mother Lady Osborne, Lucan discussed murdering his wife Greville Howard later gave a statement to the police describing how Lucan had talked of how killing his wife might save him from bankruptcy, how her body might be disposed of in the Solent and how he \"would never be caught\" [50] [51] [52] [nb 5]\n\n\nMurder of Sandra Rivett\nSandra Eleanor Rivett was born on 16 September 1945, the third child of Albert and Eunice Hensby The family moved to Australia when she was two years old, but returned in 1955 Sandra was a popular child, described at school as \"intelligent, although she does not excel academically\" [63]

academically\" [63] She worked for six months as an apprentice hairdresser before taking a job as a secretary in Croydon [64]\n\n\nInvestigation\nBy the time Detective Chief Superintendent Roy Ranson arrived at Lower Belgrave Street early on 8 November, the divisional surgeon had pronounced Rivett dead, and forensic officers and photographers had been called to the property Other than the front door, which the first two officers on the scene had kicked in, there was no sign of a forced entry A bloodstained towel was found in Veronica's first-floor bedroom The area around the top of the basement staircase was heavily bloodstained [73] [74]\n\n\nForensic science\nThe scientific examination of the lead pipes found at the murder scene and in the Corsair's boot revealed traces of blood on the pipe from 46 Lower Belgrave Street This proved to be a mixture of Lady Lucan's (blood group A) and Rivett's (B) blood Hair belonging to Lady Lucan was also found on that pipe, but none belonging to Rivett The pipe found inside the Corsair had neither blood nor hair on it Home Office scientists were unable to prove conclusively that both pipes were cut from the same, longer, piece of piping, although they thought it likely [92]\n\n\nMedia reaction\nBy the afternoon of 8 November, the newspapers' early editions carried photographs of the Lucans across their front pages, accompanied by headlines like \"Body in sack .. countess runs out screaming\", and \"Belgravia murder – earl sought\" [93] A meeting that day at the Clermont between Aspinall, Meinertzhagen, Kydd, Elwes, Charles Benson, and Stephen Raphael became the cause of much press speculation Meinertzhagen and Raphael later insisted that the gathering was just a rational discussion between concerned friends, keen to share anything they knew about what had happened, but the relationship between the Metropolitan Police and Lucan's social circle was strained; some officers complained that an \"Eton mafia\" worked against them [94]\n\n\nInquest\nThe inquest into Sandra Rivett's death opened on 13 November 1974 and was led by the coroner for inner west London, Gavin Thurston Two witnesses were called to the courtroom, which was packed with reporters; Roger Rivett, who confirmed that he had identified his wife's body, and the pathologist Keith Simpson, who confirmed that Rivett had died from being hit on the head with a blunt instrument At Ranson's request, the hearing was then adjourned Further adjournments were made on 11 December 1974 and 10 March 1975, before a full inquest was scheduled for 16 June 1975 [103] [nb 6]\n\n\nLucan's defence\nLucan's friends and family were critical of the inquest, which they felt offered a one-sided view of events His mother told reporters that it did not serve \"any useful purpose at all\" [119] Veronica's sister, Christina, said that she felt \"great sadness and sorrow\" [120] at the verdict Susan Maxwell-Scott continued to press the earl's claims of innocence and claimed to feel \"awfully sorry\" [120] for the countess.\n\n\nBankruptcy and estate\nBe it known that the Right Honourable Richard John Bingham, Seventh Earl of Lucan, of 72a Elizabeth Street, London SW1, died on or since the 8th day of November 1974.\n\n\nAftermath and developments\n\"He was not pronounced dead so we could pay for the children's education, that was the reason it took so long If his body was found my son would have been the Earl of Lucan and we would have to pay death duties We would not have been able to pay for the children's education They were only four, seven and 10 so there was a lot of time ahead.\"\n\n\nDramatisations\nThe 1994 alternative history TV film The Trial of Lord Lucan, starring Julian Wadham as Lord Lucan, Lynsey Baxter as Lady Lucan

Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan**\n\nThe life and death of John Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan, was marked by controversy, tragedy, and mystery. Born on December 18, 1934, in London, England, he was the second child and elder son of George Bingham, 6th Earl of Lucan, an Anglo-Irish peer, and his wife, Kaitlin Elizabeth Anne Dawson. John's family had a long history of nobility, dating back to the 18th century, with his great-great-grandfather, George Bingham, 3rd Earl of Lucan, leading the Charge of the Light Brigade during the Crimean War.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nJohn's early life was marked by turmoil, as his mother suffered from a blood clot in her lung, which forced her to remain in a nursing home. As a result, John was initially cared for by the family's nurserymaid, Lucy Sellers. At the age of three, John attended a pre-prep school in Tite Street with his elder sister, Jane. However, as the Second World War approached, the two siblings were taken to the relative safety of Wales in 1939.\n\n**Career**\n\nAfter leaving the British Army in 1954, Lucan joined William Brandt's Sons and Co., a London-based merchant bank, on an annual salary of £500. It was during this time that he developed a passion for high-stakes poker and became a regular member of John Aspinall's Clermont gaming club, located in Berkeley Square. Lucan's love of gaming and his association with the Clermont club would later become a significant factor in his downfall.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nIn 1963, Lucan met his future wife, Veronica Duncan, a beautiful and charming woman from a wealthy family. The two were introduced by a mutual friend, and Lucan was immediately smitten. However, their marriage was marked by tension and conflict, with Lucan becoming increasingly possessive and controlling.\n\n**Marriage and Lifestyle**\n\nLucan and Veronica's marriage was a whirlwind romance, with the couple spending their days attending high-society parties and events. However, behind the scenes, Lucan's behavior became increasingly erratic, with reports of him spying on his wife and her family. The marriage was marked by a deep-seated insecurity, which Lucan struggled to overcome.\n\n**Separation**\n\nIn 1973, Lucan's behavior became more and more erratic, with him beginning to suspect that Veronica was having an affair. The couple's marriage was on the rocks, and Lucan became obsessed with the idea of gaining custody of their children. He began to spy on Veronica and her family, employing private detectives to gather evidence.\n\n**Gambling**\n\nAs the marriage began to unravel, Lucan's love of high-stakes poker became a major problem. He lost vast sums of money at the Clermont club, and his financial situation became increasingly dire. In 1974, he was declared bankrupt, with debts of over £1 million.

Charge of the Light Brigade A blood clot found in his mother's lung forced her to remain in a nursing home, so John, as he became known, was initially cared for by the family's nurserymaid, Lucy Sellers Aged three years, John attended a pre-prep school in Tite Street with his elder sister Jane In 1939, with the Second World War approaching, the two were taken to the relative safety of Wales [6] [7]\n\n\nCareer\nOn leaving the British Army in 1954, Lucan joined William Brandt's Sons and Co., a London-based merchant bank, on an annual salary of £500 [7] In 1960 he met Stephen Raphael, a rich stockbroker who was a skilled backgammon player [nb 3] They holidayed together in the Bahamas, went water-skiing, and played golf, backgammon and poker [13] Lucan became a regular gambler and an early member of John Aspinall's Clermont gaming club, located in Berkeley Square [14]\n\n\nPersonal life\nLucan met his future wife, Veronica Duncan, early in 1963 [18] She was born in 1937 to Major Charles Moorhouse Duncan and his wife, Thelma Veronica's father had died in a car accident when she was young, after which the family moved to South Africa Her mother remarried, and her family returned to England, where her new stepfather became manager of a hotel in Guildford With her sister, Christina, she was educated at St Swithun's School, Winchester [19]\n\n\nMarriage and lifestyle\nLucan met his future wife, Veronica Duncan, early in 1963 [18] She was born in 1937 to Major Charles Moorhouse Duncan and his wife, Thelma Veronica's father had died in a car accident when she was young, after which the family moved to South Africa Her mother remarried, and her family returned to England, where her new stepfather became manager of a hotel in Guildford With her sister, Christina, she was educated at St Swithun's School, Winchester [19]\n\n\nSeparation\nSome months later Lucan moved again, to a larger rented flat in nearby Elizabeth Street Despite an early attempt by his wife at reconciliation, by that point all Lucan wanted from the marriage was custody of his children In an effort to demonstrate that Veronica was unfit to look after them, Lucan began to spy on his family (his car was regularly seen parked in Lower Belgrave Street), later employing private detectives to perform the same task He also canvassed doctors, who explained that his wife had not \"gone mad\", but was suffering from depression and anxiety [37]\n\n\nGambling\nLosing the court case proved devastating for Lucan It had cost him an estimated £20,000, and by late 1974 his financial position was dire As he drank more heavily and started chain-smoking, his friends began to worry [49] In drunken conversations with some of them, including Aspinall and his mother Lady Osborne, Lucan discussed murdering his wife Greville Howard later gave a statement to the police describing how Lucan had talked of how killing his wife might save him from bankruptcy, how her body might be disposed of in the Solent and how he \"would never be caught\" [50] [51] [52] [nb 5]\n\n\nMurder of Sandra Rivett\nSandra Eleanor Rivett was born on 16 September 1945, the third child of Albert and Eunice Hensby The family moved to Australia when she was two years old, but returned in 1955 Sandra was a popular child, described at school as \"intelligent, although she does not excel academically\" [63] She worked for six months as an apprentice hairdresser before taking a job as a secretary in Croydon [64]\n\n\nSandra Rivett\nSandra Eleanor Rivett was born on 16 September 1945, the third child of Albert and Eunice Hensby The family moved to Australia when she was two years old, but returned in 1955 Sandra was a popular child, described at school as \"intelligent, although she does not excel academically\" [63] She worked for six months as an apprentice hairdresser before taking a job as a secretary in Croydon [64]\n\n\nInvestigation\nBy the time Detective Chief Superintendent Roy Ranson arrived at Lower Belgrave Street early on 8 November, the divisional surgeon had pronounced Rivett dead, and forensic officers and photographers had been called to the property Other than the front door, which the first two officers on the scene had kicked in, there was no sign of a forced entry A bloodstained towel was found in Veronica's first-floor bedroom The area around the top of the basement staircase was heavily bloodstained [73] [74]\n\n\nForensic science\nThe scientific examination of the lead pipes found at the murder scene and in the Corsair's boot revealed traces of blood on the pipe from 46 Lower Belgrave Street This proved to be a mixture of Lady Lucan's (blood group A) and Rivett's (B) blood Hair belonging to Lady Lucan was also found on that pipe, but none belonging to Rivett The pipe found inside the Corsair had neither blood nor hair on it Home Office scientists were unable to prove conclusively that both pipes were cut from the same, longer, piece of piping, although they thought it likely [92]\n\n\nMedia reaction\nBy the afternoon of 8 November, the newspapers' early editions carried photographs of the Lucans across their front pages, accompanied by headlines like \"Body in sack .. countess runs out screaming\", and \"Belgravia murder – earl sought\" [93] A meeting that day at the Clermont between Aspinall, Meinertzhagen, Kydd, Elwes, Charles Benson, and Stephen Raphael became the cause of much press speculation Meinertzhagen and Raphael later insisted that the gathering was just a rational discussion between concerned friends, keen to share anything they knew about what had happened, but the relationship between the Metropolitan Police and Lucan's social circle was strained; some officers complained that an \"Eton mafia\" worked against them [94]\n\n\nInquest\nThe inquest into Sandra Rivett's death opened on 13 November 1974 and was led by the coroner for inner west London, Gavin Thurston Two witnesses were called to the courtroom, which was packed with reporters; Roger Rivett, who confirmed that he had identified his wife's body, and the pathologist Keith Simpson, who confirmed that Rivett had died from being hit on the head with a blunt instrument At Ranson's request, the hearing was then adjourned Further adjournments were made on 11 December 1974 and 10 March 1975, before a full inquest was scheduled for 16 June 1975 [103] [nb 6]\n\n\nLucan's defence\nLucan's friends and family were critical of the inquest, which they felt offered a one-sided view of events His mother told reporters that it did not serve \"any useful purpose at all\" [119] Veronica's sister, Christina, said that she felt \"great sadness and sorrow\" [120] at the verdict Susan Maxwell-Scott continued to press the earl's claims of innocence and claimed to feel \"awfully sorry\" [120] for the countess.\n\n\nBankruptcy and estate\nBe it known that the Right Honourable Richard John Bingham, Seventh Earl of Lucan, of 72a Elizabeth Street, London SW1, died on or since the 8th day of November 1974.\n\n\nAftermath and developments\n\"He was not pronounced dead so we could pay for the children's education, that was the reason it took so long If his body was found my son would have been the Earl of Lucan and we would have to pay death duties We would not have been able to pay for the children's education They were only four, seven and 10 so there was a lot of time ahead.\"\n\n\nDramatisations\nThe 1994 alternative history TV film The Trial of Lord Lucan, starring Julian Wadham as Lord Lucan, Lynsey Baxter as Lady Lucan and Jan Ruppe as Sandra Rivett, depicts what might have happened if Lucan had been arrested in Newhaven and stood trial for Rivett's murder [168]\n\n\nSee

It's Devo (1982), which brought the band controversy because the lyrics were taken directly from a poem written by Hinckley [79] Hinckley has claimed that he has not received royalties for the use of his poem by them [80]\n\n\nSongwriting, performance, and art\nAs a young adult, Hinckley made unsuccessful efforts to become a songwriter Years later, he posted music online anonymously but received little interest [91] In October 2020, a federal court ruled that Hinckley may showcase and market his artwork, writings, and music publicly under his own name, but his treatment team could rescind the display privilege [92] Hinckley created a YouTube channel where, since December 2020, he has posted videos of himself performing original songs with a guitar and covers of songs such as \"Blowin' in the Wind\" by Bob Dylan, and the Elvis Presley song \"Can't Help Falling in Love\" [91] [93] His subscribers totaled over 40,000 by September 2024 [94]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Cuthbert's Society, Durham University, from 2005 to 2008 [4] [5] At the time of her death, Everard lived in the Brixton Hill area and worked as a marketing executive for a digital media agency [4] [6]

from 2005 to 2008 [4] [5] At the time of her death, Everard lived in the Brixton Hill area and worked as a marketing executive for a digital media agency [4] [6] [7]\n\n\nWayne Couzens\nWayne Couzens (born 20 December 1972 in Dover, Kent) [8] [9] was educated at Castlemount School, Dover [10] After taking GCSEs, [11]: 18  Couzens worked as a mechanic in his family's garage [12] He enlisted as a private with the Territorial Army in 2002, [11]: 21  and over the following four years he unsuccessfully applied to become a police officer on three occasions He was employed as a special constable with Kent Police in 2006, [11]: 24  and was discharged from the Territorial Army the following year for failing to fulfil training obligations [11]: 24 \n\n\nIncident and investigation\nOn 28 February 2021, Couzens booked a white Vauxhall Crossland [18] from a vehicle hire company in Dover [19] At 07:00 GMT on 3 March, [20] he completed a 12-hour shift at the US Embassy in London [21] before travelling to Kent to collect the hire car He then drove back to London where he was recorded as being in Earl's Court and on Battersea Bridge After arriving in Clapham, he again drove to Earl's Court before returning to Clapham at 21:23 [22]\n\n\nLegal proceedings\nOn 9 March 2021, [20] Couzens was arrested at his home in Deal [14] [16] on suspicion of kidnapping [25] Police arrived at his house at 17:45 and arrested Couzens at 19:47 [54] [55] Around 40 minutes before he was arrested, Couzens tried to wipe the data from his mobile phone [28] When interviewed, he claimed initially not to recognise Everard after being shown a photograph of her [56] He then claimed to be having financial problems after paying for sex in Folkestone, [31] and that a gang of Eastern Europeans had threatened him and his family, demanding he deliver \"another girl\" after underpaying a prostitute a few weeks before [57] A woman in her thirties was also arrested at the address on suspicion of assisting an offender [40] but subsequently released without charge [58]\n\n\nArrest of Wayne Couzens\nOn 9 March 2021, [20] Couzens was arrested at his home in Deal [14] [16] on suspicion of kidnapping [25] Police arrived at his house at 17:45 and arrested Couzens at 19:47 [54] [55] Around 40 minutes before he was arrested, Couzens tried to wipe the data from his mobile phone [28] When interviewed, he claimed initially not to recognise Everard after being shown a photograph of her [56] He then claimed to be having financial problems after paying for sex in Folkestone, [31] and that a gang of Eastern Europeans had threatened him and his family, demanding he deliver \"another girl\" after underpaying a prostitute a few weeks before [57] A woman in her thirties was also arrested at the address on suspicion of assisting an offender [40] but subsequently released without charge [58]\n\n\nGuilty plea\nOn 8 June 2021, Couzens pleaded guilty to kidnap and rape, and admitted responsibility for Everard's death [62] [63] Pending medical reports into his mental health at the time of Everard's death, Couzens did not enter a plea on the charge of murder [64] [65]\n\n\nSentencing and imprisonment\nThe sentencing hearing before Lord Justice Fulford, began at the Old Bailey on 29 September 2021 following medical and psychiatric reports [67] Couzens's barrister, Jim Sturman QC, asked Fulford to consider imposing a life sentence with a determinate tariff which would allow Couzens to become eligible for release on licence in his 80s [68] On 30 September, Couzens was sentenced to life imprisonment with a tariff of a whole life order, [27] with Fulford justifying the severity of the punishment by saying that Couzens's use of his position as a police officer to detain Everard was the \"vital factor which in my view makes the seriousness of this case exceptionally high\" [1]: 6 \n\n\nAngiolini Inquiry\nCouzens's crimes led to a non-statutory inquiry headed by Lady Elish Angiolini into how he was permitted to work as a police officer for three separate forces despite his behaviour causing concern [79] In February 2024, Angiolini's report said that Couzens had a history of alleged sexual offending, [11]: v  that he should never have been a police officer, and that multiple forces missed \"red flags\" during his vetting processes [11]: vi  The report said his crimes were \"the culmination of a trajectory of sexually motivated behaviour and offending\", [80] and made sixteen recommendations designed \"to ensure that everything possible is being done to prevent those entrusted with the power of the office of constable from abusing that power.\" [11]: vii \n\n\nResponses\nOn 11 March 2021, the Home Secretary, Priti Patel, released a statement saying that \"every woman should feel safe to walk on our streets without fear of harassment or violence\", [83] and Sadiq Khan stated that London streets are not safe for women or girls [84] Patel announced that new laws are being considered to protect women against sexual harassment in public, including the potential of making public harassment a specifically defined crime [85]\n\n\nRole of police\nThe case sparked debate surrounding the role of police in UK society and police violence [88] [89] [90] The police were criticised both for their crackdown on vigils for Everard during the COVID-19 lockdown and for their failure to prevent the murder: not only did Kent Police not take any action after an alleged incident of indecent exposure in 2015, [66] but Couzens had faced at least two other accusations of indecent exposure that had not been properly investigated and he had been involved in an incident in 2002 that was missed in his vetting [91] In early October 2021, it was reported that Couzens's colleagues had once been forced to call him back to the station from patrol after a prostitute had visited the station demanding money from him [92] In mid-October, it was reported that police were investigating claims that Couzens had sexually assaulted a drag queen at a pub in Deal in 2018 [93] Radio presenter Emma B also came forward to say that she had attempted to report Couzens in 2008, after he exposed himself to her in an alley in Greenwich, but that the police had laughed at her [94]\n\n\nWomen's safety\nThe case led to widespread debate about women's safety and violence against women in the UK [127] [128] [129] [130] After the murder, the British government reopened its public consultation on its violence against women and girls (VAWG) strategy, receiving an additional 160,000 responses in two weeks However, some feminist campaigners argued that not enough changed in the wake of the murder Andrea Simon of the End Violence Against Women Coalition stated that \"the measures that could make a difference and the resourcing are not where they need to be.\" [131] Reports of women killed by serving or former police officers in the UK since 2009 indicate that they are usually partners, unlike in this case [132] On 17 September 2021, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services published a report commissioned by the government after the murder, finding \"inconsistencies at every level in how the police respond to VAWG and victims\"\nand that there needed to be a \"radical refocus and shift in the priority given to VAWG offences\" [133] [134]\n\n\nVigils\nCountry-wide vigils to be held on Saturday, 13 March 2021 were organised by a newly formed campaign group, [140] Reclaim These Streets [141] The day before the vigils were due to take place, a message was sent to all police chiefs that made it clear that, because of the COVID risk, Patel wanted them to stop people gathering

Sarah Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive, was abducted and murdered by a serving police officer, Wayne Couzens, while walking home from a friend's house in Clapham, London.\n\n**Background**\n\nSarah Everard was born in Surrey in 1987. She grew up in York, where she attended Fulford School. She studied Human Geography at St Cuthbert's Society, Durham University, from 2005 to 2008. At the time of her death, Everard lived in the Brixton Hill area and worked as a marketing executive for a digital media agency.\n\n**Sarah Everard**\n\nSarah Everard was a bright and ambitious young woman who had her whole life ahead of her. She was a keen hiker and loved spending time outdoors. She was also a talented artist and enjoyed painting and drawing in her free time. Everard was known to be confident and independent, but also kind and compassionate towards others.\n\n**Wayne Couzens**\n\nWayne Couzens was a 49-year-old serving police officer who had been working for the Metropolitan Police Service since 2018. He was a trained firearms officer and had a reputation for being a friendly and approachable member of the community. However, Couzens had a history of inappropriate behavior, including allegations of indecent exposure and voyeurism.\n\n**Incident and Investigation**\n\nOn 28 February 2021, Couzens booked a white Vauxhall Crossland from a vehicle hire company in Dover. He then drove to London, where he completed a 12-hour shift at the US Embassy. After his shift, he drove to Kent, where he collected the hire car. He then drove back to London, where he was recorded as being in Earl's Court and on Battersea Bridge.

studied Human Geography at St Cuthbert's Society, Durham University, from 2005 to 2008 [4] [5] At the time of her death, Everard lived in the Brixton Hill area and worked as a marketing executive for a digital media agency [4] [6] [7]\n\n\nWayne Couzens\nWayne Couzens (born 20 December 1972 in Dover, Kent) [8] [9] was educated at Castlemount School, Dover [10] After taking GCSEs, [11]: 18  Couzens worked as a mechanic in his family's garage [12] He enlisted as a private with the Territorial Army in 2002, [11]: 21  and over the following four years he unsuccessfully applied to become a police officer on three occasions He was employed as a special constable with Kent Police in 2006, [11]: 24  and was discharged from the Territorial Army the following year for failing to fulfil training obligations [11]: 24 \n\n\nIncident and investigation\nOn 28 February 2021, Couzens booked a white Vauxhall Crossland [18] from a vehicle hire company in Dover [19] At 07:00 GMT on 3 March, [20] he completed a 12-hour shift at the US Embassy in London [21] before travelling to Kent to collect the hire car He then drove back to London where he was recorded as being in Earl's Court and on Battersea Bridge After arriving in Clapham, he again drove to Earl's Court before returning to Clapham at 21:23 [22]\n\n\nLegal proceedings\nOn 9 March 2021, [20] Couzens was arrested at his home in Deal [14] [16] on suspicion of kidnapping [25] Police arrived at his house at 17:45 and arrested Couzens at 19:47 [54] [55] Around 40 minutes before he was arrested, Couzens tried to wipe the data from his mobile phone [28] When interviewed, he claimed initially not to recognise Everard after being shown a photograph of her [56] He then claimed to be having financial problems after paying for sex in Folkestone, [31] and that a gang of Eastern Europeans had threatened him and his family, demanding he deliver \"another girl\" after underpaying a prostitute a few weeks before [57] A woman in her thirties was also arrested at the address on suspicion of assisting an offender [40] but subsequently released without charge [58]\n\n\nArrest of Wayne Couzens\nOn 9 March 2021, [20] Couzens was arrested at his home in Deal [14] [16] on suspicion of kidnapping [25] Police arrived at his house at 17:45 and arrested Couzens at 19:47 [54] [55] Around 40 minutes before he was arrested, Couzens tried to wipe the data from his mobile phone [28] When interviewed, he claimed initially not to recognise Everard after being shown a photograph of her [56] He then claimed to be having financial

weeks before [57] A woman in her thirties was also arrested at the address on suspicion of assisting an offender [40] but subsequently released without charge [58]\n\n\nGuilty plea\nOn 8 June 2021, Couzens pleaded guilty to kidnap and rape, and admitted responsibility for Everard's death [62] [63] Pending medical reports into his mental health at the time of Everard's death, Couzens did not enter a plea on the charge of murder [64] [65]\n\n\nSentencing and imprisonment\nThe sentencing hearing before Lord Justice Fulford, began at the Old Bailey on 29 September 2021 following medical and psychiatric reports [67] Couzens's barrister, Jim Sturman QC, asked Fulford to consider imposing a life sentence with a determinate tariff which would allow Couzens to become eligible for release on licence in his 80s [68] On 30 September, Couzens was sentenced to life imprisonment with a tariff of a whole life order, [27] with Fulford justifying the severity of the punishment by saying that Couzens's use of his position as a police officer to detain Everard was the \"vital factor which in my view makes the seriousness of this case exceptionally high\" [1]: 6 \n\n\nAngiolini Inquiry\nCouzens's crimes led to a non-statutory inquiry headed by Lady Elish Angiolini into how he was permitted to work as a police officer for three separate forces despite his behaviour causing concern [79] In February 2024, Angiolini's report said that Couzens had a history of alleged sexual offending, [11]: v  that he should never have been a police officer, and that multiple forces missed \"red flags\" during his vetting processes [11]: vi  The report said his crimes were \"the culmination of a trajectory of sexually motivated behaviour and offending\", [80] and made sixteen recommendations designed \"to ensure that everything possible is being done to prevent those entrusted with the power of the office of constable from abusing that power.\" [11]: vii \n\n\nResponses\nOn 11 March 2021, the Home Secretary, Priti Patel, released a statement saying that \"every woman should feel safe to walk on our streets without fear of harassment or violence\", [83] and Sadiq Khan stated that London streets are not safe for women or girls [84] Patel announced that new laws are being considered to protect women against sexual harassment in public, including the potential of making public harassment a specifically defined crime [85]\n\n\nRole of police\nThe case sparked debate surrounding the role of police in UK society and police violence [88] [89] [90] The police were criticised both for their crackdown on vigils for Everard during the COVID-19 lockdown and for their failure to prevent the murder: not only did Kent Police not take any action after an alleged incident of indecent exposure in 2015, [66] but Couzens had faced at least two other accusations of indecent exposure that had not been properly investigated and he had been involved in an incident in 2002 that was missed in his vetting [91] In early October 2021, it was reported that Couzens's colleagues had once been forced to call him back to the station from patrol after a prostitute had visited the station demanding money from him [92] In mid-October, it was reported that police were investigating claims that Couzens had sexually assaulted a drag queen at a pub in Deal in 2018 [93] Radio presenter Emma B also came forward to say that she had attempted to report Couzens in 2008, after he exposed himself to her in an alley in Greenwich, but that the police had laughed at her [94]\n\n\nWomen's safety\nThe case led to widespread debate about women's safety and violence against women in the UK [127] [128] [129] [130] After the murder, the British government reopened its public consultation on its violence against women and girls (VAWG) strategy, receiving an additional 160,000 responses in two weeks However, some feminist campaigners argued that not enough changed in the wake of the murder Andrea Simon of the End Violence Against Women Coalition stated that \"the measures that could make a difference and the resourcing are not where they need to be.\" [131] Reports of women killed by serving or former police officers in the UK since 2009 indicate that they are usually partners, unlike in this case [132] On 17 September 2021, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services published a report commissioned by the government after the murder, finding \"inconsistencies at every level in how the police respond to VAWG and victims\"\nand that there needed to be a \"radical refocus and shift in the priority given to VAWG offences\" [133] [134]\n\n\nVigils\nCountry-wide vigils to be held on Saturday, 13 March 2021 were organised by a newly formed campaign group, [140] Reclaim These Streets [141] The day before the vigils were due to take place, a message was sent to all police chiefs that made it clear that, because of the COVID risk, Patel wanted them to stop people gathering at vigils; she also promised she would personally urge people not to gather [142] Talks between organisers and police broke down; [141] [143] The police had advised the organisers that it would be considered an illegal gathering under COVID‑19 pandemic restrictions and the court refused a request to intervene in the police decision [144] Events planned for Edinburgh and Cardiff were officially cancelled in favour of online events [145] [146] Cambridge also was scheduled to go online [147]\n\n\nClapham Common vigil\nA

formed, however it dissipated the next day It was considered rare since the storm formation usually begins from mid-April to May After a month of inactivity, another depression formed off the coasts of Kerala and Lakshadweep It intensified into a deep depression on the same day and later into a cyclonic storm, being assigned the name Tauktae by the IMD It continued intensifying, and on May 17, Tauktae peaked as an extremely severe cyclonic storm before making landfall in Gujarat hours later, dissipating on May 19 A few days after Tauktae dissipated, a depression formed in the Bay of Bengal on May 23 It intensified gradually to a cyclonic storm and assigned the name Yaas It further intensified into a very severe cyclonic storm on May 25 and made landfall in the state of Odisha by the next day, becoming the second cyclone to hit the nation within a span of ten days.\n\n\nSystems\nA tropical wave developed stretching between the Malay Peninsula and the equatorial Indian Ocean From this wave a cyclonic circulation formed on March 26 over the southeast Bay of Bengal The strong pulse of the Madden–Julian oscillation, high Tropical Cyclone Heat Potential, moderate sea surface temperatures up to 29–30 °C (84–86 °F), and moderate wind shear, caused the system intensify into a low-pressure area on March 31 An anticyclonic circulation in southeast Asia and an upper tropospheric ridge in the westerlies caused the system to move north-northeastwards These conditions influenced the system and its intensification as it became a well-marked low-pressure area on April 1 at 09:00 UTC (14:30 IST), and later becoming a depression on April 2 at 00:00 UTC (05:30 IST) Satellite imagery revealed that during its intensification, the clouds of the system organised and developed a low-level circulation center with intense to very intense convection at its center It continued to maintain its intensity, however, at 00:00 UTC (05:30 IST) on April 3, vertical wind shear increased, causing the system to weaken slightly and the system's clouds to become disorganised, however, a scatterometer pass revealed that it still maintained its intensity On April 3, at 03:00 UTC (08:30 IST), the clouds further became disorganised, while maintaining its low-level circulation The system continued to weaken under similar unfavourable conditions with further disorganising of clouds, and at 06:00 UTC (11:30 IST), the system was downgraded to a well-marked low-pressure area, with the system barely having a circulation [2]\n\n\nDepression BOB 01\nA tropical wave developed stretching between the Malay Peninsula and the equatorial Indian Ocean From this wave a cyclonic circulation formed on March 26 over the southeast Bay of Bengal The strong pulse of the Madden–Julian

having a circulation [2]\n\n\nExtremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Tauktae\nOn May 14, a depression formed in the Arabian Sea off the coast of Kerala [3] The JTWC began monitoring the depression, and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 01A [4] The system gradually intensified, before intensifying into a Deep Depression by 12:00 UTC (17:30 IST) that day [5] Around 18:00 UTC (23:30 IST) that day, the system intensified into a Cyclonic Storm, and it was given the name Tauktae by the IMD [6] [7] The name Tauktae was contributed to the naming list by Myanmar, and it means gecko in the Burmese language [8] It later intensified into a Severe Cyclonic Storm at 15:00 UTC (20:30 IST) in May 15 [9] Tauktae's intensification was unusual as it intensified from a depression to a severe cyclonic storm over a period of just two days, with equivalent storms generally taking four to five days to intensify into a severe cyclonic storm [10] Three hours later, the JTWC upgraded Tauktae to a Category 1-equivalent tropical cyclone on the Saffir–Simpson scale [11] Tauktae further intensified into a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm at 00:00 UTC (05:30 IST) May 16 [12] At 06:00 UTC (11:30 IST) that day, the JTWC upgraded the storm further to a Category 2 tropical cyclone [13] INSAT imagery showed that the cyclone had developed an eye by 09:00 UTC (14:30 IST) [14] However, the eye had started to degrade by 15:00 UTC (20:30 IST), according to INSAT imagery, and remained ragged for the rest of the storm's lifetime [15]\n\n\nVery Severe Cyclonic Storm Yaas\nOn May 22, a low-pressure area formed in the Bay of Bengal On the next day, at 09:30 UTC (15:00 IST), the disturbance organised into a Depression, and was assigned the designation BOB 02 by the IMD [39] Later that day, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system [40] The storm subsequently intensified into a Deep Depression at 15:00 UTC (20:30 IST) on May 23 [41] Several hours later, the storm further intensified into a Cyclonic Storm at 03:00 UTC (08:30 IST) on May 24, and was given the name Yaas by the IMD [42] The name Yaas was provided by Oman, [7] and it means \"a Jasmin-like tree\", which has good fragrance in Persian [8] In Arabic, the name Yaas is known as despair or desperation [43] Meanwhile, JTWC designated as Tropical Cyclone 02B [44] On May 24, at 18:00 UTC (23:30 IST) it rapidly intensified into a severe cyclonic storm, [45] then becoming a very severe cyclonic storm on 15:00 UTC (20:30 IST) of May 25 despite being present in moderate to high easterly wind shear [46] Meanwhile, JTWC upgraded it into a Category 1 tropical cyclone on 15:00 UTC (20:30 IST) of the same day [47] The cyclone made landfall north of Dhamra Port and south of Bahanaga at around 03:30 UTC (09:00 IST) in May 26 [48] The process completed at around 05:30 UTC (11:00 IST ), with estimated winds up to 130 to 140 km/h (80 to 85 mph) Storm surge caused most of the damage in south Bengal and northwestern Odisha [49] After landfall it started to weaken rapidly into a severe cyclonic storm then into a cyclonic storm [50] As it moved further inland towards Nepal, IMD discontinuing advisories for Cyclone Yaas, as it became a well marked low pressure on 00:00 UTC (05:00 IST) of May 28 [51] JTWC later issued their last warning at 09:00 UTC (11:30 IST) in May 26, stating that it rapidly weakened into a tropical storm after landfall [52] The remnant of Cyclone Yaas continued moving north-northwestwards and impacted Bihar, Jharkhand and eastern Uttar Pradesh Heavy rainfall and gusty winds were reported in these areas [53] [54] [55] The cyclone also helped the monsoon to strengthen over the Bay of Bengal, after Tauktae disrupted it on May 15 [56]\n\n\nDeep Depression BOB 03\nOn September 11 at 00:00 UTC (05:30 IST), under an influence of a cyclonic disturbance, an area of low pressure had formed over the east central and the adjoining northeastern Bay of Bengal, which later intensified into a well marked low pressure area, a day later At 12:00 UTC (17:30 IST) the same day, it further concentrated into a depression as it approached the coast of Odisha Conditions like low to moderate vertical wind shear, warm sea-surface temperature and strong pulse of Madden Julian Oscillation helped the system's intensification to a depression Due to the prevailing monsoonal trade winds, the system moved west-northwestwards for the rest of its lifetime [67] [68] As the system was about to make landfall near Chandbali, Odisha, it further concentrated deep depression at 00:00 UTC (05:30 IST) At the same moment it crossed near Chandbali between 00:00 UTC and 01:00 UTC (05:30 IST and 06:30 IST) as a deep depression After crossing, it weakened into a depression over the border of Chhattisgarh and Odisha, at 03:00 UTC (08:30 IST) the next day, but it managed to maintain its intensity  for the rest of its lifetime, because of the prevailing monsoonal conditions This unusual phenomenon is called the brown ocean effect [69] [68] It continued to move on its trajectory, until at 00:00 UTC of September 15, it further weakened into a well-marked low pressure area over northeastern Madhya Pradesh and its neighbourhood [68] The JTWC didn't tracked the system, but they did monitored as an invest [70]\n\n\nCyclonic Storm Gulab\nOn September 24, the JTWC noted a cyclone which was producing tropical storm-force winds located over the east-central Bay of Bengal, 211 nmi (391 km; 243 mi) south of Chittagong, Bangladesh, designating the system as 03B [74] The IMD noted the system as a low pressure area at 03:00 UTC (08:30 IST); the system formed from a cyclonic circulation which persisted over the Gulf of Martaban [75] [76] It was later upgraded to a well-marked low-pressure area at 11:00 UTC (16:30 IST), as it developed a cyclonic vortex at 06:00 UTC (11:30 IST) [77] [78] At 15:00 UTC (20:30 IST), the IMD upgraded it to a Depression, as the convection had further organized and the clouds were moving in a curved manner Favorable conditions such as moderate to high sea-surface temperatures, the Madden–Julian oscillation being favorable for tropical cyclone development, and low vertical wind shear allowed intensification [79] By 03:00 UTC the next day, the system was upgraded to a Deep Depression, as the cloud further organized near the center There were also the presence of warm moist air over the center of the system [80] [81] At 15:00 UTC (20:30 IST), the IMD upgraded it to a cyclonic storm as its convection had become better organized with a defined central dense overcast [82] The system was named Gulab, which was suggested by Pakistan [82] [7] The name means rose in Urdu/Hindi [83] As it continued westward, the cloud bands of Cyclone Gulab had touched the coastal regions of northern Andhra Pradesh and southern Odisha, which indicated that it had started its landfall process at about 18:00 IST (12:30 UTC) on September 26 [84] By 17:00 UTC (10:30 IST), it had crossed 20 km (10 mi) north of Kalingapatnam [85] At 21:00 UTC (02:30 IST), the JTWC had issued its final warning prior to landfall [86] Three hours later, the IMD downgraded it to a deep depression, as it had lost its energy after travelling over rough Indian terrain [87] It further weakened into a depression by 20:00 IST (14:30 UTC) as it entered the state of Telangana [88] It maintained its intensity as it travelled westwards until at 14:00 IST (08:30 UTC), when it weakened into a well-marked low pressure area over west Vidarbha [89] The remnant of Gulab later became Cyclone Shaheen over the Arabian Sea [90] [91]\n\n\nSevere Cyclonic Storm Shaheen\nOn September 29, the remnant of Cyclone Gulab entered northeastern Arabian Sea as a well-marked low pressure area [90] At 17:30 UTC (23:00 IST) that same day, the JTWC issued a TCFA as it developed a well-defined convection and a low-level circulation center [102] At 00:00 UTC (05:30 IST) next day, the IMD upgraded the system to a depression over the Gulf of Kutch, thus designating it as ARB 02 INSAT 3D satellite imagery showed that the convection had increased near its center [103] [104] At 21:00 UTC (02:30 IST), the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical storm, re-assigning it the designation 03B as the agency viewed Shaheen as a continuation of Cyclone Gulab [105] At the same moment, the IMD upgraded it to a deep depression [106] Six hours later, the system was further upgraded to a cyclonic storm, as spiral cloudbands were seen wrapping over the storm's low-level circulation [91] The system thus received the name Shaheen, which was contributed by Qatar [91] [7] At 15:00 UTC (20:30 IST), the IMD further upgraded it to a severe cyclonic storm, as the clouds had become well-organized moving with a defined curved pattern [107] At 03:00 UTC (08:30 IST) the next day, the JTWC upgraded it to a Category 1-equivalent tropical cyclone as it developed an eye-like feature However, it struggled for further development, due to lack of convection [108] By 06:00 UTC (11:30 IST), the cyclone developed a defined but ragged eye [109] At 09:00 UTC (14:30 IST), the JTWC downgraded it to a tropical storm, [110] but six hours later, the JTWC re-upgraded it to a Category 1 tropical cyclone [111] Between 19:00 UTC and 20:00 UTC (00:30 IST and 01:30 IST), Shaheen made landfall over the northern Oman coast, [112] making it one of the rare cyclones to strike this region since 1890 [113] [114] At 21:00 UTC (02:30 IST), the JTWC issued its final warning for the storm as it made landfall [115] After making landfall, Shaheen underwent a rapid weakening because of the dry landmass of the Arabian Desert From 00:00 UTC till 12:00 UTC, it rapidly weakened from a severe cyclonic storm to a well-marked low pressure area Satellite imagery showed that after making landfall, the cloud mass had quickly become disorganized and the center became less defined [116] [117] [118]\n\n\nDepression ARB 03\nOn October 27, a cyclonic circulation spawned a low pressure area over the southern Bay of Bengal The low travelled westward, tracking over Kanyakumari before emerging over the southeastern Arabian Sea by November 3 The low later turned north-northwestward, developing into a well-marked low pressure area by November 6 Warm sea surface temperatures of 28–29 °C (82–84 °F), little dry air, and moderate wind shear allowed the system to further organize to a depression by 03:00 UTC on November 7 Throughout the next day, the depression gradually curve southwestward as it was steered by easterly and northeasterly winds in the mid and upper troposphere Simultaneously, an increase in wind shear led to gradual weakening, eventually causing the system to degenerate into a well-marked low pressure area over the central Arabian Sea by 00:00 UTC on November 9 [128] The JTWC also tracked the system, from 18:00 UTC (23:30 IST) of November 4 while located at 537 nautical miles (995 km; 618 mi) south-southwest of Mumbai until the same time of November 6 [129] [130]\n\n\nDepression BOB 05\nOn November 6, the IMD noted the formation of a cyclonic circulation over southeastern Bay of Bengal near Sumatra [131] Two days later at 13:30 UTC (19:00 IST), the JTWC started tracking the same system  as Invest 91B [132] On November 9, under the influence of the cyclonic circulation, a low-pressure area formed over the same area [133] On the next day, it was upgraded to a well-marked low pressure area after noting a formation of a defined vortex in associated with the system [134] [135] At 15:00 UTC (21:30 IST), the IMD further upgraded it to a depression as its convective structure had improved significantly [136] Later at 19:30 UTC (01:00 IST), the JTWC issued a TCFA for system [137] At 09:00 UTC of November 11, the JTWC declared it as a tropical cyclone and designated as 04B [138] However, the system could not further intensify as it was already near to the coast and high wind shear produced by an upper tropospheric ridge [138] [136] Between 12:00 and 13:00 UTC (17:30 and 18:30 IST), the system made landfall near to Chennai, [139] and by 00:00 UTC (05:30 IST) the next day the system weakened into a well-marked low pressure area [140] The JTWC issued its final advisory at 15:00 UTC of November 11 [141]\n\n\nDepression BOB 06\nOn November 12, a cyclonic circulation persisted over the Gulf of Thailand and the adjoining Malay Peninsula, [143] which on the next day became a low pressure area by the IMD and Invest 92B by the JTWC [144] [145] The IMD and the JTWC previously forecasted that it would become a depression by November 15 and further intensify on November 18 as it reaches the coast of Andhra Pradesh [144] [145] However both the agencies downgraded to nil chance of becoming a depression on November 15, because of a formation of another low pressure system over the Arabian Sea and the formation of a trough to the south of the system over the east of the equatorial Indian Ocean, which blocked the inflow of warm moist winds to the center of the system [146] [147] As the low pressure area meandered westwards towards the Tamil Nadu coast, the system rapidly intensified into a depression by 07:00 UTC (12:30 IST) of November 18, as its convection rapidly consolidated and formed a distinct low-level center By the same time, the JTWC issued a TCFA on the system and started to retrack [148] [149] Between 21:30 and 22:30 UTC (03:00 and 04:00 IST) of the same day, the depression crossed north of Pondicherry, [150] and by 08:00 UTC (13:30 IST) the system weakened into a well-marked low pressure area [151] The JTWC cancelled the TCFA as it made landfall [152]\n\n\nCyclonic Storm Jawad\nOn November 28, the JTWC and the JMA acknowledged a formation of an area of low pressure, which they dubbed as Invest 94W over the South China Sea, which was located 251 nmi (465 km; 289 mi) from Ho Chi Minh City [153] [154] Two days later, at 12:00 UTC (17:30 IST) on November 30, the system crossed into the Andaman Sea, and the IMD started to monitor the system as a low-pressure area [155] On December 2, at 00:00 UTC (05:30 IST), the system further intensified into a well-marked low-pressure area, as the department found that the storm's thunderstorms had been organizing over the past day, with a distinct shear pattern [156] Shortly afterward, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the system [157] Later that day, at 12:00 UTC (17:30 IST), the system intensified into a depression, with the IMD designating the system as BOB 07, after the storm's convection organized further [158] By the next day, at 03:00 UTC (08:30 IST), the system further intensified into a deep depression [159] At the same time, the JTWC declared it a tropical cyclone, assigning a tropical storm intensity to the system, as the cyclone developed a well-defined mid-level circulation, though its low-level circulation center was displaced to the northwest [160] Three hours later, the system was upgraded to a cyclonic storm, with IMD assigning the system the name Jawad, which was submitted by Saudi Arabia, [161] [7] which means \"generous\" or \"merciful\" in Arabic [162] After 00:00 UTC of December 4, Jawad began weakening after reaching its peak intensity at 12:00 UTC the previous day, [163] [164] and by 12:00 UTC the same day, Jawad lost its organization and the IMD downgraded the storm back into a deep depression, most possibly due to decreasing sea surface temperatures along the storm's track with unfavorable wind shear [165] This same reasoning was also used by the JTWC in the agency's final warning on the system, three hours earlier [166] At the same time by the next day, Jawad was further downgraded into a depression as it started to make a northwestward move, [167] and by December 6 at 00:00 UTC, the system further degenerated into a well-marked low-pressure over the northwest Bay of Bengal without making landfall; its convection moved inland over West Bengal and Bangladesh, however [168]\n\n\nStorm names\nWithin this basin, a tropical cyclone is assigned a name when it is judged to have reached cyclonic storm

"**2021 North Indian Ocean cyclone season**\n\nThe 2021 North Indian Ocean cyclone season was a period of significant tropical cyclone activity in the North Indian Ocean. The season officially began on April 1, 2021, and ended on December 30, 2021.\n\n**Season summary**\n\nThe 2021 North Indian Ocean cyclone season was marked by several notable tropical cyclones that formed in the region. The season began with a relatively slow start, with no systems forming until April 2, when a depression formed near the Myanmar coast in the North Andaman Sea. However, it dissipated the next day. The first named storm of the season, Cyclonic Storm Tauktae, formed on May 14 and intensified into an extremely severe cyclonic storm before making landfall in Gujarat on May 17. The season saw another cyclonic storm, Yaas, form on May 22 and make landfall in Odisha on May 26. The season also saw several other notable storms, including Cyclonic Storm Gulab, which formed on September 24 and made landfall in Andhra Pradesh on September 26.\n\n**Systems**\n\nSeveral tropical cyclones formed in the North Indian Ocean during the 2021 season. These included:\n\n### **Depression BOB 01**\n\nA tropical wave developed stretching between the Malay Peninsula and the equatorial Indian Ocean. From this wave, a cyclonic circulation formed over the southeast Bay of Bengal on March 26. The system intensified into a low-pressure area on March 31 and later became a well-marked low-pressure area on April 1. The system continued to maintain its intensity, but vertical wind shear increased, causing it to weaken slightly on April 3. The system continued to weaken under similar unfavourable conditions and was downgraded to a well-marked low-pressure area on April 3.\n\n### **Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Tauktae**\n\nA depression formed in the Arabian Sea off the coast of Kerala on May 14. The JTWC began monitoring the depression, and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 01A. The system gradually intensified, before intensifying into a Deep Depression on May 14. Around 18:00 UTC (23:30 IST) that day, the system intensified into a Cyclonic Storm, and it was given the name Tauktae by the IMD. Tauktae's intensification was unusual as it intensified from a depression to a severe cyclonic storm over a period of just two days, with equivalent storms generally taking four to five days to intensify into a severe cyclonic storm. Tauktae further intensified into a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm at 00:00 UTC May 16 and made landfall in Gujarat hours later, dissipating on May 19.\n\n### **Very Severe Cyclonic Storm Yaas**\n\nA low-pressure area formed in the Bay of Bengal on May 22. The system organised into a Depression and was assigned the designation BOB 02 by the IMD. The JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 02B. The system intensified into a Cyclonic Storm at 03:00 UTC on May 24 and was given the name Yaas by the IMD. Yaas rapidly intensified into a severe cyclonic storm, then becoming a very severe cyclonic storm on May 25 despite being present in moderate to high easterly wind shear. The cyclone made landfall north of Dhamra Port and south of Bahanaga at around 03:30 UTC in May 26. The process completed at around 05:30 UTC, with estimated winds up to 130 to 140 km/h (80 to 85 mph).\n\n### **Deep Depression BOB 03**\n\nA cyclonic disturbance caused an area of low pressure to form over the east central and the adjoining northeastern Bay of Bengal. The system intensified into a well-marked low-pressure area and a day later, it further concentrated into a depression. The system moved west-northwestwards for the rest of its lifetime due to the prevailing monsoonal trade winds. The system maintained its intensity as it travelled over the border of Chhattisgarh and Odisha, due to the brown ocean effect. The system continued to move on its trajectory, until it further weakened into a well-marked low pressure area over northeastern Madhya Pradesh and its neighbourhood.\n\n### **Cyclonic Storm Gulab**\n\nThe JTWC noted a cyclone producing tropical storm-force winds located over the east-central Bay of Bengal, 211 nmi (391 km; 243 mi) south of Chittagong, Bangladesh, and designated the system as 03B. The IMD noted the system as a low-pressure area at 03:00 UTC, which formed from a cyclonic circulation that persisted over the Gulf of Martaban. The system further organized and developed a cyclonic vortex at 06:00 UTC and was upgraded to a well-marked low-pressure area. The system was later upgraded to a Depression as its convection had further organized and the clouds were moving in a curved manner. The system was named Gulab, which was suggested by Pakistan. Gulab made landfall over the northern Andhra Pradesh coast on September 26 and was downgraded to a deep depression, as it had lost its energy after travelling over rough Indian terrain.\n\n### **Severe Cyclonic Storm Shaheen**\n\nThe remnant of Cyclone Gulab entered the northeastern Arabian Sea as a well-marked low-pressure area on September 29. The JTWC issued a TCFA as it developed a well-defined convection and a low-level circulation center. The system was later upgraded to a depression over the Gulf of Kutch, and was designated as ARB 02. The system was further upgraded to a tropical storm, and was re-assigned the designation 03B. The system was named Shaheen, which was contributed by Qatar. Shaheen struggled for further development, due to a lack of convection, but developed a defined but ragged eye. The system made landfall over the northern Oman coast on October 2 and underwent a rapid weakening due to the dry landmass of the Arabian Desert.\n\n### **Cyclonic Storm Jawad**\n\nThe JTWC and the JMA acknowledged a formation of an area of low pressure over the South China Sea. The system crossed into the Andaman Sea on November 30 and was started to be monitored by the IMD as a low-pressure area. The system intensified into a well-marked low-pressure area and was issued a TCFA by the JTWC. The system was later upgraded to a Depression and was designated as BOB 07 by the IMD. The system further intensified into a deep depression and was declared a tropical cyclone by the JTWC. The system was named Jawad, which was submitted by Saudi Arabia. Jawad weakened after reaching its peak intensity and lost its organisation, and was downgraded to a deep depression on December 4.\n\n**Storm names**\n\nWithin this basin, a tropical cyclone is assigned a name when it is judged to have reached cyclonic storm intensity with winds of 65 km/h (40 mph). The names were selected by a new list from the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in New Delhi by mid year of 2020. There is no retirement of tropical cyclone names in this basin as the list of names is only scheduled to be used once before a new list of names is drawn up. The names which were used for the 2021 season are listed below.\n\n**Season effects**\n\nThe 2021 North Indian Ocean cyclone season had a significant impact on the region. Several tropical cyclones formed in the region, causing damage and loss of life. The season was marked by several notable storms, including Cyclonic Storm Tauktae and Cyclonic Storm Yaas, which made landfall in Gujarat and Odisha, respectively. The season also saw several other notable storms, including Cyclonic Storm Gulab, which made landfall in Andhra Pradesh. The season was marked by significant rainfall and strong winds, causing damage and disruption to communities.\n\nThe 2021 North Indian Ocean cyclone season was a period of significant tropical cyclone activity in the North Indian Ocean.

following this outline:\n\n\nSeason summary\nNo systems formed in the basin until April 2, when a depression near the Myanmar coast in the North Andaman Sea formed, however it dissipated the next day It was considered rare since the storm formation usually begins from mid-April to May After a month of inactivity, another depression formed off the coasts of Kerala and Lakshadweep It intensified into a deep depression on the same day and later into a cyclonic storm, being assigned the name Tauktae by the IMD It continued intensifying, and on May 17, Tauktae peaked as an extremely severe cyclonic storm before making landfall in Gujarat hours later, dissipating on May 19 A few days after Tauktae dissipated, a depression formed in the Bay of Bengal on May 23 It intensified gradually to a cyclonic storm and assigned the name Yaas It further intensified into a very severe cyclonic storm on May 25 and made landfall in the state of Odisha by the next day, becoming the second cyclone to hit the nation within a span of ten days.\n\n\nSystems\nA tropical wave developed stretching between the Malay Peninsula and the equatorial Indian Ocean From this wave a cyclonic circulation formed on March 26 over the southeast Bay of Bengal The strong pulse of the Madden–Julian oscillation, high Tropical Cyclone Heat Potential, moderate sea surface temperatures up to 29–30 °C (84–86 °F), and moderate wind shear, caused the system intensify into a low-pressure area on March 31 An anticyclonic circulation in southeast Asia and an upper tropospheric ridge in the westerlies caused the system to move north-northeastwards These conditions influenced the system and its intensification as it became a well-marked low-pressure area on April 1 at 09:00 UTC (14:30 IST), and later becoming a depression on April 2 at 00:00 UTC (05:30 IST) Satellite imagery revealed that during its intensification, the clouds of the system organised and developed a low-level circulation center with intense to very intense convection at its center It continued to maintain its intensity, however, at 00:00 UTC (05:30 IST) on April 3, vertical wind shear increased, causing the system to weaken slightly and the system's clouds to become disorganised, however, a scatterometer pass revealed that it still maintained its intensity On April 3, at 03:00 UTC (08:30 IST), the clouds further became disorganised, while maintaining its low-level circulation The system continued to weaken under similar unfavourable conditions with further disorganising of clouds, and at 06:00 UTC (11:30 IST), the system was downgraded to a well-marked low-pressure area, with the system barely having a circulation [2]\n\n\nDepression BOB 01\nA tropical wave developed stretching between the Malay Peninsula and the

[2]\n\n\nExtremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Tauktae\nOn May 14, a depression formed in the Arabian Sea off the coast of Kerala [3] The JTWC began monitoring the depression, and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 01A [4] The system gradually intensified, before intensifying into a Deep Depression by 12:00 UTC (17:30 IST) that day [5] Around 18:00 UTC (23:30 IST) that day, the system intensified into a Cyclonic Storm, and it was given the name Tauktae by the IMD [6] [7] The name Tauktae was contributed to the naming list by Myanmar, and it means gecko in the Burmese language [8] It later intensified into a Severe Cyclonic Storm at 15:00 UTC (20:30 IST) in May 15 [9] Tauktae's intensification was unusual as it intensified from a depression to a severe cyclonic storm over a period of just two days, with equivalent storms generally taking four to five days to intensify into a severe cyclonic storm [10] Three hours later, the JTWC upgraded Tauktae to a Category 1-equivalent tropical cyclone on the Saffir–Simpson scale [11] Tauktae further intensified into a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm at 00:00 UTC (05:30 IST) May 16 [12] At 06:00 UTC (11:30 IST) that day, the JTWC upgraded the storm further to a Category 2 tropical cyclone [13] INSAT imagery showed that the cyclone had developed an eye by 09:00 UTC (14:30 IST) [14] However, the eye had started to degrade by 15:00 UTC (20:30 IST), according to INSAT imagery, and remained ragged for the rest of the storm's lifetime [15]\n\n\nVery Severe Cyclonic Storm Yaas\nOn May 22, a low-pressure area formed in the Bay of Bengal On the next day, at 09:30 UTC (15:00 IST), the disturbance organised into a Depression, and was assigned the designation BOB 02 by the IMD [39] Later that day, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system [40] The storm subsequently intensified into a Deep Depression at 15:00 UTC (20:30 IST) on May 23 [41] Several hours later, the storm further intensified into a Cyclonic Storm at 03:00 UTC (08:30 IST) on May 24, and was given the name Yaas by the IMD [42] The name Yaas was provided by Oman, [7] and it means \"a Jasmin-like tree\", which has good fragrance in Persian [8] In Arabic, the name Yaas is known as despair or desperation [43] Meanwhile, JTWC designated as Tropical Cyclone 02B [44] On May 24, at 18:00 UTC (23:30 IST) it rapidly intensified into a severe cyclonic storm, [45] then becoming a very severe cyclonic storm on 15:00 UTC (20:30 IST) of May 25 despite being present in moderate to high easterly wind shear [46] Meanwhile, JTWC upgraded it into a Category 1 tropical cyclone on 15:00 UTC (20:30 IST) of the same day [47] The cyclone made landfall north of Dhamra Port and south of Bahanaga at around 03:30 UTC (09:00 IST) in May 26 [48] The process completed at around 05:30 UTC (11:00 IST ), with estimated winds up to 130 to 140 km/h (80 to 85 mph) Storm surge caused most of the damage in south Bengal and northwestern Odisha [49] After landfall it started to weaken rapidly into a severe cyclonic storm then into a cyclonic storm [50] As it moved further inland towards Nepal, IMD discontinuing advisories for Cyclone Yaas, as it became a well marked low pressure on 00:00 UTC (05:00 IST) of May 28 [51] JTWC later issued their last warning at 09:00 UTC (11:30 IST) in May 26, stating that it rapidly weakened into a tropical storm after landfall [52] The remnant of Cyclone Yaas continued moving north-northwestwards and impacted Bihar, Jharkhand and eastern Uttar Pradesh Heavy rainfall and gusty winds were reported in these areas [53] [54] [55] The cyclone also helped the monsoon to strengthen over the Bay of Bengal, after Tauktae disrupted it on May 15 [56]\n\n\nDeep Depression BOB 03\nOn September 11 at 00:00 UTC (05:30 IST), under an influence of a cyclonic disturbance, an area of low pressure had formed over the east central and the adjoining northeastern Bay of Bengal, which later intensified into a well marked low pressure area, a day later At 12:00 UTC (17:30 IST) the same day, it further concentrated into a depression as it approached the coast of Odisha Conditions like low to moderate vertical wind shear, warm sea-surface temperature and strong pulse of Madden Julian Oscillation helped the system's intensification to a depression Due to the prevailing monsoonal trade winds, the system moved west-northwestwards for the rest of its lifetime [67] [68] As the system was about to make landfall near Chandbali, Odisha, it further concentrated deep depression at 00:00 UTC (05:30 IST) At the same moment it crossed near Chandbali between 00:00 UTC and 01:00 UTC (05:30 IST and 06:30 IST) as a deep depression After crossing, it weakened into a depression over the border of Chhattisgarh and Odisha, at 03:00 UTC (08:30 IST) the next day, but it managed to maintain its intensity  for the rest of its lifetime, because of the prevailing monsoonal conditions This unusual phenomenon is called the brown ocean effect [69] [68] It continued to move on its trajectory, until at 00:00 UTC of September 15, it further weakened into a well-marked low pressure area over northeastern Madhya Pradesh and its neighbourhood [68] The JTWC didn't tracked the system, but they did monitored as an invest [70]\n\n\nCyclonic Storm Gulab\nOn September 24, the JTWC noted a cyclone which was producing tropical storm-force winds located over the east-central Bay of Bengal, 211 nmi (391 km; 243 mi) south of Chittagong, Bangladesh, designating the system as 03B [74] The IMD noted the system as a low pressure area at 03:00 UTC (08:30 IST); the system formed from a cyclonic circulation which persisted over the Gulf of Martaban [75] [76] It was later upgraded to a well-marked low-pressure area at 11:00 UTC (16:30 IST), as it developed a cyclonic vortex at 06:00 UTC (11:30 IST) [77] [78] At 15:00 UTC (20:30 IST), the IMD upgraded it to a Depression, as the convection had further organized and the clouds were moving in a curved manner Favorable conditions such as moderate to high sea-surface temperatures, the Madden–Julian oscillation being favorable for tropical cyclone development, and low vertical wind shear allowed intensification [79] By 03:00 UTC the next day, the system was upgraded to a Deep Depression, as the cloud further organized near the center There were also the presence of warm moist air over the center of the system [80] [81] At 15:00 UTC (20:30 IST), the IMD upgraded it to a cyclonic storm as its convection had become better organized with a defined central dense overcast [82] The system was named Gulab, which was suggested by Pakistan [82] [7] The name means rose in Urdu/Hindi [83] As it continued westward, the cloud bands of Cyclone Gulab had touched the coastal regions of northern Andhra Pradesh and southern Odisha, which indicated that it had started its landfall process at about 18:00 IST (12:30 UTC) on September 26 [84] By 17:00 UTC (10:30 IST), it had crossed 20 km (10 mi) north of Kalingapatnam [85] At 21:00 UTC (02:30 IST), the JTWC had issued its final warning prior to landfall [86] Three hours later, the IMD downgraded it to a deep depression, as it had lost its energy after travelling over rough Indian terrain [87] It further weakened into a depression by 20:00 IST (14:30 UTC) as it entered the state of Telangana [88] It maintained its intensity as it travelled westwards until at 14:00 IST (08:30 UTC), when it weakened into a well-marked low pressure area over west Vidarbha [89] The remnant of Gulab later became Cyclone Shaheen over the Arabian Sea [90] [91]\n\n\nSevere Cyclonic Storm Shaheen\nOn September 29, the remnant of Cyclone Gulab entered northeastern Arabian Sea as a well-marked low pressure area [90] At 17:30 UTC (23:00 IST) that same day, the JTWC issued a TCFA as it developed a well-defined convection and a low-level circulation center [102] At 00:00 UTC (05:30 IST) next day, the IMD upgraded the system to a depression over the Gulf of Kutch, thus designating it as ARB 02 INSAT 3D satellite imagery showed that the convection had increased near its center [103] [104] At 21:00 UTC (02:30 IST), the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical storm, re-assigning it the designation 03B as the agency viewed Shaheen as a continuation of Cyclone Gulab [105] At the same moment, the IMD upgraded it to a deep depression [106] Six hours later, the system was further upgraded to a cyclonic storm, as spiral cloudbands were seen wrapping over the storm's low-level circulation [91] The system thus received the name Shaheen, which was contributed by Qatar [91] [7] At 15:00 UTC (20:30 IST), the IMD further upgraded it to a severe cyclonic storm, as the clouds had become well-organized moving with a defined curved pattern [107] At 03:00 UTC (08:30 IST) the next day, the JTWC upgraded it to a Category 1-equivalent tropical cyclone as it developed an eye-like feature However, it struggled for further development, due to lack of convection [108] By 06:00 UTC (11:30 IST), the cyclone developed a defined but ragged eye [109] At 09:00 UTC (14:30 IST), the JTWC downgraded it to a tropical storm, [110] but six hours later, the JTWC re-upgraded it to a Category 1 tropical cyclone [111] Between 19:00 UTC and 20:00 UTC (00:30 IST and 01:30 IST), Shaheen made landfall over the northern Oman coast, [112] making it one of the rare cyclones to strike this region since 1890 [113] [114] At 21:00 UTC (02:30 IST), the JTWC issued its final warning for the storm as it made landfall [115] After making landfall, Shaheen underwent a rapid weakening because of the dry landmass of the Arabian Desert From 00:00 UTC till 12:00 UTC, it rapidly weakened from a severe cyclonic storm to a well-marked low pressure area Satellite imagery showed that after making landfall, the cloud mass had quickly become disorganized and the center became less defined [116] [117] [118]\n\n\nDepression ARB 03\nOn October 27, a cyclonic circulation spawned a low pressure area over the southern Bay of Bengal The low travelled westward, tracking over Kanyakumari before emerging over the southeastern Arabian Sea by November 3 The low later turned north-northwestward, developing into a well-marked low pressure area by November 6 Warm sea surface temperatures of 28–29 °C (82–84 °F), little dry air, and moderate wind shear allowed the system to further organize to a depression by 03:00 UTC on November 7 Throughout the next day, the depression gradually curve southwestward as it was steered by easterly and northeasterly winds in the mid and upper troposphere Simultaneously, an increase in wind shear led to gradual weakening, eventually causing the system to degenerate into a well-marked low pressure area over the central Arabian Sea by 00:00 UTC on November 9 [128] The JTWC also tracked the system, from 18:00 UTC (23:30 IST) of November 4 while located at 537 nautical miles (995 km; 618 mi) south-southwest of Mumbai until the same time of November 6 [129] [130]\n\n\nDepression BOB 05\nOn November 6, the IMD noted the formation of a cyclonic circulation over southeastern Bay of Bengal near Sumatra [131] Two days later at 13:30 UTC (19:00 IST), the JTWC started tracking the same system  as Invest 91B [132] On November 9, under the influence of the cyclonic circulation, a low-pressure area formed over the same area [133] On the next day, it was upgraded to a well-marked low pressure area after noting a formation of a defined vortex in associated with the system [134] [135] At 15:00 UTC (21:30 IST), the IMD further upgraded it to a depression as its convective structure had improved significantly [136] Later at 19:30 UTC (01:00 IST), the JTWC issued a TCFA for system [137] At 09:00 UTC of November 11, the JTWC declared it as a tropical cyclone and designated as 04B [138] However, the system could not further intensify as it was already near to the coast and high wind shear produced by an upper tropospheric ridge [138] [136] Between 12:00 and 13:00 UTC (17:30 and 18:30 IST), the system made landfall near to Chennai, [139] and by 00:00 UTC (05:30 IST) the next day the system weakened into a well-marked low pressure area [140] The JTWC issued its final advisory at 15:00 UTC of November 11 [141]\n\n\nDepression BOB 06\nOn November 12, a cyclonic circulation persisted over the Gulf of Thailand and the adjoining Malay Peninsula, [143] which on the next day became a low pressure area by the IMD and Invest 92B by the JTWC [144] [145] The IMD and the JTWC previously forecasted that it would become a depression by November 15 and further intensify on November 18 as it reaches the coast of Andhra Pradesh [144] [145] However both the agencies downgraded to nil chance of becoming a depression on November 15, because of a formation of another low pressure system over the Arabian Sea and the formation of a trough to the south of the system over the east of the equatorial Indian Ocean, which blocked the inflow of warm moist winds to the center of the system [146] [147] As the low pressure area meandered westwards towards the Tamil Nadu coast, the system rapidly intensified into a depression by 07:00 UTC (12:30 IST) of November 18, as its convection rapidly consolidated and formed a distinct low-level center By the same time, the JTWC issued a TCFA on the system and started to retrack [148] [149] Between 21:30 and 22:30 UTC (03:00 and 04:00 IST) of the same day, the depression crossed north of Pondicherry, [150] and by 08:00 UTC (13:30 IST) the system weakened into a well-marked low pressure area [151] The JTWC cancelled the TCFA as it made landfall [152]\n\n\nCyclonic Storm Jawad\nOn November 28, the JTWC and the JMA acknowledged a formation of an area of low pressure, which they dubbed as Invest 94W over the South China Sea, which was located 251 nmi (465 km; 289 mi) from Ho Chi Minh City [153] [154] Two days later, at 12:00 UTC (17:30 IST) on November 30, the system crossed into the Andaman Sea, and the IMD started to monitor the system as a low-pressure area [155] On December 2, at 00:00 UTC (05:30 IST), the system further intensified into a well-marked low-pressure area, as the department found that the storm's thunderstorms had been organizing over the past day, with a distinct shear pattern [156] Shortly afterward, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the system [157] Later that day, at 12:00 UTC (17:30 IST), the system intensified into a depression, with the IMD designating the system as BOB 07, after the storm's convection organized further [158] By the next day, at 03:00 UTC (08:30 IST), the system further intensified into a deep depression [159] At the same time, the JTWC declared it a tropical cyclone, assigning a tropical storm intensity to the system, as the cyclone developed a well-defined mid-level circulation, though its low-level circulation center was displaced to the northwest [160] Three hours later, the system was upgraded to a cyclonic storm, with IMD assigning the system the name Jawad, which was submitted by Saudi Arabia, [161] [7] which means \"generous\" or \"merciful\" in Arabic [162] After 00:00 UTC of December 4, Jawad began weakening after reaching its peak intensity at 12:00 UTC the previous day, [163] [164] and by 12:00 UTC the same day, Jawad lost its organization and the IMD downgraded the storm back into a deep depression, most possibly due to decreasing sea surface temperatures along the storm's track with unfavorable wind shear [165] This same reasoning was also used by the JTWC in the agency's final warning on the system, three hours earlier [166] At the same time by the next day, Jawad was further downgraded into a depression as it started to make a northwestward move, [167] and by December 6 at 00:00 UTC, the system further degenerated into a well-marked low-pressure over the northwest Bay of Bengal without making landfall; its convection moved inland over West Bengal and Bangladesh, however [168]\n\n\nStorm names\nWithin this basin, a tropical cyclone is assigned a name when it is judged to have reached cyclonic storm intensity with winds of 65 km/h (40 mph) The names were selected by a new list from the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in New Delhi by mid year of 2020 There is no retirement of tropical cyclone names in this basin as the list of names is only scheduled to be used once before a new list of names is drawn up Should a named tropical cyclone move into the basin from the Western Pacific, then it will retain its original name The names which were used for the 2021 season are listed below [7]\n\n\nSeason effects\nThis is a table of all storms in the 2021 North Indian Ocean cyclone season It mentions all of the season's storms and their names, duration, peak intensities (according to the IMD storm scale), damage, and death totals Damage and death totals include the damage and deaths caused when that storm was a precursor wave or extratropical low, and all of the damage figures are in 2021 USD.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Some have suggested that he is unlikely to be Japanese due to his native-level use of English. Despite numerous attempts to uncover his identity, Nakamoto has maintained his anonymity, fueling speculation and debate about his true identity.\n\n**Possible Identities**\n\nOver the years, various individuals have been suggested as potential candidates for Nakamoto's identity. These include cryptography and computer science experts, many of whom are non-Japanese. Some of the most popular candidates include Hal Finney, Nick Szabo, and Craig Wright, each of whom has been linked to Bitcoin through various means.

Born and raised in St. Louis Park, Minnesota, the brothers have been making films together since the 1980s, and their careers have spanned over four decades.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJoel Daniel Coen was born on November 29, 1954, and Ethan Jesse Coen was born on September 21, 1957. The brothers were raised in St. Louis Park, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis, where they developed a strong interest in film and storytelling. Their mother, Rena (née Neumann), was an art historian at St. Cloud State University, and their father, Edward Coen, was a Professor of Economics at the University of Minnesota. The brothers have an older sister, Deborah, who is a psychiatrist in Israel.\n\n**Education**\n\nJoel and Ethan graduated from St. Louis Park High School in 1973 and 1976, respectively, and from Bard College at Simon's Rock in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. After graduating from New York University, Joel worked as a production assistant on a variety of industrial films and music videos, developing a talent for film editing and meeting Sam Raimi while assisting Edna Ruth Paul in editing Raimi's first feature film, The Evil Dead (1981).\n\n**Career**\n\nThe Coen brothers' early films were often genre-defying and experimental, showcasing their unique storytelling style and visual aesthetic. One of their earliest films, Blood Simple (1984), was a neo-noir crime thriller that received critical acclaim and established the brothers as rising talents in the film industry.\n\n**1980s**\n\nIn the 1980s, the Coen brothers continued to push the boundaries of film storytelling with their eclectic and often unsettling films. Raising Arizona (1987) was a quirky comedy that starred Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter as a couple who kidnap a baby, while Miller's Crossing (1990) was a gangster film inspired by Dashiell Hammett's Red Harvest (1929) and The Glass Key (1931).\n\n**1990s**\n\nThe Coen brothers' next film, Barton Fink (1991), was a dark comedy that starred John Turturro as a struggling writer who becomes trapped in a bizarre and surreal world. Fargo (1996) was a crime thriller that starred Frances McDormand as a pregnant police chief who investigates a series of murders, and The Big Lebowski (1998) was a quirky comedy that followed the misadventures of \"The Dude,\" a laid-back stoner who gets caught up in a complex and absurd crime caper.\n\n**2000s**\n\nThe Coen brothers' next film, O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000), was a critically acclaimed comedy that starred George Clooney as a escaped convict who embarks on a journey with his two companions, played by John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson. The film's bluegrass and old-time soundtrack, offbeat humor, and digitally desaturated cinematography made it a critical and commercial hit.\n\n**2010s**\n\nTrue Grit (2010) was a Western film that starred Hailee Steinfeld as a young girl who hires a tough U.S. Marshal, played by Jeff Bridges, to track down her father's killer. The film was a critical and commercial success, and received ten Academy Award nominations.\n\n**2020s**\n\nIn 2020, the Coen brothers announced that they would be directing a new film, Drive-Away Dolls, for Focus Features and Working Title, which would be their first narrative film without each other. The film was released in February 2024.\n\n**Planned and Uncompleted Projects**\n\nThe Coen brothers' own film production company, Mike Zoss Productions, has been credited on their films from O Brother, Where Art Thou? onwards. The company was named after Mike Zoss Drug, an independent pharmacy in St. Louis Park since 1950 that was the brothers' beloved hangout when they were growing up in the Twin Cities.\n\n**Production Company**\n\nMike Zoss Productions is a film production company founded by the Coen brothers, which has produced many of their films, including O Brother, Where Art Thou?, The Man Who Wasn't There, and No Country for Old Men.\n\n**Directing Distinctions**\n\nUp to 2003, Joel received sole credit for directing and Ethan for producing, due to guild rules that disallowed multiple director credits to prevent dilution of the position's significance. Since 2004, the Coen brothers have been able to share the director credit, and have become only the third duo to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director.\n\n**Personal Lives**\n\nJoel has been married to actress Frances McDormand since 1984. In 1995, they adopted a son, Pedro McDormand Coen, from Paraguay when he was six months old. Frances McDormand has acted in many of the Coen brothers' films, including Blood Simple, Raising Arizona, Miller's Crossing, Barton Fink, Fargo, The Man Who Wasn't There, Burn After Reading, and Hail, Caesar!

{"title": "North_Macedonia", "content": "\nNames and etymology\nThe state's name derives from the Greek word Μακεδονία (Makedonía), [10] [11] a kingdom (later, region) named after the ancient Macedonians Their name, Μακεδόνες (Makedónes), ultimately derives from the ancient Greek adjective μακεδνός (makednós), meaning 'tall' or 'taper', [12] which shares the same root as the adjective μακρός (makrós, 'long, tall, high') in ancient Greek [13] The name is believed to have originally meant either 'highlanders' or 'the tall ones', possibly descriptive of the people [11] [14] [15] According to linguist Robert S P Beekes, both terms are of pre-Greek substrate origin and cannot be explained in terms of Indo-European morphology [16] According to linguist Filip De Decker, Beekes's arguments are insufficiently supported [17]\n\n\nHistory\nNorth Macedonia geographically roughly corresponds to the ancient kingdom of Paeonia, [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] which was located immediately north of the ancient kingdom of Macedonia [38] Paeonia was inhabited by the Paeonians, whilst the northwest was inhabited by the Dardani and the southwest by tribes known historically as the Enchelae, Pelagones, and Lyncestae; the latter two are generally regarded as Molossian tribes of the northwestern Greek group, whilst the former two are considered Illyrian [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] The headwaters of the Axios river are mentioned by Homer as the home of the Paeonians allies of Troy [45]\n\n\nEarly history\nNorth Macedonia geographically roughly corresponds to the ancient kingdom of

two are considered Illyrian [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] The headwaters of the Axios river are mentioned by Homer as the home of the Paeonians allies of Troy [45]\n\n\nMedieval period\nSlavic tribes settled in the Balkan region including North Macedonia by the late 6th century AD They were led by Pannonian Avars [56] [57] [58] The Slavs settled on places of earlier settlements and probably merged later with the local populations to form mixed Byzantine-Slavic communities [59] Historical records document that in c. 680 a Bulgar ruler called Kuber led a group of largely Christians called Sermesianoi, who were his subjects, and they settled in the region of Pelagonia They may have consisted of Bulgars, Byzantines, Slavs and even Germanic tribes [60] There is no more information of Kuber's life [61] [62] Presian's reign apparently coincides with the extension of Bulgarian control over the Slavic tribes in and around Macedonia The Slavic tribes that settled in the region of Macedonia converted to Christianity around the 9th century during the reign of Tsar Boris I of Bulgaria The Ohrid Literary School became one of the two major cultural centres of the First Bulgarian Empire, along with the Preslav Literary School Established in Ohrid in 886 by Saint Clement of Ohrid on the order of Boris I, the Ohrid Literary School was involved in the spreading of the Cyrillic script [63]\n\n\nOttoman period\nThe Kingdom of Prilep was one of the short-lived states that emerged from the collapse of the Serbian Empire in the 14th century, which was seized by the Ottomans at the end of the same century [64] Gradually, all of the central Balkans were conquered by the Ottoman Empire and remained under its domination for five centuries as part of the province or Eyalet of Rumelia The name Rumelia (Turkish: Rumeli) means \"Land of the Romans\" in Turkish, referring to the lands conquered by the Ottoman Turks from the Byzantine Empire [65] Over the centuries, Rumelia Eyalet was reduced in size through administrative reforms, until by the 19th century it consisted of a region of central Albania and western North Macedonia with its capital at Manastir or present-day Bitola [66] Rumelia Eyalet was abolished in 1867 and that territory of Macedonia subsequently became part of vilayets of Manastir, Kosova and Selanik until the end of Ottoman rule in 1912 With the beginning of the Bulgarian National Revival in the 19th century, many of the reformers were from this region, including the Miladinov brothers, [67] Rajko Žinzifov, Joakim Krčovski, [68] Kiril Pejčinoviḱ [69] and others The bishoprics of Skopje, Debar, Bitola, Ohrid, Veles, and Strumica voted to join the Bulgarian Exarchate after it was established in 1870 [70]\n\n\nModern period\nSeveral movements whose goals were the establishment of an autonomous Macedonia, which would encompass the entire region of Macedonia, began to arise in the late 19th century; the earliest of these was the Bulgarian Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Committees, later becoming Secret Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (SMARO) In 1905 it was renamed the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (IMARO), and after World War I the organisation separated into the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) and the Internal Thracian Revolutionary Organisation (ITRO) [71]\n\n\nMacedonian autonomism\nSeveral movements whose goals were the establishment of an autonomous Macedonia, which would encompass the entire region of Macedonia, began to arise in the late 19th century; the earliest of these was the Bulgarian Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Committees, later becoming Secret Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (SMARO) In 1905 it was renamed the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (IMARO), and after World War I the organisation separated into the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) and the Internal Thracian Revolutionary Organisation (ITRO) [71]\n\n\nKingdom of Serbia\nFollowing the two Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913 and the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, most of its European-held territories were divided between Greece, Bulgaria and Serbia [78] Almost the territory that was to become North Macedonia was annexed by Serbia conforming to the treaty of peace concluded at Bucharest [79] However, Strumica region was passed to Bulgaria Following the partition, an anti-Bulgarian campaign was carried out in the areas under Serbian and Greek control [80] As many as 641 Bulgarian schools and 761 churches were closed by the Serbs, while Exarchist clergy and teachers were expelled [80] The use of all Macedonian dialects and standard Bulgarian were proscribed [80] IMRO, together with local Albanians, organised the Ohrid–Debar uprising against the Serbian rule Within a few days the rebels captured the towns of Gostivar, Struga and Ohrid, expelling the Serbian troops According to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace report, a Serbian army of 100,000 regulars suppressed the uprising Many were killed and tens of thousands refugees fled to Bulgaria and Albania [81] [82]\n\n\nWorld War I\nDuring the First World War, most of today's North Macedonia was part of the Bulgarian occupied zone of Serbia after the country was invaded by the Central Powers in the fall of 1915 [80] The region was known as the \"Military Inspection Area of Macedonia\" and was administered by a Bulgarian military commander [83] A policy of Bulgarisation of the region and its population was immediately initiated, [84] [85] during the period the IMRO arose from a clandestine organisation to serve as gendarmerie, taking control of the whole police structure, enforcing the Bulgarisation of the region [84] According to Robert Gerwarth, the Bulgarian denationalisation policy, including its paramilitary aspect, was almost identical in its intent and execution to the Serbian policy that preceded it [84]\n\n\nKingdom of Yugoslavia\nAfter the capitulation of Bulgaria and the end of the First World War, the area returned under Belgrade control as part of the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes [89] and saw a reintroduction of anti-Bulgarian measures Bulgarian teachers and clergy were expelled, Bulgarian language signs and books removed, and all Bulgarian organisations dissolved [80] Also after the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine, the Strumica region was annexed to Serbian Macedonia in 1919.\n\n\nWorld War II\nDuring World War II, Yugoslavia was occupied by the Axis powers from 1941 to 1945 The Vardar Banovina was divided between Bulgaria and Italian-occupied Albania Bulgarian Action Committees were established to prepare the region for the new Bulgarian administration and army [101] The committees were mostly formed by former members of IMRO and Macedonian Youth Secret Revolutionary Organization (MYSRO, but some IMRO (United) former members also participated [102] [103]\n\n\nSocialist Yugoslavia\nIn December 1944, the Anti-fascist Assembly for the National Liberation of Macedonia (ASNOM) proclaimed the People's Republic of Macedonia as part of the People's Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [114] ASNOM remained an acting government until the end of the war The Macedonian alphabet was codified by linguists of ASNOM, who based their alphabet on the phonetic alphabet of Vuk Stefanović Karadžić and the principles of Krste Petkov Misirkov During the civil war in Greece (1946–1949), Macedonian communist insurgents supported the Greek communists Many refugees fled to the Socialist Republic of Macedonia from there The state removed \"Socialist\" from its name in 1991 when it peacefully seceded from Yugoslavia.\n\n\nDeclaration of independence\nNorth Macedonia officially celebrates 8 September 1991 as Independence day (Macedonian: Ден на независноста, Den na nezavisnosta), with regard to the referendum endorsing independence from Yugoslavia [118] The anniversary of the start of the Ilinden Uprising (St Elijah's Day) on 2 August is also widely celebrated on an official level as the Day of the Republic.\n\n\n21st century\nA conflict took place between the government and ethnic Albanian insurgents, mostly in the north and west of the country, between February and August 2001 [121] [122] [123] The war ended with the intervention of a NATO ceasefire monitoring force Under the terms of the Ohrid Agreement, the government agreed to devolve greater political power and cultural recognition to the Albanian minority [124] The Albanian side agreed to abandon separatist demands and to recognise all Macedonian institutions fully In addition, according to this accord, the NLA were to disarm and hand over their weapons to a NATO force [125] However the Macedonian security forces had two more armed confrontations with Albanian militant groups, in 2007 and 2015 respectively.\n\n\n2001 insurgency\nA conflict took place between the government and ethnic Albanian insurgents, mostly in the north and west of the country, between February and August 2001 [121] [122] [123] The war ended with the intervention of a NATO ceasefire monitoring force Under the terms of the Ohrid Agreement, the government agreed to devolve greater political power and cultural recognition to the Albanian minority [124] The Albanian side agreed to abandon separatist demands and to recognise all Macedonian institutions fully In addition, according to this accord, the NLA were to disarm and hand over their weapons to a NATO force [125] However the Macedonian security forces had two more armed confrontations with Albanian militant groups, in 2007 and 2015 respectively.\n\n\nAntiquisation\nUpon its coming to power in 2006, but especially since the country's non-invitation to NATO in 2008, the VMRO-DPMNE government pursued a policy of \"Antiquisation\" (\"Antikvizatzija\") as a way of putting pressure on Greece as well as for the purposes of domestic identity-building [129] Statues of Alexander the Great and Philip of Macedon have been erected in several cities across the country Additionally, many pieces of public infrastructure, such as airports, highways, and stadiums were renamed after Alexander and Philip These actions were seen as deliberate provocations in neighbouring Greece, exacerbating the dispute and further stalling the country's EU and NATO applications [130] The policy has also attracted criticism domestically, as well as from EU diplomats, [129] and, following the Prespa agreement, it has been partly reversed after 2016 by the new SDSM government of North Macedonia [131] [132] Moreover, per Prespa agreement both countries have acknowledged that their respective understanding of the terms \"Macedonia\" and \"Macedonian\" refers to a different historical context and cultural heritage.\n\n\nEU and NATO path\nIn August 2017, what was then the Republic of Macedonia signed a friendship agreement with Bulgaria, aiming to end the \"anti-Bulgarian ideology\" in the country and to solve the historical issues between the two.\n\n\nGeography\nNorth Macedonia has a total area of 25,436 km2 (9,821 sq mi) [4] It lies between latitudes 40° and 43° N, and mostly between longitudes 20° and 23° E (a small area lies east of 23°) North Macedonia has some 748 km (465 mi) of boundaries, shared with Serbia (62 km or 39 mi) to the North, Kosovo (159 km or 99 mi) to the northwest, Bulgaria (148 km or 92 mi) to the east, Greece (228 km or 142 mi) to the south, and Albania (151 km or 94 mi) to the west It is a transit way for shipment of goods from Greece, through the Balkans, towards Eastern, Western and Central Europe and through Bulgaria to the east It is part of the larger region of Macedonia, which also includes Greek Macedonia and the Blagoevgrad Province in southwestern Bulgaria.\n\n\nClimate\nFour different seasons are found in the country with warm and dry summers and moderately cold and snowy winters The range of temperatures recorded throughout the year ranges from −20 °C (−4 °F) in winter, to 40 °C (104 °F) in summer Low winter temperatures are influenced by winds from the north while heat seasons during summer arise due to the subtropical pressure of the Aegean Sea and climate influences from the Middle East, with the latter causing dry periods [164] There are three main climatic zones in the country: mildly continental in the north, temperate Mediterranean in the south and mountainous in the zones with high altitude [165] Along the valleys of the Vardar and Strumica rivers, in the regions of Gevgelija, Valandovo, Dojran, Strumica, and Radoviš, the climate is temperate Mediterranean The warmest regions are Demir Kapija and Gevgelija, where the temperature in July and August frequently exceeds 40 °C (104 °F) [166]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nThe flora of North Macedonia is represented by around 210 families, 920 genera, and around 3,700 plant species The most abundant group are the flowering plants with around 3,200 species, followed by mosses (350 species) and ferns (42).\n\n\nPolitics\nNorth Macedonia is a parliamentary democracy with an executive government composed of a coalition of parties from the unicameral legislature (Собрание, Sobranie; Assembly in English) and an independent judicial branch with a constitutional court The Assembly is made up of 120 seats and the members are elected every four years The role of the president is mostly ceremonial, with the real power resting in the hands of the prime minister The president is the commander-in-chief of the state armed forces and a president of the State Security Council The president is elected every five years and he or she can be elected twice at most.\n\n\nNaming dispute\nThe use of the name \"Macedonia\" was disputed between Greece and North Macedonia The specific naming dispute was reignited after the breakup of Yugoslavia and the newly gained independence of the former Socialist Republic of Macedonia in 1991 [186] Greece opposed the use of the name without a geographical qualifier so as to avoid confusion with its own region of Greek Macedonia to the south [187] As some ethnic Greeks identify themselves as Macedonians, unrelated to the Slavic people who are associated with North Macedonia, Greece further objected to the use of the term Macedonian for the neighbouring country's largest ethnic group; it accused the country of appropriating symbols and figures that are historically considered parts of Greece's culture (such as Vergina Sun and Alexander the Great), and of promoting the irredentist concept of a United Macedonia, which would include territories of Greece, Bulgaria, Albania, and Serbia [188]\n\n\nForeign relations\nNorth Macedonia became a member state of the UN on 8 April 1993, eighteen months after its independence from Yugoslavia It was referred to within the UN as \"the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\", until the resolution of the long-running dispute with Greece about the country's name.\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Army of the Republic of North Macedonia (ARSM) is led by the General Staff, below which are the Operations Command, whose forces include the Mechanized Infantry Brigade, the Air Brigade, the Special Operations Regiment, and several independent battalions; the Training and Doctrine Command, which also oversees the Military Reserve Force; and the Logistics Base There is also an Honor Guard Battalion that is directly subordinated to the General Staff [202] The ARSM has 8,000 active personnel and 4,850 reservists, as well as a military budget of US$235 million in 2022 [203] It has been a volunteer military since conscription was ended in 2007 North Macedonia has deployed troops to Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iraq, Kosovo, and Lebanon, as part of NATO, EU, or UN missions [204]\n\n\nHuman rights\nNorth Macedonia is a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights and the UN Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and Convention against Torture, and the Constitution guarantees basic human rights to all Macedonian citizens.\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nNorth Macedonia's statistical regions exist solely for legal and statistical purposes The regions are:\n\n\nEconomy\nRanked as the fourth \"best reformatory state\" out of 178 countries ranked by the World Bank in 2009, North Macedonia has undergone considerable economic reform since independence [208] The country has developed an open economy with trade accounting for more than 90% of GDP in recent years Since 1996, North Macedonia has witnessed steady, though slow, economic growth with GDP growing by 3.1% in 2005 This figure was projected to rise to an average of 5.2% in the 2006–2010 period [209] The government has proven successful in its efforts to combat inflation, with an inflation rate of only 3% in 2006 and 2% in 2007, [208] and has implemented policies focused on attracting foreign investment and promoting the development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\n\n\nTrade\nThe outbreak of the Yugoslav wars and the imposition of sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro caused great damage to the country's economy, with Serbia constituting 60% of its markets before the disintegration of Yugoslavia When Greece imposed a trade embargo on the Republic in 1994–95, the economy was also affected Some relief was afforded by the end of the Bosnian War in November 1995 and the lifting of the Greek embargo, but the Kosovo War of 1999 and the 2001 Albanian crisis caused further destabilisation.\n\n\nTourism\nTourism plays a significant role in the economy of North Macedonia accounting for 6.7% of its GDP in 2016 The annual income from tourism was estimated at 38.5 billion denars (€616 million) in that year [222] Following its independence, the most serious negative impact on tourism performance occurred due to the armed conflicts taking place in 2001 [223] The number of foreign visitors has been on the rise since, with a 14.6% increase in 2011 [224] In 2019, North Macedonia received 1,184,963 tourist arrivals out of which 757,593 foreign [225] Most numerous are tourists from Turkey, neighboring Serbia, Greece and Bulgaria, Poland and other countries of Western Europe [226] The biggest bulk of tourists, approximately 60% of the million tourists that visited the country in 2017, was situated in Skopje and the southwestern region of the country [227]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nNorth Macedonia (along with Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo) belongs to the less-developed southern region of the former Yugoslavia It suffered severe economic difficulties after independence, when the Yugoslav internal market collapsed and subsidies from Belgrade ended In addition, it faced many of the same problems faced by other former socialist East European countries during the transition to a market economy Its main land and rail exports route, through Serbia, remains unreliable with high transit costs, thereby affecting the export of its formerly highly profitable, early vegetables market to Germany.\n\n\nTransport\nNorth Macedonia (along with Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo) belongs to the less-developed southern region of the former Yugoslavia It suffered severe economic

of Skopje, St Clement of Ohrid University of Bitola, Goce Delčev University of Štip, State University of Tetova and University of Information Science and Technology \"St Paul The Apostle\" in Ohrid There are a number of private university institutions, such as the European University, [229] Slavic University in Sveti Nikole, the South East European University and others North Macedonia was ranked 58th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024 [230]\n\n\nDemographics\nThe results from the last 2021 census show a population of 1,836,713 The population density of the country is 72.2 persons per km2 and the average age of the population is 40.08 years 598,632 households were recorded with an average number of household members of 3.06 The gender balance of the country is 50.4% female to 49.6% male [232]\n\n\nReligion\nReligion in North Macedonia (2021) [234]\n\n\nLanguages\nThe national and official language in all aspects of the whole territory of North Macedonia and in its international relations is the Macedonian language Since 2019 Albanian is co-official at a state level (excluding defense, central police and monetary policy) [245] Macedonian belongs to the Eastern branch of the South Slavic language group, while Albanian occupies an independent branch of the Indo-European family of languages In municipalities where at least 20% of the population is part of another ethnic minority, those individual languages are used for official purposes in local government, alongside Macedonian and Albanian or just Macedonian.\n\n\nCities\nNorth Macedonia has a rich cultural heritage in art, architecture, poetry and music It has many ancient, protected religious sites Poetry, cinema, and music festivals are held annually Macedonian music styles developed under the strong influence of Byzantine church music North Macedonia has a significant number of preserved Byzantine fresco paintings, mainly from the period between the 11th and 16th centuries There are several thousands of square metres of fresco painting preserved, the major part of which is in very good condition and represent masterworks of the Macedonian school of ecclesiastical painting.\n\n\nCulture\nNorth Macedonia has a rich cultural heritage in art, architecture, poetry and music It has many ancient, protected religious sites Poetry, cinema, and music festivals are held

lesser extent Italian, German and Eastern European (especially Hungarian) ones [253] The relatively warm climate in North Macedonia provides excellent growth conditions for a variety of vegetables, herbs and fruits Thus, Macedonian cuisine is particularly diverse.\n\n\nSport\nFootball, handball, and basketball are the most popular sports in North Macedonia The North Macedonia national football team is controlled by the Football Federation of Macedonia Their home stadium is the Toše Proeski Arena In November 2003, to celebrate UEFA's jubilee, Darko Pančev was selected as the Golden Player of Macedonia as their most outstanding player of the past 50 years [255] He was the winner of the European Golden Boot award in 1991 and he is best known for scoring the winning penalty in the 1991 European Cup Final, bringing Red Star Belgrade the most prestigious trophy in European football for the first time in its 50-year existence In 2020, the national team qualified for UEFA Euro 2020 (held in 2021), their first major tournament in the country's history [256]\n\n\nCinema\nThe history of film making in the country dates back over 110 years [citation needed] The first film to be produced on the territory of the present-day country was made in 1895 by Janaki and Milton Manaki in Bitola Throughout the past century, the medium of film has depicted the history, culture and everyday life of the Macedonian people Over the years many Macedonian films have been presented at film festivals around the world and several of these films have won prestigious awards The first Macedonian feature film was Frosina, released in 1952 and directed by Vojislav Nanović [258]\n\n\nMedia\nThe oldest newspaper in the country is Nova Makedonija from 1944 Other well known newspaper and

It borders Kosovo to the northwest, Serbia to the north, Bulgaria to the east, Greece to the south, and Albania to the west. The country has a rich history and culture, with a unique blend of Slavic, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern influences. North Macedonia gained independence from Yugoslavia in 1991 and has since become a member of the United Nations, the Council of Europe, and the European Union.\n\nNames and etymology\nThe state's name derives from the Greek word Μακεδονία (Makedonía), a kingdom (later, region) named after the ancient Macedonians. Their name, Μακεδόνες (Makedónes), ultimately derives from the ancient Greek adjective μακεδνός (makednós), meaning 'tall' or 'taper', which shares the same root as the adjective μακρός (makrós, 'long, tall, high') in ancient Greek. The name is believed to have originally meant either 'highlanders' or 'the tall ones', possibly descriptive of the people.\n\nHistory\nNorth Macedonia geographically roughly corresponds to the ancient kingdom of Paeonia, which was located immediately north of the ancient kingdom of Macedonia. Paeonia was inhabited by the Paeonians, whilst the northwest was inhabited by the Dardani and the southwest by tribes known historically as the Enchelae, Pelagones, and Lyncestae; the latter two are generally regarded as Molossian tribes of the northwestern Greek group, whilst the former two are considered Illyrian.\n\nEarly history\nNorth Macedonia geographically roughly corresponds to the ancient kingdom of Paeonia, which was located immediately north of the ancient kingdom of Macedonia.

They were led by Pannonian Avars. The Slavs settled on places of earlier settlements and probably merged later with the local populations to form mixed Byzantine-Slavic communities. Historical records document that in c. 680 a Bulgar ruler called Kuber led a group of largely Christians called Sermesianoi, who were his subjects, and they settled in the region of Pelagonia.\n\nOttoman period\nThe Kingdom of Prilep was one of the short-lived states that emerged from the collapse of the Serbian Empire in the 14th century, which was seized by the Ottomans at the end of the same century.

Following the partition, an anti-Bulgarian campaign was carried out in the areas under Serbian and Greek control.\n\nWorld War I\nDuring the First World War, most of today's North Macedonia was part of the Bulgarian occupied zone of Serbia after the country was invaded by the Central Powers in the fall of 1915. The region was known as the \"Military Inspection Area of Macedonia\" and was administered by a Bulgarian military commander. A policy of Bulgarisation of the region and its population was immediately initiated.\n\nKingdom of Yugoslavia\nAfter the capitulation of Bulgaria and the end of the First World War, the area returned under Belgrade control as part of the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The area saw a reintroduction of anti-Bulgarian measures. Bulgarian teachers and clergy were expelled, Bulgarian language signs and books removed, and all Bulgarian organisations dissolved.\n\nWorld War II\nDuring World War II, Yugoslavia was occupied by the Axis powers from 1941 to 1945. The Vardar Banovina was divided between Bulgaria and Italian-occupied Albania. Bulgarian Action Committees were established to prepare the region for the new Bulgarian administration and army.\n\nSocialist Yugoslavia\nIn December 1944, the Anti-fascist Assembly for the National Liberation of Macedonia (ASNOM) proclaimed the People's Republic of Macedonia as part of the People's Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. ASNOM remained an acting government until the end of the war. The Macedonian alphabet was codified by linguists of ASNOM, who based their alphabet on the phonetic alphabet of Vuk Stefanović Karadžić and the principles of Krste Petkov Misirkov.\n\nDeclaration of independence\nNorth Macedonia officially celebrates 8 September 1991 as Independence day (Macedonian: Ден на независноста, Den na nezavisnosta), with regard to the referendum endorsing independence from Yugoslavia. The anniversary of the start of the Ilinden Uprising (St Elijah's Day) on 2 August is also widely celebrated on an official level as the Day of the Republic.\n\n21st century\nA conflict took place between the government and ethnic Albanian insurgents, mostly in the north and west of the country, between February and August 2001. The war ended with the intervention of a NATO ceasefire monitoring force. Under the terms of the Ohrid Agreement, the government agreed to devolve greater political power and cultural recognition to the Albanian minority.\n\nGeography\nNorth Macedonia has a total area of 25,436 km2 (9,821 sq mi).

state's name derives from the Greek word Μακεδονία (Makedonía), [10] [11] a kingdom (later, region) named after the ancient Macedonians Their name, Μακεδόνες (Makedónes), ultimately derives from the ancient Greek adjective μακεδνός (makednós), meaning 'tall' or 'taper', [12] which shares the same root as the adjective μακρός (makrós, 'long, tall, high') in ancient Greek [13] The name is believed to have originally meant either 'highlanders' or 'the tall ones', possibly descriptive of the people [11] [14] [15] According to linguist Robert S P Beekes, both terms are of pre-Greek substrate origin and cannot be explained in terms of Indo-European morphology [16] According to linguist Filip De Decker, Beekes's arguments are insufficiently supported [17]\n\n\nHistory\nNorth Macedonia geographically roughly corresponds to the ancient kingdom of Paeonia, [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] which was located immediately north of the ancient kingdom of Macedonia [38] Paeonia was inhabited by the Paeonians, whilst the northwest was inhabited by the Dardani and the southwest by tribes known historically as the Enchelae, Pelagones, and Lyncestae; the latter two are generally regarded as Molossian tribes of the northwestern Greek group, whilst the former two are considered Illyrian [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] The headwaters of the Axios river are mentioned by Homer as the home of the Paeonians allies of Troy [45]\n\n\nEarly history\nNorth Macedonia geographically roughly corresponds to the ancient kingdom of Paeonia, [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] which was located immediately north of the ancient kingdom of Macedonia [38] Paeonia was inhabited by the Paeonians, whilst the northwest was inhabited by the Dardani and the southwest by tribes known historically as the Enchelae, Pelagones, and Lyncestae; the latter two are generally regarded as Molossian tribes of the northwestern Greek group, whilst the former two are considered Illyrian [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] The headwaters of the Axios river are mentioned by Homer as the home of the Paeonians allies of Troy [45]\n\n\nMedieval period\nSlavic tribes settled in the Balkan region including North Macedonia by the late 6th century AD They were led by Pannonian Avars [56] [57] [58] The Slavs settled on places of earlier settlements and probably merged later with the local populations to form mixed Byzantine-Slavic communities [59] Historical records document that in c. 680 a Bulgar ruler called Kuber led a group of largely Christians called Sermesianoi, who were his subjects, and they settled in the region of Pelagonia They may have consisted of Bulgars, Byzantines, Slavs and even Germanic tribes [60] There is no more information of Kuber's life [61] [62] Presian's reign apparently coincides with the extension of Bulgarian control over the Slavic tribes in and around Macedonia The Slavic tribes that settled in the region of Macedonia converted to Christianity around the 9th century during the reign of Tsar Boris I of Bulgaria The Ohrid Literary School became one of the two major cultural centres of the First Bulgarian Empire, along with the Preslav Literary School Established in Ohrid in 886 by Saint Clement of Ohrid on the order of Boris I, the Ohrid Literary School was involved in the spreading of the Cyrillic script [63]\n\n\nOttoman period\nThe Kingdom of Prilep was one of the short-lived states that emerged from the collapse of the Serbian Empire in the 14th century, which was seized by the Ottomans at the end of the same century [64] Gradually, all of the central Balkans were conquered by the Ottoman Empire and remained under its domination for five centuries as part of the province or Eyalet of Rumelia The name Rumelia (Turkish: Rumeli) means \"Land of the Romans\" in Turkish, referring to the lands conquered by the Ottoman Turks from the Byzantine Empire [65] Over the centuries, Rumelia Eyalet was reduced in size through administrative reforms, until by the 19th century it consisted of a region of central Albania and western North Macedonia with its capital at Manastir or present-day Bitola [66] Rumelia Eyalet was abolished in 1867 and that territory of Macedonia subsequently became part of vilayets of Manastir, Kosova and Selanik until the end of Ottoman rule in 1912 With the beginning of the Bulgarian National Revival in the 19th century, many of the reformers were from this region, including the Miladinov brothers, [67] Rajko Žinzifov, Joakim Krčovski, [68] Kiril Pejčinoviḱ [69] and others The bishoprics of Skopje, Debar, Bitola, Ohrid, Veles, and Strumica voted to join the Bulgarian Exarchate after it was established in 1870 [70]\n\n\nModern period\nSeveral movements whose goals were the establishment of an autonomous Macedonia, which would encompass the entire region of Macedonia, began to arise in the late 19th century; the earliest of these was the Bulgarian Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Committees, later becoming Secret Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (SMARO) In 1905 it was renamed the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (IMARO), and after World War I the organisation separated into the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) and the Internal Thracian Revolutionary Organisation (ITRO) [71]\n\n\nMacedonian autonomism\nSeveral movements whose goals were the establishment of an autonomous Macedonia, which would encompass the entire region of Macedonia, began to arise in the late 19th century; the earliest of these was the Bulgarian Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Committees, later becoming Secret Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (SMARO) In 1905 it was renamed the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (IMARO), and after World War I the organisation separated into the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) and the Internal Thracian Revolutionary Organisation (ITRO) [71]\n\n\nKingdom of Serbia\nFollowing the two Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913 and the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, most of its European-held territories were divided between Greece, Bulgaria and Serbia [78] Almost the territory that was to become North Macedonia was annexed by Serbia conforming to the treaty of peace concluded at Bucharest [79] However, Strumica region was passed to Bulgaria Following the partition, an anti-Bulgarian campaign was carried out in the areas under Serbian and Greek control [80] As many as 641 Bulgarian schools and 761 churches were closed by the Serbs, while Exarchist clergy and teachers were expelled [80] The use of all Macedonian dialects and standard Bulgarian were proscribed [80] IMRO, together with local Albanians, organised the Ohrid–Debar uprising against the Serbian rule Within a few days the rebels captured the towns of Gostivar, Struga and Ohrid, expelling the Serbian troops According to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace report, a Serbian army of 100,000 regulars suppressed the uprising Many were killed and tens of thousands refugees fled to Bulgaria and Albania [81] [82]\n\n\nWorld War I\nDuring the First World War, most of today's North Macedonia was part of the Bulgarian occupied zone of Serbia after the country was invaded by the Central Powers in the fall of 1915 [80] The region was known as the \"Military Inspection Area of Macedonia\" and was administered by a Bulgarian military commander [83] A policy of Bulgarisation of the region and its population was immediately initiated, [84] [85] during the period the IMRO arose from a clandestine organisation to serve as gendarmerie, taking control of the whole police structure, enforcing the Bulgarisation of the region [84] According to Robert Gerwarth, the Bulgarian denationalisation policy, including its paramilitary aspect, was almost identical in its intent and execution to the Serbian policy that preceded it [84]\n\n\nKingdom of Yugoslavia\nAfter the capitulation of Bulgaria and the end of the First World War, the area returned under Belgrade control as part of the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes [89] and saw a reintroduction of anti-Bulgarian measures Bulgarian teachers and clergy were expelled, Bulgarian language signs and books removed, and all Bulgarian organisations dissolved [80] Also after the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine, the Strumica region was annexed to Serbian Macedonia in 1919.\n\n\nWorld War II\nDuring World War II, Yugoslavia was occupied by the Axis powers from 1941 to 1945 The Vardar Banovina was divided between Bulgaria and Italian-occupied Albania Bulgarian Action Committees were established to prepare the region for the new Bulgarian administration and army [101] The committees were mostly formed by former members of IMRO and Macedonian Youth Secret Revolutionary Organization (MYSRO, but some IMRO (United) former members also participated [102] [103]\n\n\nSocialist Yugoslavia\nIn December 1944, the Anti-fascist Assembly for the National Liberation of Macedonia (ASNOM) proclaimed the People's Republic of Macedonia as part of the People's Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [114] ASNOM remained an acting government until the end of the war The Macedonian alphabet was codified by linguists of ASNOM, who based their alphabet on the phonetic alphabet of Vuk Stefanović Karadžić and the principles of Krste Petkov Misirkov During the civil war in Greece (1946–1949), Macedonian communist insurgents supported the Greek communists Many refugees fled to the Socialist Republic of Macedonia from there The state removed \"Socialist\" from its name in 1991 when it peacefully seceded from Yugoslavia.\n\n\nDeclaration of independence\nNorth Macedonia officially celebrates 8 September 1991 as Independence day (Macedonian: Ден на независноста, Den na nezavisnosta), with regard to the referendum endorsing independence from Yugoslavia [118] The anniversary of the start of the Ilinden Uprising (St Elijah's Day) on 2 August is also widely celebrated on an official level as the Day of the Republic.\n\n\n21st century\nA conflict took place between the government and ethnic Albanian insurgents, mostly in the north and west of the country, between February and August 2001 [121] [122] [123] The war ended with the intervention of a NATO ceasefire monitoring force Under the terms of the Ohrid Agreement, the government agreed to devolve greater political power and cultural recognition to the Albanian minority [124] The Albanian side agreed to abandon separatist demands and to recognise all Macedonian institutions fully In addition, according to this accord, the NLA were to disarm and hand over their weapons to a NATO force [125] However the Macedonian security forces had two more armed confrontations with Albanian militant groups, in 2007 and 2015 respectively.\n\n\n2001 insurgency\nA conflict took place between the government and ethnic Albanian insurgents, mostly in the north and west of the country, between February and August 2001 [121] [122] [123] The war ended with the intervention of a NATO ceasefire

the Macedonian security forces had two more armed confrontations with Albanian militant groups, in 2007 and 2015 respectively.\n\n\nAntiquisation\nUpon its coming to power in 2006, but especially since the country's non-invitation to NATO in 2008, the VMRO-DPMNE government pursued a policy of \"Antiquisation\" (\"Antikvizatzija\") as a way of putting pressure on Greece as well as for the purposes of domestic identity-building [129] Statues of Alexander the Great and Philip of Macedon have been erected in several cities across the country Additionally, many pieces of public infrastructure, such as airports, highways, and stadiums were renamed after Alexander and Philip These actions were seen as deliberate provocations in neighbouring Greece, exacerbating the dispute and further stalling the country's EU and NATO applications [130] The policy has also attracted criticism domestically, as well as from EU diplomats, [129] and, following the Prespa agreement, it has been partly reversed after 2016 by the new SDSM government of North Macedonia [131] [132] Moreover, per Prespa agreement both countries have acknowledged that their respective understanding of the terms \"Macedonia\" and \"Macedonian\" refers to a different historical context and cultural heritage.\n\n\nEU and NATO path\nIn August 2017, what was then the Republic of Macedonia signed a friendship agreement with Bulgaria, aiming to end the \"anti-Bulgarian ideology\" in the country and to solve the historical issues between the two.\n\n\nGeography\nNorth Macedonia has a total area of 25,436 km2 (9,821 sq mi) [4] It lies between latitudes 40° and 43° N, and mostly between longitudes 20° and 23° E (a small area lies east of 23°) North Macedonia has some 748 km (465 mi) of boundaries, shared with Serbia (62 km or 39 mi) to the North, Kosovo (159 km or 99 mi) to the northwest, Bulgaria (148 km or 92 mi) to the east, Greece (228 km or 142 mi) to the south, and Albania (151 km or 94 mi) to the west It is a transit way for shipment of goods from Greece, through the Balkans, towards Eastern, Western and Central Europe and through Bulgaria to the east It is part of the larger region of Macedonia, which also includes Greek Macedonia and the Blagoevgrad Province in southwestern Bulgaria.\n\n\nClimate\nFour different seasons are found in the country with warm and dry summers and moderately cold and snowy winters The range of temperatures recorded throughout the year ranges from −20 °C (−4 °F) in winter, to 40 °C (104 °F) in summer Low winter temperatures are influenced by winds from the north while heat seasons during summer arise due to the subtropical pressure of the Aegean Sea and climate influences from the Middle East, with the latter causing dry periods [164] There are three main climatic zones in the country: mildly continental in the north, temperate Mediterranean in the south and mountainous in the zones with high altitude [165] Along the valleys of the Vardar and Strumica rivers, in the regions of Gevgelija, Valandovo, Dojran, Strumica, and Radoviš, the climate is temperate Mediterranean The warmest regions are Demir Kapija and Gevgelija, where the temperature in July and August frequently exceeds 40 °C (104 °F) [166]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nThe flora of North Macedonia is represented by around 210 families, 920 genera, and around 3,700 plant species The most abundant group are the flowering plants with around 3,200 species, followed by mosses (350 species) and ferns (42).\n\n\nPolitics\nNorth Macedonia is a parliamentary democracy with an executive government composed of a coalition of parties from the unicameral legislature (Собрание, Sobranie; Assembly in English) and an independent judicial branch with a constitutional court The Assembly is made up of 120 seats and the members are elected every four years The role of the president is mostly ceremonial, with the real power resting in the hands of the prime minister The president is the commander-in-chief of the state armed forces and a president of the State Security Council The president is elected every five years and he or she can be elected twice at most.\n\n\nNaming dispute\nThe use of the name \"Macedonia\" was disputed between Greece and North Macedonia The specific naming dispute was reignited after the breakup of Yugoslavia and the newly gained independence of the former Socialist Republic of Macedonia in 1991 [186] Greece opposed the use of the name without a geographical qualifier so as to avoid confusion with its own region of Greek Macedonia to the south [187] As some ethnic Greeks identify themselves as Macedonians, unrelated to the Slavic people who are associated with North Macedonia, Greece further objected to the use of the term Macedonian for the neighbouring country's largest ethnic group; it accused the country of appropriating symbols and figures that are historically considered parts of Greece's culture (such as Vergina Sun and Alexander the Great), and of promoting the irredentist concept of a United Macedonia, which would include territories of Greece, Bulgaria, Albania, and Serbia [188]\n\n\nForeign relations\nNorth Macedonia became a member state of the UN on 8 April 1993, eighteen months after its independence from Yugoslavia It was referred to within the UN as \"the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\", until the resolution of the long-running dispute with Greece about the country's name.\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Army of the Republic of North Macedonia (ARSM) is led by the General Staff, below which are the Operations Command, whose forces include the Mechanized Infantry Brigade, the Air Brigade, the Special Operations Regiment, and several independent battalions; the Training and Doctrine Command, which also oversees the Military Reserve Force; and the Logistics Base There is also an Honor Guard Battalion that is directly subordinated to the General Staff [202] The ARSM has 8,000 active personnel and 4,850 reservists, as well as a military budget of US$235 million in 2022 [203] It has been a volunteer military since conscription was ended in 2007 North Macedonia has deployed troops to Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iraq, Kosovo, and Lebanon, as part of NATO, EU, or UN missions [204]\n\n\nHuman rights\nNorth Macedonia is a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights and the UN Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and Convention against Torture, and the Constitution guarantees basic human rights to all Macedonian citizens.\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nNorth Macedonia's statistical regions exist solely for legal and statistical purposes The regions are:\n\n\nEconomy\nRanked as the fourth \"best reformatory state\" out of 178 countries ranked by the World Bank in 2009, North Macedonia has undergone considerable economic reform since independence [208] The country has developed an open economy with trade accounting for more than 90% of GDP in recent years Since 1996, North Macedonia has witnessed steady, though slow, economic growth with GDP growing by 3.1% in 2005 This figure was projected to rise to an average of 5.2% in the 2006–2010 period [209] The government has proven successful in its efforts to combat inflation, with an inflation rate of only 3% in 2006 and 2% in 2007, [208] and has implemented policies focused on attracting foreign investment and promoting the development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\n\n\nTrade\nThe outbreak of the Yugoslav wars and the imposition of sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro caused great damage to the country's economy, with Serbia constituting 60% of its markets before the disintegration of Yugoslavia When Greece imposed a trade embargo on the Republic in 1994–95, the economy was also affected Some relief was afforded by the end of the Bosnian War in November 1995 and the lifting of the Greek embargo, but the Kosovo War of 1999 and the 2001 Albanian crisis caused further destabilisation.\n\n\nTourism\nTourism plays a significant role in the economy of North Macedonia accounting for 6.7% of its GDP in 2016 The annual income from tourism was estimated at 38.5 billion denars (€616 million) in that year [222] Following its independence, the most serious negative impact on tourism performance occurred due to the armed conflicts taking place in 2001 [223] The number of foreign visitors has been on the rise since, with a 14.6% increase in 2011 [224] In 2019, North Macedonia received 1,184,963 tourist arrivals out of which 757,593 foreign [225] Most numerous are tourists from Turkey, neighboring Serbia, Greece and Bulgaria, Poland and other countries of Western Europe [226] The biggest bulk of tourists, approximately 60% of the million tourists that visited the country in 2017, was situated in Skopje and the southwestern region of the country [227]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nNorth Macedonia (along with Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo) belongs to the less-developed southern region of the former Yugoslavia It suffered severe economic difficulties after independence, when the Yugoslav internal market collapsed and subsidies from Belgrade ended In addition, it faced many of the same problems faced by other former socialist East European countries during the transition to a market economy Its main land and rail exports route, through Serbia, remains unreliable with high transit costs, thereby affecting the export of its formerly highly profitable, early vegetables market to Germany.\n\n\nTransport\nNorth Macedonia (along with Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo) belongs to the less-developed southern region of the former Yugoslavia It suffered severe economic

She has appeared in numerous films and television shows, including the James Bond film \"Quantum of Solace,\" \"Hanna,\" and \"Oblivion.\" Kurylenko's career spans over two decades, with her early beginnings as a model and her subsequent transition to acting.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nOlga Kostyantynivna Kurylenko was born on 14 November 1979 in Berdyansk, a port city in Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union. Her father, Konstantin Kurylenko, is of Ukrainian origin, and her mother, Marina Alyabusheva, who teaches art and is an exhibited artist, was born in Irkutsk Oblast, Russia, and is of Russian and Belarusian ancestry. Kurylenko's parents divorced when she was three years old, and she was raised by her mother. Kurylenko rarely had contact with her father, meeting him for the first time after the split at age eight and later at age thirteen.\n\nGrowing up, Kurylenko's mother encouraged her to pursue her passion for art, which would later influence her career as an actress. Kurylenko's early life was marked by her love for dance and music, and she began taking ballet lessons at the age of five. Her mother's artistic background also exposed Kurylenko to the world of art, which would later shape her interests and career choices.\n\n**Career**\n\nKurylenko moved to Moscow at the age of 15, where she began her career as a model. Her first modeling contract was with a Russian modeling agency, which led to her appearances in several Russian fashion magazines. At the age of 16, she moved to Paris, where she signed a contract with the Paris-based Madison modeling agency. It was during this time that she met her publicist, Valérie Rosen, who would later become a close friend and mentor.\n\nWhile working as a model in Paris, Kurylenko supported her mother in Ukraine, who was struggling to make ends meet. Kurylenko's mother was an exhibited artist, and she would often send her daughter's artwork back to Ukraine to sell and raise funds. This experience taught Kurylenko the value of hard work and the importance of supporting one's family.\n\nIn 1996, Kurylenko appeared on the covers of Vogue and Elle magazines, cementing her status as a leading model in the industry. Her career as a model spanned over a decade, during which she worked with top designers and fashion brands.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nKurylenko acquired French citizenship in 2001, which she called \"a practical decision\" because it was easier to travel with a French passport without a visa, as opposed to traveling with a Ukrainian passport. At the time, Kurylenko was living in Paris and working as a model, and she felt that French citizenship would open up more opportunities for her.\n\nIn 2000, Kurylenko married French fashion photographer Cedric van Mol, whom she divorced four years later. Kurylenko has said that she was young and naive at the time of her marriage, and that she was not ready for the responsibilities that came with it. After her divorce, Kurylenko focused on her career and continued to work as a model.\n\nIn 2006, Kurylenko married American mobile phone accessory entrepreneur Damian Gabrielle, whom she divorced the next year. Kurylenko has said that she learned a lot from her second marriage, but that it ultimately did not work out.\n\nIn 2009, Kurylenko moved to London, where she began to focus on her acting career. She has said that she was drawn to the UK because of its thriving film industry and the opportunities it offered for actresses.\n\n**Filmography**\n\nKurylenko's film career began in the early 2000s, with her appearances in several French and Russian films. Some of her notable films include:\n\n* **Hitman** (2007) - Kurylenko played the role of Natalya, a beautiful and talented assassin.\n* **Quantum of Solace** (2008) - Kurylenko played the role of Camille Montes, a Bolivian secret agent.\n* **Hanna** (2011) - Kurylenko played the role of Marissa Wiegler, a CIA agent.\n* **Oblivion** (2013) - Kurylenko played the role of Julia, a survivor of a post-apocalyptic world.\n* **The Water Diviner** (2014) - Kurylenko played the role of Ayshe, a Turkish woman who helps a Turkish soldier find his sons.\n\nKurylenko has also appeared in several television shows, including **Sense8** and **The Man Who Killed Don Quixote**.\n\n**Awards and Nominations**\n\nKurylenko has been nominated for several awards throughout her career, including:\n\n* **LAFCA Award for Best Actress** for her role in **Quantum of Solace**\n* **MTV Movie Award for Best Villain** for her role in **Hanna**\n* **Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actress: Action** for her role in **Oblivion**\n\n**References**\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Olga Kurylenko at IMDb\n* Olga Kurylenko on Instagram\n* Olga Kurylenko on Twitter", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Olga_Kurylenko\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nOlga Kostyantynivna Kurylenko [1] was born on 14 November 1979 [2] in Berdyansk, a port city in Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union [3] Her father, Konstantin Kurylenko, is of Ukrainian origin, and her mother, Marina Alyabusheva—who teaches art and is an exhibited artist—was born in Irkutsk Oblast, Russia and is of Russian and Belarusian ancestry Kurylenko's parents divorced when she was three years old, and she was raised by her mother Kurylenko rarely had contact with her father, meeting him for the first time after the split at age eight and later at age thirteen [4] [5]\n\n\nCareer\nKurylenko moved to Moscow at age 15 At age 16, she moved to Paris [6] In 1996, Kurylenko signed a contract with the Paris-based Madison modelling agency where she met her publicist Valérie Rosen [7] The following year, by the age of 18, she had appeared on the covers of Vogue and Elle magazines [8] While working as a model in Paris, Kurylenko supported her mother in Ukraine [9]\n\n\nPersonal life\nKurylenko acquired French citizenship in 2001, [29] which she called \"a practical decision\" because it was easier to travel with a French passport without a visa, as opposed to travelling with a Ukrainian passport [30] In 2000, Kurylenko married French fashion photographer Cedric van Mol, whom she divorced four years later [31] In 2006, Kurylenko married American mobile phone accessory entrepreneur Damian Gabrielle, whom she divorced the next year [32] She moved to London in 2009 [33] [34] [35]\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nVideo game\n\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

not legitimate, or the selection procedure not objective, transparent and non-discriminatory, or the team is perceived by the public as qualifying unfairly A suspended domestic competition may also be

The Solar Eclipse of April 20, 2023, was a rare and spectacular event that was visible from certain parts of the world.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nSolar eclipses are relatively rare occurrences, and each eclipse is a unique event that offers a glimpse into the workings of the solar system. The Solar Eclipse of April 20, 2023, was a member of a semester series of solar eclipses, which repeat approximately every 177 days and 4 hours at alternating nodes of the Moon's orbit. This eclipse was also part of a longer cycle of eclipses, including a Saros series, a Metonic series, and an Inex series.\n\n**Eclipse Details**\n\nThe Solar Eclipse of April 20, 2023, was a hybrid solar eclipse, meaning that it started as an annular eclipse (with the Moon appearing smaller than the Sun) and gradually transitioned into a total eclipse (with the Moon covering the entire Sun). The eclipse was visible from parts of Australia, East Timor, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.\n\n**Gallery**\n\n| Time | Location | Eclipse Type | Duration |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 08:00 UTC | Sydney, Australia | Annular | 2 minutes 30 seconds |\n| 09:00 UTC | Darwin, Australia | Annular | 2 minutes 45 seconds |\n| 10:00 UTC | Jakarta, Indonesia | Annular | 3 minutes 15 seconds |\n| 11:00 UTC | Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia | Annular | 3 minutes 30 seconds |\n| 12:00 UTC | Manila, Philippines | Annular | 3 minutes 45 seconds |\n| 13:00 UTC | Hanoi, Vietnam | Annular | 4 minutes 0 seconds |\n\n**Australia**\n\nThe Solar Eclipse of April 20, 2023, was visible from parts of Australia, including the cities of Sydney, Darwin, and Perth.

Weah Sr., [9] was a mechanic [10] while his mother, Anna Quaye Weah (d 2013), [11] was a merchant [10] He has three brothers, William, Moses, and Wolo [11] He was one of thirteen children largely raised by his devoutly Christian paternal grandmother, [10] [7] Emma Klonjlaleh Brown after his parents separated [7] when Weah was still a baby [10] He attended middle school at Muslim Congress and high school at Wells Hairston High School and reportedly dropped out in his final year of studies [12]\n\n\nFootball career\nWeah began to play football for Young Survivors, a club based in Clara Town, in 1981 at the age of 15 [13] Jason Burke, writing for The Observer, described how Weah scored \"two spectacular goals\" on his debut, \"one hit from such a tight angle that it went in-off having struck both posts\" [14] In his three years with Young Survivors, the club earned two promotions, from the fourth level of football in Liberia to the second [14] He signed for Liberian Premier League club Bong Range United in 1984, where he played for one season, before joining Mighty Barrolle, one of the biggest clubs in Liberia [13] Weah was not a regular starter for Mighty Barrolle despite scoring regularly, which prompted a move to their rivals, Invincible Eleven, in 1986 [13] He helped the club win the 1987 Liberian Premier League title, [15] was the league's top scorer, and was named as the league's player of the season [16] Before his football career allowed him to move abroad, Weah worked for the Liberia Telecommunications Corporation as a switchboard operator [8] He signed for Cameroonian Premier League club Tonnerre Yaoundé in 1987 after impressing during a match against them, and scored twice on his debut against Canon Yaoundé [16]\n\n\nClub career\nWeah began

Chelsea where he instantly endeared himself to their fans by scoring the winner against rivals Tottenham Hotspur on his debut, [30] and scored further league goals against Wimbledon [31] and Liverpool [32] He also scored twice in Chelsea's victorious 1999–2000 FA Cup netting crucial goals against Leicester City [33] and Gillingham [34] This led to him starting in the final, which Chelsea won 1–0 [35]\n\n\nInternational career\nSince making his debut for the Liberia national team against Burkina Faso on 23 February 1986, Weah played 75 games, scoring 18 goals [43] Representing one of the smaller nations in world football and perennial underdogs, Weah did much to support the national squad: aside from being the team's star player, he also later coached the squad and even funded his national side to a large extent Despite his efforts, he was unsuccessful in helping Liberia qualify for a single FIFA World Cup, falling just a point short in qualifying for the 2002 tournament However, he did help Liberia to qualify for the African Cup of Nations on two occasions: Weah represented his country in the 1996 and 2002 editions of the tournament, although Liberia failed to make it out of their group both times, suffering first-round eliminations [21]\n\n\nStyle of play\nDuring his prime in the 1990s, Weah was regarded as one of the best strikers in the world He was lauded for his speed, work rate, stamina, and attacking instincts, as well as his physical and athletic attributes, which he combined with his finishing, technical ability, and creativity [21] [48] A fast, powerful, physically strong player, with an eye for goal, many observers agree that he successfully filled the void left in the Milan attack by club great Marco van Basten [21] [19] [49] In addition to his pace, acceleration, dribbling skills, and goalscoring ability, as a multi-functional forward Weah was also a team player who was capable of creating chances and assisting goals for teammates [50] [51]\nAlong with Ronaldo and Romário, Weah was viewed as a modern, new style of striker in the 1990s who would also operate outside the penalty area and run with the ball towards goal, at a time when strikers primarily operated inside the penalty area where they would receive the ball from teammates [21] [52] [53] Among the next generation of strikers who were inspired, Thierry Henry states, \"George Weah, Romário, and Ronaldo changed the game for me It was the first time as a striker I saw players that could score on their own Pick the ball up anywhere and score Before as a number nine, people would say ' Stay within the line of the box, don't move too much, don't go to the wings, don't drop, stay.' Then I saw George Weah And then I saw Ronaldo And I saw Romário differently before those two And it was like 'hang on a minute, someone has lied to me'.\" [54]\n\n\nPlayer profile\nDuring his prime in the 1990s, Weah was regarded as one of the best strikers in the world He was lauded for his speed, work rate, stamina, and attacking instincts, as well as his physical and athletic attributes, which he combined with his finishing, technical ability, and creativity [21] [48] A fast, powerful, physically strong player, with an eye for goal, many observers agree that he successfully filled the void left in the Milan attack by club great Marco van Basten [21] [19] [49] In addition to his pace, acceleration, dribbling skills, and goalscoring ability, as a multi-functional forward Weah was also a team player who was capable of creating chances and assisting goals for teammates [50] [51]\nAlong with Ronaldo and Romário, Weah was viewed as a modern, new style of striker in the 1990s who would also operate outside the penalty area and run with the ball towards goal, at a time when strikers primarily operated inside the penalty area where they would receive the ball from teammates [21] [52] [53] Among the next generation of strikers who were inspired, Thierry Henry states, \"George Weah, Romário, and Ronaldo changed the game for me It was the first time as a striker I saw players that could score on their own Pick the ball up anywhere and score Before as a number nine, people would say ' Stay within the line of the box, don't move too much, don't go to the wings, don't drop, stay.'

of the Year three times and the first African to win the Ballon d'Or and be named FIFA World Player of the Year, Weah's prominence in the 1990s led him to be nicknamed \"King George\" 90min included him in their list of the 50 greatest players of all time [55] Weah is often hailed as one of the greatest African footballers of all time, [45] [56] being named African Player of the Century in 1996, [57] and often ranked among the three greatest African strikers ever, alongside Didier Drogba and Samuel Eto'o [58] [59] In 2013, Milan great Franco Baresi named Weah in the greatest XI he has ever played with [60] FourFourTwo magazine named Weah one of the best players never to win the UEFA Champions League [61] A number of publications, including Scott Murray of The Guardian and Kevin Baxter

country, in contrast with his Harvard-educated opponent, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf Analysts also noted Weah's lack of experience, calling him a \"babe-in-the-woods\", while Sirleaf had served as minister of finance in the William Tolbert administration in the 1970s and had held positions at Citibank, the World Bank and the United Nations Weah's eligibility to run for presidency was also called into

Montserrado County senatorial by-election [130] Some analysts saw these moves as preparation for a repeat run for the presidency in 2011, [131] and Weah did indeed later announce his intention to challenge Sirleaf in the 2011 election [132] After a series of failed alliances with other opposition parties, the Congress for Democratic Change chose Weah as its 2011 vice presidential candidate, running with presidential candidate Winston Tubman [133] The Tubman/ Weah ticket managed to capture 32.7% of the vote in the first round with Sirleaf getting 43.9% of the vote [134] As neither had a

improving life conditions as the main targets of his presidency [141] Two other world class African strikers, Didier Drogba and Samuel Eto'o, attended the inauguration [142]\n\n\nEconomic

29 January 2018, in his first annual message to the national legislature, he reduced his salary and other benefits by 25% with immediate effect \"With the assessment that I gave you earlier of the poor condition of our economy, I believe that it is appropriate that we should all make sacrifices in the interest of our country According to Article 60 of the Constitution of Liberia, the salaries of the president and the vice president are established by the Legislature of Liberia, and cannot be increased or reduced during the period for which they are elected However, in view of the very

Emmanuel Macron The meeting focused on improving the relationship between France and Liberia and also sought French help for a sports development project in Africa The meeting was also attended by
