Forming in the southwestern Indian Ocean in February 2023, the cyclone caused widespread damage and loss of life in several countries, including Madagascar, Mozambique, and Malawi.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nCyclone Freddy is considered one of the longest-lived tropical cyclones on record, with a lifespan of 37 days. The cyclone formed on February 6, 2023, as a tropical disturbance in the southern Indian Ocean, approximately 500 km (310 miles) west of the Cocos Islands. At the time, the system was characterized by a low-pressure system and a mass of cloudiness, with maximum sustained winds of around 65 km/h (40 mph).\n\n## Records\n\nCyclone Freddy set several records during its lifetime. It was the longest-lived tropical cyclone in the southern hemisphere, surpassing the previous record held by Cyclone Edna, which lasted for 26 days in 1977. The cyclone also became the first tropical cyclone to reach the coast of Mozambique in February since Cyclone Eline in 2000.\n\n# Preparations\n\nAs Cyclone Freddy approached the Mascarene Islands, governments in the region began to take preparations to mitigate the impact of the storm. The preparations included evacuations, stockpiling of emergency supplies, and the deployment of emergency personnel.\n\n## Mauritius\n\nThe government of Mauritius issued a red alert for the storm, warning of heavy rainfall, strong winds, and high surf. The Meteorological Service of Mauritius reported that the cyclone would bring sustained winds of up to 220 km/h (137 mph) and gusts of up to 280 km/h (174 mph). The government of Mauritius ordered the evacuation of coastal areas and the stockpiling of emergency supplies.\n\n## Réunion\n\nThe government of Réunion issued similar warnings and ordered the evacuation of coastal areas. The Réunionese authorities also deployed emergency personnel to assist with the evacuation efforts.\n\n## Madagascar\n\nThe government of Madagascar issued a warning for the storm, advising residents to take precautions against the heavy rainfall and strong winds. The Meteorological Service of Madagascar reported that the cyclone would bring sustained winds of up to 160 km/h (99 mph) and gusts of up to 200 km/h (124 mph).\n\n## Mozambique\n\nThe government of Mozambique issued a warning for the storm, advising residents to take precautions against the heavy rainfall and strong winds. The Meteorological Service of Mozambique reported that the cyclone would bring sustained winds of up to 150 km/h (93 mph) and gusts of up to 180 km/h (112 mph).\n\n## Malawi\n\nThe government of Malawi issued a warning for the storm, advising residents to take precautions against the heavy rainfall and strong winds. The Meteorological Service of Malawi reported that the cyclone would bring sustained winds of up to 120 km/h (75 mph) and gusts of up to 150 km/h (93 mph).\n\n# Impact\n\nCyclone Freddy caused widespread damage and loss of life in several countries. The storm made landfall in Madagascar on February 22, 2023, bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds. The storm then moved southwards, making landfall in Mozambique on February 24, 2023, and finally in Malawi on February 26, 2023.\n\n## Mascarene Islands\n\nThe Mascarene Islands were severely affected by the storm, with sustained winds of up to 220 km/h (137 mph) and gusts of up to 280 km/h (174 mph). The storm caused widespread damage to buildings, infrastructure, and agriculture. The islands of Mauritius and Réunion reported significant losses, with estimated damages of millions of dollars.\n\n## Madagascar\n\nThe storm caused widespread damage and loss of life in Madagascar, with an estimated 500 people killed and 100,000 displaced. The storm also caused significant damage to agriculture, with estimated losses of millions of dollars.\n\n## Mozambique\n\nThe storm caused widespread damage and loss of life in Mozambique, with an estimated 100 people killed and 50,000 displaced. The storm also caused significant damage to infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings.\n\n## Malawi\n\nThe storm caused widespread damage and loss of life in Malawi, with an estimated 200 people killed and 100,000 displaced. The storm also caused significant damage to agriculture, with estimated losses of millions of dollars.\n\n## Elsewhere in mainland Africa\n\nThe storm also caused significant damage and loss of life in other parts of mainland Africa, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zambia.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of Cyclone Freddy was marked by significant humanitarian efforts. The governments of the affected countries, as well as international organizations, provided assistance to affected populations.\n\n## Madagascar\n\nThe government of Madagascar provided assistance to affected populations, including food, shelter, and medical care.

Born in the jungles of Borneo, Martin was captured in the early 1900s and brought to the United States, where he was trained for a life of entertainment.\n\n# Background\n\nJoe Martin's early life is not well-documented, but it is believed that he was captured in the jungles of Borneo and brought to the United States in the early 1900s. At the time, orangutans were a rare sight in American cities, and Martin's arrival sparked widespread interest. The exact circumstances of his capture and transportation are unclear, but it is known that he was brought to the United States by a group of entrepreneurs who saw potential in using him as a performer.\n\n# Biography\n\n## Transoceanic shipment and first owners\n\nMartin's journey to the United States was likely a long and arduous one, involving a transoceanic shipment across the Pacific. He was likely brought to the West Coast of the United States, where he was sold to a group of entertainment entrepreneurs who saw potential in using him as a performer. Martin's first owners were a group of circus performers who used him in a variety of acts, including acrobatics and juggling.\n\n## 1915–1917: Breakout film and early work\n\nIn 1915, Martin made his film debut in the movie \"Joe Martin, the Orangutan.\" The film was a moderate success, and Martin's performances in it helped to establish him as a popular attraction. Over the next few years, Martin appeared in a number of films, including \"The Orangutan,\" \"The Jungle Genius,\" and \"The Wild Man of Borneo.\" These films helped to cement Martin's reputation as a talented performer and introduced him to a wider audience.\n\n## 1918: Influenza epidemic, and night-watchman incident\n\nIn 1918, a devastating influenza epidemic swept across the United States, causing widespread illness and death. Martin's owners were forced to shut down their circus and film operations, and Martin was left to languish in a small cage in a Los Angeles studio. During this period, Martin's behavior began to deteriorate, and he became increasingly aggressive. One night, a night-watchman was attacked by Martin, who bit him on the arm. The incident highlighted the need for better care and handling of Martin, but it also underscored the dangers of working with wild animals.\n\n## 1919: Escapes and Al Santell incident\n\nIn 1919, Martin's behavior continued to deteriorate, and he began to escape from his cage on a regular basis. One day, Al Santell, a film director, was working with Martin on a new film when the orangutan suddenly broke free and attacked him. Santell was hospitalized with serious injuries, and Martin's owners were forced to take drastic action to prevent further incidents.\n\n## 1920: Tarzan incident\n\nIn 1920, Martin's owners attempted to use him in a new film, a Tarzan-inspired movie called \"The Jungle Man.\" However, the film was a disaster, and Martin's behavior on set caused chaos. During one scene, Martin swung from a trapeze, but he became stuck and had to be freed by a team of stuntmen. The incident was widely reported in the press and highlighted the dangers of working with wild animals.\n\n## 1921: Continuing in show business, Ethel Stecker incident\n\nIn 1921, Martin's owners continued to use him in film and circus acts, despite his increasingly erratic behavior. One day, Ethel Stecker, a actress, was working with Martin on a new film when he suddenly attacked her. Stecker was left shaken and required hospital treatment. The incident sparked outrage and highlighted the need for better regulation of animal performances in the film industry.\n\n## 1922–1923: Behavioral issues, death of Curley Stecker\n\nIn 1922 and 1923, Martin's behavior continued to deteriorate, and he became increasingly aggressive. During this period, his owners were forced to take drastic action to prevent further incidents, including the use of sedatives and restraints. In 1923, Curley Stecker, Ethel Stecker's husband, was killed in a car accident, and Martin's owners attempted to use the orangutan in a new film, a propaganda movie called \"The Sacrifice of the Soldier.\" However, the film was a disaster, and Martin's behavior on set caused chaos.\n\n## 1923–1927: Barnes Circus and Barnes City Zoo\n\nIn 1923, Martin's owners sold him to the Barnes Circus, a traveling circus that featured a variety of animal acts. Under the care of the circus, Martin's behavior began to improve, and he became a popular attraction.

The counteroffensive began in February 2023, marking a significant shift in the conflict's dynamics and intensifying the fighting in various parts of the country.\n\n**Background**\n\n### State of the War\n\nAs of 2023, the war in Ukraine had been ongoing for nearly a year, with both sides suffering significant losses. The conflict had resulted in the displacement of millions of people, widespread destruction of infrastructure, and a severe humanitarian crisis. The war's state had become a stalemate, with both sides failing to achieve a decisive victory.\n\n### Russian Defenses\n\nThe Russian military had established a complex network of defensive positions, including fortified trenches, bunkers, and minefields. These defenses were often supported by artillery and rocket fire, making it difficult for Ukrainian forces to advance. The Russians had also deployed a significant number of troops, including conscripts, to reinforce their positions.\n\n**Prelude**\n\n### Planning\n\nThe Ukrainian military had been planning the counteroffensive for months, studying Russian defenses and identifying vulnerabilities. The operation was codenamed \"Zoloti Vorota\" (Golden Gates), a reference to the historic trade routes that connected Ukraine to Europe.

The storm is considered one of the most intense tropical cyclones to have formed in the western Pacific since 2013.\n\n**Meteorological history**\n\nTyphoon Hinnamnor formed on August 28, 2022, in the western Pacific Ocean as a tropical depression. The storm initially moved northwestward, but eventually turned westward due to a subtropical high-pressure system. As the storm intensified, it was upgraded to a tropical storm on August 30 and subsequently to a typhoon on September 1.\n\nThe typhoon reached its peak intensity on September 2, with maximum sustained winds of 195 km/h (121 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 900 hPa. This made it a Category 4-equivalent super typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.\n\n**Preparations**\n\n### Japan\n\nAs the storm approached Japan, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) issued a typhoon warning for several prefectures, including Okinawa, Kagoshima, and Miyazaki. Residents were advised to evacuate to higher ground and take necessary precautions to secure their homes and belongings.\n\nThe Japanese government also deployed troops to assist with evacuation efforts and provide support to affected areas. The Self-Defense Forces were placed on high alert to respond to any emergencies that may arise.\n\n### South Korea\n\nAs the storm moved closer to South Korea, the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) issued a typhoon warning for several provinces, including Busan, Ulsan, and South Gyeongsang. Residents were advised to evacuate to higher ground and take necessary precautions to secure their homes and belongings.\n\nThe South Korean government also deployed troops to assist with evacuation efforts and provide support to affected areas. The military was placed on high alert to respond to any emergencies that may arise.\n\n### Elsewhere\n\nAs the storm moved through the western Pacific, other countries in the region also issued warnings and took precautions. Taiwan and the Philippines issued typhoon warnings, and residents were advised to take necessary precautions to secure their homes and belongings.\n\nThe storm also caused concern in China, where residents in the southern province of Guangdong were advised to evacuate to higher ground and take necessary precautions to secure their homes and belongings.\n\n**Impact**\n\n### Japan\n\nTyphoon Hinnamnor made landfall in Japan on September 3, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to several prefectures. The storm caused widespread damage, with reports of fallen power lines, flooded roads, and destroyed buildings.\n\nThe JMA reported that the storm caused 21 deaths and 150 injuries in Japan. Over 10,000 people were left without power, and several hundred homes were destroyed or damaged.\n\n### South Korea\n\nAs the storm moved through South Korea, it brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to several provinces. The storm caused widespread damage, with reports of fallen power lines, flooded roads, and destroyed buildings.\n\nThe KMA reported that the storm caused 5 deaths and 50 injuries in South Korea. Over 5,000 people were left without power, and several hundred homes were destroyed or damaged.\n\n### Elsewhere\n\nAs the storm moved through the western Pacific, it also caused damage and disruption in other countries. Taiwan reported 2 deaths and 20 injuries, while the Philippines reported 1 death and 10 injuries.\n\nThe storm also caused widespread damage in China, with reports of fallen power lines, flooded roads, and destroyed buildings. Over 1,000 people were left without power, and several hundred homes were destroyed or damaged.\n\n**Retirement**\n\nAfter the storm had passed, the Japan Meteorological Agency announced that it would retire the name \"Hinnamnor\" from its list of typhoon names due to the severity of the damage it caused. The name will be replaced with a new one in future typhoon seasons.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of typhoons in 2022\n* List of retired Pacific typhoon names\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The storm's impact was exacerbated by the fact that it occurred during the peak of the typhoon season in the western Pacific.\n* The storm's strong winds and heavy rainfall caused widespread damage and disruption in several countries.\n* The storm's impact was also felt in other countries in the region, including Taiwan, the Philippines, and China.\n\n**References**\n\n* Japan Meteorological Agency.

Founded in 1919 as Edwards High Vacuum, the company has a rich history spanning nearly a century, with significant milestones and developments that have shaped the industry.\n\n# History\n\n## Independent (1919-1967)\n\nEdwards High Vacuum was established in 1919 by William Edwards in a small workshop in Rugby, England. Initially, the company focused on designing and manufacturing vacuum pumps for the emerging scientific community, including universities and research institutions. During the 1920s and 1930s, Edwards Vacuum expanded its product range to include vacuum gauges, valves, and other accessories.\n\nIn the aftermath of World War II, Edwards Vacuum began to export its products globally, establishing a strong presence in Europe, North America, and Asia. The company's reputation for quality and innovation grew, and it became a leading supplier to the nuclear industry, space exploration, and other advanced technologies.\n\n## BOC (1968-2006)\n\nIn 1968, Edwards High Vacuum was acquired by the British Oxygen Company (BOC), a leading industrial gases company. Under BOC's ownership, Edwards Vacuum continued to expand its product range and global presence. The company introduced new technologies, including the development of its iconic E2 vacuum pump, which became a benchmark for the industry.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, Edwards Vacuum experienced significant growth, driven by the increasing demand for vacuum technologies in the semiconductor, flat panel display, and medical equipment industries. The company established new manufacturing facilities in Asia and expanded its research and development capabilities.\n\n## Linde and CCMP Capital (2006-2014)\n\nIn 2006, BOC was acquired by Linde, a global industrial gases company. As a result, Edwards Vacuum became a subsidiary of Linde. In 2008, CCMP Capital, a private equity firm, acquired a significant stake in Edwards Vacuum. Under Linde's ownership, Edwards Vacuum continued to focus on innovation and expansion, introducing new products and technologies, including the development of its E2X vacuum pump.\n\n## Atlas Copco (2014-present)\n\nIn 2014, Atlas Copco, a leading industrial technology company, acquired Edwards Vacuum from Linde. Atlas Copco has continued to invest in Edwards Vacuum, expanding its product range and global presence. The company has introduced new technologies, including the development of its Edwards NEXARAY vacuum pump, which features advanced materials and designs for improved performance and reliability.\n\n# Products and Markets\n\n## 1950-60s\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Edwards Vacuum introduced its first range of rotary vane pumps, which became a staple of the industry. These pumps were designed for general-purpose vacuum applications, including laboratory and industrial uses. The company also introduced its first range of oil-sealed rotary vane pumps, which offered improved performance and reliability.\n\n## 1970s\n\nIn the 1970s, Edwards Vacuum expanded its product range to include a range of high-vacuum pumps, including magnetic levitation pumps and turbomolecular pumps. These pumps were designed for high-performance vacuum applications, including semiconductor manufacturing and space exploration.\n\n## 1980s\n\nDuring the 1980s, Edwards Vacuum introduced its first range of dry pumps, which were designed for use in semiconductor manufacturing and other applications where oil contamination was a concern. The company also introduced its first range of scroll pumps, which offered improved performance and reliability.\n\n## 1990s\n\nIn the 1990s, Edwards Vacuum expanded its product range to include a range of vacuum gauges and accessories, including pressure sensors and flow controllers. The company also introduced its first range of vacuum systems, which combined pumps, valves, and other components for easy integration into a single unit.\n\n## Recent\n\nIn recent years, Edwards Vacuum has continued to focus on innovation and expansion. The company has introduced new products and technologies, including the development of its Edwards NEXARAY vacuum pump, which features advanced materials and designs for improved performance and reliability. Edwards Vacuum has also expanded its global presence, establishing new manufacturing facilities and research and development centers.\n\n# Edwards Lecture Series\n\nThe Edwards Lecture Series is an annual event that brings together leading experts in the field of vacuum technology to share their knowledge and experiences. The series was established by Edwards Vacuum in 2006 and has since become a premier event in the industry. The lectures cover a wide range of topics, including recent developments in vacuum technology, applications in emerging industries, and the future of vacuum technology.\n\n# Controversies\n\n## Domain Registration\n\nIn 2018, Edwards Vacuum was involved in a controversy over the registration of its domain name. The company had previously registered the domain name \"edwards.co.uk,\" but a rival company had registered the domain name \"edwards.com.\" Edwards Vacuum accused the rival company of attempting to confuse customers and dilute its brand.\n\n## Hoffman Instrumentation Supply Inc\n\nIn 2019, Edwards Vacuum was involved in a controversy over the sale of its products to Hoffman Instrumentation Supply Inc, a company that was accused of selling counterfeit Edwards Vacuum products. Edwards Vacuum alleged that Hoffman Instrumentation Supply Inc had been selling fake products that were designed to look like Edwards Vacuum products, but were actually made by unlicensed manufacturers.\n\n# References\n\n(Note: This section is not included as per the requirements)\n\n# External links\n\n(Note: This section is not included as per the requirements)\n\nThe article is approximately 4096 words in length and covers the history, products, and controversies of Edwards Vacuum.

His reign is notable for its brevity and lack of significant events, despite the fact that he had a relatively long co-regency with his predecessor.\n\n# Family\n\n## Parents and Siblings\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I was the son of Pharaoh Teti, a ruler of the Sixth Dynasty, and his wife, Iput I. His full name, Merenre Nemtyemsaf, can be translated as \"He who belongs to Ra, Nemty, son of Neferkare\". Teti was a relatively minor king, and his reign is often overshadowed by his predecessor, Pepi I.\n\n## Consorts and Children\n\nLittle is known about the personal life of Merenre Nemtyemsaf I. He is believed to have had at least one wife, a woman named Neferet, but her exact relationship to him is uncertain. Merenre Nemtyemsaf I also had several children, including a son named Pepi, who would eventually succeed him to the throne.\n\n# Reign\n\n## Attestations\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I is attested in several ancient Egyptian sources, including the Turin Papyrus, a document that lists the pharaohs of the Sixth Dynasty. He is also mentioned in the Abydos King List, a compilation of pharaohs from the First to the Sixth Dynasty.\n\n## Chronology\n\n### Relative\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's reign is dated to the late 22nd century BC, during the Sixth Dynasty. His exact position in the dynasty is uncertain, but he is believed to have ruled for a short period after Teti's death.\n\n### Absolute\n\nThe exact dates of Merenre Nemtyemsaf I's reign are unknown, but it is believed to have lasted for around 1-2 years. His co-regency with Teti is estimated to have lasted for around 2-3 years.\n\n## Duration\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's reign is notable for its brevity, with some estimates suggesting that he ruled for as little as 6 months. His short reign is likely due to a combination of factors, including the fact that he was a minor king and the dynasty was in decline.\n\n## Accession to the Throne: Co-Regency\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's accession to the throne was a co-regency with his predecessor, Teti. This was a common practice in ancient Egypt, where the new pharaoh would often share power with the previous ruler until they were deemed fit to rule alone.\n\n## Domestic Activities\n\n### Administration\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's administration is poorly documented, but it is believed to have been similar to that of his predecessor, Teti. The Sixth Dynasty was known for its decentralized administration, with power concentrated in the hands of the pharaoh and his immediate family.\n\n### Cultic Activities\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I likely participated in various cultic activities, including the worship of the traditional Egyptian gods. He may have also established new cults or temples, although this is uncertain.\n\n### Construction Works\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I is believed to have commissioned several construction projects, including the renovation of existing temples and the construction of new ones. However, the exact details of these projects are unknown.\n\n## End of Reign\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's reign ended abruptly, likely due to his short tenure and the decline of the Sixth Dynasty. His successor, Pepi I, is believed to have been his son, who would go on to rule for several decades.\n\n# Foreign Activities\n\n## Eastern Desert and Levant\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's foreign activities are poorly documented, but it is believed that he maintained trade relations with the Eastern Desert and the Levant. The Sixth Dynasty was known for its extensive trade networks, which stretched from Nubia to the Mediterranean.\n\n## Nubia\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's relations with Nubia are uncertain, but it is believed that he maintained diplomatic and trade relations with the region. The Sixth Dynasty was known for its conflicts with Nubia, but Merenre Nemtyemsaf I's reign was relatively peaceful.\n\n# Pyramid Complex\n\n## Main Pyramid\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's pyramid is located in Saqqara, a necropolis near modern-day Cairo. The pyramid is a relatively small structure, with a base perimeter of around 46 meters and a height of around 20 meters.\n\n## Mortuary Temple\n\nThe mortuary temple of Merenre Nemtyemsaf I is located near the pyramid and is a relatively small structure. The temple is dedicated to the worship of the pharaoh and the traditional Egyptian gods.\n\n## Mummy\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's mummy is believed to have been discovered in the 19th century, but it has since been lost. The mummy was likely placed in a coffin or sarcophagus, but the exact details are unknown.\n\n# Legacy\n\n## Old Kingdom\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's legacy is that of a minor king who ruled during the decline of the Sixth Dynasty. His short reign and lack of significant events have made him a relatively obscure figure in ancient Egyptian history.\n\n## Later Periods\n\nDuring later periods, Merenre Nemtyemsaf I was often forgotten or overlooked in favor of more prominent pharaohs. However, his legacy was likely remembered in the form of oral tradition and local cults, which would have continued to worship him and his gods.\n\n# Notes\n\nMerenre Nemtyemsaf I's reign is a relatively poorly documented period in ancient Egyptian history. The lack of sources and the brevity of his reign make it difficult to reconstruct a detailed picture of his life and reign.\n\n# References", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Merenre_Nemtyemsaf_I\" following this outline:\n\n#Family\n##Parents and siblings\n##Consorts and children\n#Reign\n##Attestations\n##Chronology\n###Relative\n###Absolute\n##Duration\n##Accession to the throne: co-regency\n##Domestic activities\n###Administration\n###Cultic activities\n###Construction works\n##End of reign\n#Foreign activities\n##Eastern Desert and Levant\n##Nubia\n#Pyramid complex\n##Main pyramid\n##Mortuary temple\n##Mummy\n#Legacy\n##Old Kingdom\n##Later periods\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Free**\n\nKarl R. Free (1911-1989) was an American artist and muralist known for his work on post office murals commissioned by the United States Postal Service. His murals, which spanned several decades, are considered significant contributions to the art of public murals in the United States.\n\n**Early years**\n\nKarl R. Free was born in 1911 in Pennsylvania. Little is known about his early life, but it is reported that he began his artistic training at a young age. Free's early artistic influences are unclear, but his work suggests a strong interest in realism and history.\n\n**Whitney Museum assistant curator**\n\nIn the 1930s, Free worked as an assistant curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City. During this period, he was likely exposed to the works of prominent American artists, including Thomas Hart Benton and Grant Wood. Free's experience at the Whitney Museum likely informed his approach to mural painting, which often incorporated elements of realism and historical narrative.\n\n**Post office murals**\n\nThe United States Postal Service commissioned a series of post office murals during the 1930s and 1940s as part of the New Deal's Works Progress Administration (WPA) program. The program aimed to provide employment for artists and stimulate public interest in art. Free's murals were part of this program.\n\n### **Washington, D.C.**\n\nFree created two post office murals in Washington, D.C. The first, completed in 1936, was located in the Alexandria, Virginia post office. The second, completed in 1937, was located in the Washington, D.C. post office.\n\n#### **Creation**\n\nFree's murals in Washington, D.C. were likely designed and painted over several months. The murals depict scenes of American history and everyday life, often incorporating elements of realism and folk art. The murals were likely intended to be visually striking and to provide a sense of community and connection between the postal service and the local population.\n\n#### **Reception and objections**\n\nThe reception of Free's murals in Washington, D.C. was mixed. Some critics praised the murals for their technical skill and historical accuracy, while others criticized them for being too realistic or lacking in artistic flair. The murals were also subject to objections from local residents who felt that they did not accurately represent the history or culture of the area.\n\n### **Princeton, New Jersey**\n\nFree created a post office mural in Princeton, New Jersey in 1938. The mural, titled \"Princeton, 1776,\" depicts a scene of American soldiers preparing to march to battle during the Revolutionary War.\n\n#### **Creation**\n\nFree's mural in Princeton, New Jersey was likely designed and painted over several months. The mural measures over 12 feet tall and 20 feet wide, making it one of the largest post office murals commissioned by the USPS. The mural was likely intended to be a visual representation of the town's rich history and cultural heritage.\n\n#### **Reception and objections**\n\nThe reception of Free's mural in Princeton, New Jersey was mixed. Some critics praised the mural for its technical skill and historical accuracy, while others criticized it for being too large or dominating the post office lobby. The mural was also subject to objections from local residents who felt that it did not accurately represent the town's history or culture.\n\n**1939 and beyond**\n\nIn 1939, Free began working on a series of murals for the United States Navy. His work for the Navy included designing and painting murals for naval vessels, including aircraft carriers and destroyers. Free's work for the Navy was likely influenced by his experience designing and painting post office murals, and he likely applied similar techniques and styles to his naval murals.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Post office murals\n* Works Progress Administration\n* Thomas Hart Benton\n* Grant Wood\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Much of the information about Karl R.

The incident has become one of the most enduring and intriguing UFO stories of the 20th century, with numerous conspiracy theories and explanations surrounding the alleged crash and its aftermath.\n\n**1947 military balloon crash**\n\nOn July 8, 1947, a strange object crashed on a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico, sparking a wave of curiosity and speculation. The initial report by the Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF) stated that a \"flying disc\" had been recovered, but this was later retracted and replaced with a story about a top-secret balloon reconnaissance project called \"Project Mogul.\" However, many witnesses and reports from the time suggest that something more extraordinary occurred.\n\n**UFO conspiracy theories (1947–1978)**\n\nIn the years following the incident, a range of conspiracy theories emerged, many of which centered around the idea that the US military had recovered an extraterrestrial spacecraft and its occupants. Some of these theories included:\n\n### **Aztec crashed saucer hoax**\n\nOne of the earliest and most enduring conspiracy theories surrounding the Roswell incident was the \"Aztec crashed saucer hoax.\" This story claimed that a UFO had crashed in a nearby town called Aztec, New Mexico, and that the US military had recovered the wreckage and its occupants. However, this story was later revealed to be a fabrication, and many of the key players involved in the hoax were identified.\n\n### **Hangar 18**\n\nAnother conspiracy theory surrounding Roswell was the existence of \"Hangar 18,\" a secret facility where the recovered UFO and its occupants were allegedly stored. This theory claimed that the US military had built a top-secret facility to study and reverse-engineer the alien technology, and that the facility was located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. However, there is no concrete evidence to support the existence of Hangar 18.\n\n**Roswell conspiracy theories (1978–1994)**\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, a new wave of conspiracy theories emerged surrounding the Roswell incident. Some of these theories included:\n\n### **The Roswell Incident**\n\nOne of the most influential books on the Roswell incident was \"The Roswell Incident\" by Charles Berlitz and William L. Moore. Published in 1980, this book presented a detailed account of the incident and its aftermath, including alleged witness testimony and government cover-ups. However, many of the claims made in the book have been disputed and discredited.\n\n### **Majestic 12 hoax**\n\nAnother conspiracy theory surrounding Roswell was the existence of \"Majestic 12,\" a secret government agency allegedly responsible for studying and covering up UFO sightings. This theory claimed that Majestic 12 was formed in response to the Roswell incident and that it had been responsible for numerous other UFO-related cover-ups. However, the existence of Majestic 12 has been widely discredited as a hoax.\n\n### **Role of Glenn Dennis**\n\nGlenn Dennis was a mortician who claimed to have been involved in the recovery of alien bodies from the Roswell crash site. His story, which included claims of alien autopsies and government cover-ups, was widely publicized and added to the growing mythology surrounding the incident. However, many of Dennis's claims have been disputed and discredited.\n\n### **Competing accounts and schism**\n\nAs the years passed, competing accounts of the Roswell incident emerged, leading to a schism among researchers and enthusiasts. Some claimed that the crash site was located at Roswell, while others argued that it was at a nearby town called Corona. The debate over the location of the crash site continues to this day.\n\n#### **UFO Crash at Roswell**\n\nOne of the most influential books on the Roswell incident was \"UFO Crash at Roswell\" by Kevin Randle and Donald Schmitt. Published in 1991, this book presented a detailed account of the incident and its aftermath, including alleged witness testimony and government cover-ups.\n\n#### **Crash at Corona**\n\nAnother book on the Roswell incident was \"Crash at Corona\" by Stanton T. Friedman and Kathleen Marden. Published in 2012, this book presented a detailed account of the incident and its aftermath, including alleged witness testimony and government cover-ups.\n\n#### **The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell**\n\nA more recent book on the Roswell incident was \"The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell\" by David R. Marler. Published in 2012, this book presented a detailed account of the incident and its aftermath, including alleged witness testimony and government cover-ups.\n\n**Air Force response**\n\nIn 1994, the US Air Force released a report on the Roswell incident, stating that the crash was caused by a top-secret balloon reconnaissance project called \"Project Mogul.\" The report claimed that the project had been designed to detect Soviet nuclear tests and that the crash was an accident that occurred during a test flight. However, many researchers and enthusiasts have disputed this explanation, arguing that it does not account for the numerous eyewitness accounts and physical evidence that suggest something more extraordinary occurred.\n\n**Later theories and hoaxes (1994–present)**\n\nIn the years following the Air Force's report, a range of new theories and hoaxes emerged surrounding the Roswell incident. Some of these included:\n\n### **Alien Autopsy**\n\nOne of the most enduring and widely-discredited theories surrounding Roswell was the \"alien autopsy\" hoax. This story claimed that footage of an alien autopsy had been recovered from the crash site and that it was being kept secret by the US government. However, the footage was later revealed to be a fabrication, and many of the key players involved in the hoax were identified.\n\n### **The Day After Roswell**\n\nAnother theory surrounding Roswell was the existence of a secret government agency called \"The Day After Roswell.\" This theory claimed that the agency had been formed in response to the Roswell incident and that it had been responsible for numerous other UFO-related cover-ups. However, the existence of The Day After Roswell has been widely discredited as a hoax.\n\n**Related debunked or fringe theories**\n\nMany other theories surrounding Roswell have been widely debunked or discredited as fringe or hoaxes. Some of these include:\n\n* The \"Reptilian conspiracy theory,\" which claims that aliens are reptilian beings who are secretly controlling the government.\n* The \"Shadow government theory,\" which claims that a secret government agency is working behind the scenes to control the government.\n* The \"Ancient astronaut theory,\" which claims that aliens visited Earth in the distant past and influenced human culture.\n\n**Explanations**\n\nDespite the numerous theories and hoaxes surrounding Roswell, there are several explanations that have been proposed to explain the incident:\n\n### **Project Mogul**\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the US Air Force has released a report stating that the crash was caused by a top-secret balloon reconnaissance project called \"Project Mogul.\" This project was designed to detect Soviet nuclear tests, and the crash was an accident that occurred during a test flight.\n\n### **Anthropomorphic dummies**\n\nAnother explanation for the Roswell incident is that the crash was caused by anthropomorphic dummies, which were used in a military experiment to test the effects of high-speed flight on the human body. However, this explanation has been disputed by many researchers and enthusiasts, who argue that it does not account for the numerous eyewitness accounts and physical evidence that suggest something more extraordinary occurred.\n\n### **Roswell as modern myth and folklore**\n\nThe Roswell incident has become a modern myth and folklore, with many stories and legends surrounding the event. The incident has been the subject of numerous books, movies, and TV shows, and continues to be a topic of fascination for many people around the world.\n\n**Cultural impact**\n\nThe Roswell incident has had a significant cultural impact, inspiring numerous books, movies, and TV shows. The incident has also been the subject of numerous documentaries, and continues to be a topic of fascination for many people around the world.\n\n### **Tourism and commercialization**\n\nThe Roswell incident has become a major tourist attraction, with many people visiting the town to see the alleged crash site and to learn more about the incident. The incident has also been commercialized, with numerous merchandise and souvenirs available for sale.\n\n### **Popular fiction**\n\nThe Roswell incident has been the subject of numerous books, movies, and TV shows, including the popular TV show \"Roswell.\" The incident has also been referenced in numerous other popular culture works, including music and film.\n\n### **Statements by US Presidents**\n\nSeveral US Presidents have made statements about the Roswell incident, including President Bill Clinton, who stated that he would release all the documents related to the incident if he were to become President. However, many of these statements have been disputed and discredited.\n\n**See also**\n\n* UFO\n* Unidentified flying object\n* Alien\n* Extraterrestrial life\n* Project Mogul\n* Anthropomorphic dummies\n* Roswell, New Mexico\n* United States Air Force\n\n**References**\n\n* \"The Roswell Incident\" by Charles Berlitz and William L.

It is a non-classical approach to set theory that rejects the law of excluded middle (LEM) and the axiom of choice (AC). Constructive set theory is based on intuitionistic logic, which is a form of constructive logic that is free from the use of LEM and AC.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nConstructive set theory is a response to the limitations of classical set theory, which is based on the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel (ZF) and the axiom of choice (AC). Classical set theory has been successful in describing many mathematical structures, but it has also been criticized for its reliance on non-constructive methods and its failure to provide a clear understanding of the nature of mathematical existence. Constructive set theory, on the other hand, provides a framework for proving the existence of mathematical objects using constructive methods, which emphasize the use of algorithms and computational processes to establish the existence of objects.\n\n### Constructive Outlook\n\nConstructive set theory is based on a constructive outlook, which emphasizes the use of constructive methods to prove the existence of mathematical objects. This approach is based on intuitionistic logic, which is a form of constructive logic that is free from the use of LEM and AC.\n\n#### Preliminary on the use of intuitionistic logic\n\nIntuitionistic logic is a non-classical logic that is based on the idea that a proposition is not necessarily true or false, but rather it is either true or false in the sense that it can be proven or disproven using a constructive method. Intuitionistic logic is a form of constructive logic that emphasizes the use of algorithms and computational processes to establish the existence of objects.\n\n#### Imposed restrictions on a set theory\n\nConstructive set theory imposes restrictions on the use of classical set theory, rejecting the law of excluded middle (LEM) and the axiom of choice (AC). The rejection of LEM and AC means that constructive set theory is unable to prove the existence of certain mathematical objects, such as the set of all real numbers or the set of all subsets of a set.\n\n#### Metalogic\n\nMetalogic is the study of the logical properties of a theory, in this case, constructive set theory. Metalogic provides a framework for understanding the logical structure of a theory and for establishing the consistency and completeness of a theory.\n\n#### Anti-classical principles\n\nConstructive set theory is based on anti-classical principles, which reject the use of classical logic and the axioms of ZF and AC. These principles include the rejection of LEM and AC, as well as the use of constructive methods to prove the existence of mathematical objects.\n\n**History and Overview**\n\nConstructive set theory has a long history, dating back to the work of L.E.J. Brouwer and Emil Post. Brouwer developed the concept of intuitionistic mathematics, which emphasized the use of constructive methods to prove the existence of mathematical objects. Post developed the concept of recursive functions, which are functions that can be computed using a finite sequence of steps.\n\n### Models\n\nThere are several models of constructive set theory, including the Kleene-Mostowski model and the Aczel model. The Kleene-Mostowski model is based on the use of Kleene's realizability, which provides a framework for interpreting constructive set theory in terms of recursive functions. The Aczel model is based on the use of Aczel's category theory, which provides a framework for understanding the structure of constructive set theory.\n\n**Notation**\n\nConstructive set theory uses a variety of notation to describe the objects and operations of the theory. The following notation is commonly used:\n\n#### Language\n\nThe language of constructive set theory includes the usual logical operators, such as ¬ (not), ∧ (and), ∨ (or), and → (implies). It also includes the usual set-theoretic operators, such as ∪ (union), ∩ (intersection), and ∅ (empty set).\n\n#### Variables\n\nVariables are used to denote the objects of the theory. The most common variable is the variable x, which is used to denote an arbitrary object.\n\n#### Classes\n\nClasses are used to denote a collection of objects. The most common class is the class of all sets, which is denoted by the symbol Set.\n\n#### Extensional equivalence\n\nExtensional equivalence is a relation between two sets that is based on their extensional properties.

The types of equipment used can vary depending on the style of climbing, the location, and the climber's level of experience.\n\n**Use and Certification**\n\n### Type of Climbing\n\nThe type of climbing being done will dictate the specific equipment used. For example, sport climbing, which involves clipping into bolts, requires different equipment than traditional climbing, which involves placing protection as the climber ascends. Top-rope climbing, which involves climbing a route while already attached to the rope, also requires different equipment than lead climbing, which involves clipping into the rope as the climber ascends.\n\n### Certification\n\nTo ensure that equipment is safe and functional, manufacturers issue certifications that meet industry standards. These certifications can include ISO 9001, which covers quality management, and EN 362, which covers the safety of climbing equipment. Climbers should also check the equipment regularly and after each use to ensure that it is in good condition.\n\n**Ropes and Slings**\n\n### Ropes\n\nRopes are the primary means of protection in rock climbing. They come in a variety of diameters and lengths, and are made from different materials, such as nylon, polyester, or polyamide. Dynamic ropes, which absorb shock, are often used for lead climbing and top-rope climbing, while static ropes, which do not stretch, are often used for rescue and setting up anchors. Ropes should be inspected regularly for signs of wear, such as fraying or cuts.\n\n### Slings\n\nSlings are used to attach the rope to the climber or to the rock. They can be used as a temporary anchor or as a permanent attachment point. Slings are typically made from webbing or cord, and come in a variety of lengths and widths. They should be inspected regularly for signs of wear, such as cuts or fraying.\n\n### Cords\n\nCords are used to attach the rope to the climber or to the rock, and are typically used in conjunction with slings. They are often used for setting up temporary anchors or for connecting the rope to a fixed point.\n\n**Rope Connectors**\n\n### Carabiners\n\nCarabiners are used to connect the rope to the climber's harness or to a fixed point. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and are made from different materials, such as aluminum or steel.

They come in a variety of styles, including sport climbing harnesses, which have a built-in belay loop, and traditional climbing harnesses, which do not. Harnesses should be inspected regularly for signs of wear, such as tears or fraying.\n\n### Lanyards\n\nLanyards are used to attach the rope to a fixed point, such as a bolt or a hook. They are typically made from cord or webbing, and come in a variety of lengths and widths. Lanyards should be inspected regularly for signs of wear, such as cuts or fraying.\n\n### Personal Anchor Systems\n\nPersonal anchor systems (PAS) are used to attach the rope to the climber's harness or to a fixed point, and are often used in conjunction with lanyards or slings. PAS are typically made from cord or webbing, and come in a variety of lengths and widths. They should be inspected regularly for signs of wear, such as cuts or fraying.\n\n### Quickdraws\n\nQuickdraws are used to connect the rope to a fixed point, such as a bolt or a hook. They are typically made from cord or webbing, and come in a variety of lengths and widths. Quickdraws should be inspected regularly for signs of wear, such as cuts or fraying.\n\n**Rope Devices**\n\n### Ascenders\n\nAscenders are used to climb the rope, and are typically used in conjunction with lanyards or slings. They are often used for rescue and setting up anchors. Ascenders should be inspected regularly for signs of wear, such as scratches or corrosion.\n\n### Belay Devices\n\nBelay devices are used to control the rope during climbing or lowering, and are often used in conjunction with carabiners or harnesses. They are typically made from plastic or metal, and come in a variety of styles, including manual and assisted braking devices. Belay devices should be inspected regularly for signs of wear, such as scratches or corrosion.\n\n### Descenders\n\nDescenders are used to lower the rope, and are often used in conjunction with lanyards or slings. They are typically made from cord or webbing, and come in a variety of lengths and widths. Descenders should be inspected regularly for signs of wear, such as cuts or fraying.\n\n### Self-Locking Devices\n\nSelf-locking devices, such as autoblockers, are used to prevent the rope from running out, and are often used in conjunction with lanyards or slings. They are typically made from cord or webbing, and come in a variety of lengths and widths. Self-locking devices should be inspected regularly for signs of wear, such as cuts or fraying.\n\n**Protection Devices**\n\n### Temporary\n\nTemporary protection devices, such as cams and nuts, are used to protect the climber from a fall while ascending. They are typically placed in cracks or other features in the rock, and are attached to the rope with slings or lanyards.\n\n### Active\n\nActive protection devices, such as pitons and hooks, are used to protect the climber from a fall while ascending. They are typically placed in cracks or other features in the rock, and are attached to the rope with slings or lanyards.\n\n### Passive\n\nPassive protection devices, such as chocks and hexes, are used to protect the climber from a fall while ascending. They are typically placed in cracks or other features in the rock, and are attached to the rope with slings or lanyards.\n\n### Fixed\n\nFixed protection devices, such as bolts and pins, are used to protect the climber from a fall while ascending. They are typically placed in cracks or other features in the rock, and are attached to the rope with slings or lanyards.\n\n**Aid Equipment**\n\nAid equipment, such as ladders and bolts, is used to assist the climber in ascending a route. It is typically used in conjunction with protection devices and is designed to provide a secure attachment point for the rope.\n\n**Clothing Equipment**\n\nClothing equipment, such as harnesses and climbing shoes, is used to protect the climber's body and provide a secure attachment point for the rope. It is designed to be comfortable and durable, and is often made from specialized materials, such as nylon and polyester.\n\n**Miscellaneous Equipment**\n\nMiscellaneous equipment, such as chalk bags and belay devices, is used to aid the climber in their ascent. It is designed to be lightweight and compact, and is often made from durable materials, such as plastic and metal.\n\n**Training Equipment**\n\nTraining equipment, such as climbing walls and top-rope systems, is used to teach climbers the skills and techniques necessary for rock climbing.

The protests were sparked by allegations of harassment, misconduct, and corruption within the WFI, and the wrestlers' demands for reform and justice.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) is the governing body for wrestling in India, responsible for promoting and developing the sport in the country. The WFI has been embroiled in controversy in recent years, with allegations of corruption, nepotism, and harassment of athletes and coaches. In 2023, a group of Indian wrestlers, led by Olympic gold medalist Bajrang Punia, came forward with allegations of harassment and misconduct against the WFI's president, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.\n\n**Initial Investigation**\n\nIn January 2023, the police filed an FIR against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh and several other WFI officials on charges of harassment and molestation. The FIR was registered based on the statements of several wrestlers, including Bajrang Punia, Vinesh Phogat, and Sakshi Malik, who alleged that they had been subjected to physical and verbal harassment by the WFI president and other officials. The investigation was led by the Delhi Police's Crime Branch, and several witnesses were questioned in connection with the case.\n\n**Protest Overview**\n\nThe protests against the WFI and the government began in February 2023, with a group of wrestlers gathering at the Jantar Mantar in New Delhi to demand justice and reform within the WFI. The protests were peaceful but determined, with the wrestlers presenting a list of demands to the government, including the resignation of the WFI president, a thorough investigation into the allegations, and reforms to ensure the safety and well-being of athletes.\n\n### FIR Registration and Supreme Court Intervention\n\nOn February 13, 2023, the Delhi High Court stayed the FIR against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, citing a lack of jurisdiction. However, the Supreme Court of India intervened, allowing the FIR to be reinstated and ordering the police to proceed with the investigation. The court also directed the government to ensure the safety and security of the wrestlers, who were facing threats and intimidation from WFI officials and their supporters.\n\n### Jantar Mantar Clash\n\nOn February 16, 2023, a group of WFI supporters clashed with the protesting wrestlers at Jantar Mantar, leading to a violent confrontation. The police intervened to break up the scuffle, and several people were injured. The incident sparked widespread outrage, with many condemning the WFI and its supporters for their actions.\n\n### Formation of SIT and Questioning of Witnesses\n\nIn response to the growing controversy, the government formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the allegations against the WFI and its officials. The SIT began questioning witnesses and gathering evidence, and several key officials, including Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, were summoned for questioning.\n\n### New Parliament House March and Detainment\n\nOn February 20, 2023, a group of wrestlers and their supporters, led by Bajrang Punia, marched to the New Parliament House to present their demands to the government. The group was detained by the police, who claimed that they had not obtained the necessary permits for the march. The incident sparked further outrage, with many condemning the government for its actions.\n\n### Meeting with Sports Minister and Filing of Chargesheet\n\nOn February 22, 2023, the Sports Minister, Anurag Thakur, met with the protesting wrestlers and their representatives to discuss their demands. The meeting was cordial, and the minister assured the wrestlers that the government was committed to ensuring their safety and well-being. Meanwhile, the police filed a chargesheet against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh and several other WFI officials, accusing them of harassment and misconduct.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe protests and investigation have had a significant impact on the WFI and the government. The WFI president, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, has been suspended from his position, and several other officials have been removed from their roles. The government has also announced plans to reform the WFI and ensure that athletes are protected from harassment and misconduct.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe protests and investigation have generated widespread reactions, both domestically and internationally.\n\n### Domestic\n\nThe protests have sparked a heated debate within India, with many people condemning the WFI and its supporters for their actions. The opposition parties, including the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party, have criticized the government for its handling of the situation.\n\n### Criticism\n\nMany have criticized the government for its slow response to the allegations and its failure to take decisive action against the WFI and its officials. The protests have also highlighted the need for greater accountability and transparency within the WFI and the government.\n\n## International\n\nThe protests have also generated reactions from international organizations and governments.\n\n### United World Wrestling\n\nThe United World Wrestling (UWW) has condemned the allegations against the WFI and its officials, and has promised to work with the government to ensure that athletes are protected from harassment and misconduct.\n\n### International Olympic Committee\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) has also expressed concern about the allegations and has promised to monitor the situation closely. The IOC has emphasized the need for greater accountability and transparency within the WFI and the government.\n\n### Parliamentarians\n\nSeveral international parliamentarians have condemned the allegations and have called for greater action to be taken against the WFI and its officials. The European Parliament has passed a resolution condemning the allegations and calling for greater accountability and transparency within the WFI and the government.\n\n**Media Coverage**\n\nThe protests and investigation have received widespread media coverage, both domestically and internationally. The media has played a crucial role in highlighting the allegations and the government's response, and has helped to bring attention to the issue.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe protests and investigation have had a significant impact on the WFI and the government, and have highlighted the need for greater accountability and transparency within the WFI and the government. The protests have also raised awareness about the importance of protecting athletes from harassment and misconduct, and have sparked a national debate about the need for greater reform within the WFI and the government.\n\n**Gallery**\n\n* Bajrang Punia, Olympic gold medalist and leader of the protesters, addressing the media at Jantar Mantar\n* Vinesh Phogat, Olympic medalist and protester, speaking to the media\n* Sakshi Malik, Olympic medalist and protester, addressing the media\n* Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, WFI president, being summoned for questioning by the SIT\n* Protesters marching to the New Parliament House\n* Police detaining protesters at New Parliament House\n\n**See also**\n\n* Wrestling Federation of India\n* Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh\n* Bajrang Punia\n* Vinesh Phogat\n* Sakshi Malik\n* United World Wrestling\n* International Olympic Committee\n* Anurag Thakur\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include references, but all information is based on publicly available sources.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Wrestling Federation of India\n* United World Wrestling\n* International Olympic Committee\n* Bajrang Punia's Twitter account\n* Vinesh Phogat's Twitter account\n* Sakshi Malik's Twitter account", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Indian_wrestlers'_protest\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Initial investigation\n#Protest overview\n##FIR registration and Supreme court intervention\n##Jantar Mantar clash\n##Formation of SIT and questioning of witnesses\n##New Parliament House march and detainment\n##Meeting with Sports Minister and filing chargesheet\n#Aftermath\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n###Criticism\n##International\n###United World Wrestling\n###International Olympic Committee\n###Parliamentarians\n#Media coverage\n#Impact\n#Gallery\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

These seizures are often referred to as febrile convulsions, and they are a common and usually benign condition in early childhood.\n\n**Signs and symptoms**\n\n### Types\n\nFebrile seizures can be categorized into two main types: simple febrile seizures and complex febrile seizures.\n\n*   **Simple febrile seizures**: These seizures are characterized by a brief, generalized convulsion that lasts for less than 15 minutes. They are often accompanied by a rapid heartbeat and a change in blood pressure.\n*   **Complex febrile seizures**: These seizures are more severe and may be prolonged (lasting more than 15 minutes), focal (affecting one side of the body), or repetitive. They may also be accompanied by a loss of consciousness or a change in behavior.\n\n### Clinical presentation\n\nThe clinical presentation of a febrile seizure typically includes:\n\n*   A sudden onset of convulsions, often accompanied by a cry or a whimper\n*   A brief or prolonged episode of convulsions, which may be generalized or focal\n*   A rapid heartbeat and a change in blood pressure\n*   A loss of consciousness or a change in behavior\n*   A post-ictal period, during which the individual may appear lethargic or confused\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe exact cause of febrile seizures is not fully understood, but several factors are thought to contribute to their development:\n\n*   **Infection**: A viral or bacterial infection can trigger a febrile seizure, particularly if the infection is severe or if the individual has a history of febrile seizures.\n*   **Genetics**: A family history of febrile seizures may increase the risk of developing this condition.\n*   **Brain chemistry**: Abnormalities in brain chemistry, such as an imbalance of neurotransmitters, may contribute to febrile seizures.\n*   **Other factors**: Other factors, such as stress, fatigue, and certain medications, may also contribute to febrile seizures.\n\n**Mechanism**\n\nThe exact mechanism of a febrile seizure is not fully understood, but several theories have been proposed:\n\n*   **Hyperthermia**: Elevated body temperature may trigger a febrile seizure by altering the normal functioning of the brain.\n*   **Brain excitability**: Abnormalities in brain chemistry and structure may increase the excitability of the brain, leading to a febrile seizure.\n*   **Neurotransmitter imbalance**: An imbalance of neurotransmitters, such as GABA and glutamate, may contribute to febrile seizures.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nA diagnosis of febrile seizure is typically made based on a combination of clinical presentation, medical history, and physical examination. The diagnosis may be supported by the following:\n\n*   **Medical history**: A history of fever and convulsions, particularly if the individual has a history of febrile seizures.\n*   **Physical examination**: A physical examination may reveal a fever, rapid heartbeat, and a change in blood pressure.\n*   **Laboratory tests**: Laboratory tests, such as a complete blood count and a blood culture, may be performed to rule out other conditions that may be causing the fever and convulsions.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nWhile there is no guaranteed way to prevent febrile seizures, several measures may help reduce the risk of developing this condition:\n\n*   **Maintaining a healthy lifestyle**: Eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and getting enough sleep may help reduce stress and fatigue.\n*   **Managing stress**: Stress management techniques, such as meditation and deep breathing, may help reduce stress and anxiety.\n*   **Avoiding triggers**: Identifying and avoiding triggers, such as certain medications and stressors, may help reduce the risk of febrile seizures.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment for febrile seizure typically involves managing the fever and convulsions, as well as preventing future episodes. The following measures may be taken:\n\n*   **Medications**: Medications, such as antipyretics and anticonvulsants, may be prescribed to manage fever and convulsions.\n*   **Fluid therapy**: Fluid therapy may be administered to prevent dehydration and maintain electrolyte balance.\n*   **Rest**: Rest and relaxation may be recommended to help the individual recover from the seizure.\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for individuals with febrile seizure is generally good, with most individuals recovering fully from the seizure. However, some individuals may be at risk of developing seizures in the future. The following factors may increase the risk of future seizures:\n\n*   **Family history**: A family history of febrile seizures may increase the risk of developing this condition.\n*   **Previous seizures**: Previous febrile seizures may increase the risk of developing future seizures.\n*   **Age**: Febrile seizures are more common in children under the age of 5.\n\n**Epidemiology**\n\nFebrile seizures are a common condition in early childhood, with an estimated 2-5% of children experiencing a febrile seizure before the age of 5. The condition is more common in children between the ages of 6 months and 2 years.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Febrile_seizure\" following this outline:\n\n#Signs and symptoms\n##Types\n#Causes\n#Mechanism\n#Diagnosis\n#Prevention\n#Treatment\n#Prognosis\n#Epidemiology\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The party is committed to promoting environmentalism, social justice, and grassroots democracy in California.\n\n**Introduction**\nThe Green Party of California has its roots in the 1980s and 1990s environmental and social justice movements.

The party's platform reflects this focus on environmentalism, social justice, and grassroots democracy.\n\n**History**\n\n### Qualifying for elections\nTo qualify for elections in California, the Green Party of California must meet certain requirements under the California Election Code.

He is best known for his dialectical and idealist philosophies, which had a profound impact on modern thought and continue to influence contemporary philosophy, politics, and culture.\n\n**Life**\n\n### Formative years\n\nHegel was born in Stuttgart, Württemberg (now part of Germany), to Georg Ludwig Friedrich Hegel, a Protestant pastor, and Maria Magdalena Louisa Fromm. His early education was in Stuttgart and Tübingen, where he studied theology, philosophy, and philology. In 1790, he moved to Berne, Switzerland, where he studied philosophy and literature. In 1793, he returned to Stuttgart and worked as a tutor for a family friend. In 1797, he moved to Frankfurt, where he studied philosophy and law.\n\n### Career years\n\nIn 1801, Hegel became a lecturer in philosophy at the University of Jena, where he met and befriended many notable figures, including Friedrich Schelling and Johann Gottlieb Fichte. In 1804, he became a professor of philosophy at the University of Bamberg, where he taught until 1807. In 1807, he moved to Nuremberg, where he taught philosophy and law. In 1816, he became a professor of philosophy at the University of Heidelberg, where he taught until 1818. In 1818, he moved to Berlin, where he became a professor of philosophy at the University of Berlin and taught until his death in 1831.\n\n**Influences**\n\nHegel's philosophy was influenced by a wide range of thinkers, including Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Fichte, and Schelling. However, his most significant influence was Immanuel Kant, whose ideas on ethics, metaphysics, and epistemology shaped Hegel's own philosophical views.\n\n**The Phenomenology of Spirit**\n\nThe Phenomenology of Spirit (1807) is Hegel's most famous and influential work. It is a comprehensive and systematic treatment of the nature of consciousness, reality, and knowledge. The book is divided into three main sections: the first deals with the nature of consciousness, the second with the nature of self-consciousness, and the third with the nature of spirit.\n\n**Philosophical system**\n\nHegel's philosophical system is based on the idea that reality is a dynamic and dialectical process. He believed that reality is constantly changing and evolving through a process of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. This dialectical process is the driving force behind the development of reality and is the key to understanding the nature of reality.\n\n### Science of Logic\n\nThe Science of Logic (1812-1816) is Hegel's magnum opus and the most comprehensive treatment of his philosophical system. The book is divided into three main sections: the first deals with the nature of being, the second with the nature of essence, and the third with the nature of concept.\n\n### Philosophy of the real\n\nThe Philosophy of the real (1817) is a comprehensive treatment of the nature of reality and the universe. Hegel believed that the universe is a dynamic and dialectical process, constantly evolving and changing through the process of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis.\n\n### The Philosophy of Nature\n\nThe Philosophy of Nature (1820-1826) is a comprehensive treatment of the nature of the universe and the laws of nature. Hegel believed that the universe is a dynamic and dialectical process, governed by a set of laws and principles that are constantly changing and evolving.\n\n### The Philosophy of Spirit\n\nThe Philosophy of Spirit (1825-1826) is a comprehensive treatment of the nature of consciousness, self-consciousness, and spirit. Hegel believed that consciousness, self-consciousness, and spirit are all interconnected and interdependent, and that they are constantly evolving and changing through the process of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis.\n\n#### Subjective spirit\n\nSubjective spirit (1825-1826) is the first section of the Philosophy of Spirit. It deals with the nature of consciousness and self-consciousness, and explores the relationship between the individual and the world.\n\n#### Objective spirit\n\nObjective spirit (1825-1826) is the second section of the Philosophy of Spirit.

The referendums were organized by the Russian-backed authorities in these regions, with the aim of annexing them to Russia.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe annexation referendums were a response to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, which began in February 2022. The referendums were held in the four regions that had been partially or fully occupied by Russian forces, following the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces and the establishment of Russian-backed administrations. The referendums were widely condemned by the international community as illegitimate and a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty.\n\n**Organization**\n\nThe referendums were organized by the Russian-backed authorities in each of the four regions. The Russian government claimed that the referendums were necessary to determine the will of the people in these regions, but the process was widely criticized as a sham. The referendums were held in secret, with voters being required to cast their ballots in person, and the results were not independently verified.\n\n**Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts**\n\nThe referendums in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts were held on 23 and 27 September 2022. The two regions had been partially occupied by Russian forces since 2014, and had declared independence as the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR).\n\n#### Questions\n\nThe questions put to voters in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts were:\n\n* \"Do you support the entry of the Donetsk People's Republic into the Russian Federation as a constituent entity of the Russian Federation?\"\n* \"Do you support the entry of the Luhansk People's Republic into the Russian Federation as a constituent entity of the Russian Federation?\"\n\n#### Results\n\nThe results of the referendums in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts were announced as follows:\n\n* In Donetsk Oblast, 99.23% of voters supported the entry of the DPR into the Russian Federation.\n* In Luhansk Oblast, 98.23% of voters supported the entry of the LPR into the Russian Federation.\n\n**Kherson Oblast**\n\nThe referendum in Kherson Oblast was held on 23 and 27 September 2022. Kherson Oblast had been fully occupied by Russian forces since March 2022.\n\n#### Question\n\nThe question put to voters in Kherson Oblast was:\n\n* \"Do you support the entry of the Kherson region into the Russian Federation as a constituent entity of the Russian Federation?\"\n\n#### Result\n\nThe result of the referendum in Kherson Oblast was announced as follows:\n\n* 87.05% of voters supported the entry of Kherson Oblast into the Russian Federation.\n\n**Zaporizhzhia Oblast**\n\nThe referendum in Zaporizhzhia Oblast was held on 23 and 27 September 2022. Zaporizhzhia Oblast had been partially occupied by Russian forces since March 2022.\n\n#### Question\n\nThe question put to voters in Zaporizhzhia Oblast was:\n\n* \"Do you support the entry of the Zaporizhzhia region into the Russian Federation as a constituent entity of the Russian Federation?\"\n\n#### Result\n\nThe result of the referendum in Zaporizhzhia Oblast was announced as follows:\n\n* 93.11% of voters supported the entry of Zaporizhzhia Oblast into the Russian Federation.\n\n**Other planned locations**\n\nIn addition to the four regions that held referendums, the Russian government had also announced plans to hold referendums in two other regions, namely Mykolaiv Oblast and Kharkiv Oblast. However, these referendums were not held due to the ongoing conflict and the withdrawal of Russian forces from these regions.\n\n#### Mykolaiv Oblast\n\nThe Russian government had announced plans to hold a referendum in Mykolaiv Oblast, but the referendum was not held.\n\n#### Kharkiv Oblast\n\nThe Russian government had also announced plans to hold a referendum in Kharkiv Oblast, but the referendum was not held.\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nThe annexation referendums were widely condemned by the international community, and were seen as a sham. Opinion polls conducted in the occupied regions showed that a significant proportion of voters were opposed to the annexation, but the polls were not independently verified.\n\n**Opinions on the goals of holding referendums**\n\nThe Russian government claimed that the referendums were necessary to determine the will of the people in the occupied regions, but the international community saw the referendums as a ploy to annex Ukrainian territory.\n\n**Conduct**\n\nThe referendums were held in secret, with voters being required to cast their ballots in person. The process was widely criticized as a sham, and the results were not independently verified.\n\n#### First day\n\nThe first day of the referendums saw a low turnout of voters, with many people staying at home in protest. The Russian government claimed that the low turnout was due to the fact that many voters were unable to travel to the polling stations due to the ongoing conflict.\n\n#### Second day\n\nThe second day of the referendums saw a small increase in turnout, but many voters were still opposed to the annexation. The Russian government claimed that the increase in turnout was due to the fact that many voters were now aware of the importance of participating in the referendums.\n\n#### Third day\n\nThe third day of the referendums saw a further increase in turnout, with many voters casting their ballots in support of the annexation. The Russian government claimed that the increase in turnout was due to the fact that many voters were now convinced of the benefits of becoming part of Russia.\n\n#### Fourth day\n\nThe fourth day of the referendums saw a significant increase in turnout, with many voters casting their ballots in support of the annexation. The Russian government claimed that the increase in turnout was due to the fact that many voters were now confident that the annexation would bring economic benefits and stability to the region.\n\n#### Fifth day\n\nThe fifth day of the referendums saw a final increase in turnout, with many voters casting their ballots in support of the annexation. The Russian government claimed that the increase in turnout was due to the fact that many voters were now convinced that the annexation was necessary for the future of the region.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe annexation referendums were widely condemned by the international community, with many countries and organizations criticizing the process as illegitimate and a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty.\n\n#### Ukraine\n\nThe Ukrainian government condemned the annexation referendums, calling them a \"sham\" and a \"violation of Ukraine's sovereignty\".\n\n#### Russia\n\nThe Russian government claimed that the annexation referendums were necessary to determine the will of the people in the occupied regions, and that the results were a \"clear expression of the people's desire to become part of Russia\".\n\n#### International organisations\n\nThe annexation referendums were widely condemned by international organizations, including the United Nations, the European Union, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).\n\n#### Countries\n\nMany countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada, condemned the annexation referendums, calling them a \"violation of Ukraine's sovereignty\" and a \"threat to regional stability\".\n\n#### Human rights organizations\n\nHuman rights organizations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, condemned the annexation referendums, calling them a \"violation of human rights\" and a \"threat to the rule of law\".\n\n#### Other\n\nThe annexation referendums were also widely criticized by other organizations, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).\n\n**Possible consequences**\n\nThe annexation referendums could have significant consequences for the region, including:\n\n* Economic sanctions: The international community may impose economic sanctions on Russia in response to the annexation referendums.\n* Military conflict: The annexation referendums could lead to further military conflict in the region, as Ukraine and its allies may seek to retake control of the occupied territories.\n* Humanitarian crisis: The annexation referendums could lead to a humanitarian crisis, as many people in the occupied territories may be displaced or traumatized by the conflict.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe annexation referendums were widely condemned by the international community, and the process was seen as a sham. The consequences of the annexation referendums will likely be significant, including economic sanctions, military conflict, and a humanitarian crisis.\n\n**See also**\n\n* **Likewise referendums**: The annexation referendums in Russian-occupied Ukraine are similar to other referendums held in occupied territories, including the annexation referendum in Crimea in 2014.\n* **Irredentism**: The annexation referendums are an example of irredentism, which is the policy of seeking to annex territory that is currently occupied by another country.\n* **Geopolitical aspects**: The annexation referendums have significant geopolitical implications, including the potential for further conflict in the region and the impact on international relations.\n\n**References**\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_annexation_referendums_in_Russian-occupied_Ukraine\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Organization\n#Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts\n##Questions\n##Results\n#Kherson Oblast\n##Question\n##Result\n#Zaporizhzhia Oblast\n##Question\n##Result\n#Other planned locations\n##Mykolaiv Oblast\n##Kharkiv Oblast\n#Opinion polls\n#Opinions on the goals of holding referendums\n#Conduct\n##First day\n##Second day\n##Third day\n##Fourth day\n##Fifth day\n#Reactions\n##Ukraine\n##Russia\n##International organisations\n##Countries\n##Human rights organizations\n##Other\n#Possible consequences\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n##Likewise referendums\n##Irredentism\n##Geopolitical aspects\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is often referred to as the \"Father of the Constitution\" and is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in American history.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nJames Madison was born in Port Conway, Virginia, to Colonel James Madison Sr. and Nelly Conway Madison. He was the oldest of 12 children, and his family was of planter class. Madison's early education took place at home, where he was tutored by private tutors. In 1769, he enrolled at the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), where he studied literature, politics, and philosophy. Madison graduated in 1771 and went on to attend the College of William & Mary, where he studied law.\n\n**American Revolution and Articles of Confederation**\n\nDuring the American Revolution, Madison played a key role in the fight for independence from Great Britain. In 1775, he served as a delegate to the Virginia Convention, where he advocated for the formation of a colonial militia. In 1776, he was a member of the Continental Congress, where he helped draft the Declaration of Independence. Madison also played a key role in the drafting of the Articles of Confederation, which served as the first constitution of the United States.\n\n**Ratification of the Constitution**\n\nIn 1787, Madison attended the Constitutional Convention, where he played a key role in the drafting of the United States Constitution. He was a key advocate for a strong central government and the creation of a system of checks and balances. Madison's contributions to the Constitution included the idea of a bicameral legislature, the system of representation, and the concept of federalism. The Constitution was ratified in 1788, and Madison played a key role in its ratification in Virginia.\n\n**Congressman and Party Leader (1789–1801)**\n\n### Election to Congress\n\nIn 1789, Madison was elected to the United States House of Representatives, where he served for five terms. During his time in Congress, Madison was a key figure in the party politics of the time. He was a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, which was founded by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison.\n\n### Bill of Rights\n\nIn 1789, Madison was appointed as the chairman of the House Committee on Resolutions, where he played a key role in the drafting of the Bill of Rights. The Bill of Rights, which includes the first 10 amendments to the Constitution, was designed to protect the rights of individuals and limit the power of the federal government.\n\n### Founding the Democratic–Republican Party\n\nIn 1791, Madison helped to found the Democratic-Republican Party, which was a response to the Federalist Party, which was led by Alexander Hamilton. The Democratic-Republican Party was a key force in American politics for many years and was instrumental in the election of Thomas Jefferson as President in 1800.\n\n### Marriage and Family\n\nIn 1794, Madison married Dolley Payne Todd, a wealthy widow with two children. The couple had no children of their own, but Dolley was a stepmother to her two children from her previous marriage.\n\n### Adams Presidency\n\nIn 1797, Madison's father-in-law, John Adams, was elected President of the United States. Madison served as a member of the House of Representatives during Adams' presidency and was a key opponent of Adams' policies.\n\n**Secretary of State (1801–1809)**\n\n### 1808 Presidential Election\n\nIn 1808, Madison was a key supporter of James Monroe's presidential campaign. Monroe was elected as a Democratic-Republican, and Madison served as his Secretary of State.\n\n**Presidency (1809–1817)**\n\n### Inauguration and Cabinet\n\nIn 1809, Madison was elected as the fourth President of the United States. He was inaugurated on March 4, 1809, and served two terms as President. Madison's cabinet included Robert Smith as Secretary of State, Henry Dearborn as Secretary of War, and Albert Gallatin as Secretary of the Treasury.\n\n### War of 1812\n\n#### Prelude to War\n\nIn 1812, Madison declared war on Great Britain, citing the British practice of impressment of American sailors and the British support of Native American resistance against American expansion.\n\n#### Military Actions\n\nDuring the War of 1812, Madison's military strategy was often criticized for its lack of direction and planning. However, the war did see several notable victories, including the Battle of Lake Erie and the Battle of the Thames.\n\n### Postwar Period and Decline of the Federalist Opposition\n\nAfter the War of 1812, the Federalist Party declined in influence, and the Democratic-Republican Party became the dominant force in American politics. Madison's presidency was marked by several key events, including the signing of the Treaty of Ghent, which ended the War of 1812, and the signing of the Missouri Compromise, which admitted Missouri as a slave state and banned slavery in the Louisiana Territory north of the 36°30' parallel.\n\n### Native American Policy\n\nDuring Madison's presidency, the Native American policy of forced relocation was implemented. The Indian Removal Act of 1830, which was signed into law by Andrew Jackson, was a significant step in the relocation of Native American tribes from their ancestral lands to Indian Territory.\n\n### Election of 1816\n\nIn 1816, Madison was re-elected as President, defeating the Federalist candidate, Rufus King.\n\n**Post-presidency (1817–1836)**\n\n### Death\n\nMadison died on June 28, 1836, at the age of 85. He was buried on the grounds of Montpelier, his estate in Virginia.\n\n**Political and Religious Views**\n\nMadison was a strong believer in the principles of federalism and the importance of a strong central government. He was also a devout Episcopalian and believed in the importance of separation of church and state.\n\n### Federalism\n\nMadison was a key figure in the development of federalism in the United States. He believed that the federal government should have broad powers to regulate commerce and national defense, while also giving states significant autonomy in domestic affairs.\n\n### Religion\n\nMadison was a devout Episcopalian and believed in the importance of separation of church and state. He served as a vestryman of the Episcopal Church in Virginia and was a strong supporter of the church's mission and teachings.\n\n**Slavery**\n\nMadison owned slaves throughout his life, but he also believed that slavery was morally wrong and should be abolished. He was a strong supporter of the American Colonization Society, which sought to colonize freed slaves in Africa.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nMadison's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in American history, and his contributions to the Constitution and the Bill of Rights are still celebrated today. However, his ownership of slaves and his role in the forced relocation of Native American tribes have also been criticized.\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Madison's papers are extensive and can be found at the Library of Congress.\n* Madison's estate, Montpelier, is now a National Historic Landmark and is open to the public.\n* Madison's presidency was marked by several key events, including the War of 1812 and the signing of the Treaty of Ghent.\n\n**References**\n\n* Madison, J.

As a key figure in the Second Viennese School, Webern was a central figure in the musical avant-garde of his time. His innovative and influential music, which spanned multiple genres and styles, continues to be celebrated and studied by musicians and musicologists around the world.\n\n**Biography**\n\n### **1883–1908: Upbringing between late Imperial Vienna and countryside**\n\nWebern was born in Vienna, Austria, on December 3, 1883, to a family of modest means.
