Following her death on September 8, 2022, Elizabeth II's coffin was placed in Westminster Hall in London, where it lay in state from September 14 to 19, 2022. The queue for the lying-in-state was a significant event that received widespread attention and media coverage.\n\n# Precedents\n\nThe tradition of lying in state, also known as lying in repose, is a centuries-old practice in which a deceased monarch's coffin is placed in a public space for people to pay their respects. This tradition dates back to the 16th century, when monarchs would lie in state in their churches or cathedrals. Over time, the tradition evolved to include placing the coffin in a grand hall or chapel, where it would be viewed by the public.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, lying in state is typically reserved for monarchs and senior members of the royal family. However, there have been instances where the tradition has been extended to other notable figures, such as Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher. The queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was the largest and most significant in recent history.\n\n# Routes\n\n## Main queue\n\nThe main queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was a long procession that wound its way through the streets of central London. The queue started at Southwark Park in Bermondsey, a location chosen for its proximity to the Thames and its accessibility by public transport. From there, the queue snaked its way through the city, passing by landmarks such as the Tower of London and the Monument.\n\nThe main queue was estimated to be around 5 miles long at its peak, making it one of the longest queues in history. The queue was organized into sections, each with its own waiting area and refreshment facilities. To manage the queue, the authorities set up a system of gates and barriers, which were controlled by electronic ticketing systems.\n\n## Accessible queue\n\nIn addition to the main queue, an accessible queue was established for people with disabilities, elderly citizens, and those who required special assistance. The accessible queue was located in the vicinity of the main queue, but was separated from it by a series of barriers and gates.\n\nThe accessible queue was designed to be more efficient and better managed than the main queue. It was organized into smaller sections, each with its own waiting area and refreshment facilities. To ensure that people with disabilities had access to the lying-in-state, the authorities also set up a system of ramps and lifts to facilitate entry into Westminster Hall.\n\n# Length\n\nThe length of the queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was a remarkable feature of the event. At its peak, the queue stretched for over 5 miles, making it one of the longest queues in history. The queue was so long that it took people several hours to reach the front, even when they arrived early in the morning.\n\nTo give an idea of the scale of the queue, it is estimated that over 100,000 people passed through the queue during the four days it was open. This represents a significant proportion of the population of the city of London, which is around 8.9 million people.\n\n# Organisation\n\nThe organisation of the queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was a complex and challenging task. The authorities had to manage a large number of people, while also ensuring that the queue was safe and orderly.\n\nTo achieve this, the authorities set up a system of gates and barriers, which were controlled by electronic ticketing systems. They also established a network of stewards and volunteers, who were responsible for managing the queue and assisting people with disabilities.\n\nIn addition to managing the queue, the authorities also had to deal with a range of logistical challenges, including providing refreshment facilities, toilets, and other amenities. They also had to coordinate with the police and other agencies to ensure that the event was secure and safe.\n\n## Exemptions from queuing\n\nExemptions from queuing were granted to a range of people, including members of the royal family, dignitaries, and people with disabilities. These exemptions were granted to ensure that these individuals could pay their respects to Elizabeth II in a dignified and respectful manner.\n\nMembers of the royal family, including Prince Charles and Prince William, were exempt from queuing and were able to enter Westminster Hall through a private entrance. Dignitaries, including politicians and officials, were also exempt from queuing and were able to attend the lying-in-state through a special entrance.\n\nPeople with disabilities were also exempt from queuing and were able to enter Westminster Hall through a designated entrance. This entrance was equipped with ramps and lifts, which enabled people with mobility impairments to access the hall.\n\n# Participation and incidents\n\nParticipation in the queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was widespread, with people from all over the UK and the world attending the event. The queue was a significant social and cultural phenomenon, with people coming together to pay their respects to the deceased monarch.\n\nHowever, there were also some incidents and challenges associated with the queue. Some people complained about the length of the queue and the difficulty of getting to the front. Others reported problems with the organisation of the queue, including long waiting times and inadequate facilities.\n\nDespite these challenges, the queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was a remarkable and moving experience for many people. It was a testament to the enduring popularity and respect of the British monarchy, and the impact that Elizabeth II had on the lives of people around the world.\n\n# Responses and media coverage\n\nThe response to the queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was widespread and enthusiastic. People from all over the UK and the world attended the event, and it was covered extensively by the media.\n\nThe queue was a major news story, with coverage on television, radio, and online. The media reported on the length of the queue, the organisation of the event, and the reactions of people who attended. They also spoke to people who had waited in the queue, and reported on their experiences.\n\nThe queue was also a social media phenomenon, with people sharing their experiences and photos on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. The hashtag #queueforelizabeth was a trending topic on Twitter, and people used the hashtag to share their stories and photos.\n\nOverall, the queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II was a significant event that received widespread attention and media coverage. It was a testament to the enduring popularity and respect of the British monarchy, and the impact that Elizabeth II had on the lives of people around the world.\n\n# References\n\n(Note: This section is not included in the original request, but it is a standard section in Wikipedia articles)\n\n# External links\n\n(Note: This section is not included in the original request, but it is a standard section in Wikipedia articles)\n\nThis article does not have any external links.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Queue_for_the_lying-in-state_of_Elizabeth_II\" following this outline:\n\n#Precedents\n#Routes\n##Main queue\n##Accessible queue\n#Length\n#Organisation\n##Exemptions from queuing\n#Participation and incidents\n#Responses and media coverage\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Located at the crossroads of East Asia, Taiwan has been a strategic location for trade, cultural exchange, and warfare throughout its history.\n\n**Prehistory**\n\nThe earliest known human habitation in Taiwan dates back to the late Paleolithic era, around 20,000 years ago. The indigenous peoples of Taiwan, known as the Aboriginal peoples, developed a rich and diverse culture that flourished for thousands of years. They developed a complex system of agriculture, hunting, and gathering, and developed a sophisticated spiritual and social system.\n\nThe Aboriginal peoples of Taiwan were organized into various tribes, each with their own distinct language, culture, and customs.

The country is situated primarily in North America, with a smaller portion in Central America. The United States is the world's third-largest country by both area and population, and it is a global leader in politics, economics, and culture.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name \"United States\" was first used in the Treaty of Paris in 1783, which ended the American Revolutionary War and recognized the sovereignty of the United States. The name was derived from the phrase \"United States of America,\" which was used in the Declaration of Independence in 1776. The phrase was chosen to reflect the unity and solidarity of the American colonies, which had declared independence from Great Britain.\n\n**History**\n\n### Indigenous peoples\n\nFor thousands of years, various indigenous peoples inhabited the territory that is now the United States. These groups, including the Native Americans, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians, developed complex societies and cultures that were often in conflict with European colonizers. The arrival of European explorers and colonizers had a devastating impact on the indigenous populations, who were subjected to violence, displacement, and forced assimilation.\n\n### European settlement and conflict (1607–1765)\n\nIn 1607, the English established the Jamestown Colony in present-day Virginia, marking the beginning of European settlement in the United States. Over the next century, other European colonies were established, including the Plymouth Colony in present-day Massachusetts and the New Amsterdam Colony in present-day New York. The colonies developed distinct economies, cultures, and systems of government, which often led to conflict with the British government. The French and Indian War (1754-1763) marked a significant turning point in the history of the colonies, as the British government imposed new taxes and laws that sparked widespread resistance.\n\n### American Revolution and the early republic (1765–1800)\n\nIn 1765, the British government imposed the Stamp Act, which led to widespread protests and boycotts in the colonies. The Boston Massacre in 1770 and the Boston Tea Party in 1773 further escalated tensions, leading to the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War in 1775. The Continental Army, led by George Washington, defeated the British in 1781, and the Treaty of Paris was signed in 1783, recognizing American independence. The United States Constitution was ratified in 1788, establishing a federal system of government and paving the way for the growth of the young nation.\n\n### Westward expansion and Civil War (1800–1865)\n\nThe early 19th century saw a period of rapid westward expansion, as the United States acquired vast territories through the Louisiana Purchase (1803) and the Mexican-American War (1846-1848). The California Gold Rush (1848-1855) drew thousands of settlers to the West Coast, and the construction of the transcontinental railroad (1863-1869) further facilitated westward expansion. However, the expansion of slavery into new territories and states led to increasing tensions between the North and South, culminating in the Civil War (1861-1865). The Union victory and the abolition of slavery marked a significant turning point in American history.\n\n### Post–Civil War era (1865–1917)\n\nThe Reconstruction Era (1865-1877) saw the passage of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the Constitution, which abolished slavery and granted voting rights to African American men. The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw significant economic growth, driven by industrialization and technological innovation. The United States emerged as a global power, with significant military and economic influence.\n\n### Rise as a superpower (1917–1945)\n\nThe United States entered World War I in 1917, and the war marked a significant turning point in the country's emergence as a global superpower. The Roaring Twenties saw a period of economic growth and cultural transformation, marked by the rise of jazz, cinema, and mass media. The Great Depression (1929-1941) had a profound impact on American society and politics, leading to the New Deal and the establishment of the welfare state. The United States played a leading role in World War II, contributing to the Allied victory and emerging as a global superpower.\n\n### Cold War (1945–1991)\n\nThe post-war period saw the emergence of the Cold War, a decades-long ideological and military conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. The United States played a leading role in the formation of the United Nations and the creation of the European Economic Community. The country also played a significant role in the decolonization of Africa and Asia, and the emergence of the Non-Aligned Movement.\n\n### Contemporary (1991–present)\n\nThe end of the Cold War marked a significant turning point in American history, as the country emerged as the world's sole superpower. The Gulf War (1991) and the War on Terror (2001-present) have marked significant military interventions in the Middle East and Central Asia. The United States has also played a leading role in international trade and economic institutions, such as the World Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund.\n\n**Geography**\n\nThe United States is a vast and diverse country, covering an area of approximately 9.8 million square kilometers (3.8 million square miles). The country is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the Pacific Ocean to the west, and the Arctic Ocean to the north. The country's geography is characterized by mountains, forests, and vast prairies, with significant regional variations in climate and topography.\n\n### Climate\n\nThe climate in the United States varies significantly from region to region, with cold winters in the north and hot summers in the south. The country experiences a range of climate types, including tropical, subtropical, temperate, and polar climates. The climate is also influenced by the presence of mountains, which can create rain shadows and microclimates.\n\n### Biodiversity and conservation\n\nThe United States is home to a vast array of biodiversity, with over 800 species of mammals, 700 species of birds, and 30,000 species of plants.

She was born on January 6, 1412, in the village of Domremy, in the province of Lorraine, France. Joan's life is a testament to her unwavering faith, courage, and conviction, which have inspired countless people throughout history.\n\n**Birth and historical background**\n\nJoan of Arc was born in a time of great turmoil in France. The Hundred Years' War, a dynastic conflict between the kingdoms of England and France, had been raging for over a century. The French monarchy was in disarray, and the country was plagued by internal strife, corruption, and external threats. Against this backdrop, Joan's birth marked the beginning of a remarkable journey that would change the course of French history.\n\n**Early life**\n\nJoan grew up in a small village surrounded by rolling hills and forests. She was the youngest of five children, and her family lived a simple, rural life. Her parents, Jacques and Isabelle Arc, were devout Catholics who instilled in Joan a strong faith from an early age. Joan's upbringing was marked by hard work, prayer, and a deep connection to the natural world. She developed a strong sense of spirituality and a conviction that she had a divine mission to fulfill.\n\n**Chinon**\n\nIn 1429, at the age of 17, Joan traveled to the city of Vaucouleurs to petition Robert de Baudricourt, the garrison commander, for an audience with Charles VII, the King of France. She claimed to have received visions from God, Saint Catherine, and Saint Margaret, instructing her to drive the English out of France and crown the king. Baudricourt was skeptical, but eventually, he relented, and Joan traveled to the royal court at Chinon.\n\n**Military campaigns**\n\nJoan's military campaigns were a series of daring and successful operations that shook the foundations of the English occupation. She led the French army to several victories, including the siege of Orléans, the Loire Campaign, and the Coronation and siege of Paris.\n\n### Orléans\n\nThe siege of Orléans was a pivotal moment in Joan's military career. The city had been under siege by the English for over a year, and the population was on the brink of starvation. Joan arrived at the city gates in April 1429, accompanied by a small contingent of soldiers. She convinced the city's leaders to let her enter the city, and she quickly gained the respect and admiration of the people. Joan led the French army to a series of victories, including the capture of the Tourelles fortress, which had been the English strongpoint. The siege was eventually lifted, and the city was saved.\n\n### Loire Campaign\n\nThe Loire Campaign was a series of battles fought along the Loire River. Joan led the French army to a series of victories, including the capture of the city of Jargeau and the defeat of the English at the Battle of Patay. The campaign was marked by fierce fighting and strategic maneuvering, and it ultimately led to the French capture of the city of Orléans.\n\n### Coronation and siege of Paris\n\nIn July 1429, Joan led the French army to the city of Paris, where the King of France was to be crowned. The coronation was a grand ceremony, and Joan played a key role in the proceedings. She also led the French army to a series of victories, including the capture of the city of Chartres and the defeat of the English at the Battle of Bourges. However, the siege of Paris was ultimately unsuccessful, and the city remained under English control.\n\n### Campaign against Perrinet Gressart\n\nIn 1430, Joan led a campaign against Perrinet Gressart, a French nobleman who had defected to the English. The campaign was marked by fierce fighting and strategic maneuvering, and it ultimately led to the defea", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Joan_of_Arc\" following this outline:\n\n#Name\n#Birth and historical background\n#Early life\n#Chinon\n#Military campaigns\n##Orléans\n##Loire Campaign\n##Coronation and siege of Paris\n##Campaign against Perrinet Gressart\n##Siege of Compiègne and capture\n#Trials and execution\n##Trial\n##Execution\n##Aftermath and rehabilitation trial\n#Visions\n#Clothing\n#Legacy\n##Military leader and symbol of France\n##Saint and heroic woman\n#See also\n#References\n##Notes\n##Citations\n##Sources\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The event took place on November 26, 2022, at the TD Garden in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\n**Production**\n\n### Background\n\nSurvivor Series is one of the \"Big Four\" professional wrestling events in WWE, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Royal Rumble. The event has historically featured the traditional Survivor Series match, a five-on-five tag team match where the winning team earns the right to claim bragging rights as the superior brand. For the 2022 event, WWE introduced a new concept, \"WarGames,\" a steel cage match featuring two teams of four wrestlers each, with the stipulation that the losing team must disband after the match.\n\n### Storylines\n\nThe buildup to Survivor Series: WarGames began several weeks prior to the event, with various storylines and feuds developing between wrestlers on both the Raw and SmackDown brands. One of the main storylines involved the Raw Women's Champion, Bianca Belair, who was set to face the SmackDown Women's Champion, Ronda Rousey, in a championship unification match. Another storyline saw the Raw men's champion, Roman Reigns, facing a challenge from a mystery opponent, later revealed to be Finn Bálor.\n\n## Event\n\n### Preliminary matches\n\nThe event began with a series of preliminary matches, featuring wrestlers from both the Raw and SmackDown brands.

The second match featured the Raw tag team champions, The Usos, facing off against The Viking Raiders in a non-title match, with The Usos winning.\n\nThe third match saw the Raw Women's Champion, Bianca Belair, face Carmella in a non-title match, with Belair winning. The fourth match featured the SmackDown tag team champions, The Usos, facing off against The Street Profits in a non-title match, with The Usos winning. The fifth match saw the Raw men's champion, Roman Reigns, face Finn Bálor in a non-title match, with Reigns winning.\n\n### Main event\n\nThe main event of the evening was the WarGames match, featuring two teams of four wrestlers each. The first team, known as \"Team Raw,\" consisted of the Raw Women's Champion, Bianca Belair, the Raw men's champion, Roman Reigns, and the Raw tag team champions, The Usos. The second team, known as \"Team SmackDown,\" consisted of the SmackDown Women's Champion, Ronda Rousey, the SmackDown men's champion, Drew McIntyre, and the SmackDown tag team champions, The New Day.\n\nThe match began with the two teams facing off in the ring, before being released into the steel cage. The match was a chaotic and intense contest, with all eight wrestlers fighting for their respective teams. In the end, Team Raw emerged victorious, with Roman Reigns pinning Drew McIntyre to earn the win for his team.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Commercial\n\nThe event was a commercial success, with WWE reporting a sold-out crowd of over 12,000 fans at the TD Garden. The event was also available to stream on the WWE Network, with a reported 500,000 viewers tuning in to the event.\n\n### Critical\n\nThe event received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising the action and athleticism of the wrestlers, while others criticized the storytelling and booking of the event. The WarGames match was widely praised, with many considering it to be one of the best matches of the year.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n### Raw\n\nThe aftermath of the event saw Team Raw celebrating their victory in the WarGames match. Roman Reigns, the Raw men's champion, cut a promo, thanking his teammates for their help in earning the victory. Bianca Belair, the Raw Women's Champion, also cut a promo, thanking her teammates and vowing to continue her reign as champion.\n\n### SmackDown\n\nThe aftermath of the event saw Team SmackDown regrouping and strategizing for their next move. Ronda Rousey, the SmackDown Women's Champion, cut a promo, vowing to take down Bianca Belair and become the new Raw Women's Champion. Drew McIntyre, the SmackDown men's champion, also cut a promo, vowing to take down Roman Reigns and become the new Raw men's champion.\n\n**Results**\n\n* Becky Lynch defeated Doudrop\n* The Usos defeated The Viking Raiders\n* Bianca Belair defeated Carmella\n* The Usos defeated The Street Profits\n* Roman Reigns defeated Finn Bálor\n* Team Raw (Bianca Belair, Roman Reigns, and The Usos) defeated Team SmackDown (Ronda Rousey, Drew McIntyre, and The New Day) in the WarGames match\n\n**References**\n\n* \n* \n\n**External links**\n\n* Survivor Series: WarGames (2022) at Cagematch\n* Survivor Series: WarGames (2022) at WrestlingData", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Survivor_Series:_WarGames_(2022)\" following this outline:\n\n#Production\n##Background\n##Storylines\n#Event\n##Preliminary matches\n##Main event\n#Reception\n##Commercial\n##Critical\n#Aftermath\n##Raw\n##SmackDown\n#Results\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This article provides an overview of the Russian forces involved, their administrative chain of command, and the various units that have participated in the conflict.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine marked a significant escalation of the conflict in the Donbas region, which had been ongoing since 2014. The invasion saw a large-scale deployment of Russian military forces, including ground troops, air power, and naval assets. The order of battle of the Russian forces involved in the invasion has been shaped by the country's military doctrine, which emphasizes the use of combined arms and joint operations.\n\n**Russian Forces in 2022**\n\nThe Russian military forces deployed in Ukraine in 2022 were organized under a clear administrative chain of command.\n\n### Administrative Chain of Command\n\nThe Russian military forces in Ukraine were initially commanded by the Russian Ministry of Defence (MoD) through the Western Military District (WMD). The WMD is one of the four main military districts of the Russian Armed Forces, and it is responsible for the country's western border. The WMD is headquartered in Saint Petersburg and is commanded by General Anatoly Sidorov.\n\nIn February 2022, the Russian MoD appointed General Sergei Surovikin as the commander of the Russian forces in Ukraine. Surovikin is a career air force officer who had previously served as the commander of the Russian Aerospace Forces. He was appointed to lead the joint task force in Ukraine, which was given the designation \"Special Military Operation\" (SMO).\n\n### Initial Force Groupings\n\nThe Russian forces in Ukraine were initially grouped into several task forces, each with its own area of responsibility. These task forces were:\n\n* The Southern Task Force, which was responsible for the southern Ukraine front and was led by General Alexander Gerasimov.\n* The Western Task Force, which was responsible for the western Ukraine front and was led by General Sergey Kisel.\n* The Eastern Task Force, which was responsible for the eastern Ukraine front and was led by General Sergey Kuzovlev.\n\nThese task forces were later reorganized and re-designated as part of the joint task force, which was given the designation \"Joint Group of Forces\" (JGF).\n\n**Russian Leaders 2022-23**\n\nSeveral Russian military leaders played key roles in the invasion of Ukraine.\n\n* General Sergei Surovikin: Commander of the Russian forces in Ukraine (February 2022 - present).\n* General Anatoly Sidorov: Commander of the Western Military District (February 2022 - present).\n* General Alexander Gerasimov: Commander of the Southern Task Force (February 2022 - present).\n* General Sergey Kisel: Commander of the Western Task Force (February 2022 - present).\n* General Sergey Kuzovlev: Commander of the Eastern Task Force (February 2022 - present).\n\n**Russian Forces**\n\nThe Russian forces involved in the invasion of Ukraine included a range of military units and formations.\n\n### Mercenaries\n\nThe Russian military has also employed private military companies (PMCs) in Ukraine, including the Wagner Group and the PMC Zaslon. These PMCs have been involved in combat operations and have been accused of committing human rights abuses.\n\n### Militias\n\nThe Russian military has also deployed militia units in Ukraine, including the Donbas militia and the Vostok militia. These militia units have been involved in combat operations and have been accused of committing human rights abuses.\n\n### Reserve Units of the Russian Armed Forces\n\nThe Russian military has also deployed reserve units in Ukraine, including the 76th Guards Air Assault Division and the 98th Guards Airborne Division. These units have been involved in combat operations and have been accused of committing human rights abuses.\n\n### Chechens\n\nThe Russian military has also deployed Chechen units in Ukraine, including the Chechen special forces and the Kadyrovtsy. These units have been involved in combat operations and have been accused of committing human rights abuses.\n\n### Spetsnaz Units\n\nThe Russian military has also deployed spetsnaz units in Ukraine, including the Spetsnaz Brigade and the Spetsnaz Regiment. These units have been involved in combat operations and have been accused of committing human rights abuses.\n\n### Joint Group of Forces\n\nIn March 2022, the Russian MoD announced the establishment of the Joint Group of Forces (JGF), which would be responsible for the overall coordination of Russian military operations in Ukraine. The JGF is led by General Sergei Surovikin and includes units from the Russian Ground Forces, the Russian Air Force, and the Russian Navy.\n\n**Ukrainian Forces**\n\nThe Ukrainian military has also played a significant role in the conflict, including the Ukrainian Ground Forces, the Ukrainian Air Force, and the Ukrainian Navy.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Donbas conflict\n* Military of Russia\n* Military of Ukraine\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The Russian military has been accused of committing human rights abuses in Ukraine, including the use of cluster munitions and the targeting of civilians.\n* The conflict in Ukraine has resulted in significant economic and humanitarian costs, including the displacement of millions of people and the destruction of infrastructure.\n* The Russian military has been accused of using propaganda and disinformation to justify its actions in Ukraine.\n\nThis article provides an overview of the Russian forces involved in the invasion of Ukraine, including their administrative chain of command and the various units that have participated in the conflict.

The dynasty is said to have ruled Iran before the Kayanian dynasty, which is the central dynasty in the Shahnameh, the national epic of Iran. The Pishdadian dynasty is also mentioned in various other ancient sources, including the works of the 9th-century Persian historian Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari.\n\n**Origins, etymology and sources**\n\nThe origins and etymology of the Pishdadian dynasty are unclear. The name \"Pishdadian\" is thought to be derived from the name of the first king, Pishdadian, who is said to have been a descendant of Cain, the first son of Adam. The dynasty is also associated with the biblical figure of Noah, who is said to have founded the city of Aratta in Mesopotamia.\n\n**The Shahnameh and Zoroastrian tradition**\n\nThe Shahnameh, written by the 10th-century Persian poet Ferdowsi, is the primary source of information on the Pishdadian dynasty. In the Shahnameh, the Pishdadian dynasty is described as a series of nine kings, each of whom ruled Iran for a period of time. The Shahnameh portrays the Pishdadian dynasty as a golden age in Iranian history, during which the country was prosperous and peaceful.\n\n### Overview\n\nThe Pishdadian dynasty is said to have begun with the reign of Pishdadian himself, who is credited with founding the city of Tishtrya in Mesopotamia. Following Pishdadian's death, the throne was passed to his son, Kayumarth, who is said to have expanded the empire and established the city of Kashville. The dynasty continued through a series of kings, each of whom is said to have contributed to the prosperity and growth of the empire.\n\n### The kings\n\nThe following is a list of the nine kings of the Pishdadian dynasty, as described in the Shahnameh:\n\n1. Pishdadian, the founder of the dynasty\n2. Kayumarth, the son of Pishdadian, who expanded the empire\n3. Hushang, the third king, who is said to have introduced the use of metal tools\n4. Tahmuras, the fourth king, who is credited with the introduction of agriculture\n5. Jamshid, the fifth king, who is said to have built the city of Aratta\n6. Dejavad, the sixth king, who is credited with the introduction of writing\n7. Tur, the seventh king, who is said to have built the city of Tishtrya\n8. Pishdad, the eighth king, who is credited with the introduction of the use of fire\n9. Zaw: al-Dahhak, the ninth and final king of the dynasty, who is said to have ruled for 120 years\n\n**Tabari and the Muslim narratives**\n\nThe Muslim historian Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari provides an alternative account of the Pishdadian dynasty, which is based on the Quran and the Hadith. In the Tabari narrative, the Pishdadian dynasty is portrayed as a series of five kings, each of whom is said to have ruled Iran before the reign of the Prophet Muhammad.\n\n### The first Pishdadian kings and the conflict with Iblis\n\nAccording to the Tabari narrative, the first Pishdadian king was Pishdadian himself, who is said to have been a descendant of Cain. Pishdadian is credited with the construction of the city of Aratta, which is said to have been a place of great beauty and prosperity. However, the city was destroyed by the devil Iblis, who is said to have been a great enemy of the Pishdadian dynasty.\n\n### From Jam al-Shidh to Zaw: al-Dahhak and war with the Turks\n\nThe Tabari narrative also describes the reign of the Pishdadian kings who followed Pishdadian, including Jam al-Shidh, who is said to have expanded the empire, and Zaw: al-Dahhak, who is credited with the introduction of the use of metal tools. However, the dynasty is said to have been eventually destroyed by the Turks, who are described as a great enemy of the Pishdadian kings.\n\n**Significance**\n\nThe Pishdadian dynasty is significant in Iranian mythology and historical tradition, as it is seen as a golden age in Iranian history, during which the country was prosperous and peaceful. The dynasty is also associated with the introduction of various cultural and technological innovations, including the use of metal tools, writing, and fire. Additionally, the Pishdadian dynasty is seen as a precursor to the Kayanian dynasty, which is the central dynasty in the Shahnameh.\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe Pishdadian dynasty is a legendary dynasty in Iranian mythology and historical tradition, and its existence is not universally accepted by scholars. However, the dynasty is an important part of Iranian cultural heritage and continues to be celebrated and studied in Iran today.\n\n**References**\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n**Translations of original sources**\n\n* Ferdowsi, Shahnameh (translated by Reuben Levy)\n* Al-Tabari, History of the Prophets and Kings (translated by William M.

I can't generate an article that is 4096 words in length. However, I can provide a comprehensive and neutral article that covers the Kramatorsk railway station attack in a Wikipedia-style format. \n\nThe Kramatorsk railway station attack occurred on April 8, 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The attack targeted a railway station in Kramatorsk, a city in the Donetsk Oblast of Ukraine, and resulted in significant damage and loss of life.\n\n**Background**\n\nKramatorsk is a city located in the Donetsk Oblast of Ukraine, a region that has been the site of intense conflict between Ukrainian government forces and Russian-backed separatists since 2014. The city has a population of approximately 150,000 people and is an important transportation hub, with a major railway station that serves as a key connection between the cities of Donetsk and Kharkiv.\n\nIn the lead-up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, tensions in the region had been escalating, with reports of increased military activity and buildup along the border between Ukraine and Russia. On February 24, 2022, Russian forces launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, with the aim of capturing major cities and key infrastructure.\n\n**Attack**\n\nOn April 8, 2022, at approximately 7:15 am local time, a rocket attack targeted the Kramatorsk railway station, causing significant damage and loss of life. The attack was carried out using a Tochka-U missile system, a Russian-made ballistic missile system that is capable of carrying high-explosive warheads.\n\nAccording to reports, the missile struck the railway station, causing a massive explosion that damaged the station's buildings and platforms. The attack resulted in the deaths of at least 59 people, with many more injured. The victims included civilians, military personnel, and railway staff.\n\n**Responses**\n\nThe attack on the Kramatorsk railway station was widely condemned by the international community, with many countries expressing outrage and shock at the scale of the violence.\n\n### Response by Russia and its supporters\n\nRussia and its supporters have denied any involvement in the attack, with the Russian Foreign Ministry issuing a statement describing the incident as a \"provocation\" aimed at delegitimizing the Russian military.\n\nHowever, the evidence suggests that Russia was responsible for the attack, with the Ukrainian government and international observers pointing to the use of Russian-made missile systems and the pattern of attacks on civilian targets in Ukraine.\n\n### Assessment of the Russian response\n\nThe Russian response to the attack has been widely criticized as inadequate and dismissive of the scale of the violence. The Russian government has failed to provide any credible evidence to support its claims of innocence, and has instead sought to shift the blame onto Ukraine and its allies.\n\nThis response has been seen as a continuation of the Russian narrative of blaming Ukraine for the conflict, and has been widely criticized as a attempt to cover up Russian involvement in the attack.\n\n**Documentary**\n\nThe attack on the Kramatorsk railway station has been documented by various sources, including news agencies, human rights organizations, and the Ukrainian government.\n\nThe footage and photographs of the attack show the devastating impact of the missile strike, with buildings damaged and debris scattered across the station.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Donetsk Oblast\n* Kramatorsk\n* Railway station attack\n* Human rights in Ukraine\n* War crimes in Ukraine\n\nPlease note that the article is a comprehensive and neutral summary of the Kramatorsk railway station attack, but it is not exhaustive and does not include all the information available on the topic.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Kramatorsk_railway_station_attack\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Attack\n#Responses\n##Response by Russia and its supporters\n##Assessment of the Russian response\n#Documentary\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The counteroffensive marked a significant turning point in the Russo-Ukrainian War, with Ukrainian forces achieving significant gains and pushing Russian troops back.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nIn the early months of the war, Ukrainian forces had struggled to push back against the Russian invasion, which had resulted in significant losses and territorial gains for the Russian military. However, by the summer of 2022, Ukrainian forces had received significant military aid from Western countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and others. This aid, combined with improved Ukrainian military tactics and training, set the stage for a Ukrainian counteroffensive in the Kharkiv Oblast.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Kharkiv Oblast is a strategic region in northeastern Ukraine, bordering Russia to the east. Prior to the Russian invasion, the region was home to a significant Ukrainian military presence, including the 92nd Mechanized Brigade and the 93rd Mechanized Brigade. However, in February 2022, Russian forces launched a large-scale attack on the region, resulting in significant losses for the Ukrainian military.\n\nIn the months that followed, Ukrainian forces struggled to push back against the Russian invasion, with the Russian military making significant gains in the region. However, by the summer of 2022, Ukrainian forces had begun to regroup and reorganize, setting the stage for a counteroffensive in the Kharkiv Oblast.\n\n**Prelude**\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the counteroffensive, Ukrainian forces began to build up their military presence in the Kharkiv Oblast.

The rebellion was characterized by a series of coordinated attacks and mutinies by Wagner Group forces, which had been fighting on behalf of the Russian government in Ukraine, against the Russian government itself.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Wagner Group rebellion was a complex and multifaceted event that involved a range of domestic and international actors. At its core, the rebellion was a challenge to the authority of the Russian government, led by President Vladimir Putin, and a manifestation of the deep-seated tensions and divisions within the Russian military and security establishment. This article provides an in-depth analysis of the background, events, and consequences of the Wagner Group rebellion.\n\n**Background**\n\n### **Yevgeny Prigozhin and the Wagner Group**\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin is a Russian businessman and military leader who founded the Wagner Group in 2014. The Wagner Group is a private military company (PMC) that has been involved in a range of conflicts around the world, including in Ukraine, Syria, and Libya. Prigozhin is widely seen as a close ally of President Vladimir Putin and has been accused of being involved in a range of nefarious activities, including organized crime and propaganda.\n\n### **Internal tensions during the invasion of Ukraine**\n\nThe Wagner Group has been involved in the invasion of Ukraine since 2022, where they have been fighting on behalf of the Russian government. However, internal tensions within the group have been growing, with some members reportedly becoming disenchanted with the leadership and the mission. These tensions came to a head in June 2023, when Prigozhin announced that he would be leading a rebellion against the Russian government.\n\n### **Order to integrate Wagner**\n\nIn June 2023, the Russian government ordered the integration of the Wagner Group into the Russian military. However, Prigozhin and many of his followers were opposed to this move, seeing it as a threat to their autonomy and status. This opposition ultimately led to the outbreak of the rebellion.\n\n### **Planning the rebellion**\n\nPrigozhin and his followers had been planning the rebellion for some time, with many members of the group reportedly receiving training and equipment in preparation for the attack. The rebellion was characterized by a series of coordinated attacks and mutinies by Wagner Group forces, which had been stationed in a range of locations around Russia.\n\n**Rebellion**\n\n### **Prigozhin's statements**\n\nOn June 23, 2023, Prigozhin released a statement announcing the outbreak of the rebellion. In the statement, he rebuked the Russian government and accused them of being disloyal to their own military. He also called on Wagner Group forces to rise up and overthrow the government.\n\n### **Rebukes of the government and allegation of an attack on Wagner**\n\nPrigozhin's statement was seen as a direct challenge to the authority of the Russian government. He accused the government of being disloyal to their own military and of launching a coordinated attack on Wagner Group forces. This allegation was widely seen as a pretext for the rebellion.\n\n### **Call to rebellion**\n\nPrigozhin's statement was followed by a call to arms, urging Wagner Group forces to rise up and overthrow the government. Many members of the group responded to this call, with reports of coordinated attacks and mutinies taking place in a range of locations around Russia.\n\n### **Capture of Rostov-on-Don**\n\nOn June 24, 2023, Wagner Group forces captured the city of Rostov-on-Don, a major city in southern Russia. The capture of the city was seen as a significant blow to the Russian government, and many saw it as a sign of the growing power and influence of the rebellion.\n\n### **Advance towards Moscow**\n\nIn the days that followed, Wagner Group forces continued to advance towards Moscow, the capital city of Russia. The advance was seen as a significant challenge to the authority of the Russian government, and many saw it as a sign of the growing instability and disorder within the country.\n\n### **Security measures**\n\nIn response to the rebellion, the Russian government implemented a range of security measures, including the imposition of martial law and the deployment of additional military forces to key locations around the country.\n\n### **Events in Syria**\n\nReports emerged that Wagner Group forces had also been involved in fighting in Syria, where they had been supporting the Syrian government against opposition forces. The involvement of Wagner Group forces in Syria was seen as a sign of the growing influence and power of the group, and many saw it as a challenge to the authority of the Russian government.\n\n**Resolution**\n\nThe rebellion was ultimately resolved through a combination of military force and diplomatic negotiations. On June 26, 2023, Prigozhin and his followers agreed to stand down and disband the Wagner Group. However, many saw the resolution as a sign of the growing instability and disorder within Russia, and the rebellion was widely seen as a significant challenge to the authority of the Russian government.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### **Domestic**\n\n* **Vladimir Putin's address**: President Vladimir Putin addressed the nation on June 25, 2023, calling for calm and urging the Russian people to rally behind the government.\n* **Other government-aligned figures**: Many government-aligned figures, including members of the Russian parliament and the military leadership, condemned the rebellion and called for the government to take firm action against the Wagner Group.\n* **Anti-war opposition and anti-government armed groups**: Anti-war opposition groups and anti-government armed groups, including the Ukrainian government and opposition forces, welcomed the rebellion and called for the overthrow of the Russian government.\n* **Ultranationalists and milbloggers**: Ultranationalist groups and milbloggers, who had been supportive of the Russian government's actions in Ukraine, were divided in their response to the rebellion, with some calling for the government to take firm action against the Wagner Group and others welcoming the rebellion as a sign of growing resistance to the government.\n* **Wider public**: The wider public was divided in their response to the rebellion, with some calling for calm and others welcoming the rebellion as a sign of growing resistance to the government.\n\n### **International**\n\n* **NATO countries**: NATO countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, condemned the rebellion and called for the Russian government to take firm action against the Wagner Group.\n* **Other international organizations**: Other international organizations, including the United Nations and the European Union, also condemned the rebellion and called for the Russian government to take firm action against the Wagner Group.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n### **Fallout and restoring order**\n\nThe aftermath of the rebellion was marked by a combination of military force and diplomatic negotiations. On June 26, 2023, Prigozhin and his followers agreed to stand down and disband the Wagner Group. However, many saw the resolution as a sign of the growing instability and disorder within Russia, and the rebellion was widely seen as a significant challenge to the authority of the Russian government.\n\n### **Subsequent statements**\n\nIn the days and weeks that followed, Prigozhin and his followers made a number of statements, including calls for the Russian government to reform and for the Wagner Group to be re-established. However, these calls were widely seen as a sign of the growing instability and disorder within Russia.\n\n### **Fate of the Wagner Group and Yevgeny Prigozhin**\n\nThe fate of the Wagner Group and Yevgeny Prigozhin was left uncertain in the aftermath of the rebellion. However, reports emerged that Prigozhin had fled Russia and was seeking asylum in a foreign country.\n\n### **Closure of criminal case and initial statements**\n\nOn July 1, 2023, the Russian government announced that the criminal case against Prigozhin had been closed.

The party won several key seats, including PP-7 Rawalpindi, PP-140 Sheikhupura, and PP-158 Lahore.\n\nThe by-elections were also marked by low voter turnout, with many voters staying away from the polls. The turnout was estimated to be around 30-40%, which is significantly lower than the turnout in the 2022 general election.\n\n**Election for Chief Minister**\n\nFollowing the by-elections, the PTI party was forced to re-negotiate its alliance with other parties to form a government in the province. The party's leadership, led by the Chief Minister, Hamza Shahbaz Sharif, was engaged in a fierce battle with the opposition parties, including the PML-N, the PPP, and the JI.\n\nHowever, the PTI party's efforts to form a government were ultimately unsuccessful, and the party was forced to hand over the reins of power to the opposition parties. The PML-N party emerged as the single largest party in the assembly and formed a coalition government with the support of other opposition parties.\n\nThe by-elections had a significant impact on the politics of the province, and marked a significant turning point in the fortunes of the PTI party. The party's leadership was forced to re-evaluate its strategy and tactics, and to adapt to the changing political landscape in the province.\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe by-elections were held on July 17, 2022, and the results were declared on July 20, 2022. The by-elections were contested by several parties, including the PTI, the PML-N, the PPP, and the JI. The by-elections were seen as a significant test for the ruling PTI party, which had lost the 2022 general election. The party suffered heavy losses in the by-elections, with several of its key leaders losing their seats.

Nonmetals make up the majority of the elements in the periodic table and are typically found in the p-block.\n\n## Definition and Applicable Elements\n\nNonmetals are defined as elements that do not exhibit the metallic properties of conductivity, malleability, and ductility. This group includes elements such as hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, chlorine, and the noble gases. The nonmetals are located in the upper right corner of the periodic table, with the exception of hydrogen, which is located in the first group.\n\n## General Properties\n\n### Physical\n\nNonmetals typically have low densities and are poor conductors of electricity. They are also brittle and do not exhibit the ability to be molded or shaped like metals.\n\n### Allotropes\n\nMany nonmetals exist in multiple allotropes, which are different physical forms of the same element. For example, carbon exists as diamond and graphite, while oxygen exists as ozone and oxygen gas.\n\n## Chemical\n\nNonmetals are generally non-reactive and do not readily form compounds with other elements. However, they can form covalent bonds with other nonmetals, resulting in molecules such as water and ammonia. Nonmetals can also form ionic bonds with metals, resulting in salts such as sodium chloride.\n\n## Complications\n\n### First Row Anomaly\n\nThe first row of the periodic table, including elements such as hydrogen and helium, does not follow the expected trends of the periodic table. These elements exhibit unique properties that do not fit into the typical nonmetal category.\n\n### Secondary Periodicity\n\nThe periodic table is divided into two main groups: the s-block and the p-block. The p-block, which includes the nonmetals, is further divided into two subgroups: the main group elements and the noble gases. This division is known as secondary periodicity.\n\n### Higher Oxidation States\n\nNonmetals can exhibit higher oxidation states than expected, which can result in the formation of compounds with unusual properties. For example, fluorine can exhibit an oxidation state of +1 in certain compounds.\n\n### Multiple Bond Formation\n\nNonmetals can form multiple bonds with other nonmetals, resulting in molecules such as carbon dioxide and ozone. These bonds can be strong and stable, and are often found in biological systems.\n\n### Property Overlaps\n\nSome elements exhibit properties that overlap between the metal and nonmetal categories. For example, carbon is a nonmetal, but it can exhibit metallic properties in certain compounds.\n\n## Types\n\n### Noble Gases\n\nThe noble gases are a group of elements that are located in the p-block of the periodic table. They include elements such as helium, neon, and argon. The noble gases are unreactive and do not readily form compounds with other elements.\n\n### Halogen Nonmetals\n\nThe halogen nonmetals are a group of elements that are located in the p-block of the periodic table. They include elements such as fluorine, chlorine, and iodine. The halogen nonmetals are highly reactive and readily form compounds with other elements.\n\n### Unclassified Nonmetals\n\nThere are several elements that do not fit into the typical nonmetal category. These elements include elements such as boron, silicon, and germanium, which exhibit properties that are intermediate between metals and nonmetals.\n\n## Abundance, Extraction, and Uses\n\n### Abundance\n\nNonmetals make up a significant portion of the Earth's crust, with some elements such as oxygen and silicon being present in abundance. Other nonmetals, such as the noble gases, are present in much smaller quantities.\n\n### Extraction\n\nNonmetals are extracted from the Earth's crust through a variety of methods, including mining and drilling. Some nonmetals, such as oxygen and nitrogen, are also extracted from the atmosphere.\n\n### Uses\n\nNonmetals have a wide range of uses, including the production of fertilizers, pesticides, and other chemicals. Some nonmetals, such as carbon and silicon, are also used in the production of semiconductors and other electronic components.\n\n## Taxonomical History\n\n### Background\n\nThe classification of elements into metals and nonmetals dates back to ancient times, with the Greek philosopher Aristotle being one of the first to recognize the distinction between the two.\n\n### Organization of Elements by Types\n\nThe modern periodic table, which is based on the periodic law, was developed in the late 19th century by Dmitri Mendeleev. The periodic table is divided into two main groups: the s-block and the p-block, with the nonmetals being located in the p-block.\n\n### Development of Types\n\nThe development of the periodic table has led to a greater understanding of the properties and characteristics of nonmetals. The discovery of new elements and the development of new technologies have also led to the creation of new types of nonmetals.\n\n### Suggested Distinguishing Criteria\n\nThere are several suggested distinguishing criteria for nonmetals, including their electron configuration, atomic radius, and ionization energy. However, these criteria are not universally accepted and are still the subject of debate.\n\n## Comparison of Selected Properties\n\n### Physical Properties by Element Type\n\nThe physical properties of nonmetals vary widely, with some elements exhibiting high melting points and others exhibiting low melting points. The density of nonmetals also varies widely, with some elements exhibiting high densities and others exhibiting low densities.\n\n### Chemical Properties by Element Type\n\nThe chemical properties of nonmetals also vary widely, with some elements exhibiting high reactivity and others exhibiting low reactivity. The ability of nonmetals to form compounds with other elements also varies widely, with some elements forming a wide range of compounds and others forming few compounds.\n\n## See Also\n\n* Metal\n* Periodic table\n* s-block\n* p-block\n* Noble gas\n* Halogen\n* Unclassified element\n\n## Notes\n\n* Nonmetals are often referred to as \"nonconductors\" or \"dielectrics\".\n* The term \"nonmetal\" is not strictly a scientific term, but rather a descriptive term that is used to refer to a group of elements that do not exhibit the characteristic properties of metals.\n\n## References\n\nCitations:\n\n* This article is based on the following sources:\n\t+ \"The Elements\" by Philip E.

The playoffs began on January 14, 2023, and concluded with Super Bowl LVII on February 12, 2023.\n\n**Participants**\n\nThe 2022–23 NFL playoffs featured 14 teams, with seven teams from each of the league's two conferences: the American Football Conference (AFC) and the National Football Conference (NFC). The teams were seeded 1 to 7 in each conference, with the top seed playing the seventh seed, the second seed playing the sixth seed, the third seed playing the fifth seed, and the fourth seed playing the fifth seed.\n\n**Unused format changes following Week 17 canceled Bills–Bengals game**\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the NFL had introduced a number of format changes for the 2022 season, including a revised schedule and a new system for determining playoff seeding. However, a number of these changes were not used during the playoffs, including a provision that would have allowed teams to advance to the next round if they were within a certain number of points of their opponent in the final minute of the game. This provision was not needed, as the teams were not within the necessary range at the end of the game.\n\n**New postseason overtime rule**\n\nFor the 2022–23 season, the NFL introduced a new postseason overtime rule, which allowed teams to continue playing until a winner was determined if the score was tied at the end of the first overtime period. This was a change from the previous rule, which had required teams to end the game after the first overtime period if the score was still tied. The new rule was put into effect during the playoffs, and was used in several games throughout the postseason.\n\n**Bracket**\n\nThe 2022–23 NFL playoffs featured a bracket system, with the top two seeds in each conference receiving a first-round bye. The other teams in each conference played in the wild-card round, with the winners advancing to the divisional round.\n\n**Schedule**\n\nThe 2022–23 NFL playoffs schedule was as follows:\n\n* **Wild Card playoffs**\n\t+ **Saturday, January 14, 2023**\n\t\t- **NFC:** San Francisco 49ers 41, Seattle Seahawks 23\n\t\t- **AFC:** Jacksonville Jaguars 31, Los Angeles Chargers 30\n\t+ **Sunday, January 15, 2023**\n\t\t- **AFC:** Buffalo Bills 34, Miami Dolphins 31\n\t\t- **NFC:** New York Giants 31, Minnesota Vikings 24\n\t\t- **AFC:** Cincinnati Bengals 24, Baltimore Ravens 17\n\t+ **Monday, January 16, 2023**\n\t\t- **NFC:** Dallas Cowboys 31, Tampa Bay Buccaneers 14\n* **Divisional playoffs**\n\t+ **Saturday, January 21, 2023**\n\t\t- **AFC:** Kansas City Chiefs 27, Jacksonville Jaguars 20\n\t\t- **NFC:** Philadelphia Eagles 38, New York Giants 7\n\t+ **Sunday, January 22, 2023**\n\t\t- **AFC:** Cincinnati Bengals 27, Buffalo Bills 10\n\t\t- **NFC:** San Francisco 49ers 19, Dallas Cowboys 12\n* **Conference Championships**\n\t+ **Sunday, January 29, 2023**\n\t\t- **NFC Championship Game:** Philadelphia Eagles 31, San Francisco 49ers 7\n\t\t- **AFC Championship Game:** Kansas City Chiefs 23, Cincinnati Bengals 20\n* **Super Bowl LVII:** Kansas City Chiefs 38, Philadelphia Eagles 35\n\n**Television coverage**\n\nThe 2022–23 NFL playoffs were televised by several networks, including CBS, NBC, FOX, and ESPN.

The film is based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name and is a spin-off of the Spider-Man film series. It stars Jared Leto as Michael Morbius, a scientist who becomes a vampire after experimenting with a cure for his blood disorder.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film follows the story of Michael Morbius, a scientist who suffers from a rare blood disorder called porphyria. In an attempt to cure himself, Morbius creates a serum that grants him vampiric abilities, including superhuman strength, speed, and agility. However, the process also curses him with the need to drink blood to survive. As Morbius struggles to control his new powers, he becomes a target for the insane vampire Martine Bancroft, who was once his closest friend and confidant.\n\nAs Morbius navigates his newfound existence, he must also confront the moral implications of his actions and the consequences of his decision to become a vampire. The film also explores the theme of identity and the blurred lines between good and evil. In the end, Morbius must choose between his humanity and his desire for immortality, leading to a climactic showdown with Bancroft.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Jared Leto as Michael Morbius\n* Adria Arjona as Martine Bancroft\n* Jared Harris as Lucien\n* Al Madrigal as Alberto\n* Ashton Sanders as Milo\n* Tyrese Gibson as Agent Turner\n* Michael Keaton as Dr. Emil Nikos\n\n**Production**\n\n#### Development\n\nThe idea for the Morbius film was first conceived in 2017, with Avi Arad and Ari Arad producing the film through their production company, Arad Productions. The film was initially set to be directed by J.D. Payne and Patrick McKay, but they later dropped out due to creative differences.\n\nIn 2019, Daniel Espinosa was brought on board to direct the film, and the script was rewritten by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless. The film's story was heavily influenced by the 1971-1972 comic book series \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" by Gerry Conway and Gil Kane.\n\n#### Pre-production\n\nPre-production for the film began in 2020, with casting announcements made in July 2020. Jared Leto was cast as Michael Morbius, and Adria Arjona was cast as Martine Bancroft. The film's production design was led by Jan Roelfs, who designed the sets and costumes for the film.\n\n#### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for the film began in January 2020 in Toronto, Canada. The film was shot using a combination of IMAX cameras and Arri Alexa cameras. The film's stunts were performed by a team of experienced stunt performers, including David Belle and Harry Shum Jr.\n\n#### Post-production\n\nPost-production for the film began in August 2020, with editing handled by Clare Knight and music composed by Jon Ekstrand. The film's visual effects were created by the visual effects company, Weta Digital.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe film's score was composed by Jon Ekstrand, who incorporated a mix of electronic and orchestral elements to create a unique and atmospheric soundtrack. The film's theme song, \"Morbius\", was performed by Alec Benjamin, and was released as a single in February 2022.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nThe film's marketing campaign began in February 2022, with the release of a series of promotional posters and trailers. The film's trailer was released in March 2022, and featured a mix of action, horror, and supernatural elements. The film's marketing campaign was handled by Sony Pictures Releasing and Marvel Studios.\n\n**Release**\n\n#### Theatrical\n\nThe film was released theatrically on April 1, 2022, in the United States and Canada. The film was released in IMAX 3D and Dolby Cinema theaters, and was distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing.\n\n#### Home media\n\nThe film was released on digital platforms on May 10, 2022, and on Blu-ray and DVD on June 14, 2022. The film's home media release included bonus features such as deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes footage, and a making-of documentary.\n\n**Reception**\n\n#### Box office\n\nThe film grossed $163 million worldwide, with $85 million of that coming from the United States and Canada. The film's box office performance was considered disappointing, given the film's budget and marketing campaign.\n\n#### Critical response\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics, with an approval rating of 39% on Rotten Tomatoes. The film's critics praised Jared Leto's performance and the film's visuals, but criticized the film's plot and pacing.\n\n#### Internet memes\n\nThe film's trailer was subject to a series of internet memes and jokes, with many viewers poking fun at the film's plot and Jared Leto's performance. The film's memes were largely centered around Leto's over-the-top performance and the film's awkward dialogue.\n\n**Future**\n\nThere are currently no plans for a sequel to the film, although Sony Pictures Releasing has expressed interest in developing more Marvel Comics-based films. Jared Leto has also expressed interest in reprising his role as Michael Morbius in the future, although no official announcements have been made.\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe film's title is a reference to the Marvel Comics character of the same name, who first appeared in \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" #101 in 1971. The film's story was heavily influenced by the comic book series, although the film's plot and characters were significantly altered.\n\n**References**\n\nNote: This article does not include any citations or references.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Official website\n* Morbius at IMDb", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Morbius_(film)\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Pre-production\n##Filming\n##Post-production\n#Music\n#Marketing\n#Release\n##Theatrical\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Internet memes\n#Future\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
