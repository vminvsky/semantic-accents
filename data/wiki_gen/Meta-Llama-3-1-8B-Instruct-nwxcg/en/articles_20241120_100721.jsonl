They were building infrastructure to handle a slate of Disney+ animated series and looking to hire around 300 new staff for production roles [37] [39] [40] What If...? director Bryan Andrews said each additional animated series would exist on its own terms and explore different elements of the MCU [41] Head of streaming Brad Winderbaum said the studio would only tell stories that they felt needed to be told in animated form, [39] and Marvel Studios was open to working with corporate siblings Pixar Animation and Walt Disney Animation under the right circumstances [42] During Marvel Studios Animation's panel at the 2022 San Diego Comic-Con, the slate of animated series were described as the \"Marvel Animated Multiverse\" [43] Winderbaum said the MCU's Multiverse Saga and its exploration of the multiverse allowed the studio to look at alternate versions of MCU characters and this had become their \"guiding light\" for animated projects [44] This includes X-Men '97, a revival and continuation of the 1990s series X-Men: The Animated Series, which Winderbaum said has the potential to connect to the MCU through the multiverse [45]\n\n\nMarvel Television series\nThe first television series that Marvel Television developed to be part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe was Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.; it was ordered to pilot by ABC in August 2012 [2] [55] In January 2014, the series Agent Carter was announced; [3] it was canceled in May 2016 [56] That November, Marvel and IMAX Corporation announced Inhumans, based on the species of the same name, after a planned film starring the characters was removed from Marvel Studios' slate [57] [58] [59] ABC canceled the series in May 2018 [60] In July 2019, the seventh season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D was announced to be its last [61] Loeb explained a month later that Marvel categorized its ABC series as the \"Marvel Heroes\" series due to their close connections to the MCU films, especially with the main characters of both Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D and Agent Carter having originated in films [12]\n\n\nABC series\nThe first television series that Marvel Television developed to be part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe was Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.; it was ordered to pilot by ABC in August 2012 [2] [55] In January 2014, the series Agent Carter was announced; [3] it was canceled in May 2016 [56] That November, Marvel

Heroes\" series due to their close connections to the MCU films, especially with the main characters of both Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D and Agent Carter having originated in films [12]\n\n\nNetflix series\nBy October 2013, Marvel was preparing four drama series and a miniseries to present to video on demand services and cable providers, with Netflix, Amazon, and WGN America expressing interest [72] Disney announced the next month that it would provide Netflix with live-action series based on Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist, and Luke Cage, leading to a crossover miniseries based on the Defenders [73] In April 2016, Marvel and Netflix ordered The Punisher as a spin-off from Daredevil [71] Netflix had canceled all of the series by the end of February 2019; [74] the characters could not appear in any non-Netflix series or films for at least two years following the cancellations [75] Loeb said in August 2019 that Marvel Television categorized the Netflix series internally as the \"Marvel Street-Level Heroes\" or \"Marvel Knights\" [12] All series were no longer available on Netflix starting March 1, 2022, due to Netflix's license for the series ending and Disney regaining the rights [76] They all began streaming on Disney+ from March 16, 2022, where they were collected under the title \"The Defenders Saga\" [77]\n\n\nYoung adult series\nAt San Diego Comic-Con 2011, Loeb announced a series based on the Marvel Comics characters Cloak and Dagger was in development; [80] Freeform ordered the project to series in April 2016 [81] That August, Hulu ordered a new series based on the comics group the Runaways [78] [82] Marvel initially said there were no plans to crossover these series, [83] but Cloak and Dagger were announced to be appearing in the third season of Runaways in August 2019 [84] Loeb explained that Marvel categorized Runaways and Cloak & Dagger as its \"YA\", or \"young adult\", franchise, and said Marvel Television's push into the young adult genre was in response to Marvel Studios doing the same with Spider-Man Loeb hoped there would be further crossovers between the two series, [12] but Cloak and Dagger was canceled in October 2019, [85] followed by Runaways that November [86]\n\n\nAdventure into Fear\nHulu ordered two series based on Ghost Rider and the siblings Daimon and Ana Helstrom in May 2019, intending to build an interconnected universe in a similar fashion to Marvel's Netflix shows [88] Marvel announced the series as the cornerstone of the \"Spirits of Vengeance\", and Loeb said they were moving into a new, \"chilling\" corner of the Marvel Universe [89] Loeb revealed in August that Marvel was now referring to these series collectively as \"Adventure into Fear\", and said more series under the banner were in development [12] A month later, Hulu decided not to move forward with Ghost Rider due to creative differences [90] When Marvel Television was folded into Marvel Studios in December, the studio said production on Helstrom would be completed but no further series would be developed [20] Upon Helstrom's release in October 2020, showrunner Paul Zbyszewski said the series was \"our own separate thing\" and not part of the MCU, [91] [92] having been \"siloed off\" in part because of its darker themes [93] Zbyszewski called it \"freeing\" to not be part of the MCU [91] He also said there were Easter eggs in the series that hinted towards the planned Adventure into Fear universe [92] Unlike Marvel Television's other series, each episode of Helstrom does not begin with the Marvel logo [94] The series was canceled in December 2020 [95]\n\n\nCrossovers to feature films\nAfter  [running something by Jeph] Loeb we'll run it through New York, Joe Quesada, Dan Buckley, and those guys  [Then we] pitch our stuff to Kevin Feige and his movie group to see if there's something we can tie into, to see if they're okay about us using a character, or a weapon or some other cool thing Everything is interconnected.\n\n\nUnder Marvel Television\nAfter  [running something by Jeph] Loeb we'll run it through New York, Joe Quesada, Dan Buckley, and those guys  [Then we] pitch our stuff to Kevin Feige and his movie group to see if there's something we can tie into, to see if they're okay about us using a character, or a weapon or some other cool thing Everything is interconnected.\n\n\nUnder Marvel Studios\nIn March 2021, the Darkhold appeared in WandaVision with a different design from the one seen in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D and Runaways While WandaVision's head writer, Jac Schaeffer, said there were no \"big conversations\" among the writers regarding its appearance in the Marvel Television series, [114] [115] director Matt Shakman said that he believed it was the same one seen in those series despite the new design [116] The new Darkhold was designed by the Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022) props team, since it appears and has more screentime in that film [117] [118] The film also showed that multiple copies of the Darkhold exist [119]\n\n\nMarvel Studios series\nAll Marvel Studios series are being released on Disney+ unless otherwise noted and exist alongside the films of their respective phase [135] Animated series are produced by Marvel Studios Animation [38] Beginning with Agatha All Along, live-action series are released under Marvel Studios'

company Proximity Media [27] [192] By that May, Danai Gurira had signed a deal to reprise her role as Okoye, the head of the Dora Milaje, in the series, which was said to be an origin spin-off for the

projects in development, [196] [197] later confirming the untitled series was the Nova project [198] Marvel Studios was taking a slower developmental timeline for the series by February 2023 amid Disney's larger decision to scale back content output and costs [31] In July 2024, Feige said the series would feature Rider and anticipated that it would be released three or four years later [186]\n\n\nDaredevil: Born Again season 2\nThe first season of Daredevil: Born Again is scheduled to premiere in March 2025 [171] Daredevil: Born Again was announced at the 2022 San Diego Comic-Con in July as having an 18 episode first season [199] Ahead of filming restarting in January 2024 following the series creative overhaul, Born Again was reported to have a lower episode count than the 18 episodes originally announced, [200] though it was also reported to be \"one big 18-episode limited series\" with nine-episode halves that were not being called seasons for contractual reasons [201] Nine episodes were ultimately filmed, [202] which Feige referred to as a first season in August 2024 [203] [188] Filming on the second season is expected to begin in 2025 [204]\n\n\nOther\nA second

America: Brave New World (2025) [206] [207]\n\n\nSeries approach\nFeige described Marvel Studios' approach to their television series in January 2021, explaining that streaming on Disney+ gave Marvel Studios flexibility with the formats for each series He said some were being developed as one-off miniseries that were intended to lead into feature films, [208] [209] though additional seasons could be added to these in the future [210] Other series were always intended to cover multiple seasons while still being connected to the films, [208] such as Loki [211] These could have several years between the release of seasons, similar to series like Game of Thrones and Stranger Things [208] Feige added that each miniseries or season was intended to be around six hours of content, but this would be split in different ways depending on the story being told, such as six hour-long episodes, or nine or ten half-hour episodes [212] [213] Marvel Studios intended to make each of their series an event [214] [215] Many of the first series from the studio were approached with a feature film structure that gave the characters an arc across the series and felt like standalone limited series [216] Marvel Studios' earliest series were directed by a single person, but later series have multiple directors taking on different numbers of episodes Feige said this happened due to a combination of logistics, the needs of each story, and the studio's \"own internal learnings of making longform television\" He said the studio would continue varying the number of directors on future series as needed [209] Following the release of the Phase Four series, Feige said Marvel Studios was open to experimenting with more episodic series rather than each series always having a larger story; he pointed to Daredevil: Born Again as a particular example where they would try this [32]\n\n\nInitial approach (2021–late 2023)\nFeige described Marvel Studios' approach to their television series in January 2021, explaining that streaming on Disney+ gave Marvel Studios flexibility with the formats for each series He said some were being developed as one-off miniseries that were intended to lead into feature films, [208] [209] though additional seasons could be added to these in the future [210] Other series were always intended to cover multiple seasons while still being connected to the

series rather than each series always having a larger story; he pointed to Daredevil: Born Again as a particular example where they would try this [32]\n\n\nOverhaul of television operations (late 2023–present)\nBy October 2023, Marvel Studios was planning to change their approach to television, moving away from their head writer model and instead hiring showrunners for their series The showrunners would develop television pilots and create series bibles to have a creative throughline throughout the entire production process The studio began to come around to this idea after Gao returned to aid She-Hulk: Attorney at Law in post-production, [151] and after the critical and commercial failure of Secret Invasion [223] Winderbaum said the studio was trying to \"marry the Marvel culture with the traditional television culture\", [151] and he felt this would help separate their streaming content from their theatrical films [216] The studio planned to hire dedicated executives to focus on television, and to create more multi-season series so audiences could form relationships with characters rather than the series just being set up for big crossover events [151] These changes allowed the studio to develop more content than they would actually produce, in line with how a \"traditional\" studio works, [224] and would only move forward with future series when they were confident in its pilot and bible [225] Winderbaum said they had started this development approach in 2022 [50] Sam Barsanti from The A.V Club discussed this philosophy change, saying it could be that Marvel Studios was \"recognizing its faults and acknowledging that its attempt to turn its Disney+ shows into stretched-out movies was a failure\", and he felt it was good for the studio to rethink its approach following recent failures, but he also noted that WandaVision and She-Hulk: Attorney at Law had fit the television formula well so it was possible to have that kind of success under the previous approach [226] /Film's Ben Pearson called the previous approach \"seriously flawed\" and said \"tried-and-true methodologies work for a reason\"; Pearson was hopeful that other Hollywood studios would not try to replicate Marvel's initial approach [227] Agatha All Along was the first series to alter the credits of its head writer, Schaeffer, to showrunner [161] [152] Vision Quest, which was announced in May 2024, was the studio's first live-action series pickup in nearly two years and the first to move forward under the studio's new development approach [154] By October 2024, the studio had adopted a budget-conscious approach to producing their series Agatha All Along was confirmed to be the studio's least expensive series to date, with a similar approach expected for future series such as  Daredevil: Born Again and Vision Quest [228]\n\n\nRelease schedule\nThe second season of What If...? (2023) was the first Marvel Studios series to be released daily, [229] while Echo (2024) was the first series released all at once; all previous Marvel Studios series had weekly releases [230] [215] The first two series were released on Fridays, followed by the majority of series since the first season of Loki being released on Wednesdays; She-Hulk: Attorney at Law was released on Thursdays The second season of Loki and Echo were released in prime time in the United States, with the former on Thursday evenings and the latter on a Tuesday evening [231]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series**\n\nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is a media franchise created by Marvel Studios that has expanded to include television series in addition to the film franchise. The television series have been produced by Marvel Studios, with some being developed in collaboration with other studios.\n\n**Development**\n\nIn June 2010, Marvel Television was launched with Jeph Loeb as head. The studio began producing television series inspired by the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film franchise, and was made aware of Marvel Studios' plans to avoid interfering when introducing someone or something to the universe. In August 2015, Marvel Studios was integrated into Walt Disney Studios with President Kevin Feige reporting to Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan F Horn instead of Marvel Entertainment CEO Isaac Perlmutter, while Marvel Television remained under Perlmutter's control. This was seen as widening the existing divide between the Marvel film and television divisions, and making it unlikely that the films would acknowledge the series' events and characters. By that point, the only series that had significant involvement from Marvel Studios was Agent Carter.\n\n**Transition to Marvel Studios**\n\nBy September 2018, Marvel Studios was developing several limited series for Disney's new streaming service Disney+, to be centered on \"second tier\" characters from the MCU films who had not and were unlikely to star in their own films. The actors who portrayed the characters in the films were expected to reprise their roles for the series. Feige was taking a \"hands-on role\" in each series' development, focusing on \"continuity of story\" with the films and \"handling\" the returning actors. The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special (2022), a television special, was the first project Marvel Studios began planning for Disney+. Loeb said Marvel Television would continue to develop new MCU series, including their own Disney+ series. In March 2019, Feige said the Marvel Studios series would take characters from the films, change them, and see those changes reflected in future films; new characters introduced in the series could also go on to appear in films. By September 2019, many of Marvel Television's existing series were canceled or ending, and several developing projects did not move forward. Variety reported that Marvel Television was likely being phased out in favor of the new Marvel Studios series, which had access to well-known MCU characters and had reported budgets of $100–150 million each, much larger than those of the Marvel Television series.\n\n**Animation and other banners**\n\nIn June 2021, Marvel Studios executive Victoria Alonso said the studio's expansion to animation with the series What If...? was an opportunity to make the MCU more diverse, and the medium of animation allowed Marvel Studios to work with new companies around the world. Marvel Studios was creating an animation division, eventually named Marvel Studios Animation, to focus on animated content beyond What If...?. They were building infrastructure to handle a slate of Disney+ animated series and looking to hire around 300 new staff for production roles. What If...? director Bryan Andrews said each additional animated series would exist on its own terms and explore different elements of the MCU. Head of streaming Brad Winderbaum said the studio would only tell stories that they felt needed to be told in animated form, and Marvel Studios was open to working with corporate siblings Pixar Animation and Walt Disney Animation under the right circumstances. During Marvel Studios Animation's panel at the 2022 San Diego Comic-Con, the slate of animated series were described as the \"Marvel Animated Multiverse\". Winderbaum said the MCU's Multiverse Saga and its exploration of the multiverse allowed the studio to look at alternate versions of MCU characters and this had become their \"guiding light\" for animated projects. This includes X-Men '97, a revival and continuation of the 1990s series X-Men: The Animated Series, which Winderbaum said has the potential to connect to the MCU through the multiverse.\n\n**Marvel Television series**\n\nThe first television series that Marvel Television developed to be part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe was Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.; it was ordered to pilot by ABC in August 2012. In January 2014, the series Agent Carter was announced; it was canceled in May 2016. That November, Marvel and IMAX Corporation announced Inhumans, based on the species of the same name, after a planned film starring the characters was removed from Marvel Studios' slate. ABC canceled the series in May 2018. In July 2019, the seventh season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D was announced to be its last. Loeb explained a month later that Marvel categorized its ABC series as the \"Marvel Heroes\" series due to their close connections to the MCU films, especially with the main characters of both Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D and Agent Carter having originated in films.\n\n**Netflix series**\n\nBy October 2013, Marvel was preparing four drama series and a miniseries to present to video on demand services and cable providers, with Netflix, Amazon, and WGN America expressing interest.

Two Marvel Studios Special Presentation television specials are also included in Phase Four.\n\n**Phase Four**\n\nMarvel Studios has announced several series as part of Phase Four, including Loki, Hawkeye, Moon Knight, Ms. Marvel, and She-Hulk. Phase Four also includes the Disney+ series What If...?, which explores alternate storylines from the MCU. The series are being released on Disney+ and will conclude with the television special Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.\n\n**Phase Five**\n\nAt any given time, Marvel Studios has future television series planned five-to-six years out from what they have announced. By December 2020, after announcing series through the end of 2022, future series were planned through 2028. By February 2023, Marvel Studios was taking a slower developmental timeline for future series, such as the planned Nova series, amid Disney's larger decision to scale back content output and costs. By July 2024, Marvel Studios had ideas for their projects through 2029 though Feige noted that these could change as needed.\n\n**Untitled Wakanda series**\n\nIn February 2021, a drama series set in Wakanda was revealed to be in development from Ryan Coogler, writer and director of Black Panther (2018) and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022), through his company Proximity Media.

Production Weekly had previously included an untitled space-centered series in their report of upcoming projects in development, later confirming the untitled series was the Nova project.\n\n**Daredevil: Born Again season 2**\n\nThe first season of Daredevil: Born Again is scheduled to premiere in March 2025. Daredevil: Born Again was announced at the 2022 San Diego Comic-Con in July as having an 18 episode first season. Ahead of filming restarting in January 2024 following the series creative overhaul, Born Again was reported to have a lower episode count than the 18 episodes originally announced, though it was also reported to be \"one big 18-episode limited series\" with nine-episode halves that were not being called seasons for contractual reasons. Nine episodes were ultimately filmed, which Feige referred to as a first season in August 2024.\n\n**Other**\n\nA second season of Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man is in development, which was originally announced as Spider-Man: Sophomore Year. By November 2022, Coogler's Proximity Media was revealed to be developing several series set in Wakanda.

They were building infrastructure to handle a slate of Disney+ animated series and looking to hire around 300 new staff for production roles [37] [39] [40] What If...? director Bryan Andrews said each additional animated series would exist on its own terms and explore different elements of the MCU [41] Head of streaming Brad Winderbaum said the studio would only tell stories that they felt needed to be told in animated form, [39] and Marvel Studios was open to working with corporate siblings Pixar Animation and Walt Disney Animation under the right circumstances [42] During Marvel Studios Animation's panel at the 2022 San Diego Comic-Con, the slate of animated series were described as the \"Marvel Animated Multiverse\" [43] Winderbaum said the MCU's Multiverse Saga and its exploration of the multiverse allowed the studio to look at alternate versions of MCU characters and this had become their \"guiding light\" for animated projects [44] This includes X-Men '97, a revival and continuation of the 1990s series X-Men: The Animated Series, which Winderbaum said has the potential to connect to the MCU through the multiverse [45]\n\n\nMarvel Television series\nThe first television series that Marvel Television developed to be part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe was Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.; it was ordered to pilot by ABC in August 2012 [2] [55] In January 2014, the series Agent Carter was announced; [3] it was canceled in May 2016 [56] That November, Marvel and IMAX Corporation announced Inhumans, based on the species of the same name, after a planned film starring the characters was removed from Marvel Studios' slate [57] [58] [59] ABC canceled the series in May 2018 [60] In July 2019, the seventh season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D was announced to be its last [61] Loeb explained a month later that Marvel categorized its ABC series as the \"Marvel Heroes\" series due to their close connections to the MCU films, especially with the main characters of both Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D and Agent Carter having originated in films [12]\n\n\nABC series\nThe first television series that Marvel Television developed to be part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe

Heroes\" series due to their close connections to the MCU films, especially with the main characters of both Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D and Agent Carter having originated in films [12]\n\n\nNetflix series\nBy October 2013, Marvel was preparing four drama series and a miniseries to present to video on demand services and cable providers, with Netflix, Amazon, and WGN America expressing interest [72] Disney announced the next month that it would provide Netflix with live-action series based on Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist, and Luke Cage, leading to a crossover miniseries based on the Defenders [73] In April 2016, Marvel and Netflix ordered The Punisher as a spin-off from Daredevil [71] Netflix had canceled all of the series by the end of February 2019; [74] the characters could not appear in any non-Netflix series or films for at least two years following the cancellations [75] Loeb said in August 2019 that Marvel Television categorized the Netflix series internally as the \"Marvel Street-Level Heroes\" or \"Marvel Knights\" [12] All series were no longer available on Netflix starting March 1, 2022, due to Netflix's license for the series ending and Disney regaining the rights [76] They all began streaming on Disney+ from March 16, 2022, where they were collected under the title \"The Defenders Saga\" [77]\n\n\nYoung adult series\nAt San Diego Comic-Con 2011, Loeb announced a series based on the Marvel Comics characters Cloak and Dagger was in development; [80] Freeform ordered the project to series in April 2016 [81] That August, Hulu ordered a new series based on the comics group the Runaways [78] [82] Marvel initially said there were no plans to crossover these series, [83] but Cloak and Dagger were announced to be appearing in the third season of Runaways in August 2019 [84] Loeb explained that Marvel categorized Runaways and Cloak & Dagger as its \"YA\", or \"young adult\", franchise, and said Marvel Television's push into the young adult genre was in response to Marvel Studios doing the same with Spider-Man Loeb hoped there would be further crossovers between the two series, [12] but Cloak and Dagger was canceled in October 2019, [85] followed by Runaways that November [86]\n\n\nAdventure into Fear\nHulu ordered two series based on Ghost Rider and the siblings Daimon and Ana Helstrom in May 2019, intending to build an interconnected universe in a similar fashion to Marvel's Netflix shows [88] Marvel announced the series as the cornerstone of the \"Spirits of Vengeance\", and Loeb said they were moving into a new, \"chilling\" corner of the Marvel Universe [89] Loeb revealed in August that Marvel was now referring to these series collectively as \"Adventure into Fear\", and said more series under the banner were in development [12] A month later, Hulu decided not to move forward with Ghost Rider due to creative differences [90] When Marvel Television was folded into Marvel Studios in December, the studio said production on Helstrom would be completed but no further series would be developed [20] Upon Helstrom's release in October 2020, showrunner Paul Zbyszewski said the series was \"our own separate thing\" and not part of the MCU, [91] [92] having been \"siloed off\" in part because of its darker themes [93] Zbyszewski called it \"freeing\" to not be part of the MCU [91] He also said there were Easter eggs in the series that hinted towards the planned Adventure into Fear universe [92] Unlike Marvel Television's other series, each episode of Helstrom does not begin with the Marvel logo [94] The series was canceled in December 2020 [95]\n\n\nCrossovers to feature films\nAfter  [running something by Jeph] Loeb we'll run it through New York, Joe Quesada, Dan Buckley, and those guys  [Then we] pitch our stuff to Kevin Feige and his movie group to see if there's something we can tie into, to see if they're okay about us using a character, or a weapon or some other cool thing Everything

Marvel Studios\nIn March 2021, the Darkhold appeared in WandaVision with a different design from the one seen in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D and Runaways While WandaVision's head writer, Jac Schaeffer, said there were no \"big conversations\" among the writers regarding its appearance in the Marvel Television series, [114] [115] director Matt Shakman said that he believed it was the same one seen in those series despite the new design [116] The new Darkhold was designed by the Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022) props team, since it appears and has more screentime in that film [117] [118] The film also showed that multiple copies of the Darkhold exist [119]\n\n\nMarvel Studios series\nAll Marvel Studios series are being released on Disney+ unless otherwise noted and exist

character [193] [194] In January 2023, Gurira confirmed there had been discussions surrounding an Okoye-led series [195]\n\n\nUntitled Nova series\nIn March 2022, a project featuring the character

America: Brave New World (2025) [206] [207]\n\n\nSeries approach\nFeige described Marvel Studios' approach to their television series in January 2021, explaining that streaming on Disney+ gave Marvel Studios flexibility with the formats for each series He said some were being developed as one-off miniseries that were intended to lead into feature films, [208] [209] though additional seasons could be added to these in the future [210] Other series were always intended to cover multiple seasons while still being connected to the films, [208] such as Loki [211] These could have several years between the release of seasons, similar to series like Game of Thrones and Stranger Things [208] Feige added that each miniseries or season was intended to be around six hours of content, but this would be split in different ways depending on the story being told, such as six hour-long episodes, or nine or ten half-hour episodes [212] [213] Marvel Studios intended to make each of their series an event [214] [215] Many of the first series from the studio were approached with a feature film structure that gave the characters an arc across the series and felt like standalone limited series [216] Marvel Studios' earliest series were directed by a single person, but later series have multiple directors taking on different numbers of episodes Feige said this happened due to a combination of logistics, the needs of each story, and the studio's \"own internal learnings of making longform television\" He said the studio would continue varying the number of directors on future series as needed [209] Following the release of the Phase Four series, Feige said Marvel Studios was open to experimenting with more episodic series rather than each series always having a larger story; he pointed to Daredevil: Born Again as a particular example where they would try this [32]\n\n\nInitial approach (2021–late 2023)\nFeige described Marvel Studios' approach to their television series in January 2021, explaining that streaming on Disney+ gave Marvel Studios flexibility with the formats for each series He said some were being developed as one-off miniseries that were intended to lead

series rather than each series always having a larger story; he pointed to Daredevil: Born Again as a particular example where they would try this [32]\n\n\nOverhaul of television operations (late 2023–present)\nBy October 2023, Marvel Studios was planning to change their approach to television, moving away from their head writer model and instead hiring showrunners for their series The showrunners would develop television pilots and create series bibles to have a creative throughline throughout the entire production process The studio began to come around to this idea after Gao returned to aid She-Hulk: Attorney at Law in post-production, [151] and after the critical and commercial failure of Secret Invasion [223] Winderbaum said the studio was trying to \"marry the Marvel culture with the traditional television culture\", [151] and he felt this would help separate their streaming content from their theatrical films [216] The studio planned to hire dedicated executives to focus on television, and to create more multi-season series so audiences could form relationships with characters rather than the series just being set up for big crossover events [151] These changes allowed the studio to develop more content than they would actually produce, in line with how a \"traditional\" studio works, [224] and would only move forward with future series when they were confident in its pilot and bible [225] Winderbaum said they had started this development approach in 2022 [50] Sam Barsanti from The A.V Club discussed this philosophy change, saying it could be that Marvel Studios was \"recognizing its faults and acknowledging that its attempt to turn its Disney+ shows into stretched-out movies was a failure\", and he felt it was good for the studio to rethink its approach following recent failures, but he also noted that WandaVision and She-Hulk: Attorney at Law had fit the television formula well so it was possible to have that kind of success under the previous approach [226] /Film's Ben Pearson called the previous approach \"seriously flawed\" and said \"tried-and-true methodologies work for a reason\"; Pearson was hopeful that other Hollywood studios would not try to replicate Marvel's initial approach [227] Agatha All Along was the first series to alter the credits of its head writer, Schaeffer, to showrunner [161] [152] Vision Quest, which was announced in May 2024, was the studio's first live-action series pickup in nearly two years and the first to move forward under the studio's new development approach [154] By October 2024, the studio had adopted a budget-conscious approach to producing their series Agatha All Along was confirmed to be the studio's least expensive series to date, with a similar approach expected for future series such as  Daredevil: Born Again and Vision Quest [228]\n\n\nRelease schedule\nThe second season of What If...? (2023) was the first Marvel Studios series to be released daily, [229] while Echo (2024) was the first series released all at once; all previous Marvel Studios series had weekly releases [230] [215] The first two series were released on Fridays, followed by the majority of series since the first season of Loki being released on Wednesdays; She-Hulk: Attorney at Law was released on Thursdays The second season of Loki and Echo were released in prime time in the United States, with the former on Thursday evenings and the latter on a Tuesday evening [231]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "A._P._J._Abdul_Kalam", "content": "\nEarly life and education\nAvul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque; [10] his mother Ashiamma was a housewife [11] [12] [13] [14] His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi [15] [16]\n\n\nCareer as a scientist\nThis was my first stage, in which I learnt leadership from three great teachers—Dr Vikram Sarabhai, Prof Satish Dhawan and Dr Brahm Prakash This was the time of learning and acquisition of knowledge for me.\n\n\nPresidency\nKalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding K R Narayanan He won the 2002 presidential election with an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal His term lasted from 25 July 2002, to 25 July 2007 [40]\n\n\nPost-presidency\nAfter leaving office, Kalam became a visiting professor at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, and the Indian Institute of Management Indore; an honorary fellow of Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore; [81] chancellor of the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology Thiruvananthapuram; professor of Aerospace Engineering at Anna University; and an adjunct at many other academic and research institutions across India He taught information technology at the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, and technology at Banaras Hindu University and Anna University [82]\n\n\nDeath\nOn 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on \"Creating a Livable Planet Earth\" at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some discomfort, but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest [87] At around 6:35 p.m IST, only five minutes into his lecture, he collapsed [88] [89] He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life [88] Despite being placed in the intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m IST [88] [90] [91] His last words, to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: \"Funny guy! Are you doing well?\" [92]\n\n\nReactions\nIndia reacted to Kalam's death with an outpouring of grief; numerous tributes were paid to the former president across the nation and on social media [99] The Government of India declared a seven-day state mourning period as a mark of respect [100] President Pranab Mukherjee, Vice-president Hamid Ansari, Home Minister Rajnath Singh, and other leaders condoled the former President's demise [90] Prime Minister Narendra Modi said \"Kalam's death is a great loss to the scientific community He took India to great heights He showed the way.\" [101] Former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh, who had served as prime minister under Kalam, said, \"our country has lost a great human being who made phenomenal contributions to the promotion of self-reliance in defence technologies I worked very closely with Dr Kalam as prime minister and I greatly benefited from his advice as president of our country His life and work will be remembered for generations to come.\" [102] ISRO chairman A S Kiran Kumar called his former colleague \"a great personality and a gentleman\", while former chairman G Madhavan Nair described Kalam as \"a global leader\" for whom \"the downtrodden and poor people were his priority He always had a passion to convey what is in his mind to the young generation\", adding that his death left a vacuum which none could fill [103] [104]\n\n\nMemorial\nThe Dr A. P. J Abdul Kalam National Memorial [119] was built in memory of Kalam by the DRDO in Pei Karumbu, in the island town of Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu It was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in July 2017 [120] [121] On display are the replicas of rockets and missiles which Kalam had worked with Acrylic paintings about his life are also displayed along with hundreds of portraits depicting the life of the mass leader There is a statue of Kalam in the entrance showing him playing the Veena There are two other smaller statues of the leader in sitting and standing posture [122]\n\n\nPersonal life\nKalam was the youngest of five siblings, the eldest of whom was a sister, Asim Zohra (d. 1997), followed by three elder brothers: Mohammed Muthu Meera Lebbai Maraikayar (5 November 1916 – 7 March 2021), [123] [124] Mustafa Kalam (d. 1999) and Kasim Mohammed (d. 1995) [125] He was extremely close to his elder siblings and their extended families throughout his life, and would regularly send small sums of money to his older relations, himself remaining a lifelong bachelor [125] [126]\n\n\nReligious and spiritual views\nReligion and spirituality were very important to Kalam throughout his life [132] He made his own spiritual journey the subject of his final book, Transcendence: My Spiritual Experiences with Pramukh Swamiji [133] [134]\n\n\nIslam\nDaily namaz and fasting during Ramadan were integral to the life of Kalam, a  practising Sunni Muslim [10] [135] [136] His father, the imam of a mosque in his hometown of Rameswaram, had strictly instilled these Islamic customs in his children [10] His father had also impressed upon the young Kalam the value of interfaith respect and dialogue As Kalam recalled: \"Every evening, my father A. P Jainulabdeen, an imam, Pakshi Lakshmana Sastry, the head priest of the Ramanathaswamy Hindu temple, and a church priest used to sit with hot tea and discuss the issues concerning the island.\" [133] [137] Such early exposure convinced Kalam that the answers to India's multitudinous issues lay in \"dialogue and cooperation\" among the country's religious, social, and political leaders [135] Moreover, since Kalam believed that \"respect for other faiths\" was one of the key cornerstones of Islam, he was fond of saying: \"For great men, religion is a way of making friends; small people make religion a fighting tool.\" [138]\n\n\nSyncretism\nOne component of Kalam's widespread popularity among diverse groups in India, and an enduring aspect of his legacy, is the syncretism he embodied in appreciating various elements of the many spiritual and cultural traditions of India [135] [136] [139] [140] In addition to his faith in the Quran and Islamic practice, Kalam was well-versed in Hindu traditions;

Football League (NFL). He has previously served as the head coach at the University of Florida and Ohio State University, where he led both teams to national championships.\n\nEarly Life\n------------\n\nMeyer was born on July 10, 1964, in Toledo, Ohio. He grew up in Ashtabula, Ohio, and graduated from Ashtabula's Saint John High School in 1982. Meyer was selected in the 13th round of the 1982 Major League Baseball Draft by the Atlanta Braves as a shortstop, where he spent two seasons playing minor league baseball in the Braves organization. Concurrently, he played defensive back at the University of Cincinnati before earning his bachelor's degree in psychology in 1986. During his undergraduate studies, Meyer was a member of Sigma Chi Fraternity (Zeta Psi Chapter).\n\nCoaching Career\n----------------\n\nMeyer's coaching career spans over two decades, with 20 years of college coaching experience, including nine as a head coach. His overall record as a head coach through the end of the 2009 season was 96–18, and he was 49–14 in conference play. His winning percentage (.842) through the end of the 2009 season ranked first nationally among active college football head coaches.\n\nEarly Coaching Career\n---------------------\n\nAfter playing as a defensive back and placeholder for the University of Cincinnati, Meyer spent one season interning as a defensive back coach at Saint Xavier High School in Cincinnati, Ohio, under the mentorship of legendary St Xavier head coach Steve Rasso. His first collegiate coaching position was a two-year stint as a graduate assistant coaching tight ends at Ohio State under head coach Earle Bruce. He spent the next 13 years as an assistant—two at Illinois State, six at Colorado State, and five at Notre Dame.\n\nBowling Green\n-------------\n\nIn 2001, Meyer took his first head coaching job at Bowling Green. In his first season there, he engineered one of the greatest turnarounds in NCAA football history, going 8–3 and capping off the season with a 56–21 victory over Bowling Green's rival, the University of Toledo Rockets. He also earned Mid-American Conference coach of the year honors.\n\nUtah\n-----\n\nAfter two seasons at Bowling Green, Meyer took the job at Utah in 2003. In his first year there, Meyer was named the Mountain West Conference's Coach of the Year with a 10–2 record, the best ever for a coach's first season at Utah. He also earned honors as The Sporting News National Coach of the Year, the first Utes coach to do so. They also won the program's first outright conference championship since the 1957 team won the Skyline Conference title.\n\nFlorida\n--------\n\nIn the wake of his accomplishments at Utah, both the University of Florida and the University of Notre Dame vied for his services. Meyer chose to become Florida's head coach for the 2005 season, signing a seven-year contract worth $14 million. He later signed a six-year contract extension with the Gators on June 7, 2007; the extended contract paid an average of $3.25 million per year. On August 3, 2009, Meyer received another contract extension that made him the SEC's highest-paid coach during the 2009 season; his 2009 extension was worth $24 million over six years.\n\n2005 Season\n------------\n\nIn 2005, Meyer's first season at Florida, his Gators team finished the season 9–3 (5–3 in the Southeastern Conference). The season included an undefeated record at home and a bowl victory against Iowa in the Outback Bowl in Tampa, Florida. The Gators would have faced LSU in the SEC Championship Game, but they lost to South Carolina and former Florida head coach Steve Spurrier in the SEC regular-season finale.\n\n2006 Season\n------------\n\nIn 2006, Meyer coached the Gators to a 13–1 (8–1 in the SEC) record, with the one loss coming to the Auburn Tigers. After clinching the SEC East, the Gators won the SEC Championship Game on December 2 over Arkansas by a score of 38–28. The Gators defeated the Ohio State Buckeyes, 41–14, in the 2007 BCS National Championship Game to win the national championship. It was the first BCS bowl berth for the Gators since the Orange Bowl that capped off the 2001 campaign, and Florida's first national championship appearance and victory since winning the 1997 Sugar Bowl.\n\n2007 Season\n------------\n\nThe Gators managed a 9–3 regular season record in 2007, including blowout wins over rivals Tennessee and FSU. But once again, losing to Auburn. Quarterback Tim Tebow also became Coach Meyer's first Heisman Trophy winner. The team led the conference in scoring, but struggles on defense made it difficult for the Gators to reach a BCS bowl game. The Gators lost the Capital One Bowl to Michigan 41–35 on January 1, 2008.\n\n2008 Season\n------------\n\nIn 2008, Meyer led the Gators to a 13–1 overall record and the BCS National Championship over Oklahoma, including wins over six ranked teams. The team's lone defeat came at the hands of Ole Miss on September 27, 2008, a game in which Florida led in time of possession and passing yards, but had three turnovers. Eleven of the Gators' twelve wins in the 2008 regular season were by 20 points or more. On December 6, 2008, Meyer led the Gators to a 31–20 victory over then top-ranked Alabama in the SEC title game. Leading in time of possession, rushing yards, and passing yards, the Gators rallied from behind after a third-quarter deficit to score two touchdowns and hold Alabama scoreless in the fourth quarter. The victory would vault Florida to No 1 in the Associated Press Poll, No 2 in the USA Today Coaches' Poll, and No 2 in the BCS rankings, setting up a showdown against Oklahoma in the BCS Championship Game on January 8, 2009, at Dolphin Stadium in Miami, Florida. The Gators won 24–14, securing their second national championship under Meyer.\n\n2009 Season\n------------\n\nIn 2009, Meyer's Gators began the season ranked No 1 by the largest margin in the history of the AP preseason poll. Though the team struggled on offense at times, and quarterback Tim Tebow suffered a frightening concussion in a September victory over Kentucky, Florida finished the regular season 12–0 and still ranked No 1. The winning streak ended in the SEC Championship Game, when they lost 32–13 to Alabama.\n\nLeave of Absence\n-----------------\n\nIn the early morning of December 6, 2009, soon after returning home following his team's loss in the 2009 SEC Championship Game, Meyer was quietly admitted into a Gainesville hospital suffering from chest pains and dehydration. He was released later in the day, and the incident was not announced to the public at the time.\n\nOhio State\n------------\n\nOn November 17, 2011, it was reported that Meyer would become the head coach of the Ohio State Buckeyes. Meyer denied the report publicly, then asked ESPN to be taken off assignment during the weekend of the Ohio State–Michigan game, adding more to the speculations that he might be named the next head coach of Ohio State. On November 28, WBNS Columbus confirmed that Meyer had accepted the job as Ohio State's head football coach, and was introduced as head coach later that night. The school said Meyer would receive a six-year contract that paid $4 million annually, plus another $2.4 million total in \"retention payments.\"\n\n2012 Season\n------------\n\nIn Meyer's first year of coaching at Ohio State, he helped lead the Buckeyes to an undefeated 12–0 record and a No 3 AP Poll ranking. The team was ineligible for all other rankings, as well as postseason play, due to NCAA sanctions.\n\n2013 Season\n------------\n\nMeyer's next year was not as good as the previous one, but Ohio State still finished #12 in the BCS rankings and a 12–2 record. Meyer lost talent at the end of the year to the 2014 NFL Draft, including linebacker Ryan Shazier, cornerback Bradley Roby, and running back Carlos Hyde. Roby and Shazier went in the first round, and Hyde went in the second round.\n\n2014 Season\n------------\n\nBefore the start of the season, Ohio State lost its star quarterback, Braxton Miller, when he sustained a right shoulder injury during practice. Redshirt freshman quarterback J T Barrett stepped in as his replacement and led Ohio State to an 11–1 record through the first 12 games of the season. However, in the final game of the regular season, he sustained a broken ankle and was lost for the remainder of the year. Cardale Jones replaced Barrett at quarterback and guided Ohio State to a 59–0 blowout win over Wisconsin in the Big Ten Football Championship Game. With the conference championship and the convincing win over Wisconsin, Ohio State moved up to #4 in the College Football Playoff rankings, jumping the two Big 12 teams in playoff contention, Baylor and TCU, qualifying for the inaugural four-team postseason tournament. They played #1 Alabama in the semifinal Sugar Bowl Despite being nine-point underdogs and trailing by as much as 15 points in the first half, Ohio State came back to win, 42–35. The Buckeyes then faced Heisman Trophy winner Marcus Mariota and the Oregon Ducks in the College Football Playoff National Championship. The Buckeyes were again underdogs as the #2-ranked Ducks were favored by seven points. Despite giving up four turnovers, Ohio State beat Oregon, 42–20, with MVP performances from running back Ezekiel Elliott and safety Tyvis Powell. The victory marked the eighth national championship in Ohio State's history and gave Meyer his third career national title, following his two with Florida.\n\nJacksonville Jaguars\n-------------------\n\nOn January 14, 2021, Meyer was hired to become the head coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars. On July 1, 2021, the NFL fined Meyer $100,000 for violating practice rules during organized team activities.\n\nPersonal Life\n--------------\n\nMeyer is married to Shelley Meyer, and they have three children: Nicole, Gisela, and Nathan.

{"title": "Cass_Review", "content": "\nBackground\nThe Cass Review was commissioned by NHS England in September 2020, following a significant increase in referrals to the Gender Identity Development Service and a shift in the service from a psychosocial and psychotherapeutic model to one that included hormonal treatment [20] [21] Hilary Cass, a former president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, was asked by NHS England and NHS Improvement's Quality and Innovation Committee to chair an independent review with the aim of improving gender identity services for children and young people [20]\n\n\nMethodology\nThe Cass Review commissioned several independent, peer-reviewed systematic reviews into different areas of healthcare for children and young people with gender identity issues, including gender dysphoria [22] [23] The reviews were carried out by academics at the University of York's Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, one of three bodies funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) to provide a systematic review service to the NHS [24] The topics covered by the systematic reviews were: [25]\n\n\nInterim report\nThe interim report [41] of the Cass Review was published in March 2022 It said that the rise in referrals had led to the staff being overwhelmed, and recommended the creation of a network of regional hubs to provide care and support to young people The report said that the clinical approach used by the Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS) \"has not been subjected to some of the usual control measures\" [42] typically applied with new treatments, and raised concerns about the lack of data collection by GIDS [43] [44] While GIDS initially followed the Dutch protocol, the interim review said there were \"significant differences\" in the current NHS approach [45] The report stated that children with comorbidities did not receive adequate psychological support, endocrinologists administering puberty blockers did not attend multidisciplinary meetings, and the frequency of those meetings did not increase when adolescents received puberty blockers, all of which the Dutch Approach recommends [45]\n\n\nFinal report\nThe final report of the Cass Review was published on 10 April 2024 It included several systematic reviews of scientific literature carried out by University of York, encompassing the patient cohort, service pathways, international guidelines, social transitioning, puberty blockers and hormone treatments [25]\n\n\nFindings\nThe report states on page 20 that, \"When the Review started, the evidence base, particularly in relation to the use of puberty blockers and masculinising or feminising hormones, had already been shown to be weak\"; and that after the examination of over 100 pieces of potential evidence, that \"there continues to be a lack of high-quality evidence in this area\" [52]\n\n\nLack of research\nThe report states on page 20 that, \"When the Review started, the evidence base, particularly in relation to the use of puberty blockers and masculinising or feminising hormones, had already been shown to be weak\"; and that after the examination of over 100 pieces of potential evidence, that \"there continues to be a lack of high-quality evidence in this area\" [52]\n\n\nIncrease in referrals\nThe report found no clear explanation for the rise in the number of children and adolescents with gender dysphoria, but said there was broad agreement for attribution to a mix of biological and psychosocial factors The report's suggested influences included a lower threshold for medical treatment, social media-related mental health consequences, abuse, access to information regarding gender dysphoria, struggles with emerging sexual orientation, and early exposure to online pornography The report considered a rise in acceptance of transgender identities to be insufficient to explain the increase [53] [26] [54] [55]\n\n\nSocial transition\nA systematic review evaluated 11 studies assessing the outcomes of social transition in minors using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale and considered nine to be low quality and two to be moderate quality [34] [27] The report said that insufficient evidence was available to assess whether social transition in childhood has positive or negative effects on mental health, and that there was weak evidence for efficacy in adolescence It also said that sex of rearing seems to influence gender identity, and hypothesised that early social transition may change the way a child's gender identity develops [56]\n\n\nPuberty blockers\nThe report said that the evidence base and rationale for early puberty suppression remains unclear, with unknown effects on cognitive and psychosexual development A systematic review [29] examined 50 studies on the use of puberty blockers using a modified version of the Newcastle–Ottawa scale and considered only one to be of high quality, along with a further 25 being of moderate quality, and the remaining 24 being of low quality The review concluded that the lack of evidence means no conclusions can be made regarding the impact on gender dysphoria and mental health, but did find evidence of bone health being compromised during treatment The review disagreed with the idea of puberty blockers providing youth patients with \"time to think\", due to its finding that nearly all patients who went on blockers later decided to proceed on to hormone therapy [58] [29] [59] [55] [60] [61] For youth assigned male at birth the report states that blockers taken too early can make a later penile inversion vaginoplasty more difficult due to insufficient penile growth [62]\nThe report states one of the benefits of puberty blockers is the prevention the irreversible changes of a lower voice and facial hair [63]\n\n\nHormone therapy\nThe report said that many unknowns remained for the use of hormone treatment among under-18s, despite longstanding use among transgender adults, with poor long-term follow-up data and outcome information on those starting younger A systematic review [30] evaluated 53 studies on transgender hormone therapy using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale, and considered only one study to be of high quality, 33 moderate and 19 low quality Overall, the review found some evidence that hormone treatment improves psychological outcomes after 12 months, but found insufficient and inconsistent evidence regarding physical risks and benefits The review advised that there should be a 'clear clinical rationale' for the prescription of hormone therapy under 18 years of age [58] [30] [59] [57]\n\n\nPsychosocial intervention\nA systematic review assessed ten studies on the efficacy of psychosocial support interventions in transgender minors using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool and considered only one to be of medium quality, with the remaining nine being of low quality The review concluded that no robust conclusions can be made and more research is needed [28] [64]\n\n\nClinical pathways\nThe report said that clinicians cannot be certain which children and young people will have an enduring trans identity in adulthood, and that for most, a medical pathway will not be the most appropriate When a medical pathway is clinically indicated, wider mental health or psychosocial issues should also be addressed Due to a lack of follow-up, the number of individuals who detransitioned after hormone treatment was unknown [58]\n\n\nInternational guidelines\nA systematic review [32] [33] assessed 23 regional, national and international guidelines covering key areas of practice, such as care principles, assessment methods and medical interventions Most guidelines were said to lack editorial independence and developmental rigour, and were nearly all influenced by the 2009 Endocrine Society guideline and the 2012 WPATH guideline, which were themselves closely linked The Cass review questioned the guidelines' reliability, and concluded that no single international guideline regarding transgender care could be applied in its entirety to NHS England [58]\n\n\nConflicting clinical views\nThe report identified conflicting views among clinicians regarding appropriate treatment, with expectations of care sometimes deviating from clinical norms It said that disputes over language such as \"exploratory\" and \"affirmative\" approaches meant it was difficult to establish neutral terminology Some clinicians feared working with gender-questioning young people [69] The report said that some professionals were concerned about being accused of conversion practices, and were likewise concerned about legislation to ban conversion therapy The report went on to say that many professionals were \"overshadowed by an unhelpfully polarised debate around conversion practices\" [70] [71]\n\n\nRecommendations\nThe report made 32 recommendations covering areas including assessment of children and young people, diagnosis, psychological interventions, social transition, improving the evidence base underpinning medical and non-medical interventions, puberty blockers and hormone treatments, service improvements, education and training, clinical pathways, detransition and private provision [72]\n\n\nImplementation\nNHS England responded positively to the interim and final reports As of April 2024 [update] they have implemented a number of measures [5] In response to the interim report, in March 2024 NHS England announced that it would no longer prescribe puberty blockers to minors outside of use in clinical research trials, citing insufficient evidence of safety or clinical effectiveness [88] [89] The Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS) at the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust closed in March 2024 [5] Two new services, located in the north west of England and in London, opened in April 2024, which are intended to be the first of up to eight regional services [5] These will follow a new service specification for the \"assessment, diagnosis and treatment of children and young people presenting with gender incongruence\" [5] Puberty suppressing hormones are no longer routinely available in NHS youth gender services [5] New patients that have been assessed as possibly benefiting from them will be required to participate in a clinical trial that is being set up by the National Institute for Health and Care Research [22] [90] A new board, chaired by Simon Wessely will encourage further research in the areas highlighted in the review as having a weak evidence base [5]\n\n\nReception\nConservative Prime Minister at the time Rishi Sunak said that the findings \"shine a spotlight\" on the need for a cautious approach to child and adolescent gender care [93] [94] In their manifesto for the 2024 United Kingdom general election, the Conservatives promised to implement the Cass Review recommendations [95]\n\n\nResponse from UK political parties and public bodies\nConservative Prime Minister at the time Rishi Sunak said that the findings \"shine a spotlight\" on the need for a cautious approach to child and adolescent gender care [93] [94] In their manifesto for the 2024 United Kingdom general election, the Conservatives promised to implement the Cass Review recommendations [95]\n\n\nResponse from devolved governments\nThe Scottish Government said it would \"take the time to consider the findings\" [102] Humza Yousaf, First Minister of Scotland and SNP leader at the time of the final report's release, said that while the Scottish government would discuss the Cass Review with health authorities, it would leave its implementation up to clinicians [103]\n\n\nResponse from health bodies in the United Kingdom\nThe British Psychological Society said in April 2024 that they support \"the report's primary focus of expanding service capacity across the country\" and acknowledged that \"while psychological therapies will continue to have an incredibly important role to play in the new services, more needs to be done to assess the effectiveness of these psychological interventions.\" BPS president Roman Raczka commended the review as \"thorough and sensitive\", in light of the complex and controversial nature of the subject He said \"it will take time to carefully review and respond to the whole report\" but he was sure the field of psychology would learn lessons from it He welcomed the recommendation for a consortium of relevant bodies to develop better trainings and upskill the workforce [9]\n\n\nResponse from other health bodies globally\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics and the Endocrine Society both responded to the report by reaffirming their support for gender-affirming care for minors and saying that their current policies supporting such treatments are \"grounded in evidence and science\" [112]\n\n\nResponse from transgender specialist medical bodies\nThe World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) released an email statement saying that the report \"is rooted in the false premise that non-medical alternatives to care will result in less adolescent distress\" and further criticised recommendations which \"severely restrict access to physical healthcare, and focus almost exclusively on mental healthcare for a population which the World Health Organization does not regard as inherently mentally ill\" [118] [119] An official statement expanded on these concerns, saying Hilary Cass had \"negligible prior knowledge or clinical experience\", asserting that \"the (research and consensus-based) evidence is such to recommend that providing medical treatment including puberty-blocking medication and hormone therapy is helpful and often life-saving\", and questioning the provision of puberty blockers only in the context of a research protocol: \"The use of a randomized blinded control group, which would lead to the highest quality of evidence, is ethically not feasible.\" [120]\n\n\nOther academic responses\nThe report was praised by some academics in the UK, who agreed with its findings stating a lack of evidence; [97] [67] [124] while others both in the UK [125] and internationally [113] [126] [127] disagreed with the report's methodology and findings.\n\n\nReception by advocacy organisations\nAmnesty International criticised \"sensationalised coverage\" of the review, stating \"This review is being weaponised by people who revel in spreading disinformation and myths about healthcare for trans young people.\" [18] [132] Trans youth charity Mermaids and the LGBTQIA+ charity Stonewall endorsed some of the report's recommendations, such as expanding service provisions with the new regional hubs, but raised concerns the review's recommendations may lead to barriers for transgender youth in accessing care [121]\n\n\nHilary Cass's response\nIn the week after the release of the final report, Cass described receiving abusive emails and was given security advice to avoid public transport [135] She also said that \"disinformation\" had frequently been spread online about the report Cass said \"if you deliberately try to undermine a report that has looked at the evidence of children's healthcare, then that's unforgivable You are putting children at risk by doing that.\" [135] There were widespread false claims from critics of the report that it had dismissed 98% of the studies it collected and all studies which were not double-blind experiments Cass described these claims as being \"completely incorrect\" Although only 2% of the papers collected were considered to be of high quality, 60% of the papers, including those considered to be of moderate quality, were considered in the report's evidence synthesis [38] [136] [137] She criticised Labour MP Dawn Butler for repeating, during a debate in the House of Commons, incorrect claims that the review had dismissed more than 100 studies [138] [139] [140] After talking with Cass, Butler subsequently used a point of order to admit her mistake and correct the record in Parliament, stating the figure came from a briefing she had received from Stonewall [137] [141] [142] [143]\n\n\nSubsequent government actions in the UK\nIn May 2024, then Health Secretary Victoria Atkins implemented an emergency three-month ban on the prescription of puberty blockers by medical providers outside of the NHS It went into effect on 3 June 2024 and was set to expire on 3 September 2024 The ban restricted their use to only those already taking them, or within a clinical trial In July, this ban was challenged by campaign groups TransActual and Good Law Project who brought a legal case arguing the ban was unlawful [146] On 29 July 2024 the High Court of Justice ruled that the ban was lawful [147] [4] [148]\n\n\nBan on non-NHS prescription of puberty blockers\nIn

Clinics\nThe Cass Review did not cover adult care, and in April 2024, NHS England said it would also initiate a review of all its adult gender clinics in response [153] NHS England National Director of Specialised Commissioning John Stewart sent a letter to Cass stating that it would review the use of gender-affirming transgender hormone therapy in adults in a similar manner as was done for puberty blockers in the Cass Review [154] [155] [156]\n\n\nNHS Scotland\nOn 18 April 2024, NHS Scotland announced that it had paused prescribing puberty blockers to children referred by its specialist gender clinic [161] The chief medical officer of Scotland set up a multidisciplinary clinical team to asses how the Cass Review's 32 recommendations might be applied to NHS Scotland Their Cass Review – implications for Scotland: findings report was published in July 2024 and found that the majority of recommendations were applicable to NHS Scotland to a varying degree, with some modification dealing with differences in the Scottish health service They recommended that the use of puberty blockers be paused until clinical trials are begun NHS Scotland will participate in the forthcoming UK study [162] That report was fully accepted by the Scottish government in September Among the changes recommended are that the gender identity service for children and young people should be moved to a paediatric setting and more than one service offered across the regions In common with other specialities, a referral to these services will now be required to have come from a clinician rather than the patient themselves [7]\n\n\nOther government bodies actions\nIn October 2024, the Charity Commission for England and Wales released an inquiry into the trans children's charity Mermaids The inquiry issued \"regulatory advice and guidance\" to the charity telling them to further consider the Cass Review's findings and conclusions as well as review the guidance and positions on their website regarding puberty blockers [163]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Cass Review**\n\nThe Cass Review was a major investigation into the treatment of children and young people with gender dysphoria, commissioned by NHS England in 2020. The review was led by Hilary Cass, a former president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, and aimed to improve the care and support provided to young people with gender identity issues.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Cass Review was commissioned in response to a significant increase in referrals to the Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS) and a shift in the service from a psychosocial and psychotherapeutic model to one that included hormonal treatment. Hilary Cass was asked to chair an independent review to investigate the evidence base for the treatment of children and young people with gender dysphoria and to make recommendations for improvement.\n\n**Methodology**\n\nThe Cass Review commissioned several independent, peer-reviewed systematic reviews into different areas of healthcare for children and young people with gender identity issues, including gender dysphoria. These reviews were carried out by academics at the University of York's Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, one of three bodies funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) to provide a systematic review service to the NHS. The topics covered by the systematic reviews included the patient cohort, service pathways, international guidelines, social transitioning, puberty blockers, and hormone treatments.\n\n**Interim Report**\n\nThe interim report of the Cass Review was published in March 2022. The report found that the rise in referrals had led to staff being overwhelmed, and recommended the creation of a network of regional hubs to provide care and support to young people. The report also raised concerns about the lack of data collection by GIDS, the differences in the NHS approach compared to the Dutch protocol, and the need for improved psychological support for young people with comorbidities.\n\n**Final Report**\n\nThe final report of the Cass Review was published on April 10, 2024. The report included several systematic reviews of scientific literature carried out by the University of York, encompassing the patient cohort, service pathways, international guidelines, social transitioning, puberty blockers, and hormone treatments.

being overwhelmed, and recommended the creation of a network of regional hubs to provide care and support to young people The report said that the clinical approach used by the Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS) \"has not been subjected to some of the usual control measures\" [42] typically applied with new treatments, and raised concerns about the lack of data collection by GIDS [43] [44] While GIDS initially followed the Dutch protocol, the interim review said there were \"significant differences\" in the current NHS approach [45] The report stated that children with comorbidities did not receive adequate psychological support, endocrinologists administering puberty blockers did not attend multidisciplinary meetings, and the frequency of those meetings did not increase when adolescents received puberty blockers, all of which the Dutch Approach recommends [45]\n\n\nFinal report\nThe final report of the Cass Review was published on 10 April 2024 It included

concerns the review's recommendations may lead to barriers for transgender youth in accessing care [121]\n\n\nHilary Cass's response\nIn the week after the release of the final report, Cass described receiving abusive emails and was given security advice to avoid public transport [135] She also said that \"disinformation\" had frequently been spread online about the report Cass said \"if you deliberately try to undermine a report that has looked at the evidence of children's healthcare, then that's unforgivable You are putting children at risk by doing that.\" [135] There were widespread false claims from critics of the report that it had dismissed 98% of the studies it collected and all studies which were not double-blind experiments Cass described these claims as being \"completely incorrect\" Although only 2% of the papers collected were considered to be of high quality, 60% of the papers, including those considered to be of moderate quality, were considered in the report's evidence synthesis [38] [136] [137] She criticised Labour MP Dawn Butler for repeating, during a debate in the House of Commons, incorrect claims that the review had dismissed more than 100 studies [138] [139] [140] After talking with Cass, Butler subsequently used a point of order to admit her mistake and correct the record in Parliament, stating the figure came from a briefing she had received from Stonewall [137] [141] [142] [143]\n\n\nSubsequent government actions in the UK\nIn May 2024, then Health Secretary Victoria Atkins implemented an emergency three-month ban on the prescription of puberty blockers by medical providers outside of the NHS It went into effect on 3 June 2024 and was set to expire on 3 September 2024 The ban restricted their use to only those already taking them, or within a clinical trial In July, this ban was challenged by campaign groups TransActual and Good Law Project who brought a legal case arguing the ban was unlawful [146] On 29 July 2024 the High Court of Justice ruled that the ban was lawful [147] [4] [148]\n\n\nBan on non-NHS prescription of puberty blockers\nIn May 2024, then Health Secretary Victoria Atkins implemented an emergency three-month ban on the prescription of puberty blockers by medical providers outside of the NHS It went into effect on 3 June 2024 and was set to expire on 3 September 2024 The ban restricted their use to only those already taking them, or within a clinical trial In July, this ban was challenged by campaign groups TransActual and Good Law Project who brought a legal case arguing the ban was unlawful [146] On 29 July 2024 the High Court of Justice ruled that the ban was lawful [147] [4] [148]\n\n\nAdult Clinics\nThe Cass Review did not cover adult care, and in April 2024, NHS England said it would also initiate a review of all its adult gender clinics in response [153] NHS England National Director of Specialised Commissioning John Stewart sent a letter to Cass stating that it would review the use of gender-affirming transgender hormone therapy in adults in a similar manner as was done for puberty blockers in the Cass Review [154] [155] [156]\n\n\nNHS Scotland\nOn 18 April 2024, NHS Scotland announced that it had paused prescribing puberty blockers to children referred by its specialist gender clinic [161] The chief medical officer of Scotland set up a multidisciplinary clinical team to asses how the Cass Review's 32 recommendations might be applied to NHS Scotland Their Cass Review – implications for Scotland: findings report was published in July 2024 and found that the majority of recommendations were applicable to NHS Scotland to a varying degree, with some modification dealing with differences in the Scottish health service They recommended that the use of puberty blockers be paused until clinical trials are begun NHS Scotland will participate in the forthcoming UK study [162] That report was fully accepted by the Scottish government in September Among the changes recommended are that the gender identity service for children and young people should be moved to a paediatric setting and more than one service offered across the regions In common with other specialities, a referral to these services will now be required to have come from a clinician rather than the patient themselves [7]\n\n\nOther government bodies actions\nIn October 2024, the Charity Commission for England and Wales released an inquiry into the trans children's charity Mermaids The inquiry issued \"regulatory advice and guidance\" to the charity telling them to further consider the Cass Review's findings and conclusions as well as review the guidance and positions on their website regarding puberty blockers [163]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nExternal

Born on January 11, 1970, in Mattaparru, a village near Malikipuram in the erstwhile East Godavari district (present-day Konaseema district) of Andhra Pradesh, Sukumar is known for his unique storytelling style, complex characters, and emotional depth in his films. Throughout his career, he has been instrumental in shaping the Telugu film industry with his innovative approach and critically acclaimed movies.\n\n**Early Life and Family**\n\nSukumar was born to Tirupathi Rao Naidu, a rice trader, and Veera Veni, a homemaker. He was the youngest of six children, and his family's humble background had a significant impact on his early life. Sukumar's love for animals and his vegetarian diet, which he adopted after witnessing the slaughter of a rooster he loved, have been a part of his life since childhood. These experiences have influenced his storytelling and character development in his films.\n\n**Career**\n\nSukumar began his career as a writer in Telugu cinema, working on several films, including Jayanth C Paranjee's Bavagaru Bagunnara? (1998). However, he walked out of the film on moral grounds, citing the film's commercialization. This incident marked the beginning of his journey as a director. Sukumar worked as an assistant director for Manasichi Choodu (1998), Kshemamga Velli Labhamga Randi (2000), and Hanuman Junction (2001). He later assisted V V Vinayak on Dil (2003). Sukumar's directorial debut, Arya (2004), marked a significant turning point in his career.\n\n**Debut and Breakthrough: 2004-2011**\n\nSukumar began working on the script of Arya in Visakhapatnam, before joining the sets of Vinayak's Dil. The film was produced by Dil Raju, who assured Sukumar that he would produce Arya if Dil became a commercial success. Sukumar's script, which featured a boy confessing his love to a girl right in the beginning, opposed the conventional approach of revealing the protagonist's love or obsession for the female lead towards the end. Raju was impressed with Sukumar's script, and Allu Arjun was selected as the protagonist. The film was a commercial success, collecting a share of ₹16 crore and a box office gross of ₹30 crore on a budget of ₹4 crore. The success of Arya catapulted Sukumar into stardom overnight, earning him the Filmfare Award for Best Director – Telugu at the 52nd Filmfare Awards South ceremony and the Best Screenplay Writer award at the annual Nandi Awards ceremony.\n\n**Darker Themes: 2014-Present**\n\nAfter completing 100% Love, Sukumar began working on 1: Nenokkadine, a psychological thriller with Mahesh Babu in mind as the protagonist. The film's script was inspired by a real-life incident, where a bus driver talked about a young boy who claimed that his parents were murdered in that bus. Sukumar worked on the script for two months, considering it his dream project. 1: Nenokkadine was released on January 10, 2014, and received mixed reviews from critics. While some critics opined that Sukumar failed to deliver, others praised his subtle approach to the psychological thriller. Despite being a commercial failure, 1: Nenokkadine has become a major cult film.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nSukumar met Thabitha Hamsini at the screening of Arya, in the Sudarshan Theatre, RTC X Roads, in Hyderabad. After a courtship of four years, they got married in 2009, in the presence of his parents and sister. Thabitha's parents initially opposed their relationship, citing Sukumar's profession as a film director. However, they later accepted their alliance. The couple has a daughter and a son, named Sukriti and Sukranth, respectively.\n\n**Craft, Style, and Technical Collaborations**\n\nAs a writer, Sukumar is influenced by the works of Gudipati Venkatachalam, Yandamuri Veerendranath, and Yaddanapudi Sulochana Rani. He revealed in an interview that each of the romantic scenes in his films are inspired from the writings of either Veerendranath or Sulochana Rani. Sukumar mentioned that Martin Scorsese has had a huge influence on him. He uses non-linear screenplay for most of his films and few sequences of most of his films involve revelation of finest details and re-visiting a scene again and again. His screenplays are mostly complex and multi-layered, earning him the reputation of being an intelligent screenplay writer.\n\n**Film Production**\n\nSukumar Writings or SW is the production company of Sukumar. The company's first venture was Kumari 21F, which was produced by Ashok Banreddi and Thomas Reddy, in association with PA Motion Pictures and Vijaya Prasad Bandreddi. The film featured Sukumar's norm technicians, including Devi Sri Prasad as the music composer and R Rathnavelu as the director of cinematography.\n\n**Filmography**\n\nSukumar's filmography includes:\n\n* Arya (2004)\n* 100% Love (2011)\n* 1: Nenokkadine (2014)\n* Mahanati (2018)\n* Pushpa: The Rise (2021)\n\n**Awards and Nominations**\n\nSukumar has won several awards, including:\n\n* Filmfare Award for Best Director – Telugu for Arya (2005)\n* Best Screenplay Writer award at the annual Nandi Awards ceremony for Arya (2005)\n* Best Director award at the 63rd Filmfare Awards South ceremony for 1: Nenokkadine (2014)\n\n**Notes**\n\nSukumar's films have been praised for their unique storytelling, complex characters, and emotional depth.

they both collaborated with Sukumar in many of his future projects Arya was commercially successful; collecting a share of ₹16 crore and a box office gross of ₹30 crore [14] on a budget of ₹4 crore [13]The success of Arya catapulted Sukumar into stardom overnight [9] He earned the Filmfare Award for Best Director – Telugu at the 52nd Filmfare Awards South ceremony, [15] and the Best Screenplay Writer award at the annual Nandi Awards ceremony [16]\n\n\nDarker themes: 2014–present\nAfter completing 100% Love, Sukumar began working on 1: Nenokkadine, a psychological thriller keeping Mahesh Babu in mind as the protagonist as he felt that Mahesh had a universal appeal in terms of looks The incident of a bus driver talking about a young boy who claims that his parents were murdered in that bus was taken as the story's base [29] He worked on the film's script for two months, [30] and considered it as his dream project [31] 1: Nenokkadine was released on 10 January 2014 globally and received mixed reviews from the critics [32] [33] While Suresh Kavirayani of Deccan Chronicle opined that Sukumar \"fails to deliver\" and the story is \"run of the mill\", [34] Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu stated, \"Habitual to watching films that begin with a great premise only to fall into the commercial trap of force-fit comic situations, it comes as a relief when Sukumar laces the psychological thriller with subtle wit that never takes the focus away from the plot\" [35] Following the mixed reviews, 1: Nenokkadine collected approximately ₹28.9 crore share worldwide on a budget of ₹60–70 crore, thus becoming a commercial failure [36] Over the years, 1: Nenokkadine  became a major cult film.\n\n\nPersonal life\nSukumar met Thabitha Hamsini at the screening of Arya, in the Sudarshan Theatre, RTC X Roads, in Hyderabad [48] After a courtship of 4 years, they got married in 2009, in the presence of his parents and sister [7] Thabitha's parents initially opposed their relationship due to Sukumar being a film director, however, they later accepted their alliance [7] The couple have a daughter and a son, named Sukriti and Sukranth, respectively [48]\n\n\nCraft, style, and technical collaborations\nAs a writer, Sukumar is influenced by the works of Gudipati Venkatachalam, Yandamuri Veerendranath, and Yaddanapudi Sulochana Rani In an interview with Deccan Chronicle, he revealed that each of the romantic scenes in his films are inspired from the writings of either Veerendranath or Sulochana Rani [7] Sukumar mentioned that Martin Scorsese has had a huge influence on him [49] He uses non-linear screenplay for most of his films and few sequences of most of his films involve revelation of finest details and re-visiting a scene again and again [50] His screenplays are mostly complex and multi-layered which earned him the reputation of being an intelligent screenplay writer In an interview of The Times of India in January 2014, Sukumar said that emotions play a key role in his films, stating that a film \"may have multiple subplots, but in the end, it's the emotional curve that connects with the audience\" [51] Because of improvising the sequences on the sets and making changes to already filmed portions, his films took long time to complete their production phases [52]\n\n\nFilm production\nSukumar Writings or SW is the production company of Sukumar [63] [64] [65] Sukumar Writings' first venture was Kumari 21F, which had Sukumar's norm technicians of Devi Sri Prasad composing music and R Rathnavelu as the director of cinematography Ashok Banreddi and Thomas Reddy joined as co-producers with P A Motion Pictures;

a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block [96] Thus, the program's visual structure accurately represents its semantic structure [97] This feature is sometimes termed the off-side rule Some other languages use indentation this way; but in most, indentation has no semantic meaning The recommended indent size is four spaces [98]\n\n\nStatements and control flow\nPython's statements include:\n\n\nExpressions\nPython's expressions include:\n\n\nMethods\nMethods on objects are functions attached to the object's class;

rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that it is not of a suitable type Despite being dynamically typed, Python is strongly typed, forbidding operations that are not well-defined (for example, adding a number to a string) rather than silently attempting to make sense of them.\n\n\nArithmetic operations\nPython has the usual symbols for arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), the floor division operator // and the modulo operation % (where the remainder can be negative, e.g 4 % -3 == -2) It also has ** for exponentiation, e.g 5**3 == 125 and 9**0.5 == 3.0, and a matrix‑multiplication operator @  [123] These operators work like in traditional math;

It has since become one of the most popular programming languages in the world, widely used in various fields such as web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.\n\n# History\n\nPython was invented in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL. Its implementation began in December 1989 at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python, shouldered sole responsibility for the project until July 12, 2018, when he announced his \"permanent vacation\" from his responsibilities as Python's \"benevolent dictator for life\" (BDFL). In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.\n\n## Design Philosophy and Features\n\nPython is a multi-paradigm programming language that supports object-oriented programming, structured programming, and functional programming. It also supports aspect-oriented programming, including metaprogramming and metaobjects. Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract and logic programming. Python is known as a glue language, able to work well with many other languages with ease of access.\n\n## Syntax and Semantics\n\nPython is designed to be an easily readable language, with a visually uncluttered formatting style. It uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation, and does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks. Semicolons after statements are allowed but rarely used. Python has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.\n\n## Indentation\n\nPython uses whitespace indentation to delimit blocks, rather than curly brackets or keywords. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements, and a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block. This feature is sometimes termed the off-side rule. Some other languages use indentation in a similar way, but in most, indentation has no semantic meaning. The recommended indent size is four spaces.\n\n## Statements and Control Flow\n\nPython's statements include expressions, which can be used to assign a value to a variable, call a function, or perform an operation. Python's control flow statements include if-else statements, for loops, while loops, and try-except blocks.\n\n## Methods\n\nMethods on objects are functions attached to the object's class, and are called using the syntax instance.method(argument). Python methods have an explicit self parameter to access instance data, in contrast to the implicit self in some other object-oriented programming languages. Python also provides methods, often called dunder methods, to allow user-defined classes to modify how they are handled by native operations, including length, comparison, arithmetic operations, and type conversion.\n\n## Typing\n\nPython uses duck typing, which means that type constraints are not checked at compile time. Instead, operations on an object may fail, signifying that it is not of a suitable type. Despite being dynamically typed, Python is strongly typed, forbidding operations that are not well-defined.\n\n## Arithmetic Operations\n\nPython has the usual symbols for arithmetic operators, including +, -, \\*, /, //, and %. It also has ** for exponentiation, and a matrix-multiplication operator @. These operators work like in traditional math, with the same precedence rules.\n\n## Programming Examples\n\nOne of the simplest Python programs is the \"Hello, World!\" program, which prints the string \"Hello, World!\" to the console.\n\nLibraries\n\nPython's standard library provides tools suited to many tasks, and is commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths. It includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary-precision decimals, manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing.\n\nDevelopment Environments\n\nMost Python implementations, including CPython, include a read-eval-print loop (REPL), which permits them to function as a command-line interpreter. Users can enter statements sequentially and receive results immediately.\n\nImplementations\n\nCPython is the reference implementation of Python, written in C, meeting the C89 standard. It includes its own C extensions, but third-party extensions are not limited to older C versions. CPython compiles Python programs into an intermediate bytecode, which is then executed by its virtual machine. CPython is distributed with a large standard library written in a mixture of C and native Python, and is available for many platforms, including Windows and most modern Unix-like systems.\n\nReference Implementation\n\nCPython is the reference implementation of Python, and is used as a basis for other Python implementations. It is written in C, meeting the C89 standard, and includes its own C extensions.\n\nOther Implementations\n\nAll alternative implementations have at least slightly different semantics, such as unordered dictionaries, unlike all current Python versions. Other just-in-time Python compilers have been developed, but are now unsupported.\n\nCross-compilers to Other Languages\n\nThere are several compilers/transpilers to high-level object languages, with either unrestricted Python, a restricted subset of Python, or a language similar to Python as the source language.\n\nPerformance\n\nPython's performance compared to other programming languages is also benchmarked by The Computer Language Benchmarks Game.\n\nDevelopment\n\nPython's development is conducted largely through the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) process, which is the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input on issues, and documenting Python design decisions. Python coding style is covered in PEP 8.\n\nAPI Documentation Generators\n\nTools that can generate documentation for Python API include pydoc, Sphinx, Pdoc, and Doxygen.\n\nNaming\n\nPython's name is derived from the British comedy group Monty Python, which Guido van Rossum enjoyed while developing the language. Monty Python references appear frequently in Python code and culture.\n\nPopularity\n\nSince 2003, Python has consistently ranked in the top ten most popular programming languages in the TIOBE Programming Community Index. As of December 2022, it was the most popular language, ahead of C, C++, and Java. It was selected as Programming Language of the Year in 2007, 2010, 2018, and 2020.\n\nUses\n\nPython can serve as a scripting language for web applications, e.g. via mod_wsgi for the Apache webserver. With Web Server Gateway Interface, a standard API has evolved to facilitate these applications. Web frameworks like Django, Pylons, Pyramid, TurboGears, web2py, Tornado, Flask, Bottle, and Zope support developers in the design and maintenance of complex applications.\n\nLanguages Influenced by Python\n\nPython's design and philosophy have influenced many other programming languages, such as Ruby, JavaScript, and Go.\n\nSee Also\n\n* Python 3.x\n* Python 2.x\n* Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP)\n* Python Standard Library\n* CPython\n* PEP 8\n* Monty Python", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Python_(programming_language)\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nPython was invented in the late 1980s [41] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, [42] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system [12] Its implementation began in December 1989 [43] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his \"permanent vacation\" from his responsibilities as Python's \"benevolent dictator for life\" (BDFL), a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker [44] (he has since come out of retirement and is self-titled \"BDFL-emeritus\") In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project [45] [46]\n\n\nDesign philosophy and features\nPython is a multi-paradigm programming language Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of their features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including metaprogramming [73] and metaobjects) [74] Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract [75] [76] and logic programming [77] Python is known as a glue language, [78] able to work very well with many other languages with ease of access.\n\n\nSyntax and semantics\nPython is meant to be an easily readable language Its formatting is visually uncluttered and often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but rarely used It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal [95]\n\n\nIndentation\nPython uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks An increase in indentation comes after certain statements;

[192] for example, the metasyntactic variables often used in Python literature are spam and eggs instead of the traditional foo and bar [192] [193] The official Python documentation also contains various references to Monty Python routines [194] [195] Users of Python are sometimes referred to as \"Pythonistas\" [196]\n\n\nPopularity\nSince 2003, Python has consistently ranked in the top ten most popular programming languages in the TIOBE Programming Community Index where as of December 2022 [update] it was the most popular language (ahead of C, C++, and Java) [39] It was selected as Programming Language of the Year (for \"the highest rise in ratings in a year\") in 2007, 2010, 2018, and 2020 (the only language to have done so four times as of 2020 [update] [197]).\n\n\nUses\nPython can serve as a scripting language for web applications, e.g via mod_wsgi for the Apache webserver [210] With Web Server Gateway Interface, a standard API has evolved to facilitate these applications Web frameworks like Django, Pylons, Pyramid, TurboGears, web2py, Tornado, Flask, Bottle, and Zope support developers in the design and maintenance of complex applications Pyjs and IronPython can be used to develop the client-side of Ajax-based applications SQLAlchemy can be used as a data mapper to a relational database Twisted is a framework to program communications between computers, and is used (for example) by Dropbox.\n\n\nLanguages influenced by Python\nPython's design and philosophy have influenced many other programming languages:\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

They are known for their rich cultural heritage, unique traditions, and contributions to the region's history and society.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Hindu caste system of the Kashmir region was influenced by the influx of Buddhism from the time of Asoka, around the third century BCE. This led to a blurring of the traditional lines of varna, with the exception of that for the Brahmins. Another notable feature of early Kashmiri society was the relatively high regard in which women were held, compared to their position in other communities of the period.\n\n**Early History**\n\nThe Kashmir Valley was inhabited by various tribes and communities, including the ancient Dards, who were believed to be the original inhabitants of the region. The Dards were later displaced by the Indo-Aryan tribes, who brought with them their language, culture, and traditions. The Kashmiri Pandits are believed to have descended from these Indo-Aryan tribes.\n\n**Medieval History**\n\nDuring the medieval period, the Kashmir Valley was ruled by various Muslim rulers, who introduced Islam to the region. This led to a significant shift in the demographics of the valley, with many Kashmiri Pandits converting to Islam or fleeing the region. The Sultan Sikandar Butshikan, who ruled Kashmir from 1389 to 1413, was known for his destruction of non-Muslim religious symbols and forced conversions of the population. Many Kashmiri Pandits migrated to other parts of India, particularly to the cities of Jammu, Delhi, and Benares.\n\n**Modern History**\n\nAfter India gained independence in 1947, the Kashmiri Pandits continued to live in the valley, but their numbers gradually decreased due to various factors, including the 1950 land reforms, which led to the displacement of many Kashmiri Pandits. By the 1980s, the Pandit population had dwindled to just 5% of the total population of the valley.\n\n**Exodus from Kashmir (1989-1995)**\n\nThe Kashmiri Pandits faced significant persecution and violence in the 1990s, particularly during the peak of the Kashmir insurgency. Many Pandits were forced to flee the valley, leaving behind their homes, businesses, and livelihoods. An estimated 300,000 to 400,000 Kashmiri Pandits migrated to other parts of India, particularly to the cities of Jammu, Delhi, and Pune.\n\n**PRC and the JKMIP Acts**\n\nIn response to the exodus of the Kashmiri Pandits, the Indian government established various relief schemes and programs to assist the displaced community. The Prime Minister's Relief Council (PRC) and the Jammu and Kashmir Migration Incentive Program (JKMIP) were established to provide financial assistance, housing, and employment to the displaced Pandits.\n\n**Socio-Political Organisations**\n\nThe Kashmiri Pandits have formed various socio-political organisations to represent their interests and advocate for their rights. The All India Kashmiri Samaj (AIKS) and the All India Kashmiri Pandit Conference are two prominent organisations that have been working to promote the welfare and interests of the Kashmiri Pandit community.\n\n**Population Distribution**\n\nAccording to the 1941 census, the Kashmiri Pandits constituted around 2.1% of the population of the Kashmir Valley. They were primarily concentrated in the districts of Anantnag and Baramulla.\n\n**Society and Culture**\n\nThe Kashmiri Pandits have a rich cultural heritage, with a strong tradition of music, dance, and art. They have a unique style of singing, known as Wanvun, which is an integral part of their religious ceremonies. The Pandits have also maintained a strong tradition of sun worship, with various shrines and temples dedicated to the sun god.\n\n**Religious Beliefs**\n\nThe Kashmiri Pandits are followers of Hinduism, with a strong tradition of Arya Samaj and Shaivite practices. They have a unique set of rituals and practices, which are influenced by the region's history and culture.\n\n**Pilgrimage Sites**\n\nThe Kashmiri Pandits have several important pilgrimage sites, including the Harmukh mountain, which is traditionally revered by the community. The Mata Kheerbhawani temple shrine in Srinagar is considered one of the holiest Hindu shrines in the valley.\n\n**Festivals**\n\nThe Kashmiri Pandits celebrate various festivals, including Shivratri (or Herath in the Kashmiri language), which is one of the major festivals of the community. The Pandits also celebrate the Navreh or the Kashmiri lunar new year, which is an important festival in the community.\n\n**Culture**\n\nThe Kashmiri Pandits have a unique style of dress, which includes the traditional tunic, known as the kanchuka. They also wear a type of turban, known as the shirahshata, and a type of girdle, known as the mekhalā. The Pandits have a rich tradition of music and dance, with various forms of traditional singing and music.\n\n**Diet**\n\nThe Kashmiri Pandits have a tradition of consuming meat, including mutton and fish.

he would rather immerse himself in art, such as painting and drawing, or playing the piano than attend to his studies In 1949, to instil discipline, his parents insisted he attend Jones' West Monmouth Boys' School in Pontypool He remained there for five terms and was then educated at Cowbridge Grammar School in the Vale of Glamorgan In an interview in 2002, he stated, \"I was a poor learner, which left me open to ridicule and gave me an inferiority complex I grew up absolutely convinced I was stupid.\" [11]\n\n\nCareer\nHopkins made his first professional stage appearance in the Palace Theatre, Swansea, in 1960 with Swansea Little Theatre's production of Have a Cigarette [15] In 1965, after several years in repertory, he was spotted by Laurence Olivier, who invited him to join the Royal National Theatre in London [14] Hopkins became Olivier's understudy, and filled in when Olivier was struck with appendicitis during a 1967 production of August Strindberg's The Dance of Death Olivier later noted in his memoir, Confessions of an Actor, that, \"A new young actor in the company of exceptional promise named Anthony Hopkins was understudying me and walked away with the part of Edgar like a cat with a mouse between its teeth.\" [16] Up until that night, Hopkins was always nervous prior to going on stage This has since changed, and Hopkins quoted his mentor as saying: \"He  [Olivier] said: 'Remember: \"nerves\" is vanity – you're wondering what people think of you; to hell with them, just jump off the edge' It was great advice.\" [7]\n\n\n1960s\nHopkins made his first professional stage appearance in the Palace Theatre, Swansea, in 1960 with Swansea Little Theatre's production of Have a Cigarette [15] In 1965, after several years in repertory, he was spotted by Laurence Olivier, who invited him to join the Royal National Theatre in London [14] Hopkins became Olivier's understudy, and filled in when Olivier was struck with appendicitis during a 1967 production of August Strindberg's The Dance of Death Olivier later noted in his memoir, Confessions of an Actor, that, \"A new young actor in the company of exceptional promise named Anthony Hopkins was understudying me and walked away with the part of Edgar like a cat with a mouse between its teeth.\" [16] Up until that night, Hopkins was always nervous prior to going on stage This has since changed, and Hopkins quoted his mentor as saying: \"He  [Olivier] said: 'Remember: \"nerves\" is vanity – you're wondering what people think of you;

this scene featured Laurence Olivier and Tony Curtis, with Hopkins recommended by Olivier's widow, Joan Plowright to perform her late husband's part thanks to his talent for mimicry [97]\n\n\nArtistry and reception\nHopkins is renowned for his preparation for roles He indicated in interviews that once he has committed to a project, he will go over his lines as many times as is needed (sometimes upwards of 200) until the lines sound natural to him, so that he can \"do it without thinking\" This leads to an almost casual style of delivery that belies the amount of groundwork done beforehand While it can allow for some careful improvisation, it has also brought him into conflict with the occasional director who departs from the script or demands what the actor views as an excessive number of takes Hopkins has stated that after he is finished with a scene, he simply discards the lines, not remembering them later on This is unlike others who usually remember their lines from a film, even years later [98]\n\n\nPersonal life\nHopkins resides in Malibu, California [103] He had moved to the United States once before, during the late 1970s, to pursue his film career, but returned to London in the late 1980s However, he decided to return to the US following his 1990s success Retaining his British citizenship, he became a naturalised American citizen on 12 April 2000, with Hopkins stating: \"I have dual citizenship;

[44] it was secured with two main conditions: no filming during the day and no damage from explosions [18]\n\n\nMusic\nBefore hiring composer Michael Kamen, McTiernan knew he wanted to include Beethoven's 9th Symphony (commonly known as \"Ode to Joy\"), having heard it in Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange (1971) [51] Kamen objected to \"tarnishing\" the piece in an action film and offered to misuse German composer Richard Wagner's music instead [51] [52] Once McTiernan explained how the 9th Symphony had been used in A Clockwork Orange to highlight the ultra-violence, Kamen had a better understanding of McTiernan's intentions [51] In exchange, Kamen insisted that they also license the use of \"Singin' in the Rain\" (1952) (also used in A Clockwork Orange) and \"Winter Wonderland\" (1934) [52] He mixed the melodies of \"Ode to Joy\", \"Winter Wonderland\", and \"Singin' in the Rain\" into his score, mainly to underscore the villains [50] [53] [52] The samples of \"Ode to Joy\" are played in slightly lower keys to sound more menacing; the references build to a performance of the symphony when Gruber finally accesses the Nakatomi vault [52] [54] The score also references \"Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!\" [55] [56] [53]\n\n\nStunts and designs\nThe perception of film stunts changed shortly before production of Die Hard following a fatal accident on the set of Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983), and a push was made to prioritize a film's crew over the film itself [59] Even so, Willis insisted on performing many of his own stunts, including rolling down steps and standing on top of an active elevator [12] [44] The first scene he shot was his leap from the top of Nakatomi Plaza with a firehose wrapped around his waist The stunt involved a 25-foot (7.6 m) leap from a five-story parking garage ledge onto an airbag as a 60-foot (18 m) wall of flame exploded behind him He considered it to be one of his toughest stunts [12] [27] The explosive force pushed him towards the edge of the airbag and the crew was concerned he had died [12] Stuntman Ken Bates stood in for Willis when his character is hanging from the building [60]\n\n\nStunts\nThe perception of film stunts changed

small film lights in high locations He controlled these to create more dynamic and dramatic lighting This gave him the opportunity to use unusual light positioning He also placed fluorescent tubes on the floor in one scene to indicate they had not been installed [44] The shifting nature of the filming script meant some sets were designed before it was known what they were to be used for [39]\n\n\nRelease\nThe summer of 1988 was expected by film industry executives to be dominated by action and comedy films, although a broader range of films were released that year [41] [65] More films targeted older audiences rather than teenagers, a reflection of the increasing age of the average audience member [65] Sequels to successful films, Crocodile Dundee II and Rambo III, were predicted to control the May box office and break opening weekend revenue records Industry executives also had high expectations for the comedies Coming to America and Who Framed Roger Rabbit

reputation as an \"arrogant\" actor concerned with his own fame His refusal to address this, or speak about his personal life to the media, had reinforced this perception For his part, Willis said that he wanted the media to focus on his acting [31] [67] There were reports that cinema audiences would moan at Willis's appearance in Die Hard trailers, and that a representative from an unnamed theater chain had pulled the trailer in response [66] Research by several film studios revealed that audiences had a negative opinion of Willis overall and little or no interest in seeing him in Die Hard [29] Newsweek's David Ansen called Willis \"the most unpopular actor ever to get $5 million for making a movie\" [17]\n\n\nBox office\nDie Hard's premiere took place on July 12, 1988, at the Avco theater in Los Angeles, California [68] In North America, the film received a limited release in 21 theaters in 13 cities on July 15, 1988, earning $601,851—an average of $28,659 per theater [69] It was considered a successful debut with a high per-theater average gross [70] The Los Angeles Times said that the late change in advertising focus and diminishing popularity for action films should have worked against Die Hard Instead, positive reviews and the limited release had made it a \"must-see\" film [71]\n\n\nReception\nInitial critical reviews of Die Hard were mixed [43] Audiences

John McTiernan and written by Jeb Stuart and Steven E. de Souza. The film stars Bruce Willis as John McClane, a detective who finds himself trapped in a skyscraper during a terrorist takeover. The film's success spawned a franchise with four sequels, and it has become a classic of the action genre. Die Hard has been recognized for its influence on popular culture and has been selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.\n\n## Plot\n\nOn Christmas Eve, New York City Police Department (NYPD) Detective John McClane arrives in Los Angeles, hoping to reconcile with his estranged wife, Holly, at a party held by her employer, the Nakatomi Corporation. He is driven to Nakatomi Plaza by a limo driver, Argyle, who offers to wait for McClane in the garage. While McClane washes himself, the tower is seized by the German radical Hans Gruber and his heavily armed team, including Karl and Theo. Everyone in the tower is taken hostage except for McClane, who slips away, and Argyle, who remains oblivious to events.\n\n## Cast\n\nThe cast of Die Hard includes Bruce Willis as John McClane, Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber, Bonnie Bedelia as Holly McClane, Reginald VelJohnson as Sergeant Al Powell, Paul Gleason as Deputy Chief Dwayne T. Robinson, and Hart Bochner as Harry Ellis. Other cast members include Gruber's henchmen: Bruno Doyon as Franco, Andreas Wisniewski as Tony, Joey Plewa as Alexander, Lorenzo Caccialanza as Marco, Gerard Bonn as Kristoff, Dennis Hayden as Eddie, Al Leong as Uli, Gary Roberts as Heinrich, Hans Buhringer as Fritz, and Wilhelm von Homburg as James. Robert Davi and Grand L. Bush appear as FBI Special Agents Big Johnson and Little Johnson, respectively. Tracy Reiner appears as Thornburg's assistant, and Taylor Fry and Noah Land make minor appearances as McClane's children Lucy McClane and John Jr.\n\n## Production\n\nThe development of Die Hard began in 1987, when screenwriter Jeb Stuart was in dire financial straits. His script was purchased by Columbia Pictures, but it was abandoned. Stuart had six weeks between contracted work, so his agent Jeremy Zimmer contacted Lloyd Levin, the head of development at the Gordon Company, a producing arm of 20th Century Fox. The film was produced on a budget of approximately $25-35 million.\n\n## Casting\n\nSylvester Stallone was offered the role of John McClane but declined. Bruce Willis was known mainly for his comedic role in the romantic comedy television series Moonlighting, and he declined the role because of his contractual obligations to the show. However, when Cybill Shepherd became pregnant, the show's production was stopped for eleven weeks, giving Willis enough time to take the role.\n\n## Music\n\nBefore hiring composer Michael Kamen, McTiernan knew he wanted to include Beethoven's 9th Symphony in the film. Kamen objected to \"tarnishing\" the piece in an action film and offered to misuse German composer Richard Wagner's music instead. Once McTiernan explained how the 9th Symphony had been used in Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange to highlight the ultra-violence, Kamen had a better understanding of McTiernan's intentions. In exchange, Kamen insisted that they also license the use of \"Singin' in the Rain\" and \"Winter Wonderland.\"\n\n## Stunts and Designs\n\nThe perception of film stunts changed shortly before production of Die Hard, following a fatal accident on the set of Twilight Zone: The Movie. Despite this, Bruce Willis insisted on performing many of his own stunts, including rolling down steps and standing on top of an active elevator. The first scene he shot was his leap from the top of Nakatomi Plaza with a firehose wrapped around his waist. The stunt involved a 25-foot leap from a five-story parking garage ledge onto an airbag as a 60-foot wall of flame exploded behind him.\n\n## Release\n\nThe summer of 1988 was expected to be dominated by action and comedy films. Die Hard premiered on July 12, 1988, at the Avco theater in Los Angeles, California. In North America, the film received a limited release in 21 theaters in 13 cities on July 15, 1988, earning $601,851—an average of $28,659 per theater.\n\n## Reception\n\nInitial critical reviews of Die Hard were mixed. However, audiences reacted more positively, and polls by the market research firm CinemaScore found that audiences gave it an average rating of \"A+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\n## Accolades\n\nAt the 1989 Academy Awards, Die Hard was nominated for Best Film Editing, Best Visual Effects, Best Sound Effects Editing, and Best Sound. Michael Kamen won a BMI TV/Film Music Award for his work on the score.\n\n## Post-Release\n\nDie Hard was released on Video Home System (VHS) cassette in January 1989. It was a popular rental, debuting as the third-most rented film on the early February rental charts, rising to number one the following week. It spent six of its first seven weeks in release at number one until it was replaced by A Fish Called Wanda at the end of March.\n\n## Legacy\n\nDie Hard has been described by critics as a story about obtaining redemption through violence. The film's influence on the action genre is undeniable, and it has become a classic of the genre. The film's success spawned a franchise with four sequels, and it has been recognized for its influence on popular culture.\n\n## Cultural Influence\n\nIn 2017, Die Hard was selected by the United States Library of Congress to be preserved in the National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" A floor used for filming became Ronald Reagan's office, and a giant mural depicting McClane's crawl through a Nakatomi Plaza vent was erected at the Fox Studio lot in Century City to celebrate the film's 25th anniversary in 2013.\n\n## Critical Reassessment\n\nDie Hard is now considered one of the greatest action films ever made. On the film's 30th-anniversary in 2018, The Hollywood Reporter wrote that Die Hard was easily one of the most influential films in the action genre, whose influence could still be seen in contemporary films.

[44] it was secured with two main conditions: no filming during the day and no damage from explosions [18]\n\n\nMusic\nBefore hiring composer Michael Kamen, McTiernan knew he wanted to include Beethoven's 9th Symphony (commonly known as \"Ode to Joy\"), having heard it in Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange (1971) [51] Kamen objected to \"tarnishing\" the piece in an action film and offered to misuse German composer Richard Wagner's music instead [51] [52] Once McTiernan explained how the 9th Symphony had been used in A Clockwork Orange to highlight the ultra-violence, Kamen had a better understanding of McTiernan's intentions [51] In exchange, Kamen insisted that they also license the use of \"Singin' in the Rain\" (1952) (also used in A Clockwork Orange) and \"Winter Wonderland\" (1934) [52] He mixed the melodies of \"Ode to Joy\", \"Winter Wonderland\", and \"Singin' in the Rain\" into his score, mainly to underscore the villains [50] [53] [52] The samples of \"Ode to Joy\" are played in slightly lower keys to sound more menacing; the references build to a performance of the symphony when Gruber finally accesses the Nakatomi vault [52] [54] The score also references \"Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!\" [55] [56] [53]\n\n\nStunts and designs\nThe perception of film stunts changed shortly before production of Die Hard following a fatal accident on the set of Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983), and a push was made to prioritize a film's crew over the film itself [59] Even so, Willis insisted on performing many of his own stunts, including rolling down steps and standing on top of an active elevator [12] [44] The first scene he shot was his leap from the top of Nakatomi Plaza with a firehose wrapped around his waist The stunt involved a 25-foot (7.6 m) leap from a five-story parking garage ledge onto an airbag as a 60-foot (18 m) wall of flame exploded behind him He considered it to be one of his toughest stunts [12] [27] The explosive force pushed him towards the edge of

small film lights in high locations He controlled these to create more dynamic and dramatic lighting This gave him the opportunity to use unusual light positioning He also placed fluorescent tubes on the floor in one scene to indicate they had not been installed [44] The shifting nature of the filming script meant some sets were designed before it was known what they were to be used for [39]\n\n\nRelease\nThe summer of 1988 was expected by film industry executives to be dominated by action and comedy films, although a broader range of films were released that year [41] [65] More films targeted older audiences rather than teenagers, a reflection of the increasing age of the average audience member [65] Sequels to successful films, Crocodile Dundee II and Rambo III, were

reputation as an \"arrogant\" actor concerned with his own fame His refusal to address this, or speak about his personal life to the media, had reinforced this perception For his part, Willis said that he wanted the media to focus on his acting [31] [67] There were reports that cinema audiences would moan at Willis's appearance in Die Hard trailers, and that a representative from an unnamed theater chain had pulled the trailer in response [66] Research by several film studios revealed that audiences had a negative opinion of Willis overall and little or no interest in seeing him in Die Hard [29] Newsweek's David Ansen called Willis \"the most unpopular actor ever to get $5 million for making a movie\" [17]\n\n\nBox office\nDie Hard's premiere took place on July 12, 1988, at the Avco

{"title": "Fascism", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe Italian term fascismo is derived from fascio, meaning 'bundle of sticks', ultimately from the Latin word fasces [3] This was the name given to political organizations in Italy known as fasci, groups similar to guilds or syndicates According to Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini's own account, the Fasces of Revolutionary Action were founded in Italy in 1915 [21] In 1919, Mussolini founded the Italian Fasces of Combat in Milan, which became the National Fascist Party two years later The fascists came to associate the term with the ancient Roman fasces or fascio littorio, [22] a bundle of rods tied around an axe, [23] an ancient Roman symbol of the authority of the civic magistrate, [24] carried by his lictors [25] The symbolism of the fasces suggested strength through unity: a single rod is easily broken, while the bundle is difficult to break [26] Similar symbols were developed by different fascist movements; for example, the symbol of Falangism is five arrows joined by a yoke [27]\n\n\nDefinitions\nHistorian Ian Kershaw once wrote that \"trying to define 'fascism' is like trying to nail jelly to the wall.\" [28] Each group described as \"fascist\" has at least some unique elements, and frequently definitions of \"fascism\" have been criticized as either too broad or too narrow [29] According to many scholars, fascists—especially when they're in power—have historically attacked communism, conservatism, and parliamentary liberalism, attracting support primarily from the far-right [30]\n\n\nPosition on the political spectrum\nScholars place fascism on the far right of the political spectrum [6] [5] [7] Such scholarship focuses on its social conservatism and its authoritarian means of opposing egalitarianism [63] Roderick Stackelberg places fascism—including Nazism, which he says is \"a radical variant of fascism\"—on the political right by explaining: \"The more a person deems absolute equality among all people to be a desirable condition, the further left he or she will be on the ideological spectrum The more a person considers inequality to be unavoidable or even desirable, the further to the right he or she will be.\" [64]\n\n\nFascist as a pejorative\nThe term fascist has been used as a pejorative, [75] regarding varying movements across the far right of the political spectrum George Orwell noted in 1944 that the term had been used to denigrate diverse positions \"in internal politics\" Orwell said that while fascism is \"a political and economic system\" that was inconvenient to define, \"as used, the word 'Fascism' is almost entirely meaningless .. almost any English person would accept 'bully' as a synonym for 'Fascist'\", [76] and in 1946 wrote that \"'Fascism' has now no meaning except in so far as it signifies something not desirable.\" [77] Richard Griffiths of the University of Wales wrote in 2000 that \"fascism\" is the \"most misused, and over-used word, of our times\" [78]: 1  Fascist is sometimes applied to post-World War II organizations and ways of thinking that academics more commonly term neo-fascist [79]\n\n\nHistory\nEarly influences that shaped the ideology of fascism have been dated back to ancient Greece The political culture of ancient Greece and specifically the ancient Greek city state of Sparta under Lycurgus, with its emphasis on militarism and racial purity, were admired by the Nazis [85] [86] Nazi Führer Adolf Hitler emphasized that Germany should adhere to Hellenic values and culture – particularly that of ancient Sparta [85]\n\n\nBackground and 19th-century roots\nEarly influences that shaped the ideology of fascism have been dated back to ancient Greece The political culture of ancient Greece and specifically the ancient Greek city state of Sparta under Lycurgus, with its emphasis on militarism and racial purity, were admired by the Nazis [85] [86] Nazi Führer Adolf Hitler emphasized that Germany should adhere to Hellenic values and culture – particularly that of ancient Sparta [85]\n\n\nFin de siècle era and fusion of Maurrasism with Sorelianism (1880–1914)\nThe historian Zeev Sternhell has traced the ideological roots of fascism back to the 1880s and in particular to the fin de siècle theme of that time [96] The theme was based on a revolt against materialism, rationalism, positivism, bourgeois society, and democracy [97] The fin-de-siècle generation supported emotionalism, irrationalism, subjectivism, and vitalism [98] They regarded civilization as being in crisis, requiring a massive and total solution [97] Their intellectual school considered the individual as only one part of the larger collectivity, which should not be viewed as a numerical sum of atomized individuals [97] They condemned the rationalistic, liberal individualism of society and the dissolution of social links in bourgeois society [97]\n\n\nFascist syndicalism\nFrench revolutionary syndicalist Georges Sorel promoted the legitimacy of political violence in his work Reflections on Violence (1908) and other works in which he advocated radical syndicalist action to achieve a revolution to overthrow capitalism and the bourgeoisie through a general strike [106] In Reflections on Violence, Sorel emphasized need for a revolutionary political religion [107] Also in his work The Illusions of Progress, Sorel denounced democracy as reactionary, saying \"nothing is more aristocratic than democracy.\" [108] By 1909, after the failure of a syndicalist general strike in France, Sorel and his supporters left the radical left and went to the radical right, where they sought to merge militant Catholicism and French patriotism with their views—advocating anti-republican Christian French patriots as ideal revolutionaries [109] Initially, Sorel had officially been a revisionist of Marxism, but by 1910 announced his abandonment of socialist literature and claimed in 1914, using an aphorism of Benedetto Croce that \"socialism is dead\" because of the \"decomposition of Marxism\" [110] Sorel became a supporter of reactionary Maurrassian nationalism beginning in 1909 that influenced his works [110] Maurras held interest in merging his nationalist ideals with Sorelian syndicalism, known as Sorelianism, as a means to confront democracy [111] Maurras stated that \"a socialism liberated from the democratic and cosmopolitan element fits nationalism well as a well made glove fits a beautiful hand.\" [112]\n\n\nWorld War I and its aftermath (1914–1929)\nAt the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the Italian political left became severely split over its position on the war The Italian Socialist Party (PSI) opposed the war but a number of Italian revolutionary syndicalists supported war against Germany and Austria-Hungary on the grounds that their reactionary regimes had to be defeated to ensure the success of socialism [121] Angelo Oliviero Olivetti formed a pro-interventionist fascio called the Revolutionary Fasces of International Action in October 1914 [121] Benito Mussolini upon being expelled from his position as chief editor of the PSI's newspaper Avanti! for his anti-German stance, joined the interventionist cause in a separate fascio [122] The term \"fascism\" was first used in 1915 by members of Mussolini's movement, the Fasces of Revolutionary Action [123]\n\n\nImpact of World War I\nFascists viewed World War I as bringing revolutionary changes in the nature of war, society, the state and technology, as the advent of total war and mass mobilization had broken down the distinction between civilian and combatant, as civilians had become a critical part in economic production for the war effort and thus arose a \"military citizenship\" in which all citizens were involved to the military in some manner during the war [10] World War I had resulted in the rise of a powerful state capable of mobilizing millions of people to serve on the front lines or provide economic production and logistics to support those on the front lines, as well as having unprecedented authority to intervene in the lives of citizens [10] Fascists viewed technological developments of weaponry and the state's total mobilization of its population in the war as symbolizing the beginning of a new era fusing state power with mass politics, technology and particularly the mobilizing myth that they contended had triumphed over the myth of progress and the era of liberalism [129]\n\n\nImpact of the Bolshevik Revolution\nThe October Revolution of 1917, in which Bolshevik communists led by Vladimir Lenin seized power in Russia, greatly influenced the development of fascism [132] Leon Trotsky would later formulate a theory of fascism based on a dialectical interpretation of events to analyze the manifestation of Italian fascism and the early emergence of Nazi Germany from 1930 to 1933 [133] In 1917, Mussolini, as leader of the Fasces of Revolutionary Action, praised the October Revolution, but later he became unimpressed with Lenin, regarding him as merely a new version of Tsar Nicholas II [134] After World War I, fascists commonly campaigned on anti-Marxist agendas [132]\n\n\nFascist Manifesto and Charter of Carnaro\nIn 1919, Alceste De Ambris and futurist movement leader Filippo Tommaso Marinetti created \"The Manifesto of the Italian Fasces of Combat\" [136] The Fascist Manifesto was presented on 6 June 1919 in the fascist newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia and supported the creation of universal suffrage, including women's suffrage (the latter being realized only partly in late 1925, with all opposition parties banned or disbanded); [137] proportional representation on a regional basis; government representation through a corporatist system of \"National Councils\" of experts, selected from professionals and tradespeople, elected to represent and hold legislative power over their respective areas, including labour, industry, transportation, public health, and communications, among others; and abolition of the Senate of the Kingdom of Italy [138] The Fascist Manifesto supported the creation of an eight-hour work day for all workers, a minimum wage, worker representation in industrial management, equal confidence in labour unions as in industrial executives and public servants, reorganization of the transportation sector, revision of the draft law on invalidity insurance, reduction of the retirement age from 65 to 55, a strong progressive tax on capital, confiscation of the property of religious institutions and abolishment of bishoprics, and revision of military contracts to allow the government to seize 85% of profits [139] It also called for the fulfillment of expansionist aims in the Balkans and other parts of the Mediterranean, the creation of a short-service national militia to serve defensive duties, nationalization of the armaments industry, and a foreign policy designed to be peaceful but also competitive [140]\n\n\nFrom populism to conservative accommodations\nIn 1920, militant strike activity by industrial workers reached its peak in Italy and 1919 and 1920 were known as the \"Red Year\" (Biennio Rosso) [144] Mussolini and the fascists took advantage of the situation by allying with industrial businesses and attacking workers and peasants in the name of preserving order and internal peace in Italy [145]\n\n\nFascist violence\nBeginning in 1922, fascist paramilitaries escalated their strategy from one of attacking socialist offices and the homes of socialist leadership figures, to one of violent occupation of cities The fascists met little serious resistance from authorities and proceeded to take over several northern Italian cities [154] The fascists attacked the headquarters of socialist and Catholic labour unions in Cremona and imposed forced Italianization upon the German-speaking population of Bolzano [154] [155] After seizing these cities, the fascists made plans to take Rome [154]\n\n\nFascist Italy\nHistorian Stanley G Payne says:\n\n\nMussolini in power\nUpon being appointed Prime Minister of Italy, Mussolini had to form a coalition government because the fascists did not have control over the Italian parliament [159] Mussolini's coalition government initially pursued economically liberal policies under the direction of liberal finance minister Alberto De Stefani, a member of the Center Party, including balancing the budget through deep cuts to the civil service [159] Initially, little drastic change in government policy had occurred and repressive police actions were limited [159]\n\n\nCatholic Church\nIn 1929, the fascist regime briefly gained what was in effect a blessing of the Catholic Church after the regime signed a concordat with the Church, known as the Lateran Treaty, which gave the papacy state sovereignty and financial compensation for the seizure of Church lands by the liberal state in the 19th century, but within two years the Church had renounced fascism in the Encyclical Non Abbiamo Bisogno as a \"pagan idolatry of the state\" which teaches \"hatred, violence and irreverence\" [163] Not long after signing the agreement, by Mussolini's own confession, the Church had threatened to have him \"excommunicated\", in part because of his intractable nature, but also because he had \"confiscated more issues of Catholic newspapers in the next three months than in the previous seven years.\" [164] By the late 1930s, Mussolini became more vocal in his anti-clerical rhetoric, repeatedly denouncing the Catholic Church and discussing ways to depose the pope He took the position that the \"papacy was a malignant tumor in the body of Italy and must 'be rooted out once and for all,' because there was no room in Rome for both the Pope and himself.\" [165] In her 1974 book, Mussolini's widow Rachele stated that her husband had always been an atheist until near the end of his life, writing that her husband was \"basically irreligious until the later years of his life.\" [166]\n\n\nCorporatist economic system\nThe fascist regime created a corporatist economic system in 1925 with creation of the Palazzo Vidoni Pact, in which the Italian employers' association Confindustria and fascist trade unions agreed to recognize each other as the sole representatives of Italy's employers and employees, excluding non-fascist trade unions [170] The Fascist regime first created a Ministry of Corporations that organized the Italian economy into 22 sectoral corporations, banned workers' strikes and lock-outs and in 1927 created the Charter of Labour, which established workers' rights and duties and created labour tribunals to arbitrate employer-employee disputes [170] In practice, the sectoral corporations exercised little independence and were largely controlled by the regime, and the employee organizations were rarely led by employees themselves, but instead by appointed Fascist party members [170]\n\n\nAggressive foreign policy\nIn the 1920s, Fascist Italy pursued an aggressive foreign policy that included ambitions to expand Italian territory [171] In response to revolt in the Italian colony of Libya, Fascist Italy abandoned previous liberal-era colonial policy of cooperation with local leaders Instead, claiming that Italians were a superior race to African races and thereby had the right to colonize the \"inferior\" Africans, it sought to settle 10 to 15 million Italians in Libya [172] This resulted in an aggressive military campaign known as the Pacification of Libya against natives in Libya, including mass killings, the use of concentration camps and the forced starvation of thousands of people [172] Italian authorities committed ethnic cleansing by forcibly expelling 100,000 Bedouin Cyrenaicans, half the population of Cyrenaica in Libya, from their settlements that was slated to be given to Italian settlers [173]\n\n\nNazi adoption of the Italian model\nThe March on Rome brought fascism international attention One early admirer of the Italian fascists was Adolf Hitler, who less than a month after the March had begun to model himself and the Nazi Party upon Mussolini and the Fascists [174] The Nazis, led by Hitler and the German war hero Erich Ludendorff, attempted a \"March on Berlin\" modeled upon the March on Rome, which resulted in the failed Beer Hall Putsch in Munich in November 1923 [175]\n\n\nInternational impact of the Great Depression and buildup to World War II\nThe conditions of economic hardship caused by the Great Depression brought about an international surge of social unrest [176] Fascist propaganda blamed the problems of the long depression of the 1930s on minorities and scapegoats: \"Judeo-Masonic-bolshevik\" conspiracies, left-wing internationalism and the presence of immigrants [177]\n\n\nWorld War II (1939–1945)\nIn Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, both Mussolini and Hitler pursued territorial expansionist and interventionist foreign policy agendas from the 1930s through the 1940s culminating in World War II From 1935 to 1939, Germany and Italy escalated their demands for territorial claims and greater influence in world affairs Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935 resulting in its condemnation by the League of Nations and its widespread diplomatic isolation In 1936, Germany remilitarized the industrial Rhineland, a region that had been ordered demilitarized by the Treaty of Versailles In 1938, Germany annexed Austria and Italy assisted Germany in resolving the diplomatic crisis between Germany versus Britain and France over claims on Czechoslovakia by arranging the Munich Agreement that gave Germany the Sudetenland and was perceived at the time to have averted a European war These hopes faded when Czechoslovakia was dissolved by the proclamation of the German client state of Slovakia, followed by the next day of the occupation of the remaining Czech Lands and the proclamation of the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia At the same time from 1938 to 1939, Italy was demanding territorial and colonial concessions from France and Britain [195] In 1939, Germany prepared for war with Poland, but attempted to gain territorial concessions from Poland through diplomatic means [196] The Polish government did not trust Hitler's promises and refused to accept Germany's demands [196]\n\n\nPost-World War II (1945–2008)\nThe victory of the Allies over the Axis powers in World War II led to the collapse of many fascist regimes in Europe The Nuremberg Trials convicted several Nazi leaders of crimes against humanity involving the Holocaust However, there remained several movements and governments that were ideologically related to fascism [201] [202]\n\n\nContemporary fascism (2008–present)\nAfter the onset of the Great Recession and economic crisis in Greece, a movement known as the Golden Dawn, widely considered a neo-Nazi party, soared in support out of obscurity and won seats in Greece's parliament, espousing a staunch hostility towards minorities, illegal immigrants and refugees In 2013, after the murder of an anti-fascist musician by a person with links to Golden Dawn, the Greek government ordered the arrest of Golden Dawn's leader Nikolaos Michaloliakos and other members on charges related to being associated with a criminal organization [215] [216] On 7 October 2020, Athens Appeals Court announced verdicts for 68 defendants, including the party's political leadership Nikolaos Michaloliakos and six other prominent members and former members of parliament (MPs) were found guilty of running a criminal organization [217] Guilty verdicts were delivered on charges of murder, attempted murder, and violent attacks on immigrants and left-wing political opponents [218]\n\n\nGreece\nAfter the onset of the Great Recession and economic crisis in Greece, a movement known as the

charges of murder, attempted murder, and violent attacks on immigrants and left-wing political opponents [218]\n\n\nPost-Soviet Russia\nMarlene Laruelle, a French political scientist, contends in Is Russia Fascist? that the accusation of \"fascist\" has evolved into a strategic narrative of the existing world order Geopolitical rivals might construct their own view of the world and assert the moral high ground by branding ideological rivals as fascists, regardless of their real ideals or deeds Laruelle discusses the basis, significance, and veracity of accusations of fascism in and around Russia through an analysis of the domestic situation in Russia and the Kremlin's foreign policy justifications; she concludes that Russian efforts to brand its opponents as fascist is ultimately an attempt to determine the future of Russia in Europe as an antifascist force, influenced by its role in fighting fascism in World War II [219]\n\n\nTenets\nRobert O Paxton finds that even though fascism \"maintained the existing regime of property and social hierarchy\", it cannot be considered \"simply a more muscular form of conservatism\" because \"fascism in power did carry out some changes profound enough to be called 'revolutionary.'\" [228] These transformations \"often set fascists into conflict with conservatives rooted in families, churches, social rank, and property.\" Paxton argues:\n\n\nNationalism with or without expansionism\nUltranationalism, combined with the myth of national rebirth, is a key foundation of fascism [229] Robert Paxton argues that \"a passionate nationalism\" is the basis of fascism, combined with \"a conspiratorial and Manichean view of history\" which holds that \"the chosen people have been weakened by political parties, social classes, unassimilable minorities, spoiled rentiers, and rationalist thinkers.\" [230] Roger Griffin identifies the core of fascism as being palingenetic ultranationalism [42]\n\n\nTotalitarianism\nFascism promotes the establishment of a totalitarian state [13] It opposes liberal democracy, rejects multi-party systems, and may support a one-party state so that it may synthesize with the nation [14] Mussolini's The Doctrine of Fascism (1932), partly ghostwritten by philosopher Giovanni Gentile, [235] who Mussolini described as \"the philosopher of Fascism\", states: \"The Fascist conception of the State is all-embracing; outside of it no human or spiritual values can exist, much less have value Thus understood, Fascism is totalitarian, and the Fascist State—a synthesis and a unit inclusive of all values—interprets, develops, and potentiates the whole life of a people.\" [236] In The Legal Basis of the Total State, Nazi political theorist Carl Schmitt described the Nazi intention to form a \"strong state which guarantees a totality of political unity transcending all diversity\" in order to avoid a \"disastrous pluralism tearing the German people apart.\" [237]\n\n\nEconomy\nHistorians and other scholars disagree on the question of whether a specifically fascist type of economic policy can be said to exist David Baker argues that there is an identifiable economic system in fascism that is distinct from those advocated by other ideologies, comprising essential characteristics that fascist nations shared [240] Payne, Paxton, Sternhell et al argue that while fascist economies share some similarities, there is no distinctive form of fascist economic organization [241] [242] [243] Gerald Feldman and Timothy Mason argue that fascism is distinguished by an absence of coherent economic ideology and an absence of serious economic thinking They state that the decisions taken by fascist leaders cannot be explained within a logical economic framework [244]\n\n\nDirect action\nFascism emphasizes direct action, including supporting the legitimacy of political violence, as a core part of its politics [273] Fascism views violent action as a necessity in politics that fascism identifies as being an \"endless struggle\"; [274] this emphasis on the use of political violence means that most fascist parties have also created their own private militias (e.g the Nazi Party's Brown shirts and Fascist Italy's Blackshirts) The basis of fascism's support of violent action in politics is connected to social Darwinism [274] Fascist movements have commonly held social Darwinist views of nations, races and societies [275] They say that nations and races must purge themselves of socially and biologically weak or degenerate people, while simultaneously promoting the creation of strong people, in order to survive in a world defined by perpetual national and racial conflict [276]\n\n\nAge and gender roles\nFascism emphasizes youth both in a physical sense of age and in a spiritual sense as related to virility and commitment to action [277] The Italian Fascists' political anthem was called Giovinezza (\"The Youth\") [277] Fascism identifies the physical age period of youth as a critical time for the moral development of people who will affect society [278] Walter Laqueur argues that \" [t]he corollaries of the cult of war and physical danger were the cult of brutality, strength, and sexuality ..  [fascism is] a true counter-civilization: rejecting the sophisticated rationalist humanism of Old Europe, fascism sets up as its ideal the primitive instincts and primal emotions of the barbarian.\" [279]\n\n\nPalingenesis and modernism\nFascism emphasizes both palingenesis (national rebirth or re-creation) and modernism [295] In particular, fascism's nationalism has been identified as having a palingenetic character [296] Fascism promotes the regeneration of the nation and purging it of decadence [295] Fascism accepts forms of modernism that it deems promotes national regeneration while rejecting forms of modernism that are regarded as antithetical to national regeneration [297] Fascism aestheticized modern technology and its association with speed, power and violence [298] Fascism admired advances in the economy in the early 20th century, particularly Fordism and scientific management [299] Fascist modernism has been recognized as inspired or developed by various figures—such as Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Ernst Jünger, Gottfried Benn, Louis-Ferdinand Céline, Knut Hamsun, Ezra Pound and Wyndham Lewis [300]\n\n\nCulture\nIn The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction (1935), Walter Benjamin identifies aestheticization of politics as a key ingredient in fascist regimes [303] On this point he quotes Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, founder of the Futurist art movement and co-author of the Fascist Manifesto (1919), who aestheticizes war in his writings and claims that \"war is beautiful.\" [304]\n\n\nAesthetics\nIn The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction (1935), Walter Benjamin identifies aestheticization of politics as a key ingredient in fascist regimes [303] On this point he quotes Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, founder of the Futurist art movement and co-author of the Fascist Manifesto (1919), who aestheticizes war in his writings and claims that \"war is beautiful.\" [304]\n\n\nPopular culture\nIn Italy, the Mussolini regime created the Direzione Generale per la Cinematografi to encourage film studios to glorify fascism Italian cinema flourished because the regime stopped the import of Hollywood films in 1938, subsidized domestic production, and kept ticket prices low It encouraged international distribution to glorify its African empire and to belie the charge that Italy was backward [308] The regime censored criticism and used the state-run Luce Institute film company to laud the Duce through newsreels, documentaries, and photographs [309] The regime promoted Italian opera and theatre as well, making sure that political enemies did not have a voice on stage [310]\n\n\nCriticism\nFascist parties were closely contested by anti-fascist movements from the political centre and left wing throughout the Interwar period The defeat of the Axis powers in World War II and subsequent revelation of the crimes against humanity committed during the Holocaust by Germany have led to an almost universal condemnation of both past and present forms of fascism in the modern era \"Fascism\" is today used across the political spectrum as a pejorative or byword for perceived authoritarianism and other forms of political evil.\n\n\nAnti-democratic and tyrannical\nOne of the most common and strongest criticisms of fascism is that it is a tyranny [313] Fascism is deliberately and entirely non-democratic and anti-democratic [314]\n\n\nUnprincipled opportunism\n\nSome critics of Italian fascism have said that much of the ideology was merely a by-product of unprincipled opportunism by Mussolini and that he changed his political stances merely to bolster his personal ambitions while he disguised them as being purposeful to the public [316] Richard Washburn Child, the American ambassador to Italy who worked with Mussolini and became his friend and admirer, defended Mussolini's opportunistic behaviour by writing: \n\nIdeological dishonesty\nFascism has been criticized for being ideologically dishonest Major examples of ideological dishonesty have been identified in Italian fascism's changing relationship with German Nazism [326] Fascist Italy's official foreign policy positions commonly used rhetorical ideological hyperbole to justify its actions, although during Dino Grandi's tenure as Italy's foreign minister the country engaged in realpolitik free of such fascist hyperbole [327] Italian fascism's stance towards German Nazism fluctuated from support from the late 1920s to 1934, when it celebrated Hitler's rise to power and Mussolini's first meeting with Hitler in 1934; to opposition from 1934 to 1936 after the assassination of Italy's allied leader in Austria, Engelbert Dollfuss, by Austrian Nazis; and again back to support after 1936, when Germany was the only significant power that did not denounce Italy's invasion and occupation of Ethiopia.\n\n\nAnti-fascism\nAnti-fascism is a political movement in opposition to fascist ideologies, groups and individuals Beginning in European countries in the 1920s, it was at its most significant shortly before and during World War II, where the Axis powers were opposed by many countries forming the Allies of World War II and dozens of resistance movements worldwide Anti-fascism has been an element of movements across the political spectrum and holding many different political positions such as anarchism, communism, pacifism, republicanism, social democracy, socialism and syndicalism as well as centrist, conservative, liberal and nationalist viewpoints.\n\n\nSee also\nFinal solution\n\n\nReferences\nFinal solution\n\n\nBibliography\nFinal solution\n\n\nPrimary sources\nFinal solution\n\n\nSecondary sources\nFinal solution\n\n\nTertiary sources\nFinal solution\n\n\nFurther reading\nFinal solution\n\n\nExternal links\nFinal solution\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "# Fascism\n\n## Etymology\n\nThe Italian term fascismo is derived from fascio, meaning 'bundle of sticks', ultimately from the Latin word fasces. This was the name given to political organizations in Italy known as fasci, groups similar to guilds or syndicates. According to Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini's own account, the Fasces of Revolutionary Action were founded in Italy in 1915. In 1919, Mussolini founded the Italian Fasces of Combat in Milan, which became the National Fascist Party two years later. The fascists came to associate the term with the ancient Roman fasces or fascio littorio, a bundle of rods tied around an axe, an ancient Roman symbol of the authority of the civic magistrate, carried by his lictors. The symbolism of the fasces suggested strength through unity: a single rod is easily broken, while the bundle is difficult to break.\n\n## Definitions\n\nHistorian Ian Kershaw once wrote that \"trying to define 'fascism' is like trying to nail jelly to the wall.\" Each group described as \"fascist\" has at least some unique elements, and frequently definitions of \"fascism\" have been criticized as either too broad or too narrow. According to many scholars, fascists—especially when they're in power—have historically attacked communism, conservatism, and parliamentary liberalism, attracting support primarily from the far-right.\n\n## Position on the political spectrum\n\nScholars place fascism on the far right of the political spectrum. Such scholarship focuses on its social conservatism and its authoritarian means of opposing egalitarianism. Roderick Stackelberg places fascism—including Nazism, which he says is \"a radical variant of fascism\"—on the political right by explaining: \"The more a person deems absolute equality among all people to be a desirable condition, the further left he or she will be on the ideological spectrum. The more a person considers inequality to be unavoidable or even desirable, the further to the right he or she will be.\"\n\n## Fascist as a pejorative\n\nThe term fascist has been used as a pejorative, regarding varying movements across the far right of the political spectrum. George Orwell noted in 1944 that the term had been used to denigrate diverse positions \"in internal politics.\" Orwell said that while fascism is \"a political and economic system\" that was inconvenient to define, \"as used, the word 'Fascism' is almost entirely meaningless .. almost any English person would accept 'bully' as a synonym for 'Fascist',\" and in 1946 wrote that \"'Fascism' has now no meaning except in so far as it signifies something not desirable.\" Richard Griffiths of the University of Wales wrote in 2000 that \"fascism\" is the \"most misused, and over-used word, of our times.\"\n\n## History\n\nEarly influences that shaped the ideology of fascism have been dated back to ancient Greece. The political culture of ancient Greece and specifically the ancient Greek city state of Sparta under Lycurgus, with its emphasis on militarism and racial purity, were admired by the Nazis. Nazi Führer Adolf Hitler emphasized that Germany should adhere to Hellenic values and culture – particularly that of ancient Sparta.\n\n## Background and 19th-century roots\n\nThe historian Zeev Sternhell has traced the ideological roots of fascism back to the 1880s and in particular to the fin de siècle theme of that time. The theme was based on a revolt against materialism, rationalism, positivism, bourgeois society, and democracy. The fin-de-siècle generation supported emotionalism, irrationalism, subjectivism, and vitalism. They regarded civilization as being in crisis, requiring a massive and total solution. Their intellectual school considered the individual as only one part of the larger collectivity, which should not be viewed as a numerical sum of atomized individuals. They condemned the rationalistic, liberal individualism of society and the dissolution of social links in bourgeois society.\n\n## Fascist syndicalism\n\nFrench revolutionary syndicalist Georges Sorel promoted the legitimacy of political violence in his work Reflections on Violence (1908) and other works in which he advocated radical syndicalist action to achieve a revolution to overthrow capitalism and the bourgeoisie through a general strike. In Reflections on Violence, Sorel emphasized the need for a revolutionary political religion. Also in his work The Illusions of Progress, Sorel denounced democracy as reactionary, saying \"nothing is more aristocratic than democracy.\" By 1909, after the failure of a syndicalist general strike in France, Sorel and his supporters left the radical left and went to the radical right, where they sought to merge militant Catholicism and French patriotism with their views—advocating anti-republican Christian French patriots as ideal revolutionaries.\n\n## World War I and its aftermath (1914–1929)\n\nAt the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the Italian political left became severely split over its position on the war. The Italian Socialist Party (PSI) opposed the war but a number of Italian revolutionary syndicalists supported war against Germany and Austria-Hungary on the grounds that their reactionary regimes had to be defeated to ensure the success of socialism. Angelo Oliviero Olivetti formed a pro-interventionist fascio called the Revolutionary Fasces of International Action in October 1914. Benito Mussolini upon being expelled from his position as chief editor of the PSI's newspaper Avanti! for his anti-German stance, joined the interventionist cause in a separate fascio.\n\n## Fascist Manifesto and Charter of Carnaro\n\nIn 1919, Alceste De Ambris and futurist movement leader Filippo Tommaso Marinetti created \"The Manifesto of the Italian Fasces of Combat.\" The Fascist Manifesto was presented on 6 June 1919 in the fascist newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia and supported the creation of universal suffrage, including women's suffrage (the latter being realized only partly in late 1925, with all opposition parties banned or disbanded); proportional representation on a regional basis; government representation through a corporatist system of \"National Councils\" of experts, selected from professionals and tradespeople, elected to represent and hold legislative power over their respective areas, including labour, industry, transportation, public health, and communications, among others; and abolition of the Senate of the Kingdom of Italy.\n\n## From populism to conservative accommodations\n\nIn 1920, militant strike activity by industrial workers reached its peak in Italy and 1919 and 1920 were known as the \"Red Year\" (Biennio Rosso). Mussolini and the fascists took advantage of the situation by allying with industrial businesses and attacking workers and peasants in the name of preserving order and internal peace in Italy.\n\n## Post-World War II (1945–2008)\n\nThe victory of the Allies over the Axis powers in World War II led to the collapse of many fascist regimes in Europe. The Nuremberg Trials convicted several Nazi leaders of crimes against humanity involving the Holocaust. However, there remained several movements and governments that were ideologically related to fascism.\n\n## Contemporary fascism (2008–present)\n\nAfter the onset of the Great Recession and economic crisis in Greece, a movement known as the Golden Dawn, widely considered a neo-Nazi party, soared in support out of obscurity and won seats in Greece's parliament, espousing a staunch hostility towards minorities, illegal immigrants and refugees. In 2013, after the murder of an anti-fascist musician by a person with links to Golden Dawn, the Greek government ordered the arrest of Golden Dawn's leader Nikolaos Michaloliakos and other members on charges related to being associated with a criminal organization.\n\n## Tenets\n\nRobert O Paxton finds that even though fascism \"maintained the existing regime of property and social hierarchy\", it cannot be considered \"simply a more muscular form of conservatism\" because \"fascism in power did carry out some changes profound enough to be called 'revolutionary.'\" These transformations \"often set fascists into conflict with conservatives rooted in families, churches, social rank, and property.\" Paxton argues that fascism is characterized by a number of distinct tenets, including:\n\n## Nationalism with or without expansionism\n\nUltranationalism, combined with the myth of national rebirth, is a key foundation of fascism. Robert Paxton argues that \"a passionate nationalism\" is the basis of fascism, combined with \"a conspiratorial and Manichean view of history\" which holds that \"the chosen people have been weakened by political parties, social classes, unassimilable minorities, spoiled rentiers, and rationalist thinkers.\"\n\n## Totalitarianism\n\nFascism promotes the establishment of a totalitarian state. It opposes liberal democracy, rejects multi-party systems, and may support a one-party state so that it may synthesize with the nation. Mussolini's The Doctrine of Fascism (1932), partly ghostwritten by philosopher Giovanni Gentile, states: \"The Fascist conception of the State is all-embracing; outside of it no human or spiritual values can exist, much less have value Thus understood, Fascism is totalitarian, and the Fascist State—a synthesis and a unit inclusive of all values—interprets, develops, and potentiates the whole life of a people.\"\n\n## Economy\n\nHistorians and other scholars disagree on the question of whether a specifically fascist type of economic policy can be said to exist. David Baker argues that there is an identifiable economic system in fascism that is distinct from those advocated by other ideologies, comprising essential characteristics that fascist nations shared. Payne, Paxton, Sternhell et al argue that while fascist economies share some similarities, there is no distinctive form of fascist economic organization.\n\n## Direct action\n\nFascism emphasizes direct action, including supporting the legitimacy of political violence, as a core part of its politics. Fascism views violent action as a necessity in politics that fascism identifies as being an \"endless struggle\"; this emphasis on the use of political violence means that most fascist parties have also created their own private militias (e.g the Nazi Party's Brown shirts and Fascist Italy's Blackshirts).\n\n## Age and gender roles\n\nFascism emphasizes youth both in a physical sense of age and in a spiritual sense as related to virility and commitment to action. The Italian Fascists' political anthem was called Giovinezza (\"The Youth\"). Fascism identifies the physical age period of youth as a critical time for the moral development of people who will affect society.\n\n## Palingenesis and modernism\n\nFascism emphasizes both palingenesis (national rebirth or re-creation) and modernism. In particular, fascism's nationalism has been identified as having a palingenetic character. Fascism promotes the regeneration of the nation and purging it of decadence. Fascism accepts forms of modernism that it deems promotes national regeneration while rejecting forms of modernism that are regarded as antithetical to national regeneration.\n\n## Culture\n\nIn The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction (1935), Walter Benjamin identifies aestheticization of politics as a key ingredient in fascist regimes. On this point he quotes Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, founder of the Futurist art movement and co-author of the Fascist Manifesto (1919), who aestheticizes war in his writings and claims that \"war is beautiful.\"\n\n## Aesthetics\n\nIn The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction (1935), Walter Benjamin identifies aestheticization of politics as a key ingredient in fascist regimes. On this point he quotes Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, founder of the Futurist art movement and co-author of the Fascist Manifesto (1919), who aestheticizes war in his writings and claims that \"war is beautiful.\"\n\n## Popular culture\n\nIn Italy, the Mussolini regime created the Direzione Generale per la Cinematografi to encourage film studios to glorify fascism. Italian cinema flourished because the regime stopped the import of Hollywood films in 1938, subsidized domestic production, and kept ticket prices low. The regime censored criticism and used the state-run Luce Institute film company to laud the Duce through newsreels, documentaries, and photographs. The regime promoted Italian opera and theatre as well, making sure that political enemies did not have a voice on stage.\n\n## Criticism\n\nFascist parties were closely contested by anti-fascist movements from the political centre and left wing throughout the Interwar period. The defeat of the Axis powers in World War II and subsequent revelation of the crimes against humanity committed during the Holocaust by Germany have led to an almost universal condemnation of both past and present forms of fascism in the modern era. \"Fascism\" is today used across the political spectrum as a pejorative or byword for perceived authoritarianism and other forms of political evil.\n\n## Anti-democratic and tyrannical\n\nOne of the most common and strongest criticisms of fascism is that it is a tyranny. Fascism is deliberately and entirely non-democratic and anti-democratic.\n\n## Unprincipled opportunism\n\nSome critics of Italian fascism have said that much of the ideology was merely a by-product of unprincipled opportunism by Mussolini and that he changed his political stances merely to bolster his personal ambitions while he disguised them as being purposeful to the public. Richard Washburn Child, the American ambassador to Italy who worked with Mussolini and became his friend and admirer, defended Mussolini's opportunistic behaviour by writing:\n\n## Ideological dishonesty\n\nFascism has been criticized for being ideologically dishonest. Major examples of ideological dishonesty have been identified in Italian fascism's changing relationship with German Nazism. Fascist Italy's official foreign policy positions commonly used rhetorical ideological hyperbole to justify its actions, although during Dino Grandi's tenure as Italy's foreign minister the country engaged in realpolitik free of such fascist hyperbole. Italian fascism's stance towards German Nazism fluctuated from support from the late 1920s to 1934, when it celebrated Hitler's rise to power and Mussolini's first meeting with Hitler in 1934; to opposition from 1934 to 1936 after the assassination of Italy's allied leader in Austria, Engelbert Dollfuss, by Austrian Nazis; and again back to support after 1936, when Germany was the only significant power that did not denounce Italy's invasion and occupation of Ethiopia.\n\n## Anti-fascism\n\nAnti-fascism is a political movement in opposition to fascist ideologies, groups and individuals. Beginning in European countries in the 1920s, it was at its most significant shortly before and during World War II, where the Axis powers were opposed by many countries forming the Allies of World War II and dozens of resistance movements worldwide. Anti-fascism has been an element of movements across the political spectrum and holding many different political positions such as anarchism, communism, pacifism, republicanism, social democracy, socialism and syndicalism as well as centrist, conservative, liberal and nationalist viewpoints.\n\nNote that the article is approximately 4096 words in length and maintains a neutral, encyclopedic tone throughout.

of sticks', ultimately from the Latin word fasces [3] This was the name given to political organizations in Italy known as fasci, groups similar to guilds or syndicates According to Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini's own account, the Fasces of Revolutionary Action were founded in Italy in 1915 [21] In 1919, Mussolini founded the Italian Fasces of Combat in Milan, which became the National Fascist Party two years later The fascists came to associate the term with the ancient Roman fasces or fascio littorio, [22] a bundle of rods tied around an axe, [23] an ancient Roman symbol of the authority of the civic magistrate, [24] carried by his lictors [25] The symbolism of the fasces suggested strength through unity: a single rod is easily broken, while the bundle is difficult to break [26] Similar symbols were developed by different fascist movements; for example, the symbol of Falangism is five arrows joined by a yoke [27]\n\n\nDefinitions\nHistorian Ian Kershaw once wrote that \"trying to define 'fascism' is like trying to nail jelly to the wall.\" [28] Each group described as \"fascist\" has at least some unique elements, and frequently definitions of \"fascism\" have been criticized as either too broad or too narrow [29] According to many scholars, fascists—especially when they're in power—have historically attacked communism, conservatism, and parliamentary liberalism, attracting support primarily from the far-right [30]\n\n\nPosition on the political spectrum\nScholars place fascism on the far right of the political spectrum [6] [5] [7] Such scholarship focuses on its social conservatism and its authoritarian means of opposing egalitarianism [63] Roderick Stackelberg places fascism—including Nazism, which he says is \"a radical variant of fascism\"—on the political right by explaining: \"The more a person deems absolute equality among all people to be a desirable condition, the further left he or she will be on the ideological spectrum The more a person considers inequality to be unavoidable or even desirable, the further to the right he or she will be.\" [64]\n\n\nFascist as a pejorative\nThe term fascist has been used as a pejorative, [75] regarding varying movements across the far right of the political spectrum George Orwell noted in 1944 that the term had been used to denigrate diverse positions \"in internal politics\" Orwell said that while fascism is \"a political and economic system\" that was inconvenient to define, \"as used, the word 'Fascism' is almost entirely meaningless .. almost any English person would accept 'bully' as a synonym for 'Fascist'\", [76] and in 1946 wrote that \"'Fascism' has now no meaning except in so far as it signifies something not desirable.\" [77] Richard Griffiths of the University of Wales wrote in 2000 that \"fascism\" is the \"most misused, and over-used word, of our times\" [78]: 1  Fascist is sometimes applied to post-World War II organizations and ways of thinking that academics more commonly term neo-fascist [79]\n\n\nHistory\nEarly influences that shaped the ideology of fascism have been dated back to ancient Greece The political culture of ancient Greece and specifically the ancient Greek city state of Sparta under Lycurgus, with its emphasis on militarism and racial purity, were admired by the Nazis [85] [86] Nazi Führer Adolf Hitler emphasized that Germany should adhere to Hellenic values and culture – particularly that of ancient Sparta [85]\n\n\nBackground and 19th-century roots\nEarly influences that shaped the ideology of

siècle era and fusion of Maurrasism with Sorelianism (1880–1914)\nThe historian Zeev Sternhell has traced the ideological roots of fascism back to the 1880s and in particular to the fin de siècle theme of that time [96] The theme was based on a revolt against materialism, rationalism, positivism, bourgeois society, and democracy [97] The fin-de-siècle generation supported emotionalism, irrationalism, subjectivism, and vitalism [98] They regarded civilization as being in crisis, requiring a massive and total solution [97] Their intellectual school considered the individual as only one part of the larger collectivity, which should not be viewed as a numerical sum of atomized individuals [97] They condemned the rationalistic, liberal individualism of society and the dissolution of social links in bourgeois society [97]\n\n\nFascist syndicalism\nFrench revolutionary syndicalist Georges Sorel promoted the legitimacy of political violence in his work Reflections on Violence (1908) and other works in which he advocated radical syndicalist action to achieve a revolution to overthrow capitalism and the bourgeoisie through a general strike [106] In Reflections on Violence, Sorel emphasized need for a revolutionary political religion [107] Also in his work The Illusions of Progress, Sorel denounced democracy as reactionary, saying \"nothing is more aristocratic than democracy.\" [108] By 1909, after the failure of a syndicalist general strike in France, Sorel and his supporters left the radical left and went to the radical right, where they sought to merge militant Catholicism and French patriotism with their views—advocating anti-republican Christian French patriots as ideal revolutionaries [109] Initially, Sorel had officially been a revisionist of Marxism, but by 1910 announced his abandonment of socialist literature and claimed in 1914, using an aphorism of Benedetto Croce that \"socialism is dead\" because of the \"decomposition of Marxism\" [110] Sorel became a supporter of reactionary Maurrassian nationalism beginning in 1909 that influenced his works [110] Maurras held interest in merging his nationalist ideals with Sorelian syndicalism, known as Sorelianism, as a means to confront democracy [111] Maurras stated that \"a socialism liberated from the democratic and cosmopolitan element fits nationalism well as a well made glove fits a beautiful hand.\" [112]\n\n\nWorld War I and its aftermath (1914–1929)\nAt the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the Italian political left became severely split over its position on the war The Italian Socialist Party (PSI) opposed the war but a number of Italian revolutionary syndicalists supported war against Germany and Austria-Hungary on the grounds that their reactionary regimes had to be defeated to ensure the success of socialism [121] Angelo Oliviero Olivetti formed a pro-interventionist fascio called the Revolutionary Fasces of International Action in October 1914 [121] Benito Mussolini upon being expelled from his position as chief editor of the PSI's newspaper Avanti! for his anti-German stance, joined the interventionist cause in a separate fascio [122] The term \"fascism\" was first used in 1915 by members of Mussolini's movement, the Fasces of Revolutionary Action [123]\n\n\nImpact of World War I\nFascists viewed World War I as bringing revolutionary changes in the nature of war, society, the state and technology, as the advent of total war and mass mobilization had broken down the distinction between civilian and combatant, as civilians had become a critical part in economic production for the war effort and thus arose a \"military citizenship\" in which all citizens were involved to the military in some manner during the war [10] World War I had resulted in the rise of a powerful state capable of mobilizing millions of people to serve on the front lines or provide economic production and logistics to support those on the front lines, as well as having unprecedented authority to intervene in the lives of citizens [10] Fascists viewed technological developments of weaponry and the state's total mobilization of its population in the war as symbolizing the beginning of a new era fusing state power with mass politics, technology and particularly the mobilizing myth that they contended had triumphed over the myth of progress and the era of liberalism [129]\n\n\nImpact of the Bolshevik Revolution\nThe October Revolution of 1917, in which Bolshevik communists led by Vladimir Lenin seized power in Russia, greatly influenced the development of fascism [132] Leon Trotsky would later formulate a theory of fascism based on a dialectical interpretation of events to analyze the manifestation of Italian fascism and the early emergence of Nazi Germany from 1930 to 1933 [133] In 1917, Mussolini, as leader of the Fasces of Revolutionary Action, praised the October Revolution, but later he became unimpressed with Lenin, regarding him as merely a new version of Tsar Nicholas II [134] After World War I, fascists commonly campaigned on anti-Marxist agendas [132]\n\n\nFascist Manifesto and Charter of Carnaro\nIn 1919, Alceste De Ambris and futurist movement leader Filippo Tommaso Marinetti created \"The Manifesto of the Italian Fasces of Combat\" [136] The Fascist Manifesto was presented on 6 June 1919 in the fascist newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia and supported the creation of universal suffrage, including women's suffrage (the latter being realized only partly in late 1925, with all opposition parties banned or disbanded); [137] proportional representation on a regional basis; government representation through a corporatist system of \"National Councils\" of experts, selected from professionals and tradespeople, elected to represent and hold legislative power over their respective areas, including labour, industry, transportation, public health, and communications, among others; and abolition of the Senate of the Kingdom of Italy [138] The Fascist Manifesto supported the creation of an eight-hour work day for all workers, a minimum wage, worker representation in industrial management, equal confidence in labour unions as in industrial executives and public servants, reorganization of the transportation sector, revision of the draft law on invalidity insurance, reduction of the retirement age from 65 to 55, a strong progressive tax on capital, confiscation of the property of religious institutions and abolishment of bishoprics, and revision of military contracts to allow the government to seize 85% of profits [139] It also called for the fulfillment of expansionist aims in the Balkans and other parts of the Mediterranean, the creation of a short-service national militia to serve defensive duties, nationalization of the armaments industry, and a foreign policy designed to be peaceful but also competitive [140]\n\n\nFrom populism to conservative accommodations\nIn 1920, militant strike activity by industrial workers reached its peak in Italy and 1919 and 1920 were known as the \"Red Year\" (Biennio Rosso) [144] Mussolini and the fascists took advantage of the situation by allying with industrial businesses and attacking workers and peasants in the name of preserving order and internal peace in Italy [145]\n\n\nFascist violence\nBeginning in 1922, fascist paramilitaries escalated their strategy from one of attacking socialist offices and the homes of socialist leadership figures, to one of violent occupation of cities The fascists met little serious resistance from authorities and proceeded to take over several northern Italian cities [154] The fascists attacked the headquarters of socialist and Catholic labour unions in Cremona and imposed forced Italianization upon the German-speaking population of Bolzano [154] [155] After seizing these cities, the fascists made plans to take Rome [154]\n\n\nFascist Italy\nHistorian Stanley G Payne says:\n\n\nMussolini in power\nUpon being appointed Prime Minister of Italy, Mussolini had to form a coalition government because the fascists did not have control over the Italian parliament [159] Mussolini's coalition government initially pursued economically liberal policies under the direction of liberal finance minister Alberto De Stefani, a member of the Center Party, including balancing the budget through deep cuts to the civil service [159] Initially, little drastic change in government policy had occurred and repressive police actions were limited [159]\n\n\nCatholic Church\nIn 1929, the fascist regime briefly gained what was in effect a blessing of the Catholic Church after the regime signed a concordat with the Church, known as the Lateran Treaty, which gave the papacy state sovereignty and financial compensation for the seizure of Church lands by the liberal state in the 19th century, but within two years the Church had renounced fascism in the Encyclical Non Abbiamo Bisogno as a \"pagan idolatry of the state\" which teaches \"hatred, violence and irreverence\" [163] Not long after signing the agreement, by Mussolini's own confession, the Church had threatened to have him \"excommunicated\", in part because of his intractable nature, but also because he had \"confiscated more issues of Catholic newspapers in the next three months than in the previous seven years.\" [164] By the late 1930s, Mussolini became more vocal in his anti-clerical rhetoric, repeatedly denouncing the Catholic Church and discussing ways to depose the pope He took the position that the \"papacy was a malignant tumor in the body of Italy and must 'be rooted out once and for all,' because there was no room in Rome for both the Pope and himself.\" [165] In her 1974 book, Mussolini's widow Rachele stated that her husband had always been an atheist until near the end of his life, writing that her husband was \"basically irreligious until the later years of his life.\" [166]\n\n\nCorporatist economic system\nThe fascist regime created a corporatist economic system in 1925 with creation of the Palazzo Vidoni Pact, in which the Italian employers' association Confindustria and fascist trade unions agreed to recognize each other as the sole representatives of Italy's employers and employees, excluding non-fascist trade unions [170] The Fascist regime first created a Ministry of Corporations that organized the Italian economy into 22 sectoral corporations, banned workers' strikes and lock-outs and in 1927 created the Charter of Labour, which established workers' rights and duties and created labour tribunals to arbitrate employer-employee disputes [170] In practice, the sectoral corporations exercised little independence and were largely controlled by the regime, and the employee organizations were rarely led by employees themselves, but instead by appointed Fascist party members [170]\n\n\nAggressive foreign policy\nIn the 1920s, Fascist Italy pursued an aggressive foreign policy that included ambitions to expand Italian territory [171] In response to revolt in the Italian colony of Libya, Fascist Italy abandoned previous liberal-era colonial policy of cooperation with local leaders Instead, claiming that Italians were a superior race to African races and thereby had the right to colonize the \"inferior\" Africans, it sought to settle 10 to 15 million Italians in Libya [172] This resulted in an aggressive military campaign known as the Pacification of Libya against natives in Libya, including mass killings, the use of concentration camps and the forced starvation of thousands of people [172] Italian authorities committed ethnic cleansing by forcibly expelling 100,000 Bedouin Cyrenaicans, half the population of Cyrenaica in Libya, from their settlements that was slated to be given to Italian settlers [173]\n\n\nNazi adoption of the Italian model\nThe March on Rome brought fascism international attention One early admirer of the Italian fascists was Adolf Hitler, who less than a month after the March had begun to model himself and the Nazi Party upon Mussolini and the Fascists [174] The Nazis, led by Hitler and the German war hero Erich Ludendorff, attempted a \"March on Berlin\" modeled upon the March on Rome, which resulted in the failed Beer Hall Putsch in Munich in November 1923 [175]\n\n\nInternational impact of the Great Depression and buildup to World War II\nThe conditions of economic hardship caused by the Great Depression brought about an international surge of social unrest [176] Fascist propaganda blamed the problems of the long depression of the 1930s on minorities and scapegoats: \"Judeo-Masonic-bolshevik\" conspiracies, left-wing internationalism and the presence of immigrants [177]\n\n\nWorld War II (1939–1945)\nIn Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, both Mussolini and Hitler pursued territorial expansionist and interventionist foreign policy agendas from the 1930s through the 1940s culminating in World War II From 1935 to 1939, Germany and Italy escalated their demands for territorial claims and greater influence in world affairs Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935 resulting in its condemnation by the League of Nations and its widespread diplomatic isolation In 1936, Germany remilitarized the industrial Rhineland, a region that had been ordered demilitarized by the Treaty of Versailles In 1938, Germany annexed Austria and Italy assisted Germany in resolving the diplomatic crisis between Germany versus Britain and France over claims on Czechoslovakia by arranging the Munich Agreement that gave Germany the Sudetenland and was perceived at the time to have averted a European war These hopes faded when Czechoslovakia was dissolved by the proclamation of the German client state of Slovakia, followed by the next day of the occupation of the remaining Czech Lands and the proclamation of the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia At the same time from 1938 to 1939, Italy was demanding territorial and colonial concessions from France and Britain [195] In 1939, Germany prepared for war with Poland, but attempted to gain territorial concessions from Poland through diplomatic means [196] The Polish government did not trust Hitler's promises and refused to accept Germany's demands [196]\n\n\nPost-World War II (1945–2008)\nThe victory of the Allies over the Axis powers in World War II led to the collapse of many fascist regimes in Europe The Nuremberg Trials convicted several Nazi leaders of crimes against humanity involving the Holocaust However, there remained several movements and governments that were ideologically related to fascism [201] [202]\n\n\nContemporary fascism (2008–present)\nAfter the onset of the Great Recession and economic crisis in Greece, a movement known as the Golden Dawn, widely considered a neo-Nazi party, soared in support out of obscurity and won seats in Greece's parliament, espousing a staunch hostility towards minorities, illegal immigrants and refugees In 2013, after the murder of an anti-fascist musician by a person with links to Golden Dawn, the Greek government ordered the arrest of Golden Dawn's leader Nikolaos Michaloliakos and other members on charges related to being associated with a criminal organization [215] [216] On 7 October 2020, Athens Appeals Court announced verdicts for 68 defendants, including the party's political leadership Nikolaos Michaloliakos and six other prominent members and former members of parliament (MPs) were found guilty of running a criminal organization [217] Guilty verdicts were delivered on charges of murder, attempted murder, and violent attacks on immigrants and left-wing political opponents [218]\n\n\nGreece\nAfter the onset of the Great Recession and economic crisis in Greece, a movement known as the Golden Dawn, widely considered a neo-Nazi party, soared in support out of obscurity and

political opponents [218]\n\n\nPost-Soviet Russia\nMarlene Laruelle, a French political scientist, contends in Is Russia Fascist? that the accusation of \"fascist\" has evolved into a strategic narrative of the existing world order Geopolitical rivals might construct their own view of the world and assert the moral high ground by branding ideological rivals as fascists, regardless of their real ideals or deeds Laruelle discusses the basis, significance, and veracity of accusations of fascism in and around Russia through an analysis of the domestic situation in Russia and the Kremlin's foreign policy justifications; she concludes that Russian efforts to brand its opponents as fascist is ultimately an attempt to determine the future of Russia in Europe as an antifascist force, influenced by its role in fighting fascism in World War II [219]\n\n\nTenets\nRobert O Paxton finds that even though fascism \"maintained the existing regime of property and social hierarchy\", it cannot be considered \"simply a more muscular form of conservatism\" because \"fascism in power did carry out some changes profound enough to be called 'revolutionary.'\" [228] These transformations \"often set fascists into conflict with conservatives rooted in families, churches, social rank, and property.\" Paxton argues:\n\n\nNationalism with or without expansionism\nUltranationalism, combined with the myth of national rebirth, is a key foundation of fascism [229] Robert Paxton argues that \"a passionate nationalism\" is the basis of fascism, combined with \"a conspiratorial and Manichean view of history\" which holds that \"the chosen people have been weakened by political parties, social classes, unassimilable minorities, spoiled rentiers, and rationalist thinkers.\" [230] Roger Griffin identifies the core of fascism as being palingenetic ultranationalism [42]\n\n\nTotalitarianism\nFascism promotes the establishment of a totalitarian state [13] It opposes liberal democracy, rejects multi-party systems, and may support a one-party state so that it may synthesize with the nation [14] Mussolini's The Doctrine of Fascism (1932), partly ghostwritten by philosopher Giovanni Gentile, [235] who Mussolini described as \"the philosopher of Fascism\", states: \"The Fascist conception of the State is all-embracing; outside of it no human or spiritual values can exist, much less have value Thus understood, Fascism is totalitarian, and the Fascist State—a synthesis and a unit inclusive of all values—interprets, develops, and potentiates the whole life of a people.\" [236] In The Legal Basis of the Total State, Nazi political theorist Carl Schmitt described the Nazi intention to form a \"strong state which guarantees a totality of political unity transcending all diversity\" in order to avoid a \"disastrous pluralism tearing the German people apart.\" [237]\n\n\nEconomy\nHistorians and other scholars disagree on the question of whether a specifically fascist type of economic policy can be said to exist David Baker argues that there is an identifiable economic system in fascism that is distinct from those advocated by other ideologies, comprising essential characteristics that fascist nations shared [240] Payne, Paxton, Sternhell et al argue that while fascist economies share some similarities, there is no distinctive form of fascist economic organization [241] [242] [243] Gerald Feldman and Timothy Mason argue that fascism is distinguished by an absence of coherent economic ideology and an absence of serious economic thinking They state that the decisions taken by fascist leaders cannot be explained within a logical economic framework [244]\n\n\nDirect action\nFascism emphasizes direct action, including supporting the legitimacy of political violence, as a core part of its politics [273] Fascism views violent action as a necessity in politics that fascism identifies as being an \"endless struggle\"; [274] this emphasis on the use of political violence means that most fascist parties have also created their own private militias (e.g the Nazi Party's Brown shirts and Fascist Italy's Blackshirts) The basis of fascism's support of violent action in politics is connected to social Darwinism [274] Fascist movements have commonly held social Darwinist views of nations, races and societies [275] They say that nations and races must purge themselves of socially and biologically weak or degenerate people, while simultaneously promoting the creation of strong people, in order to survive in a world defined by perpetual national and racial conflict [276]\n\n\nAge and gender roles\nFascism emphasizes youth both in a physical sense of age and in a spiritual sense as related to virility and commitment to action [277] The Italian Fascists' political anthem was called Giovinezza (\"The Youth\") [277] Fascism identifies the physical age period of youth as a critical time for the moral development of people who will affect society [278] Walter Laqueur argues that \" [t]he corollaries of the cult of war and physical danger were the cult of brutality, strength, and sexuality ..  [fascism is] a true counter-civilization: rejecting the sophisticated rationalist humanism of Old Europe, fascism sets up as its ideal the primitive instincts and primal emotions of the barbarian.\" [279]\n\n\nPalingenesis and modernism\nFascism emphasizes both palingenesis (national rebirth or re-creation) and modernism [295] In particular, fascism's nationalism has been identified as having a palingenetic character [296] Fascism promotes the regeneration of the nation and purging it of decadence [295] Fascism accepts forms of modernism that it deems promotes national regeneration while rejecting forms of modernism that are regarded as antithetical to national regeneration [297] Fascism aestheticized modern technology and its association with speed, power and violence [298] Fascism admired advances in the economy in the early 20th century, particularly Fordism and scientific management [299] Fascist modernism has been recognized as inspired or developed by various figures—such as Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Ernst Jünger, Gottfried Benn, Louis-Ferdinand Céline, Knut Hamsun, Ezra Pound and Wyndham Lewis [300]\n\n\nCulture\nIn The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction (1935), Walter Benjamin identifies aestheticization of politics as a key ingredient in fascist regimes [303] On this point he quotes Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, founder of the Futurist art movement and co-author of the Fascist Manifesto (1919), who aestheticizes war in his writings and claims that \"war is beautiful.\" [304]\n\n\nAesthetics\nIn The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction (1935), Walter Benjamin identifies aestheticization of politics as a key ingredient in fascist regimes [303] On this point he quotes Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, founder of the Futurist art movement and co-author of the Fascist Manifesto (1919), who aestheticizes war in his writings and claims that \"war is beautiful.\" [304]\n\n\nPopular culture\nIn Italy, the Mussolini regime created the Direzione Generale per la Cinematografi to encourage film studios to glorify fascism Italian cinema flourished because the regime stopped the import of Hollywood films in 1938, subsidized domestic production, and kept ticket prices low It encouraged international distribution to glorify its African empire and to belie the charge that Italy was backward [308] The regime censored criticism and used the state-run Luce Institute film company to laud the Duce through newsreels, documentaries, and photographs [309] The regime promoted Italian opera and theatre as well, making sure that political enemies did not have a voice on stage [310]\n\n\nCriticism\nFascist parties were closely contested by anti-fascist movements from the political centre and left wing throughout the Interwar period The defeat of the Axis powers in World War II and subsequent revelation of the crimes against humanity committed during the Holocaust by Germany have led to an almost universal condemnation of both past and present forms of fascism in the modern era \"Fascism\" is today used across the political spectrum as a pejorative or byword for perceived authoritarianism and other forms of political evil.\n\n\nAnti-democratic and tyrannical\nOne of the most common and strongest criticisms of fascism is that it is a tyranny [313] Fascism is deliberately and entirely non-democratic and anti-democratic [314]\n\n\nUnprincipled opportunism\n\nSome critics of Italian fascism have said that much of the ideology was merely a by-product of unprincipled opportunism by Mussolini and that he changed his political stances merely to bolster his personal ambitions while he disguised them as being purposeful to the public [316] Richard Washburn Child, the American ambassador to Italy who worked with Mussolini and became his friend and admirer, defended Mussolini's opportunistic behaviour by writing: \n\nIdeological dishonesty\nFascism has been criticized for being ideologically dishonest Major examples of ideological dishonesty have been identified in Italian fascism's changing relationship with German Nazism [326] Fascist Italy's official foreign policy positions commonly used rhetorical ideological hyperbole to justify its actions, although during Dino Grandi's tenure as Italy's foreign minister the country engaged in realpolitik free of such fascist hyperbole [327] Italian fascism's stance towards German Nazism fluctuated from support from the late 1920s to 1934, when it celebrated Hitler's rise to power and Mussolini's first meeting with Hitler in 1934; to opposition from 1934 to 1936 after the assassination of Italy's allied leader in Austria, Engelbert Dollfuss, by Austrian Nazis; and again back to support after 1936, when Germany was the only significant power that did not denounce Italy's invasion and occupation of Ethiopia.\n\n\nAnti-fascism\nAnti-fascism is a political movement in opposition to fascist ideologies, groups and individuals Beginning in European countries in the 1920s, it was at its most significant shortly before and during World War II, where the Axis powers were opposed by many countries forming the Allies of World War II and dozens of resistance movements worldwide Anti-fascism has been an element of movements across the political spectrum and holding many different political positions such as anarchism, communism, pacifism, republicanism, social democracy, socialism and syndicalism as well as centrist, conservative, liberal and nationalist viewpoints.\n\n\nSee also\nFinal solution\n\n\nReferences\nFinal solution\n\n\nBibliography\nFinal solution\n\n\nPrimary sources\nFinal solution\n\n\nSecondary sources\nFinal solution\n\n\nTertiary sources\nFinal solution\n\n\nFurther reading\nFinal solution\n\n\nExternal links\nFinal solution\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The ceremony marked the formal investiture of Elizabeth as the monarch of the United Kingdom, following the death of her father, King George VI. The coronation was a grand affair, attended by dignitaries from across the Commonwealth, and was broadcast live on television for the first time in history.\n\nPreparations\n\nThe coronation ceremony took 14 months of preparation, with the first meeting of the Coronation Commission taking place in April 1952. The commission was chaired by Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, who was married to the Queen. Other committees, such as the Coronation Joint Committee and the Coronation Executive Committee, were also formed, with the Duke of Norfolk as their chairman. As Earl Marshal, the Duke of Norfolk had overall responsibility for the event. David Eccles, the Minister of Works, was responsible for the physical preparations and decorations along the route, while Hugh Casson designed the street decorations for Westminster, and Eric Bedford designed the Coronation Arches erected over The Mall.\n\nEvent\n\nThe coronation ceremony followed a pattern similar to the coronations of the kings and queens before her, being held in Westminster Abbey, and involving the peerage and clergy. However, for the new queen, several parts of the ceremony were markedly different. The ceremony began with the coronation regalia being carried into the abbey, including the Second Sword, carried by the Earl of Home, Curtana carried by the Duke of Northumberland, the Third Sword carried by the Duke of Buccleuch and Queensbury, and St Edward's Crown, carried into the abbey by the Lord High Steward of England. The archbishops and bishops of the Church of England waited outside the Great West Door for the Queen's arrival. Once the Queen arrived at around 11:00 am, she found that the friction between her robes and the carpet caused her difficulty moving forward, and she said to the Archbishop of Canterbury, Geoffrey Fisher, \"Get me started!\" The procession then moved inside the abbey, up the central aisle and through the choir to the stage, as the choirs sang I was glad, an imperial setting of Psalm 122, vv. 1-3, 6, and 7 by Sir Hubert Parry.\n\nTelevision\n\nThe coronation was the first to be televised in full; the BBC's cameras had not been allowed inside Westminster Abbey for Queen Elizabeth II's parents' coronation in 1937 and had covered only the procession outside.

Some had camped overnight in their spot to ensure a view of the monarch, while others had access to specially built stands and scaffolding along the route.

All across the Queen's realms, the rest of the Commonwealth, and in other parts of the world, coronation celebrations were held. The British government announced an extra bank holiday that fell on 3 June and moved the last bank holiday in May to 2 June to allow for an extended time of celebrations. The Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal was also presented to thousands of recipients throughout the Queen's realms and in Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the UK, commemorative coins were issued. Three million bronze coronation medallions were ordered by the Canadian government, struck by the Royal Canadian Mint and distributed to schoolchildren across the country; the obverse showed Elizabeth's effigy and the reverse the royal cypher above the word CANADA, all circumscribed by ELIZABETH II REGINA CORONATA MCMLIII.\n\nLater events\n\nOn 15 June 1953, the Queen attended a fleet review at Spithead, off the coast at Portsmouth, where 197 Royal Navy warships were present, along with 13 from the Commonwealth and 16 from foreign navies. There were more British and Commonwealth naval ships present than at the 1937 coronation review, though a third of them were frigates or smaller vessels. Major Royal Navy units included Britain's last battleship, HMS Vanguard, and four fleet and three light aircraft carriers. The Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Canadian Navy also each included a light carrier in their contingents, HMAS Sydney and HMCS Magnificent.\n\nHonours of Scotland\n\nDuring a week-long visit to Scotland, on 24 June 1953, the Queen attended a national service of thanksgiving at St Giles' Cathedral, Edinburgh, during which she was ceremonially presented with the Honours of Scotland, the Scottish crown jewels. Following a carriage procession through the city escorted by the Royal Company of Archers, the service, led by the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, James Pitt-Watson, was attended by a congregation of 1,700 drawn from all sections of Scottish society. The high point of the event was the presentation of the Honours, which the Queen received from the Dean of the Thistle, Charles Warr, and then passed the Crown of Scotland to the Duke of Hamilton, the Sword of State to the Earl of Home, and the Sceptre to the Earl of Crawford and Balcarres.\n\nCoronation Review of the RAF\n\nOn 15 July 1953, the Queen attended a review of the Royal Air Force at RAF Odiham in Hampshire. The first part of the review was a march past by contingents representing the various commands of the RAF, with Bomber Command leading. This was followed by four de Havilland Venoms of the Central Fighter Establishment making the Royal Cypher in skywriting. After lunch, the Queen in an open car toured the lines of some 300 aircraft that were arranged in a static display. She returned to the central dias for the flypast of 640 British and Commonwealth aircraft, of which 440 were jet-powered. The flypast was led by a Bristol Sycamore helicopter which was towing a large RAF Ensign, while the final aircraft was a prototype Supermarine Swift flown by test pilot Mike Lithgow.

monarch in history, serving from 1952 until her death on 8 September 2022. She was 96 years old at the time of her passing.\n\n**Background**\n\nQueen Elizabeth II was in good health for most of her life, but her health declined significantly following the death of her husband, Prince Philip, in April 2021. She began to use a walking stick for public engagements in October 2021. On 20 October, the Queen stayed overnight in King Edward VII's Hospital in central London, necessitating the cancellation of scheduled visits to Northern Ireland and the COP26 summit in Glasgow. She suffered a sprained back in November, which prevented her from attending the 2021 National Service of Remembrance.\n\n**Death and National Mourning**\n\nThe Queen died at 15:10 BST on 8 September 2022 at the age of 96. Her death certificate, which was made public on 29 September, recorded her cause of death as old age. According to her former prime minister Boris Johnson and the biographer Gyles Brandreth, she was suffering from a form of bone marrow cancer, which Brandreth wrote was multiple myeloma. Her death was publicly announced at 18:30. Elizabeth II was the first monarch to die in Scotland since James V in 1542.\n\n**Death and Announcement**\n\nThe Queen died at 15:10 BST on 8 September 2022 at the age of 96.

According to her former prime minister Boris Johnson and the biographer Gyles Brandreth, she was suffering from a form of bone marrow cancer, which Brandreth wrote was multiple myeloma. Her death was publicly announced at 18:30. Elizabeth II was the first monarch to die in Scotland since James V in 1542.\n\n**Scottish Events**\n\nAs the Queen had died in Scotland, Operation Unicorn was the first part of Operation London Bridge to take effect. Her body was taken to Edinburgh, where ceremonies were held, then to London for the state funeral.\n\n**Lying-in-State**\n\nUpon the arrival of the Queen's coffin in London, it was transported to Buckingham Palace, before being moved to Westminster Hall the following day for her lying-in-state before the state funeral. Two queues were formed to view the lying-in-state, beginning 48 hours before Westminster Hall opened to the public. At its maximum extent the main queue was approximately 10 miles long and had a waiting time of over 25 hours. This queue attracted much media attention, with many commentators noting the stereotype that British people are good at queueing.\n\n**State Funeral**\n\nPlans for the Queen's death had existed in some form since the 1960s, and the Queen was consulted about all the details included in her funeral plan. The earl marshal was in charge of organising the event.\n\n**Procession to Westminster Abbey**\n\nAt 10:44 on 19 September the Queen's coffin was moved from Westminster Hall to Westminster Abbey on the State Gun Carriage of the Royal Navy. The carriage was drawn by Royal Navy sailors, known as Naval Ratings, maintaining a tradition which began with the state funeral of Queen Victoria. The King, members of the royal family, and members of the King's household walked behind. Non-working royals, including the Duke of York and the Duke of Sussex, did not wear military uniforms for the state funeral and the committal service. A wreath with foliage cut from the gardens of Buckingham Palace, Highgrove House, and Clarence House was placed on the coffin, together with a note from the King which read \"In loving and devoted memory Charles R.\"\n\n**Funeral Service**\n\nMusic by British composers was played before the service, and as the coffin entered the abbey the choir sang William Croft's setting of the Funeral Sentences. The service began at 11:00 and was conducted by the Dean of Westminster, David Hoyle, according to the 1662 Book of Common Prayer. The lessons were read by Baroness Scotland, Secretary General of the Commonwealth, and Liz Truss, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and the sermon and commendation were given by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby. Prayers were said by clergy from several Christian denominations.\n\n**Processions in London and Windsor**\n\nTwo processions followed the service. The first was from Westminster Abbey to Wellington Arch, where the Queen's coffin was placed in the state hearse. From there it was transported to Windsor, where the second procession took place through Windsor Great Park.\n\n**Committal Service**\n\nThe committal service began at 16:00 in the presence of 800 guests, largely made up of the royal household and staff from the Queen's private estates, but also including the royal family, governors general and prime ministers from the Commonwealth realms, and members of foreign royal houses.\n\n**Interment**\n\nAfter the funeral of the Queen on 19 September, she was later interred beneath the King George VI Memorial Chapel in a private service attended only by her closest family at 19:30, alongside her father King George VI, her mother Queen Elizabeth, and the ashes of her sister Princess Margaret.\n\n**Organisation and Media**\n\nThe service at Westminster Abbey was attended by 2,000 people in total, including holders of the George Cross and Victoria Cross, representatives from the United Kingdom's faith communities, and foreign and Commonwealth heads of state and heads of government. Representatives from 168 countries, out of 193 UN member states and two UN observer states, confirmed attendance, including 18 monarchs, 55 presidents and 25 prime ministers.\n\n**Attendees**\n\nThe service at Westminster Abbey was attended by 2,000 people in total, including holders of the George Cross and Victoria Cross, representatives from the United Kingdom's faith communities, and foreign and Commonwealth heads of state and heads of government.

Officers from across the country supported the operation under mutual aid agreements. Thames Valley Police announced that they would introduce new water patrols for observing busy waterways in the lead-up to the funeral, and mounted police officers, police dogs, and drones provided part of the security in Windsor.\n\n**Cost and Economic Impact**\n\nHM Treasury estimated the public expenditure to have been £162 million. The GDP of the United Kingdom contracted by 0.6 per cent in September 2022, attributable in part to the funeral and the period of national mourning that preceded it.\n\n**Coverage**\n\nThe funeral and committal service of the Queen were the first of any British monarch to be broadcast on television to the public.

Coverage in the United States was watched by more than 10 million viewers, with ABC News averaging 3 million viewers during its coverage of the event.\n\n**Viewing Figures**\n\nWith an average audience of 26.5 million across more than 50 channels, the television broadcast was the second most watched broadcast in the United Kingdom during the 21st century (after Prime Minister Boris Johnson's statement announcing a COVID-19 lockdown in March 2020) and the third most watched royal event in British history (surpassing the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, and approaching the weddings of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer, and Princess Anne and Mark Philips).\n\n**Succession and Four-Nation Tour**\n\nUpon the Queen's death her eldest child Charles, Prince of Wales, immediately acceded to the British throne as King Charles III. King Charles III and Queen Camilla travelled from Balmoral to Buckingham Palace, where they greeted the crowd of mourners outside the gates. The King then held an audience with the Prime Minister before paying tribute to his mother in a publicly broadcast message.\n\n**Other Activities**\n\nOn 10 September, a service at Crathie Kirk was attended by Anne and her husband Sir Timothy Laurence, Andrew, Edward and his wife Sophie, and the Queen's grandchildren Peter Phillips, Zara Tindall, Beatrice, Eugenie, and Louise Windsor, who then viewed floral tributes outside Balmoral.

the first monarch to die in Scotland since James V in 1542 [31] [32]\n\n\nDeath and announcement\nThe Queen died at 15:10 BST on 8 September 2022 at the age of 96 Her death certificate, which was made public on 29 September, recorded her cause of death as old age [1]  According to her former prime minister Boris Johnson [27] and the biographer Gyles Brandreth, she was suffering from a form of bone marrow cancer, which Brandreth wrote was multiple myeloma [28] Her death was publicly announced at 18:30 [29] [30] Elizabeth II was the first monarch to die in Scotland since James V in 1542 [31] [32]\n\n\nScottish events\nAs the Queen had died in Scotland, Operation Unicorn was the first part of Operation London Bridge to take effect [60] Her body was taken to Edinburgh, where ceremonies were held, then to London for the state funeral.\n\n\nLying-in-state\nUpon the arrival of the Queen's coffin in London, it was transported to Buckingham Palace, before being moved to Westminster Hall the following day for her lying-in-state before the state funeral.\n\n\nQueue\nTwo queues were formed to view the lying-in-state, beginning 48 hours before Westminster Hall opened to the public [105] At its maximum extent the main queue was approximately 10 miles (16 km) long and had a waiting time of over 25 hours [106] [107] This queue attracted much media attention, with many commentators noting the stereotype that British people are good at queueing [108] [109] [110] [111] The accessible queue, for people with a disability or long-term condition, operated a ticket system and was therefore shorter [112]\n\n\nState funeral\nPlans for the Queen's death had existed in some form since the 1960s, and the Queen was consulted about all the details included in her funeral plan [118] [119] The earl marshal was in charge of organising the event [119]\n\n\nPlanning\nPlans for the Queen's death had existed in some form since the 1960s, and the Queen was consulted about all the details included

Westminster Hall to Westminster Abbey on the State Gun Carriage of the Royal Navy [140] The carriage was drawn by Royal Navy sailors, known as Naval Ratings, maintaining a tradition which began with the state funeral of Queen Victoria [141] The King, members of the royal family, and members of the King's household walked behind [142] [121] [143] Non-working royals, including the Duke of York and the Duke of Sussex, did not wear military uniforms for the state funeral and the committal service A wreath with foliage cut from the gardens of Buckingham Palace, Highgrove House, and Clarence House was placed on the coffin, together with a note from the King which read \"In loving and devoted memory Charles R.\" [k] [144] Before the service the tenor bell of the Abbey rang once a minute for 96 minutes, once for each year of the Queen's life [145] The coffin arrived at Westminster Abbey at 10:52 [146]\n\n\nFuneral service\nMusic by British composers was played before the service, and as the coffin entered the abbey the choir sang William Croft's setting of the Funeral Sentences [l] [145] The service began at 11:00 and was conducted by the Dean of Westminster, David Hoyle, according to the 1662 Book of Common Prayer [140] [145] [148] The lessons were read by Baroness Scotland, Secretary General of the Commonwealth, and Liz Truss, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and the sermon and commendation were given by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby [145] Prayers were said by clergy from several Christian denominations [149] [m]\n\n\nProcessions in London and Windsor\nTwo processions followed the service The first was from Westminster Abbey to Wellington Arch, where the Queen's coffin was placed in the state hearse From there it was transported to Windsor, where the second procession took place through Windsor Great Park.\n\n\nCommittal service\nThe committal service began at 16:00 in the presence of 800 guests, largely made up of the royal household and staff from the Queen's private estates, but also including the royal family, governors general and prime ministers from the Commonwealth realms, and members of foreign royal houses [121] [146] [156] The Choir of St George's Chapel led the music, which included the Russian \"Kontakion of the Departed\", also sung at the funeral of Prince Philip [o] [158] A selection of music was also played before the service [158] [159] [p]\n\n\nInterment\nAfter the funeral of the Queen on 19 September, she was later interred beneath the King George VI Memorial Chapel in a private service attended only by her closest family at 19:30, alongside her father King George VI, her mother Queen Elizabeth, and the ashes of her sister Princess Margaret The remains of Prince Philip, who was temporarily interred in the Royal Vault following his funeral in 2021, were moved to the chapel after the interment of the Queen [140] [156]\n\n\nOrganisation and media\nThe service at Westminster Abbey was attended by 2,000 people in total, including holders of the George Cross and Victoria Cross, representatives from the United Kingdom's faith communities, and foreign and Commonwealth heads of state and heads of government [145] [156] [162] Representatives from 168 countries, out of 193 UN member states and two UN observer states, confirmed attendance, including 18 monarchs, 55 presidents and 25 prime

during the mourning period, a security operation described by the Metropolitan Police as the \"biggest the UK has ever seen\"; officers from across the country supported the operation under mutual aid agreements [166] [167] [168] Thames Valley Police announced that they would introduce new water patrols for observing busy waterways in the lead-up to the funeral, and mounted police officers, police dogs, and drones provided part of the security in Windsor [168] [169] [170] [171] Prior to the service a special unit, the Fixated Threat Assessment Centre, began to monitor and review individuals identified as having a potentially dangerous obsession with the British royal family [172]\n\n\nCost and economic impact\nHM Treasury estimated the public expenditure to have been £162 million [174] [175] The GDP of the United Kingdom contracted by 0.6 per cent in September 2022, attributable in part to the funeral and the period of national mourning that preceded it [176]\n\n\nCoverage\nThe funeral and committal service of the Queen were the first of any British monarch to be broadcast on television to the public [177] Filming had been prohibited during the state funeral of George VI,

third most watched royal event in British history (surpassing the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, and approaching the weddings of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer, and Princess Anne and Mark Philips) [199] [200]\n\n\nSuccession and four-nation tour\nUpon the Queen's death her eldest child Charles, Prince of Wales, immediately acceded to the British throne as King Charles III

{"title": "Ghostbusters", "content": "\nPlot\nAfter Columbia University parapsychology professors Peter Venkman, Ray Stantz, and Egon Spengler experience their first encounter with a ghost at the New York Public Library, the university dean dismisses the credibility of their paranormal-focused research and fires them The trio responds by establishing \"Ghostbusters\", a paranormal investigation and elimination service operating out of a disused firehouse They develop high-tech nuclear-powered equipment to capture and contain ghosts, although business is initially slow.\n\n\nCast\nIn addition to the main cast, Ghostbusters features David Margulies as Lenny Clotch, Mayor of New York, Michael Ensign as the Sedgewick Hotel manager, and Slavitza Jovan as Gozer (voiced by Paddi Edwards) It also features astrologist Ruth Hale Oliver as the Library Ghost, [3] Alice Drummond as the Librarian, [4] Jennifer Runyon and Steven Tash as Peter's psychological test subjects, [5] [6] Timothy Carhart as a violinist, [6] and Reginald VelJohnson as a corrections officer [7] Playboy Playmate Kymberly Herrin appears as a seductive ghost in Ray's dreams [3]\n\n\nProduction\nGhostbusters was inspired by Dan Aykroyd's fascination with and belief in the paranormal, [1] [8] which he inherited from his father, who later wrote the book A History of Ghosts; [9] his mother, who claimed to have seen ghosts; his grandfather, who experimented with radios to contact the dead; and his great-grandfather, a renowned spiritualist In 1981, Aykroyd read an article on quantum physics and parapsychology in The Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research, which gave him the idea of trapping ghosts He was also drawn to the idea of modernizing the comedic ghost films of the mid-20th century by comics such as Abbott and Costello (Hold That Ghost, 1941), Bob Hope (The Ghost Breakers, 1940) and the Bowery Boys (Ghost Chasers, 1951) [8] [10]\n\n\nDevelopment\nGhostbusters was inspired by Dan

as Abbott and Costello (Hold That Ghost, 1941), Bob Hope (The Ghost Breakers, 1940) and the Bowery Boys (Ghost Chasers, 1951) [8] [10]\n\n\nWriting\nAykroyd, Ramis, and Reitman began reworking the script, first at Reitman's office, then sequestering themselves and their families on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts Aykroyd had a home there, and they worked day and night in his basement for about two weeks [9] Aykroyd was willing to rework his script; he considered himself a \"kitchen sink\" writer who created the funny situations and paranormal jargon, while Ramis refined the jokes and dialogue They wrote separately, then rewrote each other's drafts Many scenes had to be cut, including an asylum haunted by celebrities, and an illegal ghost-storage facility in a New Jersey gas station [8] Their initial draft was completed when they left the Vineyard in mid-July 1983, and a third and near-final draft was ready by early August [8] [9] [15] When Murray flew to New York after filming The Razor's Edge (1984) to meet Aykroyd and Ramis, he offered little input on the script or his character Having written for Murray multiple times, Ramis said he knew \"how to handle his character's voice\" [8]\n\n\nCast and characters\nMurray was considered essential to Ghostbusters' potential success, but he was known for not committing to projects until late Price agreed to fund Murray's passion project The Razor's Edge, believing if it failed it would lose little money, and hoping the gesture would secure Murray's commitment to Ghostbusters [8] Michael Keaton, Chevy Chase, Tom Hanks, Robin Williams, Steve Guttenberg, and Richard Pryor were also considered for the role [1] [17] [18] Christopher Walken, John Lithgow, Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Goldblum, and Keaton were considered to portray Egon [18] [19] Ramis was inspired by the cover of a journal on abstract architecture for Egon's appearance, featuring a man wearing a three-piece tweed suit and wire-rim glasses, his hair standing straight up He took the character's first name from a Hungarian refugee with whom he attended school, and the surname from German historian Oswald Spengler [10] Apart from the three main stars, Medjuck was largely responsible for casting the roles [20]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began in New York City on October 28, 1983 [1] [8] [33] On the first day, Reitman brought Murray to the set, still unsure if he had read the script [8] Filming in New York lasted for approximately six weeks, finishing just before Christmas [9] Reitman was conscious they had to complete the New York phase before they encountered inhospitable December weather [34] At the time, choosing to shoot in New York City was considered risky In the early 1980s, many saw the city as synonymous with fiscal disaster and violence, and Los Angeles was seen as the center of the entertainment industry In a 2014 interview, Reitman said he chose New York because \"I wanted the film to be .. my New York movie\" [8] As Reitman was working with comedians, he encouraged improvisation, adapting multiple takes and keeping the cast creations that worked, but directing them back to the script [15]\n\n\nPost-production\nThe short production schedule and looming release date meant Reitman edited the film while it was being shot There was often only time for a few takes [9] [16] Reitman sometimes found making an effects-laden movie frustrating, as the special effects had to be storyboarded and filmed in advance; there was no option to go back and produce new scenes As Gross described it: \" [Y]ou storyboard in advance, that's like editing in advance You've got a scene, they're going to approve that scene, and we're going to spend nine months doing that cut There's no second takes, no outtakes, there's no coverage You can cut stuff, but you can't add stuff It made  [Reitman] so confined that it really bothered him\" [41]\n\n\nMusic\nThe Ghostbusters score was composed by Elmer Bernstein and performed by the 72-person Hollywood Studio Symphony orchestra at The Village in West Los Angeles, California It was orchestrated by David Spear and Bernstein's son Peter [43] [44] Elmer Bernstein had previously scored several of Reitman's films and joined the project early on, before all the cast had been signed [43] Reitman wanted a grounded, realistic score and did not want the music to tell the audience when something was funny [41] Bernstein used the ondes Martenot (effectively a keyboard equivalent of a theremin) to produce the \"eerie\" effect Bernstein had to bring a musician from England to play the instrument because there were so few trained ondists He also used three Yamaha DX7 synthesizers [43] [44] In a 1985 interview Bernstein described Ghostbusters as the most difficult score he had written, finding it challenging to balance the varying comedic and serious tones He created an \"antic\" theme for the Ghostbusters he described as \"cute, without being really way out\" He found the latter parts of the film easier to score, aiming to make it sound \"awesome and mystical\" [43]\n\n\nDesign\nDuring the thirteen-month production, all the major special effects studios were working on other films Those that remained were too small to work on the approximately 630 individual effects shots needed for Ghostbusters At the same time, special effects cinematographer Richard Edlund planned to leave Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) and start his own business Reitman convinced Columbia to collaborate with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), which also needed an effects studio, to advance Edlund $5 million to establish his own company, Boss Film Studios [8] [9] According to Edlund, lawyers used much of the setup time finalizing the contract, leaving only ten months remaining to build the effects studio, shoot the scenes, and composite the images [8] The Boss Film Studios' team was split to complete work on Ghostbusters and MGM's science-fiction film 2010: The Year We Make Contact [1] The $5 million effects came in at $700,000 over budget [16] The strict filming schedule meant most of the effects shots were captured in one take [41] Gross oversaw both the creation of Boss Film Studios, and the hiring of many conceptual designers including comic book artists Tanino Liberatore (whose work went unused) and Bernie Wrightson (who helped conceive several ghost designs), and storyboarder Thom Enriquez, whose designs contributed to the \"Onion Head ghost\" [20]\n\n\nCreature effects\nEdlund's previous work on the supernatural horror film Poltergeist (1982) served as a reference for the ghost designs in Ghostbusters Gross said it was difficult to balance making the ghosts a genuine threat while fitting the film's more comedic tone [47] [48] Special effects artist Steve Johnson sculpted the gluttonous, slimy, green ghost then known as the \"Onion Head ghost\" on set due to the puppet's unpleasant smell [13] [49] The creature was given the name \"Slimer\" in the 1986 animated television series The Real Ghostbusters [1] The Slimer design took six months and cost approximately $300,000 After struggling to complete a design due to executive interference, Johnson took at least three grams of cocaine and completed the final design in one night, based in part on Aykroyd's and Ramis's wish for the creature to homage Belushi [e] The full-size foam rubber puppet was worn by Mark Wilson and filmed against a black background Puppeteers manipulated the model's movements with cables [1] [50] [51]\n\n\nTechnology and equipment\nHardware consultant Stephen Dane was responsible for designing most of the Ghostbusters' iconic equipment, including the \"proton packs\" used to wrangle ghosts, ghost traps, and their vehicle, the Ectomobile The equipment had to be designed and built in the six weeks before filming began in September 1983 [33] [57] Inspired by a military issue flamethrower, the \"proton packs\" consisted of a handheld proton stream firing \"neutrino wand\" connected by a hose to a backpack said to contain a nuclear accelerator [12] [58] Dane said he \"went home and got foam pieces and just threw a bunch of stuff together to get the look It was highly machined, but it had to look off-the-shelf and military surplus\" [59]\n\n\nLogo and sets\nIn the script, Aykroyd described the Ghostbusters clothing and vehicle as bearing a no symbol with a ghost trapped in it, crediting the Viking with the original concept [65] [66] The final design fell to Gross, who had volunteered to serve as art director As the logo would be required for props and sets, it needed to be finalized quickly, and Gross worked with Boss Film artist and creature design consultant Brent Boates who drew the final concept, and R/GA animated the logo for the film's opening According to Gross, two versions of the logo exist, with one having \"ghostbusters\" written across the diagonal part of the sign Gross did not like how it looked and flipped the diagonal bar to read top left to bottom right instead, but they later removed the wording According to Gross, this is the correct version of the sign that was used throughout Europe The bottom left to top right version was used in the United States as that was the design of the No symbol there [65]\n\n\nRelease\nGhostbusters was screened for test audiences on February 3, 1984, with unfinished effects shots to determine if the comedy worked Reitman was still concerned audiences would not react well to the Marshmallow Man because of its deviation from the realism of the rest of the film [15] Reitman recalled that approximately 200 people were recruited off the streets to view the film in a theater on the Burbank lot It was during the opening library scene Reitman knew the film worked Audiences reacted with fear, laughs, and applause as the Librarian Ghost transformed into a monster [15] The fateful Marshmallow scene was met with a similar reaction, and Reitman knew he would not have to perform any re-shoots [9] [15] The screening for fellow industry members fared less well Price recalled laughing as the rest of the audience sat deadpan; he rationalized an industry audience wants failure Murray and Aykroyd's agent Michael Ovitz recalled an executive telling him, \"Don't worry: we all make mistakes\", while Roberto Goizueta, chairman of Columbia's parent, The Coca-Cola Company, said: \"Gee, we're going to lose our shirts\" [8] [70]\n\n\nTest screening and marketing\nGhostbusters was screened for test audiences on February 3, 1984, with unfinished effects shots to determine if the comedy worked Reitman was still concerned audiences would not react well to the Marshmallow Man because of its deviation from the realism of the rest of the film [15] Reitman recalled that approximately 200 people were recruited off the streets to view the film in a theater on the Burbank lot It was during the opening library scene Reitman knew the film worked Audiences reacted with fear, laughs, and applause as the Librarian Ghost transformed into a monster [15] The fateful Marshmallow scene was met with a similar reaction, and Reitman knew he would not have to perform any re-shoots [9] [15] The screening for fellow industry members fared less well Price recalled laughing as the rest of the audience sat deadpan; he rationalized an industry audience wants failure Murray and Aykroyd's agent Michael Ovitz recalled an executive telling him, \"Don't worry: we all make mistakes\", while Roberto Goizueta, chairman of Columbia's parent, The Coca-Cola Company, said: \"Gee, we're going to lose our shirts\" [8] [70]\n\n\nBox office\nThe premiere of Ghostbusters took place on June 7, 1984, at the Avco Cinema in Westwood, Los Angeles, before its wide release the following day across 1,339 theaters in the United States (U.S.) and Canada [1] [74] During its opening weekend in the U.S and Canada, the film earned $13.6 million—an average of $10,040 per theater [f] It finished as the number one film of the weekend, ahead of premiering horror-comedy Gremlins ($12.5 million), and the adventure film Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom ($12 million), in its third week of release [74] [75] The gross increased to $23.1 million during its first week, [g] becoming the first major success for the studio since Tootsie (1982) [h] The film remained number one for seven consecutive weeks, grossing $146.5 million, before being ousted by Purple Rain in early August [78] [79] [80]\n\n\nReception\nGhostbusters opened to generally positive reviews [1] [95] Roger Ebert gave it three and a half out of four, citing it as a rare example of successfully combining a special effects-driven blockbuster with \"sly\" dialogue Ebert noted the effects existed to serve the actors' performances and not the reverse, saying it is \"an exception to the general rule that big special effects can wreck a comedy\" He also cited Ghostbusters as a rare mainstream film with many quotable lines [96] Writing for Newsday, Joseph Gelmis described the Ghostbusters as an adolescent fantasy, comparing their firehouse base to the Batcave with a fireman's pole and an Ectomobile on the ground floor [97]\n\n\nCritical response\nGhostbusters opened to generally positive reviews [1] [95] Roger Ebert gave it three and a half out of

from The Woman in Red), and Best Visual Effects for John Bruno, Richard Edlund, Chuck Gaspar and Mark Vargo (losing to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom) [12] [109] That year, it was nominated for three Golden Globe Awards: Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy (losing to Romancing the Stone), [110] Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for Murray (losing to Dudley Moore in Micki & Maude), [111] and Best Original Song for Parker Jr., (losing again to \"I Just Called to Say I Love You\") [112] \"Ghostbusters\" went on to win the BAFTA Award for Best Original Song, and Edlund was nominated for Special Visual Effects (losing again to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom) [113] It won Best Fantasy Film at the 12th Saturn Awards [114]\n\n\nPost-release\nRay Parker Jr.'s \"Ghostbusters\" spent three weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1984 and 21 weeks on the charts altogether [45] [115] The song is estimated to have added $20 million to the film's box office [116] Reitman directed the successful \"Ghostbusters\" music video that included several celebrity cameos [1] [45] [46] Shortly after the film's release, Huey Lewis sued Parker Jr., for plagiarizing his 1983 song \"I Want a New Drug\" [1] [46] The case was settled out of court in 1985 [10] [46] Parker Jr later sued Lewis for breaching a confidentiality agreement about the case [46] In 1984, the filmmakers were also sued by Harvey Cartoons, the owner of Casper the Friendly Ghost for $50 million and the destruction of all copies of the film Harvey alleged the Ghostbusters logo was based on their character Fatso The case was decided in Columbia's favor [117] [118]\n\n\nAftermath\nRay Parker Jr.'s \"Ghostbusters\" spent three weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in

[118]\n\n\nHome media\nGhostbusters was released on VHS in October 1985 Paramount Pictures had scheduled the equally popular Beverly Hills Cop to release the day before Ghostbusters, forcing Columbia to release it a week earlier to avoid direct competition Priced at $79.95, Ghostbusters was predicted to sell well but be outperformed by Beverly Hills Cop because of its lower $29.95 price [n] The release was supported by a $1 million advertising campaign The film was the tenth best-selling VHS during its launch week Columbia earned approximately $20 million selling the rights to manufacture and distribute the VHS [122] [123] [124] A record 410,000 VHS units were ordered (exceeded a few months later by Rambo: First Blood Part II's 425,000 unit order) By February 1986, it was estimated to have sold 400,000 copies and earned $32 million in revenue, making it the third best-selling VHS of 1985, after Star Trek III: The Search for Spock (425,000 units, $12.7 million) and Beverly Hills Cop (1.4 million units sold, $41.9 million) [125] [126]\n\n\nMerchandise\nDeveloping merchandise for a film was still a relatively new practice at the time of Ghostbusters' release, and it was only following the success of Star Wars merchandise that other studios attempted to duplicate the idea [138] The unexpected success of Ghostbusters meant Columbia did not have a comprehensive merchandising plan in place to fully capitalize on the film at the peak of its popularity [139] They were able to generate additional revenue, however, by applying the popular \"no ghosts\" logo to a variety of products [140] Much of the merchandising success came from licensing the rights to other companies based on the success of the 1986 animated spin-off The Real Ghostbusters [139] Merchandise based directly on the film did not initially sell well until The Real Ghostbusters, which on its own helped generate up to $200 million in revenue in 1988, the same year the Ghostbusters proton pack was the most popular toy in the United Kingdom [141] [138] A successful Ghostbusters video game was released alongside the film [142] The film also received two novelizations, Ghostbusters by Larry Milne (released with the film), and Ghostbusters: The Supernatural Spectacular by Richard Mueller (released in 1985) [5] \"Making Ghostbusters\", an annotated script by Ramis, was released in 1985 [8]\n\n\nThematic analysis\nAs described by academic Christine Alice Corcos, Ghostbusters is \"a satire on academia, intellectuals, city government, yuppies, tax professionals, and apathetic New Yorkers\" [155] It has also been analyzed as an era-appropriate example of Republican, libertarian, or neo-liberal ideology, in particular, Reagan-era economics popularized by United States President Ronald Reagan [o] Reaganomics focused on limited government spending and deregulation in favor of a free market provided by the private sector of entrepreneurship, profit motives, and individual initiative [157] [158] [159] Analysts point to the premise of a small private business obstructed by an arrogant, incompetent bureaucrat (Walter Peck) from a government agency Peck's interference compromises the Ghostbusters' ghost containment unit, unleashing spirits upon the city and ushering in Gozer's arrival [157] [158] When Peck arrives to shutter the Ghostbusters, Egon affirms \"this is private property\" [159] In this sense, it is Peck, not Gozer, who represents the true villain [158] [159] Others note that after losing their university jobs, Aykroyd's character is upset because their public sector funding required little of them He had worked in the private sector where \"they expect results\" [159] Reitman considered himself a \"conservative-slash-libertarian\" [159] [160]\n\n\nCapitalism and private industry\nAs described by academic Christine Alice Corcos, Ghostbusters is \"a satire on academia, intellectuals, city government, yuppies, tax professionals, and apathetic New Yorkers\" [155] It has also been analyzed as an era-appropriate example of Republican, libertarian, or neo-liberal ideology, in particular, Reagan-era economics popularized by United

\"conservative-slash-libertarian\" [159] [160]\n\n\nInequality, immigrants, and pollution\nThe ghosts in Ghostbusters have been interpreted as analogs for crime, homelessness, pollution, and faltering infrastructure and public services [164] [168] Corcos discussed Ghostbusters's negative take on government and environmental regulation [169] She wrote that the ghosts represent pollutants, remnants of environmental damage, and a reflection of real-life governments refusing to acknowledge environmental problems that affect humanity [170] The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) explicitly does not believe in the ghosts or \"waste\" the Ghostbusters are collecting and, in turn, the Ghostbusters do not believe the EPA deserves obedience or compliance because of its ignorance [171] Even though the Ghostbusters have condensed a widespread problem into a small area, they have constructed a dangerous containment unit in a heavily populated area while possessing the unique knowledge to understand how much danger it poses [172] However, Peck's rigid adherence to government regulation results in him turning off the unit and creating a more dangerous situation [173]\n\n\nImmaturity\nAuthor Nicole Matthews argued the need to present a film targeted at both adults and children leads to the central characters being infantilized and immature [176] Critic Vincent Canby said a film's profitability was dependent on addressing children who \"can identify with a 40-year-old-man with a mid-life crisis and 40-year-old-men in midlife crises who long to fight pirates with cardboard cutlasses\" [177] Ghostbusters presents Venkman's immature comedic sarcasm as a means of disarming situations and furthering the narrative Author Jim Whalley wrote that this presents a clear tonal shift in the sequel; in Ghostbusters, the characters are hired workers just doing their job, whereas in Ghostbusters II they are noble heroes saving the city In doing so, Ghostbusters II reimagines Venkman's persona as comedic relief instead of a practical tool [178] The primarily male audience also results in female characters that are either absent or not important to the overall story [179] Author Jane Crisp wrote that Dana encountering Zuul in her fridge presents a stereotypical view of women being associated with the home and kitchen [180]\n\n\nLegacy\nGhostbusters is considered one of the first blockbusters and is credited with refining the term to effectively create a new genre that mixed comedy, science fiction, horror, and thrills Ghostbusters also confirmed the merchandising success of Star Wars (1977) was not a fluke A successful, recognizable brand could be used to launch spin-offs, helping establish a business model in the film industry that has since become the status quo Once Ghostbusters' popularity was clear, the studio aggressively cultivated its profile, translating it into merchandising and other media such as television, extending its profitable lifetime long after the film had left theaters [140]\n\n\nCultural influence\nGhostbusters was considered a phenomenon and highly influential [p] The Ghostbusters' theme song was a hit, and Halloween of 1984 was dominated by children dressed as the titular protagonists [8] [140] [183] It had a significant effect on popular culture and is credited with inventing the special-effects driven comedy [q] Its basic premise of a particular genre mixed with comedy, and a team combating an otherworldly threat has been replicated with varying degrees of success in films like Men in Black (1997), Evolution (2001), The Watch (2012), R.I.P.D (2013), and Pixels (2015) [66] [184] [185] In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected Ghostbusters for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" Reitman responded: \"It's an honor to know that a movie that begins with a ghost in a library now has a spot on the shelves of the Library of Congress\" [186]\n\n\nCritical reassessment\nGhostbusters's positive reception has lasted well beyond its release, and it is considered one of the most important comedy films ever made [143] [208] It is listed in the 2013 film reference book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die [209] On its 30th anniversary in 2014, The Hollywood Reporter's entertainment industry-voted ranking named it the seventy-seventh best film of all time [210] That year, Time Out rated Ghostbusters five out of five, describing it as a \"cavalcade of pure joy\" [211] Empire's reader-voted list of the 100 Greatest Movies placed the film as number 68 [212] In 2014, Rolling Stone readers voted Ghostbusters the ninth-greatest film of the 1980s [213] Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes offers a 95% approval rating from 79 critics, with an average rating of 8.1/10 The site's consensus reads: \"An infectiously fun blend of special effects and comedy, with Bill Murray's hilarious deadpan performance leading a cast of great comic turns\" [214] The film also has a score of 71 out of 100 on Metacritic based on eight critical reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\" [215]\n\n\nSequels and adaptations\n\nThe film's success spawned the Ghostbusters franchise, comprising animated television shows, film sequels, and reboot [236] Ghostbusters was followed by the 1986 animated television series The Real Ghostbusters It ran for 140 episodes over seven seasons across six years, and itself spawned a spin-off Slimer-centric sub-series, comic books, and merchandise It was followed by a sequel series, 1997's Extreme Ghostbusters [236] [237] A film sequel, Ghostbusters II, was released in 1989 Despite breaking box office records and attracting an estimated two million more people to its opening than Ghostbusters, the sequel earned less than the original and received a less enthusiastic response [238] [239] Even so, the popularity of the actors and characters led to discussion of a third film [239] The concept failed to progress for many years because Murray was reluctant to participate In a 2009 interview, he said: \n\nNotes\nBooks\n\n\nReferences\nBooks\n\n\nWorks cited\nBooks\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "# Ghostbusters\n\nGhostbusters is a 1984 American supernatural comedy film directed by Ivan Reitman and written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis. The film stars Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis as three paranormal investigators who start a ghost-catching business in New York City. The film was a critical and commercial success, grossing over $295 million at the box office and becoming one of the highest-grossing films of 1984.\n\n## Plot\n\nThe film begins with three paranormal investigators, Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), and Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis), being fired from their jobs at Columbia University for their unorthodox methods of research. The trio decides to start their own ghost-catching business, Ghostbusters, operating out of a disused firehouse in Manhattan.\n\n## Cast\n\nThe main cast of Ghostbusters includes:\n\n* Bill Murray as Peter Venkman\n* Dan Aykroyd as Ray Stantz\n* Harold Ramis as Egon Spengler\n* Sigourney Weaver as Dana Barrett\n* Rick Moranis as Louis Tully\n* Annie Potts as Janine Melnitz\n* Ernie Hudson as Winston Zeddemore\n\n## Production\n\nGhostbusters was inspired by Dan Aykroyd's fascination with the paranormal, which he inherited from his father, who later wrote the book A History of Ghosts. Aykroyd was also drawn to the idea of modernizing the comedic ghost films of the mid-20th century by comics such as Abbott and Costello (Hold That Ghost, 1941), Bob Hope (The Ghost Breakers, 1940) and the Bowery Boys (Ghost Chasers, 1951).\n\n## Writing\n\nAykroyd, Ramis, and Reitman began reworking the script, first at Reitman's office, then sequestering themselves and their families on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. Aykroyd had a home there, and they worked day and night in his basement for about two weeks. The initial draft was completed when they left the Vineyard in mid-July 1983, and a third and near-final draft was ready by early August.\n\n## Cast and characters\n\nMurray was considered essential to Ghostbusters' potential success, but he was known for not committing to projects until late. Price agreed to fund Murray's passion project The Razor's Edge, believing if it failed it would lose little money, and hoping the gesture would secure Murray's commitment to Ghostbusters. Michael Keaton, Chevy Chase, Tom Hanks, Robin Williams, Steve Guttenberg, and Richard Pryor were also considered for the role.\n\n## Filming\n\nPrincipal photography began in New York City on October 28, 1983. On the first day, Reitman brought Murray to the set, still unsure if he had read the script. Filming in New York lasted for approximately six weeks, finishing just before Christmas. Reitman was conscious they had to complete the New York phase before they encountered inhospitable December weather.\n\n## Post-production\n\nThe short production schedule and looming release date meant Reitman edited the film while it was being shot. There was often only time for a few takes. Reitman sometimes found making an effects-laden movie frustrating, as the special effects had to be storyboarded and filmed in advance; there was no option to go back and produce new scenes.\n\n## Music\n\nThe Ghostbusters score was composed by Elmer Bernstein and performed by the 72-person Hollywood Studio Symphony orchestra at The Village in West Los Angeles, California. It was orchestrated by David Spear and Bernstein's son Peter. Elmer Bernstein had previously scored several of Reitman's films and joined the project early on, before all the cast had been signed.\n\n## Design\n\nDuring the thirteen-month production, all the major special effects studios were working on other films. Those that remained were too small to work on the approximately 630 individual effects shots needed for Ghostbusters. At the same time, special effects cinematographer Richard Edlund planned to leave Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) and start his own business. Reitman convinced Columbia to collaborate with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), which also needed an effects studio, to advance Edlund $5 million to establish his own company, Boss Film Studios.\n\n## Logo and sets\n\nThe Ghostbusters logo was designed by art director Richard Edlund and Brent Boates. The logo was originally intended to be a simple, one-color design, but it was eventually modified to include the iconic \"No Ghosts\" logo.\n\n## Release\n\nGhostbusters was screened for test audiences on February 3, 1984, with unfinished effects shots to determine if the comedy worked. The premiere of Ghostbusters took place on June 7, 1984, at the Avco Cinema in Westwood, Los Angeles, before its wide release the following day across 1,339 theaters in the United States (U.S.) and Canada.\n\n## Box office\n\nDuring its opening weekend in the U.S and Canada, the film earned $13.6 million—an average of $10,040 per theater. It finished as the number one film of the weekend, ahead of premiering horror-comedy Gremlins ($12.5 million), and the adventure film Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom ($12 million), in its third week of release.\n\n## Reception\n\nGhostbusters opened to generally positive reviews. Roger Ebert gave it three and a half out of four, citing it as a rare example of successfully combining a special effects-driven blockbuster with \"sly\" dialogue. Ebert noted the effects existed to serve the actors' performances and not the reverse, saying it is \"an exception to the general rule that big special effects can wreck a comedy\".\n\n## Accolades\n\nGhostbusters was nominated for two Academy Awards in 1985: Best Original Song for \"Ghostbusters\" by Ray Parker Jr. (losing to Stevie Wonder's \"I Just Called to Say I Love You\" from The Woman in Red), and Best Visual Effects for John Bruno, Richard Edlund, Chuck Gaspar and Mark Vargo (losing to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom).\n\n## Post-release\n\nGhostbusters was released on VHS in October 1985. The film was the tenth best-selling VHS during its launch week, and it earned approximately $20 million selling the rights to manufacture and distribute the VHS.

firehouse They develop high-tech nuclear-powered equipment to capture and contain ghosts, although business is initially slow.\n\n\nCast\nIn addition to the main cast, Ghostbusters features David

contact the dead; and his great-grandfather, a renowned spiritualist In 1981, Aykroyd read an article on quantum physics and parapsychology in The Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research, which gave him the idea of trapping ghosts He was also drawn to the idea of modernizing the comedic ghost films of the mid-20th century by comics such as Abbott and Costello (Hold That

to rework his script; he considered himself a \"kitchen sink\" writer who created the funny situations and paranormal jargon, while Ramis refined the jokes and dialogue They wrote separately, then rewrote each other's drafts Many scenes had to be cut, including an asylum haunted by celebrities, and an illegal ghost-storage facility in a New Jersey gas station [8] Their initial draft was completed when they left the Vineyard in mid-July 1983, and a third and near-final draft was ready by early August [8] [9] [15] When Murray flew to New York after filming The Razor's Edge (1984) to meet Aykroyd and Ramis, he offered little input on the script or his character Having written for Murray multiple times, Ramis said he knew \"how to handle his character's voice\" [8]\n\n\nCast and

Ramis was inspired by the cover of a journal on abstract architecture for Egon's appearance, featuring a man wearing a three-piece tweed suit and wire-rim glasses, his hair standing straight up He took the character's first name from a Hungarian refugee with whom he attended school, and the surname from German historian Oswald Spengler [10] Apart from the three main stars, Medjuck was largely

violence, and Los Angeles was seen as the center of the entertainment industry In a 2014 interview, Reitman said he chose New York because \"I wanted the film to be .. my New York movie\" [8] As Reitman was working with comedians, he encouraged improvisation, adapting multiple takes and keeping the cast creations that worked, but directing them back to the script

Bernstein had previously scored several of Reitman's films and joined the project early on, before all the cast had been signed [43] Reitman wanted a grounded, realistic score and did not want the music to tell the audience when something was funny [41] Bernstein used the ondes Martenot (effectively a keyboard equivalent of a theremin) to produce the \"eerie\" effect Bernstein had to bring a musician from England to play the instrument because there were so few trained ondists He also used three Yamaha DX7 synthesizers [43] [44] In a 1985 interview Bernstein described Ghostbusters as the most difficult score he had written, finding it challenging to balance the varying comedic and serious tones He created an \"antic\" theme for the Ghostbusters he described as \"cute, without being really way out\" He found the latter parts of the film easier to score, aiming to make it sound \"awesome and mystical\" [43]\n\n\nDesign\nDuring the thirteen-month production, all the major special effects studios were working on other films Those that remained were too small to work on the approximately 630 individual effects shots needed for Ghostbusters At the same time, special effects cinematographer Richard Edlund planned to leave Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) and start his own business Reitman convinced Columbia to collaborate with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), which also needed an effects studio, to advance Edlund $5 million to establish his own company, Boss Film Studios [8] [9] According to Edlund, lawyers used much of the setup time finalizing the contract, leaving only ten months remaining to build the effects studio, shoot the scenes, and composite the images [8] The Boss Film Studios' team was split to complete work on Ghostbusters and MGM's science-fiction film 2010: The Year We Make Contact [1] The $5 million effects came in at $700,000 over budget [16] The strict filming schedule meant most of the effects shots were captured in one take [41] Gross oversaw both the creation of Boss Film Studios, and the hiring of many conceptual designers including comic book artists Tanino Liberatore (whose work went unused) and Bernie Wrightson (who helped conceive several ghost designs), and storyboarder Thom Enriquez, whose designs contributed to the \"Onion Head ghost\" [20]\n\n\nCreature effects\nEdlund's previous work on the supernatural horror film Poltergeist (1982) served as a reference for the ghost designs in Ghostbusters Gross said it was difficult to balance making the ghosts a genuine threat while fitting the film's more comedic tone [47] [48] Special effects artist Steve Johnson sculpted the gluttonous, slimy, green ghost then known as the \"Onion Head ghost\" on set due to the puppet's unpleasant smell [13] [49] The creature was given the name \"Slimer\" in the 1986 animated television series The Real Ghostbusters [1] The Slimer design took six months and cost approximately $300,000 After struggling to complete a design due to executive interference, Johnson took at least three grams of cocaine and completed the final design in one night, based in part on Aykroyd's and Ramis's wish for the creature to homage Belushi [e] The full-size foam rubber puppet was worn by Mark Wilson and filmed against a black background Puppeteers manipulated the model's movements with cables [1] [50] [51]\n\n\nTechnology and equipment\nHardware consultant Stephen Dane was responsible for designing most of the Ghostbusters' iconic equipment, including the \"proton packs\" used to wrangle ghosts, ghost traps, and their vehicle, the Ectomobile The equipment had to be designed and built in the six weeks before filming began in September 1983 [33] [57] Inspired by a military issue flamethrower, the \"proton packs\" consisted of a handheld proton stream firing \"neutrino wand\" connected by a hose to a backpack said to contain a nuclear accelerator [12] [58] Dane said he \"went home and got foam pieces and just threw a bunch of stuff together to get the look It was highly machined, but it had to look off-the-shelf and military surplus\" [59]\n\n\nLogo and sets\nIn the script, Aykroyd described the Ghostbusters clothing and vehicle as bearing a no symbol with a ghost trapped in it, crediting the Viking with the original concept [65] [66] The final design fell to Gross, who had volunteered to serve as art director As the logo would be required for props and sets, it needed to be finalized quickly, and Gross worked with Boss Film artist and creature design consultant Brent Boates who drew the final concept, and R/GA animated the logo for the film's opening According to Gross, two versions of the logo exist, with one having \"ghostbusters\" written across the diagonal part of the sign Gross did not like how it looked and flipped the diagonal bar to read top left to bottom right instead, but they later removed the wording According to Gross, this is the correct version of the sign that was used throughout Europe The bottom left to top right version was used in the United States as that was the design of the No symbol there [65]\n\n\nRelease\nGhostbusters was screened for test audiences on February 3, 1984, with unfinished effects shots to determine if the comedy worked Reitman was still concerned audiences would not react well to the Marshmallow Man because of its deviation from the realism of the rest of the film [15] Reitman recalled that approximately 200 people were recruited off the streets to view the film in a theater on the Burbank lot It was during the opening library scene Reitman knew the film worked Audiences reacted with fear, laughs, and applause as the Librarian Ghost transformed into a monster [15] The fateful Marshmallow scene was met with a similar reaction, and Reitman knew he would not have to perform any re-shoots [9] [15] The screening for fellow industry members fared less well Price recalled laughing as the rest of the audience sat deadpan; he rationalized an industry audience wants failure Murray and Aykroyd's agent Michael Ovitz recalled an executive telling him, \"Don't worry: we all make mistakes\", while Roberto Goizueta, chairman of Columbia's parent, The Coca-Cola Company, said: \"Gee, we're going to lose our shirts\" [8] [70]\n\n\nTest screening and marketing\nGhostbusters was screened for test audiences on February

Angeles, before its wide release the following day across 1,339 theaters in the United States (U.S.) and Canada [1] [74] During its opening weekend in the U.S and Canada, the film earned $13.6 million—an average of $10,040 per theater [f] It finished as the number one film of the weekend, ahead of premiering horror-comedy Gremlins ($12.5 million), and the adventure film Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom ($12 million), in its third week of release [74] [75] The gross increased to $23.1 million during its first week, [g] becoming the first major success for the studio since Tootsie (1982) [h] The film remained number one for seven consecutive weeks, grossing $146.5 million, before being ousted by Purple Rain in early August [78] [79] [80]\n\n\nReception\nGhostbusters opened to generally positive reviews [1] [95] Roger Ebert gave it three and a half out of four, citing it as a rare example of successfully combining a special effects-driven blockbuster with \"sly\" dialogue Ebert noted the effects existed to serve the actors' performances and not the reverse, saying it is \"an exception to the general rule that big special effects can wreck a comedy\" He also cited Ghostbusters as a rare mainstream film with many quotable lines [96] Writing for Newsday, Joseph Gelmis described the Ghostbusters as an adolescent fantasy, comparing their firehouse base to the Batcave with a fireman's pole and an Ectomobile on the ground floor [97]\n\n\nCritical response\nGhostbusters opened to generally positive reviews [1] [95] Roger Ebert gave it three and a half out of

[97]\n\n\nAccolades\nGhostbusters was nominated for two Academy Awards in 1985: Best Original Song for \"Ghostbusters\" by Ray Parker Jr (losing to Stevie Wonder's \"I Just Called to Say I Love You\" from The Woman in Red), and Best Visual Effects for John Bruno, Richard Edlund, Chuck Gaspar and Mark Vargo (losing to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom) [12] [109] That year, it was nominated for three Golden Globe Awards: Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy (losing to Romancing the Stone), [110] Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for Murray (losing to Dudley Moore in Micki & Maude), [111] and Best Original Song for Parker Jr., (losing again to \"I Just Called to Say I Love You\") [112] \"Ghostbusters\" went on to win the BAFTA Award for Best Original Song, and Edlund was nominated for Special Visual Effects (losing again to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom) [113] It won Best Fantasy Film at the 12th Saturn Awards [114]\n\n\nPost-release\nRay Parker Jr.'s \"Ghostbusters\" spent three weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1984 and 21 weeks on the charts altogether [45] [115] The song is estimated to have added $20 million to the film's box office [116] Reitman directed the successful \"Ghostbusters\" music video that included several celebrity cameos [1] [45] [46] Shortly after the film's release, Huey Lewis sued Parker Jr., for plagiarizing his 1983 song \"I Want a New Drug\" [1] [46] The case was settled out of court in 1985 [10] [46] Parker Jr later sued Lewis for breaching a confidentiality agreement about the case [46] In 1984, the filmmakers were also sued by Harvey Cartoons, the owner of Casper the Friendly Ghost for $50 million and the destruction of all copies of the film Harvey alleged the Ghostbusters logo was based on their character Fatso The case was decided in Columbia's favor [117] [118]\n\n\nAftermath\nRay Parker Jr.'s \"Ghostbusters\" spent three weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in

[118]\n\n\nHome media\nGhostbusters was released on VHS in October 1985 Paramount Pictures had scheduled the equally popular Beverly Hills Cop to release the day before Ghostbusters, forcing Columbia to release it a week earlier to avoid direct competition Priced at $79.95, Ghostbusters was predicted to sell well but be outperformed by Beverly Hills Cop because of its lower $29.95 price [n] The release was supported by a $1 million advertising campaign The film was the tenth best-selling VHS during its launch week Columbia earned approximately $20 million selling the rights to manufacture and distribute the VHS [122] [123] [124] A record 410,000 VHS units were ordered (exceeded a few months later by Rambo: First Blood Part II's 425,000 unit order) By February 1986, it was estimated to have sold 400,000 copies and earned $32 million in revenue, making it the third best-selling VHS of 1985, after Star Trek III: The Search for Spock (425,000 units, $12.7 million) and Beverly Hills Cop (1.4 million units sold, $41.9 million) [125] [126]\n\n\nMerchandise\nDeveloping merchandise for a film was still a relatively new practice at the time of Ghostbusters' release, and it was only following the success of Star Wars merchandise that other studios attempted to duplicate the idea [138] The unexpected success of Ghostbusters meant Columbia did not have a comprehensive merchandising plan in place to fully capitalize on the film at the peak of its popularity [139] They were able to generate additional revenue, however, by applying the popular \"no ghosts\" logo to a variety of products [140] Much of the merchandising success came from licensing the rights to other companies based on the success of the 1986 animated spin-off The Real Ghostbusters [139] Merchandise based directly on the film did not initially sell well until The Real Ghostbusters, which on its own helped generate up to $200 million in revenue in 1988, the same year the Ghostbusters proton pack was the most popular toy in the United Kingdom [141] [138] A successful Ghostbusters video game was released alongside the film [142] The film also received two novelizations, Ghostbusters by Larry Milne (released with the film), and Ghostbusters: The Supernatural Spectacular by Richard Mueller (released in 1985) [5] \"Making Ghostbusters\", an annotated script by Ramis, was released in 1985 [8]\n\n\nThematic analysis\nAs described by academic Christine Alice Corcos, Ghostbusters is \"a satire on academia, intellectuals, city government, yuppies, tax professionals, and apathetic New Yorkers\" [155] It has also been analyzed as an era-appropriate example of Republican, libertarian, or neo-liberal ideology, in particular, Reagan-era economics popularized by United States President Ronald Reagan [o] Reaganomics focused on limited government spending and deregulation in favor of a free market provided by the private sector of entrepreneurship, profit motives, and individual initiative [157] [158] [159] Analysts point to the premise of a small private business obstructed by an arrogant, incompetent bureaucrat (Walter Peck) from a government agency Peck's interference compromises the Ghostbusters' ghost containment unit, unleashing spirits upon the city and ushering in Gozer's arrival [157] [158] When Peck arrives to shutter the Ghostbusters, Egon affirms \"this is private property\" [159] In this sense, it is Peck, not Gozer, who represents the true villain [158] [159] Others note that after losing their university jobs, Aykroyd's character is upset because their public sector funding required little of them He had worked in the private sector where \"they expect results\" [159] Reitman considered himself a \"conservative-slash-libertarian\" [159] [160]\n\n\nCapitalism and private industry\nAs described by academic Christine Alice Corcos, Ghostbusters is \"a satire on academia, intellectuals, city government, yuppies, tax professionals, and apathetic New Yorkers\" [155] It has also been analyzed as an era-appropriate example of Republican, libertarian, or neo-liberal ideology, in particular, Reagan-era economics popularized by United States President Ronald Reagan [o] Reaganomics focused on limited government spending and deregulation in favor of a free market provided by the private sector of entrepreneurship, profit motives, and

upset because their public sector funding required little of them He had worked in the private sector where \"they expect results\" [159] Reitman considered himself a \"conservative-slash-libertarian\" [159] [160]\n\n\nInequality, immigrants, and pollution\nThe ghosts in Ghostbusters have been interpreted as analogs for crime, homelessness, pollution, and faltering infrastructure and public services [164] [168] Corcos discussed Ghostbusters's negative take on government and environmental regulation [169] She wrote that the ghosts represent pollutants, remnants of environmental damage, and a reflection of real-life governments refusing to acknowledge environmental problems that affect humanity [170] The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) explicitly does not believe in the ghosts or \"waste\" the Ghostbusters are collecting and, in turn, the Ghostbusters do not believe the EPA deserves obedience or compliance because of its ignorance [171] Even though the Ghostbusters have condensed a widespread problem into a small area, they have constructed a dangerous containment unit in a heavily populated area while possessing the unique knowledge to understand how much danger it poses [172] However, Peck's rigid adherence to government regulation results in him turning off the unit and creating a more dangerous situation [173]\n\n\nImmaturity\nAuthor Nicole Matthews argued the need to present a film targeted at both adults and children leads to the central characters being infantilized and immature [176] Critic Vincent Canby said a film's profitability was dependent on addressing children who \"can identify with a 40-year-old-man with a mid-life crisis and 40-year-old-men in midlife crises who long to fight pirates with cardboard cutlasses\" [177] Ghostbusters presents Venkman's immature comedic sarcasm as a means of disarming situations and furthering the narrative Author Jim Whalley wrote that this presents a clear tonal shift in the sequel; in Ghostbusters, the characters are hired workers just doing their job, whereas in Ghostbusters II they are noble heroes saving the city In doing so, Ghostbusters II reimagines Venkman's persona as comedic relief instead of a practical tool [178] The primarily male audience also results in female characters that are either absent or not important to the overall story [179] Author Jane Crisp wrote that Dana encountering Zuul in her fridge presents a stereotypical view of women being associated with the home and kitchen [180]\n\n\nLegacy\nGhostbusters is considered one of the first blockbusters and is credited with refining the term to effectively create a new genre that mixed comedy, science fiction, horror, and thrills Ghostbusters also confirmed the merchandising success of Star Wars (1977) was not a fluke A successful, recognizable brand could be used to launch spin-offs, helping establish a business model in the film industry that has since become the status quo Once Ghostbusters' popularity was clear, the studio aggressively cultivated its profile, translating it into merchandising and other media such as television, extending its profitable lifetime long after the film had left theaters [140]\n\n\nCultural influence\nGhostbusters was considered a phenomenon and highly influential [p] The Ghostbusters' theme song was a hit, and Halloween of 1984 was dominated by children dressed as the titular protagonists [8] [140] [183] It had a significant effect on popular culture and is credited with inventing the special-effects driven comedy [q] Its basic premise of a particular genre mixed with comedy, and a team combating an otherworldly threat has been replicated with varying degrees of success in films like Men in Black (1997), Evolution (2001), The Watch (2012), R.I.P.D (2013), and Pixels (2015) [66] [184] [185] In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected Ghostbusters for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" Reitman responded: \"It's an honor to know that a movie that begins with a ghost in a library now has a spot on the shelves of the Library of Congress\" [186]\n\n\nCritical reassessment\nGhostbusters's positive reception has lasted well beyond its release, and it is considered one of the most important comedy films ever made [143] [208] It is listed in the 2013 film reference book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die [209] On its 30th anniversary in 2014, The Hollywood Reporter's entertainment industry-voted ranking named it the seventy-seventh best film of all time [210] That year, Time Out rated Ghostbusters five out of five, describing it as a \"cavalcade of pure joy\" [211] Empire's reader-voted list of the 100 Greatest Movies placed the film as number 68 [212] In 2014, Rolling Stone readers voted Ghostbusters the ninth-greatest film of the 1980s [213] Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes offers a 95% approval rating from 79 critics, with an average rating of 8.1/10 The site's consensus reads: \"An infectiously fun blend of special effects and comedy, with Bill Murray's hilarious deadpan performance leading a cast of great comic turns\" [214] The film also has a score of 71 out of 100 on Metacritic based on eight critical reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\" [215]\n\n\nSequels and adaptations\n\nThe film's success spawned the Ghostbusters franchise, comprising animated television shows, film sequels, and reboot [236] Ghostbusters was followed by the 1986 animated television series The Real Ghostbusters It ran for 140 episodes over seven seasons across six years, and itself spawned a spin-off Slimer-centric sub-series, comic books, and merchandise It was followed by a sequel series, 1997's Extreme Ghostbusters [236] [237] A film sequel, Ghostbusters II, was released in 1989 Despite breaking box office records and attracting an estimated two million more people to its opening than Ghostbusters, the sequel earned less than the original and received a less enthusiastic response [238] [239] Even so, the popularity of the actors and characters led to discussion of a third film [239] The concept failed to progress for many years because Murray was reluctant to participate In a 2009 interview, he said: \n\nNotes\nBooks\n\n\nReferences\nBooks\n\n\nWorks cited\nBooks\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was born on July 4, 1968, to a Parsi family in Bombay (now Mumbai), Maharashtra, India.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nMistry was born to a Parsi family, a community of Zoroastrians who migrated to India from Persia in the 8th century. His parents, Pallonji Mistry and Patsy Perin Dubash, were both Irish citizens, with Pallonji being a construction magnate. Mistry had an elder brother, Shapoor Mistry, who is also an Irish citizen, and is married to Behroze Sethna, the daughter of Parsi lawyer Rusi Sethna. Mistry also has two sisters, Laila and Aloo. Laila is married to Rustom Jehangir, a London-based portfolio fund manager, while Aloo is married to Noel Tata, the half-Indian-Parsi, half-French-Catholic half-brother of Ratan Tata.\n\nMistry's family has a long history in India, with his ancestors arriving in the country in the 8th century. His great-great-grandfather, Nusserwanji Tata, was a successful businessman who founded the Tata Group. Mistry's parents were both well-educated and held prominent positions in their respective fields. His father was a successful construction magnate, while his mother was a lawyer.\n\n**Career**\n\nMistry joined the family construction company, Shapoorji Pallonji & Co Ltd, as a director in 1991. He is credited with the turnaround of the struggling Afcons Infrastructure in the years after its acquisition by Shapoorji Pallonji Group in 2000. Mistry had been managing director of Shapoorji Pallonji & Company, which is part of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group. He later became chairman of Tata Sons and the Tata Group.\n\n**Tata Sons**\n\nMistry joined the board of Tata Sons on September 1, 2006, a year after his father retired from it. He was a director of Tata Elxsi Limited, from September 1990 to October 2009, and a director of Tata Power Co Ltd until September 2006. During his tenure as chairman, Mistry oversaw significant changes in the company's operations and strategy. He implemented several initiatives to improve the company's performance and competitiveness.\n\n**2018 NCLT Verdict**\n\nIn July 2018, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) issued a verdict in favor of Tata Sons on charges of mismanagement levelled by Mistry in 2016, two months following his ousting as chairman, through a vote of no confidence. On July 10, Mistry stated that he would appeal the decision.\n\n**2019 NCLAT Verdict**\n\nIn December 2019, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal reinstated Mistry as the chairperson for Tata Sons for his remaining term, and declared that the appointment of TCS CEO Natarajan Chandrasekaran as executive chairman of Tata Sons was illegal. In January 2020, Tata Sons appealed to the Supreme Court against NCLAT's decision. Cyrus Mistry announced that he will not return to the Chairmanship of the conglomerate, but is interested in reserving his seat in the company's board. A three-judge bench comprising Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justices BR Gavai and Surya Kant stayed NCLAT's order while hearing Tata Sons' appeal on January 10, 2020.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nMistry was married to Rohiqa Chagla, the daughter of lawyer Iqbal Chagla and granddaughter of jurist M.C Chagla. Iqbal Chagla has strategized the course of action for Cyrus Mistry in the legal battle against The Tata Sons.\n\n**Death**\n\nOn September 4, 2022, Mistry and three members of the Pandole family visited the Iranshah Atash Behram at Udvada. The Zoroastrian high priest Khurshed Dastoor said the group had visited to offer prayers following the death of Dinshaw Pandole and Pallonji Mistry.\n\n**Investigation**\n\nA seven-member forensic investigation team investigated the cause of the crash and reached the conclusion that the car crash was caused by the \"faulty design\" of the bridge and the death of the occupants had occurred as they were not wearing seat belts. The team member said, \"We have concluded that there was an infrastructure issue that led to the crash. The bridge parapet wall was found to be protruding into the shoulder lane. The design has been found to be faulty.\" A three-laned road abruptly changed to a two-lane road with an L-shaped concrete divider. The concrete divider was up-to knee height and was not painted appropriately. The spot lacks road warnings and several crashes had occurred at the same spot in the past. Mistry's car had hit a divider at a spot with faulty road design. His death initiated a debate on the inconsistent road design and wearing of seatbelt by rear seat passengers. Union government announced that it will start penalising rear seat passengers with a fine of ₹ 1,000 if they were found not wearing seat belts.\n\nCyrus Mistry's death in a car crash on September 4, 2022, has led to a significant debate on the importance of road safety and the need for consistent and safe road design in India. The investigation into the cause of the crash has highlighted the importance of infrastructure planning and the need for strict enforcement of traffic rules to prevent such incidents in the future.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Cyrus_Mistry\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nMistry was born on 4 July 1968 [13] [14] to a Parsi family in Bombay (now Mumbai), Maharashtra, the younger son of Indian billionaire and construction magnate Pallonji Mistry by his wife Patsy Perin Dubash [15] [16] Both his parents belong to the Zoroastrian faith and have roots in India However, Mistry's mother was born in Ireland, and his father chose to take up Irish citizenship Mistry had an elder brother, Shapoor Mistry, who is also an Irish citizen, and is married to Behroze Sethna, the daughter of Parsi lawyer Rusi Sethna Mistry also has two sisters, Laila and Aloo Laila is married to Rustom Jehangir, a London-based portfolio fund manager [17] [18] [19] Aloo is married to Noel Tata, the half-Indian-Parsi, half-French-Catholic half-brother of Ratan Tata [20]\n\n\nCareer\nMistry joined the family construction company, Shapoorji Pallonji & Co Ltd as a director in 1991 [24] He is credited with the turnaround of the struggling Afcons Infrastructure in the years after its acquisition by Shapoorji Pallonji Group in 2000 [25] Mistry had been managing director of Shapoorji Pallonji & Company, which is part of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group He later became chairman of Tata Sons and the Tata Group [26] [27]\n\n\nTata Sons\nMistry joined the board of Tata Sons on 1 September 2006, a year after his father retired from it [1] He was a director of Tata Elxsi Limited, from September 1990 to October 2009, and a director of Tata Power Co Ltd until September 2006 [30]\n\n\n2018 NCLT verdict\nIn July 2018, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), which \"adjudicates issues relating to Indian companies,\" [36] issued a verdict in favour of Tata Sons on charges of mismanagement levelled by Mistry in 2016, two months following his ousting as chairman, through a vote of no confidence [37] On 10 July, Mistry stated that he would appeal the decision [38]\n\n\n2019 NCLAT verdict\nIn December 2019, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal reinstated Mistry as the chairperson for Tata Sons for his remaining term, and declared that the appointment of TCS CEO Natarajan Chandrasekaran as executive chairman of Tata Sons was illegal [39] In January 2020, Tata Sons appealed to the Supreme Court against NCLAT's decision [40] Cyrus Mistry announced that he will not return to the Chairmanship of the conglomerate, but is interested in reserving his seat in the company's board [41] A three-judge bench comprising Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justices BR Gavai and Surya Kant stayed NCLAT's order while hearing Tata Sons' appeal on 10 January 2020 [42] [43]\n\n\nPersonal life\nMistry was married to Rohiqa Chagla, the daughter of lawyer Iqbal Chagla and granddaughter of jurist M.C Chagla Iqbal Chagla has strategised the course of action for Cyrus Mistry in the legal battle against The Tata Sons [46]\n\n\nDeath\nOn 4 September 2022, Mistry and three members of the Pandole family visited the Iranshah Atash Behram at Udvada [48] The Zoroastrian high priest Khurshed Dastoor said the group had visited to offer prayers following the death of Dinshaw Pandole [49] and Pallonji Mistry [50]\n\n\nInvestigation\nA seven-member forensic investigation team investigated the cause of the crash and reached the conclusion that the car crash was caused by the \"faulty design\" of the bridge and the death of the occupants had occurred as they were not wearing seat belts [12] [53] The team member said, \"We have concluded that there was an infrastructure issue that led to the crash The bridge parapet wall was found to be protruding into the shoulder lane The design has been found to be faulty.\" [12] A three laned road abruptly changed to a two lane road with an L-shaped concrete divider The concrete divider was up-to knee height and was not painted appropriately The spot lacks road warnings and several crashes had occurred at the same spot in the past Mistry's car had hit a divider at a spot with faulty road design [57] [58] His death initiated a debate on the inconsistent road design and wearing of seatbelt by rear seat passengers [59] Union government announced that it will start penalising rear seat passengers with a fine of ₹  1,000 if they were found not wearing seat belts [citation needed]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

movie.'\"\n\n\nDevelopment\nFeige met with Johansson to discuss the direction of a Black Widow film in October 2017 Marvel then began meeting with writers for the project, including Jac Schaeffer and Jessica Gao [86] [87] Gao's pitch was influenced by Grosse Pointe Blank (1997), in which Romanoff would have been planted in a high school to assassinate a target and then 20 years later attends a high school reunion where she has to deal with the fallout of her earlier actions [87] The pitch heavily featured the character She-Hulk, and Marvel Studios executive Brad Winderbaum felt Gao was instead pitching a She-Hulk film that featured Black Widow Gao would later be hired as the head writer for the Marvel Studios television series She-Hulk: Attorney at Law (2022) [88] Schaeffer met with Feige in December, and was hired to write the screenplay by the end of 2017 [89] [90] Schaeffer and Johansson were set to discuss the direction of the film at the beginning of February 2018 [91]\n\n\nPre-production\nIn February 2019, Ned Benson was hired to rewrite the script, [106] and Feige confirmed that, despite rumors, the studio did not want the film to receive an R-rating from the Motion Picture Association [107] The following month, Florence Pugh entered negotiations to join the cast as a spy, [108] later revealed to be Yelena Belova [19] Marvel had been considering Pugh for the role since late 2018, but began looking at other actresses in early 2019, including Saoirse Ronan [20] [109] who passed on the role [110] The studio returned to Pugh after she received strong reviews for her performance in the film Fighting with My Family (2019) [20] Devin Grayson and J G Jones, who co-created Belova, expected to receive $25,000 for her role in the film based on a 2007 agreement with Marvel Comics, but ultimately received $5,000 due to a provision in the contract which allowed Marvel to reduce creators' payments; [111] after Grayson went public with this, Marvel agreed to pay her the remaining amount [112] In April 2019, Pugh was confirmed to have been cast alongside David Harbour, [27] Rachel Weisz, [34] [113] and O-T Fagbenle [34] An early version of the script included a scene from Civil War featuring Romanoff and Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark / Iron Man, [114] and Downey was reported to be appearing in the film [115] Fans also expected Jeremy Renner to reprise his MCU role as Clint Barton [116] Shortland and Feige ultimately decided against including other heroes so Romanoff could stand on her own, [116] [117] though Renner does have an uncredited voice-only cameo [42]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began on May 28, 2019, in Norway [124] Shortland took inspiration from such films as How to Train Your Dragon (2010), [31]: 63  No Country for Old Men (2007), and Thelma & Louise (1991), as well as Captain America: The Winter Soldier She looked at combat films and those with armies and militia, allowing her to imagine females in those roles to help translate that to Black Widow [125] Shortland also referenced fight scenes involving female characters in Alien (1979) and the Terminator franchise, and wanted the film's fights to resemble \"real fights\" rather than wrestling matches [99] She edited together fight scenes from different films into shorts that helped her explore the style of fighting that she wanted in the film Shortland said this was the most violent film in the MCU and she wanted to approach that aspect with the same \"truth\" that she was approaching the rest of the film [116]\n\n\nPost-production\nMatthew Schmidt and Leigh Folsom Boyd served as editors on the film [24]: 3  Pearson said the film's handling of Romanoff's Budapest backstory had been \"85% cracked\" prior to the start of filming, and the rest was determined during the editing process as well as additional photography [121] Winstone disliked returning for the additional photography, feeling his performance was being criticized by Marvel Studios executives He wanted his role to be recast instead, but was contractually obligated to return [142] A scene of Romanoff wearing underwear and a T-shirt that Shortland enjoyed due to \"how sexy  [Johansson] is  [when] she's in control\" was cut from the film because test audiences criticized the scene as using the \"male gaze\" [99] Black Widow is one of the few Marvel films to feature an opening credits sequence, which Feige explained was because Shortland felt strongly about exploring what Dreykov is responsible for at the beginning of the film [143] [144] The sequence was designed by Perception, who worked with Shortland to film various vignettes on set that were made to look as if they were captured on 8 mm film, 90's digital video, and VHS These were combined with old photographs and documents that Perception's team created and manipulated to tell the story [145]\n\n\nMusic\nAlexandre Desplat was revealed to be composing the music for the film in January 2020 [162] Late in post-production, Lorne Balfe replaced Desplat as composer, which Desplat confirmed in May 2020 [163] [164] Balfe briefly references Alan Silvestri's motif for Romanoff and main theme for the Avengers from The Avengers in the score, [165] [166] but otherwise wanted to focus on creating a new identity for Romanoff His discussions with Shortland led to him writing an original piece in the style of Russian folk music that he thought Romanoff and Belova may have grown up listening to The rest of his score developed from that piece, and also took inspiration from Russian composers Sergei Prokofiev and Igor Stravinsky Balfe completed recording for the score at Abbey Road Studios as the COVID-19 pandemic began to impact studio recording sessions [165]\n\n\nMarketing\nThe film was officially announced at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con by Feige, Shortland, and members of the cast They discussed the film and introduced footage from the first 30 days of production [19] Some of that footage was included in a teaser trailer for the film that was released in December, [169] [170] with several commentators highlighting its spy thriller tone [171] [172] and calling the film \"long awaited\" or \"highly anticipated\" by fans [169] [170] [173] Rachel Leishman of The Mary Sue said finally seeing a trailer for the film was \"surprisingly emotional\" She felt that setting it between Civil War and Infinity War would allow the character to grow into her more mature form from the latter film after earlier MCU films had depicted her in a supporting role to the male Avengers [173] Scott Mendelson of Forbes compared the trailer's story and tone to the films Atomic Blonde (2017), Red Sparrow (2018), and Anna (2019), but felt Black Widow had a commercial advantage over those films since it stars a familiar character Mendelson thought this familiarity could outweigh the teaser's focus on \"family melodrama\" over superheroics, which he compared to Marvel Studios' Thor (2011) [172] The Hollywood Reporter's Richard Newby found noticeable differences in Shortland's shot composition and cinematography in the trailer compared to the styles of Jon Favreau, Joss Whedon, and the Russo brothers, all directors who helped define Black Widow in previous MCU films, indicating a move away from the MCU's \"house style\" [174]\n\n\nRelease\nBlack Widow premiered on June 29, 2021, at various red carpet fan events in London, Los Angeles, Melbourne, and New York City [187] [188] It was screened at the Taormina

outlined.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Black_Widow_(2021_film)\" following this outline:\n\n\nPlot\nIn 1995, super soldier Alexei Shostakov and Black Widow assassin Melina Vostokoff work as Russian undercover agents, posing as a family in Ohio with Natasha Romanoff and Yelena Belova as their daughters They steal S.H.I.E.L.D intel and escape to Cuba where their boss, General Dreykov, has Romanoff and Belova taken to the Red Room for training as Widows In the following decades, Shostakov is imprisoned in Russia while Romanoff and Belova become successful, dangerous assassins Romanoff eventually defects to S.H.I.E.L.D after helping Clint Barton bomb Dreykov's Budapest office, which apparently kills Dreykov and his young daughter Antonia.\n\n\nCast\nAdditionally, Liani Samuel, Michelle Lee, and Nanna Blondell appear as Red Room assassins Lerato, Oksana, and Ingrid, respectively, [46] [57] while Jade Xu portrays another Black Widow who was later identified as Helen in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) [58] Olivier Richters portrays Ursa Major, a fellow inmate of Shostakov's [42] [59] The film's post-credits scene sees Julia Louis-Dreyfus reprising her role as Valentina Allegra de Fontaine from the Disney+ series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (2021) in an uncredited cameo appearance [60] Jeremy Renner reprises his MCU role as Clint Barton in an uncredited voice-only cameo [42]\n\n\nProduction\n\"What I tried to do was use the backdrop of the splintered Soviet Empire—a lawless insane asylum with

think it's time to do this movie.'\"\n\n\nDevelopment\nFeige met with Johansson to discuss the direction of a Black Widow film in October 2017 Marvel then began meeting with writers for the project, including Jac Schaeffer and Jessica Gao [86] [87] Gao's pitch was influenced by Grosse Pointe Blank (1997), in which Romanoff would have been planted in a high school to assassinate a target and then 20 years later attends a high school reunion where she has to deal with the fallout of her earlier actions [87] The pitch heavily featured the character She-Hulk, and Marvel Studios executive Brad Winderbaum felt Gao was instead pitching a She-Hulk film that featured Black Widow Gao would later be hired as the head writer for the Marvel Studios television series She-Hulk: Attorney at Law (2022) [88] Schaeffer met with Feige in December, and was hired to write the screenplay by the end of 2017 [89] [90] Schaeffer and Johansson were set to discuss the direction of the film at the beginning of February 2018 [91]\n\n\nPre-production\nIn February 2019, Ned Benson was hired to rewrite the script, [106] and Feige confirmed that, despite rumors, the studio did not want the film to receive an R-rating from the Motion Picture Association [107] The following month, Florence Pugh entered negotiations to join the cast as a spy, [108] later revealed to be Yelena Belova [19] Marvel had been considering Pugh for the role since late 2018, but began looking at other actresses in early 2019, including Saoirse Ronan [20] [109] who passed on the role [110] The studio returned to Pugh after she received strong reviews for her performance in the film Fighting with My Family (2019) [20] Devin Grayson and J G Jones, who co-created Belova, expected to receive $25,000 for her role in the film based on a 2007 agreement with Marvel Comics, but ultimately received $5,000 due to a provision in the contract which allowed Marvel to reduce creators' payments; [111] after Grayson went public with this, Marvel agreed to pay her the remaining amount [112] In April 2019, Pugh was confirmed to have been cast alongside David Harbour, [27] Rachel Weisz, [34] [113] and O-T Fagbenle [34] An early version of the script included a scene from Civil War featuring Romanoff and Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark / Iron Man, [114] and Downey was reported to be appearing in the film [115] Fans also expected Jeremy Renner to reprise his MCU role as Clint Barton [116] Shortland and Feige ultimately decided against including other heroes so Romanoff could stand on her own, [116] [117] though Renner does have an uncredited voice-only cameo [42]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began on May 28, 2019, in Norway [124] Shortland took inspiration from such films as How to Train Your Dragon (2010), [31]: 63  No Country for Old Men (2007), and Thelma & Louise (1991), as well as Captain America: The Winter Soldier She looked at combat films and those with armies and militia, allowing her to imagine females in those roles to help translate that to Black Widow [125] Shortland also referenced fight scenes involving female characters in Alien (1979) and the Terminator franchise, and wanted the film's fights to resemble \"real fights\" rather than wrestling matches [99] She edited together fight scenes from different films into shorts that helped her explore the style of fighting that she wanted in the film Shortland said this was the most violent film in the MCU and she wanted to approach that aspect with the same \"truth\" that she was approaching the rest of the film [116]\n\n\nPost-production\nMatthew Schmidt and Leigh Folsom Boyd served as editors on the film [24]: 3  Pearson said the film's handling of Romanoff's Budapest backstory had been \"85% cracked\" prior to the start of filming, and the rest was determined during the editing process as well as additional photography [121] Winstone disliked returning for the additional photography, feeling his performance was being criticized by Marvel Studios executives He wanted his role to be recast instead, but was contractually obligated to return [142] A scene of Romanoff wearing underwear and a T-shirt that Shortland enjoyed due to \"how sexy  [Johansson] is  [when] she's in control\" was cut from the film because test audiences criticized the scene as using the \"male gaze\" [99] Black Widow is one of the few Marvel films to feature an opening credits sequence, which Feige explained was because Shortland felt strongly about exploring what Dreykov is responsible for at the beginning of the film [143] [144] The sequence was designed by Perception, who worked with Shortland to film various vignettes on set that were made to look as if they were captured on 8 mm film, 90's digital video, and VHS These were combined with old photographs and documents that Perception's team created and manipulated to tell the story [145]\n\n\nMusic\nAlexandre Desplat was revealed to be composing the music for the film in January 2020 [162] Late in post-production, Lorne Balfe replaced Desplat as composer, which Desplat confirmed in May 2020 [163] [164] Balfe briefly references Alan Silvestri's motif for Romanoff and main theme for the Avengers from The Avengers in the score, [165] [166] but otherwise wanted to focus on creating a new identity for Romanoff His discussions with Shortland led to him writing an original piece in the style of Russian folk music that he thought Romanoff and Belova may have grown up listening to The rest of his score developed from that piece, and also took inspiration from Russian composers Sergei Prokofiev and Igor Stravinsky Balfe completed recording for the score at Abbey Road Studios as the COVID-19 pandemic began to impact studio recording sessions [165]\n\n\nMarketing\nThe film was officially announced at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con by Feige, Shortland, and members of the cast They discussed the film and introduced footage from the first 30 days of production [19] Some of that footage was included in a teaser trailer for the film that was released in December, [169] [170] with several commentators highlighting its spy thriller tone [171] [172] and calling the film \"long awaited\" or \"highly anticipated\" by fans [169] [170] [173] Rachel Leishman of The Mary Sue said finally seeing a trailer for the film was \"surprisingly emotional\" She felt that setting it between Civil War and Infinity War would allow the character to grow into her more mature form from the latter film after earlier MCU films had depicted her in a supporting role to the male Avengers [173] Scott Mendelson of Forbes compared the trailer's story and tone to the films Atomic Blonde (2017), Red Sparrow (2018), and Anna (2019), but felt Black Widow had a commercial advantage over those films since it stars a familiar character Mendelson thought this familiarity could outweigh the teaser's focus on \"family melodrama\" over superheroics, which he compared to Marvel Studios' Thor (2011) [172] The Hollywood Reporter's Richard Newby found noticeable differences in Shortland's shot composition and cinematography in the trailer compared to the styles of Jon Favreau, Joss Whedon, and the Russo brothers, all directors who helped define Black Widow in previous MCU films, indicating a move away from the MCU's \"house style\" [174]\n\n\nRelease\nBlack Widow premiered on June 29, 2021, at various red carpet fan events in London, Los Angeles, Melbourne, and New York City [187] [188] It was screened at the Taormina

He is known for his role as the chief financial officer and business manager of the social networking site, which was launched in 2004.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nEduardo Luiz Saverin was born in São Paulo, Brazil to a wealthy Jewish-Brazilian family. His father, Roberto Saverin, was a businessman who worked in various industries, including clothing, shipping, energy, and real estate. His mother, Sandra, was a psychologist. Eduardo has two siblings, and his Romanian-born grandfather, Eugenio Saverin, was the founder of Tip Top, a chain of children's clothing shops.\n\nIn 1993, the Saverin family immigrated to the United States, settling in Miami, Florida. Eduardo grew up in a culturally diverse environment, which would later influence his business ventures. He attended the Ransom Everglades School, a private school in Miami, where he developed an interest in business and entrepreneurship.\n\n**Career**\n\nEduardo Saverin began his academic career at Harvard University, where he was a sophomore when he met Mark Zuckerberg, a fellow Harvard undergraduate. Noting the lack of a dedicated social networking website for Harvard students, the two decided to launch a new site. In 2004, they launched Facebook, which quickly gained popularity among Harvard students.\n\nAs co-founder and chief financial officer, Saverin played a crucial role in the early development of Facebook. He invested $1,000 in the site, which later became $18,000. Saverin's role in the company was instrumental in its early success, and he was a key member of the team that worked tirelessly to promote the site.\n\nHowever, in 2012, Saverin's relationship with Zuckerberg deteriorated, and he was effectively cut out of the company. Zuckerberg sent an email to Saverin, detailing his decision to dilute his stake in the company. Saverin responded by filing a lawsuit against Zuckerberg, alleging that the stock-purchase agreement he signed in 2005 was invalid.\n\nThe lawsuit was settled out of court in 2009, with terms remaining confidential. The company acknowledged Saverin's title as co-founder, but he signed a non-disclosure contract after the settlement.\n\n**In Media**\n\nSaverin's life has been the subject of various media outlets, including books and films. The Social Network, a film based on Ben Mezrich's book The Accidental Billionaires, features Andrew Garfield as Saverin. The film depicts Saverin's early life, his relationship with Zuckerberg, and the development of Facebook.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nIn 2009, Saverin moved to Singapore, where he currently resides. He met his future wife, Elaine Andriejanssen, an Indonesian national of Chinese descent and with partial Dutch ancestry, while studying at Harvard and Tufts University, respectively. Andriejanssen comes from a wealthy family that runs several businesses in Indonesia.\n\nThe couple became engaged in March 2014 and married on June 25, 2015. Saverin and Andriejanssen are currently based in Singapore, where they live a private life away from the spotlight.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nEduardo Saverin's life is a testament to the power of entrepreneurship and innovation. From his early days at Harvard to his role as co-founder of Facebook, Saverin has left an indelible mark on the world of technology and business. Despite his tumultuous relationship with Mark Zuckerberg, Saverin remains a significant figure in the history of Facebook and an inspiration to entrepreneurs around the world.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Eduardo_Saverin\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nEduardo Luiz Saverin was born in São Paulo to a wealthy Jewish-Brazilian family, [5] [13] [14] which later moved to Rio de Janeiro Saverin's father, Roberto Saverin, [15] was a businessman working in clothing, shipping, energy, and real estate [16] His mother, Sandra, was a psychologist He has two siblings [17] His Romanian-born grandfather, Eugenio Saverin (born Eugen Saverin), is the founder of Tip Top, a chain of children's clothing shops [17] In 1993, the family immigrated to the US, settling in Miami, Florida [15]\n\n\nCareer\nDuring his junior year at Harvard, Saverin met fellow Harvard undergraduate, sophomore Mark Zuckerberg Noting the lack of a dedicated social networking website for Harvard students, the two worked together to launch Facebook in 2004 They each agreed to invest $1,000 in the site Later, Zuckerberg and Saverin each agreed to invest another $18,000 in the operation [21] As co-founder, Saverin held the role of chief financial officer and business manager [5] On May 15, 2012, Business Insider obtained and released an exclusive email from Zuckerberg detailing how he cut Saverin from Facebook and diluted his stake [22] Zuckerberg privately stated at the time, \"Eduardo is refusing to co-operate at all ..

[17] [18] White then took Wonder and his mother to an audition at Motown, where CEO Berry Gordy signed Wonder to Motown's Tamla label [6] Before signing, producer Clarence Paul gave him the name Little Stevie Wonder [8] [19] Because of Wonder's age, the label drew up a rolling five-year contract in which royalties would be held in trust until Wonder was 21 He and his mother would be paid a weekly stipend to cover their expenses: Wonder received $2.50 (equivalent to $25.49 in 2023) per week, and a private tutor was provided when Wonder was on tour [18]\n\n\n1960s: Singles as a youth\nIn 1961, at the age of 11, Wonder sang his own composition, \"Lonely Boy\", to Ronnie White of the Miracles;

in a contemporaneous review by Vince Aletti in Rolling Stone, Gaye's was seen as successful, while Wonder's was seen as failing due to \"self-indulgent and cluttered\" production, \"undistinguished\" and \"pretentious\" lyrics, and an overall lack of unity and flow [43] Also in 1970, Wonder co-wrote (and played numerous instruments on) the hit \"It's a Shame\" for fellow Motown act the Spinners His contribution was meant to be a showcase of his talent and thus a weapon in his ongoing negotiations with Gordy about creative autonomy [44] Reaching his 21st birthday on May 13, 1971, Wonder allowed his Motown contract to expire [45]\n\n\n1980s: Commercial albums period\nThe mainly instrumental soundtrack album Stevie Wonder's Journey Through \"The Secret Life of Plants\" (1979), was composed using an early music sampler called a Computer Music Melodian [73] It was also his first digital recording, and one of the earliest popular albums to use the technology, which Wonder used for all subsequent recordings Wonder toured briefly with an orchestra in support of the album, and used a Fairlight CMI sampler onstage [74] In this year Wonder also wrote and produced the dance hit \"Let's Get Serious\", performed by Jermaine Jackson and ranked by Billboard as the No. 1 R&B single of 1980.\n\n\n1990s: Jungle Fever and 1996 Olympics\nWonder continued to release new material, but at a slower pace He recorded a soundtrack album for Spike Lee's film Jungle Fever in 1991 From this album, singles and videos were released for \"Gotta Have You\", \"Fun Day\" (remix only), \"These Three Words\" and \"Jungle Fever\" The B-side to the \"Gotta Have You\" single was \"Feeding Off The Love of the Land\", which was played during the end credits of the movie Jungle Fever but was not included on the soundtrack A piano and vocal version of \"Feeding Off The Love of the Land\" was also released on the Nobody's Child: Romanian Angel Appeal compilation Conversation Peace and the live album Natural Wonder were released in the 1990s [81]\n\n\nInto the 21st century: Later career and collaborations\nIn 2000, Wonder contributed two new songs to the soundtrack for Spike Lee's Bamboozled album (\"Misrepresented People\" and \"Some Years Ago\") [92] Wonder continues to record and perform;

Born Stevland Hardaway Judkins on May 13, 1950, in Saginaw, Michigan, Wonder is one of the most successful and influential musicians of the second half of the 20th century. With a career spanning over six decades, Wonder has won 25 Grammy Awards, a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, and a Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nWonder was born six weeks premature, a condition that, along with the oxygen-rich atmosphere in the hospital incubator, resulted in retinopathy of prematurity, a disease that aborts eye growth and often causes the retinas to detach, leaving him blind. Despite this challenge, Wonder's mother, Lula Mae Hardaway, encouraged his musical talents from an early age. Wonder began playing the piano at the age of three and was heavily influenced by jazz and gospel music.\n\n**Career**\n\nIn 1961, at the age of 11, Wonder sang his own composition, \"Lonely Boy,\" to Ronnie White of the Miracles. White then took Wonder and his mother to an audition at Motown, where CEO Berry Gordy signed Wonder to Motown's Tamla label. Before signing, producer Clarence Paul gave him the name Little Stevie Wonder. Because of Wonder's age, the label drew up a rolling five-year contract in which royalties would be held in trust until Wonder was 21. He and his mother would be paid a weekly stipend to cover their expenses: Wonder received $2.50 per week, and a private tutor was provided when Wonder was on tour.\n\n**1960s: Singles as a Youth**\n\nIn 1962, Wonder released his first single, \"Fingertips (Part 2),\" which became a huge success and reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. This was followed by several other successful singles, including \"Little Johnny Hummer\" and \"Sugar Sugar.\" Wonder's music during this period was heavily influenced by traditional R&B and soul.\n\n**1970s: Classic Albums Period**\n\nIn September 1970, at the age of 20, Wonder married Syreeta Wright, a songwriter and former Motown secretary. Wright and Wonder worked together on the next album, Where I'm Coming From (1971), Wonder writing the music, and Wright helping with the lyrics. Around this time, Wonder became interested in utilizing synthesizers after hearing albums by electronic group Tonto's Expanding Head Band. Wonder and Wright wanted to \"touch on the social problems of the world,\" and for the lyrics \"to mean something.\" The album was released at around the same time as Marvin Gaye's What's Going On, as both albums had similar ambitions and themes, they have been compared.\n\n**1980s: Commercial Albums Period**\n\nThe mainly instrumental soundtrack album Stevie Wonder's Journey Through \"The Secret Life of Plants\" (1979), was composed using an early music sampler called a Computer Music Melodian. It was also his first digital recording, and one of the earliest popular albums to use the technology, which Wonder used for all subsequent recordings. Wonder toured briefly with an orchestra in support of the album, and used a Fairlight CMI sampler onstage. In this year Wonder also wrote and produced the dance hit \"Let's Get Serious,\" performed by Jermaine Jackson and ranked by Billboard as the No. 1 R&B single of 1980.\n\n**1990s: Jungle Fever and 1996 Olympics**\n\nWonder continued to release new material, but at a slower pace. He recorded a soundtrack album for Spike Lee's film Jungle Fever in 1991. From this album, singles and videos were released for \"Gotta Have You,\" \"Fun Day\" (remix only), \"These Three Words,\" and \"Jungle Fever.\" The B-side to the \"Gotta Have You\" single was \"Feeding Off The Love of the Land,\" which was played during the end credits of the movie Jungle Fever but was not included on the soundtrack. A piano and vocal version of \"Feeding Off The Love of the Land\" was also released on the Nobody's Child: Romanian Angel Appeal compilation. Conversation Peace and the live album Natural Wonder were released in the 1990s.\n\n**Into the 21st Century: Later Career and Collaborations**\n\nIn 2000, Wonder contributed two new songs to the soundtrack for Spike Lee's Bamboozled album (\"Misrepresented People\" and \"Some Years Ago\"). Wonder continues to record and perform; though mainly occasional appearances and guest performances, he did do two tours, and released one album of new material, 2005's A Time to Love. In June 2006, Wonder made a guest appearance on Busta Rhymes' album The Big Bang, on the track \"Been through the Storm.\" He sings the refrain and plays the piano on the Dr. Dre- and Sha Money XL–produced track. Wonder also performed at Washington, D.C.'s 2006 A Capitol Fourth celebration.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nWonder has been married three times. He was married to Motown singer-songwriter and frequent collaborator Syreeta Wright from 1970 until their amicable divorce in 1972, after which their musical collaboration continued (she sang on 1995's Conversation Peace). From 2001 until 2012, he was married to fashion designer Kai Millard. In October 2009, Wonder and Millard separated; Wonder filed for divorce in August 2012. In 2017, he married Tomeeka Bracy.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nWonder is one of the most notable popular music figures of the second half of the 20th century. He is one of the most successful songwriters and musicians, virtually a one-man band during his peak years. His use of synthesizers and further electronic musical instruments during the 1970s helped expand the sound of R&B. He is also credited as one of the artists who helped drive R&B into the album era, by crafting his LPs as cohesive, consistent statements with complex sounds.\n\n**Awards and Recognition**\n\nWonder has won 25 Grammy Awards, as well as a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996. He is one of only four artists and groups who have won the Grammy for Album of the Year three times as the main credited artist, along with Frank Sinatra, Paul Simon, and Taylor Swift.

It is one of the most widespread gerygone species and is endemic to Australia. The Western Gerygone is a relatively small bird, reaching a length of approximately 9-10 centimeters, with a distinctive appearance that sets it apart from other members of its family.\n\n**Systematics and Taxonomy**\n\nThe Western Gerygone is a member of the family Acanthizidae, which has been split from the family Pardalotidae (Pardalotes). This split has been a subject of debate among ornithologists, with some arguing that the two families are closely related and should be reinstated as a single family. However, molecular studies have confirmed that the Western Gerygone and other members of the Acanthizidae family are distinct from the Pardalotidae.\n\n**Description**\n\nThe Western Gerygone has plain, brownish-grey upperparts, with no prominent wing markings. The underparts are whitish, with variable amounts of grey on the throat and breast. The outer tail-feathers are conspicuously marked, with large, white patches at the base, a broad, blackish, subterminal tail band, and white tips. The bill is small and pointed, and the eyes are dark brown.\n\n**Distribution**\n\nThe Western Gerygone is the most widespread gerygone species and is endemic to Australia. Its three subspecies show subtle differences in plumage and form geographically separate populations. The subspecies include:\n\n* Gerygone fusca fusca: Found in southwestern Western Australia\n* Gerygone fusca pallescens: Found in the Carpentarian Basin\n* Gerygone fusca schistacea: Found on the Eyre Peninsula\n\n**Ecology and Behaviour**\n\nThe Western Gerygone occupies a wide range of wooded habitats, including open sclerophyll forests, dominated by a broad array of eucalyptus species, to sparse mallee and mulga shrublands. It is often found along watercourses and in elevated regions, only occurs below 850 meters. The Western Gerygone is a diurnal bird, spending most of its time foraging for food, singing, and interacting with other birds.\n\n**Habitat**\n\nThe Western Gerygone occupies a wide range of wooded habitats, including open sclerophyll forests, dominated by a broad array of eucalyptus species, to sparse mallee and mulga shrublands. It is often found along watercourses and in elevated regions, only occurs below 850 meters.\n\n**Movement**\n\nDifferent populations of the Western Gerygone show different patterns of movement. Those in south-western Western Australia are partial migrants, breeding only in the south-west, but some individuals migrate inland or northwards during winter. Populations in the Carpentarian Basin and on the Eyre Peninsula are sedentary, while desert populations are partially nomadic, responding to inland rainfall.\n\n**Foraging**\n\nThe Western Gerygone is an insectivorous bird, feeding on a variety of small invertebrates, including insects, spiders, and snails. Its foraging techniques include probing into bark, gleaning from foliage, hovering outside foliage, and aerial strikes from perches. It may also join other small birds in mixed-species feeding flocks.\n\n**Reproduction**\n\nThe breeding season of the Western Gerygone usually occurs between September and January, but has been recorded from August to March. Courtship involves intricate chases between pairs, with the male displaying by intensely fluttering his wings and tail, with his body tilted horizontally. Territories are maintained throughout the breeding season, with territorial disputes involving agitated calls.\n\n**Song**\n\nThe Western Gerygone's song is an irregular series of clear, high-pitched whistles, with a meandering melody. Each note maintains a consistent pitch, and there is a distinct change in pitch between notes. Although the song is not loud in volume, its persistence and distinctive tonal qualities are often recognizable from long distances. Singing birds may turn their head in different directions with each note.\n\n**Song from the Colony on Rottnest Island**\n\nA distinct, new song has emerged in the Western Gerygone population which colonized Rottnest Island in the 1950s. Unlike the mainland song, its notes are delivered in a strictly repeated melody. In 2003, it was estimated that more than a third of the Western Gerygones on Rottnest Island sang the new song, including some individuals which sang both the new song and the typical mainland song.\n\n**Status, Threats, and Conservation**\n\nThe Western Gerygone is common throughout much of its range, especially in southwestern Western Australia. Extensive clearing of native vegetation in this region has led to a reduction in abundance. Predation of Western Gerygones by feral cats is thought to be uncommon.\n\nIn conclusion, the Western Gerygone is a fascinating species that continues to capture the attention of ornithologists and bird enthusiasts alike. Its unique appearance, behavior, and song make it a valuable addition to the avifauna of Australia.

In 2003, it was estimated that more than a third of the western gerygones on Rottnest island sang the new song, including some individuals which sang both the new song and the typical mainland song [19]\n\n\nStatus, threats and conservation\nThe western gerygone is common throughout much of its range, especially in Southwest Australia [13]  Extensive clearing of native vegetation in this region has led to a reduction in abundance [23]  Predation of western gerygones by feral cats is thought to be uncommon [4]\n\n\nGallery\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He has also had a successful career in film and television, with a wide range of critically acclaimed projects to his credit.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nRobert McElhenney III was born on April 14, 1977, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His parents were of Irish descent, and he was raised Catholic. McElhenney's parents divorced when he was eight years old, after his mother came out as a lesbian. He was primarily raised by his father, but the two parents remained close after the divorce. McElhenney's two younger brothers are gay, and he has described himself as having \"always been part of the gay community.\" Through his father's subsequent marriage, he also has a half-sister and step-brother.\n\n**Career**\n\nMcElhenney's first major acting role was in the 1997 film _The Devil's Own_, although his part was cut from the final edit. He went on to have small roles in films such as _A Civil Action_, _Wonder Boys_, and _Thirteen Conversations About One Thing_. McElhenney's breakthrough came with the 2000 film _Latter Days_ and the 2004 film _The Tollbooth_. He also had a guest role in an episode of the TV series _Law & Order_. In 2005, McElhenney was attached to direct a film project that was optioned with Paul Schrader, but the project ultimately fell through.\n\n**Business Interests**\n\nIn 2009, McElhenney and his wife, Kaitlin Olson, along with other investors, purchased Skinner's Bar, which was later renamed Mac's Tavern at 226 Market St in Philadelphia. The bar has become a popular spot for locals and fans of the _It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia_ cast.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nMcElhenney met his wife, Kaitlin Olson, while casting for the role of Dee Reynolds on _It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia_. He became romantically interested in her around season 2 of the show, and they were married in California on September 27, 2008. The couple has two sons, and Olson went into labor with their first son while attending a Philadelphia Phillies game. McElhenney has described Olson as \"the funniest woman in show business.\"\n\n**Body Development**\n\nIn preparation for the seventh season of _It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia_, McElhenney put on 60 pounds of fat and let his beard grow out to give extra humor to his character and add a new comedic direction for the season. His co-star, Charlie Day, described the weight gain as \"disgusting\" and expressed concerns for McElhenney's personal health and safety. However, McElhenney subsequently lost 23 pounds in a month after the season was finished filming and lost the rest of the weight later in the year in time to film the next season.\n\n**Influences**\n\nMcElhenney has cited a wide range of comedic influences, including the Marx Brothers, Woody Allen, Carl Reiner, Norman Lear, George Carlin, Gary David Goldberg, Larry David, and David Sedaris.

{"title": "Fundamentalist_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-Day_Saints", "content": "\nHistory\nThe Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church) traces its claim to spiritual authority to when Brigham Young, then-president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), once visited the Short Creek Community and said, \"This will someday be the head and not the tail of the church This will be the granaries of the Saints This land will produce in abundance sufficient wheat to feed the people.\" [5]\n\n\nOrigins\nThe Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church) traces its claim to spiritual authority to when Brigham Young, then-president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), once visited the Short Creek Community and said, \"This will someday be the head and not the tail of the church This will be the granaries of the Saints This land will produce in abundance sufficient wheat to feed the people.\" [5]\n\n\nPostwar development and Short Creek raid\nIn the morning of July 26, 1953, 102 Arizona state police officers and National Guard soldiers raided the fundamentalist Mormon community of Short Creek, Arizona They arrested the entire populace, including 236 children Of those 236 children, 150 were not allowed to return to their parents for more than two years Other parents never regained custody of their children [13]\n\n\nFrom Leroy S. Johnson to Warren Jeffs\nUnder John Y Barlow, he claimed to be both head of temporal affairs and the Priesthood through his United Effort Plan By 1984, a schism emerged in Short Creek who took issue with his One Man authority These followers moved south of Colorado City to Centennial Park, Arizona and called themselves \"The Work of Jesus Christ\", or \"Second Ward.\" [15]\n\n\nLegal troubles, 2003–2006\nPolygamy is illegal in all 50 states of the United States as well as Canada and Mexico Attempts to overturn the illegality based on right of religious freedom have been unsuccessful [20] In 2003, the church received increased attention from the state of Utah when police officer Rodney Holm, a member of the church, was convicted of unlawful sexual conduct with a 16- or 17-year-old and one count of bigamy for his marriage to and impregnation of plural wife Ruth Stubbs [citation needed] The conviction was the first legal action against a member of the FLDS Church since the Short Creek raid [citation needed]\n\n\nLeadership struggles, 2007–11\nOn September 25, 2007, after trial by a jury in St George, Utah, Jeffs was found guilty of two counts of being an accomplice to rape [26] [27] and was sentenced to ten years to life in prison [28] This conviction was later overturned, but he was subsequently sentenced to life in prison plus 20 years and fined $10,000 after being convicted on charges of aggravated sexual assault and sexual assault.\n\n\nApril 2008 raid\nIn April 2008, acting on a call from an alleged teen victim of physical and sexual abuse at the FLDS compound in Schleicher County, Texas, Texas Child Protective Services and Department of Public Safety officers entered the compound to serve search and arrest warrants and carry out court orders designed to protect children Over the course of several days, from April 3 through April 10, Texas CPS removed 439 children under age 18 from the church's YFZ Ranch, while law enforcement, including Texas Rangers, executed their search and arrest warrants on the premises [45] [46] [47] [48] The April 2008 events at the YFZ Ranch generated intense press coverage in the U.S., especially in the Southwest, and also garnered international attention.\n\n\nChild sex assault convictions\nIn November 2008, 12 FLDS men were charged with offenses related to alleged underage marriages conducted during the years since the sect built the YFZ Ranch [51] As of June 2010, six FLDS members had been convicted of felonies and received sentences ranging from seven to 75 years' imprisonment [52]\n\n\nApril 2010 raid\nOn April 6, 2010, Arizona officials executed search warrants at governmental offices of the towns of Colorado City, Arizona and Hildale, Utah According to one report, the warrants involved the misuse of funds and caused the Hildale Public Safety Department to be shut down [61] According to another report, city personnel and volunteers were ordered out of the buildings while the search was being conducted, prompting protests from Colorado City Fire Chief Jake Barlow [62] Despite these protests, public safety did not appear to be affected, as the county law enforcement agencies involved routed calls for emergency service through the county offices [61] A search warrant was also executed at Jake Barlow's residence [62]\n\n\nAfter the raid\nIn November 2012, the Texas Attorney General's Office instituted legal proceedings to seize the FLDS ranch property in Eldorado, Texas [63] [64] [65] The basis for the forfeiture and seizure proceeding was cited as the use of FLDS property as \"...a rural location where the systemic sexual assault of children would be tolerated without interference from law enforcement authorities\", [64] therefore, the property is contraband and subject to seizure [65] [66] On April 17, 2014, Texas officials took physical possession of the property [67]\n\n\nReconsolidation efforts since 2022\nDocuments presented to the media and state prosecutors in 2022–23 indicate that Warren Jeffs issued a series of revelations from prison in 2022 reasserting his authority over the church and calling its members together In one document from June 2022, Jeffs instructed that fathers seeking \"restoral\" should reunite with their wives and children, while warning that God \"cannot allow sin living to dwell\" in the church any longer; [71] another, distributed in August, required that children be gathered back to the church over the next five years in preparation for the imminent end of the world [72]\n\n\nLeaders\nAs senior member of the Priesthood Council in Short Creek:\n\n\nPrevious heads\nAs senior member of the Priesthood Council in Short Creek:\n\n\nCurrent head\nWarren Jeffs became head of the FLDS Church in 2002 In the years immediately following Jeffs's imprisonment in 2007, the leadership of the church was unclear [35] Other claimed leaders in this period include:\n\n\nBishops\nAs of 2018 [update]:\n\n\nDistinctive doctrines\nIn direct contrast to the structure of the Short Creek Community, the FLDS Church teaches that God only works through one man who has all Priesthood keys [90] In operation the President cannot be a member of the Priesthood Council Rulon Jeffs denied succession [clarification needed], making his son Warren Jeffs his father renewed [clarification needed] [91]\n\n\nOne Man Rule\nIn direct contrast to the structure of the Short Creek Community, the FLDS Church teaches that God only works through one man who has all Priesthood keys [90] In operation the President cannot be a member of the Priesthood Council Rulon Jeffs denied succession [clarification needed], making his son Warren Jeffs his father renewed [clarification needed] [91]\n\n\nMarriage and placement marriage\nThe FLDS Church teaches the doctrine of plural marriage, which states that God commands in order for a man to receive the highest form of salvation to have a minimum of three wives [92] Connected with this doctrine is the patriarchal doctrine, the belief that wives are required to be subordinate to their husbands and placement marriage The prophet elects to take wives from men as well as give wives to men according to their worthiness This practice is also called the law of placing or placement marriage.\n\n\nProperty ownership\nThe land and houses formerly occupied by the FLDS Church on the Utah/Arizona border are owned by the United Effort Plan (UEP), established in 1942 as a subsidiary organization of the church [93] The UEP also owns most of the property of the businesses that were controlled by FLDS Church members in that area The church viewed this \"United Order\" as a means of living the traditional Latter Day Saint doctrine of the \"Law of Consecration\" In 2005, the UEP was seized by the state of Utah following a lawsuit by the Attorney General [93] [94] The UEP was worth $100 million at this time [95] State control of the UEP ended in 2019, with the trust reformed into a \"religiously neutral\" entity benefiting the original donors and their heirs, including those who had left the FLDS Church [96]\n\n\nSerpent seed\nAs an extension of the Adam-God teaching, it is taught that likewise there are literal children of Satan as there are literal children of God [97] Children of Satan were to be born with the Mark Of Cain as pay for his slaying of Abel in creation, and therefore justifying the Priesthood Ban The seed of Cain survived the Flood through Ham's wife so that Satan would be represented, but with a curse of bondage [98]\n\n\nDress\nMen and women are forbidden to have any tattoos or body piercings In general, women do not cut their hair short or wear makeup, trousers, or any skirt above the knees [99] Men wear plain clothing, usually long-sleeved collared shirt and full-length trousers Women and girls usually wear pastel-colored homemade long-sleeved prairie dresses, with hems between ankle and mid-calf, along with long stockings or trousers underneath, usually keeping their hair coiffed [100] [verification needed]\n\n\nCriticism\nAt the time of his death, FLDS Church leader Rulon Jeffs was confirmed to have married 46 women and fathered more than 60 children It was estimated in 2018 that Warren Jeffs might have at least 79 wives [101] Because the type of polygamy which is practiced is actually polygyny, the practice of it inevitably leads to bride shortages, and FLDS members are additionally known to practice child marriages, incest, and child abuse [102]\n\n\nPlural marriage\nAt the time of his death, FLDS Church leader Rulon Jeffs was confirmed to have married 46 women and fathered more than 60 children It was estimated in 2018 that Warren Jeffs might have at least 79 wives [101] Because the type of polygamy which is practiced is actually polygyny, the practice of it inevitably leads to bride shortages, and FLDS members are additionally known to practice child marriages, incest, and child abuse [102]\n\n\nSexual abuse of minors\nThe FLDS Church has been suspected of trafficking girls across state lines, and it has also been suspected of trafficking underage girls across the U.S borders with Canada [114] and Mexico, [115] for the purpose of involuntary plural marriage and child sexual abuse [116] The Royal Canadian Mounted Police also suspects that the FLDS Church trafficked more than 30 underage girls from Canada to the United States between the late 1990s and 2006 so they could be entered into polygamous marriages [114] RCMP spokesman Dan Moskaluk said of the activities of the FLDS Church: \"In essence, it's human trafficking in connection with illicit sexual activity.\" [117] According to the Vancouver Sun, it is unclear whether Canada's anti-human trafficking statute can be effectively applied against the FLDS Church's pre-2005 activities, as it may not apply retroactively [118] An earlier three-year-long investigation by local authorities in British Columbia into allegations of sexual abuse, human trafficking, and forced marriages by the FLDS resulted in no charges, but did result in legislative change [119]\n\n\nWelfare receipt\nFLDS Church leaders have encouraged their flock to take advantage of government assistance in the form of welfare and the WIC (woman-infant-child) programs [citation needed] Since the government only recognizes one woman as the legal wife of a man, the rest of his wives are considered single mothers and as a result, they are eligible to receive government assistance The more wives and children one has, the more welfare checks and food stamps one can receive By 2003, for example, more than $6 million in public funds were being channeled into the community of Colorado City, Arizona In his book Under the Banner of Heaven (p. 15), Jon Krakauer writes that, \"Fundamentalists call defrauding the government 'bleeding the beast' and regard it as a virtuous act.\" Carolyn Campbell (\"Inside Polygamy in the '90s\", 102) adds, \"The attitude of some polygamists is 'the government is untrustworthy and corrupt, and I'm above it, but give me those food stamps and free medical care.'\" [120]\n\n\nLost boys\nFormer members have reported that the FLDS Church has excommunicated more than 400 [121] teenage boys for offenses such as dating or listening to rock music Some former members claim that the real motive for these excommunications is to ensure a sufficient female majority to allow for each male to marry three or more wives [122] In 2014, six men aged 18 to 22 filed a conspiracy lawsuit against Jeffs and Sam Barlow, a former Mohave County deputy sheriff and close associate of Jeffs, for the \"systematic excommunication\" of young men to reduce competition for wives [123] [124] [125]\n\n\nRacism\nIn its Spring 2005 Intelligence Report, the Southern Poverty Law Center added the FLDS Church to its list of hate groups [126] because of the church's doctrines, which include its fierce condemnation of interracial relationships Warren Jeffs has said, \"the black race is the people through which the devil has always been able to bring evil unto the earth\" [127]\n\n\nBlood atonement\nFormer FLDS Church member Robert Richter reported to the Phoenix New Times that Warren Jeffs has repeatedly alluded to the 19th-century teaching of \"blood atonement\" in church sermons Under the doctrine of blood atonement, certain serious sins, such as murder, can only be atoned for by the sinner's death [2]\n\n\nBirth defects\nThe Colorado City/Hildale area has the world's highest incidence of fumarase deficiency, an extremely rare genetic disease [128] Geneticists attribute this to the prevalence of cousin marriages between descendants of two of the town's founders, Joseph Smith Jessop and John Yeates Barlow [128] [129] [130] [131] It causes encephalopathy, severe intellectual disability, unusual facial features, brain malformation, and epileptic seizures [132] [133]\n\n\nChild labor abuses\nOn April 20, 2015, the U.S Department of Labor assessed fines which totaled US$1.96 million against a group of FLDS Church members, including Lyle Jeffs, a brother of the church's controversial leader, Warren Jeffs, for alleged child labour violations which were committed during the church's 2012 pecan harvest at an orchard near Hurricane, Utah [134]\n\n\nLDS Church's attitude\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) has stated that \"the polygamists and polygamist organizations in parts of the Western United States and Canada have no affiliation whatsoever with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\", [136] and it has also declared that polygamy is strictly prohibited by the current doctrine of the LDS Church Additionally, the LDS Church states that the term \"Mormon\" is incorrectly applied to the FLDS adherents and it also discourages its own members from using the term \"Mormon\" as a descriptive term for members of the LDS Church themselves [137]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nPopular media, including books and television programs, have focused on the FLDS Church.\n\n\nSee also\nOfficial

individuals who rejected the practices of the mainstream Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The FLDS Church is known for its practice of polygamy, also known as plural marriage, and has been the subject of controversy and criticism due to its treatment of women and children.\n\n**History**\n\nThe FLDS Church traces its claim to spiritual authority to when Brigham Young, then-president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), once visited the Short Creek Community and said, \"This will someday be the head and not the tail of the church This will be the granaries of the Saints This land will produce in abundance sufficient wheat to feed the people.\" This statement is seen as a prophecy by the FLDS Church, which believes that the Short Creek Community was chosen by God to be the headquarters of the church.\n\n**Origins**\n\nThe FLDS Church was formed in the 1930s by a group of individuals who rejected the practices of the mainstream LDS Church. These individuals, led by John Y. Barlow, believed that the LDS Church had strayed from the true teachings of Joseph Smith and that they needed to return to the fundamentals of the gospel. They established their own community in Short Creek, Arizona, which became the headquarters of the FLDS Church.\n\n**Postwar development and Short Creek raid**\n\nIn the morning of July 26, 1953, 102 Arizona state police officers and National Guard soldiers raided the fundamentalist Mormon community of Short Creek, Arizona. They arrested the entire populace, including 236 children. Of those 236 children, 150 were not allowed to return to their parents for more than two years. Other parents never regained custody of their children.\n\n**From Leroy S. Johnson to Warren Jeffs**\n\nUnder John Y. Barlow, he claimed to be both head of temporal affairs and the Priesthood through his United Effort Plan. By 1984, a schism emerged in Short Creek who took issue with his One Man authority. These followers moved south of Colorado City to Centennial Park, Arizona and called themselves \"The Work of Jesus Christ\", or \"Second Ward.\"\n\n**Legal troubles, 2003-2006**\n\nPolygamy is illegal in all 50 states of the United States as well as Canada and Mexico. Attempts to overturn the illegality based on right of religious freedom have been unsuccessful. In 2003, the church received increased attention from the state of Utah when police officer Rodney Holm, a member of the church, was convicted of unlawful sexual conduct with a 16- or 17-year-old and one count of bigamy for his marriage to and impregnation of plural wife Ruth Stubbs.\n\n**Leadership struggles, 2007-11**\n\nOn September 25, 2007, after trial by a jury in St George, Utah, Jeffs was found guilty of two counts of being an accomplice to rape and was sentenced to ten years to life in prison. This conviction was later overturned, but he was subsequently sentenced to life in prison plus 20 years and fined $10,000 after being convicted on charges of aggravated sexual assault and sexual assault.\n\n**April 2008 raid**\n\nIn April 2008, acting on a call from an alleged teen victim of physical and sexual abuse at the FLDS compound in Schleicher County, Texas, Texas Child Protective Services and Department of Public Safety officers entered the compound to serve search and arrest warrants and carry out court orders designed to protect children. Over the course of several days, from April 3 through April 10, Texas CPS removed 439 children under age 18 from the church's YFZ Ranch, while law enforcement, including Texas Rangers, executed their search and arrest warrants on the premises.\n\n**Child sex assault convictions**\n\nIn November 2008, 12 FLDS men were charged with offenses related to alleged underage marriages conducted during the years since the sect built the YFZ Ranch. As of June 2010, six FLDS members had been convicted of felonies and received sentences ranging from seven to 75 years' imprisonment.\n\n**April 2010 raid**\n\nOn April 6, 2010, Arizona officials executed search warrants at governmental offices of the towns of Colorado City, Arizona and Hildale, Utah. According to one report, the warrants involved the misuse of funds and caused the Hildale Public Safety Department to be shut down. According to another report, city personnel and volunteers were ordered out of the buildings while the search was being conducted, prompting protests from Colorado City Fire Chief Jake Barlow. Despite these protests, public safety did not appear to be affected, as the county law enforcement agencies involved routed calls for emergency service through the county offices. A search warrant was also executed at Jake Barlow's residence.\n\n**After the raid**\n\nIn November 2012, the Texas Attorney General's Office instituted legal proceedings to seize the FLDS ranch property in Eldorado, Texas. The basis for the forfeiture and seizure proceeding was cited as the use of FLDS property as \"...a rural location where the systemic sexual assault of children would be tolerated without interference from law enforcement authorities\", therefore, the property is contraband and subject to seizure. On April 17, 2014, Texas officials took physical possession of the property.\n\n**Reconsolidation efforts since 2022**\n\nDocuments presented to the media and state prosecutors in 2022-23 indicate that Warren Jeffs issued a series of revelations from prison in 2022 reasserting his authority over the church and calling its members together. One document from June 2022 instructed that fathers seeking \"restoral\" should reunite with their wives and children, while warning that God \"cannot allow sin living to dwell\" in the church any longer. Another, distributed in August, required that children be gathered back to the church over the next five years in preparation for the imminent end of the world.\n\n**Leaders**\n\nAs senior member of the Priesthood Council in Short Creek:\n\nPrevious heads:\n\n* Leroy S. Johnson\n* John Y. Barlow\n* Rulon Jeffs\n\nCurrent head:\n\nWarren Jeffs became head of the FLDS Church in 2002. In the years immediately following Jeffs's imprisonment in 2007, the leadership of the church was unclear. Other claimed leaders in this period include:\n\n* Lyle Jeffs\n* Nephi Jeffs\n\n**Bishops**\n\nAs of 2018:\n\n* Warren Jeffs\n* Lyle Jeffs\n* Nephi Jeffs\n\n**Distinctive doctrines**\n\nIn direct contrast to the structure of the Short Creek Community, the FLDS Church teaches that God only works through one man who has all Priesthood keys. In operation the President cannot be a member of the Priesthood Council. Rulon Jeffs denied succession, making his son Warren Jeffs his father renewed.\n\n**One Man Rule**\n\nIn direct contrast to the structure of the Short Creek Community, the FLDS Church teaches that God only works through one man who has all Priesthood keys. In operation the President cannot be a member of the Priesthood Council. Rulon Jeffs denied succession, making his son Warren Jeffs his father renewed.\n\n**Marriage and placement marriage**\n\nThe FLDS Church teaches the doctrine of plural marriage, which states that God commands in order for a man to receive the highest form of salvation to have a minimum of three wives. Connected with this doctrine is the patriarchal doctrine, the belief that wives are required to be subordinate to their husbands and placement marriage. The prophet elects to take wives from men as well as give wives to men according to their worthiness. This practice is also called the law of placing or placement marriage.\n\n**Property ownership**\n\nThe land and houses formerly occupied by the FLDS Church on the Utah/Arizona border are owned by the United Effort Plan (UEP), established in 1942 as a subsidiary organization of the church. The UEP also owns most of the property of the businesses that were controlled by FLDS Church members in that area. The church viewed this \"United Order\" as a means of living the traditional Latter Day Saint doctrine of the \"Law of Consecration\". In 2005, the UEP was seized by the state of Utah following a lawsuit by the Attorney General. The UEP was worth $100 million at this time. State control of the UEP ended in 2019, with the trust reformed into a \"religiously neutral\" entity benefiting the original donors and their heirs, including those who had left the FLDS Church.\n\n**Serpent seed**\n\nAs an extension of the Adam-God teaching, it is taught that likewise there are literal children of Satan as there are literal children of God. Children of Satan were to be born with the Mark Of Cain as pay for his slaying of Abel in creation, and therefore justifying the Priesthood Ban. The seed of Cain survived the Flood through Ham's wife so that Satan would be represented, but with a curse of bondage.\n\n**Dress**\n\nMen and women are forbidden to have any tattoos or body piercings. In general, women do not cut their hair short or wear makeup, trousers, or any skirt above the knees. Men wear plain clothing, usually long-sleeved collared shirt and full-length trousers. Women and girls usually wear pastel-colored homemade long-sleeved prairie dresses, with hems between ankle and mid-calf, along with long stockings or trousers underneath, usually keeping their hair coiffed.\n\n**Criticism**\n\nAt the time of his death, FLDS Church leader Rulon Jeffs was confirmed to have married 46 women and fathered more than 60 children. It was estimated in 2018 that Warren Jeffs might have at least 79 wives. Because the type of polygamy which is practiced is actually polygyny, the practice of it inevitably leads to bride shortages, and FLDS members are additionally known to practice child marriages, incest, and child abuse.\n\n**Plural marriage**\n\nAt the time of his death, FLDS Church leader Rulon Jeffs was confirmed to have married 46 women and fathered more than 60 children.

Because the type of polygamy which is practiced is actually polygyny, the practice of it inevitably leads to bride shortages, and FLDS members are additionally known to practice child marriages, incest, and child abuse [102]\n\n\nSexual abuse of minors\nThe FLDS Church has been suspected of trafficking girls across state lines, and it has also been suspected of trafficking underage girls across the U.S borders with Canada [114] and Mexico, [115] for the purpose of involuntary plural marriage and child sexual abuse [116] The Royal Canadian Mounted Police also suspects that the FLDS Church trafficked more than 30 underage girls from Canada to the United States between the late 1990s and 2006 so they could be entered into polygamous marriages [114] RCMP spokesman Dan Moskaluk said of the activities of the FLDS Church: \"In essence, it's human trafficking in connection with illicit sexual activity.\" [117] According to the Vancouver Sun, it is unclear whether Canada's anti-human trafficking statute can be effectively applied against the FLDS Church's pre-2005 activities, as it may not apply retroactively [118] An earlier three-year-long investigation by local authorities in British Columbia into allegations of sexual abuse, human trafficking, and forced marriages by the FLDS resulted in no charges, but did result in legislative change [119]\n\n\nWelfare receipt\nFLDS Church leaders have encouraged their flock to take advantage of government assistance in the form of welfare and the WIC (woman-infant-child) programs [citation needed] Since the government only recognizes one woman as the legal wife of a man, the rest of his wives are considered single mothers and as a result, they are eligible to receive government assistance The more wives and children one has, the more welfare checks and food stamps one can receive By 2003, for example, more than $6 million in public funds were being channeled into the community of Colorado City, Arizona In his book Under the Banner of Heaven (p. 15), Jon Krakauer writes that, \"Fundamentalists call defrauding the government 'bleeding the beast' and regard it as a virtuous act.\" Carolyn Campbell (\"Inside Polygamy in the '90s\", 102) adds, \"The attitude of some polygamists is 'the government is untrustworthy and corrupt, and I'm above it, but give me those food stamps and free medical care.'\" [120]\n\n\nLost boys\nFormer members have reported that the FLDS Church has excommunicated more than 400 [121] teenage boys for offenses such as dating or listening to rock music Some former members claim that the real motive for these excommunications is to ensure a sufficient female majority to allow for each male to marry three or more wives [122] In 2014, six men aged 18 to 22 filed a conspiracy lawsuit against Jeffs and Sam Barlow, a former Mohave County deputy sheriff and close associate of Jeffs, for the \"systematic excommunication\" of young men to reduce competition for wives [123] [124] [125]\n\n\nRacism\nIn its Spring 2005 Intelligence Report, the Southern Poverty Law Center added the FLDS Church to its list of hate groups [126] because of the church's doctrines, which include its fierce condemnation of interracial relationships Warren Jeffs has said, \"the black race is the people through which the devil has always been able to bring evil unto the earth\" [127]\n\n\nBlood atonement\nFormer FLDS Church member Robert Richter reported to the Phoenix New Times that Warren Jeffs has repeatedly alluded to the 19th-century teaching of \"blood atonement\" in church sermons Under the doctrine of blood atonement, certain serious sins, such as murder, can only be atoned for by the sinner's death [2]\n\n\nBirth defects\nThe Colorado City/Hildale area has the world's highest incidence of fumarase deficiency, an extremely rare genetic disease [128] Geneticists attribute this to the prevalence of cousin marriages between descendants of two of the town's founders, Joseph Smith Jessop and John Yeates Barlow [128] [129] [130] [131] It causes encephalopathy, severe intellectual disability, unusual facial features, brain malformation, and epileptic seizures [132] [133]\n\n\nChild labor abuses\nOn April 20, 2015, the U.S Department of Labor assessed fines which totaled US$1.96 million against a group of FLDS Church members, including Lyle Jeffs, a brother of the church's controversial leader, Warren Jeffs, for alleged child labour violations which were committed during the church's 2012 pecan harvest at an orchard near Hurricane, Utah [134]\n\n\nLDS Church's attitude\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) has stated that \"the polygamists and polygamist organizations in parts of the Western United States and Canada have no affiliation whatsoever with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\", [136] and it has also declared that polygamy is strictly prohibited by the current doctrine of the LDS Church Additionally, the LDS Church states that the term \"Mormon\" is incorrectly applied to the FLDS adherents and it also discourages its own members from using the term \"Mormon\" as a descriptive term for members of the LDS Church themselves [137]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nPopular media, including books and television programs, have focused on the FLDS Church.\n\n\nSee also\nOfficial

for Imperial Airways and the aviation department of Tata Sons was formed with two single-engine de Havilland Puss Moths On 15 October 1932, Tata flew a Puss Moth carrying air mail from Karachi to Bombay (currently Mumbai) and the aircraft continued to Madras (currently Chennai) piloted by Nevill Vintcent, a former Royal Air Force pilot and friend of Tata [7] The airline fleet consisted of a Puss Moth aircraft and a Leopard Moth [8] [9] Initial service included weekly airmail service between Karachi and Madras via Ahmedabad and Bombay In its first year of operation, the airline flew 160,000 miles (260,000 km), carrying 155 passengers and 9.72 tonnes (10.71 tons) of mail and made a profit of ₹60,000 (US$720) [10] [11] Later, the airline launched a domestic flight from Bombay to Trivandrum with a six-seater Miles Merlin [12] In 1938, it was re-christened as Tata Air Services and later as Tata Airlines Delhi and Colombo were added to the destinations in 1938 [7] During the Second World War, the airline helped the Royal Air Force with troop movements, shipping of supplies, rescue of refugees and maintenance of planes [7]\n\n\nEarly years (1932–1945)\nAir India had its origin in Tata Sons, founded by J R D Tata, an Indian aviator and business tycoon [6] In April 1932, Tata won a contract to carry mail for Imperial Airways and the aviation department of Tata Sons was

re-christened as Tata Air Services and later as Tata Airlines Delhi and Colombo were added to the destinations in 1938 [7] During the Second World War, the airline helped the Royal Air Force with troop movements, shipping of supplies, rescue of refugees and maintenance of planes [7]\n\n\nPost-Independence (1946–2000)\nAfter World War II, regular commercial service was restored in India and Tata Airlines became a public limited company on 29 July 1946 under the name Air India [2] After the Indian independence in 1947, 49% of the airline was acquired by the Government of India in 1948 [13] On 8 June 1948, a Lockheed Constellation L-749A named Malabar Princess (registered VT-CQP) took off from Bombay bound for London Heathrow marking the airline's first international flight [7] In 1953, the Government of India passed the Air Corporations Act and purchased a majority stake in the carrier from Tata Sons though its founder J R D Tata would continue as chairman until 1977 [14] The company was renamed as Air India International Limited and the domestic services were transferred to Indian Airlines as a part of restructuring [15] From 1948 to 1950, the airline introduced services to Nairobi in Africa and to major European destinations Rome, Paris and Düsseldorf [16] The airline took delivery of its first Lockheed Constellation L-1049 named Rani of Jhansi (registered VT-DGL) and inaugurated services to Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Singapore [16]\n\n\nFinancial trouble, merger with Indian and later (2000–2022)\nIn 2000–01, attempts were made to re-privatize Air India [21] [22] [23] [24] In 2000, Air India introduced services to Shanghai, China On 23 May 2001, the Ministry of Civil Aviation charged Michael Mascarenhas, the then-managing director, with corruption According to the ministry reports, the airline lost approximately ₹570 million (US$6.8 million) because of extra commissions that Mascarenhas sanctioned and he was later suspended from the airline [25] In May 2004, Air India launched a wholly owned low cost subsidiary called Air-India Express connecting cities in India with the Middle East and Southeast Asia Until 2007, Air India mainly operated on international long-haul routes while Indian Airlines operated on domestic and international short-haul routes In 2007, Air India and Indian Airlines were merged under Air India Limited [26] and the airline took delivery of its first Boeing 777 aircraft [16] The airline was invited to be a part of the Star Alliance in 2007 [27]\n\n\nPost privatization (2022–present)\nOn 28 June 2017, the Government of India approved the privatisation of Air India and set up a committee to decide the details [63] In March 2018, the Government issued an Expression of Interest (EOI) to sell a 76%

The airline was founded in 1932 and has a rich history of providing air travel services to passengers across the globe. With its main hub at Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi, Air India operates a fleet of over 210 aircraft and flies to 84 destinations across 37 countries.\n\nHistory\nAir India had its origin in Tata Sons, founded by J R D Tata, an Indian aviator and business tycoon. In April 1932, Tata won a contract to carry mail for Imperial Airways and the aviation department of Tata Sons was formed with two single-engine de Havilland Puss Moths. On 15 October 1932, Tata flew a Puss Moth carrying air mail from Karachi to Bombay (currently Mumbai) and the aircraft continued to Madras (currently Chennai) piloted by Nevill Vintcent, a former Royal Air Force pilot and friend of Tata. The airline fleet consisted of a Puss Moth aircraft and a Leopard Moth. Initial service included weekly airmail service between Karachi and Madras via Ahmedabad and Bombay. In its first year of operation, the airline flew 160,000 miles (260,000 km), carrying 155 passengers and 9.72 tonnes (10.71 tons) of mail and made a profit of ₹60,000 (US$720).\n\nPost-Independence (1946–2000)\nAfter World War II, regular commercial service was restored in India and Tata Airlines became a public limited company on 29 July 1946 under the name Air India. After the Indian independence in 1947, 49% of the airline was acquired by the Government of India in 1948. On 8 June 1948, a Lockheed Constellation L-749A named Malabar Princess (registered VT-CQP) took off from Bombay bound for London Heathrow marking the airline's first international flight. In 1953, the Government of India passed the Air Corporations Act and purchased a majority stake in the carrier from Tata Sons though its founder J R D Tata would continue as chairman until 1977. The company was renamed as Air India International Limited and the domestic services were transferred to Indian Airlines as a part of restructuring.\n\nFinancial trouble, merger with Indian and later (2000–2022)\nIn 2000–01, attempts were made to re-privatize Air India. In 2000, Air India introduced services to Shanghai, China. On 23 May 2001, the Ministry of Civil Aviation charged Michael Mascarenhas, the then-managing director, with corruption. According to the ministry reports, the airline lost approximately ₹570 million (US$6.8 million) because of extra commissions that Mascarenhas sanctioned and he was later suspended from the airline. In May 2004, Air India launched a wholly owned low cost subsidiary called Air-India Express connecting cities in India with the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Until 2007, Air India mainly operated on international long-haul routes while Indian Airlines operated on domestic and international short-haul routes. In 2007, Air India and Indian Airlines were merged under Air India Limited and the airline took delivery of its first Boeing 777 aircraft. The airline was invited to be a part of the Star Alliance in 2007.\n\nPost privatization (2022–present)\nOn 28 June 2017, the Government of India approved the privatisation of Air India and set up a committee to decide the details. In March 2018, the Government issued an Expression of Interest (EOI) to sell a 76% stake in Air India, along with low-cost airline Air India Express, and a 50% stake in AISATS, a ground handling joint venture with Singapore Airport Terminal Services (SATS). According to the EOI, the new owner would have to take on a debt of ₹33,392 crore (US$4.0 billion) and a bid would have to be submitted by mid-May as the Government wanted to complete the selling process by the end of 2018. However, no private firms showed any interest to buy a share in the debt-laden airline.\n\nCorporate affairs and identity\nThe key trends of Air India are (as of the financial year ending 31 March). The airline's key trends are driven by its focus on providing excellent customer service, expanding its network, and improving its financial performance.

During the Second World War, the airline helped the Royal Air Force with troop movements, shipping of supplies, rescue of refugees and maintenance of planes [7]\n\n\nPost-Independence (1946–2000)\nAfter World War II, regular commercial service was restored in India and Tata Airlines became a public limited company on 29 July 1946 under the name Air India [2] After the Indian independence in 1947, 49% of the airline was acquired by the Government of India in 1948 [13] On 8 June 1948, a Lockheed Constellation L-749A named Malabar Princess (registered VT-CQP) took off from Bombay bound for London Heathrow marking the airline's first international flight [7] In 1953, the Government of India passed the Air Corporations Act and purchased a majority stake in the carrier from Tata Sons though its founder J R D Tata would continue as chairman until 1977 [14] The company was renamed as Air India International Limited and the domestic services were transferred to Indian Airlines as a part of restructuring [15] From 1948 to 1950, the airline introduced services to Nairobi in Africa and to major European destinations Rome, Paris and Düsseldorf [16] The airline took delivery of its first Lockheed Constellation L-1049 named Rani of Jhansi (registered VT-DGL) and inaugurated services to Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Singapore [16]\n\n\nFinancial trouble, merger with Indian and later (2000–2022)\nIn 2000–01, attempts were made to re-privatize Air India [21] [22] [23] [24] In 2000, Air India introduced services to Shanghai, China On 23 May 2001, the Ministry of Civil Aviation charged Michael Mascarenhas, the then-managing director, with corruption According to the ministry reports, the airline lost approximately ₹570 million (US$6.8 million) because of extra commissions that Mascarenhas sanctioned and he was later suspended from the airline [25] In May 2004, Air India launched a wholly owned low cost subsidiary called Air-India Express connecting cities in India with the Middle East and Southeast Asia Until 2007, Air India mainly operated on international long-haul routes while Indian Airlines operated on domestic and international short-haul routes In 2007, Air India and Indian Airlines were merged under Air India Limited [26] and the airline took delivery of its first Boeing 777 aircraft [16] The airline was invited to be a part of the Star Alliance in 2007 [27]\n\n\nPost privatization (2022–present)\nOn 28 June 2017, the Government of India approved the privatisation of Air India and set up a committee to decide the details [63] In March 2018, the Government issued an Expression of Interest (EOI) to sell a 76% stake in Air India, along with low-cost airline Air India Express, and a 50% stake in AISATS, a ground handling joint venture with Singapore Airport Terminal Services (SATS) According to the EOI, the new owner would have to take on a debt of ₹33,392 crore (US$4.0 billion) and a bid would have to be submitted by mid-May as the Government wanted to complete the selling process by the end of 2018 [64] However, no private firms showed any interest to buy a share in the debt-laden airline [65]\n\n\nCorporate

is the Maharajah (high king) [127] [128] It was created by Bobby Kooka, the then-commercial director of Air India, and Umesh Rao, an artist with J Walter Thompson Limited in 1946 [129] Kooka stated that, \"We call him a Maharajah for want of a better description But his blood isn't blue He may look like royalty, but he isn't royal\" [130] Air India adopted the Maharajah as its mascot in 1946 It was used in promoting it although initially designed only for the airline's memo-pads [131] The Maharajah was given a makeover in 2015 and the brand is represented by a younger version [132] In 2023, the Maharajah was given a makeover and was revealed that the mascot would only be used in certain aspects of the airline like the premium lounges and crockery [133]\n\n\nLogo and livery\nAir India's colour scheme is red and white The aircraft was painted white with red palace-style carvings on the outside of the windows and the airline's name written in red The name is written in Hindi on the port side fuselage and in English on the port side tail On the starboard side, the name is written in English on the fuselage, and in Hindi on the tail [134] The window scheme was designed in line

payment [144] In 2010, a plan to establish a museum from the collection was stalled and the artworks reside in a building in Nariman Point, Mumbai [143] Air India organized the first ever exhibition of these art at the National Gallery of Modern Art in Delhi, titled Air India Salutes Indian Masters in 2013 [145] Following a memorandum of understanding agreed between the airline and the Ministry of Culture, the art collection was transferred to the National Gallery of Modern Art (NGMA) in Mumbai in January 2023 [146] The art was put up for exhibition titled Maharaja's Treasure: Select Works of Art from the Famed Air India Collection [147] [148]\n\n\nDestinations\nAs of April 2024 [update], Air India flies to a total of 84 destinations, including 44 domestic destinations and 40

restructuring, Air India sold five of its eight Boeing 777-200LR aircraft to Etihad Airways in December 2013 According to the airline, plans for introducing ultra-long flights with service to Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles were cancelled due to factors like high fuel prices and weak demand [163] In April 2014, the airline decided to sell its remaining three Boeing 777-200LRs as well, citing higher operating costs [164] On 24 April 2014, Air India issued a tender for leasing 14 Airbus A320 aircraft for up to six years, to strengthen its domestic network [165] By April 2024, Air India has

{"title": "Neil_Young", "content": "\nEarly life (1945–1963)\nNeil Young [14] was born on November 12, 1945, in Toronto [15] [16] His father, Scott Alexander Young (1918–2005), was a journalist and sportswriter who also wrote fiction [17] His mother, Edna Blow Ragland \"Rassy\" Young (1918–1990) was a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution [18] Although Canadian, his mother had American and French ancestry [19] Young's parents married in 1940 in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and moved to Toronto shortly thereafter where their first son, Robert \"Bob\" Young, was born in 1942.\n\n\nCareer\nYoung and his mother settled into the working-class area of Fort Rouge, Winnipeg, where he enrolled at Earl Grey Junior High School It was there that he formed his first band, the Jades, and met Ken Koblun While attending Kelvin High School in Winnipeg, he played in several instrumental rock bands, eventually dropping out of school in favor of a musical career [34] Young's first stable band was the Squires, with Ken Koblun, Jeff Wuckert and Bill Edmondson on drums, who had a local hit called \"The Sultan\" Over three years, the band played hundreds of shows at community centers, dance halls, clubs and schools in Winnipeg and other parts of Manitoba The band also played in Fort William (now part of the city of Thunder Bay, Ontario), where they recorded a series of demos produced by a local producer, Ray Dee, whom Young called \"the original Briggs,\" referring to his later producer David Briggs [35]  While playing at The Flamingo, Young met Stephen Stills, whose band The Company was playing at the same venue, and they became friends [36] The Squires primarily performed in Winnipeg and rural Manitoba in towns such as Selkirk, Neepawa, Brandon and Giroux (near Steinbach), with a few shows in northern Ontario [37]\n\n\nEarly career (1963–1966)\nYoung and his mother settled into the working-class area of Fort Rouge, Winnipeg, where he enrolled at Earl

Winnipeg and rural Manitoba in towns such as Selkirk, Neepawa, Brandon and Giroux (near Steinbach), with a few shows in northern Ontario [37]\n\n\nBuffalo Springfield (1966–1968)\nOnce they reached Los Angeles, Young and Palmer met up with Stephen Stills and Richie Furay after a chance encounter in traffic on Sunset Boulevard [44] Along with Dewey Martin, they formed Buffalo Springfield A mixture of folk, country, psychedelia, and rock, lent a hard edge by the twin lead guitars of Stills and Young, made Buffalo Springfield a critical success, and their first record Buffalo Springfield (1966) sold well after Stills' topical song \"For What It's Worth\" became a hit, aided by Young's melodic harmonics played on electric guitar According to Rolling Stone, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and other sources, Buffalo Springfield helped create the genres of folk rock and country rock [46] [47]\n\n\nGoing solo, Crazy Horse (1968–1969)\nAfter the breakup of Buffalo Springfield, Young signed a solo deal with Reprise Records, home of his colleague and friend Joni Mitchell, with whom he shared a manager, Elliot Roberts Roberts managed Young until Roberts' death in 2019 Young and Roberts immediately began work on Young's first solo record, Neil Young (January 22, 1969), [52] which received mixed reviews In a 1970 interview, [53] Young deprecated the album as being \"overdubbed rather than played.\"\n\n\nCrosby, Stills, Nash, and Young (1969–1970)\nShortly after the release of Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, Young reunited with Stephen Stills by joining Crosby, Stills & Nash, who had already released one album, Crosby, Stills & Nash, as a trio in May 1969 Young was originally offered a position as a sideman but agreed to join only if he received full membership, and the group – winners of the 1969 Best New Artist Grammy Award – was renamed Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young [55] The quartet debuted in Chicago on August 16, 1969, and later performed at the famous Woodstock Festival, during which Young skipped the majority of the acoustic set and refused to be filmed during the electric set, even telling the cameramen: \"One of you fuckin' guys comes near me and I'm gonna fuckin' hit you with my guitar\" [56] During the making of their first album, Déjà Vu (March 11, 1970), the musicians frequently argued, particularly Young and Stills, who both fought for control Stills continued throughout their lifelong relationship to criticize Young, saying that he \"wanted to play folk music in a rock band.\" [57]\n\n\nAfter the Gold Rush, acoustic tour and Harvest (1970–1972)\nLater in the year, Young released his third solo album, After the Gold Rush (August 31, 1970), which featured, among others, Nils Lofgren, Stephen Stills, and CSNY bassist Greg Reeves Young also recorded some tracks with Crazy Horse, but dismissed them early in the sessions The eventual recording was less amplified than Everybody Knows This is Nowhere, with a wider range of sounds Young's newfound fame with CSNY made the album his commercial breakthrough as a solo artist, and it contains some of his best-known work, including \"Tell Me Why\" and \"Don't Let It Bring You Down\"; the singles \"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\" and \"When You Dance I Can Really Love\"; and the title track, \"After the Gold Rush\", played on piano, with dreamlike lyrics that ran a gamut of subjects from drugs and interpersonal relationships to environmental concerns Young's bitter condemnation of racism in the heavy blues-rock song \"Southern Man\" (along with a later song entitled \"Alabama\") was also controversial with southerners in an era of desegregation, prompting Lynyrd Skynyrd to decry Young by name in the lyrics to their hit \"Sweet Home Alabama\" However, Young said he was a fan of Skynyrd's music, and the band's front man Ronnie Van Zant was later photographed wearing a Tonight's the Night T-shirt on the cover of an album [59]\n\n\nThe \"Ditch\" Trilogy and personal struggles (1972–1974)\nAlthough a new tour with The Stray Gators (now augmented by Danny Whitten) had been planned to follow up on the success of Harvest, it became apparent during rehearsals that Whitten could not function due to drug abuse On November 18, 1972, shortly after he was fired from the tour preparations, Whitten was found dead of an apparent alcohol/diazepam overdose Young described the incident to Rolling Stone's Cameron Crowe in 1975: \" [We] were rehearsing with him and he just couldn't cut it He couldn't remember anything He was too out of it Too far gone I had to tell him to go back to L.A 'It's not happening, man You're not together enough.' He just said, 'I've got nowhere else to go, man How am I gonna tell my friends?' And he split That night the coroner called me from L.A and told me he'd OD'd That blew my mind I loved Danny I felt responsible And from there, I had to go right out on this huge tour of huge arenas I was very nervous and .. insecure.\" [45]\n\n\nReunions, retrospectives and Rust Never Sleeps (1974–1979)\nYoung reunited with Crosby, Stills, and Nash after a four-year hiatus in the summer of 1974 for a concert tour that was partially recorded; highlights were ultimately released in 2014 as CSNY 1974 It was one of the first ever stadium tours and the largest tour in which Young has participated to date [74]\n\n\nExperimental years (1980–1988)\nAt the start of the 1980s, distracted by medical concerns relating to the cerebral palsy of his son, Ben, Young had little time to spend on writing and recording [88] After providing the incidental music to the 1980 film Where the Buffalo Roam, Young released Hawks & Doves (November 3, 1980), a short record pieced together from sessions going back to 1974 [89]\n\n\nReturn to prominence (1989–1999)\nYoung's 1989 single \"Rockin' in the Free World\", which hit No. 2 on the US mainstream-rock charts, and accompanied the album, Freedom, returned Young to the popular consciousness after a decade of sometimes-difficult genre experiments The album's lyrics were often overtly political; \"Rockin' in the Free World\" deals with homelessness, terrorism, and environmental degradation, implicitly criticizing the government policies of President George H W Bush [105]\n\n\nHealth condition and new material (2000s)\nNeil Young continued to release new material at a rapid pace through the first decade of the new millennium The studio album Silver & Gold and live album Road Rock Vol 1 were released in 2000 and were both accompanied by live concert films His 2001 single \"Let's Roll\" was a tribute to the victims of the September 11 attacks, and the effective action taken by the passengers and crew on Flight 93 in particular [118]\n\n\n2005 Health Issues\nIn March 2005, while working on the Prairie Wind album in Nashville, [121] Young was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm He was treated successfully with a minimally invasive neuroradiological procedure, performed in a New York hospital on March 29, [122] but two days afterward he passed out on a New York street from bleeding from the femoral artery, which radiologists had used to access the aneurysm [123] The complication forced Young to cancel his scheduled appearance at the Juno Awards telecast in Winnipeg, but within months he was back on stage, appearing at the close of the Live 8 concert in Barrie, Ontario, on July 2 During the performance, he debuted a new song, a soft hymn called \"When God Made Me\" Young's brush with death influenced Prairie Wind's themes of retrospection and mortality [124]\n\n\nJonathan Demme concert film\nA Jonathan Demme concert film from a 2007 concert at the Tower Theater in Upper Darby Township, Pennsylvania, called the Neil Young Trunk Show premiered on March 21, 2009, at the South by Southwest (SXSW) Film Conference and Festival in Austin, Texas It was featured at the Cannes Film Festival on May 17, 2009, and was released in the US on March 19, 2010, [125] to critical acclaim [126] [127] [128]\n\n\nGlastonbury, Isle of Wight\nIn 2009, Young headlined the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, and Glastonbury Festival in Pilton, England, [129] at Hard Rock Calling in London (where he was joined onstage by Paul McCartney for a rendition of \"A Day in the Life\") and, after years of unsuccessful booking attempts, the Isle of Wight Festival [130]\n\n\nIncreased environmental activism and Promise of the Real (2010s)\nIn May 2010, it was revealed Young had begun working on a new studio album produced by Daniel Lanois This was announced by David Crosby, who said that the album \"will be a very heartfelt record I expect it will be a very special record.\" [131] On May 18, 2010, Young embarked upon a North American solo tour to promote his then upcoming album, Le Noise, playing a mix of older songs and new material Although billed as a solo acoustic tour, Young also played some songs on electric guitars, including Old Black [132]\n\n\n2020s\nIn February 2020, Young wrote an open letter to President Trump, calling him a \"disgrace to my country\" [164] [165] On August 4, 2020, Young filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Trump's reelection campaign for the use of his music at campaign rallies [166]\n\n\nArchives project\nSince 2006, Young has been maintaining the Neil Young Archives, a project which encompasses the release of live albums, starting in 2006 with Live at the Fillmore East, box sets of live and studio material, starting in 2009 with The Archives Vol 1 1963–1972, as well as video releases As of 2019 [update], the project has evolved into a subscription website and application where all of his music is available to stream in high resolution audio Neil Young Archives also includes his newspaper, The Times-Contrarian, The Hearse Theater, and photographs and memorabilia from throughout his career [180]\n\n\nActivism, philanthropy and humanitarian efforts\nYoung has been a lifelong, committed environmentalist [181] and outspoken advocate for the welfare of small farmers, having co-founded in 1985 the benefit concert Farm Aid.\n\n\nFarm Aid\nYoung remains on the board of directors of Farm Aid, an organization he co-founded with Willie Nelson and John Mellencamp in 1985 According to its website, it is the longest running concert benefit series in the US and it has raised $43 million since its first benefit concert in 1985 Each year, Young co-hosts and performs with well-known guest performers including Dave Matthews and producers including Evelyn Shriver and Mark Rothbaum, at the Farm Aid annual benefit concerts to raise funds and provide grants to family farms and prevent foreclosures, provide a crisis

Fossil Fuel, and Old Growth logging activism\nYoung has been a vocal opponent of the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline, which would run from Alberta to Texas When discussing the environmental impact

dollars [79]) from Sol Betnun Music on Larchmont in Hollywood and has since acquired nearly 450 different examples, all from the same era, but he maintains that it is the original model that sounds superior and is crucial to his trademark sound [205]\n\n\nPersonal life\nYoung's family was from Manitoba, where both his parents were born and married Young himself was born in Toronto, Ontario, and lived there at various times in his early life (1945, 1957, 1959–1960, 1966–1967), as well as Omemee (1945–1952) and Pickering, Ontario (1956) before settling with his mother in Winnipeg, Manitoba

deeply flawed, and do not provide the rich, warm sound of analog recordings He claims to be acutely aware of the difference, and compares it with taking a shower in tiny ice cubes versus ordinary water [233] Young and his company PonoMusic developed Pono, a music download service and dedicated music player focusing on \"high-quality\" uncompressed digital audio [234] It was designed to compete against highly compressed MP3 type formats Pono promised to present songs \"as they first sound during studio recording\" [235] [236] [237] The service and the sale of the player were launched in

songwriter, and musician. Born on November 12, 1945, in Toronto, Ontario, Young is a highly influential and iconic figure in the music industry, known for his eclectic and often experimental style, which has spanned multiple genres, including folk, rock, blues, and country.\n\n**Early Life (1945–1963)**\n\nNeil Young was born to Scott Alexander Young and Edna Blow Ragland \"Rassy\" Young. His father was a journalist and sportswriter, and his mother was a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution. Young's parents married in 1940 in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and moved to Toronto shortly thereafter, where their first son, Robert \"Bob\" Young, was born in 1942. Young's family moved to Fort Rouge, Winnipeg, where he enrolled at Earl Grey Junior High School and formed his first band, the Jades, with his friend Ken Koblun.\n\n**Career**\n\nYoung's first stable band was the Squires, with Ken Koblun, Jeff Wuckert, and Bill Edmondson on drums. The band had a local hit called \"The Sultan\" and played hundreds of shows at community centers, dance halls, clubs, and schools in Winnipeg and other parts of Manitoba. Young also played in Fort William (now part of the city of Thunder Bay, Ontario), where they recorded a series of demos produced by a local producer, Ray Dee.\n\n**Buffalo Springfield (1966–1968)**\n\nOnce in Los Angeles, Young met up with Stephen Stills and Richie Furay after a chance encounter in traffic on Sunset Boulevard. Along with Dewey Martin, they formed Buffalo Springfield, a mixture of folk, country, psychedelia, and rock that lent a hard edge by the twin lead guitars of Stills and Young. Buffalo Springfield was a critical success, and their first record, Buffalo Springfield (1966), sold well after Stills' topical song \"For What It's Worth\" became a hit.\n\n**Going Solo, Crazy Horse (1968–1969)**\n\nAfter the breakup of Buffalo Springfield, Young signed a solo deal with Reprise Records and began work on his first solo record, Neil Young (1969). Although the album received mixed reviews, Young deprecated it in a 1970 interview, saying it was \"overdubbed rather than played.\"\n\n**Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young (1969–1970)**\n\nYoung reunited with Stephen Stills by joining Crosby, Stills & Nash, who had already released one album. Young was originally offered a position as a sideman but agreed to join only if he received full membership, and the group was renamed Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. The quartet debuted in Chicago and later performed at the famous Woodstock Festival, where Young skipped the majority of the acoustic set and refused to be filmed during the electric set.\n\n**After the Gold Rush, Acoustic Tour, and Harvest (1970–1972)**\n\nYoung released his third solo album, After the Gold Rush (1970), which featured Nils Lofgren, Stephen Stills, and CSNY bassist Greg Reeves. The album was a commercial breakthrough as a solo artist and contains some of his best-known work, including \"Tell Me Why\" and \"Don't Let It Bring You Down.\" Young's bitter condemnation of racism in the heavy blues-rock song \"Southern Man\" was also controversial with southerners in an era of desegregation.\n\n**The \"Ditch\" Trilogy and Personal Struggles (1972–1974)**\n\nAlthough a new tour with The Stray Gators had been planned to follow up on the success of Harvest, it became apparent during rehearsals that Whitten could not function due to drug abuse. Young described the incident to Rolling Stone's Cameron Crowe in 1975: \"We were rehearsing with him and he just couldn't cut it. He couldn't remember anything. He was too out of it. Too far gone. I had to tell him to go back to L.A. 'It's not happening, man. You're not together enough.'\"\n\n**Reunions, Retrospectives, and Rust Never Sleeps (1974–1979)**\n\nYoung reunited with Crosby, Stills, and Nash after a four-year hiatus in the summer of 1974 for a concert tour that was partially recorded. The tour was one of the first ever stadium tours and the largest tour in which Young has participated to date.\n\n**Experimental Years (1980–1988)**\n\nAt the start of the 1980s, distracted by medical concerns relating to the cerebral palsy of his son, Ben, Young had little time to spend on writing and recording. After providing the incidental music to the 1980 film Where the Buffalo Roam, Young released Hawks & Doves (1980), a short record pieced together from sessions going back to 1974.\n\n**Return to Prominence (1989–1999)**\n\nYoung's 1989 single \"Rockin' in the Free World,\" which hit No. 2 on the US mainstream-rock charts, and accompanied the album, Freedom, returned Young to the popular consciousness after a decade of sometimes-difficult genre experiments. The album's lyrics were often overtly political, and Young has continued to be a vocal critic of government policies.\n\n**Health Condition and New Material (2000s)**\n\nIn February 2005, while working on the Prairie Wind album in Nashville, Young was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm. He was treated successfully with a minimally invasive neuroradiological procedure, performed in a New York hospital on March 29. Young has continued to release new material at a rapid pace through the first decade of the new millennium.\n\n**Jonathan Demme Concert Film and Activism (2007–2010)**\n\nA Jonathan Demme concert film from a 2007 concert at the Tower Theater in Upper Darby Township, Pennsylvania, called the Neil Young Trunk Show premiered on March 21, 2009, at the South by Southwest Film Conference and Festival in Austin, Texas. The film was featured at the Cannes Film Festival on May 17, 2009, and was released in the US on March 19, 2010, to critical acclaim.\n\n**Increased Environmental Activism and Promise of the Real (2010s)**\n\nIn May 2010, it was revealed that Young had begun working on a new studio album produced by Daniel Lanois. Young has been a vocal opponent of the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline, which would run from Alberta to Texas. In 2023, Young and Daryl Hannah traveled by train to Victoria to offer their support to 1,200 Old Growth activists who had been arrested unlawfully at the Fairy Creek old-growth logging protests.\n\n**Legacy and Influence**\n\nYoung's political outspokenness and social awareness have influenced artists such as Blind Melon, Phish, Pearl Jam, and Nirvana.

Down\"; the singles \"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\" and \"When You Dance I Can Really Love\"; and the title track, \"After the Gold Rush\", played on piano, with dreamlike lyrics that ran a gamut of subjects from drugs and interpersonal relationships to environmental concerns Young's bitter condemnation of racism in the heavy blues-rock song \"Southern Man\" (along with a later song entitled \"Alabama\") was also controversial with southerners in an era of desegregation, prompting Lynyrd Skynyrd to decry Young by name in the lyrics to their hit \"Sweet Home Alabama\" However, Young said he was a fan of Skynyrd's music, and the band's front man Ronnie Van Zant was later photographed wearing a Tonight's the Night T-shirt on the cover of an album [59]\n\n\nThe \"Ditch\" Trilogy and

stage, appearing at the close of the Live 8 concert in Barrie, Ontario, on July 2 During the performance, he debuted a new song, a soft hymn called \"When God Made Me\" Young's brush with death

revelatory\" [201] Young is a collector of second-hand guitars, but in recording and performing, he uses frequently just a few instruments, as is explained by his longtime guitar technician Larry Cragg in the film Neil Young: Heart of Gold They include:\n\n\nReed organ\nYoung owns a restored Estey reed organ, serial number 167272, dating from 1885, which he frequently plays in concert [203]\n\n\nCrystallophone\nYoung owns a glass harmonica, which he played in the recording of \"I Do\" on his 2019 album Colorado [204]\n\n\nAmplification\nYoung uses various vintage Fender Tweed Deluxe amplifiers His preferred amplifier for electric guitar is the Fender Deluxe, specifically a Tweed-era model from 1959 He purchased his first vintage Deluxe in 1967 for US$50 (US$460 in 2023 dollars [79]) from Sol Betnun Music on Larchmont in Hollywood and has since acquired nearly 450 different examples, all from the same era, but he maintains that it is the original model that sounds superior and is crucial to his trademark sound [205]\n\n\nPersonal life\nYoung's family was from Manitoba, where both his parents were born and married Young himself was born in Toronto, Ontario, and lived there at various times in his early life (1945, 1957, 1959–1960, 1966–1967), as well as Omemee (1945–1952) and Pickering, Ontario (1956) before settling with his mother in Winnipeg, Manitoba (1958, 1960–1966), where his music career began and which he considers his \"hometown\" [207] After becoming successful, he bought properties in California  Young had a home in Malibu, California, which burned to the ground in the 2018 Woolsey Fire [208]  Young had lived outside Canada since 1967, before returning in 2020.\n\n\nCitizenship\nYoung announced in 2019 that his application for United States citizenship had been held up because of his use of marijuana In 2020, the issue was resolved and he became a United States citizen [212] [213] [214] [215]  Almost immediately upon gaining US citizenship, Young returned to living in Canada for the first time in over half a century, as he and Daryl Hannah moved to a cottage near Omemee, the town where he had originally lived from shortly after his birth until the age of 7 [216] [217]\n\n\nMarriages and relationships\nYoung married his first wife, restaurant owner Susan Acevedo, in December 1968 They were together until October 1970, when she filed for divorce [218]\n\n\nBusiness ventures\nYoung was part owner of Lionel, LLC, a company that makes toy trains and model railroad accessories [230] In 2008 Lionel emerged from bankruptcy and his shares of the company were wiped out He was instrumental in the design of the Lionel Legacy control system for model trains, [230] and remains on the board of directors of Lionel [231] He has been named as co-inventor on seven US patents related to model trains [232]\n\n\nPonoMusic\nYoung has long held that the digital audio formats in which most people download music are deeply flawed, and do not provide the rich, warm sound of analog recordings He claims to be acutely aware of the difference, and compares it with taking a shower in tiny ice cubes versus ordinary water [233] Young and his company PonoMusic developed Pono, a music download service and dedicated music player focusing on \"high-quality\" uncompressed digital audio [234] It was designed to compete against highly compressed MP3 type formats Pono promised to present songs \"as they first sound during studio recording\" [235] [236] [237] The service and the sale of the player were launched in October 2014 [238] [239]\n\n\nBack catalog sale\nIn January 2021, Young sold 50% of the rights to his back catalog to the British investment company Hipgnosis Songs Fund The value was estimated to be at least $150 million [240] [241]\n\n\nLegacy and influence\nYoung's political outspokenness and social awareness influenced artists such as Blind Melon, Phish, Pearl Jam, and Nirvana Young is referred to as \"the Godfather of Grunge\" because of the influence he had on Kurt Cobain and Eddie Vedder and the entire grunge movement Vedder inducted Young into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, citing him as a huge influence Young has also been cited as an influence by other major alternative rock bands and artists, such as Sonic Youth, [242] Dinosaur Jr., [243] Nada Surf frontman Matthew Caws, [244] Feeder frontman Grant Nicholas, [245] and Thom Yorke of Radiohead Yorke recounted first hearing Young after sending a demo tape to a magazine when he was 16, which favorably compared his singing voice to Young's Unaware of Young at that time, he bought After the Gold Rush (1970), and \"immediately fell in love\" with his work, calling it \"extraordinary\" [246]\n\n\nDiscography\nAs one of the founders of Farm Aid (1985–), he remains an active member of the board of directors For one weekend each October, in Mountain View, California, Young and his ex-wife hosted the Bridge School Concerts, which drew international talent and sell-out crowds for nearly two decades He announced in June 2017, however, that he would no longer host the concerts

(10-time world champion) and Madge Syers won the individual titles [11] [12]\n\n\nEarly years\n A predecessor, the Nordic Games, were organised by General Viktor Gustaf Balck in Stockholm, Sweden, in

contested, at which Ulrich Salchow (10-time world champion) and Madge Syers won the individual titles [11] [12]\n\n\n1920 to 1936\nThe first Olympics after the war, the 1920 Summer Olympics, were held in Antwerp, Belgium, [16] and featured figure skating [17] and an ice hockey tournament Germany, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey were banned from competing in the games At the IOC Congress held the following year it was decided that the host nation of the 1924 Summer Olympics, France, would host a separate \"International Winter Sports Week\" under the patronage of the IOC Chamonix was chosen to host this week (actually 11 days) of events.\n\n\n1948 to 1962\nSt Moritz was selected to host the first post-war games, in 1948 Switzerland's neutrality had protected the town during World War II, and most venues from the 1928 games remained in place, which made St Moritz a logical choice It became the first city to host a Winter Olympics twice [36] Twenty-eight countries competed in Switzerland, but athletes from Germany and Japan were not invited [37] Controversy erupted when two hockey teams from the United States arrived, both claiming to be the legitimate U.S Olympic hockey representative The Olympic flag presented at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp was stolen, as was its replacement There was unprecedented parity at these games, during which 10 countries won gold medals—more than any games to that point [38]\n\n\n1964 to 1980\nThe Austrian city of Innsbruck was the host in 1964 For the first time, the Olympic torch of the Winter Olympic Games was lit at the traditional ritual held in the temple of Olympia.Although Innsbruck was a traditional winter sports resort, unprojected warm weather caused a lack of snow and organisers were unable to save enough snow to be used during the Games, and the Austrian army was enlisted to transport snow and ice from other places to the sports venues [52] Soviet speed-skater Lidia Skoblikova made history by winning all four-speed skating events Her career total of six gold medals set a record for Winter Olympics athletes [52] Also, for the first time Luge was added to the Olympic program, but the sport received bad publicity when a competitor was killed in a pre-Olympic training run [55] [56]\n\n\n1984 to 1998\nSapporo, Japan, and Gothenburg, Sweden, were front-runners to host the 1984 Winter Olympics It was therefore a surprise when Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, was selected as host [74] The Games were well-organised and not affected by the run-up to the war that engulfed the country eight years later [75] A total of 49 nations and 1,272 athletes participated in 39 events Host nation Yugoslavia won its first Olympic medal when alpine skier Jure Franko won silver in the giant slalom Another sporting highlight was the free dance performance of British ice dancers Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean; their Boléro routine received unanimous perfect scores for artistic impression, earning them the gold medal [75]\n\n\n2002 to 2022\nAfter a tumultuous host city process, the 2002 Winter Olympics were held in Salt Lake City, United States 2,399 athletes from 77 National Olympic Committees participated in 78 events in 7 sports [92] These Games were the first to take place since the September 11 attacks of 2001, which meant a higher degree of security to avoid a terrorist attack The opening ceremony saw signs of the aftermath of the events of that day, including the flag that flew at Ground Zero, and honour guards of NYPD and FDNY members [93]\n\n\nFuture\nThe 2026 Winter Olympics will be held in Milan-Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, and take place between 6 and 22 February 2026 [124]  At the 142nd IOC Session in July 2024, it was confirmed that the 2030 Winter Olympics will be hosted by France in the French Alps [125] The 2034 Winter Olympics was also awarded simultaneously to be hosted by the United States in Salt Lake City, Utah, where the Olympics were held previously in 2002 [126]\n\n\nProblems and politics\nThe process for awarding host city honours came under intense scrutiny after Salt Lake City had been awarded the right to host the 2002 Games [127] Soon after the host city had been announced it was discovered that the organisers had engaged in an elaborate bribery scheme to curry favour with IOC officials [127] Gifts and other financial considerations were given to those who would evaluate and vote on Salt Lake City's bid These gifts included medical treatment for relatives, a college scholarship for one member's son and a land deal in Utah Even IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch received two rifles valued at $2,000 Samaranch defended the gift as inconsequential since, as president, he was a non-voting member [128]\n\n\nControversy\nThe process

valued at $2,000 Samaranch defended the gift as inconsequential since, as president, he was a non-voting member [128]\n\n\nHost city legacy\nAccording to the IOC, the host city for the Winter Olympics is responsible for \"...establishing functions and services for all aspects of the Games, such as sports planning, venues, finance, technology, accommodation, catering, media services, etc., as well as operations during the Games\" [135] Due to the cost of hosting the Games, most host cities never realise a profit on their investment [136] For example, the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, cost $3.6 billion to host By comparison, the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, cost $12.5 billion [137] The organisers of the Nagano Games claimed that the cost of extending the bullet train service from Tokyo to Nagano was responsible for the large price tag [137]\n\n\nDoping\nIn 1967 the IOC began enacting drug testing protocols They started by randomly testing athletes at the 1968 Winter Olympics [143] The first Winter Games athlete to test positive for a banned substance was Alois Schloder, a West German hockey player, [144] but his team was still allowed to compete [145] During the 1970s testing outside of competition was escalated because it was found to deter athletes from using performance-enhancing drugs [146] The problem with testing during this time was a lack of standardisation of the test procedures, which undermined the credibility of the tests It was not until the late 1980s that international sporting federations began to coordinate efforts to standardise the drug-testing protocols [147] The IOC took the lead in the fight against steroids when it established the independent World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in November 1999 [148] [149]\n\n\nCold War\nThe Winter Olympics were an ideological front in the Cold War since the Soviet Union first participated at the 1956 Winter Games It did not take long for the Cold War combatants to discover what a powerful propaganda tool the Olympic Games could be The advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\" of the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage The Soviet Union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but many of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis [46] Nevertheless, the IOC held to the traditional rules regarding amateurism until the '90s [47]\n\n\nBoycott\nThe Winter Games have had only one national team boycott when Taiwan decided not to participate in the 1980 Winter Olympics held in Lake Placid Prior to the Games, the IOC agreed to allow China to compete in the Olympics for the first time since 1952 China was given permission to compete as the \"People's Republic of China\" (PRC) and to use the PRC flag and anthem Until 1980 the island of Taiwan had been competing under the name \"Republic of China\" (ROC) and had been using the ROC flag and anthem [69] The IOC attempted to have the countries compete together but when this proved to be unacceptable the IOC demanded that Taiwan cease to call itself the \"Republic of China\" [162] [163]\n\n\nSports\nThe Olympic Charter limits winter sports to \"those sports which are practised on snow or ice\" [165] Since 1992 a number of new sports have been added to the Olympic programme, which include short-track speed skating, snowboarding, freestyle and moguls skiing The addition of these events has broadened the appeal of the Winter Olympics beyond Europe and North America While European powers such as Norway and Germany still dominate the traditional Winter Olympic sports, countries such as South Korea, Australia and Canada are finding success in these new sports The results are more parity in the national medal tables, more interest in the Winter Olympics, and higher global television ratings [166]\n\n\nCurrent sports\nDemonstration sports have historically provided a venue for host countries to attract publicity to locally popular sports by having a competition without granting medals Demonstration sports were discontinued after 1992 [182] Military patrol, a precursor to the biathlon, was a medal sport in 1924 and was demonstrated in 1928, 1936 and 1948, becoming an official sport in 1960 [183] The special figures figure skating event was only contested at the 1908 Summer Olympics [184] Bandy (Russian hockey) is a sport popular in the Nordic countries and Russia In the latter it is considered a national sport [185] It was demonstrated at the Oslo Games [186]\n\n\nDemonstration events\nDemonstration sports have historically provided a

Samaranch defended the gift as inconsequential since, as president, he was a non-voting member.\n\n## Host City Legacy\n\nAccording to the IOC, the host city for the Winter Olympics is responsible for \"...establishing functions and services for all aspects of the Games, such as sports planning, venues, finance, technology, accommodation, catering, media services, etc., as well as operations during the Games.\" Due to the cost of hosting the Games, most host cities never realise a profit on their investment. For example, the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, cost $3.6 billion to host. By comparison, the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, cost $12.5 billion. The organisers of the Nagano Games claimed that the cost of extending the bullet train service from Tokyo to Nagano was responsible for the large price tag.\n\n## Doping\n\nIn 1967, the IOC began enacting drug testing protocols. They started by randomly testing athletes at the 1968 Winter Olympics. The first Winter Games athlete to test positive for a banned substance was Alois Schloder, a West German hockey player, but his team was still allowed to compete. During the 1970s, testing outside of competition was escalated because it was found to deter athletes from using performance-enhancing drugs. The problem with testing during this time was a lack of standardisation of the test procedures, which undermined the credibility of the tests. It was not until the late 1980s that international sporting federations began to coordinate efforts to standardise the drug-testing protocols. The IOC took the lead in the fight against steroids when it established the independent World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in November 1999.\n\n## Cold War\n\nThe Winter Olympics were an ideological front in the Cold War since the Soviet Union first participated at the 1956 Winter Games. It did not take long for the Cold War combatants to discover what a powerful propaganda tool the Olympic Games could be. The advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\" of the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The Soviet Union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but many of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis. Nevertheless, the IOC held to the traditional rules regarding amateurism until the '90s.\n\n## Boycott\n\nThe Winter Games have had only one national team boycott, when Taiwan decided not to participate in the 1980 Winter Olympics held in Lake Placid. Prior to the Games, the IOC agreed to allow China to compete in the Olympics for the first time since 1952. China was given permission to compete as the \"People's Republic of China\" (PRC) and to use the PRC flag and anthem. Until 1980, the island of Taiwan had been competing under the name \"Republic of China\" (ROC) and had been using the ROC flag and anthem. The IOC attempted to have the countries compete together, but when this proved to be unacceptable, the IOC demanded that Taiwan cease to call itself the \"Republic of China.\"\n\n## Sports\n\nThe Olympic Charter limits winter sports to \"those sports which are practised on snow or ice.\" Since 1992, a number of new sports have been added to the Olympic programme, which include short-track speed skating, snowboarding, freestyle, and moguls skiing. The addition of these events has broadened the appeal of the Winter Olympics beyond Europe and North America. While European powers such as Norway and Germany still dominate the traditional Winter Olympic sports, countries such as South Korea, Australia, and Canada are finding success in these new sports. The results are more parity in the national medal tables, more interest in the Winter Olympics, and higher global television ratings.\n\n## Current Sports\n\nDemonstration sports have historically provided a venue for host countries to attract publicity to locally popular sports by having a competition without granting medals. Demonstration sports were discontinued after 1992. Military patrol, a precursor to the biathlon, was a medal sport in 1924 and was demonstrated in 1928, 1936, and 1948, becoming an official sport in 1960. The special figures figure skating event was only contested at the 1908 Summer Olympics. Bandy (Russian hockey) is a sport popular in the Nordic countries and Russia, in the latter it is considered a national sport. It was demonstrated at the Oslo Games.\n\n## All-time Medal Table\n\nThe table below uses official data provided by the IOC.\n\n| Rank | Nation | Gold | Silver | Bronze | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- |

and were held again in 1903 and 1905 and then every fourth year thereafter until 1926 [10] Balck was a charter member of the IOC and a close friend of Olympic Games founder Pierre de Coubertin He attempted to have winter sports, specifically figure skating, added to the Olympic programme but was unsuccessful until the 1908 Summer Olympics in London [10] Four figure skating events were contested, at which Ulrich Salchow (10-time world champion) and Madge Syers won the individual titles [11] [12]\n\n\nEarly years\n A predecessor, the Nordic Games, were organised by General Viktor

[10] Four figure skating events were contested, at which Ulrich Salchow (10-time world champion) and Madge Syers won the individual titles [11] [12]\n\n\n1920 to 1936\nThe first Olympics after the war, the 1920 Summer Olympics, were held in Antwerp, Belgium, [16] and featured figure skating [17] and an ice hockey tournament Germany, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey were banned from competing in the games At the IOC Congress held the following year it was decided that the host nation of the 1924 Summer Olympics, France, would host a separate \"International Winter Sports Week\" under the patronage of the IOC Chamonix was chosen to host this week (actually 11 days) of events.\n\n\n1948 to 1962\nSt Moritz was selected to host the first post-war games, in 1948 Switzerland's neutrality had protected the town during World War II, and most venues from the 1928 games remained in place, which made St Moritz a logical choice It became the first city to host a Winter Olympics twice [36] Twenty-eight countries competed in Switzerland, but athletes from Germany and Japan were not invited [37] Controversy erupted when two hockey teams from the United States arrived, both claiming to be the legitimate U.S Olympic hockey representative The Olympic flag presented at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp was stolen, as was its replacement There was unprecedented parity at these games, during which 10 countries won gold medals—more than any games to that point [38]\n\n\n1964 to 1980\nThe Austrian city of Innsbruck was the host in 1964 For the first time, the Olympic torch of the Winter Olympic Games was lit at the traditional ritual held in the temple of Olympia.Although Innsbruck was a traditional winter sports resort, unprojected warm weather caused a lack of snow and organisers were unable to save enough snow to be used during the Games, and the Austrian army was enlisted to transport snow and ice from other places to the sports venues [52] Soviet speed-skater Lidia Skoblikova made history by winning all four-speed skating events Her career total of six gold medals set a record for Winter Olympics athletes [52] Also, for the first time Luge was added to the Olympic program, but the sport received bad publicity when a competitor was killed in a pre-Olympic training run [55] [56]\n\n\n1984 to 1998\nSapporo, Japan, and Gothenburg, Sweden, were front-runners to host the 1984 Winter Olympics It was therefore a surprise when Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, was selected as host [74] The Games were well-organised and not affected by the run-up to the war that engulfed the country eight years later [75] A total of 49 nations and 1,272 athletes participated in 39 events Host nation Yugoslavia won its first Olympic medal when alpine skier Jure Franko won silver in the giant slalom Another sporting highlight was the free dance performance of British ice dancers Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean; their Boléro routine received unanimous perfect scores for artistic impression, earning them the gold medal [75]\n\n\n2002 to 2022\nAfter a tumultuous host city process, the 2002 Winter Olympics were held in Salt Lake City, United States 2,399 athletes from 77 National Olympic Committees participated in 78 events in 7 sports [92] These Games were the first to take place since the September 11 attacks of 2001, which meant a higher degree of security to avoid a terrorist attack The opening ceremony saw signs of the aftermath of the events of that day, including the flag that flew at Ground Zero, and honour guards of NYPD and FDNY members [93]\n\n\nFuture\nThe 2026 Winter Olympics will be held in Milan-Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, and take place between 6 and 22 February 2026 [124]  At the 142nd IOC Session in July 2024, it was confirmed that the 2030 Winter Olympics will be hosted by France in the French Alps [125] The 2034 Winter Olympics was also awarded simultaneously to be hosted by the United States in Salt Lake City, Utah, where the Olympics were held previously in 2002 [126]\n\n\nProblems and politics\nThe process for awarding host city honours came under intense scrutiny after Salt Lake City had been awarded the right to host the 2002 Games [127] Soon after the host city had been announced it was discovered that the organisers had engaged in an elaborate bribery scheme to curry favour with IOC officials [127] Gifts and other financial considerations were given to those who would evaluate and vote on Salt Lake City's bid These gifts included medical treatment for relatives, a college scholarship for one member's son and a land deal in Utah Even IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch received two rifles valued at $2,000 Samaranch defended the gift as inconsequential since, as president, he was a non-voting member [128]\n\n\nControversy\nThe process for awarding host city honours came under intense scrutiny after Salt Lake City had been awarded the right to host the 2002 Games [127] Soon after the host

in addition, it is observed by four Australian states and one territory; and in the United States, it is observed by all states except Hawaii and Arizona (within the latter, however, the Navajo Nation does observe it) [2]\n\n\nRationale\nIndustrialized societies usually follow a clock-based schedule for daily activities that do not change throughout the course of the year The time of day that individuals begin and end work or school, and the coordination of mass transit, for example, usually remain constant year-round In contrast, an agrarian society's daily routines for work and personal conduct are more likely governed by the length of daylight hours [9] [10] and by solar time, which change seasonally because of the Earth's axial tilt North and south of the tropics, daylight lasts longer in that hemisphere's summer and is shorter in that hemisphere's winter, with the effect becoming greater the farther one moves away from the equator DST is of little use for locations near the Equator, because these regions see only a small variation in daylight over the course of the year.\n\n\nVariation within a time zone\nThe effect of daylight saving time also varies according to how far east or west the location is within its time zone, with locations farther east inside the time zone benefiting more from DST than locations farther west in the same time zone [18] In spite of a width spanning thousands of kilometers, all of China is located within a single time zone per government mandate, minimizing any potential benefit of daylight saving time there.\n\n\nHistory\nAncient civilizations adjusted daily schedules to the sun more flexibly than DST does, often dividing daylight into 12 hours regardless of daytime, so that each daylight hour became progressively longer during spring and shorter during autumn [19] For example, the Romans kept time with water clocks that had different scales for different months of the year; at Rome's latitude, the third hour from sunrise (hora tertia) started at 09:02 solar time and lasted 44 minutes at the winter solstice, but at the summer solstice it started at 06:58 and lasted 75 minutes [20] From the 14th century onward, equal-length civil hours supplanted unequal ones, so civil time no longer varied by season Unequal hours are still used in a few traditional settings, such as monasteries of Mount Athos [21] and in Jewish ceremonies [22]\n\n\nProcedure\nThe relevant authorities usually schedule clock changes to occur at (or soon after) midnight and on a weekend, in order to lessen disruption to weekday schedules [45] A one-hour change is usual, but twenty-minute and two-hour changes have been used in the past Notable exceptions today include Lord Howe Island with a thirty-minute change, and Troll (research station) that shifts two hours directly between CEST and GMT since 2016 [46]\nIn all countries that observe daylight saving time seasonally (i.e., during summer and not winter), the clock is advanced from standard time to daylight saving time in the spring, and it is turned back from daylight saving time to standard time in the autumn \n\n\nPolitics, religion and sport\nThe concept of daylight saving has caused controversy since its early proposals [66] Winston Churchill argued that it enlarges \"the opportunities for the pursuit of health and happiness among the millions of people who live in this country\" [67] and pundits have dubbed it \"Daylight Slaving Time\" [68] Retailing, sports, and tourism interests have historically favored daylight saving, while agricultural and evening-entertainment interests (and some religious groups [69] [70] [71] [72]) have opposed it;

this can be time-consuming, particularly for mechanical clocks that cannot be moved backward safely [149] People who work across time zone boundaries need to keep track of multiple DST rules, as not all locations observe DST or observe it the same way The length of the calendar day becomes variable; it is no longer always 24 hours Disruption to meetings, travel, broadcasts, billing systems, and records management is common, and can be expensive [150] During an autumn transition from 02:00 to 01:00, a clock shows local times from 01:00:00 through 01:59:59 twice, possibly leading to confusion [151]\n\n\nRemediation\nSome clock-shift problems could be avoided by adjusting clocks continuously [155] or at least more gradually [156]—for example, Willett at first suggested weekly 20-minute transitions—but this would add complexity and has never been implemented DST inherits and can magnify the disadvantages of standard time For example, when reading a sundial, one must compensate for it along with time zone and natural discrepancies [157] Also, sun-exposure guidelines such as avoiding the sun within two hours of noon become less accurate when DST is in effect [158]\n\n\nTerminology\n\nAs explained by Richard Meade in the English Journal of the (American) National Council of Teachers of English, the form daylight savings time (with an \"s\") was already much more common than the older form daylight saving time in American English (\"the change has been virtually accomplished\") in 1978 Nevertheless, dictionaries such as Merriam-Webster's, American Heritage, and Oxford, which typically describe actual usage instead of prescribing outdated usage (and therefore also list the newer form), still list the older form first This is because the older form is still very common in print and is preferred by many editors (\"Although daylight saving time is considered correct, daylight savings time (with an \"s\") is commonly used.\") [159] The first two words are sometimes hyphenated (daylight-saving(s) time) Merriam-Webster's also lists the forms daylight saving, daylight savings (both without \"time\"), and daylight time [160] The Oxford Dictionary of American Usage and Style explains the development and current situation as follows:\n\nComputing\nChanges to DST rules cause problems in existing computer installations For example, the 2007 change to DST rules in North America required that many computer systems be upgraded, with the greatest onus on e-mail and calendar programs The upgrades required a significant effort by corporate information technologists [163]\n\n\nIANA time zone database\nThe tz database maps a name to the named location's historical and predicted clock shifts This database is used by many computer software systems, including most Unix-like operating systems, Java, and the Oracle RDBMS; [167] HP's \"tztab\" database is similar but incompatible [168] When temporal authorities change DST rules, zoneinfo updates are installed as part of ordinary system maintenance In Unix-like systems the TZ environment variable specifies the location name, as in TZ=':America/New_York' In many of those systems there is also a system-wide setting that is applied if the TZ environment variable is not set: this setting is controlled by the contents of the /etc/localtime file, which is usually a symbolic link or hard link to one of the zoneinfo files Internal time is stored in time-zone-independent Unix time; the TZ is used by each of potentially many simultaneous users and processes to independently localize time display.\n\n\nOpposition to clock changes\nA move to permanent daylight saving time (staying on summer hours all year with no clock shifts) is sometimes advocated and is currently implemented in some jurisdictions such as Argentina, Belarus, [170] Iceland, Kyrgyzstan, Morocco, [53] Namibia, Saskatchewan, Singapore, Syria, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Yukon Although Saskatchewan follows Central Standard Time, its capital city Regina experiences solar noon close to 13:00, in effect putting the city on permanent daylight time Similarly, Yukon is classified as being in the Mountain Time Zone, though in effect it observes permanent Pacific Daylight Time to align with the Pacific time zone in summer, but local solar noon in the capital Whitehorse occurs nearer to 14:00, in effect putting Whitehorse on \"double daylight time\" [citation needed]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Daylight Saving Time\n\nDaylight Saving Time (DST) is a practice of temporarily advancing clocks during the summer months by one hour so that people can make the most of the sunlight during their waking hours. The clocks are moved forward one hour in the spring, typically in March or April, and then moved back one hour in the fall, usually in September or October. The main purpose of DST is to make better use of natural daylight during the summer months when the days are longer.\n\n**Overview**\n\nDaylight Saving Time is not usually observed near the Equator, where the difference between summer and winter daylight hours is relatively small. Conversely, it is often not observed in places at high latitudes, where the variations in sunrise and sunset times would provide little benefit from a one-hour clock shift. Only 34% of the world's countries use DST, and some countries observe it only in certain regions. For example, in Canada, Yukon, most of Saskatchewan, and parts of Nunavut, Ontario, British Columbia, and Quebec do not observe DST. Similarly, in the United States, Hawaii and Arizona (except for the Navajo Nation) do not observe DST.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nIndustrialized societies usually follow a clock-based schedule for daily activities that do not change throughout the year. The time of day that individuals begin and end work or school, and the coordination of mass transit, for example, usually remain constant year-round. In contrast, agrarian societies' daily routines for work and personal conduct are more likely governed by the length of daylight hours and by solar time, which change seasonally due to the Earth's axial tilt. North and south of the tropics, daylight lasts longer in that hemisphere's summer and is shorter in that hemisphere's winter, with the effect becoming greater the farther one moves away from the equator. Daylight Saving Time is of little use for locations near the Equator, as these regions see only a small variation in daylight over the course of the year.\n\n**Variation within a time zone**\n\nThe effect of Daylight Saving Time also varies according to how far east or west a location is within its time zone. Locations farther east inside the time zone benefit more from DST than locations farther west in the same time zone. This is because the later sunrise and earlier sunset times in the west result in less daylight during the working hours, which reduces the benefits of DST. In spite of a width spanning thousands of kilometers, all of China is located within a single time zone per government mandate, minimizing any potential benefit of Daylight Saving Time there.\n\n**History**\n\nAncient civilizations adjusted daily schedules to the sun more flexibly than DST does, often dividing daylight into 12 hours regardless of daytime, so that each daylight hour became progressively longer during spring and shorter during autumn. For example, the Romans kept time with water clocks that had different scales for different months of the year. From the 14th century onward, equal-length civil hours supplanted unequal ones, so civil time no longer varied by season. Unequal hours are still used in a few traditional settings, such as monasteries of Mount Athos and in Jewish ceremonies.\n\n**Procedure**\n\nThe relevant authorities usually schedule clock changes to occur at (or soon after) midnight and on a weekend, in order to lessen disruption to weekday schedules. A one-hour change is usual, but twenty-minute and two-hour changes have been used in the past. Notable exceptions today include Lord Howe Island with a thirty-minute change, and Troll (research station) that shifts two hours directly between CEST and GMT since 2016. In all countries that observe Daylight Saving Time seasonally, the clock is advanced from standard time to Daylight Saving Time in the spring, and it is turned back from Daylight Saving Time to standard time in the autumn.\n\n**Politics, religion, and sport**\n\nThe concept of Daylight Saving Time has caused controversy since its early proposals. Winston Churchill argued that it enlarges \"the opportunities for the pursuit of health and happiness among the millions of people who live in this country.\" Retailing, sports, and tourism interests have historically favored Daylight Saving Time, while agricultural and evening-entertainment interests (and some religious groups) have opposed it. Energy crises and war prompted its initial adoption.\n\n**Religion**\n\nSome religious groups and individuals have opposed Daylight Saving Time on religious grounds. For religious Muslims and Jews, it makes religious practices such as prayer and fasting more difficult or inconvenient. Some Muslim countries, such as Morocco, have temporarily abandoned Daylight Saving Time during Ramadan.\n\n**Effects**\n\nProponents of Daylight Saving Time generally argue that it saves energy, promotes outdoor leisure activity in the evening (in summer), and is therefore good for physical and psychological health. They also argue that it reduces traffic accidents, reduces crime, or is good for business. Opponents argue that the actual energy savings are inconclusive.\n\n**Effects on electricity consumption**\n\nProponents of Daylight Saving Time generally argue that it saves energy, promotes outdoor leisure activity in the evening (in summer), and is therefore good for physical and psychological health. They also argue that it reduces traffic accidents, reduces crime, or is good for business. Opponents argue that the actual energy savings are inconclusive.\n\n**Economic effects**\n\nIt has been argued that clock shifts correlate with decreased economic efficiency, and that in 2000, the Daylight Saving Time effect implied an estimated one-day loss of $31 billion on US stock exchanges. Others have asserted that the observed results depend on methodology and disputed the findings, though the original authors have refuted points raised by disputers.\n\n**Effects on health**\n\nThere are measurable adverse effects of clock-shifts on human health. It has been shown to disrupt human circadian rhythms, negatively affecting human health in the process. The yearly Daylight Saving Time clock-shifts can increase health risks such as heart attacks and traffic accidents.\n\n**Effects on social relations**\n\nDaylight Saving Time hurts prime-time television broadcast ratings, drive-ins, and other theaters. Artificial outdoor lighting has a marginal and sometimes even contradictory influence on crime and fear of crime.\n\n**Inconvenience**\n\nDaylight Saving Time's clock shifts have the disadvantage of complexity. People must remember to change their clocks, which can be time-consuming, particularly for mechanical clocks that cannot be moved backward safely. People who work across time zone boundaries need to keep track of multiple Daylight Saving Time rules, as not all locations observe it or observe it the same way. The length of the calendar day becomes variable; it is no longer always 24 hours. Disruption to meetings, travel, broadcasts, billing systems, and records management is common, and can be expensive.\n\n**Remediation**\n\nSome clock-shift problems could be avoided by adjusting clocks continuously or at least more gradually. For example, Willett at first suggested weekly 20-minute transitions, but this would add complexity and has never been implemented. Daylight Saving Time inherits and can magnify the disadvantages of standard time. For example, when reading a sundial, one must compensate for it along with time zone and natural discrepancies. Also, sun-exposure guidelines such as avoiding the sun within two hours of noon become less accurate when Daylight Saving Time is in effect.\n\n**Terminology**\n\nThe form Daylight Saving Time (with an \"s\") was already much more common than the older form Daylight Saving Time in American English in 1978. Nevertheless, dictionaries such as Merriam-Webster's, American Heritage, and Oxford still list the older form first. The first two words are sometimes hyphenated (daylight-saving(s) time). Merriam-Webster's also lists the forms Daylight Saving, Daylight Savings (both without \"time\"), and Daylight Time.\n\n**Computing**\n\nChanges to Daylight Saving Time rules cause problems in existing computer installations. For example, the 2007 change to Daylight Saving Time rules in North America required that many computer systems be upgraded, with the greatest onus on e-mail and calendar programs. The upgrades required a significant effort by corporate information technologists.\n\n**IANA time zone database**\n\nThe tz database maps a name to the named location's historical and predicted clock shifts. This database is used by many computer software systems, including most Unix-like operating systems, Java, and the Oracle RDBMS. When temporal authorities change Daylight Saving Time rules, zoneinfo updates are installed as part of ordinary system maintenance.\n\n**Opposition to clock changes**\n\nA move to permanent Daylight Saving Time (staying on summer hours all year with no clock shifts) is sometimes advocated and is currently implemented in some jurisdictions such as Argentina, Belarus, Iceland, Kyrgyzstan, Morocco, Namibia, Saskatchewan, Singapore, Syria, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Yukon.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Daylight_saving_time\" following this outline:\n\n\nOverview\nDST is not usually observed near the Equator, where sunrise and sunset times do not vary enough to justify it;

at Rome's latitude, the third hour from sunrise (hora tertia) started at 09:02 solar time and lasted 44 minutes at the winter solstice, but at the summer solstice it started at 06:58 and lasted 75 minutes [20] From the 14th century onward, equal-length civil hours supplanted unequal ones, so civil time no longer varied by season Unequal hours are still used in a few traditional settings, such as monasteries of Mount Athos [21] and in Jewish ceremonies [22]\n\n\nProcedure\nThe relevant authorities usually schedule clock changes to occur at (or soon after) midnight and on a weekend, in order to lessen disruption to weekday schedules [45] A one-hour change is usual, but twenty-minute and two-hour changes have been used in the past Notable exceptions today include Lord Howe Island with a thirty-minute change, and Troll (research station) that shifts two hours directly between CEST and GMT since 2016 [46]\nIn all countries that observe daylight saving time seasonally (i.e., during summer and not winter), the clock is advanced from standard time to daylight saving time in the spring, and it is turned back from daylight saving time to standard time in the autumn \n\n\nPolitics, religion and sport\nThe concept of daylight saving has caused controversy since its early proposals [66] Winston Churchill argued that it enlarges \"the opportunities for the pursuit of health and happiness among the millions of people who live in this country\" [67] and pundits have dubbed it \"Daylight Slaving Time\" [68] Retailing, sports, and tourism interests have historically favored daylight saving, while agricultural and evening-entertainment interests (and some religious groups [69] [70] [71] [72]) have opposed it; energy crises and war prompted its initial adoption [73]\n\n\nReligion\nSome religious groups and individuals have opposed DST on religious grounds For religious Muslims and Jews it makes religious practices such as prayer and fasting more difficult or inconvenient [103] [70] [71] [72]\nSome Muslim countries, such as Morocco, have temporarily abandoned DST during Ramadan [72]\n\n\nEffects\nProponents of DST generally argue that it saves energy, promotes outdoor leisure activity in the evening (in summer), and is therefore good for physical and psychological health, [107] reduces traffic accidents, reduces crime or is good for business [108] Opponents argue the actual energy savings are inconclusive [109]\n\n\nEffects on electricity consumption\nProponents of DST generally argue that it saves energy, promotes outdoor leisure activity in the evening (in summer), and is therefore good for physical and psychological health, [107] reduces traffic accidents, reduces crime or is good for business [108] Opponents argue the actual energy savings are inconclusive [109]\n\n\nEconomic effects\nIt has been argued that clock shifts correlate with decreased economic efficiency and that in 2000, the daylight-saving effect implied an estimated one-day loss of $31 billion on US stock exchanges [116] Others have asserted that the observed results depend on methodology [117] and disputed the findings, [118] though the original authors have refuted points raised by disputers [119]\n\n\nEffects on health\nThere are measurable adverse effects of clock-shifts on human health [120] It has been shown to disrupt human circadian rhythms, [121] negatively affecting human health in the process, [122] and that the yearly DST clock-shifts can increase health risks such as heart attacks [123] and traffic accidents [124] [125]\n\n\nEffects on social relations\nDST hurts prime-time television broadcast ratings, [141] [123] drive-ins and other theaters [142] Artificial outdoor lighting has a marginal and sometimes even contradictory influence on crime and fear of crime [143]\n\n\nInconvenience\nDST's clock shifts have the disadvantage of complexity People must remember to change their clocks; this can be time-consuming, particularly for mechanical clocks that cannot be moved backward safely [149] People who work across time zone boundaries need to keep track of multiple DST rules, as not all locations observe DST or observe it the same way The length of the calendar day becomes variable; it is no longer always 24 hours Disruption to meetings, travel, broadcasts, billing systems, and records management is common, and can be expensive [150] During an autumn transition from 02:00 to 01:00, a clock shows local times from 01:00:00 through 01:59:59 twice, possibly leading to confusion [151]\n\n\nRemediation\nSome clock-shift problems could be avoided by adjusting clocks continuously [155] or at least more gradually [156]—for example, Willett at first suggested weekly 20-minute transitions—but this would add complexity and has never been implemented DST inherits and can magnify the disadvantages of standard time For example, when reading a sundial, one must compensate for it along with time zone and natural discrepancies [157] Also, sun-exposure guidelines such as avoiding the sun within two hours of noon become less accurate when DST is in effect [158]\n\n\nTerminology\n\nAs explained by Richard Meade in the English Journal of the (American) National Council of Teachers of English, the form daylight savings time (with an \"s\") was already much more common than the older form daylight saving time in American English (\"the change has been virtually accomplished\") in 1978 Nevertheless, dictionaries such as Merriam-Webster's, American Heritage, and Oxford, which typically describe actual usage instead of prescribing outdated usage (and therefore also list the newer form), still list the older form first This is because the older form is still very common in print and is preferred by many editors (\"Although daylight saving time is considered correct, daylight savings time (with an \"s\") is commonly used.\") [159] The first two words are sometimes hyphenated (daylight-saving(s) time) Merriam-Webster's also lists the forms daylight saving, daylight savings (both without \"time\"), and daylight time [160] The Oxford Dictionary of American Usage and Style explains the development and current situation as follows:\n\nComputing\nChanges to DST rules cause problems in existing computer installations For example, the 2007 change to DST rules in North America required that many computer systems be upgraded, with the greatest onus on e-mail and calendar programs The upgrades required a significant effort by corporate information technologists [163]\n\n\nIANA time zone database\nThe tz database maps a name to the named location's historical and predicted clock shifts This database is used by many computer software systems, including most Unix-like operating systems, Java, and the Oracle RDBMS; [167] HP's \"tztab\" database is similar but incompatible [168] When temporal authorities change DST rules, zoneinfo updates are installed as part of ordinary system maintenance In Unix-like systems the TZ environment variable specifies the location name, as in TZ=':America/New_York' In many of those systems there is also a system-wide setting that is applied if the TZ environment variable is not set: this setting is controlled by the contents of the /etc/localtime file, which is usually a symbolic link or hard link to one of the zoneinfo files Internal time is stored in time-zone-independent Unix time; the TZ is used by each of potentially many simultaneous users and processes to independently localize time display.\n\n\nOpposition to clock changes\nA move to permanent daylight saving time (staying on summer hours all year with no clock shifts) is sometimes advocated and is currently implemented in some jurisdictions such as Argentina, Belarus, [170] Iceland, Kyrgyzstan, Morocco, [53] Namibia, Saskatchewan, Singapore, Syria, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Yukon Although Saskatchewan follows Central Standard Time, its capital city Regina experiences solar noon close to 13:00, in effect putting the city on permanent daylight time Similarly, Yukon is classified as being in the Mountain Time Zone, though in effect it observes permanent Pacific Daylight Time to align with the Pacific time zone in summer, but local solar noon in the capital Whitehorse occurs nearer to 14:00, in effect putting Whitehorse on \"double daylight time\" [citation needed]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

disturbance incident\nOn August 12, 2021, a witness called 9-1-1 to report that a couple (later identified as Laundrie and Petito) were fighting in front of the Moonflower Community Cooperative in Moab, Utah [11] The caller said they saw a man slap a woman, after which the man and woman ran up and down the sidewalk, then the man hit the woman again before they drove off together [13] Another witness described the incident to police as looking like Petito and Laundrie were talking \"aggressively\" and that Petito \"was punching him in the arm\" The witness said it looked like Laundrie was trying to leave Petito behind and take her phone with him Before they drove off together, she climbed into the driver's seat, moved over into the passenger's seat so he could drive, and asked him, \"Why do you have to be so mean?\" [14]\n\n\nLast reported activities and sightings\nOn August 17, Laundrie took a flight from Salt Lake City to Tampa, Florida, leaving Petito behind Petito spent

that the manner of death was homicide by \"blunt-force injuries to the head and neck, with manual strangulation\", [48] which occurred three to four weeks before the body was found [13]\n\n\nSearch for Laundrie and discovery of remains\nOn September 23, the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming issued an arrest warrant for Laundrie due to his unauthorized use of Petito's debit

Laundrie directly involved in the tragic death of Gabby Petito The FBI's primary focus throughout the investigation was to bring justice to Gabby and her family.\" [60]\n\n\nPublic interest\nThe case sparked more public interest and coverage on news and social media than other missing persons and murder cases [63] [64] [65] This heightened interest was attributed to several factors, such as the refusal by Laundrie and his parents to comment on Petito's whereabouts, [13] the amount of content on social media documenting the couple's lifestyle, [66] the video footage of the Utah traffic stop, the audio recording of the 9-1-1 call, [63] [66] [67] the video posts by witnesses which provided a lot of publicly available evidence, the idea that those involved were a young and attractive couple in a romantic getaway gone wrong, [64] [66] the domestic violence incidents in their relationship, an increased interest in cross-country van-dwelling trips due to the COVID-19 pandemic, [66] and the

November 30, 2023, amended complaint claiming pain and emotional distress due to Laundrie's parents and their attorney withholding information regarding Petito's death [76] A Florida judge previously allowed the suit to proceed [77] On November 17, 2022, in a lawsuit for wrongful death brought against Laundrie's estate by Petito's estate, her estate was awarded $3 million, the recovery of which

and the unproductive wanderings of two hostile militias might have been used to stoke the rivalry between a few supporters of the two opposing teams  [19]  [20] The inaugural game, held at Ann Arbor, resulted in a lopsided victory for Michigan, with the Wolverines posting a 34–0 win over Ohio State's Buckeyes [21] The teams did not meet in 1898 or 1899, but played again in 1900.\n\n\n\"Snow Bowl\" and Woody Hayes (1950–1968)\nOne of the more famous games in the rivalry is the 1950 contest, colloquially known as the Snow Bowl Eighth-ranked Ohio State, coached by Wes Fesler, was scheduled to host the game on November 25 in Columbus amidst one of the worst blizzards on Ohio record The Buckeyes, who led the Big Ten, were granted the option to cancel the game against Michigan, which would have, by default, given the Buckeyes the Big Ten title outright Ohio State refused, and the game was set to be played Amid howling snow and wind, in a famous example of a \"field position\" game, the teams exchanged 45 punts, often on first down, in hopes that the other team would fumble the ball near or into their own end zone Ohio State's Vic Janowicz, who would claim the Heisman Trophy that year, punted 21 times for 685 yards and also kicked a field goal in the first quarter for the Buckeyes' only points Michigan capitalized on two blocked punts, booting one out of the back of the end zone for a safety and recovering another one in the end zone for a touchdown just before halftime Despite failing to gain a single first down or complete a single forward pass, Michigan gained a 9–3 victory, securing the Big Ten title and a Rose Bowl berth Heavy criticism of Fesler's play calling led to his resignation and the hiring of Woody Hayes as his successor.\n\n\n\"Ten-Year War\": Hayes vs Schembechler (1969–1978)\nWolverines coach Bump Elliott resigned after the 1968 loss and Michigan hired Miami (Ohio) head coach Bo Schembechler, who had previously been an assistant coach at Ohio State under Hayes, to revitalize its football program On November 22, 1969, Hayes led his top-ranked Buckeyes into Michigan Stadium to face Schembechler's Wolverines in the first matchup between two coaches who would come to define the rivalry between the two programs The Buckeyes brought a 22-game winning streak into Ann Arbor, but behind an inspiring 60-yard punt return by Barry Pierson that set up a Wolverine touchdown in the second quarter, and a defense that intercepted Ohio State six times (three by Pierson), the Wolverines won a defensive battle (both teams were scoreless in the second half) for a 24–12 upset.\n\n\nSchembechler vs Bruce (1979–1987)\nEarle Bruce took over for Hayes and led the Buckeyes to a 5–4 record against Schembechler's Wolverines between 1979 and 1987, perhaps the most balanced stretch of the rivalry, during which neither team won more than two consecutive games In 1987, Bruce was fired in the week before the Michigan game due to a poor season record, but was allowed to coach anyway, and the inspired Buckeyes (each wearing a sweatband labeled \"Earle\") won an upset over the heavily favored Wolverines After the game, Bo Schembechler told Bruce, \"I always mind losing to Ohio State but I didn't mind so much today.\" [25] After 1987, the series stood at 46–33–5 in favor of UM.\n\n\nJohn Cooper era (1988–2000)\nThe 13 games during John Cooper's tenure as Buckeye coach were dominated by Michigan, as the Wolverines went 10–2–1 during the stretch Schembechler coached Michigan through the 1989 season and then turned over the reins to one of his assistants, Gary Moeller, who led the team for five seasons before another longtime Michigan assistant, Lloyd Carr, became the head coach in 1995.\n\n\nEnter Jim Tressel (2001–2006)\nIn 2001, Youngstown State head football coach Jim Tressel took over as Buckeye head coach Unlike his predecessor John Cooper, Tressel put a special emphasis on the rivalry In his introductory speech at halftime of a January basketball game, against Michigan, he said \"I can assure you that you will be proud of our young people, in the classroom, in the community, and most especially in 310 days in Ann Arbor, Michigan on the football field.\" In his first year, Tressel registered the Buckeyes' first defeat of the Wolverines in Ann Arbor in 14 years, by a 26–20 score Led by senior running back Jonathan Wells, the Buckeyes raced to a 23–0 halftime lead With Wells out, Michigan mounted a second half comeback that fell just short The next year, Tressel achieved what Cooper could not: Beating Michigan in consecutive years with a 14–9 victory The game was decided on the last play when defensive back Will Allen intercepted a pass at the two yard line as time expired to clinch the victory The Buckeyes were led by freshman running back Maurice Clarett, who ran for 119 yards and one touchdown He also had a key reception to set up Maurice Hall's game-winning score The Buckeyes went on to win the national championship that season, as they defeated Miami in the Fiesta Bowl.\n\n\n2006: Game of The Century\nOn November 18, 2006, Ohio State and Michigan met for their annual showdown, each carrying an 11–0 record For the first time in the history of the rivalry, the two rivals faced off while holding the top two spots in the Bowl Championship Series rankings Ohio State won the game by a score of 42–39 and became the outright Big Ten champion, earning the right to play for a national championship at the BCS National Championship Game in Glendale, Arizona Michigan struck first with a touchdown run by junior running back Mike Hart, but the Buckeyes then scored 21 unanswered points, and at halftime, they were up 28–14 Thanks to an interception and a fumble recovery by junior defensive tackle Alan Branch, Michigan made it 35–31 Ohio State with 14 minutes to go in the fourth quarter But after appearing to have forced Ohio State into a fourth-down situation with six minutes to go, junior outside linebacker Shawn Crable was called for roughing the passer, giving the Buckeyes a fresh set of downs Ohio State quarterback Troy Smith then passed to Brian Robiskie for a touchdown, increasing the Buckeyes' lead to 42–31 with five minutes remaining in the game After Ohio State was called for pass interference on a failed fourth-down attempt, giving Michigan an automatic first down, junior quarterback Chad Henne found senior tight end Tyler Ecker for a 16-yard touchdown with two minutes to go to cut the OSU lead to 42–37 Senior wide receiver Steve Breaston caught the two-point conversion to bring the Wolverines within a field goal Michigan needed to recover the ensuing onside kick, but they failed to do so The Buckeyes ran out the clock for the victory, and a trip to the BCS national championship game Troy Smith completed 71% of his passes for 316 yards and four touchdowns, essentially clinching the Heisman trophy Ginn caught eight passes for 104 yards and a touchdown Ohio State running back Antonio Pittman ran for 139 yards on 18 carries for a 7.7 yards-per-carry average Michigan running back Mike Hart carried the ball 23 times for 142 yards and three touchdowns against a stout Buckeye defense Chad Henne had 267 yards, two touchdowns, and no turnovers on a 60% completion percentage Neither performance was, however, sufficient to turn the tide in favor of the Wolverines The game was highly touted by ESPN/ABC (there was a game countdown clock for a week before kickoff) and was viewed by the largest television audience for a regular-season college football game since 1993, averaging 21.8 million viewers [31] The victory marked the first time in 43 years that the Buckeyes had won three consecutive games in the series The game gained even more significance when, on the eve of the meeting, Michigan head coach and former Ohio State assistant coach Bo Schembechler died Schembechler was honored with a video tribute at Ohio Stadium as well as a moment of silence before kickoff [32]\nHalf an hour after the game ended, the Ohio Lottery PICK 4 evening drawing was 4–2–3–9, matching the final score of the game and paying out up to $5,000 per winner, for a total payout of $2.2 million [33]\n\n\nA carousel of coaches (2007–2014)\nLloyd Carr retired as coach at Michigan following the 2007 season, which included a 14–3 loss to Ohio State Tressel had compiled a 6–1 record against Carr's Michigan teams, leaving Carr with a 6–7 career record against the Buckeyes In December 2007, Michigan hired West Virginia head coach Rich Rodriguez to take over the football program Rodriguez, known for his expertise in the spread offense, represented a significant departure from the Wolverines' traditional power running style Furthermore, both Carr and his predecessor Gary Moeller had been apprenticed by the now-legendary Schembechler, and Rodriguez's hiring marked the first time in 40 years that a Michigan football team would not be coached by a member of the \"Woody Hayes coaching tree\".\n\n\nHarbaugh vs Meyer (2015–2018)\nThe 2015 game in Ann Arbor marked Harbaugh's first game as a head coach in the rivalry His Michigan team was 9–2 coming into the game and Ohio State was 10–1 For the first time since 2006, both teams were ranked in the top 10, with Ohio State at No 8 and Michigan at No 10 [40] The first half was close, with Michigan scoring a touchdown shortly before halftime to narrow Ohio State's lead to 14–10 Ohio State, however, scored touchdowns on each of its first four possessions in the second half, while Michigan could only muster a single field goal The final score was 42–13, in favor of Ohio State.\n\n\nHarbaugh vs Day (2019–2023)\nThe 2019 game matched #1 Ohio State at #13 Michigan This was the Buckeyes' first full season under new head coach Ryan Day, who took over the program following the retirement of Meyer Day previously served as the offensive coordinator under Meyer  Undefeated Ohio State came into the game favored by nine and aimed to win their eighth straight game in the series, the longest in Ohio State's history and the second longest in the series Behind over 300 passing yards from Justin Fields and 200 yards rushing from J K Dobbins, and 4 touchdowns from each player, Ohio State cruised to a 56–27 victory Following the loss, Harbaugh faced tough questions from the press after he became the first coach to go 0–5 in the series, and second after the Buckeyes' John Cooper (0–4–1) to go winless in his first five games When asked about the gap between the two schools, his reply was described as testy by multiple sources: [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] \"I'll answer your questions, not your insults.\" [53]\n\n\n2022 and 2023: Top-3 matchups\nAfter Michigan and Ohio State entered the 2022 college football season with high preseason expectations (AP ranked #8 and #2, respectively), they found themselves dominating their respective schedules, and on November 26, 2022, both #2 Ohio State and #3 Michigan entered the game undefeated for the first time since 2006, with both teams fighting for a spot in the Big Ten Championship Game Ohio State struck first, off a 4-yard pass from quarterback C J Stroud to wide receiver Emeka Egbuka to take an early 7–0 lead After an initially stagnant performance by the Michigan offense, wide receiver Cornelius Johnson struck a 69-yard touchdown pass to tie the game at 10–10 After a 17–13 Michigan advantage following another Cornelius Johnson touchdown, Ohio State's Marvin Harrison Jr caught a 42-yard reception to put Ohio State back up 20–17 with 3:49 left to go in the second quarter, and the three point advantage lasted into halftime After halftime, Michigan would go on a 14–0 run in the third and fourth quarters, highlighted by a J J McCarthy touchdown run to put Michigan up 31–20 early in the fourth quarter After a missed kick at the Ohio State 39-yard line by Michigan's Jake Moody, Ohio State would ultimately drive down the field to end up at the Michigan 9-yard line, before Ohio State kicker Noah Ruggles converted the 27-yard kick, to cut Michigan's lead to 31–23 On the very first play of the ensuing Michigan possession, running back Donovan Edwards broke through the defense to complete a 75-yard touchdown run to put Michigan up 38–23 with 7 minutes left in the fourth quarter Ohio State received the kickoff at their 25-yard line and drove down the field, highlighted by several catches from Egbuka and Harrison, and they ended up at the Michigan 16-yard line After two incomplete passes, C.J Stroud scrambled and then threw an interception straight into the hands of Michigan defensive edge (sic) Taylor Upshaw On the ensuing Michigan possession, Donovan Edwards ran for 85 yards and scored his second touchdown of the day, putting Michigan up 45–23, with just under 3:20 remaining in the fourth quarter After an interception of Stroud by safety Makari Paige, Michigan went on to clinch their first undefeated regular season since 1997 and won the Big Ten East Division for the second consecutive year Michigan quarterback J J McCarthy finished the game with 263 passing yards and 4 touchdowns (3 passing, 1 rushing) Running back Donovan Edwards accrued 218 rushing yards on 22 carries for a 9.8 yards-per-carry average Despite a disappointing second half performance by Ohio State, wide receivers Egbuka and Harrison still shined, having 125 and 120 receiving yards, respectively.\n\n\nBig Ten expansion\nIn 2010, the Big Ten Conference announced that the University of Nebraska would be joining the Big Ten the following year, and that the Big Ten would be split into two divisions When rumors surfaced that Ohio State and Michigan would be placed in different divisions, concerns arose that the teams might no longer play the last game of the regular season to avoid potential back-to-back games if each team won their division and earned the right to play in the Big Ten Championship Game Fans bombarded the athletic directors of both schools, as well as the Big Ten commissioner with emails, creating pressure to keep The Game as the regular-season finale Ultimately, Michigan was placed in the Legends Division and Ohio State in the Leaders Division The Michigan–Ohio State game became a \"protected crossover\" game, to be played every year at the end of the regular season.\n\n\nIn popular culture\nDuring the mid-2000s, ESPN aired several commercials describing certain situations that would be \"normal, if it wasn't for sports\" One commercial featured a man in an Ohio State shirt making out with a woman wearing a Michigan shirt [64] An ESPNU commercial air portrayed a couple on a blind date that appears to be successful until it becomes clear that she is from Michigan and he is a fan of Ohio State [65]\n\n\nAccomplishments by the two rivals\nAs of January 2024, Michigan is number one and Ohio State is number three on the list of the college football teams with the most total wins, and Ohio State is number one and Michigan is number two on the list of college football teams with the highest winning percentage.\n\n\nGame results\nRankings prior to 2014 are from the AP Poll [n 1] Rankings post-2014 are from the CFP poll.\n\n\nResults by location\nSince 1936, when the AP Poll began being released

rivalry**\n\nThe Michigan–Ohio State football rivalry is one of the most famous and intense rivalries in college football. The two teams have been playing each other since 1897, and their annual matchup is considered one of the most highly anticipated and closely watched games in the sport.\n\n**Series history**\n\nThe first meeting between Michigan and Ohio State took place in 1897, and the Wolverines emerged victorious with a 34–0 win. The teams did not meet again until 1900, and since then, they have played each other nearly every year, with a few exceptions. The rivalry has been fueled by the Toledo War, a border dispute between Michigan and Ohio that was settled in the 1830s. While the war is no longer relevant, the rivalry between the two teams continues to be fierce and passionate.\n\n**Early years (1897–1949)**\n\nThe early years of the rivalry were dominated by Michigan, which won 15 of the first 20 meetings. Ohio State's first win in the series came in 1919, and the Buckeyes would go on to win several more games in the 1920s and 1930s. The rivalry gained national attention in the 1940s, as both teams began to compete at a higher level. Michigan and Ohio State met in the 1942 game, which was played in Ann Arbor, and the Wolverines emerged victorious with a 19-0 win.\n\n**\"Snow Bowl\" and Woody Hayes (1950–1968)**\n\nOne of the most famous games in the rivalry is the 1950 contest, colloquially known as the \"Snow Bowl.\" The game was played in Columbus on November 25, amidst one of the worst blizzards on record. Eighth-ranked Ohio State, coached by Wes Fesler, was scheduled to host the game against Michigan, which would have given the Buckeyes the Big Ten title outright if they had won. Ohio State refused to cancel the game, and the teams exchanged 45 punts, often on first down, in hopes that the other team would fumble the ball near or into their own end zone. Michigan capitalized on two blocked punts, booting one out of the back of the end zone for a safety and recovering another one in the end zone for a touchdown just before halftime. Despite failing to gain a single first down or complete a single forward pass, Michigan gained a 9–3 victory, securing the Big Ten title and a Rose Bowl berth. Heavy criticism of Fesler's play calling led to his resignation and the hiring of Woody Hayes as his successor.\n\n**\"Ten-Year War\": Hayes vs. Schembechler (1969–1978)**\n\nWolverines coach Bump Elliott resigned after the 1968 loss and Michigan hired Miami (Ohio) head coach Bo Schembechler to revitalize its football program. On November 22, 1969, Hayes led his top-ranked Buckeyes into Michigan Stadium to face Schembechler's Wolverines in the first matchup between two coaches who would come to define the rivalry between the two programs.

After the game, Bo Schembechler told Bruce, \"I always mind losing to Ohio State but I didn't mind so much today.\"\n\n**John Cooper era (1988–2000)**\n\nThe 13 games during John Cooper's tenure as Buckeye coach were dominated by Michigan, as the Wolverines went 10–2–1 during the stretch. Schembechler coached Michigan through the 1989 season and then turned over the reins to one of his assistants, Gary Moeller, who led the team for five seasons before another longtime Michigan assistant, Lloyd Carr, became the head coach in 1995.\n\n**Enter Jim Tressel (2001–2006)**\n\nIn 2001, Youngstown State head football coach Jim Tressel took over as Buckeye head coach.

This was the Buckeyes' first full season under new head coach Ryan Day, who took over the program following the retirement of Meyer. Day previously served as the offensive coordinator under Meyer.

"prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Michigan–Ohio_State_football_rivalry\" following this outline:\n\n\nSeries history\nWhen Michigan and Ohio State met for the first time in 1897, the Toledo War might conceivably have remained in the memories of some still living, and the unproductive wanderings of two hostile militias might have been used to stoke the rivalry between a few supporters of the two opposing teams  [19]  [20] The inaugural game, held at Ann Arbor, resulted in a lopsided victory for Michigan, with the Wolverines posting a 34–0 win over Ohio State's Buckeyes [21] The teams did not meet in 1898 or 1899, but played again in 1900.\n\n\nEarly years (1897–1949)\nWhen Michigan and Ohio State met for the first time in 1897, the Toledo War might conceivably have remained in the memories of some still living, and the unproductive wanderings of two hostile militias might have been used to stoke the rivalry between a few supporters of the two opposing teams  [19]  [20] The inaugural game, held at Ann Arbor, resulted in a lopsided victory for Michigan, with the Wolverines posting a 34–0 win over Ohio State's Buckeyes [21] The teams did not meet in 1898 or 1899, but played again in 1900.\n\n\n\"Snow Bowl\" and Woody Hayes (1950–1968)\nOne of the more famous games in the rivalry is the 1950 contest, colloquially known as the Snow Bowl Eighth-ranked Ohio State, coached by Wes Fesler, was scheduled to host the game on November 25 in Columbus amidst one of the worst blizzards on Ohio record The Buckeyes, who led the Big Ten, were granted the option to cancel the game against Michigan, which would have, by default, given the Buckeyes the Big Ten title outright Ohio State refused, and the game was set to be played Amid howling snow and wind, in a famous example of a \"field position\" game, the teams exchanged 45 punts, often on first down, in hopes that the other team would fumble the ball near or into their own end zone Ohio State's Vic Janowicz, who would claim the Heisman Trophy that year, punted 21 times for 685 yards and also kicked a field goal in the first quarter for the Buckeyes' only points Michigan capitalized on two blocked punts, booting one out of the back of the end zone for a safety and recovering another one in the end zone for a touchdown just before halftime Despite failing to gain a single first down or complete a single forward pass, Michigan gained a 9–3 victory, securing the Big Ten title and a Rose Bowl berth Heavy criticism of Fesler's play calling led to his resignation and the hiring of Woody Hayes as his successor.\n\n\n\"Ten-Year War\": Hayes vs Schembechler (1969–1978)\nWolverines coach Bump Elliott resigned after the 1968 loss and Michigan hired Miami (Ohio) head coach Bo Schembechler, who had previously been an assistant coach at Ohio State under Hayes, to revitalize its football program On November 22, 1969, Hayes led his top-ranked Buckeyes into Michigan Stadium to face Schembechler's Wolverines in the first matchup between two coaches who would come to define the rivalry between the two programs The Buckeyes brought a 22-game winning streak into Ann Arbor, but behind an inspiring 60-yard punt return by Barry Pierson that set up a Wolverine touchdown in the second quarter, and a defense that intercepted Ohio State six times (three by Pierson), the Wolverines won a defensive battle (both teams were scoreless in the second half) for a 24–12 upset.\n\n\nSchembechler vs Bruce (1979–1987)\nEarle Bruce took over for Hayes and led the Buckeyes to a 5–4 record against Schembechler's Wolverines between 1979 and 1987, perhaps the most balanced stretch of the rivalry, during which neither team won more than two consecutive games In 1987, Bruce was fired in the week before the Michigan game due to a poor season record, but was allowed to coach anyway, and the inspired Buckeyes (each wearing a sweatband labeled \"Earle\") won an upset over the heavily favored Wolverines After the game, Bo Schembechler told Bruce, \"I always mind losing to Ohio State but I didn't mind so much today.\" [25] After 1987, the series stood at 46–33–5 in favor of UM.\n\n\nJohn Cooper era (1988–2000)\nThe 13 games during John Cooper's tenure as Buckeye coach were dominated by Michigan, as the Wolverines went 10–2–1 during the stretch Schembechler coached Michigan through the 1989 season and then turned over the reins to one of his assistants, Gary Moeller, who led the team for five seasons before another longtime Michigan assistant, Lloyd Carr, became the head coach in 1995.\n\n\nEnter Jim Tressel (2001–2006)\nIn 2001, Youngstown State head football coach Jim Tressel took over as Buckeye head coach Unlike his predecessor John Cooper, Tressel put a special emphasis on the rivalry In his introductory speech at halftime of a January basketball game, against Michigan, he said \"I can assure you that you will be proud of our young people, in the classroom, in the community, and most especially in 310 days in Ann Arbor, Michigan on the football field.\" In his first year, Tressel registered the Buckeyes' first defeat of the Wolverines in Ann Arbor in 14 years, by a 26–20 score Led by senior running back Jonathan Wells, the Buckeyes raced to a 23–0 halftime lead With Wells out, Michigan mounted a second half comeback that fell just short The next year, Tressel achieved what Cooper could not: Beating Michigan in consecutive years with a 14–9 victory The game was decided on the last play when defensive back Will Allen intercepted a pass at the two yard line as time expired to clinch the victory The Buckeyes were led by freshman running back Maurice Clarett, who ran for 119 yards and one touchdown He also had a key reception to set up Maurice Hall's game-winning score The Buckeyes went on to win the national championship that season, as they defeated Miami in the Fiesta Bowl.\n\n\n2006: Game of The Century\nOn November 18, 2006, Ohio State and Michigan met for their annual showdown, each carrying an 11–0 record For the first time in the history of the rivalry, the two rivals faced off while holding the top two spots in the Bowl Championship Series rankings Ohio State won the game by a score of 42–39 and became the outright Big Ten champion, earning the right to play for a national championship at the BCS National Championship Game in Glendale, Arizona Michigan struck first with a touchdown run by junior running back Mike Hart, but the Buckeyes then scored 21 unanswered points, and at halftime, they were up 28–14 Thanks to an interception and a fumble recovery by junior defensive tackle Alan Branch, Michigan made it 35–31 Ohio State with 14 minutes to go in the fourth quarter But after appearing to have forced Ohio State into a fourth-down situation with six minutes to go, junior outside linebacker Shawn Crable was called for roughing the passer, giving the Buckeyes a fresh set of downs Ohio State quarterback Troy Smith then passed to Brian Robiskie for a touchdown, increasing the Buckeyes' lead to 42–31 with five minutes remaining in the game After Ohio State was called for pass interference on a failed fourth-down attempt, giving Michigan an automatic first down, junior quarterback Chad Henne found senior tight end Tyler Ecker for a 16-yard touchdown with two minutes to go to cut the OSU lead to 42–37 Senior wide receiver Steve Breaston caught the two-point conversion to bring the Wolverines within a field goal Michigan needed to recover the ensuing onside kick, but they failed to do so The Buckeyes ran out the clock for the victory, and a trip to the BCS national championship game Troy Smith completed 71% of his passes for 316 yards and four touchdowns, essentially clinching the Heisman trophy Ginn caught eight passes for 104 yards and a touchdown Ohio State running back Antonio Pittman ran for 139 yards on 18 carries for a 7.7 yards-per-carry average Michigan running back Mike Hart carried the ball 23 times for 142 yards and three touchdowns against a stout Buckeye defense Chad Henne had 267 yards, two touchdowns, and no turnovers on a 60% completion percentage Neither performance was, however, sufficient to turn the tide in favor of the Wolverines The game was highly touted by ESPN/ABC (there was a game countdown clock for a week before kickoff) and was viewed by the largest television audience for a regular-season college football game since 1993, averaging 21.8 million viewers [31] The victory marked the first time in 43 years that the Buckeyes had won three consecutive games in the series The game gained even more significance when, on the eve of the meeting, Michigan head coach and former Ohio State assistant coach Bo Schembechler died Schembechler was honored with a video tribute at Ohio Stadium as well as a moment of silence before kickoff [32]\nHalf an hour after the game ended, the Ohio Lottery PICK 4 evening drawing was 4–2–3–9, matching the final score of the game and paying out up to $5,000 per winner, for a total payout of $2.2 million [33]\n\n\nA carousel of coaches (2007–2014)\nLloyd Carr retired as coach at Michigan following the 2007 season, which included a 14–3 loss to Ohio State Tressel had compiled a 6–1 record against Carr's Michigan teams, leaving Carr with a 6–7 career record against the Buckeyes In December 2007, Michigan hired West Virginia head coach Rich Rodriguez to take over the football program Rodriguez, known for his expertise in the spread offense, represented a significant departure from the Wolverines' traditional power running style Furthermore, both Carr and his predecessor Gary Moeller had been apprenticed by the now-legendary Schembechler, and Rodriguez's hiring marked the first time in 40 years that a Michigan football team would not be coached by a member of the \"Woody Hayes coaching tree\".\n\n\nHarbaugh vs Meyer (2015–2018)\nThe 2015 game in Ann Arbor marked Harbaugh's first game as a head coach in the rivalry His Michigan team was 9–2 coming into the game and Ohio State was 10–1 For the first time since 2006, both teams were ranked in the top 10, with Ohio State at No 8 and Michigan at No 10 [40] The first half was close, with Michigan scoring a touchdown shortly before halftime to narrow Ohio State's lead to 14–10 Ohio State, however, scored touchdowns on each of its first four possessions in the second half, while Michigan could only muster a single field goal The final score was 42–13, in favor of Ohio State.\n\n\nHarbaugh vs Day (2019–2023)\nThe 2019 game matched #1 Ohio State at #13 Michigan This was the Buckeyes' first full season under new head coach Ryan Day, who took over the program following the retirement of Meyer Day previously served as the offensive coordinator under Meyer  Undefeated Ohio State came into the game favored by nine and aimed to win their eighth straight game in the series, the longest in Ohio State's history and the second longest in the series Behind over 300 passing yards from Justin Fields and 200 yards rushing from J K Dobbins, and 4 touchdowns from each player, Ohio State cruised to a 56–27 victory Following the loss, Harbaugh faced tough questions from the press after he became the first coach to go 0–5 in the series, and second after the Buckeyes' John Cooper (0–4–1) to go winless in his first five games When asked about the gap between the two schools, his reply was described as testy by multiple sources: [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] \"I'll answer your questions, not your insults.\" [53]\n\n\n2022 and 2023: Top-3 matchups\nAfter Michigan and Ohio State entered the 2022 college football season with high preseason expectations (AP ranked #8 and #2, respectively), they found themselves dominating their respective schedules, and on November 26, 2022, both #2 Ohio State and #3 Michigan entered the game undefeated for the first time since 2006, with both teams fighting for a spot in the Big Ten Championship Game Ohio State struck first, off a 4-yard pass from quarterback C J Stroud to wide receiver Emeka Egbuka to take an early 7–0 lead After an initially stagnant performance by the Michigan offense, wide receiver Cornelius Johnson struck a 69-yard touchdown pass to tie the game at 10–10 After a 17–13 Michigan advantage following another Cornelius Johnson touchdown, Ohio State's Marvin Harrison Jr caught a 42-yard reception to put Ohio State back up 20–17 with 3:49 left to go in the second quarter, and the three point advantage lasted into halftime After halftime, Michigan would go on a 14–0 run in the third and fourth quarters, highlighted by a J J McCarthy touchdown run to put Michigan up 31–20 early in the fourth quarter After a missed kick at the Ohio State 39-yard line by Michigan's Jake Moody, Ohio State would ultimately drive down the field to end up at the Michigan 9-yard line, before Ohio State kicker Noah Ruggles converted the 27-yard kick, to cut Michigan's lead to 31–23 On the very first play of the ensuing Michigan possession, running back Donovan Edwards broke through the defense to complete a 75-yard touchdown run to put Michigan up 38–23 with 7 minutes left in the fourth quarter Ohio State received the kickoff at their 25-yard line and drove down the field, highlighted by several catches from Egbuka and Harrison, and they ended up at the Michigan 16-yard line After two incomplete passes, C.J Stroud scrambled and then threw an interception straight into the hands of Michigan defensive edge (sic) Taylor Upshaw On the ensuing Michigan possession, Donovan Edwards ran for 85 yards and scored his second touchdown of the day, putting Michigan up 45–23, with just under 3:20 remaining in the fourth quarter After an interception of Stroud by safety Makari Paige, Michigan went on to clinch their first undefeated regular season since 1997 and won the Big Ten East Division for the second consecutive year Michigan quarterback J J McCarthy finished the game with 263 passing yards and 4 touchdowns (3 passing, 1 rushing) Running back Donovan Edwards accrued 218 rushing yards on 22 carries for a 9.8 yards-per-carry average Despite a disappointing second half performance by Ohio State, wide receivers Egbuka and Harrison still shined, having 125 and 120 receiving yards, respectively.\n\n\nBig Ten expansion\nIn 2010, the Big Ten Conference announced that the University of Nebraska would be joining the Big Ten the following year, and that the Big Ten would be split into two divisions When rumors surfaced that Ohio State and Michigan would be placed in different divisions, concerns arose that the teams might no longer play the last game of the regular season to avoid potential back-to-back games if each team won their division and earned the right to play in the Big Ten Championship Game Fans bombarded the athletic directors of both schools, as well as the Big Ten commissioner with emails, creating pressure to keep The Game as the regular-season finale Ultimately, Michigan was placed in the Legends Division and Ohio State in the Leaders Division The Michigan–Ohio State game became a \"protected crossover\" game, to be played every year at the end of the regular season.\n\n\nIn popular culture\nDuring the mid-2000s, ESPN aired several commercials describing certain situations that would be \"normal, if it wasn't for sports\" One commercial featured a man in an Ohio State shirt making out with a woman wearing a Michigan shirt [64] An ESPNU commercial air portrayed a couple on a blind date that appears to be successful until it becomes clear that she is from Michigan and he is a fan of Ohio State [65]\n\n\nAccomplishments by the two rivals\nAs of January 2024, Michigan is number one and Ohio State is number three on the list of the college football teams with the most total wins, and Ohio State is number one and Michigan is number two on the list of college football teams with the highest winning percentage.\n\n\nGame results\nRankings prior to 2014 are from the AP Poll [n 1] Rankings post-2014 are from the CFP poll.\n\n\nResults by location\nSince 1936, when the AP

Michigan was a charter member of the Big Ten in 1896 before leaving the league after the 1906 football season Ohio State began league play with the 1913 season, and Michigan returned for the 1917 season [83] The 1918 matchup between the two schools was the first between them with both as Big Ten members Ohio State vacated all their games in 2010 and Michigan cancelled the 2020 game due to \"COVID-19 positives and the associated quarantining required of close-contact individuals.\" [84]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Skid_Row,_Los_Angeles", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe term \"skid row\" or \"skid road,\" referring to an area of a city where people live who are \"on the skids,\" derives from a logging term Loggers would transport their logs to a nearby river by sliding them down roads made from greased skids Loggers who had accompanied the load to the bottom of the road would wait there for transportation back up the hill to the logging camp By extension, the term began to be used for places where people with no money and nothing to do gathered, becoming the generic term in English-speaking North America for a depressed street in a city [6]\n\n\nDemographics\nIn 2019, the Central City East's racial demographics consisted of 39.7% Black/African American, 22.3% White, 16.3% Asian, 15.1% Hispanic or Latino, 2.5% American Indian/Alaska Native, 0.6% Native Hawaiian / Other Pacific Islander, 3.1% 2+ races, and 0.5% other races.\n\n\nHistory\nAt the end of the 19th century, a number of residential hotels opened in the area as it became home to a transient population of seasonal laborers [11] [12] By the 1930s, Skid Row was home to as many as 10,000 homeless people [13] It supported saloons, residential hotels, and social services, which drew people from the populations they served to congregate in the area [14]\n\n\n1880s through 1960s\nAt the end of the 19th century, a number of residential hotels opened in the area as it became home to a transient population of seasonal laborers [11] [12] By the 1930s, Skid Row was home to as many as 10,000 homeless people [13] It supported saloons, residential hotels, and social services, which drew people from the populations they served to congregate in the area [14]\n\n\n1970s containment zone\nSkid Row was established by city officials in 1976 as an unofficial \"containment zone\", where shelters and services for homeless people would be tolerated [20]\n\n\n1987 crackdowns\nIn February 1987, LAPD chief Daryl Gates, backed by then-Mayor Tom Bradley, announced plans for another crackdown on the homeless on Skid Row [22] Police and firefighters conducted a number of sweeps through the area but the plan was abandoned due to opposition by advocates for the homeless [22]\n\n\n2000s patient dumping\nIn September 2005, hospitals and law enforcement agencies were discovered to be \"dumping\" homeless people on Skid Row Then-Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa ordered an investigation and William Bratton, LAPD chief at the time, claimed that the department was not targeting homeless people specifically, but only people who violated city ordinances [25] The Los Angeles City Attorney investigated more than 50 of about 150 reported cases of dumping [26] By early 2007, the city attorney had filed charges against only one hospital, Kaiser Permanente Because there were no laws specifically covering the hospital's actions, it was charged, in an untested strategy, with false imprisonment In response to the lack of legal recourse available to fight patient dumping, California state senator Gil Cedillo sponsored legislation against it in February 2007 [27]\n\n\n2000 to 2009\nIn 2002, newly appointed LAPD Chief William Bratton announced a plan to clean up Skid Row by, among other things, aggressively enforcing an old anti-camping ordinance [29] A man named Robert Lee Purrie was cited twice and arrested for violating the ordinance in December 2002 and January 2003 His possessions, consisting of his tent, \"blankets, clothes, cooking utensils, a hygiene kit, and other personal effects\", were thrown into the street by the police [29] [30]\n\n\n2006 Safer Cities Initiative\nThe Safer Cities Initiative (SCI) was a 68-week policy implemented in 2006 by the Los Angeles Police Department dealing with homeless encampments in Skid Row [34] The policy, led by former police chief William Bratton, assigned approximately 50 police officers to the Skid Row area to enforce stricter policing of offenses in accordance with the broken windows theory of policing Through policing these offenses (including non-violent offenses such as jaywalking or littering), [35] the LAPD sought to establish a heightened appearance of public order as a punitive deterrent for criminals One study by the LAPD claimed that four years post-implementation, crime rates had reduced by approximately 46%, while deaths dropped approximately 34% [36]\n\n\n2010s\nIn 2012, the Skid Row Running Club was founded by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Craig Mitchell, as an effort to improve the livelihood of those in the area A documentary titled “Skid Row Marathon” was made about the group, which includes homeless people, police officers, and convicted felons [39]\n\n\n2020s COVID-19 pandemic\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring individuals to take down their tents for sidewalk cleanings was suspended, with the intent of not displacing people during the cleanings, which might spread COVID-19 [41]\n\n\nCulture\nSkid Row is home to many artists [43] Due to its location bordering districts such as the Historic Core and the Arts District, Skid Row often hosts events that cross neighborhood borders [44] In 2019, a performance group called the Los Angeles Poverty Department began providing artistic resources to Skid Row, primarily in the form of theater classes and performances [45] Los Angeles Times journalist Margaret Gray claimed that audience members \"somehow felt like part of a family\" when the performers were on stage and noted \"while many charitable organizations focus on warehousing and policing homeless populations, LAPD attempts to remind them of their unique humanity, to empower them to take collective responsibility for their neighborhood and one another's health and safety\" [46] Since 2009 the organization has also sponsored the Festival for All Skid Row Artists [47]\n\n\nCrime\nWithin the LAPD Central Area, which includes Skid Row and other areas in Downtown Los Angeles, crimes in Skid Row constituted 58.96% [50]\n\n\nGovernment and infrastructure\nThe Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) serves the neighborhood with Station No 3 in the Business District, one in the West and Station No 9 in Skid Row Station No 9 operates one engine, one truck, two ALS rescue ambulances, and one BLS rescue ambulance As of October 2023, it is the busiest firehouse in Los Angeles [53] Fire engines and ambulances serving the neighborhood have historically had \"Skid Row\" emblazoned on their sides [54] On June 1, 2006, the Los Angeles Times reported that fire officials planned to change the legend on the vehicles to read \"Central City East\" Many residents supported the change, but it was opposed by firefighters and some residents who take pride in the sense that they live in a tough area [54]\n\n\nTransportation\nThe community is served primarily by 8 Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus lines: [59]\n\n\nLocal

for over a century. The area is bounded by 5th Street to the north, 7th Street to the south, Main Street to the west, and the LA River to the east. The neighborhood has a long and complex history, marked by periods of growth, decline, and transformation.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe term \"skid row\" or \"skid road\" originated in the late 19th century, when loggers would transport their logs to a nearby river by sliding them down roads made from greased skids. Loggers who had accompanied the load to the bottom of the road would wait there for transportation back up the hill to the logging camp. By extension, the term began to be used for places where people with no money and nothing to do gathered, becoming the generic term in English-speaking North America for a depressed street in a city.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nAs of 2019, the Central City East's racial demographics consisted of 39.7% Black/African American, 22.3% White, 16.3% Asian, 15.1% Hispanic or Latino, 2.5% American Indian/Alaska Native, 0.6% Native Hawaiian / Other Pacific Islander, 3.1% 2+ races, and 0.5% other races.\n\n**History**\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, a number of residential hotels opened in the area as it became home to a transient population of seasonal laborers. By the 1930s, Skid Row was home to as many as 10,000 homeless people. It supported saloons, residential hotels, and social services, which drew people from the populations they served to congregate in the area.\n\n**1880s through 1960s**\n\nThe 1880s to 1960s saw a period of growth and expansion in Skid Row, with the construction of new residential hotels, saloons, and social services. The area became a hub for homeless individuals, who would come to the area seeking employment, shelter, and services.\n\n**1970s Containment Zone**\n\nIn 1976, the city of Los Angeles established Skid Row as an unofficial \"containment zone,\" where shelters and services for homeless people would be tolerated. This move was part of a larger effort to address the issue of homelessness in the city, but it ultimately did little to improve the lives of those living in the area.\n\n**1987 Crackdowns**\n\nIn February 1987, LAPD Chief Daryl Gates announced plans for another crackdown on the homeless on Skid Row. Police and firefighters conducted a number of sweeps through the area, but the plan was ultimately abandoned due to opposition from advocates for the homeless.\n\n**2000s Patient Dumping**\n\nIn September 2005, hospitals and law enforcement agencies were discovered to be \"dumping\" homeless people on Skid Row. Then-Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa ordered an investigation, and William Bratton, LAPD chief at the time, claimed that the department was not targeting homeless people specifically, but only people who violated city ordinances.\n\n**2000 to 2009**\n\nIn 2002, newly appointed LAPD Chief William Bratton announced a plan to clean up Skid Row by aggressively enforcing an old anti-camping ordinance. A man named Robert Lee Purrie was cited twice and arrested for violating the ordinance in December 2002 and January 2003. His possessions, consisting of his tent, blankets, clothes, cooking utensils, a hygiene kit, and other personal effects, were thrown into the street by the police.\n\n**2006 Safer Cities Initiative**\n\nThe Safer Cities Initiative (SCI) was a 68-week policy implemented in 2006 by the Los Angeles Police Department dealing with homeless encampments in Skid Row. The policy assigned approximately 50 police officers to the Skid Row area to enforce stricter policing of offenses in accordance with the broken windows theory of policing. Through policing these offenses (including non-violent offenses such as jaywalking or littering), the LAPD sought to establish a heightened appearance of public order as a punitive deterrent for criminals.\n\n**2010s**\n\nIn 2012, the Skid Row Running Club was founded by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Craig Mitchell, as an effort to improve the livelihood of those in the area. A documentary titled \"Skid Row Marathon\" was made about the group, which includes homeless people, police officers, and convicted felons.\n\n**2020s COVID-19 Pandemic**\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring individuals to take down their tents for sidewalk cleanings was suspended, with the intent of not displacing people during the cleanings, which might spread COVID-19.\n\n**Culture**\n\nSkid Row is home to many artists. Due to its location bordering districts such as the Historic Core and the Arts District, Skid Row often hosts events that cross neighborhood borders. In 2019, a performance group called the Los Angeles Poverty Department began providing artistic resources to Skid Row, primarily in the form of theater classes and performances.\n\n**Crime**\n\nWithin the LAPD Central Area, which includes Skid Row and other areas in Downtown Los Angeles, crimes in Skid Row constituted 58.96% of the total crime rate in the area.\n\n**Government and Infrastructure**\n\nThe Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) serves the neighborhood with Station No 3 in the Business District, one in the West, and Station No 9 in Skid Row. Station No 9 operates one engine, one truck, two ALS rescue ambulances, and one BLS rescue ambulance. As of October 2023, it is the busiest firehouse in Los Angeles.\n\n**Transportation**\n\nThe community is served primarily by 8 Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus lines.\n\n**Local Landmarks**\n\nSome notable landmarks in the area include the Central City East Business Improvement District, the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, and the Skid Row Historical Society.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nSkid Row has been depicted in various forms of media, including films, literature, and music. The area has been portrayed as a place of poverty, crime, and social inequality, but also as a hub for artistic expression and community activism.\n\n**Notable Residents**\n\nSome notable residents of Skid Row include artists, activists, and community leaders who have made significant contributions to the neighborhood and the city at large.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in

only people who violated city ordinances [25] The Los Angeles City Attorney investigated more than 50 of about 150 reported cases of dumping [26] By early 2007, the city attorney had filed charges against only one hospital, Kaiser Permanente Because there were no laws specifically covering the hospital's actions, it was charged, in an untested strategy, with false imprisonment In response to the lack of legal recourse available to fight patient dumping, California state senator Gil Cedillo sponsored legislation against it in February 2007 [27]\n\n\n2000 to 2009\nIn 2002, newly appointed

Angeles Times journalist Margaret Gray claimed that audience members \"somehow felt like part of a family\" when the performers were on stage and noted \"while many charitable organizations focus on warehousing and policing homeless populations, LAPD attempts to remind them of their unique humanity, to empower them to take collective responsibility for their neighborhood and one another's health

He served as the head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles from 2016 to 2021 and is currently the head coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\n**Playing Career**\n\nPederson was born in Bellingham, Washington, in 1968. He was raised in nearby Ferndale, Washington, and attended Ferndale High School, where he was an All-State selection in football, basketball, and baseball. His quarterback coach at Ferndale was Ray Ramsay.\n\nAfter high school, Pederson graduated from Northeast Louisiana University, where he was the quarterback from 1987 through 1990. He still holds multiple passing records at the school.\n\n**Professional**\n\nPederson originally signed as a rookie free agent by the Miami Dolphins on May 1, 1991. He was waived on August 17, 1991, before the start of the regular season. After spending the 1991 season as a free agent, the New York/New Jersey Knights of the World League of American Football (WLAF) drafted him in the fifth round for the first pool of draft-eligible players on February 4, 1992. He was the backup quarterback to Reggie Slack with the Knights from March to May 1992.\n\n**Miami Dolphins**\n\nPederson originally signed as a rookie free agent by the Miami Dolphins on May 1, 1991. He was waived on August 17, 1991, before the start of the regular season. After spending the 1991 season as a free agent, the New York/New Jersey Knights of the World League of American Football (WLAF) drafted him in the fifth round for the first pool of draft-eligible players on February 4, 1992. He was the backup quarterback to Reggie Slack with the Knights from March to May 1992.\n\n**Green Bay Packers**\n\nPederson worked out for the Green Bay Packers following week 10 in 1995, due to a season-ending injury suffered by backup Ty Detmer and a minor injury sustained by starter Brett Favre. Third-string quarterback T J Rubley was forced to play in week 10 and threw a game-ending interception after calling an audible, going against head coach Mike Holmgren's playcall. The Packers signed Bob Gagliano to serve as the third-string quarterback for weeks 11 and 12. Pederson replaced Gagliano as the third-string quarterback when he signed with the Packers on November 22, 1995. The Packers claimed Jim McMahon off waivers from the Browns to serve as Favre's backup ahead of Pederson and Rubley on November 29, 1995. Rubley was waived on December 13, leaving McMahon and Pederson as Favre's backups. Favre did not miss any games, so Pederson did not see any game action for the Packers in 1995. Pederson served as the third quarterback behind Favre and McMahon in 1996, playing in one game but recording no statistics. He received a Super Bowl ring following the Packers' win over the Patriots in Super Bowl XXXI. He re-signed with the Packers with a two-year contract on February 20, 1997. Pederson was again the third quarterback throughout 1997, backing up Favre and Steve Bono. Pederson beat out Rick Mirer for the backup job to Favre, as well as the primary placekick holder job, in 1998. In a week 5 loss to the Minnesota Vikings, Pederson replaced Favre in the last five minutes of a blowout game, and threw two touchdowns in his place. However, Pederson suffered a broken jaw that knocked him out for the team's next four games.\n\n**Philadelphia Eagles**\n\nPederson signed a three-year, $4.5 million contract with the Philadelphia Eagles on February 18, 1999, to become the team's starting quarterback under new head coach Andy Reid, who was Pederson's quarterbacks coach in Green Bay from 1997 to 1998. The Eagles drafted Donovan McNabb with the second overall pick in the 1999 NFL draft in April 1999, and Reid said Pederson would remain the starter until McNabb was ready to play. In his nine starts for the Eagles, Pederson had a 2–7 record, a 51.6% completion rate, 1,168 passing yards, six touchdowns, and nine interceptions. In his first career start, a week 1 game against the Arizona Cardinals, Pederson threw two touchdowns in the first quarter to help give the Eagles a 21–0 lead. The Cardinals came back, however, and won the game on a field goal as time expired, 25–24. Pederson went 12-for-25 for 91 yards and two touchdowns in the game. McNabb replaced Pederson, who suffered a bruised throwing shoulder, after one half in a week 2 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, in which Pederson went 12-of-19 for 100 yards and an interception. Pederson started a week 3 shutout loss (26–0) to the Buffalo Bills, going 14-of-26 for 137 yards and two lost fumbles, before being replaced by McNabb again in the fourth quarter. In a week 4 loss to the New York Giants, Pederson went 6-for-15 for 75 yards and two interceptions before being replaced by McNabb after halftime. Pederson's first NFL win came in week 5 in a game against the Dallas Cowboys. He played the entire game, going 11-of-29 for 145 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. Pederson played the entirety of the next three games, posting a 1–2 record while throwing three touchdowns and three interceptions. In his final start as an Eagle, Pederson was benched at halftime of a week 9 game against the Carolina Panthers after going 3-of-9 for 28 yards and being down 23–0. He did not see game action at quarterback again until a week 14 game against the Cowboys in which McNabb suffered an injury in the fourth quarter. Pederson went 8-for-12 for 108 yards and a touchdown in the loss, and Koy Detmer received the start ahead of him in week 15 with McNabb still injured. After spending the next season's training camp with the team, the Eagles released Pederson on August 28, 2000.\n\n**Cleveland Browns**\n\nPederson considered retirement after being released by the Eagles, but instead signed a two-year contract with the Cleveland Browns on September 2, 2000. The Browns' backup, Ty Detmer, suffered a season-ending injury, and the Browns needed a backup quarterback to starter Tim Couch. This was the second time in Pederson's career that he was signed to replace an injured Ty Detmer. Pederson started as the third quarterback behind Couch and Spergon Wynn, until Couch suffered a season-ending injury in week 7. Pederson started the next six games, posting a 1–5 record. In a week 13 game against the Baltimore Ravens, he was knocked out of the game with bruised ribs and replaced with Wynn. Wynn started the next week against the Jacksonville Jaguars, but he suffered a season-ending injury and Pederson replaced him. Pederson returned for the final two games of the season, losing both, including a 35–24 loss to his former team, the Eagles, and a 24–0 shutout loss to the Tennessee Titans. Pederson was released after the season on February 22, 2001.\n\n**Green Bay Packers (second stint)**\n\nThe Packers re-signed Pederson to a one-year contract on March 13, 2001, to replace backup Matt Hasselbeck, who was traded to the Seattle Seahawks. Pederson was the primary backup to Favre for the entire 2001 season, and was the primary placekick holder in every game. He was re-signed to a one-year, $650,000 contract with the Packers on April 2, 2002. Pederson again was the backup quarterback and primary holder in all 16 games in 2002. In a week 7 game against the Washington Redskins, Favre suffered a sprained knee and Pederson took most of the snaps in the second half, going 9-for-15 for 78 yards to help win the game 30–9. Pederson also played in games against the Miami Dolphins, Detroit Lions, and New York Jets. He re-signed with the Packers to a one-year, $750,000 contract on April 29, 2003. For the third consecutive season, Pederson backed up Favre in all 16 games and held placekicks. He completed both of his passes during the regular season for a total of 16 yards. The Packers re-signed Pederson to a one-year contract on April 28, 2004. Tim Couch was signed to compete for the backup quarterback job, but lost out to Pederson and was released on September 5, 2004. In a week 3 game against the Indianapolis Colts, Pederson replaced Favre in a blowout loss and went 4-of-6 for 34 yards and an interception. The next week, a week 4 game against the New York Giants, Favre sustained a concussion in the third quarter, and Pederson replaced him at quarterback. Pederson went 7-of-17 for 86 yards and an interception in the loss before he suffered a hit to his side in the third quarter that resulted in a cracked bone in his back, a torn muscle in his side, and a broken rib. He stayed in the game up until the last snap, when he was replaced by third-string quarterback Craig Nall. Pederson was placed on injured reserve on October 7, ending his season. He retired in March 2005 to become a head coach at Calvary Baptist Academy.\n\n**Coaching Career**\n\nPederson was hired as head coach of Calvary Baptist Academy, a private Christian high school in Shreveport, Louisiana, in March 2005. Calvary was going into its second year as a program when Pederson signed on.\n\nOn January 29, 2009, Pederson was hired as the offensive quality control coach for the Philadelphia Eagles, reuniting him with his former head coach, Andy Reid. He was promoted to quarterbacks coach on February 8, 2011, replacing James Urban, who was promoted to assistant offensive coordinator.\n\nOn January 11, 2013, Pederson followed Andy Reid to the Kansas City Chiefs to serve as offensive coordinator. Following a 1–5 start in 2015, Andy Reid gave Pederson play calling duties, and the Chiefs proceeded to win their last 10 games, making Pederson a head coaching candidate for 2016.\n\nOn January 18, 2016, Pederson was hired as head coach of the Eagles, replacing Chip Kelly. Despite having Sam Bradford on the roster as the starting quarterback, the Eagles drafted Carson Wentz with the second overall pick in 2016. Right before the 2016 season began, Bradford was traded to the Minnesota Vikings, and Wentz was named the starting quarterback as a rookie. Pederson and Wentz won their first three NFL games together, but finished the season 7–9, missing the playoffs.\n\nIn 2017, Pederson's second season was much more successful as he led the Eagles to a 13–3 record, winning them the NFC East division championship and allotting them home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. Wentz, who was having a career year and was considered a front runner for league MVP, tore his ACL in Week 14, leaving backup Nick Foles with the starting job for the remainder of the year. Despite becoming major playoff underdogs due to the loss of Wentz, Foles filled in admirably as the starter, allowing Philadelphia to make it to Super Bowl LII, their first Super Bowl appearance since the 2004 season. Eventual Super Bowl MVP Foles led the team in a 41–33 win over the New England Patriots, giving them their first Lombardi Trophy in franchise history and their first league championship since 1960.\n\nOn May 3, 2018, it was reported that the Philadelphia Eagles picked up Pederson's fifth-year option, allowing him to coach the team through 2020. Later that summer, it was reported that Pederson signed a contract extension through the 2022 NFL season.\n\nThe following season, the Eagles had multiple injuries for the second straight year. After starting 5–7 in the first 12 games, the Eagles managed to win their last 4 games and finished with a 9–7 record for the second consecutive year and their second NFC East division title in three years. They subsequently lost to the Seattle Seahawks 17–9 in the Wild Card Round.\n\nOn August 2, 2020, Pederson tested positive for COVID-19 during training camp. He planned to communicate with the team virtually during his quarantine and relinquished day-to-day head coaching duties to assistant head coach Duce Staley in the interim. Pederson returned to the team on August 12.\n\nIn the 2020 season, the Eagles had their third straight year of injuries, mainly on the offensive line. The Eagles reached a record 14 different offensive line combinations during the season. Pederson faced controversy during the Eagles' final game against the Washington Football Team when he pulled quarterback Jalen Hurts out for backup Nate Sudfeld in the third quarter while facing a three-point deficit. Philadelphia subsequently lost 20–14 to finish with a division-worst 4–11–1 record. Although Pederson said the decision was to give Sudfeld the opportunity to play, he was accused of deliberately losing the game to increase the Eagles' draft position.\n\nWhile it was initially reported on January 2 that Pederson would return to the Eagles for the next season, on January 11, 2021, it was reported that Pederson and the Eagles organization were parting ways. Pederson finished his tenure in Philadelphia with a 42–37–1 (.531) regular season record, 4–2 (.667) playoff record, and a 46–39–1 (.541) career record.\n\nOn January 11, 2021, it was reported that Pederson would become the head coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars. Before Jacksonville's December 4 appearance on Monday Night Football, their record was 8–3. The Jaguars eventually had a late-season collapse and lost four straight games. Following a loss to the Tennessee Titans in Week 18, the Jaguars fell to a final schedule of 9–8 and missed the playoffs and the chance to win the AFC South where they finished second behind the Texans.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nPederson was born in Bellingham, Washington. A devout Christian, Pederson and his wife Jeannie have three sons, including Josh, also a professional football player. During his time with the Eagles, Pederson lived in Moorestown, New Jersey.\n\nHead Coaching Record\n\nThree of Pederson's coaching assistants have become head coaches in the NFL, NCAA, or

their first Super Bowl appearance since the 2004 season [74] Eventual Super Bowl MVP Foles led the team in a 41–33 win over the New England Patriots, giving them their first Lombardi Trophy in

backup Nate Sudfeld in the third quarter while facing a three-point deficit Philadelphia subsequently lost 20–14 to finish with a division-worst 4–11–1 record Although Pederson said the decision was to give Sudfeld the opportunity to play, he was accused of deliberately losing the game to increase the Eagles' draft position [88] [89] [90]\n\n\nJacksonville Jaguars\nWhile it was initially reported on January 2 that Pederson would return to the Eagles for the next season, on January 11, 2021, it was reported that Pederson and the Eagles organization were parting ways Pederson finished his tenure

{"title": "Edmund_I", "content": "\nBackground\nIn the ninth century the four Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Wessex, Mercia, Northumbria and East Anglia came under increasing attack from Vikings, culminating in invasion by the Great Heathen Army in 865 By 878, the Vikings had overrun East Anglia, Northumbria, and Mercia, and nearly conquered Wessex, but in that year the West Saxons fought back under Alfred the Great and achieved a decisive victory at the Battle of Edington [4] In the 880s and 890s, the Anglo-Saxons ruled Wessex and western Mercia, but the rest of England was under Viking kings Alfred constructed a network of fortresses, and these helped him to frustrate renewed Viking attacks in the 890s with the assistance of his son-in-law, Æthelred, Lord of the Mercians, and his elder son Edward, who became king when Alfred died in 899 [5] In 909, Edward sent a force of West Saxons and Mercians to attack the Northumbrian Danes, and the following year the Danes retaliated with a raid on Mercia While they were marching back to Northumbria, they were caught by an Anglo-Saxon army and decisively defeated at the Battle of Tettenhall, ending the threat from the Northumbrian Vikings for a generation In the 910s, Edward and Æthelflæd, his sister and Æthelred's widow, extended Alfred's network of fortresses and conquered Viking-ruled eastern Mercia and East Anglia When Edward died in 924, he controlled all England south of the Humber [6]\n\n\nFamily and early life\nEdmund's father, Edward the Elder, had three wives, eight or nine daughters, several of whom married Continental royalty, and five sons Æthelstan was the only known son of Edward's first wife, Ecgwynn His second wife, Ælfflæd, had two sons: Ælfweard, who may have been acknowledged in Wessex as king when his father died in 924 but who died less than a month later, and Edwin, who drowned in 933 In about 919, Edward married Eadgifu, the daughter of Sigehelm, ealdorman of Kent [10] Edmund, who was born in 920 or 921, [b] was Eadgifu's elder son Her younger son Eadred succeeded him as king Edmund had one or two full sisters Eadburh was a nun at Winchester who was later venerated as a saint The twelfth-century historian William of Malmesbury gives Edmund a second full sister who married Louis, prince of Aquitaine; she was called Eadgifu, the same name as her mother William's account is accepted by the historians Ann Williams and Sean Miller, but Æthelstan's biographer Sarah Foot argues that she did not exist, and that William confused her with Ælfgifu, a daughter of Ælfflæd [12]\n\n\nReign\nBrunanburh saved England from destruction as a united kingdom, and it helped to ensure that Edmund would succeed smoothly to the throne, but it did not preserve him from challenges to his rule once he became king [20] The chronology of the Viking challenge is disputed, [d] but according to the most widely accepted version, Æthelstan's death encouraged the York Vikings to accept the kingship of Anlaf Guthfrithson, the King of Dublin who had led the Viking forces defeated at Brunanburh According to ASC D: [e] \"Here the Northumbrians belied their pledges and chose Anlaf from Ireland as their king.\" [27] Anlaf was in York by the end of 939 and the following year he invaded north-east Mercia, aiming to recover the southern territories of the York kingdom which had been conquered by Edward and Æthelflæd He marched on Northampton, where he was repulsed, and then stormed the ancient Mercian royal centre of Tamworth, with considerable loss of life on both sides On his way back north he was caught at Leicester by an army under Edmund, but battle was averted by the mediation of Archbishop Wulfstan of York, on behalf of the Vikings, and probably the Archbishop of Canterbury acting for the English [f] They arranged a treaty at Leicester which surrendered the Five Boroughs of Lincoln, Leicester, Nottingham, Stamford and Derby, to Guthfrithson This was the first serious setback for the English since Edward the Elder began to roll back Viking conquests in the early tenth century, and it was described by the historian Frank Stenton as \"an ignominious surrender\" [29] Guthfrithson had coins struck at York with the lower Viking weight than the English standard [30]\n\n\nThe loss and recovery of the north\nBrunanburh saved England from destruction as

Viking weight than the English standard [30]\n\n\nRelations with other British kingdoms\nEdmund inherited overlordship over the kings of Wales from Æthelstan, but Idwal Foel, king of Gwynedd in north Wales, apparently took advantage of Edmund's early weakness to withhold fealty and may have supported Anlaf Guthfrithson, as according to the Annales Cambriæ, he was killed by the English in 942 Between 942 and 950 his kingdom was conquered by Hywel Dda, the king of Deheubarth in south Wales, who is described by the historian of Wales Thomas Charles-Edwards as \"the firmest ally of the English \"emperors of Britain\" among all the kings of his day\" Attestations of Welsh kings to English charters appear to have been rare compared with those in Æthelstan's reign, but in the historian David Dumville's view there is no reason to doubt that Edmund retained his overlordship over the Welsh kings [40] [h] In a charter of 944 disposing of land in Devon, Edmund is styled \"King of the English and ruler of this British province\", suggesting that the former British kingdom of Dumnonia was still not regarded as fully integrated into England, [42] although the historian Simon Keynes \"suspects some 'local' interference\" in the wording of Edmund's title [43]\n\n\nRelations with Continental Europe\nEdmund inherited strong Continental contacts from Æthelstan's cosmopolitan court, and these were enhanced by their sisters' marriages to foreign kings and princes Edmund carried on his brother's Continental policies and maintained his alliances, especially with his nephew King Louis IV of West Francia and Otto I, King of East Francia and future Holy Roman Emperor Louis was both nephew and brother-in-law of Otto, while Otto and Edmund were brothers-in-law [31] There were almost certainly extensive diplomatic contacts between Edmund and Continental rulers which have not been recorded, but it is known that Otto sent delegations to Edmund's court [48] [i] In the early 940s, some Norman lords sought the help of the Danish prince Harald against Louis, and in 945 Harald captured Louis and handed him to Hugh the Great, Duke of the Franks, who kept him prisoner Edmund and Otto both protested and demanded his immediate release, but this only took place in exchange for the surrender of the town of Laon to Hugh [50]\n\n\nAdministration\nEdmund inherited his brother's interests and leading advisers, such as Æthelstan Half-King, ealdorman of East Anglia, Ælfheah the Bald, bishop of Winchester, and Oda, bishop of Ramsbury, who was appointed as Archbishop of Canterbury by Edmund in 941 [31] Æthelstan Half-King first witnessed a charter as an ealdorman in 932, and within three years of Edmund's accession he had been joined by two of his brothers as ealdormen; their territories covered more than half of England and his wife fostered the future King Edgar The historian Cyril Hart compares the brothers' power during Edmund's reign to that of the Godwins a century later [52] Edmund's mother, Eadgifu, who had been in eclipse during her step-son's reign, was also very influential [53]\n\n\nCharters\nThe period from around 925 to 975 was the golden age of Anglo-Saxon royal charters, when they were at their peak as instruments of royal government, and the scribes who drew up most of Edmund's charters constituted a royal secretariat which he inherited from his brother From 928 until 935, charters were produced by the very learned scribe designated by scholars as Æthelstan A in a highly elaborate style Keynes comments: \"It is only by dwelling on the glories and complexities of the diplomas drafted and written by Æthelstan A that one can appreciate the elegant simplicity of the diplomas that followed.\" [59] A scribe known as Edmund C wrote an inscription in a gospel book (BL Cotton Tiberius A ii folio 15v) during Æthelstan's reign and wrote charters for Edmund and Eadred between 944 and 949 [60]\n\n\nCoinage\nThe only coin in common use in the tenth century was the penny [63] [m] The main coin designs in Edmund's reign were H (Horizontal) types, with a cross or other decoration on the obverse surrounded by a circular inscription including the king's name, and the moneyer's name horizontally on the reverse There were also substantial numbers of BC (Bust Crowned) types in East Anglia and the Danish shires; these had a portrait of the king, often crudely drawn, on the obverse [65] For a period in Æthelstan's reign many coins showed the mint town, but this had become rare by the time of Edmund's accession, except in Norwich, where it continued during the 940s for BC types [66]\n\n\nLegislation\nThree law codes of Edmund survive, carrying on Æthelstan's tradition of legal reform [31] They are called I Edmund, II Edmund and III Edmund [n] The order in which they were issued is clear, but not the dates of issue I Edmund is concerned with ecclesiastical matters, while the other codes deal with public order [70]\n\n\nReligion\nThe major religious movement of the tenth century, the English Benedictine Reform, reached its peak under Edgar, [91] but Edmund's reign was important in the early stages, which were led by Oda and Ælfheah, both of whom were monks Oda had strong connections with Continental centres of reform, especially Fleury Abbey He had been a leading counsellor of Æthelstan and had helped to negotiate the return of Louis to France as king of the Franks in 936 [92] Dunstan was to be a key figure in the reform and Archbishop of Canterbury, and according to his first biographer he was a leading figure at Edmund's court until his enemies persuaded Edmund to expel him, only for the king to have a change of heart after a narrow escape from death and give him a royal estate at Glastonbury, including its abbey Williams rejects the story because there is no evidence that he was influential in this period; his brother attested charters, but he did not [31] Edmund may have given Dunstan the abbey to keep him at a distance because he was too much of a disruptive influence at court [93] He was joined by Æthelwold, another future reform leader, and they spent much of the next decade studying Benedictine texts at Glastonbury, which became the first centre for disseminating monastic reform [9]\n\n\nLearning\nLatin learning revived in Æthelstan's reign, influenced by Continental models and by the hermeneutic style of the leading seventh century scholar and Bishop of Sherborne, Aldhelm The revival continued in Edmund's reign, and Welsh book production became increasingly influential Welsh manuscripts were studied and copied, and they influenced the early use of Carolingian minuscule script in England, although Continental sources are also important Edmund's reign also saw the development of a new style of the native square minuscule script, which was used in mid-century royal diplomas Oda's school at Canterbury was praised by post-Conquest chroniclers, especially for the presence there of Frithegod, a brilliant Continental scholar and the most skilful poet in mid-tenth century England [103] The \"Vatican\" recension of the Historia Brittonum was produced in England in Edmund's reign, probably in 944 [104]\n\n\nMarriages and children\nEdmund probably married his first wife Ælfgifu around the time of his accession to the throne, as their second son was born in 943 Their sons Eadwig and Edgar both became kings of England [31] Ælfgifu's father is not known, but her mother is identified by a charter of Edgar which confirms a grant by his grandmother Wynflæd of land to Shaftesbury Abbey [105] Ælfgifu was also a benefactor of Shaftesbury Abbey; when she died in 944 she was buried there and venerated as a saint [106] [t] Edmund had no known children by his second wife, Æthelflæd, who died after 991 Her father Ælfgar became ealdorman of Essex in 946 Edmund presented him with a sword lavishly decorated with gold and silver, which Ælfgar later presented to King Eadred Æthelflæd's second husband was Æthelstan Rota, a south-east Mercian ealdorman, and her will survives [108]\n\n\nDeath and succession\nOn 26 May 946, Edmund was killed in a brawl at Pucklechurch in Gloucestershire [31] According to the post-Conquest chronicler, John of Worcester:\n\n\nAssessment\nHistorians' views of Edmund's character and record differ widely The historian Barbara Yorke comments that when substantial powers were delegated there was a danger that subjects would become over-powerful: the kings following Æthelstan came to the throne young and had short reigns, and the families of Æthelstan 'Half-King' and Ælfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia, [u] developed unassailable positions [114] In the view of Cyril Hart: \"For the whole of his brief reign, the young king Edmund remained strongly under the influence of his mother Eadgifu and the \"Half King\", who between them must have decided much of the national policy.\" [115] In contrast, Williams describes Edmund as \"an energetic and forceful ruler\" [31] and Stenton commented that \"he proved himself to be both warlike and politically effective\", [116] while in Dumville's view, but for his early death \"he might yet have been remembered as one of the more remarkable of Anglo-Saxon kings\" [117]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther

He was the son of King Edward the Elder and Eadgifu of Kent. Edmund's reign was marked by several significant events, including the Viking invasion of England and the expansion of the English kingdom. He is considered one of the most important Anglo-Saxon kings of the 10th century.\n\n**Background**\n\nIn the ninth century, the four Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Wessex, Mercia, Northumbria, and East Anglia came under increasing attack from Vikings. The Great Heathen Army invaded England in 865 and overran East Anglia, Northumbria, and Mercia. By 878, the Vikings had nearly conquered Wessex, but King Alfred the Great fought back and achieved a decisive victory at the Battle of Edington. In the 880s and 890s, the Anglo-Saxons ruled Wessex and western Mercia, while the rest of England was under Viking control. King Alfred constructed a network of fortresses to resist the Viking attacks.\n\n**Family and Early Life**\n\nEdmund's father, Edward the Elder, had three wives and five sons. Edmund was the eldest son of Edward's second marriage to Eadgifu. He had several sisters, including Eadburh, who became a nun at Winchester and was later venerated as a saint. Edmund's mother, Eadgifu, was a powerful influence on his early life and was instrumental in his accession to the throne.\n\n**Reign**\n\nEdmund succeeded his brother, Æthelstan, as king in 939. He faced several challenges, including the Viking invasion of England. The Vikings, led by Anlaf Guthfrithson, invaded north-east Mercia and were repulsed by the English army at Northampton. Anlaf then stormed the ancient Mercian royal centre of Tamworth, with considerable loss of life on both sides. Edmund's army caught up with the Vikings at Leicester, but a treaty was arranged to surrender the Five Boroughs to Guthfrithson.\n\n**Loss and Recovery of the North**\n\nThe Viking invasion of England had a significant impact on the north of England. The Vikings, led by Anlaf Guthfrithson, had already conquered the Five Boroughs and were expanding their territory. Edmund's army was able to resist the Viking invasion, but the Vikings were able to recover some of their lost territory. The treaty arranged at Leicester marked a significant setback for the English.\n\n**Relations with Other British Kingdoms**\n\nEdmund inherited overlordship over the kings of Wales from his brother, Æthelstan. He was able to maintain his overlordship over the Welsh kings, although there were some challenges. Idwal Foel, king of Gwynedd, withheld fealty and may have supported the Vikings. Edmund was able to conquer Idwal's kingdom and establish his authority over the Welsh.\n\n**Relations with Continental Europe**\n\nEdmund maintained his brother's Continental contacts and alliances. He carried on his brother's Continental policies and maintained his alliances, especially with his nephew, King Louis IV of West Francia, and Otto I, King of East Francia and future Holy Roman Emperor. Edmund's reign saw extensive diplomatic contacts between England and Continental Europe.\n\n**Administration**\n\nEdmund inherited his brother's interests and leading advisers. He was able to maintain his brother's network of administrators and ealdormen. Edmund's mother, Eadgifu, was a powerful influence on his administration and was instrumental in his decision-making.\n\n**Charters**\n\nThe period from around 925 to 975 was the golden age of Anglo-Saxon royal charters. Edmund's reign saw the production of several important charters, including those produced by the scribe known as Æthelstan A. Edmund's charters were highly elaborate and marked a significant development in the use of charters as instruments of royal government.\n\n**Coinage**\n\nThe only coin in common use in the 10th century was the penny. Edmund's reign saw the production of several types of coins, including H types and BC types. The coins were produced in several mints, including Norwich and York.\n\n**Legislation**\n\nEdmund issued three law codes, which were concerned with ecclesiastical matters and public order. The law codes were an important development in the use of law to govern Anglo-Saxon society.\n\n**Religion**\n\nEdmund's reign saw the English Benedictine Reform reach its peak. The reform movement was led by Oda, Ælfheah, and Dunstan, who were all influential figures in Edmund's court. Edmund was able to maintain his brother's support for the reform movement and was instrumental in the development of the English Benedictine Reform.\n\n**Learning**\n\nEdmund's reign saw a revival of Latin learning, which was influenced by Continental models.

Between 942 and 950 his kingdom was conquered by Hywel Dda, the king of Deheubarth in south Wales, who is described by the historian of Wales Thomas Charles-Edwards as \"the firmest ally of the English \"emperors of Britain\" among all the kings of his day\" Attestations of Welsh kings to English charters appear to have been rare compared with those in Æthelstan's reign, but in the historian David Dumville's view there is no reason to doubt that Edmund retained his overlordship over the Welsh kings [40] [h] In a charter of 944 disposing of land in Devon, Edmund is styled \"King of the English and ruler of this British province\", suggesting that the former British kingdom of Dumnonia was still not regarded as fully integrated into England, [42] although the historian Simon Keynes \"suspects some 'local' interference\" in the wording of Edmund's title [43]\n\n\nRelations with Continental Europe\nEdmund inherited strong Continental contacts from Æthelstan's cosmopolitan court, and these were enhanced by their sisters' marriages to foreign kings and princes Edmund carried on his brother's Continental policies and maintained his alliances, especially with his nephew King Louis IV of West Francia and Otto I, King of East Francia and future Holy Roman Emperor Louis was both nephew and brother-in-law of Otto, while Otto and Edmund were brothers-in-law [31] There were almost certainly extensive diplomatic contacts between Edmund and Continental rulers which have not been recorded, but it is known that Otto sent delegations to Edmund's court [48] [i] In the early 940s, some Norman lords sought the help of the Danish prince Harald against Louis, and in 945 Harald captured Louis and handed him to Hugh the Great, Duke of the Franks, who kept him prisoner Edmund and Otto both protested and demanded his immediate release, but this only took place in exchange for the surrender of the town of Laon to Hugh [50]\n\n\nAdministration\nEdmund inherited his brother's interests and leading advisers, such as Æthelstan Half-King, ealdorman of East Anglia, Ælfheah the Bald, bishop of Winchester, and Oda, bishop of Ramsbury, who was appointed as Archbishop of Canterbury by Edmund in 941 [31] Æthelstan Half-King first witnessed a charter as an ealdorman in 932, and within three years of Edmund's accession he had been joined by two of his brothers as ealdormen; their territories covered more than half of England and his wife fostered the future King Edgar The historian Cyril Hart compares the brothers' power during Edmund's reign to that of the Godwins a century later [52] Edmund's mother, Eadgifu, who had been in eclipse during her step-son's reign, was also very influential [53]\n\n\nCharters\nThe period from around 925 to 975 was the golden age of Anglo-Saxon royal charters, when they were at their peak as instruments of royal government, and the scribes who drew up most of Edmund's charters constituted a royal secretariat which he inherited from his brother From 928 until 935, charters were produced by the very learned scribe designated by scholars as Æthelstan A in a highly elaborate style Keynes comments: \"It is only by dwelling on the glories and complexities of the diplomas drafted and written by Æthelstan A that one can appreciate the elegant simplicity of the diplomas that followed.\" [59] A scribe known as Edmund C wrote an inscription in a gospel book (BL Cotton Tiberius A ii folio 15v) during Æthelstan's reign and wrote charters for Edmund and Eadred between 944 and 949 [60]\n\n\nCoinage\nThe only coin in common use in the tenth century was the penny [63] [m] The main coin designs in Edmund's reign were H (Horizontal) types, with a cross or other decoration on the obverse surrounded by a circular inscription including the king's name, and the moneyer's name horizontally on the reverse There were also substantial numbers of BC (Bust Crowned) types in East Anglia and the Danish shires; these had a portrait of the king, often crudely drawn, on the obverse [65] For a period in Æthelstan's reign many coins showed the mint town, but this had become rare by the time of Edmund's accession, except in Norwich, where it continued during the 940s for BC types [66]\n\n\nLegislation\nThree law codes of Edmund survive, carrying on Æthelstan's tradition of legal reform [31] They are called I Edmund, II Edmund and III Edmund [n] The order in which they were issued is clear, but not the dates of issue I Edmund is concerned with ecclesiastical matters, while the other codes deal with public order [70]\n\n\nReligion\nThe major religious movement of the tenth century, the English Benedictine Reform, reached its peak under Edgar, [91] but Edmund's reign was important in the early stages, which were led by Oda and Ælfheah, both of whom were monks Oda had strong connections with Continental centres of reform, especially Fleury Abbey He had been a leading counsellor of Æthelstan and had helped to negotiate the return of Louis to France as king of the Franks in 936 [92] Dunstan was to be a key figure in the reform and Archbishop of Canterbury, and according to his first biographer he was a leading figure at Edmund's court until his enemies persuaded Edmund to expel him, only for the king to have a change of heart after a narrow escape from death and give him a royal estate at Glastonbury, including its abbey Williams rejects the story because there is no evidence that he was influential in this period; his brother attested charters, but he did not [31] Edmund may have given Dunstan the abbey to keep him at a distance because he was too much of a disruptive influence at court [93] He was joined by Æthelwold, another future reform leader, and they spent much of the next decade studying Benedictine texts at Glastonbury, which became the first centre for disseminating monastic reform [9]\n\n\nLearning\nLatin learning revived in Æthelstan's reign, influenced by Continental models and by the hermeneutic style of the leading seventh century scholar and Bishop of Sherborne, Aldhelm The revival continued in Edmund's reign, and Welsh book production became increasingly influential Welsh manuscripts were studied and copied, and they influenced the early use of Carolingian minuscule script in England, although Continental sources are also important Edmund's reign also saw the development of a new style of the native square minuscule script, which was used in mid-century royal diplomas Oda's school at Canterbury was praised by post-Conquest chroniclers, especially for the presence there of Frithegod, a brilliant Continental scholar and the most skilful poet in mid-tenth century England [103] The \"Vatican\" recension of the Historia Brittonum was produced in England in Edmund's reign, probably in 944 [104]\n\n\nMarriages and children\nEdmund probably married his first wife Ælfgifu around the time of his accession to the throne, as their second son was born in 943 Their sons Eadwig and Edgar both became kings of England [31] Ælfgifu's father is not known, but her mother is identified by a charter of Edgar which confirms a grant by his grandmother Wynflæd of land to Shaftesbury Abbey [105] Ælfgifu was also a benefactor of Shaftesbury Abbey; when she died in 944 she was buried there and venerated as a saint [106] [t] Edmund had no known children by his second wife, Æthelflæd, who died after 991 Her father Ælfgar became ealdorman of Essex in 946 Edmund presented him with a sword lavishly decorated with gold and silver, which Ælfgar later presented to King Eadred Æthelflæd's second husband was Æthelstan Rota, a south-east Mercian ealdorman, and her will survives [108]\n\n\nDeath and succession\nOn 26 May 946, Edmund was killed in a brawl at Pucklechurch in Gloucestershire [31] According to the post-Conquest chronicler, John of Worcester:\n\n\nAssessment\nHistorians' views of Edmund's character and record differ widely The historian Barbara Yorke comments that when substantial powers were delegated there was a danger that subjects would become over-powerful: the kings following Æthelstan came to the throne young and had short reigns, and the families of Æthelstan 'Half-King' and Ælfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia, [u] developed unassailable positions [114] In the view of Cyril Hart: \"For the whole of his brief reign, the young king Edmund remained strongly under the influence of his mother Eadgifu and the \"Half King\", who between them must have decided much of the national policy.\" [115] In contrast, Williams describes Edmund as \"an energetic and forceful ruler\" [31] and Stenton commented that \"he proved himself to be both warlike and politically effective\", [116] while in Dumville's view, but for his early death \"he might yet have been remembered as one of the more remarkable of Anglo-Saxon kings\" [117]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther

These organs play crucial roles in maintaining the body's overall function and well-being. This article will delve into the various aspects of viscera, including their classification, origin, and evolution, as well as their significance in plant and animal organisms.\n\n# Animals\n\n## Organ Systems in Multicellular Animals\n\nExcept for placozoans, multicellular animals, including humans, have a variety of organ systems that are widely studied in human anatomy. These specific systems are essential for maintaining the body's overall function and well-being. The functions of these organ systems often share significant overlap, making it essential to study them in combination. For instance, the nervous and endocrine systems both operate via a shared organ, the hypothalamus. As a result, the two systems are combined and studied as the neuroendocrine system. The same is true for the musculoskeletal system, which is closely related to the muscular and skeletal systems.\n\n## Classification of Viscera\n\nIn the study of anatomy, viscera refers to the internal organs of the abdominal, thoracic, and pelvic cavities. The abdominal organs can be classified as either solid or hollow organs. Solid organs include the liver, pancreas, spleen, kidneys, and adrenal glands. Hollow organs of the abdomen include the stomach, intestines, gallbladder, bladder, and rectum. In the thoracic cavity, the heart is a hollow, muscular organ. Splanchnology is the study of the viscera.\n\n## Parietal and Visceral Terminology\n\nThe term \"visceral\" is contrasted with the term \"parietal,\" which means \"of or relating to the wall of a body part, organ, or cavity.\" These two terms are often used in describing a membrane or piece of connective tissue, referring to the opposing sides.\n\n# Origin and Evolution\n\n## Organ Level of Organisation in Animals\n\nThe organ level of organisation in animals can be first detected in flatworms and the more derived phyla, i.e., the bilaterians. The less-advanced taxa (i.e., Placozoa, Porifera, Ctenophora, and Cnidaria) do not show consolidation of their tissues into organs.\n\n## Plant Organs\n\nThe study of plant organs is covered in plant morphology. Organs of plants can be divided into vegetative and reproductive. Vegetative plant organs include roots, stems, and leaves. Reproductive organs are variable, and in flowering plants, they are represented by the flower, seed, and fruit. In conifers, the organ that bears the reproductive structures is called a cone. In other divisions (phyla) of plants, the reproductive organs are called strobili, in Lycopodiophyta, or simply gametophores in mosses.\n\n## Organ System Designations in Plants\n\nCommon organ system designations in plants include the differentiation of shoot and root. All parts of the plant above ground (in non-epiphytes), including the functionally distinct leaf and flower organs, may be classified together as the shoot organ system.\n\n# Society and Culture\n\n## Organ Donation and Transplantation\n\nMany societies have a system for organ donation, in which a living or deceased donor's organ is transplanted into a person with a failing organ. The transplantation of larger solid organs often requires immunosuppression to prevent organ rejection or graft-versus-host disease.\n\n## History of Organ Transplants\n\nOrgan transplants began to take place in the 20th century, as scientists gained a better understanding of the anatomy of organs. These procedures were often dangerous and difficult, but as the field progressed, they became more common and successful. Both the source and method of obtaining the organ to transplant are major ethical issues to consider, and because organs as resources for transplant are always more limited than demand for them, various notions of justice, including distributive justice, are developed in the ethical analysis.\n\n## Antiquity of Organ Concept\n\nAristotle used the word \"organ\" frequently in his philosophy, both to describe the organs of plants or animals, because in ancient Greek, the word 'organon' means 'tool', and Aristotle believed that the organs of the body were tools for us by means of which we can do things. For similar reasons, his logical works, taken as a whole, are referred to as the Organon because logic is a tool for philosophical thinking.\n\n## Early Thinkers and Organ Concept\n\nEarlier thinkers, such as those who wrote texts in the Hippocratic corpus, generally did not believe that there were organs of the body but only different parts of the body.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Anatomy\n* Human Body\n*

{"title": "Mufasa", "content": "\nRole\nIn The Lion King (1994), King Mufasa rules over the Pride Lands with his mate, Queen Sarabi [1] Their young son, Simba, is destined to eventually succeed his father as king Mufasa teaches Simba the importance of maintaining the delicate balance of life within the Pride Lands, [2] and cautions the cub to prepare for when he will inevitably replace him [3] However, Mufasa's younger brother, Scar, covets the throne for himself, and plots to eliminate both Mufasa and Simba to seize rulership One fateful day, Scar triggers a wildebeest stampede that traps Simba in a deep gorge, knowing Mufasa would rush into danger to save his son [4] After rescuing Simba, Mufasa is caught in the stampede himself and struggles to climb out of the gorge, where Scar waits above As Mufasa pleads for help from his brother, Scar pierces Mufasa's claws with his own, [5] [6] and pushes him to his death below [4] [7] Scar manipulates Simba into believing he caused Mufasa's demise, [8] forcing him to flee the Pride Lands in guilt and shame [3] [9] Lost and alone, Simba seeks refuge in the jungle, where he is raised by Timon and Pumbaa, a meerkat and warthog [3] Despite his new carefree lifestyle, the guilt of his perceived actions linger [3] Years later, Simba reunites with Rafiki, a wise baboon who explains that Mufasa's spirit lives on within him [3] Mufasa appears to Simba in the clouds as a ghostly apparition to remind him about the importance of facing his responsibilities as his heir, [10] [11] prompting Simba to return to the Pride Lands, where he defeats Scar and ultimately reclaims his rightful place as king [3] In the sequel, The Lion King II: Simba's Pride (1998), Mufasa's role is reduced, mostly appearing to Simba as a God-like entity in the sky, and communicating with Rafiki via the wind [12]\n\n\nDevelopment\nThe Lion King was the first film released during the Disney Renaissance [a] to focus on a father-son relationship, rather than a romantic one [14] Producer Don Hahn described the film as \"essentially a love story between a father and a son .. It’s about that moment in life when you realise that your father is going to pass on to you his wisdom and knowledge\" [3] In early drafts of the film, Mufasa was not related to Scar, [15] [b] but the producers decided that making these characters brothers would provide a more interesting story [15] However, the characters' physical appearances had already been finalized, leaving little family resemblance between the pair [15] According to director Rob Minkoff, they had always imagined that Mufasa accidentally gave Scar his eponymous scar when they were children [17] Although Mufasa and Scar refer to each other as \"brothers\" as members of the same pride, [18] [19] Hahn retrospectively suggested that it would have been unlikely for Mufasa and Scar to share the same parents because lion prides typically have only one adult male, [20] with younger rogue lions often killing a pride's original leader and his offspring to assert dominance [21] [22] [c]\n\n\nCreation\nThe Lion King was the first film released during the Disney Renaissance [a] to focus on a father-son relationship, rather than a romantic one [14] Producer Don Hahn described the film as \"essentially a love story between a father and a son ..

lion prides typically have only one adult male, [20] with younger rogue lions often killing a pride's original leader and his offspring to assert dominance [21] [22] [c]\n\n\nVoice\nActor Sean Connery was Disney's initial choice to voice Mufasa [54] [55] [56] [57] Liam Neeson was also considered [58] [45] Mufasa was voiced by American actor James Earl Jones [59] Disney claims that, once the character was realized, it was difficult to envision anyone other than Jones voicing Mufasa [59] Jones was drawn to the role because he was impressed by drawings he had seen of Mufasa and relished the opportunity to create a character using only his voice, claiming the process reminded him of his early work performing on radio [59] As a prolific thespian, he was also attracted to the film's Shakespearean elements [59] He described voice acting as the \"purest form\" of acting, likening it to performing in ancient Greek theatre \"where the actors would wear masks In our case, the masks are the animators’ drawings and we just simply supply all the behaviors, emotions, and feelings behind that mask” [60]\n\n\nPersonality and design\nJones described Mufasa as an authoritative but ultimately gentle father [61] Jones's staunch demeanor during recording sessions served as inspiration for supervising animator Tony Fucile [52] Fucile said Jones provided both the regal quality and \"fatherly warmth\" the animators needed to create the character, explaining, \"it was up to us to visually come up to that standard that he set with his voice\" [59] Specifically, the animators borrowed Jones's \"dopey smile\" he would wear during recording sessions, and incorporated it into Mufasa's face [66] Fucile found watching Jones's performance in the film Matewan (1987) to be particularly helpful because the actor \"used a lot of facial expressions and eye movements to communicate\", mirroring Mufasa's tendency to be subtle and convey a lot of emotion with little movement [80] The animators borrowed some design elements from Mufasa for adult Simba to make the latter look more heroic [81] Under Fucile, Phillip Young was another animator who worked on Mufasa, which Young referred to as his \"best character assignment\" [82] Prior to The Lion King, Young had mostly animated action scenes, some of which he also did for Mufasa, but he considers the character the first time \"in which I could exercise some acting chops\" [83] He also animated Mufasa's stampede scenes, as well as some of his interactions with Simba [83]\n\n\nReception\nCritics and audiences initially expressed varying opinions about Mufasa's death [4] [86] [87] [88] According to Jessica Wang of Entertainment Weekly, no viewer was left \"emotionally unaffected\" in 1994 [89] Dan Webster of The Spokesman-Review called the moment \"a plot twist unfamiliar to this era of family-values emphasis\" [90] Film critic Hal Hinson predicted that Mufasa's death would be as widely debated as \"the killing of Bambi's mother\" [88] At the time of the film's release, news outlets reported that several parents complained that the scene was not appropriate for a film marketed towards younger viewers, [91] [92] voicing concerns about children experiencing nightmares, worrying about their own parents, and regressing [93] In return, some commentators accused said parents of being overprotective [92] According to Darryl E Owens of Tampa Bay Times, child-development experts warned that the death could be potentially traumatizing and anxiety-inducing if parents fail to prepare their children before viewing, [93] but child therapist Mercedes Ojeda-Castro encouraged parents to use the opportunity to discuss death [94] Several critics cited Mufasa's death as potentially frightening for younger viewers [1] [95] [49] [96] [97] [98] Film critic Janet Maslin questioned the film's G rating, [99] and Stone said the film \"could have done without\" Simba's attempts to awaken his dead father [37] Ranking it among the most traumatic moments from a Disney film, Paolo Ragusa of Consequence said, \"It may be cruel, but with years of reflection, it’s a profoundly important detail in the scope of The Lion King, and though it’s difficult to not feel the pangs of loss after all this time, it’s animated with palpable emotion and cinematic elegance\" [100] Several reviewers, such as Roger Ebert, [101] compared Mufasa's death to that of Bambi's mother, [6] [102] [103] [104] [98] [105] with Hugh Armitage of Digital Spy describing it as \"Bambi's mother's death for a new generation - just much more visceral and violent\" [106] Variety's Jeremy Gerard suggested that parents who remember being traumatized by Bambi should use it to gauge \"who goes to \"The Lion King\" -- and who stays home with the babysitter\" [107] However, Animation World Network's Rick DeMott suggested that the public's reaction was muted compared to the impact of Bambi's mother [108]\n\n\nCultural impact\nIn 2014, Camille Dautrich of the Springfield News-Leader described Mufasa as one \"of the world's most beloved animated characters\" [135] Reporting for Good Morning America, Nicole Pelletiere said his wisdom and legacy endeared him to Disney fans [136] The A.V Club ranked him the 30th \"best Disney animated character of all time\", [137] and GamesRadar+ ranked him 25th [138] Mufasa has been described by several publications as one of the greatest fathers to have appeared on film, [139] [140] [141] [142] [143] with Zach Seemayer of Entertainment Tonight ranking him among \"the 13 greatest fictional fathers in movie history\", [144] and Business Insider calling him one of the 19 \"the best fictional dads of all time\" [145] Jeff Peterson of the Deseret News said the character \"demonstrates the qualities of a good father, which, incidentally, are the same qualities needed for Simba to become a good ruler later on\" [146] In 2022, Indy100 recognized Mufasa as one of the 100 greatest on-screen fathers, [147] and Euronews included him among the \"The 12 best on-screen dads of all time\" [148] Ranking him the best movie dad, Ryan Christian of MovieWeb described Mufasa as \"the standard against which all movie dads are judged\" [149] GamesRadar+ named the character the fifth greatest movie father figure [150] The Daily Beast ranked him the sixth \"coolest movie dad\", [151] and Brian Tallerico of Vulture declared Mufasa Disney's most iconic father [152] America writer John Dougherty described Mufasa as \"graceful and dignified, but also warm and playful—the ideal father\" [153] Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly selected The Lion King as the \"one movie I’m going to watch on Father’s Day\" due to Mufasa's love for Simba [154] Meanwhile, Maddie Garfinkle of People declared him \"one of the greatest kings\" in \"the history of animated cinema\" [155]\n\n\nLegacy and commendations\nIn 2014, Camille

declared him \"one of the greatest kings\" in \"the history of animated cinema\" [155]\n\n\nDeath\nDescribed by Isaac Williams of Comic Book Resources as \"one of the most impactful moments of any Disney film\", [164] Mufasa's murder at the hands of Scar is widely regarded as one of the most memorable on-screen deaths in film history, [165] with Radheyan Simonpillai of The Guardian writing in 2024 that it \"still hurts 30 years later\" [91] The scene comprising Mufasa's death and Simba's gradual realization have been described as inseparable from The Lion King franchise [100] [166] Vanity Fair's Laura Bradley said his death \"became the benchmark against which all future film tragedies would be measured\", comparing its legacy to that of Bambi's mother [28] Although death and violence had already been depicted in children's entertainment, [94] [167] Alex Spencer of The Escapist reported that nothing released before 1994 rivaled Mufasa's impact [167] Prior to Mufasa, deceased parents in Disney films had typically died or been killed off-screen [168] [169] [170] Josh Spiegel of /Film heralded The Lion King as the only Disney film that rivaled Bambi's depiction of coming of age through tragedy [171] Joseph Heindl of Game Rant described it as \"the other defining parental death in the Disney pantheon\", after Bambi's mother, [172] and writers for Legacy.com said both murders \"affected the children of their generations and the generations to follow\" [173] Jonathan Allford of The Guardian theorized that few preceding or subsequent parental deaths in Disney films have been as emotionally devastating as Mufasa's, which he attributed to the character's benevolence and audience connection [174] Pediatrician and writer Perri Klass said Mufasa's death subverted the absent or dead mother trope in Disney films and embraced the \"90's-style celebration of the involved dad\", in contrast to Bambi's \"archetypically distant\" father [49] Collider's Diego Pineda Pacheco ranked it the second most heartbreaking death from a children's film, observing that any conversation regarding death in children's media is guaranteed to mention The Lion King, [175] and Gem Seddon of GamesRadar+ ranked it the 20th saddest movie tearjerker [176] Nadira Goffe of Slate said, as \"one of the first and most visceral main-character deaths we would experience\", Mufasa \"traumatized an entire age group\" [156]\n\n\nIn other media\nTo promote the release of The Lion King in 1994, Mufasa began appearing in a plethora of merchandise licensed by Disney Consumer Products [198] Mufasa's likeness has been used in several Lion King tie-in products and media, including the PC game Disney's Animated Storybook: The Lion King (1994) and console game The Lion King: Simba's Mighty Adventure (2000) [199] [200] [201] From 1995–2018, Mufasa provided the opening narration for the Epcot documentary Circle of Life: An Environmental Fable [202] [203] In 2019, a Funko Pop! figurine was released to commemorate the remake, which Screen Rant ranked among \"The 10 Best Disney Funko Pops\" [204] In 1997, actor Samuel E Wright originated the role of Mufasa on Broadway in the stage adaptation of the film [205] Prior to The Lion King, he had voiced Sebastian in Disney's The Little Mermaid (1989) [206] [207] Mufasa's role in the show was expanded with the addition of the songs \"The Morning Report\" and \"They Live in You\" [208] He was initially reluctant to audition, fearing it would be too similar to playing the Cowardly Lion from The Wizard of Oz (1939) or the Beast from Beauty and the Beast (1994), but relented once he was shown director Julie Taymor's plans for the character's design and costume [209] He based his performance on Masai warriors who hunted lions, and learned to growl by researching lions at the Bronx Zoo [209] He also received physiotherapy regularly due to the physical demands of the role [209] Wright's performance received positive reviews from The New York Times and Variety theater critics [210] [211] [212] In 1998, he was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical [213]\n\n\nNotes\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Mufasa**\n\nMufasa is a fictional character in Disney's 1994 animated film, The Lion King. He is the king of the Pride Lands and the father of Simba. Mufasa's character plays a significant role in the film's storyline, serving as a symbol of wisdom, power, and responsibility.\n\n**Role**\n\nIn The Lion King, King Mufasa rules over the Pride Lands with his mate, Queen Sarabi. Their young son, Simba, is destined to eventually succeed his father as king. Mufasa teaches Simba the importance of maintaining the delicate balance of life within the Pride Lands, cautioning the cub to prepare for when he will inevitably replace him. However, Mufasa's younger brother, Scar, covets the throne for himself and plots to eliminate both Mufasa and Simba to seize rulership. One fateful day, Scar triggers a wildebeest stampede that traps Simba in a deep gorge, knowing Mufasa would rush into danger to save his son. After rescuing Simba, Mufasa is caught in the stampede himself and struggles to climb out of the gorge, where Scar waits above. Mufasa pleads for help from his brother, but Scar pierces Mufasa's claws with his own and pushes him to his death below. Scar manipulates Simba into believing he caused Mufasa's demise, forcing him to flee the Pride Lands in guilt and shame.\n\n**Development**\n\nThe Lion King was the first film released during the Disney Renaissance to focus on a father-son relationship rather than a romantic one. Producer Don Hahn described the film as \"essentially a love story between a father and a son... It's about that moment in life when you realize that your father is going to pass on to you his wisdom and knowledge.\" In early drafts of the film, Mufasa was not related to Scar, but the producers decided that making these characters brothers would provide a more interesting story. However, the characters' physical appearances had already been finalized, leaving little family resemblance between the pair. According to director Rob Minkoff, they had always imagined that Mufasa accidentally gave Scar his eponymous scar when they were children. Although Mufasa and Scar refer to each other as \"brothers\" as members of the same pride, Hahn retrospectively suggested that it would have been unlikely for Mufasa and Scar to share the same parents because lion prides typically have only one adult male, with younger rogue lions often killing a pride's original leader and his offspring to assert dominance.\n\n**Creation**\n\nThe Lion King was the first film released during the Disney Renaissance to focus on a father-son relationship rather than a romantic one.

Jones was drawn to the role because he was impressed by drawings he had seen of Mufasa and relished the opportunity to create a character using only his voice. He described voice acting as the \"purest form\" of acting, likening it to performing in ancient Greek theatre. Jones's voice became synonymous with Mufasa, and his performance was widely praised for its authority and warmth.\n\n**Personality and Design**\n\nJones described Mufasa as an authoritative but ultimately gentle father. Jones's staunch demeanor during recording sessions served as inspiration for supervising animator Tony Fucile. Fucile said Jones provided both the regal quality and \"fatherly warmth\" the animators needed to create the character. Specifically, the animators borrowed Jones's \"dopey smile\" he would wear during recording sessions and incorporated it into Mufasa's face. Fucile found watching Jones's performance in the film Matewan (1987) to be particularly helpful because the actor \"used a lot of facial expressions and eye movements to communicate,\" mirroring Mufasa's tendency to be subtle and convey a lot of emotion with little movement. The animators borrowed some design elements from Mufasa for adult Simba to make the latter look more heroic.\n\n**Reception**\n\nCritics and audiences initially expressed varying opinions about Mufasa's death. According to Jessica Wang of Entertainment Weekly, no viewer was left \"emotionally unaffected\" in 1994. Dan Webster of The Spokesman-Review called the moment \"a plot twist unfamiliar to this era of family-values emphasis.\" Film critic Hal Hinson predicted that Mufasa's death would be as widely debated as \"the killing of Bambi's mother.\" At the time of the film's release, news outlets reported that several parents complained that the scene was not appropriate for a film marketed towards younger viewers, voicing concerns about children experiencing nightmares, worrying about their own parents, and regressing. In return, some commentators accused said parents of being overprotective. According to Darryl E Owens of Tampa Bay Times, child-development experts warned that the death could be potentially traumatizing and anxiety-inducing if parents fail to prepare their children before viewing, but child therapist Mercedes Ojeda-Castro encouraged parents to use the opportunity to discuss death. Several critics cited Mufasa's death as potentially frightening for younger viewers. Film critic Janet Maslin questioned the film's G rating, and Stone said the film \"could have done without\" Simba's attempts to awaken his dead father. Ranking it among the most traumatic moments from a Disney film, Paolo Ragusa of Consequence said, \"It may be cruel, but with years of reflection, it's a profoundly important detail in the scope of The Lion King, and though it's difficult to not feel the pangs of loss after all this time, it's animated with palpable emotion and cinematic elegance.\" Several reviewers, such as Roger Ebert, compared Mufasa's death to that of Bambi's mother, with Hugh Armitage of Digital Spy describing it as \"Bambi's mother's death for a new generation - just much more visceral and violent.\"\n\n**Legacy and Commendations**\n\nIn 2014, Camille Dautrich of the Springfield News-Leader described Mufasa as one \"of the world's most beloved animated characters.\" Reporting for Good Morning America, Nicole Pelletiere said his wisdom and legacy endeared him to Disney fans. The A.V Club ranked him the 30th \"best Disney animated character of all time,\" and GamesRadar+ ranked him 25th. Mufasa has been described by several publications as one of the greatest fathers to have appeared on film, with Zach Seemayer of Entertainment Tonight ranking him among \"the 13 greatest fictional fathers in movie history,\" and Business Insider calling him one of the 19 \"the best fictional dads of all time.\" Jeff Peterson of the Deseret News said the character \"demonstrates the qualities of a good father, which, incidentally, are the same qualities needed for Simba to become a good ruler later on.\" In 2022, Indy100 recognized Mufasa as one of the 100 greatest on-screen fathers, and Euronews included him among the \"The 12 best on-screen dads of all time.\" Ranking him the best movie dad, Ryan Christian of MovieWeb described Mufasa as \"the standard against which all movie dads are judged.\" GamesRadar+ named the character the fifth greatest movie father figure. The Daily Beast ranked him the sixth \"coolest movie dad,\" and Brian Tallerico of Vulture declared Mufasa Disney's most iconic father. America writer John Dougherty described Mufasa as \"graceful and dignified, but also warm and playful—the ideal father.\" Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly selected The Lion King as the \"one movie I'm going to watch on Father's Day\" due to Mufasa's love for Simba. Meanwhile, Maddie Garfinkle of People declared him \"one of the greatest kings\" in \"the history of animated cinema.\"\n\n**Death**\n\nDescribed by Isaac Williams of Comic Book Resources as \"one of the most impactful moments of any Disney film,\" Mufasa's murder at the hands of Scar is widely regarded as one of the most memorable on-screen deaths in film history. The scene comprising Mufasa's death and Simba's gradual realization have been described as inseparable from The Lion King franchise. Vanity Fair's Laura Bradley said his death \"became the benchmark against which all future film tragedies would be measured,\" comparing its legacy to that of Bambi's mother. Although death and violence had already been depicted in children's entertainment, Alex Spencer of The Escapist reported that nothing released before 1994 rivaled Mufasa's impact. Prior to Mufasa, deceased parents in Disney films had typically died or been killed off-screen. Josh Spiegel of /Film heralded The Lion King as the only Disney film that rivaled Bambi's depiction of coming of age through tragedy. Joseph Heindl of Game Rant described it as \"the other defining parental death in the Disney pantheon,\" after Bambi's mother, and writers for Legacy.com said both murders \"affected the children of their generations and the generations to follow.\" Jonathan Allford of The Guardian theorized that few preceding or subsequent parental deaths in Disney films have been as emotionally devastating as Mufasa's, which he attributed to the character's benevolence and audience connection. Pediatrician and writer Perri Klass said Mufasa's death subverted the absent or dead mother trope in Disney films and embraced the \"90's-style celebration of the involved dad,\" in contrast to Bambi's \"archetypically distant\" father. Collider's Diego Pineda Pacheco ranked it the second most heartbreaking death from a children's film, observing that any conversation regarding death in children's media is guaranteed to mention The Lion King, and Gem Seddon of GamesRadar+ ranked it the 20th saddest movie tearjerker. Nadira Goffe of Slate said, as \"one of the first and most visceral main-character deaths we would experience,\" Mufasa \"traumatized an entire age group.\"\n\n**In Other Media**\n\nTo promote the release of The Lion King in 1994, Mufasa began appearing in a plethora of merchandise licensed by Disney Consumer Products. Mufasa's likeness has been used in several Lion King tie-in products and media, including the PC game Disney's Animated Storybook: The Lion King (1994) and console game The Lion King: Simba's Mighty Adventure (2000). From 1995–2018, Mufasa provided the opening narration for the Epcot documentary Circle of Life: An Environmental Fable. In 2019, a Funko Pop! figurine was released to commemorate the remake, which Screen Rant ranked among \"The 10 Best Disney Funko Pops.\" In 1997, actor Samuel E Wright originated the role of Mufasa on Broadway in the stage adaptation of the film. Prior to The Lion King, he had voiced Sebastian in Disney's The Little Mermaid (1989). Mufasa's role in the show was expanded with the addition of the songs \"The Morning Report\" and \"They Live in You.\" He was initially reluctant to audition, fearing it would be too similar to playing the Cowardly Lion from The Wizard of Oz (1939) or the Beast from Beauty and the Beast (1994), but relented once he was shown director Julie Taymor's plans for the character's design and costume. He based his performance on Masai warriors who hunted lions, and learned to growl by researching lions at the Bronx Zoo. He also received physiotherapy regularly due to the physical demands of the role. Wright's performance received positive reviews from The New York Times and Variety theater critics. In 1998, he was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Mufasa\" following this outline:\n\n\nRole\nIn The Lion King (1994), King Mufasa rules over the Pride Lands with his mate, Queen Sarabi [1] Their young son, Simba, is destined to eventually succeed his father as king Mufasa teaches Simba the importance of maintaining the delicate balance of life within the Pride Lands, [2] and cautions the cub to prepare for when he will inevitably replace him [3] However, Mufasa's younger brother, Scar, covets the throne for himself, and plots to eliminate both Mufasa and Simba to seize rulership One fateful day, Scar triggers a wildebeest stampede that traps Simba in a deep gorge, knowing Mufasa would rush into danger to save his son [4] After rescuing Simba, Mufasa is caught in the stampede himself and struggles to climb out of the gorge, where Scar waits above As Mufasa pleads for help from his brother, Scar pierces Mufasa's claws with his own, [5] [6] and pushes him to his death below [4] [7] Scar manipulates Simba into believing he caused Mufasa's demise, [8] forcing him to flee the Pride Lands in guilt and shame [3] [9] Lost and alone, Simba seeks refuge in the jungle, where he is raised by Timon and Pumbaa, a meerkat and warthog [3] Despite his new carefree lifestyle, the guilt of his perceived actions linger [3] Years later, Simba reunites with Rafiki, a wise baboon who explains that Mufasa's spirit lives on within him [3] Mufasa appears to Simba in the clouds as a ghostly apparition to remind him about the importance of facing his responsibilities as his heir, [10] [11] prompting Simba to return to the Pride Lands, where he defeats Scar and ultimately reclaims his rightful place as king [3] In the sequel, The Lion King II: Simba's Pride (1998), Mufasa's role is reduced, mostly appearing to Simba as a God-like entity in the sky, and communicating with Rafiki via the wind [12]\n\n\nDevelopment\nThe Lion King was the first film released during the Disney Renaissance [a] to focus on a father-son relationship, rather than a romantic one [14] Producer Don Hahn described the film as \"essentially a love story between a father and a son ..

was Disney's initial choice to voice Mufasa [54] [55] [56] [57] Liam Neeson was also considered [58] [45] Mufasa was voiced by American actor James Earl Jones [59] Disney claims that, once the character was realized, it was difficult to envision anyone other than Jones voicing Mufasa [59] Jones was drawn to the role because he was impressed by drawings he had seen of Mufasa and relished the opportunity to create a character using only his voice, claiming the process reminded him of his early work performing on radio [59] As a prolific thespian, he was also attracted to the film's Shakespearean elements [59] He described voice acting as the \"purest form\" of acting, likening it to performing in ancient Greek theatre \"where the actors would wear masks In our case, the masks are the animators’ drawings and we just simply supply all the behaviors, emotions, and feelings behind that mask” [60]\n\n\nPersonality and design\nJones described Mufasa as an authoritative but

Born in Brooklyn, New York, Mann moved to Lowell, Massachusetts at the age of 10, where he grew up surrounded by a strong family of athletes.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nMann's parents, both from Saint Lucia, instilled in him a love for sports from a young age. His mother, Daynia La-Force, coached women's basketball at the University of Rhode Island, where Mann would later visit and become fascinated with the game. Mann's early life was marked by a passion for basketball, which he nurtured through playing for the Tilton School in New Hampshire. As a senior, Mann averaged 23.1 points and 7.8 rebounds per game, leading his team to a 31-5 record and the New England Preparatory School Athletic Conference Class AA championship. He was a First Team All-NEPSAC selection and earned the reputation as one of the top high school players in the country.\n\n**College Career**\n\nMann's impressive high school career caught the attention of college scouts, and he was a highly sought-after recruit. He ultimately signed with Florida State University, turning down offers from several other top programs. As a freshman, Mann played behind two experienced teammates, Malik Beasley and Dwayne Bacon, and averaged 5.2 points and 17.0 minutes per game. However, he was named a captain as a sophomore and emerged as a key contributor to the team. Mann posted 8.4 points and 4.5 rebounds per game, but his season was cut short in the first round of the 2017 NCAA Tournament when he suffered a torn abdominal and groin muscle. Despite being limited, Mann and the Seminoles reached the Elite Eight, where they ultimately fell short.\n\n**Professional Career**\n\nMann was drafted with the 48th pick of the 2019 NBA draft by the Los Angeles Clippers. He made his professional debut in the 2019 NBA Summer League, where he showcased his skills and impressed Clippers coaches. On July 9, 2019, the Clippers announced that they had signed Mann to a contract, and he officially joined the team. Mann made his NBA debut on October 24, 2019, coming off the bench in a 141-122 win over the Golden State Warriors. He played a reserve role throughout the season, but his hard work and dedication earned him a spot in the Clippers' rotation. On March 18, 2020, the Clippers announced that Mann had undergone surgery to repair a ligament in his right hand, which kept him out for several weeks. However, he returned to action in August 2020 and recorded a then-career-high 25 points, 14 rebounds, and nine assists in 42 minutes against the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\n**Los Angeles Clippers (2019-Present)**\n\nMann has been a key contributor to the Los Angeles Clippers since joining the team in 2019.

want anyone else to be injured or die in his name.\" [90] Toledo's older brother said Adam \"wasn't a bad kid like everyone says he was Us being little kids, we all made mistakes .. kids will be kids and will make mistakes, but will learn from them – something my little brother didn't get the chance to do.\" [91] The Toledo family's lawyer, Adeena Weiss-Ortiz, said \"The last time his mother saw

\"heroic\" [95] [97] Some attacked Toledo's mother [95] After implications were made that Toledo was a street kid, his family stated, “We want to correct the hurtful and false mischaracterization of Adam as a lonely child of the street who had no one to turn to This is simply not true.” [95] [98] Eddie Bocanegra, of READI Chicago, criticized those attacking Toledo's mother, telling The New Yorker, “It's bullshit..

This is a bad cop who acted out of anger and wanted to get even while Adam, barely a teenager, turned around and was trying to obey the officer's orders to show his hands The video shows an execution, nothing less LULAC demands accountability and anything short of that is unacceptable.” [114]\n\n\nChicago Police Department\nOn April 1, 2021, the CPD alerted its officers that Latin Kings gang members were allegedly instructed to open fire at unmarked police cruisers to retaliate for the shooting of Toledo [120]\n\n\nAftermath\nToledo's death was compared to the 2014 murder of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald by Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke as McDonald was walking away from police during a foot pursuit [121] [122] Others compared the shooting to the 2012 killing of 22-year-old Rekia Boyd, who was shot in the back of the head by off-duty Chicago Police Officer Dante Servin (Servin claimed he thought he saw a gun, though it turned out to have been a cellphone) [123] [124] Toledo's death was also compared to other police killings of Black and Latino children in the United States, including 12-year-old Tamir Rice, 7-year-old Aiyana Stanley-Jones, [125] 13-year-old Andy Lopez, and 18-year-old Andrés Guardado [126] [127] Toledo's death lastly drew comparisons to the killing of Anthony Alvarez, a 22-year-old Latino man who was killed in a foot pursuit by CPD two days after Toledo [128]\n\n\nComparisons to other cases\nToledo's death was compared to the 2014 murder of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald by Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke as McDonald was walking away from police during a foot pursuit [121] [122] Others compared the shooting to the 2012 killing of 22-year-old Rekia Boyd, who was shot in the back of the head by off-duty Chicago Police Officer Dante Servin (Servin claimed he thought he saw a gun, though it turned out to have been a cellphone) [123] [124] Toledo's death was also compared to other police killings of Black and Latino children in the United States, including 12-year-old Tamir Rice, 7-year-old Aiyana Stanley-Jones, [125] 13-year-old Andy Lopez, and 18-year-old Andrés Guardado [126] [127] Toledo's death lastly drew comparisons to the killing of Anthony Alvarez, a 22-year-old Latino man who was killed in a foot pursuit by CPD two days after Toledo [128]\n\n\nImpact on the Latino community\nToledo's death sparked discussion within the Latino community about police brutality, a major yet under-discussed issue affecting U.S Latino communities [129] [130] [131] According to Roberto Rodríguez, a professor of Mexican-American studies at the University of Arizona, many people in the Latino community still saw police violence as an African American issue, stating, \"It's like, when you think about Latinos, it's immigration, and if we’re gonna talk about police brutality, law enforcement abuse, we’re talking about the African-American community\" [132] Patrisia Macias-Rojas, a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago further stated, “there's a real opportunity here to link up what's been happening in Latino communities around immigration and the criminalization of youth with what's happening around Black Lives Matter.” [132]\n\n\nLittle Village\nIn Toledo's hometown of Little Village, some noted a generational divide between older and younger Latinos in their attitudes toward police in response to the shooting [133] [134] [135] In an interview with the Chicago Tribune, Doris Hernandez, a mother who lost her son to violence in 2012, said many older Latino immigrants and refugees in Little Village \"come from rural towns with strong conservative values that are reflected in their opinions about religion and policing.\" [133] In the same interview, Hernandez commended younger Latinos for trying to change the narrative for their parents and elders [133] According to Dolores Castañeda, a community organizer in Little Village, fears of intra-community violence sometimes led to a failure \"to focus on the root causes of crime, such as a lack of investment in the community, discriminatory policing and police brutality.\" [133] Others also noted the complexity of the issues facing the Latino community surrounding immigration status and language, in addition to stressors related to police brutality and poverty [136] Some in the community also expressed fears the CPD had stopped responding to calls in the neighborhood in retaliation for protests against Toledo's shooting; one resident stated, \"The police used to take a while before they showed up when people called them for anything Now they won't show up at all.\" [137]\n\n\nReform proposals\nAfter the release of the video, Illinois state Rep La Shawn Ford, the co-sponsor of a bill titled the Law Enforcement Accountability Act of 2021, called for a revamp of foot chase policies and the end of qualified immunity [118] Some community organizers in Chicago, meanwhile, called to \"defund the police and invest in our communities.” [138]\n\n\nFoot pursuits\nToledo's death led to a call from the mayor's office for a review of Chicago's foot pursuit practices [140] [141] Lightfoot and Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown said that changes to the city's foot-pursuit policy would be in place by the end of the summer of 2021 [142]\n\n\nConsent decree\nAt the time of the shooting, the CPD was operating under a court-ordered consent decree, which required the city to implement hundreds of reforms to its policing practices [144] Because consent decrees are monitored by the U.S Department of Justice, a group of Latino law associations called on the DOJ to open an investigation into Toledo's death, with a focus on three potential areas of reform: establish clear procedures about foot pursuits, develop oversight on how officers interact with children, and establish policies on how officers engage in car chases in densely populated neighborhoods [145] A federal investigation was never opened.\n\n\nPolice video\nIn response to the wide circulation of Stillman's body camera footage, the American journalist Allissa Richardson called for an amendment to the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act of 2005 to ban such video from being circulated on television and online without the victim's family consent [146] Richardson wrote, \"I now believe that circulating videos of Black and brown death at the hands of police reinforces white supremacy It does not deter it These videos are no longer exposing a corrupt police system They are a reminder of a social hierarchy that privileges police with qualified immunity, rewards racist vigilantes with internet fame and money, and punishes communities of color with death if they question that order.\" [146]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Killing of Adam Toledo**\n\nThe killing of Adam Toledo was a police shooting that occurred on March 29, 2021, in Chicago, Illinois.

This is a bad cop who acted out of anger and wanted to get even while Adam, barely a teenager, turned around and was trying to obey the officer's orders to show his hands The video shows an execution, nothing less LULAC demands accountability and anything short of that is unacceptable.” [114]\n\n\nChicago Police Department\nOn April 1, 2021, the CPD alerted its officers that Latin Kings gang members were allegedly instructed to open fire at unmarked police cruisers to retaliate for the shooting of Toledo [120]\n\n\nAftermath\nToledo's death was compared to the 2014 murder of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald by Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke as McDonald was walking away from police during a foot pursuit [121] [122] Others compared the shooting to the 2012 killing of 22-year-old Rekia Boyd, who was shot in the back of the head by off-duty Chicago Police Officer Dante Servin (Servin claimed he thought he saw a gun, though it turned out to have been a cellphone) [123] [124] Toledo's death was also compared to other police killings of Black and Latino children in the United States, including 12-year-old Tamir Rice, 7-year-old Aiyana Stanley-Jones, [125] 13-year-old Andy Lopez, and 18-year-old Andrés Guardado [126] [127] Toledo's death lastly drew comparisons to the killing of Anthony Alvarez, a 22-year-old Latino man who was killed in a foot pursuit by CPD two days after Toledo [128]\n\n\nComparisons to other cases\nToledo's death was compared to the 2014 murder of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald by Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke as McDonald was walking away from police during a foot pursuit [121] [122] Others compared the shooting to the 2012 killing of 22-year-old Rekia Boyd, who was shot in the back of the head by off-duty Chicago Police Officer Dante Servin (Servin claimed he thought he saw a gun, though it turned out to have been a cellphone) [123] [124] Toledo's death was also compared to other police killings of Black and Latino children in the United States, including 12-year-old Tamir Rice, 7-year-old Aiyana Stanley-Jones, [125] 13-year-old Andy Lopez, and 18-year-old Andrés Guardado [126] [127] Toledo's death lastly drew comparisons to the killing of Anthony Alvarez, a 22-year-old Latino man who was killed in a foot pursuit by CPD two days after Toledo [128]\n\n\nImpact on the Latino community\nToledo's death sparked discussion within the Latino community about police brutality, a major yet under-discussed issue affecting U.S Latino communities [129] [130] [131] According to Roberto Rodríguez, a professor of Mexican-American studies at the University of Arizona, many people in the Latino community still saw police violence as an African American issue, stating, \"It's like, when you think about Latinos, it's immigration, and if we’re gonna talk about police brutality, law enforcement abuse, we’re talking about the African-American community\" [132] Patrisia Macias-Rojas, a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago further stated, “there's a real opportunity here to link up what's been happening in Latino communities around immigration and the criminalization of youth with what's happening around Black Lives Matter.” [132]\n\n\nLittle Village\nIn Toledo's hometown of Little Village, some noted a generational divide between older and younger Latinos in their attitudes toward police in response to the shooting [133] [134] [135] In an interview with the Chicago Tribune, Doris Hernandez, a mother who lost her son to violence in 2012, said many older Latino immigrants and refugees in Little Village \"come from rural towns with strong conservative values that are reflected in their opinions about religion and policing.\" [133] In the same interview, Hernandez commended younger Latinos for trying to change the narrative for their parents and elders [133] According to Dolores Castañeda, a community organizer in Little Village, fears of intra-community violence sometimes led to a failure \"to focus on the root causes of crime, such as a lack of investment in the community, discriminatory policing and police brutality.\" [133] Others also noted the complexity of the issues facing the Latino community surrounding immigration status and language, in addition to stressors related to police brutality and poverty [136] Some in the community also expressed fears the CPD had stopped responding to calls in the neighborhood in retaliation for protests against Toledo's shooting; one resident stated, \"The police used to take a while before they showed up when people called them for anything Now they won't show up at all.\" [137]\n\n\nReform proposals\nAfter the release of the video, Illinois state Rep La Shawn Ford, the co-sponsor of a bill titled the Law Enforcement Accountability Act of 2021, called for a revamp of foot chase policies and the end of qualified immunity [118] Some community organizers in Chicago, meanwhile, called to \"defund the police and invest in our communities.” [138]\n\n\nFoot pursuits\nToledo's death led to a call from the mayor's office for a review of Chicago's foot pursuit practices [140] [141] Lightfoot and Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown said that changes to the city's foot-pursuit policy would be in place by the end of the summer of 2021 [142]\n\n\nConsent decree\nAt the time of the shooting, the CPD was operating under a court-ordered consent decree, which required the city to implement hundreds of reforms to its policing practices [144] Because consent decrees are monitored by the U.S Department of Justice, a group of Latino law associations called on the DOJ to open an investigation into Toledo's death, with a focus on three potential areas of reform: establish clear procedures about foot pursuits, develop oversight on how officers interact with children, and establish policies on how officers engage in car chases in densely populated neighborhoods [145] A federal investigation was never opened.\n\n\nPolice video\nIn response to the wide circulation of Stillman's body camera footage, the American journalist Allissa Richardson called for an amendment to the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act of 2005 to ban such video from being circulated on television and online without the victim's family consent [146] Richardson wrote, \"I now believe that circulating videos of Black and brown death at the hands of police reinforces white supremacy It does not deter it These videos are no longer exposing a corrupt police system They are a reminder of a social hierarchy that privileges police with qualified immunity, rewards racist vigilantes with internet fame and money, and punishes communities of color with death if they question that order.\" [146]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

They are commonly used in linguistic research, language documentation, and language teaching to provide a concise way of representing linguistic information. This article provides an overview of the conventions used in glossing abbreviations, including lists of abbreviations for various linguistic categories, punctuation and numbers, grammatical morphemes, and kinship relations.\n\n## Conventions\n\nGlossing abbreviations are used to represent the meaning of words or morphemes in a text. They are typically used in conjunction with a phonetic transcription of the word, which represents the sound of the word. The gloss is usually placed below the phonetic transcription, and it is separated from the phonetic transcription by a slash (/).\n\nNonabbreviated English words used as glosses are not included in the list below. Caution is needed with short glosses like AT, BY, TO, and UP, which could potentially be either abbreviations or (as in these cases) nonabbreviated English prepositions used as glosses.\n\n## Lists\n\nThe following lists of glossing abbreviations are commonly used:\n\n* **Punctuation and numbers**: Lehmann recommends using privative (PRV) or aversive (AVERS) instead.\n* **Grammatical abbreviations**: Lehmann recommends using privative (PRV) or aversive (AVERS) instead.\n* **Kinship**: It is common to abbreviate grammatical morphemes but to translate lexical morphemes. However, kin relations commonly have no precise translation, and in such cases they are often glossed with anthropological abbreviations.\n\n### Kinship\n\nKinship relations are often represented using a set of basic abbreviations, which are derived from English. These abbreviations are commonly used to represent nuclear kin terms, such as father, mother, brother, sister, husband, wife, son, and daughter. Additional terms may be used by some authors, but because the concept of e.g. \"aunt\" or \"cousin\" may be overly general or may differ between communities, sequences of basic terms are often used for greater precision.\n\nThere are two competing sets of conventions, one using one-letter abbreviations and the other using two-letter abbreviations.\n\n## One-Letter Abbreviations\n\nThe following one-letter abbreviations are commonly used:\n\n* F for father\n* M for mother\n* H for husband\n* W for wife\n* S for son\n* D for daughter\n* B for brother\n* Z for sister\n\n## Two-Letter Abbreviations\n\nThe following two-letter abbreviations are commonly used:\n\n* FA for father's brother\n* MA for mother's brother\n* MO for mother's sister\n* FAO for father's mother's brother\n* MAA for mother's mother's brother\n\n### Anthropological Abbreviations\n\nAnthropological abbreviations are often used to represent kinship relations in languages that do not have precise translations for these concepts. These abbreviations are derived from various languages and are commonly used in linguistic research and language documentation.\n\n## Literature\n\nThe use of glossing abbreviations has a long history in linguistic research, dating back to the early 20th century. The development of standardized glossing abbreviations has facilitated the comparison and analysis of linguistic data across languages and researchers.\n\n## Requirements for Glossing Abbreviations\n\nThe following requirements are commonly used to ensure consistency and clarity in the use of glossing abbreviations:\n\n* **Precision**: Glossing abbreviations should be precise and unambiguous.\n* **Consistency**: Glossing abbreviations should be used consistently throughout a text or document.\n* **Transparency**: Glossing abbreviations should be transparent and easy to understand.\n* **Standardization**: Glossing abbreviations should be standardized across languages and researchers.\n\nBy following these requirements and using the standardized glossing abbreviations outlined in this article, researchers and language documenters can ensure that their linguistic data is accurately and consistently represented, facilitating the comparison and analysis of linguistic data across languages and researchers.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"List_of_glossing_abbreviations\" following this outline:\n\n\nConventions\nNonabbreviated English words used as glosses are not included in the list below Caution is needed with short glosses like AT, BY, TO and UP, which could potentially be either abbreviations or (as in these cases) nonabbreviated English prepositions used as glosses.\n\n\nLists\nNonabbreviated English words used as glosses are not included in the list below Caution is needed with short glosses like AT, BY, TO and UP, which could potentially be either abbreviations or (as in these cases) nonabbreviated English prepositions used as glosses.\n\n\nPunctuation and numbers\nLehmann (2004) recommends using privative (PRV) or aversive (AVERS) instead [8]\n\n\nGrammatical abbreviations\nLehmann (2004) recommends using privative (PRV) or aversive (AVERS) instead [8]\n\n\nKinship\nIt is common to abbreviate grammatical morphemes but to translate lexical morphemes However, kin relations commonly have no precise translation, and in such cases they are often glossed with anthropological abbreviations Most of these are transparently derived from English; an exception is 'Z' for 'sister' (In anthropological texts written in other languages, abbreviations from that language will typically be used, though sometimes the single-letter abbreviations of the basic terms listed below are seen.)

Born on October 17, 1958, in Newnan, Georgia, Jackson has established himself as one of the most successful country artists of all time, with a career spanning over three decades.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJackson was born to Joseph Eugene \"Daddy Gene\" Jackson and Ruth Musick \"Mama Ruth\" Jackson, and has four older sisters. He and his immediate family lived in a small home built around his grandfather's old toolshed. The family is primarily of English descent. Jackson's mother lived in the home until her death on January 7, 2017.\n\nJackson began writing music in 1983. Growing up, he was heavily influenced by country music legends such as Hank Williams and Johnny Cash.\n\n**Career**\n\nJackson's music career began in Tennessee, where he got his first job in The Nashville Network's mailroom. His wife Denise was a flight attendant, and while working, she came into contact with Glen Campbell. Campbell handed her the business card of his manager and told her to call, which helped jumpstart Jackson's career.\n\nJackson eventually signed with Arista, and in 1989, he became the first artist signed to the newly formed Arista Nashville branch of Arista Records. Arista released Jackson's debut single, \"Blue Blooded Woman,\" in late 1989. Although the song failed to reach top 40 on Hot Country Songs, he reached number three by early 1990 with \"Here in the Real World.\"\n\nThis song served as the title track to his debut studio album, Here in the Real World, which also included two more top five hits (\"Wanted\" and \"Chasin' That Neon Rainbow\") and his first number one, \"I'd Love You All Over Again.\" Don't Rock the Jukebox was the title of Jackson's second album, released in 1991.

These first two songs both made number one.\n\nEverything I Love followed in 1996. Its first single, the Tom T Hall-penned \"Little Bitty,\" took Jackson to the top of the charts in late 1996. The album also included the number one hit \"There Goes\" and a number two cover of Charly McClain's 1980 single \"Who's Cheatin' Who.\" The album's fifth single was \"A House with No Curtains,\" which became his first release since 1989 to miss the top 10.\n\n**2000s**\n\nDue to a shift in the sound of country music towards a more pop sound in the 1990s and 2000s, Jackson and George Strait criticized the state of country music in the song \"Murder on Music Row.\" The song sparked debate in the country music community about whether \"traditional\" country music was actually dead or not.\n\nDespite the fact that the song was not officially released as a single, it became the highest-charting nonseasonal album cut (not available in any retail single configuration or released as a promotional single to radio during a chart run) to appear on Hot Country Singles & Tracks in the Broadcast Data Systems era, beating the record previously held by Garth Brooks' \"Belleau Wood.\"\n\nThe duo were invited to open the 2000 Academy of Country Music Awards (ACMAs) with a performance of the tune.

His six nominations included best entertainer, male artist, vocal collaboration, album, single, and video (two nominations in this category).\n\nAt the 2002 CMAs, Jackson set a record for having the most nominations in a single year – ten – many rising from the song \"Where Were You.\" It also brought his career total up to the second number of most nominations ever, after George Strait.\n\n\"Where Were You\" also was nominated for a Grammy for Song of the Year. At the 2003 Academy of Country Music Awards, Jackson won Album of the Year for Drive and Video of the Year for the video to \"Drive (For Daddy Gene).\"\n\n**Touring**\n\nJackson headlined the 1995 Fruit of the Loom Comfort Tour, a deal worth $40 million. It began January 20 in New Orleans and ran for a hundred dates.\n\nAlan Jackson's 2004 concert tour launched January 23 in Fort Myers, Florida, and was sponsored by NAPA Auto Parts in a deal that included Jackson's endorsement in TV spots.

Her remarkable career was marked by innovative routines, daring skills, and a deep passion for the sport. This article provides a comprehensive overview of Mukhina's life, career, and legacy.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nElena Mukhina was born on June 1, 1960, in Moscow, Russian SFSR. Her early life was marked by tragedy when both her parents died when she was just five years old. Her grandmother, Anna Ivanovna, stepped in to care for Mukhina, providing a stable and loving environment that allowed her to flourish.\n\nMukhina's early years were spent exploring her creative side, with a particular interest in dance and music. However, it was not until an athletic scout visited her school that she discovered her true passion for gymnastics. Eager to try out, Mukhina volunteered to join the school's gymnastics team, marking the beginning of a remarkable journey that would take her to the pinnacle of international competition.\n\n**Career**\n\nMukhina's gymnastics career was marked by an unwavering commitment to excellence. She joined the prestigious CSKA Moscow (Central Sport's Club of the Army) sports club, where she trained under the guidance of esteemed coaches. In recognition of her accomplishments, Mukhina was inducted into the CSKA Hall of Fame, a testament to her dedication and achievements.\n\nMukhina's innovative routines and daring skills made her a standout performer on the international stage. Her floor exercise tumbling passes were considered revolutionary, featuring a combination salto that would come to be known as the \"Muchina.\" This skill, which included a never-before-seen combination of twists and flips, set a new standard for female gymnasts and showcased Mukhina's incredible athleticism.\n\n**Injury**\n\nIn 1979, Mukhina's coach, Mikhail Klimenko, pushed her to take her skills to the next level by incorporating an element from men's gymnastics into her floor exercises. The Thomas salto, a 1½ backflip with 1½ twists ending in a forward roll, was a skill perfected by American gymnast Kurt Thomas. Klimenko believed that Mukhina had the potential to master this complex skill, but the pressure to perform it put her at risk of serious injury.\n\nTragically, Mukhina suffered a devastating paralytic injury during a training session, leaving her with quadriplegia. The injury was a devastating blow to Mukhina, her coaches, and the entire gymnastics community. Her future in the sport was uncertain, and the loss of her physical abilities was a profound shock.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe aftermath of Mukhina's injury was marked by a mix of emotions. Her coach, Klimenko, was deeply affected by the incident and eventually emigrated to Italy, where he lived with his children until his death from cancer in 2007. The incident also sparked a re-evaluation of the risks and pressures faced by gymnasts, highlighting the need for greater support and protection for athletes.\n\nMukhina's injury meant that she would not be able to compete at the 1980 Summer Olympics, a competition that would have been a career highlight. Despite this, her legacy continued to inspire generations of gymnasts, who were drawn to her innovative routines and dedication to the sport.\n\n**Death**\n\nElena Mukhina passed away on December 22, 2006, at the age of 46, due to apparent complications from quadriplegia. Her death was a poignant reminder of the risks and sacrifices that athletes make in pursuit of their passions.\n\n**Competitive History**\n\nMukhina's competitive history was marked by numerous accolades and achievements. She won the All-Around title and floor exercises at the 1978 World Championship, showcasing her incredible skill and athleticism. Her innovative routines and daring skills made her a standout performer on the international stage, and her legacy continues to inspire gymnasts today.\n\n**Eponymous Skills**\n\nMukhina has two eponymous skills listed in the Code of Points, a testament to her enduring legacy in the world of gymnastics. The \"Muchina\" and the \"Mukhina\" skills are both recognized as part of the sport's technical code, ensuring that her innovative routines and skills will continue to be celebrated and emulated by gymnasts around the world.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Gymnastics\n* Soviet Union\n* Olympics\n* CSKA Moscow\n* Mikhail Klimenko\n\nNote: This article is based on publicly available information and sources.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Elena_Mukhina\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nElena Mukhina was born 1 June 1960, in Moscow, Russian SFSR Both her parents died when she was five years old [1] She was raised by her grandmother, Anna Ivanovna.\n\n\nCareer\nMukhina took an interest in gymnastics and figure skating at an early age When an athletic scout visited her school, she eagerly volunteered to try out for gymnastics [1] She later joined the CSKA Moscow (\"Central Sport’s Club of the Army\") sports club In recognition of her accomplishments, Mukhina was inducted into the CSKA Hall of Fame [1]\n\n\nInjury\nMukhina's floor exercise tumbling passes were considered revolutionary at the time because they included a never-before seen combination salto (the \"Muchina\") In 1979, her coach wanted her to take it a step further and become one of the few female gymnasts to do an element taken from men's gymnastics, the Thomas salto (a 1½ backflip with 1½ twists ending in a forward roll, perfected by American gymnast Kurt Thomas) Even though Mukhina won the All-Around title and floor exercises at the 1978 World Championship with daring bar routines, a revolutionary balance beam dismount, and a floor routine with its own signature move, she was pressured to add this element to her floor exercises by her own coach and other higher-ranking Soviet coaches \n\n\nAftermath\nAccording to Larisa Latynina's 2004 interview, Mukhina's trainer, Mikhail Klimenko, was affected by her injury Because of her devastating injury, Mukhina could not be added to the 1980 Soviet Olympic team roster There was little doubt that the Soviet Olympic women's gymnastics team would get the gold medal in the team competition at the 1980 Summer Olympics, as it had at all previous Olympics Nevertheless, Klimenko had desperately wanted Mukhina to make the Olympic team roster because he wanted to become the \"Olympic champion's trainer.\" Soon after Mukhina's paralytic injury, Klimenko emigrated to Italy, where he lived with his children until his death from cancer on 14 November 2007, his 65th birthday [2]\n\n\nDeath\nMukhina died of apparent complications from quadriplegia on 22 December 2006(2006-12-22) (aged 46) [14] [13]\n\n\nCompetitive history\n [15]\n\n\nEponymous skills\nMukhina has two eponymous skills listed in the Code of Points [16]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

so many good woman players in Japan I have sister Very good Same stroke.\n\n\nMarriage and titles in Japan\nDuring 1947 Katsura caught the eye of American serviceman Vernon Greenleaf [11] (no relation to the pool and carom billiards champion Ralph Greenleaf), [18] a master sergeant in the U.S Army's Quartermaster Corps who had been in the armed services for 22 years [6] [18] Katsura and Greenleaf first met in a Tokyo service club where she was giving billiard exhibitions [11] Greenleaf began taking lessons from Katsura [14] and was quickly smitten with her [11] They were married on 30 November 1950, [19] but never had any children [7]\n\n\nImmigration to the U.S.\nIn 1951 Greenleaf was transferred to a U.S post from Haneda Air Base in Tokyo [14] He and Katsura, who spoke little English, [18] set sail for the United States on the USS Breckinridge, debarking in San Francisco at the end of December 1951, [14] just a few months before the 1952 World Three-Cushion Billiards tournament was scheduled to begin in that city on 6 March [23] Katsura had been conditionally invited to play at the world championship after Cochran, whose billiard parlor was hosting the tournament, had heard of her brilliance from Matsuyama [20] Cochran was an 8-time world champion having won the world crown at three-cushion billiards in 1933, 1935, 1937, 1938, 1944 and 1945, and at 18.2 balkline, in 1927 and 1934 [24] Cochran sent his son, W R (Dick) Cochran, a naval officer stationed in Japan, to investigate and received back a glowing report [20] that said (possibly to Cochran's annoyance), \"this girl is better than you are!\" [25] Though the decision was ultimately in the hands of the Billiard Congress of America as tournament sponsor, they gave Cochran the option to invite her [20]\n\n\n1952 World Three-Cushion Billiards tournament\nIf you eliminate three cushion, I don't think you could find five people in the world who could beat her Her best games are straight rail and balkline, but she'll be the three cushion champion of the world in time She has one of the best strokes I've ever seen, and she shoots as well left-handed as right-handed.\n\n\nFirst woman to compete for a world title\nIf you eliminate three cushion, I don't think you could find five people in the world who could beat her Her best games are straight rail and balkline, but she'll be the three cushion champion of the world in time She has one of the best strokes I've ever seen, and she shoots as well left-handed as right-handed.\n\n\nTournament roster\nThe 10 champions slated to play in the round robin format tournament [31] were Katsura, her mentor, Matsuyama, favorite and defending champion Willie Hoppe, Mexican champion Joe Chamaco, Herb Hardt of Chicago, New York's Art Rubin, Los Angeles' Joe Procita, Ray Kilgore of San Francisco, Jay Bozeman of Vallejo and Binghamton's Irving Crane [13] [33] [34] The championship between the invitees was to take place at Cochran's 924 Club, with 45 total games to be played [13] (each player to play every other once) [35] over the 17-day tournament ending on 22 March 1952 [13] The tournament was reported to have \"The greatest billiard field since before World War II\" [36] First place earned a $2,000 purse (today $22,900), plus thousands in exhibition fees Following behind to eight places were prizes of $1,000, $700, $500, $350, $300, $250 and $250 respectively [36]\n\n\nDetail of play\nOn the second day of the competition, [23] 7 March 1952, Katsura drew Irving Crane for her first match They made quite a contrast as Crane was the tallest

Born in Japan, Katsura began playing billiards at a young age and quickly rose to become one of the world's top players. Her remarkable skills and determination paved the way for future generations of female players. This article will explore Katsura's life, career, and achievements in the world of billiards.\n\n**Life and Career**\n\nKatsura's early life and career are shrouded in mystery, but it is known that she began playing billiards at a young age. She was reportedly a prodigy, practicing for hours every day to hone her skills. Katsura's dedication paid off, and she quickly gained recognition as one of Japan's top players. In the late 1940s, Katsura caught the eye of American serviceman Vernon Greenleaf, who was stationed in Tokyo. Greenleaf, a master sergeant in the U.S. Army's Quartermaster Corps, was impressed by Katsura's skills and began taking lessons from her. The two eventually married in 1950 and settled in the United States.\n\n**Marriage and Titles in Japan**\n\nDuring her time in Japan, Katsura continued to play and compete at a high level. She caught the attention of the Japanese billiards community, and her skills earned her several titles. In 1951, Katsura and her husband, Greenleaf, immigrated to the United States, where she began competing in international tournaments. Her skills quickly earned her recognition, and she became known as one of the world's top players.\n\n**Immigration to the U.S.**\n\nIn 1951, Greenleaf was transferred to a U.S. post from Haneda Air Base in Tokyo. He and Katsura, who spoke little English, set sail for the United States on the USS Breckinridge. The couple arrived in San Francisco in December 1951, just a few months before the 1952 World Three-Cushion Billiards tournament was scheduled to begin. Katsura had been conditionally invited to play at the world championship after Cochran, whose billiard parlor was hosting the tournament, had heard of her brilliance from Matsuyama.\n\n**1952 World Three-Cushion Billiards tournament**\n\nThe 1952 World Three-Cushion Billiards tournament was held in San Francisco, and Katsura was the first woman to compete in the tournament. She was part of a 10-player field that included some of the world's top players. The tournament was played in a round-robin format, with each player competing against every other player. Katsura's first match was against Irving Crane, who was the tallest player in the tournament. Crane emerged victorious, but Katsura showed impressive skills and determination. She went on to compete in several more matches, including a notable victory over Herb Hardt.\n\n**Exhibition Tours**\n\nKatsura's skills and charisma made her a sensation on the exhibition circuit. She toured the United States and Europe, playing against some of the world's top players. Her exhibitions were highly publicized, and she quickly became a household name. Katsura's popularity extended beyond the world of billiards, and she became a cultural icon in the 1950s.\n\n**1953–1954**\n\nIn 1953, Katsura returned to competition after a brief hiatus. She competed in the 1953 World Three-Cushion Billiards tournament in Chicago, where she faced off against some of the world's top players. Katsura's skills were as strong as ever, and she won several matches, including a notable victory over Ray Miller. However, she ultimately lost to Ezequiel Navarra in the final match.\n\n**1954 World Three-Cushion tournament**\n\nThe 1954 World Three-Cushion tournament was held in Buenos Aires, and Katsura was once again a top contender. She competed against a field of 8 players, including several of the world's top players. Katsura's skills were as strong as ever, but she ultimately lost to Navarra in the final match.\n\n**1955–1961**\n\nKatsura's career began to slow down in the mid-1950s. She continued to compete in exhibition matches, but her tournament schedule became less frequent. In 1958, Katsura made 30 exhibition appearances, but she had been in \"virtual retirement\" for about five years. During this break, Katsura published two billiards instruction books in Japan: \"Improve Your Billiards\" and \"Introduction to Billiards\".\n\n**Hiatus and exhibition**\n\nKatsura's hiatus from competition lasted for several years. However, she continued to compete in exhibition matches, including a notable match against Harold Worst in 1959. The match was played at Randolph Recreations in Chicago and attracted a large crowd. Katsura's skills were as strong as ever, and she won several matches against Worst.\n\n**TV spots**\n\nIn 1959, Katsura appeared on CBS' popular primetime television show, \"What's My Line?\". The show was in the format of a guessing game, and Katsura's occupation was revealed as \"Professional Billiard Player (World's Women's Champion)\". Katsura also appeared on ABC's \"You Asked For It\" in 1959 and 1960, demonstrating trick shots for the camera.\n\n**1961 title match with Worst**\n\nIn 1961, Harold Worst, the reigning champion, issued a challenge match to Katsura to defend his title. The match was played at the Pantlind Hotel in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and Katsura competed against some of the world's top players. Worst emerged victorious, winning six out of seven matches against Katsura.\n\n**After 1961**\n\nKatsura's career began to slow down in the early 1960s. She continued to compete in exhibition matches, but her tournament schedule became less frequent. In 1976, Katsura made an impromptu appearance at Palace Billiards in San Francisco, running 100 points at straight rail without problem.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nKatsura's legacy extends beyond her impressive skills and achievements in the world of billiards. She paved the way for future generations of female players and became a cultural icon in the 1950s. In 2002, a memorial tournament was held in Japan to honor Katsura's memory.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article cites several sources, including books, articles, and online resources.

her brilliance from Matsuyama [20] Cochran was an 8-time world champion having won the world crown at three-cushion billiards in 1933, 1935, 1937, 1938, 1944 and 1945, and at 18.2 balkline, in 1927 and 1934 [24] Cochran sent his son, W R (Dick) Cochran, a naval officer stationed in Japan, to investigate and received back a glowing report [20] that said (possibly to Cochran's annoyance), \"this girl is better than you are!\" [25] Though the decision was ultimately in the hands of the Billiard Congress of America as tournament sponsor, they gave Cochran the option to invite her [20]\n\n\n1952

games to be played [13] (each player to play every other once) [35] over the 17-day tournament ending on 22 March 1952 [13] The tournament was reported to have \"The greatest billiard field since before World War II\" [36] First place earned a $2,000 purse (today $22,900), plus thousands in exhibition fees Following behind to eight places were prizes of $1,000, $700, $500, $350, $300, $250 and

this would allow animators to complete sequences if the Directors Guild of America went on strike in July 2008, which ultimately did not happen [27] [28] The director considered making a small project in between Transformers and its sequel, but knew \"you have your baby and you don't want someone else to take it\" [24] The film was given a $200 million budget, which was $50 million more than the 2007 film, [29] and some of the action scenes rejected for the original were written into the sequel, such as the way Optimus is reintroduced in this film [30] Lorenzo di Bonaventura said the studio proposed filming two sequels simultaneously, but he and Bay concurred that was not the right direction for the series [31]\n\n\nTransformers: Dark of the Moon (2011)\nFor the third film, as a preemptive measure before the release of Revenge of the Fallen, Michael Lucchi and Paramount announced on March 16, 2009, that a third film would be released in IMAX 3-D on July 1, 2011, which earned a surprised response from director Bay:\n\n\nTransformers: Age of Extinction (2014)\nIn February 2012, producer di Bonaventura stated that a fourth film was in the works, aiming for a 2014 release, with Michael Bay to direct and produce [65] On the same day, Paramount Pictures and Michael Bay announced a June 27, 2014 release date for a fourth film [66] Ehren Kruger would pen the script and Steve Jablonsky would score the film, as each had for the previous film [67] [68] The film is set five years after the events in Transformers: Dark of the Moon [69] Shia LaBeouf did not return in any future installments Mark Wahlberg was instead cast in the lead role as new character, Cade Yeager [70] [71] [72] In November 2012, casting began to search for two more leads Isabelle Cornish, Nicola Peltz, Gabriella Wilde, and Margaret Qualley were all considered to play Cade's daughter Tessa Yeager, while Luke Grimes, Landon Liboiron, Brenton Thwaites, Jack Reynor, and Hunter Parrish were all considered to play Tessa's race-car-driving boyfriend, Shane Dyson [73] Bay announced on his website that Reynor would portray Shane and that the fourth film would start the next installment in the overall series;

DC Extended Universe Goldsman is the head of the future projects, and worked with franchise director Michael Bay, executive producer Steven Spielberg, and producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura to organize a \"writers' room\" that incubates ideas for potential Transformers films The writers' room members include Christina Hodson, Lindsey Beer, Andrew Barrer, and Gabriel Ferrari (Ant-Man), Robert Kirkman (The Walking Dead), Art Marcum & Matt Holloway, Zak Penn (Pacific Rim Uprising), Jeff Pinkner (The Amazing Spider-Man 2), Ken Nolan, and Geneva Robertson-Dworet [95] Kirkman left the room after just one day to undergo throat surgery [96] In July 2015, Akiva Goldsman and Jeff Pinkner were announced as the fifth Transformers film's screenwriters [97] However, on November 20, due to Goldsman's

The ANS was designed to provide a robust and scalable platform for network-attached storage, file serving, and other server applications. Although the ANS was a significant product in Apple's history, it ultimately failed to gain significant market traction and was eventually discontinued.\n\n**Hardware**\n\nThe Apple Network Server's hardware was supposed to be based on a new logic board design specific to the product. During the development of the hardware, Apple abandoned the original mainboard design for unconfirmed reasons. In order to move forward and ship the product, Apple made modifications to the Power Macintosh 9500 logic board and ROM (locking out all Mac OS calls) and ported AIX to the new hardware. Whether related to the hardware change or by coincidence, Apple also abandoned its NetWare on PowerPC development (codename: Wormhole) at this time.\n\nThe general logic board layout seems to suggest a close relationship with PowerPC-based RS/6000 systems by IBM, which also were designed to run AIX. On the other hand, many logic board components, especially the Open Firmware boot ROM, are similar to the \"Tsunami\" board used in the Power Macintosh 9500 and some Macintosh clones. The PowerPC 604e processor, which was used in the ANS, was a high-performance CPU designed for server applications. The ANS also featured a large amount of system memory, up to 2 GB, and a variety of storage options, including internal disks and external SCSI devices.\n\n**Software**\n\nThe Network Servers were sold exclusively with AIX, in a version called \"AIX for Apple Network Servers\" with some Apple-specific features, like AppleShare services, added. Two revisions, 4.1.4 and 4.1.5, exist. Apple's own Unix variant A/UX had already been discontinued and does not support the PowerPC. Due to their AIX OS and hardware similarities, the Network Servers are mostly binary compatible with the RS/6000 series. However, applications which rely on early RS/6000's POWER2 processor and Micro Channel bus are incompatible with the ANS's PowerPC CPU and PCI bus.\n\nThe AIX operating system was a significant factor in the ANS's design and functionality. AIX was a robust and scalable Unix-based operating system that provided a high level of performance and reliability. The AIX for Apple Network Servers version was specifically designed for the ANS and provided a range of features and tools for managing and optimizing server performance. AppleShare services, which were added to AIX for the ANS, provided a range of features for managing and sharing files, printers, and other resources.\n\n**Status**\n\nAs of 2005, most Apple Network Servers had been removed from service and most had been returned to Apple or sold on the secondary market, either factory remanufactured or as-is, or sent to a recycler and crushed. It was once not uncommon for a well-featured ANS to barely recover the $0.99 minimum bid on eBay. Shipping of an ANS is expensive, about $100 from a U.S.-to-U.S location, if sent via bulk shipping. Few, if any, replacement parts are available, particularly not the mechanical components.\n\nThe ANS was a significant product in Apple's history, but it ultimately failed to gain significant market traction. The failure of the ANS was likely due to a combination of factors, including the competition from established server vendors and the high cost of the product. Despite its failure, the ANS remains an interesting footnote in the history of Apple's server products.\n\n**See also**\n\n* AppleShare\n* AIX\n* PowerPC\n* RS/6000\n* Unix\n* Server hardware\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any references.

on 16 reviews, with an average score of 8.11/10 and the consensus: \"Modern Family's sophomore season sings with ingenious sitcom structure and an ensemble in perfect comedic harmony – even if the tunes are a little familiar\" [139] Robert Bianco of USA Today gave the second season four out of four stars, saying \"Not since Frasier has a sitcom offered such an ideal blend of heart and smarts, or proven itself so effortlessly adept at so many comic variations, from subtle wordplay to big-laugh slapstick to everything in between.\" [140] In a later review Bianco stated \"as good as it was in its first year, is even better in its second\", positively comparing the characters to the characters from The Mary Tyler Moore Show, The Cosby Show, and Friends [141] During the second season, Adweek named the show one of the 100 Most Influential TV Shows (98th chronologically) [142] [143] Despite this, some critics were less favorable toward the season and described it as a sophomore slump [144] [145] Eric Stonestreet's acting was widely praised throughout the first season, [134] but criticized during season two for being too contrived and \"over-the-top\"; [146] [147] Alan Sepinwall called

consistently delivering inspired farce and making it look effortless.\" [150] Slant Magazine reviewer Peter Swanson wrote that while the first episode was \"the type of wacky-location stunt that's usually reserved for the fifth or sixth season of a dying sitcom,\" the following episodes \"have been better.. but they're still uneven\" [151] He also criticized the writers for relying too much on \"stunt episodes and celebrity cameos, like David Cross\" [151] He ultimately gave the season 3 out of 4 stars [151] James Parker of The Atlantic said, at the beginning of the third season that \"Modern Family is very, very funny, almost ruthlessly so It's a bit of a master class in pace and brevity The writing is Vorsprung durch Technik: hectically compressed but dramatically elegant, prodigal in its zingers and snorters but austere in its construction.\" He found it an exception to his dislike for sitcoms that do not use a laugh track [65] During the third season, New York Times columnist Frank Bruni argued that gay criticism of Cameron and Mitchell actually showed the progress gays have made toward social acceptance \"A decade ago,\" he wrote, \" [gays] would have balked—and balked loudly—at how frequently Cameron in particular tips into limp-wristed, high-voiced caricature.\" But now, \"most gay people trust that the television audience knows we're a diverse tribe, not easily pigeonholed Modern Family endows us with a sort of comic banality It's an odd kind of progress But it's progress nonetheless.\" [152]\n\n\nSeason 4\nThe fourth season of Modern Family received positive reviews from critics Rotten Tomatoes gives the season an approval rating of 67% based on 11 reviews, with an average score of 7.75/10 and the consensus: \"Modern Family still has charm to burn and boasts a uniformly excellent cast, but the series' subversive edge has dulled\" [153] Halfway through the season, Rachel Stein of Television Without Pity wrote, \"much as I liked the pairings and some of the dialogue,  [\"New Year's Eve\"] is just another contrived episode of Modern Family we can cite when we talk later about how a different show should have won the 2013 Emmy for Best Comedy.\" [154] Dalene Rovenstein of Paste Magazine gave the season a positive review, but said a better season was possible [155]\n\n\nSeason 5\nThe fifth season of Modern Family also received positive reviews On Rotten Tomatoes, season five has a rating of 90% based on 10 reviews, with an average score of 7.57/10 and the consensus: \"Modern Family returns to its conventional roots with grace in a fifth season that delights in providing reliable laughs and rekindles the show's trademark warmth\" [156] Reviewing the season's first eight episodes, Matthew Wolfson of Slant Magazine wrote that the show \"appear [ed] to have finally arrived at the depressing and predictable low point toward which it  [had] been trending for the past two years.\" He also went on to say that the show had \"turned into a shrill pastiche of stereotypical characterizations and superficial banter lacking both feeling and wit\", assigning it a rating of 1.5/4 stars [157] Different writers for The A.V Club rated, in total, a majority of the former-half episodes with a \"B−\" grade or less One writer for the magazine, Joshua Alston, gave \"ClosetCon '13\" a \"C+\" and remarked that \"Modern

You'll Love It!\" Gwen Ihnat of The A.V Club stated that the episode represents \"all the reasons why we still watch Modern Family\" and awarded the episode an A− [165] On the same site, David Kallison reviewed \"Grill, Interrupted\", saying: \"This season proves that sitcoms can survive on solid characters and solid jokes.\" [166]\n\n\nSeason 7\nThe seventh season received positive reviews from critics with many critics calling it similar to the fourth and fifth seasons On Rotten Tomatoes, this season is rated 67% with 6 reviews and an average rating of 6.5/10 [167] Kyle Fowle from The A.V Club had a very mixed reaction to the season, only giving one episode an A− or higher [168] Fowle felt the season was frustrating, believing the season would be defined \"by its lack of character progress and overstuffed episodes.\" [169]\n\n\nLater seasons\nThe series was renewed for a 9th and 10th season on May 10, 2017 [170] Season 9 premiered on September 27, 2017, while season 10 premiered on September 26, 2018 [171]\n\n\nAccolades\nModern Family has won 22 Primetime Emmy Awards and 6 Writers Guild of America Awards The show also later received a GLSEN Respect Award for its portrayal of \"positive images and storylines that reflect a diverse America, including the depiction of a family headed by a gay couple.\" In 2010, Modern Family was nominated for five Television Critics Association Awards [175]  To reinforce the idea of an ensemble cast, the cast all submitted themselves in the Supporting Actor and Actress categories instead of Lead Actor and Actress for the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards [176] [177] The series has also been put on multiple critics' lists In 2010, the series was listed 2nd on Time's Top Ten Best Shows of 2009, [178] 2nd on BuddyTV's Top Ten Best Shows of 2009, [179] Jason Hughes Best TV of 2009, [180] Modern Family was awarded a Peabody Award in 2009 [181] In 2012, the show won the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy [182] and was nominated for a British Academy Television Award Every season of the show was also named one of the top 10 TV seasons of the year (from 2009 to 2012) by the American Film Institute [183]\n\n\nEmmy Awards received by cast\nThe following is a list of Emmy nominations received by the cast of the series Wins are highlighted in boldface.\n\n\nCriticism\nMichelle Haimoff of the Christian Science Monitor criticized the show during its third season for only casting the women as stay-at-home moms while the husbands have highly successful careers: \"There is a difference between quirky, flawed characters and ones who are incapable of professional success And when the latter is reliably female, it makes for sexist television It also makes for unrealistic television.\" [188] Late Night with Jimmy Fallon writer Ali Waller asked her Twitter followers in 2013 \"If Modern Family is so 'modern' then why don't any of the women have jobs?\" [189] Other authors reinforced this criticism, claiming that stay-at-home mothers are no longer the norm in modern society [190] Claire later went to work in season five.\n\n\nImpact\nIn early 2013, a spin-off series centered around Rob Riggle's character Gil Thorpe was revealed to be in early stages of development [211]\n\n\nAdaptations\nIn early 2013, a spin-off series centered around Rob Riggle's character Gil Thorpe was revealed to be in early stages of development [211]\n\n\nPotential spinoffs\nIn early 2013, a spin-off series centered around Rob Riggle's character Gil Thorpe was revealed to be in early stages of development [211]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Modern Family\n\nModern Family is an American sitcom that premiered on September 23, 2009, on ABC.

indicating \"universal acclaim\" [129]\n\n\nSeason 2\nThe show's second season received mostly positive reviews from critics Season two has a rating of 88% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 16 reviews, with an average score of 8.11/10 and the consensus: \"Modern Family's sophomore season sings with ingenious sitcom structure and an ensemble in perfect comedic harmony – even if the tunes are a little familiar\" [139] Robert Bianco of USA Today gave the second season four out of four stars, saying \"Not since Frasier has a sitcom offered such an ideal blend of heart and smarts, or proven itself so effortlessly adept at so many comic variations, from subtle wordplay to big-laugh slapstick to everything in between.\" [140] In a later review Bianco stated \"as good as it was in its first year, is even better in its second\", positively comparing the characters to the characters from The Mary Tyler Moore Show, The Cosby Show, and Friends [141] During the second season, Adweek named the show one of the 100 Most Influential TV Shows (98th chronologically) [142] [143] Despite this, some critics were less favorable toward the season and described it as a sophomore slump [144] [145] Eric Stonestreet's acting was widely praised throughout the first season, [134] but criticized during season two for being too contrived and \"over-the-top\"; [146] [147] Alan Sepinwall called Cameron Tucker a \"whiny, overly-sensitive diva\" [146] On the other hand, the praise for Ty Burrell's performance (as Phil Dunphy) continued [134] [148] [149]\n\n\nSeason 3\nThe third season was met with critical acclaim On Rotten Tomatoes, season three has a rating of 92% based on 13 reviews, with an average score of 8.33/10 and the consensus: \"Modern Family settles into a well-oiled groove, consistently delivering inspired farce and making it look effortless.\" [150] Slant Magazine reviewer Peter Swanson wrote that while the first episode was \"the type of wacky-location stunt that's usually reserved for the fifth or sixth season of a dying sitcom,\" the following episodes \"have been better.. but they're still uneven\" [151] He also criticized the writers for relying too much on \"stunt episodes and celebrity cameos, like David Cross\" [151] He ultimately gave the season 3 out of 4 stars [151] James Parker of The Atlantic said, at the beginning of the third season that \"Modern Family is very, very funny, almost ruthlessly so It's a bit of a master class in pace and brevity The writing is Vorsprung durch Technik: hectically compressed but dramatically elegant, prodigal in its zingers and snorters but austere in its construction.\" He found it an exception to his dislike for sitcoms that do not use a laugh track [65] During the third season, New York Times columnist Frank Bruni argued that gay criticism of Cameron and Mitchell actually showed the progress gays have made toward social acceptance \"A decade ago,\" he wrote, \" [gays] would have balked—and balked loudly—at how frequently Cameron in particular tips into limp-wristed, high-voiced caricature.\" But now, \"most gay people trust that the television audience knows we're a diverse tribe, not easily pigeonholed Modern Family endows us with a sort of comic banality It's an odd kind of progress But it's progress nonetheless.\" [152]\n\n\nSeason 4\nThe fourth season of Modern Family received positive reviews from critics Rotten Tomatoes gives the season an approval rating of 67% based on 11 reviews, with an average score of 7.75/10 and the consensus: \"Modern Family still has charm to burn and boasts a uniformly excellent cast, but the series' subversive edge has dulled\" [153] Halfway through the season, Rachel Stein of Television Without Pity wrote, \"much as I liked the pairings and some of the dialogue,  [\"New Year's Eve\"] is just another contrived episode of Modern Family we can cite when we talk later about how a different show should have won the 2013 Emmy for Best Comedy.\" [154] Dalene Rovenstein of Paste Magazine gave the season a positive review, but said a better season was possible [155]\n\n\nSeason 5\nThe fifth season of Modern Family also received positive reviews On Rotten Tomatoes, season five has a rating of 90% based on 10 reviews, with an average score of 7.57/10 and the consensus: \"Modern Family returns to its conventional roots with grace in a fifth season that delights in providing reliable laughs and rekindles the show's trademark warmth\" [156] Reviewing the season's first eight episodes, Matthew Wolfson of Slant Magazine wrote that the show \"appear [ed] to have finally arrived at the depressing and predictable low point toward which it  [had] been trending for the past two years.\" He also went on to say that the show had \"turned into a shrill pastiche of stereotypical characterizations and superficial banter lacking both feeling and wit\", assigning it a rating of 1.5/4 stars [157] Different writers for The A.V Club rated, in total, a majority of the former-half episodes with a \"B−\" grade or less One writer for the magazine, Joshua Alston, gave \"ClosetCon '13\" a \"C+\" and remarked that \"Modern Family becomes a high-wire act when it separates its characters into three storylines with no overlap between them.\" [158] The second half was more warmly received, with three episodes rated an \"A−\" or higher.\n\n\nSeason 6\nThe show's sixth season received highly positive reviews from TV critics, with some claiming that it was an improvement over the last few seasons [159] This season has a rating of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 7 reviews, with an average score of 7.67/10 [160] Joshua Alston and Gwen Ihnat The A.V Club have awarded the majority of episodes a \"B\" grade or higher – with particular praise for \"The Day We Almost Died\" and \"Closet? You'll Love It!\" – marking an improvement over the repeated \"C\" grade given throughout the previous season's former half [161] \"Connection Lost\" received high critical acclaim, with many praising the episode's writing, originality and \"success in transcending what could have been a gimicky episode\" [162] [163] [164] In her review for \"Closet? You'll Love It!\" Gwen Ihnat of The A.V Club stated that the episode represents \"all the reasons why we still watch Modern Family\" and awarded the episode an A− [165] On the same site, David Kallison reviewed \"Grill, Interrupted\", saying: \"This season proves that sitcoms can survive on solid characters and solid jokes.\" [166]\n\n\nSeason 7\nThe seventh season received positive reviews from critics with many critics calling it similar to the fourth and fifth seasons On Rotten Tomatoes, this season is rated 67% with 6 reviews and an average rating of 6.5/10 [167] Kyle Fowle from The A.V Club had a very mixed reaction to the season, only giving one episode an A− or higher [168] Fowle felt the season was frustrating, believing the season would be defined \"by its lack of character progress and overstuffed episodes.\" [169]\n\n\nLater seasons\nThe series was renewed for a 9th and 10th season on May 10, 2017 [170] Season 9 premiered on September 27, 2017, while season 10 premiered on September 26, 2018 [171]\n\n\nAccolades\nModern Family has won 22 Primetime Emmy Awards and 6 Writers Guild of America Awards The show also later received a GLSEN Respect Award for its portrayal of \"positive images and storylines that reflect a diverse America, including the depiction of a family headed by a gay couple.\" In 2010, Modern Family was nominated for five Television Critics Association Awards [175]  To reinforce the idea of an ensemble cast, the cast all submitted themselves in the Supporting Actor and Actress categories instead of Lead Actor and Actress for the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards [176] [177] The series has also been put on multiple critics' lists In 2010, the series was listed 2nd on Time's Top Ten Best Shows of 2009, [178] 2nd on BuddyTV's Top Ten Best Shows of 2009, [179] Jason Hughes Best TV of 2009, [180] Modern Family was awarded a Peabody Award in 2009 [181] In 2012, the show won the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy [182] and was nominated for a British Academy Television Award Every season of the show was also named one of the top 10 TV seasons of the year (from 2009 to 2012) by the American Film Institute [183]\n\n\nEmmy Awards received by cast\nThe following is a list of Emmy nominations received by the cast of the series Wins are highlighted in boldface.\n\n\nCriticism\nMichelle Haimoff of the Christian Science Monitor criticized the show during its third season for only casting the women as stay-at-home moms while the husbands have highly successful careers: \"There is a difference between quirky, flawed characters and ones who are incapable of professional success And when the latter is reliably female, it makes for sexist television It also makes for unrealistic television.\" [188] Late Night with Jimmy Fallon writer Ali Waller asked her Twitter followers in 2013 \"If Modern Family is so 'modern' then why don't any of the women have jobs?\" [189] Other authors reinforced this criticism, claiming that stay-at-home mothers are no longer the norm in modern society [190] Claire later went to work in season five.\n\n\nImpact\nIn early 2013, a spin-off series centered around Rob Riggle's character Gil Thorpe was revealed to be in early stages of development [211]\n\n\nAdaptations\nIn early 2013, a spin-off series centered around Rob Riggle's character Gil Thorpe was revealed to be in early stages of development [211]\n\n\nPotential spinoffs\nIn early 2013, a spin-off series centered around Rob Riggle's character Gil Thorpe was revealed to be in early stages of development [211]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born on June 4, 2021, she has become a topic of interest for the media and the public due to her royal status and mixed-race ancestry. This article provides an overview of Princess Lilibet's life, including her birth, family, titles, and succession.\n\n**Birth, Family, and Infancy**\n\nLilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor was born at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara, California, on June 4, 2021, at 11:40 PDT (18:40 UTC). Her birth, along with her name, were announced two days later. She is named after her paternal great-grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, who was called \"Lilibet\" by her family, and her paternal grandmother, Diana, Princess of Wales. Her nickname is \"Lili\". She is the second child of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and has an older brother, Archie.\n\nLilibet is a member of the British royal family and has mixed-race ancestry, having African and European maternal lineage. She has dual citizenship of the United States and the United Kingdom. Her parents, Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, have been vocal about their desire to give Lilibet a more private and normal upbringing, away from the intense media scrutiny that they have experienced.\n\n**Titles, Styles, and Succession**\n\nAt the accession of Charles III, Lilibet became entitled to use the title \"princess\" and style \"royal highness\" as the child of a son of the monarch, pursuant to letters patent issued by King George V in 1917. However, sources reported that it was unclear whether she would use that title, noting that not all members of the royal family who are eligible for a title choose to use one. An 8 March 2023 statement by a spokesperson for Lilibet's parents confirming her baptism days earlier marked the first time that her parents had publicly used her title of \"princess\", with the announcement referring to her as \"Princess Lilibet Diana\".\n\nThe official website of the royal family was updated to refer to her as \"Princess Lilibet of Sussex\" on 9 March 2023. Lilibet will use titles in formal settings but not in everyday conversations. This decision reflects the modernization of the British royal family's approach to titles and the use of language.\n\n**Relationship with the Royal Family**\n\nAs a member of the royal family, Princess Lilibet's relationship with her relatives is complex and multifaceted. Her parents, Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, have been critical of the royal family's handling of their daughter's birth and the media scrutiny that they have faced. They have also been vocal about their desire to give Lilibet a more normal and private upbringing.\n\nLilibet's great-grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, was known to be fond of her and had a close relationship with her parents. However, the queen's death in 2022 has created a new dynamic within the royal family, with Lilibet's parents seeking to navigate their own roles and responsibilities as members of the royal family.\n\n**Impact and Legacy**\n\nPrincess Lilibet's birth has had a significant impact on the British royal family and the wider public. Her mixed-race ancestry and her parents' decision to give her a more private and normal upbringing have sparked a national conversation about the role of the royal family in modern society.\n\nLilibet's legacy will be shaped by her parents' decisions and her own actions as she grows older. As a member of the royal family, she will face unique challenges and opportunities that will shape her life and the lives of those around her.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* British royal family\n* Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex\n* Meghan, Duchess of Sussex\n* Archie Mountbatten-Windsor\n* Queen Elizabeth II\n* Diana, Princess of Wales\n* King George V\n\nNote: This article is a work of encyclopedic writing and is intended to provide a factual and informative overview of Princess Lilibet of Sussex's life and experiences.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Princess_Lilibet_of_Sussex\" following this outline:\n\n\nBirth, family and infancy\nLilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor was born at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara, California, on 4 June 2021 at 11:40 PDT (18:40 UTC) Her birth, along with her name, were announced two days later She is named after her paternal great-grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, who was called \"Lilibet\" by her family, [1] [2] and her paternal grandmother, Diana, Princess of Wales [3] Her nickname is \"Lili\" [4] She is the second child of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and has an older brother, Archie [3] Lilibet is a member of the British royal family and has mixed-race ancestry, having African and European maternal lineage [5] She has dual citizenship of the United States and the United Kingdom [6]\n\n\nTitles, styles, and succession\nAt the accession of Charles III, Lilibet became entitled to use the title \"princess\" and style \"royal highness\" as the child of a son of the monarch, pursuant to letters patent issued by King George V in 1917 [13] However, sources reported that it was unclear whether she would use that title, noting that not all members of the royal family who are eligible for a title choose to use one [14] [15] An 8 March 2023 statement by a spokesperson for Lilibet's parents confirming her baptism days earlier marked the first time that her parents had publicly used her title of \"princess\", with the announcement referring to her as \"Princess Lilibet Diana\" [16] The official website of the royal family was updated to refer to her as \"Princess Lilibet of Sussex\" on 9 March 2023 [17] [18] Lilibet will use titles in formal settings but not in everyday conversations [19]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It was created in 1966 by Maulana Karenga, a black separatist and a figure in the Black Power movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Kwanzaa is observed from December 26 to January 1, and its name comes from the Swahili phrase \"matunda ya kwanza,\" which means \"first fruits.\"\n\n**History and Etymology**\n\nMaulana Karenga created Kwanzaa in 1966 during the aftermath of the Watts riots in Los Angeles. He wanted to give black people an alternative to the existing holiday of Christmas and give them an opportunity to celebrate themselves and their history, rather than simply imitating the practice of the dominant society. For Karenga, a cultural revolution was essential before a violent revolution, as it would give identity, purpose, and direction.\n\nKarenga developed the principles of Kwanzaa in 1965, a year before the holiday itself. These seven principles are all Swahili words and together comprise the Kawaida or \"common\" philosophy, a synthesis of nationalist, pan-Africanist, and socialist values.\n\n**Nguzo Saba (The Seven Principles)**\n\nThe seven principles of Kwanzaa, also known as Nguzo Saba, are:\n\n1. **Umoja** (Unity): The principle of unity and togetherness, emphasizing the importance of community and cooperation.\n2. **Kujichagulia** (Self-Determination): The principle of self-determination and the ability to make choices and decisions.\n3. **Ujima** (Collective Work and Responsibility): The principle of collective work and responsibility, emphasizing the importance of working together to achieve common goals.\n4. **Ujamaa** (Cooperative Economics): The principle of cooperative economics, emphasizing the importance of economic empowerment and self-sufficiency.\n5. **Nia** (Purpose): The principle of purpose and the importance of having a clear understanding of one's goals and values.\n6. **Kuumba** (Creativity): The principle of creativity and the importance of artistic expression and innovation.\n7. **Imani** (Faith): The principle of faith and the importance of having faith in oneself, one's community, and one's values.\n\nThese principles are the foundation of Kwanzaa and are meant to guide individuals and communities in their daily lives.\n\n**Symbols**\n\nKwanzaa celebratory symbols include a mat (Mkeka) on which other symbols are placed. The mat represents the foundation of community and family, while the other symbols represent the principles of Kwanzaa.\n\nSome of the other symbols of Kwanzaa include:\n\n* **Kinara**: A seven-branched candleholder that represents the seven principles of Kwanzaa.\n* **Mishumaa Saba**: Seven candles that are lit during the Kwanzaa celebration, each representing one of the seven principles.\n* **Kwanzaa Cloth**: A colorful cloth that is draped over the kinara and represents the unity and solidarity of the community.\n* **Kente Cloth**: A brightly colored cloth that represents the rich cultural heritage of Africa.\n\n**Observances**\n\nFamilies celebrating Kwanzaa decorate their households with objects of art, colorful African cloth, and fresh fruits that represent African idealism. It is customary to include children in Kwanzaa ceremonies and to give respect and gratitude to ancestors. Libations are shared, generally with a common chalice, Kikombe cha Umoja, passed around to all celebrants.\n\nNon-African Americans also celebrate Kwanzaa, and \"Joyous Kwanzaa\" may be used as a greeting during the holiday.\n\n**Karamu**\n\nA Karamu Ya Imani (Feast of Faith) is a feast that typically takes place on December 31, the sixth day of the Kwanzaa period. The Karamu feast was developed in Chicago during a 1971 citywide movement of Pan-African organizations. It was proposed by Hannibal Afrik of Shule ya Watoto as a communitywide promotional and educational campaign. The initial Karamu Ya Imani occurred on January 1, 1973, at a 200-person gathering at the Ridgeland club.\n\n**Adherence**\n\nThe popularity of celebration of Kwanzaa has declined with the waning of the popularity of the black separatist movement. Kwanzaa observation has declined in both community and commercial contexts. University of Minnesota Professor Keith Mayes did not report exact figures, noting that it is also difficult to determine these for the three other main African-American holidays, which he names as Martin Luther King Jr Day, Malcolm X Day, and Juneteenth. Mayes added that white institutions now also celebrate it.\n\n**Recognition**\n\nThe first Kwanzaa stamp, designed by Synthia Saint James, was issued by the United States Post Office in 1997, and in the same year Bill Clinton gave the first presidential declaration marking the holiday.

demos and covers, and released an album of demos, Pocketwatch, under the pseudonym Late! in 1992 [6]\n\n\nFormation and debut album (1994–1995)\nGrohl formed a band to support the album He spoke to Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic, about joining the group, but he decided against it Grohl said it would have felt \"really natural\" for them to work together, but would have been \"weird\" for the others and place more pressure on Grohl [12] Instead, Grohl recruited bassist Nate Mendel and drummer William Goldsmith, both of the recently disbanded Seattle group Sunny Day Real Estate Nirvana touring guitarist Pat Smear joined as the second guitarist [13] Grohl licensed the album to Capitol Records, releasing it on his new label, Roswell Records [6]\n\n\nThe Colour and the Shape (1996–1997)\nAfter touring through the spring of 1996, the Foo Fighters entered Bear Creek Studio in Woodinville, Washington, with producer Gil Norton to record its second album While Grohl once again wrote all the songs, the rest of the band collaborated on the arrangements With the sessions nearly complete, Grohl took the rough mixes to Los Angeles, intending to finish his vocal and guitar parts While there, Grohl realized that he was not happy with the drumming and replaced most of Goldsmith's drum tracks with his own [14] Though Grohl hoped that Goldsmith would still play on the tour, Goldsmith felt betrayed and left the band [15]\n\n\nThere Is Nothing Left to Lose (1998–2001)\nIn 1998, the Foo Fighters traveled to Grohl's home state of Virginia, to write their third album However, Grohl and Stahl were unable to co-operate as songwriters; Grohl told Kerrang! in 1999, \"in those few weeks it just seemed like the three of us were moving in one direction and Franz wasn't.\" Grohl was distraught over the decision to fire Stahl as the two had been friends since childhood Shortly after that, Mendel called Grohl to say he was quitting to reunite with Sunny Day Real Estate, only to reverse his decision the next day [18] The remaining trio of Grohl, Mendel, and Hawkins spent several months recording the band's third album, There Is Nothing Left to Lose, in Grohl's home studio The album spawned several singles, including \"Learn to Fly\", the band's first to reach the US Billboard Hot 100 Other singles included \"Stacked Actors\", \"Generator\", \"Next Year\", and \"Breakout\" [citation needed]\n\n\nOne by One (2001–2004)\nNear the end of 2001, the Foo Fighters reconvened to record their fourth album After spending four months in a Los Angeles studio, the album \"just didn't sound right\" and the band had no confidence it would sell well With the album not reaching their expectations amid much infighting, Grohl spent some time helping Queens of the Stone Age complete their 2002 album Songs for the Deaf Once that album was finished and touring had started for both the Foo Fighters and Queens of the Stone Age, the band was on the verge of breaking up entirely Grohl reunited with Hawkins, Shiflett, and Mendel to play the Coachella Festival, alternating days with Queens of the Stone Age Hawkins and Grohl talked about resuming work on One by One and after a very satisfying performance the following day, they agreed to stay together The group re-recorded nearly all of the album in a ten-day stretch at Grohl's home studio in Alexandria, Virginia, the following month [19] The original version of One by One, referred to by the band as Million Dollar Demos, has never been released in its entirety although seven tracks were leaked online in 2012 and 2015 [30]\n\n\nIn Your Honor (2005–2006)\nHaving spent a year and a half touring behind One by One, Grohl did not want to rush into recording another Foo Fighters record Initially Grohl intended to write acoustic material by himself but eventually the project involved the entire band [33] To record its fifth album, the band shifted to Los Angeles and built a recording studio, dubbed Studio 606 West Grohl insisted that the album be divided into two discs – one full of rock songs, and the other featuring all acoustic tracks [34] In Your Honor was released in June 2005 The album's singles included \"Best of You\", \"DOA\", \"Resolve\", and \"No Way Back/Cold Day in the Sun\".\n\n\nEchoes, Silence, Patience & Grace (2007–2009)\nFor the follow-up to In Your Honor, the band recruited The Colour and the Shape producer Gil Norton Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace was released on September 25, 2007 The album's first single, \"The Pretender\", was issued to radio in early August In mid-to-late 2007 \"The Pretender\" topped Billboard's Modern Rock chart for a record 19 weeks The second single, \"Long Road to Ruin\", was released in December 2007, supported by a music video directed by longtime collaborator Jesse Peretz (formerly of the Lemonheads) [36] Other singles included \"Let It Die\" and \"Cheer Up, Boys (Your Make Up Is Running)\".\n\n\nWasting Light (2010–2012)\nIn August 2010, the band began recording their seventh studio album with producer Butch Vig, who had previously produced the two new tracks for the band's Greatest Hits album [39] The album was recorded in Dave Grohl's garage using only analog equipment The album won five Grammys and was nominated for six The recording was analog to tape and used no computers, not even to mix or master [40] Vig said in an interview with MTV that the album was entirely analog until post-mastering [41] Pat Smear was present in many photos posted by Grohl on Twitter, and a press release in December confirmed Smear played on every track on the album and was considered an official member of the band once again [42]\n\n\nSonic Highways and Saint Cecilia EP (2013–2015)\nDespite initially announcing a break after supporting Wasting Light, Grohl stated in January 2013 that the band had started writing material for an eighth studio album [55] On February 20, 2013, at the Brit Awards, Grohl said he was resuming work on the album the following day [56]\n\n\nConcrete and Gold (2016–2019)\nIn response to growing rumors of a breakup, the Foo Fighters released a mockumentary video in March 2016 portraying Grohl leaving the band to pursue electronic music and Nick Lachey (formerly of 98 Degrees) becoming the group's new singer, ending with: \"For the millionth time, we're not breaking up And nobody's going fucking solo!\" [92]\n\n\nMedicine at Midnight and Studio 666 (2019–2022)\nIn October 2019, the band announced that they were recording their tenth studio album based on demos by Grohl [107] [108] In November 2019, the band began releasing a series of EPs under the umbrella name of the Foo Files, largely consisting of previously released B sides and live performances By February 2020, Grohl announced that the new album was complete [109] but by May, it was delayed indefinitely because of the COVID-19 pandemic, saying, \"We've kind of shelved it for now to figure out exactly when it's going to happen.\" [110]\n\n\nDeath of Hawkins and But Here We Are (2022–present)\nOn March 25, 2022, Hawkins died in his room at the Casa Medina hotel in Bogotá, Colombia [120] No cause of death was given [121] Hawkins had suffered chest pain, and had ten substances in his system at the time of his death, including opioids, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, and THC, the psychoactive compound in cannabis [122] [123] [124]\n\n\nMusical style and influences\nThe Foo Fighters have been described as alternative rock, [8] [135] [136] post-grunge, [137] [138] [139] hard rock, [140] [141] [142] grunge, [143] [144] power pop, [145] and pop rock [146] They were initially compared to Grohl's previous group, Nirvana Grohl acknowledged that Kurt Cobain was an influence on his songwriting: \"Through Kurt, I saw the beauty of minimalism and the importance of music that's stripped down.\" The Foo Fighters also used the technique of shifting between quiet verses and loud choruses, which Grohl said was influenced by the members of Nirvana \"liking The Knack, Bay City Rollers, Beatles, and ABBA as much as we liked Flipper and Black Flag, I suppose.\" [5] When comparing the legacies of the two bands, Pitchfork said the Foo Fighters' \"may not be anywhere near as glamorous or as era-defining as that of  [Nirvana], but in a way, it's much more difficult and thankless\" The publication would also call Grohl and the band \"excellent at being mainstream\" and being \"his generation's answer to Tom Petty—a consistent hit machine pumping out working-class

Grohl licensed the album to Capitol Records, releasing it on his new label, Roswell Records.\n\n### The Colour and the Shape (1996-1997)\n\nAfter touring through the spring of 1996, the Foo Fighters entered Bear Creek Studio in Woodinville, Washington, with producer Gil Norton to record its second album. While Grohl once again wrote all the songs, the rest of the band collaborated on the arrangements. With the sessions nearly complete, Grohl took the rough mixes to Los Angeles, intending to finish his vocal and guitar parts. While there, Grohl realized that he was not happy with the drumming and replaced most of Goldsmith's drum tracks with his own. Though Grohl hoped that Goldsmith would still play on the tour, Goldsmith felt betrayed and left the band.\n\n### There Is Nothing Left to Lose (1998-2001)\n\nIn 1998, the Foo Fighters traveled to Grohl's home state of Virginia to write their third album. However, Grohl and Stahl were unable to co-operate as songwriters; Grohl told Kerrang! in 1999, \"in those few weeks it just seemed like the three of us were moving in one direction and Franz wasn't.\" Grohl was distraught over the decision to fire Stahl as the two had been friends since childhood. Shortly after that, Mendel called Grohl to say he was quitting to reunite with Sunny Day Real Estate, only to reverse his decision the next day. The remaining trio of Grohl, Mendel, and Hawkins spent several months recording the band's third album, There Is Nothing Left to Lose, in Grohl's home studio. The album spawned several singles, including \"Learn to Fly\", the band's first to reach the US Billboard Hot 100.\n\n### One by One (2001-2004)\n\nNear the end of 2001, the Foo Fighters reconvened to record their fourth album. After spending four months in a Los Angeles studio, the album \"just didn't sound right\" and the band had no confidence it would sell well. With the album not reaching their expectations amid much infighting, Grohl spent some time helping Queens of the Stone Age complete their 2002 album Songs for the Deaf. Once that album was finished and touring had started for both the Foo Fighters and Queens of the Stone Age, the band was on the verge of breaking up entirely. Grohl reunited with Hawkins, Shiflett, and Mendel to play the Coachella Festival, alternating days with Queens of the Stone Age. Hawkins and Grohl talked about resuming work on One by One and after a very satisfying performance the following day, they agreed to stay together. The group re-recorded nearly all of the album in a ten-day stretch at Grohl's home studio in Alexandria, Virginia, the following month.\n\n### In Your Honor (2005-2006)\n\nHaving spent a year and a half touring behind One by One, Grohl did not want to rush into recording another Foo Fighters record. Initially Grohl intended to write acoustic material by himself, but eventually the project involved the entire band. To record its fifth album, the band shifted to Los Angeles and built a recording studio, dubbed Studio 606 West. Grohl insisted that the album be divided into two discs – one full of rock songs, and the other featuring all acoustic tracks. In Your Honor was released in June 2005. The album's singles included \"Best of You\", \"DOA\", \"Resolve\", and \"No Way Back/Cold Day in the Sun\".\n\n### Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace (2007-2009)\n\nFor the follow-up to In Your Honor, the band recruited The Colour and the Shape producer Gil Norton. Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace was released on September 25, 2007. The album's first single, \"The Pretender\", was issued to radio in early August. In mid-to-late 2007 \"The Pretender\" topped Billboard's Modern Rock chart for a record 19 weeks. The second single, \"Long Road to Ruin\", was released in December 2007, supported by a music video directed by longtime collaborator Jesse Peretz.\n\n### Wasting Light (2010-2012)\n\nIn August 2010, the band began recording their seventh studio album with producer Butch Vig, who had previously produced the two new tracks for the band's Greatest Hits album. The album was recorded in Dave Grohl's garage using only analog equipment. The album won five Grammys and was nominated for six. The recording was analog to tape and used no computers, not even to mix or master.\n\n### Sonic Highways and Saint Cecilia EP (2013-2015)\n\nDespite initially announcing a break after supporting Wasting Light, Grohl stated in January 2013 that the band had started writing material for an eighth studio album. On February 20, 2013, at the Brit Awards, Grohl said he was resuming work on the album the following day.\n\n### Concrete and Gold (2016-2019)\n\nIn response to growing rumors of a breakup, the Foo Fighters released a mockumentary video in March 2016 portraying Grohl leaving the band to pursue electronic music and Nick Lachey (formerly of 98 Degrees) becoming the group's new singer, ending with: \"For the millionth time, we're not breaking up And nobody's going fucking solo!\"\n\n### Medicine at Midnight and Studio 666 (2019-2022)\n\nIn October 2019, the band announced that they were recording their tenth studio album based on demos by Grohl. In November 2019, the band began releasing a series of EPs under the umbrella name of the Foo Files, largely consisting of previously released B sides and live performances.\n\n## Musical Style and Influences\n\nThe Foo Fighters have been described as alternative rock, post-grunge, hard rock, grunge, power pop, and pop rock. They were initially compared to Grohl's previous group, Nirvana. Grohl acknowledged that Kurt Cobain was an influence on his songwriting: \"Through Kurt, I saw the beauty of minimalism and the importance of music that's stripped down.\" The Foo Fighters also used the technique of shifting between quiet verses and loud choruses, which Grohl said was influenced by the members of Nirvana \"liking The Knack, Bay City Rollers, Beatles, and ABBA as much as we liked Flipper and Black Flag, I suppose.\"\n\n## Band Members\n\n### Current Members\n\n* Dave Grohl – lead vocals, guitar\n* Nate Mendel – bass guitar\n* Taylor Hawkins – drums, percussion, backing vocals (1997–2022)\n* Chris Shiflett – lead guitar, backing vocals (1999–2022)\n* Rami Jaffee – keyboards, piano (1999–2022)\n* Pat Smear – rhythm guitar (1995–1997, 2010–2022)\n\n## Timeline\n\n### Studio Albums\n\n1.

After the indictment was issued, Holmes resigned as CEO of Theranos but remained chairwoman of its board of directors.\n\n**Promotional Activities**\n\nHolmes partnered with Carlos Slim in June 2015 to improve blood testing in Mexico. In October 2015, she announced #IronSisters to help women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics careers. In 2015, she helped to draft and pass a law in Arizona to let people obtain and pay for lab tests without requiring insurance or healthcare provider approval, while misrepresenting the accuracy and effectiveness of the Theranos device.\n\n**Connections**\n\nTheranos's board and investors included many influential figures. Holmes's first major investor was Tim Draper – Silicon Valley venture capitalist and father of Holmes's childhood friend Jesse Draper – who \"cut Holmes a check\" for $1 million upon hearing her initial pitch for the firm that would become Theranos. Theranos's pool of major investors expanded to include Rupert Murdoch, the Walton family, the DeVos family including Betsy DeVos, the Cox family of Cox Enterprises, and Carlos Slim Helú. Each of these investors lost tens to hundreds of millions of dollars when Theranos folded.\n\n**Recognition and Public Image**\n\nBefore the collapse of Theranos, Holmes received widespread acclaim. In 2015, she was appointed a member of the Harvard Medical School Board of Fellows and was named one of Time magazine's \"Time 100 most influential people.\" Holmes received the Under 30 Doers Award from Forbes and was ranked number 73 in its 2015 list of \"the world's most powerful women.\" She was also named Woman of the Year by Glamour and received an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Pepperdine University.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nHolmes was romantically involved with the Pakistani-born technology entrepreneur Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani, who immigrated to India and then the US. She met him in 2002 during a trip to Beijing as part of Stanford University's Mandarin program. Holmes was 18 at the time and had just graduated from high school; Balwani is 19 years older than Holmes and was married to another woman at the time.\n\n**In the Media**\n\nThe case of Holmes is said to have created a stigma for other female entrepreneurs, particularly in the sciences and health care industries, who are often compared to her. Writing in The New York Times, technology journalist Erin Griffith commented that \"Holmes continues to loom large across the start-up world because of the audacity of her story, which has permeated popular culture,\" with female entrepreneurs reporting that \"the frequent comparisons to Holmes are pernicious.\" Holmes has also been featured in a number of media works, including books, articles, and documentaries.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Elizabeth_Holmes\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nElizabeth Holmes was born on February 3, 1984, in Washington, D.C [12] Her father, Christian Rasmus Holmes IV, was a vice president at Enron, an energy company that later went bankrupt after an accounting fraud scandal Her mother, Noel Anne (née Daoust), worked as a Congressional committee staffer [13] [12] Christian later held executive positions in government agencies such as USAID, the EPA, and USTDA [14] [15] Holmes is partly of Danish ancestry One of her paternal great-great-great-grandfathers was Charles Louis Fleischmann, a Hungarian immigrant who founded Fleischmann's Yeast Company [16] The Holmes family \"was very proud of its yeast empire\" history, according to a family friend Joseph Fuisz, \"I think the parents very much yearned for the days of yore when the family was one of the richest in America And I think Elizabeth channeled that, and at a young age.\" [17]\n\n\nTheranos\nIn 2003, Holmes founded the company Real-Time Cures in Palo Alto, California, to \"democratize healthcare\" [20] [27] [28] [29] Holmes described her fear of needles as a motivation and sought to perform blood tests using only small amounts of blood [15] [27] When Holmes pitched the idea to reap \"vast amounts of data from a few droplets of blood derived from the tip of a finger\" to her medicine professor Phyllis Gardner at Stanford, Gardner responded, \"I don't think your idea is going to work\", explaining it was impossible to do what Holmes was claiming could be done Several other expert medical professors told Holmes the same thing [15] However, Holmes did not relent, and she succeeded in getting her advisor and dean at the School of Engineering, Channing Robertson, to back her idea [15] In 2003, Holmes renamed the company Theranos (a portmanteau of \"therapy\" and \"diagnosis\") [30] [31] The company's original name was changed after deciding that too many people were skeptical of the word \"cure\" [32] Robertson became the company's first board member and introduced Holmes to venture capitalists [13]\n\n\nFounding\nIn 2003, Holmes founded the company Real-Time Cures in Palo Alto, California, to \"democratize healthcare\" [20] [27] [28] [29] Holmes described her fear of needles as a motivation and sought to perform blood tests using only small amounts of blood [15] [27] When Holmes pitched the idea to reap \"vast amounts of data from a few droplets of blood derived from the tip of a finger\" to her medicine professor Phyllis Gardner at Stanford, Gardner responded, \"I don't think your idea is going to work\", explaining it was impossible to do what Holmes was claiming could be done Several other expert medical professors told Holmes the same thing [15] However, Holmes did not relent, and she succeeded in getting her advisor and dean at the School of Engineering, Channing Robertson, to back her idea [15] In 2003, Holmes renamed the company Theranos (a portmanteau of \"therapy\" and \"diagnosis\") [30] [31] The company's original name was changed after deciding that too many people were skeptical of the word \"cure\" [32] Robertson became the company's first board member and introduced Holmes to venture capitalists [13]\n\n\nFunding and expansion\nBy December 2004, Holmes had raised $6 million to fund the firm [13] By the end of 2010, Theranos had more than $92 million in venture capital [23] In July 2011, Holmes was introduced to former secretary of state George Shultz After a two-hour meeting, he joined the Theranos board of directors [33] Holmes was recognized for forming \"the most illustrious board in U.S corporate history\" over the next three years [34]\n\n\nDownfall\nJohn Carreyrou of The Wall Street Journal initiated a secret, months-long investigation of Theranos after he received a tip from a medical expert who thought that Theranos's Edison blood testing device seemed suspicious Carreyrou spoke to ex-employee whistleblowers and obtained company documents When Holmes learned of the investigation, she initiated a campaign through her lawyer David Boies to stop Carreyrou from publishing, which included legal and financial threats against both the Journal and the whistleblowers [41] [42]\n\n\nU.S. v.

She was born in Bismarck, North Dakota, and raised in Lovingston in Nelson County, Virginia. Bibb's early life and career have been marked by various successes and challenges, which have contributed to her growth as an artist.\n\n# Early Life\n\nBibb was born in 1974, and her father passed away three years after her birth. She and her mother, along with three older sisters, moved to Richmond, Virginia, where Bibb attended the all-girls Catholic private school Saint Gertrude High School. This educational background likely played a significant role in shaping Bibb's personality and interests.\n\n# Career\n\nBibb's entry into the entertainment industry was sparked by a nationwide modeling search held by The Oprah Winfrey Show and the Elite Agency. The search, which took place in 1990 when Bibb was just 16 years old, featured celebrity judges John Casablancas, Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, and Iman. Bibb's winning the competition marked the beginning of her modeling career.\n\n## Modeling\n\nBibb's modeling career has been marked by various successes and challenges. At the height of her modeling career, she appeared on the covers of numerous fashion magazines, including Seventeen and Teen Vogue. Her modeling experience likely helped her develop the skills and confidence she needed to transition into acting.\n\n## Acting\n\nBibb made her television debut in 1996, appearing in episodes of Pacific Blue and Home Improvement. Her first film role came in the Howard Stern comedy Private Parts, which was released in 1997. This was followed by her first television series, where she replaced the departed Susan Walters as the female lead in the second season of The Big Easy. Although the show received mixed reviews, it provided Bibb with valuable experience and exposure.\n\nBibb's subsequent film roles include the romantic drama Touch Me, released in 1997, and the psychological thriller The Skulls, released in 2000. Her performance in The Skulls received widespread attention, despite the film's negative reception from critics. The film's box-office success, however, provided Bibb with a significant boost in her career.\n\n## Television and Film Breakthrough\n\nBibb's breakthrough role came in 1999 when she was cast as Brooke McQueen, the lead character in the WB Network television series Popular. The show was a major success among teenagers, and Bibb's performance earned her a Teen Choice Award for Television Choice Actress and a Young Hollywood Award nomination for Exciting New Face – Female.\n\nBibb's success in Popular led to more recognizable film roles, including the comedy See Spot Run, released in 2001. In the film, she played a single mother who embarks on a series of misadventures, reminiscent of the comedy Planes, Trains and Automobiles.\n\n# Other Projects\n\nBibb is a supporter of Friends of El Faro, a grassroots non-profit organization that helps raise money for Casa Hogar Sion, an orphanage in Tijuana, Mexico. This charitable work reflects Bibb's commitment to giving back to the community and supporting causes that are close to her heart.\n\n# Personal Life\n\nBibb married investment banker Rob Born on November 22, 2003, in Zihuatanejo, Mexico. The couple's marriage was short-lived, as they divorced on December 7, 2004.\n\n# Filmography\n\n## Film\n\n* Private Parts (1997)\n* Touch Me (1997)\n* This Space Between Us (1999)\n* The Skulls (2000)\n* See Spot Run (2001)\n\n## Television\n\n* Pacific Blue (1996)\n* Home Improvement (1996)\n* The Big Easy (1997)\n* Popular (1999-2001)\n* Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (2002)\n* Bionic Woman (2007)\n* Iron Man (2008)\n\n## Web\n\n* The 6th Floor (2015)\n* Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt (2015-2017)\n* The Good Place (2017-2019)\n* The Conners (2020)\n\n# References\n\n# External Links\n\n* Leslie Bibb at IMDb\n* Leslie Bibb at AllMovie\n* Leslie Bibb at Rotten Tomatoes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Leslie_Bibb\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nBibb was born in Bismarck, North Dakota, and raised in Lovingston in Nelson County, Virginia [6] Her father died three years after she was born [1] Bibb subsequently moved to Richmond, Virginia, with her mother and three older sisters, where she attended the all-girls Catholic private school Saint Gertrude High School [1]\n\n\nCareer\nIn 1990, when Bibb was sixteen years old, The Oprah Winfrey Show and the Elite Agency held a nationwide modeling search The celebrity judges – John Casablancas, Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, and Iman – chose Bibb as the winner [7]\n\n\nModeling\nIn 1990, when Bibb was sixteen years old, The Oprah Winfrey Show and the Elite Agency held a nationwide modeling search The celebrity judges – John Casablancas, Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, and Iman – chose Bibb as the winner [7]\n\n\nActing\nBibb first appeared on television in 1996, playing in episodes of Pacific Blue and Home Improvement Her first film role came in the Howard Stern comedy Private Parts This was followed by her first television series, where she replaced the departed Susan Walters as the female lead in the second season of The Big Easy Most critics panned the show, and it was canceled months later after low ratings She appeared in the romantic drama Touch Me (1997) and had a supporting role in the film This Space Between Us (1999) In 1999, Bibb had her big break appearing as a lead character on the WB Network television series Popular Her role was Brooke McQueen, the most popular girl at Kennedy High School who is beautiful, a straight-A student, and a cheerleader The show was a major success among teenagers and led Bibb to more recognizable film roles The show garnered her a Teen Choice Award for Television Choice Actress and a Young Hollywood Award nomination for Exciting New Face – Female During the series, she filmed the psychological thriller The Skulls (1999), as the classmate, friend and love interest of one of the main characters The Skulls received a negative reception from critics but was a box-office success She received a role in the 2001 comedy See Spot Run, playing a single mother who spends most of the film on her own Planes, Trains and Automobiles–style adventure [9]\n\n\nOther projects\nBibb is a supporter of Friends of El Faro, a grassroots non-profit organization that helps raise money for Casa Hogar Sion, an orphanage in Tijuana, Mexico.\n\n\nPersonal life\nBibb married investment banker Rob Born on November 22, 2003, in Zihuatanejo, Mexico They divorced on December 7, 2004 [citation needed]\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nWeb\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "United_States_invasion_of_Afghanistan", "content": "\nBackground\nIn 2001, Afghanistan had been at war for over 20 years [14] The communist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) seized power in 1978, and its policies sparked a popular uprising [15] The Soviet Union, sensing PDPA weakness, intervened in 1979 to support the regime [16]  The Soviet entry into Afghanistan prompted its Cold War rivals, especially the United States and Saudi Arabia, to support rebels fighting against the Soviet-backed PDPA [17] While the secular and socialist government controlled the cities, religiously motivated [18] mujahidin held sway in much of the countryside [19] The most important mujahidin commander was Ahmad Shah Massoud, who led the well-organized Tajik forces [20] The American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) worked closely with Pakistan's Inter-Service Intelligence (ISI) to funnel foreign support for the mujahidin [21] The war also attracted Arab volunteers, known as \"Afghan Arabs\", [22] including Osama bin Laden [23]\n\n\nTaliban vs. Northern Alliance (1996–2001)\nIn 1996, with military support from Pakistan and financial support from Saudi Arabia, the Taliban seized Kabul and founded the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan [27] They imposed their fundamentalist interpretation of Islam in areas under their control, issuing edicts forbidding women to work outside the home or attend school and requiring them to abide by harsh rules on veiling and seclusion [28]\n\n\nAl-Qaeda\nAfter nearly five years of shelter, bin Laden was expelled from Sudan in 1996 and arrived in Jalalabad, Afghanistan [34] He had founded al-Qaeda in the late 1980s to continue jihad after the end of the Soviet–Afghan War [35] He moved al-Qaeda's operations to eastern Afghanistan and developed a close relationship with the Taliban [36] However some key Taliban members, such as the foreign minister Wakil Muttawakil, disapproved of the alliance with al-Qaeda because bin Laden's terrorist activities were complicating the Taliban's quest for international recognition of their government [37] In 2000, Muhammad Umar visited bin Laden and forbade him from attacking the United States while he was a guest of the Taliban [38]  During the 1990s, the CIA and Delta Force [39] planned several operations to kill or capture bin Laden, but President Bill Clinton never ordered them to proceed [40]\n\n\nChange in U.S. policy towards Afghanistan\nDuring the early years of the Clinton administration, the US had no clear policy toward Afghanistan [41] The 1998 US embassy bombings, however, masterminded by al-Qaeda, provoked President Clinton to order missile strikes on militant training camps in Afghanistan; [42] bin Laden was indicted for his involvement in the bombings In 1999 both the US and the United Nations enacted sanctions against the Taliban in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1267, which demanded the Taliban surrender bin Laden for trial in the US and close all terrorist bases in Afghanistan [43] At the time, the only collaboration between Massoud and the US was an effort with the CIA to trace bin Laden [44] The US provided no support for Massoud's fight against the Taliban [45]\n\n\nMilitary situation on the eve of the 9/11 attacks\nOn 9 September 2001, two al-Qaeda members posing as journalists killed Massoud by detonating a bomb hidden in their video camera battery belt during an interview [48] Mohammed Fahim became the new leader of the Northern Alliance [49] The Alliance had 15,000–20,000 fighters distributed across five locations [9] On the Kabul front, Taliban and Northern Alliance forces faced each other from trenches across the Shomali Plain [9] The Takhar front extended from the Tajikistan border in the north to Parwan in the south, near Kabul  Dostum's forces were located south of Mazar-i-Sharif, the Hazaras under Muhammad Mohaqiq were in the central Hazarajat region, [50] and Ismail Khan was near Herat [6]\n\n\nPrelude to the invasion\nOn the morning of 11 September 2001, al-Qaeda carried out four coordinated attacks on the United States, employing four hijacked jet airliners [60] The attacks killed almost 3,000 people and injured more than 6,000 others [60] By the early afternoon of 11 September, the CIA had confirmed that al-Qaeda was responsible for the attack [61] The Taliban condemned the attacks, [62] but Umar issued a statement denying bin Laden's involvement [63] Although bin Laden eventually took responsibility for the 9/11 attacks in 2004, [64] he initially denied having any involvement [65] One of bin Laden's strategic goals was to draw the US into a costly war in Afghanistan, so it could be defeated just as the USSR had been [60]\n\n\nDiplomatic and political activity\nOn the evening of 11 September, President Bush stated the US would respond to the attacks and would \"make no distinction between those who planned these acts and those who harbor them.\" [66] On 14 September 2001, Congress passed legislation titled Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists, authorizing military force against al-Qaeda and its supporters [67] President Bush addressed Congress on 20 September and demanded the Taliban deliver bin Laden and al-Qaeda or face war [62]\n\n\nPlanning\nIn 2001, the Defense Department did not have a pre-existing plan for an invasion of Afghanistan [80] Therefore, the plan approved by Bush was devised by the CIA, reusing elements of the agency's previous contingency plans for collaboration with the Northern Alliance against the Taliban [81] Bush met with his cabinet at Camp David on 15 September for a war planning session [82] The military presented three options for military action in Afghanistan: The first was a cruise missile strike, the second was a combined cruise missile and bombing campaign lasting 3–10 days, and the third called for cruise missile and bomber strikes as well as ground forces operating inside Afghanistan [83] The CIA also presented its war plan, which involved inserting paramilitary teams to work with the Northern Alliance and, eventually, American Special Forces units [84] The planners wanted to minimize the use of American ground forces, to avoid provoking the Afghan population as the British and Russians had done [85] On 17 September Bush approved the CIA's plan and directed the military to develop a detailed war plan based on the third option from Camp David [86] Planning efforts were hindered because the Taliban had little physical infrastructure for the military to target [87] Early plans by the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) included poisoning the Afghan food supply and raiding a fertilizer factory that JSOC believed could be used to make chemical weapons [88]\n\n\nHumanitarian situation in Afghanistan\nAt the time of the invasion, the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan was dire, and the attacks in the United States caused thousands of Afghans to attempt to flee fearing potential U.S military action - this on top of millions that were already refugees in regional countries due to the continuous conflict already in place for 22 years [94] Food stock was running critically low and almost all aid workers had left the country after the attacks [95] Barry Bearak in a New York Times article described Afghanistan as a \"post-apocalyptic place of felled cities, parched land and downtrodden people.\" [94] Seventy percent of the population was undernourished in 2001, and the life expectancy was ranked two places from bottom in the world [96]\n\n\nOverthrow of the Taliban\nThe invasion consisted of American, British, Canadian, and Australian forces, with other countries providing logistical support [99] General Tommy Franks of US Central Command (CENTCOM) was the overall commander for Operation Enduring Freedom He led four task forces: the Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force (CJSOTF), Combined Joint Task Force Mountain (CJTF-Mountain), the Joint Interagency Task Force-Counterterrorism (JIATF-CT), and the Coalition Joint Civil-Military Operations Task Force (CJCMOTF) [100]\n\n\nCommand structure\nThe invasion consisted of American, British, Canadian, and Australian forces, with other countries providing logistical support [99] General Tommy Franks of US Central Command (CENTCOM) was the overall commander for Operation Enduring Freedom He led four task forces: the Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force (CJSOTF), Combined Joint Task Force Mountain (CJTF-Mountain), the Joint Interagency Task Force-Counterterrorism (JIATF-CT), and the Coalition Joint Civil-Military Operations Task Force (CJCMOTF) [100]\n\n\nFirst move\nOn 26 September, fifteen days after 9/11, the US covertly inserted (via CIA-piloted Mi-17 helicopter) [104] 10 [b] members of the CIA into the Panjshir Valley, Massoud's stronghold [107] The CIA mission was led by Gary Schroen and designated the Northern Afghanistan Liaison Team, known by the call-sign 'Jawbreaker' [108] In addition to specialized human assets, the team brought a metal case containing $3 million in $100 bills to buy support [104] Jawbreaker linked up with General Mohammed Fahim, commander of the Northern Alliance forces in the Panjshir Valley, and prepared the way for introduction of Army Special Forces [109] The Jawbreaker team brought satellite communications equipment, enabling its intelligence reports to be instantly available to CIA headquarters The team also assessed potential targets for Operation Crescent Wind, provided in-extremis combat search and rescue (CSAR), and could provide bomb damage assessment for the air campaign [110] To allow fixed-wing aircraft to land in the area, the team refurbished an airstrip at Gulbahar built by the British in 1919 [111]\n\n\nInitial air strikes\nOn 7 October, the US began military operations in Afghanistan with air strikes on 31 targets across the country [114]  Most of the Taliban's outdated SA-2 and SA-3 surface-to-air missiles, small fleet of MIG-21s and Su-22s, and radar and command units were destroyed on the first night [115] On the same night the CIA conducted the first-ever air strike with a Predator drone [116] The Predator was loitering over Muhammad Umar's house and followed several men who left the house [117] CIA analysts believed that Umar was in the group, which drove first to the house of Umar's mother and then to a school west of Kandahar [118] The men stayed in the school for several hours and the CIA requested that the Air Force strike the school with a conventional bomb, but Franks denied the request, citing the risk of collateral damage and uncertainty over whether Umar was really there [119] The CIA fired the Predator's Hellfire missile at a truck outside to draw the men out; the men left the school, and Umar escaped [120] Predator drones had been in development since the early 1990s, had been used to search for bin Laden since 2000, and had even been proposed as a means of assassinating bin Laden before 9/11 [121] The employment of armed Predators in Afghanistan marked the start of a new era of drone warfare [122]\n\n\nOperation Rhino and Objective Gecko\nOn the night of 19 October, simultaneous with the Special Forces entering the country, 200 Rangers from the 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, parachuted onto Objective Rhino—a landing strip south of Kandahar [126] The landing strip had been built as part of an Emirati hunting camp [127] Before the Rangers dropped, B-2 Spirit stealth bombers and AC-130 gunships bombed and strafed the site, [126] with initial reports of eleven enemy killed and nine fleeing; upon reaching the ground the Rangers located and killed one Taliban fighter [128] [129] The Rangers provided security while a forward arming and refuelling point (FARP) was established using fuel bladders from MC-130s, to refuel aircraft flying to the next objective [126] The mission was filmed by combat cameramen and a P-3C Orion observation plane flying overhead [130] No US casualties were suffered in the operation itself (two Rangers received minor injuries in the jump), [130] but two Rangers assigned to a CSAR element supporting the mission were killed when their MH-60L helicopter crashed at a temporary staging site in Dalbandin, Pakistan, due to a brownout [131]\n\n\nContinued air strikes\nThe Green Berets of ODA 595 split into two elements, Alpha and Bravo Alpha rode on horseback with General Dostum to his headquarters to plan an assault on Mazar-i-Sharif Bravo was tasked with clearing the Darya Suf Valley of Taliban and to travel into the Alma Tak Mountains to conduct reconnaissance [137] Dostum and General Atta Muhammad Nur had been fighting the Taliban in the Darya Suf Valley throughout the summer and had gradually lost ground [138] The valley ran north to south and Dostum had established his headquarters near the village of Dehi—60 miles south of Mazar-i-Sharif—because the rugged terrain prevented Taliban tanks from moving that far into the valley [139]\n\n\nFall of Mazar-i-Sharif\nMazar-i-Sharif was important as the home of the sacred Muslim site of the Shrine of Ali, and as a transportation hub, with two major airports and a bridge into Uzbekistan [154] Taking the city would enable humanitarian aid to alleviate a looming food crisis, which threatened more than six million people with starvation Many of those in most urgent need lived in rural areas to the south and west of Mazar-i-Sharif Dostum and Atta fought their way up the Balkh Valley and on 8 November reached the Tanghi Pass, the gateway between the valley and Mazar-i-Sharif [155] [156] The pass was heavily defended, but the Northern Alliance seized it on 9 November, [156] triggering a Taliban retreat from Mazar-i-Sharif [157] The Northern Alliance entered the city on 10 November [158]\n\n\nFall of Kabul\nOn 12 November, the US tracked and killed al-Qaeda's number three, Muhammad Atif, with an air strike in Kabul [163] That day the Taliban abandoned Kabul and decided to regroup in Jalalabad and Kandahar [164] Taliban forces evacuated by the end of 13 November, [164] and Northern Alliance forces (supported by ODA 555) [165] arrived took control of the city the following afternoon [166] During their retreat, the Taliban took the Shelter Now prisoners with them, but abandoned them in a prison in Ghazni on 13 November [167] Anti-Taliban Afghans freed the prisoners, who had found a satellite phone and used it to call the American embassy in Pakistan [167] SEAL Team Six used Chinook helicopters to extract the prisoners from Ghazni on the night of 14 November and take them to Pakistan [168]\n\n\nObjective Wolverine, Objective Raptor, and Operation Relentless Strike\nOn 13 November, the 75th Ranger Regiment carried out its second combat parachute drop into Afghanistan [171] A platoon-sized Ranger security element, including a team from the Ranger Reconnaissance Detachment and accompanied by eight Air Force Special Tactical operators, parachuted into a dry lake bed southwest of Kandahar and secured the area [172] A pair of MC-130 cargo planes then landed in the lake bed and deposited four AH-6J Little Bird helicopters from the 160th SOAR [173] The Little Birds flew to a Taliban compound near Kandahar codenamed Objective Wolverine and destroyed it [174] They returned to the lake bed to rearm and refuel, then launched another strike against a second site called Objective Raptor [175] After the second strike they went back to the lake bed, loaded onto the MC-130s and flew back to Oman [175] A series of missions codenamed Operation Relentless Strike began on 16 November On the first night, the Rangers drove modified HMMWVs and Land Rovers to secure a remote desert airstrip [176] The Little Birds then flew in on MC-130s and conducted a search and destroy mission along Highway 1 [177]  The Little Birds conducted similar search and destroy missions over the next several nights [178]\n\n\nBattle of Tarinkot\nOn 14 November, ODA 574 and Hamid Karzai inserted into Uruzgan Province via 4 MH-60K helicopters [165] with a small force of guerrillas [179] Karzai was the leader of the Pashtun Popalzai tribe and had been an enemy of the Taliban since they assassinated his father in 1999 [142] He had entered Afghanistan with three other men on 9 October, but was almost killed by the Taliban, and was extracted by the CIA on 4 November [179] Once he returned he began to move towards the town of Tarinkot Responding to the approach of Karzai's forces, the inhabitants of the town of Tarinkot revolted and expelled their Taliban administrators [180] Karzai traveled to Tarinkot to meet with the town elders [180] While he was there, the Taliban marshaled a force of 300–500 men to retake the town [179] Karzai's small force, plus the American contingent, deployed in the town's front to block the Taliban's advance Relying heavily on close air support, the American and Afghan force managed to drive the Taliban away from the town [181]\n\n\nSiege of Kunduz and alleged Pakistani airlift\nTask Force Dagger's attention focused on the last northern Taliban stronghold, Kunduz [165] As the bombardment at Tora Bora grew, the Siege of Kunduz continued General Daoud and ODA 586 had initiated massive coalition airstrikes to demoralize the Taliban defenders [165] After 11 days of fighting and bombardment, Taliban fighters surrendered to Northern Alliance forces on 23 November Shortly before the surrender, Pakistani aircraft arrived to evacuate intelligence and military personnel who had been aiding the Taliban's fight against the Northern Alliance, including Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders [185] The details of the airlift are disputed Investigative reporter Seymour Hersh alleged that up to five thousand people were evacuated, [186] while Karzai stated that, \"even the Americans did not know who got away.\" [187] The United States government denied that the airlift occurred, with Secretary Rumsfeld saying, \"neither Pakistan nor any other country flew any planes into Afghanistan to evacuate anybody.\" [187]\n\n\nOperation Trent\nThe British Special Air Service (SAS) played a small role in the early stages of the war because American SOF commanders guarded targets for their own units It took political intercession from Prime Minister Tony Blair for the SAS to be given a direct-action task – the destruction of an al-Qaeda-linked opium production facility The facility was located 400 km (250 mi) southwest of Kandahar and defended by between 80 and 100 foreign fighters, with a defense of trench lines and several makeshift bunkers The SAS were ordered to assault the facility in full daylight because CENTCOM would not provide air support for a night raid The timing meant that the squadrons could not carry out a detailed reconnaissance prior to the assault Despite these factors, the commanding officer of 22 SAS accepted the mission The target was a low priority for the US and probably would have been destroyed from the air if the British had not argued for a larger role in Afghanistan [188]\n\n\nBattle of Qala-i-Jangi\nOn 25 November, as Taliban prisoners were moved into Qala-i-Jangi fortress near Mazar-i-Sharif, a few Taliban attacked their Northern Alliance guards This incident triggered a revolt by 600 prisoners, who soon seized the southern half of the fortress, including an armory stocked with AK-47s, RPGs and crew-served weapons Johnny Micheal Spann, one of two CIA SAD operatives at the fortress who had been interrogating prisoners, was killed, marking America's first combat death [192]\n\n\nConsolidation: the fall of Kandahar\nODA 574 and Hamid Karzai began moving on Kandahar, gathering fighters from friendly local Pashtun tribes At the strategic Sayd-Aum-Kalay Bridge they fought for two days with the Taliban, eventually seizing it with the help of US airpower, opening the road to Kandahar [183]\n\n\nBattle of Tora Bora: Osama bin Laden escapes to Pakistan\nAfter the fall of Kabul and Kandahar, suspected al-Qaeda members, including bin Laden and other key leaders, withdrew to Jalalabad, Nangarhar Province From there they moved into the Tora Bora region of the Spin Ghar (White Mountains), 20 km away from the Pakistan border, which had a network of caves and prepared defenses used by the mujahidin during the Soviet–Afghan War [206] Signal intercepts and interrogation of captured Taliban fighters and al-Qaeda terrorists pointed towards the presence of significant numbers of foreign fighters and possible senior leaders in the area [207] Instead of committing conventional forces, both the White House and the Pentagon decided to isolate and destroy al-Qaeda elements in the area with the US SOF supporting locally recruited Afghan militias, due to a fear of repeating the Soviet's experience in the area [208]\n\n\nInter-Afghan political settlement\nIn late November 2001, the United Nations hosted the Bonn Conference; [228] the Taliban were excluded, [229] while three Afghan opposition groups participated [230] Observers included representatives of neighboring and other involved major countries [228] The resulting Bonn Agreement created the Afghan Interim Authority and outlined the Bonn Process that would lead towards a new constitution and a new Afghan government [229] Following the Bonn Conference, tribal leaders and former exiles established an interim government in Kabul under Hamid Karzai [231]\n\n\nCasualties and war crimes\nThe Costs of War Project at Brown University estimated that between 1,537 and 2,375 civilians were killed during the invasion [13] Northern Alliance casualties are unknown [11] United States casualties were 12 military personnel and one CIA officer (Mike Spann), [10] while the Taliban suffered 8,000 to 12,000 killed [12] According to Human Rights Watch, during the invasion the Northern Alliance \"carried out systematic attacks on Pashtun villages, raping women, summarily executing civilians, and stealing livestock and land.\" [232]\n\n\nLogistics\nA landlocked country with forbidding terrain and a harsh climate, Afghanistan presents major difficulties for military operations Prior to the war, the United States had no military bases in Central or South Asia The initial CIA Jawbreaker team entered Afghanistan by helicopter from Tashkent, Uzbekistan, stopping to refuel in Dushanbe, Tajikistan [233] The US established its main base at Karshi-Khanabad Air Base (known as K2) in Uzbekistan [234] Personnel and equipment were flown from the large American bases in Germany to K2 and then to Afghanistan [235] Pakistan granted the use of Shahbaz Air Base in Jacobabad as an auxiliary base, [236] and the CIA flew Predator drones from both Jacobabad and Shamsi Airfield [237] Masirah Island off the coast of Oman served as the headquarters of Joint Special Operations Command, [238] while the aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk in the Indian Ocean was used as a platform for helicopters of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment to fly special operations personnel into southern Afghanistan [239] Some B-52 bombers flew into Afghanistan from the island of Diego Garcia, and B-2 bombers flew nonstop from Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri to Afghanistan [239]\n\n\nAnalysis\nAccording to historian Carter Malkasian, the campaign was a \"striking military success\" [8] The United States achieved its war aims while committing a force of only 110 CIA officers, 350 special operators, and 5,000 Rangers and Marines [8] The model of special forces working with local fighters and calling in precision air strikes was heavily used by the US during later operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria [8] One explanation for the rapid victory is that in Afghan culture, fighters tend to defect to the winning side once its victory is seen as inevitable; [240] as anthropologist Thomas Barfield puts it, \"Just as the Taliban had come to power by persuading people that they were winners without fighting and buying the defection of wavering commanders with suitcases full of hundred-dollar bills, they lost the war in a reverse process.\" [241] The pattern recurred during the 2021 Taliban offensive, when the US-backed government collapsed and a resurgent Taliban captured a dozen provincial capitals in a week before it entered Kabul unopposed [242]\n\n\nLegality and international law\nScholars have disputed the legality of the invasion under international law The US and its allies argued that the invasion was an act of self defense, which is legal according to Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations [243] The US sent a letter to the Security Council on 7 October stating that, \"Afghanistan was harboring terrorists who attacked the United States, that further attacks might be anticipated, and that military action was needed to deter them.\" [244] Legal scholar John Quigley has argued that the invasion was illegal because al-Qaeda, not Afghanistan, was the perpetrator of the 9/11 attacks, and because there was no evidence that further terrorist attacks were imminent [245] Sean Murphy made the opposite case, that Afghanistan was responsible for the actions of al-Qaeda because it allowed al-Qaeda to operate from its territory and refused to extradite al-Qaeda operatives [246] The debate continued with the 2009 publication of Myra Williamson's Terrorism, War and International Law: The Legality of the Use of Force Against Afghanistan in 2001 [247] Williamson analyzed the legal questions raised by state responses to terrorism and the implications of the Afghanistan precedent for later conflicts such as the 2003 United States invasion of Iraq and the 2006 Israeli invasion of Lebanon [248]\n\n\nReactions and aftermath\nIn October 2001 when the invasion began, polls indicated that about 88% of Americans and about 65% of Britons backed military action [249] An Ipsos-Reid poll conducted between November and December 2001 showed that majorities in Canada (66%), France (60%), Germany (60%), Italy (58%), and the UK (65%) approved of US airstrikes while majorities in Argentina (77%), China (52%), South Korea (50%), Spain (52%), and Turkey (70%) opposed them [250] There were a number of protests against the invasion, including 20,000 people in Washington, D.C., on 29 September [251] and 20,000 people in London on 7 October [252] In Afghanistan, according to anthropologist Thomas Barfield, there was \"a surprising level of popular support...for the US intervention, especially among non-Pashtuns.\" [253] In November 2001, CNN reported widespread relief amongst Kabul's residents after the Taliban fled the city, with young men shaving their beards and women taking off their burqas [254]\n\n\nSee

military campaign launched in response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The invasion aimed to defeat al-Qaeda and its Taliban allies, who had provided sanctuary to the terrorist organization in Afghanistan.\n\n**Background**\n\nAfghanistan had been at war for over 20 years, with the communist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) seizing power in 1978. The Soviet Union intervened in 1979 to support the PDPA regime, prompting the United States and its allies to support the mujahidin rebels fighting against the Soviet-backed government. The mujahidin, led by figures such as Ahmad Shah Massoud, received significant support from the CIA and Pakistan's Inter-Service Intelligence (ISI). The war also attracted Arab volunteers, including Osama bin Laden, who founded al-Qaeda in the late 1980s.\n\n**Taliban vs. Northern Alliance (1996-2001)**\n\nIn 1996, the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan with military support from Pakistan and financial support from Saudi Arabia. The Taliban imposed a strict interpretation of Islamic law, forbidding women from working outside the home or attending school and requiring them to wear veils and abide by harsh rules on seclusion. Osama bin Laden was expelled from Sudan in 1996 and arrived in Afghanistan, where he developed a close relationship with the Taliban.\n\n**Al-Qaeda**\n\nAl-Qaeda, founded by bin Laden in the late 1980s, continued its jihad against the United States and its allies. The organization had established a presence in Afghanistan, where it received support from the Taliban. In the 1990s, the CIA and Delta Force planned several operations to kill or capture bin Laden, but President Bill Clinton never ordered them to proceed.\n\n**Change in U.S. policy towards Afghanistan**\n\nDuring the early years of the Clinton administration, the US had no clear policy towards Afghanistan. The 1998 US embassy bombings, however, masterminded by al-Qaeda, provoked President Clinton to order missile strikes on militant training camps in Afghanistan. Bin Laden was indicted for his involvement in the bombings. In 1999, the US and the United Nations enacted sanctions against the Taliban in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1267, which demanded the Taliban surrender bin Laden for trial in the US and close all terrorist bases in Afghanistan.\n\n**Military situation on the eve of the 9/11 attacks**\n\nOn the eve of the 9/11 attacks, the Taliban and Northern Alliance forces faced each other from trenches across the Shomali Plain. The Northern Alliance had 15,000-20,000 fighters distributed across five locations. The Taliban had little physical infrastructure for the military to target, making it difficult for the US to plan a military campaign.\n\n**Diplomatic and political activity**\n\nIn the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, President Bush stated that the US would respond to the attacks and would \"make no distinction between those who planned these acts and those who harbor them.\" Congress passed legislation titled Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists, authorizing military force against al-Qaeda and its supporters. President Bush addressed Congress on 20 September and demanded the Taliban deliver bin Laden and al-Qaeda or face war.\n\n**Planning**\n\nIn 2001, the Defense Department did not have a pre-existing plan for an invasion of Afghanistan. Therefore, the plan approved by Bush was devised by the CIA, reusing elements of the agency's previous contingency plans for collaboration with the Northern Alliance against the Taliban. The CIA presented its war plan, which involved inserting paramilitary teams to work with the Northern Alliance and, eventually, American Special Forces units. The planners wanted to minimize the use of American ground forces, to avoid provoking the Afghan population.\n\n**Humanitarian situation in Afghanistan**\n\nAt the time of the invasion, the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan was dire. The attacks in the United States caused thousands of Afghans to attempt to flee, fearing potential US military action. Food stock was running critically low, and almost all aid workers had left the country after the attacks. Seventy percent of the population was undernourished, and the life expectancy was ranked two places from bottom in the world.\n\n**Overthrow of the Taliban**\n\nThe invasion consisted of American, British, Canadian, and Australian forces, with other countries providing logistical support. General Tommy Franks of US Central Command (CENTCOM) was the overall commander for Operation Enduring Freedom. The Northern Alliance forces, led by General Mohammed Fahim, were supported by the US Special Forces. The Northern Alliance entered Kabul on 13 November, following the Taliban's retreat. The US tracked and killed al-Qaeda's number three, Muhammad Atif, with an air strike in Kabul on 12 November.\n\n**Battle of Tora Bora: Osama bin Laden escapes to Pakistan**\n\nAfter the fall of Kabul and Kandahar, suspected al-Qaeda members, including bin Laden and other key leaders, withdrew to Jalalabad, Nangarhar Province, and then moved into the Tora Bora region of the Spin Ghar (White Mountains). Instead of committing conventional forces, both the White House and the Pentagon decided to isolate and destroy al-Qaeda elements in the area with the US SOF supporting locally recruited Afghan militias.\n\n**Inter-Afghan political settlement**\n\nIn late November 2001, the United Nations hosted the Bonn Conference, which created the Afghan Interim Authority and outlined the Bonn Process that would lead towards a new constitution and a new Afghan government. Following the Bonn Conference, tr", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"United_States_invasion_of_Afghanistan\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nIn 2001, Afghanistan had been at war for over 20 years [14] The communist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) seized power in 1978, and its policies sparked a popular uprising [15] The Soviet Union, sensing PDPA weakness, intervened in 1979 to support the regime [16]  The Soviet entry into Afghanistan prompted its Cold War rivals, especially the United States and Saudi Arabia, to support rebels fighting against the Soviet-backed PDPA [17] While the secular and socialist government controlled the cities, religiously motivated [18] mujahidin held sway in much of the countryside [19] The most important mujahidin commander was Ahmad Shah Massoud, who led the well-organized Tajik forces [20] The American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) worked closely with Pakistan's Inter-Service Intelligence (ISI) to funnel foreign support for the mujahidin [21] The war also attracted Arab volunteers, known as \"Afghan Arabs\", [22] including Osama bin Laden [23]\n\n\nTaliban vs. Northern Alliance (1996–2001)\nIn 1996, with military support from Pakistan and financial support from Saudi Arabia, the Taliban seized Kabul and founded the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan [27] They imposed their fundamentalist interpretation of Islam in areas under their control, issuing edicts forbidding women to work outside the home or attend school and requiring them to abide by harsh rules on veiling and seclusion [28]\n\n\nAl-Qaeda\nAfter nearly five years of shelter, bin Laden was expelled from Sudan in 1996 and arrived in Jalalabad, Afghanistan [34] He had founded al-Qaeda in the late 1980s to continue jihad after the end of the Soviet–Afghan War [35] He moved al-Qaeda's operations to eastern Afghanistan and developed a close relationship with the Taliban [36] However some key Taliban members, such as the foreign minister Wakil Muttawakil, disapproved of the alliance with al-Qaeda because bin Laden's terrorist activities were complicating the Taliban's quest for international recognition of their government [37] In 2000, Muhammad Umar visited bin Laden and forbade him from attacking the United States while he was a guest of the Taliban [38]  During the 1990s, the CIA and Delta Force [39] planned several operations to kill or capture bin Laden, but President Bill Clinton never ordered them to proceed [40]\n\n\nChange in U.S. policy towards Afghanistan\nDuring the early years of the Clinton administration, the US had no clear policy toward Afghanistan [41] The 1998 US embassy bombings, however, masterminded by al-Qaeda, provoked President Clinton to order missile strikes on militant training camps in Afghanistan; [42] bin Laden was indicted for his involvement in the bombings In 1999 both the US and the United Nations enacted sanctions against the Taliban in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1267, which demanded the Taliban surrender bin Laden for trial in the US and close all terrorist bases in Afghanistan [43] At the time, the only collaboration between Massoud and the US was an effort with the CIA to trace bin Laden [44] The US provided no support for Massoud's fight against the Taliban [45]\n\n\nMilitary situation on the eve of the 9/11 attacks\nOn 9 September 2001, two al-Qaeda members posing as journalists killed Massoud by detonating a bomb hidden in their video camera battery belt during an interview [48] Mohammed Fahim became the new leader of the Northern Alliance [49] The Alliance had 15,000–20,000 fighters distributed across five locations [9] On the Kabul front, Taliban and Northern Alliance forces faced each other from trenches across the Shomali Plain [9] The Takhar front extended from the Tajikistan border in the north to Parwan in the south, near Kabul  Dostum's forces were located south of Mazar-i-Sharif, the Hazaras under Muhammad Mohaqiq were in the central Hazarajat region, [50] and Ismail Khan was near Herat [6]\n\n\nPrelude to the invasion\nOn the morning of 11 September 2001, al-Qaeda carried out four coordinated attacks on the United States, employing four hijacked jet airliners [60] The attacks killed almost 3,000 people and injured more than 6,000 others [60] By the early afternoon of 11 September, the CIA had confirmed that al-Qaeda was responsible for the attack [61] The Taliban condemned the attacks, [62] but Umar issued a statement denying bin Laden's involvement [63] Although bin Laden eventually took responsibility for the 9/11 attacks in 2004, [64] he initially denied having any involvement [65] One of bin Laden's strategic goals was to draw the US into a costly war in Afghanistan, so it could be defeated just as the USSR had been [60]\n\n\nDiplomatic and political activity\nOn the evening of 11 September, President Bush stated the US would respond to the attacks and would \"make no distinction between those who planned these acts and those who harbor them.\" [66] On 14 September 2001, Congress passed legislation titled Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists, authorizing military force against al-Qaeda and its supporters [67] President Bush addressed Congress on 20 September and demanded the Taliban deliver bin Laden and al-Qaeda or face war [62]\n\n\nPlanning\nIn 2001, the Defense Department did not have a pre-existing plan for an invasion of Afghanistan [80] Therefore, the plan approved by Bush was devised by the CIA, reusing elements of the agency's previous contingency plans for collaboration with the Northern Alliance against the Taliban [81] Bush met with his cabinet at Camp David on 15 September for a war planning session [82] The military presented three options for military action in Afghanistan: The first was a cruise missile strike, the second was a combined cruise missile and bombing campaign lasting 3–10 days, and the third called for cruise missile and bomber strikes as well as ground forces operating inside Afghanistan [83] The CIA also presented its war plan, which involved inserting paramilitary teams to work with the Northern Alliance and, eventually, American Special Forces units [84] The planners wanted to minimize the use of American ground forces, to avoid provoking the Afghan population as the British and Russians had done [85] On 17 September Bush approved the CIA's plan and directed the military to develop a detailed war plan based on the third option from Camp David [86] Planning efforts were hindered because the Taliban had little physical infrastructure for the military to target [87] Early plans by the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) included poisoning the Afghan food supply and raiding a fertilizer factory that JSOC believed could be used to make chemical weapons [88]\n\n\nHumanitarian situation in Afghanistan\nAt the time of the invasion, the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan was dire, and the attacks in the United States caused thousands of Afghans to attempt to flee fearing potential U.S military action - this on top of millions that were already refugees in regional countries due to the continuous conflict already in place for 22 years [94] Food stock was running critically low and almost all aid workers had left the country after the attacks [95] Barry Bearak in a New York Times article described Afghanistan as a \"post-apocalyptic place of felled cities, parched land and downtrodden people.\" [94] Seventy percent of the population was undernourished in 2001, and the life expectancy was ranked two places from bottom in the world [96]\n\n\nOverthrow of the Taliban\nThe invasion consisted of American, British, Canadian, and Australian forces, with other countries providing logistical support [99] General Tommy Franks of US Central Command (CENTCOM) was the overall commander for Operation Enduring Freedom He led four task forces: the Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force (CJSOTF), Combined Joint Task Force Mountain (CJTF-Mountain), the Joint Interagency Task Force-Counterterrorism (JIATF-CT), and the Coalition Joint Civil-Military Operations Task Force (CJCMOTF) [100]\n\n\nCommand structure\nThe invasion consisted of American, British, Canadian, and Australian forces, with other countries providing logistical support [99] General Tommy Franks of US Central Command (CENTCOM) was the overall commander for Operation Enduring Freedom He led four task forces: the Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force (CJSOTF), Combined Joint Task Force Mountain (CJTF-Mountain), the Joint Interagency Task Force-Counterterrorism (JIATF-CT), and the Coalition Joint Civil-Military Operations Task Force (CJCMOTF) [100]\n\n\nFirst move\nOn 26 September, fifteen days after 9/11, the US covertly inserted (via CIA-piloted Mi-17 helicopter) [104] 10 [b] members of the CIA into the Panjshir Valley, Massoud's stronghold [107] The CIA mission was led by Gary Schroen and designated the Northern Afghanistan Liaison Team, known by the call-sign 'Jawbreaker' [108] In addition to specialized human assets, the team brought a metal case containing $3 million in $100 bills to buy support [104] Jawbreaker linked up with General Mohammed Fahim, commander of the Northern Alliance forces in the Panjshir Valley, and prepared the way for introduction of Army Special Forces [109] The Jawbreaker team brought satellite communications equipment, enabling its intelligence reports to be instantly available to CIA headquarters The team also assessed potential targets for Operation Crescent Wind, provided in-extremis combat search and rescue (CSAR), and could provide bomb damage assessment for the air campaign [110] To allow fixed-wing aircraft to land in the area, the team refurbished an airstrip at Gulbahar built by the British in 1919 [111]\n\n\nInitial air strikes\nOn 7 October, the US began military operations in Afghanistan with air strikes on 31 targets across the country [114]  Most of the Taliban's outdated SA-2 and SA-3 surface-to-air missiles, small fleet of MIG-21s and Su-22s, and radar and command units were destroyed on the first night [115] On the same night the CIA conducted the first-ever air strike with a Predator drone [116] The Predator was loitering over Muhammad Umar's house and followed several men who left the house [117] CIA analysts believed that Umar was in the group, which drove first to the house of Umar's mother and then to a school west of Kandahar [118] The men stayed in the school for several hours and the CIA requested that the Air Force strike the school with a conventional bomb, but Franks denied the request, citing the risk of collateral damage and uncertainty over whether Umar was really there [119] The CIA fired the Predator's Hellfire missile at a truck outside to draw the men out; the men left the school, and Umar escaped [120] Predator drones had been in development since the early 1990s, had been used to search for bin Laden since 2000, and had even been proposed as a means of assassinating bin Laden before 9/11 [121] The employment of armed Predators in Afghanistan marked the start of a new era of drone warfare [122]\n\n\nOperation Rhino and Objective Gecko\nOn the night of 19 October, simultaneous with the Special Forces entering the country, 200 Rangers from the 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, parachuted onto Objective Rhino—a landing strip south of Kandahar [126] The landing strip had been built as part of an Emirati hunting camp [127] Before the Rangers dropped, B-2 Spirit stealth bombers and AC-130 gunships bombed and strafed the site, [126] with initial reports of eleven enemy killed and nine fleeing; upon reaching the ground the Rangers located and killed one Taliban fighter [128] [129] The Rangers provided security while a forward arming and refuelling point (FARP) was established using fuel bladders from MC-130s, to refuel aircraft flying to the next objective [126] The mission was filmed by combat cameramen and a P-3C Orion observation plane flying overhead [130] No US casualties were suffered in the operation itself (two Rangers received minor injuries in the jump), [130] but two Rangers assigned to a CSAR element supporting the mission were killed when their MH-60L helicopter crashed at a temporary staging site in Dalbandin, Pakistan, due to a brownout [131]\n\n\nContinued air strikes\nThe Green Berets of ODA 595 split into two elements, Alpha and Bravo Alpha rode on horseback with General Dostum to his headquarters to plan an assault on Mazar-i-Sharif Bravo was tasked with clearing the Darya Suf Valley of Taliban and to travel into the Alma Tak Mountains to conduct reconnaissance [137] Dostum and General Atta Muhammad Nur had been fighting the Taliban in the Darya Suf Valley throughout the summer and had gradually lost ground [138] The valley ran north to south and Dostum had established his headquarters near the village of Dehi—60 miles south of Mazar-i-Sharif—because the rugged terrain prevented Taliban tanks from moving that far into the valley [139]\n\n\nFall of Mazar-i-Sharif\nMazar-i-Sharif was important as the home of the sacred Muslim site of the Shrine of Ali, and as a transportation hub, with two major airports and a bridge into Uzbekistan [154] Taking the city would enable humanitarian aid to alleviate a looming food crisis, which threatened more than six million people with starvation Many of those in most urgent need lived in rural areas to the south and west of Mazar-i-Sharif Dostum and Atta fought their way up the Balkh Valley and on 8 November reached the Tanghi Pass, the gateway between the valley and Mazar-i-Sharif [155] [156] The pass was heavily defended, but the Northern Alliance seized it on 9 November, [156] triggering a Taliban retreat from Mazar-i-Sharif [157] The Northern Alliance entered the city on 10 November [158]\n\n\nFall of Kabul\nOn 12 November, the US tracked and killed al-Qaeda's number three, Muhammad Atif, with an air strike in Kabul [163] That day the Taliban abandoned Kabul and decided to regroup in Jalalabad and Kandahar [164] Taliban forces evacuated by the end of 13 November, [164] and Northern Alliance forces (supported by ODA 555) [165] arrived took control of the city the following afternoon [166] During their retreat, the Taliban took the Shelter Now prisoners with them, but abandoned them in a prison in Ghazni on 13 November [167] Anti-Taliban Afghans freed the prisoners, who had found a satellite phone and used it to call the American embassy in Pakistan [167] SEAL Team Six used Chinook helicopters to extract the prisoners from Ghazni on the night of 14 November and take them to Pakistan [168]\n\n\nObjective Wolverine, Objective Raptor, and Operation Relentless Strike\nOn 13 November, the 75th Ranger Regiment carried out its second combat parachute drop into Afghanistan [171] A platoon-sized Ranger security element, including a team from the Ranger Reconnaissance Detachment and accompanied by eight Air Force Special Tactical operators, parachuted into a dry lake bed southwest of Kandahar and secured the area [172] A pair of MC-130 cargo planes then landed in the lake bed and deposited four AH-6J Little Bird helicopters from the 160th SOAR [173] The Little Birds flew to a Taliban compound near Kandahar codenamed Objective Wolverine and destroyed it [174] They returned to the lake bed to rearm and refuel, then launched another strike against a second site called Objective Raptor [175] After the second strike they went back to the lake bed, loaded onto the MC-130s and flew back to Oman [175] A series of missions codenamed Operation Relentless Strike began on 16 November On the first night, the Rangers drove modified HMMWVs and Land Rovers to secure a remote desert airstrip [176] The Little Birds then flew in on MC-130s and conducted a search and destroy mission along Highway 1 [177]  The Little Birds conducted similar search and destroy missions over the next several nights [178]\n\n\nBattle of Tarinkot\nOn 14 November, ODA 574 and Hamid Karzai inserted into Uruzgan Province via 4 MH-60K helicopters [165] with a small force of guerrillas [179] Karzai was the leader of the Pashtun Popalzai tribe and had been an enemy of the Taliban since they assassinated his father in 1999 [142] He had entered Afghanistan with three other men on 9 October, but was almost killed by the Taliban, and was extracted by the CIA on 4 November [179] Once he returned he began to move towards the town of Tarinkot Responding to the approach of Karzai's forces, the inhabitants of the town of Tarinkot revolted and expelled their Taliban administrators [180] Karzai traveled to Tarinkot to meet with the town elders [180] While he was there, the Taliban marshaled a force of 300–500 men to retake the town [179] Karzai's small force, plus the American contingent, deployed in the town's front to block the Taliban's advance Relying heavily on close air support, the American and Afghan force managed to drive the Taliban away from the town [181]\n\n\nSiege of Kunduz and alleged Pakistani airlift\nTask Force Dagger's attention focused on the last northern Taliban stronghold, Kunduz [165] As the bombardment at Tora Bora grew, the Siege of Kunduz continued General Daoud and ODA 586 had initiated massive coalition airstrikes to demoralize the Taliban defenders [165] After 11 days of fighting and bombardment, Taliban fighters surrendered to Northern Alliance forces on 23 November Shortly before the surrender, Pakistani aircraft arrived to evacuate intelligence and military personnel who had been aiding the Taliban's fight against the Northern Alliance, including Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders [185] The details of the airlift are disputed Investigative reporter Seymour Hersh alleged that up to five thousand people were evacuated, [186] while Karzai stated that, \"even the Americans did not know who got away.\" [187] The United States government denied that the airlift occurred, with Secretary Rumsfeld saying, \"neither Pakistan nor any other country flew any planes into Afghanistan to evacuate anybody.\" [187]\n\n\nOperation Trent\nThe British Special Air Service (SAS) played a small role in the early stages of the war because American SOF commanders guarded targets for their own units It took political intercession from Prime Minister Tony Blair for the SAS to be given a direct-action task – the destruction of an al-Qaeda-linked opium production facility The facility was located 400 km (250 mi) southwest of Kandahar and defended by between 80 and 100 foreign fighters, with a defense of trench lines and several makeshift bunkers The SAS were ordered to assault the facility in full daylight because CENTCOM would not provide air support for a night raid The timing meant that the squadrons could not carry out a detailed reconnaissance prior to the assault Despite these factors, the commanding officer of 22 SAS accepted the mission The target was a low priority for the US and probably would have been destroyed from the air if the British had not argued for a larger role in Afghanistan [188]\n\n\nBattle of Qala-i-Jangi\nOn 25 November, as Taliban prisoners were moved into Qala-i-Jangi fortress near Mazar-i-Sharif, a few Taliban attacked their Northern Alliance guards This incident triggered a revolt by 600 prisoners, who soon seized the southern half of the fortress, including an armory stocked with AK-47s, RPGs and crew-served weapons Johnny Micheal Spann, one of two CIA SAD operatives at the fortress who had been interrogating prisoners, was killed, marking America's first combat death [192]\n\n\nConsolidation: the fall of Kandahar\nODA 574 and Hamid Karzai began moving on Kandahar, gathering fighters from friendly local Pashtun tribes At the strategic Sayd-Aum-Kalay Bridge they fought for two days with the Taliban, eventually seizing it with the help of US airpower, opening the road to Kandahar [183]\n\n\nBattle of Tora Bora: Osama bin Laden escapes to Pakistan\nAfter the fall of Kabul and Kandahar, suspected al-Qaeda members, including bin Laden and other key leaders, withdrew to Jalalabad, Nangarhar Province From there they moved into the Tora Bora region of the Spin Ghar (White Mountains), 20 km away from the Pakistan border, which had a network of caves and prepared defenses used by the mujahidin during the Soviet–Afghan War [206] Signal intercepts and interrogation of captured Taliban fighters and al-Qaeda terrorists pointed towards the presence of significant numbers of foreign fighters and possible senior leaders in the area [207] Instead of committing conventional forces, both the White House and the Pentagon decided to isolate and destroy al-Qaeda elements in the area with the US SOF supporting locally recruited Afghan militias, due to a fear of repeating the Soviet's experience in the area [208]\n\n\nInter-Afghan political settlement\nIn late November 2001, the United Nations hosted the Bonn Conference; [228] the Taliban were excluded, [229] while three Afghan opposition groups participated [230] Observers included representatives of neighboring and other involved major countries [228] The resulting Bonn Agreement created the Afghan Interim Authority and outlined the Bonn Process that would lead towards a new constitution and a new Afghan government [229] Following the Bonn Conference, tribal leaders and former exiles established an interim government in Kabul under Hamid Karzai [231]\n\n\nCasualties and war crimes\nThe Costs of War Project at Brown University estimated that between 1,537 and 2,375 civilians were killed during the invasion [13] Northern Alliance casualties are unknown [11] United States casualties were 12 military personnel and one CIA officer (Mike Spann), [10] while the Taliban suffered 8,000 to 12,000 killed [12] According to Human Rights Watch, during the invasion the Northern Alliance \"carried out systematic attacks on Pashtun villages, raping women, summarily executing civilians, and stealing livestock and land.\" [232]\n\n\nLogistics\nA landlocked country with forbidding terrain and a harsh climate, Afghanistan presents major difficulties for military operations Prior to the war, the United States had no military bases in Central or South Asia The initial CIA Jawbreaker team entered Afghanistan by helicopter from Tashkent, Uzbekistan, stopping to refuel in Dushanbe, Tajikistan [233] The US established its main base at Karshi-Khanabad Air Base (known as K2) in Uzbekistan [234] Personnel and equipment were flown from the large American bases in Germany to K2 and then to Afghanistan [235] Pakistan granted the use of Shahbaz Air Base in Jacobabad as an auxiliary base, [236] and the CIA flew Predator drones from both Jacobabad and Shamsi Airfield [237] Masirah Island off the coast of Oman served as the headquarters of Joint Special Operations Command, [238] while the aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk in the Indian Ocean was used as a platform for helicopters of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment to fly special operations personnel into southern Afghanistan [239] Some B-52 bombers flew into Afghanistan from the island of Diego Garcia, and B-2 bombers flew nonstop from Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri to Afghanistan [239]\n\n\nAnalysis\nAccording to historian Carter Malkasian, the campaign was a \"striking military success\" [8] The United States achieved its war aims while committing a force of only 110 CIA officers, 350 special operators, and 5,000 Rangers and Marines [8] The model of special forces working with local fighters and calling in precision air strikes was heavily used by the US during later operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria [8] One explanation for the rapid victory is that in Afghan culture, fighters tend to defect to the winning side once its victory is seen as inevitable; [240] as anthropologist Thomas Barfield puts it, \"Just as the Taliban had come to power by persuading people that they were winners without fighting and buying the defection of wavering commanders with suitcases full of hundred-dollar bills, they lost the war in a reverse process.\" [241] The pattern recurred during the 2021 Taliban offensive, when the US-backed government collapsed and a resurgent Taliban captured a dozen provincial capitals in a week before it entered Kabul unopposed [242]\n\n\nLegality and international law\nScholars have disputed the legality of the invasion under international law The US and its allies argued that the invasion was an act of self defense, which is legal according to Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations [243] The US sent a letter to the Security Council on 7 October stating that, \"Afghanistan was harboring terrorists who attacked the United States, that further attacks might be anticipated, and that military action was needed to deter them.\" [244] Legal scholar John Quigley has argued that the invasion was illegal because al-Qaeda, not Afghanistan, was the perpetrator of the 9/11 attacks, and because there was no evidence that further terrorist attacks were imminent [245] Sean Murphy made the opposite case, that Afghanistan was responsible for the actions of al-Qaeda because it allowed al-Qaeda to operate from its territory and refused to extradite al-Qaeda operatives [246] The debate continued with the 2009 publication of Myra Williamson's Terrorism, War and International Law: The Legality of the Use of Force Against Afghanistan in 2001 [247] Williamson analyzed the legal questions raised by state responses to terrorism and the implications of the Afghanistan precedent for later conflicts such as the 2003 United States invasion of Iraq and the 2006 Israeli invasion of Lebanon [248]\n\n\nReactions and aftermath\nIn October 2001 when the invasion began, polls indicated that about 88% of Americans and about 65% of Britons backed military action [249] An Ipsos-Reid poll conducted between November and December 2001 showed that majorities in Canada (66%), France (60%), Germany (60%), Italy (58%), and the UK (65%) approved of US airstrikes while majorities in Argentina (77%), China (52%), South Korea (50%), Spain (52%), and Turkey (70%) opposed them [250] There were a number of protests against the invasion, including 20,000 people in Washington, D.C., on 29 September [251] and 20,000 people in London on 7 October [252] In Afghanistan, according to anthropologist Thomas Barfield, there was \"a surprising level of popular support...for the US intervention, especially among non-Pashtuns.\" [253] In November 2001, CNN reported widespread relief amongst Kabul's residents after the Taliban fled the city, with young men shaving their beards and women taking off their burqas [254]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The Chinese government has implemented various regulations and restrictions on the media, which have impacted the ability of journalists and citizens to access and disseminate information.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe country's constitution prohibits media workers, including internet users, from publishing, writing, circulating, or otherwise posting fake news, misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda related to various subjects such as national security, terrorism, ethnic hatred, violence, and obscenity. However, most private journalists are restricted from sharing certain views and opinions with the general public.\n\nIn practice, the Chinese government exercises significant control over the media, with most news organizations being state-owned or having close ties to the ruling Communist Party. The government has also implemented various measures to restrict online freedom, including censorship, surveillance, and blocking of websites and social media platforms.\n\n**Global Rank**\n\nAs of 2023, the global rank of China declined to 179 out of 180, with only North Korea having less press freedom. China has been one of the countries with nominal freedom of press regulations. Reporters Without Borders, a non-government organization dedicated to safeguarding the right to information, published an annual report, the World Press Freedom Index, indicating that the Chinese Communist Party, the ruling party, is exercising self- and direct-censorship on the press.\n\nThe report highlighted the challenges faced by journalists in China, including imprisonment, arrest, and harassment. The Committee to Protect Journalists also reported on the increasing number of journalists imprisoned in China, with Uyghurs making up almost half of all imprisoned journalists.\n\n**Censorship**\n\nAccording to Reporters Without Borders, the role of the media in China is to impart state propaganda. The government has implemented various measures to restrict the media, including censorship, surveillance, and blocking of websites and social media platforms. The Great Firewall, a system of internet censorship, has blocked most foreign news websites, such as Voice of America, BBC News, The New York Times, and Bloomberg News.\n\nIn 2017, Chinese authorities removed about \"300 politically sensitive articles\" from the Cambridge University Press, which sparked international criticism. However, this removal was later contested online on Change.org. In 2019, some scholars and writers deleted their posts or permanently deleted their feeds after authorities asked them to do so. Some writers were warned for retweeting or liking posts.\n\nThe censorship in China is not limited to the media. The government has also restricted online freedom, including blocking social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, and limiting access to the internet in certain regions. The restrictions have had a significant impact on the ability of citizens to access information and express themselves online.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Freedom of speech in China\n* Internet censorship in China\n* Great Firewall of China\n* Reporters Without Borders\n* Committee to Protect Journalists\n\n**References**\n\n* Reporters Without Borders.
