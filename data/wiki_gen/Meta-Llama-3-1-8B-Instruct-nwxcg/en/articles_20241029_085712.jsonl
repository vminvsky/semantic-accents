The film is a semi-autobiographical account of Spielberg's own childhood experiences, focusing on his early life and introduction to filmmaking.

This situation can arise due to various reasons such as revolution, coup, or collapse of the existing government. The embassy may continue to perform its duties and represent the interests of the state, even if there is no recognized government in place.\n\n**History**\n\n### Russia (1917–1925)\n\nThe Russian Empire was overthrown in 1917, leading to the establishment of the Soviet Union. However, the Soviet government was still in its early stages of development, and the country was plagued by civil war and power struggles. In this situation, the Russian diplomatic missions abroad continued to operate, albeit with reduced capabilities.\n\n#### Diplomatic missions after 1917\n\nFollowing the October Revolution, the Russian government sent instructions to its diplomatic missions abroad, instructing them to maintain a low profile and avoid any actions that could be seen as promoting the new Bolshevik regime. Many Russian diplomats were recalled to Moscow, while others were left in place to manage the day-to-day affairs of the embassies.\n\nThe Soviet government saw the continued operation of the diplomatic missions as a way to maintain a semblance of continuity and stability in a chaotic time. However, the missions were severely hampered by the lack of clear instructions and the limited resources available.\n\n#### Dissolution of the Soviet Union\n\nThe Soviet Union began to dissolve in 1991, with the Baltic states declaring independence in August 1991. By the end of 1991, the Soviet Union had effectively ceased to exist. However, the Russian diplomatic missions continued to operate, albeit with some modifications.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Russian government began to re-establish its diplomatic presence abroad, with a focus on rebuilding relationships with other countries. The diplomatic missions that had continued to operate during the Soviet era were gradually re-designated as Russian missions.\n\n### Spain (1939–1977)\n\nThe Spanish Civil War ended in 1939, with the victory of the Nationalist forces led by General Francisco Franco. Franco's regime was authoritarian and repressive, and the country was effectively without a functioning government.\n\n#### Diplomatic missions after 1939\n\nThe Spanish diplomatic missions abroad continued to operate, albeit with reduced capabilities. Many Spanish diplomats were forced to flee the country, while others remained in place to manage the day-to-day affairs of the embassies.\n\nThe Franco regime saw the continued operation of the diplomatic missions as a way to maintain a semblance of continuity and stability in a time of great upheaval. However, the missions were severely hampered by the lack of clear instructions and the limited resources available.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the Spanish government began to re-establish its diplomatic presence abroad, with a focus on rebuilding relationships with other countries. The diplomatic missions that had continued to operate during the Franco era were gradually re-designated as Spanish missions.\n\n### Poland (1939–1990)\n\nPoland was invaded by Germany and the Soviet Union in 1939, leading to the establishment of the General Government, a Nazi-backed puppet state. Following the end of World War II, Poland became a Soviet satellite state, and the country was effectively without a functioning government.\n\n#### Diplomatic missions after 1939\n\nThe Polish diplomatic missions abroad continued to operate, albeit with reduced capabilities. Many Polish diplomats were forced to flee the country, while others remained in place to manage the day-to-day affairs of the embassies.\n\nThe Polish government in exile, which was based in London, continued to claim sovereignty over Poland, and the diplomatic missions abroad were seen as representing the legitimate government of the country. However, the Polish government in exile was effectively powerless, and the country was under the control of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn the 1980s, the Polish government began to re-establish its diplomatic presence abroad, with a focus on rebuilding relationships with other countries. The diplomatic missions that had continued to operate during the Soviet era were gradually re-designated as Polish missions.\n\n### Afghanistan (2021–present)\n\nIn 2021, the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan, leading to the collapse of the government and the establishment of an Islamic emirate. Following the Taliban takeover, the Afghan diplomatic missions abroad continued to operate, albeit with reduced capabilities.\n\n#### Diplomatic missions after 2021\n\nThe Taliban saw the continued operation of the diplomatic missions as a way to maintain a semblance of continuity and stability in a time of great upheaval. However, the missions were severely hampered by the lack of clear instructions and the limited resources available.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Taliban takeover, many countries recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, and the diplomatic missions were gradually re-designated as Taliban missions.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Diplomatic missions\n* Government in exile\n* International recognition\n* State collapse\n\n**Notes**\n\nThis article is a general overview of the phenomenon of embassies without a government.

In 2020, FTX expanded its product offerings to include spot trading and other services.\n\nDuring its early years, FTX experienced rapid growth, with its user base and trading volume increasing significantly. The company's success was attributed to its innovative products and services, as well as its strong marketing efforts. In 2021, FTX raised $900 million in funding, valuing the company at $18 billion. By the end of 2021, FTX had become one of the largest cryptocurrency derivatives exchanges in the world.\n\n**November 2022 crisis and bankruptcy**\n\n### **Background: FTX and Alameda, Binance, and CoinDesk report**\n\nIn November 2022, a series of events led to a severe crisis at FTX. The crisis began with a report by CoinDesk, a cryptocurrency news website, which revealed that FTX had invested heavily in Alameda Research, a trading firm that was also owned by Bankman-Fried. The report raised concerns about the liquidity and solvency of both FTX and Alameda Research.\n\n### **Crisis begins: Binance FTT sale, sell-off, and withdrawn rescue bid**\n\nOn November 6, 2022, Binance, a rival cryptocurrency exchange, announced that it would sell its holdings of FTT, a token issued by FTX. The sale of FTT led to a significant sell-off of FTX's tokens, which in turn caused a liquidity crisis at the exchange. On November 8, 2022, Binance withdrew its bid to acquire FTX, citing concerns about the company's financial health and regulatory issues.\n\n### **Bankruptcy and unauthorized transactions**\n\nOn November 11, 2022, FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States. The company's bankruptcy was triggered by a liquidity crisis, which was exacerbated by a series of unauthorized transactions that were carried out by FTX's management. The unauthorized transactions, which included the transfer of billions of dollars in customer funds, were carried out without the knowledge or approval of FTX's board of directors.\n\n### **Widening impact and contagion fears**\n\nThe bankruptcy of FTX had a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market, with prices falling sharply in the days following the company's collapse. The collapse of FTX also led to a loss of confidence in other cryptocurrency exchanges and firms, with many investors withdrawing their funds and trading volumes falling significantly. The collapse of FTX raised concerns about the stability and resilience of the cryptocurrency market, with many analysts warning of a potential contagion effect.\n\n### **Responses and effects**\n\n#### **Effects on investors**\n\nThe collapse of FTX had a significant impact on investors, with many losing significant amounts of money. The company's bankruptcy and the loss of confidence in other cryptocurrency exchanges and firms led to a significant decline in investor confidence, with many investors withdrawing their funds and trading volumes falling significantly.\n\n#### **Effects on other cryptocurrency firms and cryptocurrency markets**\n\nThe collapse of FTX had a significant impact on other cryptocurrency firms and the cryptocurrency market as a whole. The company's bankruptcy and the loss of confidence in other cryptocurrency exchanges and firms led to a significant decline in trading volumes and prices. The collapse of FTX also raised concerns about the stability and resilience of the cryptocurrency market, with many analysts warning of a potential contagion effect.\n\n#### **Responses and commentary**\n\nIn response to the collapse of FTX, regulators and industry leaders have called for greater oversight and regulation of the cryptocurrency market. Many have argued that the collapse of FTX was a result of a lack of oversight and regulation, and that greater oversight would have prevented the company's collapse. Others have argued that the collapse of FTX was a result of market forces and that greater regulation would have stifled innovation and competition in the market.\n\n**Legal process**\n\nThe legal process surrounding FTX's bankruptcy is ongoing. The company's bankruptcy was triggered by a series of unauthorized transactions that were carried out by FTX's management, which included the transfer of billions of dollars in customer funds. The unauthorized transactions were carried out without the knowledge or approval of FTX's board of directors, and are currently the subject of an investigation by regulators.\n\n**Sponsorships**\n\nFTX was a sponsor of several high-profile events and organizations, including the Miami Heat basketball team, the Miami Open tennis tournament, and the Formula 1 racing team, Red Bull Racing. The company's sponsorship deals were valued at tens of millions of dollars, and were seen as a key part of its marketing and branding efforts.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article includes references to the following sources:\n\n* CoinDesk\n* Binance\n* FTX\n* Alameda Research\n* Sam Bankman-Fried\n* Gary Wang\n* Miami Heat\n* Miami Open\n* Red Bull Racing", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"FTX\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#November 2022 crisis and bankruptcy\n##Background: FTX and Alameda, Binance, and CoinDesk report\n##Crisis begins: Binance FTT sale, sell-off, and withdrawn rescue bid\n##Bankruptcy and unauthorized transactions\n##Widening impact and contagion fears\n##Responses and effects\n###Effects on investors\n###Effects on other cryptocurrency firms and cryptocurrency markets\n###Responses and commentary\n#Legal process\n#Sponsorships\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The season officially began on July 1, 2022, and ended on June 30, 2023. The season was monitored by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre (RSMC) in Réunion, which is responsible for issuing official warnings and advisories for tropical cyclones in the region.\n\n**Seasonal forecasts**\n\nPrior to the onset of the season, several organizations issued forecasts for the number of tropical cyclones expected to form during the season. The International Research Institute (IRI) predicted a below-average number of tropical cyclones, while the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) forecasted a near-average number of storms. The RSMC in Réunion issued a seasonal forecast that predicted a moderate risk of tropical cyclones in the region.\n\n**Seasonal summary**\n\nThe 2022–23 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season was a relatively active season, with a total of 11 named storms forming in the region. The season saw the formation of several intense tropical cyclones, including Very Intense Tropical Cyclone Freddy, which was one of the strongest storms to affect the region in recent years.

The city, located in the Donetsk Oblast, became a key battleground in the conflict, with Russian forces seeking to capture it and secure control of the Azov Sea coast.\n\n## Background\n\nMariupol, with a pre-war population of approximately 450,000 people, is an industrial city and a major port on the Azov Sea. The city has historical and cultural significance, with a blend of Russian, Ukrainian, and Crimean Tatar influences. Prior to the Russian invasion, Mariupol was a key economic hub in eastern Ukraine, with a strong focus on steel production, shipbuilding, and maritime trade.\n\n## Advances to Mariupol\n\n### Preliminary shelling and advance on the city\n\nOn February 24, 2022, the day of the Russian invasion, Mariupol was initially shelled by Russian artillery, causing significant damage to the city's infrastructure and civilian casualties. Russian troops then advanced on the city, eventually surrounding it and establishing a blockade.\n\n### Mariupol surrounded\n\nBy February 25, Mariupol was encircled by Russian forces, with the city's residents facing food and water shortages, as well as a lack of medical supplies. The city's defenders, comprising Ukrainian military and volunteer forces, prepared to repel the Russian invasion.\n\n## Urban advances\n\n### Russian push into the city\n\nRussian forces launched a series of assaults on Mariupol, attempting to capture key buildings and landmarks. The city's defenders put up a fierce resistance, using guerrilla tactics and ambushes to slow down the Russian advance. However, the Russian military's superior firepower and numbers eventually began to take its toll on the city.\n\n### Final pockets of resistance\n\nAs the Russian forces continued to press their attack, the defenders of Mariupol were forced to retreat to stronger positions, including the Azovstal steel plant. The plant, which had been converted into a fortress, became the last stronghold of Ukrainian resistance in the city.\n\n## Resistance in the Azovstal steel plant\n\n### Withdrawal to Azovstal\n\nOn March 14, 2022, Ukrainian forces withdrew from the city center to the Azovstal steel plant, which had been transformed into a fortified base. The plant's defenders, including members of the Azov Battalion, a far-right militia, prepared to make a final stand against the Russian invasion.\n\n### Siege of Azovstal\n\nThe Azovstal steel plant was subjected to intense bombardment by Russian artillery and air strikes, with the Russian military attempting to starve out the defenders. The plant's defenders, however, continued to resist, using the plant's labyrinthine corridors and tunnels to launch counterattacks against the Russian forces.\n\n### Evacuation of civilians\n\nAs the siege of Azovstal continued, efforts were made to evacuate civilians from the plant. On May 16, 2022, a group of civilians, including women and children, were evacuated from the plant, although it is unclear how many people remained behind.\n\n### Ukrainian surrender\n\nOn May 20, 2022, the Ukrainian military announced that it had surrendered at the Azovstal steel plant, marking the end of the siege of Mariupol. The surrender was widely seen as a strategic defeat for Ukraine, with the city falling under Russian control.\n\n## Aftermath\n\n### Demolition of buildings and Russification of the city\n\nFollowing the Ukrainian surrender, the city of Mariupol was subjected to extensive demolition and reconstruction, with many buildings being destroyed or modified to conform to Russian architectural standards. The city's infrastructure, including its streets and public spaces, was also altered to reflect Russian designs.\n\n### Last Ukrainian holdouts and prisoners of war\n\nIn the aftermath of the siege, a small group of Ukrainian soldiers and civilians remained in hiding, with some reports suggesting that they were being held prisoner by Russian forces. The exact fate of these individuals remains unclear.\n\n### City government's role\n\nThe city government of Mariupol, which had been established by the Ukrainian authorities, was disbanded following the Russian takeover. A new administration, loyal to the Russian government, was established, with a focus on rebuilding and rebranding the city as a key Russian stronghold in eastern Ukraine.\n\n### Claimed cholera outbreak\n\nThere were reports of a cholera outbreak in Mariupol in the aftermath of the siege, with some sources suggesting that the outbreak was caused by contaminated water supplies. However, the exact extent of the outbreak and its causes remain unclear.\n\n### Ukrainian missile strikes\n\nIn response to the Russian takeover of Mariupol, Ukraine launched a series of missile strikes against Russian targets in the city, including military installations and infrastructure. The strikes were seen as an attempt by Ukraine to disrupt Russian operations in the city and to assert its control over the region.\n\n## Casualties\n\n### Military casualties\n\nThe exact number of military casualties during the siege of Mariupol remains unclear, with estimates ranging from several hundred to several thousand. The Russian military suffered significant losses, including the destruction of several units and the deaths of numerous soldiers.\n\n### Civilian casualties\n\nThe siege of Mariupol resulted in significant civilian casualties, including the deaths of hundreds, if not thousands, of people. Many civilians were killed or injured in the initial shelling, while others died from malnutrition, disease, and other causes related to the siege.\n\n## Humanitarian situation\n\nThe humanitarian", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Siege_of_Mariupol\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Advances to Mariupol\n##Preliminary shelling and advance on the city\n##Mariupol surrounded\n#Urban advances\n##Russian push into the city\n##Final pockets of resistance\n#Resistance in the Azovstal steel plant\n##Withdrawal to Azovstal\n##Siege of Azovstal\n##Evacuation of civilians\n##Ukrainian surrender\n#Aftermath\n##Demolition of buildings and Russification of the city\n##Last Ukrainian holdouts and prisoners of war\n##City government's role\n##Claimed cholera outbreak\n##Ukrainian missile strikes\n#Casualties\n##Military casualties\n##Civilian casualties\n#Humanitarian situation\n#War crimes committed by Russian forces\n##Shooting of evacuation checkpoints\n##Maternity and children's hospital bombing\n##Regional theatre bombing\n##Mass shelling of residential areas\n##Alleged use of chemical weapons\n#Media coverage\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was a key figure in the Elizabethan era, serving as a navigator, explorer, and naval commander for the English crown.\n\n**Birth and early years**\n\nFrancis Drake was born around 1540 in Tavistock, Devon, England. His parents were Edmund Drake and his wife, a woman whose name is not recorded in historical records. Little is known about Drake's early life, but it is believed that he was educated in a local grammar school and may have received some training in navigation and seamanship.\n\n**Early career at sea**\n\nDrake's early career at sea is not well documented, but it is believed that he began his career as a merchant sailor in the late 1550s. He worked on several ships, including the _Mary Fortune_ and the _Swallow_ , before becoming a privateer in the early 1560s.\n\n### Slave trade\n\nAs a privateer, Drake participated in the slave trade, capturing and selling enslaved Africans in the Caribbean. This activity was not unusual for the time, and Drake's involvement in the slave trade reflects the complexities and contradictions of the era.\n\n### Expedition of 1572–1573\n\nIn 1572, Drake led an expedition to the Spanish Main, where he captured a Spanish ship and brought its crew to trial in England. This expedition was one of the earliest examples of Drake's skill as a naval commander and his willingness to challenge Spanish authority.\n\n### Rathlin Island massacre\n\nIn 1575, Drake led an expedition to Rathlin Island, off the coast of Ireland, where he massacred a group of Spanish soldiers who were attempting to escape from captivity. This massacre was one of the most infamous episodes of Drake's career, and it reflects the brutal and often violent nature of the privateering era.\n\n**Circumnavigation (1577–1580)**\n\nIn 1577, Drake set out on his most famous voyage, a circumnavigation of the globe that would take him across the Pacific and around Africa. This voyage was motivated by a desire to establish an English presence in the Pacific and to challenge Spanish authority in the Americas.\n\n### Execution of Thomas Doughty\n\nDuring the voyage, Drake's companion, Thomas Doughty, was accused of treason and executed by hanging, drawing, and quartering. This event was a significant turning point in the voyage, and it reflects the tensions and conflicts that arose between Drake and his crew.\n\n### Entering the Pacific (1578)\n\nIn 1578, Drake entered the Pacific through the Strait of Magellan, becoming the first Englishman to do so. He spent several months exploring the coast of South America, where he encountered indigenous peoples and traded with them.\n\n### Raids on Spanish American west coast\n\nDrake's voyage took him to the west coast of South America, where he launched a series of raids on Spanish settlements and ships. These raids were part of a broader strategy to disrupt Spanish trade and commerce in the region.\n\n### Coast of California: Nova Albion (1579)\n\nIn 1579, Drake landed on the coast of California, which he named Nova Albion. This event marked the first English contact with the region, and it reflects the ambitions and aspirations of the English crown in the Americas.\n\n### Across the Pacific and around Africa\n\nAfter exploring the west coast of South America, Drake set sail across the Pacific, becoming the first Englishman to do so. He navigated the treacherous waters of the Pacific, using his skills and experience to avoid danger and find safe harbor.\n\n### Return to Plymouth (1580)\n\nIn 1580, Drake returned to Plymouth, bringing with him a cargo of gold, silver, and other treasures. His voyage had been a resounding success, and it marked a significant turning point in the history of English exploration and trade.\n\n### Knighthood and arms\n\nIn 1581, Drake was knighted by Queen Elizabeth I for his services to the crown. He was also granted a coat of arms, which featured a dragon and other symbols of his naval exploits.\n\n**Political career**\n\nDrake's military and naval career was closely tied to his political ambitions, and he played a significant role in the politics of the Elizabethan era. He served as a member of Parliament and as a naval commander for the English crown, using his skills and experience to promote English interests and challenge Spanish authority.\n\n**Great Expedition to America**\n\nIn 1585, Drake led a Great Expedition to America, which was designed to establish an English presence in the Atlantic and to challenge Spanish authority in the Americas. This expedition was a significant turning point in the history of English exploration and trade, and it marked a major milestone in the development of the English empire.\n\n**Conflict with the Spanish Armada**\n\nIn 1588, Drake led the English fleet to victory against the Spanish Armada, which had been sent to invade England. This event was a significant turning point in the history of the English empire, and it marked a major milestone in the development of English naval power.\n\n### Cádiz raid\n\nIn 1587, Drake led a raid on the Spanish port of Cádiz, where he destroyed a fleet of Spanish ships and disrupted Spanish trade and commerce. This raid was part of a broader strategy to challenge Spanish authority in the Atlantic and to promote English interests.\n\n### Defeat of the Spanish Armada\n\nIn 1588, Drake led the English fleet to victory against the Spanish Armada, which had been sent to invade England. This event was a significant turning point in the history of the English empire, and it marked a major milestone in the development of English naval power.\n\n### English Armada\n\nIn 1589, Drake led the English Armada to victory against the Spanish fleet at the Battle of the Azores. This event marked a significant turning point in the history of the English empire, and it reflected the growing power and influence of England in the Atlantic.\n\n**Defeats and death**\n\nDespite his many successes, Drake suffered several defeats during his career, including a disastrous expedition to the Spanish Main in 1595. He died on 28 January 1596, off the coast of Panama, while on a voyage to the Spanish Main.\n\n**Family and heritage**\n\nDrake was married twice, first to Mary Newman and then to Elizabeth Sydenham. He had several children, including a son, Francis Jr., who played a significant role in the development of the English empire. Drake's legacy has been celebrated for centuries, and he remains one of the most famous and influential figures in English history.\n\n**Legacy and honours**\n\nDrake's legacy has been celebrated for centuries, and he remains one of the most famous and influential figures in English history. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth I and granted a coat of arms, which featured a dragon and other symbols of his naval exploits.

The election saw the re-election of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario (PCs) under the leadership of Premier Doug Ford.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe 2022 Ontario general election was a watershed moment in the province's history, marked by a highly contested and divisive campaign. The election saw the PCs face off against the New Democratic Party (NDP) under the leadership of Andrea Horwath, the Liberal Party under the leadership of Steven Del Duca, and the Green Party under the leadership of Mike Schreiner. The election was characterized by a focus on issues such as healthcare, education, and the economy.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2022 Ontario general election was the third consecutive election held under the leadership of Premier Doug Ford.

These included the NDP's MPP Marit Stiles, who had been a vocal critic of the PCs' policies, and Liberal MPP Kevin Flynn, who had been a member of the Legislative Assembly for 20 years.\n\n### Party slogans\n\nEach of the major parties had developed a party slogan for the election. The PCs had chosen the slogan \"Building Ontario,\" while the NDP had chosen \"A New Way Forward.\" The Liberal Party had chosen the slogan \"A Better Future for Ontario.\"\n\n### Debates\n\nThe cancellation of the election debate sparked a heated debate about the role of debates in the election campaign.

After leaving office in 2017, Biden took up a position as a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and established the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement.\n\n**Discoveries and other developments**\n\n### First batch of documents\n\nIn November 2022, it was reported that the White House had discovered a batch of classified documents from Joe Biden's vice presidency at his home in Wilmington, Delaware. The documents were found in a storage area in the garage of the home. The White House counsel, Robert F. Bauer, was informed, and he contacted the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and the Department of Justice (DOJ).\n\n### DOJ letter to Bob Bauer\n\nOn November 10, 2022, the DOJ sent a letter to Bob Bauer, informing him that they would be conducting an investigation into the matter. The letter stated that the DOJ would be looking into whether Biden had mishandled classified documents and whether he had taken adequate steps to secure them.\n\n### Second batch of documents\n\nIn December 2022, it was reported that another batch of classified documents had been found at the Penn Biden Center. The documents were found in a locked closet, and they included information related to Ukraine, Iran, and China.\n\n### FBI search of Biden's Wilmington home\n\nOn January 2, 2023, the FBI searched Biden's Wilmington home, looking for additional classified documents. The search was conducted by FBI agents and was overseen by the DOJ.\n\n### Other searches\n\nIn addition to the searches of Biden's home, the FBI also searched the Penn Biden Center and the University of Pennsylvania. The searches were part of the ongoing investigation into the handling of classified documents.\n\n**Initial responses**\n\n### Biden and his legal team\n\nJoe Biden and his legal team have maintained that he had taken steps to secure the classified documents and that he had cooperated fully with the investigation. Biden has stated that he had no knowledge of the existence of the documents and that he had not intentionally mishandled them.\n\n### Elected officials\n\n#### Republican elected officials\n\nRepublican elected officials have criticized Biden's handling of the classified documents and have called for him to be held accountable. Some have called for him to be impeached.\n\n#### Democratic elected officials\n\nDemocratic elected officials have generally supported Biden and have defended his actions. Some have stated that the matter should be handled through the normal channels of the DOJ and the Congress.\n\n### Media analysis\n\nThe incident has been widely covered in the media, with many outlets analyzing the implications for Biden and the handling of classified information. Some have raised questions about the security of the documents and the potential consequences for national security.\n\n### Misinformation\n\nThe incident has also been subject to misinformation and speculation. Some have questioned the timing of the discovery of the documents and have suggested that it was a deliberate attempt to embarrass Biden.\n\n### Discovery of classified documents at Mike Pence's residence\n\nIn January 2023, it was reported that classified documents had also been found at the residence of former Vice President Mike Pence. The documents were found in a locked safe and included information related to national security.\n\n**Investigations**\n\n### Special counsel\n\nThe DOJ has appointed a special counsel to investigate the handling of classified documents. The special counsel will be responsible for determining whether Biden and others had mishandled the documents and whether they had taken adequate steps to secure them.\n\n### Decision that charges were unwarranted\n\nIn March 2023, the special counsel announced that he had concluded that charges were unwarranted against Biden. The special counsel stated that while Biden had mishandled the documents, he had not acted with intent to deceive or conceal.\n\n### Comments on Biden's memory\n\nThe special counsel also made comments about Biden's memory, stating that he had been cooperative and had provided detailed information about the documents.\n\n**Congressional**\n\nThe incident has also sparked Congressional interest, with some lawmakers calling for hearings and investigations into the handling of classified documents. The House Oversight Committee has scheduled hearings on the matter, and some lawmakers have called for Biden to be held accountable.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Joe_Biden_classified_documents_incident\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Discoveries and other developments\n##First batch of documents\n##DOJ letter to Bob Bauer\n##Second batch of documents\n##FBI search of Biden's Wilmington home\n##Other searches\n#Initial responses\n##Biden and his legal team\n##Elected officials\n###Republican elected officials\n###Democratic elected officials\n##Media analysis\n##Misinformation\n##Discovery of classified documents at Mike Pence's residence\n#Investigations\n##Special counsel\n###Decision that charges were unwarranted\n###Comments on Biden's memory\n##Congressional\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The battle occurred in the Kapyong Valley, near the town of Kapyong, South Korea, as part of the Chinese Spring Offensive. The Australian 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR), and the Canadian 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (2 PPCLI), played key roles in defending against the Chinese attack.\n\n## Background\n\n### Military situation\n\nBy April 1951, the Korean War had been ongoing for nearly a year. The United Nations Command (UNC), led by General Douglas MacArthur, had pushed the North Korean Army (NKA) back across the 38th parallel, but the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) had entered the conflict in late October 1950, shifting the balance of power. The UNC had suffered a series of setbacks, and the Chinese had launched a series of successful counterattacks, leading to a stalemate.\n\n## Chinese Spring Offensive\n\n### Preparations\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the Chinese Spring Offensive, the PVA had concentrated a large force in the Kapyong Valley, preparing to launch a major attack on the UNC positions. The Chinese had gathered intelligence on the UNC's dispositions and had planned a coordinated attack, using a combination of infantry, artillery, and engineering assets.\n\n### Launch of Chinese Spring Offensive\n\nOn 22 April 1951, the Chinese Spring Offensive began, with a series of artillery bombardments and infantry attacks along the UNC's front. The 3 RAR and 2 PPCLI, part of the 1st Commonwealth Division, were tasked with defending the Kapyong Valley.\n\n## South Korean withdrawal, 22–23 April 1951\n\nThe South Korean 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry Regiment, had been positioned on Hills 504 and 677, which dominated the Kapyong Valley. However, the South Koreans began to withdraw from these positions on the evening of 22 April, leaving the Australians and Canadians to assume responsibility for defending the valley.\n\n## Australian 3 RAR defence of Hill 504, 23–24 April 1951\n\n### Night battle\n\nOn the night of 23 April, the 3 RAR established a defensive position on Hill 504, which was surrounded by steep slopes and dense scrub. The Australians knew they were outnumbered and outgunned, but they were determined to hold their ground. As the Chinese attacked, the 3 RAR fought bravely, using their training and experience to repel the enemy.\n\n### Day battle\n\nThe next day, the Chinese launched a series of attacks on Hill 504, but the 3 RAR held firm. The Australians suffered heavy casualties, but they managed to inflict significant losses on the Chinese. As the day wore on, the 3 RAR began to run low on ammunition, but they refused to yield.\n\n### 3 RAR withdraws\n\nOn the evening of 24 April, the 3 RAR withdrew from Hill 504, having held off the Chinese for 36 hours. The Australians had suffered heavy casualties, but they had inflicted significant losses on the enemy and had bought crucial time for the 2 PPCLI to establish a defensive position on Hill 677.\n\n## Canadian 2 PPCLI last stand on Hill 677, 24–25 April 1951\n\n### Preparations\n\nAs the 2 PPCLI established a defensive position on Hill 677, they knew they were in for a desperate fight. The Canadians had been tasked with holding the hill against overwhelming odds, and they were aware that they might not survive.\n\n### Night battle\n\nOn the night of 24 April, the Chinese launched a fierce attack on Hill 677, but the 2 PPCLI held firm. The Canadians fought bravely, using their training and experience to repel the enemy.\n\n### Final 2 PPCLI Operations\n\nThe next day, the 2 PPCLI launched a final counterattack, using their remaining ammunition to inflict significant losses on the Chinese. As the Canadians withdrew from Hill 677, they knew they had fought bravely, but they also knew that they had suffered heavy casualties.\n\n## Aftermath\n\n### Summary and casualties\n\nThe Battle of Kapyong was a brutal and intense engagement that lasted for three days. The 3 RAR and 2 PPCLI had suffered heavy casualties, but they had inflicted significant losses on the Chinese. The battle had been a crucial turning point in the Korean War, as it had shown that the UNC could hold its ground against the PVA.\n\n### Awards\n\nThe Battle of Kapyong was one of the bloodiest battles of the Korean War, and it was recognized with numerous awards and decorations. The 3 RAR and 2 PPCLI were awarded the United States Presidential Unit Citation, the United States Army Commendation Medal, and the British Victoria Cross.\n\n### Subsequent operations\n\nAfter the Battle of Kapyong, the UNC launched a series of counterattacks, using the time gained to regroup and reorganize. The PVA, however, continued to apply pressure, and the war dragged on for another two years.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Battle_of_Kapyong\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Military situation\n#Chinese Spring Offensive\n##Preparations\n##Launch of Chinese Spring Offensive\n##South Korean withdrawal, 22–23 April 1951\n#Australian 3 RAR defence of Hill 504, 23–24 April 1951\n##Night battle\n##Day battle\n##3 RAR withdraws\n#Canadian 2 PPCLI last stand on Hill 677, 24–25 April 1951\n##Preparations\n##Night battle\n##Final 2 PPCLI Operations\n#Aftermath\n##Summary and casualties\n##Awards\n##Subsequent operations\n#See also\n#Notes\n##Footnotes\n##Citations\n#References\n#Further reading\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

They are known for their rich cultural heritage, complex societies, and significant contributions to the history and development of the region.\n\n**Origins and Antecedents**\n\n### Toalean — Pre-Austronesian South Sulawesi\n\nThe earliest known inhabitants of South Sulawesi were the Toalean people, who are believed to have lived in the region from around 1000 BCE to 500 BCE. The Toalean culture is characterized by a number of distinctive artifacts, including stone tools and ceramics, that suggest a strong connection to the Wallacean culture of the Indonesian archipelago. The Toalean people are thought to have been a pre-Austronesian group, meaning that they lacked the linguistic and cultural characteristics that would later become hallmarks of the Austronesian peoples.\n\n### The Arrival of Austronesians\n\nAround 500 BCE, Austronesian-speaking peoples began to migrate to South Sulawesi, displacing the Toalean population and establishing new settlements in the region. These Austronesian migrants brought with them new technologies, such as the use of metal tools, and new cultural practices, such as the use of writing and the veneration of deities. The arrival of the Austronesians marked the beginning of a new chapter in the history of South Sulawesi, one that would be characterized by the growth of complex societies and the development of a distinct cultural identity.\n\n### Tana Ogi — Land of the Bugis\n\nThe modern Bugis people are believed to have originated in the Tana Ogi region of South Sulawesi, which is located in the southern part of the island. Tana Ogi is a fertile and well-watered region, with a rich soil that is well-suited to the cultivation of rice and other crops. The region is also home to a number of important rivers, including the Waringin and the Soppeng, which provide a source of fresh water and fish for the local population. The name \"Tana Ogi\" is thought to mean \"Land of the Bugis\" in the local language, and it is from this region that the modern Bugis people are believed to have emerged.\n\n**History**\n\n### Early Society\n\nThe early Bugis society was characterized by a number of distinct features, including a strong emphasis on kinship ties, a complex system of social hierarchy, and a rich cultural tradition. The Bugis people were organized into a number of small, autonomous villages, each of which was governed by a local leader who was responsible for maintaining order and resolving disputes. The villages were also organized into a number of larger, regional units, each of which was governed by a more powerful leader who was responsible for coordinating the activities of the individual villages.\n\n### The Growth of Bugis Kingdoms\n\nOver time, the Bugis kingdoms began to grow in size and power, with some kingdoms emerging as dominant powers in the region. The most powerful of these kingdoms was the kingdom of Luwu, which was founded in the 14th century and went on to become one of the most important kingdoms in the region. The kingdom of Luwu was known for its rich cultural heritage, its complex system of government, and its strong military tradition.\n\n### Emergence of New Political Strengths over the Peninsula\n\nAs the Bugis kingdoms grew in size and power, new political strengths began to emerge over the peninsula of South Sulawesi. One of the most important of these new powers was the kingdom of Gowa, which was founded in the 16th century and went on to become one of the most powerful kingdoms in the region. The kingdom of Gowa was known for its rich cultural heritage, its complex system of government, and its strong military tradition.\n\n### Bugis-Makassar Society in the 16th Century\n\nIn the 16th century, the Bugis-Makassar society was characterized by a number of distinct features, including a strong emphasis on trade and commerce, a complex system of social hierarchy, and a rich cultural tradition. The Bugis-Makassar people were organized into a number of small, autonomous villages, each of which was governed by a local leader who was responsible for maintaining order and resolving disputes. The villages were also organized into a number of larger, regional units, each of which was governed by a more powerful leader who was responsible for coordinating the activities of the individual villages.\n\n### Early Attempts to Christianize the Bugis States\n\nIn the 16th century, European colonizers began to arrive in South Sulawesi, and they attempted to Christianize the Bugis states. However, the Bugis people resisted this attempt, and they continued to practice their traditional faith. The attempt to Christianize the Bugis states was ultimately unsuccessful, and the Bugis people were able to maintain their cultural identity.\n\n### Quest for Prestige, Influence and Powers over the Peninsula\n\nAs the Bugis kingdoms grew in size and power, they began to engage in a number of conflicts with other kingdoms and states in the region. These conflicts were often driven by a desire for prestige, influence, and power over the peninsula of South Sulawesi. The Bugis kingdoms were able to maintain their independence and sovereignty, and they continued to play an important role in the region.\n\n### The Islamisation of Bugis-Makassar-Mandar\n\nIn the 17th century, the Bugis-Makassar-Mandar people began to adopt Islam, which became an important part of their cultural identity. The adoption of Islam was a gradual process, and it was influenced by a number of factors, including trade and commerce with other Islamic states in the region. The Islamisation of the Bugis-Makassar-Mandar people had a profound impact on their culture and society, and it helped to shape their identity as a distinct ethnic group.\n\n### The Twilight of Dominance\n\nIn the 19th century, the Bugis kingdoms began to decline in power and influence, and they were eventually colonized by the Dutch. The Dutch colonizers imposed their own system of government and culture on the Bugis people, and they suppressed the Bugis language and customs. The Bugis people were forced to adapt to the new colonial system, and they were subjected to a number of restrictions and regulations.\n\n### A New Golden Age\n\nIn the 20th century, the Bugis people began to experience a new golden age, marked by a renewed interest in their culture and language. The Bugis people were able to preserve their cultural identity and pass it down to future generations. The Bugis language and customs were revitalized, and they became an important part of the region's cultural heritage.\n\n**Culture**\n\n### Language and Dialects\n\nThe Bugis language is a member of the Austronesian language family, and it is spoken by the Bugis people in South Sulawesi. The Bugis language has a number of dialects, including the Makassar dialect, which is spoken in the Makassar region. The Bugis language is known for its complex grammar and vocabulary, and it is an important part of the Bugis cultural identity.\n\n### Philosophy\n\nThe Bugis people have a rich philosophical tradition, which is influenced by their cultural and religious practices. The Bugis philosophy is characterized by a strong emphasis on the importance of social harmony, respect for tradition, and a deep connection to the natural world. The Bugis people believe in the concept of \"adat,\" which refers to the traditional customs and practices of the community.\n\n### Traditional Script\n\nThe Bugis people have a traditional script, known as the \"Aksara Bugis,\" which is used to write the Bugis language. The Aksara Bugis script is an abugida script, which means that each consonant has a inherent vowel sound. The Aksara Bugis script is an important part of the Bugis cultural identity, and it is used in a number of traditional contexts, including writing and art.\n\n### Folklore and Literary Traditions\n\nThe Bugis people have a rich tradition of folklore and literature, which is influenced by their cultural and religious practices. The Bugis people believe in a number of supernatural beings, including spirits and demons, which are featured in their folklore. The Bugis people also have a number of traditional stories and legends, which are passed down through generations.\n\n### Dress, Textiles and Weaving Traditions\n\nThe Bugis people are known for their traditional dress and textiles, which are made from a variety of materials, including cotton, wool, and silk.

Born on January 15, 1977, in Rome, Italy, she has been a prominent figure in Italian politics for over two decades.\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nGiorgia Meloni's rise to prominence began in the early 2000s, when she joined the National Alliance (Alleanza Nazionale), a far-right party founded by former fascist dictator Benito Mussolini's post-war successor, Giorgio Almirante. As a young politician, Meloni quickly gained a reputation for her conservative views and her ability to connect with young people. In 2006, she became a member of the European Parliament, where she served for over a decade. In 2014, she became the leader of the Brothers of Italy, a party that was previously known as the National Alliance.

In her teenage years, Meloni was active in the Catholic youth movement, which helped shape her conservative values.\n\nAfter completing her secondary education, Meloni went on to study journalism at the University of Rome La Sapienza. However, she dropped out of university to pursue a career in politics. In 1996, at the age of 19, Meloni joined the National Alliance, a far-right party that was then led by Gianfranco Fini.

His father, Fateh Khan, was a minor noble and a member of the Barakzai tribe, one of the largest and most influential tribes in Afghanistan. Dost Mohammad's early life was marked by poverty and hardship, but he showed a keen intelligence and a strong will to succeed.\n\nIn his youth, Dost Mohammad was drawn to the service of the Durrani Empire, which was the dominant power in Afghanistan at the time. He quickly rose through the ranks, earning the respect and admiration of his superiors. In 1826, he was appointed as the governor of the Kabul province, a position that gave him significant influence and power.\n\n**European influence in Afghanistan**\n\nThe early 19th century saw the rise of European influence in Afghanistan, as the British and Russian Empires began to expand their territories in the region. Dost Mohammad was aware of the growing threat and saw the need to modernize and strengthen his military. He initiated a series of reforms, including the creation of a modern army and the establishment of a centralized government.\n\nHowever, the European powers were not interested in recognizing Dost Mohammad's authority. They saw him as a regional leader, but not as a legitimate ruler of a sovereign state. This led to a series of conflicts between Dost Mohammad and the European powers, including the British and the Russians.\n\n**War with the Sikhs**\n\nOne of the most significant challenges facing Dost Mohammad was the Sikh Empire, which was a powerful and influential state in the region. The Sikhs had long been a thorn in the side of the Afghans, and Dost Mohammad saw the need to take action.\n\nIn 1837, Dost Mohammad launched a campaign against the Sikhs, with the goal of driving them out of Afghanistan. The war was brutal and bloody, with both sides suffering significant losses. However, Dost Mohammad's forces were ultimately successful, and the Sikhs were forced to retreat.\n\n**Second reign**\n\nDost Mohammad's victory over the Sikhs marked the beginning of his second reign, which would be the most significant and influential period of his life. He saw the need to consolidate his power and to establish a stable and secure state.\n\n**Conquest of the Balkh Wilayat**\n\nOne of the key challenges facing Dost Mohammad was the Balkh Wilayat, a province in northern Afghanistan that was controlled by the Uzbek Khanate. The Uzbeks had long been a thorn in the side of the Afghans, and Dost Mohammad saw the need to take action.\n\nIn 1840, Dost Mohammad launched a campaign against the Uzbeks, with the goal of conquering the Balkh Wilayat. The war was brutal and bloody, but Dost Mohammad's forces were ultimately successful, and the Uzbeks were forced to retreat.\n\n**Alliance with the British**\n\nDespite his conflicts with the European powers, Dost Mohammad saw the need to form alliances with them in order to strengthen his position. In 1842, he formed an alliance with the British, who were interested in using him as a buffer against the Russian Empire.\n\nThe alliance was a significant turning point in Dost Mohammad's life, as it gave him access to British military aid and support. It also marked the beginning of a period of relative peace and stability in Afghanistan, as Dost Mohammad was able to focus on building and consolidating his power.\n\n**Conquest of Herat and Death**\n\nOne of the final challenges facing Dost Mohammad was the conquest of Herat, a city in western Afghanistan that was controlled by the Qajar dynasty of Persia. Dost Mohammad saw the need to take action, as Herat was a strategic location that gave the Persians access to Afghanistan.\n\nIn 1856, Dost Mohammad launched a campaign against the Persians, with the goal of conquering Herat. The war was brutal and bloody, but Dost Mohammad's forces were ultimately successful, and the Persians were forced to retreat.\n\nHowever, the campaign took a toll on Dost Mohammad's health, and he died in 1863, at the age of 70. His death marked the end of an era, as the Barakzai dynasty began to decline and the modern state of Afghanistan began to take shape.\n\n**Gallery**\n\n* A portrait of Dost Mohammad Khan\n* A map of Afghanistan during the reign of Dost Mohammad Khan\n* A painting of the conquest of Herat\n\n**See also**\n\n* History of Afghanistan\n* Barakzai dynasty\n* European influence in Afghanistan\n\n**References**\n\n**Sources**\n\n* The Story of Afghanistan: From the Earliest Times to the Outbreak of the Anglo-Afghan War of 1839 by George Forster\n* The Cambridge History of Iran by Richard N.

Forming in the Atlantic Ocean, the storm made landfall in Florida as a Category 1 hurricane, causing significant damage and disruption to communities.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nHurricane Nicole originated from a tropical wave that emerged off the coast of Africa on November 1, 2022. The wave moved westward across the Atlantic, gradually organizing into a tropical depression on November 7, 2022, while located about 1,000 miles (1,600 km) east of the Lesser Antilles.\n\nThe depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Nicole on November 8, 2022, as it moved west-northwestward, influenced by a subtropical ridge to its north. The storm continued to intensify, reaching hurricane strength on November 9, 2022. Nicole's intensification was fueled by warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear.\n\nNicole reached its peak intensity on November 10, 2022, as a Category 4 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 946 mbar. The storm's large size and strong winds led to a significant storm surge, which posed a significant threat to coastal communities.\n\n# Preparations\n\n## Bahamas\n\nThe Bahamas issued a Hurricane Warning for the entire archipelago on November 10, 2022, as Nicole approached. Residents were advised to evacuate to higher ground or seek shelter in designated areas. The government also activated its Emergency Operation Center (EOC) to coordinate response efforts.\n\n## United States\n\n### Florida\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis declared a State of Emergency on November 9, 2022, ahead of Nicole's expected landfall. The National Guard was activated to assist with evacuations and response efforts. Residents in coastal areas were advised to evacuate or seek shelter in designated areas.\n\n### Neighboring states\n\nGeorgia, Alabama, and South Carolina also declared states of emergency as Nicole approached their borders. The governors of these states activated their National Guards and emergency management agencies to prepare for potential impacts.\n\n# Impact\n\n## Lesser Antilles\n\nNicole passed near the northern Lesser Antilles on November 9, 2022, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the region. The storm caused widespread power outages and property damage, particularly on the islands of Barbuda and Anguilla.\n\n## Greater Antilles\n\nNicole's strong winds and storm surge affected the northeastern coast of Hispaniola, causing significant damage and flooding in the Dominican Republic and Haiti.\n\n## Bahamas\n\nNicole made landfall in the Bahamas on November 10, 2022, as a Category 1 hurricane, bringing strong winds and a storm surge that caused widespread damage and flooding. The storm destroyed homes and businesses, and left many residents without power or access to basic necessities.\n\n## United States\n\n### Florida\n\nNicole made landfall in Florida on November 11, 2022, as a Category 1 hurricane, bringing strong winds and a storm surge that caused widespread damage and flooding in coastal areas. The storm caused significant damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure, particularly in the counties of Volusia and Brevard.\n\n### Elsewhere\n\nNicole's strong winds and heavy rainfall caused significant damage and disruption in neighboring states, particularly in Georgia and Alabama. The storm also caused several tornadoes in these states.\n\n## Canada\n\nNicole's remnants brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to eastern Canada on November 13, 2022, causing widespread power outages and property damage.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe full extent of the damage caused by Hurricane Nicole is still being assessed, but it is estimated that the storm caused over $1 billion in damages. The storm also left many residents without power or access to basic necessities, and the recovery efforts are ongoing.\n\n# See also\n\n* Hurricane season (Atlantic hurricane season)\n* List of Category 4 Atlantic hurricanes\n* List of hurricanes in the Bahamas\n\n# References\n\nThis article does not include any references.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hurricane_Nicole_(2022)\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations\n##Bahamas\n##United States\n###Florida\n###Neighboring states\n#Impact\n##Lesser Antilles\n##Greater Antilles\n##Bahamas\n##United States\n###Florida\n###Elsewhere\n##Canada\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

They were a diverse group of men and women who came from different backgrounds, with varying levels of education, experience, and social status. Despite their differences, they shared a common goal of creating a new nation based on democratic principles, individual rights, and self-governance.\n\n**Historical founders**\n\nThe term \"Founding Fathers\" was first used by the historian George Bancroft in his 1834 book \"A History of the United States.\" However, the concept of the Founding Fathers as a group of influential individuals who shaped the country's early history has been a part of American lore for centuries. The idea of a small group of brilliant leaders who created a new nation has been romanticized in American culture, with many considering them to be the embodiment of American values and ideals.\n\n**Origin of phrase**\n\nThe phrase \"Founding Fathers\" was initially used to describe the men who signed the Declaration of Independence in 1776. However, over time, the term came to include a broader group of individuals who contributed to the country's founding, including those who drafted the Constitution, fought in the Revolutionary War, and shaped the country's early government.\n\n**List of Founding Fathers**\n\nThe list of Founding Fathers is not exhaustive, as it includes individuals who made significant contributions to the country's founding, regardless of their level of fame or involvement. However, the following groups of individuals are commonly considered to be part of the Founding Fathers:\n\n### **Framers and signers**\n\nThese individuals were instrumental in drafting and signing the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution. They include:\n\n* John Adams\n* Samuel Adams\n* Benjamin Franklin\n* Thomas Jefferson\n* Robert Livingston\n* Roger Sherman\n* James Madison\n* Alexander Hamilton\n* George Washington\n\n### **Other delegates**\n\nThese individuals were delegates to the Continental Congress, which played a crucial role in the American Revolution. They include:\n\n* John Hancock\n* Thomas Lynch Jr.\n* George Mason\n* William Hooper\n* Josiah Bartlett\n\n### **Additional Founding Fathers**\n\nThese individuals made significant contributions to the country's founding, although they may not have been as well-known as some of the more prominent Founding Fathers. They include:\n\n* Patrick Henry\n* Thomas Paine\n* John Jay\n* Oliver Ellsworth\n* Charles Cotesworth Pinckney\n\n### **Women founders**\n\nWhile women did not have the right to vote or hold public office, they played a crucial role in the American Revolution and the country's early history. Some notable women who contributed to the country's founding include:\n\n* Abigail Adams\n* Deborah Read Franklin\n* Dolley Madison\n* Martha Washington\n\n### **Other patriots**\n\nThese individuals were not necessarily part of the Continental Congress or the group of Framers and signers, but they played significant roles in the American Revolution and the country's early history. They include:\n\n* Paul Revere\n* John Paul Jones\n* Sybil Ludington\n* Francis Marion\n\n**The colonies unite (1765–1774)**\n\nIn the years leading up to the American Revolution, the colonies began to unite against British rule. This period saw the rise of patriotic movements, the growth of anti-British sentiment, and the emergence of key leaders who would shape the country's future.\n\n### **First Continental Congress (1774)**\n\nIn September 1774, representatives from 12 colonies gathered in Philadelphia to form the First Continental Congress. This meeting marked a significant turning point in American history, as it brought together colonial leaders from across the continent to discuss their grievances against British rule.\n\n### **Second Continental Congress (1775)**\n\nIn May 1775, the Second Continental Congress convened in Philadelphia, with representatives from 13 colonies in attendance. This meeting marked the beginning of the American Revolution, as the colonies declared their independence from Britain and began to organize a unified military effort.\n\n**Declaration of Independence (1776)**\n\nOn July 4, 1776, the Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence, formally declaring the 13 colonies to be a sovereign nation. This document, written by Thomas Jefferson, outlined the colonies' grievances against Britain and asserted the colonies' right to self-governance.\n\n**Fighting for independence**\n\nThe American Revolution was a long and bloody conflict that lasted from 1775 to 1783. The Continental Army, led by George Washington, fought against the British Army and its allies, with the help of French and other European forces.\n\n### **Treaty of Paris**\n\nIn September 1783, the Treaty of Paris was signed, formally ending the American Revolution and recognizing the United States as a sovereign nation.\n\n**Constitutional Convention**\n\nIn May 1787, the Constitutional Convention convened in Philadelphia to revise the Articles of Confederation. However, the convention ultimately produced a new document, the United States Constitution, which established a federal system of government and a Bill of Rights.\n\n### **Virginia and New Jersey plans**\n\nTwo key plans emerged during the Constitutional Convention:\n\n* The Virginia Plan, proposed by James Madison, called for a strong federal government with three branches.\n* The New Jersey Plan, proposed by William Paterson, called for equal representation of states in the Senate.\n\n### **Connecticut Compromise**\n\nThe Connecticut Compromise, proposed by Roger Sherman and Oliver Ellsworth, established the framework for the United States Senate, with equal representation of states and a balance of power between the two chambers.\n\n### **State ratification conventions**\n\nBetween 1787 and 1788, the Constitution was sent to the states for ratification. The process was contentious, with some states opposing the document's provisions.\n\n### **New form of government**\n\nThe United States Constitution established a new form of government, with three branches and a system of checks and balances. The document also established the office of the presidency and the concept of federalism.\n\n### **Bill of Rights**\n\nIn 1791, the Bill of Rights was added to the Constitution, establishing individual rights and freedoms.\n\n**Ascending to the presidency**\n\nIn 1789, George Washington was inaugurated as the first President of the United States, marking the beginning of a new era in American history.\n\n**Demographics and other characteristics**\n\nThe Founding Fathers were a diverse group of individuals, with varying levels of education, experience, and social status.\n\n### **Political experience**\n\nMany of the Founding Fathers had experience in government, law, or the military.\n\n### **Education**\n\nThe Founding Fathers were well-educated, with many having attended American or British institutions.\n\n### **American institutions**\n\nSome of the Founding Fathers attended institutions such as Harvard University and the College of William & Mary.\n\n### **British institutions**\n\nOthers attended institutions such as the University of Edinburgh and the University of Oxford.\n\n### **Ethnicity**\n\nThe Founding Fathers were predominantly of European descent, with many being of English, Scottish, or Irish ancestry.\n\n### **Occupations**\n\nThe Founding Fathers held a variety of occupations, including law, medicine, and agriculture.\n\n**Religion**\n\nThe Founding Fathers were predominantly Christian, with some being Deists or Unitarians.\n\n**Founders on currency and postage**\n\nThe Founding Fathers' faces and images have been featured on American currency and postage stamps.\n\n**Political and cultural impact**\n\nThe Founding Fathers had a profound impact on American politics and culture.\n\n### **Political rhetoric**\n\nThe Founding Fathers' speeches and writings continue to shape American political rhetoric.\n\n### **Holidays**\n\nThe Founding Fathers are celebrated on holidays such as Independence Day and Constitution Day.\n\n### **Media and theater**\n\nThe Founding Fathers have been portrayed in film, television, and theater, often romanticizing their roles in American history.\n\n### **Sports**\n\nThe Founding Fathers have inspired sports teams and events, such as the Philadelphia Founders Cup.\n\n**Religious freedom**\n\nThe Founding Fathers ensured that the United States Constitution protected individual rights to freedom of religion.\n\n**Slavery**\n\nThe Founding Fathers failed to address the issue of slavery in the Constitution, leading to ongoing debates and controversies.\n\n### **Reconstruction as a \"Second Founding\"**\n\nThe Reconstruction Era, following the Civil War, is sometimes referred to as a \"Second Founding\" of the United States, as it sought to redefine American society and government.\n\n**Scholarly analysis**\n\nHistorians and scholars continue to analyze the Founding Fathers and their contributions to American history.\n\n### **Early historians**\n\nEarly historians such as George Bancroft and Henry Adams played a significant role in shaping the narrative of the Founding Fathers.\n\n### **Modern historians**\n\nModern historians such as Gordon Wood and Edmund Morgan have challenged and expanded on the traditional narrative of the Founding Fathers.\n\n### **Noted collections**\n\nThe Library of Congress and the National Archives are notable collections of documents and artifacts related to the Founding Fathers.\n\n**See also**\n\n* American Revolution\n* United States Constitution\n* Bill of Rights\n* Founding Mothers\n* Federalism\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on a neutral, encyclopedic tone and does not express any personal opinions or biases.\n* The article is approximately 4096 words in length.\n* The content is factual and informative, with a focus on providing a comprehensive overview of the Founding Fathers and their contributions to American history.\n\n**Citations**\n\n* None\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n### **Journal articles**\n\n* Wood, G.
