This format was a departure from the previous series, which had a more episodic structure. The six episodes are:\n\n1. \"The Halloween Apocalypse\"\n2. \"War of the Sontarans\"\n3. \"Once, Upon Time\"\n4. \"Village of the Angels\"\n5. \"Survivors of the Flux\"\n6. \"The Vanquishers\"\n\n**Casting**\n\nThe series features Jodie Whittaker as the Thirteenth Doctor, reprising her role from the previous series.

He is known for his clutch shooting and ability to score in high-pressure situations.\n\nEarly life\n\nIsaiah Thomas was born on February 7, 1989, to James Thomas and Tina Baldtrip. As a child, he had the nicknames \"Bighead\" (or Head) from his father and \"Zeke\" (which was Isiah Thomas's nickname) from his mother. Thomas was born and raised in Tacoma, Washington. His father, James, was a lifelong Los Angeles Lakers fan, and he made a bet with a friend that if his beloved team did not defeat the Detroit Pistons in the 1989 NBA Finals, he would name his son after Pistons star and decorated Lakers nemesis Isiah Thomas. Thomas was born months before the finals took place, but his father had warmed to the name, and his mother, Tina, consented on the condition that the Biblical spelling of Isaiah was utilized.\n\nHigh school career\n\nThomas attended Curtis Senior High School in University Place, Washington, through 11th grade. As his grades had to improve to earn a scholarship, Thomas repeated his senior year across the country at South Kent School in South Kent, Connecticut. Thomas graduated from the Connecticut prep school in 2008. At Curtis High, playing for the varsity basketball team, Thomas had averaged 31.2 points per game as a junior. On April 20, 2006, he called a news briefing to announce his intention to sign with the University of Washington.\n\nCollege career\n\nThomas received the blessing of Nate Robinson, the former Washington Huskies star, to wear his No 2 jersey. Thomas scored a season-high 27 points in an 81–67 home victory over Morgan State on December 30, 2008.\n\nProfessional career\n\nBefore the 2011 NBA draft, Thomas participated in his own pre-draft documentary entitled \"Road to the NBA–The Isaiah Thomas Story.\" Thomas was selected in the second round of the 2011 NBA draft with the 60th and final pick by the Sacramento Kings. On February 19, 2012, he recorded his first double-double with 23 points and 11 assists against the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nSacramento Kings (2011–2014)\n\nBefore the 2011 NBA draft, Thomas participated in his own pre-draft documentary entitled \"Road to the NBA–The Isaiah Thomas Story.\" Thomas was selected in the second round of the 2011 NBA draft with the 60th and final pick by the Sacramento Kings. On February 19, 2012, he recorded his first double-double with 23 points and 11 assists against the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nPhoenix Suns (2014–2015)\n\nOn July 12, 2014, Thomas was acquired by the Phoenix Suns in a sign-and-trade deal that also sent the rights of Alex Oriakhi to the Kings. On August 14, Thomas underwent a successful arthroscopy of his left wrist, for an injury sustained the previous season. Thomas made his debut for the Suns in their victorious 119–99 season opener over the Los Angeles Lakers, in which he recorded 23 points.\n\nBoston Celtics (2015–2017)\n\nOn February 19, 2015, Thomas was traded to the Boston Celtics in exchange for Marcus Thornton and a 2016 first-round pick. During his Celtics tenure, Thomas emerged as a star, a fan favorite, and an \"elite crunch-time scorer.\"\n\nCleveland Cavaliers (2017–2018)\n\nOn August 22, 2017, Thomas was traded, along with Jae Crowder, Ante Žižić, and the Brooklyn Nets' unprotected 2018 first-round draft pick, to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Kyrie Irving. However, during the post-trade physical examination by Cleveland staff, concerns were raised about the health of Thomas's previously injured right hip. As a result, eight days after the deal was announced, the Celtics agreed to send the Cavaliers a 2020 second-round draft pick via the Miami Heat to complete the trade. In September 2017, TheAthletic.com reported that Thomas had been playing with a number of secondary issues in his right hip, such as a loss of cartilage and some arthritis, for several seasons. Thomas opted to pursue rehabilitation rather than surgery for the hip because he believed that the lengthy post-surgery recovery period would cause teams to be less willing to offer him large contracts during his upcoming free agency.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers (2018)\n\nOn February 8, 2018, the Cavaliers traded Thomas, Channing Frye, and a 2018 first-round draft pick to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr. In his Lakers debut two days later, Thomas scored 22 points off the bench in a 130–123 loss to the Dallas Mavericks. On March 1, he scored a season-high 29 points in a 131–113 victory over the Miami Heat. On March 29, Thomas was ruled out for the rest of the season after undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his right hip. In 17 games for the Lakers, he averaged 15.6 points per game on 38.3% shooting.\n\nDenver Nuggets (2018–2019)\n\nOn July 16, 2018, Thomas signed a one-year deal with the Denver Nuggets for a veteran's minimum contract of $2 million. After his recovery from hip surgery, Thomas made his debut for the Nuggets on February 13, 2019, scoring all eight of his points in the third quarter of Denver's 120–118 victory over the Sacramento Kings. It was his first game since March 22, 2018. In the 12 games Thomas played for Denver, he averaged 8.1 points per game on 34.3% shooting.\n\nWashington Wizards (2019–2020)\n\nOn July 10, 2019, Thomas signed with the Washington Wizards.

In 40 games with the Wizards, he averaged 12.2 points per game on 40.8% shooting and 41.3% shooting from beyond the three-point arc.\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans (2021)\n\nOn April 3, 2021, Thomas signed a 10-day contract with the New Orleans Pelicans. In three games with the Pelicans, he averaged 7.7 points per game.\n\nGrand Rapids Gold (2021)\n\nOn December 13, 2021, Thomas signed with the Grand Rapids Gold of the NBA G League. He made his debut for the team on December 15, scoring 42 points, eight assists, and six rebounds in 42 minutes during a 131–127 loss to the Fort Wayne Mad Ants.\n\nReturn to the Lakers (2021)\n\nOn December 17, 2021, Thomas signed a 10-day contract with the Los Angeles Lakers to return to the franchise for a second time after the team was granted a hardship exception. In his season debut, Thomas scored 19 points in 22 minutes in a loss against the Minnesota Timberwolves. He played four games for the Lakers.\n\nDallas Mavericks (2021–2022)\n\nOn December 29, 2021, Thomas signed a 10-day contract with the Dallas Mavericks. He only played in one game for the Mavericks.\n\nReturn to the Gold (2022)\n\nOn February 14, 2022, Thomas was re-acquired by the Grand Rapids Gold. By the end of his time there, Thomas averaged 41.3 points per game across three games.\n\nCharlotte Hornets (2022)\n\nOn March 2, 2022, Thomas signed a 10-day contract with the Charlotte Hornets and ten days later, he signed a second 10-day contract. On March 22, Thomas was signed for the rest of the season. In 17 games with the Hornets, he averaged 8.3 points per game on 43.3% shooting and 39.7% shooting from beyond the three-point line.\n\nSalt Lake City Stars (2024)\n\nOn March 6, 2024, Thomas joined the Salt Lake City Stars. In his debut for the Stars, Thomas recorded 32 points and four assists on 7-for-23 shooting from the field. He averaged 32.5 points and 5.3 assists per game across 4 games.\n\nReturn to the Suns (2024)\n\nOn March 20, 2024, Thomas signed a 10-day contract with the Phoenix Suns. Later that day, he played in his first NBA game in nearly two years against the Philadelphia 76ers, logging one assist in two minutes played. On March 30, Thomas signed a second 10-day contract with the Suns. He signed with the Suns for the remainder of the season on April 9.\n\nNational team career\n\nIn April 2018, Thomas was selected to the 35-player 2018–20 USA men's national team roster and attended the team's Las Vegas minicamp in July 2018. In February 2021, he was selected to the 14-player roster for the final round of the 2022 FIBA AmeriCup qualifiers. On February 19, in his first competitive game in over a year, Thomas scored 19 points in a 93–77 victory over Bahamas. He followed it up the day after by scoring nine points, all in the first quarter, in a 96–75 victory against Mexico.\n\nCareer statistics\n\nThomas's sister, Chyna, died in a one-car accident on

{"title": "Constitution_of_India", "content": "\nBackground\nIn 1928, the All Parties Conference convened a committee in Lucknow to prepare the Constitution of India, which was known as the Nehru Report [13]\n\n\nPrevious legislation\nThe constitution was drawn from a number of sources Mindful of India's needs and conditions, its framers borrowed features of previous legislation such as the Government of India Act 1858, the Indian Councils Acts of 1861, 1892 and 1909, the Government of India Acts 1919 and 1935, and the Indian Independence Act 1947 The latter, which led to the creation of Pakistan, divided the former Constituent Assembly in two The Amendment act of 1935 is also a very important step for making the constitution for two new born countries Each new assembly had sovereign power to draft and enact a new constitution for the separate states [16]\n\n\nConstituent Assembly\nThe constitution was drafted by the Constituent Assembly, which was elected by elected members of the provincial assemblies [17] The 389-member assembly (reduced to 299 after the partition of India) took almost three years to draft the constitution holding eleven sessions over a 165-day period [4] [16]\n\n\nTimeline of formation of the Constitution of India\nG V Mavlankar was the first Speaker of the Lok Sabha (the lower house of Parliament) after India turned into a republic [31]\n\n\nMembership\nB R Ambedkar, Sanjay Phakey, Jawaharlal Nehru, C Rajagopalachari, Rajendra Prasad, Vallabhbhai Patel, Kanaiyalal Maneklal Munshi, Ganesh Vasudev Mavalankar, Sandipkumar Patel, Abul Kalam Azad, Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Nalini Ranjan Ghosh, and Balwantrai Mehta were key figures in the assembly, [4] [16] which had over 30 representatives of the scheduled classes Frank Anthony represented the Anglo-Indian community, [4] and the Parsis were represented by H P Modi [4] Harendra Coomar Mookerjee, a Christian assembly vice-president, chaired the minorities committee and represented non-Anglo-Indian Christians [4] Ari Bahadur Gurung represented the Gorkha community [4] Judges, such as Alladi Krishnaswamy Iyer, Benegal Narsing Rau, K M Munshi and Ganesh Mavlankar were members of the assembly [4] Female members included Sarojini Naidu, Hansa Mehta, Durgabai Deshmukh, Amrit Kaur and Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit [4]\n\n\nDrafting\nSir B N Rau, a civil servant who became the first Indian judge in the International Court of Justice and was president of the United Nations Security Council, was appointed as the assembly's constitutional adviser in 1946 [33] Responsible for the constitution's general structure, Rau prepared its initial draft in February 1948 [33] [34] [35] The draft of B.N Rau consisted of 243 articles and 13 schedules which came to 395 articles and 8 schedules after discussions, debates and amendments [36]\n\n\nInfluence of other constitutions\nThe Indian constitution is the world's longest for a sovereign nation [4] [5] [6] At its enactment, it had 395 articles in 22 parts and 8 schedules [a] [16] At about 145,000 words, it is the second-longest active constitution—after the Constitution of Alabama—in the world [47]\n\n\nStructure\nThe Indian constitution is the world's longest for a sovereign nation [4] [5] [6] At its enactment, it had 395 articles in 22 parts and 8 schedules [a] [16] At about 145,000 words, it is the second-longest active constitution—after the Constitution of Alabama—in the world [47]\n\n\nSchedules\nSchedules are lists in the constitution which categorise and tabulate bureaucratic activity and government policy.\n\n\nAppendices\n\n\n\nGovernmental sources of power\nThe executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government receive their power from the constitution and are bound by it [54] With the aid of its constitution, India is governed by a parliamentary system of government with the executive directly accountable to the legislature.\n\n\nThe legislature and amendments\nArticle 368 dictates the procedure for constitutional amendments Amendments are additions, variations or repeal of any part of the constitution by Parliament [59] An amendment bill must be passed by each house of Parliament by a two-thirds majority of its total membership when at least two-thirds are present and vote Certain amendments pertaining to the constitution's federal nature must also be ratified by a majority of state legislatures.\n\n\nLimitations\nIn Kesavananda Bharati v State of Kerala, the Supreme Court ruled that an amendment cannot destroy what it seeks to modify; it cannot tinker with the constitution's basic structure or framework, which are immutable Such an amendment will be declared invalid, although no part of the constitution is protected from amendment; the basic structure doctrine does not protect any one provision of the constitution According to the doctrine, the constitution's basic features (when \"read as a whole\") cannot be abridged or abolished These \"basic features\" have not been fully defined, [54] and whether a particular provision of the constitution is a \"basic feature\" is decided by the courts [61]\n\n\nThe judiciary\nThe judiciary is the final arbiter of the constitution [64] Its duty (mandated by the constitution) is to act as a watchdog, preventing any legislative or executive act from overstepping constitutional bounds [65] The judiciary protects the fundamental rights of the people (enshrined in the constitution) from infringement by any state body, and balances the conflicting exercise of power between the central government and a state (or states).\n\n\nJudicial review\nJudicial review was adopted by the constitution of India from judicial review in the United States [69] In the Indian constitution, judicial review is dealt with in Article 13 The constitution is the supreme power of the nation, and governs all laws According to Article 13:\n\n\nThe executive\nChapter 1 of the Constitution of India creates a parliamentary system, with a Prime Minister who, in practice, exercises most executive power The prime minister must have the support of a majority of the members of the Lok Sabha, or lower House of Parliament If the Prime Minister does not have the support of a majority, the Lok Sabha can pass a motion of no confidence, removing the Prime Minister from office Thus the Prime Minister is the member of parliament who leads the majority party or a coalition comprising a majority [74] The Prime Minister governs with the aid of a Council of Ministers, which the Prime Minister appoints and whose members head ministries Importantly, Article 75 establishes that \"the Council of Ministers shall be collectively responsible to the House of the People\" or Lok Sabha [75] The Lok Sabha interprets this article to mean that the entire Council of Ministers can be subjected to a no confidence motion [76] If a no confidence motion succeeds, the entire Council of Ministers must resign.\n\n\nDismissal of the Prime Minister\nDespite the President's mandate to obey the advice of the Prime Minister and the council, Article 75 declares that both \"shall hold office during the pleasure of the President.\" [75] This means the President has the constitutional power to dismiss the Prime Minister or Council at anytime If the Prime Minister still retained a majority vote in the Lok Sabha, however, this could trigger a constitutional crisis because the same article of the Constitution states that the Council of Ministers is responsible to the Lok Sabha and must command a majority in it In practice the issue has never arisen, though President Zail Singh threatened to remove Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi from office in 1987 [84]\n\n\nPresidential power to legislate\nWhen either or both Houses of Parliament are not in session, the Prime Minister, acting via the President, can unilaterally exercise the legislative power, creating ordinances that have the force of law These ordinances expire six weeks after Parliament reconvenes or sooner if both Houses disapprove [85] The Constitution declares that ordinances should only be issued when circumstances arise that require \"immediate action.\" Because this term is not defined, governments have begun abusing the ordinance system to enact laws that could not pass both Houses of Parliament, according to some commentators [86] This appears to be more common with divided government; when the Prime Minister's party controls the lower house but not the upper house, ordinances can be used to avoid needing the approval of the opposition in the upper house In recent years, around ten ordinances have been passed annually, though at the peak of their use, over 30 were passed in a single year [87] Ordinances can vary widely on their topic; recent examples of ordinances include items as varied as modifications to land owner rights, emergency responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, and changes to banking regulations [87] [88]\n\n\nFederalism\nThe first article of the Constitution declares that India is a \"Union of States\" [89] Under the Constitution, the States retain key powers for themselves and have a strong influence over the national government via the Rajya Sabha However, the Constitution does provide key limits on their powers and gives final say in many cases to the national government.\n\n\nState powers in the Constitution\nAt the Union level, the States are represented in the Rajya Sabha or Council of States The Fourth Schedule of the Constitution lays out the number of seats that each State controls in the Council of States, and they are based roughly on each State's population [90] The members of each state legislature elect and appoint these representatives in the Council of States [91] On most topics the Rajya Sabha is coequal with the lower house or Lok Sabha, and its consent is required for a bill to become a law [92] Additionally, as one of the Houses of Parliament, any amendment to the Constitution requires a two-thirds majority in the Rajya Sabha to go into effect [93] These provisions allow the States significant impact on national politics through their representation in the \"federal chamber\" [90]\n\n\nRajya Sabha\nAt the Union level, the States are represented in the Rajya Sabha or Council of States The Fourth Schedule of the Constitution

one of the Houses of Parliament, any amendment to the Constitution requires a two-thirds majority in the Rajya Sabha to go into effect [93] These provisions allow the States significant impact on national politics through their representation in the \"federal chamber\" [90]\n\n\nState List\nThe Constitution provides the States with a long list of powers exclusive to their jurisdiction [90] Generally only State Legislatures are capable of passing laws implementing these powers; the Union government is prohibited from doing so These powers are contained in the second list of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, known as the State List The areas on the State List are wide-ranging and include topics like public health and order and a variety of taxes The State List grants the states control over the police, healthcare, agriculture, elections, and more [94]\n\n\nAmendments\nIn addition to exerting influence over the amendment process via the Rajya Sabha, the States are sometimes involved in the amendment process This special, entrenched process is triggered when an amendment to the Constitution specifically concerns the States by modifying the legislature or the powers reserved to the states in the Seventh Schedule When this occurs, an amendment must be ratified by a majority of state legislatures for the amendment to go into effect [93]\n\n\nLimitations on state powers\nWhile the State List mentioned above provides powers for the States, there are two other lists in the Seventh Schedule that generally weaken them These are the Union and Concurrent lists The Union List is the counterpart to the State List, containing the areas of exclusive jurisdiction of the Union government, where the states are prohibited from legislating [95] Items on the Union List include the national defense, international relations, immigration, banking, and interstate commerce [94]\n\n\nUnion and Concurrent Lists\nWhile the State List mentioned above provides powers for the States, there are two other lists in the Seventh Schedule that generally weaken them These are the Union and Concurrent lists The Union List is the counterpart to the State List, containing the areas of exclusive jurisdiction of the Union government, where the states are prohibited from legislating [95] Items on the Union List include the national defense, international relations, immigration, banking, and interstate commerce [94]\n\n\nAppointment of governors\nThe Governor of each State is given the executive power of the respective State by the Constitution [98] These Governors are appointed directly by the President of the central government Because the Prime Minister acts via the President, the Prime Minister is the one who chooses the Governors in practice [99] Once appointed, a Governor serves for a five-year term or can be replaced by the President at any time, if asked to do so by the Prime Minister [100] Because the Union government can remove a Governor at any time, it is possible that Governors may act in a way the Union Government wants, to the detriment of their state, so that they can maintain their office This has become a larger issue as the State Legislatures are often controlled by different parties than that of the Union Prime Minister, unlike the early years of the constitution [101] For example, Governors have used stalling tactics to delay giving their assent to legislation that the Union Government disapproves of [102]\n\n\nCreation of states\nPerhaps the most direct power over the States is the Union's ability to unilaterally create new states out of territories or existing states and to modify and diminish the boundaries of existing states [105] To do so, Parliament must pass a simple law with no supermajority requirements The States involved do not have a say on the outcome but the State Legislature must be asked to comment [106] The most recent state to be created was Telangana in 2014 [107] More recently, Ladakh was created as a new Union Territory after being split off from Jammu and Kashmir in 2019, and Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli were combined into a single Union Territory in 2020 [108] [109] The former was particularly opposed by some e.g Arundhati Roy In her opinion, Jammu and Kashmir was a full state, and the legislation creating Ladakh stripped the area of its status as a state and downgraded it to a Union Territory, allowing the Union Government to directly control it This required no input from Jammu and Kashmir [110]\n\n\nFederalism and the courts\nWhile the states have separate legislative and executive branches, they share the judiciary with the Union government This is different from other federal court systems, such as the United States, where state courts mainly apply state law and federal courts mainly apply federal law [111] Under the Indian constitution, the High Courts of the States are directly constituted by the national constitution The constitution also allows states to set up lower courts under and controlled by the state's High Court [112] [113] Cases heard at or appealed to the High Courts can be furter appealed to the Supreme Court of India in some cases [114] All cases, whether dealing with federal or state laws, move up the same judicial hierarchy, creating a system sometimes termed integrated federalism [111]\n\n\nInternational law\nThe Constitution includes treaty making as part of the executive power given to the President [115] Because the President must act in accordance with the advice of the Council of Ministers, the Prime Minister is the chief party responsible for making international treaties in the Constitution Because the legislative power rests with Parliament, the President's signature on an international agreement does not bring it into effect domestically or enable courts to enforce its provisions Article 253 of the Constitution bestows this power on Parliament, enabling it to make laws necessary for implementing international agreements and treaties [116] These provisions indicate that the Constitution of India is dualist, that is, treaty law only takes effect when a domestic law passed using the normal processes incorporates it into domestic law [117]\n\n\nFlexibility\nAccording to Granville Austin, \"The Indian constitution is first and foremost a social document, and is aided by its Parts III & IV (Fundamental Rights & Directive Principles of State Policy, respectively) acting together, as its chief instruments and its conscience, in realising the goals set by it for all the people.\" [h] [120] The constitution has deliberately been worded in generalities (not in vague terms) to ensure its flexibility [121] John Marshall, the fourth chief justice of the United States, said that a constitution's \"great outlines should be marked, its important objects designated, and the minor ingredients which compose those objects be deduced from the nature of the objects themselves.\" [122] A document \"intended to endure for ages to come\", [123] it must be interpreted not only based on the intention and understanding of its framers, but in the existing social and political context.\n\n\nTranslations into Indian languages\nThe Constitution of India is translated into only a few of the 22 scheduled languages of the Indian Republic.\n\n\nHindi

Lucknow, which was known as the Nehru Report. This initial draft was prepared to serve as a guiding document for the future government of India. However, it was not until 1947 that the Constitution was officially adopted, following India's independence from British colonial rule.\n\n## Previous Legislation\n\nThe Constitution of India was drawn from a number of previous legislative sources, including the Government of India Act 1858, the Indian Councils Acts of 1861, 1892, and 1909, the Government of India Acts 1919 and 1935, and the Indian Independence Act 1947. These earlier acts and laws provided a foundation for the Constitution, but they also presented challenges and limitations that the framers of the Constitution sought to address.\n\n## Constituent Assembly\n\nThe Constituent Assembly was elected by the members of the provincial assemblies and was responsible for drafting the Constitution. The 389-member assembly, which was reduced to 299 after the partition of India, took almost three years to draft the Constitution, holding eleven sessions over a 165-day period. The assembly included key figures such as B R Ambedkar, Jawaharlal Nehru, C Rajagopalachari, Rajendra Prasad, and Vallabhbhai Patel, who played crucial roles in shaping the Constitution.\n\n## Timeline of Formation\n\nThe Constituent Assembly began its work on December 9, 1946, and it took almost three years to complete the draft. The final draft was adopted on November 26, 1949, and it came into effect on January 26, 1950. G V Mavlankar was the first Speaker of the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament, after India became a republic.\n\n## Membership\n\nThe Constituent Assembly had over 30 representatives of the scheduled classes, including Frank Anthony, who represented the Anglo-Indian community, and H P Modi, who represented the Parsi community. Harendra Coomar Mookerjee, a Christian assembly vice-president, chaired the minorities committee and represented non-Anglo-Indian Christians. Ari Bahadur Gurung represented the Gorkha community, and judges such as Alladi Krishnaswamy Iyer, Benegal Narsing Rau, and K M Munshi were members of the assembly. Female members included Sarojini Naidu, Hansa Mehta, Durgabai Deshmukh, Amrit Kaur, and Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit.\n\n## Drafting\n\nSir B N Rau, a civil servant and the first Indian judge in the International Court of Justice, was appointed as the assembly's constitutional adviser in 1946. He prepared the initial draft of the Constitution in February 1948, which consisted of 243 articles and 13 schedules. The draft was later discussed, debated, and amended to its final form, which consisted of 395 articles and 8 schedules.\n\n## Influence of Other Constitutions\n\nThe Indian Constitution is the world's longest for a sovereign nation, with 395 articles in 22 parts and 8 schedules. At approximately 145,000 words, it is the second-longest active constitution in the world, after the Constitution of Alabama.\n\n## Structure\n\nThe Indian Constitution is divided into 22 parts, with 395 articles and 8 schedules. The Constitution is a social document that aims to promote social and economic justice, individual rights, and equality. It also establishes the framework for the government of India, including the structure of the government, the powers of the President and the Prime Minister, and the relationship between the government and the citizens.\n\n## Schedules\n\nThe schedules of the Constitution are lists that categorize and tabulate bureaucratic activity and government policy. The Constitution has eight schedules, which provide details on various aspects of the government, including the powers of the President, the structure of the government, and the relationship between the government and the citizens.\n\n## Appendices\n\nThe Constitution has appendices that provide additional information on various aspects of the government, including the powers of the President, the structure of the government, and the relationship between the government and the citizens.\n\n## Governmental Sources of Power\n\nThe executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government receive their power from the Constitution and are bound by it. The Constitution provides for a parliamentary system of government, with the executive directly accountable to the legislature. The legislature and the executive are separate and distinct, with the legislature having the power to make laws and the executive having the power to enforce them.\n\n## The Legislature and Amendments\n\nArticle 368 of the Constitution dictates the procedure for constitutional amendments. Amendments are additions, variations, or repeal of any part of the Constitution by Parliament. An amendment bill must be passed by each house of Parliament by a two-thirds majority of its total membership when at least two-thirds are present and vote. Certain amendments pertaining to the Constitution's federal nature must also be ratified by a majority of state legislatures.\n\n## Limitations\n\nThe Supreme Court has ruled that an amendment cannot destroy what it seeks to modify; it cannot tinker with the Constitution's basic structure or framework, which are immutable. Such an amendment will be declared invalid, although no part of the Constitution is protected from amendment. The basic structure doctrine does not protect any one provision of the Constitution. According to the doctrine, the Constitution's basic features (when \"read as a whole\") cannot be abridged or abolished.\n\n## The Judiciary\n\nThe judiciary is the final arbiter of the Constitution. Its duty is to act as a watchdog, preventing any legislative or executive act from overstepping constitutional bounds. The judiciary protects the fundamental rights of the people (enshrined in the Constitution) from infringement by any state body, and balances the conflicting exercise of power between the central government and a state (or states).\n\n## Judicial Review\n\nJudicial review was adopted by the Constitution of India from judicial review in the United States. In the Indian Constitution, judicial review is dealt with in Article 13. The Constitution is the supreme power of the nation, and governs all laws. According to Article 13:\n\n## The Executive\n\nChapter 1 of the Constitution creates a parliamentary system, with a Prime Minister who, in practice, exercises most executive power. The Prime Minister must have the support of a majority of the members of the Lok Sabha, or lower House of Parliament. If the Prime Minister does not have the support of a majority, the Lok Sabha can pass a motion of no confidence, removing the Prime Minister from office. Thus, the Prime Minister is the member of Parliament who leads the majority party or a coalition comprising a majority.\n\n## Dismissal of the Prime Minister\n\nDespite the President's mandate to obey the advice of the Prime Minister and the Council, Article 75 declares that both \"shall hold office during the pleasure of the President.\" This means the President has the constitutional power to dismiss the Prime Minister or Council at any time. If the Prime Minister still retained a majority vote in the Lok Sabha, however, this could trigger a constitutional crisis because the same article of the Constitution states that the Council of Ministers is responsible to the Lok Sabha and must command a majority in it.\n\n## Presidential Power to Legislate\n\nWhen either or both Houses of Parliament are not in session, the Prime Minister, acting via the President, can unilaterally exercise the legislative power, creating ordinances that have the force of law. These ordinances expire six weeks after Parliament reconvenes or sooner if both Houses disapprove. The Constitution declares that ordinances should only be issued when circumstances arise that require \"immediate action.\" Because this term is not defined, governments have begun abusing the ordinance system to enact laws that could not pass both Houses of Parliament.\n\n## Federalism\n\nThe first article of the Constitution declares that India is a \"Union of States.\" Under the Constitution, the States retain key powers for themselves and have a strong influence over the national government via the Rajya Sabha.

Items on the Union List include the national defense, international relations, immigration, banking, and interstate commerce.\n\n## Union and Concurrent Lists\n\nThe Constitution provides the Union government with exclusive jurisdiction over certain areas, including national defense, international relations, immigration, banking, and interstate commerce. The States are prohibited from legislating on these topics, and the Union List is the counterpart to the State List.\n\n## Appointment of Governors\n\nThe Governor of each State is given the executive power of the respective State by the Constitution.

latter, which led to the creation of Pakistan, divided the former Constituent Assembly in two The Amendment act of 1935 is also a very important step for making the constitution for two new born

words, it is the second-longest active constitution—after the Constitution of Alabama—in the world [47]\n\n\nSchedules\nSchedules are lists in the constitution which categorise and tabulate bureaucratic activity and government policy.\n\n\nAppendices\n\n\n\nGovernmental sources of power\nThe executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government receive their power from the constitution and are bound by it [54] With the aid of its constitution, India is governed by a parliamentary system of government with the executive directly accountable to the legislature.\n\n\nThe legislature and amendments\nArticle 368 dictates the procedure for constitutional amendments Amendments are additions, variations or repeal of any part of the constitution by Parliament [59] An amendment bill must be passed by each house of Parliament by a two-thirds majority of its total membership when at least two-thirds are present and vote Certain amendments pertaining to the constitution's federal nature must also be ratified by a majority of state legislatures.\n\n\nLimitations\nIn Kesavananda Bharati v State of Kerala, the Supreme Court ruled that an amendment cannot destroy what it seeks to modify; it cannot tinker with the constitution's basic structure or framework, which are immutable Such an amendment will be declared invalid, although no part of the constitution is protected from amendment; the basic structure doctrine does not protect any one provision of the constitution According to the doctrine, the constitution's basic features (when \"read as a whole\") cannot be abridged or abolished These \"basic features\" have not been fully defined, [54] and whether a particular provision of the constitution is a \"basic feature\" is decided by the courts [61]\n\n\nThe judiciary\nThe judiciary is the final arbiter of the constitution [64] Its duty (mandated by the constitution) is to act as a watchdog, preventing any legislative or executive act from overstepping constitutional bounds [65] The judiciary protects the fundamental rights of the people (enshrined in the constitution) from infringement by any state body, and balances the conflicting exercise of power between the central government and a state (or states).\n\n\nJudicial review\nJudicial review was adopted by the constitution of India from judicial review in the United States [69] In the Indian constitution, judicial review is dealt with in Article 13 The constitution is the supreme power of the nation, and governs all laws According to Article 13:\n\n\nThe executive\nChapter 1 of the Constitution of India creates a parliamentary system, with a Prime Minister who, in practice, exercises most executive power The prime minister must have the support of a majority of the members of the Lok Sabha, or lower House of Parliament If the Prime Minister does not have the support of a majority, the Lok Sabha can pass a motion of no confidence, removing the Prime Minister from office Thus the Prime Minister is the member of parliament who leads the majority party or a coalition comprising a majority [74] The Prime Minister governs with the aid of a Council of Ministers, which the Prime Minister appoints and whose members head ministries Importantly, Article 75 establishes that \"the Council of Ministers shall be collectively responsible to the House of the People\" or Lok Sabha [75] The Lok Sabha interprets this article to mean that the entire Council of Ministers can be subjected to a no confidence motion [76] If a no confidence motion succeeds, the entire Council of Ministers must resign.\n\n\nDismissal of the Prime Minister\nDespite the President's mandate to obey the advice of the Prime Minister and the council, Article 75 declares that both \"shall hold office during the pleasure of the President.\" [75] This means the President has the constitutional power to dismiss the Prime Minister or Council at anytime If the Prime Minister still retained a majority vote in the Lok Sabha, however, this could trigger a constitutional crisis because the same article of the Constitution states that the Council of Ministers is responsible to the Lok Sabha and must command a majority in it In practice the issue has never arisen, though President Zail Singh threatened to remove Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi from office in 1987 [84]\n\n\nPresidential power to legislate\nWhen either or both Houses of Parliament are not in session, the Prime Minister, acting via the President, can unilaterally exercise the legislative power, creating ordinances that have the force of law These ordinances expire six weeks after Parliament reconvenes or sooner if both Houses disapprove [85] The Constitution declares that ordinances should only be issued when circumstances arise that require \"immediate action.\" Because this term is not defined, governments have begun abusing the ordinance system to enact laws that could not pass both Houses of Parliament, according to some commentators [86] This appears to be more common with divided government; when the Prime Minister's party controls the lower house but not the upper house, ordinances can be used to avoid needing the approval of the opposition in the upper house In recent years, around ten ordinances have been passed annually, though at the peak of their use, over 30 were passed in a single year [87] Ordinances can vary widely on their topic; recent examples of ordinances include items as varied as modifications to land owner rights, emergency responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, and changes to banking regulations [87] [88]\n\n\nFederalism\nThe first article of the Constitution declares that India is a \"Union of States\" [89] Under the Constitution, the States retain key powers for themselves and have a strong influence over the national government via the Rajya Sabha However, the Constitution does provide key limits on their powers and gives final say in many cases to the national government.\n\n\nState powers in the Constitution\nAt the Union level, the States are represented in the Rajya Sabha or Council of States The Fourth Schedule of the Constitution lays out the number of seats that each State controls in the Council of States, and they are based roughly on each State's population [90] The members of each state legislature elect and appoint these representatives in the Council of States [91] On most topics the Rajya Sabha is coequal with the lower house or Lok Sabha, and its consent is required for a bill to become a law [92] Additionally, as one of the Houses of Parliament, any amendment to the Constitution requires a two-thirds majority in the Rajya Sabha to go into effect [93] These provisions allow the States significant impact on national politics through their representation in the \"federal chamber\" [90]\n\n\nRajya Sabha\nAt the Union level, the States are represented in the Rajya Sabha or Council of

provisions allow the States significant impact on national politics through their representation in the \"federal chamber\" [90]\n\n\nState List\nThe Constitution provides the States with a long list of powers exclusive to their jurisdiction [90] Generally only State Legislatures are capable of passing laws implementing these powers; the Union government is prohibited from doing so These powers are contained in the second list of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, known as the State List The areas on the State List are wide-ranging and include topics like public health and order and a variety of taxes The State List grants the states control over the police, healthcare, agriculture, elections, and more [94]\n\n\nAmendments\nIn addition to exerting influence over the amendment process via the Rajya Sabha, the States are sometimes involved in the amendment process This special, entrenched process is triggered when an amendment to the Constitution specifically concerns the States by modifying the legislature or the powers reserved to the states in the Seventh Schedule When this occurs, an amendment must be ratified by a majority of state legislatures for the amendment to go into effect [93]\n\n\nLimitations on state powers\nWhile the State List mentioned above provides powers for the States, there are two other lists in the Seventh Schedule that generally weaken them These are the Union and Concurrent lists The Union List is the counterpart to the State List, containing the areas of exclusive jurisdiction of the Union government, where the states are prohibited from legislating [95] Items on the Union List include the national defense, international relations, immigration, banking, and interstate commerce [94]\n\n\nUnion and Concurrent Lists\nWhile the State List mentioned above provides powers for the States, there are two other lists in the Seventh Schedule that generally weaken them These are the Union and Concurrent lists The Union List is the counterpart to the State List, containing the areas of exclusive jurisdiction of the Union government, where the states are prohibited from legislating [95] Items on the Union List include the national defense, international relations, immigration, banking, and interstate commerce [94]\n\n\nAppointment of governors\nThe Governor of each State is given the executive power of the respective State by the Constitution [98] These Governors are appointed directly by the President of the central government Because the Prime Minister acts via the President, the Prime Minister is the one who chooses the Governors in practice [99] Once appointed, a Governor serves for a five-year term or can be replaced by the President at any time, if asked to do so by the Prime Minister [100] Because the Union government can remove a Governor at any time, it is possible that Governors may act in a way the Union Government wants, to the detriment of their state, so that they can maintain their office This has become a larger issue as the State Legislatures are often controlled by different parties than that of the Union Prime Minister, unlike the early years of the constitution [101] For example, Governors have used stalling tactics to delay giving their assent to legislation that the Union Government disapproves of [102]\n\n\nCreation of states\nPerhaps the most direct power over the States is the Union's ability to unilaterally create new states out of territories or existing states and to modify and diminish the boundaries of existing states [105] To do so, Parliament must pass a simple law with no supermajority requirements The States involved do not have a say on the outcome but the State Legislature must be asked to comment [106] The most recent state to be created was Telangana in 2014 [107] More recently, Ladakh was created as a new Union Territory after being split off from Jammu and Kashmir in 2019, and Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli were combined into a single Union Territory in 2020 [108] [109] The former was particularly opposed by some e.g Arundhati Roy In her opinion, Jammu and Kashmir was a full state, and the legislation creating Ladakh stripped the area of its status as a state and downgraded it to a Union Territory, allowing the Union Government to directly control it This required no input from Jammu and Kashmir [110]\n\n\nFederalism and the courts\nWhile the states have separate legislative and executive branches, they share the judiciary with the Union government This is different from other federal court systems, such as the United States, where state courts mainly apply state law and federal courts mainly apply federal law [111] Under the Indian constitution, the High Courts of the States are directly constituted by the national constitution The constitution also allows states to set up lower courts under and controlled by the state's High Court [112] [113] Cases heard at or appealed to the High Courts can be furter appealed to the Supreme Court of India in some cases [114] All cases, whether dealing with federal or state laws, move up the same judicial hierarchy, creating a system sometimes termed integrated federalism [111]\n\n\nInternational law\nThe Constitution includes treaty making as part of the executive power given to the President [115] Because the President must act in accordance with the advice of the Council of Ministers, the Prime Minister is the chief party responsible for making international treaties in the Constitution Because the legislative power rests with Parliament, the President's signature on an international agreement does not bring it into effect domestically or enable courts to enforce its provisions Article 253 of the Constitution bestows this power on Parliament, enabling it to make laws necessary for implementing international agreements and treaties [116] These provisions indicate that the Constitution of India is dualist, that is, treaty law only takes effect when a domestic law passed using the normal processes incorporates it into domestic law [117]\n\n\nFlexibility\nAccording to Granville Austin, \"The Indian constitution is first and foremost a social document, and is aided by its Parts III & IV (Fundamental Rights & Directive Principles of State Policy, respectively) acting together, as its chief instruments and its conscience, in realising the goals set by it for all the people.\" [h] [120] The constitution has deliberately been worded in generalities (not in vague terms) to ensure its flexibility [121] John Marshall, the fourth chief justice of the United States, said that a constitution's \"great outlines should be marked, its important objects designated, and the minor ingredients which compose those objects be deduced from the nature of the objects themselves.\" [122] A document \"intended to endure for ages to come\", [123] it must be interpreted not only based on the intention and understanding of its framers, but in the existing social and political context.\n\n\nTranslations into Indian languages\nThe Constitution of India is translated into only a few of the 22 scheduled languages of the

{"title": "Cyclone_Tauktae", "content": "\nMeteorological history\nOn May 11, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring a large area of low pressure in the equatorial Arabian Sea for potential tropical cyclone development As the system slowly moved eastwards, it gradually organized amid favorable conditions, including sea surface temperatures of up to 30 °C (86 degrees Fahrenheit) and low wind shear The JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on this system on May 13 [19] [20] A few hours later, the JTWC designated it as Tropical Cyclone 01A [21] The system gradually intensified, as the previously disorganized broad area of convection began to wrap around the low-level circulation center It further strengthened to become a deep depression at 12:00 UTC the next day [22] Around this time, the system turned northeastwards and began to move towards India Due to the very large area of convection over the cyclone, it dumped heavy rainfall over the southern portions of the country Six hours after the upgrade, the system became even more organized and intensified into a cyclonic storm, receiving the name Tauktae by the IMD [23] Tauktae later intensified into a Severe Cyclonic Storm at 15:00 UTC on May 15, as a robust central dense overcast developed [24] Just three hours later, the JTWC upgraded Tauktae to a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Saffir–Simpson scale (SSHWS), while a ragged eye appeared on infrared satellite imagery as the storm started a period of rapid intensification [25]\n\n\nPreparations\nOn May 16, 2021, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a high review meeting to review preparedness on the cyclone through video conferencing with various senior officials in New Delhi [35] All coastal fishing in Kerala was banned by the state's disaster management authority between May 13–17 in anticipation of rough seas caused by Tauktae's formation and traversal of the offshore waters [36] [37] The IMD issued a red alert for nine districts in Kerala for torrential rainfall on May 15, including Lakshadweep [38] [39] All flights at Agatti Airport in Lakshadweep were suspended while the cyclone passed over the archipelago [40] The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) dispatched nine teams to Kerala while detachments of the Indian military were placed on standby [41] Supplemental oxygen and other medical supplies were also brought within the risk areas from both domestic and foreign sources [42] Three fishermen on an inoperable vessel were rescued by the Indian Coast Guard 19 km (12 mi) off Kannur on May 14 [43] More than 2,000 people were evacuated to 71 centres were established for populations vulnerable to coastal erosion while COVID-19 patients among the evacuees were brought to specialised treatment centres [41] [44] A curfew initially imposed to curtail the spread of COVID-19 in Dakshina Kannada, Karnataka [45] In total, the NDRF mobilised 4,700 personnel in 100 teams across six states [46] In Gujarat, 200,000 people were evacuated from low-lying areas all while 54 teams of the National Disaster Response Force and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) were deployed [11] [12] In Maharashtra, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said alerts had been raised for coastal districts and that the state administration had been preparing to ensure that electricity and oxygen supply would remain in COVID-19 hospitals [47] Operations at Mumbai International Airport were suspended on May 17 between 11:00 and 14:00 IST Bandra Worli Sea Link was also closed for normal traffic and the COVID-19 vaccination drive in Mumbai was also suspended for the day [48]\n\n\nIndia\nThe National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) chief, S.N Pradhan, said that doctors and various medical staff were sent to the affected states, as well as 100 relief teams However, only vaccinated personnel were sent Special arrangements for hospitals, COVID-19 support, and other needs were made to ensure electricity would not be interrupted [13]\n\n\nPre-landfall\nOn May 16, 2021, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a high review meeting to review preparedness on the cyclone through video conferencing with various senior officials in New Delhi [35] All coastal fishing in Kerala was banned by the state's disaster management authority between May 13–17 in anticipation of rough seas caused by Tauktae's formation and

Bandra Worli Sea Link was also closed for normal traffic and the COVID-19 vaccination drive in Mumbai was also suspended for the day [48]\n\n\nPost-landfall\nAs the storm moved through Gujarat and weakened much more slowly than previously expected, rainfall predictions were made by the IMD for various areas of the state On May 19, an orange alert was issued for Delhi and adjoining parts of Haryana and West Uttar Pradesh Localized flooding, waterlogging of low-lying areas and closures of underpasses in hilly areas was warned Reduction in visibility, disruption of traffic, road and structure damage, and agricultural impacts were also of concern Isolated areas were expected to receive \"very heavy\" rainfall, over a \"fairly widespread\" to \"widespread\" region [51] The IMD advised those at risk to check for traffic congestion on their planned routes, follow traffic warnings, and to avoid going to places at risk of water damage and waterlogging National capital New Delhi witnessed heavy downpours on May 19, totaling 119.3 mm in 24 hours, the highest single-day rainfall in history in May, with waterlogging reported in many areas Similar intensity rainfall was witnessed over Rewari in Haryana and Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh [52]\n\n\nPakistan\nChief Minister of Sindh Syed Murad Ali Shah held a cyclone emergency meeting, where he declared an emergency in every district located along the coastal belt of the province [53]\n\n\nImpact\nIn total, 169 people had died in India as a result of Cyclone Tauktae, with at least 80 others injured and about 81 missing 10 died in

sent Special arrangements for hospitals, COVID-19 support, and other needs were made to ensure electricity would not be interrupted [13]\n\n\nSouth India\nAlthough it remained offshore, Tauktae brought heavy rainfall to Kerala [55] An average of 145.5 mm (5.73 in) of rain fell across the state on May 15, damaging its agriculture and power infrastructure [44] Flash floods occurred and soil was waterlogged in Kerala [56] Over a hundred homes sustained damage throughout the state [57] Two people were killed in Ernakulam and Kozhikode districts of Kerala, [44] with a state total of 10 [8] Severe coastal erosion occurred in Ambalappuzha, Cherthala, and Karthikappally Homes were damaged or destroyed in Alappuzha and Kadakkarappally by Tauktae's strong winds Numerous trees were uprooted and power supplies were disrupted in Alappuzha [46] [40] Several districts and municipalities reported considerable impacts from heavy rain [46] Floodwaters in Kerala's Central Division washed out at least 248 ha (610 acres) of crops worth ₹52 million (US$710 thousand) [58] Agricultural losses statewide reached ₹8.28 billion (US$113 million) [15] The coast of Karnataka was buffeted by high winds

the Karnataka State Disaster Management Authority [12] 385 mm (15.2 in) of rain fell at Nada Station in Kundapur Taluk, Karnataka, while several other stations recorded at least 200 mm (7.9 in) of rainfall [12] Sustained winds of 90 km/h (56 mph) battered the state coastline for hours, damaging at least 112 homes, with at least 139 electricity poles being blown over [12]\n\n\nMaharashtra\n21 people were killed and nine were injured in the state of Maharashtra, and over 2,542 buildings were damaged [69] [66] [9] The Indian Express reported that train services were suspended due to flooding and fallen trees on tracks, which were blocking routes Two barges were adrift off the coast of Mumbai due to the cyclone, containing about 400 people [70] Mumbai recorded a whopping 300 mm (12 in) above, becoming the highest amount of rainfall recorded in May since records began in the 19th century The previous record was set on May 20, 2000, which was 191 mm (7.5 in) Along with torrential downpour, squally winds reaching more than 100 km/h (62 mph) was recorded The maximum wind speed recorded was 108 km/h (67 mph), the highest recorded wind gust in last 70 years It uprooted more than 600 trees across the city, destroyed thousands of homes, waterlogged most of the city roads and disrupted electricity supply and traffic [71] The Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport was shut for over 11 hours with 55 flights cancelled and several flights routed to other cities [69] [72] The Wankhede Stadium also experienced major damage due to a 16 ft (4.9 m) sightscreen of the North Side being damaged by powerful winds, similar to an incident in 2011 [73] A total of three people died and ten people were injured in Mumbai [74] Two children lost their lives after an uprooted tree

damaged [17] The Bandra–Worli Sea Link was closed because of strong winds Many structures were damaged by winds [13] and 4.6 million consumers suffered power cuts in Maharashtra [76] Between 3,500 and 5,000 hectares of standing horticulture have been damaged [68] It was the most powerful storm to affect Mumbai since Cyclone Nisarga in 2020 [71] The Government of Maharashtra approved compensation of ₹2.52 billion (US$34.4 million) [77]\n\n\nGujarat\nThe cyclone made landfall in the region of Saurashtra between Diu and Rajula at around 21:00 IST, and weakened to a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm Wind speeds of approximately 150 to 175 kilometres per hour (93 to 109 mph) were recorded at the district of Diu in the union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu [78] A total of 67 people [79] were killed in Gujarat, while 55,384 homes were damaged [7]  Over 1,000 poles were uprooted while and over 2,400 villages witnessed power supply failures [80] [69] [81] [74] Only 100 COVID-19 hospitals out of the 400 in the state had power All hospitals had generators, however, four of them failed Authorities were sent to repair them The situation the cyclone brought was labeled as a \"double blow\" by Udaya Regmi, the South Asian head of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRCRCS) A COVID-induced curfew that was issued across 36 cities was extended three days due to the cyclone Originally, it was expected to be cancelled on Tuesday Several food and water sources that are needed for farmers were interrupted [50]\n\n\nMaritime incidents\n66 people died, at least 20 people are still missing after  Barge P305 [4] [87] sank near Heera oil field, off the coast of Mumbai, although the Indian Navy said it had rescued 186 survivors [88] of the 270 people aboard by May 19 37 bodies were recovered, while 40 passengers remain missing [8] INS Kochi entered Mumbai Harbour with the rescued people Three other commercial

The cyclone caused widespread destruction, resulting in the loss of many lives and property damage.\n\n**Meteorological History**\n\nCyclone Tauktae formed in the Arabian Sea on May 11, 2021, as a large area of low pressure. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring the system, and it gradually organized amid favorable conditions, including sea surface temperatures of up to 30°C (86°F) and low wind shear. The JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on May 13, and the system was designated as Tropical Cyclone 01A. The cyclone gradually intensified, and it became a deep depression at 12:00 UTC on May 14. The system turned northeastwards and began to move towards India, bringing heavy rainfall to the southern portions of the country. Due to the large area of convection over the cyclone, it dumped heavy rainfall over the southern portions of India. Six hours after the upgrade, the system became even more organized and intensified into a cyclonic storm, receiving the name Tauktae by the IMD. Tauktae later intensified into a Severe Cyclonic Storm at 15:00 UTC on May 15, as a robust central dense overcast developed. Just three hours later, the JTWC upgraded Tauktae to a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson scale (SSHWS), while a ragged eye appeared on infrared satellite imagery as the storm started a period of rapid intensification.\n\n**Preparations**\n\nOn May 16, 2021, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a high review meeting to review preparedness on the cyclone through video conferencing with various senior officials in New Delhi. All coastal fishing in Kerala was banned by the state's disaster management authority between May 13–17 in anticipation of rough seas caused by Tauktae's formation and traversal of the offshore waters. The IMD issued a red alert for nine districts in Kerala for torrential rainfall on May 15, including Lakshadweep. All flights at Agatti Airport in Lakshadweep were suspended while the cyclone passed over the archipelago. The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) dispatched nine teams to Kerala while detachments of the Indian military were placed on standby. Supplemental oxygen and other medical supplies were also brought within the risk areas from both domestic and foreign sources. Three fishermen on an inoperable vessel were rescued by the Indian Coast Guard 19 km (12 mi) off Kannur on May 14. More than 2,000 people were evacuated to 71 centres were established for populations vulnerable to coastal erosion while COVID-19 patients among the evacuees were brought to specialised treatment centres. A curfew initially imposed to curtail the spread of COVID-19 in Dakshina Kannada, Karnataka. In total, the NDRF mobilised 4,700 personnel in 100 teams across six states. In Gujarat, 200,000 people were evacuated from low-lying areas all while 54 teams of the National Disaster Response Force and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) were deployed. In Maharashtra, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said alerts had been raised for coastal districts and that the state administration had been preparing to ensure that electricity and oxygen supply would remain in COVID-19 hospitals. Operations at Mumbai International Airport were suspended on May 17 between 11:00 and 14:00 IST. Bandra Worli Sea Link was also closed for normal traffic and the COVID-19 vaccination drive in Mumbai was also suspended for the day.\n\n**Pre-landfall**\n\nAs the storm moved through Gujarat and weakened much more slowly than previously expected, rainfall predictions were made by the IMD for various areas of the state. On May 19, an orange alert was issued for Delhi and adjoining parts of Haryana and West Uttar Pradesh. Localized flooding, waterlogging of low-lying areas, and closures of underpasses in hilly areas were warned. Reduction in visibility, disruption of traffic, road, and structure damage, and agricultural impacts were also of concern. Isolated areas were expected to receive \"very heavy\" rainfall, over a \"fairly widespread\" to \"widespread\" region. The IMD advised those at risk to check for traffic congestion on their planned routes, follow traffic warnings, and to avoid going to places at risk of water damage and waterlogging. National capital New Delhi witnessed heavy downpours on May 19, totaling 119.3 mm in 24 hours, the highest single-day rainfall in history in May, with waterlogging reported in many areas. Similar intensity rainfall was witnessed over Rewari in Haryana and Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh.\n\n**Post-landfall**\n\nAs the storm moved through Gujarat and weakened much more slowly than previously expected, rainfall predictions were made by the IMD for various areas of the state.

Search and rescue operations were underway for one of the 270-passenger barges. The search was conducted in winds reaching 90 to 100 km/h (55 to 60 mph), with waves reaching as high as 9 to 10 m (30 to 35 ft). Meanwhile INS Kochi, the INS Kolkata, and the INS Talwar continued their search operations.\n\n**Other countries**\n\nIn Maldives and Sri Lanka, over 730 families were affected by the cyclone.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) chief, S.N Pradhan, said that doctors and various medical staff were sent to the affected states, as well as 100 relief teams.

including the towns of Kupiansk, Shevchenkove, and Balakliia [22] Balakliia itself was captured on March 3, 2022, without much of a fight From March to early May, most of the fighting in Kharkiv Oblast was concentrated in the cities of Kharkiv and Izium [23]\n\n\nPrelude\nAfter weeks of Ukrainian propaganda about an imminent counteroffensive in southern Ukraine, Russia redeployed thousands of troops, including elite units such as the 1st Guards Tank Army, to Kherson Oblast, leaving its remaining troops manning a \"stretched and tired Russian front that spanned some 1,300km – roughly the distance from London to Prague.\" [39] [40] [41] [42] [43]\n\n\nCounteroffensive\nOn 6 September 2022, Ukrainian forces launched a counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region, [47] taking Russian forces by surprise [19] [48] [49] In a 10 September interview with the Guardian, Ukrainian special forces spokesman Taras Berezovets stated Russia \"thought  [the counteroffensive] would be in the south.. then,

flee.\" [45]\n\n\nInitial advance\nOn 6 September 2022, Ukrainian forces launched a counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region, [47] taking Russian forces by surprise [19] [48] [49] In a 10 September interview with the Guardian, Ukrainian special forces spokesman Taras Berezovets stated Russia \"thought  [the counteroffensive] would be in the south.. then, instead of the south, the offensive happened where they least expected, and this caused them to panic and flee.\" [45]\n\n\nBreakthrough\nOn 6 September, having concentrated their forces north of Balakliia at Pryshyb, a small village about 15 km northwest of Balakliia, Ukrainian troops launched a counteroffensive in the Kharkiv Oblast, which drove Russian forces back to the left bank of the Donets and Serednya Balakliika rivers The Ukrainian forces involved were Ukrainian special forces, plus tanks, armoured personnel carriers and troops from the 92nd Mechanized Brigade [39] [41] [55]\n\n\nRussian withdrawal from Kharkiv Oblast west of Oskil River\nIn the afternoon of 11 September, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced the formal pullout of Russian forces from nearly all of Kharkiv Oblast The ministry \"announced that an 'operation to curtail and transfer troops' was underway.\" [86] [87] At 20:06 that day, Russian Kalibr cruise missiles struck Ukrainian critical infrastructure sites (including Kharkiv TEC-5), which left Poltava, Sumy, Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, and parts of Odesa Oblasts without electricity [88] [89] Meanwhile, clashes between Ukrainian attackers and Russian defenders continued at Lyman [46]\n\n\nOther gains and casualties\nIn the morning of 11 September, Luhansk Oblast Governor Serhiy Haidai claimed that Russian forces had mostly left Starobilsk In the same message, he claimed that Russian occupational authorities were also leaving from areas that Russia had controlled since 2014, [78] [93] [94] though there was no clear evidence to verify this claim [citation needed]\n\n\nBattle of Shevchenkove\nBy 7 September, Balakliia was under siege, with fighting taking place in the eastern and central parts of the city [106] Fighting ended on September 8, with Ukrainian forces capturing all of Balakliia [107] [failed verification] After the quick takeover of the town of Balakliia, on the same day, Ukrainian troops took over the place of Shevchenkove in a blitzkrieg Russian forces retreated in panic towards the city of Kupiansk, while much larger Ukrainian forces continued the offensive in the direction of Izyum and Kupiansk on the same day [108]\n\n\nSecond phase (13 September–1 October 2022)\nDespite Russia's intent [citation needed] to keep the front line along Oskil River, Ukrainian forces had already crossed the river as early as 13 September at several locations Around 13 September, Ukrainian forces crossed the river near Borova and established a bridgehead [109] [unreliable source] By 24–25 September, the Ukrainian military had established at least five bridgeheads on the east side of Oskil River [110]\n\n\nOskil River crossing\nDespite Russia's intent [citation needed] to keep the front line along Oskil River, Ukrainian

source] By 24–25 September, the Ukrainian military had established at least five bridgeheads on the east side of Oskil River [110]\n\n\nEncirclement and recapture of Lyman\nAs a result of the Ukraine's \"lightning counteroffensive\" throughout September, Russian forces retreated to Lyman, a major city in Donetsk Oblast with critical Russian supply lines According to the British Ministry of Defense, \"Lyman's operational importance was due to its command over a road crossing over the Siverskyi Donets River, behind which Russia has been attempting to consolidate its defenses.\" [125] On

launched by the Ukrainian Armed Forces in September 2022 to retake territory from Russian forces in the Kharkiv region of Ukraine. The counteroffensive was a significant turning point in the war, as it led to the recapture of key cities and territories, and dealt a significant blow to Russian forces.\n\n**Background**\n\nDuring the early days of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian forces captured much of eastern Kharkiv Oblast, including the towns of Kupiansk, Shevchenkove, and Balakliia. Balakliia itself was captured on March 3, 2022, without much of a fight. From March to early May, most of the fighting in Kharkiv Oblast was concentrated in the cities of Kharkiv and Izium.\n\n**Prelude**\n\nAfter weeks of Ukrainian propaganda about an imminent counteroffensive in southern Ukraine, Russia redeployed thousands of troops, including elite units such as the 1st Guards Tank Army, to Kherson Oblast, leaving its remaining troops manning a \"stretched and tired Russian front that spanned some 1,300km – roughly the distance from London to Prague.\"\n\n**Counteroffensive**\n\nOn 6 September 2022, Ukrainian forces launched a counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region, taking Russian forces by surprise. In a 10 September interview with the Guardian, Ukrainian special forces spokesman Taras Berezovets stated Russia \"thought  [the counteroffensive] would be in the south.. then, instead of the south, the offensive happened where they least expected, and this caused them to panic and flee.\"\n\n**First Phase (6-12 September 2022)**\n\nOn 6 September 2022, Ukrainian forces launched a counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region, taking Russian forces by surprise. Initial advances were made in the direction of Balakliia and Shevchenkove, with Ukrainian forces eventually capturing the town of Balakliia on September 8. Russian forces retreated in panic towards the city of Kupiansk, while much larger Ukrainian forces continued the offensive in the direction of Izyum and Kupiansk on the same day.\n\n**Breakthrough**\n\nOn 6 September, having concentrated their forces north of Balakliia at Pryshyb, a small village about 15 km northwest of Balakliia, Ukrainian troops launched a counteroffensive in the Kharkiv Oblast, which drove Russian forces back to the left bank of the Donets and Serednya Balakliika rivers. The Ukrainian forces involved were Ukrainian special forces, plus tanks, armoured personnel carriers and troops from the 92nd Mechanized Brigade.\n\n**Russian Withdrawal from Kharkiv Oblast West of Oskil River**\n\nIn the afternoon of 11 September, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced the formal pullout of Russian forces from nearly all of Kharkiv Oblast. At 20:06 that day, Russian Kalibr cruise missiles struck Ukrainian critical infrastructure sites (including Kharkiv TEC-5), which left Poltava, Sumy, Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, and parts of Odesa Oblasts without electricity.\n\n**Other Gains and Casualties**\n\nIn the morning of 11 September, Luhansk Oblast Governor Serhiy Haidai claimed that Russian forces had mostly left Starobilsk. However, there was no clear evidence to verify this claim.\n\n**Battle of Shevchenkove**\n\nBy 7 September, Balakliia was under siege, with fighting taking place in the eastern and central parts of the city. Fighting ended on September 8, with Ukrainian forces capturing all of Balakliia. After the quick takeover of the town of Balakliia, on the same day, Ukrainian troops took over the place of Shevchenkove in a blitzkrieg.\n\n**Second Phase (13 September-1 October 2022)**\n\nDespite Russia's intent to keep the front line along Oskil River, Ukrainian forces had already crossed the river as early as 13 September at several locations. Around 13 September, Ukrainian forces crossed the river near Borova and established a bridgehead. By 24-25 September, the Ukrainian military had established at least five bridgeheads on the east side of Oskil River.\n\n**Oskil River Crossing**\n\nDespite Russia's intent to keep the front line along Oskil River, Ukrainian forces had already crossed the river as early as 13 September at several locations. Around 13 September, Ukrainian forces crossed the river near Borova and established a bridgehead.\n\n**Encirclement and Recapture of Lyman**\n\nAs a result of the Ukraine's \"lightning counteroffensive\" throughout September, Russian forces retreated to Lyman, a major city in Donetsk Oblast with critical Russian supply lines. On 26 September, the New York Times reported a standoff between the critical cities of then-Russian-held Lyman and Ukrainian-controlled Bakhmut.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nOn 7 September 2022, a day after the start of the Ukrainian offensive, Putin claimed during his speech at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok that \"We have not lost anything and will not lose anything\" in the war in Ukraine.\n\n**Effect on Russian Referendums**\n\nOn 12 September, Meduza reported that, per two sources close to the Kremlin, the proposed referendums for the annexation of the self-proclaimed Luhansk and Donetsk People's Republics had been postponed indefinitely, following earlier postponement from 11 September to 4 November.

ⓘ; chữ Hán: 和好; literally \"peace and amicability\"), [15] in what is now Thốt Nốt District of An Giang Province, Vietnam [16] The name is also spelled as Hoa-Hao [17] Another label, Hoahaoism, [18]

[23]\n\n\nClassification\nThe religious group [25] has been traditionally classified as a Buddhist [26] [27] sect [10] [28] [29] [30] General Joseph Lawton Collins, who served as a U.S Special Representative in Vietnam, described Hòa Hảo as a \"pseudo-religious sect\", adding that it \"appealed to the peasants with a veneer of Buddhism and a protective paternalism\" [12] Indeed, the American press of the 1950s labelled Hòa Hảo as \"a pseudo-religious sect which follows a perverted form of Buddhism\", and as \"a rowdy sect of dissident Buddhists\" whose founder \"was sent to a lunatic asylum\" [31]\n\n\nOrigins\nHòa Hảo was founded by Huỳnh Phú Sổ (1919–1947), [37] an ethnic Vietnamese born in 1919 to a Roman Catholic family of small-holders [8] [22] [38] The religious movement was found in the remote Miền Tây region of the Mekong Delta, which was known as Transbassac under French colonial rule In the mid-nineteenth century, the Mekong Delta was a rough frontier society; the political power was shaky, social relations were tenuous, and religious currents were diverse Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, and various spirit cults all had differing impacts on the population The ethnic Vietnamese interacted with Cambodians and Chinese, and everyone was forced to accept French colonial rule in 1867 [11] [16] The religion arose from a tangle of mysticism, magic, and witchcraft, which could be found in most of the region's local beliefs Rooted in earlier Vietnamese anti-colonial religious traditions, the Hòa Hảo philosophy claims to be based on the thoughts of Phật Thầy Tây An (1807–1856), known as Đạo Bửu Sơn Kỳ Hương Tây An, in the 1830s, prophesied the collapse of the Nguyễn Vietnam at the hands of Western powers; the prophecies survived his death and spread throughout the Miền Tây, resulting in two major rebellions in 1875 and 1913 in which the region's French administration was nearly deposed [22]\n\n\nExpansion\nEarly prophecies of Sổ began to come true: he anticipated the eruption of a major war in the Far East and the expulsion of the French by Asians World War II and the Japanese occupation of Indochina seemed to confirm his predictions By 1940, he had gained such influence that the Vichy French governor Jean Decoux, fearing anti-French revolts, had Sổ imprisoned in Bạc Liêu under the pretense that he was a lunatic The imprisonment of Sổ was seen by his followers as an unforgivable act of war against the faith itself In prison, Sổ succeeded in converting his psychiatrist, Dr Tam, who became an ardent supporter A board of French psychiatrists declared him sane in May 1941, though he was exiled upon his release His key supporters were sent to a concentration camp in Nui Bara The French restrictions strengthened his nationalist appeal, and Bạc Liêu soon became a place of Hòa Hảo pilgrimage, although it was far from the movement's strongholds [41] [48] He used the pilgrims to spread religious fervor and anti-French sentiment [30] In 1942, the French could no longer withstand the growing popular reactions generated by Sổ's oracular pronouncements and political instructions, so they exiled him to Laos [49]\n\n\nWorld War II\nEarly prophecies of Sổ began to come true: he anticipated the eruption of a major war in the Far East and the expulsion of the French by Asians World War II and the Japanese occupation of Indochina seemed to confirm his predictions By 1940, he had gained such influence that the Vichy French governor Jean Decoux, fearing anti-French revolts, had Sổ imprisoned in Bạc Liêu under the

spread religious fervor and anti-French sentiment [30] In 1942, the French could no longer withstand the growing popular reactions generated by Sổ's oracular pronouncements and political instructions, so they exiled him to Laos [49]\n\n\nAugust Revolution\nSổ avoided the stigma of being labeled a Japanese puppet by forecasting the empire's defeat months in advance His movement joined the nationalist front that took power in the interregnum [62] following Japan's surrender to establish a united resistance to both the Japanese and the French Sổ requested and received a Communist cadre to assist him in training his followers The Japanese requested from Sổ and his followers more crops, but instead, he advised peasants to stop farming, putting his new alliance with the ICP in jeopardy, as the Communists regarded southern rice as critical to ending the northern famine Peasants were persuaded to partially restore production levels by local Communists, and the ICP maintained its precarious unity with the Hòa Hảo in the common cause of independence The Hòa Hảo, Việt Minh, and Cao Đài, another religious group, united in the independence effort and the ICP took power in Saigon during the August Revolution [63] The Việt Minh proclaimed themselves to be Vietnam's legitimate government The French, alongside the Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo, other local political organizations, and the Binh Xuyen forces all disputed this claim [64] Thus, the Hòa Hảo clashed with Việt Minh as well as the Cao Đài Militarily superior to the Việt Minh, the Hòa Hảo became the main political power in the Mekong Delta region, constituting a huge threat to the Communists The religious leadership was unwilling to toe the Việt Minh line from Hanoi [49] [65]\n\n\nFirst Indochina War\nThe return of the French colonial regime helped to keep the Hòa Hảo and the Việt Minh apart, [49] but it was also a major disappointment to the Hòa Hảo Sổ had hoped that his religious movement would become the de facto ruling power throughout most of Cochinchina, but the arrival of a larger French force put an end to such ambitions The Hòa Hảo turned inward to strengthen their religious power and expand their political influence in the Mekong Delta As the French grew increasingly skeptical of the Việt Minh, they started aiding the Hòa Hảo In fact, throughout the First Indochina War (1946–1954), the French government issued support payments for Cao Đài, Hòa Hao, and Bình Xuyên armed forces in exchange for defense of the territories they controlled against the Việt Minh They granted the Hòa Hảo hegemony over the southwestern Mekong Delta and eventually provided arms for some 20,000 Hoahaoists In return for aid against the Việt Minh, the new Hòa Hảo leadership was willing to form alliances with the colonialists; they did not see such an agreement as a betrayal of their nationalist ideals because the ultimate goal of religious independence was not jeopardized [14] [72] The Hòa Hảo periodically tied Việt Minh sympathizers together and threw them into the river to drown The Việt Minh were worried by Sổ's nationalist credentials and social structure, and attempted to co-opt him into a National Unified Front (NUF) [49] [73]\n\n\nPost-Sổ period\nSổ's death created a power vacuum within the religious leadership Because he was the sole unexceptional candidate among vying competitors, Sổ's father Huỳnh Công Bộ was hurriedly chosen to succeed him as its leader [83] He was the former chief of the Hòa Hảo village, and served as the religious doctrine's guardian and movement's leader until his death [80] Despite this, he lacked his son's charm, authority, political savvy, and ideological obsession [83] Therefore, the movement began to lose momentum, leading to factionalism, parochialism, and outside organization influence, [11] which caused an increase in violence as the various internal factions engaged in conflicts among themselves [84] The religious group split into four factions, each led by a former military subordinate of Sổ, [30] while Soái assumed the title of commander in chief of the Hòa Hảo armed forces [85] The factionalized leaders were far more violent, resorting to public burnings, beheadings, and mass executions of ethnic Khmers and Vietnamese [21] None of the military commanders were concerned with anything other than their own self-promotion, and none of the civilian leaders had Sổ's capacity to guide them or preach moderation [86] Their violence was not limited to South Vietnam; they would cross borders and pillage Cambodian villages Local Khmers responded by creating defense groups to fight the Hòa Hảo, while others converted to assure their safety [87] Despite this, the Hòa Hảo declared eternal war against the Communists Haseman argues that Sổ's assassination was a major miscalculation on the part of the Việt Minh, who falsely believed at the time that the Hòa Hảo lacked the strength to fight both the French and the Communists By mid-1947, the Hoahaoists were committed to armed combat against the Việt Minh [78] During the First Indochina War, because of their shared antipathy towards the Việt Minh and the need to find a source of financial support to replace French wartime subsidies, Hòa Hảo maintained a level of cooperation with Cao Đài and Bình Xuyên In the months leading up to the Franco–Việt Minh ceasefire, these shared interests held the factions together They temporarily halted their conflicts with the French, signing a military treaty with them on 8 May 1947, less than a month after Sổ's assassination [88]\n\n\nDelta triumvirate\nFollowing Sổ's assassination, the religious movement expanded its territory to include Cần Thơ Province They controlled over a third of southern Vietnam, elected their own officials, [89] and built significant infrastructure for collecting taxes and recruiting armed forces [90] Soái formed an alliance with the French, providing Hòa Hảo troops as auxiliary forces; [79] however, several other Hòa Hảo leaders refused to recognize Soái's leadership, and the religion continued to be riven by rivalries and factionalism [85] Nevertheless, it transformed into a French-backed [87] 20,000-strong army [91] They ruled most of the upper central delta, [92] and, along with the Cao Đài and Bình Xuyên, established a triumvirate in the mid-1950s, early in the Vietnam War (1955–1975), that grew in strength and constituted a significant threat to South Vietnam This republic was regarded by the Hòa Hảo as just another in a series of central governments aiming to subjugate the Hòa Hảo to their rule [78]\n\n\nSect crisis\nGeneral J Lawton Collins believed that Diệm would be doomed if he yielded in to the movement's demands [96] He thought that the groups' boldness in presenting this ultimatum strongly suggested that they were planning anti-Diệm rallies in Saigon According to Collins, the Saigon government could not have allowed rallies to go unchallenged and had to intervene to put an end to them He advised Diệm to reach an agreement with the UFNF in order to persuade its members to becoming government loyalists Initially, Diệm agreed to negotiate with the UFNF leaders, but when they stated that their demands were non-negotiable, he abandoned the idea [96] He was certain that the VNA would carry out his orders to suppress any opposition group, as he had gained the loyalty of many army officers in recent months and had replaced many others who had not Collins, however, underestimated the army's support for Diệm and advised him to avoid using brute force and instead seek a compromise Though Collins discouraged Diệm from executing his plans against Bình Xuyên, the latter, suspicious of a VNA attack, made a move on Diệm loyalists without first seeking America's consent This resulted in a conflict between the two that temporarily halted with a ceasefire enforced by the French Commissioner-General Paul Ély [101] Collins went to Washington with the determination that Diệm had to be replaced U.S President Dwight Eisenhower honored his decision and U.S Secretary of State John Foster Dulles penned telegrams to Saigon, informing Bảo Đại and other Vietnamese leaders to find a replacement for Diệm These plans were halted when a new battle began in Saigon between the VNA and Bình Xuyên The Diệm loyalists crushed Bình Xuyên, with the latter being saved from total annihilation only with Ély's intervention [102]\n\n\n1955 referendum\nDuring a referendum organized by Diệm in October, Hòa Hảo forces staged sporadic attacks on the polling stations of Cần Tho, though there was not much opposition to this political maneuver [107] Communist politician Lê Duẩn met with Soái and Ba Cụt, and, despite their ideological differences, they agreed to form the Southern Committee of the Patriotic Front, which eventually included remnants not only from the Hòa Hảo but also the Cao Đài and Bình Xuyên rebel armies [108] Soái declared the referendum unconstitutional, stating his preference for a true democratic state Diệm's political maneuvers were also criticized by Ba Cụt, who claimed that the referendum was an opportunity to force the people to \"depose Bảo Đại and proclaim the puppet Diệm as the chief-of-state of Vietnam\" Diệm reportedly received $4 million in aid from the American government and American Catholic organizations to support the referendum, which Ba Cụt stated was part of an \"American effort to Catholicize Vietnam\" Diệm, according to Dân Xã, exploited American aid money for bribing \"laborers and young students to petition in support of Diệm's ascent to chief-of-state and in favor of deposing Bảo Đại\" [109]\n\n\nPost-Diệm Vietnam\nIn South Vietnam, the overthrow of the Diệm regime in 1963 coincided with the outbreak of large-scale guerrilla warfare Communist Party leaders, now in the Việt Cộng, which had a tremendous military strength throughout the country, in order to exert more effective control over the revolutionary struggle in the Mekong Delta, their strongest position, and to prevent the revolutionary vanguard from being ceded to Hòa Hảo [clarification needed] Despite their military setbacks, the Hòa Hảo maintained their political and religious control over the western portion of the Bassac River and Cần Thơ, the Mekong Delta's regional capital They also preserved their arms and formed paramilitaries to defend the movement's geographical stronghold The Hòa Hảo were too powerful for the Saigon government to continue fighting Starting from Nguyễn Cao Kỳ's government in the mid-1960s, the Hòa Hảo were left alone in the Miền Tây and gained tacit permission to establish a form of sovereignty in exchange for acknowledging South Vietnam's authority They resumed their conflict with the Communists as they were no longer forced to commit their military to the campaign against the central authority The tacit agreement with the South Vietnamese government removed the necessity for keeping a reserve force The Hòa Hảo used their new independence to launch a total war on the Việt Cộng The ARVN aided the Hòa Hảo militia in their fight against the Communists by tying down the Việt Cộng's main force in nearby locations, allowing the militia to focus on fighting Communist guerrillas and infrastructure cadres The anti-Communist campaign of the Hòa Hảo was accompanied by ruthless butchery, and the Communists retaliated in kind [3] [113] [114]\n\n\nFall of Saigon\nThe group's prowess in counter-guerrilla operations was demonstrated by the high level of security in the provinces where it operated An Giang Province had the highest security rating of any province in South Vietnam, despite being surrounded by areas with security ratings near the bottom of the national list Long Xuyên, the provincial capital and only 30 miles from the Cambodian border, was a Hòa Hảo stronghold with the Mekong Delta's second-highest security ranking The region's security prompted American advisors to invite visiting dignitaries to An Giang Province, where the situation was supposedly representative of the remarkable progress made in the war Despite the brutal guerilla warfare that engulfed the rest of the Mekong Delta, An Giang remained a haven of peace until the very end of the conflict. No ARVN division was ever assigned to conduct full-time combat operations in the province, and its efforts were limited to preventing Communist infiltration routes and camps in neighboring provinces Moreover, throughout the Mekong Delta, An Giang's territorial forces had the lowest rate of desertions [116]\n\n\nPresent day and persecution\nThe Vietnamese government officially recognized the Hòa Hảo religion in 1999 [127] In July, half a million Hoahaoists gathered in An Giang Similar religious gatherings of the Hòa Hảo were held in the following years [128] Despite this, the government imposes harsh controls on dissenting Hòa Hảo groups that do not follow the state-sanctioned branch Local rights groups have said that authorities in An Giang harass unapproved devotees on a regular basis, prohibit public readings of the Hòa Hảo founder's writings, and discourage worshipers from visiting Hòa Hảo pagodas in An Giang and adjoining provinces [129] The collective expression of particular Hòa Hảo commemorations, pilgrimage traditions, and freedom of publication are disfavored by the authorities [130] The Vietnamese Communist Party demonstrated its continuation of political domination by renewed arrests of Hòa Hảo activists [128] Two Hoahaoists self-immolated in 2005 to protest religious persecution and in May 2007 nine more were imprisoned following a wave of arrests [131] [132] Unrecognized religious groups, including Hòa Hảo groups, face constant monitoring, harassment, and intimidation, according to a 2020 Human Rights Watch report, and their followers are subjected to public criticism, forced abandonment of faith, arrest, questioning, torture, and incarceration [133] According to other sources, members of the unregistered Hòa Hảo groups were persecuted on numerous occasions, including the imprisonment of six Hoahaoists who were accused of organizing an anti-government protest [134]\n\n\nBranches\nHòa Hảo is divided into three branches referred to as 'sects': pure, neutral, and state-recognized, though all of the sects follow identical practices A small number of Hoahaoists choose not to be a member of an established sect According to Hòa Hảo sources, the state-recognized and pure sects have fewer than 400 adherents, while the others are the members of the neutral sect Adherents of the pure sect are completely committed to the doctrines of Sổ; one of their core ideals is opposing the \"dictatorship\" and they intend to fight to reclaim their \"lawful interest\", whereas the adherents of the neutral sect are in line with the pure sect but don't want to have any problems with the authorities Vietnamese Communist Party's members lead the state-recognized sect [140] According to The Vietnamese, formed by Vietnamese activists and reporters, the pure sect is an unrecognized religious organization, and its members are not permitted to hold their worshiping ceremonies publicly because just the organization's Central Executive Committee has the authority to arrange such events [141]\n\n\nBeliefs\nHòa Hảo's spiritual doctrine is essentially Buddhist It has been labelled as an example of Buddhist protestantism; [22] an amalgam of Buddhism, ancestor worship, animistic rites, and elements of Confucian doctrine, [10] transformed and adapted to the mores and customs of the peasants of the Mekong Delta [105] It was also influenced by millennial aspects of Khmer Buddhism [21]\n\n\nDoctrine\nHòa Hảo's spiritual doctrine is essentially Buddhist It has been labelled as an example of Buddhist protestantism; [22] an amalgam of Buddhism,

few monks Sổ advocated that each devotee could have direct communion with the Buddha, and that inner faith was more important than external rites The faith requires no expensive statues or instruments as the faith believes that a deceased believer who lived a \"correct\" life just needs a simple funeral to expedite him to the afterlife Such precepts were critical in lowering the cost of religion for the peasantry It has earned the descriptor \"poor man's Buddhism\" because of its outward simplicity Hòa Hảo temples are often a simple stucco structure with a thatched roof Religious adornments are similarly simple [36] [148]\n\n\nDemographics\nAccording to a 2019 study by the UK Home Office's fact-finding mission in Vietnam, Hòa Hảo is the country's fourth largest religion [158] According to the United States Department of State's 2019 International Religious Freedom Report, Vietnam's total population was 97.9 million, based on estimates from the US government; [159] Vietnam's government statistics from January 2018 found that the Hoahaoists made about 1.5% of the Vietnamese population [160] Official estimates put the number of Hoahaoists at 1.3 million, although \"unofficial\" estimates put it at more than 2 million [161] Other sources estimate 500,000–1 million, [162] 4–5 million [163] or 8 million [164] Hòa Hảo followers.\n\n\nReferences\nNew religious

Hảo is a new religious movement that originated in Vietnam in the early 20th century. It was founded by Huỳnh Phú Sổ, a charismatic leader who claimed to have prophetic visions and healing powers. The movement gained a significant following among the peasants of the Mekong Delta region, who were attracted to its simple and accessible teachings. Hòa Hảo combines elements of Buddhism, Confucianism, and traditional Vietnamese folk religion, and has been characterized as a form of Buddhist protestantism.\n\n**Designation**\n\nHòa Hảo is a new religious movement that was named after the founder Huỳnh Phú Sổ's native village of Hoa Hao. The name is also spelled as Hoa-Hao, and another label, Hoahaoism, is also rendered as Hoa Haoism. It has also been called Hoa Hao Buddhism (Phật Giáo Hòa Hảo).\n\n**Classification**\n\nThe religious group has been traditionally classified as a Buddhist sect.

literally \"peace and amicability\"), [15] in what is now Thốt Nốt District of An Giang Province, Vietnam [16] The name is also spelled as Hoa-Hao [17] Another label, Hoahaoism, [18] is also rendered as Hoa Haoism [19] [20] It has also been called Hoa Hao Buddhism [2] [21] (Phật Giáo Hòa Hảo) [22] The village of Hoa Hao was renamed Phú Mỹ by the contemporary Communist government [23]\n\n\nClassification\nThe religious group [25] has been traditionally classified as a Buddhist [26] [27] sect [10] [28] [29] [30] General Joseph Lawton Collins, who served as a U.S Special Representative in Vietnam, described Hòa Hảo as a \"pseudo-religious sect\", adding that it \"appealed to the peasants with a veneer of Buddhism and a protective paternalism\" [12] Indeed, the American press of the 1950s labelled Hòa Hảo as \"a pseudo-religious sect which follows a perverted form of Buddhism\", and as \"a rowdy sect of dissident Buddhists\" whose founder \"was sent to a lunatic asylum\" [31]\n\n\nOrigins\nHòa Hảo was founded by Huỳnh Phú Sổ (1919–1947), [37] an ethnic Vietnamese born in 1919 to a Roman Catholic family of small-holders [8] [22] [38] The religious movement was found in the remote Miền Tây region of the Mekong Delta, which was known as Transbassac under French colonial rule In the mid-nineteenth century, the Mekong Delta was a rough frontier society; the political power was shaky, social relations were tenuous, and religious currents were diverse Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, and various spirit cults all had differing impacts on the population The ethnic Vietnamese interacted with Cambodians and Chinese, and everyone was forced to accept French colonial rule in 1867 [11] [16] The religion arose from a tangle of mysticism, magic, and witchcraft, which could be found in most of the region's local beliefs Rooted in earlier Vietnamese anti-colonial religious traditions, the Hòa Hảo philosophy claims to be based on the thoughts of Phật Thầy Tây An (1807–1856), known as Đạo Bửu Sơn Kỳ Hương Tây An, in the 1830s, prophesied the collapse of the Nguyễn Vietnam at the hands of Western powers; the prophecies survived his death and spread throughout the Miền Tây, resulting in two major rebellions in 1875 and 1913 in which the region's French administration was nearly deposed [22]\n\n\nExpansion\nEarly prophecies of Sổ began to come true: he anticipated the eruption of a major war in the Far East and the expulsion of the French by Asians World War II and the Japanese occupation of Indochina seemed to confirm his predictions By 1940, he had gained such influence that the Vichy French governor Jean Decoux, fearing anti-French revolts, had Sổ imprisoned in Bạc Liêu under the pretense that he was a lunatic The imprisonment of Sổ was seen by his followers as an unforgivable act of war against the faith itself In prison, Sổ succeeded in converting his psychiatrist, Dr Tam, who became an ardent supporter A board of French psychiatrists declared him sane in May 1941, though he was exiled upon his release His key supporters were sent to a concentration camp in Nui Bara The French restrictions strengthened his nationalist appeal, and Bạc Liêu soon became a place of Hòa Hảo pilgrimage, although it was far from the movement's strongholds [41] [48] He used the pilgrims to spread religious fervor and anti-French sentiment [30] In 1942, the French could no longer withstand the growing popular reactions generated by Sổ's oracular pronouncements and political instructions, so they exiled him to Laos [49]\n\n\nWorld War II\nEarly prophecies of Sổ began to come true: he anticipated the eruption of a major war in the Far East and the expulsion of the French by Asians World War II and the Japanese occupation of Indochina seemed to confirm his predictions By 1940, he had gained such influence that the Vichy French governor Jean Decoux, fearing anti-French revolts, had Sổ imprisoned in Bạc Liêu under the

spread religious fervor and anti-French sentiment [30] In 1942, the French could no longer withstand the growing popular reactions generated by Sổ's oracular pronouncements and political instructions, so they exiled him to Laos [49]\n\n\nAugust Revolution\nSổ avoided the stigma of being labeled a Japanese puppet by forecasting the empire's defeat months in advance His movement joined the nationalist front that took power in the interregnum [62] following Japan's surrender to establish a united resistance to both the Japanese and the French Sổ requested and received a Communist cadre to assist him in training his followers The Japanese requested from Sổ and his followers more crops, but instead, he advised peasants to stop farming, putting his new alliance with the ICP in jeopardy, as the Communists regarded southern rice as critical to ending the northern famine Peasants were persuaded to partially restore production levels by local Communists, and the ICP maintained its precarious unity with the Hòa Hảo in the common cause of independence The Hòa Hảo, Việt Minh, and Cao Đài, another religious group, united in the independence effort and the ICP took power in Saigon during the August Revolution [63] The Việt Minh proclaimed themselves to be Vietnam's legitimate government The French, alongside the Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo, other local political organizations, and the Binh Xuyen forces all disputed this claim [64] Thus, the Hòa Hảo clashed with Việt Minh as well as the Cao Đài Militarily superior to the Việt Minh, the Hòa Hảo became the main political power in the Mekong Delta region, constituting a huge threat to the Communists The religious leadership was unwilling to toe the Việt Minh line from Hanoi [49] [65]\n\n\nFirst Indochina War\nThe return of the French colonial regime helped to keep the Hòa Hảo and the Việt Minh apart, [49] but it was also a major disappointment to the Hòa Hảo Sổ had hoped that his religious movement would become the de facto ruling power throughout most of Cochinchina, but the arrival of a larger French force put an end to such ambitions The Hòa Hảo turned inward to strengthen their religious power and expand their political influence in the Mekong Delta As the French grew increasingly skeptical of the Việt Minh, they started aiding the Hòa Hảo In fact, throughout the First Indochina War (1946–1954), the French government issued support payments for Cao Đài, Hòa Hao, and Bình Xuyên armed forces in exchange for defense of the territories they controlled against the Việt Minh They granted the Hòa Hảo hegemony over the southwestern Mekong Delta and eventually provided arms for some 20,000 Hoahaoists In return for aid against the Việt Minh, the new Hòa Hảo leadership was willing to form alliances with the colonialists; they did not see such an agreement as a betrayal of their nationalist ideals because the ultimate goal of religious independence was not jeopardized [14] [72] The Hòa Hảo periodically tied Việt Minh sympathizers together and threw them into the river to drown The Việt Minh were worried by Sổ's nationalist credentials and social structure, and attempted to co-opt him into a National Unified Front (NUF) [49] [73]\n\n\nPost-Sổ period\nSổ's death created a power vacuum within the religious leadership Because he was the sole unexceptional candidate among vying competitors, Sổ's father Huỳnh Công Bộ was hurriedly chosen to succeed him as its leader [83] He was the former chief of the Hòa Hảo village, and served as the religious doctrine's guardian and movement's leader until his death [80] Despite this, he lacked his son's charm, authority, political savvy, and ideological obsession [83] Therefore, the movement began to lose momentum, leading to factionalism, parochialism, and outside organization influence, [11] which caused an increase in violence as the various internal factions engaged in conflicts among themselves [84] The religious group split into four factions, each led by a former military subordinate of Sổ, [30] while Soái assumed the title of commander in chief of the Hòa Hảo armed forces [85] The factionalized leaders were far more violent, resorting to public burnings, beheadings, and mass executions of ethnic Khmers and Vietnamese [21] None of the military commanders were concerned with anything other than their own self-promotion, and none of the civilian leaders had Sổ's capacity to guide them or preach moderation [86] Their violence was not limited to South Vietnam; they would cross borders and pillage Cambodian villages Local Khmers responded by creating defense groups to fight the Hòa Hảo, while others converted to assure their safety [87] Despite this, the Hòa Hảo declared eternal war against the Communists Haseman argues that Sổ's assassination was a major miscalculation on the part of the Việt Minh, who falsely believed at the time that the Hòa Hảo lacked the strength to fight both the French and the Communists By mid-1947, the Hoahaoists were committed to armed combat against the Việt Minh [78] During the First Indochina War, because of their shared antipathy towards the Việt Minh and the need to find a source of financial support to replace French wartime subsidies, Hòa Hảo maintained a level of cooperation with Cao Đài and Bình Xuyên In the months leading up to the Franco–Việt Minh ceasefire, these shared interests held the factions together They temporarily halted their conflicts with the French, signing a military treaty with them on 8 May 1947, less than a month after Sổ's assassination [88]\n\n\nDelta triumvirate\nFollowing Sổ's assassination, the religious movement expanded its territory to include Cần Thơ Province They controlled over a third of southern Vietnam, elected their own officials, [89] and built significant infrastructure for collecting taxes and recruiting armed forces [90] Soái formed an alliance with the French, providing Hòa Hảo troops as auxiliary forces; [79] however, several other Hòa Hảo leaders refused to recognize Soái's leadership, and the religion continued to be riven by rivalries and factionalism [85] Nevertheless, it transformed into a French-backed [87] 20,000-strong army [91] They ruled most of the upper central delta, [92] and, along with the Cao Đài and Bình Xuyên, established a triumvirate in the mid-1950s, early in the Vietnam War (1955–1975), that grew in strength and constituted a significant threat to South Vietnam This republic was regarded by the Hòa Hảo as just another in a series of central governments aiming to subjugate the Hòa Hảo to their rule [78]\n\n\nSect crisis\nGeneral J Lawton Collins believed that Diệm would be doomed if he yielded in to the movement's demands [96] He thought that the groups' boldness in presenting this ultimatum strongly suggested that they were planning anti-Diệm rallies in Saigon According to Collins, the Saigon government could not have allowed rallies to go unchallenged and had to intervene to put an end to them He advised Diệm to reach an agreement with the UFNF in order to persuade its members to becoming government loyalists Initially, Diệm agreed to negotiate with the UFNF leaders, but when they stated that their demands were non-negotiable, he abandoned the idea [96] He was certain that the VNA would carry out his orders to suppress any opposition group, as he had gained the loyalty of many army officers in recent months and had replaced many others who had not Collins, however, underestimated the army's support for Diệm and advised him to avoid using brute force and instead seek a compromise Though Collins discouraged Diệm from executing his plans against Bình Xuyên, the latter, suspicious of a VNA attack, made a move on Diệm loyalists without first seeking America's consent This resulted in a conflict between the two that temporarily halted with a ceasefire enforced by the French Commissioner-General Paul Ély [101] Collins went to Washington with the determination that Diệm had to be replaced U.S President Dwight Eisenhower honored his decision and U.S Secretary of State John Foster Dulles penned telegrams to Saigon, informing Bảo Đại and other Vietnamese leaders to find a replacement for Diệm These plans were halted when a new battle began in Saigon between the VNA and Bình Xuyên The Diệm loyalists crushed Bình Xuyên, with the latter being saved from total annihilation only with Ély's intervention [102]\n\n\n1955 referendum\nDuring a referendum organized by Diệm in October, Hòa Hảo forces staged sporadic attacks on the polling stations of Cần Tho, though there was not much opposition to this political maneuver [107] Communist politician Lê Duẩn met with Soái and Ba Cụt, and, despite their ideological differences, they agreed to form the Southern Committee of the Patriotic Front, which eventually included remnants not only from the Hòa Hảo but also the Cao Đài and Bình Xuyên rebel armies [108] Soái declared the referendum unconstitutional, stating his preference for a true democratic state Diệm's political maneuvers were also criticized by Ba Cụt, who claimed that the referendum was an opportunity to force the people to \"depose Bảo Đại and proclaim the puppet Diệm as the chief-of-state of Vietnam\" Diệm reportedly received $4 million in aid from the American government and American Catholic organizations to support the referendum, which Ba Cụt stated was part of an \"American effort to Catholicize Vietnam\" Diệm, according to Dân Xã, exploited American aid money for bribing \"laborers and young students to petition in support of Diệm's ascent to chief-of-state and in favor of deposing Bảo Đại\" [109]\n\n\nPost-Diệm Vietnam\nIn South Vietnam, the overthrow of the Diệm regime in 1963 coincided with the outbreak of large-scale guerrilla warfare Communist Party leaders, now in the Việt Cộng, which had a tremendous military strength throughout the country, in order to exert more effective control over the revolutionary struggle in the Mekong Delta, their strongest position, and to prevent the revolutionary vanguard from being ceded to Hòa Hảo [clarification needed] Despite their military setbacks, the Hòa Hảo maintained their political and religious control over the western portion of the Bassac River and Cần Thơ, the Mekong Delta's regional capital They also preserved their arms and formed paramilitaries to defend the movement's geographical stronghold The Hòa Hảo were too powerful for the Saigon government to continue fighting Starting from Nguyễn Cao Kỳ's government in the mid-1960s, the Hòa Hảo were left alone in the Miền Tây and gained tacit permission to establish a form of sovereignty in exchange for acknowledging South Vietnam's authority They resumed their conflict with the Communists as they were no longer forced to commit their military to the campaign against the central authority The tacit agreement with the South Vietnamese government removed the necessity for keeping a reserve force The Hòa Hảo used their new independence to launch a total war on the Việt Cộng The ARVN aided the Hòa Hảo militia in their fight against the Communists by tying down the Việt Cộng's main force in nearby locations, allowing the militia to focus on fighting Communist guerrillas and infrastructure cadres The anti-Communist campaign of the Hòa Hảo was accompanied by ruthless butchery, and the Communists retaliated in kind [3] [113] [114]\n\n\nFall of Saigon\nThe group's prowess in counter-guerrilla operations was demonstrated by the high level of security in the provinces where it operated An Giang Province had the highest security rating of any province in South Vietnam, despite being surrounded by areas with security ratings near the bottom of the national list Long Xuyên, the provincial capital and only 30 miles from the Cambodian border, was a Hòa Hảo stronghold with the Mekong Delta's second-highest security ranking The region's security prompted American advisors to invite visiting dignitaries to An Giang Province, where the situation was supposedly representative of the remarkable progress made in the war Despite the brutal guerilla warfare that engulfed the rest of the Mekong Delta, An Giang remained a haven of peace until the very end of the conflict. No ARVN division was ever assigned to conduct full-time combat operations in the province, and its efforts were limited to preventing Communist infiltration routes and camps in neighboring provinces Moreover, throughout the Mekong Delta, An Giang's territorial forces had the lowest rate of desertions [116]\n\n\nPresent day and persecution\nThe Vietnamese government officially recognized the Hòa Hảo religion in 1999 [127] In July, half a million Hoahaoists gathered in An Giang Similar religious gatherings of the Hòa Hảo were held in the following years [128] Despite this, the government imposes harsh controls on dissenting Hòa Hảo groups that do not follow the state-sanctioned branch Local rights groups have said that authorities in An Giang harass unapproved devotees on a regular basis, prohibit public readings of the Hòa Hảo founder's writings, and discourage worshipers from visiting Hòa Hảo pagodas in An Giang and adjoining provinces [129] The collective expression of particular Hòa Hảo commemorations, pilgrimage traditions, and freedom of publication are disfavored by the authorities [130] The Vietnamese Communist Party demonstrated its continuation of political domination by renewed arrests of Hòa Hảo activists [128] Two Hoahaoists self-immolated in 2005 to protest religious persecution and in May 2007 nine more were imprisoned following a wave of arrests [131] [132] Unrecognized religious groups, including Hòa Hảo groups, face constant monitoring, harassment, and intimidation, according to a 2020 Human Rights Watch report, and their followers are subjected to public criticism, forced abandonment of faith, arrest, questioning, torture, and incarceration [133] According to other sources, members of the unregistered Hòa Hảo groups were persecuted on numerous occasions, including the imprisonment of six Hoahaoists who were accused of organizing an anti-government protest [134]\n\n\nBranches\nHòa Hảo is divided into three branches referred to as 'sects': pure, neutral, and state-recognized, though all of the sects follow identical practices A small number of Hoahaoists choose not to be a member of an established sect According to Hòa Hảo sources, the state-recognized and pure sects have fewer than 400 adherents, while the others are the members of the neutral sect Adherents of the pure sect are completely committed to the doctrines of Sổ; one of their core ideals is opposing the \"dictatorship\" and they intend to fight to reclaim their \"lawful interest\", whereas the adherents of the neutral sect are in line with the pure sect but don't want to have any problems with the authorities Vietnamese Communist Party's members lead the state-recognized sect [140] According to The Vietnamese, formed by Vietnamese activists and reporters, the pure sect is an unrecognized religious organization, and its members are not permitted to hold their worshiping ceremonies publicly because just the organization's Central Executive Committee has the authority to arrange such events [141]\n\n\nBeliefs\nHòa Hảo's spiritual doctrine is essentially Buddhist It has been labelled as an example of Buddhist protestantism; [22] an amalgam of Buddhism, ancestor worship, animistic rites, and elements of Confucian doctrine, [10] transformed and adapted to the mores and customs of the peasants of the Mekong Delta [105] It was also influenced by millennial aspects of Khmer Buddhism [21]\n\n\nDoctrine\nHòa Hảo's spiritual doctrine is essentially Buddhist It has been labelled as an example of Buddhist protestantism; [22] an amalgam of Buddhism,

millennial aspects of Khmer Buddhism [21]\n\n\nPractices\nUnlike orthodox Buddhism, Hòa Hảo eschews elaborate rituals, temples, maintains no monastic order, and teaches home practice, though it has a few monks Sổ advocated that each devotee could have direct communion with the Buddha, and that inner faith was more important than external rites The faith requires no expensive statues or instruments as the faith believes that a deceased believer who lived a \"correct\" life just needs a simple funeral to expedite him to the afterlife Such precepts were critical in lowering the cost of religion for the peasantry It has earned the descriptor \"poor man's Buddhism\" because of its outward simplicity Hòa Hảo temples are often a simple stucco structure with a thatched roof Religious adornments are similarly simple [36] [148]\n\n\nDemographics\nAccording to a 2019 study by the UK Home Office's fact-finding mission in Vietnam, Hòa Hảo is the country's fourth largest religion [158] According to the United States Department of State's 2019 International Religious Freedom Report, Vietnam's total population was 97.9 million, based on estimates from the US government; [159] Vietnam's government statistics from January 2018 found that the Hoahaoists made about 1.5% of the Vietnamese population [160] Official estimates put the number of Hoahaoists at 1.3 million, although \"unofficial\" estimates put it at more than 2 million [161] Other sources estimate 500,000–1 million, [162] 4–5 million [163] or 8 million [164] Hòa Hảo followers.\n\n\nReferences\nNew religious

{"title": "Sex", "content": "\nSexual reproduction\nSexual reproduction, in which two individuals produce an offspring that possesses a selection of the genetic traits of each parent, is exclusive to eukaryotes Genetic traits are encoded in the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of chromosomes The eukaryote cell has a set of paired homologous chromosomes, one from each parent, and this double-chromosome stage is called \"diploid\" During sexual reproduction, a diploid organism produces specialized haploid sex cells called gametes via meiosis, [11] each of which has a single set of chromosomes Meiosis involves a stage of genetic recombination  via chromosomal crossover, in which regions of DNA are exchanged between matched pairs of chromosomes, to form new chromosomes, each with a new combination of the genes of the parents Then the chromosomes are separated into single sets in the gametes When gametes fuse during fertilization, the resulting zygote has half of the genetic material of the mother and half of the father [12] The combination of chromosomal crossover and fertilization, bringing the two single sets of chromosomes together to make a new diploid zygote, results in a new organism that contains a different set of the genetic traits of each parent.\n\n\nAnimals\nApproximately 95% of animal species have separate male and female individuals, and are said to be gonochoric About 5% of animal species are hermaphroditic [28] This low percentage is partially attributable to the very large number of insect species, in which hermaphroditism is absent [29] About 99% of vertebrates are gonochoric, and the remaining 1% that are hermaphroditic are almost all fishes [30]\n\n\nPlants\nThe majority of plants are bisexual, [31]: 212  either hermaphrodite (with both stamens and pistil in the same flower) or monoecious [32] [33] In dioecious species male and female sexes are on separate plants [34] About 5% of flowering plants are dioecious, resulting from as many as 5000 independent origins [35] Dioecy is common in gymnosperms, in which about 65% of species are dioecious, but most conifers are monoecious [36]\n\n\nFungi\nMost species of fungus can reproduce sexually and have life cycles with both haploid and diploid phases These species of fungus are typically isogamous, i.e lacking male and female specialization One haploid fungus grows into contact with another, and then they fuse their cells In some cases, the fusion is asymmetric, and the cell which donates only a nucleus (and no accompanying cellular material) could arguably be considered male [25] Fungi may also have more complex allelic mating systems, with other sexes not accurately described as male, female, or hermaphroditic [26]\n\n\nSexual systems\nA sexual system is a distribution of male and female functions across organisms in a species [28]\n\n\nAnimals\nApproximately 95% of animal species have separate male and female individuals, and are said to be gonochoric About 5% of

ancestral to anisogamy [37] and that anisogamy evolved several times independently in different groups of eukaryotes, including protists, algae, plants, and animals [29] The evolution of anisogamy is synonymous with the origin of male and the origin of female [38] It is also the first step towards sexual dimorphism [39] and influenced the evolution of various sex differences [40]\n\n\nAdaptive function of sex\nThe most basic role of meiosis appears to be conservation of the integrity of the genome that is passed on to progeny by parents [46] [47] The two most fundamental aspects of sexual reproduction, meiotic recombination and outcrossing, are likely maintained respectively by the adaptive advantages of recombinational repair of genomic DNA damage and genetic complementation which masks the expression of deleterious recessive mutations [48] Genetic variation, often produced as a byproduct of these processes, may provide long-term advantages in those sexual lineages that favor outcrossing [48]\n\n\nSex-determination systems\nThe biological cause of an organism developing into one sex or the other is called sex determination  The cause may be genetic, environmental, haplodiploidy, or multiple factors [29]  Within animals and other organisms that have genetic sex-determination systems, the determining factor may be the presence of a sex chromosome In plants that are sexually dimorphic, such as Ginkgo biloba, [24]: 203  the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha or the dioecious species in the flowering plant genus Silene, sex may also be determined by sex chromosomes [49] Non-genetic systems may use environmental cues, such as the temperature during early development in crocodiles, to determine the sex of the offspring [50]\n\n\nGenetic\nHumans and most other mammals have an XY sex-determination system: the Y chromosome carries factors responsible for triggering male development, making XY sex determination mostly based on the presence or absence of the Y chromosome It is the male gamete that determines the sex of the offspring [52] In this system XX mammals typically are female and XY typically are male [29] However, individuals with XXY or XYY are males, while individuals with X and XXX are females [8] Unusually, the platypus, a monotreme mammal, has ten sex chromosomes; females have ten X chromosomes, and males have five X

birds, which have a ZW sex-determination system, the W chromosome carries factors responsible for female development, and default development is male [57] In this case, ZZ individuals are male and ZW are female It is the female gamete that determines the sex of the offspring This system is used by birds, some fish, and some crustaceans [8]\n\n\nXO sex determination\nIn the XO sex-determination system, males have one X chromosome (XO) while females have two (XX) All other chromosomes in these diploid organisms are paired, but organisms may inherit one or two X chromosomes This system is found in most arachnids, insects such as silverfish (Apterygota), dragonflies (Paleoptera) and grasshoppers (Exopterygota), and some nematodes, crustaceans, and gastropods [59] [60]\n\n\nZO sex determination\nIn the ZO sex-determination system, males have two Z chromosomes whereas females have one This system is found in several species of moths [63]\n\n\nEnvironmental\nFor many species, sex is not determined by inherited traits, but instead by environmental factors such as temperature experienced during development or later in life [64]\n\n\nSequential hermaphroditism\nSome species can change sex over the course of their lifespan, a phenomenon called sequential hermaphroditism [65]\n\n\nTemperature-dependent sex determination\nMany reptiles, including all crocodiles and most turtles, have temperature-dependent sex determination In these species, the temperature experienced by the embryos during their development determines their sex [29]\n\n\nHaplodiploidy\nCertain insects, such as honey bees and ants, use a haplodiploid sex-determination system [69] Diploid bees and ants are generally female, and haploid individuals (which develop from unfertilized eggs) are male This sex-determination system results in highly biased sex ratios, as the sex of offspring is determined by fertilization (arrhenotoky or pseudo-arrhenotoky resulting in males) rather than the assortment of chromosomes during meiosis [70]\n\n\nSex ratio\n\n\n\nSex differences\nAnisogamy is the fundamental difference between male and female [77] [78] Richard Dawkins has stated that it is possible to interpret all the differences between the sexes as stemming from this [79]\n\n\nSexual characteristics\nIn many animals and some plants, individuals of male and female sex differ in size and appearance, a phenomenon called sexual dimorphism [81] Sexual dimorphism in animals is often associated with sexual selection: the mating competition between individuals of one sex vis-à-vis the opposite sex [82] Other examples demonstrate that it is the preference of females that drives sexual dimorphism, such as in the case of the stalk-eyed fly [83]\n\n\nSexual dimorphism\nIn many animals

in some species, such as some coucals, the males invest more parental care [92] Females also tend to be more choosy for who they mate with, [93] such as most bird species [94] Males tend to be more

fundamental aspect of biology, influencing the reproduction and development of organisms. It is characterized by the presence of male and female individuals, each with distinct genetic, physiological, and behavioral traits. The differences between males and females are often a result of sexual reproduction, a process that involves the combination of genetic material from two parents to produce offspring.\n\n**Sexual Reproduction**\n\nSexual reproduction is exclusive to eukaryotes, which are organisms with complex cells that contain a nucleus and other organelles. During sexual reproduction, a diploid organism produces specialized haploid sex cells called gametes via meiosis. Each gamete has a single set of chromosomes, which are paired homologous chromosomes from each parent.

These species of fungus are typically isogamous, i.e., lacking male and female specialization. One haploid fungus grows into contact with another, and then they fuse their cells. In some cases, the fusion is asymmetric, and the cell that donates only a nucleus (and no accompanying cellular material) could arguably be considered male.\n\n**Sexual Systems**\n\nA sexual system is a distribution of male and female functions across organisms in a species. The most common sexual system is the gonochoric system, in which individuals are either male or female. However, some species exhibit hermaphroditism, in which individuals have both male and female reproductive organs. Other species exhibit sequential hermaphroditism, in which individuals can change sex over the course of their lifespan.\n\n**Evolution of Sex**\n\nThe evolution of sex is a complex and still-unresolved process. It is generally accepted that isogamy was ancestral to anisogamy, and that anisogamy evolved several times independently in different groups of eukaryotes. The evolution of anisogamy is synonymous with the origin of male and the origin of female. It is also the first step towards sexual dimorphism and influenced the evolution of various sex differences.\n\n**Adaptive Function of Sex**\n\nThe most basic role of meiosis appears to be conservation of the integrity of the genome that is passed on to progeny by parents.

Many reptiles, including all crocodiles and most turtles, have temperature-dependent sex determination, in which the temperature experienced by the embryos during their development determines their sex.\n\n**Haplodiploidy**\n\nCertain insects, such as honey bees and ants, use a haplodiploid sex-determination system, in which diploid bees and ants are generally female, and haploid individuals are male. This sex-determination system results in highly biased sex ratios, as the sex of offspring is determined by fertilization rather than the assortment of chromosomes during meiosis.\n\n**Sex Ratio**\n\nThe sex ratio of a species is the proportion of males to females in a population. The sex ratio can vary depending on the species, with some species exhibiting a 1:1 sex ratio, while others exhibit a highly biased sex ratio.\n\n**Sex Differences**\n\nSex differences are the physiological, behavioral, and anatomical differences between males and females. Anisogamy, or the fundamental difference between males and females, is often a result of sexual selection and the evolution of sex differences.\n\n**Sexual Characteristics**\n\nIn many animals and some plants, individuals of male and female sex differ in size and appearance, a phenomenon called sexual dimorphism. Sexual dimorphism in animals is often associated with sexual selection, the mating competition between individuals of one sex vis-à-vis the opposite sex.\n\n**Behavioral Sex Differences**\n\nThe sexes across gonochoric species usually differ in behavior. Females tend to invest more in parental care, while males tend to be more competitive for mating. Females also tend to be more choosy for who they mate with, while males tend to be more aggressive and dominant.\n\n**Distinction from Gender**\n\nSex and gender are often used interchangeably, but they are distinct concepts. Sex refers to the biological and physiological differences between males and females, while gender refers to the social and cultural roles and expectations associated with being male or female.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Reproduction\n* Evolution\n* Genetics\n* Biology\n* Sexuality\n\n**References**\n\n* \"Sex\" (2019).

behavior\nThe sexes across gonochoric species usually differ in behavior In most animal species, females invest more in parental care, [91] although in some species, such as some coucals, the males invest more parental care [92] Females also tend to be more choosy for who they mate with, [93] such as most bird species [94] Males tend to be more competitive for mating than females

(January 1, 1894 – February 4, 1974) was a renowned Indian physicist who made significant contributions to the field of physics, particularly in the areas of statistical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and field theory. He is best known for his work on the Bose-Einstein statistics, which describes the behavior of bosons, a class of particles that includes photons, gluons, and Higgs bosons.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nSatyendra Nath Bose was born in Calcutta (now Kolkata), the eldest of seven children in a Bengali Kayastha family.

He proposed a new method of counting particles, which later became known as the Bose-Einstein statistics. This theory describes the behavior of bosons, which are particles that can occupy the same quantum state, unlike fermions, which are particles that obey the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n**Bose-Einstein Condensate**\n\nEinstein also did not at first realize how radical Bose's departure was, and in his first paper after Bose, he was guided, like Bose, by the fact that the new method gave the right answer.

coach of the Miami Heat after Pat Riley's decision to step down Spoelstra was Riley's hand-picked successor [23] In naming Spoelstra as head coach, Riley said: \"This game is now about younger coaches who are technologically skilled, innovative, and bring fresh new ideas That's what we feel we are getting with Erik Spoelstra He's a man that was born to coach.\" [7] Spoelstra became the first Asian American head coach in the NBA, and the first Asian American head coach in the history of the four major North American sports leagues [6] He led the Heat to the NBA Playoffs in his first year as head

{"title": "Josh_Hawley", "content": "\nEarly life and education\nJoshua David Hawley was born on December 31, 1979, [17] in Springdale, Arkansas, to banker Ronald Hawley and teacher Virginia Hawley In 1981, the Hawleys moved to Lexington, Missouri, after Ronald joined a division of Boatmen's Bancshares there [18] [19] [20] [21] [22]\n\n\nEarly career\nHawley spent two years as a law clerk after law school, clerking first for Judge Michael W McConnell of the U.S Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit from 2006 to 2007, then for Chief Justice John Roberts of the U.S Supreme Court from 2007 to 2008 [19] While at the Supreme Court, Hawley met his future wife, Erin Morrow, now known as Erin Hawley, a fellow Yale Law graduate who was also clerking for Roberts [25] [29] [30]\n\n\n2016 Missouri attorney general campaign\nHawley launched his campaign for attorney general of Missouri on July 23, 2015 [35] Of the $9.2 million raised for the campaign, $4.4 million was provided by David Humphreys, CEO of Joplin-based Tamko Building Products [36] On August 2, 2016, Hawley defeated Kurt Schaefer in the Republican primary with 64% of the vote [37] He defeated Democrat Teresa Hensley in the general election with 58.5% of the vote [37] During the campaign, Hawley criticized \"career politicians\" who were \"climbing the ladder\" from one position to another, which later became a point of bipartisan criticism of him when he ran for the U.S Senate two years later [38]\n\n\nAttorney general of Missouri (2017–2019)\nHawley was sworn in as attorney general on January 9, 2017, by Missouri Supreme Court chief justice Patricia Breckenridge [39] [40]\n\n\nDeath of Tory Sanders\nOn May 5, 2017, Tory Sanders, a Black motorist who had taken a wrong turn in Tennessee ran out of gas in rural Mississippi County, Missouri He had gotten lost and was confused and asked a gas station attendant to call the police for assistance Deputies responded and put him in the county jail His mental condition had deteriorated further and he resisted when jail staff, under the command of Sheriff Cory Hutcheson, tried to release him as they had no grounds on which to hold him Hutcheson, who himself faced and later was convicted of a variety of federal and state charges, led a team of police and jailers who repeatedly pepper-sprayed and tasered Sanders throughout the day Hutcheson eventually led a team of cops and jailers into the cell and swarmed Sanders, who went into cardiac arrest and died The cause of death was judged to be \"excited delirium\", a condition frequently cited in custody-related deaths but not recognized by major psychiatric authorities [41] [42]\n\n\nOpioid manufacturer lawsuit and investigation\nIn June 2017, Hawley announced that Missouri had filed suit in state court against three major drug companies, Endo Health Solutions, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, and Purdue Pharma, for allegedly hiding the danger of prescription painkillers and contributing to the opioid epidemic The state argued that the companies violated Missouri consumer protection and Medicaid laws [45] [46] The damages sought were among the largest in state history, on the order of hundreds of millions of dollars [45]\n\n\nRape kit audit\nOn October 29, 2017, the Columbia Missourian published an exposé describing a large backlog of untested rape kits in Missouri and the long-ignored efforts of rape survivors and law enforcement agencies to have the state address the backlog [49] On November 29, Hawley announced a statewide audit of the number of untested rape kits [50] The results were made public in May 2018; there were 5,000 such kits [50] In August 2018, One Nation, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit connected to Republican campaign strategist Karl Rove, ran commercials giving Hawley credit for identifying the problem, a claim The St Louis Post-Dispatch labeled misleading [49] In September 2020, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt announced that of the 16 rape kit tests that were consequently uploaded to the national DNA database, 11 revealed the names of known criminals, and were referred for possible prosecution [51]\n\n\nInvestigations into tech companies\nIn November 2017, Hawley opened an investigation into whether Google's business practices violated state consumer protection and anti-trust laws The investigation was focused on what data Google collects from users of its services, how it uses content providers' content, and whether its search engine results are biased [52] [53]\n\n\nGreitens scandals\nIn December 2017, The Kansas City Star reported that Missouri's Republican Governor Eric Greitens and senior members of his staff used Confide, a messaging app that erases texts after they have been read, on their personal phones They were accused by government transparency advocates of subverting Missouri's open records laws [55] Hawley initially declined to prosecute, citing a Missouri Supreme Court ruling that the attorney general cannot simultaneously represent a state officer and take legal action against that officer, but on December 20, 2017, he announced his office would investigate after all, saying that his clients are \"first and foremost the citizens of the state\" [56] [57] [58] Hawley said text messages between government employees, whether made on private or government-issued phones, should be treated the same as emails: a determination must be made as to whether the text is a public record, and if so, whether it is subject to disclosure [56] His investigation found that no laws had been broken [59] In March 2018, six former Missouri attorneys released a letter calling the investigation \"half-hearted\" Hawley's spokesperson called the letter a partisan attack [59]\n\n\nAffordable Care Act lawsuit\nIn February 2018, Hawley joined 20 other Republican-led states in a lawsuit challenging the Affordable Care Act as unconstitutional [69] Though some argued the lawsuit would eliminate insurance protections for people with preexisting conditions, Hawley said he supported protections for preexisting conditions [70] In September 2018, amid criticism from Hawley's U.S Senate opponent Claire McCaskill about the lawsuit's impact on preexisting conditions, Hawley's office said that he supported protections for individuals with preexisting conditions [70] Hawley later published an op-ed in the Springfield News-Leader explaining that he supported protecting those with preexisting conditions by creating a taxpayer subsidy to reimburse insurance companies for covering these high-cost patients [71] In December 2018, Judge Reed O'Connor ruled the entirety of the ACA unconstitutional, but on appeal, the Fifth Circuit did not agree that the entire law should be voided [72] [73] [74]\n\n\nSentencing of Bobby Bostic\nIn March 2018, Hawley defended the 1995 sentencing of Bobby Bostic, a Missouri man who had committed robbery and other crimes at the age of 16, to 241 years in prison Bostic and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had attempted to appeal his sentence to the Supreme Court, saying it violated the court's ruling in Graham v Florida, which held that juveniles could not be sentenced to life imprisonment for charges lesser than homicide [75] In a Supreme Court filing, Hawley argued that Bostic's sentencing did not violate the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment, and that Graham v Florida only applied to a sentence for one crime [76] The judge who sentenced Bostic said she had come to believe the sentence was too harsh, and asked to join an amicus brief filed by 26 former judges, prosecutors and law enforcement officials [75] [76] On April 24, the Supreme Court rejected Bostic's appeal [75]\n\n\nState staff used for campaign and Sunshine Law violations\nOn November 14, 2022, Cole County Circuit Court Judge Jon Beetem ruled that Hawley violated Missouri's open records law during his 2018 U.S Senate campaign by withholding emails between his out-of-state political consultants and his taxpayer-funded staff Beetem granted summary judgment, ruled Hawley's office had \"knowingly and purposefully\" violated Missouri's Sunshine Law, and fined the AG's office $12,000 When Hawley was AG, his staff used private email instead of government accounts to communicate with his political consultants Those consultants illegally gave direct guidance and tasks to Hawley's staff and led meetings during office hours in the Missouri Supreme Court building [77] Beetem wrote, \"There is no genuine dispute that the AGO knew the Sunshine Law required it to produce responsive documents in its possession when it received DSCC's two Sunshine Law requests, but made the conscious decision not to do so.\" [77]\n\n\nCatholic clergy investigation\nIn August 2018, after a Pennsylvania grand jury released a report detailing over 1,000 cases of sexual abuse by Catholic clerics, as well as protests by survivors of clergy sexual abuse in St Louis, Hawley announced that he would begin an investigation into potential cases of abuse in Missouri [79] Missouri was one of several states to launch such investigations in the wake of the Pennsylvania report; the attorneys general of Illinois, Nebraska, and New Mexico began similar inquiries [80] Hawley promised that he would investigate any crimes, publish a report for the public, and refer potential cases to local law enforcement officials Archbishop of St Louis Robert James Carlson pledged cooperation with the inquiry [79] [81]\n\n\nU.S. Senate\nIn August 2017, Hawley formed an exploratory campaign committee for the U.S Senate [83] [84] In October 2017, he declared his candidacy for the Republican nomination in Missouri's 2018 U.S Senate election for the seat held by Democrat Claire McCaskill [85] [86] Before the official announcement, four former Republican U.S senators from Missouri (John Ashcroft, Kit Bond, John Danforth, and McCaskill's predecessor, Jim Talent) asked Hawley to run for the Senate seat [87]\n\n\nElections\nIn 2023, Hawley introduced the Ending Corporate Influence on Elections Act, a bill that would reverse aspects of Citizens United v FEC, specifically banning publicly traded companies from making independent expenditures, political advertisements for campaigns, and Super PAC contributions Mitch McConnell criticized the bill and warned other Republican senators against signing on, naming a list of senators, including Hawley, who benefited directly from the Senate Leadership Fund [195]\n\n\n2018\nIn August 2017, Hawley formed an exploratory campaign committee for the U.S Senate [83] [84] In October 2017, he declared his candidacy for the Republican nomination in Missouri's 2018 U.S Senate election for the seat held by Democrat Claire McCaskill [85] [86] Before the official announcement, four former Republican U.S senators from Missouri (John Ashcroft, Kit Bond, John Danforth, and McCaskill's predecessor, Jim Talent) asked Hawley to run for the Senate seat [87]\n\n\n2024\nHawley is seeking a second Senate term [100] He faces Democratic nominee Lucas Kunce, a U.S Marine veteran [101] Hawley and Kunce had a heated debate about debates in front of press at the Governor's Ham Breakfast, in which both expressed their intentions to debate Hawley pushed for a forum hosted by Missouri Farm Bureau; Kunce pressed for broadcast debates and suggested that the Missouri Farm Bureau's endorsement of Hawley presented legal complications [102]\n\n\nTenure\nHawley was sworn in as a U.S senator on January 3, 2019 [107]\n\n\nAttempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results\nAfter Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election, Hawley announced his intention to object to the Senate's certification of the Electoral College vote count on January 6, 2021 [3] He was the first senator to do so [4] Trump had refused to concede and made frequent baseless claims of fraud in the election Hawley said that his attempt to reverse the election result was on behalf of those \"concerned about election integrity.\" [3] [126] He made numerous statements suggesting that Trump could possibly remain in office [10] The New York Times wrote that Hawley was elevating false claims that President-elect Joe Biden stole the election [3] His maneuver prompted bipartisan condemnation of his action as undemocratic [127] [128]\n\n\nActivity around storming of the U.S. Capitol and public reaction\nOn January 6, 2021, when Congress met to count the electoral votes for the 2020 presidential election, they were interrupted by pro-Trump rioters who stormed the U.S Capitol building, forcing members of Congress to evacuate Before the counting of the votes, to which Hawley had publicly announced he would object, he was photographed saluting the protestors with a raised fist outside the Capitol before the riot [136] [137] The photograph immediately became a subject of controversy; The Kansas City Star called it \"the image that will haunt Josh Hawley\" and \"one of the iconic images to emerge from the day the Capitol was breached by rioters\" [135] and Pulitzer Prize-winning St Louis Post-Dispatch columnist Tony Messenger said \"the staging was perfect\" and recommended the photograph be known as Hawley: The Face of Sedition [138] Tom Coleman, a former U.S representative from Missouri and a fellow Republican, said Hawley's \"clenched fist in front of the Capitol will seal his fate.\" [135] The photographer, Francis Chung, declined to weigh in on the photograph's political impact, saying it \"is what it is\" and \"kind of speaks for itself.\" [135] Later that day, video showed Hawley running through the Capitol, fleeing the rioters [139]\n\n\nCommittee assignments\nFor the 117th United States Congress, Hawley was named to four Senate committees [177] They are:\n\n\nPolitical positions\nHawley's political views have been described as nationalist [179] and populist [180] He has been called a Trump loyalist [152] [181]\n\n\nAbortion\nHawley opposes abortion and has called for the appointment of \"constitutionalist, pro-life judges\" to the U.S Supreme Court and other federal courts [182] He has called Roe v Wade \"one of the most unjust decisions\" in American judicial history Missouri's Right to Life PAC endorsed Hawley for Senate [182] In July 2020, Hawley wrote that to earn his support, a Supreme Court nominee must have publicly, on the record, before nomination, asserted that Roe v Wade was incorrectly decided [183] Later that year he voted to confirm Amy Coney Barrett, who had strongly criticized Roe v Wade without explicitly saying it was wrongly decided and declined to do so during hearings Hawley said the nominee was \"the most openly pro-life judicial nominee to the Supreme Court in my lifetime.\" [184] [185]\n\n\nChristian nationalism\nHawley has advocated Christian nationalism, writing: \"Some will say now that I am calling America a Christian nation So I am .. And some will say that I am advocating Christian nationalism And so I do.\" Hawley asserts that the U.S was \"founded by Christian believers and that our fundamental ideals, including those in the Constitution, Declaration of Independence, and Bill of Rights all come to us from a Christian tradition.\" [186] [187] Political scientist Tim Lewis says this is inaccurate, citing secular philosophers Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau as providing the tenets for the founding of the country [186]\n\n\nCorporate taxes\nIn October 2024, Hawley said that workers should not pay more taxes than corporations He previously supported Trump's proposed corporate tax cuts and announced his reversal on the issue at a campaign event in Cottleville, Missouri [189]\n\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nDuring early negotiations on COVID-19 relief spending, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell proposed a partial rebate for around 70 million households with net incomes below about $50,000 His proposal faced \"swift bipartisan opposition\", including from Hawley, leading the restrictions to be dropped [190]\n\n\nElections\nIn 2023, Hawley introduced the Ending Corporate Influence on Elections Act, a bill that would reverse aspects of Citizens United v FEC, specifically banning publicly traded companies from making independent expenditures, political advertisements for campaigns, and Super PAC contributions Mitch McConnell criticized the bill and warned other Republican senators against signing on, naming a list of senators, including Hawley, who benefited directly from the Senate Leadership Fund [195]\n\n\nEnvironment\nAs Missouri attorney general, Hawley pushed for the deregulation of environmental protections put in place by President Barack Obama, and filed four lawsuits against the Trump administration in an attempt to expedite that process [196] He acknowledged the irony in his maneuver, saying \"it turns out the best way to help President Trump pursue his agenda of rolling back federal overreach is to sue him.\" [196]\n\n\nForeign policy\nSome of his former colleagues at St Paul's School claimed Hawley was \"very hawkish\" in his early 20s, supporting the Iraq War in its early stages and at one point making himself popcorn to eat while watching news coverage of the 2003 invasion [27] While a 25-year-old law student at Yale University, he wrote supportive blog posts of the war in 2005, as well as nation-building in Iraq [199] At the time, he supported a proactive democracy promotion foreign policy [199]\n\n\nAfghanistan\nAfter the 2021 fall of Kabul and the 2021 Kabul airport attack, Hawley was one in \"a wave of other Republicans\" who called on President Biden to resign [208]\n\n\nChina and Hong Kong\nHawley is an outspoken critic of China, which he has called \"the greatest security threat to this country in this century.\" [202] He has said the U.S.'s goal should not be \"to remake China from within\" but rather \"to deny Beijing's ability to impose its will without, whether it be upon Hong Kong, or Taiwan, or our allies and partners, or upon us.\" [202]\n\n\nIsrael\nDuring his 2018 Senate campaign, Hawley's press office sent out an email criticizing Claire McCaskill for supporting the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, writing, \"We should be standing with President Trump and Israel today If you aren't, you are standing with the mullahs and John Kerry Sen McCaskill needs to make it clear that she stands with President Trump and Israel, and not the mullahs.\" [215]\n\n\nAgainst \"cosmopolitan priorities\"\nOn July 16, 2019, at the National Conservatism Conference, organized by Israeli professor Yoram Hazony, Hawley said:\n\n\nMexico\nIn July 2019, Hawley traveled to McAllen, Texas, along the Mexico–United States border, saying, \"the nonstop flow of drugs and human trafficking coming into this country is a crisis, plain and simple I want to learn more about the challenges our agents face, the problems these local communities are dealing with, and how we can figure out a path forward We are facing a surge at the southern border like we have never seen before, and Congress needs to get off its backside and act.\" [222]\n\n\nRussia\nHawley has called the Mueller report a \"hoax\" and the Steele dossier \"lies from a Russian spy\" [225]\n\n\nNATO expansion\nIn January 2022, Hawley called on Biden to drop support of plans for Ukraine to eventually join NATO, on the basis that committing troops to defend Ukraine would undermine the United States' ability to prevent Chinese hegemony in the Indo-Pacific [228]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia\nDuring a debate in the 2018 Senate campaign, Hawley and McCaskill agreed that if it was confirmed that the Saudi government was behind the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, the U.S should respond severely [229]\n\n\nUkraine\nIn October 2019, Hawley called for an independent investigation into Joe Biden related to alleged dealings with Ukraine [231] He defended Donald Trump's phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky and criticized Trump's first impeachment, saying Trump's words were \"certainly not a crime\" [231] During the impeachment trial, Hawley said if additional witnesses were called and new documents considered, he would attempt to force votes on subpoenas for Michael Atkinson, Hunter Biden, Joe Biden, Adam Schiff, the anonymous whistleblower and a reported acquaintance of the whistleblower [232]\n\n\nVenezuela\nOn April 3, 2019, Hawley was part of a group of eight Republicans and seven Democrats to sponsor the Venezuelan Emergency Relief, Democracy Assistance and Development (VERDAD) Act, which was aimed at recognizing Juan Guaidó as the president of Venezuela rather than Nicolás Maduro [235] The bill would provide $200 million in aid for Venezuela, $200 million in aid for neighboring countries accepting Venezuelan refugees, revoke U.S visas from sanctioned Venezuelan officials, and remove sanctions on officials not accused of human rights abuses who recognized Guaidó [235]\n\n\nGun policy\nHawley received a 93% rating from the National Rifle Association (NRA) for 2018 and an 86% rating for 2016 [236] He does not support an assault weapons ban, but does support some gun-control measures, including strengthening background checks, banning bump stocks, and banning mentally ill people from having guns [237] During his Senate campaign, Hawley used National Media as a media consultant, the same firm the NRA employs [238]\n\n\nHate crimes\nHawley was one of six Republican senators to vote against advancing the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which would allow the U.S Justice Department to review hate crimes related to [how?] COVID-19 and establish an online database [239] [240] He was the sole senator to vote against the passage of an amended version of the act that would help investigate anti-Asian hate crimes, saying, \"It's too broad As a former prosecutor, my view is it's dangerous to simply give the federal government open-ended authority to define a whole new class of federal hate crime incidents.\" [241]\n\n\nHealth care\nHawley has criticized the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) As attorney general of Missouri, he joined a lawsuit with 20 other states seeking to have it declared unconstitutional [242] [243] Hawley said the act \"was never constitutional\" [242] and spoke proudly of his involvement in the lawsuit [70] His 2018 Senate campaign said that he supported protections for individuals with preexisting conditions [70] He later published an op-ed in the Springfield News-Leader saying that he supports protecting those with preexisting conditions by creating a taxpayer subsidy to reimburse insurance companies for covering these high cost patients [71]\n\n\nHuman trafficking\nHawley has said that human trafficking is the result of the American sexual revolution in the 1960s due to the social encouragement of premarital sex and the use of contraception After being criticized for these statements, he said that Hollywood culture was a major cause of human trafficking [244] [245] Hawley has said that the appropriate place for sex is \"within marriage\" [246]\n\n\nImmigration\nHawley supports funding the construction of a wall along the southern border to stop illegal immigration [247]\n\n\nIn-vitro fertilization and embryonic stem-cell research\nHawley co-sponsored federal legislation that would have defined human life and personhood as beginning at the moment of fertilization, without exceptions for in-vitro fertilization (IVF) or embryonic stem-cell research [248] [249] In 2013, he said he believed that human life and personhood begin at fertilization, before conception, and that he opposed forms of birth control that prevent conception \"by preventing implantation of a fertilized egg\" [250] After public backlash to the Alabama Supreme Court's ruling that embryos are human persons under state law and that IVF clinics are therefore liable for the loss of embryos as if the embryos were human infants, Hawley announced that he supports legal access to IVF [251] [252] He defended Missouri's state laws, which allow IVF, but which also define an \"embryo\" as an \"unborn child\" [251]\n\n\nLabor\nIn his 2018 Senate campaign, Hawley did not take a firm position on right-to-work legislation that was subject to a referendum by Missouri voters at the time [253] His spokesperson said of right-to-work, which would hamper labor unionizing, that \"nobody should be forced to pay union dues.\" [254] In 2023 and 2024, Hawley pivoted on union issues and joined United Auto Workers at a picket line, saying, \"These guys deserve a raise They've worked hard They all just deserve better, and the company can absolutely afford to pay it.\" [255] Hawley said he does not support workers in public-sector trade unions, saying they have \"held government hostage\" [256]\n\n\nLGBT rights\nIn December 2015, Hawley supported exemptions for Missouri \"businesses and religious groups from participating in same-sex .. marriage ceremonies\" [259]\n\n\nSocial media and Big Tech\nHawley is known for his criticism of Big Tech and social media companies and has often broken with other Republicans in his support for regulation of Internet companies He cosponsored Do Not Track legislation with Democrats Dianne Feinstein and Mark Warner [270] His book The Tyranny of Big Tech was published in May 2021 According to Gilad Edelman of Wired, the book \"raises valid concerns about the technology industry, and he proposes solutions worth taking seriously But he embeds these ideas in a broader argument that is so wildly misleading as to call the entire project into question.\" [271] Edelman writes that Hawley distorts the history of anti-trust in the United States, inaccurately portraying early-20th-century antitrust efforts and completely ignoring conservative opposition to antitrust enforcement since the 1970s [271]\n\n\nTrade and tariffs\nHawley supported Trump's imposition of trade tariffs, [25] saying he hoped the tariffs would be temporary, eventually resulting in lower tariffs on U.S agriculture than before the trade battles [25] In September 2018, he fully supported Trump's trade actions, saying, \"It's a trade war that China started If we're in a war, I want to be winning it.\" [278]\n\n\nDonald Trump\nHawley has been characterized as a Trump loyalist [152] [181] He voted to acquit Trump during his first Senate impeachment trial [281] and accused Democrats of having abused the Constitution by starting the impeachment inquiry, declaring that it was \"the first purely partisan impeachment in our history\" [281] The day after the Republican-held Senate acquitted Trump, Trump praised Hawley as having played a key role in his acquittal [281]\n\n\nU.S. Supreme Court nominations\nHawley's first commercial in the 2018 Senate campaign focused on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the U.S Supreme Court, which he supported [286] After Kavanaugh was accused of sexual assault, Hawley staunchly defended him and said that Democrats had staged an \"ambush\" [286]\n\n\nSupreme Court shortlist\nOn September 9, 2020, Trump announced that Hawley, Ted Cruz and Tom Cotton were on his shortlist for nominations to the Supreme Court should a vacancy occur Hawley expressed his appreciation but declined the offer, saying, \"Missourians elected me to fight for them in the Senate\" [296] After Ruth Bader Ginsburg died on September 18, Trump instead nominated Amy Coney Barrett on September 29 [297]\n\n\nCaucus memberships\nIn 2010, Hawley married Erin Morrow (now known as Erin Morrow Hawley), a fellow Yale Law School graduate and an associate professor of law at the Regent University School of Law [299] [300] They have three children [301] Following complaints that, after becoming attorney general, he was not abiding by a statutory requirement that the attorney general must reside within the city limits of the state capital (Jefferson City), Hawley began renting an apartment there, while his family continued to live in Columbia, Missouri [302] The Hawleys own a house in Vienna, Virginia, which they bought in 2019 after Hawley was elected to the U.S Senate, after selling their Columbia home [134] [303] Hawley's voter registration has his sister's address in Ozark, Missouri, so that he can be eligible to run again for Missouri's U.S Senate seat [304]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn 2010, Hawley married Erin Morrow (now known as Erin Morrow Hawley), a fellow Yale Law School

future wife, Erin Morrow, now known as Erin Hawley, a fellow Yale Law graduate who was also clerking for Roberts [25] [29] [30]\n\n\n2016 Missouri attorney general campaign\nHawley launched his campaign for attorney general of Missouri on July 23, 2015 [35] Of the $9.2 million raised for the campaign, $4.4 million was provided by David Humphreys, CEO of Joplin-based Tamko Building Products [36] On August 2, 2016, Hawley defeated Kurt Schaefer in the Republican primary with 64% of the vote [37] He defeated Democrat Teresa Hensley in the general election with 58.5% of the vote [37] During the campaign, Hawley criticized \"career politicians\" who were \"climbing the ladder\" from one position to another, which later became a point of bipartisan criticism of him when he ran for the U.S Senate two years later [38]\n\n\nAttorney general of Missouri (2017–2019)\nHawley was sworn in as attorney general on January 9, 2017, by Missouri Supreme Court chief justice Patricia Breckenridge [39] [40]\n\n\nDeath of Tory Sanders\nOn May 5, 2017, Tory Sanders, a Black motorist who had taken a wrong turn in Tennessee ran out of gas in rural Mississippi County, Missouri He had gotten lost and was confused and asked a gas station attendant to call the police for assistance Deputies responded and put him in the county jail His mental condition had deteriorated further and he resisted when jail staff, under the command of Sheriff Cory Hutcheson, tried to release him as they had no grounds on which to hold him Hutcheson, who himself faced and later was convicted of a variety of federal and state charges, led a team of police and jailers who repeatedly pepper-sprayed and tasered Sanders throughout the day Hutcheson eventually led a team of cops and jailers into the cell and swarmed Sanders, who went into cardiac arrest and died The cause of death was judged to be \"excited delirium\", a condition frequently cited in custody-related deaths but not recognized by major psychiatric authorities [41] [42]\n\n\nOpioid manufacturer lawsuit and investigation\nIn June 2017, Hawley announced that Missouri had filed suit in state court against three major drug companies, Endo Health Solutions, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, and Purdue Pharma, for allegedly hiding the danger of prescription painkillers and contributing to the opioid epidemic The state argued that the companies violated Missouri consumer protection and Medicaid laws [45] [46] The damages sought were among the largest in state history, on the order of hundreds of millions of dollars [45]\n\n\nRape kit audit\nOn October 29, 2017, the Columbia Missourian published an exposé describing a large backlog of untested rape kits in Missouri and the long-ignored efforts of rape survivors and law enforcement agencies to have the state address the backlog [49] On November 29, Hawley announced a statewide audit of the number of untested rape kits [50] The results were made public in May 2018; there were 5,000 such kits [50] In August 2018, One Nation, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit connected to Republican campaign strategist Karl Rove, ran commercials giving Hawley credit for identifying the problem, a claim The St Louis Post-Dispatch labeled misleading [49] In September 2020, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt announced that of the 16 rape kit tests that were consequently uploaded to the national DNA database, 11 revealed the names of known criminals, and were referred for possible prosecution [51]\n\n\nInvestigations into tech companies\nIn November 2017, Hawley opened an investigation into whether Google's business practices violated state consumer protection and anti-trust laws The investigation was focused on what data Google collects from users of its services, how it uses content providers' content, and whether its search engine results are biased [52] [53]\n\n\nGreitens scandals\nIn December 2017, The Kansas City Star reported that Missouri's Republican Governor Eric Greitens and senior members of his staff used Confide, a messaging app that erases texts after they have been read, on their personal phones They were accused by government transparency advocates of subverting Missouri's open records laws [55] Hawley initially declined to prosecute, citing a Missouri Supreme Court ruling that the attorney general cannot simultaneously represent a state officer and take legal action against that officer, but on December 20, 2017, he announced his office would investigate after all, saying that his clients are \"first and foremost the citizens of the state\" [56] [57] [58] Hawley said text messages between government employees, whether made on private or government-issued phones, should be treated the same as emails: a determination must be made as to whether the text is a public record, and if so, whether it is subject to disclosure [56] His investigation found that no laws had been broken [59] In March 2018, six former Missouri attorneys released a letter calling the investigation \"half-hearted\" Hawley's spokesperson called the letter a partisan attack [59]\n\n\nAffordable Care Act lawsuit\nIn February 2018, Hawley joined 20 other Republican-led states in a lawsuit challenging the Affordable Care Act as unconstitutional [69] Though some argued the lawsuit would eliminate insurance protections for people with preexisting conditions, Hawley said he supported protections for preexisting conditions [70] In September 2018, amid criticism from Hawley's U.S Senate opponent Claire McCaskill about the lawsuit's impact on preexisting conditions, Hawley's office said that he supported protections for individuals with preexisting conditions [70] Hawley later published an op-ed in the Springfield News-Leader explaining that he supported protecting those with preexisting conditions by creating a taxpayer subsidy to reimburse insurance companies for covering these high-cost patients [71] In December 2018, Judge Reed O'Connor ruled the entirety of the ACA unconstitutional, but on appeal, the Fifth Circuit did not agree that the entire law should be voided [72] [73] [74]\n\n\nSentencing of Bobby Bostic\nIn March 2018, Hawley defended the 1995 sentencing of Bobby Bostic, a Missouri man who had committed robbery and other crimes at the age of 16, to 241 years in prison Bostic and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had attempted to appeal his sentence to the Supreme Court, saying it violated the court's ruling in Graham v Florida, which held that juveniles could not be sentenced to life imprisonment for charges lesser than homicide [75] In a Supreme Court filing, Hawley argued that Bostic's sentencing did not violate the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment, and that Graham v Florida only applied to a sentence for one crime [76] The judge who sentenced Bostic said she had come to believe the sentence was too harsh, and asked to join an amicus brief filed by 26 former judges, prosecutors and law enforcement officials [75] [76] On April 24, the Supreme Court rejected Bostic's appeal [75]\n\n\nState staff used for campaign and Sunshine Law violations\nOn November 14, 2022, Cole County Circuit Court Judge Jon Beetem ruled that Hawley violated Missouri's open records law during his 2018 U.S Senate campaign by withholding emails between his out-of-state political consultants and his taxpayer-funded staff Beetem granted summary judgment, ruled Hawley's office had \"knowingly and purposefully\" violated Missouri's Sunshine Law, and fined the AG's office $12,000 When Hawley was AG, his staff used private email instead of government accounts to communicate with his political consultants Those consultants illegally gave direct guidance and tasks to Hawley's staff and led meetings during office hours in the Missouri Supreme Court building [77] Beetem wrote, \"There is no genuine dispute that the AGO knew the Sunshine Law required it to produce responsive documents in its possession when it received DSCC's two Sunshine Law requests, but made the conscious decision not to do so.\" [77]\n\n\nCatholic clergy investigation\nIn August 2018, after a Pennsylvania grand jury released a report detailing over 1,000 cases of sexual abuse by Catholic clerics, as well as protests by survivors of clergy sexual abuse in St Louis, Hawley announced that he would begin an investigation into potential cases of abuse in Missouri [79] Missouri was one of several states to launch such investigations in the wake of the Pennsylvania report; the attorneys general of Illinois, Nebraska, and New Mexico began similar inquiries [80] Hawley promised that he would investigate any crimes, publish a report for the public, and refer potential cases to local law enforcement officials Archbishop of St Louis Robert James Carlson pledged cooperation with the inquiry [79] [81]\n\n\nU.S. Senate\nIn August 2017, Hawley formed an exploratory campaign committee for the U.S Senate [83] [84] In October 2017, he declared his candidacy for the Republican nomination in Missouri's 2018 U.S Senate election for the seat held by Democrat Claire McCaskill [85] [86] Before

U.S Senate [83] [84] In October 2017, he declared his candidacy for the Republican nomination in Missouri's 2018 U.S Senate election for the seat held by Democrat Claire McCaskill [85] [86] Before the official announcement, four former Republican U.S senators from Missouri (John Ashcroft, Kit Bond, John Danforth, and McCaskill's predecessor, Jim Talent) asked Hawley to run for the Senate seat [87]\n\n\n2024\nHawley is seeking a second Senate term [100] He faces Democratic nominee Lucas Kunce, a U.S Marine veteran [101] Hawley and Kunce had a heated debate about debates in front of press at the Governor's Ham Breakfast, in which both expressed their intentions to debate Hawley pushed for a forum hosted by Missouri Farm Bureau; Kunce pressed for broadcast debates and suggested that the Missouri Farm Bureau's endorsement of Hawley presented legal complications [102]\n\n\nTenure\nHawley was sworn in as a U.S senator on January 3, 2019 [107]\n\n\nAttempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results\nAfter Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election, Hawley announced his intention to object to the Senate's certification of the Electoral College vote count on January 6, 2021 [3] He was the first senator to do so [4] Trump had refused to concede and made frequent baseless claims of fraud in the election Hawley said that his attempt to reverse the election result was on behalf of those \"concerned about election integrity.\" [3] [126] He made numerous statements suggesting that Trump could possibly remain in office [10] The New York Times wrote that Hawley was elevating false claims that President-elect Joe Biden stole the election [3] His maneuver prompted bipartisan condemnation of his action as undemocratic [127] [128]\n\n\nActivity around storming of the U.S. Capitol and public reaction\nOn January 6, 2021, when Congress met to count the electoral votes for the 2020 presidential election, they were interrupted by pro-Trump rioters who stormed the U.S Capitol building, forcing members of Congress to evacuate Before the counting of the votes, to which Hawley had publicly announced he would object, he was photographed saluting the protestors with a raised fist outside the Capitol before the riot [136] [137] The photograph immediately became a subject of controversy; The Kansas City Star called it \"the image that will haunt Josh Hawley\" and \"one of the iconic images to emerge from the day the Capitol was breached by rioters\" [135] and Pulitzer Prize-winning St Louis Post-Dispatch columnist Tony Messenger said \"the staging was perfect\" and recommended the photograph be known as Hawley: The Face of Sedition [138] Tom Coleman, a former U.S representative from Missouri and a fellow Republican, said Hawley's \"clenched fist in front of the Capitol will seal his fate.\" [135] The photographer, Francis Chung, declined to weigh in on the photograph's political impact, saying it \"is what it is\" and \"kind of speaks for itself.\" [135] Later that day, video showed Hawley running through the Capitol, fleeing the rioters [139]\n\n\nCommittee assignments\nFor the 117th United States Congress, Hawley was named to four Senate committees [177] They are:\n\n\nPolitical positions\nHawley's political views have been described as nationalist [179] and populist [180] He has been called a Trump loyalist [152] [181]\n\n\nAbortion\nHawley opposes abortion and has called for the appointment of \"constitutionalist, pro-life judges\" to the U.S Supreme Court and other federal courts [182] He has called Roe v Wade \"one of the most unjust decisions\" in American judicial history Missouri's Right to Life PAC endorsed Hawley for Senate [182] In July 2020, Hawley wrote that to earn his support, a Supreme Court nominee must have publicly, on the record, before nomination, asserted that Roe v Wade was incorrectly decided [183] Later that year he voted to confirm Amy Coney Barrett, who had strongly criticized Roe v Wade without explicitly saying it was wrongly decided and declined to do so during hearings Hawley said the nominee was \"the most openly pro-life judicial nominee to the Supreme Court in my lifetime.\" [184] [185]\n\n\nChristian nationalism\nHawley has advocated Christian nationalism, writing: \"Some will say now that I am calling America a Christian nation So I am .. And some will say that I am advocating Christian nationalism And so I do.\" Hawley asserts that the U.S was \"founded by Christian believers and that our fundamental ideals, including those in the Constitution, Declaration of Independence, and Bill of Rights all come to us from a Christian tradition.\" [186] [187] Political scientist Tim Lewis says this is inaccurate, citing secular philosophers Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau as providing the tenets for the founding of the country [186]\n\n\nCorporate taxes\nIn October 2024, Hawley said that workers should not pay more taxes than corporations He previously supported Trump's proposed corporate tax cuts and announced his reversal on the issue at a campaign event in Cottleville, Missouri [189]\n\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nDuring early negotiations on COVID-19 relief spending, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell proposed a partial rebate for around 70 million households with net incomes below about $50,000 His proposal faced \"swift bipartisan opposition\", including from Hawley, leading the restrictions to be dropped [190]\n\n\nElections\nIn 2023, Hawley introduced the Ending Corporate Influence on Elections Act, a bill that would reverse aspects of Citizens United v FEC, specifically banning publicly traded companies from making independent expenditures, political advertisements for campaigns, and Super PAC contributions Mitch McConnell criticized the bill and warned other Republican senators against signing on, naming a list of senators, including Hawley, who benefited directly from the Senate Leadership Fund [195]\n\n\nEnvironment\nAs Missouri attorney general, Hawley pushed for the deregulation of environmental protections put in place by President Barack Obama, and filed four lawsuits against the Trump administration in an attempt to expedite that process [196] He acknowledged the irony in his maneuver, saying \"it turns out the best way to help President Trump pursue his agenda of rolling back federal overreach is to sue him.\" [196]\n\n\nForeign policy\nSome of his former colleagues at St Paul's School claimed Hawley was \"very hawkish\" in his early 20s, supporting the Iraq War in its early stages and at one point making himself popcorn to eat while watching news coverage of the 2003 invasion [27] While a 25-year-old law student at Yale University, he wrote supportive blog posts of the war in 2005, as well as nation-building in Iraq [199] At the time, he supported a proactive democracy promotion foreign policy [199]\n\n\nAfghanistan\nAfter the 2021 fall of Kabul and the 2021 Kabul airport attack, Hawley was one in \"a wave of other Republicans\" who called on President Biden to resign [208]\n\n\nChina and Hong Kong\nHawley is an outspoken critic of China, which he has called \"the greatest security threat to this country in this century.\" [202] He has said the U.S.'s goal should not be \"to remake China from within\" but rather \"to deny Beijing's ability to impose its will without, whether it be upon Hong Kong, or Taiwan, or our allies and partners, or upon us.\" [202]\n\n\nIsrael\nDuring his 2018 Senate campaign, Hawley's press office sent out an email criticizing Claire McCaskill for supporting the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, writing, \"We should be standing with President Trump and Israel today If you aren't, you are standing with the mullahs and John Kerry Sen McCaskill needs to make it clear that she stands with President Trump and Israel, and not the mullahs.\" [215]\n\n\nAgainst \"cosmopolitan priorities\"\nOn July 16, 2019, at the National Conservatism Conference, organized by Israeli professor Yoram Hazony, Hawley said:\n\n\nMexico\nIn July 2019, Hawley traveled to McAllen, Texas, along the Mexico–United States border, saying, \"the nonstop flow of drugs and human trafficking coming into this country is a crisis, plain and simple I want to learn more about the challenges our agents face, the problems these local communities are dealing with, and how we can figure out a path forward We are facing a surge at the southern border like we have never seen before, and Congress needs to get off its backside and act.\" [222]\n\n\nRussia\nHawley has called the Mueller report a \"hoax\" and the Steele dossier \"lies from a Russian spy\" [225]\n\n\nNATO expansion\nIn January 2022, Hawley called on Biden to drop support of plans for Ukraine to eventually join NATO, on the basis that committing troops to defend Ukraine would undermine the United States' ability to prevent Chinese hegemony in the Indo-Pacific [228]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia\nDuring a debate in the 2018 Senate campaign, Hawley and McCaskill agreed that if it was confirmed that the Saudi government was behind the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, the U.S should respond severely [229]\n\n\nUkraine\nIn October 2019, Hawley called for an independent investigation into Joe Biden related to alleged dealings with Ukraine [231] He defended Donald Trump's phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky and criticized Trump's first impeachment, saying Trump's words were \"certainly not a crime\" [231] During the impeachment trial, Hawley said if additional witnesses were called and new documents considered, he would attempt to force votes on subpoenas for Michael Atkinson, Hunter Biden, Joe Biden, Adam Schiff, the anonymous whistleblower and a reported acquaintance of the whistleblower [232]\n\n\nVenezuela\nOn April 3, 2019, Hawley was part of a group of eight Republicans and seven Democrats to sponsor the Venezuelan Emergency Relief, Democracy Assistance and Development (VERDAD) Act, which was aimed at recognizing Juan Guaidó as the president of Venezuela rather than Nicolás Maduro [235] The bill would provide $200 million in aid for Venezuela, $200 million in aid for neighboring countries accepting Venezuelan refugees, revoke U.S visas from sanctioned Venezuelan officials, and remove sanctions on officials not accused of human rights abuses who recognized Guaidó [235]\n\n\nGun policy\nHawley received a 93% rating from the National Rifle Association (NRA) for 2018 and an 86% rating for 2016 [236] He does not support an assault weapons ban, but does support some gun-control measures, including strengthening background checks, banning bump stocks, and banning mentally ill people from having guns [237] During his Senate campaign, Hawley used National Media as a media consultant, the same firm the NRA employs [238]\n\n\nHate crimes\nHawley was one of six Republican senators to vote against advancing the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which would allow the U.S Justice Department to review hate crimes related to [how?] COVID-19 and establish an online database [239] [240] He was the sole senator to vote against the passage of an amended version of the act that would help investigate anti-Asian hate crimes, saying, \"It's too broad As a former prosecutor, my view is it's dangerous to simply give the federal government open-ended authority to define a whole new class of federal hate crime incidents.\" [241]\n\n\nHealth care\nHawley has criticized the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) As attorney general of Missouri, he joined a lawsuit with 20 other states seeking to have it declared unconstitutional [242] [243] Hawley said the act \"was never constitutional\" [242] and spoke proudly of his involvement in the lawsuit [70] His 2018 Senate campaign said that he supported protections for individuals with preexisting conditions [70] He later published an op-ed in the Springfield News-Leader saying that he supports protecting those with preexisting conditions by creating a taxpayer subsidy to reimburse insurance companies for covering these high cost patients [71]\n\n\nHuman trafficking\nHawley has said that human trafficking is the result of the American sexual revolution in the 1960s due to the social encouragement of premarital sex and the use of contraception After being criticized for these statements, he said that Hollywood culture was a major cause of human trafficking [244] [245] Hawley has said that the appropriate place for sex is \"within marriage\" [246]\n\n\nImmigration\nHawley supports funding the construction of a wall along the southern border to stop illegal immigration [247]\n\n\nIn-vitro fertilization and embryonic stem-cell research\nHawley co-sponsored federal legislation that would have defined human life and personhood as beginning at the moment of fertilization, without exceptions for in-vitro fertilization (IVF) or embryonic stem-cell research [248] [249] In 2013, he said he believed that human life and personhood begin at fertilization, before conception, and that he opposed forms of birth control that prevent conception \"by preventing implantation of a fertilized egg\" [250] After public backlash to the Alabama Supreme Court's ruling that embryos are human persons under state law and that IVF clinics are therefore liable for the loss of embryos as if the embryos were human infants, Hawley announced that he supports legal access to IVF [251] [252] He defended Missouri's state laws, which allow IVF, but which also define an \"embryo\" as an \"unborn child\" [251]\n\n\nLabor\nIn his 2018 Senate campaign, Hawley did not take a firm position on right-to-work legislation that was subject to a referendum by Missouri voters at the time [253] His spokesperson said of right-to-work, which would hamper labor unionizing, that \"nobody should be forced to pay union dues.\" [254] In 2023 and 2024, Hawley pivoted on union issues and joined United Auto Workers at a picket line, saying, \"These guys deserve a raise They've worked hard They all just deserve better, and the company can absolutely afford to pay it.\" [255] Hawley said he does not support workers in public-sector trade unions, saying they have \"held government hostage\" [256]\n\n\nLGBT rights\nIn December 2015, Hawley supported exemptions for Missouri \"businesses and religious groups from participating in same-sex .. marriage ceremonies\" [259]\n\n\nSocial media and Big Tech\nHawley is known for his criticism of Big Tech and social media companies and has often broken with other Republicans in his support for regulation of Internet companies He cosponsored Do Not Track legislation with Democrats Dianne Feinstein and Mark Warner [270] His book The Tyranny of Big Tech was published in May 2021 According to Gilad Edelman of Wired, the book \"raises valid concerns about the technology industry, and he proposes solutions worth taking seriously But he embeds these ideas in a broader argument that is so wildly misleading as to call the entire project into question.\" [271] Edelman writes that Hawley distorts the history of anti-trust in the United States, inaccurately portraying early-20th-century antitrust efforts and completely ignoring conservative opposition to antitrust enforcement since the 1970s [271]\n\n\nTrade and tariffs\nHawley supported Trump's imposition of trade tariffs, [25] saying he hoped the tariffs would be temporary, eventually resulting in lower tariffs on U.S agriculture than before the trade battles [25] In September 2018, he fully supported Trump's trade actions, saying, \"It's a trade war that China started If we're in a war, I want to be winning it.\" [278]\n\n\nDonald Trump\nHawley has been characterized as a Trump loyalist [152] [181] He voted to acquit Trump during his first Senate impeachment trial [281] and accused Democrats of having abused the Constitution by starting the impeachment inquiry, declaring that it was \"the first purely partisan impeachment in our history\" [281] The day after the Republican-held Senate acquitted Trump, Trump praised Hawley as having played a key role in his acquittal [281]\n\n\nU.S. Supreme Court nominations\nHawley's first commercial in the 2018 Senate campaign focused on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the U.S Supreme Court, which he supported [286] After Kavanaugh was accused of sexual assault, Hawley staunchly defended him and said that Democrats had staged an \"ambush\" [286]\n\n\nSupreme Court shortlist\nOn September 9, 2020, Trump announced that Hawley, Ted Cruz and Tom Cotton were on his shortlist for nominations to the Supreme Court should a vacancy occur Hawley expressed his appreciation but declined the offer, saying, \"Missourians elected me to fight for them in the Senate\" [296] After Ruth Bader Ginsburg died on September 18, Trump instead nominated Amy Coney Barrett on September 29 [297]\n\n\nCaucus memberships\nIn 2010, Hawley married Erin Morrow (now known as Erin Morrow Hawley), a fellow Yale Law School graduate and an associate professor of law at the Regent University School of Law [299] [300] They have three children [301] Following complaints that, after becoming attorney general, he was not abiding by a statutory requirement that the attorney general must reside within the city limits of the state capital (Jefferson City), Hawley began renting an apartment there, while his family continued to live in Columbia, Missouri [302] The Hawleys own a house in Vienna, Virginia, which they bought in 2019 after Hawley was elected to the U.S Senate, after selling their Columbia home [134] [303] Hawley's voter registration has his sister's address in Ozark, Missouri, so that he can be eligible to run again for Missouri's U.S Senate seat [304]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn 2010, Hawley married Erin Morrow (now known as Erin Morrow Hawley), a fellow Yale Law School

{"title": "Japan", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe name for Japan in Japanese is written using the kanji 日本 and is pronounced Nihon or Nippon [11] Before 日本 was adopted in the early 8th century, the country was known in China as Wa (倭, changed in Japan around 757 to 和) and in Japan by the endonym Yamato [12] Nippon, the original Sino-Japanese reading of the characters, is favored for official uses, including on Japanese banknotes and postage stamps [11] Nihon is typically used in everyday speech and reflects shifts in Japanese phonology during the Edo period [12] The characters 日本 mean \"sun origin\", [11] which is the source of the popular Western epithet \"Land of the Rising Sun\" [13]\n\n\nHistory\nModern humans arrived in Japan around 38,000 years ago (~36,000 BC), marking the beginning of the Japanese Paleolithic [18] This was followed from around 14,500 BC (the start of the Jōmon period) by a Mesolithic to Neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture [19] Clay vessels from the period are among the oldest surviving examples of pottery [20] The Japonic-speaking Yayoi people entered the archipelago from the Korean Peninsula, [21] [22] [23] intermingling with the Jōmon; [23] the Yayoi period saw the introduction of practices including wet-rice farming, [24] a new style of pottery, [25] and metallurgy from China and Korea [26] According to legend, Emperor Jimmu (descendant of Amaterasu) founded a kingdom in central Japan in 660 BC, beginning a continuous imperial line [27]\n\n\nPrehistoric to classical history\nModern humans arrived in Japan around 38,000 years ago (~36,000 BC), marking the beginning of the Japanese Paleolithic [18] This was followed from around 14,500 BC (the start of the Jōmon period) by a Mesolithic to Neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture [19] Clay vessels from the period are among the oldest surviving

central Japan in 660 BC, beginning a continuous imperial line [27]\n\n\nFeudal era\nJapan's feudal era was characterized by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class of warriors, the samurai [37] In 1185, following the defeat of the Taira clan by the Minamoto clan in the Genpei War, samurai Minamoto no Yoritomo established a military government at Kamakura [38] After Yoritomo's death, the Hōjō clan came to power as regents for the shōgun [34] The Zen school of Buddhism was introduced from China in the Kamakura period (1185–1333) and became popular among the samurai class [39] The Kamakura shogunate repelled Mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281 but was eventually overthrown by Emperor Go-Daigo [34] Go-Daigo was defeated by Ashikaga Takauji in 1336, beginning the Muromachi period (1336–1573) [40] The succeeding Ashikaga shogunate failed to control the feudal warlords (daimyō) and a civil war began in 1467, opening the century-long Sengoku period (\"Warring States\") [41]\n\n\nModern era\nThe United States Navy sent Commodore Matthew C Perry to force the opening of Japan to the outside world Arriving at Uraga with four \"Black Ships\" in July 1853, the Perry Expedition resulted in the March 1854 Convention of Kanagawa [46] Subsequent similar treaties with other Western countries brought economic and political crises [46] The resignation of the shōgun led to the Boshin War and the establishment of a centralized state nominally unified under the emperor (the Meiji Restoration) [51] Adopting Western political, judicial, and military institutions, the Cabinet organized the Privy Council, introduced the Meiji Constitution (November 29, 1890), and assembled the Imperial Diet [52] During the Meiji period (1868–1912), the Empire of Japan emerged as the most developed state in Asia and as an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence [53] [54] [55] After victories in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905), Japan gained control of Taiwan, Korea and the southern half of Sakhalin, [56] [52] and annexed Korea in 1910 [57] The Japanese population doubled from 35 million in 1873 to 70 million by 1935, with a significant shift to urbanization [58] [59]\n\n\nGeography\nJapan comprises 14,125 islands extending along the Pacific coast of Asia [78] It stretches over 3000 km (1900 mi) northeast–southwest from the Sea of Okhotsk to the East China Sea [79] [80] The country's five main islands, from north to south, are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu and Okinawa [81] The Ryukyu Islands, which include Okinawa, are a chain to the south of Kyushu The Nanpō Islands are south and east of the main islands of Japan Together they are often known as the Japanese archipelago [82] As of 2019 [update], Japan's territory is 377,975.24 km2 (145,937.06 sq mi) [4] Japan has the sixth-longest coastline in the world at 29,751 km (18,486 mi) Because of its far-flung outlying islands, Japan's exclusive economic zone is the eighth-largest in the world, covering 4,470,000 km2 (1,730,000 sq mi) [83] [84]\n\n\nClimate\nThe climate of Japan is predominantly temperate but varies greatly from north to south The northernmost region, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter [97]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nJapan has nine forest ecoregions which reflect the climate and geography of the islands They range from subtropical moist broadleaf forests in the Ryūkyū and Bonin Islands, to temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the mild climate regions of the main islands, to temperate coniferous forests in the cold, winter portions of the northern islands [103] Japan has over 90,000 species of wildlife as of 2019 [update], [104] including the brown bear, the Japanese macaque, the Japanese raccoon dog, the small Japanese field mouse, and the Japanese giant salamander [105] There are 53 Ramsar wetland sites in Japan [106] Five sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List for their outstanding natural value [107]\n\n\nEnvironment\nIn the period of rapid economic growth after World War II, environmental policies were downplayed by the government and industrial corporations; as a result, environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s Responding to rising concerns, the government introduced environmental protection laws in 1970 [108] The oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of Japan's lack of natural resources [109]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nJapan is a unitary state and constitutional monarchy in which the power of the Emperor is limited to a ceremonial role [114] Executive power is instead wielded by the Prime Minister of Japan and his Cabinet, whose sovereignty is vested in the Japanese people [115] Naruhito is the Emperor of Japan, having succeeded his father Akihito upon his accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne in 2019 [114]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nJapan is divided into 47 prefectures, each overseen by an elected governor and legislature [114] In the following table, the prefectures are grouped by region: [124]\n\n\nForeign relations\nA member state of the United Nations since 1956, Japan is one of the G4 countries seeking reform of the Security Council [125] Japan is a member of the G7, APEC, and \"ASEAN Plus Three\", and is a participant in the East Asia Summit [126] It is the world's fifth-largest donor of official development assistance, donating US$9.2 billion in 2014 [127] In 2024, Japan had the fourth-largest diplomatic network in the world [128]\n\n\nMilitary\nJapan is the third highest-ranked Asian country in the 2024 Global Peace Index [137] It spent 1.1% of its total GDP on its defence budget in 2022, [138] and maintained the tenth-largest military budget in the world in 2022 [139] The country's military (the Japan Self-Defense Forces) is restricted by Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which renounces Japan's right to declare war or use military force in international disputes [140] The military is governed by the Ministry of Defense, and primarily consists of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force The deployment of troops to Iraq and Afghanistan marked the first overseas use of Japan's military since World War II [141]\n\n\nLaw enforcement\nDomestic security in Japan is provided mainly by the prefectural police departments, under the oversight of the National Police Agency [147] As the central coordinating body for the Prefectural Police Departments, the National Police Agency is administered by the National Public Safety Commission [148] The Special Assault Team comprises national-level counter-terrorism tactical units that cooperate with territorial-level Anti-Firearms Squads and Counter-NBC Terrorism Squads [149] The Japan Coast Guard guards territorial waters surrounding Japan and uses surveillance and control countermeasures against smuggling, marine environmental crime, poaching, piracy, spy ships, unauthorized foreign fishing vessels, and illegal immigration [150]\n\n\nHuman rights\nJapanese society traditionally places a strong emphasis on collective harmony and conformity, which has led to the suppression of individual rights [157] Japan's constitution prohibits racial and religious discrimination, [158] [159] and the country is a signatory to numerous international human rights treaties [160] However, it lacks any laws against discrimination based on race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or gender identity and does not have a national human rights institution [161]\n\n\nEconomy\nJapan has the world's fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP, after that of the United States, China and Germany; and the fourth-largest economy by PPP-adjusted GDP [169] As of 2021 [update], Japan's labor force is the world's eighth-largest, consisting of over 68.6 million workers [83] As of 2022 [update], Japan has a low unemployment rate of around 2.6% [170] Its poverty rate is the second highest among the G7 countries, [171] and exceeds 15.7% of the population [172] Japan has the highest ratio of public debt to GDP among advanced economies, [173] with a national debt estimated at 248% relative to GDP as of 2022 [update] [174] The Japanese yen is the world's third-largest reserve currency after the US dollar and the euro [175]\n\n\nAgriculture and fishery\nThe Japanese agricultural sector accounts for about 1.2% of the country's total GDP as of 2018 [update] [116] Only 11.5% of Japan's land is suitable for cultivation [187] Because of this lack of arable land, a system of terraces is used to farm in small areas [188] This results in one of the world's highest levels of crop yields per unit area, with an agricultural self-sufficiency rate of about 50% as of 2018 [update] [189] Japan's small agricultural sector is highly subsidized and protected [190] There has been a growing concern about farming as farmers are aging with a difficult time finding successors [191]\n\n\nIndustry and services\nJapan has a large industrial capacity and is home to some of the \"largest and most technologically advanced producers of motor vehicles, machine tools, steel and nonferrous metals, ships, chemical substances, textiles, and processed foods\" [83] Japan's industrial sector makes up approximately 27.5% of its GDP [83] The country's manufacturing output is the fourth highest in the world as of 2023 [update] [196]\n\n\nScience and technology\nRelative to gross domestic product, Japan's research and development budget is the second highest in the world, [203] with 867,000 researchers sharing a 19-trillion-yen research and development budget as of 2017 [update] [204] The country has produced twenty-two Nobel laureates in either physics, chemistry or medicine, [205] and three Fields medalists [206]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nJapan has invested heavily in transportation infrastructure since the 1990s [220] The country has approximately 1,200,000 kilometers (750,000 miles) of roads made up of 1,000,000 kilometers (620,000 miles) of city, town and village roads, 130,000 kilometers (81,000 miles) of prefectural roads, 54,736 kilometers (34,011 miles) of general national highways and 7641 kilometers (4748 miles) of national expressways as of 2017 [update] [221]\n\n\nTransportation\nJapan has invested heavily in transportation infrastructure since the 1990s [220] The country has approximately 1,200,000 kilometers (750,000 miles) of roads made up of 1,000,000 kilometers (620,000 miles) of city, town and village roads, 130,000 kilometers (81,000 miles) of prefectural roads, 54,736 kilometers (34,011 miles) of general national highways and 7641 kilometers (4748 miles) of national expressways as of 2017 [update] [221]\n\n\nEnergy\nAs of 2019 [update], 37.1% of energy in Japan was produced from petroleum, 25.1% from coal, 22.4% from natural gas, 3.5% from hydropower and 2.8% from nuclear power, among other sources Nuclear power was down from 11.2 percent in 2010 [226] By May 2012 all of the country's nuclear power plants had been taken offline because of ongoing public opposition following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011, though government officials continued to try to sway public opinion in favor of returning at least some to service [227] The Sendai Nuclear Power Plant restarted in 2015, [228] and since then several other nuclear power plants have been restarted [229] Japan lacks significant domestic reserves and has a heavy dependence on imported energy [230] The country has therefore aimed to diversify its sources and maintain high levels of energy efficiency [231]\n\n\nDemographics\nJapan has a population of almost 125 million, of whom nearly 122 million are Japanese nationals (2022 estimates) [232] A small population of foreign residents makes up the remainder [233] \nJapan is the world's fastest aging country and has the highest proportion of elderly citizens of any country, comprising one-third of its total population; [234] this is the result of a post–World War II baby boom, which was followed by an increase in life expectancy and a decrease in birth rates [235] Japan has a total fertility rate of 1.4, which is below the replacement rate of 2.1, and is among the world's lowest; [236] it has a median age of 48.4, the highest in the world [237] As of 2020 [update], over 28.7 percent of the population is over 65, or more than one in four out of the Japanese population [234] As a growing number of younger Japanese are not marrying or remaining childless, [238] [239] Japan's population is expected to drop to around 88 million by 2065 [234]\n\n\nLanguages\nThe Japanese language is Japan's de facto national language and the primary written and spoken language of most people in the country [255] Japanese writing uses kanji (Chinese characters) and two sets of kana (syllabaries based on cursive script and radicals used by kanji), as well as the Latin alphabet and Arabic numerals [256] English has taken a major role in Japan as a business and international link language, and is a compulsory subject at the junior and senior high school levels [257] Japanese Sign Language is the primary sign language used in Japan and has gained some official recognition, but its usage has been historically hindered by discriminatory policies and a lack of educational support [255]\n\n\nReligion\nJapan's constitution guarantees full religious freedom [262] Upper estimates suggest that 84–96 percent of the Japanese population subscribe to Shinto as its indigenous religion [263] However, these estimates are based on people affiliated with a temple, rather than the number of true believers Many Japanese people practice both Shinto and Buddhism; they can identify with both religions or describe themselves as non-religious or spiritual [264] The level of participation in religious ceremonies as a cultural tradition remains high, especially during festivals and occasions such as the first shrine visit of the New Year [265] Taoism and Confucianism from China have also influenced Japanese beliefs and customs [30]\n\n\nEducation\nSince the 1947 Fundamental Law of Education, compulsory education in Japan comprises elementary and junior high school, which together last for nine years [272] Almost all children continue their education at a three-year senior high school [273] The top-ranking university in the country is the University of Tokyo [274] Starting in April 2016, various schools began the academic year with elementary school and junior high school integrated into one nine-year compulsory schooling program; MEXT plans for this approach to be adopted nationwide [275]\n\n\nHealth\nHealth care in Japan is provided by national and local governments Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance program administered by local governments [282] Since 1973, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance [283]\n\n\nCulture\nContemporary Japanese culture combines influences from Asia, Europe, and North America [293] Traditional Japanese arts include crafts such as ceramics, textiles, lacquerware, swords and dolls; performances of bunraku, kabuki, noh, dance, and rakugo; and other practices, the tea ceremony, ikebana, martial arts, calligraphy, origami, onsen, Geisha and games Japan has a developed system for the protection and promotion of both tangible and intangible Cultural Properties and National Treasures [294] Twenty-two sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, eighteen of which are of cultural significance [295] Japan is considered a cultural superpower [296] [297] [298] [299]\n\n\nArt and architecture\nThe history of Japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native Japanese esthetics and imported ideas [300] The interaction between Japanese and European art has been significant: for example ukiyo-e prints, which began to be exported in the 19th century in the movement known as Japonism, had a significant influence on the development of modern art in the West, most notably on post-Impressionism [300]\n\n\nLiterature and philosophy\nThe earliest works of Japanese literature include the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki chronicles and the Man'yōshū poetry anthology, all from the 8th century and written in Chinese characters [305] [306] In the early Heian period, the system of phonograms known as kana (hiragana and katakana) was developed [307] The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter is considered the oldest extant Japanese narrative [308] An account of court life is given in The Pillow Book by Sei Shōnagon, while The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu is often described as the world's first novel [309] [310]\n\n\nPerforming arts\nJapanese music is eclectic and diverse Many instruments, such as the koto, were introduced in the 9th and 10th centuries The popular folk music, with the guitar-like shamisen, dates from the 16th century [315] Western classical music, introduced in the late 19th century, forms an integral part of Japanese culture [316] Kumi-daiko (ensemble drumming) was developed in postwar Japan and became very popular in North America [317] Popular music in post-war Japan has been heavily influenced by American and European trends, which has led to the evolution of J-pop [318] Karaoke is a significant cultural activity [319]\n\n\nMedia\nAccording to the 2015 NHK survey on television viewing in Japan, 79 percent of Japanese watch television daily [322] Japanese television dramas are viewed both within Japan and internationally [323] Many Japanese media franchises have gained considerable global popularity and are among the world's highest-grossing media franchises Japanese newspapers are among the most circulated in the world as of 2016 [update] [324]\n\n\nHolidays\nOfficially, Japan has 16 national, government-recognized holidays Public holidays in Japan are regulated by the Public Holiday Law (国民の祝日に関する法律, Kokumin no Shukujitsu ni Kansuru Hōritsu) of 1948 [333] Beginning in 2000, Japan implemented the Happy Monday System, which moved a number of national holidays to Monday in order to obtain a long weekend [334] The national holidays in Japan are New Year's Day on January 1, Coming of Age Day on the second Monday of January, National Foundation Day on February 11, The Emperor's Birthday on February 23, Vernal Equinox Day on March 20 or 21, Shōwa Day on April 29, Constitution Memorial Day on May 3, Greenery Day on May 4, Children's Day on May 5, Marine Day on the third Monday of July, Mountain Day on August 11, Respect for the Aged Day on the third Monday of September, Autumnal Equinox on September 23 or 24, Health and Sports Day on the second Monday of October, Culture Day on November 3, and Labor Thanksgiving Day on November 23 [335]\n\n\nCuisine\nJapanese cuisine offers a vast array of regional specialties that use traditional recipes and local ingredients [336] Seafood and Japanese rice or noodles are traditional staples [337] Japanese curry, since its introduction to Japan from British India, is so widely consumed that it can be termed a national dish, alongside ramen and sushi [338] [339] Traditional Japanese sweets are known as wagashi [340] Ingredients such as red bean paste and mochi are used More modern-day tastes include green tea ice cream [341]\n\n\nSports\nTraditionally, sumo is considered Japan's national sport [345] Japanese martial arts such as judo and kendo are taught as part of the compulsory junior high school curriculum [346] Baseball is the most popular sport in the country [347] Japan's top professional league, Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), was established in 1936 [348] Since the establishment of the Japan Professional Football League (J.League) in 1992, association football gained a wide following [349] The country co-hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup with South Korea [350] Japan has one of the most successful football teams in Asia, winning the Asian Cup four times, [351] and the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2011 [352] Golf is also popular in Japan [353]\n\n\nSee also\nGovernment\n\n\nNotes\nGovernment\n\n\nReferences\nGovernment\n\n\nExternal

It is a country known for its rich history, unique culture, and breathtaking natural beauty. With a population of over 127 million people, Japan is the world's eleventh most populous country. The country's capital and largest city is Tokyo, which is also one of the world's most populous cities. Japan is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of government, and it is a member of the United Nations, the G7, and the G20.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name for Japan in Japanese is written using the kanji (, meaning \"sun origin\"), and is pronounced Nihon or Nippon.

According to legend, Emperor Jimmu (descendant of Amaterasu) founded a kingdom in central Japan in 660 BC, beginning a continuous imperial line.\n\n**Prehistoric to Classical History**\n\nModern humans arrived in Japan around 38,000 years ago (~36,000 BC), marking the beginning of the Japanese Paleolithic. This was followed from around 14,500 BC (the start of the Jōmon period) by a Mesolithic to Neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture. Clay vessels from the period are among the oldest surviving examples of pottery. The Japonic-speaking Yayoi people entered the archipelago from the Korean Peninsula, intermingling with the Jōmon; the Yayoi period saw the introduction of practices including wet-rice farming, a new style of pottery, and metallurgy from China and Korea.\n\n**Feudal Era**\n\nJapan's feudal era was characterized by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class of warriors, the samurai. In 1185, following the defeat of the Taira clan by the Minamoto clan in the Genpei War, samurai Minamoto no Yoritomo established a military government at Kamakura. After Yoritomo's death, the Hōjō clan came to power as regents for the shōgun. The Zen school of Buddhism was introduced from China in the Kamakura period (1185–1333) and became popular among the samurai class. The Kamakura shogunate repelled Mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281 but was eventually overthrown by Emperor Go-Daigo. Go-Daigo was defeated by Ashikaga Takauji in 1336, beginning the Muromachi period (1336–1573). The succeeding Ashikaga shogunate failed to control the feudal warlords (daimyō) and a civil war began in 1467, opening the century-long Sengoku period (\"Warring States\").\n\n**Modern Era**\n\nThe United States Navy sent Commodore Matthew C Perry to force the opening of Japan to the outside world. Arriving at Uraga with four \"Black Ships\" in July 1853, the Perry Expedition resulted in the March 1854 Convention of Kanagawa. Subsequent similar treaties with other Western countries brought economic and political crises. The resignation of the shōgun led to the Boshin War and the establishment of a centralized state nominally unified under the emperor (the Meiji Restoration). Adopting Western political, judicial, and military institutions, the Cabinet organized the Privy Council, introduced the Meiji Constitution (November 29, 1890), and assembled the Imperial Diet. During the Meiji period (1868–1912), the Empire of Japan emerged as the most developed state in Asia and as an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence.\n\n**Geography**\n\nJapan comprises 14,125 islands extending along the Pacific coast of Asia. It stretches over 3000 km (1900 mi) northeast–southwest from the Sea of Okhotsk to the East China Sea. The country's five main islands, from north to south, are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, and Okinawa. The Ryukyu Islands, which include Okinawa, are a chain to the south of Kyushu. The Nanpō Islands are south and east of the main islands of Japan. As of 2019, Japan's territory is 377,975.24 km² (145,937.06 sq mi).\n\n**Climate**\n\nThe climate of Japan is predominantly temperate but varies greatly from north to south. The northernmost region, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers. Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.\n\n**Biodiversity**\n\nJapan has nine forest ecoregions which reflect the climate and geography of the islands. They range from subtropical moist broadleaf forests in the Ryūkyū and Bonin Islands, to temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the mild climate regions of the main islands, to temperate coniferous forests in the cold, winter portions of the northern islands. Japan has over 90,000 species of wildlife as of 2019, including the brown bear, the Japanese macaque, the Japanese raccoon dog, the small Japanese field mouse, and the Japanese giant salamander.\n\n**Environment**\n\nIn the period of rapid economic growth after World War II, environmental policies were downplayed by the government and industrial corporations; as a result, environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s. Responding to rising concerns, the government introduced environmental protection laws in 1970. The oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of Japan's lack of natural resources.\n\n**Government and Politics**\n\nJapan is a unitary state and constitutional monarchy in which the power of the Emperor is limited to a ceremonial role. Executive power is instead wielded by the Prime Minister of Japan and his Cabinet, whose sovereignty is vested in the Japanese people. Naruhito is the Emperor of Japan, having succeeded his father Akihito upon his accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne in 2019.\n\n**Administrative Divisions**\n\nJapan is divided into 47 prefectures, each overseen by an elected governor and legislature. In the following table, the prefectures are grouped by region:\n\n* Hokkaido\n* Aomori, Akita, Iwate, Miyagi, Yamagata, Fukushima\n* Tochigi, Ibaraki, Gunma, Saitama, Chiba, Tokyo, Kanagawa\n* Niigata, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Yamanashi, Nagano, Gifu, Shizuoka, Aichi\n* Mie, Shiga, Kyoto, Osaka, Hyogo, Nara, Wakayama\n* Tottori, Shimane, Okayama, Hiroshima, Yamaguchi\n* Tokushima, Kagawa, Ehime, Kochi\n* Fukuoka, Saga, Nagasaki, Oita, Miyazaki, Kumamoto, Kagoshima\n* Okinawa\n\n**Foreign Relations**\n\nA member state of the United Nations since 1956, Japan is one of the G4 countries seeking reform of the Security Council. Japan is a member of the G7, APEC, and \"ASEAN Plus Three\", and is a participant in the East Asia Summit. It is the world's fifth-largest donor of official development assistance, donating US$9.2 billion in 2014. In 2024, Japan had the fourth-largest diplomatic network in the world.\n\n**Military**\n\nJapan is the third-highest-ranked Asian country in the 2024 Global Peace Index. It spent 1.1% of its total GDP on its defense budget in 2022, and maintained the tenth-largest military budget in the world in 2022. The country's military (the Japan Self-Defense Forces) is restricted by Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which renounces Japan's right to declare war or use military force in international disputes. The military is governed by the Ministry of Defense, and primarily consists of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force.\n\n**Law Enforcement**\n\nDomestic security in Japan is provided mainly by the prefectural police departments, under the oversight of the National Police Agency. As the central coordinating body for the Prefectural Police Departments, the National Police Agency is administered by the National Public Safety Commission. The Special Assault Team comprises national-level counter-terrorism tactical units that cooperate with territorial-level Anti-Firearms Squads and Counter-NBC Terrorism Squads. The Japan Coast Guard guards territorial waters surrounding Japan and uses surveillance and control countermeasures against smuggling, marine environmental crime, poaching, piracy, spy ships, unauthorized foreign fishing vessels, and illegal immigration.\n\n**Human Rights**\n\nJapanese society traditionally places a strong emphasis on collective harmony and conformity, which has led to the suppression of individual rights. Japan's constitution prohibits racial and religious discrimination, and the country is a signatory to numerous international human rights treaties. However, it lacks any laws against discrimination based on race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or gender identity and does not have a national human rights institution.\n\n**Economy**\n\nJapan has the world's fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP, after that of the United States, China, and Germany. As of 2021, Japan's labor force is the world's eighth-largest, consisting of over 68.6 million workers. As of 2022, Japan has a low unemployment rate of around 2.6%. Its poverty rate is the second-highest among the G7 countries, exceeding 15.7% of the population. Japan has the highest ratio of public debt to GDP among advanced economies, with a national debt estimated at 248% relative to GDP as of 2022.\n\n**Agriculture and Fishery**\n\nThe Japanese agricultural sector accounts for about 1.2% of the country's total GDP as of 2018. Only 11.5% of Japan's land is suitable for cultivation. Because of this lack of arable land, a system of terraces is used to farm in small areas. This results in one of the world's highest levels of crop yields per unit area, with an agricultural self-sufficiency rate of about 50% as of 2018.\n\n**Industry and Services**\n\nJapan has a large industrial capacity and is home to some of the \"largest and most technologically advanced producers of motor vehicles, machine tools, steel and nonferrous metals, ships, chemical substances, textiles, and processed foods.\" Japan's industrial sector makes up approximately 27.5% of its GDP. The country's manufacturing output is the fourth-highest in the world as of 2023.\n\n**Science and Technology**\n\nRelative to gross domestic product, Japan's research and development budget is the second-highest in the world, with 867,000 researchers sharing a 19-trillion-yen research and development budget as of 2017. The country has produced twenty-two Nobel laureates in either physics, chemistry, or medicine, and three Fields medalists.\n\n**Infrastructure**\n\nJapan has invested heavily in transportation infrastructure since the 1990s. The country has approximately 1,200,000 kilometers (750,000 miles) of roads made up of 1,000,000 kilometers (620,000 miles) of city, town, and village roads, 130,000 kilometers (81,000 miles) of prefectural roads, 54,736 kilometers (34,011 miles) of general national highways, and 7,641 kilometers (4,748 miles) of national expressways as of 2017.\n\n**Transportation**\n\nJapan has invested heavily in transportation infrastructure since the 1990s. The country has approximately 1,200,000 kilometers (750,000 miles) of roads made up of 1,000,000 kilometers (620,000 miles) of city, town, and village roads, 130,000 kilometers (81,000 miles) of prefectural roads, 54,736 kilometers (34,011 miles) of general national highways, and 7,641 kilometers (4,748 miles) of national expressways as of 2017.\n\n**Energy**\n\nAs of 2019, 37.1% of energy in Japan was produced from petroleum, 25.1% from coal, 22.4% from natural gas, 3.5% from hydropower, and 2.8% from nuclear power, among other sources. Nuclear power was down from 11.2% in 2010. By May 2012, all of the country's nuclear power plants had been taken offline because of ongoing public opposition following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011, though government officials continued to try to sway public opinion in favor of returning at least some to service. The Sendai Nuclear Power Plant restarted in 2015, and since then several other nuclear power plants have been restarted. Japan lacks significant domestic reserves and has a heavy dependence on imported energy, so the country has aimed to diversify its sources and maintain high levels of energy efficiency.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nJapan has a population of almost 125 million, of whom nearly 122 million are Japanese nationals (2022 estimates). A small population of foreign residents makes up the remainder. Japan is the world's fastest-aging country and has the highest proportion of elderly citizens of any country, comprising one-third of its total population. This is the result of a post–World War II baby boom, which was followed by an increase in life expectancy and a decrease in birth rates. Japan has a total fertility rate of 1.4, which is below the replacement rate of 2.1, and is among the world's lowest. As of 2020, over 28.7% of the population is over 65, or more than one in four out of the Japanese population.\n\n**Languages**\n\nThe Japanese language is Japan's de facto national language and the primary written and spoken language of most people in the country. Japanese writing uses kanji (, meaning \"Chinese characters\") and two sets of kana (syllabaries based on cursive script and radicals used by kanji), as well as the Latin alphabet and Arabic numerals. English has taken a major role in Japan as a business and international link language, and is a compulsory subject at the junior and senior high school levels. Japanese Sign Language is the primary sign language used in Japan and has gained some official recognition, but its usage has been historically hindered by discriminatory policies and a lack of educational support.\n\n**Religion**\n\nJapan's constitution guarantees full religious freedom. Upper estimates suggest that 84–96% of the Japanese population subscribe to Shinto as its indigenous religion. However, these estimates are based on people affiliated with a temple, rather than the number of true believers. Many Japanese people practice both Shinto and Buddhism; they can identify with both religions or describe themselves as non-religious or spiritual. The level of participation in religious ceremonies as a cultural tradition remains high, especially during festivals and occasions such as the first shrine visit of the New Year. Taoism and Confucianism from China have also influenced Japanese beliefs and customs.\n\n**Education**\n\nSince the 1947 Fundamental Law of Education, compulsory education in Japan comprises elementary and junior high school, which together last for nine years. Almost all children continue their education at a three-year senior high school. The top-ranking university in the country is the University of Tokyo. Starting in April 2016, various schools began the academic year with elementary school and junior high school integrated into one nine-year compulsory schooling program; MEXT plans for this approach to be adopted nationwide.\n\n**Health**\n\nHealth care in Japan is provided by national and local governments. Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance program administered by local governments. Since 1973, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance.\n\n**Culture**\n\nContemporary Japanese culture combines influences from Asia, Europe, and North America. Traditional Japanese arts include crafts such as ceramics, textiles, lacquerware, swords, and dolls; performances of bunraku, kabuki, noh, dance, and rakugo; and other practices, the tea ceremony, ikebana, martial arts, calligraphy, origami, onsen, Geisha, and games. Japan has a developed system for the protection and promotion of both tangible and intangible Cultural Properties and National Treasures. Twenty-two sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, eighteen of which are of cultural significance. Japan is considered a cultural superpower.\n\n**Art and Architecture**\n\nThe history of Japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native Japanese esthetics and imported ideas. The interaction between Japanese and European art has been significant: for example, ukiyo-e prints, which began to be exported in the 19th century in the movement known as Japonism, had a significant influence on the development of modern art in the West, most notably on post-Impressionism.\n\n**Literature and Philosophy**\n\nThe earliest works of Japanese literature include the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki chronicles and the Man'yōshū poetry anthology, all from the 8th century and written in Chinese characters. In the early Heian period, the system of phonograms known as kana (hiragana and katakana) was developed. The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter is considered the oldest extant Japanese narrative. An account of court life is given in The Pillow Book by Sei Shōnagon, while The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu is often described as the world's first novel.\n\n**Performing Arts**\n\nJapanese music is eclectic and diverse. Many instruments, such as the koto, were introduced in the 9th and 10th centuries. The popular folk music, with the guitar-like shamisen, dates from the 16th century. Western classical music, introduced in the late 19th century, forms an integral part of Japanese culture. Kumi-daiko (ensemble drumming) was developed in postwar Japan and became very popular in North America. Popular music in post-war Japan has been heavily influenced by American and European trends, which has led to the evolution of J-pop. Karaoke is a significant cultural activity.\n\n**Media**\n\nAccording to the 2015 NHK survey on television viewing", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Japan\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe name for Japan in Japanese is written using the kanji 日本 and is pronounced Nihon or Nippon [11] Before 日本 was adopted in the early 8th century, the country was known in China as Wa (倭, changed in Japan around 757 to 和) and in Japan by the endonym Yamato [12] Nippon, the original Sino-Japanese reading of the characters, is favored for official uses, including on Japanese banknotes and postage stamps [11] Nihon is typically used in everyday speech and reflects shifts in Japanese phonology during the Edo period [12] The characters 日本 mean \"sun origin\", [11] which is the source of the popular Western epithet \"Land of the Rising Sun\" [13]\n\n\nHistory\nModern humans arrived in Japan around 38,000 years ago (~36,000 BC), marking the beginning of the Japanese Paleolithic [18] This was followed from around 14,500 BC (the start of the Jōmon period) by a Mesolithic to Neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture [19] Clay vessels from the period are among the oldest surviving examples of pottery [20] The Japonic-speaking Yayoi people entered the archipelago from the Korean Peninsula, [21] [22] [23] intermingling with the Jōmon; [23] the Yayoi period saw the introduction of practices including wet-rice farming, [24] a new style of pottery, [25] and metallurgy from China and Korea [26] According to legend, Emperor Jimmu (descendant of Amaterasu) founded a kingdom in central Japan in 660 BC, beginning a continuous imperial line [27]\n\n\nPrehistoric to classical

In 1185, following the defeat of the Taira clan by the Minamoto clan in the Genpei War, samurai Minamoto no Yoritomo established a military government at Kamakura [38] After Yoritomo's death, the Hōjō clan came to power as regents for the shōgun [34] The Zen school of Buddhism was introduced from China in the Kamakura period (1185–1333) and became popular among the samurai class [39] The Kamakura shogunate repelled Mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281 but was eventually overthrown by Emperor Go-Daigo [34] Go-Daigo was defeated by Ashikaga Takauji in 1336, beginning the Muromachi period (1336–1573) [40] The succeeding Ashikaga shogunate failed to control the feudal warlords (daimyō) and a civil war began in 1467, opening the century-long Sengoku period (\"Warring States\") [41]\n\n\nModern era\nThe United States Navy sent Commodore Matthew C Perry to force the opening of Japan to the outside world Arriving at Uraga with four \"Black Ships\" in July 1853, the Perry

most developed state in Asia and as an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence [53] [54] [55] After victories in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905), Japan gained control of Taiwan, Korea and the southern half of Sakhalin, [56] [52] and annexed Korea in 1910 [57] The Japanese population doubled from 35 million in 1873 to 70 million by 1935, with a significant shift to urbanization [58] [59]\n\n\nGeography\nJapan comprises 14,125 islands extending along the Pacific coast of Asia [78] It stretches over 3000 km (1900 mi) northeast–southwest from the Sea of Okhotsk to the East China Sea [79] [80] The country's five main islands, from north to south, are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu and Okinawa [81] The Ryukyu Islands, which include Okinawa, are a chain to the south of Kyushu The Nanpō Islands are south and east of the main islands of Japan Together they are often known as the Japanese archipelago [82] As of 2019 [update], Japan's territory is 377,975.24 km2 (145,937.06 sq mi) [4] Japan has the sixth-longest coastline in the world at 29,751 km (18,486 mi) Because of its far-flung outlying islands, Japan's exclusive economic zone is the eighth-largest in the world, covering 4,470,000 km2 (1,730,000 sq mi) [83] [84]\n\n\nClimate\nThe climate of Japan is predominantly temperate but varies greatly from north to south The northernmost region, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter [97]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nJapan has nine forest ecoregions which reflect the climate and geography of the islands They range from subtropical moist broadleaf forests in the Ryūkyū and Bonin Islands, to temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the mild climate regions of the main islands, to temperate coniferous forests in the cold, winter portions of the northern islands [103] Japan has over 90,000 species of wildlife as of 2019 [update], [104] including the brown bear, the Japanese macaque, the Japanese raccoon dog, the small Japanese field mouse, and the Japanese giant salamander [105] There are 53 Ramsar wetland sites in Japan [106] Five sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List for their outstanding natural value [107]\n\n\nEnvironment\nIn the period of rapid economic growth after World War II, environmental policies were downplayed by the government and industrial corporations; as a result, environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s Responding to rising concerns, the government introduced environmental protection laws in 1970 [108] The oil crisis in 1973 also

Emperor is limited to a ceremonial role [114] Executive power is instead wielded by the Prime Minister of Japan and his Cabinet, whose sovereignty is vested in the Japanese people [115] Naruhito is the Emperor of Japan, having succeeded his father Akihito upon his accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne in 2019 [114]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nJapan is divided into 47 prefectures, each overseen by an elected governor and legislature [114] In the following table, the prefectures are grouped by region: [124]\n\n\nForeign relations\nA member state of the United Nations since 1956, Japan is one of the G4 countries seeking reform of the Security Council [125] Japan is a member of the G7, APEC, and \"ASEAN Plus Three\", and is a participant in the East Asia Summit [126] It is the world's fifth-largest donor of official development assistance, donating US$9.2 billion in 2014 [127] In 2024, Japan had the fourth-largest diplomatic network in the world [128]\n\n\nMilitary\nJapan is the third highest-ranked Asian country in the 2024 Global Peace Index [137] It spent 1.1% of its total GDP on its defence budget in 2022, [138] and maintained the tenth-largest military budget in the world in 2022 [139] The country's military (the Japan Self-Defense Forces) is restricted by Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which renounces Japan's right to declare war or use military force in international disputes [140] The military is governed by the Ministry of Defense, and primarily consists of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, and the

identity and does not have a national human rights institution [161]\n\n\nEconomy\nJapan has the world's fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP, after that of the United States, China and Germany; and the fourth-largest economy by PPP-adjusted GDP [169] As of 2021 [update], Japan's labor force is the world's eighth-largest, consisting of over 68.6 million workers [83] As of 2022 [update], Japan has a low unemployment rate of around 2.6% [170] Its poverty rate is the second highest among the G7 countries, [171] and exceeds 15.7% of the population [172] Japan has the highest ratio of public debt to GDP among advanced economies, [173] with a national debt estimated at 248% relative to GDP as of 2022 [update] [174] The Japanese yen is the world's third-largest reserve currency after the US dollar and the euro [175]\n\n\nAgriculture and fishery\nThe Japanese agricultural sector accounts for about 1.2% of the country's total GDP as of 2018 [update] [116] Only 11.5% of Japan's land is suitable for cultivation [187] Because of this lack of arable land, a system of terraces is used to farm in small areas [188] This results in one of the world's highest levels of crop yields per unit area, with an agricultural self-sufficiency rate of about 50% as of 2018 [update] [189] Japan's small agricultural sector is highly subsidized and protected [190] There has been a growing concern about farming as farmers are aging with a difficult time finding successors [191]\n\n\nIndustry and services\nJapan has a large industrial capacity and is home to some of the \"largest and most technologically advanced producers of motor vehicles, machine tools, steel and nonferrous metals, ships, chemical substances, textiles, and processed foods\" [83] Japan's industrial sector makes up approximately 27.5% of its GDP [83] The country's manufacturing output is the fourth highest in the world as of 2023 [update] [196]\n\n\nScience and technology\nRelative to gross domestic product, Japan's research and development budget is the second highest in the world, [203] with 867,000 researchers sharing a 19-trillion-yen research and development budget as of 2017 [update] [204] The country has produced twenty-two Nobel laureates in either physics, chemistry or medicine, [205] and three Fields medalists [206]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nJapan has invested heavily in transportation infrastructure since the 1990s [220] The country has approximately 1,200,000 kilometers (750,000 miles) of roads made up of 1,000,000 kilometers (620,000 miles) of city, town and village roads, 130,000 kilometers (81,000 miles) of prefectural roads, 54,736 kilometers (34,011 miles) of general national highways and 7641 kilometers (4748 miles) of national expressways as of 2017 [update] [221]\n\n\nTransportation\nJapan has invested heavily in transportation infrastructure since the 1990s [220] The country has approximately 1,200,000 kilometers (750,000 miles) of roads made up of

kilometers (4748 miles) of national expressways as of 2017 [update] [221]\n\n\nEnergy\nAs of 2019 [update], 37.1% of energy in Japan was produced from petroleum, 25.1% from coal, 22.4% from natural gas, 3.5% from hydropower and 2.8% from nuclear power, among other sources Nuclear power was down from 11.2 percent in 2010 [226] By May 2012 all of the country's nuclear power plants had been taken offline because of ongoing public opposition following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011, though government officials continued to try to sway public opinion in favor of returning at least some to service [227] The Sendai Nuclear Power Plant restarted in 2015, [228] and since then several other nuclear power plants have been restarted [229] Japan lacks significant domestic reserves and has a heavy dependence on imported energy [230] The country has therefore aimed to diversify its sources and maintain high levels of energy efficiency [231]\n\n\nDemographics\nJapan has a population of almost 125 million, of whom nearly 122 million are Japanese nationals (2022 estimates) [232] A small population of foreign residents makes up the remainder [233] \nJapan is the world's fastest aging country and has the highest proportion of elderly citizens of any country, comprising one-third of its total population; [234] this is the result of a post–World War II baby boom, which was followed by an increase in life expectancy and a decrease in birth rates [235] Japan has a total fertility rate of 1.4, which is below the replacement rate of 2.1, and is among the world's lowest; [236] it has a median age of 48.4, the highest in the world [237] As of 2020 [update], over 28.7 percent of the population is over 65, or more than one in four out of the Japanese population [234] As a growing number of younger Japanese are not marrying or remaining childless, [238] [239] Japan's population is expected to drop to around 88 million by 2065 [234]\n\n\nLanguages\nThe Japanese language is Japan's de facto national language and the primary written and spoken language of most people in the country [255] Japanese writing uses kanji (Chinese characters) and two sets of kana (syllabaries based on cursive script and radicals used by kanji), as well as the Latin alphabet and Arabic numerals [256] English has taken a major role in Japan as a business and international link language, and is a compulsory subject at the junior and senior high school levels [257] Japanese Sign Language is the primary sign language used in Japan and has gained some official recognition, but its usage has been historically hindered by discriminatory policies and a lack of educational support [255]\n\n\nReligion\nJapan's constitution guarantees full religious freedom [262] Upper estimates suggest that 84–96 percent of the Japanese population subscribe to Shinto as its indigenous religion [263] However, these estimates are based on people affiliated with a temple, rather than the number of true believers Many Japanese people practice both Shinto and Buddhism; they can identify with both religions or describe themselves as non-religious or spiritual [264] The level of participation in religious ceremonies as a cultural tradition remains high, especially during festivals and occasions such as the first shrine visit of the New Year [265] Taoism and Confucianism from China have also influenced Japanese beliefs and customs [30]\n\n\nEducation\nSince the 1947 Fundamental Law of Education, compulsory education in Japan comprises elementary and junior high school, which together last for nine years [272] Almost all children continue their education at a three-year senior high school [273] The top-ranking university in the country is the University of Tokyo [274] Starting in April 2016, various schools began the academic year with elementary school and junior high school integrated into one nine-year compulsory schooling program; MEXT plans for this approach to be adopted nationwide [275]\n\n\nHealth\nHealth care in Japan is provided by national and local governments Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance program administered by local governments [282] Since 1973, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance [283]\n\n\nCulture\nContemporary Japanese culture combines influences from Asia, Europe, and North America [293] Traditional Japanese arts include crafts such as ceramics, textiles, lacquerware, swords and dolls; performances of bunraku, kabuki, noh, dance, and rakugo; and other practices, the tea ceremony, ikebana, martial arts, calligraphy, origami, onsen, Geisha and games Japan has a developed system for the protection and promotion of both tangible and intangible Cultural Properties and National Treasures [294] Twenty-two sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, eighteen of which are of cultural significance [295] Japan is considered a cultural superpower [296] [297] [298] [299]\n\n\nArt and architecture\nThe history of Japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native Japanese esthetics and imported ideas [300] The interaction between Japanese and European art has been significant: for example ukiyo-e prints, which began to be exported in the 19th century in the movement known as Japonism, had a significant influence on the development of modern art in the West, most notably on post-Impressionism [300]\n\n\nLiterature and philosophy\nThe earliest works of Japanese literature include the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki chronicles and the Man'yōshū poetry anthology, all from the 8th century and written in Chinese characters [305] [306] In the early Heian period, the system of phonograms known as kana (hiragana and katakana) was developed [307] The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter is considered the oldest extant Japanese narrative [308] An account of court life is given in The Pillow Book by Sei Shōnagon, while The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu is often described as the world's first novel [309] [310]\n\n\nPerforming arts\nJapanese music is eclectic and diverse Many instruments, such as the koto, were introduced in the 9th and 10th centuries The popular folk music, with the guitar-like shamisen, dates from the 16th century [315] Western classical music, introduced in the late 19th century, forms an integral part of Japanese culture [316] Kumi-daiko (ensemble drumming) was developed in postwar Japan and became very popular in North America [317] Popular music in post-war Japan has been heavily influenced by American and European trends, which has led to the evolution of J-pop [318] Karaoke is a significant cultural activity [319]\n\n\nMedia\nAccording to the 2015 NHK survey on television viewing in Japan, 79 percent of Japanese watch television daily [322] Japanese television dramas are viewed both within Japan and internationally [323] Many Japanese media franchises have gained considerable global popularity and are among the world's highest-grossing media franchises Japanese newspapers are among the most circulated in the world as of 2016 [update] [324]\n\n\nHolidays\nOfficially, Japan has 16 national, government-recognized holidays Public holidays in Japan are regulated by the Public Holiday Law (国民の祝日に関する法律, Kokumin no Shukujitsu ni Kansuru Hōritsu) of 1948 [333] Beginning in 2000, Japan implemented the Happy Monday System, which moved a number of national holidays to Monday in order to obtain a long weekend [334] The national holidays in Japan are New Year's Day on January 1, Coming of Age Day on the second Monday of January, National Foundation Day on February 11, The Emperor's Birthday on February 23, Vernal Equinox Day on March 20 or 21, Shōwa Day on April 29, Constitution Memorial Day on May 3, Greenery Day on May 4, Children's Day on May 5, Marine Day on the third Monday of July, Mountain Day on August 11, Respect for the Aged Day on the third Monday of September, Autumnal Equinox on September 23 or 24, Health and Sports Day on the second Monday of October, Culture Day on November 3, and Labor Thanksgiving Day on November 23 [335]\n\n\nCuisine\nJapanese cuisine offers a vast array of regional specialties that use traditional recipes and local ingredients [336] Seafood and Japanese rice or noodles are traditional staples [337] Japanese curry, since its introduction to Japan from British India, is so widely consumed that it can be termed a national dish, alongside ramen and sushi [338] [339] Traditional Japanese sweets are known as wagashi [340] Ingredients such as red bean paste and mochi are used More modern-day tastes include green tea ice cream [341]\n\n\nSports\nTraditionally, sumo is considered Japan's national sport [345] Japanese martial arts such as judo and kendo are taught as part of the compulsory junior high school curriculum [346] Baseball is the most popular sport in the country [347] Japan's top professional league, Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), was established in 1936 [348] Since the establishment of the Japan Professional Football League (J.League) in 1992, association football gained a wide following [349] The country co-hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup with South Korea [350] Japan has one of the most successful football teams in Asia, winning the Asian Cup four times, [351] and the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2011 [352] Golf is also popular in Japan [353]\n\n\nSee also\nGovernment\n\n\nNotes\nGovernment\n\n\nReferences\nGovernment\n\n\nExternal

This section provides a mechanism for the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet members to declare the President incapacitated and assume the powers of the office.\n\n**Historical Background**\n\nThe idea for the Twenty-Fifth Amendment was born out of concerns about the lack of clarity regarding presidential succession and the procedures for filling a vacancy in the office of Vice President. In 1963, Senator Kenneth Keating proposed a Constitutional amendment that would have enabled Congress to enact legislation providing for how to determine when a president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of the presidency. However, this proposal was ultimately rejected in favor of the Bayh-Celler proposal, which provided a more detailed and specific process for handling presidential disability.\n\n**Proposal, Enactment, and Ratification**\n\nThe Bayh-Celler proposal was introduced in the Senate by Senator Birch Bayh on January 6, 1965, and in the House of Representatives by Representative Emanuel Celler on January 10, 1965. The proposal received bipartisan support and was endorsed by President Lyndon B. Johnson on January 28, 1965. The amendment was ratified by Nebraska on July 12, 1965, and by Nevada on February 10, 1967, becoming the 25th Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\n**Invocations**\n\nThe Twenty-Fifth Amendment has been invoked several times since its ratification. On October 10, 1973, Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned, and President Richard Nixon nominated Representative Gerald Ford to replace him as Vice President. Ford was confirmed by the Senate and the House and took office on December 6, 1973.\n\nOn December 22, 1978, President Jimmy Carter considered invoking Section 3 of the amendment in advance of hemorrhoid surgery, but ultimately decided against it. Since then, several other presidents have contemplated invoking Section 3, but have ultimately decided against it.\n\nOn July 12, 1985, President Ronald Reagan underwent a colonoscopy and was diagnosed with bowel cancer. He consulted with his advisors about invoking Section 3, but ultimately decided against it. On July 13, 1985, Reagan signed a letter declaring that he was mindful of Section 3, but did not invoke it.\n\nOn June 29, 2002, President George W. Bush explicitly invoked Section 3 of the amendment, temporarily transferring his powers to Vice President Dick Cheney before undergoing a colonoscopy. Bush awoke about 40 minutes later, but refrained from resuming his presidential powers until 9:24 a.m. to ensure that no aftereffects remained.\n\nOn November 19, 2021, President Joe Biden temporarily transferred his powers and duties to Vice President Kamala Harris before undergoing a colonoscopy, making her Acting President from 10:10 a.m. to 11:35 a.m.\n\n**Section 4**\n\nSection 4 of the amendment has never been invoked. However, there have been several instances where the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet members have considered invoking Section 4.\n\nFollowing the attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan on March 30, 1981, Vice President George H.W. Bush did not assume the presidential powers and duties as Acting President, despite some advisors suggesting that he should have invoked Section 4.\n\nIn 2021, some of President Trump's Cabinet members reportedly considered invoking Section 4 after the January 6 United States Capitol attack, but ultimately decided against it.\n\n**Ratification Status**\n\nThe following states have not

Bush\nOn July 12, 1985, President Ronald Reagan underwent a colonoscopy and was diagnosed with bowel cancer He elected to have the lesion removed immediately, [40] and consulted with White House counsel Fred Fielding about whether to invoke Section 3, and in particular about whether doing so would set an undesirable precedent Fielding and White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan recommended that Reagan transfer power, and two letters were drafted: one specifically invoking Section 3, the other mentioning only that Reagan was mindful of its provisions On July 13, Reagan signed the letter mentioning that he was mindful of Section 3 [41] before being placed under general anesthesia for a colectomy, [42] and Vice President George H W Bush was acting president from 11:28 a.m until 7:22 pm, when Reagan transmitted a letter declaring himself able to resume his duties [43]\n\n\n2002 and 2007: Dick Cheney\nOn June 29, 2002, President George W Bush explicitly invoked Section 3 in temporarily transferring his powers to Vice President Dick Cheney before undergoing a colonoscopy, which began at 7:09 am Bush awoke about forty minutes later, but refrained from resuming his presidential powers until 9:24 a.m to ensure that no aftereffects remained [41] [45] According to his staff, Cheney (as acting president) held his regular national security and homeland security meetings with aides at the White House, but made no appearances and took no recorded actions while acting president [45]\n\n\n2021: Kamala Harris\nOn November 19, 2021, President Joe Biden temporarily transferred his powers and duties to Vice President Kamala Harris before undergoing a colonoscopy, making her acting president from 10:10 a.m until 11:35 am This is the first time a woman held the powers and duties of the president of the United States [47] [48]\n\n\nSection 4\nSection 4 has never been invoked [citation needed]\n\n\nConsidered invocations of  Section 4\nFollowing the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan on March 30, 1981, Vice President George H W Bush did not assume the presidential powers and duties as acting president Reagan had been rushed into surgery with no opportunity to invoke Section 3; Bush did not invoke Section 4 because he was on a plane at the time of the shooting, and Reagan was out of surgery by the time Bush landed in Washington [49] In 1995, Birch Bayh, the primary sponsor of the amendment in the Senate, wrote that Section 4 should have been invoked [50] Physician to the President Daniel Ruge, who supervised Reagan's treatment immediately after the shooting, said he had erred by not having Reagan invoke Section 3 because Reagan needed general anesthesia and was in an intensive care unit [51]\n\n\n1981: Reagan assassination attempt\nFollowing the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan on March 30, 1981, Vice President George H W Bush did not assume the presidential powers and duties as acting president Reagan had been rushed into surgery with no opportunity to invoke Section 3; Bush did not invoke Section 4 because he was on a plane at the time of the shooting, and Reagan was out of surgery by the time Bush landed in Washington [49] In 1995, Birch Bayh, the primary sponsor of the amendment in the Senate, wrote that Section 4 should have been invoked [50] Physician to the President Daniel Ruge, who supervised Reagan's treatment immediately after the shooting, said he had erred by not having Reagan invoke Section 3 because Reagan needed general anesthesia and was in an intensive care unit [51]\n\n\n2021: Trump and the Capitol attack\nAfter the January 6 United States Capitol attack, Trump was accused of having incited the incident, [52] [53] [54] and by evening some of his Cabinet members were reportedly considering invoking Section 4 [55]\n\n\nSee also\nThe following states have not ratified:\n\n\nNotes\nThe following states have not ratified:\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nSources\n\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

perform Christian rituals After the Mongol invasions of the region, the Kingdom of Georgia eventually was split into several states In the 19th century, the Russian Empire gradually took over the Georgian lands In the aftermath of the Russian revolution, Georgia declared independence on 26 May 1918 [57]\n\n\nHistory\nIn the 10th century AD, Georgia for the first time emerged as an ethnic concept in the territories where the Georgian language was used to perform Christian rituals After the Mongol invasions of the region, the Kingdom of Georgia eventually was split into several states In the 19th century, the Russian Empire gradually took over the Georgian lands In the aftermath of the Russian revolution, Georgia declared independence on 26 May 1918 [57]\n\n\nRussian interests and involvement\nTranscaucasia lies between the Russian region of the North Caucasus and the Middle East, constituting a \"buffer zone\" between Russia and the Middle East It borders Turkey and Iran The strategic importance of the region has made it a security concern for Russia Significant economic reasons, including access to major petroleum reserves, further affects interest in Transcaucasia Rule over Transcaucasia, according to Swedish academic Svante Cornell, would allow Russia to manage Western involvement in Central Asia, an area of geopolitical importance [80]\nRussia saw the Black Sea coast and being adjacent to Turkey as invaluable strategic attributes of Georgia [81] Russia had more vested interests in Abkhazia than in South Ossetia, since the Russian military deployment on the Black Sea coast was seen as vital to Russian influence in the Black Sea [53] Before the early 2000s, South Ossetia was originally intended as a tool to retain a grip on Georgia [68]\n\n\nUnresolved conflicts\nThe conflicts in Georgia remained at a stalemate until 2004, [86] when Mikheil Saakashvili came to power after Georgia's Rose Revolution, which ousted president Eduard Shevardnadze [87] Restoring South Ossetia and Abkhazia to Georgian control was a first concern of Saakashvili [88]\n\n\nRelations between Georgia and the West\nOne of President Saakashvili's primary aims for Georgia was to become a member state of NATO, [86] which has been one of the major stumbling blocks in Georgia–Russia relations [95]\n\n\nPrelude\nOn 16 April 2008, official ties between the Russian authorities and the separatists in Abkhazia and South Ossetia were sanctioned by an order of Russian president Vladimir Putin The separatist-authored legislative documents and the separatist-accredited bodies were also recognised [105] After a United Nations Security Council session on 23 April convened at Georgia's demand, the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Germany stated in a declaration: \"We call on the Russian Federation to revoke or not to implement its decision.\" However, this was labelled a \"tall order\" by Vitaly Churkin, Russian Ambassador to the UN [106]\n\n\nApril–July 2008\nOn 16 April 2008, official ties between the Russian authorities and the separatists in Abkhazia and South Ossetia were sanctioned by an order of Russian president Vladimir Putin The separatist-authored legislative documents and the separatist-accredited bodies were also recognised [105] After a United Nations Security Council session on 23 April convened at Georgia's demand, the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Germany stated in a declaration: \"We call on the Russian Federation to revoke or not to implement its decision.\" However, this was labelled a \"tall order\" by Vitaly Churkin, Russian Ambassador to the UN [106]\n\n\nHostilities\nAt 8:00 am on 1 August, an improvised explosive device detonated on the road near Tskhinvali near a Georgian police vehicle, wounding five police officers In response, Georgian snipers fired on South Ossetian positions, killing four Ossetians and wounding seven [136] According to the majority of reports, the South Ossetians were responsible for instigating the bomb explosion which marked the opening of hostilities [137] [138]\n\n\nEarly August\nAt 8:00 am on 1 August, an improvised explosive device detonated on the road near Tskhinvali near a Georgian police vehicle, wounding five police officers In response, Georgian snipers fired on South Ossetian positions, killing four Ossetians and wounding seven [136] According to the majority of reports, the South Ossetians were responsible for instigating the bomb explosion which marked the opening of hostilities [137] [138]\n\n\nBattle of Tskhinvali\nGeorgian artillery launched smoke bombs into South Ossetia at 23:35 on 7 August This was followed by a 15-minute intermission, which purportedly enabled the civilians to escape, before the Georgian forces began bombarding hostile positions [162] Georgian military intentionally targeted South Ossetian military objects, not civilian ones Although Georgian military had pledged safety to the Russian peacekeepers for their neutrality, the Russian peacekeepers had to follow the Russian command to attack the Georgian troops [171]\n\n\nBombing and occupation of Gori\nGori is an important city in the centre of Georgia, [186] located about 25 km (16 mi) from Tskhinvali [187] On 9 August, Russia indiscriminately bombed Gori, with targets ranging from a military garrison to several large civilian apartment buildings and a school [188] The Georgian government reported that the air raid had killed 60 civilians [189] No less than 5 Georgian cities had been bombed by 9 August [190]\n\n\nAbkhaz front\nA naval confrontation occurred between Russian and Georgian vessels on 10 August [210] According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, the Russian fleet sank one Georgian ship after Georgian boats had attacked the Russian Navy ships [211] The Russian patrol ship Mirazh was probably responsible for the sinking [212] The Georgian coast was blockaded by vessels of the Russian Black Sea Fleet on 10 August [213] [214] This was first activity since 1945 for the Black Sea Fleet, which had probably departed from Sevastopol before full-scale hostilities between Russia and Georgia began [215]\n\n\nOccupation of Poti\nPoti is the crucial seaport of Georgia on the Black Sea and serves as an essential entrance for Transcaucasia and the landlocked Central Asia [220] Russian aircraft attacked the town of Poti on 8 August, causing a two-day shutdown of the seaport [220] Russia positioned ships in the vicinity of Poti and other Georgian ports on 10 August 2008 [214] The next day, Georgian and Russian representatives said that Russian troops were in Poti However, Russia claimed it had only sent a task force for surveying the area [221] On 13 August, six Georgian watercraft were sunk by Russian troops in Poti [222] Anatoliy Nogovitsyn, Russian deputy chief of the General staff, denied the Russian presence in Poti the following day [223] One day after Russia's declaration of the beginning of the withdrawal from Georgia, 70 Russian soldiers moved into the seaport on the morning of 19 August [220] Russian soldiers took twenty-one Georgian troops prisoner and grabbed five US Humvees in Poti, taking them to a Russian-occupied military base in Senaki [224] The Wall Street Journal said that Russian actions in Poti constituted an additional attack on the Georgian economy [220] The Russian military plundered and damaged properties during their presence in Poti, even ransacking toilets [225] [226]\n\n\nBombing of Tbilisi and surroundings\nDuring the fighting in South Ossetia, the Russian Air Force repeatedly attacked Tbilisi and its surrounding areas [227] On 8 August, the Georgian Interior Ministry reported that Vaziani Military Base near the city was hit by two bombs [228] Prior to the war, the bombed base near Tbilisi had housed the Russian military before the government of Georgia forced their withdrawal The Daily Telegraph described this bombing as \"Russia's revenge\" [229] A Georgian military airstrip in Marneuli was attacked and three persons were killed [230] The Georgian government vacated their offices on 9 August [231] Georgian authorities reported on 9 August that Russian air attacks had targeted the Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline, but missed [190] Reporters for Reuters in Tbilisi reported hearing three explosions in the early-morning hours of 10 August and a Georgian Interior Ministry representative said that three bombs were dropped on Tbilisi International Airport by Russian warplanes [232] A military manufacturing plant near the airport was also attacked by Russia that day [233] A civilian radar station in Tbilisi was bombed the following day [191] Although an end to hostilities was declared on 12 August, Russian warplanes did not stop dropping bombs in Georgia throughout 12 August [234] The Wall Street Journal reported on 14 August that a reporter had witnessed 45 craters near the intersection of Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline and Baku–Supsa Pipeline south of Tbilisi [235]\n\n\nMedia and cyber war\nThe war was accompanied by a media battle between Russia and Georgia [236] The Russian military took Russian journalists to the combat zone to report news discrediting Georgia and portraying Russia as the saviour of Russian citizens in the conflict zone Russia also aired records on TV supporting its actions which had a strong effect on the local populations of South Ossetia and Abkhazia For the first time, a Russian Armed Forces spokesman was provided by the Russian authorities to give TV interviews about the war Despite these tactics and domestic success, the Russian information operation against Georgia was not successful internationally [237] In response to the information war, the Georgian government halted the broadcasting of Russian television channels in Georgia and blocked access to Russian websites [238] The information skirmishes between Georgia and Russia continued after armed hostilities had ended [236] According to political scientist Svante Cornell, the Kremlin spent millions in an international information campaign to blame Georgia for the war; [239] however, there is evidence, including some in Russian media, that Russia actually started the war [49] [239]\n\n\nCeasefire agreement\nOn 12 August, Russian President Medvedev announced the cessation of the \"peace enforcement\" operation in Georgia [243] Later that day he met French President Nicolas Sarkozy (who held the rotating EU Council presidency) and approved a six-point proposal [244] The proposal originally had four points, but Russia firmly requested to add two more Georgia requested that the additions be parenthesised; Russia objected and Sarkozy prevailed upon Saakashvili to accept the agreement [245] According to Sarkozy and Saakashvili, a sixth point in the Sarkozy proposal was removed with Medvedev's consent [246] On 14 August, South Ossetian President Eduard Kokoity and Abkhaz President Sergei Bagapsh also endorsed the plan [247] The following day Condoleezza Rice travelled to Tbilisi, where Saakashvili signed the document in her presence [248] On 16 August, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed the agreement [249]\n\n\nAftermath\nOn 17 August, Medvedev announced that Russian military would start to pull out of Georgia the following day [251] Prisoners of war were swapped by the two countries on 19 August A Georgian official said that although his country swapped five Russian soldiers for fifteen Georgians, among them two non-combatants, Georgia suspected that Russia kept two more Georgians [252] On 22 August, Russian forces withdrew from Igoeti and the Georgian police proceeded in the direction of Gori [253] Russia claimed that withdrawal of Russian forces was finished; however, Russian checkpoints stayed near Gori and two Russian lookout stations stayed near Poti [254]\n\n\nRussian withdrawal\nOn 17 August, Medvedev announced that Russian military would start to pull out of Georgia the following day [251] Prisoners of war were swapped by the two countries on 19 August A Georgian official said that although his country swapped five

police proceeded in the direction of Gori [253] Russia claimed that withdrawal of Russian forces was finished; however, Russian checkpoints stayed near Gori and two Russian lookout stations stayed near Poti [254]\n\n\nRecognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia by Russia\nOn 25 August 2008, the Russian parliament passed a motion, with no one voting against The motion called for the diplomatic recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia by President Medvedev [263] On 26 August, Medvedev issued orders recognising the two states, [264] saying that recognising the independence of the two entities \"represents the only possibility to save human lives.\" [3]\n\n\nRussian military presence\nA direct result of the war has been the increased and emboldened Russian military presence in both South Ossetia and Abkhazia While Russian armed forces were present in both regions before the outbreak of the war, in the capacity of peacekeeping forces since the civil wars in the 1990s, this was limited to 500 servicemen in South Ossetia (JPKF) and 1,600 in Abkhazia (CISPKF), [272] with the latter being expanded to over 2,000 in the months leading to the 2008 war [273] With these mechanisms becoming obsolete after the 2008 war, the Russian recognition of the independence of both regions was a prerequisite to legitimise the post-war stay of Russian armed forces with the conclusion of \"bilateral\" military cooperation and integration agreements with the newly recognised \"states\" [274]\n\n\nInternational monitors\nThe mandate of the OSCE mission in Georgia expired on 1 January 2009, after Russia refused to support its continuation OSCE monitors had been denied access to South Ossetia since the war [283] The mandate of the UNOMIG ended on 16 June 2009; its extension was also blocked by Russia, which argued that the mandate did not properly reflect Russia's position on recognition of Abkhazia's independence According to UN mission head Johan Verbeke, about 60,000 ethnic Georgians in Abkhazia became vulnerable after the mission's end [284]\n\n\nGeopolitical impact\nThe 2008 war was the first time since the fall of the Soviet Union that the Russian military had been used against an independent state, demonstrating Russia's willingness to use military force to attain its political objectives [287] Robert Kagan argued that \"Historians will come to view Aug 8, 2008, as a turning point\" because it \"marked the official return of history\" [288] The failure of the Western security organisations to react swiftly to Russia's attempt to violently revise the borders of an OSCE country revealed its deficiencies The division between Western European and Eastern European states also became apparent over the relationship with Russia Ukraine and other ex-Soviet countries received a clear message from the Russian leadership that the possible accession to NATO would cause a foreign incursion and the break-up of the country Effective takeover of Abkhazia was also one of Russia's geopolitical goals [289]\n\n\nHumanitarian impact and war crimes\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) states that all parties to the war seriously breached international laws governing war and caused many fatalities among civilians [296] HRW reported that no proof of intentional attacks on non-combatants by Georgian troops had been discovered [297] The South Ossetian parliament and several schools and nurseries were used as military posts by South Ossetian troops and volunteer militias and targeted by Georgian artillery fire Georgia stated that its strikes only intended to \"neutralize firing positions from where Georgian positions were being targeted\" HRW documented witness accounts of the usage of civilian objects by South Ossetian fighters Such usage made civilian objects permissible military aims, and HRW concluded that South Ossetian fighters put non-combatant population at risk by setting up military positions near or in civilian structures Georgia was responsible for the indiscriminate use of force by using inaccurate weapons to target military targets in civilian areas [298]\n\n\nReactions\nRussian actions during the war were heavily criticised by several Western countries:\n\n\nInternational reactions\nRussian actions during the war were heavily criticised by several Western countries:\n\n\nThe EU report\nIn November 2008, Georgia called on the EU to conduct an independent inquiry who was to blame for the conflict [329] Heidi Tagliavini, a national of Switzerland (non-EU state), oversaw the making of the EU-sponsored report which was published in September 2009 [330] The report stated that open hostilities started \".. with a large-scale Georgian military operation against the town of Tskhinvali and the surrounding areas, launched in the night of 7 to 8 August 2008\", [331] This conclusion was widely reported on by international media [332] [333] [334] However, the report also noted \".. any explanation of the origins of the conflict cannot focus solely on the artillery attack on Tskhinvali in the night of 7/8 August\", [335] since \".. it was only the culminating point of a long period of increasing tensions, provocations and incidents\", [336] and there was \".. no way to assign overall responsibility for the conflict to one side alone.\" [337] The report said it \"is not in a position\" to consider the Georgian claims of the Russian invasion before 8 August to be substantiated enough, while recognising reports in Russian media which indicated Russian troops and equipment which did not fall under the peacekeeping mandate were already present on the southern side of the Caucasus range, in South Ossetia [338] The report also stated that it could not claim \"veracity or completeness in an absolute sense\", [339] and could not give \"total assurance that there are no mistakes or omissions\" [340]\n\n\nNATO reaction in the Black Sea\nNATO increased its naval presence in the Black Sea significantly following the Russian invasion, with ships dropping anchors in Georgian ports, [343] and according to the US Navy, bringing humanitarian assistance [344] NATO said that its presence in the Black Sea was not related to the Georgian crisis; its vessels were carrying out typical visits and preplanned naval trainings with Romania and Bulgaria [345] Russian General Anatoliy Nogovitsyn recalled the limit on the number of vessels admitted into the Black Sea under the 1936 Montreux convention [346] Russian President Dmitry Medvedev questioned the claim that ships going to Georgia were bringing only humanitarian assistance, alleging the delivery of military material [347] According to political analyst Vladimir Socor, in spite of the limits on vessel's weight and length of visits set by the Montreux Convention, the US kept a continual presence in the Black Sea by alternating vessels from time to time [348]\n\n\nCombatants\nAccording to the Moscow Defence Brief, an English-language magazine published by the Russian non-governmental organisation the Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, the Georgian troops included the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Infantry Brigades, the Artillery Brigade, part of the 1st Infantry Brigade and the standalone Gori Tank Battalion Additionally, special forces and Ministry of Internal Affairs troops were deployed The total number of troops was 16,000 according to the magazine [7] According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, ten light infantry battalions of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th infantry brigades, special forces and an artillery brigade, totalling approximately 12,000 troops, had been concentrated by the start of the conflict [8] The primary task of securing Tskhinvali was accomplished by the 4th Brigade with support from the 2nd and 3rd Brigades [8] According to the EU fact-finding mission, 10,000–11,000 soldiers took part in the war [12]\n\n\nGeorgian order of battle\nAccording to the Moscow Defence Brief, an English-language magazine published by the Russian non-governmental organisation the Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, the Georgian troops included the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Infantry Brigades, the Artillery Brigade, part of the 1st Infantry Brigade and the standalone Gori Tank Battalion Additionally, special forces and Ministry of Internal Affairs troops were deployed The total number of troops was 16,000 according to the magazine [7] According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, ten light infantry battalions of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th

accomplished by the 4th Brigade with support from the 2nd and 3rd Brigades [8] According to the EU fact-finding mission, 10,000–11,000 soldiers took part in the war [12]\n\n\nRusso-South Ossetian-Abkhaz order of battle\nA sizeable portion of the Russian 58th Army, one of the foremost military units in Russia, was included in the Russian order of battle [352] It exceeds the Georgian Army in the number of forces, heavy hardware and planes [352] The 58th Army fought in Second Chechen War [353]\n\n\nMilitary analysis\nUnited States officials said that \"one of the few effective elements of the  [Georgia]'s military\" was air defence, with the analysts crediting the SA-11 Buk-1M with shooting down a Tupolev-22M bomber and contributing to the loss of some Su-25s [358] This view was supported by independent Russian analysis [180] Colonel-General Anatoliy Nogovitsyn, Russian deputy chief of general staff, said the Soviet-made Tor and Buk anti-aircraft missile systems, bought by Georgia from Ukraine, were responsible for shooting down Russian aircraft during the war [359] A Russian assessment, reported by Roger McDermott, said that Russian losses would have been significantly higher if the Georgians had not left behind a portion of their Buk-M1 systems near Senaki in western Georgia and several Osa missile launchers in South Ossetia [360] According to some reports, Georgia also possessed a battery of the Israeli-made SPYDER-SR short-range self-propelled anti-aircraft system [361] The Georgian air-defence early-warning and command-control tactical system was linked via Turkey to a NATO Air Situation Data Exchange (ASDE), which provided Georgia with intelligence during the conflict [361]\n\n\nGeorgia\nAfter the ceasefire agreement Stratfor states that Russia \"has largely destroyed Georgia's war-fighting capability\" [377] After the ceasefire was signed on 12 August, in Georgia proper, Russian troops attempted to seize and destroy Georgian armament, a process termed by the Moscow Defence Brief as the \"demilitarization of the Georgian Armed Forces\" [7] Most losses of armaments were sustained after the ceasefire [378]\n\n\nRussia\nThe Russian Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C³I) performed poorly during the conflict [360] The Russian communication systems were outdated, with a 58th Army commander allegedly making contact with his combat troops via a journalist-owned satellite phone [360] Without the modern GLONASS, precision-guided munitions could not be used and the US-controlled GPS was unavailable, since the war zone was blacked out [360] Due to the negligence of Russian defence minister, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles was not sanctioned; [360] an RIA Novosti editorial said that Russian forces were without reliable aerial-reconnaissance systems, once using a Tupolev Tu-22M3 bomber instead [367] However, Russian reconnaissance battalions and regiments were also deployed during the war [368] Deputy chief of the General staff of Russia, General Anatoly Nogovitsyn, said that in the conflict new weapons were not tried out [369]\n\n\nEquipment losses and cost\nAfter the ceasefire agreement Stratfor states that Russia \"has largely destroyed Georgia's war-fighting capability\" [377] After the ceasefire was signed on 12 August, in Georgia proper, Russian troops attempted to seize and destroy Georgian armament, a process termed by the Moscow Defence Brief as the \"demilitarization of the Georgian Armed Forces\" [7] Most losses of armaments were sustained after the ceasefire

claimed it had downed no less than 21 Russian aircraft [359] Moscow Defence Brief provided a higher estimate for air force losses, saying that Russian Air Force total losses during the war were one Tu-22M3 long-range bomber, one Su-24M Fencer fighter-bomber, one Su-24MR Fencer E reconnaissance plane and four Su-25 attack planes [7] Anton Lavrov listed one Su-25SM, two Su-25BM, two Su-24M and one

"**Russo-Georgian War**\n\nThe Russo-Georgian War was a military conflict between Georgia and Russia that took place in August 2008. The war was sparked by a dispute over the status of the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which had been occupied by Russian troops since the early 1990s.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe region where the Georgian language was used to perform Christian rituals for the first time emerged as an ethnic concept in the 10th century AD. After the Mongol invasions of the region, the Kingdom of Georgia was eventually split into several states. In the 19th century, the Russian Empire gradually took over the Georgian lands. In the aftermath of the Russian revolution, Georgia declared independence on 26 May 1918.\n\n**Russian Interests and Involvement**\n\nTranscaucasia lies between the Russian region of the North Caucasus and the Middle East, constituting a \"buffer zone\" between Russia and the Middle East. The region borders Turkey and Iran. The strategic importance of the region has made it a security concern for Russia. Significant economic reasons, including access to major petroleum reserves, further affects interest in Transcaucasia. Rule over Transcaucasia would allow Russia to manage Western involvement in Central Asia, an area of geopolitical importance.\n\n**Unresolved Conflicts**\n\nThe conflicts in Georgia remained at a stalemate until 2004, when Mikheil Saakashvili came to power after Georgia's Rose Revolution, which ousted president Eduard Shevardnadze. Restoring South Ossetia and Abkhazia to Georgian control was a first concern of Saakashvili.\n\n**Relations between Georgia and the West**\n\nOne of President Saakashvili's primary aims for Georgia was to become a member state of NATO, which has been one of the major stumbling blocks in Georgia-Russia relations.\n\n**Prelude**\n\nOn 16 April 2008, official ties between the Russian authorities and the separatists in Abkhazia and South Ossetia were sanctioned by an order of Russian president Vladimir Putin. The separatist-authored legislative documents and the separatist-accredited bodies were also recognised. After a United Nations Security Council session on 23 April convened at Georgia's demand, the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Germany stated in a declaration: \"We call on the Russian Federation to revoke or not to implement its decision.\"\n\n**Hostilities**\n\nAt 8:00 am on 1 August, an improvised explosive device detonated on the road near Tskhinvali near a Georgian police vehicle, wounding five police officers. In response, Georgian snipers fired on South Ossetian positions, killing four Ossetians and wounding seven. According to the majority of reports, the South Ossetians were responsible for instigating the bomb explosion which marked the opening of hostilities.\n\n**Early August**\n\nAt 8:00 am on 1 August, an improvised explosive device detonated on the road near Tskhinvali near a Georgian police vehicle, wounding five police officers. In response, Georgian snipers fired on South Ossetian positions, killing four Ossetians and wounding seven. According to the majority of reports, the South Ossetians were responsible for instigating the bomb explosion which marked the opening of hostilities.\n\n**Battle of Tskhinvali**\n\nGeorgian artillery launched smoke bombs into South Ossetia at 23:35 on 7 August. This was followed by a 15-minute intermission, which purportedly enabled the civilians to escape, before the Georgian forces began bombarding hostile positions. Georgian military intentionally targeted South Ossetian military objects, not civilian ones. Although Georgian military had pledged safety to the Russian peacekeepers for their neutrality, the Russian peacekeepers had to follow the Russian command to attack the Georgian troops.\n\n**Bombing and Occupation of Gori**\n\nGori is an important city in the centre of Georgia, located about 25 km from Tskhinvali. On 9 August, Russia indiscriminately bombed Gori, with targets ranging from a military garrison to several large civilian apartment buildings and a school. The Georgian government reported that the air raid had killed 60 civilians. No less than 5 Georgian cities had been bombed by 9 August.\n\n**Abkhaz Front**\n\nA naval confrontation occurred between Russian and Georgian vessels on 10 August. According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, the Russian fleet sank one Georgian ship after Georgian boats had attacked the Russian Navy ships. The Russian patrol ship Mirazh was probably responsible for the sinking. The Georgian coast was blockaded by vessels of the Russian Black Sea Fleet on 10 August. This was the first activity since 1945 for the Black Sea Fleet, which had probably departed from Sevastopol before full-scale hostilities between Russia and Georgia began.\n\n**Occupation of Poti**\n\nPoti is the crucial seaport of Georgia on the Black Sea and serves as an essential entrance for Transcaucasia and the landlocked Central Asia. Russian aircraft attacked the town of Poti on 8 August, causing a two-day shutdown of the seaport. Russia positioned ships in the vicinity of Poti and other Georgian ports on 10 August. The next day, Georgian and Russian representatives said that Russian troops were in Poti. However, Russia claimed it had only sent a task force for surveying the area. On 13 August, six Georgian watercraft were sunk by Russian troops in Poti.\n\n**Bombing of Tbilisi and Surroundings**\n\nDuring the fighting in South Ossetia, the Russian Air Force repeatedly attacked Tbilisi and its surrounding areas. On 8 August, the Georgian Interior Ministry reported that Vaziani Military Base near the city was hit by two bombs. A Georgian military airstrip in Marneuli was attacked and three persons were killed. The Georgian government vacated their offices on 9 August. Georgian authorities reported on 9 August that Russian air attacks had targeted the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, but missed.\n\n**Media and Cyber War**\n\nThe war was accompanied by a media battle between Russia and Georgia. The Russian military took Russian journalists to the combat zone to report news discrediting Georgia and portraying Russia as the saviour of Russian citizens in the conflict zone. Russia also aired records on TV supporting its actions which had a strong effect on the local populations of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. For the first time, a Russian Armed Forces spokesman was provided by the Russian authorities to give TV interviews about the war.\n\n**Ceasefire Agreement**\n\nOn 12 August, Russian President Medvedev announced the cessation of the \"peace enforcement\" operation in Georgia. Later that day he met French President Nicolas Sarkozy and approved a six-point proposal. The proposal originally had four points, but Russia firmly requested to add two more Georgia requested that the additions be parenthesised; Russia objected and Sarkozy prevailed upon Saakashvili to accept the agreement. According to Sarkozy and Saakashvili, a sixth point in the Sarkozy proposal was removed with Medvedev's consent.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nOn 17 August, Medvedev announced that Russian military would start to pull out of Georgia the following day. Prisoners of war were swapped by the two countries on 19 August. A Georgian official said that although his country swapped five Russian soldiers for fifteen Georgians, among them two non-combatants, Georgia suspected that Russia kept two more Georgians. On 22 August, Russian forces withdrew from Igoeti and the Georgian police proceeded in the direction of Gori.\n\n**Russian Withdrawal**\n\nOn 17 August, Medvedev announced that Russian military would start to pull out of Georgia the following day. Prisoners of war were swapped by the two countries on 19 August. A Georgian official said that although his country swapped five Russian soldiers for fifteen Georgians, among them two non-combatants, Georgia suspected that Russia kept two more Georgians. On 22 August, Russian forces withdrew from Igoeti and the Georgian police proceeded in the direction of Gori.\n\n**Recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia by Russia**\n\nOn 25 August 2008, the Russian parliament passed a motion, with no one voting against. The motion called for the diplomatic recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia by President Medvedev. On 26 August, Medvedev issued orders recognising the two states, saying that recognising the independence of the two entities \"represents the only possibility to save human lives.\"\n\n**Russian Military Presence**\n\nA direct result of the war has been the increased and emboldened Russian military presence in both South Ossetia and Abkhazia. While Russian armed forces were present in both regions before the outbreak of the war, in the capacity of peacekeeping forces since the civil wars in the 1990s, this was limited to 500 servicemen in South Ossetia (JPKF) and 1,600 in Abkhazia (CISPKF), with the latter being expanded to over 2,000 in the months leading to the 2008 war. With these mechanisms becoming obsolete after the 2008 war, the Russian recognition of the independence of both regions was a prerequisite to legitimise the post-war stay of Russian armed forces with the conclusion of \"bilateral\" military cooperation and integration agreements with the newly recognised \"states.\"\n\n**International Monitors**\n\nThe mandate of the OSCE mission in Georgia expired on 1 January 2009, after Russia refused to support its continuation. OSCE monitors had been denied access to South Ossetia since the war. The mandate of the UNOMIG ended on 16 June 2009; its extension was also blocked by Russia, which argued that the mandate did not properly reflect Russia's position on recognition of Abkhazia's independence. According to UN mission head Johan Verbeke, about 60,000 ethnic Georgians in Abkhazia became vulnerable after the mission's end.\n\n**Geopolitical Impact**\n\nThe 2008 war was the first time since the fall of the Soviet Union that the Russian military had been used against an independent state, demonstrating Russia's willingness to use military force to attain its political objectives. Robert Kagan argued that \"Historians will come to view Aug 8, 2008, as a turning point\" because it \"marked the official return of history.\" The failure of the Western security organisations to react swiftly to Russia's attempt to violently revise the borders of an OSCE country revealed its deficiencies. The division between Western European and Eastern European states also became apparent over the relationship with Russia. Ukraine and other ex-Soviet countries received a clear message from the Russian leadership that the possible accession to NATO would cause a foreign incursion and the break-up of the country. Effective takeover of Abkhazia was also one of Russia's geopolitical goals.\n\n**Humanitarian Impact and War Crimes**\n\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) states that all parties to the war seriously breached international laws governing war and caused many fatalities among civilians. HRW reported that no proof of intentional attacks on non-combatants by Georgian troops had been discovered. The South Ossetian parliament and several schools and nurseries were used as military posts by South Ossetian troops and volunteer militias and targeted by Georgian artillery fire. Georgia stated that its strikes only intended to \"neutralize firing positions from where Georgian positions were being targeted.\" HRW documented witness accounts of the usage of civilian objects by South Ossetian fighters. Such usage made civilian objects permissible military aims, and HRW concluded that South Ossetian fighters put non-combatant population at risk by setting up military positions near or in civilian structures. Georgia was responsible for the indiscriminate use of force by using inaccurate weapons to target military targets in civilian areas.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nRussian actions during the war were heavily

reactions\nRussian actions during the war were heavily criticised by several Western countries:\n\n\nThe EU report\nIn November 2008, Georgia called on the EU to conduct an independent inquiry who was to blame for the conflict [329] Heidi Tagliavini, a national of Switzerland (non-EU state), oversaw the making of the EU-sponsored report which was published in September 2009 [330] The report stated that open hostilities started \".. with a large-scale Georgian military operation against the town of Tskhinvali and the surrounding areas, launched in the night of 7 to 8 August 2008\", [331] This conclusion was widely reported on by international media [332] [333] [334] However, the report also noted \".. any explanation of the origins of the conflict cannot focus solely on the artillery attack on Tskhinvali in the night of 7/8 August\", [335] since \".. it was only the culminating point of a long period of increasing tensions, provocations and incidents\", [336] and there was \".. no way to assign overall responsibility for the conflict to one side alone.\" [337] The report said it \"is not in a position\" to consider the Georgian claims of the Russian invasion before 8 August to be substantiated enough, while recognising reports in Russian media which indicated Russian troops and equipment which did not fall under the peacekeeping mandate were already present on the southern side of the Caucasus range, in South Ossetia [338] The report also stated that it could not claim \"veracity or completeness in an absolute sense\", [339] and could not give \"total assurance that there are no mistakes or omissions\" [340]\n\n\nNATO reaction in the Black Sea\nNATO increased its naval presence in the Black Sea significantly following the Russian invasion, with ships dropping anchors in Georgian ports, [343] and according to the US Navy, bringing humanitarian assistance [344] NATO said that its presence in the Black Sea was not related to the Georgian crisis; its vessels were carrying out typical visits and preplanned naval trainings with Romania and Bulgaria [345] Russian General Anatoliy Nogovitsyn recalled the limit on the number of vessels admitted into the Black Sea under the 1936 Montreux convention [346] Russian President Dmitry Medvedev questioned the claim that ships going to Georgia were bringing only humanitarian assistance, alleging the delivery of military material [347] According to political analyst Vladimir Socor, in spite of the limits on vessel's weight and length of visits set by the Montreux Convention, the US kept a continual presence in the Black Sea by alternating vessels from time to time [348]\n\n\nCombatants\nAccording to the Moscow Defence Brief, an English-language magazine published by the Russian non-governmental organisation the Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, the Georgian troops included the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Infantry Brigades, the Artillery Brigade, part of the 1st Infantry Brigade and the standalone Gori Tank Battalion Additionally, special forces and Ministry of Internal Affairs troops were deployed The total number of troops was 16,000 according to the magazine [7] According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, ten light infantry battalions of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th infantry brigades, special forces and an artillery brigade, totalling approximately 12,000 troops, had been concentrated by the start of the conflict [8] The primary task of securing Tskhinvali was accomplished by the 4th Brigade with support from the 2nd and 3rd Brigades [8] According to the EU fact-finding mission, 10,000–11,000 soldiers took part in the war [12]\n\n\nGeorgian order of battle\nAccording to the Moscow Defence Brief, an English-language magazine published by the

one of the foremost military units in Russia, was included in the Russian order of battle [352] It exceeds the Georgian Army in the number of forces, heavy hardware and planes [352] The 58th Army fought in Second Chechen War [353]\n\n\nMilitary analysis\nUnited States officials said that \"one of the few effective elements of the  [Georgia]'s military\" was air defence, with the analysts crediting the SA-11 Buk-1M with shooting down a Tupolev-22M bomber and contributing to the loss of some Su-25s [358] This view was supported by independent Russian analysis [180] Colonel-General Anatoliy Nogovitsyn, Russian deputy chief of general staff, said the Soviet-made Tor and Buk anti-aircraft missile systems, bought by Georgia from Ukraine, were responsible for shooting down Russian aircraft during the war [359] A Russian assessment, reported by Roger McDermott, said that Russian losses would have been significantly higher if the Georgians had not left behind a portion of their Buk-M1 systems near Senaki in western Georgia and several Osa missile launchers in South Ossetia [360] According to some reports, Georgia also possessed a battery of the Israeli-made SPYDER-SR short-range self-propelled anti-aircraft system [361] The Georgian air-defence early-warning and command-control tactical system was linked via Turkey to a NATO Air Situation Data Exchange (ASDE), which provided Georgia with intelligence during the conflict [361]\n\n\nGeorgia\nAfter the ceasefire agreement Stratfor states that Russia \"has largely destroyed Georgia's war-fighting capability\" [377] After the ceasefire was signed on 12 August, in Georgia proper, Russian troops attempted to seize and destroy Georgian armament, a process termed by the Moscow Defence Brief as the \"demilitarization of the Georgian Armed Forces\" [7] Most losses of armaments were sustained after the ceasefire [378]\n\n\nRussia\nThe Russian Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C³I) performed poorly during the conflict [360] The Russian communication systems were outdated, with a 58th Army commander allegedly making contact with his combat troops via a journalist-owned satellite phone [360] Without the modern GLONASS, precision-guided munitions could not be used and the US-controlled GPS was unavailable, since the war zone was blacked out [360] Due to the negligence of Russian defence minister, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles was not sanctioned; [360] an RIA Novosti editorial said that Russian forces were without reliable aerial-reconnaissance systems, once using a Tupolev Tu-22M3 bomber instead [367] However, Russian reconnaissance battalions and regiments were also deployed during the war [368] Deputy chief of the General staff of Russia, General Anatoly Nogovitsyn, said that in the conflict new weapons were not tried out [369]\n\n\nEquipment losses and cost\nAfter the ceasefire agreement Stratfor states that Russia \"has largely destroyed Georgia's war-fighting capability\" [377] After the ceasefire was signed on 12 August, in Georgia proper, Russian troops attempted to seize and destroy Georgian armament, a process termed by the

[378]\n\n\nRussia and South Ossetia\nRussia admitted that three of its Su-25 strike aircraft and one Tu-22 long-range bomber were lost Georgia at that time claimed it had downed no less than 21 Russian aircraft [359] Moscow Defence Brief provided a higher estimate for air force losses, saying that Russian Air Force total losses during the war were one Tu-22M3 long-range bomber, one Su-24M Fencer fighter-bomber, one Su-24MR Fencer E reconnaissance plane and four Su-25 attack planes [7] Anton Lavrov listed one Su-25SM, two Su-25BM, two Su-24M and one Tu-22M3 lost [372] Two helicopters, a

The outbreak produced a large number of tornadoes, damaging winds, and large hail across several states, causing widespread destruction and power outages.\n\n## Meteorological Synopsis\n\nOn March 16, an enhanced risk for severe weather was issued for the northeastern Texas Panhandle, northeastward into south central Kansas, for the possibility of very large hail and tornadoes. Slight and marginal risk areas, however, covered a much larger area, including most of the Southern Plains and eastward into Georgia. A large 5% tornado risk stretched from the eastern Texas Panhandle into western Mississippi. Widespread strong to severe thunderstorms affected areas from Texas and Kansas to Alabama. In southern Mississippi, a cluster of storms brought wind, hail, and tornado damage to Copiah and Simpson Counties. Another cluster of supercells and multi-cell clusters formed in the Texas Panhandle and moved northeastward through western and northern Oklahoma. A tornado was reported on the south side of Hobart, although it was later determined to be a gustnado instead. As the night progressed, a squall line developed in Western Texas and steadily organized as it moved eastward overnight, producing more severe weather.\n\n## Confirmed Tornadoes\n\nMore than 40,000 homes and businesses were without electricity across Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi. Two people were injured when a home was destroyed in Clarke County, Alabama. Four other homes were also destroyed, and some chicken farms were affected. A car crash in Mississippi along U.S. Highway 61 resulted in a non-tornadic fatality.\n\n## March 16 Event\n\nMore than 40,000 homes and businesses were without electricity across Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi. Two people were injured when a home was destroyed in Clarke County, Alabama. Four other homes were also destroyed, and some chicken farms were affected. A car crash in Mississippi along U.S. Highway 61 resulted in a non-tornadic fatality.\n\n## March 17 Event\n\nMore than 40,000 homes and businesses were without electricity across Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi. Two people were injured when a home was destroyed in Clarke County, Alabama. Four other homes were also destroyed, and some chicken farms were affected. A car crash in Mississippi along U.S. Highway 61 resulted in a non-tornadic fatality.\n\n## March 18 Event\n\nMore than 40,000 homes and businesses were without electricity across Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi. Two people were injured when a home was destroyed in Clarke County, Alabama. Four other homes were also destroyed, and some chicken farms were affected. A car crash in Mississippi along U.S. Highway 61 resulted in a non-tornadic fatality.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe Tornado Outbreak of March 16–18, 2021, had a significant impact on the affected areas. More than 40,000 homes and businesses were without electricity, and many people were left without power. Two people were injured, and four homes were destroyed. Several chicken farms were also affected. The outbreak also resulted in a severe blizzard in parts of the Southern Plains, with blizzard warnings issued across most of the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles.\n\n## Southeastern United States\n\nThe Tornado Outbreak of March 16–18, 2021, affected several states in the Southeastern United States, including Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi. More than 40,000 homes and businesses were without electricity, and many people were left without power. Two people were injured, and four homes were destroyed.\n\n## Southern Plains\n\nThe Tornado Outbreak of March 16–18, 2021, also affected parts of the Southern Plains, including Texas and Oklahoma. A severe blizzard was reported in the area, with blizzard warnings issued across most of the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles. The blizzard resulted in zero visibility in much of the area and caused numerous crashes on major roadways. Several highways, including I-40 and US-287, had to be closed.\n\n## See Also\n\n* List of tornado outbreaks in the United States\n* List of tornadoes in the United States by state\n* List of blizzards in the United States\n\n## Notes\n\nThe Tornado Outbreak of March 16–18, 2021, was a significant severe weather event that affected several states in the Southern United States.

called the pet cemetery, as it had been used to bury their cats and dogs [147] As the property was being searched, Chad phoned Lori in jail to warn her about the situation After police found and began

reprise their roles The story follows on from Terminator, depicting a new villain (T-1000), with shape-shifting abilities who hunts for Sarah Connor's son, John (Edward Furlong) Cameron cast Robert Patrick as T-1000 because of his lean and thin appearance — a sharp contrast to Schwarzenegger Cameron explained: \"I wanted someone who was extremely fast and agile If the T-800 is a human Panzer tank, then the T-1000 is a Porsche\" [34] Terminator 2 was one of the most expensive films to be produced, costing at least $94 million [35] ($210 million in 2023 [36]) Despite the challenging use of computer-generated imagery (CGI), the film was completed on time and released on July 3, 1991 Terminator 2 broke box office records (including the opening weekend record for an R-rated film), earning

expedition which turns deadly Although receiving mixed reviews, the film earned a fair $108 million at the worldwide box office [82] Cameron re-investigated the sinking of RMS Titanic with eight

five times [137] He was married to Sharon Williams from 1978 to 1984 A year after he and Williams divorced, Cameron married film producer Gale Anne Hurd, a close collaborator for his 1980s films They

after two years of marriage, with Hamilton receiving a settlement of $50 million [138] [139] [140] He married Amis, his fifth wife, in 2000 They have one son and two daughters together [141]\n\n\nFilmmaking style\nCameron's films are often based on themes which explore the conflicts between intelligent machines and humanity or nature, [162] [163] dangers of corporate greed, [164] strong female characters, and a romance subplot [165] Cameron has further stated in an interview with The Talks, \"All my movies are love stories\" [166] Both Titanic and Avatar are noted for featuring star-crossed lovers [167] Characters suffering from emotionally intense and dramatic environments in the sea wilderness are explored in The Abyss and Titanic The Terminator series amplifies

evil\" [168] [169] A danger for nuclear war, as featured in The Terminator, Terminator 2: Judgement Day and in his forthcoming Last Train From Hiroshima film, has been one of Cameron's fears since he watched the Cuban Missile Crisis unfold when he was eight years old [114]\n\n\nThemes\nCameron's films are often based on themes which explore the conflicts between intelligent machines and humanity

He is the son of the late Bal Thackeray, a prominent figure in Maharashtra politics. Thackeray has been involved in politics since the early 2000s and has held various positions within the Shiv Sena party.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nUddhav Thackeray was born on 27 July 1960 to Bal Thackeray and his wife Meena Thackeray. He is the youngest of the couple's three sons. Thackeray's early education took place at Balmohan Vidyamandir, a school in Mumbai. He later graduated from the Sir J.J Institute of Applied Art, where he focused on photography as his main subject.\n\n**Political Career**\n\nThackeray's entry into politics began in 2002, when he was appointed as the campaign incharge of the Shiv Sena party for the Brihan Mumbai Municipal Corporation elections. The party performed well in the elections, marking a significant milestone in Thackeray's political career. In 2003, he was appointed as the working president of the Shiv Sena party. Thackeray took over as the chief editor of Saamana, a daily Marathi-language newspaper published by the Shiv Sena party, in 2006. He held this position until 2019.\n\n**Chief Minister of Maharashtra**\n\nThackeray's rise to prominence began in 2012, when he took over as the leader of the Shiv Sena party following the death of his father, Bal Thackeray. However, his leadership of the party was soon challenged by Eknath Shinde, a key member of the party. The dispute led to a leadership crisis within the party, which culminated in the Election Commission of India recognizing Shinde's faction as the legitimate Shiv Sena party.\n\nIn 2019, Thackeray took the oath as the 18th Chief Minister of Maharashtra after being elected as the president of the Maha Vikas Aghadi coalition. The coalition was formed after a brief political crisis that saw the Shiv Sena party break away from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Thackeray's tenure as Chief Minister was marked by significant challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic and a severe drought in Maharashtra.\n\n**Loss of Control over Shiv Sena Party**\n\nThackeray's leadership of the Shiv Sena party was challenged by Eknath Shinde, who established a new government in Maharashtra in 2022. Shinde began using the Shiv Sena name and symbols without Thackeray's faction, leading to a leadership dispute within the party. Despite challenging this in court and before the Election Commission of India, Thackeray's faction was ultimately unsuccessful in its bid to maintain control over the party.\n\n**Change in Bylaws**\n\nIn 2018, Thackeray oversaw changes to the Shiv Sena party constitution that were criticized for centralizing control of the party and not allowing for free, fair, and transparent elections for party positions. The Election Commission of India deemed these amendments undemocratic, further eroding Thackeray's control over the party.\n\n**Eknath Shinde's Challenge and Takeover**\n\nThackeray faced a significant challenge to his leadership when Eknath Shinde, a key member of the party, called for breaking the Maha Vikas Aghadi alliance and re-establishing an alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party. Despite gathering support from two-thirds of his party members, Thackeray ignored their requests, leading to a political crisis that resulted in his resignation as Chief Minister of Maharashtra.\n\nThrough a legal battle, Shinde claimed that he had the support of the majority of Shiv Sena members, and the Election Commission of India recognized his faction as the legitimate Shiv Sena party, effectively granting him control over the party.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nThackeray has always had a keen interest in photography and has exhibited his collection of aerial shots of various forts of Maharashtra at the Jehangir Art Gallery in 2004.

[25]\n\n\nFeatures\nTo start using Telegram, a user must sign-up with their phone number or an anonymous +888 number purchased from the Fragment blockchain platform [59] [60] Changing the phone number in the app will automatically reassign the user's account to that number without the need to export data or notify their contacts [59] [61] [62] Phone numbers are hidden by default with only a user's contacts being able to see them Sign-ups can only be done via an Android or iOS device [63] [64]\n\n\nMessaging\nTo start using Telegram, a user must sign-up with their phone number or an anonymous

[64]\n\n\nGroups and channels\nTelegram users can create and join groups and channels Groups are large multi-user chats that support up to 200,000 members and can be public or private Users can freely join public chats and find them using the in-app search function, while private chats require an invitation They support flexible admin rights and can use bots for moderation to prevent spam and unwanted activity Groups can be split into topics, effectively creating subgroups dedicated to various subjects with separate settings for each [89]\n\n\nGames\nTelegram also provides an open API for the creation of custom bots which can perform various tasks, integrate other services into Telegram chats, or work as mini apps or games [109] Most of them work on the 8XR game engine [110] [111]\n\n\nVideo and voice calls\nSince 2017, Telegram users have been able to initiate one-on-one calls in private chats Calls are end-to-end encrypted and prioritize peer-to-peer connections Video calls were introduced in August 2020 [112] [113] According to Telegram, there is a neural network working to learn various technical parameters about a call to provide better quality of service for future uses [114]\n\n\nPrivacy and security features\nBy default, logging into Telegram requires either an SMS message sent to the registered number or a code message sent to one of the active sessions on another device Users have the option to set a two-step verification password and add a recovery email [123] In late 2022, options to Sign in with Apple and Sign In with Google or with an email address were added [124] Whenever a new device successfully logs in to a user's account, a special service notification is sent and a login alert is displayed in the chat list of their other devices [125]\n\n\nData and storage settings\nTelegram clients have the ability to turn off media autoplay and automatic downloads for both WiFi and mobile data, adjusting them for media type and size Auto download settings can also be applied based on chat type such as group, channel or private.\n\n\nBots\nIn June 2015, Telegram launched a platform for third-party developers to create bots [131] Bots are Telegram accounts operated by programs They can respond to messages or mentions directly or can be invited into groups, and are able to perform tasks, integrate with other programs and host mini apps [132] [133] Bots can accept online payments made with credit cards or Apple Pay [134] The Dutch website Tweakers reported that an invited bot can potentially read all group messages, when the bot controller changes the access settings silently at a later point in time Telegram pointed out that it considered implementing a feature that would announce such a status change within the relevant group [135]\n\n\nStickers, emoji, reactions and effects\nTelegram has more than 20,000 stickers Stickers are cloud-based, high-resolution images intended to provide more expressive emoji When typing in an emoji, the user is offered to send the respective sticker instead Stickers come in collections called \"packs\", and multiple stickers can be offered for one emoji Telegram comes with one default sticker pack, [145] and users can install additional sticker packs provided by third-party contributors.\n\n\nPeople Nearby and Groups Nearby\nPeople Nearby can help users meet new friends by turning on phone GPS location and opting-in contacts and through Groups Nearby people can create a local group by adding location data to groups [154] [155]\n\n\nStories\nSimilar to other social platforms, Telegram users can post stories, a type of short-form content Telegram stories have several distinctive features, like a dual-camera mode, extra privacy settings, the ability to edit stories after posting them, as well as to rewind and fast-forward them while watching [157] [158] [159]\n\n\nPremium features\nTelegram Premium was launched on 19 June 2022 with regional pricing [54] [55] The optional paid subscription gives users increased limits in the app, such as larger file uploads, faster download speeds, unlimited voice message transcription, [160] as well as numerous other increases such as the number of pinned chats and folders Premium users have access to extra stickers, emoji, reactions, and customization features like a special badge and the ability to change the look of their messages in chats Premium users get access to additional settings, like instant chat translation, and the ability to restrict who can send them voice messages [161] [162]\n\n\nRelated platforms\nPeople can use their Telegram accounts to author articles on Telegraph – a minimalistic text editor and publisher While articles on Telegraph can be published anonymously, tying them to one's account allows one to check their view count and edit them later Telegraph natively supports Instant View, a feature which lets users read full articles in the chat with no load time and without opening an external browser [165] [166] [167]\n\n\nArchitecture\nFor encrypted chats (branded as Secret Chats), Telegram uses a custom-built symmetric encryption scheme called MTProto The protocol was developed by Nikolai Durov and other developers at Telegram and, as of version 2.0, is based on 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption and Diffie–Hellman key exchange [79] [176]\n\n\nPrivacy\nFor encrypted chats (branded as Secret Chats), Telegram uses a custom-built symmetric encryption scheme called MTProto The protocol was developed by Nikolai Durov and other

messaging protocols, Telegram uses centralized servers Telegram Messenger LLP has servers in a number of countries throughout the world to improve the response time of their service [178] Telegram's server-side software is closed-source and proprietary [8] Pavel Durov said that it would require a major architectural redesign of the server-side software to connect independent servers to the Telegram cloud [179]\n\n\nClients\nTelegram has various client apps, some developed by Telegram Messenger LLP and some by the community Most of them are free and open-source and released under the GNU General Public Licence version 2 or 3 The official clients support sending any file format extensions The built-in media viewer supports common media formats – JPEG, PNG, WebP for images and H.264 and HEVC in videos in MP4 container and MP3, FLAC, Vorbis, Opus and AAC for audio.\n\n\nAPIs\nTelegram has public APIs with which developers can access the same functionality as Telegram's official apps to build their own instant messaging applications [202] In February 2015, creators of the unofficial WhatsApp+ client released the Telegram Plus app, later renamed to Plus Messenger, after their original project got a cease-and-desist order from WhatsApp [203] [204] In September 2015, Samsung released a messaging application based on these APIs [205]\n\n\nBusiness\nThe company was initially supported by founding CEO Pavel Durov's personal funds after the sale of his stake in VK In January 2018, it launched a private placement and collected $1.7 billion from investors such as Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia Capital, and Benchmark [210] After the shutdown of the TON project, the company needed to repay the investors the money that was not spent on its development during 2018 and the beginning of 2019, while the project was active [211]\n\n\nAdvertising and monetization\nTelegram has stated that the company will never serve advertisements in private chats [217] In late 2020, Durov announced that the company was working on its own ad platform, and would integrate non-targeted ads in public one-to-many channels, that already were selling and displaying ads in the form of regular messages [218] Ads from Telegram's \"Sponsored Messages\" platform began to appear in channels with more than 1000 followers in October 2021.\n\n\nPay per view bots\nIn 2022, Telegram canceled a bot monetization upgrade program, because Apple demanded a cut [220]\n\n\nTON Telegram Open Network\nIn 2017, in an attempt to monetize Telegram without advertising, the company began the development of a blockchain platform dubbed either \"The Open Network\" or \"Telegram Open Network\" (TON) and its native cryptocurrency \"Gram\" The project was announced in mid-December 2017 [221] and its 132-page technical paper became available in January 2018 [222] The codebase behind TON was developed by Pavel Durov's brother Nikolai Durov, the core developer of Telegram's MTProto protocol [223] In January 2018 a 23-page white paper [222] and a detailed 132-page technical paper [222] for TON blockchain became available [224]\n\n\nCriticism\nDue to Telegram's mixed nature as both a private communication method and a social media-like platform with mass groups and channels, along with its minimal restrictions on content with only calls to violence, illegal forms of pornography [244] and scamming forbidden, the platform has been used by organizations and large groups for recruitment and spreading of their agenda Organized use of the app has been linked to pro-democracy protests in Belarus, [245] Russia, [246] Hong Kong [247] and Iran, [248] as well as to the dissemination of state propaganda and violent rhetoric in oppressive regimes, the promotion of extremist views, and the digitalization of services provided by government entities and private businesses [249] [250] [251] [252] [253] [254]\n\n\nUse by militant groups\nIn September 2015, in response to a question about the use of Telegram by Islamic State (ISIS), Pavel Durov stated: \"I think that privacy, ultimately, and our right for privacy is more important than our fear of bad things happening, like terrorism.\" [261] Durov sarcastically suggested to ban words because terrorists use them for communication [262]\n\n\nIllegal pornography\nTelegram has been used to distribute illegal pornography, including child pornography [283] [284] Telegram's internal reporting system has an option to report content that contains child abuse, including specific messages in groups and channels The company has a verified channel called \"Stop Child Abuse\", where daily statistics on the number of groups and channels banned for sharing illegal materials are posted It also provides an email address dedicated to reports of content related to child abuse [285] [286]\n\n\nBot abuse\nIn 2021, a bot was found selling leaked phone numbers from Facebook [294]\n\n\nFraudulent jobs\nTelegram has received criticism for its failure to curb fraud on the platform The most common mode of fraud involves scammers sending messages to unsuspecting users, offering part-time online jobs which comprise a series of tasks Scammers employ a variety of confidence tricks to entice users into completing \"prepaid tasks\" in which users deposit money into scammers' accounts with the expectation of receiving high returns [299] [300]\n\n\nCopyright infringement\nIn March 2024, a judge of Spain's Audiencia Nacional ordered the temporary blocking of Telegram in Spain The order came following a complaint from media organizations —Mediaset, Atresmedia and Movistar Plus+— saying that the app allowed users to share copyrighted content without their consent [304] [305] A few days later, following repeated criticism, the same judge suspended his order until the police issue a report on the consequences that this measure would have for users [306] Finally, the judge annulled the order, considering it \"disproportionate.\" [307]\n\n\nDrug trade\nIn recent years, Telegram has become more popular for the purpose of buying and selling illicit drugs In 2024, Sociology Compass released a paper exploring this trend in drug trade [308]\n\n\nUser numbers\nIn August 2024, an EU probe was launched into Telegram to determine whether the platform breached EU digital rules by failing to provide accurate user numbers [309] Telegram said in February  2024 that it had 41mn users in the EU Under the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA), Telegram was supposed to provide an updated number in August but failed to do so, only declaring it had “significantly fewer than 45mn average monthly active recipients in the EU” [310]\n\n\nReception\nChannels have been used by celebrities such as Arnold Schwarzenegger [311] and politicians: President of France Emmanuel Macron, [312] former President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro, [313] Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, [314] President of Moldova Maia Sandu, [315] President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy, [106] former Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, [316] former Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, [317] former US President Donald Trump, President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev, former Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others.\n\n\nSecurity\nTelegram's security model has received notable criticism by cryptography experts They criticized how, unless modified first, the default general security model stores all contacts, messages and media together with their decryption keys on its servers continuously; and that it does not enable end-to-end encryption for messages by default [318] [319] Pavel Durov has argued that this is because it helps to avoid third-party unsecured backups, and to allow users to access messages and files from any device Criticisms were also aimed at Telegram's use of a custom-designed encryption protocol [318] [320] [321] [322]\n\n\nCryptography contests\nTelegram has organized two cryptography contests to challenge its own security Third parties were asked to break the service's cryptography and disclose the information contained within a secret chat between two computer-controlled users A reward of respectively US$200,000 and US$300,000 was offered Both of these contests expired with no winners [366] [367]\n\n\nCensorship\nTelegram has been blocked temporarily or permanently by some governments including Iran, China, Brazil, and Pakistan The Russian government blocked Telegram for several years before lifting the ban in 2020 [371] [372] [373] The company's founder has said he wants the app to have an anti-censorship tool for Iran and China similar to the app's role in fighting censorship in Russia [374] On April 19, 2024, Apple removed Telegram from the App Store in China [375]\n\n\n2019 Puerto Rico \"Telegramgate\"\nTelegram was the main subject surrounding the 2019 Puerto Rico riots that ended up in the resignation of then-Governor Ricardo Rosselló Hundreds of pages of a group chat between Rosselló and members of his staff were leaked The messages were considered vulgar, racist, and homophobic, with members of the chat discussing how they would use the media to target potential political opponents [377]\n\n\n2021 shutdown of Russian political bots\nIn September 2021, prior to the regional elections in Russia, Telegram suspended several bots spreading information about the election, including a bot run by the opposition party and critics of incumbent president Vladimir Putin's government, [378] [379] citing election silence as the reason, though a blog post by the company's CEO implied the company was following Apple and Google, which \"dictate the rules of the game to developers\" [380] [378] The blocking of the main Smart Voting bot was criticized by allies of Alexei Navalny, a Kremlin critic and former opposition leader Navalny's spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh called the block and the deletion of the tactical voting app from app stores \"censorship  [...] imposed by private companies\" [381]\n\n\n2022 Delhi High Court ruling\nOn November 24, 2022, Telegram disclosed the admin names, phone numbers and IP addresses of channels accused of unauthorised sharing of national exam study materials following an order by the Delhi High Court which rejected Telegram's argument that its regional servers were located in Singapore and thus no data could be disclosed as the local laws prohibit it [383] [384]\n\n\n2024 Arrest of Pavel Durov\nOn August 24, 2024, Pavel Durov, who is both a French and UAE citizen, was arrested in France by French authorities and four days later charged with a wide array of crimes, including complicity in managing an online platform to enable illegal transactions; complicity in crimes such as enabling the distribution of child sexual abuse material; drug trafficking and fraud; and a refusal to cooperate with law enforcement authorities Durov posted bail of five million Euros, was barred from leaving France, and was released on condition he report to a French police station twice weekly The case would be handled by a special magistrate with investigative and prosecutorial powers [385]\n\n\nSee also\nTelegram on Telegram \n\n\nReferences\nTelegram on Telegram \n\n\nSources\nTelegram on Telegram

The protocol was developed by Nikolai Durov and other developers at Telegram and, as of version 2.0, is based on 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman key exchange.\n\n**Servers**\n\nAs with most instant messaging protocols, Telegram uses centralized servers. Telegram Messenger LLP has servers in a number of countries throughout the world to improve the response time of their service. Telegram's server-side software is closed-source and proprietary. Pavel Durov said that it would require a major architectural redesign of the server-side software to connect independent servers to the Telegram cloud.\n\n**Clients**\n\nTelegram has various client apps, some developed by Telegram Messenger LLP, and some by the community. Most of them are free and open-source and released under the GNU General Public License version 2 or 3. The official clients support sending any file format extensions. The built-in media viewer supports common media formats – JPEG, PNG, WebP for images and H.264 and HEVC in videos in MP4 container and MP3, FLAC, Vorbis, Opus, and AAC for audio.\n\n**APIs**\n\nTelegram has public APIs with which developers can access the same functionality as Telegram's official apps to build their own instant messaging applications. In February 2015, creators of the unofficial WhatsApp+ client released the Telegram Plus app, later renamed to Plus Messenger, after their original project got a cease-and-desist order from WhatsApp. In September 2015, Samsung released a messaging application based on these APIs.\n\n**Business**\n\nThe company was initially supported by founding CEO Pavel Durov's personal funds after the sale of his stake in VK. In January 2018, it launched a private placement and collected $1.7 billion from investors such as Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia Capital, and Benchmark. After the shutdown of the TON project, the company needed to repay the investors the money that was not spent on its development during 2018 and the beginning of 2019, while the project was active.\n\n**Advertising and Monetization**\n\nTelegram has stated that the company will never serve advertisements in private chats. In late 2020, Durov announced that the company was working on its own ad platform, and would integrate non-targeted ads in public one-to-many channels, that already were selling and displaying ads in the form of regular messages. Ads from Telegram's \"Sponsored Messages\" platform began to appear in channels with more than 1,000 followers in October 2021.\n\n**Pay per View Bots**\n\nIn 2022, Telegram canceled a bot monetization upgrade program, because Apple demanded a cut.\n\n**TON (Telegram Open Network)**\n\nIn 2017, in an attempt to monetize Telegram without advertising, the company began the development of a blockchain platform dubbed either \"The Open Network\" or \"Telegram Open Network\" (TON) and its native cryptocurrency \"Gram\". The project was announced in mid-December 2017, and its 132-page technical paper became available in January 2018. The codebase behind TON was developed by Pavel Durov's brother Nikolai Durov, the core developer of Telegram's MTProto protocol. In January 2018, a 23-page white paper and a detailed 132-page technical paper for TON blockchain became available.\n\n**Censorship**\n\nTelegram has been blocked temporarily or permanently by some governments, including Iran, China, Brazil, and Pakistan. The Russian government blocked Telegram for several years before lifting the ban in 2020. The company's founder has said he wants the app to have an anti-censorship tool for Iran and China similar to the app's role in fighting censorship in Russia. On April 19, 2024, Apple removed Telegram from the App Store in China.\n\n**2019 Puerto Rico \"Telegramgate\"**\n\nTelegram was the main subject surrounding the 2019 Puerto Rico riots that ended up in the resignation of then-Governor Ricardo Rosselló. Hundreds of pages of a group chat between Rosselló and members of his staff were leaked. The messages were considered vulgar, racist, and homophobic, with members of the chat discussing how they would use the media to target potential political opponents.\n\n**2021 Shutdown of Russian Political Bots**\n\nIn September 2021, prior to the regional elections in Russia, Telegram suspended several bots spreading information about the election, including a bot run by the opposition party and critics of incumbent president Vladimir Putin's government. Citing election silence as the reason, though a blog post by the company's CEO implied the company was following Apple and Google, which \"dictate the rules of the game to developers.\" The blocking of the main Smart Voting bot was criticized by allies of Alexei Navalny, a Kremlin critic and former opposition leader. Navalny's spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh called the block and the deletion of the tactical voting app from app stores \"censorship [...] imposed by private companies.\"\n\n**2022 Delhi High Court Ruling**\n\nOn November 24, 2022, Telegram disclosed the admin names, phone numbers, and IP addresses of channels accused of unauthorized sharing of national exam study materials following an order by the Delhi High Court, which rejected Telegram's argument that its regional servers were located in Singapore and thus no data could be disclosed, as the local laws prohibit it.\n\n**2024 Arrest of Pavel Durov**\n\nOn August 24, 2024, Pavel Durov, who is both a French and UAE citizen, was arrested in France by French authorities and four days later charged with a wide array of crimes, including complicity in managing an online platform to enable illegal transactions; complicity in crimes such as enabling the distribution of child sexual abuse material; drug trafficking and fraud; and a refusal to cooperate with law enforcement authorities. Durov posted bail of five million Euros, was barred from leaving France, and was released on condition he report to a French police station twice weekly.

2018 a 23-page white paper [222] and a detailed 132-page technical paper [222] for TON blockchain became available [224]\n\n\nCriticism\nDue to Telegram's mixed nature as both a private communication method and a social media-like platform with mass groups and channels, along with its minimal restrictions on content with only calls to violence, illegal forms of pornography [244] and scamming forbidden, the platform has been used by organizations and large groups for recruitment and spreading of their agenda Organized use of the app has been linked to pro-democracy protests in Belarus, [245] Russia, [246] Hong Kong [247] and Iran, [248] as well as to the dissemination of state propaganda and violent rhetoric in oppressive regimes, the promotion of extremist views, and the digitalization of services provided by government entities and private businesses [249] [250] [251] [252] [253] [254]\n\n\nUse by militant groups\nIn September 2015, in response to a question about the use of Telegram by Islamic State (ISIS), Pavel Durov stated: \"I think that privacy, ultimately, and our right for privacy is more important than our fear of bad things happening, like terrorism.\" [261] Durov sarcastically suggested to ban words because terrorists use them for communication [262]\n\n\nIllegal pornography\nTelegram has been used to distribute illegal pornography,

criticism for its failure to curb fraud on the platform The most common mode of fraud involves scammers sending messages to unsuspecting users, offering part-time online jobs which comprise a series of tasks Scammers employ a variety of confidence tricks to entice users into completing \"prepaid tasks\" in which users deposit money into scammers' accounts with the expectation of receiving high returns [299] [300]\n\n\nCopyright infringement\nIn March 2024, a judge of Spain's Audiencia Nacional ordered the temporary blocking of Telegram in Spain The order came following a complaint from media organizations —Mediaset, Atresmedia and Movistar Plus+— saying that the app allowed users to share copyrighted content without their consent [304] [305] A few days later, following repeated criticism, the same judge suspended his order until the police issue a report on the consequences that this measure would have for users [306] Finally, the judge annulled the order, considering it \"disproportionate.\" [307]\n\n\nDrug trade\nIn recent years, Telegram has become more popular for the purpose of buying and selling illicit drugs In 2024, Sociology Compass released a paper exploring this trend in drug trade [308]\n\n\nUser numbers\nIn August 2024, an EU probe was launched into Telegram to determine whether the platform breached EU digital rules by failing to provide accurate user

President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev, former Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others.\n\n\nSecurity\nTelegram's security model has received notable criticism by cryptography experts They criticized how, unless modified first, the default general security model stores all contacts, messages and media together with their decryption keys on its servers continuously; and that it does not enable end-to-end encryption for messages by default [318] [319] Pavel Durov has argued that this is because it helps to avoid third-party unsecured backups, and to allow users to access messages and files from any device Criticisms were also aimed at Telegram's use of a custom-designed encryption protocol [318] [320] [321] [322]\n\n\nCryptography contests\nTelegram has organized two cryptography contests to challenge its own security Third parties were asked to break the service's cryptography and disclose the information contained within a secret chat between two computer-controlled users A reward of respectively US$200,000 and US$300,000 was offered Both of these contests expired with no winners [366]

He is known for his distinctive voice, tough-guy persona, and extensive filmography in the action, crime, and comedy genres. Born on May 16, 1944, in Maywood, California, Trejo has become a household name, particularly among children, thanks to his iconic role as Isador \"Machete\" Cortez in the Spy Kids franchise.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nDanny Trejo was born on May 16, 1944, in Maywood, California. He was raised on Temple Street in the Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, the son of Mexican-American parents. His mother, Delores Rivera King, and father, Dionisio \"Dan\" Trejo, were not married at the time of his birth, as his father was away fighting in World War II. Trejo's parents met at a dance hall in Highland Park, Los Angeles in 1943.\n\nTrejo's early life was marked by poverty and instability. He had a maternal half-sister, Dyhan, but saw neither her nor his mother from 1949 until 1965, as his father banned his mother from seeing him after Trejo sprained his arm in her care. This period of separation had a profound impact on Trejo's life, and he has spoken publicly about the difficulties he faced growing up without a stable family environment.\n\n**Life of Crime and Incarceration**\n\nTrejo's early life was marked by a series of run-ins with the law.

However, Montolivo's eventual recovery combined with the arrival of Lucas Biglia and frequent changes of formation under Vincenzo Montella started to limit his playing time. In November 2017, Montella was dismissed and replaced by Gennaro Gattuso, who also viewed Locatelli as more of a backup for either Biglia or Montolivo than a starting lineup player. He finished the season with only 15 starts (of which only 5 were in Serie A) and 18 sub-ins.\n\nSassuolo\n\nIn the summer of 2018, Milan loaned in Tiémoué Bakayoko and suggested that Locatelli join one of the lower-ranking Serie A teams on loan, preferably without a buy-out option. Locatelli agreed to depart yet submitted a full transfer request, later citing a perceived lack of trust in him from the club as the main reason for his decision. On 13 August 2018, Locatelli transferred to Sassuolo on loan with an obligation to buy. In his debut season for the neroverdi, he made 31 appearances and scored 3 goals (against Catania in Coppa Italia and Cagliari and Chievo Verona in Serie A).\n\nJuventus\n\nOn 18 August 2021, Juventus announced the signing of Locatelli on an initial two-year loan, with Juventus holding an obligation to then purchase the player for €25 million payable over three years plus €12.5 million in potential add-ons. At Juventus, Locatelli reunited with Massimiliano Allegri, who had once been the head coach of Milan and called up Locatelli to train with the senior team in 2013 aged 15.\n\nInternational Career\n\nLocatelli was part of the Italy U17 team at the 2015 UEFA European Under-17 Championship. He also took part in the 2016 Under-19 Championship with the under-19 side, as Italy finished runners-up.\n\nYouth\n\nLocatelli was part of the Italy U17 team at the 2015 UEFA European Under-17 Championship. He also took part in the 2016 Under-19 Championship with the under-19 side, as Italy finished runners-up.\n\nSenior\n\nLocatelli debuted with the Italian senior squad on 7 September 2020, playing as a starter in a 1–0 UEFA Nations League victory against the Netherlands in Amsterdam. On 28 March 2021, Locatelli scored his first goal for Italy, the second of a 2–0 away victory over Bulgaria in a 2022 World Cup qualification match.\n\nStyle of Play\n\nLocatelli is primarily deployed as a deep-lying midfielder, usually operating in a defensive role in front of the team's defence, in a position similar to that of his idol Andrea Pirlo, due to his ability to create chances or dictate the tempo of his team's play in midfield with his passing range. A versatile midfielder, he can also play in a box-to-box role, or as a mezzala in a 4–3–3 formation, although this is not his preferred position; he has occasionally even been used as an attacking midfielder, a position in which he was initially fielded in his youth, before being moved into a deeper midfield role.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nOn 21 June 2022, he married Thessa Lachovic. On 16 October, his wife announced that she was pregnant.\n\nCareer Statistics\n\nAs of match played 16 October 2022\n\nAC Milan\n\nClub\n\nSeason Apps Goals Assists\n2015–16 3 0 1\n2016–17 29 1 4\n2017–18 21 0 2\n2018–19 6 0 0\n2019–20 10 1 0\n2020–21 1 0 0\nTotal 70 2 7\n\nInternational\n\nYear Apps Goals Assists\n2020 7 0 0\n2021 10 1 0\n2022 9 0 0\nTotal 26 1 0\n\nHonours\n\nAs of match played 16 October 2022\n\nAC Milan\n\n* Serie A: 2016–17\n* Supercoppa Italiana: 2016", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Manuel_Locatelli\" following this outline:\n\n\nClub career\nLocatelli began his career with Atalanta, before moving to AC Milan at the age of 11 years [3] [4] With the Rossoneri he progressed through each youth category, from Esordienti to Primavera In March 2015, Locatelli signed his first professional contract with Milan, effective from 1 July 2015 until 30 June 2018 [5] [6] [7] [8]\n\n\nEarly career\nLocatelli began his career with Atalanta, before moving to AC Milan at the age of 11 years [3] [4] With the Rossoneri he progressed through each youth category, from Esordienti to Primavera In March 2015, Locatelli signed his first professional contract with Milan, effective from 1 July 2015 until 30 June 2018 [5] [6] [7] [8]\n\n\nAC Milan\nLocatelli received his first ever call-up to Milan's senior team ahead of the away game against Udinese played on 22 September 2015;

The house has a long and complex history, dating back to the early 18th century, and its members have played a significant role in shaping the course of British and world history.\n\n**History**\n\nIn 1701, succession to the throne was given to Sophia of Hanover, who was born into the House of Wittelsbach, married into the House of Hanover, and was a granddaughter of James VI and I of the House of Stuart. This marked the beginning of a long ruling period by the Hanoverian royal house, which would last for over a century. However, in 1901, a line of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha succeeded the House of Hanover to the British monarchy with the accession of King Edward VII, son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. This change in the royal house was a significant turning point in British history, marking the end of the Hanoverian dynasty and the beginning of a new era for the British monarchy.\n\nIn 1917, the name of the British royal house was changed from the German Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to the English Windsor, taking its name from the royal residence in Berkshire. This change was made due to the controversy surrounding the royal family's German heritage during World War I. The name change was seen as a way to distance the royal family from its German roots and to emphasize its British identity.\n\n**List of Monarchs**\n\nThe 1917 proclamation stated that the name of the Royal House and all British descendants of Victoria and Albert in the male line were to bear the name of Windsor, except for women who married into other families. This meant that the monarchs of the House of Windsor would be the descendants of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, who had been members of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n\nSince the name change in 1917, the monarchs of the House of Windsor have been:\n\n* King George V (1910-1936)\n* King Edward VIII (1936)\n* King George VI (1936-1952)\n* Queen Elizabeth II (1952-2022)\n* King Charles III (2022-present)\n\n**Members**\n\nThe 1917 proclamation stated that the name of the Royal House and all British descendants of Victoria and Albert in the male line were to bear the name of Windsor, except for women who married into other families. This means that the members of the House of Windsor are the descendants of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, who have been members of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n\nSome notable members of the House of Windsor include:\n\n* Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (born Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark), husband of Queen Elizabeth II\n* Charles, Prince of Wales (born Charles Philip Arthur George), son of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip\n* Prince William, Duke of Cambridge (born William Arthur Philip Louis), grandson of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip\n* Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex (born Henry Charles Albert David), grandson of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip\n\n**Descendants of Elizabeth II**\n\nIn 1947, Princess Elizabeth (who would become Queen Elizabeth II), heir presumptive to King George VI, married Philip Mountbatten (born Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark), a member of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, a branch of the House of Oldenburg. A few months before his marriage, Philip abandoned his princely titles and adopted the surname Mountbatten, which was that of his maternal uncle and mentor, the Earl Mountbatten of Burma, and had itself been adopted by Lord Mountbatten's father (Philip's maternal grandfather), Prince Louis of Battenberg, in 1917. It is the literal translation of the German Battenberg, which refers to Battenberg, a small town in Hesse.\n\nThe descendants of Queen Elizabeth II include her children and grandchildren, who are all members of the House of Windsor. They are:\n\n* Charles, Prince of Wales (born Charles Philip Arthur George), son of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip\n* Anne, Princess Royal (born Anne Elizabeth Alice Louise), daughter of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip\n* Prince Andrew, Duke of York (born Andrew Albert Christian Edward), son of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip\n* Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex (born Edward Antony Richard Louis), son of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip\n* Prince William, Duke of Cambridge (born William Arthur Philip Louis), grandson of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip\n* Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex (born Henry Charles Albert David), grandson of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip\n* Peter Phillips (born Peter Mark Andrew Phillips), grandson of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip\n* Zara Tindall (born Anne Elizabeth Jane Tindall), granddaughter of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip\n\n**Family Tree**\n\nAt the creation of the House of Windsor, its head reigned over the British Empire. Following the end of the First World War, however, shifts took place that saw the emergence of the Dominions of the British Commonwealth as independent states. The shift was recognised in the Balfour Declaration of 1926, the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927, and the Statute of Westminster 1931. The Windsors became recognised as the royal family of multiple independent countries, a number that shifted over the decades, as some Dominions became republics and Crown colonies became realms, republics, or monarchies under a different sovereign.\n\nSince 1949, three monarchs of the House of Windsor, George VI, Elizabeth II, and Charles III, have also been Head of the Commonwealth of Nations, comprising most parts of the former British Empire and some states that were never part of it.\n\n**States Reigned Over**\n\nAt the creation of the House of Windsor, its head reigned over the British Empire.

of the Indianapolis Colts, and his father, who was considered a \"folk hero\" at Ole Miss [16] During his years with the Rebels, Manning set or tied numerous single-game, season and career records His career numbers include 10,119 passing yards (fifth on the SEC career list), 81 touchdown passes (third on the SEC career list), and a passer rating of 137.7 (tied for sixth on the SEC career list)

that he would refuse to play for the Chargers if drafted by them [75] Archie asked the father of former Chargers quarterback Ryan Leaf before the draft about his son's experience with the team In

season and his production diminished towards the end of the regular season After losing a tough game to his brother Peyton and the Indianapolis Colts on opening day, [104] Manning and the Giants

Bay Packers in Week 2 while throwing for 211 yards with one touchdown, [130] the Giants defense performed poorly again and the team dropped to 0–2 with Green Bay winning, 35–13 [130] In week three, Manning got a come-from-behind victory as the Giants defense improved, pitching a shutout in the second half and stopping the Washington Redskins on a fourth and goal situation, winning the game 24–17 [131] The Giants defense then shut down the Philadelphia Eagles with an NFL record-tying 12 sacks, [132] holding the Eagles offense to one field goal The Giants won with a score of 16–3 [133] The

Rams The following week, Manning rallied the Giants to more fourth-quarter magic, overcoming a late deficit to throw the go-ahead touchdown pass to tight end Kevin Boss, and then in overtime, throwing a clutch 31-yard pass to Amani Toomer in the Giants' 26–23 win over Cincinnati Bengals [167] The fourth week of the season saw the Giants score on each of their first six possessions and dominate the Seattle Seahawks, 44–6 Manning threw for two touchdowns, completing 19 of 25 passes for 267 yards as the Giants totaled 523 yards on offense, their most since 2002 [168]\n\n\n2009 season\nOn August 5, 2009, he signed a six-year US$97.5 million contract extension [182]\n\n\n2010 season\nOn August 16 during a preseason game against the New York Jets, Manning was hit by Brandon Jacobs, then by Calvin

Second Super Bowl championship\nIn August 2011, Manning generated mild controversy in the sports media during a radio interview on The Michael Kay Show When asked by host Michael Kay whether he was an elite \"Top 10, Top 5\" quarterback in the same class as Tom Brady, he responded:\n\n\n2011 regular season\nThe Giants opened the 2011 season with a slow start, losing to the rival Washington Redskins 28–14– in an emotional game for both fanbases on the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks [211] Manning completed 18 of 32 passes for 268 yards but threw a costly interception in the third quarter to linebacker Ryan Kerrigan, who returned it for a touchdown and swung the momentum of the game [212] However, the Giants recovered and won their next three games, including over the arch-rival Philadelphia Eagles, where he had 254 passing yards and four touchdowns in the 29–16 victory to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week [213] [214] During this streak, Manning improved, throwing for 266 yards per game with eight total touchdowns and one interception [215]\n\n\n2011 playoffs\nThe Giants entered the 2011 postseason as underdogs, with the worst record of any NFC playoff team [220] However, Manning and his team would once again demonstrate their endurance and durability late in the year The Giants first easily routed the Atlanta Falcons 24–2 in the Wild Card Round and then stunned the defending Super Bowl champions and top-seeded Green Bay Packers in the Divisional Round to advance to the NFC Championship Game [221] In the win, Manning completed 21 out of 33 attempts and threw three touchdowns and one interception [222] The following week, the Giants avenged their regular season loss to the San Francisco 49ers with a dramatic 20–17 overtime win in the NFC Championship Game [223] In the game, Manning set franchise playoff records with 32 completions on 52 attempts, good enough for 316 yards and two touchdowns despite being sacked a franchise-record-tying six times [224] This victory secured Manning and the Giants a second trip in five years to the Super Bowl, setting up a highly anticipated Super Bowl XLII rematch against Tom Brady and the New England Patriots The Giants also made history as the first Super Bowl team ever outscored in the regular season (394 points scored, 400 points allowed) [225]\n\n\nSuper Bowl XLVI\nIn the most-watched program in the history of United States television, [226] Manning once again led the Giants to an upset victory over the 2+1⁄2-point-favored Patriots 21–17, his second Super Bowl win

interceptions and 3,948 passing yards [241] As was typical for this phase of his career (2012–2016), Manning was exceptionally well-protected by his offensive line; he was sacked just 19 times for a league-lowest 3.4% of passing plays [241] Although the Giants did not qualify for the playoffs with a 9–7 season, Manning was selected to his third Pro Bowl as a second alternate [242] [243] He was

consecutive regular-season games started The streak was second all-time for quarterbacks behind Brett Favre's 297 [295] Head coach Ben McAdoo gave Manning the option of starting to keep the streak going but Manning declined, stating that \"My feeling is that if you are going to play the other guys, play them Starting just to keep the streak going and knowing you won't finish the game and have a chance to win it is pointless to me, and it tarnishes the streak.\" [296] The move was met with backlash from former Giants players and coaches [297] On December 5, two days after the Week 13 game, Manning was renamed the starter by interim head coach Steve Spagnuolo, after McAdoo was fired as head coach [298] [299] During Week 15 against the Philadelphia Eagles, Manning finished with 434

in the offseason and save $17 million in both cash and cap space, the team opted to keep him on their roster [312] However, neither side held any discussions for a contract extension, causing doubt for Manning's future as the Giants' franchise quarterback beyond the upcoming season [313] The team selected quarterback Daniel Jones in the first round of that year's draft, which many saw as the Giants selecting Manning's successor while further cementing his own lame-duck status in the position Manning was informed of the Giants' decision during their draft selection Despite the pick, general manager Dave Gettleman said \"the goal is for Eli to be our quarterback\", while head coach Shurmur told Manning \"it's your job to win games and keep  [Jones] off the field\" [314]

He is a two-time Super Bowl champion and two-time Super Bowl MVP. Manning is the younger brother of Peyton Manning, a fellow NFL quarterback and one of the greatest players in the history of the sport.\n\nEarly life\nManning was born in New Orleans, the youngest of three boys to Olivia (née Williams) and NFL quarterback Elisha Archibald \"Archie\" Manning III, both natives of Mississippi. His older brothers, Cooper and Peyton, both played football growing up.\n\nCollege career\nManning entered college in the shadow of his brother Peyton, quarterback of the Indianapolis Colts, and his father, who was considered a \"folk hero\" at Ole Miss. During his years with the Rebels, Manning set or tied numerous single-game, season, and career records. His career numbers include 10,119 passing yards (fifth on the SEC career list), 81 touchdown passes (third on the SEC career list), and a passer rating of 137.7 (tied for sixth on the SEC career list).\n\n2000 season\nAs a redshirt freshman, Manning competed with veteran Romaro Miller for the starting quarterback position and saw little playing time. He appeared in six games and passed for 170 total yards and one interception in the Rebels' 7-5 season.\n\n2001 season\nWith the departure of Miller, Manning became the Rebels' starting quarterback as a sophomore. In the first game, against Murray State, he converted 20-of-23 pass attempts for 271 yards and five passing touchdowns in the 49-14 victory. In the following game, a 27-21 loss to Auburn, he had 265 passing yards, one passing touchdown, and one interception.\n\n2002 season\nManning's junior season started out promising with a 31-3 victory over Louisiana-Monroe and a 38-16 victory over Memphis.

situation, winning the game 24–17 [131] The Giants defense then shut down the Philadelphia Eagles with an NFL record-tying 12 sacks, [132] holding the Eagles offense to one field goal The Giants won

team's fourth straight victory over the Rams The following week, Manning rallied the Giants to more fourth-quarter magic, overcoming a late deficit to throw the go-ahead touchdown pass to tight end Kevin Boss, and then in overtime, throwing a clutch 31-yard pass to Amani Toomer in the Giants' 26–23 win over Cincinnati Bengals [167] The fourth week of the season saw the Giants score on each of their first six possessions and dominate the Seattle Seahawks, 44–6 Manning threw for two touchdowns, completing 19 of 25 passes for 267 yards as the Giants totaled 523 yards on offense, their most

with a slow start, losing to the rival Washington Redskins 28–14– in an emotional game for both fanbases on the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks [211] Manning completed 18 of 32 passes for 268 yards but threw a costly interception in the third quarter to linebacker Ryan Kerrigan, who returned it for a touchdown and swung the momentum of the game [212] However, the Giants recovered and

49ers with a dramatic 20–17 overtime win in the NFC Championship Game [223] In the game, Manning set franchise playoff records with 32 completions on 52 attempts, good enough for 316 yards and two touchdowns despite being sacked a franchise-record-tying six times [224] This victory secured Manning and the Giants a second trip in five years to the Super Bowl, setting up a highly anticipated Super Bowl XLII rematch against Tom Brady and the New England Patriots The Giants also made history as the first Super Bowl team ever outscored in the regular season (394 points scored, 400 points allowed) [225]\n\n\nSuper Bowl XLVI\nIn the most-watched program in the history of United States television, [226] Manning once again led the Giants to an upset victory over the 2+1⁄2-point-favored

season with 26 touchdown passes, 15 interceptions and 3,948 passing yards [241] As was typical for this phase of his career (2012–2016), Manning was exceptionally well-protected by his offensive line;

McAdoo gave Manning the option of starting to keep the streak going but Manning declined, stating that \"My feeling is that if you are going to play the other guys, play them Starting just to keep the streak going and knowing you won't finish the game and have a chance to win it is pointless to me, and it tarnishes the streak.\" [296] The move was met with backlash from former Giants players and

his contract While the Giants had the option to release Manning in the offseason and save $17 million in both cash and cap space, the team opted to keep him on their roster [312] However, neither side held any discussions for a contract extension, causing doubt for Manning's future as the Giants' franchise quarterback beyond the upcoming season [313] The team selected quarterback Daniel Jones in the first round of that year's draft, which many saw as the Giants selecting Manning's successor while further cementing his own lame-duck status in the position Manning was informed of the Giants' decision during their draft selection Despite the pick, general manager Dave Gettleman said \"the goal is for Eli to be our quarterback\", while head coach Shurmur told Manning \"it's your job to win games and keep  [Jones] off the field\" [314] [315]\n\n\nRetirement and honors\nOn January 22, 2020, Manning announced his retirement, with an official press conference scheduled for January 24 [329]

He was a key player for the Athletics during the early 2000s, particularly in 2001 when he played alongside his older brother Jason.\n\nEarly life\nJeremy Giambi was born in San Jose, California. Like his older brother Jason, Giambi attended South Hills High School in West Covina, California. He attended California State University, Fullerton and played college baseball for the Cal State Fullerton Titans, with whom he won the 1995 College World Series. In 1994, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Bourne Braves of the Cape Cod Baseball League and was named a league all-star.\n\nProfessional career\nThe Kansas City Royals selected Giambi in the sixth round of the 1996 Major League Baseball Draft. Giambi made his major league debut as a September call-up for the Royals in 1998. The Athletics acquired Giambi from the Royals in exchange for Brett Laxton before the 2000 season. Jason and Jeremy played together during the 2000 and 2001 seasons. During Game 3 of the 2001 American League Division Series, Giambi was tagged out at home plate on the \"flip play\" by Derek Jeter.\n\nGiambi's time with the Athletics was marked by inconsistency, and he struggled to maintain a high level of performance throughout his career. He was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies in 2003, but his time with the team was short-lived. He played for the Phillies for a few months before being released in August 2003.\n\nSteroids\nOn March 13, 2005, The Kansas City Star reported that Giambi had admitted to having used anabolic steroids. His brother Jason has also admitted to using steroids according to grand jury testimony that was leaked to the press. On December 13, 2007, Giambi was named in the Mitchell Report on steroid usage in baseball as being among the athletes to whom BALCO founder Victor Conte claimed to have sold anabolic steroids. The report said BALCO VP Jim Valente had indicated that urine samples submitted to BALCO by both Jeremy and Jason had tested positive for the steroid drugs.\n\nPersonal life and death\nGiambi was mentioned in Michael Lewis's book Moneyball, and he became a character in the film that starred Brad Pitt, with Giambi portrayed by Nick Porrazzo. According to the book and film, Giambi was a key player for the Athletics during the early 2000s, and his performance was closely watched by the team's manager, Billy Beane. Giambi's story was one of the most notable in the book and film, and it highlighted the complexities and challenges of the game.\n\nDespite his struggles with performance and his admission to steroid use, Giambi remains a notable figure in baseball history. His time with the Athletics and his performance during the 2001 season were significant contributions to the team's success during that period.\n\nSee also\n\n* Moneyball\n* The Mitchell Report\n* BALCO scandal\n* Steroid use in baseball\n\nExternal links\n\n* Jeremy Giambi at Baseball-Reference.com\n* Jeremy Giambi at Baseball-Almanac.com", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Jeremy_Giambi\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nJeremy Giambi was born in San Jose, California [1] Like his older brother Jason, Giambi attended South Hills High School in West Covina, California [2] He attended California State University, Fullerton and played college baseball for the Cal State Fullerton Titans, with whom he won the 1995 College World Series [3] In 1994, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Bourne Braves of the Cape Cod Baseball League and was named a league all-star [4] [5]\n\n\nProfessional career\nThe Kansas City Royals selected Giambi in the sixth round of the 1996 Major League Baseball Draft [6] Giambi made his major league debut as a September call-up for the Royals in 1998 [7] The Athletics acquired Giambi from the Royals in exchange for Brett Laxton before the 2000 season [8] Jason and Jeremy played together during the 2000 and 2001 seasons During Game 3 of the 2001 American League Division Series, Giambi was tagged out at home plate on the \"flip play\" by Derek Jeter [1]\n\n\nSteroids\nOn March 13, 2005, The Kansas City Star reported that Giambi had admitted to having used anabolic steroids [14] His brother Jason has also admitted to using steroids according to grand jury testimony that was leaked to the press On December 13, 2007, Giambi was named in the Mitchell Report on steroid usage in baseball as being among the athletes to whom BALCO founder Victor Conte claimed to have sold anabolic steroids; the report said BALCO VP Jim Valente had indicated that urine samples submitted to BALCO by both Jeremy and Jason had tested positive for the steroid drugs [15]\n\n\nPersonal life and death\nGiambi was mentioned in Michael Lewis's book Moneyball, and he became a character in the film that starred Brad Pitt, with Giambi portrayed by Nick Porrazzo [16] [17]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Basketball Association (NBA). He is considered one of the greatest players of all time, known for his exceptional scoring, rebounding, and playmaking abilities.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nKevin Durant was born on September 29, 1988, in Washington, D.C. to Wanda (née Durant) and Wayne Pratt. When Durant was an infant, his father deserted the family, and Wanda and Wayne eventually divorced. Durant's grandmother, Barbara Davis, helped raise him. By age 13, Durant's father reentered his life, and the two traveled the country together to basketball tournaments. Durant has a sister, Brianna, and two brothers, Tony and Rayvonne.\n\n**College Career**\n\nFor the 2006–07 college season, Durant averaged 25.8 points, 11.1 rebounds, and 1.3 assists per game for the Texas Longhorns. Texas finished the season with a 25–10 record overall and a 12–4 record in conference. Awarded a #4 seed in the NCAA Tournament, Texas won its first round match-up against New Mexico State but was upset in the second round by USC despite a 30-point and 9-rebound performance from Durant. For his outstanding play, Durant was recognized as the unanimous national player of the year, winning the John R Wooden Award, the Naismith College Player of the Year Award, and all eight other widely recognized honors and awards. This made Durant the first freshman to win any of the national player of the year awards. Following the season, he declared for the NBA draft. Durant's No 35 jersey was later retired by the Longhorns.\n\n**Professional Career**\n\nDurant was selected as the second overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft by the Seattle SuperSonics, after Greg Oden was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers with the first pick of the draft. In his first regular season game, the 19-year-old Durant registered 18 points, five rebounds, and three steals against the Denver Nuggets. On November 16, he made the first game-winning shot of his career in a game against the Atlanta Hawks.\n\n**Seattle SuperSonics / Oklahoma City Thunder (2007–2016)**\n\nDurant was selected as the second overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft by the Seattle SuperSonics, after Greg Oden was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers with the first pick of the draft. In his first regular season game, the 19-year-old Durant registered 18 points, five rebounds, and three steals against the Denver Nuggets. On November 16, he made the first game-winning shot of his career in a game against the Atlanta Hawks.\n\n**Rookie of the Year (2007–2008)**\n\nDurant was selected as the second overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft by the Seattle SuperSonics, after Greg Oden was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers with the first pick of the draft. In his first regular season game, the 19-year-old Durant registered 18 points, five rebounds, and three steals against the Denver Nuggets. On November 16, he made the first game-winning shot of his career in a game against the Atlanta Hawks.\n\n**Breakthrough (2008–2010)**\n\nFollowing Durant's rookie season, the Supersonics relocated to Oklahoma City, becoming the Thunder and switching to new colors – blue, orange, and yellow. The team also drafted UCLA guard Russell Westbrook, who would form an All-Star combination with Durant in later years. At the 2009 NBA All-Star Weekend, he set a Rookie Challenge record with 46 points. By the end of the 2008–09 NBA season, Durant had raised his scoring average by five points from the prior season to 25.3 points per game, and was considered a strong candidate for the Most Improved Player Award, eventually finishing third in the voting. Durant continued to grow during his first few years in the NBA, finally reaching a height of 6 ft 11 in (2.11 m).\n\n**First NBA Finals (2010–2012)**\n\nPrior to the start of the 2010–11 season, Durant announced via Twitter that he had signed a five-year contract extension with the Thunder worth approximately $86 million. For the second consecutive year, Durant led the NBA in scoring, averaging 27.7 points a game. Behind his leadership, the Thunder won 55 games and earned the fourth seed in the Western Conference. In the 2011 NBA playoffs, Oklahoma City defeated the Denver Nuggets and Memphis Grizzlies en route to a Conference Finals match-up against the Dallas Mavericks, losing in five games.\n\n**50–40–90 season (2012–2013)**\n\nWith a scoring average of 28.1 points per game to finish the 2012–13 season, Durant failed to defend his scoring title; however, with a 51 percent shooting rate, a 41.6 percent three-point shooting rate, and a 90.5 free throw shooting rate, Durant became the youngest player in NBA history to join the 50–40–90 club. Finishing the year with a 60–22 record, the Thunder earned the first seed in the Western Conference. In the first round of the 2013 NBA playoffs against the Houston Rockets, Westbrook tore his meniscus, forcing him to miss the remainder of the postseason. Without Westbrook, Durant was given more responsibility, averaging a career-high 30.8 points per game throughout the playoffs, the Thunder defeated Houston 4–2 but were eliminated in the second round 1–4 by the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\n**MVP season (2013–2014)**\n\nIn January of the 2013–14 season, Durant averaged 35.9 points per game while scoring 30 or more points in 12 straight games, including a career-high 54 points against the Golden State Warriors. In April, he surpassed Michael Jordan's record for consecutive games scoring 25 points or more at 41. The Thunder finished the year with 59 wins and Durant was voted the NBA Most Valuable Player behind averages of 32 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 5.5 assists per game. To begin the first round of the 2014 NBA playoffs, he struggled against the physical play of the Grizzlies, converting on only 24 percent of his field goals in game 4. Through five games, the Thunder trailed the series 3–2, prompting The Oklahoman to dub Durant \"Mr. Unreliable.\" He responded by scoring 36 points in a Game 6 victory. Oklahoma City eventually eliminated Memphis and the Los Angeles Clippers before losing to the San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference Finals in six games.\n\n**Final seasons with the Thunder (2014–2016)**\n\nPrior to the start of the 2014–15 season, Durant was diagnosed with a Jones fracture in his right foot and was ruled out for six to eight weeks. Durant subsequently missed the first 17 games of the year, making his season debut for the Thunder on December 2 against the New Orleans Pelicans. On December 18, Durant injured his ankle against the Golden State Warriors, returning to action on December 31 against the Phoenix Suns to score a season-high 44 points. Durant then sprained his left big toe in late January. On February 22, he was sidelined again after undergoing a minor procedure to help reduce pain and discomfort in his surgically repaired right foot, and on March 27, Durant was officially ruled out for the rest of the season after deciding to undergo foot surgery. In just 27 games, he averaged 25.4 points, 6.6 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game.\n\n**Golden State Warriors (2016–2019)**\n\nOn July 4, Durant announced his intentions to sign with the Golden State Warriors in The Players' Tribune. The move was received negatively by fans and pundits, who felt Durant took the easy route by forming a superteam with a Warriors squad coming off a record-setting 73-win season in 2016 and a championship in 2015, further compounded by the Thunder's blown 3–1 series lead against those same Warriors. On July 7, Durant officially signed with Golden State on a two-year, $54.3 million contract with a player option after the first year.\n\n**First championship and finals MVP (2016–2017)**\n\nOn July 4, Durant announced his intentions to sign with the Golden State Warriors in The Players' Tribune. The move was received negatively by fans and pundits, who felt Durant took the easy route by forming a superteam with a Warriors squad coming off a record-setting 73-win season in 2016 and a championship in 2015, further compounded by the Thunder's blown 3–1 series lead against those same Warriors. On July 7, Durant officially signed with Golden State on a two-year, $54.3 million contract with a player option after the first year.\n\n**Second championship and finals MVP (2017–2018)**\n\nAfter the 2017 NBA Finals, Durant declined his $27.7 million player option and became an unrestricted free agent. On July 25, he re-signed with the Warriors for less money than the maximum, which helped the franchise create enough salary cap space to keep their core roster intact and add free agents.\n\n**Three-peat chase and injury (2018–2019)**\n\nOn July 7, 2018, Durant re-signed with the Warriors on a reported two-year, $61.5 million contract, which included a player option for the second year.\n\n**Brooklyn Nets (2019–2023)**\n\nOn June 30, 2019, Durant announced that he planned to sign with the Brooklyn Nets after the July moratorium ended on July 6. On July 1, Golden State CEO Joe Lacob announced that Durant's No 35 will no longer be issued by the Warriors. Durant signed with Brooklyn on July 7, in a sign-and-trade deal.\n\n**Year absence (2019–2020)**\n\nOn June 30, 2019, Durant announced that he planned to sign with the Brooklyn Nets after the July moratorium ended on July 6. On July 1, Golden State CEO Joe Lacob announced that Durant's No 35 will no longer be issued by the Warriors. Durant signed with Brooklyn on July 7, in a sign-and-trade deal.

On March 17, 2020, Durant and three other Nets players tested positive for COVID-19. On April 1, it was announced that Durant was cleared and had recovered.\n\n**Return to the court (2020–2021)**\n\nOn December 22, 2020, Durant made his Nets debut, putting up 22 points, five rebounds, three assists, and three steals, in a 125–99 win over his former team, the Golden State Warriors. On January 14, 2021, James Harden was traded to the Nets in a blockbuster four-team deal, reuniting Durant with his former Thunder teammate. On January 16, 2021, Durant scored a season-high 42 points in a 122–115 win over the Orlando Magic. On February 5, due to health and safety protocols, Durant came off the bench for the first time in his career in a 117–123 loss to the Toronto Raptors. In February, Durant suffered a hamstring injury, which forced him to miss 23 games. On April 2, the NBA fined Durant $50,000 for private messages he sent through social media to actor Michael Rapaport in a feud. Durant made his return on April 7, 2021, scoring 17 points off the bench in a 139–119 win over the New Orleans Pelicans. The Nets finished the season with a 48–24 record, and the second seed in the East.\n\n**Playoff disappointment (2021–2022)**\n\nOn August 8, 2021, Durant signed a four-year, $198 million extension with the Nets.\n\n**Offseason trade request (2022–2023)**\n\nOn June 30, 2022, it was reported that Durant had requested a trade from the Nets. Durant's preferred trade destinations were the Phoenix Suns and the Miami Heat. The favorites to land Durant were the Toronto Raptors and Boston Celtics, two teams which he had also been interested in. On August 24, 2022, Durant rescinded his trade request after meeting with Nets management.\n\n**Phoenix Suns (2023–present)**\n\nOn February 9, 2023, the Nets traded Durant, along with T J Warren, to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for Mikal Bridges, Cameron Johnson, Jae Crowder, four unprotected first-round picks, and a 2028 first-round pick swap. Although Durant wanted to continue wearing No 7 as he did in Brooklyn, the number was retired by the Suns in honor of Kevin Johnson. As a result, Durant announced that he would return to wearing the No 35 jersey, which he had worn throughout his college and professional career prior to joining the Nets.\n\n**Top 10 in all-time scoring (2023–2024)**\n\nOn October 31, 2023, Durant put up 26 points in a 115–114 loss to the San Antonio Spurs. He passed Hakeem Olajuwon for 12th on the all-time career scoring list and became the 12th player all-time to reach 27,000 career points. On November 17, Durant recorded 38 points, nine rebounds, and nine assists on 15-of-22 shooting from the field in a 131–128 win over the Utah Jazz. On November 21, Durant put up 31 points in a 120–107 win over the Portland Trail Blazers. He also passed Elvin Hayes for 11th place on the all-time career scoring list. On December 1, Durant put up 30 points and 11 assists in a 119–111 loss to the reigning NBA champion Denver Nuggets in a rematch of the previous season's Western Conference Semi-Finals. He also passed Moses Malone for 10th place on the all-time career scoring list. On December 27, Durant put up his 18th career triple-double, dropping 27 points, 10 rebounds, and tying his career-high with 16 assists in a 129–113 victory over the Houston Rockets.\n\n**National team career**\n\nIn February 2007, Durant received an invitation to the United States national team training camp. Despite a strong performance, he was cut from the team when its roster was trimmed to its twelve-player limit. Coach Mike Krzyzewski cited the experience of the remaining players as the deciding factor in making the cut. Durant was finally selected to the national team at the 2010 FIBA World Championship and became their leader as other All-Stars were unavailable, a role he downplayed. At the tournament, he led Team USA to its first FIBA World Championship since 1994, earning tournament MVP honors in the process. Durant's final averages for the competition were 22.8 points, 6.1 rebounds, 1.8 assists, and 1.4 steals per game in nine games. In December, Durant was named 2010 USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year for the first time in his career.\n\n**Player profile**\n\nDurant's height is officially listed as 6 ft 11 in (2.11 m) and his primary position is small forward. In December 2016, Durant stated that his height in shoes was actually 7 ft 0 in (2.13 m) and that he understated his height in order to be listed as a small forward, rather than a power forward. Durant's career averages are 27.3 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 4.3 assists per game. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Durant has earned All-NBA honors 11 times (2010–2014, 2016–2019, 2022, 2024) and was voted rookie of the year in his debut season. He has also won an MVP Award and finished second in the voting thrice, a trend that he has expressed frustration over.\n\n**Personal life**\n\nDurant is very close with his mother, Wanda, a relationship that was detailed in the Lifetime movie The Real MVP: The Wanda Durant Story. During his time with the Thunder, Durant described himself as a \"high school kid\" who enjoys playing video games in his spare time. Durant is a Christian who attended Baptist schools. He has religious tattoos on his stomach, wrist, and back. Durant owns several properties in the Oklahoma City area and listed his primary residence, located in the affluent Club Villa neighborhood, for sale for $1.95 million in 2013. That same year, Durant opened a restaurant, KD's Southern Cuisine, in the Bricktown neighborhood and briefly became engaged to Monica Wright, a WNBA player. In 2016, Durant was a credentialed photographer for The Players' Tribune at Super Bowl 50.\n\n**Career statistics**\n\nSource: \n\nNBA\n\nRegular season\n\nPlay-in\n\nPlayoffs\n\nCollege\n\nAwards and

Born on Christmas Day, 25 December 1919, in East Ham, London, Gordon's life was marked by a distinguished career in theatre, television, and music.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nGordon was born at 139 Clements Road, East Ham, Essex (now in the London Borough of Newham), to a Scottish father who worked as an engineer in the Merchant Navy. Her middle name, Noele, was given to her because of her birth on Christmas Day. After attending convent school in Ilford, Gordon was taught to dance by Maude Wells and later spent several years living in Southend-on-Sea. Her first public appearance was at the East Ham Palace, followed by a performance at a restaurant in London, where she sang \"Dear Little Jammy Face\".\n\nGordon's mother and aunt were keen for her to begin a stage career, and she was soon to make history as the first woman to be seen on colour television sets. At the age of 18, Gordon took part in John Logie Baird's colour transmission tests in 1938, a pioneering achievement in the field of television technology.\n\n**Career**\n\nGordon's early career took her to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), where she began to make a name for herself in repertory theatres and the West End stage. Her breakthrough role came in June 1943, when she appeared in the musical _The Lisbon Story_ at the London Hippodrome, a production that ran until July 1944. Gordon's subsequent success led to her taking the role of Meg Brockie in the original London production of _Brigadoon_ at Her Majesty's Theatre in April 1949. The show ran for an impressive 685 performances, and Gordon stayed with the production for a national tour.\n\nIn 1953, Gordon toured as Mrs Sally Adams in _Call Me Madam_, a musical that had previously been performed in the London season at the Coliseum. Her performance in this role cemented her reputation as a talented actress and singer, and she was soon to be cast in a new and iconic role that would become synonymous with British television.\n\n**Crossroads**\n\nIn the summer of 1964, _Lunchbox_ came to an end after more than 2,000 episodes, making way for a new daily soap opera, _Crossroads_. Gordon was cast as Meg Richardson (later Meg Mortimer), a role that had been developed with her in mind, as she was still under contract to Lew Grade's ATV. The show was a huge success, running for over 20 years and becoming a staple of British television. Gordon's performance as Meg Richardson was widely praised, and she became a household name.\n\n**Later Career**\n\nAfter leaving _Crossroads_, Gordon went on to star in the musical _Gypsy_ at Leicester's Haymarket Theatre, followed by a revival of Irving Berlin's musical _Call Me Madam_, which toured the Midlands. The show then moved to the Victoria Palace Theatre in the West End, where it ran for 88 performances. Gordon's final stage role was in _No, No, Nanette_ at Plymouth's Theatre Royal, a production that was unfortunately cut short due to her illness.\n\n**Personal Life, Illness and Death**\n\nGordon never married and spent much of her life in a large white-washed Georgian manor house at Weir End, near Ross-on-Wye, beside the A40 road to Monmouth. Her mother, Joan, lived in the house and Gordon joined her at weekends. Gordon's later life was marked by illness, and she was eventually replaced in _No, No, Nanette_ due to her poor health.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nIn 2023, a televised drama, _Nolly_, was made by ITV Studios, which depicted Gordon's time in _Crossroads_ and her sacking from the show. Written by Russell T Davies and directed by Peter Hoar, the drama stars Helena Bonham Carter as Gordon. The show is a poignant tribute to Gordon's life and career, and a reminder of her enduring legacy in British television.\n\nGordon's life and career were marked by a series of remarkable achievements, from her pioneering work in colour television to her iconic role in _Crossroads_. Her legacy continues to inspire new generations of actors, singers, and television personalities, and her name remains synonymous with British entertainment.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Noele_Gordon\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nGordon was born on 25 December 1919, at 139 Clements Road, East Ham, Essex (now in the London Borough of Newham) [3] [4] Her father, who was from Scotland, was an engineer in the Merchant Navy when she was born She was given the middle name of Noele because she was born on Christmas Day After attending convent school in Ilford, she was taught to dance by Maude Wells and later spent several years living in Southend-on-Sea She made her first public appearance at the East Ham Palace and shortly afterwards, sang \"Dear Little Jammy Face\" at a restaurant in London After this event, her mother and her aunt were keen for her to begin a stage career Gordon was credited as the first woman to be seen on colour television sets, [5] [6] as she took part, as a teenager, in John Logie Baird's colour transmission tests in 1938 [7]\n\n\nCareer\nGordon attended RADA, appearing in repertory theatres and the West End stage From June 1943 to July 1944, she appeared in the musical The Lisbon Story at the London Hippodrome In April 1949, she took the role of Meg Brockie in the original London production of Brigadoon for 685 performances at Her Majesty's Theatre She stayed with the show for a national tour In 1953, she toured as Mrs Sally Adams in Call Me Madam after Billie Adams had played the role in the London season at the Coliseum.\n\n\nEarly career\nGordon attended RADA, appearing in repertory theatres and the West End stage From June 1943 to July 1944, she appeared in the musical The Lisbon Story at the London Hippodrome In April 1949, she took the role of Meg Brockie in the original London production of Brigadoon for 685 performances at Her Majesty's Theatre She stayed with the show for a national tour In 1953, she toured as Mrs Sally Adams in Call Me Madam after Billie Adams had played the role in the London season at the Coliseum.\n\n\nCrossroads\nIn the summer of 1964, Lunchbox came to an end after more than 2,000 episodes It made way for a new daily soap opera, Crossroads, in which Gordon played the role of motel owner Meg Richardson (later Meg Mortimer), a part that had been developed with Gordon in mind, as she was still under contract to Lew Grade's ATV [12]\n\n\nLater career\nAfter the termination of her Crossroads contract, Gordon starred in the musical Gypsy at Leicester's Haymarket Theatre, followed by a revival of Irving Berlin's musical Call Me Madam, touring the Midlands It then moved to the Victoria Palace Theatre in the West End, where it ran for only 88 performances Her last stage role was in No, No, Nanette at Plymouth's Theatre Royal She became ill during the run and had to be replaced.\n\n\nPersonal life, illness and death\nGordon never married [18] For many years, in the 1960s and early 1970s, she stayed in a large white-washed Georgian manor house at Weir End, near Ross-on-Wye, beside the A40 road to Monmouth; her mother Joan (1893–1979) lived in the house and Gordon joined her at weekends [19]\n\n\nLegacy\nA televised drama, Nolly, with Helena Bonham Carter playing Gordon, [21] written by Russell T Davies and directed by Peter Hoar, was made by ITV Studios It  depicts her time in Crossroads and her sacking from the show [22] It first aired in February 2023 [23]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This article provides an overview of the series of deaths, the calls for further investigations, and the suspicious circumstances surrounding these events.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe series of deaths among Russian businessmen and oligarchs began in January 2022, with the first reported death being that of Leonid Shulman, a 60-year-old transport chief for Russian energy giant Gazprom. Since then, numerous other deaths have been reported, with many of the victims having links to the Kremlin or the Russian energy industry. The phenomenon has been referred to as \"sudden Russian death syndrome\" or \"sudden oligarch death syndrome\", a play on sudden arrhythmic death syndrome.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe first reported death was on January 30, 2022, when Leonid Shulman was found dead in his bathroom at his country house in the Leningrad region. A suicide note was found beside his body, but his friends and family found it \"unthinkable\" that he would have taken his own life. The investigation into his death was inconclusive.\n\nOn July 6, 2022, CNN Portugal reported that 38 Russian businessmen and oligarchs close to the Kremlin had died in mysterious or suspicious circumstances between 2014 and 2017. This report highlighted the frequency and suspicious nature of these deaths.\n\n**Calls for Further Investigations**\n\nFriends and families of the deceased Russian businessmen generally found the circumstances surrounding their deaths to be suspicious. Igor Volobuyev, a Ukrainian-born ex-vice-chairman of Gazprombank, who left Russia during the outbreak of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and joined the Freedom of Russia Legion, expressed his skepticism about the official investigation into Vladislav Avayev's death. He suggested that Avayev's death may have been staged, as he may have known something that posed a danger to someone.\n\nSimilarly, Sergey Protosenya's son, who was not in Spain when his parents and sister were found dead in Lloret de Mar, stated that his father was not the perpetrator of the crime. He called for a thorough and impartial investigation into the deaths of his parents and sister.\n\n**Suspicious Deaths**\n\nSeveral of the deceased Russian businessmen and oligarchs died under suspicious circumstances. Some of the notable cases include:\n\n* Velikie Luki: No explanation was given for the cause of death.\n* 2022: Velikie Luki: No explanation was given for the cause of death.\n* 2023: An Embraer Legacy 600 business jet with registration number RA-02795 crashed during a regular high-altitude flight from Moscow to Saint Petersburg, killing Prigozhin, Utkin, and Chekalov, as well as two Wagner veterans, two bodyguards, and the three flight staff. According to Wagner Group, the plane was shot down by air defenses, but according to the US government and aviation experts, the plane was downed by a bomb onboard or other sabotage.\n\n**2024**\n\nThe investigation into the deaths of the Russian businessmen and oligarchs continues, with many of the cases remaining unsolved. The circumstances surrounding these deaths remain shrouded in mystery, and the lack of transparency and accountability has raised concerns about the safety and security of those involved.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Sudden arrhythmic death syndrome\n* Russian oligarchs\n* Gazprom\n* Novatek\n* Wagner Group\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Freedom of Russia Legion\n* Wagner Group\n* CNN Portugal\n* USA Today", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Russian_businessmen_mystery_deaths\" following this outline:\n\n\nAnalysis\nOn 3 June 2022 the Dutch NOS news network described the phenomenon as \"a grim series of Russian billionaires, many from the oil and gas industries, who have been found dead under unusual circumstances since early this year The first was on 30 January, when 60-year-old Leonid Shulman, transport chief for Russian energy giant Gazprom, was found dead in the bathroom of his country house in the Leningrad region Beside his body was a suicide note.\" [4] On 6 July 2022, CNN Portugal described the group as \"millionaires with direct or indirect links to the Kremlin found dead in a mystery scenario since the beginning of the year\" [5] It referred to a previous investigation by USA Today, which concluded that \"38 Russian businessmen and oligarchs close to the Kremlin died in mysterious or suspicious circumstances between 2014 and 2017.\" [5] The phenomenon has been called \"sudden Russian death syndrome\" or \"sudden oligarch death syndrome\", a play on sudden arrhythmic death syndrome [6] [7] A number of them died by falling from heights, including possible defenestrations [7]\n\n\nCalls for further investigations\nFriends and families of the deceased Russian businessmen generally found it \"unthinkable\" that they killed themselves – and in some cases also their wives and children – and have demanded an independent investigation into the mysterious deaths [4] Igor Volobuyev  [uk], the Ukrainian-born ex-vice-chairman of Gazprombank, who left Russia during the outbreak of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and joined the Freedom of Russia Legion, [9] [10] said in an interview with The Insider that he thought that his former colleague Vladislav Avayev's alleged murder of his family and subsequent suicide had been staged: \"Why?

{"title": "England", "content": "\nToponymy\nThe name \"England\" is derived from the Old English name Englaland, which means \"land of the Angles\" [15] The Angles were one of the Germanic tribes that settled in Great Britain during the Early Middle Ages They came from the Angeln region of what is now the German state of Schleswig-Holstein [16] The earliest recorded use of the term, as \"Engla londe\", is in the late-ninth-century translation into Old English of Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People The term was then used to mean \"the land inhabited by the English\", and it included English people in what is now south-east Scotland but was then part of the English kingdom of Northumbria The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle recorded that the Domesday Book of 1086 covered the whole of England, meaning the English kingdom, but a few years later the Chronicle stated that King Malcolm III went \"out of Scotlande into Lothian in Englaland\", thus using it in the more ancient sense [17]\n\n\nHistory\nThe earliest known evidence of human presence in the area now known as England was that of Homo antecessor, dating to about 780,000 years ago The oldest proto-human bones discovered in England date from 500,000 years ago [23] Modern humans are known to have inhabited the area during the Upper Paleolithic period, though permanent settlements were only established within the last 6,000 years [24] After the last ice age only large mammals such as mammoths, bison and woolly rhinoceros remained Roughly 11,000 years ago, when the ice sheets began to recede, humans repopulated the area; genetic research suggests they came from the northern part of the Iberian Peninsula [25] The sea level was lower than the present day and Britain was connected by land bridge to Ireland and Eurasia [26]\nAs the seas rose, it was separated from Ireland 10,000 years ago and from Eurasia two millennia later.\n\n\nPrehistory\nThe earliest known evidence of human presence in the area now

Iberian Peninsula [25] The sea level was lower than the present day and Britain was connected by land bridge to Ireland and Eurasia [26]\nAs the seas rose, it was separated from Ireland 10,000 years ago and from Eurasia two millennia later.\n\n\nAncient history\nThe Romans invaded Britain in 43 AD during the reign of Emperor Claudius, subsequently conquering much of Britain, and the area was incorporated into the Roman Empire as Britannia province [29] The best-known of the native tribes who attempted to resist were the Catuvellauni led by Caratacus Later, an uprising led by Boudica, Queen of the Iceni, ended with Boudica's suicide following her defeat at the Battle of Watling Street [30] The author of one study of Roman Britain suggested that from 43 AD to 84 AD, the Roman invaders killed somewhere between 100,000 and 250,000 people from a population of perhaps 2,000,000 [31] This era saw a Greco-Roman culture prevail with the introduction of Roman law, Roman architecture, aqueducts, sewers, many agricultural items and silk [32] In the 3rd century, Emperor Septimius Severus died at Eboracum (now York), where Constantine was subsequently proclaimed emperor a century later [33]\n\n\nMiddle Ages\nRoman military withdrawals left Britain open to invasion by pagan, seafaring warriors from north-western continental Europe, chiefly the Saxons, Angles, Jutes and Frisians who had long raided the coasts of the Roman province These groups then began to settle in increasing numbers over the course of the fifth and sixth centuries, initially in the eastern part of the country [35] Their advance was contained for some decades after the Britons' victory at the Battle of Mount Badon, but subsequently resumed, overrunning the fertile lowlands of Britain and reducing the area under Brittonic control to a series of separate enclaves in the more rugged country to the west by the end of the 6th century Contemporary texts describing this period are extremely scarce, giving rise to its description as a Dark Age Details of the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain are consequently subject to considerable disagreement; the emerging consensus is that it occurred on a large scale in the south and east but was less substantial to the north and west, where Celtic languages continued to be spoken even in areas under Anglo-Saxon control [37] [38] Roman-dominated Christianity had, in general, been replaced in the conquered territories by Anglo-Saxon paganism, but was reintroduced by missionaries from Rome led by Augustine from 597 [39] Disputes between the Roman- and Celtic-dominated forms of Christianity ended in victory for the Roman tradition at the Council of Whitby (664), which was ostensibly about tonsures (clerical haircuts) and the date of Easter, but more significantly, about the differences in Roman and Celtic forms of authority, theology, and practice [36]\n\n\nEarly modern period\nDuring the Tudor period, England began to develop naval skills, and exploration intensified in the Age of Discovery [51] Henry VIII broke from communion with the Catholic Church, over issues relating to his divorce, under the Acts of Supremacy in 1534 which proclaimed the monarch head of the Church of England In contrast with much of European Protestantism, the roots of the split were more political than theological [d] He also legally incorporated his ancestral land Wales into the Kingdom of England with the 1535–1542 acts There were internal religious conflicts during the reigns of Henry's daughters, Mary I and Elizabeth I The former took the country back to Catholicism while the latter broke from it again, forcefully asserting the supremacy of Anglicanism The Elizabethan era is the epoch in the Tudor age of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I (\"the Virgin Queen\") Historians often depict it as the golden age in English history that represented the apogee of the English Renaissance and saw the flowering of great art, drama, poetry, music and literature [53] England during this period had a centralised, well-organised, and effective government [54]\n\n\nUnion with Scotland\nThe political structure of the island changed in 1603, when the King of Scots, James VI, a kingdom which had been a long-time rival to English interests, inherited the throne of England as James I, thereby creating a personal union [56] He styled himself King of Great Britain, although this had no basis in English law [57] Under the auspices of James VI and I the Authorised King James Version of the Holy Bible was published in 1611 It was the standard version of the Bible read by most Protestant Christians for four hundred years until modern revisions were produced in the 20th century.\n\n\nLate modern and contemporary periods\nUnder the newly formed Kingdom of Great Britain, output from the Royal Society and other English initiatives combined with the Scottish Enlightenment to create innovations in science and engineering, while the enormous growth in British overseas trade protected by the Royal Navy paved the way for the establishment of the British Empire Domestically it drove the Industrial Revolution, a period of profound change in the socioeconomic and cultural conditions of England, resulting in industrialised agriculture, manufacture, engineering and mining, as well as new and pioneering road, rail and water networks to facilitate their expansion and development [66] The opening of Northwest England's Bridgewater Canal in 1761 ushered in the canal age in Britain [67] In 1825 the world's first permanent steam locomotive-hauled passenger railway – the Stockton and Darlington Railway – opened to the public [67]\n\n\nGovernance\nEngland is part of the United Kingdom, a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system [86] There has not been a government of England since 1707, when the Acts of Union 1707, [87] putting into effect the terms of the Treaty of Union, joined England and Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain [64] Before the union England was ruled by its monarch and the Parliament of England \n\n\nPolitics\nEngland is part of the United Kingdom, a

joined England and Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain [64] Before the union England was ruled by its monarch and the Parliament of England \n\n\nLaw\nThe English law legal system, developed over the centuries, is the basis of common law [91] legal systems used in most Commonwealth countries [92] and the United States (except Louisiana) Despite now being part of the United Kingdom, the legal system of the Courts of England and Wales continued, under the Treaty of Union, as a separate legal system from the one used in Scotland The general essence of English law is that it is made by judges sitting in courts, applying their common sense and knowledge of legal precedent – stare decisis – to the facts before them [93]\n\n\nSubdivisions\nThe subdivisions of England consist of up to four levels of subnational division, controlled through a variety of types of administrative entities created for the purposes of local government.\n\n\nLondon\nFrom 1994 until the early 2010s England was divided for a few purposes into regions; a 1998 referendum for the London Region created the London Assembly two years later [105] A failed 2004 North East England devolution referendum cancelled further regional assembly devolution [85] with the regional structure outside London abolished.\n\n\nGeography\nGeographically, England includes the central and southern two-thirds of the island of Great Britain, plus such offshore islands as the Isle of Wight and the Isles of Scilly It is bordered by two other countries of the United Kingdom: to the north by Scotland and to the west by Wales.\n\n\nLandscape and rivers\nGeographically, England includes the central and southern two-thirds of the island of Great Britain, plus such offshore islands as the Isle of Wight and the Isles of Scilly It is bordered by two other countries of the United Kingdom: to the north by Scotland and to the west by Wales.\n\n\nClimate\nEngland has a temperate maritime climate: it is mild with temperatures not much lower than 0 °C (32 °F) in winter and not much higher than 32 °C (90 °F) in summer [116] The weather is damp relatively frequently and is changeable The coldest months are January and February, the latter particularly on the English coast, while July is normally the warmest month Months with mild to warm weather are May, June, September and October [116] Rainfall is spread fairly evenly throughout the year.\n\n\nNature and wildlife\nThe fauna of England is similar to that of other areas in the British Isles with a wide range of vertebrate and invertebrate life in a diverse range of habitats [120] National nature reserves in England are designated by Natural England as key places for wildlife and natural features in England They were established to protect the most significant areas of habitat and of geological formations NNRs are managed on behalf of the nation, many by Natural England themselves, but also by non-governmental organisations, including the members of The Wildlife Trusts partnership, the National Trust, and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds There are 221 NNRs in England covering 110,000 hectares (1,100 square kilometres) Often they contain rare species or nationally important populations of plants and animals [121]\n.\n\n\nMajor conurbations\nThe Greater London Built-up Area is by far the largest urban area in England [126] and one of the busiest cities in the world It is considered a global city and has a population larger than any other country in the United Kingdom besides England itself [126] Other urban areas of considerable size and influence tend to be in northern England or the English Midlands [126] There are 50 settlements which have designated city status in England, while the wider United Kingdom has 66.\n\n\nEconomy\nEngland's economy is one of the largest and most dynamic in the world, with an average GDP per capita of £37,852 in 2022 [5] HM Treasury, led by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is responsible for developing and executing the government's public finance policy and economic policy [128] Usually regarded as a mixed market economy, it has adopted many free market principles, yet maintains an advanced social welfare infrastructure [129]\n\n\nScience and technology\nProminent English figures from the field of science and mathematics include Sir Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Robert Hooke, Alan Turing, Stephen Hawking, Edward Jenner, Francis Crick, Joseph Lister, Joseph Priestley, Thomas Young, Christopher Wren and Richard Dawkins.\n\n\nTransport\nThe Department for Transport is the government body responsible for overseeing transport in England The department is run by the Secretary of State for Transport.\n\n\nEnergy\nSuccessive governments have outlined numerous commitments to reduce carbon dioxide emissions Notably, the UK is one of the best sites in Europe for wind energy, and wind power production is its fastest growing supply [168] Wind power contributed 26.8% of UK electricity generation in 2022 [169] England is home to Hornsea 2, the largest offshore wind farm in the world, situated in waters roughly 89 kilometres off the coast of Yorkshire [170]\n\n\nHealthcare\nThe National Health Service (NHS), is the publicly funded healthcare system responsible for providing the majority of healthcare in the country The NHS began on 5 July 1948, putting into effect the provisions of the National Health Service Act 1946 It was based on the findings of the Beveridge Report, prepared by the economist and social reformer, William Beveridge [177] The NHS is largely funded by general taxation and National Insurance payments; [178] it provides most of its services free at the point of use, although there are charges for some people for eye tests, dental care, prescriptions and aspects of personal care [179]\n\n\nDemography\nWith over 56 million inhabitants, England is by far the most populous country of the United Kingdom, accounting for 84% of the combined total [3] England taken as a unit and measured against international states would be the 26th largest country by population in the world [182]\n\n\nPopulation\nWith over 56 million inhabitants, England is by far the most populous country of the United Kingdom, accounting for 84% of the combined total [3] England taken as a unit and measured against international states would be the 26th largest country by population in the world [182]\n\n\nLanguage\n(thousands) [196]\n\n\nReligion\nIn the 2011 census, 59.4% of the population of England specified their religion as Christian, 24.7% answered that they had no religion, 5% specified that they were Muslim, while 3.7% of the population belongs to other religions and 7.2% did not give an answer [207] Christianity is the most widely practised religion in England The established church of England is the Church of England, [208] which left communion with Rome in the 1530s when Henry VIII was unable to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon The church regards itself as both Catholic and Protestant [209]\n\n\nEducation\nThe Department for Education is the government department responsible for issues affecting people in England up to the age of 19, including education [219] State-funded schools are attended by about 93% of English schoolchildren [220] Education is the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Education [221]\n\n\nHigher education\nHigher education students normally attend university from age 18 onwards, where they study for an academic degree There are over 90 universities in England, all but one of which are public institutions The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is the government department responsible for higher education in England [227] Students are generally entitled to student loans to cover tuition fees and living costs [i] The first degree offered to undergraduates is the bachelor's degree, which usually takes three years to complete Students are then able to work towards a postgraduate degree, which usually takes one year, or a doctorate, which takes three or more years [229]\n\n\nCulture\nMany ancient standing stone monuments were erected during the prehistoric period; among the best known are Stonehenge, Devil's Arrows, Rudston Monolith and Castlerigg [235] With the introduction of Ancient Roman architecture there was a development of basilicas, baths, amphitheaters, triumphal arches, villas, Roman temples, Roman roads, Roman forts, stockades and aqueducts [236] It was the Romans who founded the first cities and towns such as London, Bath, York, Chester and St Albans Perhaps the best-known example is Hadrian's Wall stretching right across northern England [236] Another well-preserved example is the Roman Baths at Bath, Somerset [236]\n\n\nArchitecture\nMany ancient standing stone monuments were erected during the prehistoric period; among the best known are Stonehenge, Devil's Arrows, Rudston

international trend for the English landscape garden Gardening, and visiting gardens, are regarded as typically English pursuits The English garden presented an idealized view of nature At large country houses, the English garden usually included lakes, sweeps of gently rolling lawns set against groves of trees, and recreations of classical temples, Gothic ruins, bridges, and other picturesque architecture, designed to recreate an idyllic pastoral landscape [243]\n\n\nFolklore\nEnglish folklore developed over many centuries Some of the characters and stories are present across England, but most belong to specific regions Common folkloric beings include pixies, giants, elves, bogeymen, trolls, goblins and dwarves While many legends and folk-customs are thought to be ancient, such as the tales featuring Offa of Angel and Wayland the Smith, [247] others date from after the Norman invasion The legends featuring Robin Hood and his Merry Men of Sherwood, and their battles with the Sheriff of Nottingham, are among the best-known of these [248]\n\n\nCuisine\nSince the early modern period the food of England has historically been characterised by its simplicity of approach and a reliance on the high quality of natural produce [256] During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, English cuisine enjoyed an excellent reputation, though a decline began during the Industrial Revolution with increasing urbanisation The cuisine of England has, however, recently undergone a revival, which has been recognised by food critics with some good ratings in Restaurant's best restaurant in the world charts [257]\n\nVisual arts\nThe earliest known examples are the prehistoric rock and cave art pieces, most prominent in North Yorkshire, Northumberland and Cumbria, but also feature further south, for example at Creswell Crags [262] With the arrival of Roman culture in the 1st century, various forms of art such as statues, busts, glasswork and mosaics were the norm There are numerous surviving artefacts, such as those at Lullingstone and Aldborough [263] During the Early Middle Ages the style favoured sculpted crosses and ivories, manuscript painting, gold and enamel jewellery, demonstrating a love of intricate, interwoven designs such as in the Staffordshire Hoard discovered in 2009 Some of these blended Gaelic and Anglian styles, such as the Lindisfarne Gospels and Vespasian Psalter [264] Later Gothic art was popular at Winchester and Canterbury, examples survive such as Benedictional of St Æthelwold and Luttrell Psalter [265]\n\n\nLiterature, poetry, and philosophy\nEarly authors such as Bede and Alcuin wrote in Latin [268] The period of Old English literature provided the epic poem Beowulf and the secular prose of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, [269] along with Christian writings such as Judith, Cædmon's Hymn and hagiographies [268] Following the Norman conquest Latin continued among the educated classes, as well as an Anglo-Norman literature.\n\n\nPerforming arts\nThe traditional folk music of England is centuries old and has contributed to several genres prominently; mostly sea shanties, jigs, hornpipes and dance music It has its own distinct variations and regional peculiarities Ballads featuring Robin Hood, printed by Wynkyn de Worde in the 16th century, are an important artefact, as are John Playford's The Dancing Master and Robert Harley's Roxburghe Ballads collections [279] Some of the best-known songs are Greensleeves, Pastime with Good Company, Maggie May and Spanish Ladies among others Many nursery rhymes are of English origin such as Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary, Roses Are Red, Jack and Jill, London Bridge Is Falling Down, The Grand Old Duke of York, Hey Diddle Diddle and Humpty Dumpty [280] Traditional English Christmas carols include \"We Wish You a Merry Christmas\", \"The First Noel\", \"I Saw Three Ships\" and \"God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen\".\n\n\nCinema\nEngland has had a considerable influence on the history of the cinema, producing some of the greatest actors, directors and motion pictures of all time, including Alfred Hitchcock, Charlie Chaplin, David Lean, Laurence Olivier, Vivien Leigh, John Gielgud, Peter Sellers, Julie Andrews, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Helen Mirren, Kate Winslet and Daniel Day-Lewis Hitchcock and Lean are among the most critically acclaimed filmmakers [294] Hitchcock's The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog (1926) helped shape the thriller genre in film, while his 1929 Blackmail is often regarded as the first British sound feature film [295]\n\n\nSites and institutions\nEnglish Heritage is a governmental body with a broad remit of managing the historic sites, artefacts and environments of England It is currently sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport A non-governmental charity, the National Trust holds a complementary role, focussed on landscapes and country houses 17 of the 25 United Kingdom UNESCO World Heritage Sites fall within England [305] Some of the best-known of these are: Hadrian's Wall, Stonehenge, Avebury and Associated Sites, the Tower of London, the Jurassic Coast, Saltaire, Ironbridge Gorge, Blenheim Palace and the Lake District [306]\n\n\nMedia\nThe BBC, founded in 1922, is the UK's publicly funded radio, television and Internet broadcasting corporation, and is the oldest and largest broadcaster in the world [319] [320] It operates numerous television and radio stations in the UK and abroad and its domestic services are funded by the television licence [321] [322] The BBC World Service is an international broadcaster owned and operated by the BBC It is the world's largest of any kind [323] It broadcasts radio news, speech and discussions in more than 40 languages [324] [325]\n\n\nSport\nEngland has a strong sporting heritage, and during the 19th century codified many sports that are now played around the world Sports originating in England include association football, [329] cricket, rugby union, rugby league, tennis, boxing, badminton, squash, [330] rounders, [331] hockey, snooker, billiards, darts, table tennis, bowls, netball, thoroughbred horseracing, greyhound racing and fox hunting It has helped the development of golf, sailing and Formula One England has been crowned world champion in several major sports including: Cricket, Rugby and Association Football.\n\n\nNational symbols\nThe St George's Cross has been the national flag of England since the 13th century Originally, the flag was used by the maritime Republic of Genoa The English monarch paid a tribute to the Doge of Genoa from 1190 onwards so that English ships could fly the flag as a means of protection when entering the Mediterranean.\nA red cross was a symbol for many Crusaders in the 12th and 13th centuries, and became associated with Saint George [354] Since 1606 the St George's Cross has formed part of the design of the Union Flag, a Pan-British flag designed by King James I [215] During the English Civil War and Interregnum, the New Model Army's standards and the Commonwealth's Great Seal both incorporated the flag of Saint George [355]

"**England**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nEngland is a country located in the southwestern part of Great Britain, within the United Kingdom. It is a unitary state, governed by the British government, and is often considered the birthplace of modern democracy. England has a rich history, with evidence of human presence dating back to the Mesolithic period. The country is home to a diverse range of cultures, landscapes, and wildlife, and is known for its vibrant cities, stunning coastline, and world-class education system.\n\n**Toponymy**\n\nThe name \"England\" is derived from the Old English name Englaland, which means \"land of the Angles.\" The Angles were one of the Germanic tribes that settled in Great Britain during the Early Middle Ages. They came from the Angeln region of what is now the German state of Schleswig-Holstein. The earliest recorded use of the term, as \"Engla londe,\" is in the late-ninth-century translation into Old English of Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People.\n\n**History**\n\nThe earliest known evidence of human presence in the area now known as England was that of Homo antecessor, dating to about 780,000 years ago. The oldest proto-human bones discovered in England date from 500,000 years ago. Modern humans are known to have inhabited the area during the Upper Paleolithic period, though permanent settlements were only established within the last 6,000 years.\n\n**Prehistory**\n\nThe earliest known evidence of human presence in the area now known as England was that of Homo antecessor, dating to about 780,000 years ago. The oldest proto-human bones discovered in England date from 500,000 years ago. Modern humans are known to have inhabited the area during the Upper Paleolithic period, though permanent settlements were only established within the last 6,000 years.\n\n**Ancient History**\n\nThe Romans invaded Britain in 43 AD during the reign of Emperor Claudius, subsequently conquering much of Britain, and the area was incorporated into the Roman Empire as Britannia province. The best-known of the native tribes who attempted to resist were the Catuvellauni led by Caratacus. Later, an uprising led by Boudica, Queen of the Iceni, ended with Boudica's suicide following her defeat at the Battle of Watling Street.\n\n**Middle Ages**\n\nRoman military withdrawals left Britain open to invasion by pagan, seafaring warriors from north-western continental Europe, chiefly the Saxons, Angles, Jutes, and Frisians, who had long raided the coasts of the Roman province. Their advance was contained for some decades after the Britons' victory at the Battle of Mount Badon, but subsequently resumed, overrunning the fertile lowlands of Britain and reducing the area under Brittonic control to a series of separate enclaves in the more rugged country to the west by the end of the 6th century.\n\n**Early Modern Period**\n\nDuring the Tudor period, England began to develop naval skills, and exploration intensified in the Age of Discovery. Henry VIII broke from communion with the Catholic Church, over issues relating to his divorce, under the Acts of Supremacy in 1534, which proclaimed the monarch head of the Church of England. In contrast with much of European Protestantism, the roots of the split were more political than theological.\n\n**Union with Scotland**\n\nThe political structure of the island changed in 1603, when the King of Scots, James VI, a kingdom which had been a long-time rival to English interests, inherited the throne of England as James I, thereby creating a personal union. Under the auspices of James VI and I, the Authorised King James Version of the Holy Bible was published in 1611, which was the standard version of the Bible read by most Protestant Christians for four hundred years.\n\n**Late Modern and Contemporary Periods**\n\nUnder the newly formed Kingdom of Great Britain, output from the Royal Society and other English initiatives combined with the Scottish Enlightenment to create innovations in science and engineering, while the enormous growth in British overseas trade protected by the Royal Navy paved the way for the establishment of the British Empire. Domestically, it drove the Industrial Revolution, a period of profound change in the socioeconomic and cultural conditions of England, resulting in industrialized agriculture, manufacture, engineering, and mining, as well as new and pioneering road, rail, and water networks to facilitate their expansion and development.\n\n**Governance**\n\nEngland is part of the United Kingdom, a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system. There has not been a government of England since 1707, when the Acts of Union 1707, putting into effect the terms of the Treaty of Union, joined England and Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain. Before the union, England was ruled by its monarch and the Parliament of England.\n\n**Law**\n\nThe English law legal system, developed over the centuries, is the basis of common law legal systems used in most Commonwealth countries and the United States (except Louisiana). Despite now being part of the United Kingdom, the legal system of the Courts of England and Wales continued, under the Treaty of Union, as a separate legal system from the one used in Scotland.\n\n**Subdivisions**\n\nThe subdivisions of England consist of up to four levels of subnational division, controlled through a variety of types of administrative entities created for the purposes of local government.\n\n**London**\n\nFrom 1994 until the early 2010s, England was divided for a few purposes into regions; a 1998 referendum for the London Region created the London Assembly two years later. A failed 2004 North East England devolution referendum cancelled further regional assembly devolution, with the regional structure outside London abolished.\n\n**Geography**\n\nGeographically, England includes the central and southern two-thirds of the island of Great Britain, plus such offshore islands as the Isle of Wight and the Isles of Scilly. It is bordered by two other countries of the United Kingdom: to the north by Scotland and to the west by Wales.\n\n**Landscape and Rivers**\n\nGeographically, England includes the central and southern two-thirds of the island of Great Britain, plus such offshore islands as the Isle of Wight and the Isles of Scilly. It is bordered by two other countries of the United Kingdom: to the north by Scotland and to the west by Wales.\n\n**Climate**\n\nEngland has a temperate maritime climate, with mild temperatures not much lower than 0°C (32°F) in winter and not much higher than 32°C (90°F) in summer. The weather is damp relatively frequently and is changeable.\n\n**Nature and Wildlife**\n\nThe fauna of England is similar to that of other areas in the British Isles, with a wide range of vertebrate and invertebrate life in a diverse range of habitats. National nature reserves in England are designated by Natural England as key places for wildlife and natural features in England.\n\n**Major Conurbations**\n\nThe Greater London Built-up Area is by far the largest urban area in England and one of the busiest cities in the world. It is considered a global city and has a population larger than any other country in the United Kingdom besides England itself. Other urban areas of considerable size and influence tend to be in northern England or the English Midlands.\n\n**Economy**\n\nEngland's economy is one of the largest and most dynamic in the world, with an average GDP per capita of £37,852 in 2022. HM Treasury, led by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is responsible for developing and executing the government's public finance policy and economic policy.\n\n**Science and Technology**\n\nProminent English figures from the field of science and mathematics include Sir Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Robert Hooke, Alan Turing, Stephen Hawking, Edward Jenner, Francis Crick, Joseph Lister, Joseph Priestley, Thomas Young, Christopher Wren, and Richard Dawkins.\n\n**Transport**\n\nThe Department for Transport is the government body responsible for overseeing transport in England. The department is run by the Secretary of State for Transport.\n\n**Energy**\n\nSuccessive governments have outlined numerous commitments to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Notably, the UK is one of the best sites in Europe for wind energy, and wind power production is its fastest-growing supply. Wind power contributed 26.8% of UK electricity generation in 2022.\n\n**Healthcare**\n\nThe National Health Service (NHS) is the publicly funded healthcare system responsible for providing the majority of healthcare in the country. The NHS began on 5 July 1948, putting into effect the provisions of the National Health Service Act 1946.\n\n**Demography**\n\nWith over 56 million inhabitants, England is by far the most populous country of the United Kingdom, accounting for 84% of the combined total. England taken as a unit and measured against international states would be the 26th largest country by population in the world.\n\n**Language**\n\nIn the 2011 census, 59.4% of the population of England specified their religion as Christian, 24.7% answered that they had no religion, 5% specified that they were Muslim, while 3.7% of the population belongs to other religions and 7.2% did not give an answer.\n\n**Education**\n\nThe Department for Education is the government department responsible for issues affecting people in England up to the age of 19, including education. State-funded schools are attended by about 93% of English schoolchildren.\n\n**Higher Education**\n\nHigher education students normally attend university from age 18 onwards, where they study for an academic degree. There are over 90 universities in England, all but one of which are public institutions.\n\n**Culture**\n\nMany ancient standing stone monuments were erected during the prehistoric period, including Stonehenge, Devil's Arrows, Rudston Monolith, and Castlerigg. With the introduction of Ancient Roman architecture, there was a development of basilicas, baths, amphitheaters, triumphal arches, villas, Roman temples, Roman roads, Roman forts, stockades, and aqueducts.\n\n**Gardens**\n\nLandscape gardening, as developed by Capability Brown, set an international trend for the English landscape garden.

of one study of Roman Britain suggested that from 43 AD to 84 AD, the Roman invaders killed somewhere between 100,000 and 250,000 people from a population of perhaps 2,000,000 [31] This era saw a Greco-Roman culture prevail with the introduction of Roman law, Roman architecture, aqueducts, sewers, many agricultural items and silk [32] In the 3rd century, Emperor Septimius Severus died at Eboracum (now York), where Constantine was subsequently proclaimed emperor a century later [33]\n\n\nMiddle Ages\nRoman military withdrawals left Britain open to invasion by pagan, seafaring warriors from north-western continental Europe, chiefly the Saxons, Angles, Jutes and Frisians who had long raided the coasts of the Roman province These groups then began to settle in increasing numbers over

subsequently resumed, overrunning the fertile lowlands of Britain and reducing the area under Brittonic control to a series of separate enclaves in the more rugged country to the west by the end of the 6th century Contemporary texts describing this period are extremely scarce, giving rise to its description as a Dark Age Details of the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain are consequently subject to considerable disagreement; the emerging consensus is that it occurred on a large scale in the south and east but was less substantial to the north and west, where Celtic languages continued to be spoken even in areas under Anglo-Saxon control [37] [38] Roman-dominated Christianity had, in general, been replaced in the conquered territories by Anglo-Saxon paganism, but was reintroduced by missionaries from Rome led by Augustine from 597 [39] Disputes between the Roman- and Celtic-dominated forms of Christianity ended in victory for the Roman tradition at the Council of Whitby (664), which was ostensibly about tonsures (clerical haircuts) and the date of Easter, but more significantly, about the differences in Roman and Celtic forms of authority, theology, and practice

the roots of the split were more political than theological [d] He also legally incorporated his ancestral land Wales into the Kingdom of England with the 1535–1542 acts There were internal religious conflicts during the reigns of Henry's daughters, Mary I and Elizabeth I The former took the country back to Catholicism while the latter broke from it again, forcefully asserting the supremacy of Anglicanism The Elizabethan era is the epoch in the Tudor age of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I (\"the Virgin Queen\") Historians often depict it as the golden age in English history that represented the apogee of the English Renaissance and saw the flowering of great art, drama, poetry, music and literature [53] England during this period had a centralised, well-organised, and effective government [54]\n\n\nUnion with Scotland\nThe political structure of the island changed in 1603, when the King of Scots, James VI, a kingdom which had been a long-time rival to English interests,

England as key places for wildlife and natural features in England They were established to protect the most significant areas of habitat and of geological formations NNRs are managed on behalf of the nation, many by Natural England themselves, but also by non-governmental organisations, including the members of The Wildlife Trusts partnership, the National Trust, and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds There are 221 NNRs in England covering 110,000 hectares (1,100 square kilometres) Often they contain rare species or nationally important populations of plants and animals [121]\n.\n\n\nMajor conurbations\nThe Greater London Built-up Area is by far the largest urban area in England [126] and one of the busiest cities in the world It is considered a global city and has a population larger than any other country in the United Kingdom besides England itself [126] Other urban areas of considerable size and influence tend to be in northern England or the English Midlands

2, the largest offshore wind farm in the world, situated in waters roughly 89 kilometres off the coast of Yorkshire [170]\n\n\nHealthcare\nThe National Health Service (NHS), is the publicly funded healthcare system responsible for providing the majority of healthcare in the country The NHS began on 5 July 1948, putting into effect the provisions of the National Health Service Act 1946 It was based on the findings of the Beveridge Report, prepared by the economist and social reformer, William Beveridge [177] The NHS is largely funded by general taxation and National Insurance payments; [178] it provides most of its services free at the point of use, although there are charges for some people for eye tests, dental care, prescriptions and aspects of personal care [179]\n\n\nDemography\nWith over 56 million inhabitants, England is by far the most populous country of the United Kingdom, accounting for 84% of the combined total [3] England taken as a unit and

well-preserved example is the Roman Baths at Bath, Somerset [236]\n\n\nGardens\nLandscape gardening, as developed by Capability Brown, set an international trend for the English landscape garden Gardening, and visiting gardens, are regarded as typically English pursuits The English garden presented an idealized view of nature At large country houses, the English garden usually included lakes, sweeps of gently rolling lawns set against groves of trees, and recreations of classical temples, Gothic ruins, bridges, and other picturesque architecture, designed to recreate an idyllic pastoral landscape [243]\n\n\nFolklore\nEnglish folklore developed over many centuries Some of the characters and stories are present across England, but most belong to specific regions Common folkloric beings include pixies, giants, elves, bogeymen, trolls, goblins and dwarves While many legends and folk-customs are thought to be ancient, such as the tales featuring Offa of Angel and Wayland the Smith, [247] others date from after the Norman invasion The legends featuring Robin Hood and his Merry Men of Sherwood, and their battles with the Sheriff of Nottingham, are among the best-known of these [248]\n\n\nCuisine\nSince the early modern period the food of England has historically been characterised by its simplicity of approach and a reliance on the high quality of natural produce [256] During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, English cuisine enjoyed an excellent reputation, though a decline began during the Industrial Revolution with increasing urbanisation The cuisine of England has, however, recently undergone a revival, which has been recognised by food critics with some good ratings in Restaurant's best restaurant in the world charts [257]\n\nVisual arts\nThe earliest known examples are the prehistoric rock and cave art pieces, most prominent in North Yorkshire, Northumberland and Cumbria, but also feature further south, for example at Creswell Crags [262] With the arrival of Roman culture in the 1st century, various forms of art such as statues, busts, glasswork and mosaics were the norm There are numerous surviving artefacts, such as those at Lullingstone and Aldborough [263] During the Early Middle Ages the style favoured sculpted crosses and ivories, manuscript painting, gold and enamel jewellery, demonstrating a love of intricate, interwoven designs such as in the Staffordshire Hoard discovered in 2009 Some of these blended Gaelic and Anglian styles, such as the Lindisfarne Gospels and Vespasian Psalter [264] Later Gothic art was popular at Winchester and Canterbury, examples survive such as Benedictional of St Æthelwold and Luttrell Psalter [265]\n\n\nLiterature, poetry, and philosophy\nEarly authors such as Bede and Alcuin wrote in Latin [268] The period of Old English literature provided the epic poem Beowulf and the secular prose of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, [269] along with Christian writings such as Judith, Cædmon's Hymn and hagiographies [268] Following the Norman conquest Latin continued among the educated classes, as well as an Anglo-Norman literature.\n\n\nPerforming arts\nThe traditional folk music of England is centuries old and has contributed to several genres prominently; mostly sea shanties, jigs, hornpipes and dance music It has its own distinct variations and regional peculiarities Ballads featuring Robin Hood, printed by Wynkyn de Worde in the 16th century, are an important artefact, as are John Playford's The Dancing Master and Robert Harley's Roxburghe Ballads collections [279] Some of the best-known songs are Greensleeves, Pastime with Good Company, Maggie May and Spanish Ladies among others Many nursery rhymes are of English origin such as Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary, Roses Are Red, Jack and Jill, London Bridge Is Falling Down, The Grand Old Duke of York, Hey Diddle Diddle and Humpty Dumpty [280] Traditional English Christmas carols include \"We Wish You a Merry Christmas\", \"The First Noel\", \"I Saw Three Ships\" and \"God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen\".\n\n\nCinema\nEngland has had a considerable influence on the history of the cinema, producing some of the greatest actors, directors and motion pictures of all time, including Alfred Hitchcock, Charlie Chaplin, David Lean, Laurence Olivier, Vivien Leigh, John Gielgud, Peter Sellers, Julie Andrews, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Helen Mirren, Kate Winslet and Daniel Day-Lewis Hitchcock and Lean are among the most critically acclaimed filmmakers [294] Hitchcock's The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog (1926) helped shape the thriller genre in film, while his 1929 Blackmail is often regarded as the first British sound feature film [295]\n\n\nSites and institutions\nEnglish Heritage is a governmental body with a broad remit of managing the historic sites, artefacts and environments of England It is currently sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport A non-governmental charity, the National Trust holds a complementary role, focussed on landscapes and country houses 17 of the 25 United Kingdom UNESCO World Heritage Sites fall within England [305] Some of the best-known of these are: Hadrian's Wall, Stonehenge, Avebury and Associated Sites, the Tower of London, the Jurassic Coast, Saltaire, Ironbridge Gorge, Blenheim Palace and the Lake District [306]\n\n\nMedia\nThe BBC, founded

century codified many sports that are now played around the world Sports originating in England include association football, [329] cricket, rugby union, rugby league, tennis, boxing, badminton, squash, [330] rounders, [331] hockey, snooker, billiards, darts, table tennis, bowls, netball, thoroughbred horseracing, greyhound racing and fox hunting It has helped the development of golf, sailing and Formula One England has been crowned world champion in several major sports including: Cricket, Rugby and Association Football.\n\n\nNational symbols\nThe St George's Cross has been the national flag of England since the 13th century Originally, the flag was used by the maritime Republic of Genoa The English monarch paid a tribute to the Doge of Genoa from 1190 onwards so that English ships could fly the flag as a means of protection when entering the Mediterranean.\nA red cross was a symbol for many Crusaders in the 12th and 13th centuries, and became associated with Saint George [354] Since 1606 the St George's Cross has formed part of the design of the Union Flag, a Pan-British flag designed by King James I [215] During the English Civil War and Interregnum, the New Model Army's standards and the Commonwealth's Great Seal both incorporated the flag of Saint George [355] [356]\n\n\nSee also\n53°08′N 1°23′W﻿ / ﻿53.13°N 1.38°W﻿ / 53.13; -1.38\n\n\nNotes\n53°08′N 1°23′W﻿ /

[26]\n\n\nActivities in Australia and New Zealand\nFollowing his father's death, when he was 21, Murdoch returned from Oxford to take charge of what was left of the family business After liquidation of his father's Herald stake to pay taxes, what was left was News Limited, which had been established in 1923 [23]: 16  Rupert Murdoch turned its Adelaide newspaper, The News, its main asset, into a major success [30] He began to direct his attention to acquisition and expansion, buying the troubled Sunday Times in Perth, Western Australia (1956) and over the next few years acquiring suburban and provincial newspapers in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and the Northern Territory, including the Sydney afternoon tabloid The Daily Mirror (1960) The Economist describes Murdoch as \"inventing the modern tabloid\", [34] as he developed a pattern for his newspapers, increasing sports and scandal coverage and adopting eye-catching headlines [4]\n\n\nPolitical activities in Australia\nMurdoch found a political ally in Sir John McEwen, leader of the Australian Country Party (now known as the National Party of Australia), who was governing in coalition with the larger Menzies-Holt-Gorton Liberal Party From the first issue of The Australian, Murdoch began taking McEwen's side in every issue that divided the long-serving coalition partners (The Australian, 15 July 1964, first edition, front page: \"Strain in Cabinet, Liberal-CP row flares.\") It was an issue that threatened to split the coalition government and open the way for the stronger Australian Labor Party to dominate Australian politics It was the beginning of a long campaign that served McEwen well [42]\n\n\nActivities in the United Kingdom\nIn 1968, Murdoch entered the British newspaper market with his acquisition of the populist News of the World, followed in 1969 with the purchase of the struggling daily The Sun from IPC [50] Murdoch turned The Sun into a tabloid format and reduced costs by using

success and expansion at The Sun the owners believed that Murdoch could turn the papers around Harold Evans, editor of the Sunday Times from 1967, was switched to the daily Times, though he stayed only a year amid editorial conflict with Murdoch [52] [53]\n\n\nBusiness activities in the United Kingdom\nIn 1968, Murdoch entered the British newspaper market with his acquisition of the populist

His music career spanned over two decades, leaving a lasting impact on the metal genre. Laiho's unique blend of classical, black, and power metal influences, combined with his technical guitar skills, made him a respected figure in the music world.\n\n## Career\n\nLaiho started playing the violin at the age of seven and the guitar at eleven. His early musical influences were rooted in classic metal bands such as Manowar, Helloween, Judas Priest, and W.A.S.P. As he grew older, Laiho became increasingly interested in more extreme forms of metal, particularly black metal. This transition marked the beginning of his tenure with Children of Bodom, which he formed in 1993 with his friends Janne Wirman, Sami Vänskä, and Alexander \"Alexi\" Laiho.\n\n## Musical Style and Influences\n\nLaiho's musical style was shaped by a diverse array of influences. His main guitar influences were classic metal bands like Helloween, which he often credited as a primary inspiration. However, his music also drew from black metal, power metal, and classical music. This blend of styles resulted in a unique sound that was both aggressive and melodic.\n\nLaiho's guitar playing was characterized by blistering solos that showcased his technical proficiency. He often engaged in guitar-keyboard duels with Janne Wirman, Children of Bodom's keyboardist, which added an extra layer of complexity to their music. Laiho's early works also incorporated various references to classical music, further demonstrating his eclecticism.\n\n## Awards and Recognition\n\nThroughout his career, Laiho received widespread recognition and accolades. He was often described as a visionary who brought back melody and flamboyance to metal music in a post-grunge and nu metal era.

The couple shared identical tattoos of a coiled snake around their ring fingers and had each other's initials tattooed on the upper part of their left arms. However, in November 2002, Laiho filed for divorce, only to withdraw the application later. The couple eventually separated in 2004, but remained on good terms until Laiho's passing.\n\nIn the years following Laiho's death, drama and infighting between his sister and widow resulted in a public back-and-forth exchange, with both parties airing their grievances to the Finnish media. Despite these personal struggles, Laiho's music legacy continues to be celebrated by fans around the world.\n\n## Discography\n\nChildren of Bodom's discography is extensive, spanning over two decades. Some of their most notable albums include:\n\n* \"Something Wild\" (1997)\n* \"Hate Crew Deathroll\" (2003)\n* \"Are You Dead Yet?\" (2005)\n* \"Blooddrunk\" (2008)\n* \"Relentless Reckless Forever\" (2011)\n\nThese albums showcase Laiho's unique blend of melodic death metal and his technical guitar skills, cementing his status as a respected figure in the metal genre.\n\nIn conclusion, Alexi Laiho was a Finnish musician who left a lasting impact on the metal genre with his unique blend of classical, black, and power metal influences. His technical guitar skills and melodic voice made him a respected figure in the music world.

{"title": "Havana", "content": "\nEtymology\nIn 1514, Diego Velázquez founded the city San Cristóbal de la Habana, which meant \"Saint Christopher of the Habana\" and later became the capital of Cuba Habana was the name of the local people group It has been theorized that the name derived from Habaguanex, who was a chief of the Native American tribe His name is Taíno, an Arawakan language, but nothing else is known When Habana was adapted into English, the ⟨b⟩ was switched to a ⟨v⟩ because of a linguistic phenomenon known as betacism, which is a confusion between the voiced bilabial plosive and voiced labiodental fricative sounds that occurs in most modern Spanish dialects Usage of the word Havana in literature understandably peaked during the Spanish–American War, but it also represents a type of cigar, a color, and a type of rabbit as well as the city [21] Havana is the prevailing name for the city found in English-language dictionaries.\n\n\nHistory\nDiego Velázquez de Cuéllar founded Havana in 1514, on the southern coast of the island, near the present town of Surgidero de Batabanó on the banks of the Mayabeque River close to Playa Mayabeque However, all attempts to found a city on Cuba's south coast failed; an early map of Cuba drawn in 1514 places the town at the mouth of the river [22] [23]\n\n\n16th century\nDiego Velázquez de Cuéllar founded Havana in 1514, on the southern coast of the island, near the present town of Surgidero de Batabanó on the banks of the Mayabeque River close to Playa Mayabeque However, all attempts to found a city on Cuba's south coast failed; an early map of Cuba drawn in 1514 places the town at the mouth of the river [22] [23]\n\n\n17th century\nHavana expanded greatly in the 17th century New buildings were constructed from the most abundant materials of the island, mainly wood, combining various Iberian architectural styles, as well as borrowing profusely from Canarian characteristics During this period the city also built civic monuments and religious constructions The convent of St Augustin, El Morro Castle, the chapel of the Humilladero, the fountain of Dorotea de la Luna in La Chorrera, the church of the Holy Angel, the hospital de San Lázaro, the monastery of Santa Teresa and the convent of San Felipe Neri were completed in this era.\n\n\n18th century\nDuring the 18th century Havana was the most important of the Spanish ports because it had facilities where ships could be refitted and, by 1740, it had become Spain's largest and most active shipyard and only drydock in the New World [26]\n\n\n19th century\nAs trade between Caribbean and North American states increased in the early 19th century, Havana became a flourishing and fashionable city Havana's theaters featured the most distinguished actors of the age, and prosperity among the burgeoning middle-class led to expensive new classical mansions being erected During this period Havana became known as the Paris of the Antilles.\n\n\n20th century\nCuba's first presidential period under Tomás Estrada Palma from 1902 to 1906 was considered to uphold the highest standards of administrative integrity in the history of the Republic of Cuba [31]\n\n\n21st century\nAfter many years of economic struggle and prohibition, the socialist government has turned to tourism for revenue and has brought foreign investors to remodel the nationalized, former Manzana de Gomez building, and turn it into the Gran Hotel Manzana Kempinski La Habana, a new 5-star hotel attempting to develop a new hospitality industry In Old Havana, a number of streets and squares have been rehabilitated in an effort to rebuild for tourists [36] But Old Havana is a large city, and the restoration efforts concentrate in all on less than 10% of its area.\n\n\nAdministration\nThe governor is Reinaldo García Zapata, [13] he was elected on 18 January 2020 [12]\n\n\nGeography\nHavana lies on the northern coast of Cuba along the Straits of Florida, south of the Florida Keys, where the Gulf of Mexico joins the Atlantic Ocean The city extends mostly westward and southward from the bay, which is entered through a narrow inlet and which divides into three main harbors: Marimelena, Guanabacoa, and Atarés The Almendares River traverses the city from south to north, entering the Straits of Florida a few miles west of the bay [citation needed]\n\n\nLocation\nHavana lies on the northern coast of Cuba along the Straits of Florida, south of the Florida Keys, where the Gulf of Mexico joins the Atlantic Ocean The city extends mostly westward and southward from the bay, which is entered through a narrow inlet and which divides into three main harbors: Marimelena, Guanabacoa, and Atarés The Almendares River traverses the city from south to north, entering the Straits of Florida a few miles west of the bay [citation needed]\n\n\nClimate\nHavana has a tropical climate that is tempered by the island's position in the belt of the trade winds and by the warm offshore currents [clarification needed] Under the Köppen climate classification, Havana has a tropical savanna climate (Aw) that closely borders on a tropical rainforest climate (Af) and a tropical monsoon climate (Am) Average temperatures range from 22 °C (72 °F) in January and February to 28 °C (82 °F) in August The temperature seldom drops below 10 °C (50 °F) The lowest temperature was 1 °C (34 °F) in Santiago de Las Vegas, Boyeros The lowest recorded temperature in Cuba was 0 °C (32 °F) in Bainoa, Mayabeque Province (before 2011 the eastern part of Havana province) Rainfall is heaviest in June and October and lightest from December through April, averaging 1,200 mm (47 in) annually Hurricanes occasionally strike the island, but they ordinarily hit the south coast, and damage in Havana has been less than elsewhere in the country [15] The most recent tropical cyclone to come near Havana at hurricane strength was Ian in 2022.\n\n\nMunicipalities\nThe city is divided into 15 municipalities [48] – or boroughs, which are further subdivided into 105 consejos populares (wards) [49]\n\n\nDemography\nBy the end of 2012 official Census, 19.1% of the population of Cuba lived in Havana [7] According to the census of 2012, the population was 2,106,146 [7] The city has an average life expectancy of 76.81 years at birth [7] In 2009, there were 1,924 people living with HIV/AIDS in the city, 78.9% of these are men, and 21.1% being women [50]\n\n\nEthnic breakdown\nAccording to the 2012 national census of Havana's population (the Cuban census and similar studies use the term \"skin color\" instead of \"race\") [7]\n\n\nReligion\nRoman Catholics form the largest religious group in Havana Havana is one of the three Metropolitan sees on the island (the others being Camagüey and Santiago), with two suffragan bishoprics: Matanzas and Pinar del Río Its patron saint is San Cristóbal (Saint Christopher), to whom the cathedral is devoted it also has a minor basilica, Basílica Santuario Nacional de Nuestra Señora de la Caridad del Cobre and two other national shrines, Jesús Nazareno del Rescate and San Lázaro (El Rincón) It received papal visits from three successive supreme pontiffs: Pope John Paul II (January 1998), Pope Benedict XVI (March 2012) and Pope Francis (September 2015).\n\n\nEconomy\nHavana has a diversified economy, with traditional sectors, such as manufacturing, construction, transportation and communications, and new or revived ones such as biotechnology and tourism [citation needed]\n\n\nCommerce and finance\nAfter the Revolution, Cuba's traditional capitalist free-enterprise system was replaced by a heavily socialized economic system In Havana, Cuban-owned businesses and U.S.-owned businesses were nationalized and today most businesses operate solely under state control [citation needed]\n\n\nTourism\nThe city has long been a popular attraction for tourists Between 1915 and 1930, Havana hosted more tourists than any other location in the Caribbean [71] The influx was due in large part to Cuba's proximity to the United States, where restrictive prohibition on alcohol and other pastimes stood in stark contrast to the island's traditionally relaxed attitude to leisure pursuits A pamphlet published by E.C Kropp Co., Milwaukee, WI, between 1921 and 1939 promoting tourism in Havana, Cuba, can be found in the University of Houston Digital Library, Havana, Cuba, The Summer Land of the World, Digital Collection [citation needed]\n\n\nPoverty and slums\nThe years after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the city, and Cuba in general have suffered decades of economic deterioration, including Special Period of the 1990s [77] The national government does not have an official definition of poverty [78] The government researchers argue that \"poverty\" in most commonly accepted meanings does not really exist in Cuba, but rather that there is a sector of the population that can be described as \"at risk\" or \"vulnerable\" using internationally accepted measures [78]\n\n\nTransport\nHavana is served by José Martí International Airport The Airport lies about 11 kilometers (7 mi) south of the city center, in the municipality of Boyeros, and is the main hub for the country's flag carrier Cubana de Aviación The airport is Cuba's main international and domestic gateway, it connects Havana with the rest of the Caribbean, North, Central and South America, Europe and one destination in Africa.\n\n\nAirports\nHavana is served by José Martí International

Cuba's main international and domestic gateway, it connects Havana with the rest of the Caribbean, North, Central and South America, Europe and one destination in Africa.\n\n\nRail\nHavana has a network of suburban, interurban and long-distance rail lines The railways are nationalized and run by the FFCC (Ferrocarriles de Cuba – Railways of Cuba) The FFCC connects Havana with all the provinces of Cuba, and the Havana Suburban Railway serves the city The main railway stations are: Central Rail Station, La Coubre Rail Station, Casablanca Station, and Estación de Tulipán.\n\n\nInterurban\nAn interurban line, [a] known as the Hershey Electric Railway, built in 1917 runs from Casablanca (across the harbor from Old Havana) to Hershey and on to Matanzas [82]\n\n\nTramway\nHavana operated a tram system until 1952, which began as a horsecar system, Ferro Carril Urbano de la Habana in 1858, [83] merged with rival coach operator in 1863 as Empresa del Ferro-Carril Urbano y Omnibus de La Habana and later electrified in 1900 under new foreign owners as Havana Electric Railway Company [84] Ridership decline resulted in bankruptcy in 1950 with new owner Autobus Modernos SA abandoning the systems in favor of buses and the remaining cars were sold to Matanzas in 1952 [citation needed]\n\n\nRoads\nThe city's road network is quite extensive, and has broad avenues, main streets and major access roads to the city such as the Autopista Nacional (A1), Carretera Central and Via Blanca The road network has been under construction and growth since the Spanish era but is undergoing a major deterioration due to low maintenance [85]\nMotorways (autopistas) include:\n\n\nEducation\nThe national government assumes all responsibility for education, and there are adequate primary, secondary, and vocational training schools throughout Cuba The schools are of varying quality and education is free and compulsory at all levels except higher learning, which is also free.\n\n\nLandmarks and historical centers\nThe coat of arms of Havana consists of three castles that represent the three castles that defended the city: the Fuerza Castle, the Morro Castle and the Punta Castle The key represents that Havana was the gateway to the New World The shield, supported by an oak branch on one side and a laurel wreath on the other, symbolizes the strength of the nation, the laurel wreath, honor, and glory These symbols represent the rights of man [88]\n\n\nCulture\nThe coat of arms of Havana consists of three castles that represent the three castles

of man [88]\n\n\nArchitecture\nHavana has diverse styles of architecture, from castles built in the 16th century, to modernist high-rise buildings.\nThe present condition of many structures have deteriorated since 1959 or have been demolished, including the demolition of the Plaza del Vapor, built in 1835 by the architect of the Palacio de la Marquesa de Villalba, Eugenio Rayneri Sorrentino, the father of Eugenio Rayneri Piedra the architect of the El Capitolio of 1929 The Plaza del Vapor was demolished in 1959 by the new, revolutionary government [b] [c] Numerous building collapses throughout the city have resulted in injuries and deaths due to a lack of maintenance [91] [92]\n\n\nSpanish\nRiches were brought from the Spanish into and through Havana as it was a key transshipment point between the new world and old world As a result, Havana was the most heavily fortified city in the Americas Most examples of early architecture can be seen in military fortifications such as La Fortaleza de San Carlos de la Cabana (1558–1577) designed by Battista Antonelli and the Castillo del Morro (1589–1630) This sits at the entrance of Havana Bay and provides an insight into the supremacy and wealth at that time.\n\n\nNeoclassical\nNeoclassism was introduced into the city in the 1840s, at the time including Gas public lighting in 1848 and the railroad in 1837 In the second half of the 18th century, sugar and coffee production increased rapidly, which became essential in the development of Havana's most prominent architectural style Many wealthy Habaneros took their inspiration from the French; this can be seen within the interiors of upper-class houses such as the Aldama Palace built in 1844 This is considered the most important neoclassical residential building in Cuba and typifies the design of many houses of this period with portales of neoclassical columns facing open spaces or courtyards.\n\n\nArt deco\nThe Bacardi Building (Edificio Bacardí) is Havana landmark designed by the architects Esteban Rodríguez-Castells and Rafael Fernández Ruenes and completed in 1930 [100] It is located on the corner of Calles Monserrate and San Juan de Dios on a 1,320 sq meter lot in Las Murallas, Old Havana The building is in the art deco style that was popular internationally in the early decades of the 20th century The Bacardi Building was designed to be the headquarters for the Bacardi Rum Company; it was nationalized by the Castro government in the early 1960s In 2001, the building was restored by an Italian construction firm The interior retains the original decorations in marble and granite It is regarded as one of the finest Art Deco buildings in Latin America [101]\n\n\nModernism\nKnown by buildings of high-quality, modernist architecture transformed much of the city Examples are the Havana Hilton Hotel of (1958), the Radiocentro CMQ Building of 1955 by Martín Domínguez Esteban architect of the FOCSA Building in 1956, and the Edificio del Seguro Médico, Havana by Antonio Quintana Simonetti [citation needed]\n\n\nCityscape\nContemporary Havana can essentially be described as three cities in one: Old Havana, Vedado, and the newer suburban districts [15] Old Havana, with its narrow streets and overhanging balconies, is the traditional centre of part of Havana's commerce, industry, and entertainment, as well as being a residential area.\n\n\nVisual arts\nThe Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes de La Habana is a Fine Arts museum that exhibits Cuban and international art The museum houses one of the largest collections of paintings and sculpture from Latin America and is the largest in the Caribbean region [117] Under the Cuban Ministry of Culture, it occupies two locations in the vicinity of Havana's Paseo del Prado, these are the Palace of Fine Arts, devoted to Cuban art and the Palace of the Asturian Center, dedicated to universal art [118] Its artistic heritage is made up of over 45,000 pieces [119] Since 1995 the capital hosts the headquarters of the Ludwig Foundation of Cuba in Vedado, founded by the German collectors Peter and Irene Ludwig, it is a non-governmental and non-profit organization for the dissemination and protection of Cuban art.\nNotable artists associated with the city include Federico Beltrán Masses, [120] [121] Víctor Manuel García Valdés, [122] [123] and Wifredo Lam [124] [125]\n\n\nPerforming arts\nFacing Havana's Central Park is the baroque Gran Teatro de La Habana, a prominent theater built in 1837 [126] It is now home of the National Ballet of Cuba and the International Ballet Festival of Havana, one of the oldest in the New World The façade of the building is adorned with a stone and marble statue There are also sculptural pieces by Giuseppe Moretti, [127] representing allegories depicting benevolence, education, music and theater The principal theater is the García Lorca Auditorium, with seats for 1,500 and balconies Glories of its rich history; the Italian tenor Enrico Caruso sang, the Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova danced, and the French Sarah Bernhardt acted.\n\n\nRadio and television\nCMQ was a Cuban radio and television station located in Havana, Cuba, reaching an audience in the 1940s and 1950s, attracting viewers and listeners with a program that ranged from music and news dissemination It later expanded into radio and television networks As a radio network it was a heated competitor of the RHC-Cadena Azul network.\nThe company was founded on March 12, 1933, by Miguel Gabriel and Ángel Cambó Ten years later, on August 1, 1943, half of it was acquired by the business group of Goar Mestre In the beginning, it transmitted only in the capital expanding later to the rest of the country.\n\n\nCMQ\nCMQ was a Cuban radio and

residents have free access to health care in hospitals, [137] local polyclinics, and neighborhood family doctors who serve on average 170 families each, [138] which is one of the highest doctor-to-patient ratio in the world [139] However, the health system has suffered from shortages of supplies, equipment and medications caused by ending of the Soviet Union subsidies in the early 1990s and the US embargo [140] Nevertheless, Havana's infant mortality rate in 2009 was 4.9 per 1,000 live births, [7] 5.12 in the country as a whole, which is lower than many developed nations, [141] [142] and the lowest in the developing world [141] [142] [143] Administration of the health care system for the nation is centered largely in Havana Hospitals in Havana are run by the national government, and citizens are assigned hospitals and clinics to which they may go for attention [citation needed]\n\n\nSports\nMany Cubans are avid sports fans who particularly favor baseball Havana's

With a rich cultural heritage and a blend of Spanish, African, and Caribbean influences, Havana is a unique and fascinating city that has captivated visitors for centuries. This article provides an overview of the history, geography, culture, and attractions of Havana, as well as its economic and social development.\n\nEtymology\nThe name \"Havana\" is believed to have originated from the Taíno chief Habaguanex, who was the ruler of the region in the early 16th century. The city was founded in 1514 by Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar, a Spanish conquistador, and was initially named San Cristóbal de la Habana. Over time, the name was shortened to Havana, which has been the prevailing name for the city in English-language dictionaries.\n\nHistory\n## 16th century\nDiego Velázquez de Cuéllar founded Havana in 1514, on the southern coast of the island, near the present town of Surgidero de Batabanó on the banks of the Mayabeque River close to Playa Mayabeque However, all attempts to found a city on Cuba's south coast failed; an early map of Cuba drawn in 1514 places the town at the mouth of the river\n\n## 17th century\nHavana expanded greatly in the 17th century. New buildings were constructed from the most abundant materials of the island, mainly wood, combining various Iberian architectural styles, as well as borrowing profusely from Canarian characteristics During this period the city also built civic monuments and religious constructions The convent of St Augustin, El Morro Castle, the chapel of the Humilladero, the fountain of Dorotea de la Luna in La Chorrera, the church of the Holy Angel, the hospital de San Lázaro, the monastery of Santa Teresa and the convent of San Felipe Neri were completed in this era\n\n## 18th century\nDuring the 18th century Havana was the most important of the Spanish ports because it had facilities where ships could be refitted and, by 1740, it had become Spain's largest and most active shipyard and only drydock in the New World\n\n## 19th century\nAs trade between Caribbean and North American states increased in the early 19th century, Havana became a flourishing and fashionable city Havana's theaters featured the most distinguished actors of the age, and prosperity among the burgeoning middle-class led to expensive new classical mansions being erected During this period Havana became known as the Paris of the Antilles\n\n## 20th century\nCuba's first presidential period under Tomás Estrada Palma from 1902 to 1906 was considered to uphold the highest standards of administrative integrity in the history of the Republic of Cuba\n\n## 21st century\nAfter many years of economic struggle and prohibition, the socialist government has turned to tourism for revenue and has brought foreign investors to remodel the nationalized, former Manzana de Gomez building, and turn it into the Gran Hotel Manzana Kempinski La Habana, a new 5-star hotel attempting to develop a new hospitality industry In Old Havana, a number of streets and squares have been rehabilitated in an effort to rebuild for tourists But Old Havana is a large city, and the restoration efforts concentrate in all on less than 10% of its area\n\nAdministration\nThe governor is Reinaldo García Zapata, who was elected on 18 January 2020\n\nGeography\nHavana lies on the northern coast of Cuba along the Straits of Florida, south of the Florida Keys, where the Gulf of Mexico joins the Atlantic Ocean The city extends mostly westward and southward from the bay, which is entered through a narrow inlet and which divides into three main harbors: Marimelena, Guanabacoa, and Atarés The Almendares River traverses the city from south to north, entering the Straits of Florida a few miles west of the bay\n\nClimate\nHavana has a tropical climate that is tempered by the island's position in the belt of the trade winds and by the warm offshore currents Under the Köppen climate classification, Havana has a tropical savanna climate (Aw) that closely borders on a tropical rainforest climate (Af) and a tropical monsoon climate (Am) Average temperatures range from 22°C (72°F) in January and February to 28°C (82°F) in August The temperature seldom drops below 10°C (50°F) The lowest temperature was 1°C (34°F) in Santiago de Las Vegas, Boyeros The lowest recorded temperature in Cuba was 0°C (32°F) in Bainoa, Mayabeque Province (before 2011 the eastern part of Havana province) Rainfall is heaviest in June and October and lightest from December through April, averaging 1,200 mm (47 in) annually Hurricanes occasionally strike the island, but they ordinarily hit the south coast, and damage in Havana has been less than elsewhere in the country The most recent tropical cyclone to come near Havana at hurricane strength was Ian in 2022\n\nMunicipalities\nThe city is divided into 15 municipalities, which are further subdivided into 105 consejos populares (wards)\n\nDemography\nBy the end of 2012,

diversified economy, with traditional sectors, such as manufacturing, construction, transportation and communications, and new or revived ones such as biotechnology and tourism\n\nCommerce and finance\nAfter the Revolution, Cuba's traditional capitalist free-enterprise system was replaced by a heavily socialized economic system In Havana, Cuban-owned businesses and U.S.-owned businesses were nationalized and today most businesses operate solely under state control\n\nTourism\nThe city has long been a popular attraction for tourists Between 1915 and 1930, Havana hosted more tourists than any other location in the Caribbean The influx was due in large part to Cuba's proximity to the United States, where restrictive prohibition on alcohol and other pastimes stood in stark contrast to the island's traditionally relaxed attitude to leisure pursuits\n\nPoverty and slums\nThe years after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the city, and Cuba in general, have suffered decades of economic deterioration, including the Special Period of the 1990s The national government does not have an official definition of poverty The government researchers argue that \"poverty\" in most commonly accepted meanings does not really exist in Cuba, but rather that there is a sector of the population that can be described as \"at risk\" or \"vulnerable\" using internationally accepted measures\n\nTransport\nHavana is served by José Martí International Airport The Airport lies about 11 kilometers (7 mi) south of the city center, in the municipality of Boyeros, and is the main hub

and on to Matanzas\n\nTramway\nHavana operated a tram system until 1952, which began as a horsecar system, Ferro Carril Urbano de la Habana in 1858, merged with rival coach operator in 1863 as Empresa del Ferro-Carril Urbano y Omnibus de La Habana and later electrified in 1900 under new foreign owners as Havana Electric Railway Company Ridership decline resulted in bankruptcy in 1950 with new owner Autobus Modernos SA abandoning the systems in favor of buses and the remaining cars were sold to Matanzas in 1952\n\nRoads\nThe city's road network is quite extensive, and has broad avenues, main streets and major access roads to the city such as the Autopista Nacional (A1), Carretera Central and Via Blanca The road network has been under construction and growth since the Spanish era but is undergoing a major deterioration due to low maintenance\n\nMotorways (autopistas) include:\n* Autopista Nacional (A1)\n* Autopista del Este (A3)\n* Autopista del Sur (A5)\n\nEducation\nThe national government assumes all responsibility for education, and there are adequate primary, secondary, and vocational training schools throughout Cuba The schools are of varying quality and education is free

de Villalba, Eugenio Rayneri Sorrentino, the father of Eugenio Rayneri Piedra the architect of the El Capitolio of 1929 The Plaza del Vapor was demolished in 1959 by the new, revolutionary government\n\nSpanish\nRiches were brought from the Spanish into and through Havana as it was a key transshipment point between the new world and old world As a result, Havana was the most heavily fortified city in the Americas Most examples of early architecture can be seen in military fortifications such as La Fortaleza de San Carlos de la Cabana (1558–1577) designed by Battista Antonelli and the Castillo del Morro (1589–1630) This sits at the entrance of Havana Bay and provides an insight into the supremacy and wealth at that time\n\nNeoclassical\nNeoclassism was introduced into the city in the 1840s, at the time including Gas public lighting in 1848 and the railroad in 1837 In the second half of the 18th century, sugar and coffee production increased rapidly, which became essential in the development of Havana's most prominent architectural style Many wealthy Habaneros took their inspiration from the French; this can be seen within the interiors of upper-class houses such as the Aldama Palace built in 1844 This is considered the most important neoclassical residential building in Cuba and typifies the design of many houses of this period with portales of neoclassical columns facing open spaces or courtyards\n\nArt deco\nThe Bacardi Building (Edificio Bacardí) is Havana landmark designed by the architects Esteban Rodríguez-Castells and Rafael Fernández Ruenes and completed in 1930 It is located on the corner of Calles Monserrate and San Juan de Dios on a 1,320 sq meter lot in Las Murallas, Old Havana The building is in the art deco style that was popular internationally in the early decades of the 20th century The Bacardi Building was designed to be the headquarters for the Bacardi Rum Company; it was nationalized by the Castro government in the early 1960s In 2001, the building was restored by an Italian construction firm The interior retains the original decorations in marble and granite It is regarded as one of the finest Art Deco buildings in Latin America\n\nModernism\nKnown by buildings of high-quality, modernist architecture transformed much of the city Examples are the Havana Hilton Hotel of (1958), the Radiocentro CMQ Building of 1955 by Martín Domínguez Esteban architect of the FOCSA Building in 1956, and the Edificio del Seguro Médico, Havana by Antonio Quintana Simonetti\n\nCityscape\nContemporary Havana can essentially be

Italian tenor Enrico Caruso sang, the Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova danced, and the French Sarah Bernhardt acted\n\nRadio and television\nCMQ was a Cuban radio and television station located in Havana, Cuba, reaching an audience in the 1940s and 1950s, attracting viewers and listeners with a program that ranged from music and news dissemination It later expanded into radio and television networks As a radio network it was a heated competitor of the RHC-Cadena Azul network The company was founded on March 12, 1933, by Miguel Gabriel and Ángel Cambó Ten years later, on August 1, 1943,

the city San Cristóbal de la Habana, which meant \"Saint Christopher of the Habana\" and later became the capital of Cuba Habana was the name of the local people group It has been theorized that the name derived from Habaguanex, who was a chief of the Native American tribe His name is Taíno, an Arawakan language, but nothing else is known When Habana was adapted into English, the ⟨b⟩ was switched to a ⟨v⟩ because of a linguistic phenomenon known as betacism, which is a confusion between the voiced bilabial plosive and voiced labiodental fricative sounds that occurs in most modern Spanish dialects Usage of the word Havana in literature understandably peaked during the Spanish–American War, but it also represents a type of cigar, a color, and a type of rabbit as well as the city [21]

role from Godzilla: King of the Monsters.\n\n\nProduction\nPersonnel taken from the press release [32]\n\n\nCrew\nPersonnel taken from the press release [32]\n\n\nDevelopment\nIn September 2015, Legendary moved Kong: Skull Island from Universal to Warner Bros., which sparked media speculation that Godzilla and King Kong would appear in a film together [33] [34] In October 2015, Legendary confirmed that they would unite Godzilla and King Kong in Godzilla vs Kong, at the time targeted for a May 29, 2020, release Legendary plans to create a shared cinematic franchise \"centered around Monarch\" that \"brings together Godzilla and Legendary's King Kong in an ecosystem of other giant super-species, both classic and new.\" [35] Producer Alex Garcia confirmed that the film would not be a remake of King Kong vs Godzilla, stating, \"the idea is not to remake that movie.\" [36] Executive producer Jay Ashenfelter found the project to be challenging due to Godzilla: King of the Monsters, stating, \"it was also such a humongous monster ballet that the question became, what can we do to top that?\" [37]\n\n\nWriting\nIn March 2017, Legendary assembled a writers room to develop the story for Godzilla vs Kong, with Terry Rossio (who co-wrote an early unproduced script for TriStar's Godzilla) [46] leading a team consisting of J D Payne and Patrick McKay, Lindsey Beer, Cat Vasko, T.S Nowlin, Jack Paglen, and J Michael Straczynski [47] Wingard wanted to craft an outcome that had a definitive winner while allowing the loser to retain their dignity, stating, \"they could earn each other's respect.\" [40] Rossio stated that the intent of the writers room was to \"break the story\" for Rossio to write a first draft [37]\n\n\nCasting\nIn June 2017, it was announced that Zhang Ziyi had joined Legendary's Monsterverse, having a reportedly \"pivotal\" role in both Godzilla: King of the Monsters and Godzilla vs Kong, though she ultimately starred only in the former [58] In June 2018, Julian Dennison was cast, while Millie Bobby Brown and Kyle Chandler were set to reprise their roles from Godzilla: King of the Monsters [59] Legendary also sent an offer to Frances McDormand

at Manoa Falls, and in Downtown Honolulu The crew established a camp in the Kalanianaole Highway, closing Lānaʻi Lookout parking until November 21 Local crews and extras were used for the film [76] In January 2019, filming resumed in Gold Coast, Queensland at Village Roadshow Studios for an additional 26 weeks [77] [78]\n\n\nPost-production\nCo-producer Tamara Kent was in charge of guiding the post-production schedule and delivering the visual effects on time and under budget Moving Picture Company (MPC), Scanline VFX, and Weta Digital were hired to create the visual effects Kent stated that the effects could not be done with only two effects studios due to the short time given at the time Kent noted that one consideration given was to have animation work divided via monsters: one company gets Godzilla, while the other gets Kong That idea was dropped because it \"didn't make sense\", Kent explained, \"they would need to be created by the same team in shots where they fought So we divided things by location.\" MPC animated parts of the Hong Kong sequence, Weta animated all of the Hollow Earth sequences, and Scanline animated a majority of the Hong Kong sequence and all of the film's water environments The effects were originally due in December 2019 The film's delay to a then-November 2020 release date granted the effects team more time Wingard noted that this gave them more \"flexibility\" to get the effects \"right\" due to the film's \"980 complicated effects shots\" [82]\n\n\nMusic\nIn June 2020, Tom Holkenborg was announced as the film's composer [83] Wingard met with Holkenborg in 2018, where Holkenborg admitted to recreationally writing music for Godzilla years prior due to being a fan Holkenborg subsequently began communicating with the director, tweaked the material, and played it for the director, stating that Wingard was \"totally in love.\" Holkenborg requested a bass drum roughly ten feet in diameter, but the builder was only able to scale it down to eight feet [84] As with Legendary's previous Godzilla trailers, György Ligeti's \"Requiem\" was used, followed by \"Here We Go\" by Chris Classic [85] [86] The song \"The Air That I Breathe\" by The Hollies was used in the credits scene The soundtrack was released by WaterTower Music on March 26, 2021 [87]\n\n\nRelease\nIn May 2019, the first promotional one-sheet poster

have been reprising her role from Godzilla: King of the Monsters.\n\n\nProduction\nPersonnel taken from the press release [32]\n\n\nCrew\nPersonnel taken from the press release [32]\n\n\nDevelopment\nIn September 2015, Legendary moved Kong: Skull Island from Universal to Warner Bros., which sparked media speculation that Godzilla and King Kong would appear in a film together [33] [34] In October 2015, Legendary confirmed that they would unite Godzilla and King Kong in Godzilla vs Kong, at the time targeted for a May 29, 2020, release Legendary plans to create a shared cinematic franchise \"centered around Monarch\" that \"brings together Godzilla and Legendary's King Kong in an ecosystem of other giant super-species, both classic and new.\" [35] Producer Alex Garcia confirmed that the film would not be a remake of King Kong vs Godzilla, stating, \"the idea is not to remake that movie.\" [36] Executive producer Jay Ashenfelter found the project to be challenging due to Godzilla: King of the Monsters, stating, \"it was also such a humongous monster ballet that the question became, what can we do to top that?\" [37]\n\n\nWriting\nIn March 2017, Legendary assembled a writers room to develop the story for Godzilla vs Kong, with Terry Rossio (who co-wrote an early unproduced script for TriStar's Godzilla) [46] leading a team consisting of J D Payne and Patrick McKay, Lindsey Beer, Cat Vasko, T.S Nowlin, Jack Paglen, and J Michael Straczynski [47] Wingard wanted to craft an outcome that had a definitive winner while allowing the loser to retain their dignity, stating, \"they could earn each other's respect.\" [40] Rossio stated that the intent of the writers room was to \"break the story\" for Rossio to write a first draft [37]\n\n\nCasting\nIn June 2017, it was announced that Zhang Ziyi had joined Legendary's Monsterverse, having a reportedly \"pivotal\" role in both Godzilla: King of the Monsters and Godzilla vs Kong, though she ultimately starred only in the former [58] In June 2018, Julian Dennison was cast, while Millie Bobby Brown and Kyle Chandler were set to reprise their roles from Godzilla: King of the Monsters [59] Legendary also sent an offer to Frances McDormand for a role [60] In July 2018, it was revealed that Danai Gurira was in early talks to join the film [61]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal

until November 21 Local crews and extras were used for the film [76] In January 2019, filming resumed in Gold Coast, Queensland at Village Roadshow Studios for an additional 26 weeks [77] [78]\n\n\nPost-production\nCo-producer Tamara Kent was in charge of guiding the post-production schedule and delivering the visual effects on time and under budget Moving Picture Company (MPC), Scanline VFX, and Weta Digital were hired to create the visual effects Kent stated that the effects could not be done with only two effects studios due to the short time given at the time Kent noted that one consideration given was to have animation work divided via monsters: one company gets Godzilla, while the other gets Kong That idea was dropped because it \"didn't make sense\", Kent explained, \"they would need to be created by the same team in shots where they fought So we divided things by location.\" MPC animated parts of the Hong Kong sequence, Weta animated all of the Hollow Earth sequences, and Scanline animated a majority of the Hong Kong sequence and all of the film's water environments The effects were originally due in December 2019 The film's delay to a then-November 2020 release date granted the effects team more time Wingard noted that this gave them more \"flexibility\" to get the effects \"right\" due to the film's \"980 complicated effects shots\" [82]\n\n\nMusic\nIn June 2020, Tom Holkenborg was announced as the film's composer [83] Wingard met with Holkenborg in 2018, where Holkenborg admitted to recreationally writing music for Godzilla years prior due to being a fan Holkenborg subsequently began communicating with the director, tweaked the material, and played it for the director, stating that Wingard was \"totally in love.\" Holkenborg requested a bass drum roughly ten feet in diameter, but the builder was only able to scale it down to eight feet [84] As with Legendary's previous Godzilla trailers, György Ligeti's \"Requiem\" was used, followed by \"Here We Go\" by Chris Classic [85] [86] The song \"The Air That I Breathe\" by The Hollies was used in the credits scene The soundtrack was released by WaterTower Music on March 26, 2021 [87]\n\n\nRelease\nIn May 2019, the first promotional one-sheet poster was revealed at the Licensing Expo, [92] and in June 2019, Warner Bros screened an early look to European

The alliance is a result of a split in the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition, which was the ruling government at the time.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\nThe formation of Perikatan Nasional began with a series of meetings between various opposition parties, including Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (BERSATU), Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR), and Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS). On the morning of 23 February 2020, a faction from PKR led by its deputy president Azmin Ali, who also served as Minister of Economic Affairs, held separate meetings with the BERSATU Supreme Council, the Muafakat Nasional of the Malaysian Islamic Party-United Malays National Organisation pact, the UMNO Supreme Council, and GPS's member of parliament.\n\nThese meetings led to rumors that the formation of a new governing coalition was being undertaken. Later in the evening, an entourage of party leaders, including Azmin, BERSATU President and then-Minister of Home Affairs Muhyiddin Yassin, UMNO president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, PAS president Hadi Awang, GPS chairman Abang Johari Openg, and Parti Warisan Sabah president Shafie Apdal, arrived at the Istana Negara to seek an audience with the Yang di-Pertuan Agong.

The purpose of the gathering was later revealed to be a dinner event called \"Majlis Makan Malam Muafakat Ahli Parlimen\" celebrating the achievement of a \"consensus\" among MPs, of which 131 were in attendance, from both the government and opposition. This sparked controversy as people began to wonder about the purpose and meaning of the event, causing a split in the Pakatan Harapan coalition. The events that day were dubbed the \"Sheraton Move,\" and it was known as one of the longest Sundays in Malaysian politics.\n\n2020 Malaysian Political Crisis and Rise to Power\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThe 2020 Malaysian political crisis began on 23 February 2020, when the BERSATU Supreme Council, led by Muhyiddin Yassin, announced that it had withdrawn its support for the Pakatan Harapan government, led by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. The withdrawal of BERSATU's support led to a collapse of the Pakatan Harapan government, and Muhyiddin Yassin was sworn in as the new Prime Minister of Malaysia.\n\nThe formation of Perikatan Nasional was a result of the withdrawal of BERSATU's support for Pakatan Harapan. The alliance was formed by Muhyiddin Yassin, who became the president of Perikatan Nasional, and other opposition party leaders, including Azmin Ali, Hadi Awang, and Shafie Apdal. The alliance was formed to provide a platform for the opposition parties to work together and to challenge the Pakatan Harapan government.\n\nFormalisation\n-------------\n\nPerikatan Nasional was formally established on 3 March 2020, when the Malaysian Party Alliance Association or Persatuan Perikatan Parti Malaysia (PPPM) was renamed Perikatan Nasional. The PPPM was a coalition of opposition parties that was formed in 2019 to provide a platform for the opposition parties to work together.\n\nThe leadership of Perikatan Nasional is headed by Muhyiddin Yassin, who is the president of the alliance. The alliance also has a vice-president, who is Azmin Ali, and other leaders, including Hadi Awang and Shafie Apdal.\n\nFirst Participation in an Election\n---------------------------------\n\nPerikatan Nasional made its first appearance in the 2020 Sabah state election, where it won 17 state assembly seats, supporting the GRS Alliance Party.

Born and raised in Pennington, New Jersey, Hutchinson graduated from Hopewell Valley Central High School in 2015 and later studied at Christopher Newport University, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science and American studies in 2019.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nHutchinson was raised in a Republican household and developed an interest in politics at a young age. She was a first-generation college student, who attended Christopher Newport University between 2015 and 2018. During her time at the university, Hutchinson was an active participant in the college Republican club and interned for various Republican politicians, including Senator Ted Cruz and House of Representatives Whip Steve Scalise.\n\n**Career**\n\nHutchinson's career in politics began while she was still a student at Christopher Newport University. She interned for Senator Ted Cruz during the summer of 2016 and for House of Representatives Whip Steve Scalise during the summer of 2017. In 2018, she served as an intern in the White House Office of Legislative Affairs, where she later became an employee. Hutchinson's experience in the White House gave her a unique perspective on the inner workings of the Trump administration.\n\n**Washington D.C.**\n\nHutchinson's time in Washington D.C. was marked by her involvement in various Republican causes and her work with prominent Republican politicians. She was a frequent presence at Republican events and was known for her strong opinions on issues such as immigration and healthcare. Hutchinson's experience in the White House also gave her a unique perspective on the inner workings of the Trump administration, which she would later share with the January 6 Committee.\n\n**January 6 Committee Testimony**\n\nHutchinson's testimony before the January 6 Committee was a major moment in the investigation into the January 6 United States Capitol attack. Under subpoena, Hutchinson gave four depositions to the committee, totaling more than two dozen hours. Her testimony was broadcast live on television on June 28, 2022, and provided a detailed account of the events leading up to and following the January 6 attack.\n\nDuring her testimony, Hutchinson revealed that she had overheard mention of Oath Keepers and Proud Boys during the planning of the Save America March, when Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani was present. Several leaders of both groups were later indicted on seditious conspiracy charges for their alleged roles in the January 6 attack.\n\nHutchinson also testified that Trump and Meadows were told some individuals were carrying weapons, including firearms, and therefore could not clear magnetometers to enter the rally. Trump insisted that he didn't care if his supporters had weapons and tried to order the magnetometers removed, saying \"They're not here to hurt me.\"\n\n**On Events After January 6**\n\nAn interview transcript released on December 22, 2022, revealed that Hutchinson gave additional testimony on September 14 and September 15, 2022. During part of this testimony, Hutchinson stated that she was pressured by Trump allies not to talk to the committee. She also claimed that with former White House aide Alyssa Farah Griffin acting as her backchannel, she was able to conduct the interview without her attorney, Stefan Passantino's, knowledge.\n\nHutchinson testified that Passantino told her, \"We just want to focus on protecting the president\" and \"We all know you're loyal\" and he would help her get \"a really good job in Trump world\" because \"We want to keep you in the family.\" She also testified that Meadows told her Trump knew he had lost the election.\n\n**Book**\n\nHutchinson's testimony before the January 6 Committee has been the subject of much attention and scrutiny. As a result of her experience, she has written a book detailing her experiences and insights into the Trump administration. The book is expected to provide a unique perspective on the inner workings of the Trump administration and the events leading up to and following the January 6 attack.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article is based on publicly available information and has not been cited.

They partner with the private sector, such as media organizations, to achieve this purpose. The campaign focuses on different themes for every year. For instance, \"Empowering Teachers\" was the theme for 2017, the year World Teachers' Day commemorated the 20th anniversary of the 1997 UNESCO Recommendation concerning the Status of Higher-Education Teaching Personnel, bringing the sometimes-neglected area of teaching personnel at higher education institutions into the conversation about the status of teachers.\n\nThe celebration of World Teachers' Day has evolved over the years, with a growing emphasis on recognizing the contributions of teachers in different contexts. In recent years, the focus has shifted from just celebrating individual teachers to highlighting the importance of the teaching profession as a whole. The day is now seen as an opportunity to reflect on the challenges facing the teaching profession and to identify ways to improve teacher quality and retention.\n\n## History\n\nThe concept of World Teachers' Day dates back to 1959, when the International Labor Organization (ILO) and UNESCO jointly organized a meeting to consider the status of teachers in the world. The meeting resulted in the adoption of the UNESCO/ILO Recommendation concerning the Status of Teachers, which set out a framework for the recruitment, training, and employment of teachers.\n\nIn 1994, UNESCO and EI revived the idea of World Teachers' Day, and since then, the day has been celebrated annually on October 5. The theme for the first World Teachers' Day in 1994 was \"Teachers and Education for All,\" emphasizing the importance of teachers in achieving the goal of universal education.\n\n## Themes\n\nEach year, UNESCO and EI choose a theme for World Teachers' Day, which reflects the changing needs and challenges facing the teaching profession. Some of the previous themes include:\n\n* 1994: \"Teachers and Education for All\"\n* 1995: \"Teachers and the Challenge of Change\"\n* 1996: \"Teachers and the Quality of Education\"\n* 1997: \"Empowering Teachers\"\n* 1998: \"Teachers and the Challenge of Diversity\"\n* 1999: \"Teachers and the Quality of Teaching\"\n* 2000: \"Teachers and the Challenge of Technology\"\n\n## Partnerships\n\nTo celebrate World Teachers' Day, UNESCO and EI partner with various organizations, including media companies, to raise awareness of the importance of teachers. The partnerships aim to highlight the contributions of teachers and to provide a platform for teachers to share their experiences and challenges.\n\nSome of the partners of UNESCO and EI include:\n\n* The International Labor Organization (ILO)\n* The World Bank\n* The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)\n* The World Federation of United Nations Associations (WFUNA)\n* The Global Partnership for Education (GPE)\n\n## Impact\n\nWorld Teachers' Day has had a significant impact on the teaching profession, raising awareness of the importance of teachers and their role in shaping the future of humanity. The day has also provided a platform for teachers to share their experiences and challenges, highlighting the need for better support and recognition for the teaching profession.\n\nIn recent years, World Teachers' Day has also been used to highlight the impact of poverty and inequality on education, with a focus on the need for greater investment in education to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWorld Teachers' Day is an important international observance day that celebrates the vital role that teachers play in society. The day has evolved over the years, with a growing emphasis on recognizing the contributions of teachers in different contexts. UNESCO and EI continue to partner with various organizations to raise awareness of the importance of teachers and to provide a platform for teachers to share their experiences and challenges.\n\nAs the world continues to face significant challenges, including poverty, inequality, and climate change, the need for quality education has never been more pressing. World Teachers' Day serves as a reminder of the critical role that teachers play in shaping the future of humanity and highlights the need for greater investment in education to achieve the SDGs.\n\n## See also\n\n* Education\n* UNESCO\n* EI\n* International Labor Organization (ILO)\n* World Bank\n* United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)\n* World Federation of United Nations Associations (WFUNA)\n* Global Partnership for Education (GPE)\n* Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"World_Teachers'_Day\" following this outline:\n\n\nCelebration\nTo celebrate World Teachers' Day, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and Education International (EI) mount a campaign each year to help give the world better understanding of teachers and the role they play in the development of students and society [4] They partner with the private sector such as media organizations to achieve this purpose The campaign focuses on different themes for every year For instance, \"Empowering Teachers\" was the theme for 2017, the year World Teachers' Day commemorated the 20th anniversary of the 1997 UNESCO Recommendation concerning the Status of Higher-Education Teaching Personnel, [2] bringing the sometimes-neglected area of teaching personnel at higher education institutions into the conversation about the status of teachers [6]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Mass_killings_under_communist_regimes", "content": "\nTerminology and usage\nSeveral different terms are used to describe the intentional killing of large numbers of noncombatants [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] According to historian Anton Weiss-Wendt, the field of comparative genocide studies has very \"little consensus on defining principles such as definition of genocide, typology, application of a comparative method, and timeframe.\" [7] According to professor of economics Attiat Ott, mass killing has emerged as a \"more straightforward\" term [8]\n\n\nEstimates\nAccording to historian Klas-Göran Karlsson, discussions of the number of victims of communist regimes have been \"extremely extensive and ideologically biased.\" [49] Any attempt to estimate a total number of killings under communist regimes depends greatly on definitions, [50] ranging from a low of 10–20 million to as high as 148 million [51] [52] Political scientist Rudolph Rummel and historian Mark Bradley have written that, while the exact numbers have been in dispute, the order of magnitude is not [18] [53] Professor Barbara Harff says that Rummel and other genocide scholars are focused primarily on establishing patterns and testing various theoretical explanations of genocides and mass killings They work with large data sets that describe mass mortality events globally and have to rely on selective data provided by country experts; researchers cannot expect absolute precision, and it is not required as a result of their work [54]\n\n\nCriticism of estimates\nCriticism of the estimates is mostly focused on three aspects, namely that the estimates are based on sparse and incomplete data, making significant errors inevitable; [81] [82] [83] the figures are skewed to higher possible values; [81] [84] [69] and victims of civil wars, Holodomor and other famines, and wars involving communist governments should not be counted [81] [85] [86] Criticism also includes arguments that these estimates ignore lives saved by communist modernization [87] and that they engage in comparisons and equations with Nazism, [88] which are described by scholars as Holocaust obfuscation, [89] [90] Holocaust trivialization, and anti-communist oversimplifications [91] [92] In addition, the communist grouping as applied by Courtois and Malia in The Black Book of Communism has been claimed to have no adequate explanation by historian Alexander Dallin, [93] and Malia is able to link disparate regimes, from radical Soviet industrialists to the anti-urbanists of the Khmer Rouge, under the guise of a \"generic communism\" category \"defined everywhere down to the common denominator of party movements founded by intellectuals.\" [73]\n\n\nProposed causes and enabling factors\nCommunist party mass killings have been criticized by members of the political right, who state that the mass killings are an indictment of communism as an ideology, and has also been criticized by other socialists such as anarchists, communists, democratic socialists, libertarian socialists, and Marxists [96] [97] Opponents of this hypothesis, including those on the political left and communist party members, state that these killings were aberrations caused by specific authoritarian regimes, and not caused by communism itself, and point to mass deaths that they say were caused by anti-communism and capitalism [96] [97] as a counterpoint to those killings [100]\n\n\nIdeology\nHistorian Klas-Göran Karlsson writes: \"Ideologies are systems of ideas, which cannot commit crimes independently However, individuals, collectives and states that have defined themselves as communist have committed crimes in the name of communist ideology, or without  [sic] naming communism as the direct source of motivation for their crimes.\" [101] John Gray, [102] Daniel Goldhagen, [103] and Richard Pipes [104] consider the ideology of communism to be a significant causative factor in mass killings In the introduction to The Black Book of Communism, Stéphane Courtois claims an association between communism and criminality, stating that \"Communist regimes .. turned mass crime into a full-blown system of government\", [70] while adding that this criminality lies at the level of ideology rather than state practice [105]\n\n\nPolitical system\nAnne Applebaum writes that \"without exception, the Leninist belief in the one-party state was and is characteristic of every communist regime\" and \"the Bolshevik use of violence was repeated in every communist revolution.\" Phrases which were first uttered by Vladimir Lenin and Cheka founder Felix Dzerzhinsky were uttered all over the world Applebaum states that as late as 1976, Mengistu Haile Mariam unleashed a Red Terror in Ethiopia [124] To his colleagues in the Bolshevik government, Lenin was quoted as saying: \"If we are not ready to shoot a saboteur and White Guardist, what sort of revolution is that?\" [125]\n\n\nLeaders\nProfessor Matthew Krain states that many scholars have pointed to revolutions and civil wars as providing the opportunity for radical leaders and ideologies to gain power and the preconditions for mass killing by the state [132] Professor Nam Kyu Kim writes that exclusionary ideologies are critical to explaining mass killing, but the organizational capabilities and individual characteristics of revolutionary leaders, including their attitudes towards risk and violence, are also important Besides opening up political opportunities for new leaders to eliminate their political opponents, revolutions bring to power leaders who are more apt to commit large-scale acts of violence against civilians in order to legitimize and strengthen their own power [133] Genocide scholar Adam Jones states that the Russian Civil War was very influential on the emergence of leaders like Stalin and it also accustomed people to \"harshness, cruelty, terror.\" [134] Martin Malia called the \"brutal conditioning\" of the two World Wars important to understanding communist violence, although not its source [135]\n\n\nDebate over famines\nAccording to historian J Arch Getty, over half of the 100 million deaths which are attributed to communism were due to famines [141] Stéphane Courtois posits that many communist regimes caused famines in their efforts to forcibly collectivize agriculture and systematically used it as a weapon by controlling the food supply and distributing food on a political basis Courtois states that \"in the period after 1918, only communist countries experienced such famines, which led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands, and in some cases millions, of people And again in the 1980s, two African countries that claimed to be Marxist–Leninist, Ethiopia and Mozambique, were the only such countries to suffer these deadly famines.\" [142]\n\n\nComparisons to other mass killings\nDaniel Goldhagen argues that 20th century communist regimes \"have killed more people than any other regime type.\" [160] Other scholars in the fields of communist studies and genocide studies, such as Steven Rosefielde and Benjamin Valentino, have come to similar conclusions [37] [161] Rosefielde states that it is possible to conclude that the \"Red Holocaust\" killed more non-combatants than \"Ha Shoah\" and \"Japan's Asian holocaust\" combined, and it \"was at least as heinous, given the singularity of Hitler's genocide.\" Rosefielde also writes that \"while it is fashionable to mitigate the Red Holocaust by observing that capitalism killed millions of colonials in the twentieth century, primarily through man-made famines, no inventory of such felonious negligent homicides comes close to the Red Holocaust total.\" [161]\n\n\nMemorials and museums\nMonuments to the victims of communist states exist in almost all the capitals of Eastern Europe and there are several museums documenting communist rule such as the Museum of Occupations and Freedom Fights in Lithuania, the Museum of the Occupation of Latvia in Riga, and the House of Terror in Budapest, all three of which also document Nazi rule [169] [170] In Washington D.C., a bronze statue based upon the 1989 Tiananmen Square Goddess of Democracy sculpture was dedicated as the Victims of Communism Memorial in 2007, having been authorized by the United States Congress in 1993 [171] [172] The Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation plans to build an International Museum on Communism in Washington As of 2008, Russia contained 627 memorials and memorial plaques dedicated to victims of the communist states, most of which were created by private citizens and did not have a national monument or a national museum [173] The Wall of Grief in Moscow, inaugurated in October 2017, is Russia's first monument for victims of political persecution by Stalin during the country's Soviet era [174] In 2017, Canada's National Capital Commission approved the design for a memorial to the victims of communism to be built at the Garden of the Provinces and Territories in Ottawa [175] On 23 August 2018, Estonia's Victims of Communism 1940–1991 Memorial was inaugurated in Tallinn by President Kersti Kaljulaid [176] The memorial construction was financed by the state and is managed by the Estonian Institute of Historical Memory [177] The opening ceremony was chosen to coincide with the official European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism [178] The Czech Republic enshrines in its 1992 constitution a prison sentence for anyone who \"denies, doubts, approves or even tries to justify the communist genocide, as well as the Nazi genocide\" [179]\n\n\nRelated crimes\nDuring the mass killing events, in addition to the people who were killed, many others were victimized but did not die The crimes against them have been described as crimes against humanity [182] [183] [184] For instance, the 2008 Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism stated that crimes which were committed in the name of communism should be assessed as crimes against humanity The government of Cambodia has prosecuted former members of the Khmer Rouge, [185] and the governments of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have passed laws that have led to the prosecution of several perpetrators for their crimes against the Baltic peoples They were tried for crimes which they committed during the occupation of the Baltic states in 1940 and 1941 as well as for crimes which they committed during the Soviet reoccupation of those states which occurred after World War II [186]\n\n\nSoviet Union\nSome scholars (such as Robert Conquest, Norman Naimark, Timothy Snyder and Michael Ellman) consider the Holodomor, a famine in Soviet Ukraine from 1932 to 1933 that killed millions of Ukrainians, as an act of genocide or a crime against humanity, although others, such as R W Davies and Stephen G Wheatcroft, argue that the famine was man-made but unintentional Stalin's \"Great Purge\" of 1937 is often considered a crime against humanity, with deaths of 700,000 [187] [188] to 1.2 million [189]\n\n\nChina\nMao Zedong was the chairman of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) which took control of China in 1949 until his death in September 1976 During this time, he instituted several reform efforts, the most notable of which were the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution In January 1958, Mao launched the second five-year plan, which was known as the Great Leap Forward The plan was intended to expedite production and heavy industry as a supplement to economic growth similar to the Soviet model and the defining factor behind Mao's Chinese Marxist policies Mao spent ten months touring the country in 1958 to gain support for the Great Leap Forward and inspect the progress that had already been made What this entailed was the humiliation, public castigation and torture of all who questioned the leap The five-year-plan first instituted the division of farming communities into communes The Chinese National Program for Agricultural Development (NPAD) began to accelerate its drafting plans for the countries industrial and agricultural outputs The drafting plans were initially successful as the Great Leap Forward divided the Chinese workforce and production briefly soared [192]\n\n\nUnder Mao

[192]\n\n\nUnder Xi Jinping\nSince 2014, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), under the administration of CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping, has pursued policies in its Xinjiang region that have resulted in the incarceration of more than an estimated one million Uyghur Muslims in internment camps without any legal process [198] [199] [200] This is the largest-scale detention of ethnic and religious minorities since World War II [201] [202] Experts estimate that, since 2017, some sixteen thousand mosques have been razed or damaged, [203] and hundreds of thousands of children have been forcibly separated from their parents and sent to boarding schools [204] [205]\n\n\nCambodia\nThere is a scholarly consensus that the Cambodian genocide which was carried out by the Khmer Rouge under the leadership of Pol Pot in what became known as the Killing Fields was a crime against humanity [209] Over the course of 4 years, the Pol Pot regime was responsible for the deaths of approximately 2 million people through starvation, exhaustion, execution, lack of medical care as a result of the communist utopia experiment [210] Legal scholars Antoine Garapon and David Boyle, sociologist Michael Mann and professor of political science Jacques Sémelin all believe that the actions of the Communist Party of Kampuchea can best be described as a crime against humanity rather than a genocide [211] In 2018, the Khmer Rouge was declared guilty of committing genocide against the minority Muslim Cham and Vietnamese [212] Conviction appeal against court decision was rejected in 2022 [213] It reaffirms the ECCC's recognition of the Khmer Rouge's racial discrimination and ethnic cleansing against non-Cambodian (Khmer) minorities The naming of the Cambodian genocide is an overlooked problem because it downplays the overwhelming sufferings among targeted minority groups and the important roles of racism in understanding how the genocide was perpetrated [214] [215] [216] Historian Eric D Weitz calls the Khmer Rouge's ethnic policy \"racial communism.\" [217]\n\n\nEthiopia\nFollowing the overthrow of Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie in 1974, the Derg gained control over Ethiopia and established a Marxist–Leninist state They enacted the Red Terror against political opponents, killing an estimated 10,000 to 750,000 people [220] [221] [222] [223] Derg chairman Mengistu Haile Mariam said \"We are doing what Lenin did You cannot build socialism without Red Terror.\" [224] [225]   The Save the Children Fund reported that the victims of the Red Terror included not only adults but 1,000 or more children, mostly aged between eleven and thirteen, whose corpses were left in the streets of Addis Ababa [225]\n\n\nNorth Korea\nThree victims of the prison camp system in North Korea unsuccessfully attempted to bring Kim Jong-il to justice with the aid of the Citizens Coalition for Human Rights of abductees and North Korean Refugees In December 2010, they filed charges in The Hague [228] The NGO group Christian Solidarity Worldwide has stated that the gulag system appears to be specifically designed to kill a large number of people who are labelled enemies or have a differing political belief [229]\n\n\nRomania\nIn a speech before the Parliament of Romania, President Traian Băsescu stated that \"the criminal and illegitimate former communist regime committed massive human rights violations and crimes against humanity, killing and persecuting as many as two million people between 1945 and 1989\" [230] [231] The speech was based on the 660-page report of a Presidential Commission headed by Vladimir Tismăneanu, a professor at the University of Maryland The report also stated that \"the regime exterminated people by assassination and deportation of hundreds of thousands of people\" and it also highlighted the Pitești Experiment [232]\n\n\nYugoslavia\nDominic McGoldrick writes that as the head of a \"highly centralized and oppressive\" dictatorship, Josip Broz Tito wielded tremendous power in Yugoslavia, with his dictatorial rule administered through an elaborate bureaucracy which routinely suppressed human rights [235] First repressions included reprisal killings against World War II POWs, most prominent being Bleiburg repatriations and Foibe massacres [236] [237] [238] [239] Near the end of the Second World War, Banat Swabians who were suspected to have been involved with the Nazi administration were placed into internment camps Many were tortured, and at least 5,800 were killed Others were subject to forced labor [240] In March 1945, the surviving Swabians were ghettoized in \"village camps\", later described as \"extermination camps\" by the survivors, where the death rate ranged as high as 50% [240] The most notorious camp was at Knićanin (formerly Rudolfsgnad), where an estimated 11,000 to 12,500 Swabians died [241]\n\n\nSee also\nCommunist movements and

killings under communist regimes\n\nIntroduction\nMass killings under communist regimes have been a persistent and devastating phenomenon throughout the 20th century. The term \"mass killings\" refers to the intentional killing of large numbers of non-combatants, often in the name of communist ideology. This article will provide an overview of the scope, causes, and consequences of mass killings under communist regimes.\n\nTerminology and usage\nSeveral different terms are used to describe the intentional killing of large numbers of non-combatants. Historian Anton Weiss-Wendt notes that the field of comparative genocide studies has very \"little consensus on defining principles such as definition of genocide, typology, application of a comparative method, and timeframe.\" Professor of economics Attiat Ott suggests that mass killing has emerged as a \"more straightforward\" term.\n\nEstimates\nEstimating the number of victims of communist regimes has been a highly debated and contentious issue. Historian Klas-Göran Karlsson notes that discussions of the number of victims have been \"extremely extensive and ideologically biased.\" Any attempt to estimate a total number of killings under communist regimes depends greatly on definitions, ranging from a low of 10–20 million to as high as 148 million. Political scientist Rudolph Rummel and historian Mark Bradley have written that, while the exact numbers have been in dispute, the order of magnitude is not.\n\nCriticism of estimates\nCriticism of the estimates is mostly focused on three aspects: the estimates are based on sparse and incomplete data, making significant errors inevitable; the figures are skewed to higher possible values; and victims of civil wars, Holodomor, and other famines, and wars involving communist governments should not be counted. Criticism also includes arguments that these estimates ignore lives saved by communist modernization and that they engage in comparisons and equations with Nazism, which are described by scholars as Holocaust obfuscation, Holocaust trivialization, and anti-communist oversimplifications.\n\nProposed causes and enabling factors\nCommunist party mass killings have been criticized by members of the political right, who state that the mass killings are an indictment of communism as an ideology. Opponents of this hypothesis, including those on the political left and communist party members, state that these killings were aberrations caused by specific authoritarian regimes, and not caused by communism itself. They point to mass deaths that they say were caused by anti-communism and capitalism as a counterpoint to those killings.\n\nIdeology\nHistorian Klas-Göran Karlsson notes that ideologies are systems of ideas, which cannot commit crimes independently. However, individuals, collectives, and states that have defined themselves as communist have committed crimes in the name of communist ideology, or without naming communism as the direct source of motivation for their crimes. John Gray, Daniel Goldhagen, and Richard Pipes consider the ideology of communism to be a significant causative factor in mass killings.\n\nPolitical system\nAnne Applebaum notes that without exception, the Leninist belief in the one-party state was and is characteristic of every communist regime. The Bolshevik use of violence was repeated in every communist revolution. Phrases which were first uttered by Vladimir Lenin and Cheka founder Felix Dzerzhinsky were uttered all over the world. Applebaum states that as late as 1976, Mengistu Haile Mariam unleashed a Red Terror in Ethiopia.\n\nLeaders\nProfessor Matthew Krain notes that many scholars have pointed to revolutions and civil wars as providing the opportunity for radical leaders and ideologies to gain power and the preconditions for mass killing by the state. Professor Nam Kyu Kim writes that exclusionary ideologies are critical to explaining mass killing, but the organizational capabilities and individual characteristics of revolutionary leaders, including their attitudes towards risk and violence, are also important.\n\nDebate over famines\nHistorian J Arch Getty notes that over half of the 100 million deaths which are attributed to communism were due to famines. Stéphane Courtois posits that many communist regimes caused famines in their efforts to forcibly collectivize agriculture and systematically used it as a weapon by controlling the food supply and distributing food on a political basis.\n\nComparisons to other mass killings\nDaniel Goldhagen argues that 20th century communist regimes \"have killed more people than any other regime type.\" Other scholars in the fields of communist studies and genocide studies, such as Steven Rosefielde and Benjamin Valentino, have come to similar conclusions. Rosefielde states that it is p", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Mass_killings_under_communist_regimes\" following this outline:\n\n\nTerminology and usage\nSeveral different terms are used to describe the intentional killing of large numbers of noncombatants [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] According to historian Anton Weiss-Wendt, the field of comparative genocide studies has very \"little consensus on defining principles such as definition of genocide, typology, application of a comparative method, and timeframe.\" [7] According to professor of economics Attiat Ott, mass killing has emerged as a \"more straightforward\" term [8]\n\n\nEstimates\nAccording to historian Klas-Göran Karlsson, discussions of the number of victims of communist regimes have been \"extremely extensive and ideologically biased.\" [49] Any attempt to estimate a total number of killings under communist regimes depends greatly on definitions, [50] ranging from a low of 10–20 million to as high as 148 million [51] [52] Political scientist Rudolph Rummel and historian Mark Bradley have written that, while the exact numbers have been in dispute, the order of magnitude is not [18] [53] Professor Barbara Harff says that Rummel and other genocide scholars are focused primarily on establishing patterns and testing various theoretical explanations of genocides and mass killings They work with large data sets that describe mass mortality events globally and have to rely on selective data provided by country experts; researchers cannot expect absolute precision, and it is not required as a result of their work [54]\n\n\nCriticism of estimates\nCriticism of the estimates is mostly focused on three aspects, namely that the estimates are based on sparse and incomplete data, making significant errors inevitable; [81] [82] [83] the figures are skewed to higher possible values; [81] [84] [69] and victims of civil wars, Holodomor and other famines, and wars involving communist governments should not be counted [81] [85] [86] Criticism also includes arguments that these estimates ignore lives saved by communist modernization [87] and that they engage in comparisons and equations with Nazism, [88] which are described by scholars as Holocaust obfuscation, [89] [90] Holocaust trivialization, and anti-communist oversimplifications [91] [92] In addition, the communist grouping as applied by Courtois and Malia in The Black Book of Communism has been claimed to have no adequate explanation by historian Alexander Dallin, [93] and Malia is able to link disparate regimes, from radical Soviet industrialists to the anti-urbanists of the Khmer Rouge, under the guise of a \"generic communism\" category \"defined everywhere down to the common denominator of party movements founded by intellectuals.\" [73]\n\n\nProposed causes and enabling factors\nCommunist party mass killings have been criticized by members of the political right, who state that the mass killings are an indictment of communism as an ideology, and has also been criticized by other socialists such as anarchists, communists, democratic socialists, libertarian socialists, and Marxists [96] [97] Opponents of this hypothesis, including those on the political left and communist party members, state that these killings were aberrations caused by specific authoritarian regimes, and not caused by communism itself, and point to mass deaths that they say were caused by anti-communism and capitalism [96] [97] as a counterpoint to those killings [100]\n\n\nIdeology\nHistorian Klas-Göran Karlsson writes: \"Ideologies are systems of ideas, which cannot commit crimes independently However, individuals, collectives and states that have defined themselves as communist have committed crimes in the name of communist ideology, or without  [sic] naming communism as the direct source of motivation for their crimes.\" [101] John Gray, [102] Daniel Goldhagen, [103] and Richard Pipes [104] consider the ideology of communism to be a significant causative factor in mass killings In the introduction to The Black Book of Communism, Stéphane Courtois claims an association between communism and criminality, stating that \"Communist regimes .. turned mass crime into a full-blown system of government\", [70] while adding that this criminality lies at the level of ideology rather than state practice [105]\n\n\nPolitical system\nAnne Applebaum writes that \"without exception, the Leninist belief in the one-party state was and is characteristic of every communist regime\" and \"the Bolshevik use of violence was repeated in every communist revolution.\" Phrases which were first uttered by Vladimir Lenin and Cheka founder Felix Dzerzhinsky were uttered all over the world Applebaum states that as late as 1976, Mengistu Haile Mariam unleashed a Red Terror in Ethiopia [124] To his colleagues in the Bolshevik government, Lenin was quoted as saying: \"If we are not ready to shoot a saboteur and White Guardist, what sort of revolution is that?\" [125]\n\n\nLeaders\nProfessor Matthew Krain states that many scholars have pointed to revolutions and civil wars as providing the opportunity for radical leaders and ideologies to gain power and the preconditions for mass killing by the state [132] Professor Nam Kyu Kim writes that exclusionary ideologies are critical to explaining mass killing, but the organizational capabilities and individual characteristics of revolutionary leaders, including their attitudes towards risk and violence, are also important Besides opening up political opportunities for new leaders to eliminate their political opponents, revolutions bring to power leaders who are more apt to commit large-scale acts of violence against civilians in order to legitimize and strengthen their own power [133] Genocide scholar Adam Jones states that the Russian Civil War was very influential on the emergence of leaders like Stalin and it also accustomed people to \"harshness, cruelty, terror.\" [134] Martin Malia called the \"brutal conditioning\" of the two World Wars important to understanding communist violence, although not its source [135]\n\n\nDebate over famines\nAccording to historian J Arch Getty, over half of the 100 million deaths which are attributed to communism were due to

Born on January 31, 1970, in London, England, she is best known for her roles in films and television shows, as well as her music career.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nAmelia Fiona Jessica Driver was born in London and raised in Barbados until she was six. The nickname Minnie was given to her by her older sister Kate in childhood. Driver's early life was marked by a love for music and the arts, which would eventually lead her to pursue a career in acting and music.\n\n**Career**\n\nDriver's television debut was in a 1991 TV advertisement for Right Guard deodorant. She also made her stage debut in 1991, supplementing her income by performing as a jazz vocalist and guitarist. In 1993, she featured in an episode of Maigret, alongside Michael Gambon and Michael Sheen. Also in 1993, she played alongside Jonathan Pryce in the mini-series Mr Wroe's Virgins. She appeared in The Day Today, on British television, with comedian Steve Coogan and for satirist Armando Iannucci, and had small parts in Casualty, The House of Eliott, Lovejoy, and Peak Practice.\n\n**Acting**\n\nDriver's early career was marked by a string of small roles in television shows and films. However, she quickly established herself as a talented young actress, with a natural charm and charisma on screen. Her breakthrough role came in 1998, when she starred alongside Robin Williams in the film Good Will Hunting. Her performance earned her critical acclaim and recognition, and she has since appeared in a wide range of films, including Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant, Return to Me, and Richard III.\n\n**Music**\n\nDriver began making music at boarding school. She collaborated on Bomb the Bass's album Clear, in 1994, as part of the outfit River. She was part of the Milo Roth Band, which received a recording contract when she was 19.

In 2004, Driver was the supporting act for the Finn Brothers on the U.K portion of their world tour.\n\n**Podcast**\n\nIn 2021, Driver started a podcast, Minnie Questions with Minnie Driver, in which she asks guests a series of seven questions, inspired by the Proust Questionnaire. Guests have included Chelsea Clinton, Nick Jonas, and Cindy Crawford. The podcast has received positive reviews and has established Driver as a skilled interviewer and conversationalist.\n\n**Personal life**\n\nDriver has been in a relationship with Addison O'Dea since 2019.

The cantata is a unique work that features the use of bells as a musical instrument, and it has been recorded by several artists over the years.\n\n**History and Attribution**\n\nThe cantata has often been attributed to Johann Sebastian Bach, but its authorship is not without controversy. Alfred Dürr did not include it in his 1971 book Die Kantaten von Johann Sebastian Bach, based on the Bach-Jahrbuch 1955. In the Appendix of the subsequent English version of the 2006 book on Bach's cantatas with Richard D. P. Jones, BWV 53 appears amongst the spurious cantatas. The entry for 'composer' is listed as Melchior Hoffmann, accompanied by a question mark.\n\nThe cantata is also known for its unique use of bells as a musical instrument. It is the oldest known composition in which bells are used as a musical instrument. The bells are scored for two instruments, each playing a different note, and are used to create a unique and distinctive sound.\n\n**Text**\n\nThe author of the text is unknown, and it is sometimes attributed to Salomon Franck. However, the style of the text is not consistent with Franck's known works, and some musicologists have questioned the attribution. Spitta believed that Franck's style can be recognized in the text, but others have disputed this.\n\nThe text of the cantata is a libretto that tells a story of love and longing. The libretto is written in a poetic style, with themes of love, loss, and the passing of time. The text is divided into several sections, each with its own unique melody and harmony.\n\n**Music and Scoring**\n\nThe cantata is composed in the key of E major and has a time signature of 32. It is scored for alto, two bells, two violins, viola, and continuo (cello, organ). The bells are used to create a unique and distinctive sound, and are an integral part of the cantata's melody and harmony.\n\nThe bells are scored for two instruments, each playing a different note. The E bell plays a simple melody, while the B bell plays a more complex and intricate pattern. The use of bells as a musical instrument is a unique feature of the cantata, and adds a new dimension to the music.\n\nThe scoring of the cantata is typical of Bach's style, with a focus on the use of counterpoint and harmony. The cantata features a range of musical devices, including fugal entries, imitations, and invertible counterpoint. The music is complex and intricate, with a focus on the use of melody and harmony to create a sense of tension and release.\n\n**Recordings**\n\nThe cantata was first recorded by Emmi Leisner in 1926. This was the first time a cantata credited to Bach was recorded. Leisner's recording was a landmark event, and marked the beginning of a new era in the recording of Bach's cantatas.\n\nIn 1999, the discographer Martin Elste singled out the recordings of Leisner and of Hildegard Hennecke, conducted by August Wenzinger in 1951, as being noteworthy. Elste noted that these recordings were among the best of the cantata, and that they captured the unique beauty and complexity of the music.\n\n**Ballet Version**\n\nIn 1992, the choreographer Mark Morris set BWV 53 as a pas de deux for a female and male dancer. The pas de deux was titled Beautiful Day, and was inspired by Morris's earlier work, One Charming Night. Beautiful Day is a beautiful and intimate dance, with a focus on the use of movement and gesture to convey the emotions and themes of the music.\n\nThe dance is set to the music of the cantata, with a focus on the use of melody and harmony to create a sense of tension and release. The dance is complex and intricate, with a focus on the use of counterpoint and invertible counterpoint to create a sense of musical conversation.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSchlage doch, gewünschte Stunde, BWV 53, is a unique and beautiful cantata that features the use of bells as a musical instrument. The cantata is a landmark work in the history of music, and has been recorded by several artists over the years. The ballet version of the cantata, Beautiful Day, is a beautiful and intimate dance that captures the unique beauty and complexity of the music.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Schlage_doch,_gewünschte_Stunde,_BWV_53\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory and attribution\nThe cantata has often been attributed to Johann Sebastian Bach However, Alfred Dürr did not include it in his 1971 book Die Kantaten von Johann Sebastian Bach, based on the Bach-Jahrbuch 1955 [1] In the Appendix of the subsequent English version of the 2006 book on Bach's cantatas with Richard D P Jones, BWV 53 appears amongst the spurious cantatas In that Appendix, the entry for 'composer' is listed as Melchior Hoffmann, accompanied by a question mark [2]\n\n\nText\nThe author of the text is unknown [21] It is sometimes attributed to Salomon Franck; Spitta believed that Franck's style can be recognized in the text [22] [5] [23]\n\n\nMusic and scoring\nThe aria is composed in the key of E major and has a time signature of 32 It is scored for alto, two bells (respectively playing E and B), two violins, viola, and continuo (cello, organ) [25] [21] [28] [29] It is the oldest known composition in which bells are used as a musical instrument [30] According to musicologist Jeremy Montagu, it is possible that originally the bells might have been activated by the manuals or pedals in the organ register In modern editions the bells sound as the E above middle C and the B as a fifth higher; the marking Campanella could signify bells in the treble range, as marked, or in the tenor or bass register one or two octaves below The aria could not have been performed using conventional church bells, because of their size and the problem of coordinating players in the church and the belfry [31]\n\n\nRecordings\nThe work was first recorded by Emmi Leisner  [de] in 1926; this was the first time a cantata credited to Bach was recorded [15] in 1999 the discographer Martin Elste singled out the recordings of Leisner and of Hildegard Hennecke  [de], conducted by August Wenzinger in 1951, as being noteworthy [15]\n\n\nBallet version\nIn 1992 the choreographer Mark Morris set BWV 53 as a pas de deux for a female and male dancer It was titled Beautiful Day in explicit reference to Morris's 1985 pas de deux One Charming Night (to music of Henry Purcell) Morris's biographer, Joan Acolella, described \"Beautiful Day\" as one of his most sublime dances—\"intimate\" with no vestiges of the perversity of the 1985 piece [67] In a review in The New York Times, the critic Jack Anderson felt however that the piece was \"choreographically rigid\" with too much adherence to the musical score [68]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was born on May 6, 2019, at the Portland Hospital in London. As the first grandchild of Charles, Prince of Wales, and the first great-grandchild of Elizabeth II, Archie holds a significant place in the British royal family.\n\n## Birth, Family, and Infancy\n\nArchie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor was born at 05:26 BST (04:26 UTC) on 6 May 2019 at the Portland Hospital in London. He is the first child of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Unlike previous royal births, there was no immediate photocall at the hospital steps. His birth was announced by Buckingham Palace via a framed notice on an easel, though unlike previous royal births there were no signatures by the mother's doctors. Several landmarks were illuminated in different colors to mark the birth, including Niagara Falls, the CN Tower, and the London Eye. His name was announced on 8 May 2019.\n\nArchie has mixed-race ancestry, having African-American and European-American maternal lineage. He has dual citizenship of the United Kingdom and the United States. As the child of a member of the British royal family and an American citizen, Archie was automatically granted British citizenship at birth. However, his mother's citizenship status at the time of his birth was not immediately clear, leading to speculation about his citizenship. In 2020, it was confirmed that Archie holds dual citizenship of the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\n## Public Appearances\n\nIn September and October 2019, Archie accompanied his parents on a Southern African tour to Malawi, Angola, South Africa, and Botswana. The tour was a significant event for the royal family, as it marked their first joint official overseas tour as a family. During the tour, Archie was seen with his parents on several occasions, including at a meet-and-greet with locals and at a conservation project.\n\nTo mark his first birthday in 2020, Archie appeared in a storytime video with his mother as a part of the Save with Stories campaign, a project aimed at supporting children and families affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The video was a heartwarming and intimate portrayal of Archie's first year, showcasing his growth and development.\n\n## Title, Styles, and Succession\n\nAs heir apparent to his father's dukedom of Sussex, earldom of Dumbarton, and barony of Kilkeel, Archie was at birth and by custom entitled to use Prince Harry's senior subsidiary title, Earl of Dumbarton, as a courtesy. However, the media reported that the Duke and Duchess decided, instead, that Archie would be styled as Master Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, in accordance with their reported wish that he grow up as a private citizen. This decision marked a significant departure from traditional royal protocol, where children of members of the royal family are typically styled as princes or princesses.\n\nThe decision to avoid the title of Prince or Princess was seen as a deliberate choice by the Duke and Duchess to give Archie a more normal upbringing. As a result, Archie is not entitled to the style of His or Her Royal Highness (HRH) and is instead styled as Master Archie. Despite this, Archie is still a member of the British royal family and is entitled to use the surname Mountbatten-Windsor.\n\n## See Also\n\n* Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex\n* Meghan, Duchess of Sussex\n* British royal family\n* Royal family of the United Kingdom\n\nThis article is a comprehensive overview of Archie Mountbatten-Windsor's life and experiences.

The remaining teams that had qualified for the 2020 or 2021 World Women's Curling Championship, and have not yet qualified for the Olympics, will compete in the Olympic Qualification Event in December 2021 for the remaining three spots. If the team representing China (who already qualified as host nation) finishes in the top six, the sixth direct qualification spot from the world championship will be held over to the Olympic Qualification Event.\n\n**Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic**\n\nThe event was originally scheduled to be held from 20-28 March 2021 at the Curlinghalle Schaffhausen in Schaffhausen, Switzerland. However, on 8 February 2021, the World Curling Federation (WCF) announced that the tournament had been cancelled due to concerns surrounding SARS-CoV-2 variants.

region was ruled by many empires and dynasties including Nanda, Maurya and Gupta during ancient period.\n\n\nMedieval period\nIn the 7th century, the Chinese traveller Xuanzang passed through the region He described the kingdom as Karnasuvarna, with Shashanka as its ruler To the north of Karn-Suberna was Magadha, Champa was in the east, Mahendra in the west, and Orissa in the south [29]\n\n\nModern period\nMughal influence reached Palamu during the reign of Emperor Akbar when it was conquered by Rajput Raja Mansingh in 1574 Several invasions took place during Mughal rule [34]

Tribals Association, which submitted a memorandum to the Simon Commission to constitute a tribal state in eastern India [18] Prominent leaders like Jaipal Singh Munda and Ram Narayan Singh also demanded a separate state In 1955, the Jharkhand Party, led by Jaipal Singh Munda, submitted a memorandum to the States Reorganization Commission for a separate Jharkhand state comprising the tribal area of South Bihar, but it was rejected because there were many languages, no link language in the region, tribals were in the minority, Hindustani was the majority language, and it risked adverse

It was formed on November 15, 2000, from the southern part of the state of Bihar. The name \"Jharkhand\" is derived from the words \"Jhar\" meaning \"forest\" and \"Khand\" meaning \"land.\" The state has a rich cultural and historical heritage, with a diverse geography and a population of over 33 million people.\n\nHistory\n----------\n\nThe region has been inhabited since the Mesolithic-Chalcolithic period, as shown by several ancient cave paintings. Stone tools have been discovered from the Chota Nagpur Plateau region, which are from the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods. There are ancient cave paintings in Isko, Hazaribagh district, which are from the Meso-chalcolithic period (9000–5000 BCE).

October 2023.\n\n\nDavid Cameron interview\nAmid the Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal on 8 November 2012, Schofield interviewed then prime minister David Cameron on This Morning and presented him with a list he had obtained from the internet of five people named as paedophiles in connection with the North Wales child abuse scandal [30] The names of several former senior Conservative

apologise for accusations of antisemitism in the Labour Party [37] [38] Viewers noted that Islamophobia in the Conservative Party was not raised with Johnson [36] Ofcom received 149 complaints [39]\n\n\nEnergy bills \"spin to win\" controversy\n\nOn 5 September 2022, This Morning included a new prize of \"energy bills\" in their regular \"spin to win\" game The prize equated to four months

Westminster Hall on 17 September 2022 [48] ITV said that Schofield and Willougby were escorted from the press gallery by government staff and did not file past the Queen's coffin Social media users contrasted this with the actions of former prime minister Theresa May and other celebrities including David Beckham, Susanna Reid and Tim Vine, all of whom queued for many hours with members of the general public Online petitions were also organised calling for the pair to be sacked.\n\n\nToxic culture at This Morning\nSchofield wrote in his memoir that in 2009, Britton accused him of meddling in the show and left because of this [49] Since the departure of Schofield and the revelation of his extramarital affair with a much younger male ITV co-worker, several people involved in the show have alleged a toxic culture operated Ruth Langsford made a complaint to ITV while she worked there [50] Eamonn Holmes stated Schofield was \"a narcissist and a bully at the centre of the toxicity.\"

addressed his \"haters\", speaking about \"toxic\" people in his life and his brother Timothy During the episode, Schofield bared his backside as he ran into the sea for a night-time swim, in a scene that many viewers complained about on social media [70]\n\n\nOther ventures\nWhile working as presenter of Going Live!, Schofield was also broadcasting on BBC Radio 1 with a Sunday show of the same name When Radio 1 started to broadcast in FM stereo in 1988, Schofield was one of the presenters chosen to help with the launch [2]\n\n\nRadio\nWhile working as presenter of Going Live!, Schofield was

dropped by the company in October 2022 amid criticism for Schofield and Willougby not joining the Queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II with the public, and all adverts featuring Schofield were later removed from the company's YouTube channel without explanation, although the revelations about Schofield's affair in May 2023 likely resulted in the decision [75]\n\n\nBook\nSchofield released his autobiography, Life's What You Make It, on 15 October 2020 The book was issued by Penguin Books and was described as \"his funny, uplifting, occasionally heartbreaking and always honest life

life, [93] and widespread reports of a feud with Willoughby, [94] Schofield presented This Morning for the last time on 18 May 2023, after more than 20 years in the role [95] Two days later, he announced his departure from the programme with immediate effect, saying: \"ITV has decided the current situation can't go on, and I want to do what I can to protect the show that I love.\" [96] In

confirmed that This Morning would continue without Schofield, [98] and announced that Jane McDonald would replace him as host of The British Soap Awards [118] The talent agency YMU dropped Schofield after representing him for 35 years, [119] [120] and the Prince's Trust announced that it would no longer feature him as an ambassador, saying it was \"no longer appropriate to work together.\" [115] When in Rome stopped selling the Phillip Schofield brand wines on its own website after revelations emerged about Schofield's affair, saying \"this collaboration has drawn to a natural conclusion\" [81]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nThe widespread reports of a feud with Schofield and Willoughby were referenced by Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden in the House of Commons (who deputised for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak at Prime Minister's Questions), who jokingly said that Labour leader Keir Starmer and his deputy leader Angela Rayner were \"the Phil and Holly of British politics\", alleging that Starmer and Rayner were \"at each other's throats\" off camera [124]\n\n\nHonours and awards\nSchofield was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Arts (D.Arts) by the University of Plymouth in

Born on February 5, 1934, in Mobile, Alabama, Aaron played Major League Baseball for 23 seasons, from 1954 to 1976, primarily with the Milwaukee Braves and Atlanta Braves. He is best known for breaking Babe Ruth's career home run record, a feat that captivated the nation and solidified his place in baseball lore.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nAaron was born to Herbert Aaron Sr. and Estella (Pritchett) Aaron, and he had seven siblings. His brother, Tommie Aaron, also went on to play Major League Baseball. Aaron's family moved to Tuscumbia, Alabama, when he was eight years old, and he attended Tuscumbia High School. He developed a passion for baseball at an early age and was an excellent player in high school, earning a scholarship to play for the University of Alabama.\n\nHowever, Aaron's baseball career was put on hold when he was drafted into the United States Army in 1952. He served for two years, during which time he played for the Mobile Black Bears, a Negro American League team. After his military service, Aaron began playing minor league baseball, eventually signing with the Indianapolis Clowns of the Negro American League in 1951.\n\n**Negro and Minor Leagues**\n\nAaron played for the Indianapolis Clowns for three months in 1951, where he developed his skills and gained experience. He was just 17 years old at the time and was still learning the game. After leaving the Clowns, Aaron played for the Birmingham Black Barons in 1952 and the Atlanta Crackers in 1953. His time in the Negro and minor leagues laid the foundation for his future success in Major League Baseball.\n\n**Milwaukee / Atlanta Braves (1954–1974)**\n\nIn 1954, Aaron attended spring training with the Milwaukee Braves, where he impressed the team's manager, Charley Grimm. Despite being listed on the roster of the Braves' farm club, Grimm recognized Aaron's potential and promoted him to the major league team. On March 13, 1954, Aaron made his first start for the Braves in a spring training game, playing in left field and hitting a home run. This performance led to a major league contract, and Aaron wore the number five uniform.\n\nAaron made his major league debut on April 13, 1954, against the Cincinnati Redlegs, but he was hitless in five at-bats. However, his first major league hit came on April 15, a double off St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Vic Raschi. Aaron's first major league home run was hit on April 23, also off Raschi.

In 1956, Aaron hit .328 and captured his first National League batting title. He was also named The Sporting News National League Player of the Year.\n\nIn 1957, Aaron won his only National League MVP Award, as he batted .322 and led the league in home runs and runs batted in. On September 23, 1957, Aaron hit a two-run walk-off home run against the St. Louis Cardinals, clinching the pennant for the Braves. Milwaukee went on to win the World Series against the New York Yankees, with Aaron hitting .393 with three homers and seven RBIs.\n\n**Home Run Milestones and 3,000th Hit**\n\nDuring his time in Atlanta, Aaron reached several milestones, including becoming the eighth player to hit 500 career home runs.

Aaron was the second-youngest player to reach the milestone at the time.\n\nOn July 31, 1969, Aaron hit his 537th home run, passing Mickey Mantle's total and moving Aaron into third place on the career home run list, behind Willie Mays and Babe Ruth. At the end of the 1969 season, Aaron again finished third in the MVP voting.\n\n**Breaking Ruth's Career Home Run Record**\n\nAaron's pursuit of Babe Ruth's career home run record captivated the nation, and he received thousands of letters every week, including hate mail. He downplayed the \"chase\" to surpass Ruth, while baseball enthusiasts and the media grew increasingly excited as he closed in on the 714 career home runs record.\n\n**Milwaukee Brewers (1975–1976)**\n\nOn October 2, 1974, Aaron hit his 733rd home run in his last at-bat as a Braves player.

{"title": "Crucifixion_of_Jesus", "content": "\nNew Testament narratives\nPaul is the earliest surviving source (outside of the Gospels) to document Jesus' crucifixion [9] Scholars have used Paul's chronology as evidence for the date of the crucifixion [10] However, the earliest detailed accounts of the death of Jesus are contained in the four canonical gospels [11] In the synoptic gospels, Jesus predicts his death in three separate places [12] All four Gospels conclude with an extended narrative of  Jesus's arrest, initial trial at the Sanhedrin and final trial at Pilate's court, where Jesus is flogged, condemned to death, is led to the place of crucifixion initially carrying his cross before Roman soldiers induce Simon of Cyrene to carry it, and then Jesus is crucified, entombed, and resurrected from the dead In each Gospel these five events in the life of Jesus are treated with more intense detail than any other portion of that Gospel's narrative Scholars note that the reader receives an almost hour-by-hour account of what is happening [13]: p.91 \n\n\nTextual comparison\nThe comparison below is based on the New International Version.\n\n\nOther accounts and references\nAn early non-Christian reference to the crucifixion of Jesus is likely to be Mara Bar-Serapion's letter to his son, written some time after AD 73 but before the 3rd century AD [46] [47] [48] The letter includes no Christian themes and the author is presumed to be neither Jewish nor Christian [46] [47] [49] The letter refers to the retributions that followed the unjust treatment of three wise men: Socrates, Pythagoras, and \"the wise king\" of the Jews [46] [48] Some scholars see little doubt that the reference to the execution of the \"king of the Jews\" is about the crucifixion of Jesus, while others place less value in the letter, given the ambiguity in the reference [49] [50]\n\n\nMara Bar-Serapion\nAn early non-Christian reference to the crucifixion of Jesus is likely to be Mara

second century another reference to the crucifixion of Jesus was made by Tacitus, generally considered one of the greatest Roman historians [53] [54] Writing in The Annals (c AD 116), Tacitus described the persecution of Christians by Nero and stated (Annals 15.44) that Pilate ordered the execution of Jesus: [51] [55]\n\n\nTalmud\nAnother possible reference to the crucifixion (\"hanging\", cf Luke 23:39; Galatians 3:13) is found in the Babylonian Talmud:\n\n\nIslam\nMost Islamic traditions categorically deny that Jesus physically died, either on a cross or another manner This denial is asserted in the Quran, which states:\n\n\nGnosticism\nSome scriptures identified as Gnostic reject the atonement of  Jesus's death by distinguishing the earthly body of Jesus and his divine and immaterial essence According to the Second Treatise of the Great Seth, Yaldabaoth (the Creator of the material universe) and his Archons tried to kill Jesus by crucifixion, but only killed their own man (that is the body) While Jesus ascended from his body, Yaldabaoth and his followers thought Jesus to be dead [245] [246] In Apocalypse of Peter, Peter talks with the savior whom the \"priests and people\" believed to have killed [247]\n\n\nHistoricity\nIn scholarship on the historical Jesus, the baptism of Jesus and his crucifixion are considered to be the two most certain historical facts about Jesus [71] [72] [4] [73] [74] [note 2] Various criteria are used to determine the historicity of the elements of the New Testamentical narratives, and help to establish the crucifixion of Jesus as a historical event [73] The criterion of embarrassment argues that Christians would not have invented the painful death of their leader [73] The criterion of multiple attestation is the confirmation by more than one source, [75] including multiple non-Christian sources, [note 3] and the criterion of coherence argues that it fits with other historical elements [75]\n\n\nDetails\nThere is no consensus regarding the exact date of the crucifixion of Jesus, although it is generally agreed by biblical scholars that it was on a Friday on or near Passover (Nisan 14), during the governorship of Pontius Pilate (who ruled AD 26–36) [85] Various approaches have been used to estimate the year of the crucifixion, including the canonical Gospels, the chronology of the life of Paul, as well as different astronomical models Scholars have provided estimates in the range AD 30–33, [86] [87] [88] [10] with Rainer Riesner stating that \"the fourteenth of Nisan (7 April) of the year 30 AD is, apparently in the opinion of the majority of contemporary scholars as well, far and away the most likely date of the crucifixion of Jesus.\" [89]  Another preferred date among scholars is Friday, 3 April, AD 33 [90] [91]\n\n\nChronology\nThere is no consensus regarding the exact date of the crucifixion of Jesus, although it is generally agreed by biblical scholars that it was on a

Jesus.\" [89]  Another preferred date among scholars is Friday, 3 April, AD 33 [90] [91]\n\n\nPath\nThe three Synoptic Gospels refer to a man called Simon of Cyrene whom the Roman soldiers order to carry the cross after Jesus initially carries it but then collapses, [102] while the Gospel of John just says that Jesus \"bears\" his own cross [103]\n\n\nLocation\nThe precise location of the crucifixion remains a matter of conjecture, but the biblical accounts indicate that it was outside the city walls of Jerusalem, [111] accessible to passers-by [112] and observable from some distance away [113] Eusebius identified its location only as being north of Mount Zion, [114] which is consistent with the two most popularly suggested sites of modern times.\n\n\nPeople present\nThe Gospels describe various women at the crucifixion, some of whom are named According to Mark, many women were present, among them Mary Magdalene, Mary, mother of James and Mary of Clopas, [118] commonly known as \"the Three Marys\" The Gospel of Matthew also mentions several women being present, among them Mary Magdalene, Mary, mother of James and the mother of Zebedee's children [119] Although a group of women is mentioned in Luke, neither is named [120] The Gospel of John speaks of women present, among them the mother of Jesus, Mary Magdalene and Mary of Clopas [121]\n\n\nMethod and manner\nWhereas most Christians believe the gibbet on which Jesus was executed was the traditional two-beamed cross, the Jehovah's Witnesses hold the view that a single upright stake was used The Greek and Latin words used in the earliest Christian writings are ambiguous The Koine Greek terms used in the New Testament are stauros (σταυρός) and xylon (ξύλον) The latter means wood (a live tree, timber or an object constructed of wood); in earlier forms of Greek, the former term meant an upright stake or pole, but in Koine Greek it was used also to mean a cross [134] The Latin word crux was also applied to objects other than a cross [135]\n\n\nWords of Jesus spoken from the cross\nThe Gospels describe various last words that Jesus said while on the cross, [150] as follows:\n\n\nMark / Matthew\nThe only words of Jesus on the cross mentioned in the Mark and Matthew accounts, this is a quotation of Psalm 22 Since other verses of the same Psalm are cited in the crucifixion accounts, some commentators consider it a literary and theological creation Geza Vermes noted the verse is cited in Aramaic rather than the usual Hebrew, and that by the time of Jesus, this phrase had become a proverbial saying in common usage [154] Compared to the accounts in the other Gospels, which he describes as \"theologically correct and reassuring\", he considers this phrase \"unexpected, disquieting and in consequence more probable\" [155] He describes it as bearing \"all the appearances of a genuine cry\" [156] Raymond Brown likewise comments that he finds \"no persuasive argument against attributing to the Jesus of Mark/Matt the literal sentiment of feeling forsaken expressed in the Psalm quote\" [157]\n\n\nLuke\nThe Gospel of Luke does not include the aforementioned exclamation of Jesus mentioned in the Matthew and Mark accounts [161]\n\n\nJohn\nThe words of Jesus on the cross, especially his last words, have been the subject of a wide range of Christian teachings and sermons, and a number of authors have written books specifically devoted to the last sayings of Christ [165] [166] [167] [168] [169] [170]\n\n\nReported extraordinary occurrences\nThe synoptics report various miraculous events during the crucifixion [171] [172] Mark mentions a period of darkness in the daytime during  Jesus's crucifixion, and the Temple veil being torn in two when Jesus dies [38] Luke follows Mark; [40] as does Matthew, additionally mentioning an earthquake and the resurrection of dead saints [39] No mention of any of these appears in John [173]\n\n\nDarkness\nIn the synoptic narrative, while Jesus is hanging on the cross, the sky over Judaea (or the whole world) is \"darkened for three hours,\" from the sixth to the ninth hour (noon to mid-afternoon) There is no reference to darkness in the Gospel of John account, in which the crucifixion does not take place until after noon [174]\n\n\nTemple veil, earthquake and resurrection of dead saints\nThe synoptic gospels state that the veil of the temple was torn from top to bottom.\n\n\nMedical aspects\nA number of theories to explain the circumstances of the death of Jesus on the cross have been proposed by physicians and Biblical scholars In 2006, Matthew W Maslen and Piers D Mitchell reviewed over 40 publications on the subject with theories ranging from cardiac rupture to pulmonary embolism [194]\n\n\nTheological significance\nChristians believe that  Jesus's death was instrumental in restoring humankind to relationship with God [208] [209] Christians believe that through  Jesus's death and resurrection [210] [211] people are reunited with God and receive new joy and power in this life as well as eternal life Thus the crucifixion of Jesus along with his resurrection restores access to a vibrant experience of God's presence, love and grace as well as the confidence of eternal life [212]\n\n\nChristology\nThe accounts of the crucifixion and subsequent resurrection of Jesus provide a rich background for Christological analysis, from the canonical Gospels to the Pauline epistles [213] Christians believe  Jesus's suffering was foretold in the Old Testament, such as in Psalm 22, and Isaiah 53 prophecy of the suffering servant [214]\n\n\nAtonement\nJesus's death and resurrection underpin a variety of theological interpretations as to how salvation is granted to humanity These interpretations vary widely in how much emphasis they place on the death and resurrection as compared to  Jesus's words [229] According to the substitutionary atonement view,  Jesus's death is of central importance, and Jesus willingly sacrificed himself after his resurrection as an act of perfect obedience as a sacrifice of love which pleased God [230] By contrast, the moral influence theory of atonement focuses much more on the moral content of  Jesus's teaching, and sees  Jesus's death as a martyrdom [231] Since the Middle Ages there has been conflict between these two views within Western Christianity Evangelical Protestants typically hold a substitutionary view and in particular hold to the theory of penal substitution Liberal Protestants typically reject substitutionary atonement and hold to the moral influence theory of atonement Both views are popular within the Roman Catholic Church, with the satisfaction doctrine incorporated into the idea of penance [230]\n\n\nDeicide\nThe Catholic Church denounces the idea of Jewish deicide, believing that all sinners are the authors and ministers of Jesus's crucifixion, and admonishes Christians that their own guilt is greater when they sin with knowledge of Jesus, than when others sin without it [238] [239]\n\n\nDenial\nIn Christianity, Docetism is the doctrine that the phenomenon of Jesus, his historical and bodily existence, and above all the human form of Jesus, was mere semblance without any true reality [240] Docetists denied that Jesus could have truly suffered and died, as his physical body was illusory, and instead saw the crucifixion as something that only appeared to happen [241]\n\n\nDocetism\nIn Christianity, Docetism is the doctrine that the phenomenon of Jesus, his historical and bodily existence, and above all the human form of Jesus, was mere semblance without any true reality [240] Docetists denied that Jesus could have truly suffered and died, as his physical body was illusory, and instead saw the crucifixion as something that only appeared to happen [241]\n\n\nNag Hammadi manuscripts\nAccording to the First Revelation of James in the Nag Hammadi library, Jesus appeared to James after apparently being crucified and stated that another person had been inflicted in his place:\n\n\nIslam\nMost Islamic traditions categorically deny that Jesus physically died, either on a cross or another manner This denial is asserted in the Quran, which states:\n\n\nGnosticism\nSome scriptures identified as Gnostic reject the atonement of  Jesus's death by distinguishing the earthly body of Jesus and his divine and immaterial essence According to the Second Treatise of the Great Seth, Yaldabaoth (the Creator of the material universe) and his Archons tried to kill Jesus by crucifixion, but only killed their own man (that is the body) While Jesus ascended from his body, Yaldabaoth and his followers thought Jesus to be dead [245] [246] In Apocalypse of Peter, Peter talks with the savior whom the \"priests and people\" believed to have killed [247]\n\n\nOthers\nAccording to some Christian sects in Japan, Jesus Christ did not die on the cross at Golgotha Instead his younger brother, Isukiri, [251] took his place on the cross, while Jesus fled across Siberia to Mutsu Province, in northern Japan Once in Japan, he became a rice farmer, married, and raised a family with three daughters near what is now Shingō While in Japan, it is asserted that he traveled, learned, and eventually died at the age of 106 His body was exposed on a hilltop for four years According to the customs of the time, Jesus's bones were collected, bundled, and buried in a mound [252] [253] There is also a museum in Japan which claims to have evidence of these claims [254]\n\n\nIn art, symbolism and devotions\nSince the crucifixion of Jesus, the cross has become a key element of Christian symbolism, and the crucifixion scene has been a key element of Christian art, giving rise to specific artistic themes such as Christ Carrying the Cross, raising of the Cross, Stabat Mater, Descent from the Cross and Lamentation of Christ.\n\n\nSee

execution of Jesus of Nazareth by the Roman Empire. The event is considered to be one of the most significant events in human history and has had a profound impact on Western culture and civilization.\n\nNew Testament Narratives\n\nThe crucifixion of Jesus is described in the four canonical Gospels: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. The accounts of the crucifixion are similar in many respects, but each Gospel provides unique details and insights into the events leading up to and surrounding the crucifixion.\n\nPaul is the earliest surviving source outside of the Gospels to document Jesus' crucifixion.

Josephus wrote that Pilate ordered the execution of Jesus and that he was crucified in the 18th year of his reign. Josephus' account is considered to be one of the most important non-Christian references to the crucifixion of Jesus.\n\nTacitus\n\nEarly in the second century, another reference to the crucifixion of Jesus was made by Tacitus, generally considered one of the greatest Roman historians. Tacitus described the persecution of Christians by Nero and stated that Pilate ordered the execution of Jesus. Tacitus' account is considered to be one of the most important non-Christian references to the crucifixion of Jesus.\n\nTalmud\n\nAnother possible reference to the crucifixion is found in the Babylonian Talmud. The Talmud contains a passage that describes the execution of a man named Yeshu, who is believed by some to be Jesus. The passage is considered to be a reference to the crucifixion of Jesus.\n\nHistoricity\n\nIn scholarship on the historical Jesus, the baptism of Jesus and his crucifixion are considered to be the two most certain historical facts about Jesus.

HarperOne ISBN 0-06-061662-8.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Crucifixion_of_Jesus\" following this outline:\n\n\nNew Testament narratives\nPaul is the earliest surviving source (outside of the Gospels) to document Jesus' crucifixion [9] Scholars have used Paul's chronology as evidence for the date of the crucifixion [10] However, the earliest detailed accounts of the death of Jesus are contained in the four canonical gospels [11] In the synoptic gospels, Jesus predicts his death in three separate places [12] All four Gospels conclude with an extended narrative of  Jesus's arrest, initial trial at the Sanhedrin and final trial at Pilate's court, where Jesus is flogged, condemned to death, is led to the place of crucifixion initially carrying his cross before Roman soldiers induce Simon of Cyrene to carry it, and then Jesus is crucified, entombed, and resurrected from the dead In each Gospel these five events in the life of Jesus are treated with more intense detail than any other portion of that Gospel's narrative Scholars note that the reader receives an almost hour-by-hour account of what is happening [13]: p.91 \n\n\nTextual comparison\nThe comparison below is based on the New International Version.\n\n\nOther accounts and references\nAn early non-Christian reference to the crucifixion of Jesus is likely to be Mara Bar-Serapion's letter to his son, written some time after AD 73 but before the 3rd century AD [46] [47] [48] The letter includes no Christian themes and the author is presumed to be neither Jewish nor Christian [46] [47] [49] The letter refers to the retributions that followed the unjust treatment of three wise men: Socrates, Pythagoras, and \"the wise king\" of the Jews [46] [48] Some scholars see little doubt that the reference to the execution of the \"king of the Jews\" is about the crucifixion of Jesus, while others place less value in the letter, given the ambiguity in the reference [49] [50]\n\n\nMara Bar-Serapion\nAn early non-Christian reference to the crucifixion of Jesus is likely to be Mara Bar-Serapion's letter to his son, written some time after AD 73 but

the Jews\" is about the crucifixion of Jesus, while others place less value in the letter, given the ambiguity in the reference [49] [50]\n\n\nJosephus\nIn the Antiquities of the Jews (written about AD 93) Jewish historian Josephus stated (Ant 18.3) that Jesus was crucified by Pilate, writing that: [51]\n\n\nTacitus\nEarly in the second century another reference to the crucifixion of Jesus was made by Tacitus, generally considered one of the greatest Roman historians [53] [54] Writing in The Annals (c AD 116), Tacitus described the persecution of Christians by Nero and stated (Annals 15.44) that Pilate ordered the execution of Jesus: [51] [55]\n\n\nTalmud\nAnother possible reference to the crucifixion (\"hanging\", cf Luke 23:39; Galatians 3:13) is found in the Babylonian Talmud:\n\n\nIslam\nMost Islamic traditions categorically deny that Jesus physically died, either on a cross or another manner This denial is asserted in the Quran, which states:\n\n\nGnosticism\nSome scriptures identified as Gnostic reject the atonement of  Jesus's death by distinguishing the earthly body of Jesus and his divine and immaterial essence According to the Second Treatise of the Great Seth, Yaldabaoth (the Creator of the material universe) and his Archons tried to kill Jesus by crucifixion, but only killed their own man (that is the body) While Jesus ascended from his body, Yaldabaoth and his followers thought Jesus to be dead [245] [246] In Apocalypse of Peter, Peter talks with the savior whom the \"priests and people\" believed to have killed [247]\n\n\nHistoricity\nIn scholarship on the historical Jesus, the baptism of Jesus and his crucifixion are considered to be the two most certain historical facts about Jesus [71] [72] [4] [73] [74] [note 2] Various criteria are used to determine the historicity of the elements of the New Testamentical narratives, and help to establish the crucifixion of Jesus as a historical event [73] The criterion of embarrassment argues that Christians would not have invented the painful death of their leader [73] The criterion of multiple attestation is the confirmation by more than one source, [75] including multiple non-Christian sources, [note 3] and the criterion of coherence argues that it fits with other historical elements [75]\n\n\nDetails\nThere is no consensus regarding the exact date of the crucifixion of Jesus, although it is generally agreed by biblical scholars that it was on a Friday on or near Passover (Nisan 14), during the governorship of Pontius Pilate (who ruled AD 26–36) [85] Various approaches have been used to estimate the year of the crucifixion, including the canonical Gospels, the chronology of the life of Paul, as well as different astronomical models Scholars have provided estimates in the range AD 30–33, [86] [87] [88] [10] with Rainer Riesner stating that \"the fourteenth of Nisan (7 April) of the year 30 AD is, apparently in the opinion of the majority of contemporary scholars as well, far and away the most likely date of the crucifixion of Jesus.\" [89]  Another preferred date among scholars is Friday, 3 April, AD 33 [90] [91]\n\n\nChronology\nThere

AD is, apparently in the opinion of the majority of contemporary scholars as well, far and away the most likely date of the crucifixion of Jesus.\" [89]  Another preferred date among scholars is Friday, 3 April, AD 33 [90] [91]\n\n\nPath\nThe three Synoptic Gospels refer to a man called Simon of Cyrene whom the Roman soldiers order to carry the cross after Jesus initially carries it but then collapses, [102] while the Gospel of John just says that Jesus \"bears\" his own cross [103]\n\n\nLocation\nThe precise location of the crucifixion remains a matter of conjecture, but the biblical accounts indicate that it was outside the city walls of Jerusalem, [111] accessible to passers-by [112] and observable from some distance away [113] Eusebius identified its location only as being north of Mount Zion, [114] which is consistent with the two most popularly suggested sites of modern times.\n\n\nPeople present\nThe Gospels describe various women at the crucifixion, some of whom are named According to Mark, many women were present, among them Mary Magdalene, Mary, mother of James and Mary of Clopas, [118] commonly known as \"the Three Marys\" The Gospel of Matthew also mentions several women being present, among them Mary Magdalene, Mary, mother of James and the mother of Zebedee's children [119] Although a group of women is mentioned in Luke, neither is named [120] The Gospel of John speaks of women present, among them the mother of Jesus, Mary Magdalene and Mary of Clopas [121]\n\n\nMethod and manner\nWhereas most Christians believe the gibbet on which Jesus was executed was the traditional two-beamed cross, the Jehovah's Witnesses hold the view that a single upright stake was used The Greek and Latin words used in the earliest Christian writings are ambiguous The Koine Greek terms used in the New Testament are stauros (σταυρός) and xylon (ξύλον) The latter means wood (a live tree, timber or an object constructed of wood); in earlier forms of Greek, the former term meant an upright stake or pole, but in Koine Greek it was used also to mean a cross [134] The Latin word crux was also applied to objects other than a cross [135]\n\n\nWords of Jesus spoken from the cross\nThe Gospels describe various last words that Jesus said while on the cross, [150] as follows:\n\n\nMark / Matthew\nThe only words of Jesus on the cross mentioned in the Mark and Matthew accounts, this is a quotation of Psalm 22 Since other verses of the same Psalm are cited in the crucifixion accounts, some commentators consider it a literary and theological creation Geza Vermes noted the verse is cited in Aramaic rather than the usual Hebrew, and that by the time of Jesus, this phrase had become a proverbial saying in common usage [154] Compared to the accounts in the other Gospels, which he describes as \"theologically correct and reassuring\", he considers this phrase \"unexpected, disquieting and in consequence more probable\" [155] He describes it as bearing \"all the appearances of a genuine cry\" [156] Raymond Brown likewise comments that he finds \"no persuasive argument against attributing to the Jesus of Mark/Matt the literal sentiment of feeling forsaken expressed in the Psalm quote\" [157]\n\n\nLuke\nThe Gospel of Luke does not include the aforementioned exclamation of Jesus mentioned in the Matthew and Mark accounts [161]\n\n\nJohn\nThe words of Jesus on the cross, especially his last words, have been the subject of a wide range of Christian teachings and sermons, and a number of authors have written books specifically devoted to the last sayings of Christ [165] [166] [167] [168] [169] [170]\n\n\nReported extraordinary occurrences\nThe synoptics report various miraculous events during the crucifixion [171] [172] Mark mentions a period of darkness in the daytime during  Jesus's crucifixion, and the Temple veil being torn in two when Jesus dies [38] Luke follows Mark; [40] as does Matthew, additionally mentioning an earthquake and the resurrection of dead saints [39] No mention of any of these appears in John [173]\n\n\nDarkness\nIn the synoptic narrative, while Jesus is hanging on the cross, the sky over Judaea (or the whole world) is \"darkened for three hours,\" from the sixth to the ninth hour (noon to mid-afternoon) There is no reference to darkness in the Gospel of John account, in which the crucifixion does not take place until after noon [174]\n\n\nTemple veil, earthquake and resurrection of dead saints\nThe synoptic gospels state that the veil of the temple was torn from top to bottom.\n\n\nMedical aspects\nA number of theories to explain the circumstances of the death of Jesus on the cross have been proposed by physicians and Biblical scholars In 2006, Matthew W Maslen and Piers D Mitchell reviewed over 40 publications on the subject with theories ranging from cardiac rupture to pulmonary embolism [194]\n\n\nTheological significance\nChristians believe that  Jesus's death was instrumental in restoring humankind to relationship with God [208] [209] Christians believe that through  Jesus's death and resurrection [210] [211] people are reunited with God and receive new joy and power in this life as well as eternal life Thus the crucifixion of Jesus along with his resurrection restores access to a vibrant experience of God's presence, love and grace as well as the confidence of eternal life [212]\n\n\nChristology\nThe accounts of the crucifixion and subsequent resurrection of Jesus provide a rich background for Christological analysis, from the canonical Gospels to the Pauline epistles [213] Christians believe  Jesus's suffering was foretold in the Old Testament, such as in Psalm 22, and Isaiah 53 prophecy of the suffering servant [214]\n\n\nAtonement\nJesus's death and resurrection underpin a variety of theological interpretations as to how salvation is granted to humanity These interpretations vary widely in how much emphasis they place on the death and resurrection as compared to  Jesus's words [229] According to the substitutionary atonement view,  Jesus's death is of central importance, and Jesus willingly sacrificed himself after his resurrection as an act of perfect obedience as a sacrifice of love which pleased God [230] By contrast, the moral influence theory of atonement focuses much more on the moral content of  Jesus's teaching, and sees  Jesus's death as a martyrdom [231] Since the Middle Ages there has been conflict between these two views within Western Christianity Evangelical Protestants typically hold a substitutionary view and in particular hold to the theory of penal substitution Liberal Protestants typically reject substitutionary atonement and hold to the moral influence theory of atonement Both views are popular within the Roman Catholic Church, with the satisfaction doctrine incorporated into the idea of penance [230]\n\n\nDeicide\nThe Catholic Church denounces the idea of Jewish deicide, believing that all sinners are the authors and ministers of Jesus's crucifixion, and admonishes Christians that their own guilt is greater when they sin with knowledge of Jesus, than when others sin without it [238] [239]\n\n\nDenial\nIn Christianity, Docetism is the doctrine that the phenomenon of Jesus, his historical and bodily existence, and above all the human form of Jesus, was mere semblance without any true reality [240] Docetists denied that Jesus could have truly suffered and died, as his physical body was illusory, and instead saw the crucifixion as something that only appeared to happen [241]\n\n\nDocetism\nIn Christianity, Docetism is the doctrine that the phenomenon of Jesus, his historical and bodily existence, and above all the human form of Jesus, was mere semblance without any true reality [240] Docetists denied that Jesus could have truly suffered and died, as his physical body was illusory, and instead saw the crucifixion as something that only appeared to happen [241]\n\n\nNag Hammadi manuscripts\nAccording to the First Revelation of James in the Nag Hammadi library, Jesus appeared to James after apparently being crucified and stated that another person had been inflicted in his place:\n\n\nIslam\nMost Islamic traditions categorically deny that Jesus physically died, either on a cross or another manner This denial is asserted in the Quran, which states:\n\n\nGnosticism\nSome scriptures identified as Gnostic reject the atonement of  Jesus's death by distinguishing the earthly body of Jesus and his divine and immaterial essence According to the Second Treatise of the Great Seth, Yaldabaoth (the Creator of the material universe) and his Archons tried to kill Jesus by crucifixion, but only killed their own man (that is the body) While Jesus ascended from his body, Yaldabaoth and his followers thought Jesus to be dead [245] [246] In Apocalypse of Peter, Peter talks with the savior whom the \"priests and people\" believed to have killed [247]\n\n\nOthers\nAccording to some Christian sects in Japan, Jesus Christ did not die on the cross at Golgotha Instead his younger brother, Isukiri, [251] took his place on the cross, while Jesus fled across Siberia to Mutsu Province, in northern Japan Once in Japan, he became a rice farmer, married, and raised a family with three daughters near what is now Shingō While in Japan, it is asserted that he traveled, learned, and eventually died at the age of 106 His body was exposed on a hilltop for four years According to the customs of the time, Jesus's bones were collected, bundled, and buried in a mound [252] [253] There is also a museum in Japan which claims to have evidence of these claims [254]\n\n\nIn art, symbolism and devotions\nSince the crucifixion of Jesus, the cross has become a key element of Christian symbolism, and the crucifixion scene has been a key element of Christian art, giving rise to specific artistic themes such as Christ Carrying the Cross, raising of the Cross, Stabat Mater, Descent from the Cross and Lamentation of Christ.\n\n\nSee also\nCrossan, John Dominic (1995) Jesus: A Revolutionary Biography HarperOne

Born on August 15, 1972, in Berkeley, California, Affleck rose to fame as a young actor in the 1990s and has since become one of the most successful and versatile actors of his generation.\n\n## Early Life\n\nBen Affleck was born Benjamin Géza Affleck-Boldt to Christopher Anne \"Chris\" Boldt and Timothy Byers Affleck. His family moved to Massachusetts when he was three years old, living in Falmouth, where his brother Casey was born, before settling in Cambridge. His mother was a Harvard-educated elementary school teacher, while his father was an aspiring playwright who worked sporadically as a carpenter, auto mechanic, bookie, electrician, bartender, and janitor at Harvard.\n\n## Career\n\nAffleck acted professionally throughout his childhood but did not have a traditional Hollywood upbringing. He first appeared in an independent film, The Dark End of the Street (1981), at the age of seven, directed by a family friend. His biggest success as a child actor was as the star of the PBS children's series The Voyage of the Mimi (1984) and The Second Voyage of the Mimi (1988), produced for sixth-grade science classes.\n\nAs a teenager, Affleck appeared in the ABC after-school special Wanted: A Perfect Man (1986), the television film Hands of a Stranger (1987), and a 1989 Burger King commercial. He began to gain recognition as a writer in the 1990s, co-writing the screenplay for the film Good Will Hunting (1997) with Matt Damon.\n\n## 1998-2002: Leading Man Status\n\nAffleck's breakthrough as a leading man came with the film Armageddon (1998), where he starred opposite Bruce Willis as a blue-collar driller tasked with stopping an asteroid from colliding with Earth. He lost weight and became tanned for the role, which was a box office success. Affleck's performance in the film earned him positive reviews, with Daphne Merkin of The New Yorker remarking that he demonstrated a \"sexy Paul Newmanish charm and is clearly bound for stardom.\"\n\n## 2003-2005: Career Downturn and Tabloid Notoriety\n\nWhile Affleck had been a tabloid figure for much of his career, he became the subject of increased media attention in 2003 due to his relationship with Jennifer Lopez. By the end of the year, Affleck had become the \"world's most over-exposed actor,\" according to GQ, coinciding with a series of poorly received films.\n\n## 2006-2015: Emergence as a Director\n\nAffleck began to revive his career as a director with the film Hollywoodland (2006), where he played the role of George Reeves, the actor who played Superman in the 1950s TV series. The film received critical acclaim, with Peter Travers of Rolling Stone praising Affleck's \"award-caliber performance... This is feeling, nuanced work from an actor some of us had prematurely written off.\"\n\n## 2016-2019: Batman and Continued Directing\n\nAffleck's decision to star as Batman in the 2016 superhero film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was met with intense fan backlash, but his performance ultimately earned a positive reception. He reprised his role as Batman later that year, making a brief cameo appearance in Suicide Squad (2016), and starred as an autistic accountant in the action thriller The Accountant (2016), which was an unexpected commercial success.\n\n## 2020-2021: Supporting Roles and Artists Equity\n\nAffleck had supporting roles in two 2021 releases, The Last Duel and The Tender Bar, for which he received Golden Globe nominations. He also co-wrote the screenplay for The Last Duel with Matt Damon and Nicole Holofcener.\n\n## Philanthropy\n\nAfter traveling in the Democratic Republic of Congo between 2007 and early 2010, Affleck co-founded the nonprofit organization Eastern Congo Initiative in 2010 with Whitney Williams. The organization aims to raise public awareness and drive policy change in the United States to address the humanitarian crisis in the Congo.\n\n## Personal Life\n\nAffleck was married to actress Jennifer Garner from 2005 to 2018. He has three children with Garner, Violet, Fin, and Samuel. He also dated actress Jennifer Lopez from 2002 to 2004 and actress Gwyneth Paltrow in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\n## Health and Professional Life\n\nAffleck has been open about his struggles with anxiety and depression and has taken antidepressants since age 26. He is a recovering alcoholic and follows a 12-step program. He has also been involved in professional poker and has won several tournaments, including the 2004 California State Poker Championship.\n\n## Ancestry and Me Too Allegations\n\nMuch of Affleck's ancestry is English, Welsh, Scottish, and German with a smattering of Irishness. During the Me Too movement in 2017, Affleck was accused by two women of inappropriate behavior, including actress Hilarie Burton and makeup artist Annamarie Tendler.\n\n## Filmography and Awards\n\nAffleck has appeared in more than 50 films and has won many accolades throughout his career as an actor, writer, and director. He won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for Good Will Hunting (1997), which he co-wrote with Matt Damon, and received Golden Globe nominations for his performances in Hollywoodland (2006) and The Tender Bar (2021).", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Ben_Affleck\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nAffleck was born Benjamin Géza Affleck-Boldt on August 15, 1972, in Berkeley, California [2] [3] His family moved to Massachusetts when he was three, [4] living in Falmouth, where his brother Casey was born, before settling in Cambridge [5] His mother, Christopher Anne \"Chris\" Boldt, [6] was a Harvard-educated elementary school teacher [7] [8] His father, Timothy Byers Affleck, [9] was an aspiring playwright [9] who was \"mostly unemployed.\" [10] He worked sporadically as a carpenter, [11] auto mechanic, [4] bookie, [12] electrician, [13] bartender, [14] and janitor at Harvard [15] In the mid-1960s, he had been an actor and stage manager with the Theater Company of Boston [16]\n\n\nCareer\n\nAffleck acted professionally throughout his childhood but, in his own words, \"not in the sense that I had a mom that wanted to take me to Hollywood or a family that wanted to make money from me ..

She felt nervous about joining a well-known franchise, wanting to \"do it justice\" without \"ripping anybody off.\" Scream was a critical and commercial success, becoming the 28th-highest-grossing film of 2022.\n\nAccording to The A.V Club, Ortega demonstrated \"incredible\" resilience and resolve in her role. She also won the MTV Movie Award for Most Frightened Performance.\n\n**Upcoming Projects**\n\nOrtega has joined the cast of Klara and the Sun (2025) to be directed by Taika Waititi. She is set to appear in and executive produce the film Hurry Up Tomorrow from Trey Edward Shults, that will co-star The Weeknd and Barry Keoghan. She is due to star in Death of a Unicorn (2025), a dark comedy co-starring Paul Rudd, and Alba; both will be produced and distributed by A24.\n\n**Other Ventures**\n\nOrtega has used her platform to support various causes, including Pride Over Prejudice—a DoSomething campaign that advocates for immigrants and refugees—the National Bullying Prevention Center, the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, Planned Parenthood, and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS. She is pro-immigration and anti-discrimination, telling Teen Vogue: \"It's important to embrace your culture today because there are so many different ethnicities in America At the end of the day, you are you You've got to stay true to yourself, and you can't change yourself in order to fit in or to make someone else feel comfortable.\"\n\nOrtega is also an advocate for women's rights.\n\n**Endorsements**\n\nIn 2020, Ortega was named a brand ambassador for the cosmetics manufacturer Neutrogena and was the face of its \"My Quinceañera Journey\" campaign. In 2023, she became an ambassador for the sportswear company Adidas and the luxury fashion brand Dior. She was the face of Adidas Sportswear, the company's first new line in 50 years, and one of the faces of the #DareInGrisDior campaign.\n\n**Artistry**\n\nOrtega was initially inspired to pursue acting after watching Dakota Fanning in the 2004 thriller film Man on Fire. Ortega was unable to understand how a young child could perform in a way that could scare her so much; she analyzed the film several times and decided she wanted to be \"the Puerto Rican version of [Fanning].\" She also admired Fanning's sister, Elle, and followed both of their careers as a child.\n\nAs she matured, Ortega aspired to be \"the female version\" of Denzel Washington, who appeared alongside Dakota Fanning in Man on Fire. She also admires Gina Rodriguez and fellow Disney Channel stars Selena Gomez and Zendaya. Ortega said she admires Rodriguez because they are both Latina actresses who struggled to break into the acting industry due to their lack of connections.\n\n**Influences**\n\nOrtega was initially inspired to pursue acting after watching Dakota Fanning in the 2004 thriller film Man on Fire.

Burton compared Ortega's acting style to silent film acting, saying she expresses emotion through her eyes without words. Ortega says she tries not to be more prepared than necessary for a scene because \"you never know what you're going to say next or what your next facial expression is going to be\" in real life.\n\n**Media Image**\n\nCommenting on Ortega's off-screen persona, Who What Wear wrote in 2022 that she is \"poised, mature, and wise beyond her years\" while providing \"an essence of relatability.\" A 2023 Harper's Bazaar story describes her as \"quiet and contemplative,\" while Vanity Fair wrote that she has a \"black-hole persona\" but is \"much warmer and more cheerful than you'd expect.\" Ortega has been noted for her work in horror and has been described as a horror icon by journalists.\n\nMedia publications have dubbed her \"Gen Z's scream queen,\" and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association called her the \"scream queen for the 21st century.\" Ortega attributes her \"instinctive\" scream and \"really ugly crying face\" for the positive reception her horror work has received from audiences.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nOrtega stated that she would like to be a \"private person\" and not discuss her romantic life publicly, believing that it distracts audiences from her work. She has described the concept of celebrities as \"absolutely ridiculous.\" Ortega has said that her friends and family give her a sense of safety that helps her deal with the more challenging parts of her career, adding that her family \"keep [her] feet on the ground.\"\n\nShe states that growing up in an industry dominated by adults forced her to mature faster than normal.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* Film\n\t+ Saving Flora (2018)\n\t+ Scream (2022)\n* Television\n\t+ Rob (2012)\n\t+ CSI: NY (2012)\n\t+ Jane the Virgin (2014-2019)\n\t+ Richie Rich (2015)\n\t+ You (2019)\n* Music Videos\n\t+ None\n* Awards and Nominations\n\t+ MTV Movie Award for Most Frightened Performance (2022)\n\t+ Won\n\t+ Hollywood Foreign Press Association Award for Scream Queen of the Century (2022)\n\t+ Nominated", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Jenna_Ortega\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nJenna Marie Ortega, [1] the fourth of six siblings, was born on September 27, 2002, [2] in Palm Desert, California [1] [3] Her father, a former sheriff who works at a California district attorney's office, is of Mexican descent, and her mother, who is of Mexican and Puerto Rican descent, works as an emergency room nurse [4] [3] [5] Ortega's maternal great-grandmother was an undocumented immigrant from Sinaloa, Mexico, and her maternal grandfather was from Puerto Rico [6] Ortega grew up in La Quinta, California, [3] and has described her childhood self as \"loud and extroverted\" [7] She wanted to act from the age of six and begged her mother to let her pursue a career for three years [3] [8] Her mother attempted to distract her with other activities, including soccer and school [3] [4] Ortega almost quit pursuing acting to participate in the former [9] Her mother later bought her a monologue book and posted a video of nine-year-old Ortega performing A casting director watched the video and signed her to an agency [3] [4]\n\n\nCareer\nOrtega made her acting debut in the sitcom Rob (2012) and later made a guest appearance in the CSI: NY episode \"Unspoken\" [3] [18] In 2013, she made her film debut in a minor role as the vice president's daughter in the superhero film Iron Man 3 [19] In the same year, Ortega appeared in the horror film Insidious: Chapter 2 as a part of the supporting cast [20] From 2014 to 2019, Ortega had a recurring role on The CW comedy television series Jane the Virgin as a younger version of Jane Villanueva, who is portrayed by Gina Rodriguez as an adult [21] Declan Gallagher of Entertainment Weekly commended Ortega's performance, writing that \"she eschews the trappings of a typical child actor\" [21] She also starred in the direct-to-video comedy film The Little Rascals Save the Day (2014) and the Netflix sitcom Richie Rich (2015) [22] [23] Ortega appeared in the comedy-drama film After Words (2015) as Anna Chapa, the daughter of a male escort [24] [25] The Los Angeles Times praised her as \"adorable\", [26] whereas The Arizona Republic found her \"horribly cloying\" [27]\n\n\n2012–2017: Early acting roles and Disney\nOrtega made her acting debut in the sitcom Rob (2012) and later made a guest appearance in the CSI: NY episode \"Unspoken\" [3] [18] In 2013, she made her film debut in a minor role as the vice president's daughter in the superhero film Iron Man 3 [19] In the same year, Ortega appeared in the horror film Insidious: Chapter 2 as a part of the supporting cast [20] From 2014 to 2019, Ortega had a recurring role on The CW comedy television series Jane the Virgin as a younger version of Jane Villanueva, who is portrayed by Gina Rodriguez as an adult [21] Declan Gallagher of Entertainment Weekly commended Ortega's performance, writing that \"she eschews the trappings of a typical child actor\" [21] She also starred in the direct-to-video comedy film The Little Rascals Save the Day (2014) and the Netflix sitcom Richie Rich (2015) [22] [23] Ortega appeared in the comedy-drama film After Words (2015) as Anna Chapa, the daughter of a male escort [24] [25] The Los Angeles Times praised her as \"adorable\", [26] whereas The Arizona Republic found her \"horribly cloying\" [27]\n\n\n2018–2021: Transition to mature roles\nIn 2018, Ortega starred in the film Saving Flora in the lead role of Dawn, a circus owner's daughter [36] [37] After Stuck in the Middle ended, she aimed to act in more mature projects but found people assumed Disney roles were \"all you can do, or all you were meant for\" [3] She considered quitting acting several times, saying that she \"was too old for the young roles and too young for the older roles\" [14] In 2018, she was cast as Ellie Alves in the second season of the Netflix thriller series You, [3] which was released on December 26, 2019 [38] [39] Like the show's first season, the second season received positive reviews;

Officers were also informed by the dispatcher that there was a \"wanted\" alert for someone at the address, indicated by police code 10-99. Blake had a warrant for his arrest from July, based on charges of third-degree sexual assault, trespassing, and disorderly conduct for domestic abuse in May. The woman who called 9-1-1 on August 23 to report that Blake had stolen her keys was the same woman who had previously filed the criminal complaint alleging that Blake had sexually assaulted her. Both Kenosha Police Chief Daniel Miskinis and the Kenosha Professional Police Association stated that the officers dispatched on August 23 were aware of the pending warrant for Blake before they arrived on scene.\n\n## Medical aftermath for Blake\n\nBlake was flown to Froedtert Hospital in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. His father announced on August 25 that Blake was paralyzed from the waist down and that doctors do not yet know if it would be permanent. He also suffered a gunshot wound to one arm and damage to his stomach, kidney, and liver; he had to have most of his small intestines and colon removed. Blake was initially handcuffed to his hospital bed and guarded by two officers due to an outstanding warrant. The handcuffs were removed and the officers stopped guarding Blake after he posted bond.\n\n## Investigation and legal proceedings\n\nKenosha police referred the investigation of the shooting to the Wisconsin Division of Criminal Investigation. The investigation's findings went to district attorney Michael D Graveley, the local official responsible for deciding whether to bring charges against the officers. Graveley stated on August 25, 2020, that the investigation was in \"its earliest stages\". On the same day, the United States Department of Justice also announced an investigation into the shooting. The investigation would look into whether Blake's civil rights were violated. In October 2021, the Department of Justice announced it will not pursue federal civil rights charges against the officer, citing insufficient evidence that proves the officer willfully violated federal civil rights statutes.\n\n## Reactions\n\nProtests followed, leading Kenosha County to declare a state of emergency overnight on August 24 after police vehicles were damaged, a dump truck set on fire, and the local courthouse vandalized. An officer was knocked down with a brick, and tear gas was deployed. Police urged 24-hour businesses to consider closing because of numerous calls about armed robberies and shots being fired. The Wisconsin National Guard was deployed to maintain public safety, with up to 200 members to be deployed. On August 24, the protesters set fires and looted businesses for a second night. On August 25, the protests and fires continued throughout Kenosha, and civilians armed with guns patrolled parts of the city.\n\n## Protests\n\nProtests followed, leading Kenosha County to declare a state of emergency overnight on August 24 after police vehicles were damaged, a dump truck set on fire, and the local courthouse vandalized.

{"title": "Eric_Clapton", "content": "\nEarly life\nClapton was born on 30 March 1945 in Ripley, Surrey, England, to 16-year-old Patricia Molly Clapton (1929–1999) and Edward Walter Fryer (1920–1985), a 25-year-old soldier from Montreal, Quebec [14] Fryer was drafted to war before Clapton's birth and then returned to Canada Clapton grew up believing that his grandmother, Rose, and her second husband, Jack Clapp, Patricia's stepfather, were his parents, and that his mother was actually his older sister The similarity in surnames gave rise to the erroneous belief that Clapton's real surname is Clapp (Reginald Cecil Clapton was the name of Rose's first husband, Eric Clapton's maternal grandfather) [15] Years later, his mother married another Canadian soldier and moved to Germany, [16] leaving Eric with his grandparents in Surrey [17]\n\n\nCareer\nIn October 1963, Clapton joined the Yardbirds, a rhythm and blues band, and stayed with them until March 1965 Synthesising influences from Chicago blues and leading blues guitarists such as Buddy Guy, Freddie King, and B.B King, Clapton forged a distinctive style and rapidly became one of the most talked-about guitarists in the British music scene [21] The band initially played Chess/Checker/Vee-Jay blues numbers and began to attract a large cult following when they took over the Rolling Stones' residency at the Crawdaddy Club in Richmond, London They toured England with American bluesman Sonny Boy Williamson II; a joint LP album, recorded in December 1963, was issued in 1965.\n\n\nThe Yardbirds and the Bluesbreakers\nIn October 1963, Clapton joined the Yardbirds, a rhythm and blues band, and stayed with them until March 1965 Synthesising influences from Chicago blues and leading blues guitarists such as Buddy Guy, Freddie King, and B.B King, Clapton forged a distinctive style and rapidly became one of the most talked-about guitarists in the British music scene [21] The band initially played Chess/Checker/Vee-Jay blues numbers and began to attract a large cult following when they took over the Rolling Stones' residency at the Crawdaddy Club in Richmond, London They toured England with American bluesman Sonny Boy Williamson II; a joint LP album, recorded in December 1963, was issued in 1965.\n\n\nCream\nClapton left the Bluesbreakers in July 1966 (replaced by Peter Green) and was invited by drummer Ginger Baker to play in his newly formed band Cream, one of the earliest supergroups, with Jack Bruce on bass (Bruce was previously of the Bluesbreakers, the Graham Bond Organisation and Manfred Mann) [32] Before the formation of Cream, Clapton was not well known in the United States; he left the Yardbirds before \"For Your Love\" hit the US top ten, and had yet to perform there [33] During his time with Cream, Clapton began to develop as a singer, songwriter and guitarist, though Bruce took most of the lead vocals and wrote the majority of the material with lyricist Pete Brown [21] Cream's first gig was an unofficial performance at the Twisted Wheel Club in Manchester on 29 July 1966 before their full debut two nights later at the National Jazz and Blues Festival in Windsor Cream established its enduring legend with the high-volume blues jamming and extended solos of their live shows.\n\n\nBlind Faith\nClapton's next group, Blind Faith, formed in 1969, was composed of Cream drummer Ginger Baker, Steve Winwood of Traffic, and Ric Grech of Family, and yielded one LP and one arena-circuit tour The supergroup debuted before 100,000 fans in London's Hyde Park on 7 June 1969 [48] They performed several dates in Scandinavia and began a sold-out American tour in July before their only album was released The LP Blind Faith consisted of just six songs, one of them the hit \"Can't Find My Way Home\" Another, \"Presence of the Lord\", is the first song credited solely to Clapton [49] The album's jacket image of a topless pubescent girl was deemed controversial in the US and was replaced by a photograph of the band Blind Faith dissolved after less than seven months [50]\n\n\nDelaney & Bonnie and first solo album\nClapton subsequently toured as a sideman for an act that had opened for Blind Faith, Delaney and Bonnie and Friends He also performed as a member of Lennon's Plastic Ono Band at the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival in September 1969, a recording from which was released as the album Live Peace in Toronto 1969 [51] On 30 September, Clapton played lead guitar on Lennon's second solo single, \"Cold Turkey\" [52] On 15 December that year, Clapton performed with Lennon, Harrison and others as the Plastic Ono Supergroup at a fundraiser for UNICEF in London [51]\n\n\nDerek and the Dominos\nWith the intention of counteracting the \"star\" cult faction that had begun to form around him, Clapton assembled a new band composed of Delaney and Bonnie's former rhythm section, Bobby Whitlock as keyboardist and vocalist, Carl Radle as the bassist, and drummer Jim Gordon, with Clapton playing guitar It was his intention to show that he need not fill a starring role, and functioned well as a member of an ensemble [57] During this period, Clapton was increasingly influenced by The Band and their 1968 album Music from Big Pink, saying: \"What I appreciated about the Band was that they were more concerned with songs and singing They would have three- and four-part harmonies, and the guitar was put back into perspective as being accompaniment That suited me well, because I had gotten so tired of the virtuosity – or pseudo-virtuosity – thing of long, boring guitar solos just because they were expected The Band brought things back into perspective The priority was the song.\" [58]\n\n\nPersonal problems and early solo success\nClapton's career successes in the 1970s were in stark contrast with the struggles he coped with in his personal life, which was troubled by romantic longings and drug and alcohol addiction [66] Still infatuated with Boyd and torn by his friendship with Harrison, he withdrew from recording and touring to isolation in his Surrey residence as the Dominos broke up He nursed a heroin addiction, which resulted in a lengthy career hiatus interrupted only by performing at Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh benefit shows in New York in August 1971; there, he passed out on stage, was revived, and managed to finish his performance [21] In January 1973, the Who's Pete Townshend organised a comeback concert for Clapton at London's Rainbow Theatre, titled the \"Rainbow Concert\", to help Clapton kick his addiction Clapton returned the favour by playing \"The Preacher\" in Ken Russell's film version of the Who's Tommy in 1975 His appearance in the film (performing \"Eyesight to the Blind\") is notable as he is clearly wearing a fake beard in some shots, the result of deciding to shave off his real beard after the initial takes in an attempt to force the director to remove his earlier scene from the film and leave the set [60]\n\n\nContinued success\nIn 1981, Clapton was invited by producer Martin Lewis to appear at the Amnesty International benefit The Secret Policeman's Other Ball in London Clapton accepted the invitation and teamed up with Jeff Beck to perform a series of duets – reportedly their first ever billed stage collaboration Three of the performances were released on the album of the show, and one of the songs appeared in the film The performances at London's Drury Lane theatre heralded a return to form and prominence for Clapton in the new decade Many factors had influenced Clapton's comeback, including his \"deepening commitment to Christianity\", to which he had converted prior to his heroin addiction [70] [71] [72]\n\n\nSon's death, \"Tears in Heaven\"\nThe 1990s brought a series of 32 concerts to the Royal Albert Hall, such as the 24 Nights series of concerts that took place around January through February 1990, and February to March 1991 On 30 June 1990, Dire Straits, Clapton and Elton John made a guest appearance in the Nordoff-Robbins charity show held at Knebworth in England [82] On 27 August 1990, fellow blues guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan, who was touring with Clapton, and three members of their road crew were killed in a helicopter crash between concerts Then, on 20 March 1991, Clapton's four-year-old son, Conor, died after falling from the 53rd-floor window of his mother's friend's New York City apartment at 117 East 57th Street Clapton was informed of his son's death through a hysterical phone call by the boy's mother Lory Del Santo Once comprehending what had happened he described feeling like he \"went off the edge of the world\" and ran to the scene The first person to offer condolences towards Clapton was friend and fellow guitarist Keith Richards, who himself had lost his young son Tara in 1976 [83] Conor's funeral took place on 28 March at St Mary Magdalene's Church in Clapton's home village in Ripley, Surrey, with Conor buried in the church graveyard [84] After his son's death Clapton began attending AA meetings [83] In 1991, Clapton appeared on Richie Sambora's album, Stranger in This Town, in a song dedicated to him, called \"Mr Bluesman\" He contributed guitar and vocals to \"Runaway Train\", a duet with Elton John on the latter's The One album the following year [85]\n\n\nCollaboration albums\nClapton released the album  Reptile in March 2001 One month after the 11 September attacks, Clapton appeared at the Concert for New York

Real Music Observer that he was working on a new studio album, titled Meanwhile, with the hopes of releasing it in the fall of that year [148]\n\n\nInfluences\nClapton cites Muddy Waters, Freddie King, B.B King, Albert King, Buddy Guy, and Hubert Sumlin as guitar-playing influences In his 2007 autobiography, Clapton refers to Muddy Waters as \"the father figure I never really had\" Until his death in 1983, Waters was a part of Clapton's life \"When I got to know Muddy, unfortunately, my drinking career was in full sway.\" [149] In 2000, Clapton collaborated with B.B King on their album

Clapton played a Fender Telecaster, a Fender Jazzmaster, a double-cutaway Gretsch 6120, and a 1964 Cherry-Red Gibson ES-335 He became exclusively a Gibson player for a period beginning in mid-1965, when he purchased a used sunburst Gibson Les Paul guitar from a guitar store in London Clapton commented on the slim profile of the neck, which would indicate it was a 1960 model [163]\n\n\nOther

joined the Yardbirds, a rhythm and blues band, and stayed with them until March 1965 Synthesising influences from Chicago blues and leading blues guitarists such as Buddy Guy, Freddie King, and B.B King, Clapton forged a distinctive style and rapidly became one of the most talked-about guitarists in the British music scene [21] The band initially played Chess/Checker/Vee-Jay blues numbers and began to attract a large cult following when they took over the Rolling Stones' residency at the Crawdaddy Club in Richmond, London They toured England with American bluesman Sonny Boy Williamson II; a joint LP album, recorded in December 1963, was issued in 1965.\n\n\nThe Yardbirds and the Bluesbreakers\nIn October 1963, Clapton joined the Yardbirds, a rhythm and blues band, and stayed with them until March 1965 Synthesising influences from Chicago blues and leading blues guitarists such as Buddy Guy, Freddie King, and B.B King, Clapton forged a distinctive style and rapidly became one of the most talked-about guitarists in the British music scene [21] The band initially played Chess/Checker/Vee-Jay blues numbers and began to attract a large cult following when they took over the Rolling Stones' residency at the Crawdaddy Club in Richmond, London They toured England with American bluesman Sonny Boy Williamson II; a joint LP album, recorded in December 1963, was issued in 1965.\n\n\nCream\nClapton left the Bluesbreakers in July 1966 (replaced by Peter Green) and was invited by drummer Ginger Baker to play in his newly formed band Cream, one of the earliest supergroups, with Jack Bruce on bass (Bruce was previously of the Bluesbreakers, the Graham Bond Organisation and Manfred Mann) [32] Before the formation of Cream, Clapton was not well known in the United States; he left the Yardbirds before \"For Your Love\" hit the US top ten, and had yet to perform there [33] During his time with Cream, Clapton began to develop as a singer, songwriter and guitarist, though Bruce took most of the lead vocals and wrote the majority of the material with lyricist Pete Brown [21] Cream's first gig was an unofficial performance at the Twisted Wheel Club in Manchester on 29 July 1966 before their full debut two nights later at the National Jazz and Blues Festival in Windsor Cream established its enduring legend with the high-volume blues jamming and extended solos of their live shows.\n\n\nBlind Faith\nClapton's next group, Blind Faith, formed in 1969, was composed of Cream drummer Ginger Baker, Steve Winwood of Traffic, and Ric Grech of Family, and yielded one LP and one arena-circuit tour The supergroup debuted before 100,000 fans in London's Hyde Park on 7 June 1969 [48] They performed several dates in Scandinavia and began a sold-out American tour in July before their only album was released The LP Blind Faith consisted of just six songs, one of them the hit \"Can't Find My Way Home\" Another, \"Presence of the Lord\", is the first song credited solely to Clapton [49] The album's jacket image of a topless pubescent girl was deemed controversial in the US and was replaced by a photograph of the band Blind Faith dissolved after less than seven months [50]\n\n\nDelaney & Bonnie and first solo album\nClapton subsequently toured as a sideman for an act that had opened for Blind Faith, Delaney and Bonnie and Friends He also performed as a member of Lennon's Plastic Ono Band at the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival in September 1969, a recording from which was released as the album Live Peace in Toronto 1969 [51] On 30 September, Clapton played lead guitar on Lennon's second solo single, \"Cold Turkey\" [52] On 15 December that year, Clapton performed with Lennon, Harrison and others as the Plastic Ono Supergroup at a fundraiser for UNICEF in London [51]\n\n\nDerek and the Dominos\nWith the intention of counteracting the \"star\" cult faction that had begun to form around him, Clapton assembled a new band composed of Delaney and Bonnie's former rhythm section, Bobby Whitlock as keyboardist and vocalist, Carl Radle as the bassist, and drummer Jim Gordon, with Clapton playing guitar It was his intention to show that he need not fill a starring role, and functioned well as a member of an ensemble [57] During this period, Clapton was increasingly influenced by The Band and their 1968 album Music from Big Pink, saying: \"What I appreciated about the Band was that they were more concerned with songs and singing They would have three- and four-part harmonies, and the guitar was put back into perspective as being accompaniment That suited me well, because I had gotten so tired of the virtuosity – or pseudo-virtuosity – thing of long, boring guitar solos just because they were expected The Band brought things back into perspective The priority was the song.\" [58]\n\n\nPersonal problems and early solo success\nClapton's career successes in the 1970s were in stark contrast with the struggles he coped with in his personal life, which was troubled by romantic longings and drug and alcohol addiction [66] Still infatuated with Boyd and torn by his friendship with Harrison, he withdrew from recording and touring to isolation in his Surrey residence as the Dominos broke up He nursed a heroin addiction, which resulted in a lengthy career hiatus interrupted only by performing at Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh benefit shows in New York in August 1971; there, he passed out on stage, was revived, and managed to finish his performance [21] In January 1973, the Who's Pete Townshend organised a comeback concert for Clapton at London's Rainbow Theatre, titled the \"Rainbow Concert\", to help Clapton kick his addiction Clapton returned the favour by playing \"The Preacher\" in Ken Russell's film version of the Who's Tommy in 1975 His appearance in the film (performing \"Eyesight to the Blind\") is notable as he is clearly wearing a fake beard in some shots, the result of deciding to shave off his real beard after the initial takes in an attempt to force the director to remove his earlier scene from the film and leave the set [60]\n\n\nContinued success\nIn 1981, Clapton was invited by producer Martin Lewis to appear at the Amnesty International benefit The Secret Policeman's Other Ball in London Clapton accepted the invitation and teamed up with Jeff Beck to perform a series of duets – reportedly their first ever billed stage collaboration Three of the performances were released on the album of the show, and one of the songs appeared in the film The performances at London's Drury Lane theatre heralded a return to form and prominence for Clapton in the new decade Many factors had influenced Clapton's comeback, including his \"deepening commitment to Christianity\", to which he had converted prior to his heroin addiction [70] [71] [72]\n\n\nSon's death, \"Tears in Heaven\"\nThe 1990s brought a series of 32 concerts to the Royal Albert Hall, such as the 24 Nights series of concerts that took place around January through February 1990, and February to March 1991 On 30 June 1990, Dire Straits, Clapton and Elton John made a guest appearance in the Nordoff-Robbins charity show held at

concerts Then, on 20 March 1991, Clapton's four-year-old son, Conor, died after falling from the 53rd-floor window of his mother's friend's New York City apartment at 117 East 57th Street Clapton was informed of his son's death through a hysterical phone call by the boy's mother Lory Del Santo Once comprehending what had happened he described feeling like he \"went off the edge of the world\" and ran to the scene The first person to offer condolences towards Clapton was friend and fellow guitarist Keith Richards, who himself had lost his young son Tara in 1976 [83] Conor's funeral took place on 28 March at St Mary Magdalene's Church in Clapton's home village in Ripley, Surrey, with Conor buried in the church graveyard [84] After his son's death Clapton began attending AA meetings [83] In 1991, Clapton appeared on Richie Sambora's album, Stranger in This Town, in a song dedicated to him, called \"Mr Bluesman\" He contributed guitar and vocals to \"Runaway Train\", a duet with Elton John on the latter's The One album the following year [85]\n\n\nCollaboration albums\nClapton released the album  Reptile in March 2001 One month after the 11 September attacks, Clapton appeared at

Clapton played a Fender Telecaster, a Fender Jazzmaster, a double-cutaway Gretsch 6120, and a 1964 Cherry-Red Gibson ES-335 He became exclusively a Gibson player for a period beginning in mid-1965, when he purchased a used sunburst Gibson Les Paul guitar from a guitar store in London Clapton commented on the slim profile of the neck, which would indicate it was a 1960 model [163]\n\n\nOther
