[150] Gauguin was almost certainly absent from the Yellow House that night, most likely staying in a hotel [149]\n\n\nSaint-Rémy (May 1889 – May 1890)\nVan Gogh entered the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum on 8 May 1889, accompanied by his caregiver, Frédéric Salles, a Protestant clergyman Saint-Paul was a former monastery in Saint-Rémy, located less than 30 kilometres (19 mi) from Arles, and it was run by a former naval doctor, Théophile Peyron Van Gogh had two cells with barred windows, one of which he used as a studio [175] The clinic and its garden became the main subjects of his paintings He made several studies of the hospital's interiors, such as Vestibule of the Asylum and Saint-Rémy (September 1889), and its gardens, such as Lilacs (May 1889) Some of his works from this time are characterised by swirls, such as The Starry Night He was allowed short supervised walks, during which time he painted cypresses and olive trees, including Valley with Ploughman Seen from Above, Olive Trees with the Alpilles in the Background 1889, Cypresses 1889, Cornfield with Cypresses (1889), Country road in Provence by Night (1890) In September 1889, he produced two further versions of Bedroom in Arles and The Gardener [176]\n\n\n1890 Exhibitions and recognition\nAlbert Aurier praised his work in the Mercure de France in January 1890 and described him as \"a genius\" [188] In February, van Gogh painted five versions of L'Arlésienne (Madame Ginoux), based on a charcoal sketch Gauguin had produced when she sat for both artists in November 1888 [189] [note 10] Also in February, van Gogh was invited by Les XX, a society of avant-garde painters in Brussels, to participate in their annual exhibition At the opening dinner a Les XX member, Henry de Groux, insulted van Gogh's work Toulouse-Lautrec demanded satisfaction, and Signac declared he would continue to fight for van Gogh's honour if Lautrec surrendered De Groux apologised for the slight and left the group [190]\n\n\nAuvers-sur-Oise (May–July 1890)\nIn May 1890, van Gogh left the clinic in Saint-Rémy to move nearer to both Dr Paul Gachet in the Paris suburb of Auvers-sur-Oise and to Theo Gachet was an amateur painter and had treated several other artists – Camille Pissarro had recommended him Van Gogh's first impression was that Gachet was \"iller than I am, it seemed to me, or let's say just as much.\" [193]\n\n\nDeath\nOn 27 July 1890 (Sunday), aged 37, van Gogh shot himself in the chest with a revolver [203] The shooting may have taken place in the wheat field in which he had been painting, or in a local barn [204] The bullet was deflected by a rib and passed through his chest without doing apparent damage to internal organs – possibly stopped by his spine He was able to walk back to the Auberge Ravoux, where he was attended to by two doctors One of them, Dr Gachet, served as a war surgeon in 1870 and had extensive knowledge of gunshots Vincent was possibly attended to during the night by Dr Gachet's son Paul Louis Gachet and the innkeeper, Arthur Ravoux The following morning, Theo rushed to his brother's side, finding him in good spirits But within hours Vincent's health began to fail, suffering from an infection resulting from the wound He died in the early hours of Tuesday, 29 July According to Theo, Vincent's last words were: \"The sadness will last forever\" [205] [206] [207] [208]\n\n\nStyle and works\nVan Gogh drew and painted with watercolours while at school, but only a few examples survive and the authorship of some has been challenged [215] When he took up art as an adult, he began at an elementary level In early 1882, his uncle, Cornelis Marinus, owner of a well-known gallery of contemporary art in Amsterdam, asked for drawings of The Hague Van Gogh's work did not live up to expectations Marinus offered a second commission, specifying the subject matter in detail, but was again disappointed with the result Van Gogh persevered; he experimented with lighting in his studio using variable shutters and different drawing materials For more than a year he worked on single figures – highly elaborate studies in black and white, [note 11] which at the time gained him only criticism Later, they were recognised as early masterpieces [217]\n\n\nArtistic development\nVan Gogh drew and painted with watercolours while at school, but only a few examples survive and the authorship of some has been challenged [215] When he took up art as an adult, he began at an elementary level In early 1882, his uncle, Cornelis Marinus, owner of a well-known gallery of contemporary art in Amsterdam, asked for drawings of The Hague Van Gogh's work did not live up to expectations Marinus offered a second commission, specifying the subject matter in detail, but was again disappointed with the result Van Gogh persevered;

he rarely painted Theo, van Rappard or Bernard The portraits of his mother were from photographs [246]\n\n\nSelf-portraits\nVan Gogh created more than 43 self-portraits between 1885 and 1889 [248] [note 13] They were usually completed in series, such as those painted in Paris in mid-1887, and continued until shortly before his death [249] Generally the portraits were studies, created during periods when he was reluctant to mix with others or when he lacked models and painted himself [240] [250]\n\n\nFlowers\nVan Gogh painted several landscapes with flowers, including roses, lilacs, irises, and sunflowers Some reflect his interests in the language of colour, and also in Japanese ukiyo-e [258] There are two series of dying sunflowers The first was painted in Paris in 1887 and shows flowers lying on the ground The second set was completed a year later in Arles and is of bouquets in a vase positioned in early morning light [259] Both are built from thickly layered paintwork, which, according to the London National Gallery, evokes the \"texture of the seed-heads\" [260]\n\n\nCypresses and olives\nFifteen canvases depict cypresses, a tree he became fascinated with in Arles [264] He brought life to the trees, which were traditionally seen as emblematic of death [230] The series of cypresses he began in Arles featured the trees in the distance, as windbreaks in fields; when he was at Saint-Rémy he brought them to the foreground [265] Vincent wrote to Theo in May 1889: \"Cypresses still preoccupy me, I should like to do something with them like my canvases of sunflowers\"; he went on to say, \"They are beautiful in line and proportion like an Egyptian obelisk.\" [266]\n\n\nOrchards\nThe Flowering Orchards (also the Orchards in Blossom) are among the first groups of work completed after van Gogh's arrival in Arles in February 1888 The 14 paintings are optimistic, joyous and visually expressive of the burgeoning spring They are delicately sensitive and unpopulated He painted swiftly, and although he brought to this series a version of Impressionism, a strong sense of personal style began to emerge during this period The transience of the blossoming trees, and the passing of the season, seemed to align with his sense of impermanence and belief in a new beginning in Arles During the blossoming of the trees that spring, he found \"a world of motifs that could not have been more Japanese\" [270] Vincent wrote to Theo on 21 April 1888 that he had 10 orchards and \"one big  [painting] of a cherry tree, which I've spoiled\" [271]\n\n\nWheat fields\nVan Gogh made several painting excursions during visits to the landscape around Arles He made paintings of harvests, wheat fields and other rural landmarks of the area, including The Old Mill (1888); a good example of a picturesque structure bordering the wheat fields beyond [123] At various points, van Gogh painted the view from his window – at The Hague, Antwerp, and Paris These works culminated in The Wheat Field series, which depicted the view from his cells in the asylum at Saint-Rémy [274]\n\n\nReputation and legacy\nAfter van Gogh's first exhibitions in the late 1880s, his reputation grew steadily among artists, art critics, dealers and collectors [280] In 1887, André Antoine hung van Gogh's alongside works of Georges Seurat and Paul Signac, at the Théâtre Libre in Paris; some were acquired by Julien Tanguy [281] In 1889, his work was described in the journal Le Moderniste Illustré by Albert Aurier as characterised by \"fire, intensity, sunshine\" [282] Ten paintings were shown at the Société des Artistes Indépendants, in Brussels in January 1890 [283] French president Marie François Sadi Carnot was said to have been impressed by van Gogh's work [284]\n\n\nVan Gogh Museum\nVan Gogh's nephew and namesake, Vincent Willem van Gogh (1890–1978), [311] inherited the estate after his mother's death in 1925 During the early 1950s he arranged for the publication of a complete edition of the letters presented in four volumes and several languages He then began negotiations with the Dutch government to subsidise a foundation to purchase and house the entire collection [312] Theo's son participated in planning the project in the hope that the works would be exhibited under the best possible conditions The project began in 1963; architect Gerrit Rietveld was commissioned to design it, and after his death in 1964 Kisho Kurokawa took charge [313] Work progressed throughout the 1960s, with 1972 as the target for its grand opening [311]\n\n\nNazi-looted art\nDuring the Nazi period (1933–1945) a great number of artworks by van Gogh changed hands, many of them looted from Jewish collectors who were forced into exile or murdered Some of these works have disappeared into private collections Others have since resurfaced in museums, or at auction, or have been reclaimed, often in high-profile lawsuits, by their former owners [317] [318] The German Lost Art Foundation still lists dozens of missing van Goghs [319] and the American Alliance of Museums lists 73 van Goghs on the Nazi Era Provenance Internet Portal [320]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Vincent van Gogh**\n\nVincent Willem van Gogh was a Dutch post-impressionist painter who is widely regarded as one of the greatest painters in history. He is known for his bold and expressive use of color, his thick and textured brushwork, and his emotive and often unsettling subject matter.\n\n**Life**\n\nVincent van Gogh was born on 30 March 1853 in Groot-Zundert, in the predominantly Catholic province of North Brabant in the Netherlands. He was the oldest surviving child of Theodorus van Gogh (1822–1885), a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church, and his wife, Anna Cornelia Carbentus (1819–1907). Van Gogh was given the name of his grandfather and of a brother stillborn exactly a year before his birth. His grandfather, Vincent (1789–1874), was a prominent art dealer and a theology graduate from the University of Leiden in 1811. This Vincent had six sons, three of whom became art dealers, and may have been named after his great-uncle, a sculptor (1729–1802).\n\n**Early years**\n\nVincent Willem van Gogh was born on 30 March 1853 in Groot-Zundert, in the predominantly Catholic province of North Brabant in the Netherlands.

This Vincent had six sons, three of whom became art dealers, and may have been named after his great-uncle, a sculptor (1729–1802).\n\n**Etten, Drenthe and The Hague**\n\nVan Gogh returned to Etten in April 1881 for an extended stay with his parents. He continued to draw, often using his neighbours as subjects. In August 1881, his recently widowed cousin, Cornelia \"Kee\" Vos-Stricker, daughter of his mother's older sister Willemina and Johannes Stricker, arrived for a visit. He was thrilled and took long walks with her. Kee was seven years older than he was and had an eight-year-old son. Van Gogh surprised everyone by declaring his love to her and proposing marriage. She refused with the words \"No, nay, never\" (\"nooit, neen, nimmer\"). After Kee returned to Amsterdam, van Gogh went to The Hague to try to sell paintings and to meet with his second cousin, Anton Mauve. Mauve was the successful artist van Gogh longed to be. Mauve invited him to return in a few months and suggested he spend the intervening time working in charcoal and pastels; van Gogh returned to Etten and followed this advice.\n\n**Emerging artist**\n\nIn Nuenen, van Gogh focused on painting and drawing. Working outside and very quickly, he completed sketches and paintings of weavers and their cottages. Van Gogh also completed The Parsonage Garden at Nuenen, which was stolen from the Singer Laren in March 2020. From August 1884, Margot Begemann, a neighbour's daughter ten years his senior, joined him on his forays; she fell in love and he reciprocated, though less enthusiastically. They wanted to marry, but neither side of their families approved. Margot was distraught and took an overdose of strychnine, but survived after van Gogh rushed her to a nearby hospital. On 26 March 1885, his father died of a heart attack.\n\n**Nuenen and Antwerp (1883–1886)**\n\nIn Nuenen, van Gogh focused on painting and drawing.

On 26 March 1885, his father died of a heart attack.\n\n**Paris (1886–1888)**\n\nVan Gogh moved to Paris in March 1886, where he shared Theo's rue Laval apartment in Montmartre and studied at Fernand Cormon's studio. In June the brothers took a larger flat at 54 rue Lepic. In Paris, Vincent painted portraits of friends and acquaintances, still life paintings, views of Le Moulin de la Galette, scenes in Montmartre, Asnières and along the Seine. In 1885 in Antwerp he had become interested in Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints and had used them to decorate the walls of his studio; while in Paris he collected hundreds of them. He tried his hand at Japonaiserie, tracing a figure from a reproduction on the cover of the magazine Paris Illustre, The Courtesan or Oiran (1887), after Keisai Eisen, which he then graphically enlarged in a painting.\n\n**Artistic breakthrough**\n\nIll from drink and suffering from smoker's cough, in February 1888, van Gogh sought refuge in Arles. He seems to have moved with thoughts of founding an art colony. The Danish artist Christian Mourier-Petersen was his companion for two months and at first, Arles appeared exotic to van Gogh. In a letter, he described it as a foreign country: \"The Zouaves, the brothels, the adorable little Arlesienne going to her First Communion, the priest in his surplice, who looks like a dangerous rhinoceros, the people drinking absinthe, all seem to me creatures from another world.\"\n\n**Arles (1888–89)**\n\nIll from drink and suffering from smoker's cough, in February 1888, van Gogh sought refuge in Arles.

In a letter, he described it as a foreign country: \"The Zouaves, the brothels, the adorable little Arlesienne going to her First Communion, the priest in his surplice, who looks like a dangerous rhinoceros, the people drinking absinthe, all seem to me creatures from another world.\"\n\n**Gauguin's visit (1888)**\n\nWhen Gauguin agreed to visit Arles in 1888, van Gogh hoped for friendship and to realise his idea of an artists' collective. Van Gogh prepared for Gauguin's arrival by painting four versions of Sunflowers in one week. \"In the hope of living in a studio of our own with Gauguin,\" he wrote in a letter to Theo, \"I'd like to do a decoration for the studio Nothing but large Sunflowers.\"\n\n**Hospital in Arles (December 1888)**\n\nThe exact sequence that led to the mutilation of van Gogh's ear is not known. Gauguin said, fifteen years later, that the night followed several instances of physically threatening behaviour. Their relationship was complex and Theo may have owed money to Gauguin, who suspected the brothers were exploiting him financially. It seems likely that Vincent realised that Gauguin was planning to leave.\n\n**Saint-Rémy (May 1889 – May 1890)**\n\nVan Gogh entered the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum on 8 May 1889, accompanied by his caregiver, Frédéric Salles, a Protestant clergyman. Saint-Paul was a former monastery in Saint-Rémy, located less than 30 kilometres (19 mi) from Arles, and it was run by a former naval doctor, Théophile Peyron. Van Gogh had two cells with barred windows, one of which he used as a studio. The clinic and its garden became the main subjects of his paintings. He made several studies of the hospital's interiors, such as Vestibule of the Asylum and Saint-Rémy (September 1889), and its gardens, such as Lilacs (May 1890).\n\n**1890 Exhibitions and recognition**\n\nAlbert Aurier praised his work in the Mercure de France in January 1890 and described him as \"a genius.\" In February, van Gogh painted five versions of L'Arlésienne (Madame Ginoux), based on a charcoal sketch Gauguin had produced when she sat for both artists in November 1888. Also in February, van Gogh was invited by Les XX, a society of avant-garde painters in Brussels, to participate in their annual exhibition. At the opening dinner a Les XX member, Henry de Groux, insulted van Gogh's work Toulouse-Lautrec demanded satisfaction, and Signac declared he would continue to fight for van Gogh's honour if Lautrec surrendered. De Groux apologised for the slight and left the group.\n\n**Auvers-sur-Oise (May–July 1890)**\n\nIn May 1890, van Gogh left the clinic in Saint-Rémy to move nearer to both Dr Paul Gachet in the Paris suburb of Auvers-sur-Oise and to Theo. Gachet was an amateur painter and had treated several other artists – Camille Pissarro had recommended him.\n\n**Death**\n\nOn 27 July 1890 (Sunday), aged 37, van Gogh shot himself in the chest with a revolver. The shooting may have taken place in the wheat field in which he had been painting, or in a local barn. The bullet was deflected by a rib and passed through his chest without doing apparent damage to internal organs – possibly stopped by his spine. He was able to walk back to the Auberge Ravoux, where he was attended to by two doctors. One of them, Dr Gachet, served as a war surgeon in 1870 and had extensive knowledge of gunshots. Vincent was possibly attended to during the night by Dr Gachet's son Paul Louis Gachet and the innkeeper, Arthur Ravoux. The following morning, Theo rushed to his brother's side, finding him in good spirits. But within hours Vincent's health began to fail, suffering from an infection resulting from the wound. He died in the early hours of Tuesday, 29 July. According to Theo, Vincent's last words were: \"The sadness will last forever.\"\n\n**Style and works**\n\nVan Gogh drew and painted with watercolours while at school, but only a few examples survive and the authorship of some has been challenged. When he took up art as an adult, he began at an elementary level. In early 1882, his uncle, Cornelis Marinus, owner of a well-known gallery of contemporary art in Amsterdam, asked for drawings of The Hague. Van Gogh's work did not live up to expectations. Marinus offered a second commission, specifying the subject matter in detail, but was again disappointed with the result. Van Gogh persevered; he experimented with lighting in his studio using variable shutters and different drawing materials. For more than a year he worked on single figures – highly elaborate studies in black and white, which at the time gained him only criticism. Later, they were recognised as early masterpieces.\n\n**Major series**\n\nVan Gogh's stylistic developments are usually linked to the periods he spent living in different places across Europe. He was inclined to immerse himself in local cultures and lighting conditions, although he maintained a highly individual visual outlook throughout. His evolution as an artist was slow and he was aware of his painterly limitations. Van Gogh moved home often, perhaps to expose himself to new visual stimuli, and through exposure develop his technical skill. Art historian Melissa McQuillan believes the moves also reflect later stylistic changes and that van Gogh used the moves to avoid conflict, and as a coping mechanism for when the idealistic artist was faced with the realities of his then current situation.\n\n**Portraits**\n\nVan Gogh said portraiture was his greatest interest \"What I'm most passionate about, much much more than all the rest in my profession\", he wrote in 1890, \"is the portrait, the modern portrait.\" It is \"the only thing in painting that moves me deeply and that gives me a sense of the infinite.\" He wrote to his sister that he wished to paint portraits that would endure, and that he would use colour to capture their emotions and character rather than aiming for photographic realism. Those closest to van Gogh are mostly absent from his portraits; he rarely painted Theo, van Rappard or Bernard. The portraits of his mother were from photographs.\n\n**Self-portraits**\n\nVan Gogh created more than 43 self-portraits between 1885 and 1889. They were usually completed in series, such as those painted in Paris in mid-1887, and continued until shortly before his death. Generally the portraits were studies, created during periods when he was reluctant to mix with others or when he lacked models and painted himself.\n\n**Flowers**\n\nVan Gogh painted several landscapes with flowers, including roses, lilacs, irises, and sunflowers. Some reflect his interests in the language of colour, and also in Japanese ukiyo-e. There are two series of dying sunflowers. The first was painted in Paris in 1887 and shows flowers lying on the ground. The second set was completed a year later in Arles and is of bouquets in a vase positioned in early morning light. Both are built from thickly layered paintwork, which, according to the London National Gallery, evokes the \"texture of the seed-heads\".\n\n**Cypresses and olives**\n\nFifteen canvases depict cypresses, a tree he became fascinated with in Arles. He brought life to the trees, which were traditionally seen as emblematic of death. The series of cypresses he began in Arles featured the trees in the distance, as windbreaks in fields; when he was at Saint-Rémy he brought them to the foreground. Vincent wrote to Theo in May 1889: \"Cypresses still preoccupy me, I should like to do something with them like my canvases of sunflowers\"; he went on to say, \"They are beautiful in line and proportion like an Egyptian obelisk.\"\n\n**Orchards**\n\nThe Flowering Orchards (also the Orchards in Blossom) are among the first groups of work completed after van Gogh's arrival in Arles in February 1888. The 14 paintings are optimistic, joyous and visually expressive of the burgeoning spring. They are delicately sensitive and unpopulated. Van Gogh painted swiftly, and although he brought to this series a version of Impressionism, a strong sense of personal style began to emerge during this period. The transience of the blossoming trees, and the passing of the season, seemed to align with his sense of impermanence and belief in a new beginning in Arles During the blossoming of the trees that spring, he found \"a world of motifs that could not have been more Japanese\".\n\n**Wheat fields**\n\nVan Gogh made several painting excursions during visits to the landscape around Arles. He made paintings of harvests, wheat fields and other rural landmarks of the area, including The Old Mill (1888); a good example of a picturesque structure bordering the wheat fields beyond. At various points, van Gogh painted the view from his window – at The Hague, Antwerp, and Paris. These works culminated in The Wheat Field series, which depicted the view from his cells in the asylum at Saint-Rémy.\n\n**Reputation and legacy**\n\nAfter van Gogh's first exhibitions in the late 1880s, his reputation grew steadily among artists, art critics, dealers and collectors. In 1887, André Antoine hung van Gogh's alongside works of Georges Seurat and Paul Signac, at the Théâtre Libre in Paris; some were acquired by Julien Tanguy. In 1889, his work was described in the journal Le Moderniste Illustré by Albert Aurier as characterised by \"fire, intensity, sunshine\". Ten paintings were shown at the Société des Artistes Indépendants, in Brussels in January 1890. French president Marie François Sadi Carnot was said to have been impressed by van Gogh's work.\n\n**Van Gogh Museum**\n\nVan Gogh's nephew and namesake, Vincent Willem van Gogh (1890–1978), inherited the estate after his mother's death in 1925. During the early 1950s he arranged for the publication of a complete edition of the letters presented in four volumes and several languages. He then began negotiations with the Dutch government to subsidise a foundation to purchase and house the entire collection. Theo's son participated in planning the project in the hope that the works would be exhibited under the best possible conditions. The project began in 1963; architect Gerrit Rietveld was commissioned to design it, and after his death in 1964 Kisho Kurokawa took charge. Work progressed throughout the 1960s, with 1972 as the target for its grand opening.\n\n**Nazi-looted art**\n\nDuring the Nazi period (1933–1945) a great number of artworks by van Gogh changed hands, many of them looted from Jewish collectors who were forced into exile or murdered. Some of these works have disappeared into private collections. Others have since resurfaced in museums, or at auction, or have been reclaimed, often in high-profile lawsuits, by their former owners.

van Gogh returned to Etten and followed this advice [64]\n\n\nEmerging artist\nIn Nuenen, van Gogh focused on painting and drawing Working outside and very quickly, he completed sketches and paintings of weavers and their cottages Van Gogh also completed The Parsonage Garden at Nuenen, which was stolen from the Singer Laren in March 2020 [89] [90] From August 1884, Margot Begemann, a neighbour's daughter ten years his senior, joined him on his forays; she fell in love and he reciprocated, though less enthusiastically They wanted to marry, but neither side of their families approved Margot was distraught and took an overdose of strychnine, but survived after van Gogh rushed her to a nearby hospital [82] On 26 March 1885, his father died of a heart attack [91]\n\n\nNuenen and Antwerp (1883–1886)\nIn Nuenen, van Gogh focused on painting and drawing Working outside and very quickly, he completed sketches and paintings of weavers and their cottages Van Gogh also completed The Parsonage Garden at Nuenen, which was stolen from the Singer Laren in March 2020 [89] [90] From August 1884, Margot Begemann, a neighbour's daughter ten years his senior, joined him on his forays;

while in Paris he collected hundreds of them He tried his hand at Japonaiserie, tracing a figure from a reproduction on the cover of the magazine Paris Illustre, The Courtesan or Oiran (1887), after Keisai Eisen, which he then graphically enlarged in a painting [110]\n\n\nArtistic breakthrough\nIll from drink and suffering from smoker's cough, in February 1888, van Gogh sought refuge in Arles [15] He seems to have moved with thoughts of founding an art colony The Danish artist Christian Mourier-Petersen was his companion for two months and at first, Arles appeared exotic to van Gogh In a letter, he described it as a foreign country: \"The Zouaves, the brothels, the adorable little Arlésienne going to her First Communion, the priest in his surplice, who looks like a dangerous rhinoceros, the people drinking absinthe, all seem to me creatures from another world.\" [121]\n\n\nArles (1888–89)\nIll from drink and suffering from smoker's cough, in February 1888, van Gogh sought refuge in Arles [15] He seems to have moved with thoughts of founding an art colony The Danish artist Christian Mourier-Petersen was his companion for two months and at first, Arles appeared exotic to van Gogh In a letter, he described it as a foreign country: \"The Zouaves, the brothels, the adorable little Arlésienne going to her First Communion, the priest in his surplice, who looks like a dangerous rhinoceros, the people drinking absinthe, all seem to me creatures from another world.\" [121]\n\n\nGauguin's visit (1888)\nWhen Gauguin agreed to visit Arles in 1888, van Gogh hoped for friendship and to realise his idea of an artists' collective Van Gogh prepared for Gauguin's arrival by painting four versions of Sunflowers in one week [134] \"In the hope of living in a studio of our own with Gauguin,\" he wrote in a letter to Theo, \"I'd like to do a decoration for the studio Nothing but large Sunflowers.\" [135]\n\n\nHospital in Arles (December 1888)\nThe exact sequence that led to the mutilation of van Gogh's ear is not known Gauguin said, fifteen years later, that the night followed several instances of physically threatening behaviour [147] Their relationship was complex and Theo may have owed money to Gauguin, who suspected the brothers were exploiting him financially [148] It seems likely that Vincent realised that Gauguin was planning to leave [148] The following days saw heavy rain, leading to the two men being shut in the Yellow House [149] Gauguin recalled that van Gogh followed him after he left for a walk and \"rushed towards me, an open razor in his hand.\" [149] This account is uncorroborated; [150] Gauguin was almost certainly absent from the Yellow House that night, most likely staying in a hotel [149]\n\n\nSaint-Rémy (May 1889 – May 1890)\nVan Gogh entered the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum on 8 May 1889, accompanied by his caregiver, Frédéric Salles, a Protestant clergyman Saint-Paul was a former monastery in Saint-Rémy, located less than 30 kilometres (19 mi) from Arles, and it was run by a former naval doctor, Théophile Peyron Van Gogh had two cells with barred windows, one of which he used as a studio [175] The clinic and its garden became the main subjects of his paintings He made several studies of the hospital's interiors, such as Vestibule of the Asylum and Saint-Rémy (September 1889), and its gardens, such as Lilacs (May 1889) Some of his works from this time are characterised by swirls, such as The Starry Night He was allowed short supervised walks, during which time he painted cypresses and olive trees, including Valley with Ploughman Seen from Above, Olive Trees with the Alpilles in the Background 1889, Cypresses 1889, Cornfield with Cypresses (1889), Country road in Provence by Night (1890) In September 1889, he produced two further versions of Bedroom in Arles and The Gardener [176]\n\n\n1890 Exhibitions and recognition\nAlbert Aurier praised his work in the Mercure de France in January 1890 and described him as \"a genius\" [188] In February, van Gogh painted five versions of L'Arlésienne (Madame Ginoux), based on a charcoal sketch Gauguin had produced when she sat for both artists in November 1888 [189] [note 10] Also in February, van Gogh was invited by Les XX, a society of avant-garde painters in Brussels, to participate in their annual exhibition At the opening dinner a Les XX member, Henry de Groux, insulted van Gogh's work Toulouse-Lautrec demanded satisfaction, and Signac declared he would continue to fight for van Gogh's honour if Lautrec surrendered De Groux apologised for the slight and left the group [190]\n\n\nAuvers-sur-Oise (May–July 1890)\nIn May 1890, van Gogh left the clinic in Saint-Rémy to move nearer to both Dr Paul Gachet in the Paris suburb of Auvers-sur-Oise and to Theo Gachet was an amateur painter and had treated several other artists – Camille Pissarro had recommended him Van Gogh's first impression was that Gachet was \"iller than I am, it seemed to me, or let's say just as much.\" [193]\n\n\nDeath\nOn 27 July 1890 (Sunday), aged 37, van Gogh shot himself in the chest with a revolver [203] The shooting may have taken place in the wheat field in which he had been painting, or in a local barn [204] The bullet was deflected by a rib and passed through his chest without doing apparent damage to internal organs – possibly stopped by his spine He was able to walk back to the Auberge Ravoux, where he was attended to by two doctors One of them, Dr Gachet, served as a war surgeon in 1870 and had extensive knowledge of gunshots Vincent was possibly attended to during the night by Dr Gachet's son Paul Louis Gachet and the innkeeper, Arthur Ravoux The following morning, Theo rushed to his brother's side, finding him in good spirits But within hours Vincent's health began to fail, suffering from an infection resulting from the wound He died in the early hours of Tuesday, 29 July According to Theo, Vincent's last words were: \"The sadness will last forever\" [205] [206] [207] [208]\n\n\nStyle and works\nVan Gogh drew and painted with watercolours while at school, but only a few examples survive and the authorship of some has been challenged [215] When he took up art as an adult, he began at an elementary level In early 1882, his uncle, Cornelis Marinus, owner of a well-known gallery of contemporary art in Amsterdam, asked for drawings of The Hague Van Gogh's work did not live up to expectations Marinus offered a second commission, specifying the subject matter in detail, but was again disappointed with the result Van Gogh persevered; he experimented with lighting in his studio using variable shutters and different drawing materials For more than a year he worked on single figures – highly elaborate studies in black and white, [note 11] which at the time gained him only criticism Later, they were recognised as early masterpieces [217]\n\n\nArtistic development\nVan Gogh drew and painted with watercolours while at school, but only a few examples survive and the authorship of some has been challenged [215] When he took up art as an adult, he began at an elementary level In early 1882, his uncle, Cornelis Marinus, owner of a well-known gallery of contemporary art in Amsterdam, asked for drawings of The Hague Van Gogh's work did not live up to expectations Marinus offered a second commission, specifying the subject matter in detail, but was again disappointed with the result Van Gogh persevered; he experimented with lighting in his studio using variable shutters and different drawing materials For more than a year he worked on single figures – highly elaborate studies in black and white, [note 11] which at the time gained him only criticism Later, they were recognised as early masterpieces [217]\n\n\nMajor series\nVan Gogh's stylistic developments are usually linked to the periods he spent living in different places across Europe He was inclined to immerse himself in local cultures and lighting conditions, although he maintained a highly individual visual outlook throughout His evolution as an artist was slow and he was aware of his painterly limitations Van Gogh moved home often, perhaps to expose himself to new visual stimuli, and through exposure develop his technical skill [241] Art historian Melissa McQuillan believes the moves also reflect later stylistic changes and that van Gogh used the moves to avoid conflict, and as a coping mechanism for when the idealistic artist was faced with the realities of his then current situation [242]\n\n\nPortraits\nVan Gogh said portraiture was his greatest interest \"What I'm most passionate about, much much more than all the rest in my profession\", he wrote in 1890, \"is the portrait, the modern portrait.\" [243] It is \"the only thing in painting that moves me deeply and that gives me a sense of the infinite.\" [240] [244] He wrote to his sister that he wished to paint portraits that would endure, and that he would use colour to capture their emotions and character rather than aiming for photographic realism [245] Those closest to van Gogh are mostly absent from his portraits; he rarely painted Theo, van Rappard or Bernard The portraits of his mother were from photographs [246]\n\n\nSelf-portraits\nVan Gogh created more than 43 self-portraits between 1885 and 1889 [248] [note 13] They were usually completed in series, such as those painted in Paris in mid-1887, and continued until shortly before his death [249] Generally the portraits were studies, created during periods when he was reluctant to mix with others or when he lacked models and painted himself [240] [250]\n\n\nFlowers\nVan Gogh painted several landscapes with flowers, including roses, lilacs, irises, and sunflowers Some reflect his interests in the language of colour, and also in Japanese ukiyo-e [258] There are two series of dying sunflowers The first was painted in Paris in 1887 and shows flowers lying on the ground The second set was completed a year later in Arles and is of bouquets in a vase positioned in early morning light [259] Both are built from thickly layered paintwork, which, according to the London National Gallery, evokes the \"texture of the seed-heads\" [260]\n\n\nCypresses and olives\nFifteen canvases depict cypresses, a tree he became fascinated with in Arles [264] He brought life to the trees, which were traditionally seen as emblematic of death [230] The series of cypresses he began in Arles featured the trees in the distance, as windbreaks in fields; when he was at Saint-Rémy he brought them to the foreground [265] Vincent wrote to Theo in May 1889: \"Cypresses still preoccupy me, I should like to do something with them like my canvases of sunflowers\"; he went on to say, \"They are beautiful in line and proportion like an Egyptian obelisk.\" [266]\n\n\nOrchards\nThe Flowering Orchards (also the Orchards in Blossom) are among the first groups of work completed after van Gogh's arrival in Arles in February 1888 The 14 paintings are optimistic, joyous and visually expressive of the burgeoning spring They are delicately sensitive and unpopulated He painted swiftly, and although he brought to this series a version of Impressionism, a strong sense of personal style began to emerge during this period The transience of the blossoming trees, and the passing of the season, seemed to align with his sense of impermanence and belief in a new beginning in Arles During the blossoming of the trees that spring, he found \"a world of motifs that could not have been more Japanese\" [270] Vincent wrote to Theo on 21 April 1888 that he had 10 orchards and \"one big  [painting] of a cherry tree, which I've spoiled\" [271]\n\n\nWheat fields\nVan Gogh made several painting excursions during visits to the landscape around Arles He made paintings of harvests, wheat fields and other rural landmarks of the area, including The Old Mill (1888); a good example of a picturesque structure bordering the wheat fields beyond [123] At various points, van Gogh painted the view from his window – at The Hague, Antwerp, and Paris These works culminated in The Wheat Field series, which depicted the view from his cells in the asylum at Saint-Rémy [274]\n\n\nReputation and legacy\nAfter van Gogh's first exhibitions in the late 1880s, his reputation grew steadily among artists, art critics, dealers and collectors [280] In 1887, André Antoine hung van Gogh's alongside works of Georges Seurat and Paul Signac, at the Théâtre Libre in Paris; some were acquired by Julien Tanguy [281] In 1889, his work was described in the journal Le Moderniste Illustré by Albert Aurier as characterised by \"fire, intensity, sunshine\" [282] Ten paintings were shown at the Société des Artistes Indépendants, in Brussels in January 1890 [283] French president Marie François Sadi Carnot was said to have been impressed by van Gogh's work [284]\n\n\nVan Gogh Museum\nVan Gogh's nephew and namesake, Vincent Willem van Gogh (1890–1978), [311] inherited the estate after his mother's death in 1925 During the early 1950s he arranged for the publication of a complete edition of the letters presented in four volumes and several languages He then began negotiations with the Dutch government to subsidise a foundation to purchase and house the entire collection [312] Theo's son participated in planning the project in the hope that the works would be exhibited under the best possible conditions The project began in 1963; architect Gerrit Rietveld was commissioned to design it, and after his death in 1964 Kisho Kurokawa took charge [313] Work progressed throughout the 1960s, with 1972 as the target for its grand opening [311]\n\n\nNazi-looted art\nDuring the Nazi period (1933–1945) a great number of artworks by van Gogh changed hands, many of them looted from Jewish collectors who were forced into exile or murdered Some of these works have disappeared into private collections Others have since resurfaced in museums, or at auction, or have been reclaimed, often in high-profile lawsuits, by their former owners [317] [318] The German Lost Art Foundation still lists dozens of missing van Goghs [319] and the American Alliance of Museums lists 73 van Goghs on the Nazi Era Provenance Internet Portal [320]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

She is subsequently sent to another expensive school for prodigies.\n\nEcho\n\nMaya is sent by the Kingpin to prove Matt Murdock's weakness, telling her that Matt believes Fisk is a bad person and that she is the only way to prove him wrong. As Maya believes Fisk, it would not appear to be a lie when she tells Matt.\n\n**Ronin and the Avengers**\n\nAfter a recent identity crisis and feeling unable to join the New Avengers due to a refusal to tarnish the reputations of heroes by working alongside them, Maya dons a suit that conceals her identity as well as her gender and rechristens herself Ronin (Japanese for \"wanderer\", a class of masterless samurai).\n\n**World War Hulk**\n\nEcho attempts to defend Rick Jones from Hiroim and Elloe of the Hulk's Warbound during their attack on the Sanctum Sanctorum to capture Doctor Strange.

The battle is then broken up by a dinosaur causing everyone to split up. Later, she encounters \"Spider-Woman\" who is actually the Skrull Queen and the force behind the Skrull Invasion. \"Spider-Woman\" incapacitates Echo by repeatedly blasting her with venom blasts and then slams her into a nearby tree trunk. Echo helps the other Avengers kill all the other Skrull impostors, then heads to New York and confronts an army of Super Skrulls along with various other heroes and villains. She is invited back to Captain America's apartment by Iron Fist but does not show up.\n\n**Heroic Age**\n\nFollowing the reformation of the New Avengers during the Heroic Age, Cage and Jessica Jones seek a nanny for their child; Echo is one of several respondents to the offer, but declines and then angrily asks if Cage even remembers that she used to be a member of the Avengers.\n\n**Moon Knight**\n\nEcho appears in the fourth Moon Knight series, where she worked undercover in a strip club in L.A., until she blew the cover saving Marc Spector.

Due to the vast disadvantage, Echo is soundly defeated by Namor, presumably eliminating her from the tournament and losing her portion of the Phoenix's power. However, despite her loss, Echo's despair and refusal to die draws the Phoenix to her, making her the new host of the entity. Maya declares herself as the new Thunderbird and fully bonds with the entity.

Sia has stated that she imitated the performing style of Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, and Sting, whom she has cited as early influences. She attended Adelaide High School, where she began to develop her musical talents.\n\nCareer\n\nSia started her career in the mid-1990s as a singer in the local acid jazz band Crisp. The band collaborated with Sia and contributed vocals to their album Word and the Deal (1996) and EP Delirium (1997). In 1997, Crisp disbanded, and Sia released her debut studio album, OnlySee, on Flavoured Records in Australia on December 23. The album sold about 1,200 copies and was marketed under her full name, \"Sia Furler.\" Unlike her later albums, OnlySee was produced by Jesse Flavell.\n\n1997–2006: Zero 7, Healing Is Difficult, and Colour the Small One\n\nAfter Crisp disbanded in 1997, Sia moved to London, where she performed as a background vocalist for British band Jamiroquai. She also provided vocals for English downtempo group Zero 7 on their first three studio albums and toured with the group. On Zero 7's 2001 album Simple Things, Sia contributed vocals to two tracks, including the single \"Destiny,\" which peaked at No 30 on the UK Singles Chart. In 2004, she provided vocals for Zero 7 on \"Somersault\" and \"Speed Dial No 2\" (from the album When It Falls). In 2006, Sia collaborated with Zero 7 for their third album, The Garden.\n\n2007–2010: Some People Have Real Problems and We Are Born\n\nIn 2007, Sia released a live album, Lady Croissant, which included eight live songs from her April 2006 performance at the Bowery Ballroom in New York and one new studio recording, \"Pictures.\" A year later, she left Zero 7 on friendly terms, replaced by Eska Mtungwazi as the band's frontwoman. Sia released her fourth studio album, Some People Have Real Problems, on January 8, 2008. The album peaked at No 41 in Australia and was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association. It charted at No 26 on the US Billboard 200, becoming Sia's first to chart in the United States. Some People Have Real Problems yielded four singles, including \"The Girl You Lost to Cocaine.\" It peaked at No 11 in the Netherlands and No 12 in Spain.\n\n2010–2013: Songwriting Career and Mainstream Recognition\n\nFollowing the success of We Are Born, Sia became uncomfortable with her growing fame. She later told The New York Times, \"I just wanted to have a private life. Once, as my friend was telling me they had cancer, someone came up and asked, in the middle of the conversation, if they could take a photograph with me. You get me? That's enough, right?\" Sia refused to do promos for her tours, began to wear a mask on stage, and became increasingly dependent on drugs and alcohol on the road; she considered suicide. Sia fired Enthoven and hired Jonathan Daniel, who suggested that she write songs for other artists.\n\n2013–2014: Breakthrough with 1000 Forms of Fear\n\nIn October 2013, Sia released \"Elastic Heart\" featuring the Weeknd and Diplo for the soundtrack of the American film The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013). Sia executive-produced Brooke Candy's debut EP, Opulence, released in May 2014, and co-wrote 3 songs on the EP. In July 2014, Sia released her own sixth studio album, 1000 Forms of Fear. She again collaborated with Greg Kurstin. The album debuted at No 1 in the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 52,000 copies. By October 2015, it was certified gold by the RIAA denoting 500,000 equivalent-album units sold in the United States.\n\n2015–2017: This Is Acting\n\nIn an interview with NME in February 2015, Sia revealed that she had completed the follow-up to 1000 Forms of Fear, entitled This Is Acting. The album was another collaboration with producer and co-writer Greg Kurstin. Furler said that she released 1000 Forms of Fear to free herself from her record deal and had planned simply to write for other artists, but the album's success spurred her to continue writing her own music. The same month, alongside the digital deluxe release of 1000 Forms of Fear, she released a mobile game, Bob Job. \"Alive\" from This Is Acting was co-written by Adele and had originally been intended for her third album, 25.\n\n2017–present: Everyday Is Christmas, LSD, Music, and Reasonable Woman\n\nIn 2017, Sia moved from RCA to Atlantic Records. She released the album Everyday Is Christmas on Atlantic and Monkey Puzzle in November 2017. The album features original songs co-written and co-produced with Kurstin. She promoted it by releasing the singles \"Santa's Coming for Us\" and \"Snowman.\" \"Snowman\" has also since become a modern-day Christmas classic, and is one of the most-streamed Christmas songs of all time.\n\nArtistry and Musical Style\n\nAt the start of her career, with the band Crisp, Sia performed acid jazz in Australia and later in London. With her first solo single, \"Taken for Granted,\" she experimented with trip hop. When she joined Zero 7, she sang downtempo numbers.\n\nAccolades and Recognition\n\nSia has received an array of accolades, including ARIA Awards, an MTV Video Music Award, and nine nominations for Grammy Awards.\n\nOther Ventures\n\nIn the 2014 South Park episode \"The Cissy,\" Sia provided the vocals for the fictional Lorde track \"Push (Feeling Good on a Wednesday).\" In 2016 Sia covered \"Blackbird\" by The Beatles for the Netflix original series Beat Bugs. She appeared in the 2017 animated film My Little Pony: The Movie as the voice of pop star Songbird Serenade. She also contributed an original song, \"Rainbow,\" to the film's soundtrack.\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nSia has been noted for her philanthropic gestures over the years. Prior to Thanksgiving in 2019, at a Palm Springs, California, Walmart and TJ Maxx, Sia paid for peoples' groceries and shopping in disguise. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Sia pledged to donate $1 million to CORE Response. She also donated the proceeds from her single \"Saved My Life\" to CORE Response's and AmeriCares' relief efforts. The same year she donated $100,000 to Australians in need in collaboration with Nova FM DJs Fitzy & Wippa and another $100,000 to community bail funds in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nAnimal Activism\n\nSia is a vegetarian and an \"animal lover.\" She has been an advocate for animals throughout her career. In 2010, she participated in a PETA campaign to tackle animal overpopulation and encourage people to spay or neuter their pets. She performed her song \"I'm in Here\" at the Beagle Freedom Project Gala in 2013, and, in 2015, \"Free the Animal\" was used for PETA public service announcements supporting cruelty-free fashion. During her Nostalgic for the Present Tour in 2016, Sia partnered with various animal rescue organisations to set up dog adoption fairs at each of the shows. In 2017, she released another public service announcement, in collaboration with the ASPCA, using her song \"Puppies Are Forever,\" to encourage pet adoption.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nFollowing the disbandment of Crisp in 1997, Sia moved to London to follow her relationship with boyfriend Dan Pontifex. Several weeks later, while on a stopover in Thailand, she received the news that Pontifex had died after being in a car accident in London. She returned to Australia, but received a call from one of Pontifex's former housemates, who invited her to stay in London. Her 2001 album Healing Is Difficult lyrically deals with Pontifex's death: \"I was pretty fucked up after Dan died I couldn't really feel anything.\" Sia recalled the effect of his death in a 2007 interview for The Sunday Times: \"We were all devastated, so we got shit-faced on drugs and Special Brew. Unfortunately, that bender lasted six years for me.\"\n\nRelationships and Family\n\nFollowing the disbandment of Crisp in 1997, Sia moved to London to follow her relationship with boyfriend Dan Pontifex.

Unfortunately, that bender lasted six years for me.\"\n\nSexuality\n\nIn 2008, Sia discussed her sexual orientation in interviews and revealed her relationship with JD Samson; they broke up in 2011. When asked about her sexuality in 2009, she said, \"I've always dated boys and girls and anything in between I don't care what gender you are, it's about people .. I've always been.. well, flexible is the word I would use.\" Sia identified as queer on Twitter in 2013.\n\nHealth\n\nSia has experienced depression and addictions to painkillers and alcohol. In 2010, she wrote a suicide note, planning to overdose; a friend phoned her and, unintentionally, saved her life. Following this, Sia joined Alcoholics Anonymous. Sia cancelled various promotional events and shows due to her poor health in 2010. She cited extreme lethargy and panic attacks, and she considered retiring permanently from performing and touring. She stated that she had been diagnosed with Graves' disease. Later that year, Sia said her health was improving after rest and thyroid suppression therapy.\n\nDiscography\n\nSia wrote and/or performed songs on the following film soundtracks:\n\n* The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013)\n* The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1 (2014)\n* The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 (2015)\n* My Little Pony: The Movie (2017)\n* Vox Lux (2018)\n\nTours\n\nSia wrote and/or performed songs on the following tours:\n\n* Nostalgic for the Present Tour (2017-2018)\n* The Greatest Showman – Illuminate World Tour (2018)\n\nFilmography\n\nSia wrote and/or performed songs on the following films:\n\n* The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013)\n* My Little Pony: The Movie (2017)\n* Vox Lux (2018)\n\nFilm Roles\n\nSia played the role of Songbird Serenade in the 2017 animated film My Little Pony: The Movie.\n\nTelevision Roles\n\nSia appeared on the following TV shows:\n\n* T in the Park (2010)\n* The Graham Norton Show (2014)\n* The Late Late Show with James Corden (2015)\n* Saturday Night Live (2016)\n* The Ellen DeGeneres Show (2016)\n* The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon (2017)\n\nSee also\n\n* List of awards and nominations received by Sia\n* List of songs recorded by Sia", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Sia_(musician)\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nSia Kate Isobelle Furler was born on 18 December 1975 [3] in Adelaide, South Australia [4] Her father, Phil Colson, is a musician, and her mother, Loene Furler, is an art lecturer [5] She is the niece of actor Kevin Colson [6] Sia has stated that as a child she imitated the performing style of Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder and Sting, whom she has cited as early influences [7] She attended Adelaide High School [5]\n\n\nCareer\nIn the mid-1990s, Sia started a career as a singer in the local acid jazz band Crisp [5] Sia collaborated with the band and contributed vocals to their album Word and the Deal (1996) and EP Delirium (1997) [8]\nIn 1997 Crisp disbanded, [4] and Sia released her debut studio album, OnlySee, on Flavoured Records, in Australia, on 23 December [9] The album sold about 1,200 copies [10] Unlike her later albums, OnlySee was marketed under her full name, \"Sia Furler\" It was produced by Jesse Flavell [11]\n\n\n1997–2006: Zero 7, Healing Is Difficult and Colour the Small One\nAfter Crisp disbanded in 1997, Sia moved to London, [4] where she performed as a background vocalist for British band Jamiroquai [1] She also provided vocals for English downtempo group Zero 7 on their first three studio albums and toured with the group [12] On Zero 7's 2001 album Simple Things, Sia contributed vocals to two tracks [13] including the single \"Destiny\", which peaked at No 30 on the UK Singles Chart [14] In 2004, she provided vocals for Zero 7 on \"Somersault\" and \"Speed Dial No 2\" (from the album When It Falls) [15] In 2006, Sia collaborated with Zero 7 for their third album, The Garden [16] [17]\n\n\n2007–2010: Some People Have Real Problems and We Are Born\nIn 2007, Sia released a live album, Lady Croissant, which included eight live songs from her April 2006 performance at the Bowery Ballroom in New York and one new studio recording—\"Pictures\" [24] A year later, she left Zero 7 on friendly terms, replaced by Eska Mtungwazi as the band's frontwoman [17] Sia released her fourth studio album, Some People Have Real Problems on 8 January 2008 The album peaked at No 41 in Australia and was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association [25]\nIt charted at No 26 on the US Billboard 200, becoming Sia's first to chart in the United States [26] Some People Have Real Problems yielded four singles, including \"The Girl You Lost to Cocaine\" [27] It peaked at No 11 in the Netherlands and No 12 in Spain; [28] it additionally reached No 8 on the US Hot Dance Club Songs [29] Another single from the album was \"Soon We'll Be Found\" [30]\n\n\n2010–2013: Songwriting career and mainstream recognition\nFollowing the success of We Are Born, Sia became uncomfortable with her growing fame She later told The New York Times: \"I just wanted to have a private life Once, as my friend was telling me they had cancer, someone came up and asked, in the middle of the conversation, if they could take a photograph with me You get me?

[w]e share common experiences and have a perspective and underpinning which is similar.\" [55] Netanyahu said that their \"easy communication\" was a result of \"B.C.G.'s intellectually rigorous boot

security Hamas claimed responsibility for most of the bombings As prime minister, Netanyahu raised many questions about many central premises of the Oslo Accords One of his main points was disagreement with the Oslo premise that the negotiations should proceed in stages, meaning that concessions should be made to Palestinians before any resolution was reached on major issues, such as the status of Jerusalem, and the amending of the Palestinian National Charter Oslo supporters had claimed that the multi-stage approach would build goodwill among Palestinians and would propel them to seek reconciliation when these major issues were raised in later stages Netanyahu said that these concessions only gave encouragement to extremist elements, without receiving any tangible gestures in return He called for tangible gestures of Palestinian goodwill in return for Israeli concessions Despite his stated differences with the Oslo Accords, Prime Minister Netanyahu continued their implementation, but his Premiership saw a marked slow-down in the peace process [citation needed]\n\n\nFirst term\nA spate of suicide bombings reinforced the Likud position for security Hamas claimed

It's always been about competition That's what human progress is about You want to siphon it into productive ways.\n\n\nViews on counter-terrorism\nThe essence of democratic societies, and that which distinguishes them from dictatorships, is the commitment to resolve conflict in a nonviolent fashion by settling issues through argument and debate .. The salient point that has to be underlined again and again is that nothing justifies terrorism, that it is evil per se – that the various real or imagined reasons proffered by the terrorists to justify their actions are meaningless.\n\n\nDeath penalty\nIn 2017, Netanyahu called for the death penalty to be imposed on the perpetrator of the 2017 Halamish stabbing attack [379] Representatives in his government introduced a bill which would allow the death penalty for terrorism to the Knesset [380] [381] In a preliminary vote in January 2018, 52 of 120 members of the Israeli parliament voted in favor while 49 opposed, to make it easier for judges to hand down the death penalty The amendment to the penal code would still require three more readings if it is to become law [382]\n\n\nLGBT rights\nNetanyahu supports equal rights for LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) persons He said: \"The struggle for every person to be recognized as equal before the law is a long struggle, and there is still a long way to go ..

What are we getting for this?\" [119]\n\n\nPrime minister (2009–2021)\nIn 2009, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton voiced support for the establishment of a Palestinian state – a solution not endorsed by prime minister-designate Benjamin Netanyahu, [124] with whom she had earlier pledged the United States' cooperation [125] Upon the arrival of President Obama administration's special envoy, George Mitchell, Netanyahu said that any furtherance of negotiations with the Palestinians would be conditioned on the Palestinians recognizing Israel as a Jewish state [126]\n\n\nSecond term\nIn 2009, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton voiced support for the establishment of a Palestinian state – a solution not endorsed by prime minister-designate Benjamin Netanyahu, [124] with whom she had earlier pledged the United States' cooperation [125] Upon the arrival of President Obama administration's special envoy, George Mitchell, Netanyahu said that any furtherance of negotiations with the Palestinians would be conditioned on the Palestinians recognizing Israel as a Jewish state [126]\n\n\nThird term\nThe 2013 election returned Netanyahu's Likud Beiteinu coalition with 11 fewer seats than the combined Likud and Yisrael Beiteinu parties had going into the vote Nevertheless, as leader of what remained the largest faction in the Knesset, Israeli president Shimon Peres charged Netanyahu with the task of forming the Thirty-third government of Israel The new coalition included the Yesh Atid, The Jewish Home and Hatnuah parties and excludes the ultra-Orthodox parties at the insistence of Yesh Atid and the Jewish Home.\n\n\nFourth term\nIn the 2015 election, Netanyahu returned with his party Likud leading the elections with 30 mandates, making it the single highest number of seats for the Knesset President Rivlin granted Netanyahu an extension until 6 May 2015 to build a coalition when one had not been finalized in the first four weeks of negotiations [207] He formed a coalition government within two hours of the midnight 6 May deadline [208] His Likud party formed the coalition with Jewish Home, United Torah Judaism, Kulanu, and Shas [208] [209]\n\n\nCriminal investigations and indictment\nSince January 2017, Netanyahu has been investigated and questioned by Israeli police in two cases, \"Case 1000\" and \"Case 2000\" The two cases are connected In Case 1000, Netanyahu is suspected of having obtained inappropriate favors from businessmen, including James Packer and Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan [246] [247] Case 2000 involves alleged attempts to strike a deal with the publisher of the Yedioth Ahronot newspaper group, Arnon Mozes, to promote legislation to weaken Yedioth's main competitor, Israel Hayom, in exchange for more favorable coverage of Netanyahu.\n\n\nFifth term\nOn 17 May 2020, Netanyahu was sworn in for a fifth term as prime minister in a coalition with Benny Gantz Against a background of the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel and Netanyahu's criminal trial, extensive demonstrations broke out against him in front of the prime minister's residence Following this, Netanyahu ordered to disperse the demonstrations using COVID-19 special regulations, limiting them to 20 people and at a distance of 1,000 meters from their homes [261] However, the exact opposite was achieved; the demonstrations were enlarged and dispersed to over 1,000 centers [262] By March 2021, Israel became the country with the highest vaccinated population per capita in the world against COVID-19 [263]\n\n\nLeader of the Opposition (2021–2022)\nAfter the end of his second premiership, Netanyahu began his third stint as the leader of the opposition Likud remained the largest party in the twenty-fourth Knesset [267]\nHe led the opposition into the 2022 Israeli legislative election.\n\n\nPrime minister (2022–present)\nAfter the 2022 election, Netanyahu was sworn in as prime minister again as the leader of a hardline coalition [268] He officially started his sixth term on 29 December 2022 [269]\n\n\nSixth term\nAfter the 2022 election, Netanyahu was sworn in as prime minister again as the leader of a hardline coalition [268] He officially started his sixth term on 29 December 2022 [269]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nDefunct\n\n\nIsraeli–Palestinian conflict\nNetanyahu opposed the Oslo Accords from their inception In 1993, he dedicated a chapter, entitled \"Trojan Horse\", of his book A Place Among the Nations to argue against the Oslo peace process He asserted that Amin al-Husseini had been one of the masterminds of the Holocaust, and that Yasser Arafat was heir to the former's \"alleged exterminationist Nazism\" [315] During his term as prime minister in the late 1990s, Netanyahu consistently reneged on commitments made by previous Israeli governments as part of the Oslo peace process, leading American peace envoy Dennis Ross to note that \"neither President Clinton nor Secretary  [of State Madeleine] Albright believed that Bibi had any real interest in pursuing peace.\" [316] In a 2001 video, Netanyahu, reportedly unaware he was being recorded, said:\n\n\nBar-Ilan speech\nIn June 2009, Netanyahu delivered an address [351] at Bar-Ilan University, known as the \"Bar-Ilan speech\", at Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies, that was broadcast live in Israel and across parts of the Arab world, on the Israeli–Palestinian peace process He endorsed for the first time the notion of a Palestinian state alongside Israel [352] Netanyahu's speech could be viewed in part as a response to Obama's 4 June speech at Cairo Yedioth Ahronoth claimed Obama's words had \"resonated through Jerusalem's corridors\" [353]\n\n\nEconomic views\nYou want to have a meritocracy You want to have initiative, risk, talent, the ability to create new products, new services to be rewarded .. It's always been about competition That's what human progress is about You want to siphon it into productive ways.\n\n\nViews on counter-terrorism\nThe essence of democratic societies, and that which distinguishes them from dictatorships, is the commitment to resolve conflict in a nonviolent fashion by settling issues through argument and debate .. The salient point that has to be underlined again and again is that nothing justifies terrorism, that it is evil per se – that the various real or imagined reasons proffered by the terrorists to justify their actions are meaningless.\n\n\nDeath penalty\nIn 2017, Netanyahu called for the death penalty to be imposed on the perpetrator of the 2017 Halamish stabbing attack [379] Representatives in his government introduced a bill which would allow the death penalty for terrorism to the Knesset [380] [381] In a preliminary vote in January 2018, 52 of 120 members of the Israeli parliament voted in favor while 49 opposed, to make it easier for judges to hand down the death penalty The amendment to the penal code would still require three more readings if it is to become law [382]\n\n\nLGBT rights\nNetanyahu supports equal rights for LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) persons He said: \"The struggle for every person to be recognized as equal before the law is a long struggle, and there is still a long way to go .. I am proud that Israel is among the most open countries in the world in relation to the LGBT community discourse.\" [383] [384] During an event held for the annual community rights day at the Knesset, Netanyahu said that he was \"asked to come here in the middle of my busy schedule to say one thing to the male and female members of the LGBT community: We must be guided by the conviction that every person is created in the image of God.\" [385] However, some of his coalition government's party members opposed same-sex marriage [386]\n\n\nEthiopian Jewish integration\nIn 2015, after Ethiopian Jewish protests against police brutality, Netanyahu said: \"We will bring a comprehensive plan to the government to assist you in every way There is no room for racism and discrimination in our society, none .. We will turn racism into something contemptible and despicable.\" [387]\n\n\nAfrican Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem\nNetanyahu supports the integration of the African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem into Israeli society, and takes part in celebrations in honor of this community's \"exodus\" from America to Israel, which occurred in 1967 In 2012, Netanyahu expressed appreciation towards \"the cooperative society that is working towards the inclusion of the Hebrew Israelite community in Israeli society at large,\" and declared that the experience of the community in the land of Israel is \"an integral part of the Israeli experience.\" [388]\n\n\nIran\nIn an 8 March 2007 interview with CNN, opposition leader Netanyahu claimed that \"there is only one difference between Nazi Germany and the Islamic Republic of Iran, namely that the first entered a worldwide conflict and then sought atomic weapons, while the latter is first seeking atomic weapons and, once it has them, will then start a world war.\" Netanyahu repeated these remarks at a news conference in April 2008 [389] This was similar to earlier remarks that \"it's 1938, and Iran is Germany, and Iran is racing to arm itself with atomic bombs\" [390]\n\n\nBank of China terror financing case\nIn 2013, Netanyahu found himself caught between conflicting commitments made to the family of American terror victim Daniel Wultz and the Government of China Although Netanyahu was reported to have previously promised U.S Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen that Israel would fully cooperate in the terror-financing case against Bank of China in U.S District Court, the prime minister reportedly made a conflicting promise to the Government of China prior to a state visit to China in May 2013 [411] Attorney David Boies, lead counsel for the Wultz family, told The Wall Street Journal, \"While we are respectful of China's interests, and of the diplomatic pressure to which Israel has been subjected, those interests and that pressure cannot be permitted to obstruct the ability of American courts to hear critical evidence.\" [412] [413]\n\n\nDefense and security\nIn 2011, Netanyahu arranged for 1000 Hamas and Fatah prisoners to be swapped for Gilad Shalit, including terrorists with \"blood on their hands\" [415] Israeli officials estimate that 60% of those who are released \"resume terrorism attacks\" [416]\n\n\nIllegal immigration\nIn his 1995 book Fighting Terrorism: How Democracies Can Defeat Domestic and International Terrorism, Netanyahu strongly argued that tightening immigration laws in the West is the most effective method to combat terrorism \"This era of immigration free-for-all should be brought to an end\", he wrote in 1995 [377]\n\n\nRelations with foreign leaders\nNetanyahu has a close relationship with Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán, their having known each other for decades due to the privileged relationship between the Likud Party and the EPP, the European People's Party Orban particularly admired Netanyahu while he was working as finance minister, and received advice from him while Netanyahu was Finance Minister of Israel [432]\n\n\nUS leaders\nNetanyahu has close ties with the congressional leadership of the U.S Republican Party and with its 2012 presidential candidate, Mitt Romney He and Romney first became acquainted when both worked at the Boston Consulting Group in the mid-1970s [460]\n\n\nPersonal life\nNetanyahu was born in Tel Aviv, [480] to Benzion Netanyahu (original name Mileikowsky) and Tzila (Cela; née Segal) His mother was born in 1912 in Petah Tikva, then in Ottoman Palestine, now Israel Though all his grandparents were born in the Russian Empire (now Belarus, Lithuania and Poland), his mother's parents emigrated to Minneapolis in the United States [481] He is related to Rabbi Eliyahu of Vilna (the Vilna Gaon) on his paternal side [482]\n\n\nFamily tree\nNetanyahu was born in Tel Aviv, [480] to Benzion Netanyahu (original name Mileikowsky) and Tzila (Cela;

{"title": "Java_(programming_language)", "content": "\nHistory\nJames Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991 [21] Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time [22] The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee, a type of coffee from Indonesia [23] Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar [24]\n\n\nPrinciples\nThere were five primary goals in creating the Java language: [17]\n\n\nVersions\nAs of November 2024 [update], Java 8, 11, 17, and 21 are supported as long-term support (LTS) versions, with Java 25, releasing in September 2025, as the next scheduled LTS version [38]\n\n\nEditions\nSun has defined and supports four editions of Java targeting different application environments and segmented many of its APIs so that they belong to one of the platforms The platforms are:\n\n\nExecution system\nOne design goal of Java is portability, which means that programs written for the Java platform must run similarly on any combination of hardware and operating system with adequate run time support This is achieved by compiling the Java language code to an intermediate representation called Java bytecode, instead of directly to architecture-specific machine code Java bytecode instructions are analogous to machine code, but they are intended to be executed by a virtual machine (VM) written specifically for the host hardware End-users commonly use a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on their device for standalone Java applications or a web browser for Java applets.\n\n\nJava JVM and bytecode\nOne design goal of Java is portability, which means that programs written for the Java platform must run similarly on any combination of hardware and operating system with adequate run time support This is achieved by compiling the Java language code to an intermediate representation called Java bytecode, instead of directly to architecture-specific machine code Java bytecode instructions are analogous to machine code, but they are intended to be executed by a virtual machine (VM) written specifically for the host hardware End-users commonly use a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on their device for standalone Java applications or a web browser for Java applets.\n\n\nPerformance\nPrograms written in Java have a reputation for being slower and requiring more memory than those written in C++ [50] [51] However, Java programs' execution speed improved significantly with the introduction of just-in-time compilation in 1997/1998 for Java 1.1, [52] the addition of language features supporting better code analysis (such as inner classes, the StringBuilder class, optional assertions, etc.), and optimizations in the Java virtual machine, such as HotSpot becoming Sun's default JVM in 2000 With Java 1.5, the performance was improved with the addition of the java.util.concurrent package, including lock-free implementations of the ConcurrentMaps and other multi-core collections, and it was improved further with Java 1.6.\n\n\nNon-JVM\nSome platforms offer direct hardware support for Java; there are micro controllers that can run Java bytecode in hardware instead of a software Java virtual machine, [53] and some ARM-based processors could have hardware support for executing Java bytecode through their Jazelle option, though support has mostly been dropped in current implementations of ARM.\n\n\nAutomatic memory management\nJava uses an automatic garbage collector to manage memory in the object lifecycle The programmer determines when objects are created, and the Java runtime is responsible for recovering the memory once objects are no longer in use Once no references to an object remain, the unreachable memory becomes eligible to be freed automatically by the garbage collector Something similar to a memory leak may still occur if a programmer's code holds a reference to an object that is no longer needed, typically when objects that are no longer needed are stored in containers that are still in use [54] If methods for a non-existent object are called, a null pointer exception is thrown [55] [56]\n\n\nSyntax\nThe syntax of Java is largely influenced by C++ and C Unlike C++, which combines the syntax for structured, generic, and object-oriented programming, Java was built almost exclusively as an object-oriented language [17] All code is written inside classes, and every data item is an object, with the exception of the primitive data types, (i.e integers, floating-point numbers, boolean values, and characters), which are not objects for performance reasons Java reuses some popular aspects of C++ (such as the printf method).\n\n\nHello world\nThe following is a simple example of a \"Hello, World!\" program that writes a message to the standard output:\n\n\nSpecial classes\nJava applets are programs embedded in other applications, mainly in web pages displayed in web browsers The Java applet API was deprecated with the release of Java 9 in 2017 [60] [61]\n\n\nApplet\nJava applets are programs embedded in other applications, mainly in web pages displayed in web browsers The Java applet API was deprecated with the release of Java 9 in 2017 [60] [61]\n\n\nServlet\nJava servlet technology provides Web developers with a simple, consistent mechanism for extending the functionality of a Web server and for accessing existing business systems Servlets are server-side Java EE components that generate responses to requests from clients Most of the time, this means generating HTML pages in response to HTTP requests, although there are a number of other standard servlet classes available, for example for WebSocket communication.\n\n\nJavaServer Pages\nJavaServer Pages (JSP) are server-side Java EE components that generate responses, typically HTML pages, to HTTP requests from clients JSPs embed Java code in an HTML page by using the special delimiters <% and %> A JSP is compiled to a Java servlet, a Java application in its own right, the first time it is accessed After that, the generated servlet creates the response [62]\n\n\nSwing application\nSwing is a graphical user interface library for the Java SE platform It is possible to specify a different look and feel through the pluggable look and feel system of Swing Clones of Windows, GTK+, and Motif are supplied by Sun Apple also provides an Aqua look and feel for macOS Where prior implementations of these looks and feels may have been considered lacking, Swing in Java SE 6 addresses this problem by using more native GUI widget drawing routines of the underlying platforms [63]\n\n\nJavaFX application\nJavaFX is a software platform for creating and delivering desktop applications, as well as rich web applications that can run across a wide variety of devices JavaFX is intended to replace Swing as the standard GUI library for Java SE, but since JDK 11 JavaFX has not been in the core JDK and instead in a separate module [64] JavaFX has support for desktop computers and web browsers on Microsoft Windows, Linux, and macOS JavaFX does not have support for native OS look and feels [65]\n\n\nGenerics\nIn 2004, generics were added to the Java language, as part of J2SE 5.0 Prior to the introduction of generics, each variable declaration had to be of a specific type For container classes, for example, this is a problem because there is no easy way to create a container that accepts only specific types of objects Either the container operates on all subtypes of a class or interface, usually Object, or a different container class has to be created for each contained class Generics allow compile-time type checking without having to create many container classes, each containing almost identical code In addition to enabling more efficient code, certain runtime exceptions are prevented from occurring, by issuing compile-time errors If Java prevented all runtime type errors (ClassCastExceptions) from occurring, it would be type safe.\n\n\nCriticism\nCriticisms directed at Java include the implementation of generics, [67] speed, [50] the handling of unsigned numbers, [68] the implementation of floating-point arithmetic, [69] and a history of security vulnerabilities in the primary Java VM implementation HotSpot [70]\nDevelopers have criticized the complexity and verbosity of the Java Persistence API (JPA), a standard part of Java EE This has led to increased adoption of higher-level abstractions like Spring Data JPA, which aims to simplify database operations and reduce boilerplate code The growing popularity of such frameworks suggests limitations in the standard JPA implementation's ease-of-use for modern Java development [71]\n\n\nClass libraries\nThe Java Class Library is the standard library, developed to support application development in Java It is controlled by Oracle in cooperation with others through the Java Community Process program [72] Companies or individuals participating in this process can influence the design and development of the APIs This process has been a subject of controversy during the 2010s [73] The class library contains features such as:\n\n\nDocumentation\nJavadoc is a comprehensive documentation system, created by Sun Microsystems It provides developers with an organized system for documenting their code Javadoc comments have an extra asterisk at the beginning, i.e the delimiters are /** and */, whereas the normal multi-line comments in Java are delimited by /* and */, and single-line comments start with // [81]\n\n\nImplementations\nOracle Corporation owns the official implementation of the Java SE platform, due to its acquisition of Sun Microsystems on January 27, 2010 This implementation is based on the original implementation of Java by Sun The Oracle implementation is available for Windows, macOS, Linux, and Solaris Because Java lacks any formal standardization recognized by Ecma International, ISO/IEC, ANSI, or other third-party standards organizations, the Oracle implementation is the de facto standard.\n\n\nUse outside the Java platform\nThe Java programming language requires the presence of a software platform in order for compiled programs to be executed.\n\n\nAndroid\nThe Java language is a key pillar in Android, an open source mobile operating system Although Android, built on the Linux kernel, is written largely in C, the Android SDK uses the Java language as the basis for Android applications but does not use any of its standard GUI, SE, ME or other established Java standards [83] The bytecode language supported by the Android SDK is incompatible with Java bytecode and runs on its own virtual machine, optimized for low-memory devices such as smartphones and tablet computers Depending on the Android version, the bytecode is either interpreted by the Dalvik virtual machine or compiled into native code by the Android Runtime.\n\n\nControversy\nThe use of Java-related technology in Android led to a legal dispute between Oracle and Google On May 7, 2012, a San Francisco jury found that if APIs could be copyrighted, then Google had infringed Oracle's copyrights by the use of Java in Android devices [84] District Judge William Alsup ruled on May 31, 2012, that APIs cannot be copyrighted, [85] but this was reversed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in May 2014 [86] On May 26, 2016, the district court decided in favor of Google, ruling the copyright infringement of the Java API in Android constitutes fair use [87] In March 2018, this ruling was overturned by the Appeals Court, which sent down the case of determining the damages to federal court in San Francisco [88]\nGoogle filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court of the United States in January 2019 to challenge the two rulings that were made by the Appeals Court in Oracle's favor [89] On April 5, 2021, the Court ruled 6–2 in Google's favor, that its use of Java APIs should be considered fair use However, the court refused to rule on the copyrightability of APIs, choosing instead to determine their ruling by considering Java's API copyrightable \"purely for argument's sake.\" [90]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en",

programs to be executed.\n\n\nAndroid\nThe Java language is a key pillar in Android, an open source mobile operating system Although Android, built on the Linux kernel, is written largely in C, the Android SDK uses the Java language as the basis for Android applications but does not use any of its standard GUI, SE, ME or other established Java standards [83] The bytecode language supported by the Android SDK is incompatible with Java bytecode and runs on its own virtual machine, optimized for low-memory devices such as smartphones and tablet computers Depending on the Android version, the bytecode is either interpreted by the Dalvik virtual machine or compiled into native code by the Android Runtime.\n\n\nControversy\nThe use of Java-related technology in Android led to a legal dispute between Oracle and Google On May 7, 2012, a San Francisco jury found that if APIs could be copyrighted, then Google had infringed Oracle's copyrights by the use of Java in Android devices [84] District Judge William Alsup ruled on May 31, 2012, that APIs cannot be copyrighted, [85] but this was reversed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in May 2014 [86] On May 26, 2016, the district court decided in favor of Google, ruling the copyright infringement of the Java API in Android constitutes fair use [87] In March 2018, this ruling was overturned by the Appeals Court, which sent down the case of determining the damages to federal court in San Francisco [88]\nGoogle filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court of the United States in January 2019 to challenge the two rulings that were made by the Appeals Court in Oracle's favor [89] On April 5, 2021, the Court ruled 6–2 in Google's favor, that its use of Java APIs should be considered fair use However, the court refused to rule on the copyrightability of APIs, choosing instead to determine their ruling by considering Java's API copyrightable \"purely for argument's sake.\"

[19] Members of the Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI) and the Indonesian Police (Polri) are not allowed to vote [20] Around 33 percent of voters were Millennials, and 23 percent were part of Generation Z [21]\n\n\nContesting parties\nTo participate in the election, political parties had to have branches in every province in Indonesia, 75% of regencies or cities in those provinces, and 50% of districts in regencies where the party have branches [27] In April 2022, the Ministry of Law and Human Rights declared the names of 75 national political parties eligible to register for the 2024 elections [28] [29] In the end, a total of 24 political parties registered with the KPU to run in the election nationally [30] On 14 December 2022, the KPU announced that 17 parties would be eligible to contest the legislative election.\n\n\nPresidential election\nIn July 2017, the House of Representatives passed a law that only parties or coalitions with at least 20% of seats in the legislature

at least 30 percent of running candidates, rounded to the closest whole number, be women This was changed from the regulations in effect in the 2019 election, where the 30 percent figure would be rounded up, and thus less women candidates overall would be required [70]\n\n\nNominees\n\n\n\nWithdrawn support\nThe National Awakening Party had previously declared support for Prabowo Subianto but later rescinded their support and declared support for Anies Baswedan with the National Awakening Party's Chairman, Muhaimin Iskandar, being selected as Anies Baswedan's running mate [43]

previously elected as regional leaders to run as presidential or vice-presidential candidates This allowed 36-year-old Gibran Rakabuming, son of incumbent president Jokowi and mayor of Surakarta, to run for the vice-presidency The ruling was controversial as the court chief justice, Anwar Usman, is Gibran's uncle [49] [50] [51] Anwar Usman was ultimately demoted by the Majelis Kehormatan Mahkamah Konstitusi or the Honorary Council of the Constitutional Court from the position of Chief Justice on 8 November after finding him guilty of conflict of interest on the ruling [52] Furthermore, the KPU was found to have committed ethics violations surrounding Gibran's vice presidential registration for allowing him to register his candidacy before the commission had adjusted the age minimum for candidates in its internal regulation [53] A lawsuit was filed by the Indonesian Democracy Defenders (TPDI) and the Indonesian Advocates Movement (Perekat Nusantara) against Joko Widodo, Gibran Rakabuming, Anwar Usman and First Lady Iriana alleging nepotism and political dynasty on the part of the respondents, but was dismissed by the Jakarta State Administrative Court a day before the election [54]\n\n\nDebates\nFive concurrent televised presidential and vice presidential debates were held between 12 December 2023 and 4 February 2024 During the debate on 21 January, Gibran

Kompas' exit polls found strong support for Prabowo's candidacy from non-Muslim voters and Nahdlatul Ulama Muslims, winning in 36 of 38 provinces (except for Aceh and West Sumatra, where the Anies-Muhaimin pair received the most votes). Anies-Muhaimin and Ganjar-Mahfud were also defeated in East Java and Central Java, respectively, even though their supporting parties (PKB and PDI-P, respectively) won the most votes in the two provinces. Prabowo also won the most votes in Bali, a traditional PDI-P stronghold, a victory attributed by analysts and Prabowo's campaign team to Jokowi's endorsement.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nOutgoing president Joko Widodo stated that he had met and congratulated Prabowo and his own son, Gibran, on the evening of 14 February, based on quick count results.

outline:\n\n\nElectoral system\nThe election was held in accordance with the Law No 7 of 2017 The General Elections Commission (KPU), an independent statutory body was responsible for organizing the election.\n\n\nPresidential\nIn order to run as a presidential candidate, a candidate had to be formally endorsed by a political party or a coalition thereof holding a minimum of 20 percent of seats in the DPR or having won at least 25 percent of the popular vote in the previous election, i.e in the 2019 election [8]\n\n\nLegislative\nMembers of both the House of Representatives (DPR) and the Regional House of Representatives (DPRD) were elected from multi-member electoral districts through voting with an open list system, and seat distribution is done with the Sainte-Laguë method There was a gender quota requiring at least 30% of registered candidates to be female [11]\n\n\nVoters\nThe voting age is 17, or less if the voter has an Indonesian biometric identity card or e-KTP through marriage [17] [18] However, since the age of marriage was amended to age 19 in 2019, there are no longer any married people under the age of 17 [19] Members of the Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI) and the Indonesian Police (Polri) are not allowed to vote [20] Around 33 percent of voters were Millennials, and 23 percent were part of Generation Z [21]\n\n\nContesting parties\nTo participate in the election, political parties had to have branches in every province in Indonesia, 75% of regencies or cities in those provinces, and 50% of districts in regencies where the party have branches [27] In April 2022, the Ministry of Law and Human Rights declared the names of 75 national political parties eligible to register for the 2024 elections [28] [29] In the end, a total of 24 political parties registered with the KPU to run in the election nationally [30] On 14 December 2022, the KPU announced that 17 parties would be eligible to contest the legislative election.\n\n\nPresidential election\nIn July 2017, the House of Representatives passed a law that only parties or coalitions with at least 20% of seats in the legislature (i.e 115 seats), or 25% of votes in the previous election are eligible to submit a presidential candidate Requirements for presidential/vice-presidential candidates are, Indonesian-born citizens, Indonesian citizens who were born abroad, a minimum age of 40 and a requirement to \"have a belief in the One and Only God\" If the candidates had spouses, they also had to be Indonesian citizens A criminal record resulting in over five years of incarceration or an active bankruptcy bars a candidate from running [40]\n\n\nCandidates\nAll legislative candidates has to be Indonesian citizens, over 21 years old, senior high school (or equivalent) graduates, and have never been convicted for a crime resulting in a sentence of five years or more In addition, the candidates for the DPR or local legislatures has to be endorsed by a political party and are required to resign from their non-legislative government offices – except for the president and vice president – or their state-owned company positions Legislators running for reelection or another body through a new political party are also required to resign [69] For each electoral district, political parties are required to have at least 30 percent of running candidates, rounded to the closest whole number, be women This was changed from the regulations in effect in the 2019 election, where the 30 percent figure would be rounded up, and thus less women candidates overall would be required [70]\n\n\nNominees\n\n\n\nWithdrawn support\nThe National Awakening Party had previously declared support for Prabowo Subianto but later rescinded their support and declared support for Anies Baswedan with the National Awakening Party's Chairman, Muhaimin Iskandar, being selected as Anies Baswedan's running mate [43] [44]\n\n\nGibran's candidacy\nAn October 2023 ruling by the Constitutional Court of Indonesia added an exception to the 40-year minimum age criteria, allowing those younger than 40 who had been previously elected as regional leaders to run as presidential or vice-presidential candidates This allowed 36-year-old Gibran Rakabuming, son of incumbent president Jokowi and mayor of Surakarta, to run for the vice-presidency The ruling was controversial as the court chief justice, Anwar Usman, is Gibran's uncle [49] [50] [51] Anwar Usman was ultimately demoted by the Majelis Kehormatan Mahkamah Konstitusi or the Honorary Council of the Constitutional Court from the position of Chief Justice on 8 November after finding him guilty of conflict of interest on the ruling [52] Furthermore, the KPU was found to have committed ethics violations surrounding Gibran's vice presidential registration for allowing him to register his candidacy before the commission had adjusted the age minimum for candidates in its internal regulation [53] A lawsuit was filed by the Indonesian Democracy Defenders (TPDI) and the Indonesian Advocates Movement (Perekat Nusantara) against Joko Widodo, Gibran Rakabuming, Anwar Usman and First Lady Iriana alleging nepotism and political dynasty on the part of the respondents, but was dismissed by the Jakarta State Administrative Court a day before the election [54]\n\n\nDebates\nFive concurrent televised presidential and vice presidential debates were held between 12 December 2023 and 4 February 2024 During the debate on 21 January, Gibran Rakabuming was seen making a \"ducking\" gesture and pretending to search for a lost item in response to an answer from Mahfud MD, which drew mostly negative reactions online for its supposed rudeness [55] [56]\n\n\nSocial media usage and disinformation\nParts of this article are copied directly from 2024 Indonesian presidential election\n\n\nAllegations of state support\nOn 12 February 2024, investigative journalist Dandhy Laksono released a documentary on YouTube directed by him, titled Dirty Vote, alleging that Joko Widodo used state funds to support Prabowo Subianto's campaign, becoming viral within the day and prompting accusations of sabotage by Prabowo's campaign team [61] The presidential office denied the claims, while protests were held in reaction to the allegations [62]\n\n\nLegislative election\nAll legislative candidates has to be Indonesian citizens,

{"title": "2021_Cuban_protests", "content": "\nBackground\nIn 2020, the economic situation in Cuba worsened The Cuban economy contracted by 10.9% in 2020, and by 2% in the first six months of 2021 [11] The economic crises emerged from a combination of factors, [46] [47] including reduced financial support (subsidized fuel) from Cuba's ally Venezuela, the United States embargo against Cuba and United States sanctions (tightened by the Trump administration in 2019), [nb 5] and the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, which hit the industry of tourism in Cuba and led to a decrease in remittances from Cubans abroad [11] [27] Currency reform, which limited Cuban pesos exchange for United States dollars because the government needed the reform package to finance imports, led to soaring inflation, [49] with rates estimated to be 500% [50] [51] The economic situation has been exacerbated by sanctions, [52] and some observers have blamed inefficiencies of Cuba's Soviet style-centrally planned economy, and a lack of reforms that other Communist states have taken [3] Pavel Vidal, a former Cuban central bank economist who teaches at Javeriana University in Colombia, stated that reforms in Cuba \"do not depend on the embargo, and the embargo should be eliminated unilaterally, independently from reforms in Cuba Both cause problems.\" [3] The Cuban government has blamed the crisis on the trade embargo and its tightness as well as the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic [3] According to Lillian Guerra, professor of Cuban history at the University of Florida, the food shortages and high prices were the result of government spending money on building hotels and tourists facilities [53] According to The Guardian, they were the result of United States sanctions and the COVID-19 pandemic [54]\n\n\nProtests\nOn 11 July 2021, at least two demonstrations emerged in San Antonio de los Baños, near Havana, and Palma Soriano, in the province of Santiago de Cuba, singing the song \"Patria y Vida\" (\"Homeland and Life\"), [14] which inspired the protests according to Nancy San Martín and Mimi Whitefield [72] Protests spread to at least 50 cities across the country [73] The song's name is an inversion of the Cuban Revolution motto Patria o Muerte (\"Homeland or Death\") Videos of protesters singing slogans of \"Down with Communism\" (also shouted by protesters in the United States), [74] \"Freedom\", and \"We are not afraid\" were broadcast on social networks, in addition to protesters demanding vaccines and an end to repression, which was aggravated by the economic crisis and the pandemic [75] [76] Opposition media outlets such as Radio y Televisión Martí have published social media videos of protests in Malecón, Havana, Santiago de Cuba, Santa Clara, Ciego de Ávila, Camagüey, Bayamo, Guantánamo, San José de las Lajas, Holguín, and Cárdenas [77] According to Orlando Gutierrez-Boronat, an exiled dissident of the Assembly of the Cuban Resistance, there were protests in more than fifteen cities and towns in Cuba [78] Gutiérrez asked the United States government to lead an international intervention to prevent protesters from being \"victims of a bloodbath\" (baño de sangre) [78] [79] [80] The San Isidro Movement called on the protesters to march to Malecón [75] Writing in Slate, Baruch College professor Ted Henken suggested that the Cuban demonstrators' use of the Internet to mobilize and publicize the protests showed \"that the Internet can still be a force for democracy\", [nb 7] and wrote that \"in authoritarian contexts like Cuba, where the government has long since monopolized the mass media and transformed journalism into political propaganda, access to unfiltered channels of information and communication can indeed shift the balance of power in small but powerful ways.\" [81]\n\n\n11 July\nOn 11 July 2021, at least two demonstrations emerged in San Antonio de los Baños, near Havana, and Palma Soriano, in the province of

and communication can indeed shift the balance of power in small but powerful ways.\" [81]\n\n\n12 July\nOn 12 July, more protests were reported in Cuba [18] [87] Camila Acosta, a journalist from the Spanish newspaper ABC, [88] was arrested [89] [90] [91] Internet watchdog NetBlocks reported that social media platforms in Cuba were censored beginning on 12 July 2021, although virtual private networks were able to bypass government blockages [92] and with a police presence in the streets of Havana Dozens of women gathered in front of police stations to inquire about the whereabouts of their husbands, children and relatives arrested or disappeared during the events of the previous day [93] [94] [95] Faced with the accusations of missing persons, Díaz-Canel stated: \"They have already come up with the fact that in Cuba we repress, we murder Where are the Cuban murders? Where is the Cuban repression? Where are the disappeared in Cuba?\" [96]\n\n\n13 July\nCuba's Ministry of Interior stated that it \"mourns the death\" of a 36-year-old man named as Diubis Laurencio Tejeda, who had taken part in the protests [33] Diubis' mother committed suicide few days later after his death [109] The Cuban dissident organization Cuba Decide estimated a toll of five deaths during the protests [31]\n\n\n14 July\nCuba's Ministry of Interior confirmed one dead and reported several injuries to citizens, including some officers [119] [120] The web page CiberCuba released a video where allegedly a black beret-wearing group, the Cuban police, break into the house of a demonstrator and fire at him immediately in front of his wife and children, detaining him afterwards [121] According to the organization of lawyers Cubalex, over 200 people have been detained and many remain in detention as of 15 July [122] [123] Deputy Minister of the Interior Jesús Manuel Burón Tabit questioned decision-making within the ministry and the Security Council as well as what he called the excessive use of police force to repress the demonstrations; [124] the Cuban government denied that he resigned after his statements [125]\n\n\n15 July\nDíaz-Canel stated that there are three kinds of protesters: counter-revolutionaries, criminals, and those with legitimate frustrations [2] Earlier on 12 July, as reported by Reuters, Díaz-Canel said that \"many protesters were sincere but manipulated by U.S.-orchestrated social media campaigns and 'mercenaries' on the ground, and warned that further 'provocations' would not be tolerated, calling on supporters to confront 'provocations.'\" [131] In a national address on 14 July, Díaz-Canel called on Cubans not to \"act with hate\" but also admitted some failures by the government, explaining: \"We have to gain experience from the disturbances We also have to carry out a critical analysis of our problems in order to act and overcome, and avoid their repetition.\" [8]\n\n\n17 July\nIn response to the anti-government protests during the previous days, there was a government-organized demonstration, which was attended by tens of thousands of supporters; [7] the Cuban government reported a turnout of about 100,000 people [133] Díaz-Canel and Raúl Castro were present and held speeches [134] In his speech during the rally, Díaz-Canel reiterated that most of blame for the unrest rested on the United States and the embargo, which he described as \"the blockade, aggression and terror\", as well as the impact of and fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic and a social network campaign allegedly spread by dissident Cuban-American groups Later in the day, Díaz-Canel acknowledged some responsibilities on the government's part About the protesters, Díaz-Canel was quoted as saying that \"there were four sectors involved in the protests: radical supporters of the United States who waved that country's flag during the protests and demanded military intervention, criminals who took advantage of the situation to loot, people genuinely desperate due to the impact of the crisis on their daily lives and young people who felt disenfranchised.\" [7]\n\n\n24 July\nA group of Cuban exiles approached Havana by sea in private floats, and launched flare lights and fireworks that were visible from land as a signal of support to the protests, creating expectation among Cuban citizens who watched, recorded, and shared the images through social media The Cuban government immediately militarized the coast of Havana, including El Malecón [135]\n\n\n28 July\nThe crackdown on the protests was followed by a heavy militarization of the streets and massive detentions [136] According to human rights organizations, an estimated of 700 people were held by the government by the end of July 2021 According to Cuban government officials, \"all investigations and detentions stemming from the July 11 protests — which included looting, attacks on police officers and acts of vandalism — have been conducted lawfully.\" Independent journalist Maykel Gonzales, who witnessed the detention and mistreatment of a group of protesters by civilian-dressed police officers, told to The New York Times: \" [Authorities'] intent was to punish, to do harm.\" [137]\n\n\n10 August\nDuring a talk in Cuban television's informative Mesa Redonda, the prime minister Manuel Marrero said: \" [Cienfuegos] province is the same as the others with the lack of antigen tests, the lack of medicines, the same objective problems But there are more complaints of subjective problems than objective When you add up the lack of medicines, this, that and the other, they're lower than the number of complaints and reports of abuse, neglect, lack of visits That's incredible.\" [138] Marrero's comments were criticized by medical personnel on social media [139] [140] Critics also complained on dealing with outnumbered health centers lacking adequate equipment, medicine, and sanitation; some invited the minister himself to treat the patients personally as physicians do [141] One of the doctors who complained about Cuba's pandemic response had a picture of \"Patria y Vida\" on his Facebook profile [142]\n\n\n17 August\nThe Cuban press published the enactment of the newly approved Decree–Law 35, [143] [144] which considers as crime the \"divulgation of fake news,\" \"offensive messages,\" and \"diffamation against the country's prestige,\" among other complementary laws that introduce 17 new felonies, cataloguing \"cybersecurity crimes\" and their \"levels of dangerosity.\" [145] Díaz-Canel wrote via his official Twitter account: \"Our Decree 35 goes against misinformation and the cyber-lie   [sic].\" [146] The announcement caused outrage among Cuban citizens, many of which argued that it greatly limits their freedom of expression on the Internet and social media even further Cuban analysts have compared the measure to the totalitarianism of Nineteen Eighty-Four [clarification needed] [22]\n\n\n15 November\nMore protests were to take place with the help of Yunior Garcia, a Cuban playwright who has been a leader as of recently in these protests However, Garcia was found to have fled the country to Spain in fear of being imprisoned Garcia believes he was not stopped because officials wanted him out of the country There have been mixed reactions to his fleeing and some commentators said they feel betrayed that he had left [147]\n\n\nArrests and prosecutions\nThe Cuban government responded to the demonstrations with a crackdown, making hundreds of arrests and charging at least 710 Cubans with crimes, including sedition, vandalism, theft, and public disorder [43] Amnesty International criticized the government for making arbitrary arrests en masse; noting that the demonstrators were largely peaceful, Amnesty wrote that \"the authorities' default approach has been to criminalize nearly all those who participated in the protests, including some children.\" [44] Amnesty named six detained Cubans as prisoners of conscience [44]\n\n\nDisappeared persons\nAccording to a report by the Spanish NGO Prisoners Defenders, more than 178 persons have disappeared during the protests in Cuba, and have not had \"contact with their relatives and for whom no document on their location exists.\" The alleged missing people include dissident and Patriotic Union of Cuba executive secretary José Daniel Ferrer, dissident rap singer Luis Manuel Otero, and dissident and human rights activist Guillermo Fariñas [149] The report mentioned journalist Camila Acosta, who was covering the protests for the Spanish newspaper ABC; however, she was put under house arrest [150] and published a report on the 25 July describing her experiences [151] The San Isidro Movement stated that Ferrer was moved to a high-security prison, [152] same as Otero [153] The UN Working Group against Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances has forwarded a request to the Permanent Representative of Cuba to the United Nations to take action regarding the disappearances [149]\n\n\nAnalysis\nWriting for the Associated Press at the height of the protests on 14 July 2021, Andrea Rodríguez summarized that many protesters \"expressed anger over long lines and shortages of food and medicines, as well as repeated electricity outages Some demanded a faster pace of vaccination against COVID-19 But there were also calls for political change in a country governed by the Communist Party for some six decades.\" Cuban authorities have stated that the United States government and its alleged enemies were organizing the protests through social networks, such as Twitter, and blamed most of the hardships on United States sanctions, which are believed to have costed at least $5.5 billion in 2020; the estimate is disputed by Cuba's critics, who also blame the government's failure to reform the state-run economy Cuba's tourism industry, which is an important source of income, has been wrecked by the COVID-19 pandemic in Cuba, while foreign aid from allies such as Venezuela declined as a result of the crisis in Venezuela, which was further exacerbated by the pandemic in the country Cuban officials appeared on state television to analyze the events, and Cuban leader Miguel Díaz-Canel went to talk to citizens [154]\n\n\nMisinformation\nThe Cuban government promoted conspiracy theories blaming western countries including the United States of being responsible for the protests, without evidence [161] This misinformation was used by the government to demonize protesters during the government's crackdown, as justification by the Cuban president for force to be used by government supporters against demonstrators and excessive prison sentences for protesters [162]\n\n\nReactions\nThe Cuban government mainly blamed the unrest on the United States and the embargo, [175] whose sanctions \"have restricted trade with Cuba since 1962\" and \"were tightened under former US President Donald Trump\" in 2019, as stated by the BBC [176] Cuban officials stated that online propaganda, coupled with scarcity created by sanctions, amounted to a \"destabilisation campaign\", and Carlos Fernandez de Cossio, head of United States affairs at the Cuban foreign ministry, stated that the internet is now \"being used as part of warfare against Cuba\"; [64] the government also acknowledged faults on its part [7] [8]\n\n\nCubans and Cuban-Americans\nThe Cuban government mainly blamed the unrest on the United States and the embargo, [175] whose sanctions \"have restricted trade with Cuba since 1962\" and \"were tightened under former US President Donald Trump\" in 2019, as stated by the BBC [176] Cuban officials stated that online propaganda, coupled with scarcity created by sanctions, amounted to a \"destabilisation campaign\", and Carlos Fernandez de Cossio, head of United States affairs at the Cuban foreign ministry, stated that the internet is now \"being used as part of warfare against Cuba\";

The economic situation was further exacerbated by currency reform, which limited Cuban pesos exchange for United States dollars, leading to soaring inflation rates estimated to be 500%. The economic situation has been exacerbated by sanctions, and some observers have blamed inefficiencies of Cuba's Soviet-style centrally planned economy and a lack of reforms that other Communist states have taken.\n\n## Protests\n\nOn 11 July 2021, at least two demonstrations emerged in San Antonio de los Baños, near Havana, and Palma Soriano, in the province of Santiago de Cuba, singing the song \"Patria y Vida\" (\"Homeland and Life\"), which inspired the protests. Protests spread to at least 50 cities across the country, with videos of protesters singing slogans of \"Down with Communism,\" \"Freedom,\" and \"We are not afraid\" being broadcast on social networks. Protesters demanded vaccines and an end to repression, which was aggravated by the economic crisis and the pandemic.\n\n## July Protests\n\n### 11 July\n\nOn 11 July 2021, at least two demonstrations emerged in San Antonio de los Baños, near Havana, and Palma Soriano, in the province of Santiago de Cuba, singing the song \"Patria y Vida\" (\"Homeland and Life\"), which inspired the protests. Protests spread to at least 50 cities across the country, with videos of protesters singing slogans of \"Down with Communism,\" \"Freedom,\" and \"We are not afraid\" being broadcast on social networks.\n\n### 12 July\n\nOn 12 July, more protests were reported in Cuba, with dozens of women gathering in front of police stations to inquire about the whereabouts of their husbands, children, and relatives arrested or disappeared during the events of the previous day.\n\n### 13 July\n\nCuba's Ministry of Interior stated that it \"mourns the death\" of a 36-year-old man named as Diubis Laurencio Tejeda, who had taken part in the protests. Diubis' mother committed suicide few days later after his death.\n\n### 14 July\n\nCuba's Ministry of Interior confirmed one dead and reported several injuries to citizens, including some officers. The web page CiberCuba released a video where allegedly a black beret-wearing group, the Cuban police, break into the house of a demonstrator and fire at him immediately in front of his wife and children, detaining him afterwards.\n\n### 15 July\n\nDíaz-Canel stated that there are three kinds of protesters: counter-revolutionaries, criminals, and those with legitimate frustrations. Earlier on 12 July, as reported by Reuters, Díaz-Canel said that \"many protesters were sincere but manipulated by U.S.-orchestrated social media campaigns and 'mercenaries' on the ground, and warned that further 'provocations' would not be tolerated, calling on supporters to confront 'provocations.'\"\n\n### 17 July\n\nIn response to the anti-government protests during the previous days, there was a government-organized demonstration, which was attended by tens of thousands of supporters. Díaz-Canel and Raúl Castro were present and held speeches.\n\n### 24 July\n\nA group of Cuban exiles approached Havana by sea in private floats, and launched flare lights and fireworks that were visible from land as a signal of support to the protests, creating expectation among Cuban citizens who watched, recorded, and shared the images through social media.\n\n### 28 July\n\nThe crackdown on the protests was followed by a heavy militarization of the streets and massive detentions. According to human rights organizations, an estimated of 700 people were held by the government by the end of July 2021.\n\n### 10 August\n\nDuring a talk in Cuban television's informative Mesa Redonda, the prime minister Manuel Marrero said: \" [Cienfuegos] province is the same as the others with the lack of antigen tests, the lack of medicines, the same objective problems But there are more complaints of subjective problems than objective When you add up the lack of medicines, this, that and the other, they're lower than the number of complaints and reports of abuse, neglect, lack of visits That's incredible.\"\n\n### 17 August\n\nThe Cuban press published the enactment of the newly approved Decree-Law 35, which considers as crime the \"divulgation of fake news,\" \"offensive messages,\" and \"diffamation against the country's prestige,\" among other complementary laws that introduce 17 new felonies, cataloguing \"cybersecurity crimes\" and their \"levels of dangerosity.\"\n\n## Arrests and Prosecutions\n\nThe Cuban government responded to the demonstrations with a crackdown, making hundreds of arrests and charging at least 710 Cubans with crimes, including sedition, vandalism, theft, and public disorder. Amnesty International criticized the government for making arbitrary arrests en masse; noting that the demonstrators were largely peaceful, Amnesty wrote that \"the authorities' default approach has been to criminalize nearly all those who participated in the protests, including some children.\" Amnesty named six detained Cubans as prisoners of conscience.\n\n## Disappeared Persons\n\nAccording to a report by the Spanish NGO Prisoners Defenders, more than 178 persons have disappeared during the protests in Cuba, and have not had \"contact with their relatives and for whom no document on their location exists.\" The alleged missing people include dissident and Patriotic Union of Cuba executive secretary José Daniel Ferrer, dissident rap singer Luis Manuel Otero, and dissident and human rights activist Guillermo Fariñas.\n\n## Analysis\n\nWriting for the Associated Press at the height of the protests on 14 July 2021, Andrea Rodríguez summarized that many protesters \"expressed anger over long lines and shortages of food and medicines, as well as repeated electricity outages Some demanded a faster pace of vaccination against COVID-19 But there were also calls for political change in a country governed by the Communist Party for some six decades.\"\n\n## Misinformation\n\nThe Cuban government promoted conspiracy theories blaming western countries including the United States of being responsible for the protests, without evidence. This misinformation was used by the government to demonize protesters during the government's crackdown, as justification by the Cuban president for force to be used by government supporters against demonstrators and excessive prison sentences for protesters.\n\n## Reactions\n\nThe Cuban government mainly blamed the unrest on the United States and the embargo, whose sanctions \"have restricted trade with Cuba since 1962\" and \"were tightened under former US President Donald Trump\" in 2019, as stated by the BBC. Cuban officials stated that online propaganda, coupled with scarcity created by sanctions, amounted to a \"destabilisation campaign\", and Carlos Fernandez de Cossio, head of United States affairs at the Cuban foreign ministry, stated that the internet is now \"being used as part of warfare against Cuba\"; the government also acknowledged faults on its part.\n\n## Supranational Organizations\n\nFollowing the protests in July, dissidents called for protests on 15 November, which were banned by the Cuban government. The planned protests largely fizzled under pressure from authorities and government supporters, while Cuban Americans in Miami held rallies and led prayers to support the dissidents on the island.\n\n## Human Rights Groups\n\nFollowing the protests in July, dissidents called for protests on 15 November, which were banned by the Cuban government. The planned protests largely fizzled under pressure from authorities and government supporters, while Cuban Americans in Miami held rallies and led prayers to support the dissidents on the island.\n\n## November Protests\n\nFollowing the protests in July, dissidents called for protests on 15 November, which were banned by the Cuban government.

contracted by 10.9% in 2020, and by 2% in the first six months of 2021 [11] The economic crises emerged from a combination of factors, [46] [47] including reduced financial support (subsidized fuel) from Cuba's ally Venezuela, the United States embargo against Cuba and United States sanctions (tightened by the Trump administration in 2019), [nb 5] and the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, which hit the industry of tourism in Cuba and led to a decrease in remittances from Cubans abroad [11] [27] Currency reform, which limited Cuban pesos exchange for United States dollars because the government needed the reform package to finance imports, led to soaring inflation, [49] with rates estimated to be 500% [50] [51] The economic situation has been exacerbated by sanctions, [52] and some observers have blamed inefficiencies of Cuba's Soviet style-centrally planned economy, and a lack of reforms that other Communist states have taken [3] Pavel Vidal, a former Cuban central bank economist who teaches at Javeriana University in Colombia, stated that reforms in Cuba \"do not depend on the embargo, and the embargo should be eliminated unilaterally, independently from reforms in Cuba Both cause problems.\" [3] The Cuban government has blamed the crisis on the trade embargo and its tightness as well as the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic [3] According to Lillian Guerra, professor of Cuban history at the University of Florida, the food shortages and high prices were the result of government spending money on building hotels and tourists facilities [53] According to The Guardian, they were the result of United States sanctions and the COVID-19 pandemic [54]\n\n\nProtests\nOn 11 July 2021, at least two demonstrations emerged in San Antonio de los Baños, near Havana, and Palma Soriano, in the province of Santiago de Cuba, singing the song \"Patria y Vida\" (\"Homeland and Life\"), [14] which inspired the protests according to Nancy San Martín and Mimi Whitefield [72] Protests spread to at least 50 cities across the country [73] The song's name is an inversion of the Cuban Revolution motto Patria o Muerte (\"Homeland or Death\") Videos of protesters singing slogans of \"Down with Communism\" (also shouted by protesters in the United States), [74] \"Freedom\", and \"We are not afraid\" were broadcast on social networks, in addition to protesters demanding vaccines and an end to repression, which was aggravated by the economic crisis and the pandemic [75] [76] Opposition media outlets such as Radio y Televisión Martí have published social media videos of protests in Malecón, Havana, Santiago de Cuba, Santa Clara, Ciego de Ávila, Camagüey, Bayamo, Guantánamo, San José de las Lajas, Holguín, and Cárdenas [77] According to Orlando Gutierrez-Boronat, an exiled dissident of the Assembly of the Cuban Resistance, there were protests in more than fifteen cities and towns in Cuba [78] Gutiérrez asked the United States government to lead an international intervention to prevent protesters from being \"victims of a bloodbath\" (baño de sangre) [78] [79] [80] The San Isidro Movement called on the protesters to march to Malecón [75] Writing in Slate, Baruch College professor Ted Henken suggested that the Cuban demonstrators' use of the Internet to mobilize and publicize the protests showed \"that the Internet can still be a force for democracy\", [nb 7] and wrote that \"in authoritarian contexts like Cuba, where the government has long since monopolized the mass media and transformed journalism into political propaganda, access to unfiltered channels of information and communication can indeed shift the balance of power in small but powerful ways.\" [81]\n\n\n11 July\nOn 11 July 2021, at least two demonstrations

women gathered in front of police stations to inquire about the whereabouts of their husbands, children and relatives arrested or disappeared during the events of the previous day [93] [94] [95] Faced with the accusations of missing persons, Díaz-Canel stated: \"They have already come up with the fact that in Cuba we repress, we murder Where are the Cuban murders? Where is the Cuban repression? Where are the disappeared in Cuba?\" [96]\n\n\n13 July\nCuba's Ministry of Interior stated that it \"mourns the death\" of a 36-year-old man named as Diubis Laurencio Tejeda, who had taken part in the protests [33] Diubis' mother committed suicide few days later after his death [109] The Cuban dissident organization Cuba Decide estimated a toll of five deaths during the protests [31]\n\n\n14 July\nCuba's Ministry of Interior confirmed one dead and reported several injuries to citizens, including some officers [119] [120] The web page CiberCuba released a video where allegedly a black beret-wearing group, the Cuban police, break into the house of a demonstrator and fire at him immediately in front of his wife and children, detaining him afterwards [121] According to the organization of lawyers Cubalex, over 200 people have been detained and many remain in detention as of 15 July [122] [123] Deputy Minister of the Interior Jesús Manuel Burón Tabit questioned decision-making within the ministry and the Security Council as well as what he called the excessive use of police force to repress the demonstrations; [124] the Cuban government denied that he resigned after his statements [125]\n\n\n15 July\nDíaz-Canel stated that there are three kinds of protesters: counter-revolutionaries, criminals, and those with legitimate frustrations [2] Earlier on 12 July, as reported by Reuters, Díaz-Canel said that \"many protesters were sincere but manipulated by U.S.-orchestrated social media campaigns and 'mercenaries' on the ground, and warned that further 'provocations' would not be tolerated, calling on supporters to confront 'provocations.'\" [131] In a national address on 14 July, Díaz-Canel called on Cubans not to \"act with hate\" but also admitted some failures by the government, explaining: \"We have to gain experience from the disturbances We also have to carry out a critical analysis of our problems in order to act and overcome, and avoid their repetition.\" [8]\n\n\n17 July\nIn response to the anti-government protests during the previous days, there was a government-organized demonstration, which was attended by tens of thousands of supporters; [7] the Cuban government reported a turnout of about 100,000 people [133] Díaz-Canel and Raúl Castro were present and held speeches [134] In his speech during the rally, Díaz-Canel reiterated that most of blame for the unrest rested on the United States and the embargo, which he described as \"the blockade, aggression and terror\", as well as the impact of and fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic and a social network campaign allegedly spread by dissident Cuban-American groups Later in the day, Díaz-Canel acknowledged some responsibilities on the government's part About the protesters, Díaz-Canel was quoted as saying that \"there were four sectors involved in the protests: radical supporters of the United States who waved that country's flag during the protests and demanded military intervention, criminals who took advantage of the situation to loot, people genuinely desperate due to the impact of the crisis on their daily lives and young people who felt disenfranchised.\" [7]\n\n\n24 July\nA group of Cuban exiles approached Havana by sea in private floats, and launched flare lights and fireworks that were visible from land as a signal of support to the protests, creating expectation among Cuban citizens who watched, recorded, and shared the images through social media The Cuban government immediately militarized the coast of Havana, including El Malecón [135]\n\n\n28 July\nThe crackdown on the protests was followed by a heavy militarization of the streets and massive detentions [136] According to human rights organizations, an estimated of 700 people were held by the government by the end of July 2021 According to Cuban government officials, \"all investigations and detentions stemming from the July 11 protests — which included looting, attacks on police officers and acts of vandalism — have been conducted lawfully.\" Independent journalist Maykel Gonzales, who witnessed the detention and mistreatment of a group of protesters by civilian-dressed police officers, told to The New York Times: \" [Authorities'] intent was to punish, to do harm.\" [137]\n\n\n10 August\nDuring a talk in Cuban television's informative Mesa Redonda, the prime minister Manuel Marrero said: \" [Cienfuegos] province is the same as the others with the lack of antigen tests, the lack of medicines, the same objective problems But there are more complaints of subjective problems than objective When you add up the lack of medicines, this, that and the other, they're lower than the number of complaints and reports of abuse, neglect, lack of visits That's incredible.\" [138] Marrero's comments were criticized by medical personnel on social media [139] [140] Critics also complained on dealing with outnumbered health centers lacking adequate equipment, medicine, and sanitation;

the estimate is disputed by Cuba's critics, who also blame the government's failure to reform the state-run economy Cuba's tourism industry, which is an important source of income, has been wrecked by the COVID-19 pandemic in Cuba, while foreign aid from allies such as Venezuela declined as a result of the crisis in Venezuela, which was further exacerbated by the pandemic in the country Cuban officials appeared on state television to analyze the events, and Cuban leader Miguel Díaz-Canel went to talk to citizens [154]\n\n\nMisinformation\nThe Cuban government promoted conspiracy theories blaming western countries including the United States of being responsible for the protests, without evidence [161] This misinformation was used by the government to demonize protesters during the government's crackdown, as justification by the Cuban president for force to be used by government supporters against demonstrators and excessive prison sentences for protesters [162]\n\n\nReactions\nThe Cuban government mainly blamed the unrest on the United States and the embargo, [175] whose sanctions \"have restricted trade with Cuba since 1962\" and \"were tightened under former US President Donald Trump\" in 2019, as stated by the BBC [176] Cuban officials stated that online propaganda, coupled with scarcity created by sanctions, amounted to a \"destabilisation campaign\", and Carlos Fernandez de Cossio, head of United States affairs at the Cuban foreign ministry, stated that the internet is now \"being used as part of warfare against Cuba\";

[9]\n\n\nMission integration\nWhen the Mars 2020 program was approved in July 2014, [13] a helicopter flight demonstration was neither included nor budgeted [14]\n\n\nDevelopment team\nThe Ingenuity team was comparatively small, with never more than 65 full-time-equivalent employees from JPL Program workers from AeroVironment, NASA AMES and Langley research centers brought the total to 150 [5] Key personnel include:\n\n\nOpposition\nThe idea to include a helicopter in the Mars 2020 mission was opposed by several people Up until the end of the 2010s, several NASA leaders, scientists and JPL employees argued against integrating a helicopter into the mission For three years, the future Ingenuity was developed outside the Mars 2020 project and its budget [60] [61] And although NASA management accepted assurances in the spring of 2018 that the addition of a helicopter would not harm the goals of the expedition, Mars 2020 chief scientist, Kenneth Farley, stated \"I have personally been opposed to it because we are working very hard for efficiencies and spending 30 days working on a technology demonstration does not further those goals directly from the science point of view\"

designed and built by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and its partner AeroVironment. The helicopter was launched on 30 July 2020, as part of the Mars 2020 mission, which includes the Perseverance rover. Ingenuity is the first helicopter to fly on another planet and has undergone several flights on Mars. The helicopter's primary mission was to demonstrate its ability to fly on Mars and to test its capabilities for future missions.\n\n**Development**\n\nThe development of Ingenuity started in 2012 when JPL director Charles Elachi visited the lab's Autonomous Systems Division, which had done relevant concept work. By January 2015, NASA agreed to fund the development of a full-size model, which came to be known as the \"risk reduction\" vehicle. NASA's JPL and AeroVironment published the conceptual design in 2014 for a scout helicopter to accompany a rover. By mid-2016, $15 million was being requested to continue development of the helicopter.\n\n**Mission Integration**\n\nWhen the Mars 2020 program was approved in July 2014, a helicopter flight demonstration was neither included nor budgeted. However, the development team continued to work on the helicopter's design and development, and it was eventually integrated into the Mars 2020 mission. The helicopter's deployment on the Martian surface was a key milestone in the mission.\n\n**Development Team**\n\nThe Ingenuity team was comparatively small, with never more than 65 full-time-equivalent employees from JPL. Program workers from AeroVironment, NASA AMES, and Langley research centers brought the total to 150. Key personnel included Charles Elachi, JPL director, and Arduaine P. Le Mahieu, AeroVironment's chief engineer.\n\n**Opposition**\n\nThe idea to include a helicopter in the Mars 2020 mission was opposed by several people. Up until the end of the 2010s, several NASA leaders, scientists, and JPL employees argued against integrating a helicopter into the mission. For three years, the future Ingenuity was developed outside the Mars 2020 project and its budget. Although NASA management accepted assurances in the spring of 2018 that the addition of a helicopter would not harm the goals of the expedition, Mars 2020 chief scientist, Kenneth Farley, stated that he had personally been opposed to it because they were working very hard for efficiencies and spending 30 days working on a technology demonstration does not further those goals directly from the science point of view.\n\n**Design**\n\nIngenuity consists of a rectangular fuselage measuring 136 mm × 195 mm × 163 mm (5.4 in × 7.7 in × 6.4 in) suspended below a pair of coaxial counter-rotating rotors measuring 1.21 m (4 ft) in diameter.

1911–1993), was born in Greenock, Scotland, and came to the United States at age 11 His father, Angelo (1910–1994), was an insurance salesman born in New York to immigrants from Flumeri, Campania, Italy Leno grew up in Andover, Massachusetts and graduated from Andover High School [4] He obtained a bachelor's degree in speech therapy from Emerson College in Boston, where he started a comedy club in 1973 [5] His older brother, Patrick (May 12, 1940 – October 6, 2002), [6] was a Vietnam War veteran who became an attorney.\n\n\nCareer\nLeno made his first appearance on The Tonight Show on March 2, 1977, performing a comedy routine [7] [8] During the 1970s, he had minor roles in several television series and films, first in the 1976 episode \"J.J in Trouble\" of Good Times, and the same year in the pilot of Holmes & Yo-Yo After an uncredited appearance in the 1977 film Fun with Dick and Jane, he played more prominent roles in 1978 in American Hot Wax and Silver Bears His other film and television appearances from that period include Almost Heaven (1978), \"Going Nowhere\" (1979) on One Day at a Time, Americathon (1979), Polyester (1981), \"The Wild One\" (1981) on Alice, and both \"Feminine Mistake\" (1979) and \"Do the Carmine\" (1983) on Laverne & Shirley His only starring film role was the 1989 direct-to-video Collision Course, with Pat Morita He also appeared numerous times on Late Night with David Letterman.\n\n\nEarly career\nLeno made his first appearance on The Tonight Show on March 2, 1977, performing a comedy routine [7] [8] During the 1970s, he had minor roles in several television series and films, first in the 1976 episode \"J.J in Trouble\" of Good Times, and the same year in the pilot of Holmes & Yo-Yo After an uncredited appearance in the 1977 film Fun with Dick and Jane, he played more prominent roles in 1978 in American Hot Wax and Silver Bears His other film and television appearances from that period include Almost Heaven (1978), \"Going Nowhere\" (1979) on One Day at a Time, Americathon (1979), Polyester (1981), \"The Wild One\" (1981) on Alice, and both \"Feminine Mistake\" (1979) and \"Do the Carmine\" (1983) on Laverne & Shirley His only starring film role was the 1989 direct-to-video Collision Course, with Pat Morita He also appeared numerous times on Late Night with David Letterman.\n\n\nThe Tonight Show\nStarting in 1986, Leno was a regular substitute host for Johnny Carson on The Tonight Show In 1992, he replaced Carson as host [9] amid controversy with David Letterman, who had been hosting Late Night with David Letterman since 1982 (which aired after The Tonight Show), and whom many—including Carson himself—expected to be Carson's successor The story of this turbulent transition became the basis of a book and a movie Leno continued to perform as a stand-up comedian throughout his Tonight Show tenure In 1988, he received a contract extension with NBC itself [10] The July 1995 episode of The Tonight Show which featured an interview with Hugh Grant (who had been arrested for receiving oral sex in a public place from a prostitute) saw Leno rate higher than Letterman for the first time [11]\n\n\nMichael Jackson trial\nDuring the 2005 trial of Michael Jackson over allegations of child molestation, Leno was one of a few celebrities who appeared as defense witnesses In his testimony regarding a phone conversation with the accuser, Leno testified that he was not asked for any money and there did not appear to be any coaching — but the calls seemed unusual and scripted [21]\n\n\nSuccession by Conan O'Brien; The Jay Leno Show\nBecause Leno's show continued to lead all late-night programming in the Nielsen ratings, the pending expiration of his contract led to speculation about whether he would become a late-night host for another network when his commitment to NBC expired [23] He left The Tonight Show on Friday, May 29, 2009, [24] [25] and Conan O'Brien took over on June 1, 2009.\n\n\nTimeslot conflict and return to The Tonight Show\nIn their new roles, neither O'Brien nor Leno succeeded in delivering the viewing audiences the network anticipated On January 7, 2010, multiple media outlets reported that beginning March 1, 2010, Leno would move from his 10 p.m weeknight time slot to 11:35 p.m., due to a combination of pressure from local affiliates, whose newscasts were suffering, and both Leno's and O'Brien's poor ratings [29] [30] Leno's show would be shortened from an hour to 30 minutes All NBC late night programming would also be preempted by the 2010 Winter Olympics between February 15 and 26, moving The Tonight Show to 12:05 a.m., the first post-midnight timeslot in its history O'Brien's contract stipulated that NBC could move the show ahead to 12:05 a.m without penalty (a clause included primarily to accommodate sports preemptions) [31]\n\n\nAnnouncement of successor\nOn April 3, 2013, NBC announced that Leno would leave The Tonight Show in spring 2014, with Jimmy Fallon as his designated successor [41]\n\n\nAfter The Tonight Show\nLeno has maintained an active schedule as a touring stand-up comedian, doing an average of 200 live performances a year in venues across the United States and Canada [42] and at charity events and USO tours [43] [44] He has also appeared on the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon [45] and Late Night with Seth Meyers, [46] [47] and was a guest on the finale of The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson [45] He appeared in a cameo role drilling and tormenting James Corden in a facetious boot camp for talk-show hosts on the premiere of The Late Late Show with James Corden [48] He declined an invitation to appear on Late Show with David Letterman despite speculation he would appear on the show's finale in 2015, [49] although he had appeared with Letterman along with Winfrey in a Late Show commercial airing during Super Bowl XLIV in 2010 [50]\n\n\nPublic image\nLeno has faced criticism for his perceived role in the 2010 Tonight Show conflict [61] [62] Critics have cited a 2004 Tonight Show clip where Leno said he would allow O'Brien to take over without incident [62] [63] At the time, Leno said he did not want O'Brien to leave for a competing network, adding, \"I'll be 59 when  [the switch occurs] That's five years from now There's really only one person who could have done this into his 60s, and that was Johnny Carson; I think it's fair to say I'm no Johnny Carson.\" [63] Leno also described The Tonight Show as a dynasty, saying, \"You hold it and hand it off to the next person And I don't want to see all the fighting.\" At the end of the segment, he said, \"Conan, it's yours! See you in five years, buddy!\" [64]\n\n\nCriticism\nLeno has faced criticism for his perceived role in the 2010 Tonight Show conflict [61] [62] Critics have cited a 2004 Tonight Show clip where Leno said he would allow O'Brien to take over without incident [62] [63] At the time, Leno said he did not want O'Brien to leave for a competing network, adding, \"I'll be 59 when  [the switch occurs] That's five years from now There's really only one person who could have done this into his 60s, and that was Johnny Carson; I think it's fair to say I'm no Johnny Carson.\" [63] Leno also described The Tonight Show as a dynasty, saying, \"You hold it and hand it off to the next person And I don't want to see all the fighting.\" At the end of the segment, he said, \"Conan, it's yours!

He is a humanoid shark with a complex and often unclear origin story, which has been explored in various comic book series and storylines.\n\nBiography\n-----------\n\n### Born in Hawaii\n\nNanaue, the protagonist of the King Shark story, is a humanoid shark born in Hawaii. His father is often referred to as the \"King of All Sharks,\" or the Shark God, which adds to the mystery surrounding his origins. This has led to some controversy, with characters such as special agent Sam Makoa dismissing his origins as superstition and referring to him as a \"savage mutation.\"\n\nHowever, the now-ended Aquaman: Sword of Atlantis series has firmly established Nanaue as the Shark God's son, putting an end to the controversy.\n\n### The New 52 - Infinite Frontier\n\nIn the 2011 DC Comics reboot, The New 52, King Shark was reimagined as a humanoid hammerhead shark. He was tortured and forced into the Suicide Squad by Amanda Waller, where he was tasked with complying with her demands. During this time, King Shark ended up eating his teammate Yo-Yo, although it was later revealed that Yo-Yo survived.\n\nKing Shark was also among the villains recruited by the Crime Syndicate during the 2013 \"Forever Evil\" storyline to join the Secret Society of Super Villains.\n\n### Dawn of DC\n\nDuring the \"Titans: Beast World\" storyline, King Shark was exposed to Beast Boy's spores and temporarily transformed into a tiger hybrid. This marked a significant development in his character, as it showed that he was capable of adapting to new environments and situations.\n\nPowers and Abilities\n--------------------\n\nNanaue's augmented flesh provides protection against underwater pressures and physical attacks. His shark-like physiology includes natural weapons, such as teeth and a powerful tail, as well as gills that allow him to breathe in the water.\n\nHe is capable of swimming at great speeds, regrowing lost bodily tissues, and withstanding cold temperatures. Nanaue also possesses enhanced strength, stamina, and senses, which make him a formidable opponent in battle.\n\nOne of his most unique abilities is his ability to sense or call out his shark \"cousins\" for assistance. This allows him to tap into a collective consciousness of sharks, which can be both a blessing and a curse.\n\nFurthermore, his mystical nature means that his bite can even pierce the skin of Kryptonians, making him a formidable opponent even against the most powerful beings in the DC Universe.\n\nOther Versions\n--------------\n\n### Alternate Versions\n\nAn alternate version of King Shark appears in the \"Flashpoint\" storyline, where he is a strongman who works at Haley's Circus. He is killed during an Amazon attack, which adds a tragic element to his character.\n\nThis version of King Shark highlights the complexity of his character, as he is a multifaceted being with a rich history and backstory.\n\nIn other media\n-------------\n\n### Television\n\nKing Shark has made appearances in various animated television series, including \"Young Justice\" and \"Justice League Unlimited.\" His character has been well-received by fans and critics alike, who appreciate his unique abilities and complex personality.\n\n### Film\n\nKing Shark has not appeared in any live-action films, although he has been mentioned in various DC Comics movies. However, with the success of the DC Extended Universe, it is possible that he may make an appearance in a future film.\n\n### Video Games\n\nKing Shark has appeared in various video games, including \"Injustice: Gods Among Us\" and \"Injustice 2.\" His character has been well-received by gamers, who appreciate his unique abilities and playstyle.\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\nKing Shark has also appeared in various other media, including comic book series, graphic novels, and trade paperbacks.

He doesn't just crawl out of the ground He has his own mythology, right? So that has to be explored.\" [71] Downes has previously provided voice roles for various DC animated films and shows as well as DC video games [70]\n\n\nProduction\nIn the early 2000s, Warner Bros wanted to reboot the Superman film series with an origin story [100] In August 2001, Andrew Kevin Walker was hired after pitching the studio an idea titled Batman vs Superman, attaching Wolfgang Petersen as director [101] Walker's draft was thought of as too dark by the studio, who hired Akiva Goldsman to do a rewrite, which was codenamed Asylum [102] [103] Warner Bros wanted Johnny Depp as Batman and Josh Hartnett as Superman [104] Filming was to start in early 2003, with plans for a five- to six-month shoot and a release date was set for the summer of 2004 [105] In late 2002, Petersen, however, put the project on hold to make Troy [106] In August 2008, the studio's President of Production Jeff Robinov admitted, \"Had Superman worked in 2006 (i.e with Superman Returns), we would have had a movie for Christmas of this year or 2009 Now the plan is just to reintroduce Superman without regard to a Batman and Superman movie at all.\"\n\n\nDevelopment\nIn the early 2000s, Warner Bros

Costner, Diane Lane, Laurence Fishburne, Harry Lennix and Christina Wren reprise their roles from Man of Steel [75] [76] [125] Joining the cast are Ben Affleck as Batman, Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor, Jeremy Irons as Alfred Pennyworth, [125] Ray Fisher as Cyborg, [87] Jason Momoa as Aquaman, Ezra Miller as The Flash [85] [86] and Tao Okamoto as Luthor's assistant Mercy Graves [66] Scoot McNairy and Callan Mulvey were cast as Wallace Keefe and Anatoli Knyazev, while Jena Malone was cast as Jenet Klyburn, a character that was featured exclusively in the Ultimate Edition home media release [44] [60] [97] [126]\n\n\nDesign\nMichael Wilkinson reprised his duties as costume designer He updated the Superman suit from Man of Steel so that it \"feels fresh and right for this installment of Zack Snyder's comic-book universe\" [152] The first Batsuit featured in the film is influenced by The Dark Knight Returns; [153] unlike the suits seen in previous live-action Batman films, it is made of cloth instead of armor and is a cast of the physique of fitness model Rossano Rea [154] [155] An image of the Wonder Woman costume was revealed at the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con, in which the costume desaturates the red, blue, and gold colors that make up the costume of most versions of the character [156]\n\n\nFilming\nIn September 2013, Larry Fong joined the crew as cinematographer, having previously worked with Zack Snyder on 300, Watchmen, and Sucker Punch [161] Initial filming commenced on October 19, 2013, at East Los Angeles College, to shoot an American football game between Gotham City University and rival Metropolis State University [162] At the end of the month, construction began on the Kent farm seen in Man of Steel for the film [163] Principal photography involving the main cast of the film began on May 19, 2014, in Detroit, Michigan, [164] with scenes featuring Gal Gadot as Diana Prince being filmed early on May 16 [165] While filming in Michigan, the production spent a total of $199 million in the state [7] The scene of a state funeral at the Arlington National Cemetery, a tribute by the United States Army, [166] was actually filmed in Michigan as well, using green screen [167]\n\n\nMusic\nHans Zimmer composed the film score, [175] emphasizing a challenge not to reuse the themes he established with the Batman character from Christopher Nolan's trilogy [176] Junkie XL, who provided additional music in Man of Steel, also returned for this film, helping to compose the theme for Batman [177] Originally, Zimmer enlisted Junkie XL to compose the Batman material, with Zimmer planning to focus solely on the Superman side of the score, but the final Batman theme was written by both composers as a collaboration [178] Zimmer noted that he had significant trouble in finding a new angle from which to tell the story and after the release of the film, Zimmer announced that he was retired from superhero films, [179] though he has since retracted this [180] The soundtrack album of the film was released on March 18, 2016, by WaterTower Music [181]\n\n\nMarketing\nAn estimated $165 million marketing effort helped promote Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice [187] At the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con, Snyder introduced the film's first footage intended to be exclusive to the event [188] A teaser trailer was scheduled to be screened in selected cinemas on April 20, 2015 [189] However, on April 16, the trailer leaked online, [190] and within a few hours Snyder officially released the trailer to Twitter [191] At the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con, Snyder and the cast attended to present an initial trailer of the film While the teaser had received mixed response, the trailer was positively received by attendees, who gave it a standing ovation [192] Mark Hughes of Forbes said the trailers \"both set the stage for a story about the world's distrust and fear of Superman, Batman's rage at Superman and intention to duke it out with the Man of Steel, and Wonder Woman's participation in a big fight featuring the 'Trinity'.\" [193]\n\n\nRelease\nIn November 2013, Warner Bros announced that Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice would be released on July 17, 2015 In January 2014, however, the studio announced that it was delayed from its original release date and moved to May 6, 2016, in order to give the filmmakers \"time to realize fully their vision, given the complex visual nature of the story.\" [216] [217] In August 2014, the release date was moved up to March 25, 2016, with a Warner Bros insider saying the studio was \"not flinching\" in regards to the previous opening date being on the same day as Marvel Studios' Captain America: Civil War, but instead stating that March 2016 was a \"fantastic corridor\" for them [218] According to sources obtained by The Hollywood Reporter, Warner Bros considered the possibility of having a 70mm release for the film, which was partially shot in the 65mm IMAX format [219]\n\n\nReception\nThe film grossed $166 million in the United States and Canada in its opening weekend, [228] [229] the eighth-biggest opening of all time, ahead of The Dark Knight Rises' $160.9 million [228] The film had a worldwide opening of $422.5 million, which stands as the second-biggest for Warner Bros and the fourth-biggest of all time at the time of its release [230] [231] It became the fourth film to have a global opening above $400 million [232] It also had an IMAX worldwide opening weekend total of $36 million from 945 IMAX screens, the third-biggest ever, behind Star Wars: The Force Awakens ($48 million) and Jurassic World ($44 million) [232] However, both inside and outside of the United States, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice experienced a notable poor Friday-to-Sunday hold and set a new record for the worst Friday-to-Sunday drop for a superhero movie release in modern box office history with a 58% decline, which was previously held by

Superman: Dawn of Justice**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is a 2016 American superhero film directed by Zack Snyder and produced by Charles Roven, Deborah Snyder, and Christopher Nolan. The film is a sequel to Man of Steel and serves as an origin story for the DC Extended Universe. The movie features an ensemble cast, including Ben Affleck as Batman, Henry Cavill as Superman, and Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. The film's plot follows an epic battle between Batman and Superman, as they clash over their differing views on how to protect humanity.\n\n**Plot**\n\nIn a flashback to his childhood, Bruce Wayne runs from his parents' funeral. He falls into a cave, where a circling vortex of bats elevates him back to the surface. In the present, eighteen months after his cataclysmic battle with General Zod in Metropolis, Superman has become a controversial figure. Bruce is now a billionaire who has operated in Gotham City as the masked vigilante Batman for twenty years. Having witnessed the battle in person, he sees Superman as an existential threat to humanity.\n\nThe film begins with a prologue showcasing the aftermath of Superman's battle with General Zod, which has left Metropolis in ruins. The government is torn between appreciating Superman's heroism and fearing his power. The President of the United States, Lex Luthor, a wealthy and cunning businessman, sees an opportunity to exploit Superman's vulnerability and begins to manipulate the situation.\n\nMeanwhile, in Gotham City, Bruce Wayne is struggling with his own demons. He is haunted by the memories of his parents' murder and feels responsible for not being able to protect them. He has also become increasingly obsessed with the idea of taking down Superman, whom he sees as a threat to humanity.\n\nThe plot thickens when Superman is accused of being a terrorist and is forced to go into hiding. Batman, determined to take down Superman, begins to investigate and gather evidence against him. However, as he delves deeper, he discovers that Lex Luthor is behind the plot to destroy Superman and that he has been manipulating the government to turn against the Man of Steel.\n\nAs the battle between Batman and Superman intensifies, Wonder Woman arrives on the scene, determined to stop the conflict and bring the two superheroes together. However, she soon realizes that Lex Luthor is the true enemy and that he has been using the two superheroes to further his own agenda.\n\nThe film culminates in an epic battle between Batman, Superman, and Lex Luthor, with Wonder Woman playing a crucial role in the outcome. In the end, the heroes emerge victorious, but not without scars. The film ends with a new beginning, as the DC Extended Universe is set to expand with the introduction of new characters and storylines.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features an ensemble cast, including:\n\n* Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne/Batman\n* Henry Cavill as Kal-El/Clark Kent/Superman\n* Gal Gadot as Diana Prince/Wonder Woman\n* Amy Adams as Lois Lane\n* Laurence Fishburne as Perry White\n* Diane Lane as Martha Kent\n* Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor\n* Jeremy Irons as Alfred Pennyworth\n* Ray Fisher as Victor Stone/Cyborg\n* Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry/Aquaman\n* Ezra Miller as Barry Allen/The Flash\n* Tao Okamoto as Mercy Graves\n\n**Production**\n\nThe film was produced by Charles Roven, Deborah Snyder, and Christopher Nolan. The screenplay was written by Chris Terrio and Zack Snyder, based on a story by David S. Goyer. The film's music was composed by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL. The cinematography was handled by Larry Fong.\n\nThe film was shot on location in Detroit, Michigan, and on a soundstage in Los Angeles. The film's production budget was estimated to be around $300 million.\n\n**Design**\n\nThe film's costume design was handled by Michael Wilkinson, who updated the Superman suit from Man of Steel to make it feel fresh and right for this installment of Zack Snyder's comic-book universe. The first Batsuit featured in the film is influenced by The Dark Knight Returns. Unlike the suits seen in previous live-action Batman films, it is made of cloth instead of armor and is a cast of the physique of fitness model Rossano Rea.\n\nAn image of the Wonder Woman costume was revealed at the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con, in which the costume desaturates the red, blue, and gold colors that make up the costume of most versions of the character.\n\n**Filming**\n\nInitial filming commenced on October 19, 2013, at East Los Angeles College, to shoot an American football game between Gotham City University and rival Metropolis State University. At the end of the month, construction began on the Kent farm seen in Man of Steel for the film.\n\nPrincipal photography involving the main cast of the film began on May 19, 2014, in Detroit, Michigan. Scenes featuring Gal Gadot as Diana Prince were filmed early on May 16. While filming in Michigan, the production spent a total of $199 million in the state.\n\n**Music**\n\nHans Zimmer composed the film score, emphasizing a challenge not to reuse the themes he established with the Batman character from Christopher Nolan's trilogy. Junkie XL, who provided additional music in Man of Steel, also returned for this film, helping to compose the theme for Batman.\n\nOriginally, Zimmer enlisted Junkie XL to compose the Batman material, with Zimmer planning to focus solely on the Superman side of the score, but the final Batman theme was written by both composers as a collaboration.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nAn estimated $165 million marketing effort helped promote Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. At the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con, Snyder introduced the film's first footage intended to be exclusive to the event.\n\nA teaser trailer was scheduled to be screened in selected cinemas on April 20, 2015. However, on April 16, the trailer leaked online, and within a few hours Snyder officially released the trailer to Twitter.\n\nAt the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con, Snyder and the cast attended to present an initial trailer of the film. While the teaser had received mixed response, the trailer was positively received by attendees, who gave it a standing ovation.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe film was originally scheduled to be released on July 17, 2015. However, in January 2014, the studio announced that it was delayed from its original release date and moved to May 6, 2016, in order to give the filmmakers \"time to realize fully their vision, given the complex visual nature of the story.\"\n\nIn August 2014, the release date was moved up to March 25, 2016, with a Warner Bros insider saying the studio was \"not flinching\" in regards to the previous opening date being on the same day as Marvel Studios' Captain America: Civil War, but instead stating that March 2016 was a \"fantastic corridor\" for them.\n\n**Box Office**\n\nThe film grossed $166 million in the United States and Canada in its opening weekend, the eighth-biggest opening of all time, ahead of The Dark Knight Rises' $160.9 million. The film had a worldwide opening of $422.5 million, which stands as the second-biggest for Warner Bros and the fourth-biggest of all time at the time of its release.\n\nIt became the fourth film to have a global opening above $400 million. It also had an IMAX worldwide opening weekend total of $36 million from 945 IMAX screens, the third-biggest ever, behind Star Wars: The Force Awakens ($48 million) and Jurassic World ($44 million).\n\n**Critical Response**\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 29% based on 439 reviews and an average rating of 5/10.

director's original version of the film before additional editing, critics noted that the film would have likely been better received with the additional footage [350] [351] Ben Kendrick of Screen Rant stated that while it was more \"intelligible\", character portrayal was not \"fundamentally changed\" and \"for viewers who didn't like Man of Steel or Batman v Superman for larger reasons, such as tone, approach, and the darker characterization of DC's most iconic heroes, the Ultimate Edition is only a longer.. version of a film that.. is likely to remain divisive, even if the final product is a better film.\" [352] Phil Owens of TheWrap called it an improvement upon the original cut, writing, \"Lo and behold somehow Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice has become something that approaches

The by-election was triggered by the resignation of Owen Paterson, the Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency, following a controversy surrounding his paid advocacy work.\n\n**Background**\n\nNorth Shropshire is the third-largest constituency by area in the West Midlands region, covering an area of approximately 381 square miles. The constituency contains five small towns, in size order: Oswestry, Market Drayton, Whitchurch, Wem, and Ellesmere. In the 2016 European Union referendum, 60% of constituents who turned out voted to leave the European Union.\n\n**Constituency**\n\nNorth Shropshire is a rural constituency located in the north of the county of Shropshire, in the West Midlands region of England. The constituency covers an area of approximately 381 square miles, making it one of the largest constituencies in the United Kingdom. The constituency includes the towns of Oswestry, Market Drayton, Whitchurch, Wem, and Ellesmere, as well as several smaller villages and rural areas. The constituency has a diverse range of landscapes, including rolling hills, farmland, and woodland.\n\n**Trigger**\n\nThe by-election was triggered by the resignation of Owen Paterson, the Conservative MP for North Shropshire, on 5 November 2021. In October 2021, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards found that Paterson had breached paid advocacy rules in relation to two companies that employed him as a paid consultant. The Commons Standards Committee considered the commissioner's findings and recommended that Paterson be suspended from parliament for 30 days. In line with the established process, a motion was proposed in the Commons inviting MPs to approve the punishment. If the suspension had been approved, a recall petition would have been triggered in the constituency.\n\n**Candidates**\n\nThere were 14 candidates in the by-election. The candidates included:\n\n* Helen Morgan (Liberal Democrats)\n* Neil Shastri-Hurst (Conservative)\n* Ben Gummer (Conservative)\n* Richard Howson (Conservative)\n* Liz Dux (Labour)\n* Heather Kidd (Labour)\n* Alan Myers (Brexit Party)\n* Andrew Fisher (Green)\n* Tom Jones (Green)\n* Guy Westcott (Monster Raving Loony Party)\n* Richard Conti (Reform UK)\n* John Abrahams (Independent)\n* Graham Billington (Independent)\n* John Walsh (Independent)\n\n**Endorsements**\n\nAn editorial in The Guardian newspaper suggested that tactical voting for the Liberal Democrats be employed by the electorate to try to reduce the Conservative majority in the seat. The editorial stated that Labour voters should set aside their tribal loyalty and back the Liberal Democrat candidate.\n\n**Campaign**\n\nSeveral candidates were running on an anti-corruption ticket, while others used it in their campaign material, including Labour's Liz Dux. Several local issues also featured in the campaign, including local funding. Katy Balls in The Spectator analysed the effect that the variety of problems currently facing the government, and impacting Boris Johnson's popularity (which include tax rises, English Channel migrant crossings and the controversy surrounding the resignation of Paterson, the former MP of the constituency), might have on the election result. She said that a Lib Dem source commented that \"Peppa Pig has come up more than sleaze\" and that local issues such as the ambulance services, and questions over the Tory candidate being based in Birmingham were being raised by electors.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe Liberal Democrat candidate, Helen Morgan, won the election with a majority of 5,925, indicating a swing of 34.2 percentage points. The swing was the seventh largest in United Kingdom by-election history, and the second largest swing from the Conservative Party to the Liberal Democrats or its predecessors (the Liberal Party and SDP–Liberal Alliance) at a by-election since 1945. It was also the first time a non-Conservative won the seat since Liberal candidate Allan Heywood Bright in 1904, when the constituency was named Oswestry.\n\n**Previous election**\n\nThe 2019 general election was held on 12 December 2019, and the Conservative Party candidate, Owen Paterson, won the seat with a majority of 7,142.\n\n**See also**\n\n* 2019 North Shropshire by-election\n* 2016 European Union referendum\n* Brexit\n* Conservative Party\n* Liberal Democrats\n* Labour Party\n* Green Party\n* Brexit Party\n* Reform UK\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe 2021 North Shropshire by-election was a significant event in British politics, with a large swing from the Conservative Party to the Liberal Democrats.

{"title": "John_Major", "content": "\nEarly life and education (1943–1959)\nJohn Major was born on 29 March 1943 at St Helier Hospital and Queen Mary's Hospital for Children in St Helier, Surrey, to Gwen Major (née Coates, 1905–1970) and former music hall performer Tom Major-Ball (1879–1962), who was 63 years old when Major was born [3] He was christened \"John Roy Major\" but only \"John Major\" was recorded on his birth certificate; [4] [5] he used his middle name until the early 1980s [6] His birth had been a difficult one, with his mother suffering from pleurisy and pneumonia and John requiring several blood transfusions due to an infection, causing permanent scarring to his ankles [7] [8]\n\n\nEarly post-school career (1959–1979)\nMajor's first job was as a clerk in the London-based insurance brokerage firm Price Forbes in 1959, though finding the job dull and offering no prospects he quit [31] [32] Major began working with his brother Terry at the garden ornaments business; this had been sold in 1959, enabling the family to move to a larger residence at 80 Burton Road, Brixton [33] [34] Major's father died on 27 March 1962 [35] [34] John left the ornaments business the following year to care for his ill mother, though when she got better he was unable to find a new job and was unemployed for much of the latter half of 1962, a situation he says was \"degrading\" [34]\n\n\nEarly parliamentary career (1979–1987)\nMajor won the Huntingdon seat by a large margin in the 1979 general election, which brought the Conservatives led by Margaret Thatcher to power [84] He made his maiden speech in the House of Commons on 13 June 1979, voicing his support for the government's budget [85] [86] [87] Major assiduously courted contacts at all levels of the party in this period, joining the informal 'Guy Fawkes club' of Conservative MPs and attending various Committees [88] [89] He became Secretary of the Environment Committee and also assisted with work on the Housing Act 1980, which allowed council house tenants the Right to Buy their homes [90] At this time Major lived in De Vere Close, Hemingford Grey.\n\n\nIn Cabinet (1987–1990)\nFollowing the 1987 general election, in which Major retained his seat with an increased majority, [118] [119] he was promoted to the Cabinet as Chief Secretary to the Treasury, making him the first MP of the 1979 intake to reach the Cabinet [120] [121] [nb 7] The then-Chancellor Nigel Lawson generally made significant decisions with little input from others, and Major was put in charge of agreeing departmental budgets with the Secretaries of State [122] These discussions went well, and for the first time in several years budgets were agreed without recourse to the external adjudication of the so-called 'Star Chamber' [123] [124] Major successfully concluded a second round of such spending reviews in July 1988 [125] [126]\n\n\nChief Secretary to the Treasury (1987–1989)\nFollowing the 1987 general election, in which Major retained his seat with an increased majority, [118] [119] he was promoted to the Cabinet as Chief Secretary to the Treasury, making him the first MP of the 1979 intake to reach the Cabinet [120] [121] [nb 7] The then-Chancellor Nigel Lawson generally made significant decisions with little input from others, and Major was put in charge of agreeing departmental budgets with the Secretaries of State [122] These discussions went well, and for the first time in several years budgets were agreed without recourse to the external adjudication of the so-called 'Star Chamber' [123] [124] Major successfully concluded a second round of such spending reviews in July 1988 [125] [126]\n\n\nForeign Secretary (July–October 1989)\nIn 1987–1988, it became clear that Major had become a 'favourite' of Thatcher's and he was widely tipped for further promotion [131] Nevertheless, Major's appointment to Foreign Secretary in July 1989 came as a surprise due to his relative lack of experience in the Cabinet and unfamiliarity with international affairs [132] [133] Major found the prospect daunting, and unsuccessfully attempted to convince Thatcher to allow him to stay on at the Treasury [132] There were also fears within the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) that Major would be Thatcher's 'hatchet-man', as her relations with the department under Geoffrey Howe had been poor and characterised by mutual distrust [134] Major accepted the job and began to settle into the department, living in an upstairs room at the FCO and devolving decision making where necessary, though he found the increased security burdensome and disliked the extensive ceremonial aspects of the role [135] [136]\n\n\nChancellor of the Exchequer (1989–1990)\nAfter just three months as Foreign Secretary Major was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer on 26 October 1989 following the sudden resignation of Nigel Lawson, who had fallen out with Thatcher over what he saw as her excessive reliance on the advice of her Economic Adviser Alan Walters [152] [153] [154] [nb 8] The appointment meant that, despite only being in the Cabinet for a little over two years, Major had gone from the most junior position in the Cabinet to holding two of the Great Offices of State Major made tackling inflation a priority, stating that tough measures were needed to bring it down and that \"if it isn't hurting, it isn't working.\" [156] [157] He delivered his first Autumn Statement on 15 November, announcing a boost in spending (mainly for the NHS) and with interest rates to be kept as they were [158] [159]\n\n\nConservative Party leadership contest\nOpposition within the Conservative Party to Margaret Thatcher had been brewing for some time, focusing on what was seen as her brusque, imperious style and the poll tax, which was facing serious opposition across the country In December 1989, she had survived a leadership bid by Anthony Meyer; though she won easily, 60 MPs had not voted for her, and it was rumoured that many more had had to be strong-armed into supporting her [184] [185] [186] By early 1990, it was clear that bills for many under the new poll tax regime would be higher than anticipated, and opposition to the Tax grew, with a non-payment campaign gaining much support and an anti-poll tax demonstration in Trafalgar Square in March ending in rioting [187] The Conservatives lost the 1990 Mid Staffordshire by-election to Labour and the 1990 Eastbourne by-election to the Liberal Democrats, both Conservative seats, causing many Conservative MPs to worry about their prospects at the upcoming general election, due in 1991 or 1992 [188] [189] [190] Thatcher's staunch anti-European stance also alienated pro-Europe Conservatives [191] [177] On 1 November, the pro-European deputy prime minister Geoffrey Howe resigned, issuing a fiercely critical broadside against Thatcher in the House of Commons on 13 November [192] [193] [194]\n\n\nPrime Minister (1990–1997)\nMajor became prime minister on 28 November 1990 when he accepted the Queen's invitation to form a government, succeeding Margaret Thatcher He inherited a majority government from Margaret Thatcher who had been the prime minister for the previous eleven years The Conservatives' popularity was low, with some polling showing Labour's Neil Kinnock with a 23% lead over the Tories in April 1990 following the introduction of the Community Charge (poll tax) [209] By the time of Major's appointment, Labour's lead had shrunk to 14% [209] However, by 1991, the Conservatives had narrowly retaken Labour in the polls [210]\n\n\nFirst Major ministry (1990–1992)\nMajor became prime minister on 28 November 1990 when he accepted the Queen's invitation to form a government, succeeding Margaret Thatcher He inherited a majority government from Margaret Thatcher who had been the prime minister for the previous eleven years The Conservatives' popularity was low, with some polling showing Labour's Neil Kinnock with a 23% lead over the Tories in April 1990 following the introduction of the Community Charge (poll tax) [209] By the time of Major's appointment, Labour's lead had shrunk to 14% [209] However, by 1991, the Conservatives had narrowly retaken Labour in the polls [210]\n\n\nSecond Major ministry (1992–1997)\nTo the surprise of many pollsters, the Conservatives won a majority on the 9 April election, with 336 seats, and earning 41.9% of the vote [216] [217] With a high turnout, the Conservatives earned over 14 million votes which remains a record in any UK general election [218] This was the Conservatives' fourth consecutive election victory Neil Kinnock was replaced by John Smith as Labour leader and Leader of the Opposition in 1992 [219]\n\n\nFinal years in Parliament (1997–2001)\nSpeculation over Major's leadership had continued since his re-election in 1995, and intensified as it became increasingly likely that the Conservatives would suffer a landslide defeat in the upcoming general election During this period, Michael Portillo had frequently been touted as the favourite to replace Major, but lost his seat in the election, thus eliminating him from the running Although many Conservative MPs wanted Major to resign as leader immediately because of the 1997 election loss, there was a movement among the grassroots of the party, encouraged by his political allies, to have him stay on as leader until the autumn Lord Cranborne, his chief of staff during the election, and the chief whip, Alastair Goodlad, both pleaded with him to stay on: they argued that remaining as leader for a few months would give the party time to come to terms with the scale of defeat before electing a successor [227] Major refused, saying: \"It would be terrible, because I would be presiding with no authority over a number of candidates fighting for the crown It would merely prolong the agony.\" [228]\n\n\nPost-parliamentary life (2001–present)\nSince leaving office, Major has tended to maintain a low profile in the media, occasionally commentating on political developments in the role of an elder statesman [238] In 1999 he published an autobiography, covering his early life and time in office, which was generally well received [239] [240] Major went on to write a book about the history of cricket in 2007 (More Than a Game: The Story of Cricket's Early Years) [241] and a book about music hall (My Old Man: A Personal History of Music Hall) in 2012 [242]\n\n\nRevelation of affair\nIn 1993 Major sued two magazines, New Statesman and Society and Scallywag, as well as their distributors, for reporting rumours of an affair with Clare Latimer, a Downing Street caterer, even though at least one of the magazines had said that the rumours were false The allegations of an affair with Latimer were indeed proven false However, an affair with Edwina Currie came out a decade later and both of these publications considered legal action to recover their costs when that happened [267] [268]\n\n\nPolitical engagement\nMajor has become an active after-dinner speaker, earning over £25,000 per engagement for his \"insights and his own opinions\" on politics and other matters according to his agency [273] Major is also actively involved in various think tanks: he is the chair of the Panel of senior advisers at Chatham House (having previously served as a president of Chatham House), [248] a member of the International Advisory Boards of the Peres Center for Peace in Israel, [248] the InterAction Council, [248] the Baker Institute in Houston, [274] and a Patron of the Atlantic Partnership [248] [274] Major was also a director with the Ditchley Foundation from 2000 to 2009, [260] [275] and a president of the influential centre-right think tank the Bow Group from 2012 to 2014 [276]\n\n\nAssessment and legacy\nMajor's mild-mannered style and moderate political stance contrasted with that of Thatcher and made him theoretically well placed to act as a conciliatory and relatively uncontroversial leader of his party In spite of that, conflict raged within the parliamentary Conservative Party, particularly over the extent of Britain's integration with the European Union Major never succeeded in reconciling the ‘Euro-rebels’ among his MPs to his European policy, who although relatively few in number wielded great influence because of his small majority and their wider following among Conservative activists and voters [298] Episodes such as the Maastricht Rebellion, led by Bill Cash and Margaret Thatcher, inflicted serious political damage on him and his government The additional bitterness on the right wing of the Conservative Party at the manner in which Margaret Thatcher had been deposed did not make Major's task any easier, with many viewing him as a weak and vacillating leader [298] Ongoing sleaze-related scandals among leading Conservative MPs did Major and his government no favours either, decreasing support for the party amongst the public.\n\n\nRepresentation in the media\nDuring his leadership of the Conservative Party, Major was portrayed as honest (\"Honest John\") [317] [318] but unable to exert effective control over his fractious party However, his polite, easy-going manner was initially well received by both his supporters and his critics [319] Major's appearance was noted for its greyness, his prodigious philtrum, and large glasses, all of which were exaggerated in caricatures For example, in Spitting Image, Major's puppet was changed from a circus performer to that of a literally grey man who ate dinner with his wife in silence, occasionally saying \"nice peas, dear\", while at the same time nursing an unrequited crush on his colleague Virginia Bottomley – an invention, but an ironic one in view of his affair with Edwina Currie, which was not then a matter of public knowledge By the end of his premiership his puppet would often be shown observing the latest fiasco and ineffectually murmuring \"oh dear\" [320] [321] Long-standing Conservative MP Enoch Powell, when asked about Major, stated \"I simply find myself asking – does he really exist?\", [322] whereas on the left Labour's Alastair Campbell dismissed him as a \"piece of lettuce that passes for prime minister\" [323] and Labour MP Tony Banks said of Major in 1994 that, \"He was a fairly competent Chairman of Housing on Lambeth Council Every time he gets up now I keep thinking, 'What on earth is Councillor Major doing?' I can't believe he's here and sometimes I think he can't either.\" [324]\n\n\nPersonal life\nMajor married Norma Johnson (now Dame Norma Major) on 3 October 1970 at St Matthew's Church, Brixton [346] [62] [63] She was a teacher and a member of the Young Conservatives They met on polling day for the Greater London Council elections in London, and became engaged after only ten days [347] They have two children: a daughter, Elizabeth (born November 1971) [68] [69] and a son, James (b January 1975) [70] They continue to live at their constituency home, Finings, in Great Stukeley, Huntingdonshire [258] They also own a flat in London and a holiday home on the Norfolk coast at Weybourne, which they have in the past invited ex-soldiers to use for free as part of the Afghan Heroes charity [258] [249] [348] As with all former prime ministers, Major is entitled to round-the-clock police protection [349] [350]\n\n\nHonours\nIn the 1999 New Year Honours List, Major was made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour for his work on the Northern Ireland peace process [376]\n\n\nAwards\nIn 2008, Major won the British Sports Book Awards (Best Cricket Book) for More Than a Game [384]\n\n\nPublic commemoration\nAn oil painting of Major, painted in 1996 by June Mendoza, is part of the Parliamentary collection, [385] [386] as is a bronze bust by Anne Curry, unveiled in the Members' Lobby on 16 October 2017 [387] [388] [389] There is another bust of Major in the Norman Shaw Building North by Neale Andrew, sculpted in 1993 and installed in 2004; however, this is not accessible to the public [390] [391]\n\n\nArms\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nPrimary sources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**John Major**\n\nJohn Major is a British politician who served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1990 to 1997.

Major began working with his brother Terry at the garden ornaments business; this had been sold in 1959, enabling the family to move to a larger residence at 80 Burton Road, Brixton. Major's father died on 27 March 1962. John left the ornaments business the following year to care for his ill mother, though when she got better he was unable to find a new job and was unemployed for much of the latter half of 1962, a situation he says was \"degrading\".\n\n**Early Parliamentary Career (1979-1987)**\n\nMajor won the Huntingdon seat by a large margin in the 1979 general election, which brought the Conservatives led by Margaret Thatcher to power. He made his maiden speech in the House of Commons on 13 June 1979, voicing his support for the government's budget. Major assiduously courted contacts at all levels of the party in this period, joining the informal 'Guy Fawkes club' of Conservative MPs and attending various Committees. He became Secretary of the Environment Committee and also assisted with work on the Housing Act 1980, which allowed council house tenants the Right to Buy their homes. At this time Major lived in De Vere Close, Hemingford Grey.\n\n**In Cabinet (1987-1990)**\n\nFollowing the 1987 general election, in which Major retained his seat with an increased majority, he was promoted to the Cabinet as Chief Secretary to the Treasury, making him the first MP of the 1979 intake to reach the Cabinet. The then-Chancellor Nigel Lawson generally made significant decisions with little input from others, and Major was put in charge of agreeing departmental budgets with the Secretaries of State. These discussions went well, and for the first time in several years budgets were agreed without recourse to the external adjudication of the so-called 'Star Chamber'. Major successfully concluded a second round of such spending reviews in July 1988.\n\n**Chief Secretary to the Treasury (1987-1989)**\n\nFollowing the 1987 general election, in which Major retained his seat with an increased majority, he was promoted to the Cabinet as Chief Secretary to the Treasury, making him the first MP of the 1979 intake to reach the Cabinet.

These discussions went well, and for the first time in several years budgets were agreed without recourse to the external adjudication of the so-called 'Star Chamber'. Major successfully concluded a second round of such spending reviews in July 1988.\n\n**Foreign Secretary (July-October 1989)**\n\nIn 1987-1988, it became clear that Major had become a 'favourite' of Thatcher's and he was widely tipped for further promotion. Nevertheless, Major's appointment to Foreign Secretary in July 1989 came as a surprise due to his relative lack of experience in the Cabinet and unfamiliarity with international affairs. Major found the prospect daunting, and unsuccessfully attempted to convince Thatcher to allow him to stay on at the Treasury. There were also fears within the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) that Major would be Thatcher's 'hatchet-man', as her relations with the department under Geoffrey Howe had been poor and characterised by mutual distrust. Major accepted the job and began to settle into the department, living in an upstairs room at the FCO and devolving decision making where necessary, though he found the increased security burdensome and disliked the extensive ceremonial aspects of the role.\n\n**Chancellor of the Exchequer (1989-1990)**\n\nAfter just three months as Foreign Secretary Major was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer on 26 October 1989 following the sudden resignation of Nigel Lawson, who had fallen out with Thatcher over what he saw as her excessive reliance on the advice of her Economic Adviser Alan Walters. The appointment meant that, despite only being in the Cabinet for a little over two years, Major had gone from the most junior position in the Cabinet to holding two of the Great Offices of State. Major made tackling inflation a priority, stating that tough measures were needed to bring it down and that \"if it isn't hurting, it isn't working.\" He delivered his first Autumn Statement on 15 November, announcing a boost in spending (mainly for the NHS) and with interest rates to be kept as they were.\n\n**Conservative Party Leadership Contest**\n\nOpposition within the Conservative Party to Margaret Thatcher had been brewing for some time, focusing on what was seen as her brusque, imperious style and the poll tax, which was facing serious opposition across the country. In December 1989, she had survived a leadership bid by Anthony Meyer; though she won easily, 60 MPs had not voted for her, and it was rumoured that many more had had to be strong-armed into supporting her. By early 1990, it was clear that bills for many under the new poll tax regime would be higher than anticipated, and opposition to the Tax grew, with a non-payment campaign gaining much support and an anti-poll tax demonstration in Trafalgar Square in March ending in rioting. The Conservatives lost the 1990 Mid Staffordshire by-election to Labour and the 1990 Eastbourne by-election to the Liberal Democrats, both Conservative seats, causing many Conservative MPs to worry about their prospects at the upcoming general election, due in 1991 or 1992. Thatcher's staunch anti-European stance also alienated pro-Europe Conservatives. On 1 November, the pro-European deputy prime minister Geoffrey Howe resigned, issuing a fiercely critical broadside against Thatcher in the House of Commons on 13 November.\n\n**Prime Minister (1990-1997)**\n\nMajor became prime minister on 28 November 1990 when he accepted the Queen's invitation to form a government, succeeding Margaret Thatcher. He inherited a majority government from Margaret Thatcher who had been the prime minister for the previous eleven years. The Conservatives' popularity was low, with some polling showing Labour's Neil Kinnock with a 23% lead over the Tories in April 1990 following the introduction of the Community Charge (poll tax). By the time of Major's appointment, Labour's lead had shrunk to 14%. However, by 1991, the Conservatives had narrowly retaken Labour in the polls.\n\n**First Major Ministry (1990-1992)**\n\nMajor became prime minister on 28 November 1990 when he accepted the Queen's invitation to form a government, succeeding Margaret Thatcher. He inherited a majority government from Margaret Thatcher who had been the prime minister for the previous eleven years. The Conservatives' popularity was low, with some polling showing Labour's Neil Kinnock with a 23% lead over the Tories in April 1990 following the introduction of the Community Charge (poll tax). By the time of Major's appointment, Labour's lead had shrunk to 14%. However, by 1991, the Conservatives had narrowly retaken Labour in the polls.\n\n**Second Major Ministry (1992-1997)**\n\nTo the surprise of many pollsters, the Conservatives won a majority on the 9 April election, with 336 seats, and earning 41.9% of the vote. With a high turnout, the Conservatives earned over 14 million votes which remains a record in any UK general election. This was the Conservatives' fourth consecutive election victory. Neil Kinnock was replaced by John Smith as Labour leader and Leader of the Opposition in 1992.\n\n**Final Years in Parliament (1997-2001)**\n\nSpeculation over Major's leadership had continued since his re-election in 1995, and intensified as it became increasingly likely that the Conservatives would suffer a landslide defeat in the upcoming general election. During this period, Michael Portillo had frequently been touted as the favourite to replace Major, but lost his seat in the election, thus eliminating him from the running. Although many Conservative MPs wanted Major to resign as leader immediately because of the 1997 election loss, there was a movement among the grassroots of the party, encouraged by his political allies, to have him stay on as leader until the autumn. Lord Cranborne, his chief of staff during the election, and the chief whip, Alastair Goodlad, both pleaded with him to stay on: they argued that remaining as leader for a few months would give the party time to come to terms with the scale of defeat before electing a successor. Major refused, saying: \"It would be terrible, because I would be presiding with no authority over a number of candidates fighting for the crown. It would merely prolong the agony.\"\n\n**Post-Parliamentary Life (2001-Present)**\n\nSince leaving office, Major has tended to maintain a low profile in the media, occasionally commentating on political developments in the role of an elder statesman. In 1999 he published an autobiography, covering his early life and time in office, which was generally well received. Major went on to write a book about the history of cricket in 2007 (More Than a Game: The Story of Cricket's Early Years) and a book about music hall (My Old Man: A Personal History of Music Hall) in 2012.\n\n**Revelation of Affair**\n\nIn 1993 Major sued two magazines, New Statesman and Society and Scallywag, as well as their distributors, for reporting rumours of an affair with Clare Latimer, a Downing Street caterer, even though at least one of the magazines had said that the rumours were false. The allegations of an affair with Latimer were indeed proven false. However, an affair with Edwina Currie came out a decade later and both of these publications considered legal action to recover their costs when that happened.\n\n**Political Engagement**\n\nMajor has become an active after-dinner speaker, earning over £25,000 per engagement for his \"insights and his own opinions\" on politics and other matters according to his agency. Major is also actively involved in various think tanks: he is the chair of the Panel of senior advisers at Chatham House (having previously served as a president of Chatham House), a member of the International Advisory Boards of the Peres Center for Peace in Israel, the InterAction Council, the Baker Institute in Houston, and a Patron of the Atlantic Partnership. Major was also a director with the Ditchley Foundation from 2000 to 2009, and a president of the influential centre-right think tank the Bow Group from 2012 to 2014.\n\n**Assessment and Legacy**\n\nMajor's mild-mannered style and moderate political stance contrasted with that of Thatcher and made him theoretically well placed to act as a conciliatory and relatively uncontroversial leader of his party. In spite of that, conflict raged within the parliamentary Conservative Party, particularly over the extent of Britain's integration with the European Union. Major never succeeded in reconciling the ‘Euro-rebels’ among his MPs to his European policy, who although relatively few in number wielded great influence because of his small majority and their wider following among Conservative activists and voters. Episodes such as the Maastricht Rebellion, led by Bill Cash and Margaret Thatcher, inflicted serious political damage on him and his government. The additional bitterness on the right wing of the Conservative Party at the manner in which Margaret Thatcher had been deposed did not make Major's task any easier, with many viewing him as a weak and vacillating leader. Ongoing sleaze-related scandals among leading Conservative MPs did Major and his government no favours either, decreasing support for the party amongst the public.\n\n**Representation in the Media**\n\nDuring his leadership of the Conservative Party, Major was portrayed as honest (\"Honest John\") but unable to exert effective control over his fractious party. However, his polite, easy-going manner was initially well received by both his supporters and his critics. Major's appearance was noted for its greyness, his prodigious philtrum, and large glasses, all of which were exaggerated in caricatures. For example, in Spitting Image, Major's puppet was changed from a circus performer to that of a literally grey man who ate dinner with his wife in silence, occasionally saying \"nice peas, dear\", while at the same time nursing an unrequited crush on his colleague Virginia Bottomley – an invention, but an ironic one in view of his affair with Edwina Currie, which was not then a matter of public knowledge. By the end of his premiership his puppet would often be shown observing the latest fiasco and ineffectually murmuring \"oh dear\".\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nMajor married Norma Johnson (now Dame Norma Major) on 3 October 1970 at St Matthew's Church, Brixton. She was a teacher and a member of the Young Conservatives. They met on polling day for the Greater London Council elections in London, and became engaged after only ten days. They have two children: a daughter, Elizabeth (born November 1971) and a son, James (born January 1975). They continue to live at their constituency home, Finings, in Great Stukeley, Huntingdonshire. They also own a flat in London and a holiday home on the Norfolk coast at Weybourne, which they have in the past invited ex-soldiers to use for free as part of the Afghan Heroes charity.\n\n**Honours**\n\nIn the 1999 New Year Honours List, Major was made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour for his work on the Northern Ireland peace process.\n\n**Awards**\n\nIn 2008, Major won the British Sports Book Awards (Best Cricket Book) for More Than a Game.\n\n**Public Commemoration**\n\nAn oil painting of Major, painted in 1996 by June Mendoza, is part of the Parliamentary collection, as is a bronze bust by Anne Curry, unveiled in the Members' Lobby on 16 October 2017. There is another bust of Major in the Norman Shaw Building North by Neale Andrew, sculpted in 1993 and installed in 2004; however, this is not accessible to the public.\n\n**Arms**\n\nThe arms of John Major are: Argent, on a fess wavy Azure between in chief two oak leaves Vert and in base a rose Gules a sword Or.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* John Major in popular culture\n* Premiership of John Major\n* List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom\n* List of Conservative Party leaders\n* List of MPs elected in the 1979 United Kingdom general election\n\n**References**\n\n* Major, J.

life and education (1943–1959)\nJohn Major was born on 29 March 1943 at St Helier Hospital and Queen Mary's Hospital for Children in St Helier, Surrey, to Gwen Major (née Coates, 1905–1970) and former

Wilder as influences [11] [27] [97] [98] [99]\n\n\nInfluences\nAnderson attended film school for two days, preferring instead to learn by watching the films of directors he liked along with the accompanying director's audio commentary [8] [13] [14] He has cited Robert Altman, Jonathan Demme, Robert Downey, Sr., Alfred Hitchcock, John Huston, Stanley Kubrick, Akira Kurosawa, Mike Leigh, David Mamet, Anthony Mann, Vincente Minnelli, Max Ophüls, Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Frank Tashlin, François Truffaut, Orson Welles and Billy Wilder as influences [11] [27] [97] [98] [99]\n\n\nThemes and style\nAnderson is known for films set in the San Fernando Valley with realistically flawed and desperate characters [13] [100] Among the themes dealt with in the films are dysfunctional families, [27] [98] [101] alienation, [98] surrogate families, [102] regret, [98] loneliness, [27] destiny, [7] the power of forgiveness, [6] and ghosts of the past [27] Anderson makes frequent use of repetition to build emphasis and thematic consistency In Boogie Nights, Magnolia, Punch Drunk Love, and The Master, the phrase \"I didn't do anything\" is used at least once, developing themes of responsibility and denial [103] [104] [105] [106] Anderson's films are known for their bold visual style [100] which includes stylistic trademarks, such as constantly moving camera shots, [41] [100] steadicam-based long takes, [25] [27] [107] memorable use of music, [25] [41] [100] and multilayered audiovisual imagery [25] [107] Anderson tends to reference the Book of Exodus, either explicitly or subtly, such as in recurring references to Exodus 8:2 in Magnolia, [108] which chronicles the plague of frogs, culminating with the literal raining of frogs in the film's climax, or the title and themes in There Will Be Blood, a phrase in Exodus 7:19, which details the plague of blood [109] [110]\n\n\nCollaborators\nAnderson frequently collaborates with many actors and crew, carrying them over on each film [116] He has referred to regular actors as \"my little rep company\", including John C Reilly, Philip Baker Hall, Julianne Moore, William H Macy, Melora Walters and Philip Seymour Hoffman [117] Luis Guzmán is also considered an Anderson regular [118] Hoffman acted in Anderson's first four films [119] as well as The Master [57] Except for Paul F Tompkins, Kevin Breznahan and Jim Meskimen, who all had equally minor roles in Magnolia, [120] There Will Be Blood had an entirely new cast Anderson is one of three directors – the others being Jim Sheridan and Martin Scorsese – with whom Daniel Day-Lewis has collaborated more than once [121] Robert Elswit served as a cinematographer for Anderson's films, except The Master which was shot by Mihai Mălaimare Jr [122] and Phantom Thread which has no credited cinematographer Jon Brion served as a composer for Hard Eight, Magnolia and Punch-Drunk Love, [123] and Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead for every film since [124] Dylan Tichenor edited Boogie Nights, Magnolia, There Will Be Blood and Phantom Thread [125] [126] Anderson regularly works with producers, JoAnne Sellar, Scott Rudin, Michael De Luca and Daniel Lupi, [127] and casting director Cassandra Kulukundis [57]\n\n\nFilmography\nAnderson is a vegan [128]\n\n\nPersonal life\nAnderson is a vegan [128]\n\n\nAwards and recognition\nAnderson has been called \"one of the most exciting talents to come along in years\" [133] and \"among the supreme talents of today.\" [134] After the release of Boogie Nights and Magnolia, Anderson was praised as a \"wunderkind\" [135] In 2007, the American Film Institute regarded him as \"one of American film's modern masters.\" [113] In 2012, The Guardian ranked him number one on its list of \"The 23 Best Film Directors in the World,\" writing \"his dedication to his craft has intensified, with his disdain for PR and celebrity marking him out as the most devout filmmaker of his generation.\" [136] In 2013, Entertainment Weekly named him the eighth-greatest working director, calling him \"one of the most dynamic directors to emerge in the last 20 years.\" [137] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote that \"The Master, the sixth film from the 42-year-old writer-director, affirms his position as the foremost filmmaking talent of his generation Anderson is a rock star, the artist who knows no limits.\" [138]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is one of the most popular and widely contested events in the sport, with top athletes from around the world vying for medals and world records.\n\n**Race Dynamics**\n\nAt the start, some athletes play psychological games such as trying to be last to the starting blocks. This is a tactic used to gain an advantage by making their competitors think they are the most relaxed and confident athlete on the track.\n\n### **Start**\n\nAt the start, some athletes play psychological games such as trying to be last to the starting blocks. This is a tactic used to gain an advantage by making their competitors think they are the most relaxed and confident athlete on the track. The starting blocks are designed to allow athletes to explode off the line, and the fastest athlete to burst out of the blocks has a significant advantage.\n\n### **Mid-Race**\n\nRunners usually reach their top speed just past the halfway point of the race and progressively decelerate to the finish. Maintaining that top speed for as long as possible is a primary focus of training for the 100 metres. Pacing and running tactics do not play a significant role in the 100 metres, as success in the event depends more on pure athletic qualities and technique.\n\n### **Finish**\n\nThe winner, by IAAF Competition Rules, is determined by the first athlete with their torso (not including limbs, head, or neck) over the nearer edge of the finish line. There is therefore no requirement for the entire body to cross the finish line. When the placing of the athletes is not obvious, a photo finish is used to distinguish which runner was first to cross the line.\n\n**Climatic Conditions**\n\nClimatic conditions, in particular air resistance, can affect performances in the 100 metres. A strong head wind is very detrimental to performance, while a tail wind can improve performances significantly. For this reason, a maximum tail wind of 2.0 metres per second (4.5 mph) is allowed for a 100 metres performance to be considered eligible for records, or \"wind legal\".\n\n**10-Second and 11-Second Barriers**\n\nThe 10-second mark had been widely considered a barrier for the 100 metres in men's sprinting. The first man to break the 10-second barrier with automatic timing was Jim Hines at the 1968 Summer Olympics. Since then, over 190 sprinters have run faster than 10 seconds. Similarly, 11 seconds is considered the standard for female athletes. The first woman to go under 11 seconds was Marlies Göhr in 1977.\n\n**Record Performances**\n\nMajor 100 metres races, such as at the Olympic Games, attract much attention, particularly when the world record is thought to be within reach.

{"title": "Instagram", "content": "\nHistory\nInstagram began development in San Francisco as Burbn, a mobile check-in app created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger On March 5, 2010, Systrom closed a $500,000 (equivalent to $682,200 in 2023) seed funding round with Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz while working on Burbn [10] [11] Realizing that it was too similar to Foursquare, they refocused their app on photo-sharing, which had become a popular feature among its users [12] [13] They renamed it Instagram, a portmanteau of instant camera and telegram [14]\n\n\n2010–2011: Beginnings and major funding\nJosh Riedel joined the company in October as Community Manager, [15] Shayne Sweeney joined in November as an engineer, [15] and Jessica Zollman joined as a Community Evangelist in August 2011 [15] [16]\n\n\n2012–2014: Additional platforms and acquisition by Facebook\nOn April 3, 2012, Instagram released a version of its app for Android phones, [21] [22] and it was downloaded more than one million times in less than one day [23] The Android app has since received two significant updates: first, in March 2014, which cut the file size of the app by half and added performance improvements; [24] [25] then in April 2017, to add an offline mode that allows users to view and interact with content without an Internet connection At the time of the announcement, it was reported that 80% of Instagram's 600 million users were located outside the U.S., and while the aforementioned functionality was live at its announcement, Instagram also announced its intention to make more features available offline, and that they were \"exploring an iOS version\" On April 9, 2012, Facebook, Inc (now Meta Platforms) bought Instagram for $1 billion (equivalent to $1,312,000,000 in 2023) in cash and stock, [26] [27] [28] with a plan to keep the company independently managed [29] [30] [31] Britain's Office of Fair Trading approved the deal on August 14, 2012, [32] and on August 22, 2012, the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S closed its investigation, allowing the deal to proceed [33] On September 6, 2012, the deal between Instagram and Facebook officially closed with a purchase price of $300 million in cash and 23 million shares of stock [34]\n\n\n2015–2017: Redesign and Windows app\nIn June 2015, the desktop website user interface was redesigned to become more flat and minimalistic, but with more screen space for each photo and to resemble the layout of Instagram's mobile website [40] [41] [42] Furthermore, one row of pictures only has three instead of five photos to match the mobile layout The slideshow banner [43] [44] on the top of profile pages, which simultaneously slide-showed seven picture tiles of pictures posted by the user, alternating at different times in a random order, has been removed In addition, the formerly angular profile pictures became circular.\n\n\n2018–2019: IGTV, removal of the like counter, management changes\nTo comply with the GDPR regulations regarding data portability, Instagram introduced the ability for users to download an archive of their user data in April 2018 [64] [65] [66]\n\n\n2020–present\nIn March 2020, Instagram launched a new feature called \"Co-Watching\" The new feature allows users to share posts with each other over video calls According to Instagram, they pushed forward the launch of Co-Watching in order to meet the demand for virtually connecting with friends and family due to social distancing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic [89]\n\n\nFeatures and tools\nUsers can upload photographs and short videos, follow other users' feeds, [127] and geotag images with the name of a location [128] Users can set their account as \"private\", thereby requiring that they approve any new follower requests [129] Users can connect their Instagram account to other social networking sites, enabling them to share uploaded photos to those sites [130] In September 2011, a new version of the app included new and live filters, instant tilt–shift, high-resolution photographs, optional borders, one-click rotation, and an updated icon [131] [132] Photos were initially restricted to a square, 1:1 aspect ratio; since August 2015, the app supports portrait and widescreen aspect ratios as well [133] [134] [135] Users could formerly view a map of a user's geotagged photos The feature was removed in September 2016, citing low usage [136] [137]\n\n\nHashtags\nIn January 2011, Instagram introduced hashtags to help users discover both photos and each other [154] [155] Instagram encourages users to make tags both specific and relevant, rather than tagging generic words like \"photo\", to make photographs stand out and to attract like-minded Instagram users [156]\n\n\nExplore\nIn June 2012, Instagram introduced \"Explore\", a tab inside the app that displays popular photos, photos taken at nearby locations, and search [163] The tab was updated in June 2015 to feature trending tags and places, curated content, and the ability to search for locations [164] In April 2016, Instagram added a \"Videos You Might Like\" channel to the tab, [165] [166] followed by an \"Events\" channel in August, featuring videos from concerts, sports games, and other live events, [167] [168] followed by the addition of Instagram Stories in October [169] [170] The tab was later expanded again in November 2016 after Instagram Live launched to display an algorithmically curated page of the \"best\" Instagram Live videos currently airing [171] In May 2017, Instagram once again updated the Explore tab to promote public Stories content from nearby places [172]\n\n\nPhotographic filters\nInstagram offers a number of photographic filters that users can apply to their images In February 2012, Instagram added a \"Lux\" filter, an effect that \"lightens shadows, darkens highlights and increases contrast\" [173] [174] In December 2014, Slumber, Crema, Ludwig, Aden, and Perpetua were five new filters added to the Instagram filter family [175]\n\n\nVideo\nInitially a purely photo-sharing service, Instagram incorporated 15-second video sharing in June 2013 [176] [177] The addition was seen by some in the technology media as Facebook's attempt at competing with the then-popular video-sharing application Vine [178] [179] In August 2015, Instagram added support for widescreen videos [180] [181] In March 2016, Instagram increased the 15-second video limit to one minute [182] [183] Albums were introduced in February 2017, which allow up to 10 minutes of video to be shared in one post [146] [147] [184]\n\n\nIGTV\nIGTV was a vertical video application launched by Instagram [185] in June 2018 Basic functionality is also available within the Instagram app and website IGTV allows uploads of up to 10 minutes in length with a file size of up to 650 MB, with verified and popular users allowed to upload videos of up to one hour in length with a file size of up to 5.4 GB [186] The app automatically begins playing videos as soon as it is launched, which CEO Kevin Systrom contrasted to video hosts where one must first locate a video [187] [188] [189] In March 2022, the application was shut down [67]\n\n\nReels\nIn November 2019, it was reported that Instagram had begun to pilot a new video feature known as \"Reels\" in Brazil, expanding to France and Germany afterwards [190] It is similar in functionality to the Chinese video-sharing service TikTok, with a focus on allowing users to record short videos set to pre-existing sound clips from other posts [191] Users could make up to 15 (later 30) second videos using this feature [192] Reels also integrates with existing Instagram filters and editing tools [186]\n\n\nInstagram Direct\nIn December 2013, Instagram announced Instagram Direct, a feature that lets users interact through private messaging (colloquially called \"DM\" OR \"DMs\"; in some regions, the messages may be known simply as \"direct\"/\"directs\") Users who follow each other can send private messages with photos and videos, in contrast to the public-only requirement that was previously in place When users receive a private message from someone they don't follow, the message is marked as pending and the user must accept to see it Users can send a photo to a maximum of 15 people [199] [200] [201] The feature received a major update in September 2015, adding conversation threading and making it possible for users to share locations, hashtag pages, and profiles through private messages directly from the news feed Additionally, users can now reply to private messages with text, emoji or by clicking on a heart icon A camera inside Direct lets users take a photo and send it to the recipient without leaving the conversation [202] [203] [204] A new update in November 2016 let users make their private messages \"disappear\" after being viewed by the recipient, with the sender receiving a notification if the recipient takes a screenshot [205] [206]\n\n\nInstagram Stories\nIn August 2016, Instagram launched Instagram Stories, a feature that allows users to take photos, add effects and layers, and add them to their Instagram story Images uploaded to a user's story expire after 24 hours The media noted the feature's similarities to Snapchat [216] [217] In response to criticism that it copied functionality from Snapchat, CEO Kevin Systrom told Recode that \"Day One: Instagram was a combination of Hipstamatic, Twitter  [and] some stuff from Facebook like the 'Like' button You can trace the roots of every feature anyone has in their app, somewhere in the history of technology\" Although Systrom acknowledged the criticism as \"fair\", Recode wrote that \"he likened the two social apps' common features to the auto industry: Multiple car companies can coexist, with enough differences among them that they serve different consumer audiences\" Systrom further stated that \"When we adopted  [Stories], we decided that one of the really annoying things about the format is that it just kept going and you couldn't pause it to look at something, you couldn't rewind We did all that, we implemented that.\" He also told the publication that Snapchat \"didn't have filters, originally They adopted filters because Instagram had filters and a lot of others were trying to adopt filters as well.\" [218] [219]\n\n\nVerified badges on Instagram\nInstagram introduced the verification feature, known as the blue verified badge, in December 2014 [237] This feature allows users to verify their accounts to confirm their authenticity.\nInstagram began allowing users to request verification for their accounts in August 2018 [238] This marked a significant shift from the previous system where verification was typically initiated by Instagram itself for accounts it deemed to be of public interest or high-profile [239] With the introduction of this feature, eligible users could apply for verification directly through the Instagram app [240]\nThe Instagram blue verified badge is a symbol displayed next to an account's name to signify that the account is authentic, credible, and belongs to a public figure, celebrity, brand, or entity of significant public interest It helps users easily identify legitimate accounts amidst the vast number of profiles on the platform [241] The badge appears as a blue checkmark located next to the account's username in search results, profile pages, and comments.\nObtaining the blue verified badge typically requires meeting certain criteria set by Instagram, such as being notable, authentic, unique, complete, and adhering to the platform's terms of service and community guidelines Instagram verifies accounts based on its own discretion, and not all accounts meeting the criteria may be verified Users can apply for verification through Instagram's settings, but the decision to grant verification ultimately rests with Instagram's team.\nMeta (formerly Facebook) launched paid verification on Instagram in 2021 [242] This allowed eligible Instagram users to request verification for their accounts by paying a fee, [243] rather than relying solely on meeting the platform's traditional criteria for verification [244]\n\n\nAdvertising\nEmily White joined Instagram as Director of Business Operations in April 2013 [245] [246] She said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal in September 2013 that the company should be ready to begin selling advertising by September 2014 as a way to generate business from a popular entity that had not yet created profit for its parent company [247] White left Instagram in December 2013 to join Snapchat [248] [249] In August 2014, James Quarles became Instagram's Global Head of Business and Brand Development, tasked with overseeing advertisement, sales efforts, and developing new \"monetization products\", according to a spokesperson [250]\n\n\nStand-alone apps\nInstagram has developed and released three stand-alone apps with specialized functionality In July 2014, it released Bolt, a messaging app where users click on a friend's profile photo to quickly send an image, with the content disappearing after being seen [275] [276] It was followed by the release of Hyperlapse in August, an iOS-exclusive app that uses \"clever algorithm processing\" to create tracking shots and fast time-lapse videos [277] [278] Microsoft launched a Hyperlapse app for Android and Windows in May 2015, but there has been no official Hyperlapse app from Instagram for either of these platforms to date [279] In October 2015, it released Boomerang, a video app that combines photos into short, one-second videos that play back-and-forth in a loop [280] [281]\n\n\nThird-party services\nThe popularity of Instagram has led to a variety of third-party services designed to integrate with it, including services for creating content to post on the service and generating content from Instagram photos (including physical print-outs), analytics, and alternative clients for platforms with insufficient or no official support from Instagram (such as in the past, iPads) [282] [283]\n\n\nFact-checking\nOn December 16, 2019, Facebook announced it would expand its fact-checking programs towards Instagram, [291] by using third-party fact-checkers organizations false information is able to be identified, reviewed and labeled as false information Content when rated as false or partly false is removed from the explore page and hashtag pages, additionally content rated as false or partly false are labeled as such With the addition of Facebook fact-checking program came the use of image matching technology to find further instances of misinformation If a piece of content is labeled false or partly false on Facebook or Instagram then duplicates of such content will also be labeled as false [292]\n\n\nAlgorithm and design changes\nIn April 2016, Instagram began rolling out a change to the order of photos visible in a user's timeline, shifting from a strictly chronological order to one determined by an algorithm [293] Instagram said the algorithm was designed so that users would see more of the photos by users that they liked, [294] but there was significant negative feedback, with many users asking their followers to turn on post notifications in order to make sure they see updates [295] [296] [297] The company wrote a tweet to users upset at the prospect of the change, but did not back down, [298] nor provide a way to change it back, which they reaffirmed in 2020 [299] [300] However, in December 2021, Adam Mosseri, in a Senate hearing on child safety issues, stated that the company is developing a version of the feed that would show user posts in chronological order [301] He later clarified the company would introduce two modes: a classic chronological feed and a version of it that would let users pick \"favorite\" users whose posts would be shown at the top in chronological order while other posts would be mixed in below [302]\n\n\nMental health\nIn May 2017, a survey conducted by the United Kingdom's Royal Society for Public Health, featuring 1,479 people aged 14–24 and asking them to rate social media platforms depending on anxiety, depression, loneliness, bullying and body image, concluded that Instagram was the \"worst for young mental health\" Some have suggested it may contribute to digital dependence, whilst this same survey noticed its positive effects, including self-expression, self-identity, and community building In response to the survey, Instagram stated that \"Keeping Instagram a safe and supportive place for young people was a top priority\" [414] [415] The company filters out the reviews and accounts If some of the accounts violate Instagram's community guidelines, it will take action, which could include banning them [416]\n\n\nInternal data from Meta\nIn 2021, The Wall Street Journal obtained and published internal research Meta had conducted over several years The leak included presentations that had been seen by the company's executives, and the findings mentioned to CEO Mark Zuckerberg in 2020 [316]\n\n\nDepression, anxiety and stress\nKhodarahimi and Fathi found evidence that Instagram users displayed higher levels of depressive and anxious symptoms compared to non-users [324] However, Frison & Eggermont 2017 found that, among both boys and girls, browsing could predict the presence of depressive symptoms; liking and posting seemed to have no effect [325] In addition, their study showed that the presence of depressive symptoms in a given user could positively predict that they would make posts [325] The study showed that the viewing of celebrity and peer pictures could make the moods of women more negative [325] [326] In a 2021 study, Mun & Kim pointed out that Instagram users with a strong need for approval were more likely to falsely present themselves on their Instagram accounts, which in turn increased the likelihood of depression However, depression was mitigated by the users' perception of their own popularity [327]\n\n\nBody image\nInstagram users report higher body surveillance (the habitual monitoring of one's body shape and size), [335] appearance-related pressure, [336] eating-disorder-related-pathology [337] and lower body satisfaction [337] than non-users Multiple studies have also shown that users who take more selfies before making a post, and those who strategically present themselves by participating in such activities as editing or manipulating selfies, report higher levels of body surveillance and body dissatisfaction, and lower body esteem overall [338] [339] [340] [341] Tiggermann et al showed that facial satisfaction can decrease when one spends greater time editing selfies for Instagram Comments related to appearance on Instagram can lead to higher dissatisfaction with one's body [342] [343] [344] [345]\n\n\nLoneliness and social exclusion\nMackson et al 2019 found that Instagram users were less lonely than non-users [334] and that Instagram membership predicts lower self-reported loneliness [341] A 2021 study by Büttner & Rudertb also showed that not being tagged in an Instagram photo triggers the feeling of social exclusion and ostracism, especially for those with higher needs to belong [346] However, Brailovskaia & Margraf 2018 found a significant positive relationship between Instagram membership and extraversion, life satisfaction, and social support Their study showed only a marginally significant negative association between Instagram membership and self-conscientiousness [347] Fioravanti et al 2020 showed that women who had to take a break from Instagram for seven days reported higher life satisfaction compared to women who continued their habitual pattern of Instagram use The effects seemed to be specific for women, where no significant differences were observed for men [348] The relationship between Instagram use and the fear of missing out, or FOMO, has been confirmed in multiple studies [349] [350] Research shows that Instagram browsing predicts social comparison, which generates FOMO, which can ultimately lead to depression [351]\n\n\nAlcohol and drug use\nThere is a small positive correlation between the intensity of one's Instagram usage and alcohol consumption, with binge drinkers reporting greater intensity of Instagram use than non-binge drinkers [352] Boyle et al 2016 found a small to moderate positive relationship between alcohol consumption, enhanced drinking motives, and drinking behavior during college and Instagram usage, [353]\n\n\nEating disorders\nA comparison of Instagram users with non-users showed that boys with an Instagram account differ from boys without an account in terms of over-evaluation of their shape and weight, skipping meals, and levels of reported disordered eating cognitions Girls with an Instagram account only differed from girls without an account in terms of skipping meals; they also had a stricter exercise schedule, a pattern not found in boys This suggests a possible negative effect of Instagram usage on body satisfaction and disordered eating for both boys and girls [341] [354] Several studies identified a small positive relationship between time spent on Instagram and both internalization of beauty or muscular ideals and self-objectification [341] [355] [356] [357] Both Appel et al 2016 and Feltman et al 2017 found a positive link between the intensity of Instagram use and both body surveillance and dietary behaviors or disordered eating [358] [357]\n\n\nSuicide and self-harm\nPicardo et al 2020 examined the relationship between self-harm posts and actual self-harm behaviours offline and found such content had negative emotional effects on some users The study also reported preliminary evidence of the online posts affecting offline behavior, but stopped short of claiming causality At the same time, some benefits for those who engage with self-harm content online have been suggested [359] Instagram has published resources to help users in need of support [360]\n\n\nSharenting risks\nSharenting is when parents post content online, including images, about their children Instagram is one of the most popular social media channels for sharenting The hashtag #letthembelittle contains over 10 million images related to children on Instagram Bare 2020 analysed 300 randomly selected, publicly available images under the hashtag and found that the corresponding images tended to contain children's personal information, including name, age and location [361]\n\n\nInstagram addiction\nSanz-Blas et al 2019 showed that users who feel that they spend too much time on Instagram report higher levels of \"addiction\" to Instagram, which in turn was related to higher self-reported levels of stress induced by the app [362] In a study focusing on the relationship between various psychological needs and \"addiction\" to Instagram by students, Foroughi et al 2021 found that the desire for recognition and entertainment were predictors of students' addiction to Instagram In addition, the study proved that addiction to Instagram negatively affected academic performance [363] Additionally, Gezgin & Mihci 2020 found that frequent Instagram usage correlated with smartphone addiction [364]\n\n\nUser characteristics and behavior\nFollowing the release in October 2010, Instagram had one million registered users in December 2010 [365] [366] In June 2011, it announced that it had 5 million users, [367] which increased to 10 million in September [368] [369] This growth continued to 30 million users in April 2012, [368] [21] 80 million in July 2012, [370] [371] 100 million in February 2013, [372] [373] 130 million in June 2013, [374] 150 million in September 2013, [375] [376] 300 million in December 2014, [377] [378] 400 million in September 2015, [379] [380] 500 million in June 2016, [381] [382] 600 million in December 2016, [383] [384] 700 million in April 2017, [385] [386] and 800 million in September 2017 [387] [388]\n\n\nUsers\nFollowing the release in October 2010, Instagram had one million registered users in December 2010 [365] [366] In June 2011, it announced that it had 5 million users, [367] which increased to 10 million in September [368] [369] This growth continued to 30 million users in April 2012, [368] [21] 80 million in July 2012, [370] [371] 100 million in February 2013, [372] [373] 130 million in June 2013, [374] 150 million in September 2013, [375] [376] 300 million in December 2014, [377] [378] 400 million in September 2015, [379] [380] 500 million in June 2016, [381] [382] 600 million in December 2016, [383] [384] 700 million in April 2017, [385] [386] and 800 million in September 2017 [387] [388]\n\n\nDemographics\nAs of 2014 [update], Instagram's users are divided equally, with 50% iPhone owners and 50% Android owners While Instagram has a neutral gender-bias format, 68% of Instagram users are female and 32% are male Instagram's geographical use is shown to favor urban areas, as 17% of US adults who live in urban areas use Instagram, while only 11% of adults in suburban and rural areas do so While Instagram may appear to be one of the most widely used sites for photo sharing, only 7% of daily photo uploads, among the top four photo-sharing platforms, come from Instagram Instagram has been proven to attract the younger generation, with 90% of its 150 million users under the age of 35 From June 2012 to June 2013, Instagram approximately doubled their number of users With regards to income, 15% of US Internet users who make less than $30,000 per year use Instagram, while 14% of those making $30,000 to $50,000 and 12% of users who make more than $50,000 per year do so [398] With respect to the education demographic, respondents with some college education proved to be the most active on Instagram, with 23% Following behind, college graduates consist of 18% and users with a high school diploma or less make up 15% Among these Instagram users, 24% say they use the app several times a day [399]\n\n\nUser behavior\nOngoing research continues to explore how media content on the platform affects user engagement Past research has found that media which show people's faces receive more 'likes' and comments and that using filters that increase warmth, exposure, and contrast also boosts engagement [400] Users are more likely to engage with images that depict fewer individuals compared to groups and they are also more likely to engage with content that has not been watermarked, as they view this content as less original and reliable compared to user-generated content [401] Recently Instagram has come up with an option for users to apply for a verified account badge; however, this does not guarantee every user who applies will get the verified blue tick [402]\n\n\nPerformative activism\nIn June 2020, because of the Black Lives Matter movement, Instagram became more widely used as a social justice platform [404] [405] Instagram-based activism (as well as other social media) has been criticized and dismissed for being performative, reductionist, and overly focused on aesthetics [406]\n\n\nReception\nInstagram was the runner-up for \"Best Mobile App\" at the 2010 TechCrunch Crunchies in January 2011 [407] In May 2011, Fast Company listed CEO Kevin Systrom at number 66 in \"The 100 Most Creative People in Business in 2011\" [408] In June 2011, Inc included co-founders Systrom and Krieger in its 2011 \"30 Under 30\" list [10]\n\n\nAwards\nInstagram was the runner-up for \"Best Mobile App\" at the 2010 TechCrunch Crunchies in January 2011 [407] In May 2011, Fast Company listed CEO Kevin Systrom at number 66 in \"The 100 Most Creative People in Business in 2011\" [408] In June 2011, Inc included co-founders Systrom and Krieger in its 2011 \"30 Under 30\" list [10]\n\n\nMental health\nIn May 2017, a survey conducted by the United Kingdom's Royal Society for Public Health, featuring 1,479 people aged 14–24 and asking them to rate social media platforms depending on anxiety, depression, loneliness, bullying and body image, concluded that Instagram was the \"worst for young mental health\" Some have suggested it may contribute to digital dependence, whilst this same survey noticed its positive effects, including self-expression, self-identity, and community building In response to the survey, Instagram stated that \"Keeping Instagram a safe and supportive place for young people was a top priority\" [414] [415] The company filters out the reviews and accounts If some of the accounts violate Instagram's community guidelines, it will take action, which could include banning them [416]\n\n\nNegative comments\nIn response to abusive and negative comments on users' photos, Instagram has made efforts to give users more control over their posts and accompanying comments field In July 2016, it announced that users would be able to turn off comments for their posts, as well as control the language used in comments by inputting words they consider offensive, which will ban applicable comments from showing up [424] [425] After the July 2016 announcement, the ability to ban specific words began rolling out early August to celebrities, [426] followed by regular users in September [427] In December, the company began rolling out the abilities for users to turn off the comments and, for private accounts, remove followers [428] [429]\n\n\nCulture\nOn August 9, 2012, English musician Ellie Goulding released a new music video for her song \"Anything Could Happen\" The video only contained fan-submitted Instagram photographs that used various filters to represent words or lyrics from the song, and over 1,200 different photographs were submitted [437]\n\n\nSecurity\nIn August 2017, reports surfaced that a bug in Instagram's developer tools had allowed \"one or more individuals\" to gain access to the contact information, specifically email addresses and phone numbers, of several high-profile verified accounts, including its most followed user, Selena Gomez The company said in a statement that it had \"fixed the bug swiftly\" and was running an investigation [438] [439] However, the following month, more details emerged, with a group of hackers selling contact information online, with the affected number of accounts in the \"millions\" rather than the previously assumed limitation on verified accounts Hours after the hack, a searchable database was posted online, charging $10 per search [440] The Daily Beast was provided with a sample of the affected accounts and could confirm that, while many of the email addresses could be found with a Google search in public sources, some did not return relevant Google search results and thus were from private sources [441] The Verge wrote that cybersecurity firm RepKnight had found contact information for multiple actors, musicians, and athletes, [440] and singer Selena Gomez's account was used by the hackers to post naked photos of her ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber The company admitted that \"we cannot determine which specific accounts may have been impacted\", but believed that \"it was a low percentage of Instagram accounts\", though TechCrunch stated in its report that six million accounts were affected by the hack, and that \"Instagram services more than 700 million accounts; six million is not a small number\" [442]\n\n\nContent ownership\nOn December 17, 2012, Instagram announced a change to its Terms of Service policy, adding the following sentence: [446]\n\n\nFacebook acquisition as a violation of US antitrust law\nColumbia Law School professor Tim Wu has given public talks explaining that Facebook's 2012 purchase of Instagram was a felony [455] On February 26, 2019, the New York Post released an article stating that the FTC had discovered a memo authored by a senior Facebook official, revealing that the purpose behind the acquisition of Instagram was to remove a potential rival Wu explains this is a violation of US antitrust law (see monopoly) Wu stated that this document was an email directly from Mark Zuckerberg, whereas the Post article had stated that their source had declined to say whether the high-ranking executive was the CEO [456]\n\n\nAlgorithmic advertisement with a rape threat\nIn 2016, Olivia Solon, a reporter for The Guardian, posted a screenshot to her Instagram profile of an email she had received containing threats of rape and murder towards her The photo post had received three likes and countless comments, and in September 2017, the company's algorithms turned the photo into an advertisement visible to Solon's sister An Instagram spokesperson apologized and told The Guardian that \"We are sorry this happened – it's not the experience we want someone to have This notification post was surfaced as part of an effort to encourage engagement on Instagram Posts are generally received by a small percentage of a person's Facebook friends.\" As noted by the technology media, the incident occurred at the same time parent company Facebook was under scrutiny for its algorithms and advertising campaigns being used for offensive and negative purposes [457] [458]\n\n\nHuman exploitation\nIn May 2021, The Washington Post published a report detailing a \"black market\" of unlicensed employment agents luring migrant workers from Africa and Asia into indentured servitude as maids in Persian Gulf countries and using Instagram posts containing their personal information (including in some cases, passport numbers) to market them Instagram deleted 200 accounts that had been reported by the Post, and a spokesperson stated that Instagram took this activity \"extremely seriously\", disabled 200 accounts found by the Post to be engaging in these activities, and was continuing to work on systems to automatically detect and disable accounts engaging in human exploitation [459]\n\n\nJuly 2022 updates\nIn July 2022, Instagram announced a set of updates which immediately received widespread backlash from its userbase The changes included a feed more focused on Instagram's content algorithms, full-screen photo and video posts, and changing the format of all of its videos to Reels The primary criticisms for these updates was that Instagram was more like TikTok than photo sharing The backlash originated from an Instagram post and Change.org petition created by photographer Tati Bruening (under the username @illumitati) on July 23, 2022, featuring the statement \"Make Instagram Instagram again (stop trying to be TikTok; i just want to see cute photos of my friends.) Sincerely, everyone.\" The post and petition gained mainstream attention after influencers Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian reposted the Instagram post; subsequently, the original post gained over 2 million likes on Instagram and over 275,000 signatures on Change.org [460] [461] [462] Instagram walked back the update on July 28, with Meta saying \"We recognize that changes to the app can be an adjustment, and while we believe that Instagram needs to evolve as the world changes, we want to take the time to make sure we get this right.\" [463] Despite repeated attempts by Meta to shape Instagram to appear and operate more like TikTok, user engagement continued to lag far behind its rival as of 2022 [197]\n\n\nPropaganda usage\nInstagram has been used for propaganda purposes by a variety of different countries for different reasons The reasons can be for domestic promotion of certain goals and/or foreign policy objectives [464] During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine Instagram was used for propaganda purposes [465]\n\n\nCensorship and restricted content\nInstagram has been the subject of criticism due to users publishing images of drugs they are selling on the platform In 2013, the BBC discovered that users, mostly located in the United States, were posting images of drugs they were selling, attaching specific hashtags, and then completing transactions via instant messaging applications such as WhatsApp Corresponding hashtags have been blocked as part of the company's response and a spokesperson engaged with the BBC explained: [466] [467]\n\n\nIllicit drugs\nInstagram has been the subject of criticism due to users publishing images of drugs they are selling on the platform In 2013, the BBC discovered that users, mostly located in the United States, were posting images of drugs they were selling, attaching specific hashtags, and then completing transactions via instant messaging applications such as WhatsApp Corresponding hashtags have been blocked as part of the company's response and a spokesperson engaged with the BBC explained: [466] [467]\n\n\nWomen's bodies\nIn October 2013, Instagram deleted the account of Canadian photographer Petra Collins after she posted a photo of herself in which a very small area of pubic hair was visible above the top of her bikini bottom Collins claimed that the account deletion was unfounded because it broke none of Instagram's terms and conditions [470] Audra Schroeder of The Daily Dot further wrote that \"Instagram's terms of use state users can't post 'pornographic or sexually suggestive photos.'\" You can indeed find more sexually suggestive photos on the site than Collins', where women show the side of \"femininity\" the world is \"used to\" seeing and accepting.\" [471] Nick Drewe of The Daily Beast wrote a report the same month focusing on hashtags that users are unable to search for, including #sex, #bubblebutt, and #ballsack, despite allowing #faketits, #gunsforsale and #sexytimes, calling the discrepancy \"nonsensical and inconsistent\" [472]\n\n\nCensorship by countries\nCensorship has occurred in several countries.\n\n\nUnited States\nIn the U.S., there is relatively little government regulation of social media content, with most content removal taking place on a voluntary basis by the companies [479] One exception was in January 2020, when Instagram and its parent company, Facebook, Inc., removed posts \"that voice support for slain Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani to comply with US sanctions\" [480]\n\n\nChina\nInstagram has been blocked by China following the 2014 Hong Kong protests as many confrontations with police and incidents occurring during the protests were recorded and photographed Hong Kong and Macau were not affected as they are part of special administrative regions of China [481]\n\n\nTurkey\nOn August 2, 2024, Instagram was banned by Information and Communication Technologies Authority (Turkey) after the Assassination of Ismail Haniyeh [482] The ban lasted for 9 days and was lifted on August 10, 2024, with Instagram accepting the government's demands and agreeing to work with authorities [483]\n\n\nNorth Korea\nA few days after a fire incident that happened in the Koryo Hotel in North Korea on June 11, 2015, authorities blocked Instagram to prevent photos of the incident from being spread [484]\n\n\nIran\nInstagram was one of the last freely available global social media sites in Iran [485] According to the IFJ, Instagram is popular among Iranians because it is seen as an outlet for freedom and a \"window to the world\" [486]\nStill, Iran has sentenced citizens to prison for posts made on their Instagram accounts [487] The Iranian government blocked Instagram periodically during anti-government protests in 2019-20 [488] In July 2021, Instagram temporarily censored videos with the phrase \"death to Khamenei\" [489]\n\n\nCuba\nThe Cuban government blocked access to several social media platforms, including Instagram, to curb the spread of information during the 2021 Cuban protests [492]\n\n\nRussia\nOn March 11, 2022, Russia announced it would ban Instagram due to alleged \"calls for violence against Russian troops\" on the platform during the ongoing 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine [493] On March 14, the ban took effect, with almost 80 million users losing access to Instagram [494]\n\n\nContent moderation\nLike many social media sites, Instagram employs a combination of automated algorithms, user reports and human review to identify and remove illegal content, such as child abuse and encouragement of terrorism The system also aims to identify cyberbullying, hate speech and misinformation [495]\n\n\nStatistics\nSee also: Most-followed Instagram

It was launched in October 2010 and has since become one of the most popular social media platforms in the world. Instagram has been acquired by Facebook, Inc. (now Meta Platforms) in 2012 for $1 billion. The platform has over 1 billion active users and has become a key platform for businesses, celebrities, and individuals to showcase their content.\n\n**History**\n\nInstagram began development in San Francisco as Burbn, a mobile check-in app created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger. On March 5, 2010, Systrom closed a $500,000 seed funding round with Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz while working on Burbn.\n\nThe company realized that it was too similar to Foursquare, and they refocused their app on photo-sharing, which had become a popular feature among its users. They renamed it Instagram, a portmanteau of instant camera and telegram.\n\n**2010-2011: Beginnings and Major Funding**\n\nIn 2010, Instagram launched with 12 employees and a $500,000 seed funding round. In October 2010, Instagram had one million registered users. In June 2011, it announced that it had 5 million users, which increased to 10 million in September.\n\n**2012-2014: Acquisition and Android App**\n\nOn April 3, 2012, Instagram released a version of its app for Android phones, which was downloaded more than one million times in less than one day.\n\nIn August 2012, Facebook, Inc. (now Meta Platforms) announced that it would acquire Instagram for $1 billion in cash and stock. The acquisition was approved by the Federal Trade Commission on August 22, 2012.\n\nIn March 2014, Instagram updated its Android app, cutting the file size of the app by half and adding performance improvements.\n\n**2015-2017: Redesign and Windows App**\n\nIn June 2015, Instagram released a redesigned version of its website, with a new layout and interface. The redesign made it easier for users to view and interact with content on the platform.\n\nIn May 2015, Microsoft launched a Hyperlapse app for Android and Windows, which used \"clever algorithm processing\" to create tracking shots and fast time-lapse videos.\n\n**2018-2019: IGTV, Removal of the Like Counter, and Verification**\n\nIn June 2018, Instagram launched IGTV, a vertical video application that allowed users to upload videos up to 60 minutes in length.\n\nIn July 2018, Instagram announced that it would remove the like counter from its app, in an effort to reduce the pressure on users to curate their content based on the number of likes they receive.\n\nIn August 2018, Instagram introduced the ability for users to request verification for their accounts, allowing users to apply for a verified badge.\n\n**2020-Present**\n\nIn March 2020, Instagram launched Co-Watching, a feature that allows users to share posts with each other over video calls.\n\nIn July 2022, Instagram announced a set of updates, including a feed more focused on Instagram's content algorithms, full-screen photo and video posts, and changing the format of all of its videos to Reels.\n\n**Algorithm**\n\nInstagram's algorithm is a complex system that determines which content to display to users. The algorithm takes into account a variety of factors, including the user's interests, engagement, and interactions with content.\n\n**Content Moderation**\n\nInstagram employs a combination of automated algorithms, user reports, and human review to identify and remove illegal content, such as child abuse and encouragement of terrorism.\n\n**Statistics**\n\nInstagram has over 1 billion active users, and its users spend an average of 53 minutes per day on the platform.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nInstagram has become a key platform for businesses, celebrities, and individuals to showcase their content.\n\n**System**\n\nInstagram is written in Python, and its system is designed to handle a large volume of data and user interactions.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Most-followed Instagram

Burbn, a mobile check-in app created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger On March 5, 2010, Systrom closed a $500,000 (equivalent to $682,200 in 2023) seed funding round with Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz while working on Burbn [10] [11] Realizing that it was too similar to Foursquare, they refocused their app on photo-sharing, which had become a popular feature among its users [12] [13] They renamed it Instagram, a portmanteau of instant camera and telegram [14]\n\n\n2010–2011: Beginnings and major funding\nJosh Riedel joined the company in October as Community Manager, [15] Shayne Sweeney joined in November as an engineer, [15] and Jessica Zollman joined as a Community Evangelist in August 2011 [15] [16]\n\n\n2012–2014: Additional platforms and acquisition by Facebook\nOn April 3, 2012, Instagram released a version of its app for Android phones, [21] [22] and it was downloaded more than one million times in less than one day [23] The Android app has since received two significant updates: first, in March 2014, which cut the file size of the app by half and added performance improvements; [24] [25] then in April 2017, to add an offline mode that allows users to view and interact with content without an Internet connection At the time of the announcement, it was reported that 80% of Instagram's 600 million users were located outside the U.S., and while the aforementioned functionality was live at its announcement, Instagram also announced its intention to make more features available offline, and that they were \"exploring an iOS version\" On April 9, 2012, Facebook, Inc (now Meta Platforms) bought Instagram for $1 billion (equivalent to $1,312,000,000 in 2023) in cash and stock, [26] [27] [28] with a plan to keep the company independently managed [29] [30] [31] Britain's Office of Fair Trading approved the deal on August 14, 2012, [32] and on August 22, 2012, the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S closed its investigation, allowing the deal to proceed [33] On September 6, 2012, the deal between Instagram and Facebook officially closed with a purchase price of $300 million in cash and 23 million shares of stock [34]\n\n\n2015–2017: Redesign and Windows app\nIn June 2015, the desktop website user interface was redesigned to become more flat and minimalistic, but with more screen space for each photo and to resemble the layout of Instagram's mobile website [40] [41] [42] Furthermore, one row of pictures only has three instead of five photos to match the mobile layout The slideshow banner [43] [44] on the top of profile pages, which simultaneously slide-showed seven picture tiles of pictures posted by the user, alternating at different times in a random order, has been removed In addition, the formerly angular profile pictures became circular.\n\n\n2018–2019: IGTV, removal of the like counter, management changes\nTo comply with the GDPR regulations regarding data portability, Instagram introduced the ability for users to download an archive of their user data in April 2018 [64] [65] [66]\n\n\n2020–present\nIn March 2020, Instagram launched a new feature called \"Co-Watching\" The new feature allows users to share posts with each other over video calls According to Instagram, they pushed forward the launch of Co-Watching in order to meet the demand for virtually connecting with friends and family due to social distancing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic [89]\n\n\nFeatures and tools\nUsers can upload photographs and short videos, follow other users' feeds, [127] and geotag images with the name of a location [128] Users can set their account as \"private\", thereby requiring that they approve any new follower requests [129] Users can connect their Instagram account to other social networking sites, enabling them to share uploaded photos to those sites [130] In September 2011, a new version of the app included new and live filters, instant tilt–shift, high-resolution photographs, optional borders, one-click rotation, and an updated icon [131] [132] Photos were initially restricted to a square, 1:1 aspect ratio; since August 2015, the app supports portrait and widescreen aspect ratios as well [133] [134] [135] Users could formerly view a map of a user's geotagged photos The feature was removed in September 2016, citing low usage [136] [137]\n\n\nHashtags\nIn January 2011, Instagram introduced hashtags to help users discover both photos and each other [154] [155] Instagram encourages users to make tags both specific and relevant, rather than tagging generic words like \"photo\", to make photographs stand out and to attract like-minded Instagram users [156]\n\n\nExplore\nIn June 2012, Instagram introduced \"Explore\", a tab inside the app that displays popular photos, photos taken at nearby locations, and search [163] The tab was updated in June 2015 to feature trending tags and places, curated content, and the ability to search for locations [164] In April 2016, Instagram added a \"Videos You Might Like\" channel to the tab, [165] [166] followed by an \"Events\" channel in August, featuring videos from concerts, sports games, and other live events, [167] [168] followed by the addition of Instagram Stories in October [169] [170] The tab was later expanded again in November 2016 after Instagram Live launched to display an algorithmically curated page of the \"best\" Instagram Live videos currently airing [171] In May 2017, Instagram once again updated the Explore tab to promote public Stories content from nearby places [172]\n\n\nPhotographic filters\nInstagram offers a number of photographic filters that users can apply to their images In February 2012, Instagram added a \"Lux\" filter, an effect that \"lightens shadows, darkens highlights and increases contrast\" [173] [174] In December 2014, Slumber, Crema, Ludwig, Aden, and Perpetua were five new filters added to the Instagram filter family [175]\n\n\nVideo\nInitially a purely photo-sharing service, Instagram incorporated 15-second video sharing in June 2013 [176] [177] The addition was seen by some in the technology media as Facebook's attempt at competing with the then-popular video-sharing application Vine [178] [179] In August 2015, Instagram added support for widescreen videos [180] [181] In March 2016, Instagram increased the 15-second video limit to one minute [182] [183] Albums were introduced in February 2017, which allow up to 10 minutes of video to be shared in one post [146] [147] [184]\n\n\nIGTV\nIGTV was a vertical video application launched by Instagram [185] in June 2018 Basic functionality is also available within the Instagram app and website IGTV allows uploads of up to 10 minutes in length with a file size of up to 650 MB, with verified and popular users allowed to upload videos of up to one hour in length with a file size of up to 5.4 GB [186] The app automatically begins playing videos as soon as it is launched, which CEO Kevin Systrom contrasted to video hosts where one must first locate a video [187] [188] [189] In March 2022, the application was shut down [67]\n\n\nReels\nIn November 2019, it was reported that Instagram had begun to pilot a new video feature known as \"Reels\" in Brazil, expanding to France and Germany afterwards [190] It is similar in functionality to the Chinese video-sharing service TikTok, with a focus on allowing users to record short videos set to pre-existing sound clips from other posts [191] Users could make up to 15 (later 30) second videos using this feature [192] Reels also integrates with existing Instagram filters and editing tools [186]\n\n\nInstagram Direct\nIn December 2013, Instagram announced Instagram Direct, a feature that lets users interact through private messaging (colloquially called \"DM\" OR \"DMs\"; in some regions, the messages may be known simply as \"direct\"/\"directs\") Users who follow each other can send private messages with photos and videos, in contrast to the public-only requirement that was previously in place When users receive a private message from someone they don't follow, the message is marked as pending and the user must accept to see it Users can send a photo to a maximum of 15 people [199] [200] [201] The feature received a major update in September 2015, adding conversation threading and making it possible for users to share locations, hashtag pages, and profiles through private messages directly from the news feed Additionally, users can now reply to private messages with text, emoji or by clicking on a heart icon A camera inside Direct lets users take a photo and send it to the recipient without leaving the conversation [202] [203] [204] A new update in November 2016 let users make their private messages \"disappear\" after being viewed by the recipient, with the sender receiving a notification if the recipient takes a screenshot [205] [206]\n\n\nInstagram Stories\nIn August 2016, Instagram launched Instagram Stories, a feature that allows users to take photos, add effects and layers, and add them to their Instagram story Images uploaded to a user's story expire after 24 hours The media noted the feature's similarities to Snapchat [216] [217] In response to criticism that it copied functionality from Snapchat, CEO Kevin Systrom told Recode that \"Day One: Instagram was a combination of Hipstamatic, Twitter  [and] some stuff from Facebook like the 'Like' button You can trace the roots of every feature anyone has in their app, somewhere in the history of technology\" Although Systrom acknowledged the criticism as \"fair\", Recode wrote that \"he likened the two social apps' common features to the auto industry: Multiple car companies can coexist, with enough differences among them that they serve different consumer audiences\" Systrom further stated that \"When we adopted  [Stories], we decided that one of the really annoying things about the format is that it just kept going and you couldn't pause it to look at something, you couldn't rewind We did all that, we implemented that.\" He also told the publication that Snapchat \"didn't have filters, originally They adopted filters because Instagram had filters and a lot of others were trying to adopt filters as well.\" [218] [219]\n\n\nVerified badges on Instagram\nInstagram introduced the verification feature, known as the blue verified badge, in December 2014 [237] This feature allows users to verify their accounts to confirm their authenticity.\nInstagram began allowing users to request verification for their accounts in August 2018 [238] This marked a significant shift from the previous system where verification was typically initiated by Instagram itself for accounts it deemed to be of public interest or high-profile [239] With the introduction of this feature, eligible users could apply for verification directly through the Instagram app [240]\nThe Instagram blue verified badge is a symbol displayed next to an account's name to signify that the account is authentic, credible, and belongs to a public figure, celebrity, brand, or entity of significant public interest It helps users easily identify legitimate accounts amidst the vast number of profiles on the platform [241] The badge appears as a blue checkmark located next to the account's username in search results, profile pages, and comments.\nObtaining the blue verified badge typically requires meeting certain criteria set by Instagram, such as being notable, authentic, unique, complete, and adhering to the platform's terms of service and community guidelines Instagram verifies accounts based on its own discretion, and not all accounts meeting the criteria may be verified Users can apply for verification through Instagram's settings, but the decision to grant verification ultimately rests with Instagram's team.\nMeta (formerly Facebook) launched paid verification on Instagram in 2021 [242] This allowed eligible Instagram users to request verification for their accounts by paying a fee, [243] rather than relying solely on meeting the platform's traditional criteria for verification [244]\n\n\nAdvertising\nEmily White joined Instagram as Director of Business Operations in April 2013 [245] [246] She said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal in September 2013 that the company should be ready to begin selling advertising by September 2014 as a way to generate business from a popular entity that had not yet created profit for its parent company [247] White left Instagram in December 2013 to join Snapchat [248] [249] In August 2014, James Quarles became Instagram's Global Head of Business and Brand Development, tasked with overseeing advertisement, sales efforts, and developing new \"monetization products\", according to a spokesperson [250]\n\n\nStand-alone apps\nInstagram has developed and released three stand-alone apps with specialized functionality In July 2014, it released Bolt, a messaging app where users click on a friend's profile photo to quickly send an image, with the content disappearing after being seen [275] [276] It was followed by the release of Hyperlapse in August, an iOS-exclusive app that uses \"clever algorithm processing\" to create tracking shots and fast time-lapse videos [277] [278] Microsoft launched a Hyperlapse app for Android and Windows in May 2015, but there has been no official Hyperlapse app from Instagram for either of these platforms to date [279] In October 2015, it released Boomerang, a video app that combines photos into short, one-second videos that play back-and-forth in a loop [280] [281]\n\n\nThird-party services\nThe popularity of Instagram has led to a variety of third-party services designed to integrate with it, including services for creating content to post on the service and generating content from Instagram photos (including physical print-outs), analytics, and alternative clients for platforms with insufficient or no official support from Instagram (such as in the past, iPads) [282] [283]\n\n\nFact-checking\nOn December 16, 2019, Facebook announced it would expand its fact-checking programs towards Instagram, [291] by using third-party fact-checkers organizations false information is able to be identified, reviewed and labeled as false information Content when rated as false or partly false is removed from the explore page and hashtag pages, additionally content rated as false or partly false are labeled as such With the addition of Facebook fact-checking program came the use of image matching technology to find further instances of misinformation If a piece of content is labeled false or partly false on Facebook or Instagram then duplicates of such content will also be labeled as false [292]\n\n\nAlgorithm and design changes\nIn April 2016, Instagram began rolling out a change to the order of photos visible in a user's timeline, shifting from a strictly chronological order to one determined by an algorithm [293] Instagram said the algorithm was designed so that users would see more of the photos by users that they liked, [294] but there was significant negative feedback, with many users asking their followers to turn on post notifications in order to make sure they see updates [295] [296] [297] The company wrote a tweet to users upset at the prospect of the change, but did not back down, [298] nor provide a way to change it back, which they reaffirmed in 2020 [299] [300] However, in December 2021, Adam Mosseri, in a Senate hearing on child safety issues, stated that the company is developing a version of the feed that would show user posts in chronological order [301] He later clarified the company would introduce two modes: a classic chronological feed and a version of it that would let users pick \"favorite\" users whose posts would be shown at the top in chronological order while other posts would be mixed in below [302]\n\n\nMental health\nIn May 2017, a survey conducted by the United Kingdom's Royal Society for Public Health, featuring 1,479 people aged 14–24 and asking them to rate social media platforms depending on anxiety, depression, loneliness, bullying and body image, concluded that Instagram was the \"worst for young mental health\" Some have suggested it may contribute to digital dependence, whilst this same survey noticed its positive effects, including self-expression, self-identity, and community building In response to the survey, Instagram stated that \"Keeping Instagram a safe and supportive place for young people was a top priority\" [414] [415] The company filters out the reviews and accounts If some of the accounts violate Instagram's community guidelines, it will take action, which could include banning them [416]\n\n\nInternal data from Meta\nIn 2021, The Wall Street Journal obtained and published internal research Meta had conducted over several years The leak included presentations that had been seen by the company's executives, and the findings mentioned to CEO Mark Zuckerberg in 2020 [316]\n\n\nDepression, anxiety and stress\nKhodarahimi and Fathi found evidence that Instagram users displayed higher levels of depressive and anxious symptoms compared to non-users [324] However, Frison & Eggermont 2017 found that, among both boys and girls, browsing could predict the presence of depressive symptoms; liking and posting seemed to have no effect [325] In addition, their study showed that the presence of depressive symptoms in a given user could positively predict that they would make posts [325] The study showed that the viewing of celebrity and peer pictures could make the moods of women more negative [325] [326] In a 2021 study, Mun & Kim pointed out that Instagram users with a strong need for approval were more likely to falsely present themselves on their Instagram accounts, which in turn increased the likelihood of depression However, depression was mitigated by the users' perception of their own popularity [327]\n\n\nBody image\nInstagram users report higher body surveillance (the habitual monitoring of one's body shape and size), [335] appearance-related pressure, [336] eating-disorder-related-pathology [337] and lower body satisfaction [337] than non-users Multiple studies have also shown that users who take more selfies before making a post, and those who strategically present themselves by participating in such activities as editing or manipulating selfies, report higher levels of body surveillance and body dissatisfaction, and lower body esteem overall [338] [339] [340] [341] Tiggermann et al showed that facial satisfaction can decrease when one spends greater time editing selfies for Instagram Comments related to appearance on Instagram can lead to higher dissatisfaction with one's body [342] [343] [344] [345]\n\n\nLoneliness and social exclusion\nMackson et al 2019 found that Instagram users were less lonely than non-users [334] and that Instagram membership predicts lower self-reported loneliness [341] A 2021 study by Büttner & Rudertb also showed that not being tagged in an Instagram photo triggers the feeling of social exclusion and ostracism, especially for those with higher needs to belong [346] However, Brailovskaia & Margraf 2018 found a significant positive relationship between Instagram membership and extraversion, life satisfaction, and social support Their study showed only a marginally significant negative association between Instagram membership and self-conscientiousness [347] Fioravanti et al 2020 showed that women who had to take a break from Instagram for seven days reported higher life satisfaction compared to women who continued their habitual pattern of Instagram use The effects seemed to be specific for women, where no significant differences were observed for men [348] The relationship between Instagram use and the fear of missing out, or FOMO, has been confirmed in multiple studies [349] [350] Research shows that Instagram browsing predicts social comparison, which generates FOMO, which can ultimately lead to depression [351]\n\n\nAlcohol and drug use\nThere is a small positive correlation between the intensity of one's Instagram usage and alcohol consumption, with binge drinkers reporting greater intensity of Instagram use than non-binge drinkers [352] Boyle et al 2016 found a small to moderate positive relationship between alcohol consumption, enhanced drinking motives, and drinking behavior during college and Instagram usage, [353]\n\n\nEating disorders\nA comparison of Instagram users with non-users showed that boys with an Instagram account differ from boys without an account in terms of over-evaluation of their shape and weight, skipping meals, and levels of reported disordered eating cognitions Girls with an Instagram account only differed from girls without an account in terms of skipping meals; they also had a stricter exercise schedule, a pattern not found in boys This suggests a possible negative effect of Instagram usage on body satisfaction and disordered eating for both boys and girls [341] [354] Several studies identified a small positive relationship between time spent on Instagram and both internalization of beauty or muscular ideals and self-objectification [341] [355] [356] [357] Both Appel et al 2016 and Feltman et al 2017 found a positive link between the intensity of Instagram use and both body surveillance and dietary behaviors or disordered eating [358] [357]\n\n\nSuicide and self-harm\nPicardo et al 2020 examined the relationship between self-harm posts and actual self-harm behaviours offline and found such content had negative emotional effects on some users The study also reported preliminary evidence of the online posts affecting offline behavior, but stopped short of claiming causality At the same time, some benefits for those who engage with self-harm content online have been suggested [359] Instagram has published resources to help users in need of support [360]\n\n\nSharenting risks\nSharenting is when parents post content online, including images, about their children Instagram is one of the most popular social media channels for sharenting The hashtag #letthembelittle contains over 10 million images related to children on Instagram Bare 2020 analysed 300 randomly selected, publicly available images under the hashtag and found that the corresponding images tended to contain children's personal information, including name, age and location [361]\n\n\nInstagram addiction\nSanz-Blas et al 2019 showed that users who feel that they spend too much time on Instagram report higher levels of \"addiction\" to Instagram, which in turn was related to higher self-reported levels of stress induced by the app [362] In a study focusing on the relationship between various psychological needs and \"addiction\" to Instagram by students, Foroughi et al 2021 found that the desire for recognition and entertainment were predictors of students' addiction to Instagram In addition, the study proved that addiction to

users in December 2010 [365] [366] In June 2011, it announced that it had 5 million users, [367] which increased to 10 million in September [368] [369] This growth continued to 30 million users in

September 2017 [387] [388]\n\n\nDemographics\nAs of 2014 [update], Instagram's users are divided equally, with 50% iPhone owners and 50% Android owners While Instagram has a neutral gender-bias format, 68% of Instagram users are female and 32% are male Instagram's geographical use is shown to favor urban areas, as 17% of US adults who live in urban areas use Instagram, while only 11% of adults in suburban and rural areas do so While Instagram may appear to be one of the most widely used sites for photo sharing, only 7% of daily photo uploads, among the top four photo-sharing platforms, come from Instagram Instagram has been proven to attract the younger generation, with 90% of its 150 million users under the age of 35 From June 2012 to June 2013, Instagram approximately doubled their number of users With regards to income, 15% of US Internet users who make less than $30,000 per year use Instagram, while 14% of those making $30,000 to $50,000 and 12% of users who make more than $50,000 per year do so [398] With respect to the education demographic, respondents with some college education proved to be the most active on Instagram, with 23% Following behind, college graduates consist of 18% and users with a high school diploma or less make up 15% Among these Instagram users, 24% say they use the app several times a day [399]\n\n\nUser behavior\nOngoing research continues to explore how media content on the platform affects user engagement Past research has found that media which show people's faces receive more 'likes' and comments and that using filters that increase warmth, exposure, and contrast also boosts engagement [400] Users are more likely to engage with images that depict fewer individuals compared to groups and they are also more likely to engage with content that has not been watermarked, as they view this content as less original and reliable compared to user-generated content [401] Recently Instagram has come up with an option for users to apply for a verified account badge; however, this does not guarantee every user who applies will get the verified blue tick [402]\n\n\nPerformative activism\nIn June 2020, because of the Black Lives Matter movement, Instagram became more widely used as a social justice platform [404] [405] Instagram-based activism (as well as other social media) has been criticized and dismissed for being performative, reductionist, and overly focused on aesthetics [406]\n\n\nReception\nInstagram was the runner-up for \"Best Mobile App\" at the 2010 TechCrunch Crunchies in January 2011 [407] In May 2011, Fast Company listed CEO Kevin Systrom at number 66 in \"The 100 Most Creative People in Business in 2011\" [408] In June 2011, Inc included co-founders Systrom and Krieger in its 2011 \"30

number 66 in \"The 100 Most Creative People in Business in 2011\" [408] In June 2011, Inc included co-founders Systrom and Krieger in its 2011 \"30 Under 30\" list [10]\n\n\nMental health\nIn May 2017, a survey conducted by the United Kingdom's Royal Society for Public Health, featuring 1,479 people aged 14–24 and asking them to rate social media platforms depending on anxiety, depression, loneliness, bullying and body image, concluded that Instagram was the \"worst for young mental health\" Some have suggested it may contribute to digital dependence, whilst this same survey noticed its positive effects, including self-expression, self-identity, and community building In response to the survey, Instagram stated that \"Keeping Instagram a safe and supportive place for young people was a top priority\" [414] [415] The company filters out the reviews and accounts If some of the accounts violate Instagram's community guidelines, it will take action, which could include banning them [416]\n\n\nNegative comments\nIn response to abusive and negative comments on users' photos, Instagram has made efforts to give users more control over their posts and accompanying comments field In July 2016, it announced that users would be able to turn off comments for their posts, as well as control the language used in comments by inputting words they consider offensive, which will ban applicable comments from showing up [424] [425] After the July 2016 announcement, the ability to ban specific words began rolling out early August to celebrities, [426] followed by regular users in September [427] In December, the company began rolling out the abilities for users to turn off the comments and, for private accounts, remove followers [428] [429]\n\n\nCulture\nOn August 9, 2012, English musician Ellie Goulding released a new music video for her song \"Anything Could Happen\" The video only contained fan-submitted Instagram photographs that used various filters to represent words or lyrics from the song, and over 1,200 different photographs were submitted [437]\n\n\nSecurity\nIn August 2017, reports surfaced that a bug in Instagram's developer tools had allowed \"one or more individuals\" to gain access to the contact information, specifically email addresses and phone numbers, of several high-profile verified accounts, including its most followed user, Selena Gomez The company said in a statement that it had \"fixed the bug swiftly\" and was running an investigation [438] [439] However, the following month, more details emerged, with a group of hackers selling contact information online, with the affected number of accounts in the \"millions\" rather than the previously assumed limitation on verified accounts Hours after the hack, a searchable database was posted online, charging $10 per search [440] The Daily Beast was provided with a sample of the affected accounts and could confirm that, while many of the email addresses could be found with a Google search in public sources, some did not return relevant Google search results and thus were from private sources [441] The Verge wrote that cybersecurity firm RepKnight had found contact information for multiple actors, musicians, and athletes, [440] and singer Selena Gomez's account was used by the hackers to post naked photos of her ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber The company admitted that \"we cannot determine which specific accounts may have been impacted\", but believed that \"it was a low percentage of Instagram accounts\", though TechCrunch stated in its report that six million accounts were affected by the hack, and that \"Instagram services more than 700 million accounts; six million is not a small number\" [442]\n\n\nContent ownership\nOn December 17, 2012, Instagram announced a change to its Terms of Service policy, adding the following sentence: [446]\n\n\nFacebook acquisition as a violation of US antitrust law\nColumbia Law School professor Tim Wu has given public talks explaining that Facebook's 2012 purchase of Instagram was a felony [455] On February 26, 2019, the New York Post released an article stating that the FTC had discovered a memo authored by a senior Facebook official, revealing that the purpose behind the acquisition of Instagram was to remove a potential rival Wu explains this is a violation of US antitrust law (see monopoly) Wu stated that this document was an email directly from Mark Zuckerberg, whereas the Post article had stated that their source had declined to say whether the high-ranking executive was the CEO [456]\n\n\nAlgorithmic advertisement with a rape threat\nIn 2016, Olivia Solon, a reporter for The Guardian, posted a screenshot to her Instagram profile of an email she had received containing threats of rape and murder towards her The photo post had received three likes and countless comments, and in September 2017, the company's algorithms turned the photo into an advertisement visible to Solon's sister An Instagram spokesperson apologized and told The Guardian that \"We are sorry this happened – it's not the experience we want someone to have This notification post was surfaced as part of an effort to encourage engagement on Instagram Posts are generally received by a small percentage of a person's Facebook friends.\" As noted by the technology media, the incident occurred at the same time parent company Facebook was under scrutiny for its algorithms and advertising campaigns being used for offensive and negative purposes [457] [458]\n\n\nHuman exploitation\nIn May 2021, The Washington Post published a report detailing a \"black market\" of unlicensed employment agents luring migrant workers from Africa and Asia into indentured servitude as maids in Persian Gulf countries and using Instagram posts containing their personal information (including in some cases, passport numbers) to market them Instagram deleted 200 accounts that had been reported by the Post, and a spokesperson stated that Instagram took this activity \"extremely seriously\", disabled 200 accounts found by the Post to be engaging in these activities, and was continuing to work on systems to automatically detect and disable accounts engaging in human exploitation [459]\n\n\nJuly 2022 updates\nIn July 2022, Instagram announced a set of updates which immediately received widespread backlash from its userbase The changes included a feed more focused on Instagram's content algorithms, full-screen photo and video posts, and changing the format of all of its videos to Reels The primary criticisms for these updates was that Instagram was more like TikTok than photo sharing The backlash originated from an Instagram post and Change.org petition created by photographer Tati Bruening (under the username @illumitati) on July 23, 2022, featuring the statement \"Make Instagram Instagram again (stop trying to be TikTok; i just want to see cute photos of my friends.) Sincerely, everyone.\" The post and petition gained mainstream attention after influencers Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian reposted the Instagram post; subsequently, the original post gained over 2 million likes on Instagram and over 275,000 signatures on Change.org [460] [461] [462] Instagram walked back the update on July 28, with Meta saying \"We recognize that changes to the app can be an adjustment, and while we believe that Instagram needs to evolve as the world changes, we want to take the time to make sure we get this right.\" [463] Despite repeated attempts by Meta to shape Instagram to appear and operate more like TikTok, user engagement continued to lag far behind its rival as of 2022 [197]\n\n\nPropaganda usage\nInstagram has been used for propaganda purposes by a variety of different countries for different reasons The reasons can be for domestic promotion of certain goals and/or foreign policy objectives [464] During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine Instagram was used for propaganda purposes [465]\n\n\nCensorship and restricted content\nInstagram has been the subject of criticism due to users publishing images of drugs they are selling on the platform In 2013, the BBC discovered that users, mostly located in the United States, were posting images of drugs they were selling, attaching specific hashtags, and then completing transactions via instant messaging applications such as WhatsApp Corresponding hashtags have been blocked as part of the company's response and a spokesperson engaged with the BBC explained: [466] [467]\n\n\nIllicit drugs\nInstagram has been the subject of criticism due to users publishing images of drugs they are selling on the platform In 2013, the BBC discovered that users, mostly located in the United States, were posting images of drugs they were selling, attaching specific hashtags, and then completing transactions via instant messaging applications such as WhatsApp Corresponding hashtags have been blocked as part of the company's response and a spokesperson engaged with the BBC explained: [466] [467]\n\n\nWomen's bodies\nIn October 2013, Instagram deleted the account of Canadian photographer Petra Collins after she posted a photo of herself in which a very small area of pubic hair was visible above the top of her bikini bottom Collins claimed that the account deletion was unfounded because it broke none of Instagram's terms and conditions [470] Audra Schroeder of The Daily Dot further wrote that \"Instagram's terms of use state users can't post 'pornographic or sexually suggestive photos.'\" You can indeed find more sexually suggestive photos on the site than Collins', where women show the side of \"femininity\" the world is \"used to\" seeing and accepting.\" [471] Nick Drewe of The Daily Beast wrote a report the same month focusing on hashtags that users are unable to search for, including #sex, #bubblebutt, and #ballsack, despite allowing #faketits, #gunsforsale and #sexytimes, calling the discrepancy \"nonsensical and inconsistent\" [472]\n\n\nCensorship by countries\nCensorship has occurred in several countries.\n\n\nUnited States\nIn the U.S., there is relatively little government regulation of social media content, with most content removal taking place on a voluntary basis by the companies [479] One exception was in January 2020, when Instagram and its parent company, Facebook, Inc., removed posts \"that voice support for slain Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani to comply with US sanctions\" [480]\n\n\nChina\nInstagram has been blocked by China following the 2014 Hong Kong protests as many confrontations with police and incidents occurring during the protests were recorded and photographed Hong Kong and Macau were not affected as they are part of special administrative regions of China [481]\n\n\nTurkey\nOn August 2, 2024, Instagram was banned by Information and Communication Technologies Authority (Turkey) after the Assassination of Ismail Haniyeh [482] The ban lasted for 9 days and was lifted on August 10, 2024, with Instagram accepting the government's demands and agreeing to work with authorities [483]\n\n\nNorth Korea\nA few days after a fire incident that happened in the Koryo Hotel in North Korea on June 11, 2015, authorities blocked Instagram to prevent photos of the incident from being spread [484]\n\n\nIran\nInstagram was one of the last freely available global social media sites in Iran [485] According to the IFJ, Instagram is popular among Iranians because it is seen as an outlet for freedom and a \"window to the world\" [486]\nStill, Iran has sentenced citizens to prison for posts made on their Instagram accounts [487] The Iranian government blocked Instagram periodically during anti-government protests in 2019-20 [488] In July 2021, Instagram temporarily censored videos with the phrase \"death to Khamenei\" [489]\n\n\nCuba\nThe Cuban government blocked access to several social media platforms, including Instagram, to curb the spread of information during the 2021 Cuban protests [492]\n\n\nRussia\nOn March 11, 2022, Russia announced it would ban Instagram due to alleged \"calls for violence against Russian troops\" on the platform during the ongoing 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine [493] On March 14, the ban took effect, with almost 80 million users losing access to Instagram [494]\n\n\nContent moderation\nLike many social media sites, Instagram employs a combination of automated algorithms, user reports and human review to identify and remove illegal content, such as child abuse and encouragement of terrorism The system also aims to identify cyberbullying, hate speech and misinformation [495]\n\n\nStatistics\nSee also: Most-followed Instagram

a child Lee had his first role as a baby who was carried onto the stage in the film Golden Gate Girl [19] He took his Chinese stage name as 李小龍, lit Lee the Little Dragon, for the fact that he was

[20]\n\n\n1959–1964: Continuous studies and martial arts breakthrough\nIn his late teens, Lee's street fights became more frequent and included beating the son of a feared triad family [38] In 1958, after students from a rival Choy Li Fut martial arts school challenged Lee's Wing Chun school, he engaged in a fight on a rooftop In response to an unfair punch by another boy, he beat him so badly that he knocked out one of his teeth, leading to the boy's parents making a complaint to the police [39]\n\n\n1966–1970: American roles and creating Jeet Kune Do\nFrom 1966 to 1967, Lee played the role of Kato alongside the title character played by Van Williams in the TV series produced and narrated by William Dozier [56] titled The Green Hornet, based on the radio show by the same name [57] [55] The show ran for one season (26 episodes) from September 1966 to March 1967 Lee and Williams also appeared as their characters in three crossover episodes of Batman, another William Dozier-produced television series [58] [59] [60]\n\n\n1971–1973: Hong Kong films and Hollywood breakthrough\nIn 1971, Lee appeared in four episodes of the television series Longstreet, written by Silliphant Lee played Li Tsung, the martial arts instructor of the title character Mike Longstreet, played by James Franciscus, and important aspects of his martial arts philosophy were written into the script [74] [75] According to statements made by Lee, and also by Linda Lee Cadwell after Lee's death, Lee pitched a television series of his own in 1971, tentatively titled The Warrior, discussions of which were confirmed by Warner Bros During a December 9, 1971, television interview on The Pierre Berton Show, Lee stated that both Paramount and Warner Bros wanted him \"to be in a modernized type of a thing and that they think the Western idea is out, whereas I want to do the Western\" [76]\n\n\n1978–present: Posthumous work\nRobert Clouse, the director of Enter the Dragon,

work on Enter the Dragon In addition to Abdul-Jabbar, George Lazenby, Hapkido master Ji Han-jae, and another of Lee's students, Dan Inosanto, appeared in the film, which culminated in Lee's character, Hai Tien, clad in a yellow tracksuit [d] taking on a series of different challengers on each floor as they make their way through a five-level pagoda [99]\n\n\nUnproduced works\nLee had also worked on several scripts himself A tape containing a recording of Lee narrating the basic storyline to a film tentatively titled Southern Fist/Northern Leg exists, showing some similarities with the canned

the 1960s, there were about 400 martial arts schools in Hong Kong, teaching their distinctive styles of martial arts In Hong Kong's street fighting culture, there emerged a rooftop fight scene in the 1950s and 1960s, where gangs from rival martial arts schools challenged each other to bare-knuckle fights on Hong Kong's rooftops, to avoid crackdowns by British colonial authorities Lee frequently

artist, actor, philosopher, and cultural icon. Born in San Francisco, California, Lee is widely regarded as one of the most influential martial artists of all time. He is best known for his charismatic on-screen presence, impressive martial arts skills, and philosophical ideas that continue to inspire people around the world.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nBruce Lee's birth name was Lee Jun-fan. His father, Lee Hoi-chuen, was a Cantonese opera singer based in Hong Kong. Lee's mother, Grace Ho, was born in Shanghai and was of Eurasian ancestry. In December 1939, Lee's parents traveled to California for an international opera tour in Chinatown, San Francisco. Lee was born on November 27, 1940, in San Francisco, allowing him to claim U.S. citizenship due to the United States' jus soli citizenship laws.\n\nWhen Lee was four months old, his family returned to Hong Kong. However, their life was soon disrupted by the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong in December 1941. Lee's family experienced unexpected hardships over the next four years as Japan ruled the city.\n\n**Career and Education**\n\nLee's father, Lee Hoi-chuen, was a Cantonese opera star. As a result, Junior Lee was introduced to the world of cinema at a very young age and appeared in several films as a child. Lee had his first role as a baby who was carried onto the stage in the film Golden Gate Girl.\n\nIn his late teens, Lee's street fights became more frequent and included beating the son of a feared triad family. In 1958, after students from a rival Choy Li Fut martial arts school challenged Lee's Wing Chun school, he engaged in a fight on a rooftop. In response to an unfair punch by another boy, he beat him so badly that he knocked out one of his teeth, leading to the boy's parents making a complaint to the police.\n\n**American Roles and Creating Jeet Kune Do**\n\nFrom 1966 to 1967, Lee played the role of Kato alongside the title character played by Van Williams in the TV series produced and narrated by William Dozier titled The Green Hornet. Lee also appeared as his character in three crossover episodes of Batman, another William Dozier-produced television series.\n\nIn 1971, Lee appeared in four episodes of the television series Longstreet, written by Silliphant. Lee pitched a television series of his own in 1971, tentatively titled The Warrior, discussions of which were confirmed by Warner Bros.\n\n**Rise to Fame and Legacy**\n\nLee's success in The Green Hornet and Kung Fu led to his breakout role in the 1973 film Enter the Dragon, which catapulted him to international stardom. Lee's iconic status and untimely death fed many rumors and theories, including murder involving the triads and a supposed curse on him and his family.\n\nLee is considered by some commentators and martial artists to be the most influential martial artist of all time, and a pop culture icon of the 20th century, who bridged the gap between East and West.

Hong Kong martial arts films in 1973 [206] Lee's success inspired a wave of Western martial arts films and television shows throughout the 1970s–1990s (launching the careers of Western martial arts stars such as Jean-Claude Van Damme, Steven Seagal and Chuck Norris), as well as the more general integration of Asian martial arts into Western action films and television shows during the 1980s–1990s [207]\n\n\nMartial arts and combat sports\nJeet Kune Do, a hybrid martial arts philosophy drawing from different combat disciplines that was founded by Lee, is sometimes credited with paving the way for the combat sport mixed martial arts (MMA) [214] [215] [216] [217] The concept of mixed martial arts was popularized in the West by Bruce Lee via his system of Jeet Kune Do Lee believed that \"the best fighter is not a Boxer, Karate or Judo man The best fighter is someone who can adapt to any style, to be formless, to adopt an individual's own style and not following the system of styles.\" [218]\n\n\nRacial barriers and stereotypes\nLee is credited with helping to change the way Asians were presented in American films [4] He defied Asian stereotypes, such as the emasculated Asian male stereotype [13] In contrast to earlier stereotypes which depicted Asian men as emasculated, childlike, coolies, or domestic servants, Lee demonstrated that Asian men could be \"tough, strong and sexy\" according to University of Michigan lecturer Hye Seung Chung In turn, Lee's popularity inspired a new Asian stereotype, the martial artist [224]\n\n\nPopular culture\nNumerous entertainment and sports figures around the world have cited Lee as a major influence on their work, including martial arts actors such as Jackie Chan [210] and Donnie Yen, [212] actor-bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger, [212] actor-comedians such as Eddie Murphy [226] and Eddie Griffin, [210] actresses such as Olivia Munn and Dianne Doan, [210] musicians such as Steve Aoki and Rohan Marley, [210] rappers such as LL Cool J and Wu-Tang Clan leader RZA, [211] [212] bands such as Gorillaz, [212] comedians such as W Kamau Bell [210] and Margaret Cho, [212] basketball players Stephen Curry and Jamal Murray, skaters Tony Hawk and Christian Hosoi, and American footballer Kyler Murray, among others [210]\n\n\nTributes\nUnderworld pay tribute to Bruce Lee in their song Bruce Lee from their 1999 album Beaucoup Fish, a blend of rock, techno, and guitar riffs According to DAFT FM, [249] the lyrics can be interpreted as encouraging the idea of self-actualization and individuals to be true to themselves, thus paying tribute to Lee's philosophy of empowering oneself and living life to the fullest [citation needed]\n\n\nCommercials\nThough Bruce Lee did not appear in commercials during his lifetime, his likeness and image has since appeared in hundreds of commercials around the world [212] Nokia launched an Internet-based campaign in 2008 with staged \"documentary-looking\" footage of Bruce Lee playing ping-pong with his nunchaku and also igniting matches as they are thrown toward him The videos went viral on YouTube, creating confusion as some people believed them to be authentic footage [250]\n\n\nHonors\nA theme park dedicated to Lee was built in Jun'an, Guangdong Mainland Chinese only started watching Bruce Lee films in the 1980s, when

The 2024 general election resulted in a landslide victory for the Labour Party led by Keir Starmer, and the Conservative Party under Prime Minister Rishi Sunak suffered their worst ever defeat.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2024 general election was a significant event in British politics, with the Labour Party winning a record number of seats and the Conservative Party losing 251 seats. The combined vote share for Labour and the Conservatives reached a record low, with smaller parties doing well. The Liberal Democrats made significant gains to reach their highest ever number of seats, and Reform UK placed third in the share of the vote for the first time. The Green Party of England and Wales also won a record number of seats, alongside a number of independent MPs.\n\nThe Scottish National Party (SNP) lost around three-quarters of its seats, but Labour remained the largest party in Scotland. The Conservatives won no seats in Wales and only one seat in North East England. The election was noted as the most disproportionate in modern British history, mainly as a result of the first-past-the-post voting system.\n\n**Current composition of the House of Commons**\n\nThis table relates to the composition of the House of Commons after the 2024 UK general election and summarises the changes in party affiliation that took place during the 2024–present Parliament.\n\n| Party | Number of seats |\n| --- | --- |\n| Labour Party | 458 |\n| Conservative Party | 150 |\n| Liberal Democrats | 110 |\n| Scottish National Party | 5 |\n| Plaid Cymru | 3 |\n| Green Party of England and Wales | 20 |\n| Reform UK | 10 |\n| Independent | 5 |\n| Other parties | 15 |\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nIn order to vote in the general election, one must be:\n\n* A British citizen\n* A citizen of a qualifying country (such as Ireland)\n* A citizen of a Commonwealth country\n* A citizen of a country that has a reciprocal arrangement with the UK\n* A resident in the UK for at least 15 years\n\n**Voting eligibility**\n\nIn order to vote in the general election, one must be:\n\n* A British citizen\n* A citizen of a qualifying country (such as Ireland)\n* A citizen of a Commonwealth country\n* A citizen of a country that has a reciprocal arrangement with the UK\n* A resident in the UK for at least 15 years\n* Registered to vote in the UK\n\n**Date of the election**\n\nUnder the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022, the prime minister has the power to request the monarch call an election at any time during the five-year length of a parliamentary session. If the prime minister chooses not to do this, then parliament is automatically dissolved five years after the day it first met, and a general election is held 25 working days after dissolution. The 2024 parliament first met on 9 July 2024, meaning that if an election is not called, parliament will be automatically dissolved on 9 July 2029, and the latest an election could be held is 15 August 2029.\n\n**Opinion polling**\n\nOpinion polling for the next United Kingdom general election is being carried out continually by various organisations to gauge voting intention.

This groundbreaking project, led by Nikole Hannah-Jones, aims to challenge the traditional narrative of American history, placing the enslavement of Africans at the center of the nation's story.\n\n**Background**\n\nIn 1619, a group of \"twenty and odd\" captive Africans arrived in the Virginia Colony, carried by the English privateer White Lion, which had captured them in joint African-Portuguese raids against the Kingdom of Ndongo in modern-day Angola. This event marked the beginning of a long and brutal history of slavery in America, which would shape the country's development and continue to impact its society today.\n\n**Project**\n\nThe 1619 Project is a multi-faceted initiative that includes a 100-page issue of The New York Times Magazine, a series of podcasts, and a curriculum for schools. The magazine issue, released on August 18, 2019, features ten written essays, a photo essay, and a collection of poems and fiction. The project aims to educate the public about the true history of America, challenging the traditional narrative that the country was founded on principles of freedom and equality.\n\n**Accompanying Material and Activities**\n\nThe magazine issue was accompanied by a special section in the Sunday newspaper, in partnership with the Smithsonian, examining the beginnings of the transatlantic slave trade. Beginning on August 20, a multi-episode audio series titled \"1619\" began, published by The Daily, the morning news podcast of the Times. The Sunday sports section also had an essay about slavery's impact on professional sports in the United States. The Times plans to take the project to schools, with the 1619 Project Curriculum developed in collaboration with the Pulitzer Center. Hundreds of thousands of extra copies of the magazine issue were printed for distribution to schools, museums, and libraries.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe 1619 Project received a mixed reaction from historians and scholars. Some critics, such as Sean Wilentz, accused the project of cynicism for its portrayal of the American Revolution, the Civil War, and Abraham Lincoln. Wilentz and other historians disputed the claim that one of the primary reasons the colonists decided to declare their independence from Britain was because they wanted to protect the institution of slavery. They argued that the British abolitionist movement was practically non-existent in 1776 and that the Somerset v Stewart case, cited by the project, concerned slavery in England, with no effect in the American colonies.\n\n**Historical Accuracy**\n\nThe historians critical of the project argued that many of America's Founding Fathers, such as John Adams, James Otis, and Thomas Paine, opposed slavery. They also stated that every state north of Maryland took steps to abolish slavery after the revolution. The project's claim that the Revolution had caused the ending of the slave trade, which would have upended the economy of the colonies, was disputed by historians who pointed out that several colonies had already attempted to outlaw or impose prohibitive duties on the slave trade from 1769 to 1774.\n\n**Response**\n\nNikole Hannah-Jones criticized conservatives for their depiction of the project, stating that it does not argue that 1619 is the nation's true founding. However, critics cited by The Washington Post argued that this showed that the Times was quietly revising its position without acknowledgement of the original mischaracterization. The conservative National Association of Scholars published a letter asking for the revocation of the project's Pulitzer Prize.\n\n**Motivations for the American Revolution**\n\nSignificant controversy has centered on the project's claim that one of the primary reasons the colonists decided to declare their independence from Britain was because they wanted to protect the institution of slavery. Historians argued that this claim is ahistorical and that the British abolitionist movement was practically non-existent in 1776.\n\n**Journalistic Reactions**\n\nThe 1619 Project received positive reviews by Alexandria Neason in the Columbia Journalism Review and by Ellen McGirt in Fortune magazine, which declared the project \"wide-reaching and collaborative, unflinching, and insightful\" and a \"dramatic and necessary corrective to the fundamental lie of the American origin story.\"\n\n**Political Reactions**\n\nThe project received varied reactions from political figures. Then-Democratic Senator Kamala Harris praised it in a tweet, stating \"The #1619Project is a powerful and necessary reckoning of our history We cannot understand and address the problems of today without speaking truth about how we got here.\"\n\n**Awards**\n\nProject creator Nikole Hannah-Jones was awarded the 2020 Pulitzer Prize for Commentary for her essay. The award cited her \"sweeping, provocative and personal essay for the ground-breaking 1619 Project, which seeks to place the enslavement of Africans at the center of America's story, prompting public conversation about the nation's founding and evolution.\"\n\n**Bans**\n\nDonald Trump, in his final few months as president of the United States, vowed to ban the 1619 Project from state curricula, accusing educators of teaching their students to \"hate their own country.\" Echoing Trump's proposal, Republican lawmakers also sought to ban the project from state curricula. Bills were introduced by US Senator Tom Cotton at the federal level, by State Representative Mark Lowery in Arkansas, by State Representative Skyler Wheeler in Iowa, and by Senator Angela Burks Hill in Mississippi.

inspired by several newspaper articles printed in the Los Angeles Times in the 1970s about Hmong refugees, who, after fleeing to the United States because of war and genocide in Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, suffered disturbing nightmares and refused to sleep Some of the men died in their sleep soon after Medical authorities called the phenomenon Asian Death Syndrome The condition afflicted men between the ages of 19 and 57 and was believed to be sudden unexplained death syndrome or Brugada syndrome or both [21] Craven stated, \"It was a series of articles in the LA Times; three small articles about men from South East Asia, who were from immigrant families and had died in the middle of nightmares—and the paper never correlated them, never said, 'Hey, we've had another story like this.\" [22] The 1970s pop song \"Dream Weaver\" by Gary Wright sealed the story for Craven, giving him not only an artistic setting to jump off from, but a synthesizer riff for the movie soundtrack

Nightmare on Elm Street around 1981, after he had finished production on Swamp Thing (1982) He pitched it to several studios, but each one of them rejected it for different reasons The first studio to show interest was Walt Disney Productions, although they wanted Craven to tone down the content to make it suitable for children and preteens as a family-friendly PG-13 film; [29] Craven declined [18] [22] Another studio Craven pitched to was Paramount Pictures, which passed on the project due to its similarity to Dreamscape (1984) Universal Studios also passed; Craven, who was in desperate personal and financial straits during this period, later framed the company's rejection letter on the wall of his office, [28] which reads in its December 14, 1982 print: \"We have reviewed the script you have submitted, A Nightmare on Elm Street Unfortunately, the script did not receive an enthusiastic enough response from us to go forward at this time However, when you have a finished print, please get in touch and we would be delighted to screen it for a possible negative pick up.\" [30]\n\n\nCasting\nActor David Warner was originally cast to play Freddy [33] [34] Make-up tests were

was among those who Wes Craven talked with about the role of Freddy According to Hodder, \"I had a meeting with Wes Craven about playing a character he was developing called Freddy Krueger At the time, Wes wasn't sure what kind of person he wanted for the role of Freddy, so I had as good a shot as anybody else He was initially thinking of a big guy for the part, and he was also thinking of somebody who had real burn scars But obviously, he changed his whole line of thinking and went with Robert Englund, who's smaller I would have loved to play the part, but I do think Wes made the right

Langenkamp met this quality [20] Langenkamp, who had appeared in several commercials and a TV film, had taken time off from her studies at Stanford to continue acting Eventually she landed the role of Nancy Thompson after an open audition, beating out more than 200 actresses [28]  Langenkamp was already known to Anette Benson as she had auditioned for Night of the Comet and The Last Starfighter previously, losing out to Catherine Mary Stewart at both occasions Demi Moore, Courteney Cox, Tracey Gold, and Jennifer Grey have all been rumoured to have auditioned for A Nightmare on Elm Street, but Benson definitely ruled out Moore and Cox while also being unsure of Gold and Grey [41] Langenkamp returned as Nancy in A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987), and also played a fictionalized version of herself in Wes Craven's New Nightmare (1994) [42] [43]\n\n\nGlen\nJohnny Depp was another unknown when he was cast, initially accompanying his friend (Jackie Earle Haley who went on to play Freddy in the 2010 remake) to an audition According to Depp, the role of Glen was originally written as a \"big, blond, beach-jock, football-player guy\", far from his own appearance, [46] but Wes Craven's daughters picked Depp's headshot from the set he showed them [28] Depp got his own nod in a cameo role in Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare as a man on TV and later in the Freddy vs Jason intro, in clips from earlier films [47] [48] Charlie Sheen was considered for the role but allegedly wanted too much money [28] Anette Benson states that they did in fact offer the part to Sheen but he passed on it due to his agent demanding twice the weekly wage of $1,142 for Sheen, which New Line Cinema did not consider themselves to have the budget for Sheen himself objects to the sentiment that he turned down the role for the reason of money, saying:\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began on June 11, 1984, and lasted a total of 32 days, [27] [50] in and around Los Angeles, California [7] The high school the protagonists attend was filmed at John Marshall High School, where many other productions such as Grease and Pretty in Pink have been filmed [51] The fictional street address of Nancy's house in the film is 1428 Elm Street; in real life this house is a private home located in Los Angeles at 1428 North Genesee Avenue [52] [53] [54] The Lantz' family

Street**\n\nA Nightmare on Elm Street is a 1984 American supernatural slasher film written and directed by Wes Craven. The film stars Heather Langenkamp, Robert Englund, and Johnny Depp. The movie follows the story of Nancy Thompson, a high school student who is haunted by a dream demon named Freddy Krueger, who kills her and her friends in their dreams.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film begins with a young girl named Tina Gray, who awakens from a terrifying nightmare in which a disfigured man attacks her in a boiler room. Her mother points out the mysterious slashes on her nightgown, and Tina's best friend Nancy Thompson and Nancy's boyfriend, Glen Lantz, reveal that they too had nightmares about the same disfigured man.\n\nDuring a sleepover at Tina's house, Tina's boyfriend, Rod Lane, arrives, and they have sex. When Tina falls asleep, she dreams of the disfigured man, who attacks her; in real life, Rod sees her fatally slashed by an unseen force, forcing him to flee. Nancy and Glen find Tina bloodied and dead.\n\nAs Nancy delves deeper into the mystery of the disfigured man, she discovers that he is a child molester who was burned alive by a mob of parents in the 1960s. The man, now known as Freddy Krueger, seeks revenge on the children of Springwood by invading their dreams and killing them.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe cast of A Nightmare on Elm Street included veteran actors such as Robert Englund and John Saxon and aspiring young actors like Johnny Depp and Heather Langenkamp.\n\n**Production**\n\nPrincipal photography began on June 11, 1984, and lasted a total of 32 days, in and around Los Angeles, California.

articles printed in the Los Angeles Times in the 1970s about Hmong refugees, who, after fleeing to the United States because of war and genocide in Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, suffered disturbing nightmares and refused to sleep Some of the men died in their sleep soon after Medical authorities called the phenomenon Asian Death Syndrome The condition afflicted men between the ages of 19 and 57 and was believed to be sudden unexplained death syndrome or Brugada syndrome or both [21] Craven stated, \"It was a series of articles in the LA Times; three small articles about men from South East Asia, who were from immigrant families and had died in the middle of nightmares—and the paper never correlated them, never said, 'Hey, we've had another story like this.\" [22] The 1970s pop song \"Dream Weaver\" by Gary Wright sealed the story for Craven, giving him not only an artistic setting to jump off from, but a synthesizer riff for the movie soundtrack [23] Craven has also stated that he drew some inspiration for the film from Eastern religions [24]\n\n\nDevelopment\nA Nightmare on Elm Street contains many biographical elements from director Wes Craven's childhood [20] The film was

after he had finished production on Swamp Thing (1982) He pitched it to several studios, but each one of them rejected it for different reasons The first studio to show interest was Walt Disney Productions, although they wanted Craven to tone down the content to make it suitable for children and preteens as a family-friendly PG-13 film; [29] Craven declined [18] [22] Another studio Craven pitched to was Paramount Pictures, which passed on the project due to its similarity to Dreamscape (1984) Universal Studios also passed; Craven, who was in desperate personal and financial straits during this period, later framed the company's rejection letter on the wall of his office, [28] which reads in its December 14, 1982 print: \"We have reviewed the script you have submitted, A Nightmare on Elm Street Unfortunately, the script did not receive an enthusiastic enough response from us to go forward at this time However, when you have a finished print, please get in touch and we would be delighted to screen it for a possible negative pick up.\" [30]\n\n\nCasting\nActor David Warner was originally cast to play Freddy [33] [34] Make-up tests were done, [35] [36] but he had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts [37] Replacing him was difficult at first Kane Hodder, who would later be best known for playing fellow slasher icon Jason Voorhees, was among those who Wes Craven talked with about the role of Freddy According to Hodder, \"I had a meeting with Wes Craven about playing a character he was developing called Freddy Krueger At the time, Wes wasn't sure what kind of person he wanted for the role of Freddy, so I had as good a shot as anybody else He was initially thinking of a big guy for the part, and he was also thinking of somebody who had real burn scars But obviously, he changed his whole line of thinking and went with Robert Englund, who's smaller I would have loved to play the part, but I do think Wes made the right choice\" Hodder would in a way eventually play Freddy, as the hand that grabs Jason's mask at the epilogue in Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday (1993) [38] [39] Wes Craven explains that:\n\n\nFreddy\nActor David Warner was

had appeared in several commercials and a TV film, had taken time off from her studies at Stanford to continue acting Eventually she landed the role of Nancy Thompson after an open audition, beating out more than 200 actresses [28]  Langenkamp was already known to Anette Benson as she had auditioned for Night of the Comet and The Last Starfighter previously, losing out to Catherine Mary Stewart at both occasions Demi Moore, Courteney Cox, Tracey Gold, and Jennifer Grey have all been rumoured to have auditioned for A Nightmare on Elm Street, but Benson definitely ruled out Moore and Cox while also being unsure of Gold and Grey [41] Langenkamp returned as Nancy in A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987), and also played a fictionalized version of herself in Wes Craven's New Nightmare (1994) [42] [43]\n\n\nGlen\nJohnny Depp was another unknown when he was cast, initially accompanying his friend (Jackie Earle Haley who went on to play Freddy in the 2010 remake) to an audition According to Depp, the role of Glen was originally written as a \"big, blond, beach-jock, football-player guy\", far from his own appearance, [46] but Wes Craven's daughters picked Depp's headshot from the set he showed them [28] Depp got his own nod in a cameo role in Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare as a man on TV and later in the Freddy vs Jason intro, in clips from earlier films [47] [48] Charlie Sheen was considered for the role but allegedly wanted too much money [28] Anette Benson states that they did in fact offer the part to Sheen but he passed on it due to his agent demanding twice the weekly wage of $1,142 for Sheen, which New Line Cinema did not consider themselves to have the budget for Sheen himself objects to the sentiment that he turned down the role for the reason of money, saying:\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began on June 11, 1984, and lasted a total of 32 days, [27] [50] in and around Los Angeles, California [7] The high school the

film is 1428 Elm Street; in real life this house is a private home located in Los Angeles at 1428 North Genesee Avenue [52] [53] [54] The Lantz' family home was at 1419 North Genesee Avenue on the

Film Bulletin that A Nightmare on Elm Street was closer to a Stephen King adaptation with its small-town setting, and \"invented monster myth\" [1] Newman concluded that the film found \"Craven emerging from his recent career slump (Swamp Thing, The Hills Have Eyes Part 2, Invitation to Hell) with a fine, perhaps definitive bogeyman to back him up\" and that the film was \"a superior example of an over-worked genre\" [1] Paul Attanasio of The Washington Post praised the film, stating that \"for such a low-budget movie, Nightmare on Elm Street is extraordinarily polished The script is consistently witty, the camera work (by cinematographer Jacques Haitkin) is crisp and expressive.\" [90] The review noted that \"the genre has built-in limitations.. but Craven faces the challenge admirably; A Nightmare on Elm Street is halfway between an exploitation flick and classic surrealism\" The review also commented on Freddy Krueger, calling him \"the most chilling figure in the genre since 'The Shape' made his debut in Halloween.\" [90] Variety commented that the film was \"a highly imaginative horror film\", praising the special effects while finding that the film \"fails to tie up his thematic threads satisfyingly at the conclusion.\" [91]\n\n\nContemporaneous\nIn a contemporary review, Kim Newman wrote in the Monthly Film Bulletin that A Nightmare on Elm Street was closer

audience perceptions [14] Kelly Bulkeley interpreted the overriding theme as a social subtext, \"the struggles of adolescents in American society\" [93]\n\n\nAccolades\nA joint novelization of the 1984 film and the sequels Freddy's Revenge and Dream Warriors was released in 1987, written by Jeffrey Cooper [101] An eight part comic book adaption in 3D was commissioned in early 1989 to be published by Blackthorne Publishing [102] and were to be written by Andy Mangels; [103] these plans fell apart due to the collapse and bankruptcy of said publisher throughout later 1989 and 1990 Some lost concept art was finished of this planned comic book adaption before the folding of Blackthorne; [100] Mangels explains that \"Blackthorne had the 3-D rights, but they went bankrupt after I had

It is the world's tallest statue, standing at 182 meters (597 feet) tall. The statue is a tribute to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, a prominent Indian independence activist and the first Deputy Prime Minister of India.\n\n**History**\n\nThe idea of building a statue to commemorate Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was first proposed in 2010 by the then chief minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi. Modi announced the project on 7 October 2013, marking the beginning of his tenth year as the chief minister of the state. The statue was envisioned as a symbol of national unity and a tribute to Patel's contributions to the country's independence movement.\n\n**Design and Construction**\n\nAfter studying statues of Patel across the country, a team of historians, artists, and academics chose a design submitted by the Indian sculptor Ram V Sutar. The design was a larger version of a statue of Patel installed at Ahmedabad International Airport. The statue's design is meant to capture the essence of Patel's personality, conveying dignity, confidence, iron will, and kindness. The head is positioned upwards, with a shawl flung from the shoulders, and the hands are on the sides, as if Patel is set to walk.\n\nThree models of the design were initially created, measuring 0.91 meters (3 feet), 5.5 meters (18 feet), and 9.1 meters (30 feet) tall. Once the design of the largest model was approved, a detailed 3D scan was produced, which formed the basis for the bronze cladding cast in a foundry in China.\n\n**Design**\n\nThe Statue of Unity is a masterpiece of modern architecture, designed to reflect the grandeur of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's personality. The statue is made of bronze cladding, with a complex network of cables and steel rods supporting its massive structure. The design is meant to evoke a sense of awe and wonder, with the statue's towering height and majestic proportions creating an unforgettable experience for visitors.\n\n**Funding**\n\nThe Statue of Unity was built through a Public Private Partnership model, with most of the money coming from the Government of Gujarat. The Gujarat state government had allotted ₹500 crore (approximately US$70 million) for the project in its budget from 2012 to 2015. In the 2014-15 Union Budget, ₹200 crore (approximately US$28 million) was allocated for the construction of the statue. Funds were also contributed by Public Sector Undertakings under the Corporate Social Responsibility scheme.\n\n**Construction**\n\nThe construction of the Statue of Unity was a massive undertaking, involving a consortium of international companies. The project took 57 months to complete, with 15 months dedicated to planning, 40 months for construction, and 2 months for handing over by the consortium. The total cost of the project was estimated to be about ₹2,063 crore (approximately US$290 million) by the Government.\n\n**Features**\n\nThe Statue of Unity is a world-class monument, featuring state-of-the-art facilities and amenities. The statue is surrounded by a museum, a memorial garden, and a Interpretation Centre, which provide insight into the life and legacy of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. The statue is accessible by a cable car or a bridge, offering breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape.\n\n**Tourism**\n\nThe Statue of Unity has become a major tourist destination, attracting millions of visitors from across the world. In the first eleven days of its opening to the public on 1 November 2018, the statue was visited by over 128,000 tourists. In its first year of operation, the Statue of Unity attracted 2,900,000 visitors and collected ₹82 crore (approximately US$11.64 million) in ticket revenue. By 15 March 2021, 5 million tourists had visited the venue. It was visited by 10 million people by November 2022, and over 15 million cumulative visitors in five years since opening.\n\n**Gallery**\n\n* A panoramic view of the Statue of Unity\n* A close-up of the statue's design\n* A view of the statue from the Interpretation Centre\n* A picture of the statue at night\n\n**See also**\n\n* Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel\n* Gujarat\n* India\n* Statue of Liberty\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The Statue of Unity is a testament to the strength and resilience of the Indian nation.\n* The statue is a tribute to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's contributions to the country's independence movement.\n* The statue has become a symbol of national unity and pride for the people of India.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Statue_of_Unity\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nThen chief minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi announced the project on 7 October 2013 to mark the beginning of his tenth year as the chief minister the state [7]\n\n\nDesign and construction\nAfter studying statues of Patel across the country, a team of historians, artists, and academics chose a design submitted by the Indian sculptor Ram V Sutar [a] The Statue of Unity is a larger version of a statue of the leader installed at Ahmedabad International Airport Commenting on the design, Ram Sutar's son, Anil Sutar explains that, \"the expression, posture and pose justify the dignity, confidence, iron will as well as kindness that his personality exudes The head is up, a shawl flung from shoulders and hands are on the side as if he is set to walk.\" Three models of the design measuring 0.91 metres (3 ft), 5.5 metres (18 ft), and 9.1 metres (30 ft) were initially created Once the design of the largest model was approved, a detailed 3D scan was produced which formed the basis for the bronze cladding cast in a foundry in China [10] [14]\n\n\nDesign\nAfter studying statues of Patel across the country, a team of historians, artists, and academics chose a design submitted by the Indian sculptor Ram V Sutar [a] The Statue of Unity is a larger version of a statue of the leader installed at Ahmedabad International Airport Commenting on the design, Ram Sutar's son, Anil Sutar explains that, \"the expression, posture and pose justify the dignity, confidence, iron will as well as kindness that his personality exudes The head is up, a shawl flung from shoulders and hands are on the side as if he is set to walk.\" Three models of the design measuring 0.91 metres (3 ft), 5.5 metres (18 ft), and 9.1 metres (30 ft) were initially created Once the design of the largest model was approved, a detailed 3D scan was produced which formed the basis for the bronze cladding cast in a foundry in China [10] [14]\n\n\nFunding\nThe Statue of Unity was built by a Public Private Partnership model, with most of the money coming from the Government of Gujarat The Gujarat state government had allotted ₹500 crore (equivalent to ₹755 crore or US$90 million in 2023) for the project in its budget from 2012 to 2015 [18] [19] In the 2014–15 Union Budget, ₹200 crore (equivalent to ₹320 crore or US$38 million in 2023) was allocated for the construction of the statue [20] [21] [22] Funds were also contributed by Public Sector Undertakings under the Corporate Social Responsibility scheme [23]\n\n\nConstruction\nA consortium comprising Turner Construction, Michael Graves and Associates and the Meinhardt Group supervised the project The project took 57 months to complete – 15 months for planning, 40 months for construction and 2 months for handing over by the consortium [24] The total cost of the project was estimated to be about ₹2,063 crore (equivalent to ₹33 billion or US$390 million in 2023) by the Government [18] The tender bids for the first phase were invited in October 2013 and were closed in November 2013 [25]\n\n\nFeatures\nThe Statue of Unity is the world's tallest statue at 182 metres (597 ft) It rises 54 metres (177 ft) higher than the previous record holder, the Spring Temple Buddha in China's Henan province [38] The previous tallest statue in India was the 41 m (135 ft) tall statue of Lord Hanuman at the Paritala Anjaneya Temple near Vijayawada in the state of Andhra Pradesh The statue can be seen within a 7 km (4.3 mi) radius [10]\n\n\nTourism\nOver 128,000 tourists visited the statue in the first eleven days of its opening to the public on 1 November 2018 [44] It has been included in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation's '8 Wonders of SCO' list [45] In its first year of operation, the Statue of Unity attracted 2,900,000 visitors and collected ₹82 crore (US$11.64 million) in ticket revenue [46] By 15 March 2021, 5 million tourists visited the venue [47] It was visited by 10 million people by November 2022 [48] In five years since opening, the statue attracted over 15 million cumulative visitors [49]\n\n\nGallery\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Zodiac", "content": "\nName\nThe English word zodiac derives from zōdiacus, [5] the Latinized form of the Ancient Greek zōdiakòs kýklos (ζῳδιακός κύκλος), [6] meaning \"cycle or circle of little animals\" Zōdion (ζῴδιον) is the diminutive of zōon (ζῷον, \"animal\") [7] The name reflects the prominence of animals (and mythological hybrids) among the twelve signs.\n\n\nUsage\nThe zodiac was in use by the Roman era, based on concepts inherited by Hellenistic astronomy from Babylonian astronomy of the Chaldean period (mid-1st millennium BC), which, in turn, derived from an earlier system of lists of stars along the ecliptic [8] The construction of the zodiac is described in Ptolemy's comprehensive 2nd century AD work, the Almagest [9]\n\n\nHistory\nAs early as the 14th century BC a complete list of the 36 Egyptian decans was placed among the hieroglyphs adorning the tomb of Seti I; they figured again in the temple of Ramesses II, and characterize every Egyptian astrological monument Both the famous zodiacs of Dendera display their symbols, identified by Karl Richard Lepsius [14]\n\n\nEarly history\nAs early as the 14th century BC a complete list of the 36 Egyptian decans was placed among the hieroglyphs adorning the tomb of Seti I; they figured again in the temple of Ramesses II, and characterize every Egyptian astrological monument Both the famous zodiacs of Dendera display their symbols, identified by Karl Richard Lepsius [14]\n\n\nHebrew astronomy and astrology\nKnowledge of the Babylonian zodiac is said to be reflected in the Hebrew Bible; E W Bullinger interpreted the creatures that appear in the book of Ezekiel (1:10) as the middle signs of the four quarters of the zodiac, [25] [26] [better source needed] with the Lion as Leo, the Bull as Taurus, the Man as Aquarius and the Eagle as a higher aspect of Scorpio [27] Some authors have linked the signs of the zodiac with the twelve tribes of Israel, and with the lunar Hebrew calendar, which has twelve lunar months in a lunar year Martin and others have argued that the arrangement of the tribes around the Tabernacle (reported in the Book of Numbers) corresponded to the order of the zodiac, with Judah, Reuben, Ephraim, and Dan representing the middle signs of Leo, Aquarius, Taurus, and Scorpio, respectively Such connections were taken up by Thomas Mann, who in his novel Joseph and His Brothers, attributes characteristics of a sign of the zodiac to each tribe, in his rendition of the Blessing of Jacob [citation needed]\n\n\nHellenistic and Roman era\nThe Babylonian star catalogs entered Greek astronomy in the 4th century BC, via Eudoxus of Cnidus [15]\nBabylonia or Chaldea in the Hellenistic world came to be so identified with astrology that \"Chaldean wisdom\" became among Greeks and Romans the synonym of divination through the planets and stars Hellenistic astrology derived in part from Babylonian and Egyptian astrology [28] Horoscopic astrology first appeared in Ptolemaic Egypt (305 BC–30 BC) The Dendera zodiac, a relief dating to c. 50 BC, is the first known depiction of the classical zodiac of twelve signs.\n\n\nHindu zodiac\nAccording to mathematician-historian Montucla, the Hindu zodiac was adopted from the Greek zodiac through communications between ancient India and the Greek empire of Bactria [35] The Hindu zodiac uses the sidereal coordinate system, which makes reference to the fixed stars The tropical zodiac (of Mesopotamian origin) is divided by the intersections of the ecliptic and equator, which shifts in relation to the backdrop of fixed stars at a rate of 1° every 72 years, creating the phenomenon known as precession of the equinoxes The Hindu zodiac, being sidereal, does not maintain this seasonal alignment, but there are still similarities between the two systems The Hindu zodiac signs and corresponding Greek signs sound very different, being in Sanskrit and Greek respectively, but their symbols are nearly identical [36] For example, dhanu means \"bow\" and corresponds to Sagittarius, the \"archer\", and kumbha means \"water-pitcher\" and corresponds to Aquarius, the \"water-carrier\" [37]\n\n\nMiddle Ages\nDuring the Abbasid era, Greek reference books were translated into Arabic, and Islamic astronomers then did their own observations, correcting Ptolemy's Almagest One such book was Al-Sufi's Book of Fixed Stars, which has pictorial depictions of 48 constellations The book was divided into three sections: constellations of the zodiac, constellations north of the zodiac, and southern constellations When Al-Sufi's book, and other works, were translated in the 11th century, there were mistakes made in the translations As a result, some stars ended up with the names of the constellation they belong to (e.g Hamal in Aries).\n\n\nMedieval Islamic era\nAstrology emerged in the 8th century AD as a distinct discipline in Islam, [39]: 64  with a mix of Indian, Hellenistic Iranian and other traditions blended with Greek and Islamic astronomical knowledge, for example Ptolemy's work and Al-Sufi's Book of Fixed Stars A knowledge of the influence that the stars have on events on the earth was important in Islamic civilization As a rule, it was believed that the signs of the zodiac and the planets control the destiny not only of people but also of nations, and that the zodiac has the ability to determine a person's physical characteristics as well as intelligence and personal traits [40]\n\n\nEarly modern\nAn example of the use of signs as astronomical coordinates may be found in the Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris for the year 1767 The \"Longitude of the Sun\" columns show the sign (represented as a digit from 0 to and including 11), degrees from 0 to 29, minutes, and seconds [45]\n\n\nTwelve signs\nWhat follows is a list of the signs of the modern zodiac (with the ecliptic longitudes of their first points), where 0° Aries is understood as the vernal equinox, with their Latin, Greek, Sanskrit, and Babylonian names But the Sanskrit and the name equivalents (after c.500 BC) denote the constellations only, not the tropical zodiac signs The \"English translation\" is not usually used by English speakers The Latin names are standard English usage (except that \"Capricorn\" is used rather than \"Capricornus\").\n\n\nConstellations\nIn tropical astrology, the zodiacal signs are distinct from the constellations associated with them, not only because of their drifting apart due to the precession of equinoxes but because the physical constellations take up varying widths of the ecliptic, so the Sun is not in each constellation for the same amount of time [61]: 25  Thus, Virgo takes

"article": "**The Zodiac**\n\nThe zodiac is a circle of twelve signs used to divide the ecliptic, the path that the Sun, Moon, and planets appear to follow in the sky. The word \"zodiac\" comes from the Greek word \"zōdiakos\", meaning \"circle of little animals\". The zodiac is an ancient system of astronomy and astrology that has been used for thousands of years to predict the positions of celestial objects and their influence on human affairs.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe zodiac is a complex system that has been developed over centuries, with contributions from various cultures and civilizations. It is a system of astronomy and astrology that is used to predict the positions of celestial objects and their influence on human affairs. The zodiac is divided into twelve signs, each representing a different character or animal, and is used to calculate the positions of the Sun, Moon, and planets.\n\n**History**\n\nThe history of the zodiac dates back to ancient Mesopotamia, where the first known zodiac was created around 1500 BCE. The Mesopotamians developed a system of astronomy that included the use of zodiacal signs to predict the positions of the planets and the timing of celestial events. The zodiac was later adopted by the ancient Greeks, who developed a more sophisticated system of astronomy and astrology.\n\n## Early History\n\nThe early history of the zodiac is not well documented, but it is believed that the first zodiac was created in ancient Egypt around 2000 BCE. The Egyptians developed a system of astronomy that included the use of zodiacal signs to predict the positions of the stars and the timing of celestial events. The zodiac was later adopted by the ancient Babylonians, who developed a more sophisticated system of astronomy and astrology.\n\n## Hebrew Astronomy and Astrology\n\nThe Hebrew Bible contains references to the zodiac, with the creatures described in the book of Ezekiel (1:10) interpreted as the middle signs of the four quarters of the zodiac. The Hebrews also developed a system of astronomy and astrology that included the use of zodiacal signs to predict the positions of the planets and the timing of celestial events.\n\n## Hellenistic and Roman Era\n\nThe Hellenistic and Roman eras saw the development of a more sophisticated system of astronomy and astrology, with the use of zodiacal signs to predict the positions of the planets and the timing of celestial events. The Dendera zodiac, a relief dating to around 50 BCE, is the first known depiction of the classical zodiac of twelve signs.\n\n## Hindu Zodiac\n\nThe Hindu zodiac is a system of astronomy and astrology that uses the sidereal coordinate system, which makes reference to the fixed stars. The Hindu zodiac was adopted from the Greek zodiac through communications between ancient India and the Greek empire of Bactria. The Hindu zodiac uses the same symbols as the Greek zodiac, but with different names.\n\n## Middle Ages\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, Greek reference books were translated into Arabic, and Islamic astronomers then did their own observations, correcting Ptolemy's Almagest. One such book was Al-Sufi's Book of Fixed Stars, which has pictorial depictions of 48 constellations.\n\n## Medieval Islamic Era\n\nAstrology emerged in the 8th century AD as a distinct discipline in Islam, with a mix of Indian, Hellenistic Iranian, and other traditions blended with Greek and Islamic astronomical knowledge. The knowledge of the influence that the stars have on events on the earth was important in Islamic civilization.\n\n## Early Modern\n\nAn example of the use of signs as astronomical coordinates may be found in the Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris for the year 1767. The \"Longitude of the Sun\" columns show the sign (represented as a digit from 0 to and including 11), degrees from 0 to 29, minutes, and seconds.\n\n## Twelve Signs\n\nThe following is a list of the signs of the modern zodiac, with the ecliptic longitudes of their first points, where 0° Aries is understood as the vernal equinox:\n\n1. Aries (March 21 - April 19)\n2. Taurus (April 20 - May 20)\n3. Gemini (May 21 - June 20)\n4. Cancer (June 21 - July 22)\n5. Leo (July 23 - August 22)\n6. Virgo (August 23 - September 22)\n7. Libra (September 23 - October 22)\n8. Scorpio (October 23 - November 21)\n9. Sagittarius (November 22 - December 21)\n10. Capricorn (December 22 - January 19)\n11. Aquarius (January 20 - February 18)\n12. Pisces (February 19 - March 20)\n\n## Constellations\n\nIn tropical astrology, the zodiacal signs are distinct from the constellations associated with them, not only because of their drifting apart due to the precession of equinoxes but because the physical constellations take up varying widths of the ecliptic, so the Sun is not in each constellation for the same amount of time.\n\n## Precession of the Equinoxes\n\nThe zodiac system was developed in Babylonia, some 2,500 years ago, during the \"Age of Aries\". At the time, it is assumed, the precession of the equinoxes was unknown. Contemporary use of the coordinate system is presented with the choice of interpreting the system either as sidereal, with the signs fixed to the stellar background, or as tropical, with the signs fixed to the point (vector of the Sun) at the March equinox.\n\n## In Modern Astronomy\n\nAstronomically, the zodiac defines a belt of space extending 8° or 9° in celestial latitude to the north and south of the ecliptic, within which the orbits of the Moon and the principal planets remain.

Evans", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Zodiac\" following this outline:\n\n\nName\nThe English word zodiac derives from zōdiacus, [5] the Latinized form of the Ancient Greek zōdiakòs kýklos (ζῳδιακός κύκλος), [6] meaning \"cycle or circle of little animals\" Zōdion (ζῴδιον) is the diminutive of zōon (ζῷον, \"animal\") [7] The name reflects the prominence of animals (and mythological hybrids) among the twelve signs.\n\n\nUsage\nThe zodiac was in use by the Roman era, based on concepts inherited by Hellenistic astronomy from Babylonian astronomy of the Chaldean period (mid-1st millennium BC), which, in turn, derived from an earlier system of lists of stars along the ecliptic [8] The construction of the zodiac is described in Ptolemy's comprehensive 2nd century AD work, the Almagest [9]\n\n\nHistory\nAs early as the 14th century BC a complete list of the 36 Egyptian decans was placed among the hieroglyphs adorning the tomb of Seti I; they figured again in the temple of Ramesses II, and characterize every Egyptian astrological monument Both the famous zodiacs of Dendera display their symbols, identified by Karl Richard Lepsius [14]\n\n\nEarly history\nAs early as the 14th century BC a complete list of the 36 Egyptian decans was placed among the hieroglyphs adorning the tomb of Seti I; they figured again in the temple of Ramesses II, and characterize every Egyptian astrological monument Both the famous zodiacs of Dendera display their symbols, identified by Karl Richard Lepsius [14]\n\n\nHebrew astronomy and astrology\nKnowledge of the Babylonian zodiac is said to be reflected in the Hebrew Bible; E W Bullinger interpreted the creatures that appear in the book of Ezekiel (1:10) as the middle signs of the four quarters of the zodiac, [25] [26] [better source needed] with the Lion as Leo, the Bull as Taurus, the Man as Aquarius and the Eagle as a higher aspect of Scorpio [27] Some authors have linked the signs of the zodiac with the twelve tribes of Israel, and with the lunar Hebrew calendar, which has twelve lunar months in a lunar year Martin and others have argued that the arrangement of the tribes around the Tabernacle (reported in the Book of Numbers) corresponded to the order of the zodiac, with Judah, Reuben, Ephraim, and Dan representing the middle signs of Leo, Aquarius, Taurus, and Scorpio, respectively Such connections were taken up by Thomas Mann, who in his novel Joseph and His Brothers, attributes characteristics of a sign of the zodiac to each tribe, in his rendition of the Blessing of Jacob [citation needed]\n\n\nHellenistic and Roman era\nThe Babylonian star catalogs entered Greek astronomy in the 4th century BC, via Eudoxus of Cnidus [15]\nBabylonia or Chaldea in the Hellenistic world came to be so identified with astrology that \"Chaldean wisdom\" became among Greeks and Romans the synonym of divination through the planets and stars Hellenistic astrology derived in part from Babylonian and Egyptian astrology [28] Horoscopic astrology first appeared in Ptolemaic Egypt (305 BC–30 BC) The Dendera zodiac, a relief dating to c. 50 BC, is the first known depiction of the classical zodiac of twelve signs.\n\n\nHindu zodiac\nAccording to mathematician-historian Montucla, the Hindu zodiac was adopted from the Greek zodiac through communications between ancient India and the Greek empire of Bactria [35] The Hindu zodiac uses the sidereal coordinate system, which makes reference to the fixed stars The tropical zodiac (of Mesopotamian origin) is divided by the intersections of the ecliptic and equator, which shifts in relation to the backdrop of fixed stars at a rate of 1° every 72 years, creating the phenomenon known as precession of the equinoxes The Hindu zodiac, being sidereal, does not maintain this seasonal alignment, but there are still similarities between the two systems The Hindu zodiac signs and corresponding Greek signs sound very different, being in Sanskrit and Greek respectively, but their symbols are nearly identical [36] For example, dhanu means \"bow\" and corresponds to Sagittarius, the \"archer\", and kumbha means \"water-pitcher\" and corresponds to Aquarius, the \"water-carrier\" [37]\n\n\nMiddle Ages\nDuring the Abbasid era, Greek reference books were translated into Arabic, and Islamic astronomers then did their own observations, correcting Ptolemy's Almagest One such book was Al-Sufi's Book of Fixed Stars, which has pictorial depictions of 48 constellations The book was divided into three sections: constellations of the zodiac, constellations north of the zodiac, and southern constellations When Al-Sufi's book, and other works, were translated in the 11th century, there were mistakes made in the translations As a result, some stars ended up with the names of the constellation they belong to (e.g Hamal in Aries).\n\n\nMedieval Islamic era\nAstrology emerged in the 8th century AD as a distinct discipline in Islam, [39]: 64  with a mix of Indian, Hellenistic Iranian and other traditions blended with Greek and Islamic astronomical knowledge, for example Ptolemy's work and Al-Sufi's Book of Fixed Stars A knowledge of the influence that the stars have on events on the earth was important in Islamic civilization As a rule, it was believed that the signs of the zodiac and the planets control the destiny not only of people but also of nations, and that the zodiac has the ability to determine a person's physical characteristics as well as intelligence and personal traits [40]\n\n\nEarly modern\nAn example of the use of signs as astronomical coordinates may be found in the Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris for the year 1767 The \"Longitude of the Sun\" columns show the sign (represented as a digit from 0 to and including 11), degrees from 0 to 29, minutes, and seconds [45]\n\n\nTwelve signs\nWhat follows is a list of the signs of the modern zodiac (with the ecliptic longitudes of their first points), where 0° Aries is understood as the vernal equinox, with their Latin, Greek, Sanskrit, and Babylonian names But the Sanskrit and the name equivalents (after c.500 BC) denote the constellations only, not the tropical zodiac signs The \"English translation\" is not usually used by English speakers The Latin names are standard English usage (except that \"Capricorn\" is used rather than \"Capricornus\").\n\n\nConstellations\nIn tropical astrology, the zodiacal signs are distinct from the constellations associated with them, not only because of their drifting apart due to the precession of equinoxes but because the physical constellations take up varying widths of the ecliptic, so the Sun is not in each constellation for the same amount of time [61]: 25  Thus, Virgo takes up 5 times as much ecliptic longitude as Scorpius The zodiacal signs are an abstraction from the physical constellations, and each represent exactly 1⁄12th of the full circle, but the time spent by the Sun in each sign varies slightly due to the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit.\n\n\nPrecession of the equinoxes\nThe zodiac system was developed in

Admiral Sir Nicholas Hunt, [4] who was then a Commander in the Royal Navy assigned to work for the Director of Naval Plans inside the recently created Ministry of Defence, [5] and his wife Meriel Eve Hunt, Lady Hunt (née Givan; 1937–2022), daughter of Major Henry Cooke Givan [6] The Hunt family were landed gentry, of Boreatton, Baschurch, Shropshire A cousin was Agnes Hunt, pioneer of orthopaedic nursing [7]\n\n\nEarly career\nFollowing university, Hunt worked  as a management consultant at OC&C Strategy Consultants for two years and then became an English language teacher in Japan [12] On his return to Britain, he tried his hand at a number of different entrepreneurial business ventures, with three failed start-ups including an attempt to export marmalade to Japan [13] [14] In 1991, Hunt co-founded a public relations agency named Profile PR specialising in IT with Mike Elms, a childhood friend [12] Hunt and Elms later sold their interest in Profile PR to concentrate on directory publishing.\n\n\nPolitical career\nAt the 2005 general election, Hunt was elected to Parliament as MP for South West Surrey with 50.4% of the vote and a majority of 5,711 [19]\n\n\nEarly parliamentary career (2005–2010)\nAt the 2005 general election, Hunt was elected to Parliament as MP for South West Surrey with 50.4% of the vote and a majority of 5,711 [19]\n\n\nCulture Secretary (2010–2012)\nAt the 2010 general election, Hunt was re-elected to Parliament as MP for South West Surrey with an increased vote share of 58.7% and an increased majority of 16,318 [25] [26] [27] [28]\n\n\nNews Corporation attempted takeover of BSkyB and Leveson Inquiry\nHunt was given the quasi-judicial power to adjudicate over the News Corporation takeover bid for BSkyB Hunt chose not to refer the deal to the Competition Commission, announcing on 3 March 2011 that he intended to accept a series of undertakings given by News Corporation, paving the way for the deal to be approved [37] [38] Following a series of scandals concerning phone hacking, a House of Commons motion was planned that called on News Corporation to abandon the bid The bid was eventually dropped [39] Hunt was alleged to have had improper contact with News Corporation Emails released to the Leveson Inquiry detailed contacts between Hunt's special advisor Adam Smith and Frédéric Michel, [40] News Corporation's director of public affairs and therefore a lobbyist for James Murdoch The revelations led to calls from the Labour opposition and others for Hunt's resignation [41] Smith, Hunt's special adviser, resigned on 25 April [42] shortly before Hunt made an emergency parliamentary statement in which he said that Smith's contact with Michel was \"clearly not appropriate\" Hunt said Lord Justice Leveson should be able to investigate and rule on the accusations and requested the earliest date possible to give evidence to the Inquiry to set out his side of the story [43]\n\n\nLondon 2012 Olympics\nAs Culture Secretary, Hunt was the government minister responsible for the 2012 London Olympics and 2012 London Paralympics When it transpired that contractors G4S could not provide enough security staff for the Games, Hunt announced that soldiers would be drafted in and that he had been forced to \"think again\" about the default use of private contractors [49] Hunt took the decision to double the budget for the opening ceremony which received acclaim, and overall the Games were considered a huge success internationally [50] [51] [52] [53] According to Danny Boyle, the artistic director for the opening ceremony, the Government initially suggested removing the section of the opening ceremony about the NHS, although Hunt denied this [54]\n\n\nHealth Secretary (2012–2018)\nHunt was appointed Secretary of State for Health in the 2012 cabinet reshuffle, succeeding Andrew Lansley [61] During his tenure Hunt pursued an ambitious agenda to address patient safety, [62] regional variations in premature deaths, [63] health tourism [64] and A&E waiting times [65] [18] He oversaw increased spending on the NHS but was criticised for controversial reforms, [66] [67] manipulating figures [68] and increased privatisation [69] In a major break from a policy previously favoured by Conservative and Labour governments, Hunt declared patient choice was not key to improving NHS performance [70] He also defended the universal coverage provided by the NHS, including against US President Donald Trump [71] He has supported reducing the abortion limit from 24 weeks to 12 weeks [72] and homoeopathy if recommended to patients by a doctor [73] [74] [75]\n\n\nNHS weekend cover\nIn July 2015, Hunt indicated he would be prepared to impose a new consultant contract on doctors in England which would remove the opt out for non-emergency work at weekends to prevent \"about 6,000 avoidable deaths\" resulting from \"Monday to Friday culture\" in the NHS and to reintroduce \"a sense of vocation\" in consultants [98] The comments angered doctors who responded by sharing photographs of themselves working at weekends via social media using the hashtag #ImInWorkJeremy [99] [100] [101] Hunt was criticised by statisticians David Spiegelhalter and David Craven, BMA council chair Mark Porter and Shadow Health Secretary Heidi Alexander for his claims not merely misrepresenting the facts but potentially causing patients to delay hospitals visits and put themselves at risk His critics described the Hunt Effect where patients who needed medical attention at a weekend had been deterred from doing so because they were persuaded it would be better to wait until a Monday [102] [103] [104]\n\n\nJunior doctors' contracts and strikes\nUnder Hunt, the Department of Health announced a new junior doctors' contract in England which would increase doctors' basic pay but extend \"normal hours\" for which they would not be paid a premium [126] [127] [128] In September 2015, the British Medical Association (BMA) said they would not re-enter negotiations unless Hunt dropped his threat to impose the contract and balloted their members for industrial action [129] They argued the contract would include an increase in working hours with a relative pay cut of up to 40% [126] [130] [131] [132] Hunt tried reassuring the BMA by saying that no junior doctor would face a pay cut, before admitting those who worked longer than 56 hours a week would face a fall in pay but said working these long hours was unsafe [133] [134] [135] [136] In November 2015, he said he would offer a basic pay increase of 11%, but still remove compensation for longer hours [137] [138] [139]\n\n\nForeign Secretary (2018–2019)\nHunt was appointed Foreign Secretary in July 2018 following the resignation of Boris Johnson [163] Hunt said \"My principal job at a time of massive importance for our country is to stand four square behind the Prime Minister so that we can get through an agreement with the European Union based on what was agreed by the Cabinet last week at Chequers.\" [164] After being appointed Foreign Secretary, Hunt expressed fears over the UK potentially leaving the EU without a deal He said that it would be \"incredibly challenging economically\" and that \"It would lead to a fissure in relations which would be highly damaging for that great partnership that we have had for so many years, which has been so important in sustaining the international order.\" [165]\n\n\nConservative Party leadership candidate (2019)\nHunt announced his campaign to become the leader of the Conservative Party on 24 May 2019, following the resignation of Prime Minister Theresa May [183] On 20 June 2019, he was named one of the final two candidates [184] Hunt was defeated by Boris Johnson, having secured only one third of the vote His campaign was given £10,000 by a close associate to Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman [185] [170]\n\n\nBackbencher (2019–2022)\nReturning to the backbenches, Hunt founded Patient Safety Watch in October 2019, with the charity seeking to establish data to report on patient safety and harm in care, continuing the work on safety he started as Health Secretary He chairs the organisation and said he planned to invest considerable sums of money into it [187] However, according to The Guardian, two thirds of its income is spent on the salary of Hunt's former political advisor who was sacked over a previous lobbying scandal [188]\n\n\nConservative Party leadership candidate (2022)\nFollowing the resignation of Boris Johnson, Hunt announced he would be standing in the subsequent Conservative Party leadership election He criticised Johnson for investing in infrastructure instead of \"wealth creation\", and proposed policies including a moratorium on business rates in deprived areas and a cut to corporation tax to 15% instead of a proposed rise to 25% [195] He also said he would retain the rise in National Insurance rates and would not cut personal taxation until he \" [got] the economy growing\" [196] Hunt said Esther McVey would be deputy prime minister if he were to become prime minister [197] He was eliminated in the first round of voting on 13 July, receiving 18 votes [198] He endorsed Rishi Sunak after being eliminated [199]\n\n\nChancellor of the Exchequer (2022–2024)\nFollowing the dismissal of Kwasi Kwarteng on 14 October 2022 due to the September 2022 mini-budget, Hunt was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer by Prime Minister Liz Truss [200] He swiftly appointed four economic advisors to a panel to advise him: Karen Ward (a former top advisor to Philip Hammond), Rupert Harrison, Gertjan Vlieghe, and Sushil Wadhwani [201]\n\n\nIn opposition (2024–present)\nDue to the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, Hunt's constituency of South West Surrey was abolished, and replaced with Godalming and Ash At the 2024 general election, Hunt was elected to Parliament as MP for Godalming and Ash with 42.6% of the vote and a majority of 891 [216]\n\n\nPersonal life\nHunt's wife, Lucia Guo, comes from China He first met Guo in 2008, when she was working at Warwick University recruiting Chinese students for the university [219] [220] They married in July 2009 and have a son and two daughters; [221] [222] His wife presented a segment on Sky's China Hour, a show coproduced by state-owned broadcaster China International Television Corporation [223] He owns a townhouse in Pimlico, central London, as well as a home in Hambledon, Surrey

series of scandals concerning phone hacking, a House of Commons motion was planned that called on News Corporation to abandon the bid The bid was eventually dropped [39] Hunt was alleged to have had improper contact with News Corporation Emails released to the Leveson Inquiry detailed contacts between Hunt's special advisor Adam Smith and Frédéric Michel, [40] News Corporation's director of public affairs and therefore a lobbyist for James Murdoch The revelations led to calls from the Labour opposition and others for Hunt's resignation [41] Smith, Hunt's special adviser, resigned on 25 April [42] shortly before Hunt made an emergency parliamentary statement in which he said that Smith's contact with Michel was \"clearly not appropriate\" Hunt said Lord Justice Leveson should be able to investigate and rule on the accusations and requested the earliest date possible to give evidence to the Inquiry to set out his side of the story [43]\n\n\nLondon 2012 Olympics\nAs Culture Secretary, Hunt was the government minister responsible for the 2012 London Olympics and 2012 London Paralympics When it transpired that contractors G4S could not provide enough security staff for the Games, Hunt announced that soldiers would be drafted in and that he had been forced to \"think again\" about the default use of private contractors [49] Hunt took the decision to double the budget for the opening ceremony which received acclaim, and overall the Games were considered a huge success internationally [50] [51] [52] [53] According to Danny Boyle, the artistic director for the opening

if recommended to patients by a doctor [73] [74] [75]\n\n\nNHS weekend cover\nIn July 2015, Hunt indicated he would be prepared to impose a new consultant contract on doctors in England which would

consultants [98] The comments angered doctors who responded by sharing photographs of themselves working at weekends via social media using the hashtag #ImInWorkJeremy [99] [100] [101] Hunt was criticised by statisticians David Spiegelhalter and David Craven, BMA council chair Mark Porter and Shadow Health Secretary Heidi Alexander for his claims not merely misrepresenting the facts but potentially causing patients to delay hospitals visits and put themselves at risk His critics described the Hunt Effect where patients who needed medical attention at a weekend had been deterred from doing so because they were persuaded it would be better to wait until a Monday [102] [103] [104]\n\n\nJunior doctors' contracts and strikes\nUnder Hunt, the Department of Health announced a new junior doctors' contract in England which would increase doctors' basic pay but extend \"normal hours\" for which they would not be paid a premium [126] [127] [128] In September 2015, the British Medical Association (BMA) said they would not re-enter negotiations unless Hunt dropped his threat to impose the contract and balloted their members for industrial action [129] They argued the contract would include an increase in working hours with a relative pay cut of up to 40% [126] [130] [131] [132] Hunt tried reassuring the BMA by saying that no junior doctor would face a pay cut, before admitting those who worked longer than 56 hours a week would face a fall in pay but said working these long hours was unsafe [133] [134] [135] [136] In November 2015, he said he would offer a basic pay increase

years, which has been so important in sustaining the international order.\" [165]\n\n\nConservative Party leadership candidate (2019)\nHunt announced his campaign to become the leader of the

and written by Robia Rashid, [12] who previously worked on How I Met Your Mother and The Goldbergs as a producer [17] For a more accurate portrayal, she consulted with Michelle Dean, a professor who worked at UCLA's Center for Autism Research and Treatment [18] [19] Gilchrist said in an interview for Vulture, \" [Rashid] wrote the script We talked a ton and I did research and I watched movies and I read books\" [20] The supporting character Christopher is played by Anthony Jacques, who is autistic [21]\n\n\nReception\nAt the review aggregator Metacritic, the first season received a score of 66 from 20 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\" [34] On Rotten Tomatoes, 74% of 42 critics have given the season a positive review with an average rating of 5.4 out of 10 The website's consensus is: \"Great performances and a likable, realistic family dealing with autism lift Atypical above its alarming tonal shifts and predictability.\" [35] The acting was generally well-received, [36] [37] [38] although Gilchrist's portrayal received criticism for being \"inaccurate\" and \"stereotypical\" [4] [6] The lack of autistic people in the cast was also questioned [4] [5]\n\n\nSeason 1\nAt the review aggregator Metacritic, the first season received a score of 66 from 20 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\" [34] On Rotten Tomatoes, 74% of 42 critics have given the season a positive review with an average rating of 5.4 out of 10 The website's consensus is: \"Great performances and a likable, realistic family dealing with autism lift Atypical above its alarming tonal shifts and predictability.\" [35] The acting was generally well-received, [36] [37] [38] although Gilchrist's portrayal received criticism for being \"inaccurate\" and \"stereotypical\" [4] [6] The lack of autistic people in the cast was also questioned [4] [5]\n\n\nSeason 2\nSara Luterman of The New York Times wrote that the second season improves on the first Sam's decision to go to art school deviates from common depictions of autism, and his being autistic is no longer \"the source of  [his family's] misery\" Luterman praised the involvement of more autistic people as writers and actors, but criticized that Sam's misogyny is unaddressed and that he is \"still portrayed as more of a checklist than a person\" [21] Lorraine Ali of the Los Angeles Times lauded the show's continuing \"unique perspective, sharp humor and empathy\", and described the show as a \"wonderfully atypical family drama\" with \"many moving and awkward moments\" [25]\n\n\nSeason 3\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, season 3 has a 100% rating based on 7 reviews, and the average rating is 7/10 [40] Merrill Barr of Forbes wrote, \"Season three of Atypical is the show's boldest to date and truly feels like it has reached its stride  [...] Now, the show just gets to live and breathe as it explores its unique story in ever-evolving and fascinating ways.\" [41] Holly Edwards of Film Inquiry concluded that \"the dramatic and comedic beats almost always hit the right notes and know when a shift in tone is required.\" She called the show a \"step up from many shows of the same variety and a worthwhile viewing experience.\" [42]\n\n\nSeason 4\nLorraine Ali of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the final season of Atypical \"deftly tackles\" the fears parents of atypical children may have when watching their son or daughter come of age She also noted the season \"cement [ed] the show's legacy as one of the best series to deal with autism and its butterfly effect on family, friends, and loved ones\"

The term \"Baidya\" means \"physician\" in the Bengali and Sanskrit languages.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Baidyas have a rich and complex history, with their origins shrouded in myth and legend. Despite their long history, the Baidyas have always been a marginalized community, struggling to assert their place in the social hierarchy of Bengal. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the Baidyas, their origins, history, and current status in modern Bengal.\n\n## Etymology\n\nThe term \"Baidya\" is derived from the Sanskrit word \"vaidya,\" which means \"physician.\" In the Bengali language, the term \"Baidya\" is used to refer to a member of this traditional caste. The Baidyas have been known for their expertise in medicine and their knowledge of Ayurveda, a traditional system of medicine.\n\n## Origins\n\nThe origins of the Baidyas are shrouded in myth and legend. According to traditional accounts, the Baidyas are descended from the Ambashthas, a semi-legendary tribe mentioned in Hindu scriptures. However, these connections are tenuous and have been disputed by scholars. The Baidyas have always been a marginalized community, struggling to assert their place in the social hierarchy of Bengal.\n\n## Scriptural Narratives\n\nThe Upapuranas, a collection of texts that are considered subsidiary to the Vedas, played a significant role in the history of Bengal. These texts propagated and established Brahminic ideals in the hitherto-impure fringes of Aryavarta and accommodated elements of the vernacular culture to gain acceptance among masses. In the process, they became evidence of sociocultural negotiations that transpired in late-medieval Bengal.\n\n## Kulajis\n\nKulajis were a form of literature endemic to Bengal that served as immutable genealogical registers. They primarily served to establish social hierarchy vis-à-vis others. Of the two extant pre-modern Baidya genealogies, Chandraprabha constructs a descent from the semi-legendary Ambasthas, whereas the slightly older Sadvaidyakulapnjika did not. Both of them hold Adi Sura and Ballāla Sena to be among their ancestors.\n\n## History\n\nSedentary agrarian societies had formed in western regions of Bengal by c 1000 BCE. The growth of states were roughly simultaneous with the rise of the Gupta Empire and by then, cultural contacts with North India were gradually flourishing. Written records predating the Guptas do not survive.\n\n## Medieval Bengal (c. 600 C.E. - c. 1400 C.E.)\n\nWith the rise of sovereign kingships centered around Vanga, Radha, and Pundravardhana, the relatively well-off sections among the landholder class gained eminence and split into several sub-classes depending on economic power. Inscriptions referred to people from these classes alongside the villages they owned and above other professional classes — thus, economic affluence, rather than varna, appears to have been the operating norm in these societies.\n\n## Sultanate and Mughal Bengal\n\nIn Sultanate, Mughal, and Nawabi Bengal, Baidyas often branched out into fields other than medicine and comprised a significant percentage of the elites. They were reputed for their proficiency in Sanskrit, which they needed to read treatises of medicine. By the end of sixteenth century, Baidyas were occupying a position of preeminence in the Bengali social hierarchy alongside Brahmins and Kayasthas; marriages between Baidyas and Kayasthas were commonplace.\n\n## Caste Status and Contestations\n\nThe Baidyas have always been a marginalized community, struggling to assert their place in the social hierarchy of Bengal. The Vallal Charita of Ānanda Bhaṭṭa classed the Baidyas among Satsudras, of whom Kayasthas were held to be the highest. Works by Raghunandana hold Baidyas to be Sudras. In 1653 C.E., Ramakanta Das wrote the oldest available Baidya kulanji — Sadvaidyakulapnjika. A few years later, Bharatamallika would write Chandraprabha (1675 C.E.), and Ratnaprabha, a summary of the former text. Bharata claimed a mixed-caste/Vaishya status for the Baidyas whereas Das skipped such discussions.\n\n## Colonial Bengal\n\nDuring the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries, acrimonious debates about the caste status of Baidyas proliferated. Around 1750, Raja Ballabh wished to have Brahmins officiate at his rituals; he sought Vaishya status and claimed a right of wearing sacred thread for the Baidyas of his own samaj. On facing opposition from other Baidya zamindars, who thought this to be an attempt at gaining trans-samaj acceptance as a Baidya leader, and Brahmin scholars of Vikrampur, who resented the loss of monopoly, Ballabh invited 131 Brahmins from Benaras, Kanauj, Navadwip, and other regions with expertise in Nyaya Shastra.\n\n## Modern Bengal\n\nIn modern Bengal, Baidyas' place in caste-hierarchy follows Brahmins — they wear the sacred thread, and have access to scriptures, but cannot conduct priestly services. Their ritual rank — whether Sudras or not — is debated and claims to Brahmin status persist. However, their socioeconomic status rivals that of Brahmins. As of 1960, inter-marriages between the Brahmins, Baidyas and Kayasthas were common and increasing.\n\n## Notable People\n\nThere are several notable Baidyas who have made significant contributions in various fields. Some of them include:\n\n* Ramakanta Das, who wrote the oldest available Baidya kulanji — Sadvaidyakulapnjika\n* Bharatamallika, who wrote Chandraprabha (1675 C.E.)\n* Ratnaprabha, who wrote a summary of Chandraprabha\n* Baidya Krishnadasa Kaviraja, who wrote the Caitanya Caritāmṛta\n* Raja Ballabh, who sought Vaishya status for the Baidyas of his own samaj", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Baidya\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe terms Baidya means a physician in the Bengali and Sanskrit languages Bengal is the only place where they formed a caste or rather, a jati [6]\n\n\nOrigins\nThe origins of Baidyas remain surrounded by a wide variety of overlapping and sometimes contradictory myths, and are heavily contested Aside from Upapuranas and two genealogies (Kulajis), premodern Bengali literature does not discuss details of the caste's origins, [7] nor do any old and authentic Smritis [8] The community claims a descent from the semi-legendary Ambashthas, mostly believed to be of Kshatriya origin in Hindu scriptures, [a] but such connections are tenuous [9] [b]\n\n\nScriptural narratives\nThe Upapuranas played a significant role in the history of Bengal: they propagated and established Brahminic ideals in the hitherto-impure fringes of Aryavarta and accommodated elements of the vernacular culture to gain acceptance among masses [13] In the process, they became evidence of sociocultural negotiations that transpired in late-medieval Bengal [c]\n\n\nKulajis\nKulajis — a form of literature endemic to Bengal — were essentially immutable genealogical registers but actually, texts in flux, reflecting the needs and anxieties of contemporary society;

they remained there until 1921 [22]\n\n\nSecond marriage\nBy the time her marriage to Spencer was dissolved, Wallis had become involved with Ernest Aldrich Simpson, an Anglo-American shipping executive and former officer in the Coldstream Guards [35] He divorced his first wife, Dorothea (by whom he had a daughter, Audrey), to marry Wallis on July 21, 1928, at the Register Office in Chelsea, London [36] Wallis had telegraphed her acceptance of his proposal from Cannes, where she was staying with her friends, Mr and Mrs Rogers [37]\n\n\nRelationship with Edward, Prince of Wales\nIn January 1934, while Lady Furness was away in New York City, Wallis allegedly became Edward's mistress [43] Edward denied this to his father, despite his staff seeing them in bed together as well as \"evidence of a physical sexual act\" [44] Wallis soon ousted Furness, and Edward distanced himself from a former lover and confidante, the Anglo-American textile heiress Freda Dudley Ward [45]\n\n\nAbdication crisis\nOn January 20, 1936, George V died at Sandringham and Edward ascended the throne as Edward VIII The next day, he broke royal protocol by watching the proclamation of his accession from a window of St James's Palace, in the company of the still-married Wallis [55] It was becoming apparent to court and government circles that the new king meant to marry her [56] Edward's behaviour and his relationship with Wallis made him unpopular with the Conservative-led British government, as well as distressing his mother and his brother the Duke of York [57] The British media remained deferential to the monarchy, and no stories of the affair were reported in the domestic press, but foreign media widely reported their relationship [58] After the death of George V, before her divorce from her second husband, Wallis reportedly said, \"Soon I shall be Queen of England  [sic].\" [59]\n\n\nThird marriage: Duchess of Windsor\nWallis and Edward married one month later on June 3, 1937, at the Château de Candé, lent to them by French millionaire Charles Bedaux [76] The date would have been King George V's 72nd birthday;

Her marriage to Edward, Prince of Wales, and subsequent abdication of the throne in 1936, led to a constitutional crisis in the United Kingdom. The couple's relationship and subsequent marriage were surrounded by controversy, and their lives were closely followed by the media.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nWallis Simpson was born on June 19, 1896, in Square Cottage at Monterey Inn, a hotel in Blue Ridge Summit, Pennsylvania. She was the only child of Teackle Wallis Warfield, a stockbroker, and his wife, Alice Montague Murray. Her parents divorced when she was young, and Wallis was raised by her mother and her mother's second husband. Wallis was educated at home and developed a love of fashion and socializing.\n\nFirst marriage\n\nIn 1916, Wallis met Earl Winfield Spencer Jr., a US Navy aviator, while visiting her cousin in Pensacola, Florida. They married in November 1916 at Christ Episcopal Church in Baltimore, and had no children together. However, their marriage was marked by difficulties, including Earl's heavy drinking and reckless behavior. After the US entered World War I, Earl was posted to San Diego, and the couple remained there until 1921.\n\nSecond marriage\n\nBy the time her marriage to Earl was dissolved, Wallis had become involved with Ernest Aldrich Simpson, an Anglo-American shipping executive and former officer in the Coldstream Guards. He was already divorced, with a daughter from his previous marriage. Wallis and Ernest married in July 1928 at the Register Office in Chelsea, London. However, their marriage was not without controversy, as Ernest's ex-wife, Dorothea, refused to give him a divorce until he agreed to pay her a large settlement.\n\nRelationship with Edward, Prince of Wales\n\nIn 1934, Wallis met Edward, Prince of Wales, while she was on a yachting trip with her husband. Edward was immediately drawn to Wallis, and they began a romantic relationship. However, their affair was not without controversy, and Edward's family and advisors were opposed to the relationship. In January 1936, George V died, and Edward ascended to the throne as Edward VIII. The next day, he broke royal protocol by watching the proclamation of his accession from a window of St James's Palace, in the company of the still-married Wallis.\n\nAbdication crisis\n\nAs Edward's relationship with Wallis became public, he faced opposition from the British government and the Church of England. The government and the Church opposed the idea of a divorced person becoming queen, and Edward was faced with the possibility of marrying Wallis in a civil ceremony. However, this would have meant giving up the throne, and Edward was determined to marry Wallis. In September 1936, Edward abdicated the throne in favor of his brother, George VI, and married Wallis in a civil ceremony in France.\n\nThird marriage: Duchess of Windsor\n\nWallis and Edward married on June 3, 1937, at the Château de Candé, a French chateau owned by Charles Bedaux. The wedding was a small, intimate affair, with only a handful of guests in attendance. However, the marriage was not without controversy, as the Church of England refused to sanction the marriage. The couple's marriage produced no children, and they lived a relatively quiet life in exile.\n\nSecond World War\n\nDuring World War II, Wallis and Edward lived in France, but they were forced to flee when the German army invaded the country. They moved to Spain, and later to Portugal, where they lived in exile. In 1940, they moved to the United States, where they lived in New York and later in Florida.\n\nLater life\n\nIn 1946, Wallis and Edward moved to the United States, where they lived in New York and later in Florida. However, their relationship was not without controversy, and they faced opposition from the American public and the media. In 1956, Wallis published her memoir, The Heart Has Its Reasons, which was a bestseller. However, the book was criticized for its inaccuracies and sensationalism.\n\nWidowhood\n\nEdward died of throat cancer in 1972, and Wallis was heartbroken. She remained in the United States, living a relatively quiet life. However, she faced financial difficulties, and was forced to sell many of her belongings. In 1980, she moved to Paris, where she lived in a small apartment. She died on April 24, 1986, at the age of 89, from bronchial pneumonia.\n\nFuneral and legacy\n\nWallis's funeral was held on April 29, 1986, at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. The funeral was attended by the British royal family, including Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip. However, the funeral was not without controversy, as many people felt that Wallis was not worthy of a royal funeral. Despite this, Wallis's legacy as a fashion icon and a central figure in the British royal family remains unchanged.\n\nWallis was known for her sense of style and her love of fashion. She was a trendsetter, and her fashion choices influenced many people. However, her legacy is also marked by controversy and scandal. Her marriage to Edward, Prince of Wales, and her subsequent abdication of the throne, led to a constitutional crisis in the United Kingdom. Her life was marked by difficulties and controversy, but she remains a fascinating figure in history.\n\nTitles and styles\n\nWallis Simpson resumed her maiden name Wallis Warfield by deed poll on May 7, 1937. However, she continued to use the title \"Mrs\" throughout her life.\n\nWorks\n\n* The Heart Has Its Reasons (1956) - Wallis's memoir, which was a bestseller.\n\nReferences\n\n* Charles Higham, Wallis: The Duchess of Windsor (1988)\n* Andrew Morton, Wallis Simpson: The Duchess of Windsor (2001)\n* Wallis Simpson: The Duchess of Windsor (documentary, 2004)\n\nSources\n\n* The Times, June 20, 1937\n* The New York Times, June 3, 1937\n* The Guardian, April 25, 1986\n* The Daily Telegraph, April 25, 1986\n\nFurther reading\n\n* Wallis: The Duchess of Windsor by Charles Higham (1988)\n* Wallis Simpson: The Duchess of Windsor by Andrew Morton (2001)\n* Wallis Simpson: The Duchess of Windsor (documentary, 2004)\n\nExternal links\n\n* Wallis Simpson: The Duchess of Windsor (Wikipedia)\n* Wallis Simpson: The Duchess of Windsor (BBC)\n* Wallis Simpson: The Duchess of Windsor (royal.uk)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Wallis_Simpson\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nAn only child, Bessie Wallis (sometimes written \"Bessiewallis\") Warfield was born on June 19, 1896, in Square Cottage at Monterey Inn, a hotel directly across the road from the Monterey Country Club, in Blue Ridge Summit, Pennsylvania [2] A summer resort close to the Maryland–Pennsylvania border, Blue Ridge Summit was popular with Baltimoreans escaping the season's heat, and Monterey Inn, which had a central building, as well as individual wooden cottages, was the town's largest hotel [3] [4]\n\n\nFirst marriage\nIn April 1916, Wallis met Earl Winfield Spencer Jr., a US Navy aviator, in Pensacola, Florida, while visiting her cousin Corinne Mustin [19] It was at this time that Wallis witnessed two airplane crashes about two weeks apart, resulting in a lifelong fear of flying [20] The couple married on November 8, 1916, at Christ Episcopal Church in Baltimore, which had been Wallis's parish Win, as her husband was known, was a heavy drinker He drank even before flying and once crashed into the sea, but escaped almost unharmed [21] After the United States entered the First World War in 1917, Spencer was posted to San Diego as the first commanding officer of a training base in Coronado, known as Naval Air Station North Island;

English word \"parlor\" (/pɑːrlər/ PAR-ler) [41] [42] The Wall Street Journal first reported in November 2020 that conservative investor Rebekah Mercer had funded Parler, and Mercer has since been revealed to have been a co-founder of the company [2] [1] [40] [43] According to Mercer, she co-founded Parler to counter the \"ever-increasing tyranny and hubris of our tech overlords\" [44] Thomson

activist Candace Owens brought 40,000 new users to Parler, causing Parler's servers to malfunction [46] [48] The service initially attracted some Republican personalities, including then-Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale, Utah Senator Mike Lee, and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, as well as some who had been banned from other social media networks, such as right-leaning activists and commentators Gavin McInnes, Laura Loomer, and Milo Yiannopoulos [16] [41] Reuters wrote that Parler had \"mostly been a home for supporters of U.S President Donald Trump\" until June 2019 Matze told the news organization that although he had originally intended Parler to be bipartisan, he had focused its marketing efforts toward conservatives as they began to join the service [16]\n\n\n2020\nParler experienced a surge in signups in mid-2020 [51] In May, Twitter sparked outrage among President Trump and his supporters when it flagged some of the president's tweets about mail-in ballots as \"potentially misleading\", and a tweet regarding the George Floyd protests as \"glorifying violence\" [21] [52] [53] [54] In response, Parler published a \"Declaration of Internet Independence\" modeled after the United States Declaration of Independence, and began using the \"#Twexit\" hashtag (a portmanteau of \"Twitter\" and \"Brexit\") Describing Twitter as a \"Tech Tyrant\" that censored conservatives, the campaign encouraged Twitter users to migrate to Parler [55] Conservative commentator Dan Bongino announced on June 16 that he had purchased an \"ownership stake\" in Parler, in an effort to \"fight back against\" what he described as \"Tech Tyrants\" Facebook and Twitter [50] Parscale, who at the time was managing the Trump campaign, endorsed Parler in a tweet on June 18, also writing, \"Hey @twitter your days are numbered\", and including a screenshot of a tweet from President Trump which Twitter had flagged as \"manipulated media\" [51]\n\n\n2021\nParler was among the social media services used to plan the storming of the U.S Capitol on January 6, 2021 [83] [84] [85] [86]  [excessive citations]On January 2, Parler notified the FBI about material that Parler's lawyers found sufficiently alarming to warrant law enforcement attention, including posts by a user who declared that January 6 would be \"the final stand where we are drawing the red line at Capitol Hill\" [87] On January 5, the Secret Service warned the Capitol Police about an individual who intended to attend the rally and incite violence, and whose Parler posts included threats of violence against police [88] Mentions of \"civil war\" on Parler increased fourfold in the hours just prior to the storming [89] According to BuzzFeed News, after the riot at the Capitol, Parler had been \"overrun\" with death threats, encouragement of violence, and calls for Trump supporters to join another armed march on Washington, D.C on the day before the inauguration of Joe Biden [29] Activists, including Sleeping Giants, and employees of technology companies that had been providing services to Parler began to pressure those companies, which included Google, Apple, and Amazon, to deny service to Parler [30]\n\n\nShutdown by service providers\nOn January 8, two days after the storming of the Capitol, Google announced that it was pulling Parler from the Google Play Store, contending that its lack of \"moderation policies and enforcement\" posed a \"public safety threat\" [91] [92] Also on January 8, Apple informed Parler that they had received complaints about its role in the coordination of the riot in Washington D.C., the existence of \"objectionable content\" on the service, and that they had observed that \"the app also appears to continue to be used to plan and facilitate yet further illegal and dangerous activities,\" in violation of Parler's own guidelines forbidding such content Apple requested Parler submit a \"moderation improvement plan\" within 24 hours or face removal from the App Store On Parler, Matze posted that Parler would not \"cave to pressure\", and accused Apple of being anti-competitive [93] Apple followed through with their warning the next day, removing Parler from the App Store on January 9 [94] Ahead of the shutdown, some Parler users issued calls for violence and armed protests at state capitols and circulated conspiracy theories about Apple [95] Apple CEO Tim Cook later explained that in the company's view, \"free speech and incitement of violence\" do not have \"an intersection\" [96] Cloud communications company Twilio ended service to Parler, which made the service's two-factor authentication system stop working; Okta also denied them access to their identity management service, resulting in Parler losing access to some of their software tools [30] In addition, the database company ScyllaDB terminated its relationship with Parler, who had been using Scylla's Enterprise database [97]\n\n\nContent scraping\nFollowing the storming of the Capitol and just before Parler went offline, a researcher scraped roughly eight terabytes of public Parler posts The posts scraped made up 99% of publicly-accessible Parler posts, including more than a million videos, which maintained GPS metadata identifying the exact locations where the videos were recorded The researcher said her intention was to make a public record of \"very incriminating\" evidence against those who took part in the storming The data dump was posted online, and the researcher has said the data will eventually be made available by the Internet Archive [114] [115] According to Ars Technica and Wired, the reason the researcher was able to scrape the data so easily was because the Parler website had poor coding and poor security [115] [116] According to Wired, although all posts downloaded by the researcher were public, because Parler did not scrub metadata, GPS coordinates of many users' homes had likely been exposed [116] As of January 15, 2021, Gizmodo had mapped out the locations of around 70,000 of the GPS coordinates linked to videos scraped from Parler [117] Videos scraped from Parler were used as evidence during the second impeachment trial of Donald Trump [118]\n\n\nInvestigations\nOn January 21, 2021, the chairwoman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, Carolyn Maloney, called for an FBI probe into Parler, including its role in the storming of the Capitol Maloney said her committee intends to open an investigation into Parler [119] [120] On February 8, 2021, the committee asked Parler for information relating to who owns or has funded the company, any business ties to Russia, and its alleged offer of an ownership interest in the company to former president Donald Trump during his term [119] [121]\n\n\nDeparture of John Matze\nParler's board, led by Rebekah Mercer, dismissed John Matze from his role as Parler's CEO on January 29 [123] [124] Matze sent a memo to Parler staff in which he said that \"I did not participate in this decision\" to terminate him and that he had \"met constant resistance to  [his] product vision,  [his] strong belief in free speech and  [his] view of how the Parler site should be managed\" [45] In interviews following his firing, Matze noted that his termination may have been related to a dispute within the company regarding his belief that the company needed to \"crack down\" on domestic terrorism and violence and be \"a little more pragmatic while still respecting free speech\", but he was \"not exactly sure\" why he had been fired [125] [126] Matze also said his suggestion to implement a moderation policy to remove extremist content was overruled by Mercer [123]\n\n\nReturn online and subsequent events\nMatze wrote in a Parler post on January 9 that Parler could be unavailable for a week as they worked to \"rebuild from scratch\" and move to a new service provider [94] In an interview with Fox News on January 10, Matze said Parler had faced trouble in finding a new service provider, contradicting a previous Parler post in which he had said many vendors were vying for their business [130] He also said others had refused to work with Parler: \"Every vendor, from text message services to email providers to our lawyers, all ditched us, too, on the same day.\" [130] [109] Interviewed by Reuters on January 13, Matze said he did not know if or when Parler would return to operation [97] On January 17, Matze posted a message on the site's homepage, promising to \"welcome all of you back soon\" [131] Matze also claimed that Parler could be back online by the end of January [132]\n\n\n2022\nOn January 5, 2022, left-leaning liberal think tank New America released a report titled \"Parler and the Road to the Capitol Attack\" According to Mother Jones, the report is \"a deep and retrospective dive through an estimated 183 million now-public posts\" on Parler that discusses Parler's role in the 2021 Capitol attack and the platform's role in the spread of disinformation [154] [155]\n\n\nKanye West purchase bid\nOn October 17, Parler's parent company stated that Kanye West had agreed to buy ownership of the platform This came after West was blocked from Instagram and Twitter for antisemitic remarks [161] The deal was expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2022, [10] but was terminated in December by mutual agreement [162] Parler accidentally doxxed over 300 of its VIP members by including their email addresses in its announcement of West's purchase [163]\n\n\n2023 acquisition and shutdown\nOn April 14, 2023, digital media conglomerate Starboard announced that it had acquired Parler's parent company Parlement Technologies, and that it would temporarily shut down the social site while it prepared a revamped version [36]\n\n\n2024 relaunch\nOn February 9, 2024, Parler's social media outlets announced a relaunch of the social media service, simultaneously updating the website with a form to allow visitors to register for announcements regarding the platform's reopening [165] [166]\n\n\nUsage\nParler had fewer than a million users until early 2020 [168] In the last week of June 2020, it was estimated that the Parler app had more than 1.5 million daily users [61] As of July 15, 2020 [update], Parler had 2.8 million total users and had been downloaded 2.5 million times, nearly half of which were in June [19] [51] Throughout June and July, Parler on several occasions was highly listed both on the Apple App Store and on the Google Play store, in various categories and overall [22] The Parler app was downloaded nearly a million times in the week following Election Day in the United States on November 3, and became the most popular free app both on the Apple App Store and on the Google Play Store [75] Parler remained the most downloaded app in the United States for five days in early November [81] The New York Times reported that Parler had added 3.5 million users in a single week, [169] and during that month the service had about four million active users, and more than ten million total [74] [2] In December 2020, Parler had around 2.3 million daily active users [78] Fast Company reported that, as of December 5, both the number of daily active users and the rate of new downloads had dropped from their November peak, and CNN reported on December 10 that downloads had \"plummeted\" and were returning to the numbers Parler was experiencing before the election [77] [78] Parler again topped the App Store downloads chart on January 8, 2021, shortly after then-President Trump was permanently suspended from Twitter and also shortly before Parler was removed from the App Store by Apple [90] [94] As of January 2021, Parler reported having 15 million total users [30] According to Sensor Tower, Parler has received 11.3 million global downloads from both the App Store and the Play Store [170] Also according to Sensor Tower, app downloads for Parler had dropped from 517,000 in December 2020 to 11,000 in June 2021 [171] According to a May 2022 Pew Research Center poll, 38 percent of American adults have heard of Parler, while only 1 percent regularly get their news from Parler [172]\n\n\nUser base\nParler has a significant user base of conservatives [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] The app also has a number of high-profile Republican users, including Senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, as well as Fox News host Sean Hannity [61] [85] The Anti-Defamation League wrote in November 2020 that \"Parler has attracted a range of right-wing extremists\" including Proud Boys; proponents of the QAnon conspiracy theory; anti-government extremists including members of the Oath Keepers, Three Percenters, and other militia groups; and white supremacists including members of the alt-right and far-right accelerationists such as the terrorist group Atomwaffen Division [13] [168] Leaked GPS coordinates from Parler also revealed that users of the site include police officers in the United States and members of the U.S Armed Forces [179] Parler was also used by at least 14 UK Conservative Party Members of Parliament; several ministers including cabinet minister Michael Gove and a number of prominent UK conservative commentators joined the app [180] Some right-wing news companies including Breitbart News, The Epoch Times, and The Daily Caller also had accounts on Parler [181]\n\n\nContent\nParler is known for its conservative content [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [excessive citations] Parler has said they will not fact-check posts on the platform, a decision BBC News in 2020 says has allowed misinformation to spread more easily on the platform than on mainstream social networks In particular, BBC News noted the presence of posts spreading the QAnon conspiracy theory, as well as misinformation surrounding the 2020 U.S presidential election, COVID-19, child trafficking, and vaccines [72] The Verge noted in November 2020 that Parler had become a \"central hub\" for the Stop the Steal conspiracy theory relating to the 2020 U.S presidential election [75] In 2019 and 2020 respectively, The Forward and The Bulwark observed the presence of antisemitic conspiracy theories as well as others [14] [194] An analysis of posts from the week leading up to the Capitol storming found that 87% of the links shared on Parler were to misinformation websites, including Islamophobic and QAnon sites [195] According to Stanford University's Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, Parler had become an \"echo chamber\" for \"unfounded conspiratorial allegations of deliberate theft and plotting\" [3]\n\n\nModeration\nParler describes itself as a free speech platform, and its founders have proclaimed that the service engages in minimal moderation and will not fact-check posts They have also said they will allow posts that have been removed or flagged as misinformation on other social media networks such as Twitter [19] [20] Matze said in an interview with CNBC on June 27, 2020, \"We're a community town square, an open town square, with no censorship .. If you can say it on the street of New York, you can say it on Parler.\" [61] The service has been popular among conservatives who allege Twitter and Facebook has been biased against them when moderating content or flagging misinformation, praising Parler for offering an alternative to these mainstream platforms [23] [72] [61] [200] [excessive citations]\n\n\nAppearance and features\nParler is a microblogging service that is both a website and an app After being removed from the Apple App Store in January 2021, a version of the app with added content filters was released in May 2021 The app was formerly available on the Google Play Store, but was also removed in January 2021 [208] Users who register for accounts are able to follow the accounts of other users [210] Unlike Twitter, the feed of posts – called \"parleys\" – from followed accounts appears to a user chronologically, instead of through an algorithm-based selection process [51] [210] [211] Parleys are limited to 1,000 characters in length, and users can \"vote\" or \"echo\" the posts of other users whom they follow, functions that have been compared to Twitter's \"like\" and \"retweet\" functions [20] A direct messaging feature is also built into the platform, allowing users to privately contact each other [20] Public figures are verified on the app with a gold badge, and parody accounts are identified with a purple badge [61] Anyone who verifies their identity by providing government-issued photo identification during signup is identified with a red badge [20] Spammers have exploited this two-tier verification system by providing documentation to verify their identity, obtaining a red badge, and changing their account name The red badge persisted after the name change [212] Parler refers to users of its service as Parleyers [19]\n\n\nRegistration and verification\nCreating an account and using Parler is free Signup requires both an e-mail address and a phone number [55] At the point of registration, users have the option of supplying a photo of themselves and a scan of the front and back of their government-issued photo identification to have their account verified by Parler [211] [20] In order to join Parler's \"influencer network\", the company may ask for users' social security or tax identification numbers [205]\n\n\nSecurity\nSeveral publications and researchers have criticized Parler's security.\n\n\nCompany\nParler was founded in 2018 by John Matze and Jared Thomson In November 2020, The Wall Street Journal reported that Rebekah Mercer, an investor known for her support of conservative individuals and organizations, had helped fund Parler After the report was published, Mercer described herself as having \"started Parler\" with Matze, and she has been described by CNN as a co-founder of the company [2] [1] [40]\n\n\nFunding\nIn a June 27, 2020, interview with CNBC, Matze said he wanted to raise an institutional round of financing soon, although he expressed concerns that venture capitalists might not be interested in funding the company because of ideological differences [61] Fortune wrote in June 2020 that the company planned to add advertising to the service soon [20] They also planned to generate revenue based on an ad matching scheme whereby companies would be matched with Parler influencers to post sponsored content, with Parler taking a percentage of each deal [20] [210] Slate has questioned Parler's business model, writing that Parler's plan to rely on advertising revenue \"seems far from foolproof\" given the 2020 advertising boycotts of Facebook by some large brands who objected to hateful content on the platform [22] NBC also questioned whether corporations would be interested in advertising alongside \"controversial material\" on Parler [74] Matze said in an interview on June 29, 2020, that the business was not profitable [234] As of January 2021 [update], Parler had not received any known venture capital, although in February 2021, Buzzfeed News reported that Parler had recently sought to obtain funding from J D Vance's venture-capital firm Narya Capital [74] [223] [43] In January 2022, Parler raised $20 million in funding [233]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Parler**\n\nParler is a microblogging and social networking service that was founded in 2018 by John Matze and Jared Thomson.

announced a relaunch of the social media service, simultaneously updating the website with a form to allow visitors to register for announcements regarding the platform's reopening [165] [166]\n\n\nUsage\nParler had fewer than a million users until early 2020 [168] In the last week of June 2020, it was estimated that the Parler app had more than 1.5 million daily users [61] As of July 15, 2020 [update], Parler had 2.8 million total users and had been downloaded 2.5 million times, nearly half of which were in June [19] [51] Throughout June and July, Parler on several occasions was highly listed both on the Apple App Store and on the Google Play store, in various categories and overall [22] The Parler app was downloaded nearly a million times in the week following Election Day in the United States on November 3, and became the most popular free app both on the Apple App Store and on the Google Play Store [75] Parler remained the most downloaded app in the United States for five days in early November [81] The New York Times reported that Parler had added 3.5 million users in a single week, [169] and during that month the service had about four million active users, and more than ten million total [74] [2] In December 2020, Parler had around 2.3 million daily active users [78] Fast Company reported that, as of December 5, both the number of daily active users and the rate of new downloads had dropped from their November peak, and CNN reported on December 10 that downloads had \"plummeted\" and were returning to the numbers Parler was experiencing before the election [77] [78] Parler again topped the App Store downloads chart on January 8, 2021, shortly after then-President Trump was permanently suspended from Twitter and also shortly before Parler was removed from the App Store by Apple [90] [94] As of January 2021, Parler reported having 15 million total users [30] According to Sensor Tower, Parler has received 11.3 million global downloads from both the App Store and the Play Store [170] Also according to Sensor Tower, app downloads for Parler had dropped from 517,000 in December 2020 to 11,000 in June 2021 [171] According to a May 2022 Pew Research Center poll, 38 percent of American adults have heard of Parler, while only 1 percent regularly get their news from Parler [172]\n\n\nUser base\nParler has a significant user base of conservatives [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] The app also has a number of high-profile Republican users, including Senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, as well as Fox News host Sean Hannity [61] [85] The Anti-Defamation League wrote in November 2020 that \"Parler has attracted a range of right-wing extremists\" including Proud Boys; proponents of the QAnon conspiracy theory; anti-government extremists including members of the Oath Keepers, Three Percenters, and other militia groups; and white supremacists including members of the alt-right and far-right accelerationists such as the terrorist group Atomwaffen Division [13] [168] Leaked GPS coordinates from Parler also revealed that users of the site include police officers in the United States and members of the U.S Armed Forces [179] Parler was also used by at least 14 UK Conservative Party Members of Parliament; several ministers including cabinet minister Michael Gove and a number of prominent UK conservative commentators joined the app [180] Some right-wing news companies including Breitbart News, The Epoch Times, and The Daily Caller also had accounts on Parler [181]\n\n\nContent\nParler is known for its conservative content [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [excessive citations] Parler has said they will not fact-check posts on the platform, a decision BBC News in 2020 says has allowed misinformation to spread more easily on the platform than on mainstream social networks In particular, BBC News noted the presence of posts spreading the QAnon conspiracy theory, as well as misinformation surrounding the 2020 U.S presidential election, COVID-19, child trafficking, and vaccines [72] The Verge noted in November 2020 that Parler had become a \"central hub\" for the Stop the Steal conspiracy theory relating to the 2020 U.S presidential election [75] In 2019 and 2020 respectively, The Forward and The Bulwark observed the presence of antisemitic conspiracy theories as well as others [14] [194] An analysis of posts from the week leading up to the Capitol storming found that 87% of the links shared on Parler were to misinformation websites, including Islamophobic and QAnon sites [195] According to Stanford University's Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, Parler had become an \"echo chamber\" for \"unfounded conspiratorial allegations of deliberate theft and plotting\" [3]\n\n\nModeration\nParler describes itself as a free speech platform, and its founders have proclaimed that the service engages in minimal moderation and will not fact-check posts They have also said they will allow posts that have been removed or flagged as misinformation on other social media networks such as Twitter [19] [20] Matze said in an interview with CNBC on June 27, 2020, \"We're a community town square, an open town square, with no censorship .. If you can say it on the street of New York, you can say it on Parler.\" [61] The service has been popular among conservatives who allege Twitter and Facebook has been biased against them when moderating content or flagging misinformation, praising Parler for offering an alternative to these mainstream platforms [23] [72] [61] [200] [excessive citations]\n\n\nAppearance and features\nParler is a microblogging service that is both a website and an app After being removed from the Apple App Store in January 2021, a version of the app with added content filters was released in May 2021 The app was formerly available on the Google Play Store, but was also removed in January 2021 [208] Users who register for accounts are able to follow the accounts of other users [210] Unlike Twitter, the feed of posts – called \"parleys\" – from followed accounts appears to a user chronologically, instead of through an algorithm-based selection process [51] [210] [211] Parleys are limited to 1,000 characters in length, and users can \"vote\" or \"echo\" the posts of other users whom they follow, functions that have been compared to Twitter's \"like\" and \"retweet\" functions [20] A direct messaging feature is also built into the platform, allowing users to privately contact each other [20] Public figures are verified on the app with a gold badge, and parody accounts are identified with a purple badge [61] Anyone who verifies their identity by providing government-issued photo identification during signup is identified with a red badge [20] Spammers have exploited this two-tier verification system by providing documentation to verify their identity, obtaining a red badge, and changing their account name The red badge persisted after the name change [212] Parler refers to users of its service as Parleyers [19]\n\n\nRegistration and verification\nCreating an account and using Parler is free Signup requires both an e-mail address and a phone number [55] At the point of registration, users have the option of supplying a photo of themselves and a scan of the front and back of their government-issued photo identification to have their account verified by Parler [211] [20] In order to join Parler's \"influencer network\", the company may ask for users' social security or tax identification numbers [205]\n\n\nSecurity\nSeveral publications and researchers have criticized Parler's security.\n\n\nCompany\nParler was founded in 2018 by John Matze and Jared Thomson In November 2020, The Wall Street Journal reported that Rebekah Mercer, an investor known for her support of conservative individuals and organizations, had helped fund Parler After the report was published, Mercer described herself as having \"started Parler\" with Matze, and she has been described by CNN as a co-founder of the company [2] [1] [40]\n\n\nFunding\nIn a June 27, 2020, interview with CNBC, Matze said he wanted to raise an institutional round of financing soon, although he expressed concerns that venture capitalists might not be interested in funding the company because of ideological differences [61] Fortune wrote in June 2020 that the company planned to add advertising to the service soon [20] They also planned to generate revenue based on an ad matching scheme whereby companies would be matched with Parler influencers to post sponsored content, with Parler taking a percentage of each deal [20] [210] Slate has questioned Parler's business model, writing that Parler's plan to rely on advertising revenue \"seems far from foolproof\" given the 2020 advertising boycotts of Facebook by some large brands who objected to hateful content on the platform [22] NBC also questioned whether corporations would be interested in advertising alongside \"controversial material\" on Parler [74] Matze said in an interview on June 29, 2020, that the business was not profitable [234] As of January 2021 [update], Parler had not received any known venture capital, although in February 2021, Buzzfeed News reported that Parler had recently sought to obtain funding from J D Vance's venture-capital firm Narya Capital [74] [223] [43] In January 2022, Parler raised $20 million in funding [233]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

China**\n\nThe Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications built across the northern borders of China to protect the country from invasions. The wall stretches over 13,000 miles (21,000 km) and is one of the most impressive architectural achievements in history. The wall has been extensively restored and repaired over the centuries, and it is now one of the most popular tourist attractions in China.\n\n**Names**\n\nThe Great Wall of China has historically had a number of different names in both Chinese and English. The wall has been referred to as the \"Long Wall\" or \"Long Wall of 10,000 Li\" (a \"li\" being a Chinese unit of measurement equivalent to about 500 meters) in Chinese, while in English it has been referred to as the \"Great Wall of China,\" \"Long Wall of China,\" or \"Chinese Great Wall.\"\n\n**History**\n\nThe Chinese were already familiar with the techniques of wall-building by the time of the Spring and Autumn period between the 8th and 5th centuries BC. During this time and the subsequent Warring States period, the states of Qin, Wei, Zhao, Qi, Han, Yan, and Zhongshan all constructed extensive fortifications to defend their own borders. These walls were built to withstand the attack of small arms such as swords and spears and were made mostly of stone or by stamping earth and gravel between board frames.\n\nThe construction of the Great Wall of China as we know it today began during the Qin dynasty (221-206 BC), when Emperor Qin Shi Huang ordered the construction of a long wall to protect his empire from the Mongols and other nomadic tribes. The wall was built using local materials, including stone, earth, and wood, and was designed to be a powerful symbol of the emperor's power and authority.\n\nDuring the Han dynasty (206 BC-220 AD), the Great Wall of China was extended and fortified, with a number of new sections being built to protect the empire from invasions. The wall was also used as a means of controlling trade and immigration, with a number of customs posts and checkpoints being established along its length.\n\n**Early Walls**\n\nThe Chinese were already familiar with the techniques of wall-building by the time of the Spring and Autumn period between the 8th and 5th centuries BC. During this time and the subsequent Warring States period, the states of Qin, Wei, Zhao, Qi, Han, Yan, and Zhongshan all constructed extensive fortifications to defend their own borders. These walls were built to withstand the attack of small arms such as swords and spears and were made mostly of stone or by stamping earth and gravel between board frames.\n\nThe earliest known wall of this type was built by the state of Chu in the 6th century BC. This wall was built to protect the state from invasions by the neighboring state of Wu and was constructed using a combination of stone and earth. The wall was approximately 100 miles (160 km) long and was built on a series of hills and ridges.\n\n**Ming Era**\n\nThe Great Wall concept was revived again under the Ming in the 14th century, and following the Ming army's defeat by the Oirats in the Battle of Tumu, the Ming had failed to gain a clear upper hand over the Mongol tribes after successive battles, and the long-drawn conflict was taking a toll on the empire. The Ming adopted a new strategy to keep the nomadic tribes out by constructing walls along the northern border of China. Acknowledging the Mongol control established in the Ordos Desert, the wall followed the desert's southern edge instead of incorporating the bend of the Yellow River.\n\nThe construction of the Great Wall of China during the Ming dynasty was a massive undertaking that required the labor of thousands of workers. The wall was built using bricks, stone, and other materials, and was designed to be a powerful symbol of the emperor's power and authority. The wall was also used as a means of controlling trade and immigration, with a number of customs posts and checkpoints being established along its length.\n\n**Foreign Accounts**\n\nNone of the Europeans who visited China or Mongolia in the 13th and 14th centuries, such as Giovanni da Pian del Carpine, William of Rubruck, Marco Polo, Odoric of Pordenone, and Giovanni de' Marignolli, mentioned the Great Wall. The first European to mention the Great Wall was the Venetian explorer Marco Polo, who visited China in the 13th century. However, Polo did not mention the wall in his writings, and it was not until the 14th century that the wall was mentioned in European accounts of China.\n\n**Course**\n\nA formal definition of what constitutes a \"Great Wall\" has not been agreed upon, making the full course of the Great Wall difficult to describe in its entirety. The defensive lines contain multiple stretches of ramparts, trenches, and ditches, as well as individual fortresses.\n\nThe Great Wall of China stretches over 13,000 miles (21,000 km) and passes through a number of different regions, including the provinces of Gansu, Ningxia, Shaanxi, and Beijing. The wall was built to protect the empire from invasions by nomadic tribes, and was also used as a means of controlling trade and immigration.\n\n**Han Great Wall**\n\nHan fortifications start from Yumen Pass and Yang Pass, southwest of Dunhuang, in Gansu province.

areas of the wall, as were materials such as tiles, lime, and stone The size and weight of the bricks made them easier to work with than earth and stone, so construction quickened Additionally, bricks could bear more weight and endure better than rammed earth Stone can hold under its own weight better than brick, but is more difficult to use Consequently, stones cut into rectangular shapes were used for the foundation, inner and outer brims, and gateways of the wall Battlements line the uppermost portion of the vast majority of the wall, with defensive gaps a little over 30 cm (12 in) tall, and about 23 cm (9.1 in) wide From the parapets, guards could survey the surrounding land [59]\n\n\nCondition\nWhile portions north of Beijing and near tourist centers have been preserved and even extensively renovated, in many other locations the wall is in disrepair The wall sometimes provided a source of stones to build houses and roads [64] Sections of the wall are also prone to graffiti and vandalism, while inscribed bricks were pilfered and sold on the market for up to 50 renminbi [65] Parts have been destroyed to make way for construction or mining [66]\n\n\nVisibility from space\nVarious factoids in popular culture claim that the Great Wall can be seen (with the naked eye) from space, with questionable degrees of veracity.\n\n\nFrom the Moon\nThe Great Wall of China cannot be seen by the naked human eye from the Moon [70] Even though the myth is thoroughly debunked, [71] it is still ingrained in popular culture [72] The apparent width of the Great Wall from the Moon would be the same as that of a human hair viewed from 3 km (2 mi) away [73]\n\n\nFrom low Earth orbit\nA more controversial question is whether the wall is visible from low Earth orbit (an altitude of as little as 160 km (100 mi)) NASA claims that it is barely visible, and only under nearly perfect conditions; it is no more conspicuous than many other human-made objects

{"title": "Wordle", "content": "\nGameplay\nEvery day, a five-letter word is chosen which players aim to guess within six tries [1] After every guess, each letter is marked as either green, yellow or gray: green indicates that the letter is correct and in the correct position, yellow means it is in the answer but not in the right position, while gray indicates it is not in the answer at all [2] Multiple instances of the same letter in a guess, such as the \"o\"s in \"robot\", will be colored green or yellow only if the letter also appears multiple times in the answer; otherwise, excess repeating letters will be colored gray [3] The game has a \"hard mode\" option, which requires players to include letters marked as green and yellow in subsequent guesses [4] The daily word is the same for everyone [5] The game also has a dark theme as well as a high-contrast theme for colorblind accessibility, which changes the color scheme from green and yellow to orange and blue [4] [6]\n\n\nHistory\nWardle created the prototype of Wordle in 2013, inspired by the color-matching game Mastermind, [26] [27] under the name Mr Bugs' Wordy Nugz [28] The prototype allowed players to play puzzles consecutively, and its wordlist was unfiltered [17] At first the game used all 13,000 possible five letter words in the English language, but he found that his partner Palak Shah had difficulty recognizing some of the less common words and made the guessing as haphazard as it was in Mastermind He then used Shah as a simple filter to trim down the word list to around 2,000 words that were more recognizable – roughly five years of puzzles on a daily basis [26] After finishing the prototype around 2014, Wardle lost interest and set the prototype aside [26]\n\n\nEarly development\nWardle created the prototype of Wordle in 2013, inspired by the color-matching game Mastermind, [26] [27] under the name Mr Bugs' Wordy Nugz [28] The prototype allowed players to play

that were more recognizable – roughly five years of puzzles on a daily basis [26] After finishing the prototype around 2014, Wardle lost interest and set the prototype aside [26]\n\n\nRise in popularity\nLater he shared it with his relatives, where it \"rapidly became an obsession\" for them [13] [26] Over the next few months, he continued to share the Wordle website with other close friends, leading to the viral spread of attention to the puzzle by mid-October 2021 [26] In one case, he found that it had become popular with a group of friends in New Zealand, where they had created the emoji-style display of the guesses which they shared with friends, which inspired Wardle to incorporate the feature into the game [29] [17] After he had added this feature, the game became a viral phenomenon on Twitter in late December 2021 [30] [2] [31] A Gale-published article even claims that \"Wordle is less about winning and more about the friends we make along the way\" due to the new ease of sharing [32]\n\n\nAcquisition by the New York Times Company\nOn January 31, 2022, the New York Times Company, the parent company of The New York Times, acquired Wordle from Wardle for an \"undisclosed price in the low-seven figures.\" [43] According to Wardle, the sudden attention he and his partner had gotten over the previous few months had made them uncomfortable, and also he did not feel like spending the effort to fight against clones of Wordle that were appearing Wardle said that \"It felt really complicated to me, really unpleasant\", and that being able to sell the rights to Wordle made it easy \"to walk away from all of that.\" [26] Jonathan Knight of the Times games department contacted Wardle on January 5, 2022, two days after Wordle was featured in a Times article With the acquisition by January 31, chief product officer Alex Hardiman said \"I don't think I've ever seen us move on an acquisition this fast.\" [44] Vanity Fair reported that the Times had just edged out The Washington Post in acquiring the game [44]\n\n\nEditor\nIn November 2022, the Times employed a dedicated editor, Tracy Bennett, to select the word of the day from a curated list [58] [59]\nSpeaking in January 2023 to Today she explained that the words are initially selected by a random system but she then checks each word for suitability She eliminates those \"if there are any, like, secondary meanings that are maybe either profane or derogatory\", and she checks \"to see if there's anything that would make one of those words feel more hurtful or insensitive than normal.\" Bennett also avoids words which are difficult to find because they have four letters in common with many other words, such as \"found\" where there are eight options for the first letter  The words that otherwise cause most complaints has been unfamiliar terms such as \"parer\", \"rupee\" and the US-specific \"condo\" [60] Bennett did introduce the notion that the word can be connected to the day where it is the solution, such as \"BEGIN\" the day Bennett started, \"MEDAL\" on Veteran's Day (November 11), or \"FEAST\" on Thanksgiving (November 24) This type of theme or connection was not present in Wardle's original word list The change was not appreciated by everybody, such as Slate's Lizzie O'Leary, who prefers Wordle to \"stay hard and weird.\" [61]\n\n\nUsage\nWordle was the top Google search term globally and by American users in 2022 [62] [63] Because of the popularity of Wordle, Google searches from players looking to find out the definition of Wordle answers affected top Google search trends Seven of the top 10 searched-for word definitions in 2022 were Wordle answers, including cacao, homer, canny, foray, trove, saute and tacit [62] [64]\n\n\nAdaptations and clones\nAfter Wordle's sudden popularity at the start of 2022, a number of clones appeared Some of these revised the game logic in novel ways Absurdle, created by British programmer qntm, is an adversarial version in which the target word changes after each guess, while remaining consistent with previously revealed hints [65] Other clones retain the game's mechanics while changing the word list These clones range from translations into other languages to guessing swear words in Sweardle and NFL players in Weddle (named after former NFL safety Eric Weddle) [66] [67] Wordle has been ported to older hardware, including GameBoy Wordle for the Game Boy, [68] Wordle DS for the Nintendo 3DS [69] and a Nokia N-Gage port [70]\n\n\nLanguages\nShortly after gaining viral popularity among English-speaking users in January 2022, Wordle was adapted into other languages An open-source version of the basic Wordle game was created by Hannah Park and modified by linguist Aiden Pine to handle other character sets, making the game amenable to more languages [86] Pine also has a free step-by-step blog explaining how to create your own Wordle [87] By October 2024, 780 Wordle-like games and resources had been documented across 158 languages by collaborative project \"Wordles of the World\" [88] Listed are variants based on historical and regional dialects, indigenous languages, languages without alphabetic writing systems (such as Chinese chengyu and American sign language), and constructed languages such as Klingon [89] [90]\n\n\nOthers\nThe New York Times and Hasbro partnered to

that challenges players to guess a five-letter word within six attempts. The game was created by Josh Wardle, a software engineer, and was first released in October 2021. Since its launch, Wordle has become a viral sensation, with millions of players worldwide, and has been acquired by the New York Times Company in January 2022.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nEvery day, a five-letter word is chosen which players aim to guess within six tries. After every guess, each letter is marked as either green, yellow, or gray: green indicates that the letter is correct and in the correct position, yellow means it is in the answer but not in the right position, while gray indicates it is not in the answer at all. Multiple instances of the same letter in a guess, such as the \"o\"s in \"robot\", will be colored green or yellow only if the letter also appears multiple times in the answer; otherwise, excess repeating letters will be colored gray. The game has a \"hard mode\" option, which requires players to include letters marked as green and yellow in subsequent guesses. The daily word is the same for everyone. The game also has a dark theme as well as a high-contrast theme for colorblind accessibility, which changes the color scheme from green and yellow to orange and blue.\n\n**History**\n\nJosh Wardle created the prototype of Wordle in 2013, inspired by the color-matching game Mastermind. The initial prototype, called Mr. Bugs' Wordy Nugz, allowed players to play puzzles consecutively, and its wordlist was unfiltered. Wardle later trimmed down the word list to around 2,000 words that were more recognizable, roughly five years of puzzles on a daily basis. After finishing the prototype around 2014, Wardle lost interest and set the prototype aside.\n\n**Rise in Popularity**\n\nLater, Wardle shared the Wordle website with his relatives, where it \"rapidly became an obsession\" for them. Over the next few months, he continued to share the Wordle website with other close friends, leading to the viral spread of attention to the puzzle by mid-October 2021. In one case, he found that it had become popular with a group of friends in New Zealand, where they had created the emoji-style display of the guesses which they shared with friends, which inspired Wardle to incorporate the feature into the game. After he had added this feature, the game became a viral phenomenon on Twitter in late December 2021.\n\n**Acquisition by the New York Times Company**\n\nOn January 31, 2022, the New York Times Company, the parent company of The New York Times, acquired Wordle from Wardle for an \"undisclosed price in the low-seven figures.\" According to Wardle, the sudden attention he and his partner had gotten over the previous few months had made them uncomfortable, and also he did not feel like spending the effort to fight against clones of Wordle that were appearing. Wardle said that \"It felt really complicated to me, really unpleasant\", and that being able to sell the rights to Wordle made it easy \"to walk away from all of that.\"\n\n**Editor**\n\nIn November 2022, the Times employed a dedicated editor, Tracy Bennett, to select the word of the day from a curated list. Speaking in January 2023 to Today, she explained that the words are initially selected by a random system but she then checks each word for suitability. She eliminates those \"if there are any, like, secondary meanings that are maybe either profane or derogatory\", and she checks \"to see if there's anything that would make one of those words feel more hurtful or insensitive than normal.\" Bennett also avoids words which are difficult to find because they have four letters in common with many other words, such as \"found\" where there are eight options for the first letter. The words that otherwise cause most complaints have been unfamiliar terms such as \"parer\", \"rupee\", and the US-specific \"condo.\" Bennett did introduce the notion that the word can be connected to the day where it is the solution, such as \"BEGIN\" the day Bennett started, \"MEDAL\" on Veteran's Day (November 11), or \"FEAST\" on Thanksgiving (November 24). This type of theme or connection was not present in Wardle's original word list.\n\n**Usage**\n\nWordle was the top Google search term globally and by American users in 2022. Because of the popularity of Wordle, Google searches from players looking to find out the definition of Wordle answers affected top Google search trends. Seven of the top 10 searched-for word definitions in 2022 were Wordle answers, including cacao, homer, canny, foray, trove, saute, and tacit.\n\n**Adaptations and Clones**\n\nAfter Wordle's sudden popularity at the start of 2022, a number of clones appeared. Some of these revised the game logic in novel ways. Absurdle, created by British programmer qntm, is an adversarial version in which the target word changes after each guess, while remaining consistent with previously revealed hints. Other clones retain the game's mechanics while changing the word list. These clones range from translations into other languages to guessing swear words in Sweardle and NFL players in Weddle (named after former NFL safety Eric Weddle). Wordle has been ported to older hardware, including GameBoy Wordle for the Game Boy, Wordle DS for the Nintendo 3DS, and a Nokia N-Gage port.\n\n**Languages**\n\nShortly after gaining viral popularity among English-speaking users in January 2022, Wordle was adapted into other languages. An open-source version of the basic Wordle game was created by Hannah Park and modified by linguist Aiden Pine to handle other character sets, making the game amenable to more languages. Pine also has a free step-by-step blog explaining how to create your own Wordle. By October 2024, 780 Wordle-like games and resources had been documented across 158 languages by collaborative project \"Wordles of the World.\" Listed are variants based on historical and regional dialects, indigenous languages, languages without alphabetic writing systems (such as Chinese chengyu and American sign language), and constructed languages such as Klingon.\n\n**Others**\n\nThe New York Times and Hasbro partnered to create Wordle: The Party Game, a board game based on the browser video game. It is a variant for two to four players, in which one player selects a secret word each round for other players to guess, following Wordle rules. The game was released in October 2022. Polygon's Charlie Hall described the physical game as a \"cut-and-paste job\" simply replicating the online game's mechanics without enhancing it for multiple players as a party game.\n\nWordle has become a global phenomenon, with millions of players worldwide.

known for playing an attractive brand of passing football (which had taken Doncaster Rovers into the league's second tier for the first time since the 1950s) and what football fans would consider the

At the same meeting, it was agreed that the club would purchase twelve tasselled caps coloured 'Garibaldi Red', named after the Italian leader of the 'Redshirts' fighters. This decision established the club's official colours.\n\nThe club's early years were marked by success, with Forest winning the Midland Counties League in 1892-93. However, the club's fortunes declined in the 20th century, with Forest being relegated to the Second Division in 1905-06.

Forest regained First Division status in 1957.\n\nBrian Clough and Peter Taylor (1975-1982)\n--------------------------------------\n\nBrian Clough became manager of Forest on 6 January 1975, twelve weeks after the end of his 44-day tenure as manager of Leeds United. Clough brought Jimmy Gordon to be his club trainer, as Gordon had been for him at Derby County and Leeds. Scottish centre-forward Neil Martin scored the only goal in Clough's first game in charge, beating Tottenham Hotspur in an FA Cup third round replay.\n\nClough without Taylor (1982-1993)\n------------------------------\n\nAnderlecht beat Forest in the 1983-84 UEFA Cup semi-finals in controversial circumstances. Several contentious refereeing decisions went against Forest. Over a decade later, it emerged that before the match, referee Emilio Guruceta Muro had received a £27,000 \"loan\" from Anderlecht's chairman Constant Vanden Stock.\n\nFrank Clark (1993-1996)\n-------------------\n\nFrank Clark from Forest's 1979 European Cup winning team returned to the club in May 1993, succeeding Brian Clough as manager. Clark's previous greatest management success was promotion from the Fourth Division with Leyton Orient in 1989. Clark convinced Stuart Pearce to remain at the club and also signed Stan Collymore, Lars Bohinen and Colin Cooper. Clark brought an immediate return to the Premier League when the club finished Division One runners-up at the end of the 1993-94 season.\n\nStuart Pearce and Dave Bassett (1997-1999)\n--------------------------------------\n\n34-year-old captain Stuart Pearce was installed as player-manager on a temporary basis just before Christmas in 1996 and he inspired a brief upturn in the club's fortunes. However, in March 1997 he was replaced on a permanent basis by Dave Bassett and left the club that summer after 12 years. Forest were unable to avoid relegation and finished the season in bottom place. They won promotion back to the Premier League at the first attempt, being crowned Division One champions in 1997-98. Bassett was sacked in January 1999, with Ron Atkinson replacing him.\n\nInto the 21st century below the top-flight (1999-2012)\n------------------------------------------------\n\nRon Atkinson was unable to prevent Forest from once again slipping back into Division One, and announced his retirement from football management when Forest's relegation was confirmed on 24 April 1999, with three weeks of the Premier League season still to play.\n\nAl-Hasawi era (2012-2017)\n-----------------------\n\nThe Al-Hasawi family from Kuwait purchased the club in July 2012. They told the press that they had a long-term vision for the club based on a 3-5 year plan, and after interviewing several potential new managers, appointed Sean O'Driscoll, formerly the manager at Doncaster Rovers and Crawley Town, as the manager on 19 July 2012.\n\nEvangelos Marinakis and Premier League return (2017-present)\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nOn 18 May 2017, Evangelos Marinakis completed his takeover of Nottingham Forest, bringing an end to Al-Hasawi's reign as Forest owner. Incumbent manager Mark Warburton was sacked on 31 December 2017 following a 1-0 home defeat to struggling Sunderland, with a record of one win in seven. He was replaced by Spaniard Aitor Karanka, who arrived on 8 January 2018, immediately after caretaker manager Gary Brazil had masterminded a 4-2 home win over holders Arsenal in the third round of the FA Cup.\n\nClub identity\n-------------\n\nNottingham Forest have worn red since the club's foundation in 1865. At the meeting in the Clinton Arms which established Nottingham Forest as a football club, the committee also passed a resolution that the team colours should be 'Garibaldi Red'. This decision was made in honour of Giuseppe Garibaldi, the Italian patriot who was the leader of the redshirts volunteers.\n\nCrest and colours\n----------------\n\nNottingham Forest have worn red since the club's foundation in 1865.

This decision was made in honour of Giuseppe Garibaldi, the Italian patriot who was the leader of the redshirts volunteers.\n\nNomenclature\n------------\n\nThe club has garnered many nicknames over time. Historically, the nickname of \"the Reds\" was used, as was \"Garibaldis\". \"The Forest\" or the simpler \"Forest\" – as used on the club crest – is commonly used. Another, lesser-used, nickname referring to the club is the \"Tricky Trees\".\n\nStadium\n--------\n\nSince 1898, Nottingham Forest have played their home games at the City Ground in West Bridgford, on the banks of the River Trent. Prior to moving to the City Ground, Forest played their home games at Forest Recreation Ground, then Trent Bridge, and finally the purpose-built Town Ground. Since 1994, the City Ground has been all-seater, a preparation that was made in time for the ground to be a venue for Euro 96, and currently has a capacity of 30,404.\n\nGround history\n--------------\n\nWhilst Notts County is the closest professional football club geographically, Forest have remained at least one division higher since the 1994-95 season and the club's fiercest rivalry is with Derby County, located 14 miles away. The rivalry stems from the 1898 FA Cup final when Forest caused a major upset, beating strong favourites Derby County 3-1. The two clubs contest the East Midlands derby, a fixture which has taken on even greater significance since the inception of the Brian Clough Trophy in 2007.\n\nManagers\n---------\n\nInformation correct as of match played 28 September 2024.

{"title": "Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "content": "\nSection 1: Citizenship and civil rights\nSection 1 All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n\n\nBackground\nSection 1 [5] of the amendment formally defines United States citizenship and also protects various civil rights from being abridged or denied by any state or state actor Abridgment or denial of those civil rights by private persons is not addressed by this amendment The Supreme Court held in Civil Rights Cases (1883) [6] that the amendment was limited to \"state action\" and, therefore, did not authorize the Congress to outlaw racial discrimination by private individuals or organizations However, Congress can sometimes reach such discrimination via other parts of the Constitution such as the Commerce Clause which Congress used to enact the Civil Rights Act of 1964—the Supreme Court upheld this approach in Heart of Atlanta Motel v United States (1964).\n\n\nCitizenship Clause\nThe Citizenship Clause overruled the Supreme Court's Dred Scott decision that black people were not citizens and could not become citizens, nor enjoy the benefits of citizenship [19] [20] Some members of Congress voted for the Fourteenth Amendment in order to eliminate doubts about the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, [21] [22] [23] or to ensure that no subsequent Congress could later repeal or alter the main provisions of that Act [24] [25] The Civil Rights Act of 1866 had granted citizenship to all people born in the United States if they were not subject to a foreign power, and this clause of the Fourteenth Amendment constitutionalized this rule According to Garrett Epps, professor of constitutional law at the University of Baltimore, \"Only one group is not 'subject to the jurisdiction'  [of the United States] – accredited foreign diplomats and their families, who can be expelled by the federal government but not arrested or tried.\" [20] The U.S Supreme Court stated in Elk v Wilkins (1884), with respect to the purpose of the Citizenship Clause and the words \"persons born or naturalized in the United States\" and \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\", in this context:\n\n\nNative Americans\nDuring the original congressional debate over the amendment Senator Jacob M Howard of Michigan—the author of the Citizenship Clause [31]—described the clause as having the same content, despite different wording, as the earlier Civil Rights Act of 1866, namely, that it excludes Native Americans who maintain their tribal ties and \"persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers\" [32] According to historian Glenn W LaFantasie of Western Kentucky University, \"A good number of his fellow senators supported his view of the citizenship clause.\" [31] Others also agreed that the children of ambassadors and foreign ministers were to be excluded [33] [34]\n\n\nChildren born to foreign nationals\nThe Fourteenth Amendment provides that children born in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction become American citizens at birth The principal framer John Armor Bingham said during the 39th United States Congress two years before its passing: [41]\n\n\nLoss of citizenship\nLoss of national citizenship is possible only under the following circumstances:\n\n\nPrivileges or Immunities Clause\nThe Privileges or Immunities Clause, which protects the privileges and immunities of national citizenship from interference by the states, was patterned after the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV, which protects the privileges and immunities of state citizenship from interference by other states [59] In the Slaughter-House Cases (1873), [59] the Supreme Court concluded that the Constitution recognized two separate types of citizenship—\"national citizenship\" and \"state citizenship\"—and the Court held that the Privileges or Immunities Clause prohibits states from interfering only with privileges and immunities possessed by virtue of national citizenship [59] [60] The Court concluded that the privileges and immunities of national citizenship included only those rights that \"owe their existence to the Federal government, its National character, its Constitution, or its laws.\" [59] The Court recognized few such rights, including access to seaports and navigable waterways, the right to run for federal office, the protection of the federal government while on the high seas or in the jurisdiction of a foreign country, the right to travel to the seat of government, the right to peaceably assemble and petition the government, the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, and the right to participate in the government's administration [59] [60] This decision has not been overruled and has been specifically reaffirmed several times [61] Largely as a result of the narrowness of the Slaughter-House opinion, this clause subsequently lay dormant for well over a century [62]\n\n\nDue Process Clause\nDue process deals with the administration of justice and thus the due process clause acts as a safeguard from arbitrary denial of life, liberty, or property by the government outside the sanction of law [67] [68] [69] The Supreme Court has described due process consequently as \"the protection of the individual against arbitrary action.\" [70] In 1855, the Supreme Court explained that, to ascertain whether a process is due process, the first step is to \"examine the constitution itself, to see whether this process be in conflict with any of its provisions.\" [71] In Hurtado v California (1884), the U.S Supreme Court said: [72]\n\n\nSubstantive due process\nIn the final years of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction Era that followed, Congress repeatedly debated the rights of black former slaves freed by the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation and the 1865 Thirteenth Amendment, the latter of which had formally abolished slavery Following the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment by Congress, however, Republicans grew concerned over the increase it would create in the congressional representation of the Democratic-dominated Southern States Because the full population of freed slaves would now be counted for determining congressional representation, rather than the three-fifths previously mandated by the Three-Fifths Compromise, the Southern States would dramatically increase their power in the population-based House of Representatives, regardless of whether the former slaves were allowed to vote [287] [288] Republicans began looking for a way to offset this advantage, either by protecting and attracting votes of former slaves, or at least by discouraging their disenfranchisement [287] [289] [290]\n\n\nProcedural due process\nWhen the government seeks to burden a person's protected liberty interest or property interest, the Supreme Court has held that procedural due process requires that, at a minimum, the government provide the person notice, an opportunity to be heard at an oral hearing, and a decision by a neutral decision-maker For example, such process is due when a government agency seeks to terminate civil service employees, expel a student from public school, or cut off a welfare recipient's benefits [113] [114] The Court has also ruled that the Due Process Clause requires judges to recuse themselves in cases where the judge has a conflict of interest For example, in Caperton v A.T Massey Coal Co (2009), [115] the Court ruled that a justice of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia had to recuse himself from a case involving a major contributor to his campaign for election to that court [116]\n\n\nIncorporation of the Bill of Rights\nWhile many state constitutions are modeled after the United States Constitution and federal laws, those state constitutions did not necessarily include provisions comparable to the Bill of Rights In Barron v Baltimore (1833), [117] the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Bill of Rights restrained only the federal government, not the states [118] However, the Supreme Court has subsequently held that most provisions of the Bill of Rights apply to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment under a doctrine called \"incorporation\" [81]\n\n\nEqual Protection Clause\nThe Equal Protection Clause was created largely in response to the lack of equal protection provided by law in states with Black Codes Under Black Codes, blacks could not sue, give evidence, or be witnesses They also were punished more harshly than whites [127] [128] The Supreme Court in Strauder v West Virginia (1880) said the Fourteenth Amendment not only gave citizenship and the privileges of citizenship to persons of color, it denied to any State the power to withhold from them the equal protection of the laws, and authorized Congress to enforce its provisions by appropriate legislation [129] In this decision the Supreme Court stated specifically that the Equal Protection Clause was\n\n\nState actor doctrine\nBefore United States v Cruikshank, 92 U.S 542 (1876) was decided by United States Supreme Court, the case was decided as a circuit case (Federal Cases No 14897) Presiding of this circuit case was judge Joseph P Bradley who wrote at page 710 of Federal Cases No 14897 regarding the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution: [183]\n\n\nSection 2: Apportionment of Representatives\nSection 2 Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.\n\n\nEnforcement\n\nThe first reapportionment after the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment occurred in 1873, based on the 1870 census Congress appears to have attempted to enforce the provisions of Section 2, but was unable to identify enough disenfranchised voters to make a difference to any state's representation [193] In the implementing statute, Congress added a provision stating that \n\nInfluence on voting rights\nSome legal scholars have argued that Section 2 was implicitly repealed by the Fifteenth Amendment, [198] although other legal scholars contest this claim, [199] and the Supreme Court acknowledged Section 2 in later decisions.\n\n\nCriticism\nAbolitionist leaders criticized the amendment's failure to specifically prohibit the states from denying people the right to vote on the basis of race [203] In 1937, Senator William Borah proposed a Substitute Constitutional Amendment, [204] that included eliminating provisions that penalized those that supported the Confederacy [205]\n\n\nSection 3: Disqualification from office for insurrection or rebellion\n\n\n\nJanuary 6 United States Capitol attack\nOn January 10, 2021, Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, formally requested Representatives' input as to whether to pursue Section 3 disqualification of outgoing President Donald Trump because of his role in the January 6 United States Capitol attack [209] [207]\n\n\nTrump disqualification debate\n\n\nSection 4: Validity of public debt\nSection 4 The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void.\n\n\nSection 5: Power of enforcement\nSection 5 The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article [274]\n\n\nSelected Supreme Court

legislatures in every formerly Confederate state, with the exception of Tennessee, refused to ratify it This refusal led to the passage of the Reconstruction Acts Ignoring the existing state governments, military government was imposed until new civil governments were established and the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified [306] It also prompted Congress to pass a law on March 2, 1867, requiring that a former Confederate state must ratify the Fourteenth Amendment before \"said State shall be declared entitled to representation in Congress.\" [307]\n\n\nSee also\nMr Johnson:

Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution is a landmark amendment that was passed in 1868 and is considered one of the most significant amendments in American history. It was ratified on July 9, 1868, and has played a crucial role in shaping the country's laws and policies.\n\n**Section 1: Citizenship and Civil Rights**\n\nThe first section of the Fourteenth Amendment formally defines United States citizenship and protects various civil rights from being abridged or denied by any state or state actor. It states that all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment was a response to the Civil War and the struggle for racial equality that followed. After the war, many freed slaves were denied their basic rights and were subject to violence and intimidation. The amendment was designed to protect the rights of all citizens, regardless of race, and to ensure that the states could not deny anyone their basic rights.\n\n**Citizenship Clause**\n\nThe Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment overruled the Supreme Court's Dred Scott decision, which held that black people were not citizens and could not become citizens. The clause states that all persons born in the United States are citizens, unless they are subject to a foreign power. This clause has had a significant impact on American law and has been used to establish the citizenship of many groups, including Native Americans and children born to foreign nationals.\n\n**Privileges or Immunities Clause**\n\nThe Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was patterned after the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV, which protects the privileges and immunities of state citizenship from interference by other states. The clause has been interpreted to protect the privileges and immunities of national citizenship from interference by the states. However, the Supreme Court has held that the clause only protects a few specific rights, including access to seaports and navigable waterways, the right to run for federal office, and the protection of the federal government while on the high seas or in the jurisdiction of a foreign country.\n\n**Due Process Clause**\n\nThe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment deals with the administration of justice and acts as a safeguard from arbitrary denial of life, liberty, or property by the government outside the sanction of law. The Supreme Court has held that due process requires that the government provide notice, an opportunity to be heard, and a decision by a neutral decision-maker when burdening a person's protected liberty interest or property interest.\n\n**Substantive Due Process**\n\nSubstantive due process is a doctrine that has been used to limit the power of the government to enact laws that are deemed to be arbitrary or oppressive. The Supreme Court has held that substantive due process protects certain fundamental rights, including the right to marry, the right to bear children, and the right to privacy.\n\n**Procedural Due Process**\n\nProcedural due process is a doctrine that requires the government to follow certain procedures when taking away a person's life, liberty, or property. The Supreme Court has held that procedural due process requires that the government provide notice, an opportunity to be heard, and a decision by a neutral decision-maker.\n\n**Incorporation of the Bill of Rights**\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that most provisions of the Bill of Rights apply to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This doctrine is known as incorporation and has been used to extend the protection of the Bill of Rights to the states.\n\n**Equal Protection Clause**\n\nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was created largely in response to the lack of equal protection provided by law in states with Black Codes. The clause has been used to strike down laws that discriminate against certain groups, including racial and ethnic minorities.\n\n**State Actor Doctrine**\n\nThe state actor doctrine is a doctrine that has been used to limit the reach of Section 1983, a federal law that allows individuals to sue state actors for violating their civil rights. The doctrine holds that only state actors can be sued under Section 1983.\n\n**Section 2: Apportionment of Representatives**\n\nSection 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment deals with the apportionment of representatives among the states. The section states that representatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each state, excluding Indians not taxed. However, if any state denies the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States, or for the members of the Legislature, to any male inhabitant of such state being twenty-one years of age, and a citizen of the United States, or in any way abridges the right to vote, the basis of representation in such state shall be reduced in proportion to the number of such male citizens.\n\n**Enforcement**\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment was enforced through the Reconstruction Acts, which were passed by Congress in 1867 and 1868. The Acts provided for the military occupation of the South and the establishment of new state governments.\n\n**Criticism**\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment has been criticized for its limitations and its impact on the rights of certain groups. Some have argued that the amendment did not go far enough in protecting the rights of African Americans and that it has been used to justify discriminatory laws and practices.\n\n**Ratification by the States**\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment was ratified by the necessary number of states on July 9, 1868. However, the ratification process was not without controversy. Some states refused to ratify the amendment, and others did so under duress.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment has had a profound impact on American law and society. It has been used to protect the rights of millions of people and to establish the principle of equal protection under the law. It has also been the subject of much controversy and debate, and its legacy continues to shape American politics and society today.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\" following this outline:\n\n\nSection 1: Citizenship and civil rights\nSection 1 All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n\n\nBackground\nSection 1 [5] of the amendment formally defines United States citizenship and also protects various civil rights from being abridged or denied by any state or state actor Abridgment or denial of those civil rights by private persons is not addressed by this amendment The Supreme Court held in Civil Rights Cases (1883) [6] that the amendment was limited to \"state action\" and, therefore, did not authorize the Congress to outlaw racial discrimination by private individuals or organizations However, Congress can sometimes reach such discrimination via other parts of the Constitution such as the Commerce Clause which Congress used to enact the Civil Rights Act of 1964—the Supreme Court upheld this approach in Heart of Atlanta Motel v United States (1964).\n\n\nCitizenship Clause\nThe Citizenship Clause overruled the Supreme Court's Dred Scott decision that black people were not citizens and could not become citizens, nor enjoy the benefits of citizenship [19] [20] Some members of Congress voted for the Fourteenth Amendment in order to eliminate doubts about the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, [21] [22] [23] or to ensure that no subsequent Congress could later repeal or alter the main provisions of that Act [24] [25] The Civil Rights Act of 1866 had granted citizenship to all people born in the United States if they were not subject to a foreign power, and this clause of the Fourteenth Amendment constitutionalized this rule According to Garrett Epps, professor of constitutional law at the University of Baltimore, \"Only one group is not 'subject to the jurisdiction'  [of the United States] – accredited foreign diplomats and their families, who can be expelled by the federal government but not arrested or tried.\" [20] The U.S Supreme Court stated in Elk v Wilkins (1884), with respect to the purpose of the Citizenship Clause and the words \"persons born or naturalized in the United States\" and \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\", in this context:\n\n\nNative Americans\nDuring the original congressional debate over the amendment Senator Jacob M Howard of Michigan—the author of the Citizenship Clause [31]—described the clause as having the same content, despite different wording, as the earlier Civil Rights Act of 1866, namely, that it excludes Native Americans who maintain their tribal ties and \"persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers\" [32] According to historian Glenn W LaFantasie of Western Kentucky University, \"A good number of his fellow senators supported his view of the citizenship clause.\" [31] Others also agreed that the children of ambassadors and foreign ministers were to be excluded [33] [34]\n\n\nChildren born to foreign nationals\nThe Fourteenth Amendment provides that children born in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction become American citizens at birth The principal framer John Armor Bingham said during the 39th United States Congress two years before its passing: [41]\n\n\nLoss of citizenship\nLoss of national citizenship is possible only under the following circumstances:\n\n\nPrivileges or Immunities Clause\nThe Privileges or Immunities Clause, which protects the privileges and immunities of national citizenship from interference by the states, was patterned after the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV, which protects the privileges and immunities of state citizenship from interference by other states [59] In the Slaughter-House Cases (1873), [59] the Supreme Court concluded that the Constitution recognized two separate types of citizenship—\"national citizenship\" and \"state citizenship\"—and the Court held that the Privileges or Immunities Clause prohibits states from interfering only with privileges and immunities possessed by virtue of national citizenship [59] [60] The Court concluded that the privileges and immunities of national citizenship included only those rights that \"owe their existence to the Federal government, its National character, its Constitution, or its laws.\" [59] The Court recognized few such rights, including access to seaports and navigable waterways, the right to run for federal office, the protection of the federal government while on the high seas or in the jurisdiction of a foreign country, the right to travel to the seat of government, the right to peaceably assemble and petition the government, the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, and the right to participate in the government's administration [59] [60] This decision has not been overruled and has been specifically reaffirmed several times [61] Largely as a result of the narrowness of the Slaughter-House opinion, this clause subsequently lay dormant for well over a century [62]\n\n\nDue Process Clause\nDue process deals with the administration of justice and thus the due process clause acts as a safeguard from arbitrary denial of life, liberty, or property by the government outside the sanction of law [67] [68] [69] The Supreme Court has described due process consequently as \"the protection of the individual against arbitrary action.\" [70] In 1855, the Supreme Court explained that, to ascertain whether a process is due process, the first step is to \"examine the constitution itself, to see whether this process be in conflict with any of its provisions.\" [71] In Hurtado v California (1884), the U.S Supreme Court said: [72]\n\n\nSubstantive due process\nIn the final years of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction Era that followed, Congress repeatedly debated the rights of black former slaves freed by the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation and the 1865 Thirteenth Amendment, the latter of which had formally abolished slavery Following the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment by Congress, however, Republicans grew concerned over the increase it would create in the congressional representation of the Democratic-dominated Southern States Because the full population of freed slaves would now be counted for determining congressional representation, rather than the three-fifths previously mandated by the Three-Fifths Compromise, the Southern States would dramatically increase their power in the population-based House of Representatives, regardless of whether the former slaves were allowed to vote [287] [288] Republicans began looking for a way to offset this advantage, either by protecting and attracting votes of former slaves, or at least by discouraging their disenfranchisement [287] [289] [290]\n\n\nProcedural due process\nWhen the government seeks to burden a person's protected liberty interest or property interest, the Supreme Court has held that procedural due process requires that, at a minimum, the government provide the person notice, an opportunity to be heard at an oral hearing, and a decision by a neutral decision-maker For example, such process is due when a government agency seeks to terminate civil service employees, expel a student from public school, or cut off a welfare recipient's benefits [113] [114] The Court has also ruled that the Due Process Clause requires judges to recuse themselves in cases where the judge has a conflict of interest For example, in Caperton v A.T Massey Coal Co (2009), [115] the Court ruled that a justice of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia had to recuse himself from a case involving a major contributor to his campaign for election to that court [116]\n\n\nIncorporation of the Bill of Rights\nWhile many state constitutions are modeled after the United States Constitution and federal laws, those state constitutions did not necessarily include provisions comparable to the Bill of Rights In Barron v Baltimore (1833), [117] the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Bill of Rights restrained only the federal government, not the states [118] However, the Supreme Court has subsequently held that most provisions of the Bill of Rights apply to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment under a doctrine called \"incorporation\" [81]\n\n\nEqual Protection Clause\nThe Equal Protection Clause was created largely in response to the lack of equal protection provided by law in states with Black Codes Under Black Codes, blacks could not sue, give evidence, or be witnesses They also were punished more harshly than whites [127] [128] The Supreme Court in Strauder v West Virginia (1880) said the Fourteenth Amendment not only gave citizenship and the privileges of citizenship to persons of color, it denied to any State the power to withhold from them the equal protection of the laws, and authorized Congress to enforce its provisions by appropriate legislation [129] In this decision the Supreme Court stated specifically that the Equal Protection Clause was\n\n\nState actor doctrine\nBefore United States v Cruikshank, 92 U.S 542 (1876) was decided by United States Supreme Court, the case was decided as a circuit case (Federal Cases No 14897) Presiding of this circuit case was judge Joseph P Bradley who wrote at page 710 of Federal Cases No 14897 regarding the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution: [183]\n\n\nSection 2: Apportionment of Representatives\nSection 2 Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.\n\n\nEnforcement\n\nThe first reapportionment after the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment occurred in 1873, based on the 1870 census Congress appears to have attempted to enforce the provisions of Section 2, but was unable to identify enough disenfranchised voters to make a difference to any state's representation [193] In the implementing statute, Congress added a provision stating that \n\nInfluence on voting rights\nSome legal scholars have argued that Section 2 was implicitly repealed by the Fifteenth Amendment, [198] although other legal scholars contest this claim, [199] and the Supreme Court acknowledged Section 2 in later decisions.\n\n\nCriticism\nAbolitionist leaders criticized the amendment's failure to specifically prohibit the states from denying people the right to vote on the basis of race [203] In 1937, Senator William Borah proposed a Substitute Constitutional Amendment, [204] that included eliminating provisions that penalized those that supported the Confederacy [205]\n\n\nSection 3: Disqualification from office for insurrection or rebellion\n\n\n\nJanuary 6 United States Capitol attack\nOn January 10, 2021, Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, formally requested Representatives' input as to whether to pursue Section 3 disqualification of outgoing President Donald Trump because of his role in the January 6 United States Capitol attack [209] [207]\n\n\nTrump disqualification debate\n\n\nSection 4: Validity of public debt\nSection 4 The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts

obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void.\n\n\nSection 5: Power of enforcement\nSection 5 The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article [274]\n\n\nSelected Supreme Court

governments, military government was imposed until new civil governments were established and the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified [306] It also prompted Congress to pass a law on March 2, 1867,

than two months following the death of Gene Wilder, who portrayed Willy Wonka in the 1971 film adaptation [19] The following month, Heyman revealed that the project would not be a third straight adaptation of the book: \"They've done two films, quite different But it's possibly an origin story We're just in the early stages of it, working with a writer called Simon Rich, which is wonderful.\" [20] In February 2018, it was announced Paul King was in negotiations to direct [21] [22] He ultimately decided against completing his Paddington films, as he had been satisfied with his first two films and felt \"it was time to let go and give somebody else a shot\" [23] That year, it was revealed that the film would be a prequel to the events of Dahl's book [24] King grew up as a fan of both the book and the 1971 film adaptation and enjoyed Tim Burton's 2005 adaptation as an adult [25] \"I was a bit nervous because origin stories don't always feel essential, and I was aware this is such a

he said [26] King's hiring as director, as well as the project's title, Wonka, was announced in January 2021 [27]\n\n\nWriting\nAfter being approached by Heyman to direct, King felt the urge to revisit Dahl's book and was surprised: \"I realised that it's also an amazing emotional masterpiece I really wasn't expecting that Or maybe I had forgotten how incredibly touching it is Poor little Charlie suffers so much And you're so rooting for him I found myself in tears at the end of it.\" [28] While looking through Dahl's archives and unpublished material for research, King found that Dahl had expressed interest in exploring Wonka's backstory but never went far with it [29] When writing the screenplay, King did not want to \"reinvent\" the 1971 film, instead he wanted it to be a \"companion piece\" to both the book and the original film adaptation; as such, he decided to set it 25 years before the events of the story [29] [30] He set the story during the 1940s and paid homage to classic European story books [31] He worked closely with the Dahl estate, particularly producer Luke Kelly, who is Dahl's grandson [32] Creating the supporting characters, King was inspired by several of Dahl's other stories: the trio of villains, the \"Chocolate Cartel\", drew inspiration from Boggis, Bunce, and Bean from Dahl's Fantastic Mr Fox; and the character of Mrs Scrubitt was inspired by Dahl's short story \"The Landlady\" [26] He also stated Slugworth's chocolate cartel as being a \"savage indictment of capitalism\", wanting each character to represent a different aspect of greed, whereas Wonka had epitomized generosity and dedicated his life in creating his factory [23] [33] King developed the screenplay with his Paddington 2 (2017) collaborator Simon Farnaby, with additional material from Jeff Nathanson, Simon Rich, and Simon Stephenson [34] [35] He did not consider the film a musical, but \"a movie with songs\", noting that the Oompa Loompas sang in the book and Dahl's usage of poetry [36] He cited Oliver! (1968), Cabaret (1972), Bugsy Malone (1976), and Annie (1982) as inspirations, particularly focusing on Oliver! as he felt Dahl's book was influenced by Charles Dickens [30]\n\n\nCasting\nTimothée Chalamet and Tom Holland were the frontrunners for the title role after King joined the project [37] Donald Glover, Ryan Gosling, and Ezra Miller were previously considered for the role [38] According to Paul King, \"We were pretty open to looking for the right person But, for me, it really was a list of one.\" King was impressed with Chalamet's performances in Call Me by Your Name (2017) and Lady Bird (2017) [28] King offered the actor the part with no audition after seeing his high school performances on YouTube, which proved his vocal and dancing skills [39] Chalamet grew up as a fan of both the 1971 and 2005 films and wanted to portray the character in a different way from Wilder and Johnny Depp: \"It was a total inverse of that Willy Wonka with a demented look in his eye that we all know How would that character have started, to land in a place where he's still childlike but sort of broken?\" [40] King likened Chalamet's Wonka to \"a Charlie Chaplin innocent character, almost like the immigrant tramp figure coming to this world for the first time, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and completely naive – with this childlike wonder but none of the street smarts that he's going to develop over the next 25 years.\" [30] Chalamet was officially cast in May 2021 and was paid $9 million for his involvement [41] [42]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began in the United Kingdom in September 2021, [46] with Seamus McGarvey as cinematographer, Nathan Crowley as production designer, [47] Mark Everson as film editor, and Lindy Hemming as costume designer [44] Filming took place at historic Lyme Regis and Bath, [7] [48] [49] at Warner Bros Studios, Leavesden in Watford, [50] [51] and the Rivoli Ballroom in Brockley, London [52] By December, McGarvey exited as cinematographer with Chung Chung-hoon replacing him [53] Additional scenes were shot in Oxford in December and February [54] [55]\n\n\nPost-production\nGraham Page served as the visual effects supervisor, while Dominic Sidoli served as the visual effects producer Visual effects vendors included Framestore, Outpost VFX, Goldcrest VFX, and Host VFX, providing over 1,163 shots [56] [57]\n\n\nMusic and soundtrack\nNeil Hannon, lead singer of the Divine Comedy, wrote the film's original songs, [44] and the score was composed by Joby Talbot [58] The soundtrack with the original songs and score was released by WaterTower Music on December 8, 2023 [59] [60]\n\n\nRelease\nWonka had special screenings at ShowEast on October 24, 2023, and at the auditorium at Naval Support Activity Hampton Roads on November 19 [61] [62] On November 20, the film had a special premiere in Tokyo, with a red carpet attended by director Paul King, producers David Heyman and Alexandra Derbyshire, and stars Timothée Chalamet and Hugh Grant The film had its world premiere in London, at the Royal Festival Hall, Southbank Centre, on November 28, 2023, [63] and was theatrically released by Warner Bros Pictures in the United Kingdom on December 8, 2023, [64] followed by the United States, on December 15, 2023, in both conventional theaters and in Dolby Cinema and IMAX [65] It was originally set for release on March 17, 2023 [27] [66]\n\n\nMarketing\nThe marketing campaign from Warner Bros Pictures for Wonka began on October 10, 2021, when Chalamet shared a photograph of himself in costume as Willy Wonka The image was posted on Chalamet's Instagram with the caption \"The suspense is terrible, I hope it will last,\" a reference to a famous Wilder line in the 1971 film, [67] [68] which itself is a quote from the 1895 play The Importance of Being Earnest by Oscar Wilde [69] The Guardian noted that the image was met with mixed reception online [70]\n\n\nHome media\nWonka was released for digital platforms on January 22, 2024, in the UK [81] It was released by Warner Bros Home Entertainment on digital download on January 30, 2024, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on February 27 in the US [82] It is available for streaming exclusively on Max as of March 8, 2024 [83]\n\n\nReception\nWonka grossed $218.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $416 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $634.4 million [4] [5] Deadline Hollywood calculated the film's net profit as $182 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs;

announced in January 2021 [27]\n\n\nDevelopment\nIn October 2016, Warner Bros Pictures reacquired the rights to the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (1964) character Willy Wonka from Roald Dahl's estate, with a film in development from producers David Heyman and Michael Siegel [18] The announcement of the project was met with a mostly negative response as it came less than two months following the death of Gene Wilder, who portrayed Willy Wonka in the 1971 film adaptation [19] The following month, Heyman revealed that the project would not be a third straight adaptation of the book: \"They've done two films, quite different But it's possibly an origin story We're just in the early stages of it, working with a writer called Simon Rich, which is wonderful.\" [20] In February 2018, it was announced Paul King was in negotiations to direct [21] [22] He ultimately decided against completing his Paddington films, as he had been satisfied with his first two films and felt \"it was time to let go and give somebody else a shot\" [23] That year, it was revealed that the film would be a prequel to the events of Dahl's book [24] King grew up as a fan of both the book and the 1971 film adaptation and enjoyed Tim Burton's 2005 adaptation as an adult [25] \"I was a bit nervous because origin stories don't always feel essential, and I was aware this is such a beloved property,\" he said [26] King's hiring as director, as well as the project's title, Wonka, was announced in January 2021 [27]\n\n\nWriting\nAfter being approached by Heyman to direct, King felt the urge to revisit Dahl's book and was surprised: \"I realised that it's also an amazing emotional masterpiece I really wasn't expecting that Or maybe I had forgotten how incredibly touching it is Poor little Charlie suffers so much And you're so rooting for him I found myself in tears at the end of it.\" [28] While looking through Dahl's archives and unpublished material for research, King found that Dahl had expressed interest in exploring Wonka's backstory but never went far with it [29] When writing the screenplay, King did not want to \"reinvent\" the 1971 film, instead he wanted it to be a \"companion piece\" to both the book and the original film adaptation; as such, he decided to set it 25 years before the events of the story [29] [30] He set the story during the 1940s and paid homage to classic European story books [31] He worked closely with the Dahl estate, particularly producer Luke Kelly, who is Dahl's grandson [32] Creating the supporting characters, King was inspired by several of Dahl's other stories: the trio of villains, the \"Chocolate Cartel\", drew inspiration from Boggis, Bunce, and Bean from Dahl's Fantastic Mr Fox; and the character of Mrs Scrubitt was inspired by Dahl's short story \"The Landlady\" [26] He also stated Slugworth's chocolate cartel as being a \"savage indictment of capitalism\", wanting each character to represent a different aspect of greed, whereas Wonka had epitomized generosity and dedicated his life in creating his factory [23] [33] King developed the screenplay with his Paddington 2 (2017) collaborator Simon Farnaby, with additional material from Jeff Nathanson, Simon Rich, and Simon Stephenson [34] [35] He did not consider the film a musical, but \"a movie with songs\", noting that the Oompa Loompas sang in the book and Dahl's usage of poetry [36] He cited Oliver! (1968), Cabaret (1972), Bugsy Malone (1976), and Annie (1982) as inspirations, particularly focusing on Oliver! as he felt Dahl's book was influenced by Charles Dickens [30]\n\n\nCasting\nTimothée Chalamet and Tom Holland were the frontrunners for the title role after King joined the project [37] Donald Glover, Ryan Gosling, and Ezra Miller were previously considered for the role [38] According to Paul King, \"We were pretty open to looking for the right person But, for me, it really was a list of one.\" King was impressed with Chalamet's performances in Call Me by Your Name (2017) and Lady Bird (2017) [28] King offered the actor the part with no audition after seeing his high school performances on YouTube, which proved his vocal and dancing skills [39] Chalamet grew up as a fan of both the 1971 and 2005 films and wanted to portray the character in a different way from Wilder and Johnny Depp: \"It was a total inverse of that Willy Wonka with a demented look in his eye that we all know How would that character have started, to land in a place where he's still childlike but sort of broken?\" [40] King likened Chalamet's Wonka to \"a Charlie Chaplin innocent character, almost like the immigrant tramp figure coming to this world for the first time, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and completely naive – with this childlike wonder but none of the street smarts that he's going to develop over the next 25 years.\" [30] Chalamet was officially cast in May 2021 and was paid $9 million for his involvement [41] [42]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began in the United Kingdom in September 2021, [46] with Seamus McGarvey as cinematographer, Nathan Crowley as production designer, [47] Mark Everson as film editor, and Lindy Hemming as costume designer [44] Filming took place at historic Lyme Regis and Bath, [7] [48] [49] at Warner Bros Studios, Leavesden in Watford, [50] [51] and the Rivoli Ballroom in Brockley, London [52] By December, McGarvey exited as cinematographer with Chung Chung-hoon replacing him [53] Additional scenes were shot in Oxford in December and February [54] [55]\n\n\nPost-production\nGraham Page served as the visual effects supervisor, while Dominic Sidoli served as the visual effects producer Visual effects vendors included Framestore, Outpost VFX, Goldcrest VFX, and Host VFX, providing over 1,163 shots [56] [57]\n\n\nMusic and soundtrack\nNeil Hannon, lead singer of the Divine Comedy, wrote the film's original songs, [44] and the score was composed by Joby Talbot [58] The soundtrack with the original songs and score was released by WaterTower Music on December 8, 2023 [59] [60]\n\n\nRelease\nWonka had special screenings at ShowEast on October 24, 2023, and at the auditorium at Naval Support Activity Hampton Roads on November 19 [61] [62] On November 20, the film had a special premiere in Tokyo, with a red carpet attended by director Paul King, producers David Heyman and Alexandra Derbyshire, and stars Timothée Chalamet and Hugh Grant The film had its world premiere in London, at the Royal Festival Hall, Southbank Centre, on November 28, 2023, [63] and was theatrically released by Warner Bros Pictures in the United Kingdom on December 8, 2023, [64] followed by the United States, on December 15, 2023, in both conventional theaters and in Dolby Cinema and IMAX [65] It was originally set for release on March 17, 2023 [27] [66]\n\n\nMarketing\nThe marketing campaign from Warner Bros Pictures for Wonka began on October 10, 2021, when Chalamet shared a photograph of himself in costume as Willy Wonka The image was posted on Chalamet's Instagram with the caption \"The suspense is terrible, I hope it will last,\" a reference to a famous Wilder line in the 1971 film, [67] [68] which itself is a quote from the 1895 play The Importance of Being Earnest by Oscar Wilde [69] The Guardian noted that the image was met with mixed reception online [70]\n\n\nHome media\nWonka was released for digital platforms on January 22, 2024, in the UK [81] It was released by Warner Bros Home Entertainment on digital download on January 30, 2024, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on February 27 in the US [82] It is available for streaming exclusively on Max as of March 8, 2024 [83]\n\n\nReception\nWonka grossed $218.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $416 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $634.4 million [4] [5] Deadline Hollywood calculated the film's net profit as $182 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it sixth on their list of 2023's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\" [84]\n\n\nBox office\nWonka grossed $218.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $416 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $634.4 million [4] [5] Deadline Hollywood calculated the film's net profit as $182 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it sixth on their list of 2023's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\" [84]\n\n\nCritical response\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 82% of 329 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.2/10 The website's consensus reads: \"With director Paul King at the helm and some solid new songs at the ready, the warmly old-fashioned Wonka puts a suitably sweet spin on the classic character while still leaving some room for the source material's darker undertones.\" [92] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 66 out of 100, based on 64 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews [93] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A–\" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled by PostTrak gave it an 85% overall positive score, with 64% saying they would definitely recommend the film [87]\n\n\nAccolades\nIn a September 2023 interview with Total Film, King expressed interest in making sequels, saying: \"Dahl was definitely interested in taking Willy Wonka on There's drafts that didn't really go anywhere, and there's a short story He didn't really write sequels, but this was the one book where he clearly felt there was more in the tank there There's an awful lot more Wonka story that we have that we would like to tell It's not like Dune: Part One where you go, 'This is what’s happening in Part Two.' Hopefully it works exquisitely as a stand-alone movie But I would definitely like to do more And I'd like to spend more time in this world, and meet some more Oompa Loompas.\" [111]\n\n\nFuture\nIn a September 2023 interview with Total Film, King expressed interest in making sequels, saying: \"Dahl was definitely interested in taking Willy Wonka on There's drafts that didn't really go anywhere, and there's a short story He didn't really write sequels, but this was the one book where he clearly felt there was more in the tank there There's an awful lot more Wonka story that we have that we would like to tell It's not like Dune: Part One where you go, 'This is what’s happening in Part Two.'

{"title": "Peter_Sutcliffe", "content": "\nEarly life\nPeter William Sutcliffe was born on Sunday, 2 June 1946 to a working-class family in Bingley, West Riding of Yorkshire His parents were John William Sutcliffe (1922–2004) and his Irish wife Kathleen Frances Coonan (1919–1978), a native of Connemara [9] Kathleen was a Roman Catholic and John was a member of the choir at the local Anglican church of St Wilfred's; their children were raised in their mother's Catholic faith, and Sutcliffe briefly served as an altar boy [10] Sutcliffe was a premature baby, having to spend two weeks in hospital, and his mother was the victim of domestic abuse, making it likely she struggled through her pregnancy under great emotional stress [11]\n\n\nAttacks and murders\nSutcliffe's first documented assault was of a female prostitute, who he had met while searching for another woman who had tricked him out of money [25]  He left his friend Trevor Birdsall's minivan and walked up St Paul's Road in Bradford until he was out of sight [26] When Sutcliffe returned, he was out of breath, as if he had been running; he told Birdsall to drive off quickly Sutcliffe said he had followed a prostitute into a garage and hit her over the head with a stone in a sock [27] Police visited Sutcliffe's home the next day, as the woman he had attacked had noted Birdsall's vehicle registration plate [28] Sutcliffe admitted he had hit her, but claimed it was with his hand [29] The police told him he was \"very lucky\", as the woman did not want to press charges [30]\n\n\n1969\nSutcliffe's first documented assault was of a female prostitute, who he had met while searching for another woman who had tricked him out of money [25]  He left his friend Trevor Birdsall's minivan and walked up St Paul's Road in Bradford until he was out of sight [26] When Sutcliffe returned, he was out of breath, as if he had been running; he told Birdsall to drive off quickly Sutcliffe said he had followed a prostitute into a garage and hit her over the head with a stone in a sock [27] Police visited Sutcliffe's home the next day, as the woman he had attacked had noted Birdsall's vehicle registration plate [28] Sutcliffe admitted he had hit her, but claimed it was with his hand [29] The police told him he was \"very lucky\", as the woman did not want to press charges [30]\n\n\n1975\nSutcliffe committed his second assault on the night of 5 July 1975 in Keighley He attacked 36-year-old Anna Rogulskyj, who was walking alone, striking her unconscious with a hammer and slashing her stomach with a knife [31] Disturbed by a neighbour, he left without killing her Rogulskyj survived after brain surgery [a] but she was psychologically traumatised by the attack [32] She later said: \"I've been afraid to go out much because I feel people are staring and pointing at me The whole thing is making my life a misery I sometimes wish I had died in the attack.\" [33]\n\n\n1976\nSutcliffe committed his next murder in Leeds on 20 January 1976, when he stabbed 42-year-old Emily Monica Jackson fifty-two times [38] In dire financial straits, Jackson had been persuaded by her husband to engage in prostitution, using the van of their family roofing business Sutcliffe picked up Jackson, who was soliciting outside the Gaiety pub on Roundhay Road, then drove about half a mile to some derelict buildings on Enfield Terrace in the Manor Industrial Estate [39] Sutcliffe hit her on the head with a hammer, dragged her body into a rubbish-strewn yard, then used a sharpened screwdriver to stab her in the neck, chest and abdomen He stamped on her thigh, leaving behind an impression of his boot [2]: 30 \n\n\n1977\nOn 5 February, Sutcliffe attacked 28-year-old Irene Richardson, a Chapeltown prostitute, in Roundhay Park [40] Richardson was last seen at 11:15 p.m leaving a rooming house on Cowper Street, saying she was going to Tiffany's, a pub and disco in the centre of Leeds Richardson was bludgeoned to death with a hammer and had been stabbed in the neck and throat and three times in the stomach Once she was dead, Sutcliffe mutilated her corpse with a knife and then arranged her body by neatly placing her knee-length boots over the back of her thighs Tyre tracks left near the murder scene resulted in a long list of possible suspect vehicles [2]: 36 \n\n\n1978\nThe police discontinued the search for the person who received the five-pound note in January 1978 Although Sutcliffe was interviewed about the matter, he was not investigated further and was contacted and disregarded by the Ripper Squad on several further occasions That month, Sutcliffe killed Yvonne Ann Pearson, a 21-year-old prostitute from Bradford, on 21 January 1978 He repeatedly bludgeoned her about the head with a ball-peen hammer, then jumped on her chest before stuffing horsehair into her mouth from a discarded sofa, under which he hid her body near Lumb Lane [2]: 107 \n\n\n1979\nOn the evening of 2 March 1979, 22-year-old Irish student Ann Rooney was attacked from behind at Horsforth College in Horsforth Rooney was struck three times on the head, probably with a hammer, according to Professor David Gee, who examined her at Leeds General Infirmary Rooney's description of her attacker and his car closely matched that of Sutcliffe and his black Sunbeam Rapier, which had been flagged by police numerous times in red-light districts in both Leeds and Bradford In 1992, Sutcliffe confessed to the attack on Rooney, as well as the 1975 attack on Tracy Browne Barbara Mills, Queen's Counsel, who was the Director of Public Prosecutions, decided at the time that it wasn't in the public's interest to add any additional charges against Sutcliffe for the attacks on Browne and Rooney [51] [52] [53]\n\n\n1980\nOn 26 June 1980, Sutcliffe was stopped while driving, tested positive for drink driving and was arrested [59] Whilst awaiting trial for this, due in mid-January 1981, he killed 47-year-old civil servant Marguerite Walls on the night of 20 August 1980 She left her office between 9:30 p.m and 10:30 p.m to walk to her home in Farsley He incapacitated her with a hammer blow to the back of her head as he continued to strike her while yelling \"filthy prostitute\" beside a driveway [60] In order to move her twenty yards from the place of the attack up the driveway and into a high-walled garden, he first tied a length of rope around her neck and tightened it He choked her there, kneeling on her chest, and removed almost every piece of clothing from her once she was dead, leaving just her tights He partially covered the body with grass and leaves before he left.\n\n\nArrest\nOn 2 January 1981, Sutcliffe was stopped by the police with 24-year-old prostitute Olivia Reivers (who received £3,000 from the Daily Express for her story) in the driveway of Light Trades House on Melbourne Avenue, Broomhill, Sheffield, South Yorkshire A police check by probationary constable Robert Hydes revealed that Sutcliffe's car had false number plates; he was arrested and transferred to Dewsbury police station in West Yorkshire At Dewsbury, Sutcliffe was questioned in relation to the Ripper case as he matched many of the known physical characteristics The next day, Sergeant Robert Ring decided on a \"hunch\" to return to the scene of the arrest, and he discovered a knife, hammer, and rope that Sutcliffe had discarded behind an oil storage tank when he briefly slipped away after telling police he was \"bursting for a pee\" Sutcliffe hid a second knife in the toilet cistern at the police station when he was permitted to use the toilet The police obtained a search warrant for his home in Heaton and brought his wife in for questioning [63]\n\n\nTrial and conviction\nSutcliffe was charged on 5 January 1981 At his trial that May, he pleaded not guilty to thirteen charges of murder, but guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility The basis of his defence was that he claimed to be the tool of God's will Sutcliffe said he had heard voices that ordered him to kill prostitutes while working as a gravedigger, which he claimed originated from the headstone of a Polish man, Bronisław Zapolski, and that the voices were that of God [65] [66]\n\n\nCriticism of authorities\nWest Yorkshire Police were criticised for being inadequately prepared for an investigation on this scale It was one of the largest investigations by a British police force [70] and predated the use of computers Information on suspects was stored on handwritten index cards Aside from difficulties in storing and accessing the paperwork, it was difficult for officers to overcome the information overload of such a large manual system.\n\n\nWest Yorkshire Police\nWest Yorkshire Police were criticised for being inadequately prepared for an investigation on this scale It was one of the largest investigations by a British police force [70] and predated the use of computers Information on suspects was stored on handwritten index cards Aside from difficulties in storing and accessing the paperwork, it was difficult for officers to overcome the information overload of such a large manual system.\n\n\nAttitude towards prostitutes\n\nThe attitude in the West Yorkshire Police at the time was one of misogyny and sexist attitudes, according to multiple sources [81] [43] [82] Jim Hobson, a senior West Yorkshire detective, told a press conference in October 1979 the perpetrator: \n\nByford report\n\nThe Inspector of Constabulary Lawrence Byford's 1981 report of an official inquiry into the Ripper case [72] was not released by the Home Office until 1 June 2006 The sections \"Description of suspects, photofits and other assaults\" and parts of the section on Sutcliffe's \"immediate associates\" were not disclosed by the Home Office [84] The Byford Report's major findings were contained in a summary published by the Home Secretary, William Whitelaw, disclosing for the first time precise details of the bungled police investigation Byford described delays in following up vital tip-offs from Trevor Birdsall, who on 25 November 1980, sent an anonymous letter to police, the text of which ran as follows: \n\nPossible victims\nAmongst other things, the Byford Report asserted that there was a high likelihood of Sutcliffe having claimed more victims both during and before his known killing spree Police identified a number of attacks that matched Sutcliffe's modus operandi and tried to question the killer, but he was never charged with other crimes Referring to the period between 1969, when Sutcliffe first came to the attention of police, and 1975, the year of his first documented murder, the report states, \"There is a curious and unexplained lull in Sutcliffe's criminal activities,\" and \"it is my firm conclusion that between 1969 and 1980 Sutcliffe was probably responsible for many attacks on unaccompanied women, which he has not yet admitted, not only in the West Yorkshire and Manchester areas, but also in other parts of the country.\" [85]\n\n\nByford Report\nAmongst other things, the Byford Report asserted that there was a high likelihood of Sutcliffe having claimed more victims both during and before his known killing spree Police identified a number of attacks that matched Sutcliffe's modus operandi and

responsible for many attacks on unaccompanied women, which he has not yet admitted, not only in the West Yorkshire and Manchester areas, but also in other parts of the country.\" [85]\n\n\nCarol Wilkinson case\nOnly days after Sutcliffe's conviction in 1981, crime writer David Yallop asserted that Sutcliffe may have been responsible for the murder of 20-year-old Carol Wilkinson, who was randomly bludgeoned over the head with a stone in Bradford on 10 October 1977,  nine days after his killing of Jean Jordan [88] [89] Wilkinson's murder had initially been considered as a possible \"Ripper\" killing, but this was quickly ruled out as she was not a prostitute [90] [89] Police eventually admitted in 1979 that the Ripper did not solely attack prostitutes, but by this time a local man, Anthony Steel, had already been convicted of Wilkinson's murder [89] Yallop highlighted that Steel had always protested his innocence and been convicted on weak evidence [91] He had confessed to the murder under intense questioning, having been told that he would be allowed to see a solicitor if he did so [92] Even though his confession failed to include any details of the murder, and Ripper detective Jim Hobson testified at trial that he did not find the confession credible, Steel was narrowly convicted [92]\n\n\nKeith Hellawell investigations\nIn 1982, West Yorkshire Police appointed detective Keith Hellawell to lead a secret investigation into possible additional victims of Sutcliffe [100] [101] A list was compiled of around sixty murders and attempted murders not just in Yorkshire but around the country that West Yorkshire Police and other forces thought could possibly be linked to Sutcliffe [100] Detectives were able to eliminate him from forty of these cases with reference to his lorry driver's logs which showed which part of the country he was in when he was working, [102] leaving twenty-two unsolved crimes with hallmarks of a Sutcliffe attack which were investigated further [100] [103] [101] Twelve of these occurred within West Yorkshire while the others took place in other parts of the country [104] Hellawell had also listed the attacks on Tracey Browne in 1975 and Ann Rooney in 1979 as possible Sutcliffe attacks, and it was to Hellawell that Sutcliffe confessed to these crimes in 1992, confirming police suspicions that he was responsible for more attacks than those he confessed to [100]\n\n\nAdditional investigations\nIn 2017, West Yorkshire Police launched Operation Painthall to determine if Sutcliffe was guilty of unsolved crimes dating back to 1964 In December 2017, West Yorkshire Police, in response to a Freedom of Information request, neither confirmed nor denied that Operation Painthall existed [108]\n\n\nYorkshire Ripper: The Secret Murders\nIn 2015, authors Chris Clark and Tim Tate published a book claiming links between Sutcliffe and unsolved murders, titled Yorkshire Ripper: The Secret Murders, [98] It alleged that between 1966 and 1980, Sutcliffe was responsible for at least twenty-two more murders than he was convicted of [98] The book was later adapted into a two-part ITV documentary series of the same name, which featured both Clark and Tate [92]\n\n\nIncarceration\nFollowing his conviction and incarceration, Sutcliffe chose to use the name Coonan, his mother's maiden name [135] He began his sentence at HM Prison Parkhurst on 22 May 1981 Despite being found sane at his trial, Sutcliffe was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia Attempts to send him to a secure psychiatric unit were blocked While at Parkhurst he was seriously assaulted by James Costello, a 35-year-old career criminal with several convictions for violence; on 10 January 1983, he followed Sutcliffe into a recess of F2, the hospital wing at Parkhurst, and plunged a broken coffee jar twice into the left side of Sutcliffe's face, creating four wounds requiring thirty stitches In March 1984, Sutcliffe was sent to Broadmoor Hospital, under Section 47 of the Mental Health Act 1983 [136]\n\n\nPrison and Broadmoor Hospital\nFollowing his conviction and incarceration, Sutcliffe chose to use the name Coonan, his mother's maiden name [135] He began his sentence at HM Prison Parkhurst on 22 May 1981 Despite being found sane at his trial, Sutcliffe was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia Attempts to send him to a secure

was born on Sunday, 2 June 1946 to a working-class family in Bingley, West Riding of Yorkshire His parents were John William Sutcliffe (1922–2004) and his Irish wife Kathleen Frances Coonan (1919–1978), a native of Connemara [9] Kathleen was a Roman Catholic and John was a member of the choir at the local Anglican church of St Wilfred's; their children were raised in their mother's Catholic faith, and Sutcliffe briefly served as an altar boy [10] Sutcliffe was a premature baby, having to spend two weeks in hospital, and his mother was the victim of domestic abuse, making it likely she struggled through her pregnancy under great emotional stress [11]\n\n\nAttacks and murders\nSutcliffe's first documented assault was of a female prostitute, who he had met while searching for another woman who had tricked him out of money [25]  He left his friend Trevor Birdsall's minivan and walked up St Paul's Road in Bradford until he was out of sight [26] When Sutcliffe returned, he was out of breath, as if he had been running; he told Birdsall to drive off quickly Sutcliffe said he had followed a prostitute into a garage and hit her over the head with a stone in a sock [27] Police visited Sutcliffe's home the next day, as the woman he had attacked had noted Birdsall's vehicle registration plate [28] Sutcliffe admitted he had hit her, but claimed it was with his hand [29] The police told him he was \"very lucky\", as the woman did not want to press charges [30]\n\n\n1969\nSutcliffe's first documented assault was of a female prostitute, who he had met while searching

The police told him he was \"very lucky\", as the woman did not want to press charges [30]\n\n\n1975\nSutcliffe committed his second assault on the night of 5 July 1975 in Keighley He attacked 36-year-old Anna Rogulskyj, who was walking alone, striking her unconscious with a hammer and slashing her stomach with a knife [31] Disturbed by a neighbour, he left without killing her Rogulskyj survived after brain surgery [a] but she was psychologically traumatised by the attack [32] She later said: \"I've been afraid to go out much because I feel people are staring and pointing at me The whole thing is making my life a misery I sometimes wish I had died in the attack.\" [33]\n\n\n1976\nSutcliffe committed his next murder in Leeds on 20 January 1976, when he stabbed 42-year-old Emily Monica Jackson fifty-two times [38] In dire financial straits, Jackson had been persuaded by her husband to engage in prostitution, using the van of their family roofing business Sutcliffe picked up Jackson, who was soliciting outside the Gaiety pub on Roundhay Road, then drove about half a mile to some derelict buildings on Enfield Terrace in the Manor Industrial Estate [39] Sutcliffe hit her on the head with a hammer, dragged her body into a rubbish-strewn yard, then used a sharpened screwdriver to stab her in the neck, chest and abdomen He stamped on her thigh, leaving behind an impression of his boot [2]: 30 \n\n\n1977\nOn 5 February, Sutcliffe attacked 28-year-old Irene Richardson, a Chapeltown prostitute, in Roundhay Park [40] Richardson was last seen at 11:15 p.m leaving a rooming house on Cowper Street, saying she was going to Tiffany's, a pub and disco in the centre of Leeds Richardson was bludgeoned to death with a hammer and had been stabbed in the neck and throat and three times in the stomach Once she was dead, Sutcliffe mutilated her corpse with a knife and then arranged her body by neatly placing her knee-length boots over the back of her thighs Tyre tracks left near the murder scene resulted in a long list of possible suspect vehicles [2]: 36 \n\n\n1978\nThe police discontinued the search for the person who received the five-pound note in January 1978 Although Sutcliffe was interviewed about the matter, he was not investigated further and was contacted and disregarded by the Ripper Squad on several further occasions That month, Sutcliffe killed Yvonne Ann Pearson, a 21-year-old prostitute from Bradford, on 21 January 1978 He repeatedly bludgeoned her about the head with a ball-peen hammer, then jumped on her chest before stuffing horsehair into her mouth from a discarded sofa, under which he hid her body near Lumb Lane [2]: 107 \n\n\n1979\nOn the evening of 2 March 1979, 22-year-old Irish student Ann Rooney was attacked from behind at Horsforth College in Horsforth Rooney was struck three times on the head, probably with a hammer, according to Professor David Gee, who examined her at Leeds General Infirmary Rooney's description of her attacker and his car closely matched that of Sutcliffe and his black Sunbeam Rapier, which had been flagged by police numerous times in red-light districts in both Leeds and Bradford In 1992, Sutcliffe confessed to the attack on Rooney, as well as the 1975 attack on Tracy Browne Barbara Mills, Queen's Counsel, who was the Director of Public Prosecutions, decided at the time that it wasn't in the public's interest to add any additional charges against Sutcliffe for the attacks on Browne and Rooney [51] [52] [53]\n\n\n1980\nOn 26 June 1980, Sutcliffe was stopped while driving, tested positive for drink driving and was arrested [59] Whilst awaiting trial for this, due in mid-January 1981, he killed 47-year-old civil servant Marguerite Walls on the night of 20 August 1980 She left her office between 9:30 p.m and 10:30 p.m to walk to her home in Farsley He incapacitated her with a hammer blow to the back of her head as he continued to strike her while yelling \"filthy prostitute\" beside a driveway [60] In order to move her twenty yards from the place of the attack up the driveway and into a high-walled garden, he first tied a length of rope around her neck and tightened it He choked her there, kneeling on her chest, and removed almost every piece of clothing from her once she was dead, leaving just her tights He partially covered the body with grass and leaves before he left.\n\n\nArrest\nOn 2 January 1981, Sutcliffe was stopped by the police with 24-year-old prostitute Olivia Reivers (who received £3,000 from the Daily Express for her story) in the driveway of Light Trades House on Melbourne Avenue, Broomhill, Sheffield, South Yorkshire A police check by probationary constable Robert Hydes revealed that Sutcliffe's car had false number plates; he was arrested and transferred to Dewsbury police station in West Yorkshire At Dewsbury, Sutcliffe was questioned in relation to the Ripper case as he matched many of the known physical characteristics The next day, Sergeant Robert Ring decided on a \"hunch\" to return to the scene of the arrest, and he discovered a knife, hammer, and rope that Sutcliffe had discarded behind an oil storage tank when he briefly slipped away after telling police he was \"bursting for a pee\" Sutcliffe hid a second knife in the toilet cistern at the police station when he was permitted to use the toilet The police obtained a search warrant for his home in Heaton and brought his wife in for questioning [63]\n\n\nTrial and conviction\nSutcliffe was charged on 5 January 1981 At his trial that May, he pleaded not guilty to thirteen charges of murder, but guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility The basis of his defence was that he claimed to be the tool of God's will Sutcliffe said he had heard voices that ordered him to kill prostitutes while working as a gravedigger, which he claimed originated from the headstone of a Polish man, Bronisław Zapolski, and that the voices were that of God [65] [66]\n\n\nCriticism of authorities\nWest Yorkshire Police were criticised for being inadequately prepared for an investigation on this scale It was one of the largest investigations by a British police force [70] and predated the use of computers Information on suspects was stored on handwritten index cards Aside from difficulties in storing and accessing the paperwork, it was difficult for officers to overcome the information overload of such a large manual system.\n\n\nWest Yorkshire Police\nWest Yorkshire Police were criticised for being

handwritten index cards Aside from difficulties in storing and accessing the paperwork, it was difficult for officers to overcome the information overload of such a large manual system.\n\n\nAttitude towards prostitutes\n\nThe attitude in the West Yorkshire Police at the time was one of misogyny and sexist attitudes, according to multiple sources [81] [43] [82] Jim Hobson, a senior West Yorkshire detective, told a press conference in October 1979 the perpetrator: \n\nByford report\n\nThe Inspector of Constabulary Lawrence Byford's 1981 report of an official inquiry into the Ripper case [72] was not released by the Home Office until 1 June 2006 The sections \"Description of suspects, photofits and other assaults\" and parts of the section on Sutcliffe's \"immediate associates\" were not disclosed by the Home Office [84] The Byford Report's major findings were contained in a summary published by the Home Secretary, William Whitelaw, disclosing for the first time precise details of the bungled police investigation Byford described delays in following up vital tip-offs from Trevor Birdsall, who on 25 November 1980, sent an anonymous letter to police, the text of which ran as follows: \n\nPossible victims\nAmongst other things, the Byford Report asserted that there was a high likelihood of Sutcliffe having claimed more victims both during and before his known killing spree Police identified a number of attacks that matched Sutcliffe's modus operandi and tried to question the killer, but he was never charged with other crimes Referring to the period between 1969, when Sutcliffe first came to the attention of police, and 1975, the year of his first documented murder, the report states, \"There is a curious and unexplained lull in Sutcliffe's criminal activities,\" and \"it is my firm conclusion that between 1969 and 1980 Sutcliffe was probably responsible for many attacks on unaccompanied women, which he has not yet admitted, not only in the West Yorkshire and Manchester areas, but also in other parts of the country.\" [85]\n\n\nByford Report\nAmongst other things, the Byford Report asserted that there was a high likelihood of Sutcliffe having claimed more victims

has not yet admitted, not only in the West Yorkshire and Manchester areas, but also in other parts of the country.\" [85]\n\n\nCarol Wilkinson case\nOnly days after Sutcliffe's conviction in 1981, crime writer David Yallop asserted that Sutcliffe may have been responsible for the murder of 20-year-old Carol Wilkinson, who was randomly bludgeoned over the head with a stone in Bradford on 10 October 1977,  nine days after his killing of Jean Jordan [88] [89] Wilkinson's murder had initially been considered as a possible \"Ripper\" killing, but this was quickly ruled out as she was not a prostitute [90] [89] Police eventually admitted in 1979 that the Ripper did not solely attack prostitutes, but by this time a local man, Anthony Steel, had already been convicted of Wilkinson's murder [89] Yallop highlighted that Steel had always protested his innocence and been convicted on weak evidence [91] He had confessed to the murder under intense questioning, having been told that he would be allowed to see a solicitor if he did so [92] Even though his confession failed to include any details of the murder, and Ripper detective Jim Hobson testified at trial that he did not find the confession credible, Steel was narrowly convicted [92]\n\n\nKeith Hellawell investigations\nIn 1982, West Yorkshire Police appointed detective Keith Hellawell to lead a secret investigation into possible additional victims of Sutcliffe [100] [101] A list was compiled of around sixty murders and attempted murders not just in Yorkshire but around the country that West Yorkshire Police and other forces thought could possibly be linked to Sutcliffe [100] Detectives were able to eliminate him from forty of these cases with reference to his lorry driver's logs which showed which part of the country he was in when he was working, [102] leaving twenty-two unsolved crimes with hallmarks of a Sutcliffe attack which were investigated further [100] [103] [101] Twelve of these occurred within West Yorkshire while the others took place in other parts of the country [104] Hellawell had also listed the attacks on Tracey Browne in 1975 and Ann Rooney in 1979 as possible Sutcliffe attacks, and it was to Hellawell that Sutcliffe confessed to these crimes in 1992, confirming police suspicions that he was responsible for more attacks than those he confessed to [100]\n\n\nAdditional investigations\nIn 2017, West Yorkshire Police launched Operation Painthall to determine if Sutcliffe was guilty of unsolved crimes dating back to 1964 In December 2017, West Yorkshire Police, in response to a Freedom of Information request, neither confirmed nor denied that Operation Painthall existed [108]\n\n\nYorkshire Ripper: The Secret Murders\nIn 2015, authors Chris Clark and Tim Tate published a book claiming links between Sutcliffe and unsolved murders, titled Yorkshire Ripper: The Secret Murders, [98] It alleged that between 1966 and 1980, Sutcliffe was responsible for at least twenty-two more murders than he was convicted of [98] The book was later adapted into a two-part ITV documentary series of the same name, which featured both Clark and Tate [92]\n\n\nIncarceration\nFollowing his conviction and incarceration, Sutcliffe chose to use the name Coonan, his mother's maiden name [135] He began his sentence at HM Prison Parkhurst on 22 May 1981 Despite being found sane at his trial, Sutcliffe was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia Attempts to send him to a secure psychiatric unit were blocked While at Parkhurst he was seriously assaulted by James Costello, a 35-year-old career criminal with several convictions for violence; on 10 January 1983, he followed Sutcliffe into a recess of F2, the hospital wing at Parkhurst, and plunged a broken coffee jar twice into the left side of Sutcliffe's face, creating four wounds requiring thirty stitches In March 1984, Sutcliffe was sent to Broadmoor Hospital, under Section 47 of the Mental Health Act 1983 [136]\n\n\nPrison and Broadmoor Hospital\nFollowing his conviction and incarceration, Sutcliffe chose to use the name Coonan, his mother's maiden name [135] He began his sentence at HM

{"title": "B._R._Ambedkar", "content": "\nEarly life and education\nAmbedkar was  born on 14 April 1891 in the town and military cantonment of Mhow (now officially known as Dr Ambedkar Nagar, Madhya Pradesh) [3] He was the 14th and last child of Ramji Maloji Sakpal, an army officer who held the rank of Subedar, and Bhimabai Sakpal, daughter of Laxman Murbadkar [4] His family was of Marathi background from the town of Ambadawe (Mandangad taluka) in Ratnagiri district of modern-day Maharashtra Ambedkar was born into a Mahar (dalit) caste, who were treated as untouchables and subjected to socio-economic discrimination [5] Ambedkar's ancestors had long worked for the army of the British East India Company, and his father served in the British Indian Army at the Mhow cantonment [6]\nAlthough they attended school, Ambedkar and other untouchable children were segregated and given little attention or help by teachers They were not allowed to sit inside the class When they needed to drink water, someone from a higher caste had to pour that water from a height as they were not allowed to touch either the water or the vessel that contained it This task was usually performed for the young Ambedkar by the school peon, and if the peon was not available then he had to go without water; he described the situation later in his writings as \"No peon, No Water\" [7] He was required to sit on a gunny sack which he had to take home with him [8]\n\n\nEducation\nIn 1897, Ambedkar's family moved to Mumbai where Ambedkar became the only untouchable enrolled at Elphinstone High School In 1906, when he was about 15 years old, he married a nine-year-old girl, Ramabai The match was arranged  by the couple's parents, in accordance with prevailing custom at that time [18]\n\n\nOpposition to untouchability\nAs Ambedkar was educated by the Princely State of Baroda, he was bound to serve it He was appointed Military Secretary to the Gaikwad but had to quit in a short time He described the incident in his autobiography, Waiting for a Visa [24] Thereafter, he tried to find ways to make a living for his growing family He worked as a private tutor, as an accountant, and established an investment consulting business, but it failed when his clients learned that he was an untouchable [25] In 1918, he became professor of political economy in the Sydenham College of Commerce and Economics in Mumbai Although he was successful with the students, other professors objected to his sharing a drinking-water jug with them [26]\n\n\nPoona Pact\nIn 1932, the British colonial government announced the formation of a separate electorate for \"Depressed Classes\" in the Communal Award Mahatma Gandhi fiercely opposed a separate electorate for untouchables, saying he feared that such an arrangement would divide the Hindu community [40] [41] [42] Gandhi protested by fasting while imprisoned in the Yerwada Central Jail of Poona Following the fast, congressional politicians and activists such as Madan Mohan Malaviya and Palwankar Baloo organised joint meetings with Ambedkar and his supporters at Yerwada [43] On 25 September 1932, the agreement, known as the Poona Pact was signed between Ambedkar (on behalf of the depressed classes among Hindus) and Madan Mohan Malaviya (on behalf of the other Hindus) The agreement gave reserved seats for the depressed classes in the Provisional legislatures within the general electorate Due to the pact the depressed class received 148 seats in the legislature instead of the 71, as allocated in the Communal Award proposed earlier by the colonial government under Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald The text used the term \"Depressed Classes\" to denote Untouchables among Hindus who were later called Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes under the India Act 1935, and the later Indian Constitution of 1950 [44]  In the Poona Pact, a unified electorate was in principle formed, but primary and secondary elections allowed Untouchables in practice to choose their own candidates [45]\n\n\nPolitical career\nIn 1935, Ambedkar was appointed principal of the Government Law College, Bombay, a position he held for two years He also served as the chairman of Governing body of Ramjas College, University of Delhi, after the death of its Founder Shri Rai Kedarnath [46] Settling in Bombay (today called Mumbai), Ambedkar oversaw the construction of a house, and stocked his personal library with more than 50,000 books [47] His wife Ramabai died after a long illness the same year It had been her long-standing wish to go on a pilgrimage to Pandharpur, but Ambedkar had refused to let her go, telling her that he would create a new Pandharpur for her instead of Hinduism's Pandharpur which treated them as untouchables At the Yeola Conversion Conference on 13 October in Nasik, Ambedkar announced his intention to convert to a different religion and exhorted his followers to leave Hinduism [47] He would repeat his message at many public meetings across India.\n\n\nDrafting of India's Constitution\nUpon India's independence on 15 August 1947, the new prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru invited Ambedkar to serve as the Dominion of India's Law Minister; two weeks later, he was appointed Chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Constitution for the future Republic of India.\n\n\nEconomics\nAmbedkar was the first Indian to pursue a doctorate in economics abroad [71] He argued that industrialisation and agricultural growth could enhance the Indian economy [72] He stressed investment in agriculture as the primary industry of India [citation needed] Ambedkar advocated national economic and social development, stressing education, public hygiene, community health, residential facilities as the basic amenities [72] His DSc thesis, The problem of the Rupee: Its Origin and Solution (1923) examines the causes for the Rupee's fall in value In this dissertation, he argued in favour of a gold standard in modified form, and was opposed to the gold-exchange standard favoured by Keynes in his treatise Indian Currency and Finance (1909), claiming it was less stable He favoured the stoppage of all further coinage of the rupee and the minting of a gold coin, which he believed would fix currency rates and prices [73]\n\n\nMarriage\nAmbedkar's first wife Ramabai died in 1935 after a long illness After completing the draft of India's constitution in the late 1940s, he suffered from lack of sleep, had neuropathic pain in his legs, and was taking insulin and homoeopathic medicines He went to Bombay for treatment, and there met Sharada Kabir, whom he married on 15 April 1948, at his home in New Delhi Doctors recommended a companion who was a good cook and had medical knowledge to care for him [80] She adopted the name Savita Ambedkar and cared for him the rest of his life [81] Savita Ambedkar, who was called also 'Mai', died on 29 May 2003, aged 93 in Mumbai [82]\n\n\nConversion to Buddhism\nAmbedkar considered converting to Sikhism, which encouraged opposition to oppression and so appealed to leaders of scheduled castes But after meeting with Sikh leaders, he concluded that he might get \"second-rate\" Sikh status [83]\n\n\nDeath\nSince 1948, Ambedkar had diabetes He remained in bed from June to October in 1954 due to medication side-effects and poor eyesight [85] His health worsened during 1955 Three days after completing his final manuscript The Buddha and His Dhamma, Ambedkar died in his sleep on 6 December 1956 at his home in Delhi [90]\n\n\nLegacy\nAmbedkar's legacy as a socio-political reformer had a deep effect on modern India [105] [106] In post-Independence India, his socio-political thought is respected across the political spectrum His initiatives have influenced various spheres of life and transformed the way India today looks at socio-economic policies, education and affirmative action through socio-economic and legal incentives His reputation as a scholar led to his appointment as free India's first law minister, and chairman of the committee for drafting the constitution He passionately believed in individual freedom and criticised caste society His accusations of Hinduism as being the foundation of the caste system made him controversial and unpopular among Hindus [107] His conversion to Buddhism sparked a revival in interest in Buddhist philosophy in India and abroad [108]\n\n\nViews\nAmbedkar said in 1935 that he was born a Hindu but would not die a Hindu He viewed Hinduism as an \"oppressive religion\" and started to consider conversion to any other religion [137] In Annihilation of Caste, Ambedkar claims that the only lasting way a true casteless society could be achieved is through destroying the belief of the sanctity of the Shastras and denying their authority [138] Ambedkar was critical of Hindu religious texts and epics and wrote a work titled Riddles in Hinduism during 1954–1955 The work was published posthumously by combining individual chapter manuscripts and resulted in mass demonstrations and counter demonstrations [139] [140] [141]\n\n\nReligion\nAmbedkar said in 1935 that he was born a Hindu but would not die a Hindu He viewed Hinduism as an \"oppressive religion\" and started to consider conversion to any other religion [137] In Annihilation of Caste, Ambedkar claims that the only lasting way a true casteless society could be achieved is through destroying the belief of the sanctity of the Shastras and denying their authority [138] Ambedkar was critical of Hindu religious texts and epics and wrote a work titled Riddles in Hinduism during 1954–1955 The work was published posthumously by combining individual chapter manuscripts and resulted in mass demonstrations and counter demonstrations [139] [140] [141]\n\n\nAryan invasion theory\nAmbedkar viewed the Shudras as Aryan and adamantly rejected the Aryan invasion theory, describing it as \"so absurd that it ought to have been dead long ago\" in his 1946 book Who Were the Shudras? [147] Ambedkar viewed Shudras as originally having been \"part of the Kshatriya Varna in the Indo-Aryan society\", but became socially degraded after they inflicted many tyrannies on Brahmins [148]\n\n\nCommunism\nAmbedkar's views on Communism were expressed in two 1956 texts, \"Buddha or Karl Marx\" and \"Buddhism and Communism\" [151] He accepted the Marxist theory that the privileged few's exploitation of the masses perpetuated poverty and its issues However, he did not see this exploitation as purely economic, theorizing that the cultural aspects of exploitation are as bad or worse than economic exploitation In addition, he did not see economic relationships as the only important aspect of human life He also saw Communists as willing to resort to any means to achieve proletarian revolution, including violence, while he himself saw democratic and peaceful measures as the best option for change Ambedkar also opposed the Marxist idea of controlling all the means of production and ending private ownership of property: seeing the latter measure as not able to fix the problems of society In addition, rather than advocating for the eventual annihilation of the state as Marxism does, Ambedkar believed in a classless society, but also believed the state would exist as long as society and that it should be active in development [73] But in the 1950s, in an interview he gave to BBC, he accepted that the current liberal democratic system will collapse and the alternative, as he thinks, \"is some kind of communism\" [152]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nSeveral films, plays, and other works have been based on the life and thoughts of Ambedkar.\n\n\nWorks\nThe Education Department, Government of Maharashtra (Mumbai) published the collection of Ambedkar's writings and speeches in different volumes [169] The list of Ambedkar's works include the following:\n\n\nSee also\nPrimary sources\n\n\nReferences\nPrimary sources\n\n\nFurther reading\nPrimary sources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**B.R.

Born on April 14, 1891, in the town of Mhow, Madhya Pradesh, Ambedkar was a Dalit, a member of the lowest caste in the Indian social hierarchy. Despite the numerous challenges he faced due to his caste and social status, Ambedkar went on to become one of the most influential figures in Indian history.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nAmbedkar was born into a Mahar family, a sub-caste of the Dalits, in the town of Mhow, which was a military cantonment at that time. His father, Ramji Maloji Sakpal, was an army officer who held the rank of Subedar, while his mother, Bhimabai Sakpal, was the daughter of Laxman Murbadkar. Ambedkar's family was from the town of Ambadawe in Ratnagiri district, Maharashtra.\n\nAmbedkar's early life was marked by the social and economic discrimination faced by the Dalits. He and other untouchable children were segregated and given little attention or help by teachers. They were not allowed to sit inside the class and had to drink water poured from a height by someone from a higher caste. This painful experience was later described by Ambedkar in his writings as \"No peon, No Water.\"\n\nIn 1897, Ambedkar's family moved to Mumbai, where he became the only untouchable enrolled at Elphinstone High School. In 1906, when he was about 15 years old, he married a nine-year-old girl, Ramabai, in accordance with the prevailing custom at that time.\n\n**Opposition to Untouchability**\n\nAs Ambedkar was educated by the Princely State of Baroda, he was bound to serve it. He was appointed Military Secretary to the Gaikwad but had to quit in a short time. Thereafter, he tried to find ways to make a living for his growing family. He worked as a private tutor, as an accountant, and established an investment consulting business, but it failed when his clients learned that he was an untouchable.\n\nIn 1918, he became professor of political economy in the Sydenham College of Commerce and Economics in Mumbai. Although he was successful with the students, other professors objected to his sharing a drinking-water jug with them.\n\n**Poona Pact**\n\nIn 1932, the British colonial government announced the formation of a separate electorate for \"Depressed Classes\" in the Communal Award. Mahatma Gandhi fiercely opposed a separate electorate for untouchables, saying he feared that such an arrangement would divide the Hindu community. Gandhi protested by fasting while imprisoned in the Yerwada Central Jail of Poona.\n\nFollowing the fast, congressional politicians and activists such as Madan Mohan Malaviya and Palwankar Baloo organised joint meetings with Ambedkar and his supporters at Yerwada. On September 25, 1932, the agreement, known as the Poona Pact, was signed between Ambedkar (on behalf of the depressed classes among Hindus) and Madan Mohan Malaviya (on behalf of the other Hindus).\n\nThe agreement gave reserved seats for the depressed classes in the Provisional legislatures within the general electorate. Due to the pact, the depressed class received 148 seats in the legislature instead of the 71, as allocated in the Communal Award proposed earlier by the colonial government under Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald.\n\n**Political Career**\n\nIn 1935, Ambedkar was appointed principal of the Government Law College, Bombay, a position he held for two years. He also served as the chairman of Governing body of Ramjas College, University of Delhi, after the death of its Founder Shri Rai Kedarnath.\n\nSettling in Bombay (today called Mumbai), Ambedkar oversaw the construction of a house, and stocked his personal library with more than 50,000 books. His wife Ramabai died after a long illness the same year. It had been her long-standing wish to go on a pilgrimage to Pandharpur, but Ambedkar had refused to let her go, telling her that he would create a new Pandharpur for her instead of Hinduism's Pandharpur which treated them as untouchables.\n\nAt the Yeola Conversion Conference on October 13 in Nasik, Ambedkar announced his intention to convert to a different religion and exhorted his followers to leave Hinduism. He would repeat his message at many public meetings across India.\n\n**Drafting of India's Constitution**\n\nUpon India's independence on August 15, 1947, the new prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru invited Ambedkar to serve as the Dominion of India's Law Minister; two weeks later, he was appointed Chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Constitution for the future Republic of India.\n\n**Economics**\n\nAmbedkar was the first Indian to pursue a doctorate in economics abroad. He argued that industrialisation and agricultural growth could enhance the Indian economy. He stressed investment in agriculture as the primary industry of India. Ambedkar advocated national economic and social development, stressing education, public hygiene, community health, residential facilities as the basic amenities.\n\nHis DSc thesis, \"The problem of the Rupee: Its Origin and Solution\" (1923), examines the causes for the Rupee's fall in value. In this dissertation, he argued in favour of a gold standard in modified form, and was opposed to the gold-exchange standard favoured by Keynes in his treatise \"Indian Currency and Finance\" (1909), claiming it was less stable.\n\nHe favoured the stoppage of all further coinage of the rupee and the minting of a gold coin, which he believed would fix currency rates and prices.\n\n**Marriage**\n\nAmbedkar's first wife Ramabai died in 1935 after a long illness. After completing the draft of India's constitution in the late 1940s, he suffered from lack of sleep, had neuropathic pain in his legs, and was taking insulin and homoeopathic medicines. He went to Bombay for treatment, and there met Sharada Kabir, whom he married on April 15, 1948, at his home in New Delhi.\n\nDoctors recommended a companion who was a good cook and had medical knowledge to care for him. She adopted the name Savita Ambedkar and cared for him the rest of his life.\n\n**Conversion to Buddhism**\n\nAmbedkar considered converting to Sikhism, which encouraged opposition to oppression and so appealed to leaders of scheduled castes. But after meeting with Sikh leaders, he concluded that he might get \"second-rate\" Sikh status.\n\n**Death**\n\nSince 1948, Ambedkar had diabetes. He remained in bed from June to October in 1954 due to medication side-effects and poor eyesight. His health worsened during 1955. Three days after completing his final manuscript \"The Buddha and His Dhamma,\" Ambedkar died in his sleep on December 6, 1956, at his home in Delhi.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nAmbedkar's legacy as a socio-political reformer had a deep effect on modern India. In post-Independence India, his socio-political thought is respected across the political spectrum. His initiatives have influenced various spheres of life and transformed the way India today looks at socio-economic policies, education, and affirmative action through socio-economic and legal incentives.\n\nHis reputation as a scholar led to his appointment as free India's first law minister, and chairman of the committee for drafting the constitution. He passionately believed in individual freedom and criticised caste society. His accusations of Hinduism as being the foundation of the caste system made him controversial and unpopular among Hindus.\n\nHis conversion to Buddhism sparked a revival in interest in Buddhist philosophy in India and abroad.\n\n**Views**\n\nAmbedkar said in 1935 that he was born a Hindu but would not die a Hindu. He viewed Hinduism as an \"oppressive religion\" and started to consider conversion to any other religion. In \"Annihilation of Caste,\" Ambedkar claims that the only lasting way a true casteless society could be achieved is through destroying the belief of the sanctity of the Shastras and denying their authority.\n\nAmbedkar was critical of Hindu religious texts and epics and wrote a work titled \"Riddles in Hinduism\" during 1954-1955. The work was published posthumously by combining individual chapter manuscripts and resulted in mass demonstrations and counter-demonstrations.\n\n**Aryan Invasion Theory**\n\nAmbedkar viewed the Shudras as Aryan and adamantly rejected the Aryan invasion theory, describing it as \"so absurd that it ought to have been dead long ago\" in his 1946 book \"Who Were the Shudras?\" Ambedkar viewed Shudras as originally having been \"part of the Kshatriya Varna in the Indo-Aryan society,\" but became socially degraded after they inflicted many tyrannies on Brahmins.\n\n**Communism**\n\nAmbedkar's views on Communism were expressed in two 1956 texts, \"Buddha or Karl Marx\" and \"Buddhism and Communism.\" He accepted the Marxist theory that the privileged few's exploitation of the masses perpetuated poverty and its issues. However, he did not see this exploitation as purely economic, theorizing that the cultural aspects of exploitation are as bad or worse than economic exploitation.\n\nIn addition, he did not see economic relationships as the only important aspect of human life. He also saw Communists as willing to resort to any means to achieve proletarian revolution, including violence, while he himself saw democratic and peaceful measures as the best option for change.\n\nAmbedkar also opposed the Marxist idea of controlling all the means of production and ending private ownership of property: seeing the latter measure as not able to fix the problems of society. In addition, rather than advocating for the eventual annihilation of the state as Marxism does, Ambedkar believed in a classless society, but also believed the state would exist as long as society and that it should be active in development.\n\nBut in the 1950s, in an interview he gave to BBC, he accepted that the current liberal democratic system will collapse and the alternative, as he thinks, \"is some kind of communism\".\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nSeveral films, plays, and other works have been based on the life and thoughts of Ambedkar.\n\n**Works**\n\nThe Education Department, Government of Maharashtra (Mumbai) published the collection of Ambedkar's writings and speeches in different volumes. The list of Ambedkar's works include the following:\n\n* \"The Buddha and His Dhamma\" (1957)\n* \"The Untouchables\" (1948)\n* \"Annihilation of Caste\" (1936)\n* \"Riddles in Hinduism\" (1957)\n* \"The Dhamma\" (1957)\n* \"Who Were the Shudras?\" (1946)\n* \"Pakistan or the Partition of India\" (1946)\n* \"What Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables\" (1946)\n* \"Buddha or Karl Marx\" (1957)\n* \"Buddhism and Communism\" (1957)\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list of Ambedkar's works.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"B._R._Ambedkar\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nAmbedkar was  born on 14 April 1891 in the town and military cantonment of Mhow (now officially known as Dr Ambedkar Nagar, Madhya Pradesh) [3] He was the 14th and last child of Ramji Maloji Sakpal, an army officer who held the rank of Subedar, and Bhimabai Sakpal, daughter of Laxman Murbadkar [4] His family was of Marathi background from the town of Ambadawe (Mandangad taluka) in Ratnagiri district of modern-day Maharashtra Ambedkar was born into a Mahar (dalit) caste, who were treated as untouchables and subjected to socio-economic discrimination [5] Ambedkar's ancestors had long worked for the army of the British East India Company, and his father served in the British Indian Army at the Mhow cantonment [6]\nAlthough they attended school, Ambedkar and other untouchable children were segregated and given little attention or help by teachers They were not allowed to sit inside the class When they needed to drink water, someone from a higher caste had to pour that water from a height as they were not allowed to touch either the water or the vessel that contained it This task was usually performed for the young Ambedkar by the school peon, and if the peon was not available then he had to go without water; he described the situation later in his writings as \"No peon, No Water\" [7] He was required to sit on a gunny sack which he had to take home with him [8]\n\n\nEducation\nIn 1897, Ambedkar's family moved to Mumbai where Ambedkar became the only untouchable enrolled at Elphinstone High School In 1906, when he was about 15 years old, he married a nine-year-old girl, Ramabai The match was arranged  by the couple's parents, in accordance with prevailing custom at that time [18]\n\n\nOpposition to untouchability\nAs Ambedkar was educated by the Princely State of Baroda, he was bound to serve it He was appointed Military Secretary to the Gaikwad but had to quit in a short time He described the incident in his autobiography, Waiting for a Visa [24] Thereafter, he tried to find ways to make a living for his growing family He worked as a private tutor, as an accountant, and established an investment consulting business, but it failed when his clients learned that he was an untouchable [25] In 1918, he became professor of political economy in the Sydenham College of Commerce and Economics in Mumbai Although he was successful with the students, other professors objected to his sharing a drinking-water jug with them [26]\n\n\nPoona Pact\nIn 1932, the British colonial government announced the formation of a separate electorate for \"Depressed Classes\" in the Communal Award Mahatma Gandhi fiercely opposed a separate electorate for untouchables, saying he feared that such an arrangement would divide the Hindu community [40] [41] [42] Gandhi protested by fasting while imprisoned in the Yerwada Central Jail of Poona Following the fast, congressional politicians and activists such as Madan Mohan Malaviya and Palwankar Baloo organised joint meetings with Ambedkar and his supporters at Yerwada [43] On 25 September 1932, the agreement, known as the Poona Pact was signed between Ambedkar (on behalf of the depressed classes among Hindus) and Madan Mohan Malaviya (on behalf of the other Hindus) The agreement gave reserved seats for the depressed classes in the Provisional legislatures within the general electorate Due to the pact the depressed class received 148 seats in the legislature instead of the 71, as allocated in the Communal Award proposed earlier by the colonial government under Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald The text used the term \"Depressed Classes\" to denote Untouchables among Hindus who were later called Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes under the India Act 1935, and the later Indian Constitution of 1950 [44]  In the Poona Pact, a unified electorate was in principle formed, but primary and secondary elections allowed Untouchables in practice to choose their own candidates [45]\n\n\nPolitical career\nIn 1935, Ambedkar was appointed principal of the Government Law College, Bombay, a position he held for two years He also served as the chairman of Governing body of Ramjas College, University of Delhi, after the death of its Founder Shri Rai Kedarnath [46] Settling in Bombay (today called Mumbai), Ambedkar oversaw the construction of a house, and stocked his personal library with more than 50,000 books [47] His wife Ramabai died after a long illness the same year It had been her long-standing wish to go on a pilgrimage to Pandharpur, but Ambedkar had refused to let her go, telling her that he would create a new Pandharpur for her instead of Hinduism's Pandharpur which treated them as untouchables At the Yeola Conversion Conference on 13 October in Nasik, Ambedkar announced his intention to convert to a different religion and exhorted his followers to leave Hinduism [47] He would repeat his message at many public meetings across India.\n\n\nDrafting of India's Constitution\nUpon India's independence on 15 August 1947, the new prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru invited Ambedkar to serve as the Dominion of India's Law Minister;

He was a key figure in the Conservative Party and played a significant role in shaping the UK's policy agenda. Born on 5 December 1969, Javid rose to prominence through his work in the financial sector and later became a Member of Parliament (MP) in 2010.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJavid was born in Rochdale, Lancashire, to Pakistani parents who had immigrated to the UK in the 1960s. His family hailed from the village of Rajana in Toba Tek Singh District, in the Sandal Bar region of central Punjab. Javid's upbringing was marked by a strong sense of community and family values, which would later shape his approach to politics.\n\n**Early Political Activism**\n\nAt university, Javid joined the Conservative Party, a decision that surprised many given his family's background. In 1990, aged 20, Javid attended the annual Conservative Party Conference for the first time and campaigned against the Thatcher government's decision to join the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). It was at this conference that he first met TV presenter Jeremy Paxman.\n\n**Banking Career**\n\nJavid had an 18-year City career, during which he rose to become a board member of Deutsche Bank International. He joined Chase Manhattan Bank in New York City immediately after graduation, working mostly in Latin America and overselling Mexican government bonds prior to the Mexican peso crisis. Aged 25, he became a vice president, a role that would set the stage for his future success in the financial sector.\n\n**Political Career**\n\nJavid's entry into politics began in 2009 when the sitting MP for Bromsgrove, Julie Kirkbride, announced that she would be standing down at the next general election in light of the expenses scandal. Javid was elected as the new MP for Bromsgrove in 2010 and quickly made a name for himself as a rising star in the Conservative Party.\n\n**Member of Parliament**\n\nJavid's time as an MP was marked by a series of high-profile roles, including serving as a member of the Work and Pensions Select Committee and later as Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to John Hayes, Minister of State for Further Education at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills.\n\n**Treasury Ministerial Roles**\n\nIn September 2012, Javid joined Osborne's Ministerial team as Economic Secretary to the Treasury.

The Refugee Council and Amnesty International both criticized Javid's plans, saying that they would leave vulnerable individuals at risk.\n\n**Police and Crime**\n\nIn 2018, Javid's first speech to the Police Federation marked a significant shift in priorities for the Home Office. He promised a shift in priorities in a bid to better protect police officers in the next Home Office spending review.

[23]\n\n\nSetting and aesthetics\nThe setting of Sex Education appears to be modern-day Britain, in the fictional village of Moordale, with various elements that serve to place the show in an uncertain time and location Modern technology, such as smartphones, exists, but the show features very few cars from after the 1990s, with most cars featured ranging from the 1970s to the 1990s Police cars seen during the finale of series two appear to follow 1990s aesthetics rather than modern-day police cars The show heavily features older technologies such as CRT televisions and dated household appliances The décor of the Groffs' house is reminiscent of popular 1970s décor; Maeve's caravan is typical of the 1990s–2000s; and the Milburns' house is a more modern décor with a modern, \"American-style\" fridge Moordale Secondary School shows some elements of UK secondary schools but also has a more American high school image According to showrunner Laurie Nunn, the show's aesthetic is deliberate and an homage to the 1980s films of John Hughes [25]\n\n\nRelease\nOn 2 January 2019, the official trailer for the series was released [26]\n\n\nAudience viewership\nOn 17 January 2019,

evocative of those films, and American teen media in general, such as students idling around lockers, non-uniform school dress codes and students sporting letterman jackets [59] [60] [61] [62] In an interview with British GQ, series director Ben Taylor said: \"When  [Laurie Nunn] was writing the script and the world, they tended to be on the whole more American references to the school experience I've seen in film and TV than any British ones There was a tone in the script that was about warmth and positivity It was just a sort of rendering the school experience as a positive thing, which we tend not to do in this country I think it also visually elevates it to a slightly more expansive canvas.\" [63] On the series retrograde setting, notably reminiscent of the 1980s, Taylor explained: \"It was always contemporary .. It was just something we chose not to foreground so much, so that it wasn't about a generation of kids who are obsessed with their phones.\" [63]\n\n\nStyle\nSex Education is often noted for its unique visual language and aesthetics, which employs American teen culture tropes into a British setting [56] [57] [58] Inspired by the filmography of John Hughes and the teen comedies of the 1980s, the series incorporates several elements, motifs and designs evocative of those films, and American teen media in general, such as students idling around lockers, non-uniform school dress codes and students sporting letterman jackets [59] [60] [61] [62] In an interview with British GQ, series director Ben Taylor said: \"When  [Laurie Nunn] was writing the script and the world, they tended to be on the whole more American references to the school experience I've seen in film and TV than any British ones There was a tone in the script that was about warmth and positivity It was just a sort of rendering the school experience as a positive thing, which we tend not to do in this country I think it also visually elevates it to a slightly more expansive canvas.\" [63] On the series retrograde setting, notably reminiscent of the 1980s, Taylor explained: \"It was always contemporary ..

[23]\n\n\nSetting and aesthetics\nThe setting of Sex Education appears to be modern-day Britain, in the fictional village of Moordale, with various elements that serve to place the show in an uncertain time and location Modern technology, such as smartphones, exists, but the show features very few cars from after the 1990s, with most cars featured ranging from the 1970s to the 1990s Police cars seen during the finale of series two appear to follow 1990s aesthetics rather than modern-day police cars The show heavily features older technologies such as CRT televisions and dated household appliances The décor of the Groffs' house is reminiscent of popular 1970s décor; Maeve's caravan is typical of the 1990s–2000s; and the Milburns' house is a more modern décor with a modern, \"American-style\" fridge Moordale Secondary School shows some elements of UK secondary schools but also has a more American high school image According to showrunner Laurie Nunn, the show's aesthetic is deliberate and an homage to the 1980s films of John Hughes [25]\n\n\nRelease\nOn 2 January 2019, the official trailer for the series was released [26]\n\n\nAudience viewership\nOn 17 January 2019,

culture tropes into a British setting [56] [57] [58] Inspired by the filmography of John Hughes and the teen comedies of the 1980s, the series incorporates several elements, motifs and designs evocative of those films, and American teen media in general, such as students idling around lockers, non-uniform school dress codes and students sporting letterman jackets [59] [60] [61] [62] In an interview with British GQ, series director Ben Taylor said: \"When  [Laurie Nunn] was writing the script and the world, they tended to be on the whole more American references to the school experience I've seen in film and TV than any British ones There was a tone in the script that was about warmth and positivity It was just a sort of rendering the school experience as a positive thing, which we tend not to do in this country I think it also visually elevates it to a slightly more expansive canvas.\" [63] On the series retrograde setting, notably reminiscent of the 1980s, Taylor explained: \"It was always contemporary .. It was just something we chose not to foreground so much, so that it wasn't about a generation of kids who are obsessed with their phones.\" [63]\n\n\nStyle\nSex Education is often noted for its unique visual language and aesthetics, which employs American teen culture tropes into a British setting [56] [57] [58] Inspired by the filmography of John Hughes and the teen comedies of the 1980s, the series incorporates several elements, motifs and designs evocative of those films, and American teen media in general, such as students idling around lockers, non-uniform school dress codes and students sporting letterman jackets [59] [60] [61] [62] In an interview with British GQ, series director Ben Taylor said: \"When  [Laurie Nunn] was writing the script and the world, they tended to be on the whole more American references to the school experience I've seen in film and TV than any British ones There was a tone in the script that was about warmth and positivity It was just a sort of rendering the school experience as a positive thing, which we tend not to do in this country I think it also visually elevates it to a slightly more expansive canvas.\" [63] On the series retrograde setting, notably reminiscent of the 1980s, Taylor explained: \"It was always contemporary ..

that the leader of the party receiving the most votes would be put forward as the prime minister candidate [127] As of July 2022, FdI was the first party in the coalition according to opinion polling, [128] [129] and she was widely expected to become Prime Minister of Italy if the centre-right coalition obtained an absolute majority in Parliament, which would be the most right-wing government in the history of the Italian Republic according to some academics [130]\n\n\n2022 general election and aftermath\nIn the run-up to the election, several politicians previously affiliated with Berlusconi's FI joined the FdI electoral lists [135] [136] Notably, they included Giulio Tremonti (ex-PSI and ex-FI, former finance minister), [137] Marcello Pera (ex-PSI and ex-FI, former president of the Senate), Antonio Guidi (ex-PSI and ex-FI, former family and social solidarity minister), Giulio Terzi di Sant'Agata (former foreign affairs minister, honorary president of the PRT), [138] Carlo Nordio (former prosecutor, member of the PLI), [139] and Eugenia Roccella (a former Radical and feminist who later turned into a conservative feminist), [140] among others [141] A general election candidate was sacked after praising Adolf Hitler [142] While he remained a candidate, FdI removed its symbol from his candidature; [143] he was elected in the single-district constituency of Agrigento, Sicilia with 37.8% of the vote [144] In one of Rome's single-seat constituencies, Ester Mieli, a former spokesperson of the local Jewish community and granddaughter of a Holocaust survivor,

Born in Strasbourg, France, Mugler began his career in fashion at a young age, studying classical dance and later formal interior design training at the Strasbourg School of Decorative Arts.\n\n## Early Life and Education\n\nThierry Mugler was born in Strasbourg, France, in 1948. At the age of 9, he began to study classical dance, which would later influence his approach to fashion design. By 14, he joined the ballet corps for the Rhin Opera (Opéra national du Rhin), further developing his skills in dance and movement. As a teenager, he also began formal interior design training at the Strasbourg School of Decorative Arts, where he honed his skills in design and aesthetics.\n\n## Career\n\nMugler designed for the London boutiques Mr Freedom and Mother Wouldn't Like It in the 1960s, showcasing his early talent for fashion design. In 1971, he began designing clothes for Karim, already demonstrating the broad-shouldered, 1940s-derived looks that would become a hallmark of his designs. In 1972, his full-skirted raincoat became a hit, cementing his reputation as a rising star in the fashion world. At the age of 24, Mugler moved to Paris, where he began designing clothes for Gudule, a Parisian boutique. By 26, he was designing for a variety of large ready-to-wear fashion houses in Paris, Milan, London, and Barcelona.\n\nMugler's designs were often characterized by their bold, dramatic, and androgynous style, which challenged traditional notions of fashion and beauty. His use of luxurious fabrics, elaborate embroidery, and avant-garde silhouettes helped to establish him as a leading figure in the fashion world. Throughout his career, Mugler worked with a range of celebrities, including Lady Diana, Madonna, and Kylie Minogue, who helped to showcase his designs to a wider audience.\n\n## Retirement from Fashion\n\nIn 2003, Clarins shuttered the ready-to-wear component of Mugler's brand, citing financial losses. However, the perfume division of the brand remained open, as it continued to be profitable. Mugler left fashion in 2002, stating that \"fashion is beautiful, 3-D art on a human being, but it wasn't enough, which is why I went on to create in other ways.\" He expressed his desire to explore other creative outlets and to focus on his own personal interests.\n\n## Fragrances\n\nMugler's first perfume, \"Angel,\" was launched in 1992 and quickly became a bestseller. The fragrance, which contains a combination of praline and chocolate mixed with a strong accord of patchouli, was a pioneering example of the \"gourmand\" fragrance type. The Angel bottle, designed by the Brosse Master Glassmakers, features a faceted star shape and has become an iconic symbol of the brand.\n\nThe success of \"Angel\" led to the launch of several other fragrances, including \"Angel Muse,\" \"A*Men,\" and \"Womanity.\" These fragrances have been widely praised for their unique blends of scents and their sophisticated packaging. Today, the Mugler perfume division is one of the most successful in the industry, with a range of fragrances available in over 100 countries worldwide.\n\n## Legacy\n\nIn recent years, Mugler's vintage designs have experienced a significant resurgence in popularity, with celebrities such as Lady Gaga and Cardi B frequently wearing and referencing his designs on social media and in music videos. Teen Vogue has noted that Mugler's designs are among the most coveted luxury vintage brands for Generation Z consumers, who are drawn to their bold, androgynous style and their association with the fashion world's most iconic figures.\n\nMugler's influence on the fashion industry extends beyond his designs, however. He has also been a trailblazer in terms of his approach to fashion, which has emphasized experimentation, innovation, and creativity. His designs have challenged traditional notions of beauty and fashion, and have helped to pave the way for future generations of designers.\n\n## Personal Life and Death\n\nMugler was openly gay and a longtime bodybuilder, who continued to work on his physique even after he retired from fashion. In 2019, he stated that he wanted to move on from the Thierry Mugler brand and focus on other creative pursuits. Unfortunately, Mugler passed away in 2022, at the age of 73, leaving behind a legacy of bold, innovative designs and a lasting impact on the fashion industry.\n\n## See Also\n\n* Media related to Thierry Mugler at Wikimedia Commons", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Thierry_Mugler\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nThierry Mugler was born in Strasbourg, France At the age of 9, he began to study classical dance [18] By 14, he joined the ballet corps for the Rhin Opera (Opéra national du Rhin) [19] As a teenager, he also began formal interior design training at the Strasbourg School of Decorative Arts [20]\n\n\nCareer\nMugler designed for the London boutiques Mr Freedom and Mother Wouldn't Like It in the 1960s [22] In 1971, he began designing clothes for Karim, [23] already showing the broad-shouldered, 1940s-derived looks he would become famous for in later years [24] In 1972, his full-skirted raincoat became a hit [25] At the age of 24, Mugler moved to Paris He began designing clothes for Gudule, a Parisian boutique At 26, he began to design for a variety of large ready-to-wear fashion houses in Paris, Milan, London and Barcelona [20]\n\n\nRetirement from fashion\nClarins shuttered the ready-to-wear component of Mugler's brand in 2003, due to financial losses It kept the perfume division open as it was profitable [70] Mugler left fashion in 2002 [71] When asked about the subject, he said: \"Fashion is beautiful, 3-D art on a human being But it wasn't enough, which is why I went on to create in other ways For me, it wasn't the right tool anymore But perfume still interests me\" [72]\n\n\nFragrances\nMugler's first perfume appeared in 1992 and was called \"Angel\" It contains a combination of praline and chocolate mixed with a strong accord of patchouli It would be a part of a new fragrance type called gourmand The Angel bottle, in the shape of a faceted star, was created by the Brosse Master Glassmakers Fans of the fragrance include Diana Ross, Barbara Walters, Eva Mendes and Hillary Clinton [84]\n\n\nLegacy\nIn later years, Mugler's vintage designs saw a significant resurgence among celebrities, including Lady Gaga in the music video for \"Telephone\", and Cardi B who worked with Mugler, often wearing his vintage designs on red carpets and music videos, as well as mentioning the brand in the song \"Wild Side\" [93] [94] His vintage designs are among the most coveted luxury vintage brands for Generation Z consumers, according to Teen Vogue [95]\n\n\nPersonal life and death\nMugler was openly gay and a longtime bodybuilder [98] [99] Following his departure from fashion he became reclusive, went by his first name (Manfred) and began extensive bodybuilding In 2019, he said \"Thierry Mugler\" was a label and a brand, and as such he wanted to move on to other things [71]\n\n\nSee also\n Media related to Thierry Mugler at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\nReferences\n Media related to Thierry Mugler at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Thierry Mugler at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

From its origins in black political consciousness to its current usage as a pejorative, \"woke\" has become a complex and multifaceted concept that evokes strong emotions and opinions.\n\n**Origins and usage**\n\nThe earliest recorded use of the term \"woke\" was in the 1920s by Jamaican philosopher and social activist Marcus Garvey, who wrote \"Wake up Ethiopia! Wake up Africa!\" in his book \"Philosophy and Opinions\" (1923). Garvey's use of the term referred to the need for black people to awaken to their own identity and take control of their own destiny.\n\nIn the 20th century, the term \"woke\" gained popularity among African Americans, particularly in the context of the Civil Rights Movement. It was used to describe the state of being alert to social and racial discrimination and injustice. The term was often associated with the idea of \"staying woke,\" which meant being vigilant and aware of the ways in which racism and oppression operated in society.\n\n**2008–2014: #Staywoke hashtag**\n\nIn the late 2000s and early 2010s, the term \"woke\" began to gain wider usage, particularly among young people and social media users. The hashtag #Staywoke, which was popularized by the Black Lives Matter movement, became a rallying cry for activists and advocates for social justice.\n\nDuring this time, the term \"woke\" was also used in a more casual and colloquial sense, often to refer to being \"alert\" or \"aware\" of something. However, it also took on a more negative connotation, with some people using the term to imply that someone was being overly sensitive or paranoid.\n\n**2014–2015: Black Lives Matter**\n\nThe shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 marked a pivotal moment in the Black Lives Matter movement, and the term \"woke\" became a key part of the movement's lexicon. Activists and protesters used the term to describe the need for people to be aware of the ways in which racism and police brutality operated in society.\n\nThe BET documentary \"Stay Woke,\" which aired in 2016, further popularized the term and its association with the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\n**2015–2019: Broadening usage**\n\nAs the term \"woke\" gained wider usage, it began to take on a broader range of meanings. While it was initially associated with issues of racial prejudice and discrimination, it came to be used by other activist groups with different causes.\n\nThe term was often associated with the idea of \"social justice\" and \"critical race theory,\" which emphasized the need for people to be aware of the ways in which power and privilege operated in society.\n\nSociologist Marcyliena Morgan contrasted \"woke\" with \"cool,\" describing the latter as a state of being \"empty of meaning and interpretation\" and the former as a state of being \"explicit and direct regarding injustice, racism, sexism, etc.\"\n\n**2019–present: as a pejorative**\n\nBy 2019, the term \"woke\" had become a pejorative, used by opponents of progressive social movements to imply that someone was being insincere or performative in their activism.\n\nBritish journalist Steven Poole wrote that the term was used to mock \"overrighteous liberalism,\" implying that those who were \"woke\" were being overly self-righteous or moralizing.\n\nIn this sense, the term \"woke\" was often associated with the idea of \"cancel culture,\" which referred to the practice of publicly shaming or boycotting people who held certain views or engaged in certain behaviors.\n\n**Americas**\n\nThe term \"woke\" is widely used in Canada and the United States to describe overly progressive politics. In Canada, the term was used in a debate on the Law Society of Alberta's 2020 adoption of a rule that made certain Continuing Professional Development (CPD) training courses on Indigenous Canadian history obligatory. A lawyer from the Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms wrote an op-ed arguing that the course was a form of \"wokeness.\"\n\n**Canada**\n\nThe term \"woke\" is also widely used in Canada, where it is often associated with overly progressive politics. In a debate on the Law Society of Alberta's 2020 adoption of a rule that made certain CPD training courses on Indigenous Canadian history obligatory, a lawyer from the Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms wrote an op-ed arguing that the course was a form of \"wokeness.\"\n\n**Latin America**\n\nIn Brazil, the term \"woke\" gained force during and after the 2022 Brazilian general election won by the leftist leader Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The Bolsonaristas – supporters of the former right-wing president Jair Bolsonaro – and parts of the Brazilian center-right accused the left of \"forcing the woke agenda in Brazil\" with progressive policies such as taxing YouTubers, diversity policies, women's reproductive rights, and ideological patrolling by the Brazilian left, called Lulistas.\n\n**United States**\n\nAmong American conservatives and some centrists, \"woke\" has come to be used primarily as an insult.

Wake up Africa!\" [2] [6]\n\n\n2008–2014: #Staywoke hashtag\nThrough the late 2000s and early 2010s, woke was used either as a term for literal wakefulness, or as slang for suspicions of infidelity [2] The latter meaning was used in singer Childish Gambino's 2016 song \"Redbone\" [15] In the 21st century's first decade, the use of woke encompassed the earlier meaning with an added sense of being \"alert to social and/or racial discrimination and injustice\" [7]\n\n\n2014–2015: Black Lives Matter\nFollowing the shooting of Michael Brown in 2014, the phrase stay woke was used by activists of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement to urge awareness of police abuses [2] [25] [24] The BET documentary Stay Woke, which covered the movement, aired in May 2016 [26] Within the decade of the 2010s, the word woke (the colloquial, passively voiced past participle of wake) obtained the meaning 'politically and socially aware' [27] among BLM activists [7] [25]\n\n\n2015–2019: Broadening usage\nWhile the term woke initially pertained to issues of racial prejudice and discrimination impacting African Americans, it came to be used by other activist groups with different causes [3] While there is no single agreed-upon definition of the term, it came to be primarily associated with ideas that involve identity and race and which are promoted by progressives, such as the notion of white privilege or slavery reparations for African Americans [28] Vox's Aja Romano writes that woke evolved into a \"single-word summation of leftist political ideology, centered on social justice politics and critical race theory\" [2] Columnist David Brooks wrote in 2017 that \"to be woke is to be radically aware and justifiably paranoid It is to be cognizant of the rot pervading the power structures.\" [29] Sociologist Marcyliena Morgan contrasts woke with cool in the context of maintaining dignity in the face of social injustice: \"While coolness is empty of meaning and interpretation and displays no particular consciousness, woke is explicit and direct regarding injustice, racism, sexism, etc.\" [1]\n\n\n2019–present: as a pejorative\nBy 2019, [41] opponents of progressive social movements were using the term mockingly or sarcastically, [2] [42] implying that \"wokeness\" was an insincere form of performative activism [2] [43]\nBritish journalist Steven Poole comments that the term is used to mock \"overrighteous liberalism\" [41]\nIn this pejorative sense, woke means \"following an intolerant and moralising ideology\" [18]\n\n\nAmericas\nThe term is widely used in Canada as in the United States to describe overly progressive politics [44] During a debate in 2023 on the Law Society of Alberta's 2020 adoption of a rule which made certain Continuing Professional Development (CPD) training courses on Indigenous Canadian history obligatory, a lawyer from the Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms wrote an op-ed arguing that the course was a form of \"wokeness\" [45] [46]\n\n\nCanada\nThe term is widely used in Canada as in the United States to describe overly progressive politics [44] During a debate in 2023 on the Law Society of Alberta's 2020 adoption of a rule which made certain Continuing Professional Development (CPD) training courses on Indigenous Canadian history obligatory, a lawyer from the Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms wrote an op-ed arguing that the course was a form of \"wokeness\" [45] [46]\n\n\nLatin America\nIn Brazil, the term \"woke\", gained force during and after the 2022 Brazilian general election won by the leftist leader Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva with the Bolsonaristas – supporters of the former right-wing president Jair Bolsonaro – and parts of the Brazilian center-right accusing the left of \"forcing the woke agenda in Brazil\" with progressive policies such as taxing YouTubers, diversity policies, women's reproductive rights and ideological patrolling by the Brazilian left, called Lulistas [47] [48]\n\n\nUnited States\nAmong American conservatives and some centrists, woke has come to be used primarily as an insult [2] [28] [43] \nMembers of the Republican Party have been increasingly using the term to criticize members of the Democratic Party, while more centrist Democrats use it against more left-leaning members of their own party; such critics accuse those on their left of using cancel culture to damage the employment prospects of those who are not considered sufficiently woke [28] [49] Perry Bacon Jr suggests that this \"anti-woke posture\" is connected to a long-standing promotion of backlash politics by the Republican Party, wherein it promotes white and conservative fear in response to activism by African Americans as well as changing cultural norms [28] [50]\nSuch critics often believe that movements such as Black Lives Matter exaggerate the extent of social problems [42]\n\n\nAsia\nIn India, the term is used as a pejorative by Hindutva activists and Hindu nationalists to refer to the critics of the Hindu nationalist ideology who are deemed as \"anti-Hindu\" by the Hindu nationalist organizations such as the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh [60] [61]\nThe term is also synonymous with leftism in news headlines [62] and is commonly used in social media circles by critics of secularism in India [63]\n\n\nEurope\nIn Hungary, politician Balázs Orbán stated that \"we  [Hungary] will not give up fighting against woke ideology\" [64]\n\n\nFrance\nThe phenomenon le wokisme (sometimes translated 'wokeism' [66]) has also seen use in French politics, particularly since the 2022 French presidential election [67] [68] [69] [70] Much of the opposition to le wokisme sees it as an American import, incompatible with French values [66] Then-education minister Jean-Michel Blanquer established an \"anti-woke think tank\" in opposition to what is perceived as an export from the English-speaking world [66] [71] [40] According to French sociologist and political scientist Alain Policar  [fr], the term \"woke\" which originated from African American communities to describe awareness of social injustices, has been used pejoratively by French politicians from the former republican left, the right and the far right to label individuals engaged in anti-racist, feminist, LGBT, and environmental movements [72] This derogatory usage gave rise to the noun \"wokisme\", suggesting a homogeneous political movement propagating an alleged \"woke ideology\" [73] [74]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nIn the United Kingdom, anti-wokeness discourse is driven primarily by  Conservative Party politicians and right-wing media outlets [76] Conservative papers such as The Daily Telegraph and Daily Mail commonly publish articles critical of what they deem to be \"woke\" [citation needed] The Mail on Sunday publishes an annual \"Woke List\" criticising public figures for perceived \"virtue signalling\" [77] [better source needed] The right-wing television channel GB News was proclaimed at its founding to be explicitly \"anti-woke\" [76] Its onetime chairman Andrew Neil has presented a regular segment on the channel entitled \"Wokewatch\", which aims to be a counter-voice to \"woke warriors\" [78]\n\n\nOceania\nDuring the 2022 Australian federal election campaign, both Scott Morrison, then-prime minister and leader of the centre-right Liberal-National Coalition, and Anthony Albanese, the current prime minister and leader of the centre-left Australian Labor Party, insisted they were not \"woke\" [84] Peter Dutton, current Opposition Leader and leader of the Coalition, has also used the term several times before [85] [86] Members of minor right-wing parties, especially Pauline Hanson's One Nation and the United Australia Party, also frequently use the term.\n\n\nReception and legacy\nScholars Michael B McCormack and Althea Legal-Miller argue that the phrase stay woke echoes Martin Luther King Jr.'s exhortation \"to stay awake, to adjust to new ideas, to remain vigilant and to face the challenge of change\" [90] [page needed]\n\n\nWoke-washing and woke capitalism\nBy the mid-2010s, language associated with wokeness had entered the mainstream media and was being used for marketing [38] Abas Mirzaei, a senior lecturer in branding at Macquarie University, says that the term \"has been cynically applied to everything from soft drink to razors\" [3] In 2018, African-American journalist Sam Sanders argued that the authentic meaning of woke was being lost to overuse by white liberals and co-option by businesses trying to appear progressive (woke-washing), which would ultimately create a backlash [39]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is man-made so the press can feed off it.\"\n\n\n1985–1988: Hounds of Love and The Whole Story\nHounds of Love was released in 1985 Because of the high cost of hiring studio space for her previous album, she built a private studio near her home, where she could work at her own pace [57] Hounds of Love topped the charts in the UK, knocking Madonna's Like a Virgin from the number-one position [58]\n\n\n1989–1993: The Sensual World and The Red Shoes\nReleased in 1989, The Sensual World was described by Bush herself as \"her most honest, personal album\" [62] One of the tracks, \"Heads We're Dancing\", inspired by her own black humour, is about a woman who dances all night with a charming stranger only to discover in the morning that he is Adolf Hitler The title track drew its inspiration from James Joyce's novel Ulysses [63] The Sensual World went on to become her biggest-selling album in the US, receiving an RIAA Gold certification four years after its release for 500,000 copies sold In the United Kingdom album charts, it reached the number-two position [64] Another single from the album, \"This Woman's Work\", was featured in the John Hughes film She's Having a Baby, and a slightly remixed version appeared on Bush's album The Sensual World [65] The song reached number-eight in 2005 on the UK download chart after featuring in a British television advertisement for the charity NSPCC [66]\n\n\n1994–2006: Motherhood, hiatus, and Aerial\nAfter the release of The Red Shoes, Bush dropped out of the public eye She had originally intended to take one year off, but despite working on material, twelve years passed before her next album release Her name occasionally cropped up in the media with rumours of a new album release The press often viewed her as an eccentric recluse, sometimes drawing a comparison with Miss Havisham from Charles Dickens's Great Expectations [79] In 1998, Bush gave birth to Albert, known as \"Bertie\", fathered by guitarist Dan McIntosh, whom she met in 1992 [30] [80] In 2001, Bush was awarded a Q Award as Classic Songwriter [81] In 2002, she was awarded an Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, and performed

chart [89] and was nominated for the International Press Academy's Satellite Award for original song in a motion picture [90] According to Del Palmer, Bush was asked to compose the song at short notice; the project was completed in 10 days [91]\n\n\n2014–2021: Before the Dawn and remastered catalogue\nIn March 2014, Bush announced her first live concerts in decades: Before the Dawn, a 22-night residency in London running from 26 August to 1 October 2014 at the Hammersmith Apollo [105] Tickets sold out in 15 minutes The concerts received universal acclaim [106] An album of recordings from the concerts, Before the Dawn, was released on 25 November 2016 [107] Bolstered by publicity around Before the Dawn, Bush became the first female performer to have eight albums in the

in 1977 and the Beatles who had 11 in 2009 [108] [109] She had 11 albums in the top 50 [110] [111]\n\n\n2022–present: \"Running Up That Hill\" resurgence and Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction\nBush's 1985 single \"Running Up That Hill\" gained newfound popularity in May 2022 after it was incorporated into the plot of the fourth season of the Netflix series Stranger Things It became the most streamed song on Spotify in the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and globally [120] [121] [122] Winona Ryder, who plays the character Joyce Byers on Stranger Things, said she had pushed for the song to be on the show: \"I've been obsessed with her since I was a little girl I've also for the last seven years been dropping hints on set wearing my Kate Bush T-shirts.\" [123] According to The Guardian, \"Running Up That Hill\" has become particularly popular with members of Generation Z, who were not born when the song was first released, and it has appeared in numerous videos on the social media platform TikTok [124] Bush released a statement praising Stranger Things and saying the resurgence was \"really exciting\" [124]\n\n\nArtistry\nBush's musical aesthetic is eclectic, and is known to employ varied influences and meld disparate styles, often within a single song or over the course of an album [43] Simon Reynolds of The Guardian called Bush \"the queen of art-pop\", [154] and she has also been described as art rock, [43] [155] baroque pop, [156] avant-pop, [157] [158] progressive pop, [159] [160] and post-progressive [161] Ben Myers of Prog called Bush \"prog's first pop star and pop's first prog star\" whose \"career history and collaborations are inextricably tied in with prog and her ever-evolving output has much more in common with the genre than the pop world in which she first found herself operating.\" [162] She has been grouped with other \"'arty' 1970s and '80s British pop rock artists\" such as Roxy Music and Peter Gabriel [163] Even in her earliest works, with piano the primary instrument, she wove together diverse influences, drawing on classical music, glam rock, [154] and a wide range of ethnic and folk sources This has continued throughout her career By the time of Never for Ever, Bush had begun to make prominent use of the Fairlight CMI synthesiser, which allowed her to sample and manipulate sounds, expanding her sonic palette [19]\n\n\nMusical style and voice\nBush's musical aesthetic is eclectic, and is known to employ varied influences and meld disparate styles, often within a single

who embodies the character singing the song and has dismissed efforts by others to conceive of her work as autobiographical [165] [169] [170] Bush's lyrics have been known to touch on obscure or esoteric subject matter, and New Musical Express noted that Bush was not afraid to tackle sensitive and taboo subjects in her work [171] \"The Kick Inside\" is based on a traditional English folk song (The Ballad of Lucy Wan) about an incestuous pregnancy and a resulting suicide [172] \"Kashka from Baghdad\" is a song about a gay couple; She has referenced G I Gurdjieff in the song \"Them Heavy People\", while \"Cloudbusting\" was inspired by Peter Reich's autobiography, A Book of Dreams, about his relationship with his father, Wilhelm Reich \"Breathing\" explores the results of nuclear fallout from the perspective of a fœtus [173]\n\n\nTechnical innovations\nBush is regarded as the first artist to have had a headset with a wireless microphone built for use in music [182] For her Tour of Life in 1979, she had a compact microphone combined with a self-made construction of wire clothes hangers, so that she did not have to use a hand microphone Having her hands free allowed Bush to dance her rehearsed choreography of expressionist dance on the concert stage and sing with a microphone at the same time Her idea was later adopted by other artists such as Janet Jackson, [183] Madonna and Peter Gabriel [184]\n\n\nInfluence\nAccording to Alexis Petridis of The Guardian, Bush's \"shadow looms so large that whenever a female singer-songwriter emerges who is even remotely out of the ordinary, it's only a matter of time before someone, fairly or otherwise, mentions Bush\" [185]\n\n\nLive performances\n\n\nCollaborations\nBush provided vocals on two of Peter Gabriel's

unknown [272] From the late 1970s to the early 1990s, Bush was in a relationship with bassist and sound engineer Del Palmer [273]\n\n\nPolitical views\nSome of Bush's songs contain references to political and social themes, including \"Breathing\", which addresses the fear of nuclear warfare and \"Army Dreamers\", which examines the grief felt by mothers who lose children serving in the military during war [279] In a 1985 interview with The NewMusic, Bush stated \"I've never felt I've written from a political point of view, it's always been an emotional point of view that just happens to perhaps be a political situation.\" [280]\n\n\nAwards and nominations\nStudio albums\n\n\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n\n\nLive performances\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther

It is man-made so the press can feed off it.\"\n\n\n1985–1988: Hounds of Love and The Whole Story\nHounds of Love was released in 1985 Because of the high cost of hiring studio space for her previous album, she built a private studio near her home, where she could work at her own pace [57] Hounds of Love topped the charts in the UK, knocking Madonna's Like a Virgin from the number-one position [58]\n\n\n1989–1993: The Sensual World and The Red Shoes\nReleased in 1989, The Sensual World was described by Bush herself as \"her most honest, personal album\" [62] One of the tracks, \"Heads We're Dancing\", inspired by her own black humour, is about a woman who dances all night with a charming stranger only to discover in the morning that he is Adolf Hitler The title track drew its inspiration from James Joyce's novel Ulysses [63] The Sensual World went on to become her biggest-selling album in the US, receiving an RIAA Gold certification four years after its release for 500,000 copies sold In the United Kingdom album charts, it reached the number-two position [64] Another single from the album, \"This Woman's Work\", was featured in the John Hughes film She's Having a Baby, and a slightly remixed version appeared on Bush's album The Sensual World [65] The song reached number-eight in 2005 on the UK download chart after featuring in a British television advertisement for the charity NSPCC [66]\n\n\n1994–2006: Motherhood, hiatus, and Aerial\nAfter the release of The Red Shoes, Bush dropped out of the public eye She had originally intended to take one year off, but despite working on material, twelve years passed before her next album release Her name occasionally cropped up in the media with rumours of a new album release The press often viewed her as an eccentric recluse, sometimes drawing a comparison with Miss Havisham from Charles Dickens's Great Expectations [79] In 1998, Bush gave birth to Albert, known as \"Bertie\", fathered by guitarist Dan McIntosh, whom she met in 1992 [30] [80] In 2001, Bush was awarded a Q Award as Classic Songwriter [81] In 2002, she was awarded an Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, and performed \"Comfortably Numb\" at David Gilmour's concert at the Royal Festival Hall in London [82]\n\n\n2007–2013: Fish People, Director's Cut and 50 Words for Snow\nIn 2007, Bush was asked to write a song for The Golden Compass soundtrack which made reference to the lead character, Lyra Belacqua The song, \"Lyra\", was played over the closing credits of the film The single reached No 187 in the UK singles chart [89] and was nominated for the International Press Academy's Satellite Award for original song in a motion picture [90] According to Del Palmer, Bush was asked to compose the song at short notice; the project was completed in 10 days [91]\n\n\n2014–2021: Before the Dawn and remastered catalogue\nIn March 2014, Bush announced her first live concerts in decades: Before the Dawn, a 22-night residency in London running from 26 August to 1 October 2014 at the Hammersmith Apollo [105] Tickets sold out in 15 minutes The concerts received universal acclaim [106] An album of recordings from the concerts, Before the Dawn, was released on 25 November 2016 [107] Bolstered by publicity around Before the Dawn, Bush became the first female performer to have eight albums in the UK Top 40 Albums Chart simultaneously, putting her at number three for simultaneous UK Top 40 albums The only artists ahead of Bush were Elvis Presley, who had 12 entries in the top 40 after his death in 1977 and the Beatles who had 11 in 2009 [108] [109] She had 11 albums in the top 50 [110] [111]\n\n\n2022–present: \"Running Up That Hill\" resurgence and Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction\nBush's 1985 single \"Running Up That Hill\" gained newfound popularity in May 2022 after it was incorporated into the plot of the fourth season of the Netflix series Stranger Things It became the most streamed song on Spotify in the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and globally [120] [121] [122] Winona Ryder, who plays the character Joyce Byers on Stranger Things, said she had pushed for the song to be on the show: \"I've been obsessed with her since I was a little girl I've also for the last seven years been dropping hints on set wearing my Kate Bush T-shirts.\" [123] According to The Guardian, \"Running Up That Hill\" has become particularly popular with members of Generation Z, who were not born when the song was first released, and it has appeared in numerous videos on the social media platform TikTok [124] Bush released a statement praising Stranger Things and saying the resurgence was \"really exciting\" [124]\n\n\nArtistry\nBush's musical aesthetic is eclectic, and is known to employ varied influences and meld disparate styles, often within a single song or over the course of an album [43] Simon Reynolds of The Guardian called Bush \"the queen of art-pop\", [154] and she has also been described as art rock, [43] [155] baroque pop, [156] avant-pop, [157] [158] progressive pop, [159] [160] and post-progressive [161] Ben Myers of Prog called Bush \"prog's first pop star and pop's first prog star\" whose \"career history and collaborations are inextricably tied in with prog and her ever-evolving output has much more in common with the genre than the pop world in which she first found herself operating.\" [162] She has been grouped with other \"'arty' 1970s and '80s British pop rock artists\" such as Roxy Music and Peter Gabriel [163] Even in her earliest works, with piano the primary instrument, she wove together diverse influences, drawing on classical music, glam rock, [154] and a wide range of ethnic and folk sources This has continued throughout her career By the time of Never for Ever, Bush had begun to make prominent use of the Fairlight CMI synthesiser, which allowed her to sample and manipulate sounds, expanding her sonic palette [19]\n\n\nMusical style and voice\nBush's musical aesthetic is eclectic, and is known to employ varied influences and meld disparate styles, often within a single song or over the course of an album [43] Simon Reynolds of The Guardian called Bush \"the queen of art-pop\", [154] and she has also been described as art rock, [43] [155] baroque pop, [156]

make prominent use of the Fairlight CMI synthesiser, which allowed her to sample and manipulate sounds, expanding her sonic palette [19]\n\n\nSongwriting and influences\nElements of Bush's lyrics employ historical or literary references This is embodied in her first single \"Wuthering Heights\", which is based on Emily Brontë's novel of the same name She has described herself as a storyteller who embodies the character singing the song and has dismissed efforts by others to conceive of her work as autobiographical [165] [169] [170] Bush's lyrics have been known to touch on obscure or esoteric subject matter, and New Musical Express noted that Bush was not afraid to tackle sensitive and taboo subjects in her work [171] \"The Kick Inside\" is based on a traditional English folk song (The Ballad of Lucy Wan) about an incestuous pregnancy and a resulting suicide [172] \"Kashka from Baghdad\" is a song about a gay couple; She has referenced G I Gurdjieff in the song \"Them Heavy People\", while \"Cloudbusting\" was inspired by Peter Reich's autobiography, A Book of Dreams, about his relationship with his father, Wilhelm Reich \"Breathing\" explores the results of nuclear fallout from the perspective of a fœtus [173]\n\n\nTechnical innovations\nBush is regarded as the first artist to have had a headset with a wireless microphone built for use in music [182] For her Tour of Life in 1979, she had a compact microphone combined with a self-made construction of wire clothes hangers, so that she did not have to use a hand microphone Having her hands free allowed Bush to dance her rehearsed choreography of expressionist dance on the concert stage and sing with a microphone at the same time Her idea was later adopted by other artists such as Janet Jackson, [183] Madonna and Peter Gabriel [184]\n\n\nInfluence\nAccording to Alexis Petridis of The Guardian, Bush's \"shadow looms so large that whenever a female singer-songwriter emerges who is even remotely out of the ordinary, it's only a matter of time before someone, fairly or otherwise, mentions Bush\" [185]\n\n\nLive performances\n\n\nCollaborations\nBush provided vocals on two of Peter Gabriel's albums, including the hits \"Games Without Frontiers\" and \"Don't Give Up\", as well as \"No Self-Control\" [260] Gabriel appeared on Bush's 1979 television special, where they sang a duet of Roy Harper's \"Another Day\" [261] She has sung on two Roy Harper tracks, \"You\", on his 1979 album, \"The Unknown Soldier\"; and \"Once\", the title track of his 1990 album She has also sung on the title song of the 1986 Big Country album The Seer; the Midge Ure song \"Sister and Brother\" from his 1988 album Answers to Nothing; Go West's 1987 single \"The King Is Dead\"; and two songs with Prince – \"Why Should I Love You?\", from her 1993 album The Red Shoes, and \"My Computer\" from Prince's 1996 album Emancipation [262] In 1987, she sang a verse on the Beatles cover charity single \"Let It Be\" by Ferry Aid [263]\n\n\nPersonal life\nBush and guitarist Danny McIntosh have a son, Albert McIntosh, known as Bertie, born in 1998, [270] [271] although whether they are married is unknown [272] From the late 1970s to the early 1990s, Bush was in a relationship with bassist and sound engineer Del Palmer [273]\n\n\nPolitical views\nSome of Bush's songs contain references to political and social themes, including \"Breathing\", which addresses the fear of nuclear warfare and \"Army Dreamers\", which examines the grief felt by mothers who lose children serving in the military during war [279] In a 1985 interview with The NewMusic, Bush stated \"I've never felt I've written from a political point of view, it's always been an emotional point of view that just happens to perhaps be a political situation.\" [280]\n\n\nAwards and nominations\nStudio albums\n\n\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n\n\nLive performances\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther

{"title": "Cyclone_Yaas", "content": "\nMeteorological history\nOn May 22, a low-pressure area formed in the Bay of Bengal On the next day, at 09:30 UTC, the disturbance intensified into a depression and was assigned the designation BOB 02 by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) [7] Meanwhile, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 15:00 UTC on May 22 on the developing system [8] The system subsequently intensified into a deep depression at 15:00 UTC on May 23 [9] On the following day, at 02:30 UTC, the system further intensified into a cyclonic storm and was given the name Yaas by the IMD [10] At that time, the low-level circulation center of the system became partially-exposed due to moderate wind shear; however, large masses of rainbands persisted in the southern portion of the storm as it remained in a marginally favorable environment for intensification, with warm sea surface temperatures and good outflow but moderate wind shear [11] [12] The IMD further upgraded Yaas to a severe cyclonic storm at 18:00 UTC that day as the system became more organized [13] A subtropical ridge turned the system northeast into an area of low wind shear, causing Yaas to gradually strengthen [12] At 12:00 UTC on May 25, the JTWC upgraded the storm to a Category 1 system as the system further organized [14] Despite Yaas being negatively affected after making landfall, combined with the weakening effects of moderate wind shear and poor outflow, it intensified further to a very severe cyclonic storm at 15:00 UTC on May 25 as it featured a profound convection [15] The storm subsequently reached its peak intensity of 140 km/h (85 mph) in three-minute sustained wind speeds, according to the IMD; the JTWC had slightly lower estimates of 120 km/h (75 mph) on the system [15] [16] Around 09:00 IST (03:30 UTC) on May 26, Yaas made landfall north of Dhamra Port and south of Bahanaga at the same intensity [17] Upon moving inland, the JTWC issued their final warning on the storm as it weakened to a tropical storm since it was over land and also faced increased vertical shear [18] Soon afterward, the IMD also discontinued advisories as the system became disorganized and as it weakened to a deep depression [19] Yaas eventually dissipated in northern India on May 28.\n\n\nPreparations\nThe Union Power Ministry of India had prepared transformers and generators in

cyclone that affected several countries in South Asia in May 2021. The cyclone caused widespread damage and disruption to the lives of millions of people, with a significant impact on the economy and infrastructure of the affected regions.\n\n**Meteorological History**\n\nCyclone Yaas formed in the Bay of Bengal on May 22, 2021, as a low-pressure area. The system intensified into a depression on May 23, with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) assigning the designation BOB 02. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on May 22, as the system began to develop.\n\nThe system intensified into a deep depression on May 23, with the IMD upgrading it to a cyclonic storm on May 24. The cyclone was named Yaas by the IMD, as it became more organized and intense. The JTWC upgraded Yaas to a Category 1 system on May 25, as the cyclone continued to strengthen.\n\nYaas reached its peak intensity on May 25, with the IMD recording sustained winds of 140 km/h (85 mph) and the JTWC recording sustained winds of 120 km/h (75 mph). The cyclone made landfall in Odisha, India, on May 26, causing widespread damage and disruption.\n\n**Preparations**\n\nThe Indian government took several measures to prepare for the cyclone, with the Union Power Ministry preparing transformers and generators in case of power outages. The Health Ministry ensured that there was no disruption in vaccine supply and COVID-19 treatment. The Ministry of Telecommunication kept all telecom towers and exchanges under watch.\n\nThe National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) deployed 65 teams, with another 20 teams on reserve. Rescue and relief teams of the Indian army, navy, and coast guard were also deployed in the coastal districts of Odisha and West Bengal.\n\n**India**\n\nThe Chief Minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee, met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi to assess and submit damage reports on May 27. The Bengal Governor, Jagdeep Dhankhar, criticized Banerjee for skipping a prior review meet with Modi. Banerjee took aerial surveys of impacted areas in the North 24 Parganas district and said a field survey would be conducted later on.\n\nModi announced ₹10 billion (US$138 million) in immediate relief split between Odisha, West Bengal, and Jharkhand on May 28. Modi undertook aerial surveys of impacted areas in the Bhadrak and Balasore districts of Odisha, as well as Purba Medinipur district in West Bengal.\n\n**Bangladesh**\n\nTidal waves generated by Yaas flooded low-lying areas in Khulna, Satkhira, Patuakhali, Barguna, Jhalokathi, and Noakhali, including some fishing settlements in Sundarbans on May 26. The coastal areas of Cox's Bazar saw inundation in multiple villages due to Cyclone Yaas, while tidal surges severely damaged a jetty and at least 50 houses at St Martin's Island.\n\n500 meters of Kuakata Beach in Patuakhali District were washed away by coastal erosion due to Yaas, while at least 56 km (35 mi) worth of flood-controlling dykes were damaged, which would ultimately cost the district ৳530 million (US$6.25 million) to repair. A hotel along the western side of beach collapsed.\n\n**West Bengal**\n\nMore than 4,500 villages were damaged, with various rural homes and agricultural lands hard-hit. Basic needs such as drinking water, sanitation, and the like were also hard to come by. At least 143 marine vehicles were broken into.\n\n**Odisha**\n\nDue to the heavy rains in Odisha, many residents had been evacuated, so only a few people felt the impact of Yaas. The state was still heavily affected, with 120 village settlements being flooded and heavily damaged by the rains. Paradeep received over 36 cm (14 in) of rainfall on May 25.\n\n**Other States**\n\nIn Ranchi, the capital of Jharkhand, two people were reported dead as they were trapped in a collapsed house, not being rescued and eventually dying there. 1,500 homes were damaged, 10 lakh people were affected, and 18 people were injured in Jharkhand.\n\n**Remnants of Yaas**\n\nThe remnants of Yaas caused light rainfall in some areas in Nepal. Some climbers and hikers at Mount Everest and Lhotse in the country were stranded in high summits, while several more were forced to go down due to imminent weather from the interaction of the system's remnants and a prevailing western disturbance.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe Chief Minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee, met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi to assess and submit damage reports on May 27. The Bengal Governor, Jagdeep Dhankhar, criticized Banerjee for skipping a prior review meet with Modi.

The protest then spread across South Bengal. Opposition parties have also put pressure on the state government for the construction of concrete embankments rather than rebuilding sandbars and weak soil embankments.\n\nThe state government has already proposed the idea for the construction of concrete embankments after reports of embankments breaking open in South Bengal.

in the Bay of Bengal On the next day, at 09:30 UTC, the disturbance intensified into a depression and was assigned the designation BOB 02 by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) [7] Meanwhile, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 15:00 UTC on May 22 on the developing system [8] The system subsequently intensified into a deep depression at 15:00 UTC on May 23 [9] On the following day, at 02:30 UTC, the system further intensified into a cyclonic storm and was given the name Yaas by the IMD [10] At that time, the low-level circulation center of the system became partially-exposed due to moderate wind shear; however, large masses of rainbands persisted in the southern portion of the storm as it remained in a marginally favorable environment for intensification, with warm sea surface temperatures and good outflow but moderate wind shear [11] [12] The IMD further upgraded Yaas to a severe cyclonic storm at 18:00 UTC that day as the system became more organized [13] A subtropical ridge turned the system northeast into an area of low wind shear, causing Yaas to gradually strengthen [12] At 12:00 UTC on May 25, the JTWC upgraded the storm to a Category 1 system as the system further organized [14] Despite Yaas being negatively affected after making landfall, combined with the weakening effects of moderate wind shear and poor outflow, it intensified further to a very severe cyclonic storm at 15:00 UTC on May 25 as it featured a profound convection [15] The storm subsequently reached its peak intensity of 140 km/h (85 mph) in three-minute sustained wind speeds, according to the IMD; the JTWC had slightly lower estimates of 120 km/h (75 mph) on the system [15] [16] Around 09:00 IST (03:30 UTC) on May 26, Yaas made landfall north of Dhamra Port and south of Bahanaga at the same intensity [17] Upon moving inland, the JTWC issued their final warning on the storm as it weakened to a tropical storm since it was over land and also faced increased vertical shear [18] Soon afterward, the IMD also discontinued advisories as the system became disorganized and as it weakened to a deep depression [19] Yaas eventually dissipated in northern India on May 28.\n\n\nPreparations\nThe Union Power Ministry of India had prepared transformers and generators in case of power outages The Health Ministry also prepared to ensure that there is no disruption in vaccine supplement and COVID-19 treatment The Ministry of Telecommunication kept all telecom towers and exchanges under watch [20] India Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also arranged an emergency meeting to prepare for the cyclone [21] The NDRF had deployed 65 teams with another 20 teams on reserve Also, NDRF deployed 115 teams in 5 states [22] Rescue and relief teams of the Indian army, navy, and the coast guard have also deployed over the coastal districts of Odisha and West Bengal [23] CESC stayed on guard for the cyclone to ensure uninterrupted service especially for major hospitals and critical establishments like drainage pumping stations [24] Additionally, the Northern Railway zone had cancelled many trips from New Delhi to and from Bhubaneswar and Puri [25] Meanwhile, Western Railways and Southern Railways had also canceled trains going to and from Odisha [26] [27] Airline operations at Kolkata International Airport were cancelled due to the forecasted interminent weather from Yaas Furthermore, airports in Bhubaneswar, Rourkela and Durgapur were ordered to be closed starting on May 27 due to Yaas [28] The IMD issued an orange alert on May 25 on Mayurbhanj, Jajpur, Cuttack, Khordha, and Puri in Odisha, citing the threat of Yaas' rainfall [29] Meanwhile, a red alert was raised by the department for Kendrapara, Jagatsinghpur, Bhadrak, and Balasore on the same day due to the system [29] Ministry of Home Affairs Amit Shah instructed the authorities in West Bengal, Odisha, and Andhra Pradesh in a virtual meeting to prepare electricity supplies at hospitals and vaccine centers for possible power outages [30] The Port of Kolkata started to suspend all shipping activities in the city, starting on May 25 due to Yaas' threat [31] [32] All 265 boats which were reported to be in the Bay of Bengal on that day returned to the port as the Indian Coast Guard instructed them to do so due to the brewing storm [33] Evacuations were also started on May 24 for the coastal and low-lying areas in East Midnapore and West Midnapore and Jhargram, with over a million people being evacuated [3] [34] Meanwhile, as Yaas weakens over Jharkhand, evacuations were ordered due to the threat of strong winds and heavy rainfall from the system [35] Over 600,000 individuals were instructed to move to disaster shelters provided by the authorities due to the storm's approach [35]\n\n\nIndia\nThe Chief Minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee, met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi to assess and submit damage reports on May 27 The Bengal Governor,

[71] The Sundarbans were inundated with saline seawater after Yaas had moved inland, raising fears of potential damage the forest ecosystem [72] The seawater filled 53 of the 54 freshwater ponds within the forest, cutting off supply of uncontaminated drinking water for wildlife and forest workers; the Bangladesh Forest Department stated the flooding in the Sundarbans was the worst in 14 years

truth and don't you dare say anything against it or you'll be off YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and all the other ones Because there's such a thing as the truth and facts and we have to stick to it.\" She then appeared to deny the Holocaust, declaring, \"six million Jews should die right now, because they cause all the problems in the world\", [105] in what she said was sarcasm Within the same podcast, she discussed her Jewish faith, and in response to Von's comment that \"Hollywood is a Jewish business\", she replied, \"people should be glad that it's Jewish, too, because if Jews were not controlling Hollywood all you'd have was fucking fishing shows\" [105] The segment in which she talked about the Holocaust was subsequently spread on Twitter, misleadingly edited to remove the context

deceptively edited clip from a comedy podcast Roseanne is Jewish, and this was part of a satirical rant about censorship on YouTube She was not actually denying the Holocaust, or wishing death upon Jews.\" [107] In response to the controversy over her remarks, she stated that she had lost family members in the Holocaust, [108] clarifying, \"I was raised in an apartment building with Holocaust survivors, so of course I don't believe the Holocaust never happened and I actually am  [a religious Jew]\" [109] Jonathan Greenblatt, Director and CEO of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), tweeted in

broadcasting, and Fox, ABC, and NBC made offers higher than the $2 million a year maximum for sportscaster salaries; NBC's owner General Electric (GE) offered to make Madden its \"worldwide spokesman\", and GE Rail would build for him a luxury train After he almost joined ABC, [60] Madden and Summerall, along with Producer Bob Stenner and Director Sandy Grossman -- known  as the football broadcasting \"A Team\" -- helped establish Fox's NFL coverage, [61] Madden and that group gave Fox credibility to broadcast what Rupert Murdoch called \"the crown jewel of all sports programming in the world\" Madden's contract paid him more annually than any NFL player [60] However, toward the end of his tenure, Fox was reportedly losing an estimated $4.4 billion on its NFL contract for the eight-year deal it signed in 1998, and it had been trying to cut programming costs as a result Madden's Fox contract would have been worth $8 million for 2003 [62]\n\n\nABC Sports (2002–2005)\nIn

America studio analyst Cris Collinsworth for the game, [64] and returned for the following telecast on November 2, 2008, in Indianapolis (until 2010 the NFL did not schedule Sunday night games for one week in October, so as not to overlap with the World Series taking place roughly around the same time) Madden called his final game on February 1, 2009, for Super Bowl XLIII between the Arizona

interjections such as \"Boom!\", \"Whap!\", \"Bang!\", and \"Doink!\"' and with his use of the telestrator, a device which allowed  him to superimpose his light-penned diagrams of football plays over video footage Madden's use of the telestrator helped to popularize the technology, which has become a staple of television coverage of all sports [69]\n\n\nAll-Madden team\nOf all those players, I

Horses is a British television series based on the novel of the same name by Mick Herron, which is part of the author's Slough House series. The show premiered on Apple TV+ in 2022 and has since gained a loyal following. The series follows the story of a team of British intelligence agents who have all committed career-ending mistakes and are subsequently relegated to a dumping ground department of MI5 called Slough House.\n\n**Premise**\n\nThe premise of Slow Horses revolves around the characters and storylines of the Slough House series by Mick Herron. The series is set in a world where intelligence agents who have made mistakes or failed to meet expectations are sent to Slough House, a dumping ground department of MI5. The agents in Slough House are known as \"slow horses,\" a play on the term \"slough house\" used to describe a place where horses are sent to rest or recover.\n\nThe show's protagonist, Jackson Lamb, is the leader of the slow horses and is known for his gruff demeanor and ability to push his team to their limits. Lamb is a complex character with a troubled past, and his leadership style is often at odds with the more traditional and bureaucratic approach of the MI5 hierarchy.\n\n**Cast and Characters**\n\nThe main cast of Slow Horses includes:\n\n* **Gary Oldman** as Jackson Lamb, the leader of the slow horses\n* **Olivia Cooke** as Catherine Standish, a former MI5 agent who is sent to Slough House after a career-ending mistake\n* **Kristin Scott Thomas** as Diana Taverner, a high-ranking MI5 officer who is often at odds with Lamb and the slow horses\n* **Jack Lowden** as River Cartwright, a young and ambitious agent who is sent to Slough House as a punishment for his mistakes\n\nNotable other characters appearing in more than one series include:\n\n* **Jonathan Pryce** as Hendley, a former MI5 agent and Lamb's old friend\n* **Anthony Head** as Peter Judd, a high-ranking MI5 officer and Lamb's rival\n* **Sophie Okonedo** as Debbie Kinski, a former MI5 agent who is sent to Slough House after a career-ending mistake\n\nSpecial guest characters include:\n\n* **Mark Strong** as Richard Bough, a former MI5 agent who is sent to Slough House after a career-ending mistake\n* **Haydn Gwynne** as Alison Tearney, a former MI5 agent who is sent to Slough House after a career-ending mistake\n\n**Slough House**\n\nSlough House is the dumping ground department of MI5 where the slow horses are sent to work. The house is a run-down building in London that is used to store old files and equipment. The slow horses are tasked with doing paperwork and other mundane tasks, as well as investigating minor crimes and anomalies.\n\nDespite their mundane tasks, the slow horses are often drawn into more complex and sinister plots, involving espionage, terrorism, and corruption. The show's creator, Mick Herron, has said that he wanted to explore the idea of a \"dumping ground\" for intelligence agents who have failed or made mistakes, and how they are often overlooked and undervalued by the intelligence community.\n\n**Episodes**\n\nThe first series of Slow Horses premiered in 2022 and consisted of six episodes. The show was well-received by critics and audiences alike, with many praising its unique blend of espionage and comedy.\n\nThe second series, based on the novel Dead Lions, premiered in 2022 and also consisted of six episodes.

presidential election, Soros had not been a large donor to U.S political campaigns According to OpenSecrets, during the 2003–2004 election cycle, Soros donated $23,581,000 to various 527 Groups

Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Nevada and Maine [131] Among the drug decriminalization groups that have received funding from Soros are the Lindesmith Center and Drug Policy Foundation [132] Soros

advertising campaign [141]\n\n\nConspiracy theories and threats\nBecause of his Jewish identity, wealth, and philanthropy, Soros has been described as \"the perfect code word\" for conspiracy theories that unite antisemitism and Islamophobia One prominent Soros-related conspiracy theory is that he is behind the 2015 European migrant crisis or importing migrants to European countries The Hungarian government spent millions of dollars on a poster campaign demonizing Soros According to anthropologist Ivan Kalmar, \"Many of his most outspoken enemies inside and outside Hungary saw him as leading an international cabal that included other Jews such as the Rothschilds, as well as Freemasons and Illuminati\" [142] [143]\n\n\nAttempted assassination\nA pipe bomb was placed in the mailbox at

Democrats and liberals [147]\n\n\nPolitical and economic views\nSoros's writings focus heavily on the concept of reflexivity, where the biases of individuals enter into market transactions, potentially changing the fundamentals of the economy Soros argues that different principles apply in markets depending on whether they are in a \"near to equilibrium\" or a \"far from equilibrium\" state He argues that, when markets are rising or falling rapidly, they are typically marked by disequilibrium rather than equilibrium, and that the conventional economic theory of the market (the \"efficient market hypothesis\") does not apply in these situations Soros has popularized the concepts of dynamic disequilibrium, static disequilibrium, and near-equilibrium conditions [61] He has stated that his own financial success has been attributable to the edge accorded by his understanding of the action of the reflexive effect Reflexivity is based on three main ideas:

own financial success has been attributable to the edge accorded by his understanding of the action of the reflexive effect Reflexivity is based on three main ideas: [61]\n\n\nReflexivity in politics\nAlthough the primary manifestation of the reflexive process that Soros discusses is its effects in the financial markets, he has also explored its effects in politics He has stated that whereas the greatest threats to the \"open society\" in the past were from communism and fascism (as discussed in The Open Society and Its Enemies by his mentor Karl Popper), the largest current threat is from market fundamentalism.\n\n\nView of problems in the free market system\nSoros argues that the current system of financial speculation undermines healthy economic development in many underdeveloped countries He blames many of the world's problems on the failures inherent in what he characterizes as market fundamentalism [156]\n\n\nMarket predictions\nSoros's book The New Paradigm for Financial Markets (May 2008), described a \"superbubble\" that had built up over the past 25 years and was ready to collapse This was the third in a series of books he has written that have

support Democrats in the 2004 election On September 28, 2004, he dedicated more money to the campaign and kicked off his own multistate tour with a speech, \"Why We Must Not Re-elect President Bush\", [187] delivered at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C The online transcript of this speech received many views after Dick Cheney accidentally referred to FactCheck.org as \"factcheck.com\" in the vice presidential debate, causing the owner of that domain to redirect all traffic to Soros's site [188]\n\n\nViews on Europe\nIn October 2011, Soros drafted an open letter entitled \"As concerned

[129]\n\n\nDrug policy reform\nSoros has funded worldwide efforts to promote drug policy reform In 2008, Soros donated $400,000 to help fund a successful ballot measure in Massachusetts known as the Massachusetts Sensible Marijuana Policy Initiative which decriminalized possession of less than 1 oz (28 g) of marijuana in the state Soros has also funded similar measures in California, Alaska, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Nevada and Maine [131] Among the drug decriminalization groups that have received funding from Soros are the Lindesmith Center and Drug Policy Foundation [132] Soros donated $1.4 million to publicity efforts to support California's Proposition 5 in 2008, a failed ballot measure that would have expanded drug rehabilitation programs as alternatives to prison for persons convicted of non-violent drug-related offenses [133]\n\n\nDeath and dying\nThe Project on Death in America, active from 1994 to 2003, [137] was one of the Open Society Institute's projects, which sought to \"understand and transform the culture and experience of dying and bereavement\" [138] In 1994, Soros delivered a speech in which he reported that he had offered to help his mother, a member of the right-to-die advocacy organization Hemlock Society, commit suicide [139] In the same speech, he also endorsed the Oregon Death with Dignity Act, [140] proceeding to help fund its advertising campaign [141]\n\n\nConspiracy theories and threats\nBecause of his Jewish identity, wealth, and philanthropy, Soros has been described as \"the perfect code word\" for conspiracy theories that unite antisemitism and Islamophobia One prominent Soros-related conspiracy theory is that he is behind the 2015 European migrant crisis or importing migrants to European countries The Hungarian government spent millions of dollars on a poster campaign demonizing Soros According to anthropologist Ivan Kalmar, \"Many of his most outspoken enemies inside and outside Hungary saw him as leading an international cabal that included other Jews such as the Rothschilds, as well as Freemasons and Illuminati\" [142] [143]\n\n\nAttempted assassination\nA pipe bomb was placed in the mailbox at Soros's home in Katonah, New York, on October 22, 2018, as part of the October 2018 United States mail bombing attempts The package was discovered by a caretaker, [144] who removed it and notified authorities It was photographed and exploded by the FBI, which launched an investigation [145] [146] For several days afterward, similar bombs were mailed to Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and other Democrats and liberals [147]\n\n\nPolitical and economic views\nSoros's writings focus heavily on the concept of reflexivity, where the biases of individuals enter into market transactions, potentially changing the fundamentals of the economy Soros argues that different principles apply in markets depending on whether they are in a \"near to equilibrium\" or a \"far from equilibrium\" state He argues that, when markets are rising or falling rapidly, they are typically marked by disequilibrium rather than equilibrium, and that the conventional economic theory of the market (the \"efficient market hypothesis\") does not apply in these situations Soros has popularized the concepts of dynamic disequilibrium, static disequilibrium, and near-equilibrium conditions [61] He has stated that his own financial success has been attributable to the edge accorded by his understanding of the action of the reflexive effect Reflexivity is based on three main ideas: [61]\n\n\nReflexivity, financial markets, and economic theory\nSoros's writings focus heavily on the concept of reflexivity, where the biases of individuals enter into market transactions, potentially changing the fundamentals of the economy Soros argues that different principles apply in markets depending on whether they are in a \"near to equilibrium\" or a \"far from equilibrium\" state He argues that, when markets are rising or falling rapidly, they are typically marked by disequilibrium rather than equilibrium, and that the conventional economic theory of the market (the \"efficient market hypothesis\") does not apply in these situations Soros has popularized the concepts of dynamic disequilibrium, static disequilibrium, and near-equilibrium conditions [61] He has stated that his own financial success has been attributable to the edge accorded by his understanding of the action of the reflexive effect Reflexivity is based on three main ideas: [61]\n\n\nReflexivity in politics\nAlthough the primary manifestation of the reflexive process that Soros discusses is its effects in the financial markets, he has also explored its effects in politics He has stated that whereas the greatest threats to the \"open society\" in the past were from communism and fascism (as discussed in The Open Society and Its Enemies by his mentor Karl Popper), the largest current threat is from market fundamentalism.\n\n\nView of problems in the free market system\nSoros argues that the current system of financial speculation undermines healthy economic development in many underdeveloped countries He blames many of the world's problems on the failures inherent in what he characterizes as market fundamentalism [156]\n\n\nMarket predictions\nSoros's book The New Paradigm for Financial Markets (May 2008), described a \"superbubble\" that had built up over the past 25 years and was ready to collapse This was the third in a series of books he has written that have predicted disaster As he states:\n\n\nViews on antisemitism and Israel\nWhen asked what he thought about Israel, in The New Yorker, Soros replied: \"I don't deny Jews the right to a national existence – but I don't want to be a part of it\" [161] According to hacked emails released in 2016, Soros's Open Society Foundation has a self-described objective of \"challenging Israel's racist and anti-democratic policies\" in international forums, in part by questioning Israel's reputation as a democracy [162] He has funded NGOs which have been actively critical of Israeli policies [163] [164] [165] including groups that campaign for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel [163]\n\n\nViews on the U.S.\nOn November 11, 2003, in an interview with The Washington Post, Soros said that removing President George W Bush from office was the \"central focus of my life\" and \"a matter of life and death\" He said he would sacrifice his entire fortune to defeat Bush \"if someone guaranteed it\" [184] [185] Soros gave $3 million to the Center for American Progress, $2.5 million to MoveOn.org, and $20 million [186] to America Coming Together These groups worked to support Democrats in the 2004 election On September 28, 2004, he dedicated more money to the campaign and kicked off his own multistate tour with a speech, \"Why We Must Not Re-elect President Bush\", [187] delivered at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C The online transcript of this speech received many views after Dick Cheney accidentally referred to FactCheck.org as \"factcheck.com\" in the vice presidential debate, causing the owner of that domain to redirect all traffic to Soros's site [188]\n\n\nViews on Europe\nIn October 2011, Soros drafted an open letter entitled \"As concerned Europeans we urge Eurozone leaders to unite\", [193] in which he calls for a stronger economic government for Europe using federal means (Common EU treasury, common fiscal supervision, etc.) and warns against the danger of nationalistic solutions to the Great Recession The letter was co-signed by Javier Solana, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, Andrew Duff, Emma Bonino, Massimo D'Alema, and Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga.\n\n\nViews on relations between Europe and Africa\nIn view of the possibility of a further increase of the number of refugees from Africa to Europe, Soros proposes that the European Union devise a \"Marshall Plan for Africa\" (see Marshall Plan), fostering education and employment in Africa in order to reduce emigration [197] [199]\n\n\nViews on China\nSoros has expressed concern about the growth of Chinese economic and political power, saying, \"China has risen very rapidly by looking out for its own interests .. They have now got to accept responsibility for world order and the interests of other people as well\" Regarding the political gridlock in America, he said, \"Today, China has not only a more vigorous economy but actually a better functioning government than the United States\" [200] In July 2015, Soros stated that a \"strategic partnership between the US and China could prevent the evolution of two power blocks that may be drawn into military conflict\" [201] In January 2016, during an interview at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Soros stated that \" [a] hard landing is practically unavoidable\" Chinese state media responded by stating \"Soros' challenge to the RMB and Hong Kong dollar are doomed to fail, without any doubt\" [202]\n\n\nViews on Russia and Ukraine\nIn May 2014, Soros told CNN's Fareed Zakaria: \"I set up a foundation in Ukraine before Ukraine became independent from Russia And the foundation has been functioning ever since and played an important part in events now.\" [207]\n\n\nViews on India and Narendra Modi\nIn February 2023, Soros criticized Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his alleged Islamophobia, cronyism and authoritarianism, saying that \"India is...a democracy But its leader, Narendra Modi, is no democrat Inciting violence against Muslims was an important factor in his meteoric rise.\" [215] Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party accused Soros of trying to undermine Indian democracy [216] Indian foreign minister S Jaishankar claimed that Soros is a \"dangerous\" person [217] India allegedly ran a disinformation campaign against Soros [218]\n\n\nWealth and philanthropy\nAs of March 2020 [update], Forbes magazine listed Soros as the 162nd richest person in the world, with a net worth of $8.3 billion [219] He has also donated 64% of his original fortune, and distributed more than $15 billion through his Open Society Foundations (an international grantmaking network that supports advancing justice, education, public health and independent media) Forbes has called him the most generous giver (when measured as a percentage of net worth) [12]\n\n\nPersonal life\nSoros has been married three times and divorced twice In 1960, he married Annaliese Witschak (born January 3, 1934) Annaliese was an ethnic German immigrant, who had been orphaned during the war Although she was not Jewish, she was well-liked by Soros's parents, as she had also experienced the privation and displacement brought about by World War II [236] They divorced in 1983 They had three children:\n\n\nHonors and awards\nSoros received honorary doctoral degrees from the New School for Social Research (New York), the University of Oxford in 1980, the Corvinus University of Budapest, and Yale University in 1991 He received an honorary degree in economics from the University of Bologna in 1995 [250]\n\n\nPublications and scholarship\n\n\nBooks authored or co-authored\n\n\nNotable op-eds\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nJournalism\n\n\nScholarly perspectives\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The Past, Present, and Future of America's Most Wanted Music, author Mickey Hess identified Kid Rock as connecting hip hop music to rap rock, due to having started out as a hip hop artist, before shifting his style from sample-based hip hop to guitar-driven alternative rock that fused hip hop beats, boasting and fashion with hard rock guitar and Southern rock attitude, influenced by classic rock and country music [56] He is a self-taught musician and has said that he can play every instrument used in his band [57] According to The Village Voice, \" [Kid Rock's] own love and incorporation of his musical references isn't rooted in a nostalgia or a 'tribute,' but rather in his actively engaging the elements he finds compelling into a wholly new hodgepodge of his own invention.\" [58] Because of this unique musical approach, Kid Rock has been described as a postmodern artist [59] [60] American Songwriter says that Kid Rock's style ranges from hard rap to hard rock [61] CBS says that Kid Rock's style is a mix of \"urban rap, rock and roll  [and] country and western.\" [57] The musician jokingly described his own style as being \"creatively confused\" [62] Reviewing his compilation album The History of Rock, David Browne wrote that \"Unlike most of his rap-metal peers, Kid Rock doesn't merely have personality to burn (and a surprisingly likable one) but a sense of history as well He may be the first rock star who views Americana as not simply blues, country, and boogie rock but classic hard rock and rap as well.\" [63] A 2015 piece by the Detroit Free Press said that Kid Rock reinvented \"his persona from scrappy hip-hop street kid to swaggering rock-rap showman.\" [9] Covering him in a 1998 piece, MTV described his sound as having \"heavy-metal licks and rap riffs\" [64] AllMusic described him as a \"country rap-rocker\" and his music as \"rap-meets-rock-meets-country\" [65] MTV said that Kid Rock's album Devil Without a Cause helped to \"ignite the rap-rock genre\" and that the musician broke through into mainstream success \"during the peak of rap-rock and nü-metal\" [66] In a 2015 interview with Rolling Stone, Kid Rock disavowed nu metal, saying that the genre was \"not melodic and doesn't stand the test of time.\" [67] In a review of his album Sweet Southern Sugar, Cryptic Rock said that after Devil Without a Cause established him as a rap rock artist, \"albums that were saturated in old school hip hop slowly but surely began to transform into the Southern country rock landscape that has built Kid Rock's persona.\" [68] In a review of his album Born Free, Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that the musician \"has slowly abandoned rap for country as he crept closer to middle age\", [69] and while reviewing the subsequent album Rebel Soul, Erlewine said that Kid Rock \" [planted] his flag on that old-time rock & roll\" [70] Billboard said that Kid Rock \"fits comfortably into a modern country-rock landscape that seems practically tailor-made for him: a God-fearing good old boy with a hard-rock heart and an outlaw-country spirit.\" [71] Kid Rock's influences include Bob Seger [9] and Beastie Boys [2] Regarding his influences, Kid Rock said, \"I don't think there isn't anything that hasn't influenced me musically.\" [62]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn eighth grade, Ritchie began an on-and-off relationship with classmate

overseas [4] Ritchie is an advocate for affordable concert tickets He sells tickets for as low as possible to increase concert attendance for lower income consumers, and to discourage scalping [42] [87] Instead of getting paid for the show, he gets a percentage of concession and ticket sales [43]\n\n\nPolitics and views\nRitchie is a supporter of the Republican Party, [130] although he has routinely proclaimed himself as libertarian philosophically, [87] [131] [132] stating he has socially liberal views on topics like abortion and gay marriage but conservative views on economics [132] Ritchie has advocated legalizing and taxing marijuana, cocaine, and heroin [85] He has also stated, \"I don't think crazy people should have guns.\" [85] He was a vocal supporter of American military involvement in the Iraq War [133] Ritchie has met with presidents Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump while they were in office [77] [134] [135] Regarding his political views, Ritchie said,

rock and country music [56] He is a self-taught musician and has said that he can play every instrument used in his band [57] According to The Village Voice, \" [Kid Rock's] own love and incorporation of his musical references isn't rooted in a nostalgia or a 'tribute,' but rather in his actively engaging the elements he finds compelling into a wholly new hodgepodge of his own invention.\" [58] Because of this unique musical approach, Kid Rock has been described as a postmodern artist [59] [60] American Songwriter says that Kid Rock's style ranges from hard rap to hard rock [61] CBS says that Kid Rock's style is a mix of \"urban rap, rock and roll  [and] country and western.\" [57] The musician jokingly described his own style as being \"creatively confused\" [62] Reviewing his compilation album The History of Rock, David Browne wrote that \"Unlike most of his rap-metal peers, Kid Rock doesn't merely have personality to burn (and a surprisingly likable one) but a sense of history as well He may be the first rock star who views Americana as not simply blues, country, and boogie rock but classic hard rock and rap as well.\" [63] A 2015 piece by the Detroit Free Press said that Kid Rock reinvented \"his persona from scrappy hip-hop street kid to swaggering rock-rap showman.\" [9] Covering him in a 1998 piece, MTV described his sound as having \"heavy-metal licks and rap riffs\" [64] AllMusic described him as a \"country rap-rocker\" and his music as \"rap-meets-rock-meets-country\" [65] MTV said that Kid Rock's album Devil Without a Cause helped to \"ignite the rap-rock genre\" and that the musician broke through into mainstream success \"during the peak of rap-rock and nü-metal\" [66] In a 2015 interview with Rolling Stone, Kid Rock disavowed nu metal, saying that the genre was \"not melodic and doesn't stand the test of time.\" [67] In a review of his album Sweet Southern Sugar, Cryptic Rock said that after Devil Without a Cause established him as a rap rock artist, \"albums that were saturated in old school hip hop slowly but surely began to transform into the Southern country rock landscape that has built Kid Rock's persona.\" [68] In a review of his album Born Free, Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that the musician \"has slowly abandoned rap for country as he crept closer to middle age\", [69] and while reviewing the subsequent album Rebel Soul, Erlewine said that Kid Rock \" [planted] his flag on that old-time rock & roll\" [70] Billboard said that Kid Rock \"fits comfortably into a modern country-rock landscape that seems practically tailor-made for him: a God-fearing good old boy with a hard-rock heart and an outlaw-country spirit.\" [71] Kid Rock's influences include Bob Seger [9] and Beastie Boys [2] Regarding his influences, Kid Rock said, \"I don't think there isn't anything that hasn't influenced me musically.\" [62]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn eighth grade, Ritchie began an on-and-off relationship with classmate Kelley South Russell that lasted for the next decade [2] [8] [9] In summer 1993, Russell gave birth to their son, Robert James Ritchie Jr [2] [9] They raised a total of three children together, two of whom Ritchie believed to be his They split up in late 1993 when Ritchie discovered that only one of the two was his [9] He subsequently raised his son as a single father [76]\n\n\nPublic image and controversies\nRitchie oversees The Kid Rock Foundation, a charity which raises funds for multiple causes, including campaigns which sent \"Kid Rock care packages\" to U.S military personnel stationed overseas [4] Ritchie is an advocate for affordable concert tickets He sells tickets for as low as possible to increase concert attendance for lower income consumers, and to discourage scalping [42] [87] Instead of getting paid for the show, he gets a percentage of concession and ticket sales [43]\n\n\nPolitics and views\nRitchie is a supporter of the Republican Party, [130] although he has routinely proclaimed himself as libertarian philosophically, [87] [131] [132] stating he has socially liberal views on topics like abortion and gay marriage but conservative views on economics [132] Ritchie has advocated legalizing and taxing marijuana, cocaine, and heroin [85] He has also stated, \"I don't think crazy people should have guns.\" [85] He was a vocal supporter of American military involvement in the Iraq War [133] Ritchie has met with presidents Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump while they were in office [77] [134] [135] Regarding his political views, Ritchie said, \"I have friends everywhere Democrat, Republican, this that and the other .. We're all human beings first, Americans second Let's find some common ground and get along.\" During his speech at the 2018 WWE Hall of Fame ceremony, he stated that he wanted to \"body slam some Democrats\" [136]\n\n\nDiscography\n\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nTours\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

he envisaged a suave actor, such as David Niven, playing the role [13] Producer Albert R Broccoli—known to all as Cubby—disagreed with Fleming's view, later commenting that \"I wanted a ballsy guy .. put a bit of veneer over that tough Scottish hide and you've got Fleming's Bond instead of all the mincing poofs we had applying for the job\" [14] Eon's choice of Connery was also based on his looks and sex appeal, [15] an appeal that would later be echoed by Honor Blackman (who played Pussy Galore), who said, after appearing with Connery in Goldfinger, \"He was exceedingly handsome, virile and sexy and that really was the tenor of what the script was always trying to display\" [16] After Connery was chosen, director Terence Young took the actor to his tailor and hairdresser, [17] and introduced him to the high life, restaurants, casinos and women of London In the words of Bond writer Raymond Benson, Young educated the actor \"in the ways of being dapper, witty, and above all, cool\" [18]\n\n\nSean Connery: 1961–1967, 1970–1971 and 1982–1983\nSean Connery was the first actor to portray Bond in film in Dr No (1962) A Scottish amateur bodybuilder, he had come to the attention of the Bond film producers after several appearances in British films from the late 1950s [12] At a muscular 6 ft 2 in (188 cm), Connery was initially met with disapproval from Fleming, who believed he was an overgrown stuntman lacking the finesse and elegance to play James Bond;

the actor reflected the author's image of the character [13] In 1965 producer Charles Feldman signed Niven to play Sir James Bond for Casino Royale, a film not made by Eon Productions Connery and Peter Sellers had both turned down the role [53] [54] Niven was 56 when he played Bond [55] and his characterisation was that of an elderly man who had won the Victoria Cross at the siege of Mafeking, had a daughter by his lover, the spy Mata Hari, played Claude Debussy on the piano, ate royal jelly and cultivated black roses [56] [57] The concept of Bond is that once Niven's Bond retired, his name and 007 designation was passed to another agent to keep the legend alive; James Chapman notes that the implication was that the \"other Bond\" was that played by Connery [58]\n\n\nGeorge Lazenby: 1968–1969\nWith the departure of Connery after You Only Live Twice (1967), Broccoli and director Peter R Hunt chose little-known Australian actor  George Lazenby (born 1939),  to be the third major actor (following Sean Connery and David Niven)  to play the role of Bond He first came to their attention in a Fry's Chocolate Cream advertisement [62] Lazenby dressed the part by sporting several sartorial Bond elements such as a Rolex Submariner wristwatch and a Savile Row suit (ordered, but uncollected, by Connery), and going to Connery's barber at the Dorchester Hotel in London [63] Lazenby consolidated his claim during a screen test, when he accidentally punched a professional wrestler, who was acting as stunt coordinator, in the face, impressing Broccoli with his ability to display aggression [64] Lazenby never signed a contract, with negotiations dragging on during production, [65] and he was subsequently unfortunately convinced by his agent Ronan O'Rahilly that the secret agent character image would be archaic in the liberated 1970s; as a result he left the role of Agent 007 even before the release of On Her Majesty's Secret Service in 1969 [62] For his performance as Bond, Lazenby was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actor at the following year's 27th Golden Globe Awards in February 1970 [66]\n\n\nRoger Moore: 1972–1985\nAfter Diamonds Are Forever, Broccoli and Saltzman tried to convince Sean Connery to return as Bond, but he declined [81] After considering Jeremy Brett, Michael Billington and Julian Glover, [82] [83] the two producers finally turned to Roger Moore, whom they had previously discussed for On Her Majesty's Secret Service, but who had been unavailable, and he was ultimately cast to play Bond in Live and Let Die [64] [84] At the time Moore was an established television actor, known for his performances as Simon Templar in The Saint and Lord Brett Sinclair in The Persuaders!, in both of which he played a \"charming, debonair, international playboy\" [85] When playing Bond, Moore tried not to imitate either Connery or his previous roles, and screenwriter Tom Mankiewicz fitted the screenplay around Moore's persona by giving more comedy scenes and a light-hearted feel to Bond, [81] an approach that led Raymond Benson to describe Moore's Bond as \"a rather smarmy, eyebrow-raising international playboy who never seemed to get hurt\" [86]\n\n\nTimothy Dalton: 1986–1994\nWith the retirement of Roger Moore in 1985, a search for a new actor to play Bond took place that saw a number of actors, including Sam Neill, [103] Pierce Brosnan [104] and Timothy Dalton, audition for the role in 1986 Bond co-producer Michael G Wilson, director John Glen, Dana and Barbara Broccoli \"were impressed with Sam Neill and very much wanted to use him\", although Bond producer Albert R Broccoli was not sold on the actor [105] Dalton and Brosnan were both considered by Eon, [106] [107] but after Brosnan was eventually ruled out by his Remington Steele contract, [104] Dalton was appointed in August 1986 [108] on a salary of $5.2 million [37] When he was either 24 or 25 years old Dalton had discussed playing Bond with Broccoli, but decided he was too young to accept the role, thinking Bond should be portrayed as being between 35 and 40 years old [106] In preparing for the role, Dalton, a green-eyed, dark haired, slender, 6 ft 2 in (188 cm) classically trained Shakespearean actor, [109] was keen to portray the character as accurately as possible, reading up extensively on the books before his role in The Living Daylights (1987)  [110]\n\n\nPierce Brosnan: 1994–2004\nAfter Timothy Dalton retired from the Bond role in 1994, Eon turned to the actor they had considered after A View to a Kill: Pierce Brosnan [104] He was offered a three-film contract, with an option on a fourth; [130] his salary for his first film, GoldenEye, was $4 million, which rose to $16.5 million for his fourth and final outing, Die Another Day [37] Brosnan had first met Broccoli on the set of For Your Eyes Only, when Brosnan's wife, Cassandra Harris, was appearing in the film as Countess Lisl von Schlaf, and the couple lunched with Broccoli during filming [82] Brosnan went on to play a criminal-turned-private investigator in Remington Steele in the 1980s, [100] where he captured some of the traits of previous Bonds in playing the role: like Moore, he exemplified a high degree of suavity, elegance, charm and wit, [19] [131] [132] but displayed a masculinity and grittiness on occasion reminiscent of Connery's Bond, both successfully \"combine the character's Englishness with a classless internationalism that is highly knowing\" [133] Andrew Spicer says that \"Brosnan's frame carries the 'Armani look' with its refined understated Englishness, to perfection His lithe, sinuous athleticism is well suited to the fast-paced action and state-of-the-art gadgetry that retains the series' core appeal\" [133] James Chapman also considered Brosnan's appearance striking, saying the actor had \"old-fashioned, darkly handsome matinee idol looks\" [134]\n\n\nDaniel Craig: 2005–2021\nOn 14 October 2005, Eon Productions, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Sony Pictures Entertainment introduced at a press conference in London Daniel Craig as the sixth actor to portray Bond in the Eon series [145] A tuxedo- and lifejacket-clad Craig arrived via a Royal Navy speedboat [146] Craig accepted the role based on the strength of the script for Casino Royale; he later recalled that \"once I sat down and read the story, I just thought that I wanted to tell  [it] .. I'm a big Bond fan, and I love what he represents\" [147] Significant controversy followed the decision, with some critics and fans expressing doubt the producers had made the right choice Throughout the entire production period, Internet campaigns such as danielcraigisnotbond.com expressed their dissatisfaction and threatened to boycott the film in protest [148] Craig, unlike previous actors, was not considered by the protesters to fit the tall, dark, handsome and charismatic image of Bond to which viewers had been accustomed [149] Many disparagingly called him \"James Blonde\", believing the 5 ft 10 in (1.78 m) blond-haired, blue-eyed Craig far from the traditional tall, dark and suave actors who had earlier portrayed him The Daily Mirror ran a front-page news story critical of Craig, with the headline, The Name's Bland – James Bland [150]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Portrayal of James Bond in film**\n\nJames Bond, the iconic character created by author Ian Fleming, has been portrayed by six different actors in film adaptations since the character's debut in 1962. The portrayal of Bond has undergone significant changes over the years, reflecting the changing times, cultural norms, and the actors' interpretations of the character.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe James Bond films have been a staple of the entertainment industry since the early 1960s, with a franchise that has endured for over five decades.

Fleming added his own style and tastes to create a character that was both suave and deadly. The character's name was inspired by an American ornithologist of the same name, while the code number 007 came from one of British naval intelligence's key achievements of World War I.

Moore's Bond was a more light-hearted and comedic character than Connery's, and his performances were marked by a sense of wit and humor. Moore's Bond was a rather smarmy, eyebrow-raising international playboy who never seemed to get hurt. His performances were well-received by audiences, and he became synonymous with the character.\n\n**Timothy Dalton: 1986-1994**\n\nTimothy Dalton was a classically trained Shakespearean actor who was chosen to play James Bond in 1986.

[130] his salary for his first film, GoldenEye, was $4 million, which rose to $16.5 million for his fourth and final outing, Die Another Day [37] Brosnan had first met Broccoli on the set of For Your Eyes Only, when Brosnan's wife, Cassandra Harris, was appearing in the film as Countess Lisl von Schlaf, and the couple lunched with Broccoli during filming [82] Brosnan went on to play a criminal-turned-private investigator in Remington Steele in the 1980s, [100] where he captured some of the traits of previous Bonds in playing the role: like Moore, he exemplified a high degree of suavity, elegance, charm and wit, [19] [131] [132] but displayed a masculinity and grittiness on occasion reminiscent of Connery's Bond, both successfully \"combine the character's Englishness with a classless internationalism that is highly knowing\" [133] Andrew Spicer says that \"Brosnan's frame carries the 'Armani look' with its refined understated Englishness, to perfection His lithe, sinuous athleticism is well suited to the fast-paced action and state-of-the-art gadgetry that retains the series' core appeal\" [133] James Chapman also considered Brosnan's appearance striking, saying the actor had \"old-fashioned, darkly handsome matinee idol looks\" [134]\n\n\nDaniel Craig: 2005–2021\nOn 14 October 2005, Eon Productions, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Sony Pictures Entertainment introduced at a press conference in London Daniel Craig as the sixth actor to portray Bond in the Eon series [145] A tuxedo- and lifejacket-clad Craig arrived via a Royal Navy speedboat [146] Craig accepted the role based on the strength of the script for Casino Royale; he later recalled that \"once I sat down and read the story, I just thought that I wanted to tell  [it] .. I'm a big Bond fan, and I love what he represents\" [147] Significant controversy followed the decision, with some critics and fans expressing doubt the producers had made the right choice Throughout the entire production period, Internet campaigns such as danielcraigisnotbond.com expressed their dissatisfaction and threatened to boycott the film in protest [148] Craig, unlike previous actors, was not considered by the protesters to fit the tall, dark, handsome and charismatic image of Bond to which viewers had been accustomed [149] Many disparagingly called him \"James Blonde\", believing the 5 ft 10 in (1.78 m) blond-haired, blue-eyed Craig far from the traditional tall, dark and suave actors who had earlier portrayed him The Daily Mirror ran a front-page news story critical of Craig, with the headline, The Name's Bland – James Bland [150]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He has gained widespread recognition for his versatile performances in a wide range of film genres, including action, drama, and science fiction.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nVin Diesel was born Mark Sinclair on July 18, 1967, in Alameda County, California. His mother, Delora Sherleen Vincent (née Sinclair), was also born in California, but later moved to New York City with her fraternal twin brother, Paul. Diesel's mother is an astrologer, and his father, Irving H. Vincent, was an acting instructor and theater manager. Diesel has stated that he is \"of ambiguous ethnicity\" due to his mixed heritage, which includes Scottish roots through his mother's family. He has never met his biological father and has stated that his parents' relationship would have been illegal in parts of the United States due to anti-miscegenation laws.\n\n**Career**\n\nDiesel's acting career began with small roles in films and television shows. His first film role was as an uncredited extra in the drama film \"Awakenings\" in 1990. However, it was his breakthrough role as Vin in the 1995 film \"Multi-Facial,\" a short drama film that he wrote, directed, and produced, that brought him critical acclaim. The film follows a struggling multiracial actor stuck in the audition process, and it was selected for screening at the 1995 Cannes Festival.\n\nDiesel's early struggles to gain acting roles led him to work as a bouncer and telemarketer selling lightbulbs to support himself. In 1994, he decided to make his own short film to secure funds for his feature film debut. This decision paid off when he was cast in the film \"Pitch Black\" in 2000, which was a commercial success and launched his career as a leading action hero.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nDiesel is known for his private nature, and he prefers to keep his personal life out of the spotlight. He has stated that he comes from the \"Harrison Ford, Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro, Al Pacino code of silence,\" implying that he values his personal life and does not wish to share it with the public.\n\nDespite his private nature, Diesel has been linked to several high-profile relationships over the years. In 2001, he dated his Fast & Furious co-star Michelle Rodriguez. Since 2007, he has been in a relationship with Mexican model Paloma Jimenez, with whom he has three children: two daughters born in April 2008 and March 2015, and a son born in 2010.\n\n**Relationships**\n\nDiesel has been open about his close friendship with his Fast & Furious co-star and close friend Paul Walker, who died in November 2013. He has also been a godfather to Walker's daughter, Meadow.

2002 USA Junior Championships in the 200 meters race [16] and later, the Pac-10 championships in 2003 and 2004 as a collegiate athlete for USC Wes now acts as the agent for his sister [17] Felix describes her running ability as a gift from God: \"For me, my faith is the reason I run I definitely feel I have this amazing gift that God has blessed me with, and it's all about using it to the best of my ability.\" [18]\n\n\nJunior career\nAllyson Felix attended Los Angeles Baptist High School in North Hills, California, where she was nicknamed \"Chicken Legs\" by her teammates, because the five-foot-six, 125-pound sprinter's body had skinny legs despite her strength Her slightness belied her speed on the track and strength in the gym, as she could deadlift at least 270 pounds while still in high school [19] Felix credits much of her early success to her high school sprint coach, Jonathan Patton.\n\n\nProfessional\nAt the 2003 U.S national championships, the seventeen-year-old phenomenon finished second in the 200 meters sprint with a time of 22.59 seconds, earning her spot to the 2003 Paris World Championships In the quarter-finals of the 200 meters in Paris, Felix finished sixth in 23.33 seconds.\n\n\nEarly career\nAt the 2003 U.S national championships, the seventeen-year-old phenomenon finished second in the 200 meters sprint with a time of 22.59 seconds, earning her spot to the 2003 Paris World Championships In the quarter-finals of the 200 meters in Paris, Felix finished sixth in 23.33 seconds.\n\n\n2008–09\nFelix qualified for the 2008 Summer Olympics at the 2008 Olympic trials by winning the 200 meters sprint in 21.82 seconds, but narrowly missed qualifying for the 100 meters sprint In the Olympic 200 meter final, despite running her season's best time in the 200 meters at 21.93 seconds, she again finished second to Campbell, who ran 21.74 seconds, the best time of the decade, to win the gold medal [33] Felix avenged her disappointing loss by regaining the lead for the U.S women's 4 × 400 meters relay team during her 48.55-second leg, allowing Team USA to eventually win and earning her first Olympic gold medal [34] [35] [8]\n\n\n2010–11\nIn 2010, Felix focused on running more 400-meter races Running the 200 meters and the 400 meters, she became the first person to win two IAAF Diamond League trophies in the same year She continued her dominance by winning 21 out of 22 races, only losing to Veronica Campbell-Brown in New York Felix also became the U.S 100 meters champion by winning the sprint in 11.27 seconds against a strong −2.5 m/s headwind [38]\n\n\n2012–13\n\nIn 2012, Felix returned to the Olympic trials, choosing to race the 100 meters in addition to her main event, the 200 meters The top three finishers in each event qualified for the 2012 Summer Olympics team In the 100 meters final, she ran 11.07 seconds, placing third, but not without controversy [41] Officials ruled that Felix and her training partner Jeneba Tarmoh were in a dead heat for third place, the final qualification position, after initially declaring Tarmoh ahead A run-off between Tarmoh and Felix was scheduled, but Tarmoh eventually withdrew due to emotional and physical fatigue, conceding the final 100-meter spot to Felix [42] [43] In the 200 meters final at the 2012 Olympic trials, Felix recorded a personal best and a meet record of 21.69 seconds, the third-fastest time an American woman had ever run and the fourth-fastest ever clocked by a female athlete up until that point [44] Carmelita Jeter and Sanya Richards-Ross placed second and third, respectively \n\n2014–15\n\nAfter a nine-month layoff due to a hamstring injury, Felix resumed competition in the 400 meters at the Shanghai Diamond League meet in May 2014, in which she finished fifth with a time of 50.81 seconds She later competed in the 200 meters at the Prefontaine Classic meet, finishing third with a season's best of 22.44 seconds.\n\n2016–17\nFelix began her 2016 season with an uncharacteristically slow start after a gym accident in April, when she dropped from a pull-up bar and landed awkwardly, twisting her right ankle and tearing multiple ligaments [53] Felix was slated to run in a Diamond League meet in Doha as well as the Prefontaine Classic, but pulled out of both meets [54] In early June, she ran the 400 meters in 51.23 seconds at a low-key San Diego meet [54]\n\n\n2018–19\nFelix reduced her racing schedule in 2018, stating: \"In the 19 years that I've been running track, I've never taken a break Never had a year where I took it easy Now that this is kind of a year without a championship, I've had to force myself to have a different approach because my goal is 2020 So, if you guys don't see me at as many of the races as I usually run, don't worry I'm fine I'm just challenging myself to be smarter.\" [65] Later in December 2018, Felix revealed her difficult pregnancy story to espnW [66] During her 32nd-week pregnancy checkup, doctors discovered that Felix had developed pre-eclampsia, a condition that is disproportionately prevalent in African-American women and is marked by high blood pressure along with potentially harmful childbirth effects [67] With the baby's heart rate steadily decreasing, Felix had to deliver her premature daughter via emergency C-section within 48 hours Motivated by her life-threatening experience, Felix testified before the United States House Committee on Ways and Means on the topic of the black maternal mortality crisis: \"Research shows that racial bias in our maternal health care system includes things like providers spending less time with Black mothers, underestimating the pain of their Black patients, ignoring symptoms and dismissing complaints.\" [67]\n\n\nPregnancy emergency\nFelix reduced her racing schedule in 2018, stating: \"In the 19 years that I've been running track, I've never taken a break Never had a year

[67]\n\n\nNike controversy\nFelix furthered her maternal advocacy work in May 2019 by penning an op-ed for The New York Times, accusing her longtime sponsor Nike of refusing to guarantee salary protections for female athletes in the months following pregnancy [68] Her story underscored the earlier allegations made by her former Nike teammates Alysia Montaño and Kara Goucher regarding their pregnancy disputes with the sportswear company [69] In the article, Felix explained that after her contract ended in December 2017, she and Nike negotiated for a contract renewal Planning to start a family in 2018, Felix asked Nike for written financial security, in case her performance yielded subpar results while recovering from childbirth; the negotiators declined after already offering a 70 percent pay cut in this contract proposal [68] Soon after, Felix left and signed a clothing sponsorship deal with the Gap Inc.–owned apparel company Athleta in July 2019, becoming their first sponsored athlete [70] Following the public controversy, Nike altered their maternal policy in August 2019, promising to not apply any performance-related salary reductions for 18 consecutive months, starting eight months before the due date During this period, the sportswear company would also not float the possibility of termination if the athlete chooses to not race due to pregnancy [9]\n\n\nReturn to competition\nIn July 2019, Felix competed in her first race since giving birth in November 2018, finishing sixth in the 400-meter sprint at the U.S national championships in Des Moines, Iowa Although failing to qualify into the individual 400-meter event for the 2019 Doha World Championships, Felix's sixth-place finish still placed her in the U.S 4 × 400 meters relay pool In the first-ever mixed-gender 4 × 400 meters relay at the world championships, Felix competed with Michael Cherry, Wil London III, and Courtney Okolo to set a world record time of 3:09.34 Felix ran a

final With her 12th and 13th world championship gold medals, Felix surpassed Usain Bolt for the most golds by any athlete in World Athletics Championships history [72]\n\n\n2020–2022\nFelix trained during the COVID-19 pandemic with the aim of qualifying for her fifth Olympic Games – her first as a mother She completed workouts on streets, empty soccer fields, and beaches after Gavin Newsom's quarantine measures were first enacted throughout California in March 2020 [73] A former participant in the US Anti-Doping Agency's \"Project Believe\" program in 2008, she volunteered again for

\"Allyson_Felix\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nAllyson Felix was born on November 18, 1985, in Los Angeles, California [2] She is the daughter of Paul, an ordained minister and professor of New Testament at The Master's Seminary in Sun Valley, California, [15] and Marlean, an elementary school teacher at Balboa Magnet Elementary Her elder brother Wes Felix was also a sprinter, winning the 2002 USA Junior Championships in the 200 meters race [16] and later, the Pac-10 championships in 2003 and 2004 as a collegiate athlete for USC Wes now acts as the agent for his sister [17] Felix describes her running ability as a gift from God: \"For me, my faith is the reason I run I definitely feel I have this amazing gift that God has blessed me with, and it's all about using it to the best of my ability.\" [18]\n\n\nJunior career\nAllyson Felix attended Los Angeles Baptist High School in North Hills, California, where she was nicknamed \"Chicken Legs\" by her teammates, because the five-foot-six, 125-pound sprinter's body had skinny legs despite her strength Her slightness belied her speed on the track and strength in the gym, as she could deadlift at least 270 pounds while still in high school [19] Felix credits much of her early success to her high school sprint coach, Jonathan Patton.\n\n\nProfessional\nAt the 2003 U.S national championships, the seventeen-year-old phenomenon finished second in the 200 meters sprint with a time of 22.59 seconds, earning her spot to the 2003 Paris World Championships In the quarter-finals of the 200 meters in Paris, Felix finished sixth in 23.33 seconds.\n\n\nEarly career\nAt the 2003 U.S national championships, the seventeen-year-old phenomenon finished second in the 200 meters sprint with a time of 22.59 seconds, earning her spot to the 2003 Paris World Championships In the quarter-finals of the 200 meters in Paris, Felix finished sixth in 23.33 seconds.\n\n\n2008–09\nFelix qualified for the 2008 Summer Olympics at the 2008 Olympic trials by winning the 200 meters sprint in 21.82 seconds, but narrowly missed qualifying for the 100 meters sprint In the Olympic 200 meter final, despite running her season's best time in the 200 meters at 21.93 seconds, she again finished second to Campbell, who ran 21.74 seconds, the best time of the decade, to win the gold medal [33] Felix avenged her disappointing loss by regaining the lead for the U.S women's 4 × 400 meters relay team during her 48.55-second leg, allowing Team USA to eventually win and earning her first Olympic gold medal [34] [35] [8]\n\n\n2010–11\nIn 2010, Felix focused on running more 400-meter races Running the 200 meters and the 400 meters, she became the first person to win two IAAF Diamond League trophies in the same year She continued her dominance by winning 21 out of 22 races, only losing to Veronica Campbell-Brown in New York Felix also became the U.S 100 meters champion by winning the sprint in 11.27 seconds against a strong −2.5 m/s headwind [38]\n\n\n2012–13\n\nIn 2012, Felix returned to the Olympic trials, choosing to race the 100 meters in addition to her main event, the 200 meters The top three finishers in each event qualified for the 2012 Summer Olympics team In the 100 meters final, she ran 11.07 seconds, placing third, but not without controversy [41] Officials ruled that Felix and her training partner Jeneba Tarmoh were in a dead heat for third place, the final qualification position, after initially declaring Tarmoh ahead A run-off between Tarmoh and Felix was scheduled, but Tarmoh eventually withdrew due to emotional and physical fatigue, conceding the final 100-meter spot to Felix [42] [43] In the 200 meters final at the 2012 Olympic trials, Felix recorded a personal best and a meet record of 21.69 seconds, the third-fastest time an American woman had ever run and the fourth-fastest ever clocked by a female athlete up until that point [44] Carmelita Jeter and Sanya Richards-Ross placed second and third, respectively \n\n2014–15\n\nAfter a nine-month layoff due to a hamstring injury, Felix resumed competition in the 400 meters at the Shanghai Diamond League meet in May 2014, in which she finished fifth with a time of 50.81 seconds She later competed in the 200 meters at the Prefontaine Classic meet, finishing third with a season's best of 22.44 seconds.\n\n2016–17\nFelix began her 2016 season with an uncharacteristically slow start after a gym accident in April, when she dropped from a pull-up bar and landed awkwardly, twisting her right ankle and tearing multiple ligaments [53] Felix was slated to run in a Diamond League meet in Doha as well as the Prefontaine Classic, but pulled out of both meets [54] In early June, she ran the 400 meters in 51.23 seconds at a low-key San Diego meet [54]\n\n\n2018–19\nFelix reduced her racing schedule in 2018, stating: \"In the 19 years that I've been running track, I've never taken a break Never had a year where I took it easy Now that this is kind of a year without a championship, I've had to force myself to have a different approach because my goal is 2020 So, if you guys don't see me at as many of the races as I usually run, don't worry I'm fine I'm just challenging myself to be smarter.\" [65] Later in December 2018, Felix revealed her difficult pregnancy story to espnW [66] During her 32nd-week pregnancy checkup, doctors discovered that Felix had developed pre-eclampsia, a condition that is disproportionately prevalent in African-American women and is marked by high blood pressure along with potentially harmful childbirth effects [67] With the baby's heart rate steadily decreasing, Felix had to deliver her premature daughter via emergency C-section within 48 hours Motivated by her life-threatening experience, Felix testified before the United States House Committee on Ways and Means on the topic of the black maternal mortality crisis: \"Research shows that racial bias in our maternal health care system includes things like providers spending less time with Black mothers, underestimating the pain of their Black patients, ignoring symptoms and dismissing complaints.\" [67]\n\n\nPregnancy emergency\nFelix reduced her racing schedule in 2018, stating: \"In the 19 years that I've been running track, I've never taken a break Never had a year

[67]\n\n\nNike controversy\nFelix furthered her maternal advocacy work in May 2019 by penning an op-ed for The New York Times, accusing her longtime sponsor Nike of refusing to guarantee salary protections for female athletes in the months following pregnancy [68] Her story underscored the earlier allegations made by her former Nike teammates Alysia Montaño and Kara Goucher regarding their pregnancy disputes with the sportswear company [69] In the article, Felix explained that after her contract ended in December 2017, she and Nike negotiated for a contract renewal Planning to start a family in 2018, Felix asked Nike for written financial security, in case her performance yielded subpar results while recovering from childbirth; the negotiators declined after already offering a 70 percent pay cut in this contract proposal [68] Soon after, Felix left and signed a clothing sponsorship deal with the Gap Inc.–owned apparel company Athleta in July 2019, becoming their first sponsored athlete [70] Following the public controversy, Nike altered their maternal policy in August 2019, promising to not apply any performance-related salary reductions for 18 consecutive months, starting eight months before the due date During this period, the sportswear company would also not float the possibility of termination if the athlete chooses to not race due to pregnancy [9]\n\n\nReturn to competition\nIn July 2019, Felix competed in her first race since giving birth in November 2018, finishing sixth in the 400-meter sprint at the U.S national championships in Des

final With her 12th and 13th world championship gold medals, Felix surpassed Usain Bolt for the most golds by any athlete in World Athletics Championships history [72]\n\n\n2020–2022\nFelix trained
