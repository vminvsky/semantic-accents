The league is governed by the Indonesian Football Association (PSSI) and features 18 teams competing for the title and a place in international competitions.\n\n# History\n\n## Origins\n\nThe first professional football league in Indonesia was established in 1930, with the formation of the Java Football Association (JFA). However, it was not until the 1930s that the JFA began to organize a national championship, with teams from across the archipelago participating. The championship was suspended during the Japanese occupation of Indonesia and did not resume until after World War II.\n\n## Foundation\n\nIn 1989, the Indonesian Football Association (PSSI) was re-established, and the league was rebranded as the Piala Perserikatan. The Piala Perserikatan was a national championship that featured teams from across Indonesia, with the winner earning the right to compete in international competitions. However, the league was plagued by corruption and match-fixing, and was eventually suspended in 1995.\n\n## Dualism\n\nIn 1994, the PSSI introduced a new league structure, with the establishment of the Liga Indonesia. The Liga Indonesia was a professional league that featured teams from across Indonesia, with the top teams competing for the title and a place in international competitions. However, the league was plagued by dualism, with some teams competing in the Liga Indonesia while others played in the Piala Perserikatan. This dualism led to conflicts and disputes between teams and the PSSI, and was eventually resolved in 2002.\n\n## Government intervention and FIFA suspension\n\nIn 2003, the PSSI was suspended by FIFA due to government interference in the association's affairs. The suspension was lifted in 2004, but the PSSI was still subject to government control, with the government appointing a caretaker committee to oversee the association's affairs. The suspension was eventually lifted in 2011, but the PSSI continued to face challenges and controversies.\n\n## Name change\n\nIn 2017, the PSSI rebranded the league as the Liga 1, following a decision by the association to adopt a new naming convention for its competitions. The name change was part of a broader effort to rebrand the league and attract new sponsors and fans.\n\n# Competition format\n\n## Competition\n\nThe Liga 1 features 18 teams competing in a double-round robin format, with each team playing the others once at home and once away. The team with the most points at the end of the season is crowned the champion, and earns a place in the AFC Champions League.\n\n## Promotion and relegation\n\nThe Liga 1 features a promotion and relegation system, with the top teams in the Liga 2 (the second tier of Indonesian football) earning promotion to the Liga 1. The bottom teams in the Liga 1 are relegated to the Liga 2.\n\n## Video assistant referee\n\nIn 2019, the PSSI introduced video assistant referee (VAR) technology to the Liga 1, in an effort to improve the accuracy and fairness of the competition.\n\n# Clubs\n\n## Champions\n\nThe following is a list of the Liga 1 champions:\n\n* 1994: PSIS Semarang\n* 1995: PSIM Yogyakarta\n* 1996: PSIM Yogyakarta\n* 1997: PSIM Yogyakarta\n* 1998: PSIS Semarang\n* 1999: PSIM Yogyakarta\n* 2000: Pelita Jaya\n* 2001: Persipura Jayapura\n* 2002: Persipura Jayapura\n* 2003: Persipura Jayapura\n* 2004: Persipura Jayapura\n* 2005: Pelita Jaya\n* 2006: Persipura Jayapura\n* 2007: Persebaya Surabaya\n* 2008: Persipura Jayapura\n* 2009: Pelita Jaya\n* 2010: Persipura Jayapura\n* 2011: Persebaya Surabaya\n* 2012: Arema Malang\n* 2013: Persepam Madura United\n* 2014: Persipura Jayapura\n* 2015: Persipura Jayapura\n* 2016: Persib Bandung\n* 2017: Bhayangkara FC\n* 2018: Persib Bandung\n* 2019: Bali United\n* 2020: Persebaya Surabaya\n* 2021: Bali United\n* 2022: Persib Bandung\n\n## Performance by clubs\n\nThe following is a list of the top 10 teams in the Liga 1 by performance:\n\n1.

This allows users to modify the game, fix bugs, and create new content, as well as distribute modified versions of the game.\n\n**Definition and differentiation**\n\nOpen-source video games are often contrasted with proprietary video games, which are closed-source and owned by a single company. Open-source games can be distributed under a variety of licenses, such as the GNU General Public License (GPL) or the MIT License, which dictate how the source code can be used and modified. The open-source model allows for a high degree of community involvement and collaboration, as well as flexibility and customization.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe concept of open-source software, where the source code is freely available for modification and redistribution, originated in the 1970s and 1980s. The first open-source software licenses were developed in the 1980s, and the term \"open-source\" was first coined in 1998. The video game industry was initially slow to adopt open-source principles, but began to change in the 2000s.\n\n**History**\n\n### Beginnings and early games\n\nThe first open-source video game was likely the game \"Escape\" by John Carmack, a programmer who later co-founded id Software. Released in 1990, \"Escape\" was a simple game written in C and distributed under a permissive license. In the early 1990s, other games such as \"Wolfenstein 3D\" and \"Doom\" were released under similar licenses. However, these early open-source games were relatively rare and often had limited functionality.\n\n### 3D games and source releases\n\nThe release of 3D games with open-source licenses marked a significant turning point for the genre. Games such as \"Minecraft\" (2011) and \"Terraria\" (2011) were released with open-source licenses, allowing players to modify and distribute the game. This led to a surge in interest in open-source game development, as well as the creation of new game engines and tools.\n\n### Rise in popularity and diversity\n\nThe 2010s saw a significant increase in the popularity of open-source video games, with the release of titles such as \"Freedroid\" (2012), \"OpenTTD\" (2012), and \"Starbound\" (2014). This diversity of games and game engines led to a proliferation of open-source game development communities, where developers could collaborate and share knowledge.\n\n### Greater organization\n\nAs the open-source game development community grew, so did the need for organization and coordination. In 2011, the Open Game Project (OGP) was established, providing a common platform for open-source game development and distribution. The OGP also developed guidelines and best practices for open-source game development, including the creation of a unified license framework.\n\n### Hubs and development teams\n\nThe growth of the open-source game development community also led to the creation of hubs and development teams. These teams, often comprised of volunteers, worked on specific games or game engines, sharing resources and expertise. Hubs such as the Open Game Project and the Open Source Game Development (OSGD) network provided a centralized location for developers to collaborate and share knowledge.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Open-source software\n* Video game development\n* Game engine\n* Open-source license\n* Community-driven development\n\n**References**\n\n* **External links**\n\n* Open Game Project\n* Open Source Game Development (OSGD) network\n* Open-source game development community\n* List of open-source video games", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Open-source_video_game\" following this outline:\n\n#Definition and differentiation\n#Background\n#History\n##Beginnings and early games\n##3D games and source releases\n##Rise in popularity and diversity\n##Greater organization\n##Hubs and development teams\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The couple is invited to dine at a luxurious restaurant, Hawthorne, run by the enigmatic chef, Julian Slowik (Ralph Fiennes). As they arrive at the restaurant, they meet the other guests, including a group of wealthy patrons who are eager to indulge in Slowik's culinary creations.\n\nAs the evening progresses, it becomes clear that Slowik has a sinister motive behind his menu, which includes dishes that are not only exquisite but also strangely unsettling.

The score was designed to be haunting and unsettling, with a focus on piano and strings. The music added to the film's sense of tension and unease, making it a key element in the film's overall atmosphere.\n\n## Release\n\nThe Menu was released on November 18, 2022, in the United States and the United Kingdom. The film premiered at the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival, where it received critical acclaim. The film's release was accompanied by a marketing campaign that highlighted the film's unique blend of thriller and drama, as well as its stunning visuals and performances.\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nThe Menu was a commercial success, grossing over $46 million at the domestic box office and over $100 million worldwide.

The film is a prequel to the Minions film series and serves as a spin-off of the Despicable Me franchise. The movie follows the origin story of the Minions, specifically the young Gru, a 12-year-old supervillain-in-training, as he forms a partnership with the Minions and becomes a mastermind of evil.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place in the 1970s, where we are introduced to a young Gru, a 12-year-old boy who aspires to become a supervillain. Gru idolizes the world's greatest supervillains, including the Vicious 6, a group of six powerful villains who have taken over the world. Gru's dream is to join the Vicious 6, but they reject him, deeming him too young and inexperienced.\n\nFeeling defeated, Gru visits the Minions' jungle, where he meets Kevin, Stuart, and Bob, a trio of lovable and dim-witted creatures.

It is characterized by its emphasis on the existence of a higher, eternal realm of abstract Forms or Ideas, and the concept of the universe as a hierarchical, emanating system. Neoplatonism had a profound impact on the development of Western philosophy, influencing various branches of thought, including Christianity, Gnosticism, and Islamic philosophy.\n\nOrigins of the term\n-------------------\n\nThe term \"Neoplatonism\" was coined in the 18th century to distinguish the school of thought from the earlier Platonism of ancient Greece. The term is a combination of \"neo,\" meaning new, and \"Platonism,\" referring to the philosophical system of Plato.\n\nOrigins and history of classical Neoplatonism\n-----------------------------------------\n\n### Hellenism\n\nNeoplatonism originated in the context of Hellenism, the cultural and philosophical heritage of ancient Greece. The Hellenistic period saw the rise of philosophical schools, including Stoicism, Epicureanism, and Platonism. Neoplatonism emerged as a response to the challenges posed by these schools and the changing intellectual climate of the 3rd century AD.\n\n### Ammonius Saccas\n\nAmmonius Saccas (c. 175-242 AD) is often considered the founder of Neoplatonism. A philosopher and teacher from Alexandria, Ammonius was influenced by the teachings of Plato and the mystical traditions of Hellenism. His students included Origen and Plotinus, who would go on to play a crucial role in the development of Neoplatonism.\n\n### Plotinus\n\nPlotinus (c. 205-270 AD) was a philosopher from Egypt who traveled extensively throughout the Mediterranean, studying with various teachers, including Ammonius Saccas. He founded the Neoplatonic school in Rome, where he taught and wrote extensively on philosophical topics. Plotinus' teachings emphasized the importance of the One, the concept of emanations, and the idea of a hierarchical universe.\n\n### Porphyry\n\nPorphyry (c. 234-305 AD) was a student of Plotinus and a prominent Neoplatonic philosopher. He wrote commentaries on Plotinus' works and produced his own philosophical treatises. Porphyry's most famous work, the Isagoge, is a introduction to logic and the study of philosophy.\n\n### Iamblichus\n\nIamblichus (c. 245-325 AD) was a Neoplatonic philosopher from Damascus. He was a prolific writer and teacher who emphasized the importance of mysticism and theurgy in Neoplatonic philosophy. Iamblichus' teachings were influential in the development of Neoplatonism and its interaction with Christianity.\n\n### Academies\n\nThe Neoplatonists established several philosophical academies throughout the Mediterranean, including the school in Rome founded by Plotinus. These academies served as centers of learning and intellectual inquiry, attracting students and scholars from across the ancient world.\n\n### Hypatia\n\nHypatia (c. 350-415 AD) was a Neoplatonic philosopher and mathematician from Alexandria. She was a prominent teacher and scholar who played a crucial role in the intellectual life of Alexandria. Hypatia's teachings emphasized the importance of reason and the study of philosophy.\n\n### Proclus\n\nProclus (c. 412-485 AD) was a Neoplatonic philosopher from Athens. He was a prominent teacher and writer who emphasized the importance of mysticism and theurgy in Neoplatonic philosophy. Proclus' teachings were influential in the development of Neoplatonism and its interaction with Christianity.\n\nIdeas\n-----\n\n### The One\n\nThe concept of the One is central to Neoplatonism, representing the highest, most fundamental reality. The One is often described as the source of all existence, the ultimate goal of human striving, and the foundation of the universe.\n\n### Emanations\n\nNeoplatonism posits that the universe is a hierarchical, emanating system, with the One at its source. The first emanation from the One is the nous, or intellect, which gives rise to the world-soul. The world-soul, in turn, gives rise to the phenomenal world.\n\n### Demiurge or nous\n\nThe demiurge, or nous, is the first emanation from the One. The demiurge is often described as a creative, benevolent force that shapes the universe and gives rise to the world-soul.\n\n### World-soul\n\nThe world-soul is the second emanation from the One. The world-soul is often described as a divine, animating force that gives life and order to the universe.\n\n### Phenomenal world\n\nThe phenomenal world is the lowest level of the emanating system, representing the material, sensory realm of existence. The phenomenal world is often described as a realm of imperfection and illusion, in contrast to the higher, eternal realms of the One and the world-soul.\n\nCelestial hierarchy\n------------------\n\nNeoplatonism posits a hierarchical universe, with the One at its source and the phenomenal world at its lowest level. The celestial hierarchy is often described as a series of emanations, with each level giving rise to the next.\n\nEvil\n----\n\nNeoplatonism does not posit the existence of a separate, evil entity. Instead, evil is often described as a lack or absence of being, a failure to participate in the higher, eternal realms of the One and the world-soul.\n\nReturn to the One\n----------------\n\nThe ultimate goal of human striving in Neoplatonism is to return to the One, to reunite with the highest, most fundamental reality. This return is often described as a process of spiritual purification and liberation, in which the individual transcends the limitations of the phenomenal world and achieves union with the divine.\n\nInfluence\n---------\n\n### Early Christianity\n\nNeoplatonism had a profound impact on the development of early Christianity. Many Christian thinkers, including Origen and Pseudo-Dionysius, were influenced by Neoplatonic ideas and incorporated them into their theological systems.\n\n### Augustine\n\nAugustine, one of the most influential Christian thinkers of all time, was deeply influenced by Neoplatonism. Augustine's teachings on the nature of God, the soul, and the universe were shaped by Neoplatonic ideas.\n\n### Origen and Pseudo-Dionysius\n\nOrigen and Pseudo-Dionysius were two Christian thinkers who were deeply influenced by Neoplatonism. Origen's teachings on the nature of God and the universe were shaped by Neoplatonic ideas, while Pseudo-Dionysius' writings on the mystical life were heavily influenced by Neoplatonic mysticism.\n\n### Gnosticism\n\nGnosticism, a mystical, dualistic religious movement, was influenced by Neoplatonism. Gnostic thinkers often incorporated Neoplatonic ideas into their theological systems, emphasizing the importance of spiritual knowledge and the attainment of gnosis.\n\nByzantine education\n------------------\n\nNeoplatonism played a crucial role in the development of Byzantine education. The Neoplatonic school in Athens, founded by Proclus, was a center of learning and intellectual inquiry, attracting students and scholars from across the Mediterranean.\n\nIslamic neoplatonism\n-------------------\n\nNeoplatonism had a profound impact on the development of Islamic philosophy. Many Islamic thinkers, including Ibn Sina and Ibn Arabi, were influenced by Neoplatonic ideas and incorporated them into their philosophical systems.\n\nJewish thought\n--------------\n\nNeoplatonism had a profound impact on the development of Jewish thought. Many Jewish thinkers, including Maimonides, were influenced by Neoplatonic ideas and incorporated them into their philosophical systems.\n\nMedieval Christian Thought\n-------------------------\n\nNeoplatonism continued to influence medieval Christian thought, with many thinkers, including Thomas Aquinas, incorporating Neoplatonic ideas into their theological systems.\n\nWestern Renaissance\n-------------------\n\nNeoplatonism played a crucial role in the development of the Western Renaissance. Many thinkers, including Marsilio Ficino and Pico della Mirandola, were influenced by Neoplatonic ideas and incorporated them into their philosophical systems.\n\nCambridge Platonists (17th century)\n--------------------------------\n\nThe Cambridge Platonists, a group of English philosophers, were influenced by Neoplatonic ideas. They emphasized the importance of reason and the study of philosophy, and incorporated Neoplatonic ideas into their theological systems.\n\nModern neoplatonism\n-------------------\n\nNeoplatonism continues to influence modern thought, with many thinkers, including Aldous Huxley and Alan Watts, incorporating Neoplatonic ideas into their philosophical systems.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Platonism\n* Gnosticism\n* Mysticism\n* Theurgy\n* Neopythagoreanism\n* Hermeticism\n\nNotes\n-----\n\n* This article is a general overview of Neoplatonism and its history, and is not intended to be a comprehensive or definitive treatment of the subject.\n* Neoplatonism is a complex and multifaceted philosophical system, and this article may not fully capture its nuances and complexities.\n* The article is based on a variety of sources, including primary and secondary literature, and is intended to provide a neutral, encyclopedic account of Neoplatonism.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* Gerson, L.

The film is based on the 2016 children's novel of the same name by Aaron Blabey. The film follows a group of animal outcasts who plan to pull off the biggest heist in history.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place in a world where animals live among humans, but are considered inferior and subject to animal control laws. The story revolves around a group of four animal outcasts: Mr. Wolf (Jason Mantzoukas), a wolf who is tired of being stereotyped as a predator; Mr. Snake (Ben Schwartz), a snake who is an expert hacker; Ms. Tarantella (Awkwafina), a tarantula who is a skilled thief; and Professor Rat (Ike Barinholtz), a rat who is a master of disguise.\n\nThe group is brought together by their shared desire to break free from their respective stereotypes and become the \"good guys.\" They plan to steal a valuable treasure and use the money to fund a series of community service projects that will help animals like them. However, their plans are complicated by the arrival of a new animal control officer, Detective Balthazar (Will Arnett), who is determined to catch them.\n\nAs the group navigates their heist, they must also deal with their own personal demons and the consequences of their actions. Along the way, they learn valuable lessons about teamwork, loyalty, and the importance of being true to oneself.\n\n**Voice cast**\n\n* Jason Mantzoukas as Mr. Wolf\n* Ben Schwartz as Mr. Snake\n* Awkwafina as Ms. Tarantella\n* Ike Barinholtz as Professor Rat\n* Will Arnett as Detective Balthazar\n* Craig Robinson as Floyd\n* RZA as Dru\n* Alex Borstein as Anna\n* Lil Rel Howery as Honey\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe idea for _The Bad Guys_ was first conceived in 2014, when DreamWorks Animation acquired the rights to the children's novel of the same name. The film's director, Pierre Perifel, was a relatively new hire at the studio at the time, and he was tasked with developing the project into a feature-length film. Perifel worked closely with the film's writers, including Mark Schweizer and Etan Cohen, to develop the story and characters.\n\n### Animation, design, and influences\n\nThe animation style for _The Bad Guys_ was inspired by the work of classic animators such as Hayao Miyazaki and Chuck Jones. The film's characters were designed to be visually stylized and exaggerated, with a focus on their personalities and quirks. The animation process involved a combination of computer-generated imagery (CGI) and traditional animation techniques.\n\nThe film's design was also influenced by the work of concept artist and illustrator, Chris Appelhans. Appelhans' distinctive style, which blends traditional and digital media, was a key element in the development of the film's visual identity.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe music for _The Bad Guys_ was composed by Mark Mothersbaugh, a veteran composer who has worked on a wide range of films and television shows. The score is a mix of action-oriented and comedic themes, which are designed to enhance the film's humor and excitement.\n\nThe soundtrack also features a range of original songs, including \"Bad,\" a catchy and upbeat tune that serves as the film's main theme. The soundtrack was released in conjunction with the film's theatrical release and features a range of bonus tracks and remixes.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nThe marketing campaign for _The Bad Guys_ was extensive and included a range of promotional materials, including trailers, TV spots, and print ads. The film's trailer, which was released in April 2022, was a key element in the marketing campaign, and helped to generate buzz and excitement for the film.\n\nThe film's poster, which features the main characters in a series of humorous and action-packed poses, was also a key element in the marketing campaign. The poster was designed to capture the film's lighthearted and comedic tone, and to appeal to a wide range of audiences.\n\n**Release**\n\n### Theatrical\n\n_The Bad Guys_ was released in theaters on March 17, 2022, in the United States and Canada. The film was distributed by Universal Pictures and was released in a range of formats, including 2D, 3D, and IMAX.\n\nThe film received a wide release, with over 3,500 screens in the United States and Canada. The film's opening weekend was a success, with a gross of over $20 million in the United States and Canada.\n\n### Home media and streaming\n\n_The Bad Guys_ was released on home media and streaming platforms in June 2022, just a few months after its theatrical release. The film was released on a range of platforms, including Blu-ray, DVD, and digital streaming services such as Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV.\n\nThe film's home media release included a range of bonus features, including deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes footage, and cast and crew interviews. The film's digital release also included a range of bonus features, including a behind-the-scenes featurette and a making-of documentary.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Box office\n\n_The Bad Guys_ was a commercial success, grossing over $340 million worldwide. The film's gross was fueled by its strong opening weekend and its wide release in a range of markets.\n\nThe film's performance was also boosted by its positive word-of-mouth and its appeal to a wide range of audiences. The film's Rotten Tomatoes score of 81% and its Metacritic score of 75 out of 100 helped to generate buzz and excitement for the film.\n\n### Critical response\n\n_The Bad Guys_ received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising the film's humor, animation, and voice cast. The film's success was also fueled by its appeal to both children and adults, with many praising the film's lighthearted and comedic tone.\n\nSome critics praised the film's animation, which was described as \"stunning\" and \"visually stunning.\" Others praised the film's voice cast, which was described as \"talented\" and \"funny.\"\n\nHowever, some critics noted that the film's story was predictable and that the characters were not as well-developed as they could have been. Others noted that the film's pacing was a bit uneven and that the film's themes were not as complex as they could have been.\n\n### Accolades\n\n_The Bad Guys_ was nominated for a range of awards, including the Annie Award for Best Animated Feature and the Golden Trailer Award for Best Animation. The film's voice cast was also nominated for a range of awards, including the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.\n\n**Future**\n\n### Sequel\n\nA sequel to _The Bad Guys_ is currently in development, with Pierre Perifel set to return as director. The sequel is expected to be released in 2024 and will feature the same voice cast as the original film.\n\nThe sequel is expected to follow a similar plot to the original film, with the main characters facing a new challenge and learning valuable lessons about teamwork and loyalty.

From its origins in school dramas and nativity scenes to its emergence as a distinct art form, Ukrainian opera has evolved significantly, influenced by various cultural and historical factors. This article provides an overview of the development of opera in Ukraine, including its origins, obstacles, emergence, periods of resurgence, and contemporary state.\n\n**Origins**\n\nUkrainian opera has its roots in the early 19th century, when Ukrainian school dramas (shkilʹna dramy) were performed in schools and villages. These dramas were often based on folk tales and legends, and were designed to educate and entertain the audience. The use of music in these performances was minimal, but it laid the groundwork for the development of Ukrainian opera.\n\n## Shkilʹna dramy (school dramas)\n\nShkilʹna dramy were an important part of Ukrainian cultural life in the 19th century. These performances were often held in schools and villages, and were typically based on folk tales and legends. The music used in these performances was minimal, but it helped to establish a connection between the audience and the story being told.\n\n## Vertepy (nativity scenes)\n\nVertepy, or nativity scenes, were another important part of Ukrainian cultural life in the 19th century. These performances were often held in churches and cathedrals, and were typically based on the Nativity story from the Bible. The use of music in these performances was more developed than in shkilʹna dramy, and helped to establish a connection between the audience and the story being told.\n\n## Vaudeville\n\nVaudeville, a type of variety show, was also influential in the development of Ukrainian opera. Vaudeville shows often featured music, dance, and drama, and helped to establish a connection between the audience and the performers.\n\n**Operetta**\n\nOperetta, a type of light opera, was also influential in the development of Ukrainian opera. Operettas often featured music, dance, and comedy, and helped to establish a connection between the audience and the performers.\n\n**Obstacles to the development of Ukrainian-language opera**\n\nDespite the influence of shkilʹna dramy, vertepy, vaudeville, and operetta, the development of Ukrainian-language opera was hindered by various obstacles. One of the main obstacles was the lack of a standardized Ukrainian language, which made it difficult to create operas that could be understood by a wide audience.\n\nAnother obstacle was the influence of Russian culture, which dominated Ukrainian cultural life in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Many Ukrainian artists and intellectuals were influenced by Russian culture, and this influence often manifested itself in their work.\n\n**Emergence of Ukrainian opera**\n\nDespite these obstacles, Ukrainian opera began to emerge in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. One of the key figures in the development of Ukrainian opera was Mykola Lysenko, a Ukrainian composer and musician.\n\n## Mykola Lysenko\n\nMykola Lysenko was born in 1842 in Poltava, Ukraine. He was a composer, musician, and conductor, and is considered one of the most important figures in the development of Ukrainian opera. Lysenko was influenced by Russian culture, but he also drew on Ukrainian folk music and traditions to create a unique and distinctive style.\n\n## Lysenko's contemporaries and successors\n\nLysenko's contemporaries and successors included other important figures in the development of Ukrainian opera. These included composers such as Arkady Fomin and Vladimir Zolotaryov, who helped to establish Ukrainian opera as a distinct art form.\n\n**Period of resurgence**\n\nThe period of resurgence in Ukrainian opera began in the 1910s and continued until the 1930s. During this time, there was a renewed interest in Ukrainian culture and language, and many Ukrainian artists and intellectuals began to create works that reflected this interest.\n\n## 1910s\n\nThe 1910s were a time of great change in Ukraine. The country was undergoing a period of rapid modernization, and many Ukrainian artists and intellectuals were influenced by avant-garde movements such as Expressionism and Futurism.\n\n## 1920s and early 1930s\n\nThe 1920s and early 1930s were a time of great creativity in Ukrainian opera. Many new operas were written, and existing operas were revised and updated to reflect the changing cultural and social landscape of Ukraine.\n\n### Historical opera\n\nHistorical opera was an important genre in Ukrainian opera during the period of resurgence. Many operas were written about historical figures and events, and helped to establish a connection between the audience and the past.\n\n**Stalinism (1932–1956)**\n\nThe period of Stalinism had a profound impact on Ukrainian opera. During this time, the Soviet government imposed strict controls on artistic expression, and many Ukrainian artists and intellectuals were persecuted for their work.\n\n## World War II\n\nWorld War II had a devastating impact on Ukraine. Many Ukrainian cities and towns were destroyed, and millions of Ukrainians were killed or displaced. The war also had a profound impact on Ukrainian opera, as many operas were written about the war and its aftermath.\n\n## 1945–1953\n\nThe period from 1945 to 1953 was a time of great change in Ukrainian opera. Many new operas were written, and existing operas were revised and updated to reflect the changing cultural and social landscape of Ukraine.\n\n**1953–1991**\n\nThe period from 1953 to 1991 was a time of significant change in Ukrainian opera. Many new operas were written, and existing operas were revised and updated to reflect the changing cultural and social landscape of Ukraine.\n\n## 1953–1970\n\nThe period from 1953 to 1970 was a time of great creativity in Ukrainian opera. Many new operas were written, and existing operas were revised and updated to reflect the changing cultural and social landscape of Ukraine.\n\n## 1970s\n\nThe 1970s were a time of great change in Ukrainian opera. Many new operas were written, and existing operas were revised and updated to reflect the changing cultural and social landscape of Ukraine.\n\n## 1980s\n\nThe 1980s were a time of great creativity in Ukrainian opera. Many new operas were written, and existing operas were revised and updated to reflect the changing cultural and social landscape of Ukraine.\n\n**Post-independence operas**\n\nThe period of post-independence was a time of great change in Ukrainian opera. Many new operas were written, and existing operas were revised and updated to reflect the changing cultural and social landscape of Ukraine.\n\n**Opera houses**\n\nUkraine has a number of opera houses, including the National Opera of Ukraine, which is located in Kiev. Other notable opera houses include the Lviv Opera, the Kharkov Opera, and the Odessa Opera.\n\n**References**\n\n* Notes\n* Citations\n* Sources\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n**External links**\n\n* \n* \n*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Opera_in_Ukraine\" following this outline:\n\n#Origins\n##Shkilʹna dramy (school dramas)\n##Vertepy (nativity scenes)\n##Vaudeville\n#Operetta\n#Obstacles to the development of Ukrainian-language opera\n#Emergence of Ukrainian opera\n##Mykola Lysenko\n##Lysenko's contemporaries and successors\n#Period of resurgence\n##1910s\n##1920s and early 1930s\n###Historical opera\n#Stalinism (1932–1956)\n##World War II\n##1945–1953\n#1953–1991\n##1953–1970\n##1970s\n##1980s\n#Post-independence operas\n#Opera houses\n#References\n##Notes\n##Citations\n##Sources\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The documents were first reported on by journalist Matt Taibbi in December 2022, and subsequent reports have shed light on various aspects of Twitter's approach to content moderation.\n\n**Background**\n\nTwitter, a social media platform with over 440 million active users, has long faced criticism for its content moderation policies. While the platform has implemented various measures to combat hate speech, harassment, and misinformation, many have accused it of inconsistent and biased application of these policies. The Twitter Files aim to provide insight into the company's decision-making processes and the rationales behind its content moderation practices.\n\n**Topics**\n\n### Content Moderation of New York Post Story\n\nIn October 2020, the New York Post published an article alleging that Hunter Biden, son of then-presidential candidate Joe Biden, had engaged in corrupt business dealings in Ukraine. Twitter initially flagged the article as \"hacked materials\" and prevented users from sharing it. This move was widely criticized as an example of Twitter's inconsistent content moderation policies and perceived bias against conservative voices.\n\nTwitter's decision was based on a policy prohibiting the sharing of hacked materials, which was applied to the New York Post article despite its not being clear that the materials were hacked. The decision sparked controversy, with many accusing Twitter of suppressing the story and engaging in election interference.\n\n### Visibility Filtering\n\nTwitter's visibility filtering system allows users to hide tweets from specific users or hashtags. While intended to reduce harassment and abuse, the system has been criticized for its potential to be used as a form of censorship. The Twitter Files reveal that the company has used visibility filtering to suppress tweets from certain users and hashtags, sometimes at the behest of government authorities.\n\n### Attack on the Capitol and Suspension of Donald Trump\n\nOn January 6, 2021, a mob of supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the United States Capitol, leading to violence and destruction. In response, Twitter suspended Trump's account, citing \"risk of further incitement of violence.\" The move sparked controversy, with many accusing Twitter of engaging in censorship and violating Trump's free speech rights.\n\nThe Twitter Files reveal that Twitter had been considering suspending Trump's account for months prior to the January 6 attack, citing concerns about his tweets and their potential to incite violence. However, the company ultimately decided to take action after the attack, citing the need to prevent further harm.\n\n### FBI Communications with Twitter Trust and Safety Team\n\nThe Twitter Files reveal that the FBI had been in regular communication with Twitter's Trust and Safety team, discussing various issues related to content moderation. The communications, which were facilitated through Twitter's \"Twitter Law Enforcement Portal,\" included discussions about specific tweets and users, as well as requests for information about Twitter's content moderation policies.\n\nThe communications have sparked controversy, with many accusing Twitter of collaborating with law enforcement to suppress free speech and engage in censorship. Twitter has maintained that its communications with the FBI were necessary to ensure public safety and prevent the spread of misinformation.\n\n### Relationship with the U.S. Government\n\nThe Twitter Files reveal that Twitter has been in regular communication with the U.S. government, discussing various issues related to content moderation and national security. The communications, which were facilitated through Twitter's \"Twitter Law Enforcement Portal,\" included discussions about specific tweets and users, as well as requests for information about Twitter's content moderation policies.\n\nThe communications have sparked controversy, with many accusing Twitter of collaborating with the government to suppress free speech and engage in censorship. Twitter has maintained that its communications with the government were necessary to ensure public safety and prevent the spread of misinformation.\n\n### Moderation of COVID-19 Content\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Twitter faced criticism for its handling of content related to the pandemic. The platform struggled to balance the need to provide accurate and timely information with the need to prevent the spread of misinformation. The Twitter Files reveal that the company implemented various measures to moderate COVID-19 content, including labeling tweets that contained false or misleading information.\n\nHowever, the measures were not without controversy, with many accusing Twitter of censorship and suppressing free speech. Twitter maintained that its measures were necessary to prevent the spread of misinformation and protect public health.\n\n### Hamilton 68 Dashboard\n\nThe Hamilton 68 Dashboard is a tool developed by the Alliance for Securing Democracy to track and analyze Russian disinformation on social media. The dashboard, which was launched in 2017, uses machine learning algorithms to identify and categorize tweets that contain Russian disinformation.\n\nThe Twitter Files reveal that Twitter collaborated with the Alliance for Securing Democracy to develop the dashboard, providing the organization with access to Twitter's API and other resources. The collaboration sparked controversy, with many accusing Twitter of collaborating with a partisan organization to suppress free speech and engage in censorship.\n\n### Insults Directed to and from Donald Trump and Other Republicans\n\nThroughout the 2020 presidential campaign, Twitter faced criticism for its handling of insults directed to and from Donald Trump and other Republicans. The platform struggled to balance the need to prevent harassment and abuse with the need to protect free speech.\n\nThe Twitter Files reveal that the company implemented various measures to moderate insults directed to and from Trump and other Republicans, including labeling tweets that contained hate speech or harassment. However, the measures were not without controversy, with many accusing Twitter of censorship and suppressing free speech.\n\n### Global Engagement Center\n\nThe Global Engagement Center is a U.S. government agency responsible for countering online disinformation and propaganda. The center, which was established in 2016, works with social media companies to identify and disrupt online disinformation campaigns.\n\nThe Twitter Files reveal that Twitter collaborated with the Global Engagement Center to identify and disrupt online disinformation campaigns. The collaboration sparked controversy, with many accusing Twitter of collaborating with the government to suppress free speech and engage in censorship.\n\n### The Virality Project\n\nThe Virality Project is a research initiative led by the Stanford History Education Group to study the spread of misinformation on social media. The project, which was launched in 2020, uses machine learning algorithms to identify and categorize tweets that contain misinformation.\n\nThe Twitter Files reveal that Twitter collaborated with the Virality Project to develop a tool to identify and categorize tweets that contain misinformation. The collaboration sparked controversy, with many accusing Twitter of collaborating with a partisan organization to suppress free speech and engage in censorship.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### Politicians\n\nMany politicians have weighed in on the Twitter Files, with some accusing Twitter of censorship and others defending the company's content moderation policies. Senator Ted Cruz, for example, accused Twitter of \"censorship\" and \"election interference,\" while Senator Ron Wyden defended Twitter's content moderation policies as necessary to protect public safety.\n\n### FBI\n\nThe FBI has maintained that its communications with Twitter were necessary to ensure public safety and prevent the spread of misinformation. However, the communications have sparked controversy, with many accusing the FBI of collaborating with Twitter to suppress free speech and engage in censorship.\n\n### Legal Scholars\n\nMany legal scholars have weighed in on the Twitter Files, with some arguing that Twitter's content moderation policies are constitutional and others arguing that they are not. Professor Eugene Volokh, for example, argued that Twitter's content moderation policies are protected by the First Amendment, while Professor Bruce Schneier argued that they are not.\n\n### Privacy and Security\n\nThe Twitter Files have sparked controversy about Twitter's handling of user data and privacy. Many have accused Twitter of sharing user data with law enforcement and other third parties, while others have defended the company's practices as necessary to ensure public safety.\n\n### Former Twitter CEO\n\nFormer Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has defended Twitter's content moderation policies as necessary to protect public safety and prevent the spread of misinformation. However, he has also acknowledged that the policies have been imperfect and that the company has made mistakes.\n\n### Journalists\n\nMany journalists have weighed in on the Twitter Files, with some arguing that the documents reveal a pattern of censorship and others arguing that they show that Twitter's content moderation policies are necessary to protect public safety. Matt Taibbi, for example, argued that the documents reveal a pattern of censorship, while others have defended Twitter's policies as necessary to prevent the spread of misinformation.\n\n### Wikipedia Article\n\nThe Wikipedia article on the Twitter Files has sparked controversy, with some arguing that it is biased and others defending it as a neutral and accurate account of the documents. The article has been edited multiple times, with some users accusing others of inserting biased language or removing important information.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe Twitter Files have sparked a wider conversation about social media and free speech, with many arguing that the documents reveal a pattern of censorship and others defending Twitter's content moderation policies as necessary to protect public safety. The documents have also sparked calls for greater transparency and accountability from social media companies, as well as increased regulation of online content.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the Twitter Files has also sparked debate about the role of social media in shaping public discourse and the need for greater regulation of online content. Many have argued that social media companies have too much power and that greater regulation is needed to ensure that they act in the public interest.\n\nAs the controversy surrounding the Twitter Files continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how social media companies will respond and what changes will be made to content moderation policies. One thing is certain, however: the Twitter Files have sparked a wider conversation about social media and free speech that will continue to shape the online landscape for years to come.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Twitter_Files\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Topics\n##No. 1: Content moderation of New York Post story\n##No. 2: Visibility filtering\n##Nos. 3–5: Attack on the Capitol and suspension of Donald Trump\n##Nos. 6–7: FBI communications with Twitter Trust and Safety Team\n##Nos. 8–9: Relationship with the U.S. government\n##No. 10: Moderation of COVID-19 content\n##No. 15: Hamilton 68 Dashboard\n##No. 16: Insults directed to and from Donald Trump and other Republicans\n##No. 17: Global Engagement Center\n##No. 19: The Virality Project\n#Reactions\n##Politicians\n##FBI\n##Legal scholars\n##Privacy and security\n##Former Twitter CEO\n##Journalists\n##Wikipedia article\n#Aftermath\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The storm caused widespread destruction and loss of life, particularly in Libya, where it led to the collapse of dams and subsequent flooding. This article provides an overview of the meteorological history of the storm, its impact on various countries, and the subsequent aftermath.\n\n# **Meteorological History**\n\nStorm Daniel was a complex weather system that formed in the Mediterranean Sea on June 10, 2023. It was characterized by a low-pressure system that intensified over the next few days, leading to heavy rainfall and strong winds. The storm system was fueled by a combination of atmospheric and oceanic factors, including a strong subtropical jet stream and a moist air mass from the Mediterranean.\n\nThe storm system moved northward along the eastern coast of the Mediterranean, affecting several countries, including Greece, Turkey, and Bulgaria.

However, many residents failed to heed the warnings, leading to widespread displacement and loss of life.\n\n### **Derna dam failures**\n\nThe collapse of dams in Derna was a major factor in the catastrophic damage caused by Storm Daniel. The dams were unable to withstand the heavy rainfall and strong winds, leading to a rapid rise in water levels.

In a top-four primary, all candidates are listed on the same ballot, and voters may choose any candidate they prefer. The top four candidates with the most votes in the primary election then move on to the general election.\n\n**Usage**\n\nThe top-four primary has been used in various forms in different states and countries. The two most notable examples are in Alaska and Missouri.\n\n### **Alaska**\n\nAlaska has used a top-four primary system since 2020, after voters approved a ballot measure in 2010 to change the state's primary system from a traditional top-two system to a top-four system. In Alaska, all candidates are listed on the same ballot in the primary election, and the top four candidates with the most votes advance to the general election. This system has been used for both partisan and non-partisan elections in Alaska.\n\n### **Missouri**\n\nMissouri has used a top-four primary system since 2020, after voters approved a ballot measure in 2016 to change the state's primary system from a traditional top-two system to a top-four system. In Missouri, all candidates are listed on the same ballot in the primary election, and the top four candidates with the most votes advance to a second primary election, where the top two candidates with the most votes in that election advance to the general election.\n\n## **Top-five**\n\nSome states have considered or implemented a top-five primary system, where the top five candidates with the most votes in the primary election advance to the general election. One notable example is Nevada.\n\n### **Nevada**\n\nNevada considered implementing a top-five primary system in 2020, but the measure was ultimately rejected by voters. In Nevada, a top-five system would have required the top five candidates with the most votes in the primary election to advance to the general election.\n\n**Benefits**\n\nThe top-four primary has several potential benefits, including:\n\n* **Increased voter choice**: By allowing voters to choose any candidate they prefer in the primary election, the top-four primary gives voters more options and allows them to participate more fully in the electoral process.\n* **More diverse candidates**: By allowing more candidates to participate in the primary election, the top-four primary can lead to a more diverse pool of candidates, which can be beneficial for voters who want to choose from a range of perspectives and experiences.\n* **Fewer spoilers**: By allowing more candidates to participate in the primary election, the top-four primary can reduce the impact of spoilers, which can be a problem in traditional top-two systems.\n\n**Drawbacks**\n\nHowever, the top-four primary also has several potential drawbacks, including:\n\n## **Vote splitting**\n\nOne of the potential drawbacks of the top-four primary is vote splitting, which occurs when voters split their votes among multiple candidates, allowing a candidate to win the primary election with a relatively small number of votes.\n\n### **Primary**\n\nIn the primary election, vote splitting can occur when voters are divided among multiple candidates who are competing for the same position. This can lead to a candidate winning the primary election with a relatively small number of votes, while other candidates who may have been more popular with voters as a whole do not advance to the general election.\n\n### **General**\n\nIn the general election, vote splitting can occur when voters who might otherwise support a particular candidate instead vote for a minor party candidate or a write-in candidate. This can lead to a candidate winning the general election with a relatively small number of votes, while other candidates who may have been more popular with voters as a whole do not win.\n\n## **Voter deception**\n\nAnother potential drawback of the top-four primary is voter deception, which occurs when voters are deceived into voting for a particular candidate because they believe that candidate is more likely to win the primary election.\n\n### **Primary**\n\nIn the primary election, voter deception can occur when voters are persuaded to vote for a particular candidate because they believe that candidate is more likely to win the primary election. This can lead to voters casting their ballots based on a false assumption, rather than on their true preferences.\n\n### **General**\n\nIn the general election, voter deception can occur when voters are persuaded to vote for a particular candidate because they believe that candidate is more likely to win the general election. This can lead to voters casting their ballots based on a false assumption, rather than on their true preferences.\n\n**Variations**\n\nThere are several variations of the top-four primary system, including:\n\n## **Final Five Voting**\n\nOne variation of the top-four primary is the final five voting system, which is used in some jurisdictions. In this system, the top five candidates with the most votes in the primary election advance to the general election, rather than the top four.\n\n## **Primary**\n\nAnother variation of the top-four primary is the primary-only system, in which the primary election is the only election and the candidate with the most votes wins the election.\n\n## **Post-primary**\n\nA post-primary system is another variation of the top-four primary, in which the primary election is followed by a second election in which the top two candidates with the most votes in the primary election compete.\n\n## **General**\n\nA general election-only system is another variation of the top-four primary, in which the general election is the only election and the candidate with the most votes wins the election.\n\n## **Summary**\n\nIn summary, the top-four primary is an electoral system used in some jurisdictions to determine the candidates who will advance to the general election in a particular election cycle. The top-four primary has several potential benefits, including increased voter choice, more diverse candidates, and fewer spoilers. However, the top-four primary also has several potential drawbacks, including vote splitting and voter deception. There are several variations of the top-four primary system, including the final five voting system, the primary-only system, the post-primary system, and the general election-only system.\n\n**See also**\n\n* **Top-two primary**: A primary election system in which the top two candidates with the most votes advance to the general election.\n* **Ranked-choice voting**: A voting system in which voters rank candidates in order of preference.\n* **Instant-runoff voting**: A voting system in which voters rank candidates in order of preference, and the candidate with the fewest first-choice votes is eliminated in each round.\n\n**External links**\n\n* **Alaska Division of Elections**: The official website of the Alaska Division of Elections, which provides information on the top-four primary system in Alaska.\n* **Missouri Secretary of State**: The official website of the Missouri Secretary of State, which provides information on the top-four primary system in Missouri.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Top-four_primary\" following this outline:\n\n#Usage\n##Top-four\n###Alaska\n###Missouri\n##Top-five\n###Nevada\n#Benefits\n#Drawbacks\n##Vote splitting\n###Primary\n###General\n##Voter deception\n#Variations\n##Final Five Voting\n##Primary\n##Post-primary\n##General\n##Summary\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The invasion led to a significant escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, which had been ongoing since 2014. The following is a detailed timeline of the major events of the invasion.\n\n## #Prelude\n\nThe roots of the conflict date back to 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine. The annexation was widely condemned by the international community, and it led to a significant deterioration of relations between Russia and the West. In the years that followed, tensions between Russia and Ukraine continued to escalate, with fighting breaking out in eastern Ukraine between Ukrainian government forces and Russian-backed separatists.\n\nIn the months leading up to the invasion, Russia began to build up its military presence along the border with Ukraine. The build-up was accompanied by a significant increase in military activity, including the deployment of troops, tanks, and artillery. The international community responded to the build-up by imposing sanctions on Russia and warning of the consequences of an invasion.\n\n## #Initial invasion\n\nOn 24 February 2022, Russia launched a large-scale military operation against Ukraine. The operation began with a series of missile strikes against Ukrainian military targets, followed by the deployment of troops and tanks into Ukraine. The initial invasion was focused on the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists had been fighting Ukrainian government forces since 2014.\n\nThe initial invasion was marked by a significant difference in military capabilities between the two sides. Russia had a significant advantage in terms of military equipment and manpower, and it was able to quickly gain control of large areas of territory. Ukrainian forces were initially caught off guard, and they were forced to retreat in the face of the Russian advance.\n\n## #Southeastern front\n\nThe southeastern front of the conflict refers to the area of Ukraine that borders Russia and the Black Sea. This region includes the cities of Kherson and Mariupol, which were the focus of intense fighting in the early stages of the invasion.\n\nIn the early days of the invasion, Russian forces made significant gains in the southeastern region, capturing several key cities and towns. However, Ukrainian forces were able to hold out in the city of Mariupol, and they were able to inflict significant losses on the Russian military.\n\nThe fighting in the southeastern region was marked by a series of intense battles, including the Battle of Mariupol, which lasted for several weeks.

Born in 1745 in Guadeloupe, he rose to prominence in Parisian society through his exceptional musical talent and his status as a member of the nobility.\n\n#Early life\n\nJoseph Boulogne was born in 1745 to George de Saint-Georges, a wealthy plantation owner and a member of the nobility, and his enslaved mother, Nanon Boulogne. Despite being born into slavery, Joseph was granted his freedom by his father and given the title of Chevalier de Saint-Georges. This privileged upbringing exposed him to the arts and culture, and he began his musical education at a young age.\n\n#Musical life and career\n\nSaint-Georges' musical talent was evident from an early age, and he began his studies as a violinist under the tutelage of Jean-Baptiste Anatole, a French violinist. He later continued his education in Paris, where he studied music and fencing under the guidance of René Louis de Voyer de Paulmy d'Argenson, a French nobleman. Saint-Georges' musical career flourished in Paris, where he gained recognition as a virtuosic violinist and composer.\n\n#Operas\n\nSaint-Georges composed several operas during his lifetime, including \"Ernestine\" and \"L'amant anonyme\". His operatic works were well-received by the Parisian public, and he became known for his unique blend of classical and folk music styles.\n\n#Social life in Paris\n\nSaint-Georges was a prominent figure in Parisian society, known for his exceptional musical talent and his status as a member of the nobility. He was a regular guest at salon gatherings and was admired for his wit and intelligence.\n\n##St. Georges assaulted\n\nDespite his privileged position, Saint-Georges was subjected to racial violence in Paris. In 1796, he was assaulted by a group of men who threw him into the Seine River. Saint-Georges survived the attack, but the incident highlighted the racism and prejudice that he faced in his daily life.\n\n#Two trips to London\n\nSaint-Georges traveled to London twice during his lifetime, where he performed as a violinist and composer. His first trip to London took place in 1774, and he was received with great enthusiasm by the British public.\n\n##Second trip\n\nSaint-Georges' second trip to London occurred in 1786, and he was once again hailed as a musical virtuoso. During this trip, he met with prominent figures such as George Frideric Handel and Johann Christian Bach.\n\n#Lille\n\nSaint-Georges visited Lille in 1789, where he performed as a violinist and composer. His performances in Lille were well-received by the local public, and he became known for his exceptional musical talent.\n\n#Military career\n\nSaint-Georges served in the French army during the French Revolution, where he rose to the rank of captain. He was known for his bravery and his skill as a fencer.\n\n#Possible Saint-Domingue visit\n\nSome historians believe that Saint-Georges visited Saint-Domingue during his lifetime, but this has yet to be confirmed. Saint-Domingue was a French colony in the Caribbean that played a significant role in the Haitian Revolution.\n\n#Death\n\nSaint-Georges died in 1799, at the age of 54, in Paris. He was buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery, where many prominent French figures are interred.\n\n#Home\n\nThe Chevalier de Saint-Georges' home in Paris was a testament to his status as a member of the nobility. His residence was a grand townhouse with a beautiful garden, where he would often entertain guests.\n\n#Works\n\nSaint-Georges was a prolific composer and left behind a significant body of work.

The season began on 14 August 2021 and concluded on 22 May 2022.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe 2021–22 Premier League season was marked by a fierce competition for the title among the top teams, a significant takeover by a new owner at Newcastle United, and a series of COVID-19 outbreaks that forced postponements throughout the season. The season also saw the implementation of new sanctions on Chelsea's owner, Roman Abramovich, and a thrilling finish to the season with multiple teams competing for the title, Champions League spots, and relegation.\n\n### The race for first place\n\nThe season began with Manchester City and Liverpool as the early favorites to win the title, having finished first and second in the previous season. However, Chelsea, led by Thomas Tuchel, had a strong start to the season and were briefly top of the table in September. Manchester City eventually regained their lead and held it for most of the season, but Liverpool and Chelsea remained close challengers.\n\n### Newcastle takeover\n\nIn October 2021, a Saudi Arabian-led consortium completed a takeover of Newcastle United, ending a 14-year period of ownership by the Ashley family. The takeover was the subject of controversy, with concerns raised about the human rights record of the Saudi Arabian government and the potential for the club to be influenced by the government.\n\n### COVID-19 outbreaks force postponements\n\nThroughout the season, COVID-19 outbreaks among players and staff forced the postponement of multiple matches. The outbreaks were particularly severe in January 2022, when several teams were forced to postpone matches due to high numbers of positive cases.\n\n### Abramovich sanctions\n\nIn February 2022, Roman Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea, was sanctioned by the UK government due to his alleged ties to the Russian government. The sanctions included the freezing of Chelsea's assets and the prohibition of Abramovich from attending matches.\n\n### Final day climax\n\nThe final day of the season saw multiple teams competing for the title, Champions League spots, and relegation. Manchester City eventually won the title with a 3-2 victory over Aston Villa, while Liverpool finished second and Chelsea finished third. The final day also saw Brentford secure their first-ever Premier League season, while Newcastle United and Norwich City were relegated.\n\n#### Title\n\nManchester City won their fourth Premier League title in five seasons, having previously won the title in 2018, 2019, and 2021.\n\n#### Relegation\n\nNewcastle United and Norwich City were relegated to the Championship at the end of the season, while Watford also finished in the relegation zone but survived due to a better goal difference.\n\n#### Champions League, Europa League and Conference League spots\n\nThe top four teams in the Premier League qualified for the Champions League, while the fifth-placed team qualified for the Europa League. The sixth-placed team qualified for the Europa Conference League.\n\n## Other teams\n\nThe 2021–22 Premier League season saw some notable performances from teams outside the top six. Leicester City finished fifth and qualified for the Europa League, while West Ham United finished seventh and qualified for the Europa Conference League. Brentford secured their first-ever Premier League season, finishing ninth, while Everton finished 10th.\n\n**Teams**\n\nThe 2021–22 Premier League season featured 20 teams, including the top four teams from the previous season and the four teams that were promoted from the Championship.\n\n### Stadiums and locations\n\nThe 2021–22 Premier League season saw the return of fans to stadiums, following a period of lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The season also saw the introduction of new stadium measures, including social distancing and mask-wearing.\n\n### Personnel and kits\n\nThe 2021–22 Premier League season saw some notable changes in personnel and kits. Manchester City introduced a new kit with a diamond-shaped logo, while Liverpool introduced a new kit with a classic design. Chelsea also introduced a new kit with a bold design.\n\n### Managerial changes\n\nThe 2021–22 Premier League season saw some notable managerial changes, including the appointment of Thomas Tuchel at Chelsea and the departure of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at Manchester United.\n\n**League table**\n\nThe final league table for the 2021–22 Premier League season was as follows:\n\n| Pos | Team | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts |\n| 1 | Manchester City | 38 | 28 | 5 | 5 | 93 | 33 | +60 | 89 |\n| 2 | Liverpool | 38 | 28 | 6 | 4 | 94 | 26 | +68 | 84 |\n| 3 | Chelsea | 38 | 21 | 9 | 8 | 68 | 39 | +29 | 66 |\n| 4 | Tottenham Hotspur | 38 | 22 | 5 | 11 | 69 | 38 | +31 | 65 |\n| 5 | Leicester City | 38 | 20 | 9 | 9 | 62 | 43 | +19 | 59 |\n| 6 | West Ham United | 38 | 19 | 8 | 11 | 62 | 47 | +15 | 55 |\n| 7 | Arsenal | 38 | 18 | 7 | 13 | 55 | 39 | +16 | 53 |\n| 8 | Aston Villa | 38 | 18 | 6 | 14 | 55 | 51 | +4 | 52 |\n| 9 | Everton | 38 | 15 | 10 | 13 | 45 | 46 | -1 | 45 |\n| 10 | Leeds United | 38 | 14 | 9 | 15 | 54 | 53 | +1 | 41 |\n| 11 | Wolverhampton Wanderers | 38 | 13 | 8 | 17 | 38 | 43 | -5 | 40 |\n| 12 | Newcastle United | 38 | 10 | 14 | 14 | 38 | 49 | -11 | 34 |\n| 13 | Crystal Palace | 38 | 9 | 10 | 19 | 34 | 52 | -18 | 32 |\n| 14 | Southampton | 38 | 9 | 7 | 22 | 43 | 62 | -19 | 29 |\n| 15 | Brighton & Hove Albion | 38 | 8 | 10 | 20 | 36 | 65 | -29 | 28 |\n| 16 | Brentford | 38 | 7 | 13 | 18 | 31 | 56 | -25 | 25 |\n| 17 | Norwich City | 38 | 5 | 11 | 22 | 23 | 69 | -46 | 20 |\n| 18 | Watford | 38 | 6 | 8 | 24 | 34 | 75 | -41 | 20 |\n| 19 | Burnley | 38 | 5 | 11 | 22 | 26 | 69 | -43 | 16 |\n| 20 | Manchester United | 38 | 12 | 18 | 8 | 52 | 49 | +3 | 14 |\n\n**Results**\n\nThe 2021–22 Premier League season saw a total of 380 matches played, with 20 teams competing in a double round-robin format.\n\n**Season statistics**\n\nThe 2021–22 Premier League season saw some notable statistics, including:\n\n* Most goals scored: Mohamed Salah (23 goals)\n* Most assists: Kevin De Bruyne (20 assists)\n* Most clean sheets: Ederson (19 clean sheets)\n* Most yellow cards: Christian Eriksen (11 yellow cards)\n* Most red cards: Craig Dawson (2 red cards)\n\n**Top scorers**\n\nThe top scorers in the 2021–22 Premier League season were:\n\n1.

Born on June 19, 1947, in Bombay, India, Rushdie has been a significant figure in contemporary literature, publishing over a dozen novels, numerous essays, and children's books.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nRushdie was born to Anis Ahmadi and Negin Bokhari, both of whom were from prominent Muslim families in India. His maternal grandfather, Zainul Abedin Ahmad, was a well-known Islamic scholar and a former member of the Majlis-e-Ahrar-e-Islam, a radical Islamic organization. Rushdie's early life was marked by a mix of cultural and intellectual influences, with his parents exposing him to both traditional Islamic values and Western literature.\n\nRushdie attended Cathedral and John Connon School in Bombay before moving to the UK in 1961 to study history at King's College, Cambridge. However, he soon switched to English literature and graduated in 1968. He then went on to complete a Master's degree in History from the University of Sussex.\n\n**Career**\n\nRushdie's writing career spans multiple genres, including fiction, nonfiction, and children's literature.\n\n### **Copywriter**\n\nBefore becoming a writer, Rushdie worked as a copywriter for an advertising agency in London. This experience would later influence his writing style, which often incorporates elements of advertising and propaganda.\n\n### **Literary Works**\n\nRushdie's literary career began in the 1970s with his first novel, _Grimus_ (1975), a science fiction novel that explores themes of identity and social hierarchy. This was followed by _Midnight's Children_ (1981), a novel that won the Booker Prize in 1981 and catapulted Rushdie to international fame.\n\n#### **Early Works and Literary Breakthrough, 1975–1987**\n\n* _Grimus_ (1975) - a science fiction novel exploring themes of identity and social hierarchy\n* _Midnight's Children_ (1981) - a novel that won the Booker Prize in 1981 and explores the Indian independence movement\n* _Shame_ (1983) - a novel that explores the politics of Pakistan and the legacy of colonialism\n* _The Jaguar Smile: A Nicaraguan Journey_ (1987) - a nonfiction book that explores the politics of Nicaragua\n\n#### **The Satanic Verses and Haroun and the Sea of Stories, 1988–1990**\n\n* _The Satanic Verses_ (1988) - a novel that explores themes of identity, faith, and culture, and sparked controversy due to its depiction of the Prophet Muhammad\n* _Haroun and the Sea of Stories_ (1990) - a children's novel that explores the power of storytelling and the importance of imagination\n\n#### **Further Works, 1990s–2000s**\n\n* _The Moor's Last Sigh_ (1995) - a novel that explores the history of India and the complexities of identity\n* _The Ground Beneath Her Feet_ (1999) - a novel that explores the intersection of politics and culture in contemporary India\n* _Fury_ (2001) - a novel that explores the complexities of human relationships and the power of storytelling\n\n#### **Later Works, Novels, and Essays, 2015–2024**\n\n* _Two Years Eight Months and Twenty-Eight Nights_ (2015) - a novel that explores the intersection of history and mythology\n* _The Golden House_ (2017) - a novel that explores the complexities of identity and belonging\n* _The Quill_ (2020) - a collection of essays that explore the power of language and the importance of storytelling\n\n### **Critical Reception**\n\nRushdie's work has been widely praised for its complexity, nuance, and innovative style.

2022 United States House of Representatives elections in New York were held on November 8, 2022, to elect the 27 members of the state's delegation to the 118th United States Congress. The elections coincided with other elections to the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\n**2020-22 redistricting controversy**\n\nThe redistricting process in New York was marked by controversy and litigation.

The state's delegation was previously composed of 19 Democrats and 8 Republicans.

During his premiership, Putin continued to play a dominant role in Russian politics, shaping the country's domestic and foreign policies.\n\n2012–2018: Third presidential term\n\nPutin returned to the presidency in 2012, winning the election with 63.6% of the vote.

He also strengthened Russia's military and improved its relations with other countries, including China and the United States.\n\nAnnexation of Crimea\n\nIn 2014, Putin annexed Crimea, a peninsula in Ukraine, citing the need to protect the Russian-speaking population. The annexation was widely condemned by the international community, but Putin's popularity in Russia soared.\n\nIntervention in Syria\n\nIn 2015, Putin intervened in the Syrian civil war, supporting the government of Bashar al-Assad against the rebels. Putin's intervention was widely seen as a key factor in the government's victory.\n\nRussia's interference in the 2016 US election\n\nIn 2016, the US intelligence community concluded that Russia had interfered in the US presidential election, with Putin's government accused of hacking into Democratic Party emails and spreading propaganda on social media.\n\n2018–2024: Fourth presidential term\n\nPutin won the presidential election in 2018 with 76.7% of the vote.

She was the wife of Anthony Eden, the 1st Earl of Avon, who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1955 to 1957.\n\n**Early life**\n\n### Paris, Tuscany and London (1937–1939)\n\nClarissa Spencer-Churchill was born on July 13, 1920, in London, England. She was the daughter of the 9th Duke of Marlborough, John Spencer-Churchill, and his second wife, Gwendoline \"Gwinnie\" Theresa Chesterton. Her early life was marked by frequent family moves, including stints in Paris and Tuscany. When the Second World War broke out, the family relocated to London, where Clarissa spent her adolescence.\n\n### Second World War: Oxford and the Foreign Office\n\nAs the war intensified, Clarissa became involved in the work of the Foreign Office, using her language skills to assist with the translation of documents. She also spent time at Balliol College, Oxford, where she studied German and Italian. Her experiences during this period would later shape her perspectives on international politics.\n\n### Post-war\n\nFollowing the war, Clarissa returned to London and became involved in social events, including the London Season. Her connections to the aristocracy and her own family's history of public service made her a sought-after figure in high society.\n\n**2007 memoir**\n\nIn 2007, Clarissa Eden published her memoir, _Speak for England_, which offered a candid account of her life, including her relationship with Anthony Eden and her experiences as the Prime Minister's wife. The book received critical acclaim for its insightful portrayal of British politics and society during the mid-20th century.\n\n**Friends and acquaintances**\n\n### Early admirers\n\nClarissa's charm and wit quickly made her popular among high society circles. Her early admirers included notable figures such as Winston Churchill and his son Randolph. These connections would prove valuable in her later life, particularly during her marriage to Anthony Eden.\n\n### Other friends\n\nThroughout her life, Clarissa maintained friendships with a wide range of individuals, including politicians, artists, and intellectuals. Her social circle included figures such as Harold Macmillan and his wife, Dorothy, as well as the writer and philosopher, A.J. Ayer.\n\n**Relationship with Anthony Eden**\n\n### Winston Churchill and the wartime link\n\nClarissa and Anthony Eden first met in the 1930s, during the Second World War. Their connection was strengthened by their shared experience of working at the Foreign Office, where Anthony was serving as Minister of State. Winston Churchill, who was then Prime Minister, recognized the potential of the relationship and encouraged the couple to court.\n\n### Marriage to Eden\n\nClarissa and Anthony Eden married in 1952, in a private ceremony at St. Margaret's Church, Westminster. The union was seen as a strategic move by some, given Anthony's rise in politics and the connections Clarissa brought to the table. However, the couple's relationship was genuinely affectionate, and they shared a deep commitment to each other.\n\n### Attitudes to the marriage\n\nSome within the Eden family and government circles viewed Clarissa's marriage to Anthony as a convenience, given her aristocratic connections and social standing. However, Anthony himself was deeply in love with Clarissa, and their marriage brought him a sense of stability and happiness.\n\n### Married life\n\nAs the Prime Minister's wife, Clarissa became the chatelaine of Downing Street and Chequers, the government's country retreat. She used her position to promote British culture and arts, hosting numerous events and receptions. Her influence extended beyond the confines of politics, with Clarissa often providing a calming presence during difficult times.\n\n**Eden's premiership**\n\n### Chatelaine at Downing Street and Chequers\n\nAs the wife of Prime Minister Anthony Eden, Clarissa became an important figure in British politics. She used her social standing and charm to promote the government's agenda, hosting numerous events and receptions. Her presence at Chequers, the government's country retreat, helped to foster a sense of camaraderie among government officials and dignitaries.\n\n### Suez Crisis\n\nThe Suez Crisis of 1956 proved a particularly challenging time for the Edens. As Anthony became increasingly embroiled in the conflict, Clarissa remained a steady presence, providing emotional support and counsel. Her own views on the crisis were complex, reflecting her concern for the British people and her commitment to her husband's leadership.\n\n#### \"The Suez Canal flowing through my drawing room\"\n\nClarissa later recalled the Suez Crisis as a tumultuous period in her life, marked by the constant presence of diplomats and politicians at Chequers. She humorously described the scene, saying that the Suez Canal seemed to be flowing through her drawing room.\n\n**Political influence**\n\nThroughout her time as the Prime Minister's wife, Clarissa exercised significant influence over British politics. Her social standing and connections allowed her to shape public opinion and promote government initiatives. Her relationship with Anthony was built on mutual respect and trust, with Clarissa playing an important role in supporting his decisions.\n\n**Protective influence**\n\nClarissa's presence also provided a protective influence during times of crisis. Her calm and measured approach helped to soothe tensions and provide a sense of stability. Her relationship with Anthony was built on a deep understanding of each other's strengths and weaknesses, with Clarissa often serving as a voice of reason during difficult times.\n\n**Aftermath of Suez**\n\nThe aftermath of the Suez Crisis proved a challenging time for the Edens. Anthony's decision to withdraw British forces from the region was widely criticized, and the Prime Minister's popularity suffered as a result. Clarissa played an important role in supporting her husband during this period, using her charm and social standing to promote his agenda.\n\n#### Goldeneye\n\nFollowing the Suez Crisis, the Edens retreated to their country home, Goldeneye, in Jamaica. The property had been a gift from Ian Fleming, the author of the James Bond series, who had been a close friend of the Edens. During their time at Goldeneye, the couple enjoyed a period of relative peace, away from the pressures of politics.\n\n#### Eden's resignation\n\nAnthony Eden's resignation in 1957 marked the end of an era for the Edens. Clarissa remained a devoted wife and supporter, but the couple's relationship was never the same after the Suez Crisis. Anthony's decision to step down as Prime Minister was a difficult one, but it ultimately allowed him to regain his health and pursue other interests.\n\n**Eden's retirement and death**\n\nFollowing his resignation, Anthony Eden retired from politics and devoted himself to his writing and art. He passed away in 1977, at the age of 79. Clarissa remained a devoted widow, continuing to support her family and promote British culture.\n\n**Widowhood**\n\nClarissa Eden's widowhood was marked by a sense of purpose and dedication. She continued to promote British culture and arts, using her social standing and connections to support emerging artists and writers. Her own writing career flourished, with Clarissa publishing several books on art and history.\n\n### Longevity\n\nClarissa Eden's longevity was a testament to her strong constitution and enduring spirit. She lived to the age of 101, passing away in 2021. Throughout her life, she remained a devoted wife, mother, and grandmother, leaving behind a legacy of love and service.\n\n**In popular culture**\n\nClarissa Eden's life and times have been the subject of numerous books, films, and documentaries. Her relationship with Anthony Eden has been portrayed in various works of fiction, including the film \"Never So Few\" and the play \"The Suez Crisis\". Her own memoir, \"Speak for England\", offers a candid and insightful account of her life, including her experiences as the Prime Minister's wife.\n\n**Arms**\n\nClarissa Eden's coat of arms features a shield with three lions, representing the Spencer-Churchill family. The crest above the shield features a lion's head, while the motto reads \"Fidelis\".\n\n**References**\n\n### Notes\n\n* The Edens' relationship was marked by a deep commitment to each other, with Clarissa serving as a devoted wife and supporter throughout Anthony's career.\n\n### Citations\n\n* Clarissa Eden's memoir, \"Speak for England\", offers a candid and insightful account of her life, including her experiences as the Prime Minister's wife.\n\n### Bibliography\n\n* Eden, Clarissa (2007).
