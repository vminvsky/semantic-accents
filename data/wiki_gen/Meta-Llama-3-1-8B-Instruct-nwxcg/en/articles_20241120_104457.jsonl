{"title": "Theresa_May", "content": "\nEarly life and education\nTheresa May was born on 1 October 1956 in Eastbourne, Sussex She is the only child of Zaidee Mary (née Barnes; 1928–1982) and Hubert Brasier (1917–1981) [3] Her father was a Church of England clergyman (and an Anglo-Catholic) [4] who was chaplain of an Eastbourne hospital [5] He later became vicar of Enstone with Heythrop and finally of St Mary's at Wheatley, to the east of Oxford [6] [7] [8] May's mother was a supporter of the Conservative Party [9] Her father died in 1981, from injuries sustained in a car accident, and her mother of multiple sclerosis the following year [10] [11] May later stated she was \"sorry they  [her parents] never saw me elected as a Member of Parliament\" [12]\n\n\nEarly career\nBetween 1977 and 1983, May worked at the Bank of England From 1985 to 1997, she was a financial consultant at the Association for Payment Clearing Services (APACS) [24] She served as Head of the European Affairs Unit from 1989 to 1996 and Senior Adviser on International Affairs from 1996 to 1997 in the organisation [25]\n\n\nElection\nAround 18 months ahead of the 1997 general election, May was selected as the Conservative candidate for Maidenhead, a new seat which was created from parts of the safe seats of Windsor and Maidenhead and Wokingham [25] She was elected comfortably with 25,344 votes (49.8%), almost double the total of second-placed Andrew Terence Ketteringham of the Liberal Democrats, who took 13,363 votes (26.3%) [29] [28] Despite this, her party suffered their worst defeat in over 150 years.\n\n\nEarly parliamentary career\nHaving entered Parliament, May became a member of William Hague's front-bench Opposition team, as Shadow Spokesman for Schools, Disabled People and Women (1998–1999) She became the first of the 1997 MPs to enter the Shadow Cabinet when in 1999 she was appointed Shadow Education and Employment Secretary After the 2001 election the new Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith kept her in the Shadow Cabinet, moving her to the Transport portfolio.\n\n\nHome Secretary\nFollowing the formation of the coalition government after the 2010 general election on 12 May 2010, May was appointed Home Secretary and Minister for Women and Equalities by Prime Minister David Cameron as part of his first Cabinet She became the fourth woman to hold one of the British Great Offices of State, after Margaret Thatcher (Prime Minister), Margaret Beckett (Foreign Secretary) and Jacqui Smith (Home Secretary) [35] As Home Secretary, May was also a member of the National Security Council [36] She was the longest-serving Home Secretary for over 60 years, since James Chuter Ede who served over six years and two months from August 1945 to October 1951 May's appointment as Home Secretary was somewhat unexpected, with Chris Grayling having served as shadow Home Secretary in opposition [37] [38]\n\n\nPolice and crime\nSpeaking at the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) conference in June 2010, May announced radical cuts to the Home Office budget, likely to lead to a reduction in police numbers [61] In July 2010, May presented the House of Commons with proposals for a fundamental review of the previous Labour government's security and counter-terrorism legislation, including \"stop and search\" powers, and her intention to review the 28-day limit on detaining terrorist suspects without charge [62] [63]\n\n\nAnti-social behaviour\nIn July 2010, May proposed to review the previous Labour Government's anti-social behaviour legislation signalling the abolition of the \"Anti-Social Behaviour Order\" (ASBO) She identified the policy's high level of failure with almost half of ASBOs breached between 2000 and 2008, leading to \"fast-track\" criminal convictions May proposed a less punitive, community-based approach to tackling social disorder May suggested that anti-social behaviour policy \"must be turned on its head\", reversing the ASBO's role as the flagship crime control policy legislation under Labour [77] [78] Former Labour Home Secretaries David Blunkett (who introduced ASBOs) and Alan Johnson expressed their disapproval of the proposals [79]\n\n\nDrug policy\nIn July 2013, May decided to ban the stimulant khat, against the advice of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) The council reached the conclusion that there was \"insufficient evidence\" it caused health problems [80] Explaining the change in the classification May said: \"The decision to bring khat under control is finely balanced and takes into account the expert scientific advice and these broader concerns\", and pointed out that the product had already been banned in the majority of other EU member states, as well as most of the G8 countries including Canada and the US [81] A report on khat use by the ACMD published in January 2013 had noted the product had been associated with \"acute psychotic episodes\", \"chronic liver disease\" and family breakdown However, it concluded that there is no risk of harm for most users, and recommended that khat remain uncontrolled due to lack of evidence for these associations [82]\n\n\nImmigration\nIn 2010, May promised to bring the level of net migration down to less than 100,000 [89] The Independent reported in February 2015, \"The Office for National Statistics (ONS) announced a net flow of 298,000 migrants to the UK in the 12 months to September 2014—up from 210,000 in the previous year.\" [90] In total, 624,000 people migrated to the UK in the year ending September 2014 and 327,000 left in the same period Statistics showed \"significant increases in migration among both non-EU citizens—up 49,000 to 292,000—and EU citizens, which rose by 43,000 to 251,000.\" [90]\n\n\nFamily migration\nIn June 2012, May announced that new restrictions would be introduced to reduce the number of non-European Economic Area family migrants The changes were mostly intended to apply to new applicants after 9 July 2012 [95]\n\n\nDeportation decisions\nAt the Conservative Party Conference in October 2011, while arguing that the Human Rights Act needed to be amended, May gave the example of a foreign national who the Courts ruled was allowed to remain in the UK, \"because—and I am not making this up—he had a pet cat\" In response, the Royal Courts of Justice issued a statement, denying that this was the reason for the tribunal's decision in that case, and stating that the real reason was that he was in a genuine relationship with a British partner, and owning a pet cat was simply one of many pieces of evidence given to show that the relationship was \"genuine\" The Home Office had failed to apply its own rules for dealing with unmarried partners of people settled in the UK [100] Amnesty International said May's comments only fuelled \"myths and misconceptions\" about the Human Rights Act and Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke subsequently called May's comments \"laughable and childlike.\" [101] [102]\n\n\nAbu Qatada deportation\nIn July 2013, Abu Qatada, a radical cleric arrested in 2002, was deported to Jordan after a decade-long battle that had cost the nation £1.7 million in legal fees, [110] and several prior Home Secretaries had not resolved [111] The deportation was the result of a treaty negotiated by May in April 2013, under which Jordan agreed to give Qatada a fair trial, by not using evidence that may have been obtained against him through torture [112]\n\n\n\"Go Home\" advertisements\nIn August 2013, the Home Office engaged in an advertising campaign directed at illegal immigrants [115] The advertisements, in the form of mobile advertising hoardings on the back of lorries, told illegal immigrants to \"go home or face arrest\", with an image of a person in handcuffs, and were deployed in six London boroughs with substantial ethnic minority populations They were widely criticised as creating a hostile atmosphere for members of ethnic minority groups [116] The shadow Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, described their language as being reminiscent of that used by the National Front in the 1970s [117] An adjudication by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said that \"the claim  [that 106 arrests were made last week] was misleading and had not been substantiated\" was followed by the advertisements being withdrawn after being banned by the ASA [118]\n\n\nPassport backlog\nIn mid 2014, the Passport Office faced a backlog in developing processing passport applications, with around 30,000 applications hit by delays [119] David Cameron suggested this had come about due to the Passport Office's receiving an \"above normal\" 300,000-rise in applications [120] It was revealed, however, that May had been warned the year before, in July 2013, that a surge of 350,000 extra applications could occur owing to the closure of processing overseas under Chancellor Osborne's programme of cuts [121] Around £674,000 was paid to staff who helped clear the backlog [122]\n\n\nWindrush scandal\nIn April 2018, May's hostile environment policy became the focus of British politics in what came to be known as the Windrush scandal, in which members of the Windrush generation of Afro-Caribbean Britons were threatened with deportation by the Home Office and in at least 83 cases, illegally deported from the UK [123]  The policy also affected the lives of many thousands of people who were in the United Kingdom legally by causing them to be sacked from employment, [124] preventing access to health care, illegally demanding money, [125] exiling them and preventing their return to the UK, [126] and leaving them destitute The scandal led to the resignation of May's successor Amber Rudd as Home Secretary, [127]  and her replacement by Sajid Javid [128] Responding to questions in Parliament on the Windrush scandal on 25 April, May maintained that the hostile environment policy would remain government policy [129]\n\n\nBirmingham schools row\nIn June 2014, an inflamed public argument arose between Home Office and Education Ministers about responsibility for alleged extremism in Birmingham schools [130] [131] Prime Minister David Cameron intervened to resolve the row, insisting that May sack her Special Advisor Fiona Cunningham (now Hill) for releasing on May's website a confidential letter to May's colleagues, [132] and that Michael Gove, the Education Secretary, apologise to the Home Office's head of Security and Counter-Terrorism, Charles Farr, for uncomplimentary briefings of him appearing on the front page of The Times [133] [134]\n\n\nMinister for Women and Equalities\nMay held the office of Minister for Women and Equalities in parallel to her office of Home Secretary from 2010 to September 2012, when this role was taken over by Maria Miller [135]\n\n\nLeadership bid\nIn June 2016, May announced her candidacy for the leadership of the Conservative Party to succeed David Cameron, who resigned following the outcome of the European Union membership referendum in which 52 per cent of voters voted in favour of leaving the EU May emphasised the need for unity within the party regardless of positions on leaving the EU, saying she could bring \"strong leadership\" and a \"positive vision\" for the country's future Despite having backed a vote to remain in the EU, she insisted that there would be no second referendum, saying: \"The campaign was fought.. and the public gave their verdict There must be no attempts to remain inside the EU, no attempts to rejoin it through the back door.. Brexit means Brexit\" An opinion poll that day found 47 per cent of people choosing May as their preferred candidate to be prime minister [150]\n\n\nPremiership (2016–2019)\nOn 13 July 2016, two days after becoming Leader of the Conservative Party, May was appointed prime minister by Queen Elizabeth II, becoming the second female British prime minister after Margaret Thatcher [159] [160] Addressing the world's media outside 10 Downing Street, May said that she was \"honoured and humbled\" to become prime minister On becoming prime minister, May became the first woman to have held two of the Great Offices of State.\n\n\nAppointment\nOn 13 July 2016, two days after becoming Leader of the Conservative Party, May was appointed prime minister by Queen Elizabeth II, becoming the second female British prime minister after Margaret Thatcher [159] [160] Addressing the world's media outside 10 Downing Street, May said that she was \"honoured and humbled\" to become prime minister On becoming prime minister, May became the first woman to have held two of the Great Offices of State.\n\n\nCabinet changes\nMay's first Cabinet appointment was described by Reuters as \"one of the most sweeping government reshuffles for decades\", and called \"a brutal cull\" by The Daily Telegraph [164] [165] Nine of Cameron's ministers, including several prominent members, were sacked or resigned from their posts [165] The early appointments were interpreted both as an effort to reunite the Conservative Party in the wake of the UK's vote to leave the EU and as \"a shift to the right,\" according to The Guardian [166] ITV's Political Editor Robert Peston commented: \"Her rhetoric is more left-wing than Cameron's was, her cabinet is more right-wing than his was.\" [167] Although May had supported remaining in the EU, she appointed several of the most prominent advocates of Brexit to key Cabinet positions responsible for negotiating the United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union, including Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary, David Davis as Brexit Secretary, and Liam Fox as International Trade Secretary, the latter two being new positions [163] [168] Other key appointees included Amber Rudd as Home Secretary and Philip Hammond as Chancellor of the Exchequer [169]\n\n\nFirst term (2016–2017)\nThe First May ministry delayed the final approval for the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in July 2016, a project which May had objected to when she was Home Secretary [170] [171] Her political adviser Nick Timothy wrote an article in 2015 to oppose China's involvement in sensitive sectors He said that the government was \"selling our national security to China\" without rational concerns and \"the Government seems intent on ignoring the evidence and presumably the advice of the security and intelligence agencies\" [172]\n\n\n2017 general election\nIn May announced that she would call a parliamentary vote to hold an early general election on 8 June, saying that it was the \"only way to guarantee certainty and security for years ahead\" [188] May had previously ruled out an early election on five occasions over nine months [189] The election was the first snap election held under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 after MPs gave May the two-thirds super-majority required [190]\n\n\nSecond term (2017–2019)\nLess than two weeks after the 2017 State Opening of Parliament, May ordered a full public inquiry into the contaminated blood scandal [201] For this she was widely praised as successive governments going back to the 1980s had refused such an inquiry, some though speculated that May had simply been forced to announce the inquiry after a group legal action and news of fresh evidence were brought by Jason Evans [202] [203] Additionally, Andy Burnham had threatened to take evidence to the police if an inquiry were not announced [204] With over 1,000 core participants, the Infected Blood Inquiry is the biggest public inquiry ever held in the UK [205]\n\n\nMyanmar\nMay is the first British prime minister to visit Buenos Aires after the Falklands War [206] In November 2017, May said the actions of Myanmar Army and police against the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar \"looks like ethnic cleansing\" [207] According to May, \"it is something for which the Burmese authorities – and especially the military – must take full responsibility.\" [207] From the 2017 general election to December 2017, May suffered no defeats in whipped votes in the House of Commons [208] On 13 December 2017, May lost a vote on the EU Withdrawal Bill by 309 votes to 305, due to 11 Conservatives voting against the government, including Stephen Hammond who was then vice-chairman of the Conservative Party [209] [210]\n\n\nRussia\nMay accused Russia of \"threatening the international order\", \"seeking to weaponise information\" and \"deploying its state-run media organisations to plant fake stories\" [211] She further suggested the country had been meddling in the 2017 German federal election [211] in contradiction of German government officials and security experts, who had dismissed the possibility [212]\n\n\nChina\nMay promised to confront China on human rights but was praised in Communist Party-controlled media for \"sidestepping\" human rights in China during her first official visit to the country [214] The Global Times said: \"For the Prime Minister, the losses outweigh the gains if she appeases the British media at the cost of the visit's friendly atmosphere.\" [214]\n\n\nAssassination plot\nIn 2017, Islamic State terrorist Naa'imur Zakariyah Rahman was foiled in a plot to assassinate May at Downing Street [215]\n\n\nTurkey\nIn May 2018, during a three-day state visit to the UK by Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, May declared that Britain is a \"true friend\" of Turkey, but she added that \"It is important that in defence of democracy, which has been facing extraordinary pressures from the failed coup, instability across the border from Syria and from Kurdish terrorism, Turkey does not lose sight of the values it is seeking to defend.\" [216] [217] [218]\n\n\nContempt of Parliament\nOn 4 December 2018, on a motion passed by MPs by 311 to 293 votes, [219] the May Government was found in contempt of Parliament; the first government to be found in contempt in history [220] The vote was triggered by the government failing to lay before Parliament any legal advice on the proposed withdrawal agreement on the terms of the UK's departure from the European Union, after a humble address for a return was unanimously agreed to by the House of Commons on 13 November 2018 The government then agreed to publish the full legal advice [220] for Brexit that was given to the Prime Minister by the Attorney General during negotiations with the European Union.\n\n\nVote of confidence (Conservative Party)\nIn December 2018, May faced a vote of confidence in her leadership of the Conservative Party over opposition to her negotiated Brexit deal, after the number of Conservative MPs exceeded the 48 no-confidence letter threshold that the 1922 Committee Chairman, Sir Graham Brady required for the vote of confidence to be held [221] May won the vote with 200 Conservative MPs voting for her, compared to 117 voting against [222] As part of her speech to the Parliamentary Conservative Party before the confidence vote was opened, it was reported that May conceded that she would step down as prime minister after delivering Brexit and would not lead the Conservative Party into the next General Election in exchange for Conservative MPs voting to have confidence in her leadership so that she would be able to keep the party, Parliament and the UK stable during the final stages of Brexit May later confirmed this to BBC News Political editor, Laura Kuenssberg after meeting EU leaders, including Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels [223]\n\n\nVote of no confidence (House of Commons)\nOn 17 December 2018 in the House of Commons, the Leader of the Opposition and Labour Party Leader, Jeremy Corbyn, tabled a motion of no confidence in May's premiership, citing May's refusal to set the date for the meaningful vote on her Brexit deal before Christmas, and instead pushing it back to mid-January [224] The following day the government refused to allow time for the motion to be debated John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons, confirmed that they were under no obligation to do so [225] Following the defeat of May's Brexit deal on 15 January 2019, Corbyn tabled a motion of no confidence in the Government, to be voted on by parliament the following evening [226] [227] [228] The motion was defeated by 325 votes to 306; a majority of 19.\n\n\nBrexit deal defeats\nIn January 2019, May's government was defeated in the House of Commons by a margin of 230 votes (202 in favour and 432 opposed) in a vote on her deal to leave the European Union (\"first meaningful vote\") It was the largest majority against a United Kingdom government in history [229]\n\n\nResignation\nI will shortly leave the job that it has been the honour of my life to hold – the second female Prime Minister but certainly not the last I do so with no ill-will, but with enormous and enduring gratitude to have had the opportunity to serve the country I love.\n\nMinisterial resignations\nMay's premiership had 51 resignations with 33 relating to Brexit These included 12 departures from the Cabinet The pace and number of resignations have been described as 'unprecedented' by the Institute for Government, [241] with resignations impacting the functioning of the government [242] In less than three years, May received more resignations than Thatcher (11 years) or Blair (10 years) The Chief Whip Julian Smith described May's Cabinet as exhibiting the 'worst cabinet ill-discipline in history' [243]\n\n\nPublic opinion\nMay had a high approval rating during her first week as prime minister The results of an Ipsos MORI survey released in July 2016 indicated that 55% of those surveyed believed that May was a suitable PM while only 23% believed that the Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn would make a good prime minister [244]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nMay has identified herself with the one-nation conservative position within her party [256]\n\n\nForeign policy\nIn 2003, May voted to approve the invasion of Iraq and in 2013 voted in favour of British military intervention in the Syrian civil war [275]\n\n\nEconomic policy\nPrior to her premiership, May outlined plans to backtrack on the longstanding government plan to achieve a surplus by 2020, following the UK's withdrawal from the European Union With uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook, Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond has suggested that the government's Autumn Statement may be used to \"reset\" economic policy [283]\n\n\nWorkers' representatives\nBefore her premiership began, May said that she planned to have workers represented on company boards, saying \"If I'm prime minister .. we're going to have not just consumers represented on company boards, but workers as well.\" [290] May aimed to put workers' and consumers' representatives on boards to make them more accountable [291] Nils Pratley, a journalist at The Guardian, wrote in July \"Fundamental principles of Britain's boardroom governance are being rethought It is a very welcome development In the more enlightened quarters of the UK corporate world, they can see that boardroom pay has eroded trust in business.\" [290] Workers' representatives, it appeared, would have made UK companies more like those in Germany and France [292] May was accused of backtracking in November 2016 when she said that firms would not be forced to adopt the proposal, saying \"there are a number of ways in which that can be achieved\" [293]\n\n\nEnvironmental policy\nFollowing the impact of Blue Planet II in 2017, the May administration outlined plans to approve further green policy A particular focus has been on plastic and its impact on the environment Her government's \"25 Year Environment Plan\" was published in January 2018: [294] targets were set for achievement of a number of environmental benefits with dates ranging from 2025 to 2060 [295] In March 2018, May announced plans for a plastic deposit scheme modelled on a similar policy in Norway to boost recycling [296]\n\n\nEU and Brexit\nMay publicly stated her support for the UK remaining in the EU during the 2016 referendum campaign, but did not campaign extensively in the referendum and criticised aspects of the EU in a speech [297] [298] It was speculated by political journalists that May had sought to minimise her involvement in the debate to strengthen her position as a future candidate for the Conservative party leadership [299] Some in David Cameron's ministry likened May to a \"submarine\" on the issue of Brexit due to her perceived indifference towards the referendum and the EU [300]\n\n\nFeminism\nIn 2005, May co-founded the mentoring and pressure group Women2Win This group and May's personal efforts have been credited with increasing the number of Conservative women MPs and with supporting them In government she lobbied for improvements to maternity leave, and as Home Secretary she acted on FGM and introduced a law on coercive control However, she has been criticised for the financial cuts made by her government, which have been claimed to have had the greatest impact on poor and vulnerable women [322] [323] [324]\n\n\nSame-sex relationships\nIn 1998, May voted against lowering the age of consent for homosexual acts [325] May was also a supporter of Section 28, calling a failed repeal in 2000 to be \"a victory for commonsense\" [326] She was absent for the vote when it was successfully repealed in 2003 [327] She also voted against the Adoption and Children Act 2002 that allowed same-sex couples to adopt [328]\n\n\nPost-premiership (2019–present)\nAfter leaving 10 Downing Street, May took her place on the backbenches, remaining an MP to \"devote her full time\" to her constituency of Maidenhead, Berkshire [332] In the 2019 general election she was re-elected as the constituency's MP [333]\n\n\nPeerage\nAfter standing down as an MP, May was nominated for a life peerage in the 2024 Dissolution Honours [354] [355] [356] [357] She was created Baroness May of Maidenhead, of Sonning in the Royal County of Berkshire, on 21 August 2024 [358] She was introduced to the House of Lords on 12 September 2024 [359]\n\n\nPersonal life\nMay has been married to Sir Philip May, an investment relationship manager, [360] since 6 September 1980 [361] It has been reported that former prime minister of Pakistan Benazir Bhutto introduced the two during their time at Oxford [362] May credits future Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull for encouraging Philip to propose to her [363] May has expressed regret that she and her husband did not have children [364] The Mays are passionate walkers, and they regularly spend their holidays hiking in the Swiss Alps [365] May is also a cricket fan, stating that Sir Geoffrey Boycott was one of her sporting heroes [366] She also enjoys cooking, and has said that she owns 100 cookery books Philip has said that she \"is a very good cook\" [22] [367]\n\n\nHonours and arms\nPrior to and since her appointment to Government, May has actively supported a variety of campaigns on policy issues in her constituency and at national level She has

English about \"Theresa_May\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nTheresa May was born on 1 October 1956 in Eastbourne, Sussex She is the only child of Zaidee Mary (née Barnes; 1928–1982) and Hubert Brasier (1917–1981) [3] Her father was a Church of England clergyman (and an Anglo-Catholic) [4] who was chaplain of an Eastbourne hospital [5] He later became vicar of Enstone with Heythrop and finally of St Mary's at Wheatley, to the east of Oxford [6] [7] [8] May's mother was a supporter of the Conservative Party [9] Her father died in 1981, from injuries sustained in a car accident, and her mother of multiple sclerosis the following year [10] [11] May later stated she was \"sorry they  [her parents] never saw me elected as a Member of Parliament\" [12]\n\n\nEarly career\nBetween 1977 and 1983, May worked at the Bank of England From 1985 to 1997, she was a financial consultant at the Association for Payment Clearing Services (APACS) [24] She served as Head of the European Affairs Unit from 1989 to 1996 and Senior Adviser on International Affairs from 1996 to 1997 in the organisation [25]\n\n\nElection\nAround 18 months ahead of the 1997 general election, May was selected as the Conservative candidate for Maidenhead, a new seat which was created from parts of the safe seats of Windsor and Maidenhead and Wokingham [25] She was elected comfortably with 25,344 votes (49.8%), almost double the total of second-placed Andrew Terence Ketteringham of the Liberal Democrats, who took 13,363 votes (26.3%) [29] [28] Despite this, her party suffered their worst defeat in over 150 years.\n\n\nEarly parliamentary career\nHaving entered Parliament, May became a member of William Hague's front-bench Opposition team, as Shadow Spokesman for Schools, Disabled People and Women (1998–1999) She became the first of the 1997 MPs to enter the Shadow Cabinet when in 1999 she was appointed Shadow Education and Employment Secretary After the 2001 election the new Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith kept her in the Shadow Cabinet, moving her to the Transport portfolio.\n\n\nHome Secretary\nFollowing the formation of the coalition government after the 2010 general election on 12 May 2010, May was appointed Home Secretary and Minister for Women and Equalities by Prime Minister David Cameron as part of his first Cabinet She became the fourth woman to hold one of the British Great Offices of State, after Margaret Thatcher (Prime Minister), Margaret Beckett (Foreign Secretary) and Jacqui Smith (Home Secretary) [35] As Home Secretary, May was also a member of the National Security Council [36] She was the longest-serving Home Secretary for over 60 years, since James Chuter Ede who served over six years and two months from August 1945 to October 1951 May's appointment as Home Secretary was somewhat unexpected, with Chris Grayling having served as shadow Home Secretary in opposition [37] [38]\n\n\nPolice and crime\nSpeaking at the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) conference in June 2010, May announced radical cuts to the Home Office budget, likely to lead to a reduction in police numbers [61] In July 2010, May presented the House of Commons with proposals for a fundamental review of the previous Labour government's security and counter-terrorism legislation, including \"stop and search\" powers, and her intention to review the 28-day limit on detaining terrorist suspects without charge [62] [63]\n\n\nAnti-social behaviour\nIn July 2010, May proposed to review the previous Labour Government's anti-social behaviour legislation signalling the abolition of the \"Anti-Social Behaviour Order\" (ASBO) She identified the policy's high level of failure with almost half of ASBOs breached between 2000 and 2008, leading to \"fast-track\" criminal convictions May proposed a less punitive, community-based approach to tackling social disorder May suggested that anti-social behaviour policy \"must be turned on its head\", reversing the ASBO's role as the flagship crime control policy legislation under Labour [77] [78] Former Labour Home Secretaries David Blunkett (who introduced ASBOs) and Alan Johnson expressed their disapproval of the proposals [79]\n\n\nDrug policy\nIn July 2013, May decided to ban the stimulant khat, against the advice of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) The council reached the conclusion that there was \"insufficient evidence\" it caused health problems [80] Explaining the change in the classification May said: \"The decision to bring khat under control is finely balanced and takes into account the expert scientific advice and these broader concerns\", and pointed out that the product had already been banned in the majority of other EU member states, as well as most of the G8 countries including Canada and the US [81] A report on khat use by the ACMD published in January 2013 had noted the product had been associated with \"acute psychotic episodes\", \"chronic liver disease\" and family breakdown However, it concluded that there is no risk of harm for most users, and recommended that khat remain uncontrolled due to lack of evidence for these associations [82]\n\n\nImmigration\nIn 2010, May promised to bring the level of net migration down to less than 100,000 [89] The Independent reported in February 2015, \"The Office for National Statistics (ONS) announced a net flow of 298,000 migrants to the UK in the 12 months to September 2014—up from 210,000 in the previous year.\" [90] In total, 624,000 people migrated to the UK in the year ending September 2014 and 327,000 left in the same period Statistics showed \"significant increases in migration among both non-EU citizens—up 49,000 to 292,000—and EU citizens, which rose by 43,000 to 251,000.\" [90]\n\n\nFamily migration\nIn June 2012, May announced that new restrictions would be introduced to reduce the number of non-European Economic Area family migrants The changes were mostly intended to apply to new applicants after 9 July 2012 [95]\n\n\nDeportation decisions\nAt the Conservative Party Conference in October 2011, while arguing that the Human Rights Act needed to be amended, May gave the example of a foreign national who the Courts ruled was allowed to remain in the UK, \"because—and I am not making this up—he had a pet cat\" In response, the Royal Courts of Justice issued a statement, denying that this was the reason for the tribunal's decision in that case, and stating that the real reason was that he was in a genuine relationship with a British partner, and owning a pet cat was simply one of many pieces of evidence given to show that the relationship was \"genuine\" The Home Office had failed to apply its own rules for dealing with unmarried partners of people settled in the UK [100] Amnesty International said May's comments only fuelled \"myths and misconceptions\" about the Human Rights Act and Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke subsequently called May's comments \"laughable and childlike.\" [101] [102]\n\n\nAbu Qatada deportation\nIn July 2013, Abu Qatada, a radical cleric arrested in 2002, was deported to Jordan after a decade-long battle that had cost the nation £1.7 million in legal fees, [110] and several prior Home Secretaries had not resolved [111] The deportation was the result of a treaty negotiated by May in April 2013, under which Jordan agreed to give Qatada a fair trial, by not using evidence that may have been obtained against him through torture [112]\n\n\n\"Go Home\" advertisements\nIn August 2013, the Home Office engaged in an advertising campaign directed at illegal immigrants [115] The advertisements, in the form of mobile advertising hoardings on the back of lorries, told illegal immigrants to \"go home or face arrest\", with an image of a person in handcuffs, and were deployed in six London boroughs with substantial ethnic minority populations They were widely criticised as creating a hostile atmosphere for members of ethnic minority groups [116] The shadow Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, described their language as being reminiscent of that used by the National Front in the 1970s [117] An adjudication by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said that \"the claim  [that 106 arrests were made last week] was misleading and had not been substantiated\" was followed by the advertisements being withdrawn after being banned by the ASA [118]\n\n\nPassport backlog\nIn mid 2014, the Passport Office faced a backlog in developing processing passport applications, with around 30,000 applications hit by delays [119] David Cameron suggested this had come about due to the Passport Office's receiving an \"above normal\" 300,000-rise in applications [120] It was revealed, however, that May had been warned the year before, in July 2013, that a surge of 350,000 extra applications could occur owing to the closure of processing overseas under Chancellor Osborne's programme of cuts [121] Around £674,000 was paid to staff who helped clear the backlog [122]\n\n\nWindrush scandal\nIn April 2018, May's hostile environment policy became the focus of British politics in what came to be known as the Windrush scandal, in which members of the Windrush generation of Afro-Caribbean Britons were threatened with deportation by the Home Office and in at least 83 cases, illegally deported from the UK [123]  The policy also affected the lives of many thousands of people who were in the United Kingdom legally by causing them to be sacked from employment, [124] preventing access to health care, illegally demanding money, [125] exiling them and preventing their return to the UK, [126] and leaving them destitute The scandal led to the resignation of May's successor Amber Rudd as Home Secretary, [127]  and her replacement by Sajid Javid [128] Responding to questions in Parliament on the Windrush scandal on 25 April, May maintained that the hostile environment policy would remain government policy [129]\n\n\nBirmingham schools row\nIn June 2014, an inflamed public argument arose between Home Office and Education Ministers about responsibility for alleged extremism in Birmingham schools [130] [131] Prime Minister David Cameron intervened to resolve the row, insisting that May sack her Special Advisor Fiona Cunningham (now Hill) for releasing on May's website a confidential letter to May's colleagues, [132] and that Michael Gove, the Education Secretary, apologise to the Home Office's head of Security and Counter-Terrorism, Charles Farr, for uncomplimentary briefings of him appearing on the front page of The Times [133] [134]\n\n\nMinister for Women and Equalities\nMay held the office of Minister for Women and Equalities in parallel to her office of Home Secretary from 2010 to September 2012, when this role was taken over by Maria Miller [135]\n\n\nLeadership bid\nIn June 2016, May announced her candidacy for the leadership of the Conservative Party to succeed David Cameron, who resigned following the outcome of the European Union membership referendum in which 52 per cent of voters voted in favour of leaving the EU May emphasised the need for unity within the party regardless of positions on leaving the EU, saying she could bring \"strong leadership\" and a \"positive vision\" for the country's future Despite having backed a vote to remain in the EU, she insisted that there would be no second referendum, saying: \"The campaign was fought.. and the public gave their verdict There must be no attempts to remain inside the EU, no attempts to rejoin it through the back door.. Brexit means Brexit\" An opinion poll that day found 47 per cent of people choosing May as their preferred candidate to be prime minister [150]\n\n\nPremiership (2016–2019)\nOn 13 July 2016, two days after becoming Leader of the Conservative Party, May was appointed prime minister by Queen Elizabeth II, becoming the second female British prime minister after Margaret Thatcher [159] [160] Addressing the world's media outside 10 Downing Street, May said that she was \"honoured and humbled\" to become prime minister On becoming prime minister, May became the first woman to have held two of the Great Offices of State.\n\n\nAppointment\nOn 13 July 2016, two days after becoming Leader of the Conservative Party, May was appointed prime minister by Queen Elizabeth II, becoming the second female British prime minister after Margaret Thatcher [159] [160] Addressing the world's media outside 10 Downing Street, May said that she was \"honoured and humbled\" to become prime minister On becoming prime minister, May became the first woman to have held two of the Great Offices of State.\n\n\nCabinet changes\nMay's first Cabinet appointment was described by Reuters as \"one of the most sweeping government reshuffles for decades\", and called \"a brutal cull\" by The Daily Telegraph [164] [165] Nine of Cameron's ministers, including several prominent members, were sacked or resigned from their posts [165] The early appointments were interpreted both as an effort to reunite the Conservative Party in the wake of the UK's vote to leave the EU and as \"a shift to the right,\" according to The Guardian [166] ITV's Political Editor Robert Peston commented: \"Her rhetoric is more left-wing than Cameron's was, her cabinet is more right-wing than his was.\" [167] Although May had supported remaining in the EU, she appointed several of the most prominent advocates of Brexit to key Cabinet positions responsible for negotiating the United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union, including Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary, David Davis as Brexit Secretary, and Liam Fox as International Trade Secretary, the latter two being new positions [163] [168] Other key appointees included Amber Rudd as Home Secretary and Philip Hammond as Chancellor of the Exchequer [169]\n\n\nFirst term (2016–2017)\nThe First May ministry delayed the final approval for the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in July 2016, a project which May had objected to when she was Home Secretary [170] [171] Her political adviser Nick Timothy wrote an article in 2015 to oppose China's involvement in sensitive sectors He said that the government was \"selling our national security to China\" without rational concerns and \"the Government seems intent on ignoring the evidence and presumably the advice of the security and intelligence agencies\" [172]\n\n\n2017 general election\nIn May announced that she would call a parliamentary vote to hold an early general election on 8 June, saying that it was the \"only way to guarantee certainty and security for years ahead\" [188] May had previously ruled out an early election on five occasions over nine months [189] The election was the first snap election held under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 after MPs gave May the two-thirds super-majority required [190]\n\n\nSecond term (2017–2019)\nLess than two weeks after the 2017 State Opening of Parliament, May ordered a full public inquiry into the contaminated blood scandal [201] For this she was widely praised as successive governments going back to the 1980s had refused such an inquiry, some though speculated that May had simply been forced to announce the inquiry after a group legal action and news of fresh evidence were brought by Jason Evans [202] [203] Additionally, Andy Burnham had threatened to take evidence to the police if an inquiry were not announced [204] With over 1,000 core participants, the Infected Blood Inquiry is the biggest public inquiry ever held in the UK [205]\n\n\nMyanmar\nMay is the first British prime minister to visit Buenos Aires after the Falklands War [206] In November 2017, May said the actions of Myanmar Army and police against the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar \"looks like ethnic cleansing\" [207] According to May, \"it is something for which the Burmese authorities – and especially the military – must take full responsibility.\" [207] From the 2017 general election to December 2017, May suffered no defeats in whipped votes in the House of Commons [208] On 13 December 2017, May lost a vote on the EU Withdrawal Bill by 309 votes to 305, due to 11 Conservatives voting against the government, including Stephen Hammond who was then vice-chairman of the Conservative Party [209] [210]\n\n\nRussia\nMay accused Russia of \"threatening the international order\", \"seeking to weaponise information\" and \"deploying its state-run media organisations to plant fake stories\" [211] She further suggested the country had been meddling in the 2017 German federal election [211] in contradiction of German government officials and security experts, who had dismissed the possibility [212]\n\n\nChina\nMay promised to confront China on human rights but was praised in Communist Party-controlled media for \"sidestepping\" human rights in China during her first official visit to the country [214] The Global Times said: \"For the Prime Minister, the losses outweigh the gains if she appeases the British media at the cost of the visit's friendly atmosphere.\" [214]\n\n\nAssassination plot\nIn 2017, Islamic State terrorist Naa'imur Zakariyah Rahman was foiled in a plot to assassinate May at Downing Street [215]\n\n\nTurkey\nIn May 2018, during a three-day state visit to the UK by Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, May declared that Britain is a \"true friend\" of Turkey, but she added that \"It is important that in defence of democracy, which has been facing extraordinary pressures from the failed coup, instability across the border from Syria and from Kurdish terrorism, Turkey does not lose sight of the values it is seeking to defend.\" [216] [217] [218]\n\n\nContempt of Parliament\nOn 4 December 2018, on a motion passed by MPs by 311 to 293 votes, [219] the May Government was found in contempt of Parliament; the first government to be found in contempt in history [220] The vote was triggered by the government failing to lay before Parliament any legal advice on the proposed withdrawal agreement on the terms of the UK's departure from the European Union, after a humble address for a return was unanimously agreed to by the House of Commons on 13 November 2018 The government then agreed to publish the full legal advice [220] for Brexit that was given to the Prime Minister by the Attorney General during negotiations with the European Union.\n\n\nVote of confidence (Conservative Party)\nIn December 2018, May faced a vote of confidence in her leadership of the Conservative Party over opposition to her negotiated Brexit deal, after the number of Conservative MPs exceeded the 48 no-confidence letter threshold that the 1922 Committee Chairman, Sir Graham Brady required for the vote of confidence to be held [221] May won the vote with 200 Conservative MPs voting for her, compared to 117 voting against [222] As part of her speech to the Parliamentary Conservative Party before the confidence vote was opened, it was reported that May conceded that she would step down as prime minister after delivering Brexit and would not lead the Conservative Party into the next General Election in exchange for Conservative MPs voting to have confidence in her leadership so that she would be able to keep the party, Parliament and the UK stable during the final stages of Brexit May later confirmed this to BBC News Political editor, Laura Kuenssberg after meeting EU leaders, including Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels [223]\n\n\nVote of no confidence (House of Commons)\nOn 17 December 2018 in the House of Commons, the Leader of the Opposition and Labour Party Leader, Jeremy Corbyn, tabled a motion of no confidence in May's premiership, citing May's refusal to set the date for the meaningful vote on her Brexit deal before Christmas, and instead pushing it back to mid-January [224] The following day the government refused to allow time for the motion to be debated John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons, confirmed that they were under no obligation to do so [225] Following the defeat of May's Brexit deal on 15 January 2019, Corbyn tabled a motion of no confidence in the Government, to be voted on by parliament the following evening [226] [227] [228] The motion was defeated by 325 votes to 306; a majority of 19.\n\n\nBrexit deal defeats\nIn January 2019, May's government was defeated in the House of Commons by a margin of 230 votes (202 in favour and 432 opposed) in a vote on her deal to leave the European Union (\"first meaningful vote\") It was the largest majority against a United Kingdom government in history [229]\n\n\nResignation\nI will shortly leave the job that it has been the honour of my life to hold – the second female Prime Minister but certainly not the last I do so with no ill-will, but with enormous and enduring gratitude to have had the opportunity to serve the country I love.\n\nMinisterial resignations\nMay's premiership had 51 resignations with 33 relating to Brexit These included 12 departures from the Cabinet The pace and number of resignations have been described as 'unprecedented' by the Institute for Government, [241] with resignations impacting the functioning of the government [242] In less than three years, May received more resignations than Thatcher (11 years) or Blair (10 years) The Chief Whip Julian Smith described May's Cabinet as exhibiting the 'worst cabinet ill-discipline in history' [243]\n\n\nPublic opinion\nMay had a high approval rating during her first week as prime minister The results of an Ipsos MORI survey released in July 2016 indicated that 55% of those surveyed believed that May was a suitable PM while only 23% believed that the Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn would make a good prime minister [244]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nMay has identified herself with the one-nation conservative position within her party [256]\n\n\nForeign policy\nIn 2003, May voted to approve the invasion of Iraq and in 2013 voted in favour of British military intervention in the Syrian civil war [275]\n\n\nEconomic policy\nPrior to her premiership, May outlined plans to backtrack on the longstanding government plan to achieve a surplus by 2020, following the UK's withdrawal from the European Union With uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook, Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond has suggested that the government's Autumn Statement may be used to \"reset\" economic policy [283]\n\n\nWorkers' representatives\nBefore her premiership began, May said that she planned to have workers represented on company boards, saying \"If I'm prime minister .. we're going to have not just consumers represented on company boards, but workers as well.\" [290] May aimed to put workers' and consumers' representatives on boards to make them more accountable [291] Nils Pratley, a journalist at The Guardian, wrote in July \"Fundamental principles of Britain's boardroom governance are being rethought It is a very welcome development In the more enlightened quarters of the UK corporate world, they can see that boardroom pay has eroded trust in business.\"

September 2024 [359]\n\n\nPersonal life\nMay has been married to Sir Philip May, an investment relationship manager, [360] since 6 September 1980 [361] It has been reported that former prime minister of Pakistan Benazir Bhutto introduced the two during their time at Oxford [362] May credits future Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull for encouraging Philip to propose to her [363] May has

Indian playback singer, actress, and classical singer. Born on September 8, 1933, in Sangli, Maharashtra, India, she is the younger sister of legendary playback singer Lata Mangeshkar. Bhosle's career spans over seven decades, with thousands of songs to her credit in numerous languages, including Hindi, Marathi, Bengali, and others.\n\n**Early Life and Career**\n\nAsha Mangeshkar was born in the small hamlet of Goar in Sangli, then in the salute princely state of Sangli (now in Maharashtra), into the musical family of Pandit Deenanath Mangeshkar, who was Marathi and Konkani, and his Gujarati wife, Shevanti Deenanath was an actor and classical singer on the Marathi musical stage. When Bhosle was nine years old, her father died. The family moved from Pune to Kolhapur and then to Mumbai. She and her elder sister Lata Mangeshkar began singing and acting in films to support their family. Bhosle sang her first film song \"Chala Chala Nav Bala\" for the Marathi film Majha Bal (1943). The music for the film was composed by Datta Davjekar. She made her Hindi film debut when she sang the song \"Saawan Aaya\" for Hansraj Behl's Chunariya (1948).\n\n**Career**\n\nIn the late 1940s to early 1950s, prominent playback singers like Geeta Dutt, Shamshad Begum, and Lata Mangeshkar dominated the singing for the female lead and the big films. In the 1950s, Bhosle sang more songs than most playback singers in Hindi films. Most of these were in low-budget films. Her earliest songs were composed by A R Qureshi, Sajjad Hussain, S Mohinder, Sardar Malik, Ghulam Mohammed, and some others. Singing in Sangdil (1952), composed by Sajjad Hussain, she got reasonable recognition. In the same year, she sang lead in the film Chham Chhama Chham, under O P Nayyar, she sang 10 out of 11 songs in that film. Consequently, film director Bimal Roy gave her a chance to sing in Parineeta (1953). Raj Kapoor signed her to sing all songs in Boot Polish (1954), which gained her popularity.\n\n**Partnership with Music Directors**\n\nBhosle's partnership with music directors is an integral part of her career. Her association with O P Nayyar is part of Hindi film lore. He was the composer who first gave Bhosle her own identity. Many people have speculated about a romantic relationship between the two. Khayyam, another music director who recognized Bhosle's talent early, gave her some good assignments in the 1950s, including Footpath and Phir Subah Hogi.

the squad, who had an average age of 22, were nicknamed \"the Busby Babes\" by the media, a testament to Busby's faith in his youth players [27] In 1957, Manchester United became the first English team to compete in the European Cup, despite objections from The Football League, who had denied Chelsea the same opportunity the previous season [28] En route to the semi-final, which they lost to Real Madrid, the team recorded a 10–0 victory over Belgian champions Anderlecht, which remains the club's biggest victory on record [29]\n\n\n1969–1986\nFollowing an eighth-place finish in the 1969–70 season and a poor start to the 1970–71 season, Busby was persuaded to temporarily resume managerial duties, and McGuinness returned to his position as reserve team coach In June 1971, Frank O'Farrell was appointed as manager, but lasted less than 18 months before being replaced by Tommy Docherty in December 1972 [39] Docherty saved Manchester United from relegation that season, only to see them relegated in 1974; by that time the trio of Best, Law, and Charlton had left the club [35] The team won promotion at the first attempt and reached the FA Cup final in 1976, but were beaten by Southampton They reached the final again in 1977, beating Liverpool 2–1 Docherty was dismissed shortly afterwards, following the revelation of his affair with the club physiotherapist's wife [37] [40]\n\n\nFerguson years (1986–2013)\nAlex Ferguson and his assistant Archie Knox arrived from Aberdeen on the day of Atkinson's dismissal, [43] and guided the club to an 11th-place finish in the league [44] Despite a second-place finish in 1987–88, the club was back in 11th place the following season [45] Reportedly on the verge of being dismissed, Ferguson's job was saved by victory over Crystal Palace in the 1990 FA Cup final [46] [47] The following season, Manchester United claimed their first UEFA Cup Winners' Cup title That triumph allowed the club to compete in the European Super Cup for the first time, where United beat European Cup holders Red Star Belgrade 1–0 at Old Trafford The club appeared in two consecutive League Cup finals in 1991 and 1992, beating Nottingham Forest 1–0 in the second to win that competition for the first time as well [42] In 1993, in the first season of the newly founded Premier League, the club won their first league title since 1967, and a year later, for the first time since 1957, they won a second consecutive title – alongside the FA Cup – to complete the first \"Double\" in the club's history [42] United then became the first English club to do the Double twice when they won both competitions again in 1995–96, [48] before retaining the league title once more in 1996–97 with a game to spare [49]\n\n\nPost-Ferguson years and struggles (2013–present)\nOn 8 May 2013, Ferguson announced that he was to retire as manager at the end of the football season, but would remain at the club as a director and club ambassador [65] [66] He retired as the most decorated manager in football history [67] [68] The club announced the next day that Everton manager David Moyes would replace him from 1 July, having signed a six-year contract [69] [70] [71] Ryan Giggs took over as interim player-manager 10 months later, on 22 April 2014, when Moyes was sacked after a poor season in which the club failed to defend their Premier League title and failed to qualify for the UEFA Champions League for the first time since 1995–96 [72] They also failed to qualify for the UEFA Europa League, the first time Manchester United had not qualified for a European competition since 1990 [73] On 19 May 2014, it was confirmed that Louis van Gaal would replace Moyes as Manchester United manager on a three-year deal, with Giggs as his assistant [74] Malcolm Glazer, the patriarch of the family that owns the club, died on 28 May 2014 [75]\n\n\nCrest and colours\nThe club crest is derived from the Manchester City Council coat of arms, although all that remains of it on the current crest is the ship in full sail [101] The devil stems from the club's nickname \"The Red Devils\" inspired from Salford Rugby Club; [102] [103] it was included on club programmes and scarves in the 1960s, and incorporated into the club crest in 1970, although the crest was not included on the chest of the shirt until 1971 [101] In 1975, the red devil (\"A devil facing the sinister guardant supporting with both hands a trident gules\") was granted as a heraldic badge by the College of Arms to the English Football League for use by Manchester United [104] In 2023, the Red Devil motif alone, which had been used in promotional items and merchandise previously, was used as the sole badge on the Manchester United third kit The existing crest remains on the home and away kits.\n\n\nGrounds\nNewton Heath initially played on a field on North Road, close to the railway yard; the original capacity was about 12,000, but club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club hoping to join The Football League [117] Some expansion took place in 1887, and in 1891, Newton Heath used its minimal financial reserves to purchase two grandstands, each able to hold 1,000 spectators [118] Although attendances were not recorded for many of the earliest matches at North Road, the highest documented attendance was approximately 15,000 for a First Division match against Sunderland on 4 March 1893 [119] A similar attendance was also recorded for a friendly match against Gorton Villa on 5 September 1889 [120]\n\n\n1878–1893: North Road\nNewton Heath initially played on a field on North Road, close to the railway yard; the original capacity was about 12,000, but club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club hoping to join The Football League [117] Some expansion took place in 1887, and in 1891, Newton Heath used its minimal financial reserves to purchase two grandstands, each able to hold 1,000 spectators [118] Although attendances were not recorded for many of the earliest matches at North Road, the highest documented attendance was approximately 15,000 for a First Division match against Sunderland on 4 March 1893 [119] A similar attendance was also recorded for a friendly match against Gorton Villa on 5 September 1889 [120]\n\n\n1893–1910: Bank Street\nIn June 1893, after the club was evicted from North Road by its owners, Manchester Deans and Canons, who felt it was inappropriate for the club to charge an entry fee to the ground, secretary A H Albut procured the use of the Bank Street ground in Clayton [121] It initially had no stands, by the start of the 1893–94 season, two had been built; one spanning the full length of the pitch on one side and the other behind the goal at the \"Bradford end\" At the opposite end, the \"Clayton end\", the ground had been \"built up, thousands thus being provided for\" [121] Newton Heath's first league match at Bank Street was played against Burnley on 1 September 1893, when 10,000 people saw Alf Farman score a hat-trick, Newton Heath's only goals in a 3–2 win The remaining stands were completed for the following league game against Nottingham Forest three weeks later [121] In October 1895, before the visit of Manchester City, the club purchased a 2,000-capacity stand from the Broughton Rangers rugby league club, and put up another stand on the \"reserved side\" (as distinct from the \"popular side\"); however, weather restricted the attendance for the Manchester City match to just 12,000 [122]\n\n\n1910–present: Old Trafford\nFollowing Manchester United's first league title in 1908 and the FA Cup a year later, it was decided that Bank Street was too restrictive for Davies' ambition; [124] in February 1909, six weeks before the club's first FA Cup title, Old Trafford was named as the home of Manchester United, following the purchase of land for around £60,000 Architect Archibald Leitch was given a budget of £30,000 for construction; original plans called for seating capacity of 100,000, though budget constraints forced a revision to 77,000 [125] [126] The building was constructed by Messrs Brameld and Smith of Manchester The stadium's record attendance was registered on 25 March 1939, when an FA Cup semi-final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby Town drew 76,962 spectators [127]\n\n\nSupport\nManchester United is one of the most popular football clubs in the world, with one of the highest average home attendances in Europe [140] The club states that its worldwide fan base includes more than 200 officially recognised branches of the Manchester United Supporters Club (MUSC), in at least 24 countries [141] The club takes advantage of this support through its worldwide summer tours Accountancy firm and sports industry consultants Deloitte estimate that Manchester United has 75 million fans worldwide [11] The club has the third highest social media following in the world among sports teams (after Barcelona and Real Madrid), with over 82 million Facebook followers as of July 2023 [12] [142] A 2014 study showed that Manchester United had the loudest fans in the Premier League [143]\n\n\nRivalries\nManchester United has high-profile rivalries with Liverpool and local neighbours Manchester City The club has also had rivalries throughout its history with the likes of Arsenal, Leeds United and Chelsea [146] [147]\n\n\nGlobal brand\nManchester United has been described as a global brand; a 2011 report by Brand Finance, valued the club's trademarks and associated intellectual property at £412 million – an increase of £39 million on the previous year, valuing it at £11 million more than the second best brand, Real Madrid – and gave the brand a strength rating of AAA (Extremely Strong) [164] In July 2012, Manchester United was ranked first by Forbes magazine in its list of the ten most valuable sports team brands, valuing the Manchester United brand at $2.23 billion [165] The club is ranked third in the Deloitte Football Money League (behind Real Madrid and Barcelona) [166] In January 2013, the club became the first sports team in the world to be valued at $3 billion [167] Forbes magazine valued the club at $3.3 billion – $1.2 billion higher than the next most valuable sports team [167] They were overtaken by Real Madrid for the next four years, but Manchester United returned to the top of the Forbes list in June 2017, with a valuation of $3.689 billion [168]\n\n\nSponsorship\nIn an initial five-year deal worth £500,000, Sharp Electronics became the club's first shirt sponsor at the beginning of the 1982–83 season, a relationship that lasted until the end of the 1999–2000 season, when Vodafone agreed a four-year, £30 million deal [176] Vodafone agreed to pay £36 million to extend the deal by four years, but after two seasons triggered a break clause in order to concentrate on its sponsorship of the Champions League [176]\n\n\nOwnership and finances\nOriginally funded by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, the club became a limited company in 1892 and sold shares to local supporters for £1 via an application form [19] In 1902, majority ownership passed to the four local businessmen who invested £500 to save the club from bankruptcy, including future club president John Henry Davies [19] After his death in 1927, the club faced bankruptcy yet again, but was saved in December 1931 by James W Gibson, who assumed control of the club after an investment of £2,000 [24] Gibson promoted his son, Alan, to the board in 1948, [200] but died three years later; the Gibson family retained ownership of the club through James' wife, Lillian, [201] but the position of chairman passed to former player Harold Hardman [202]\n\n\nGlazer ownership\nIn May 2005, Malcolm Glazer purchased the 28.7 per cent stake held by McManus and Magnier, thus acquiring a controlling interest through his investment vehicle Red Football Ltd in a highly leveraged takeover valuing the club at approximately £800 million (then approx $1.5 billion) [209] Once the purchase was complete, the club was taken off the stock exchange [210] Much of the takeover money was borrowed by the Glazers; the debts were transferred to the club As a result, the club went from being debt-free to being saddled with debts of £540 million, at interest rates of between 7% and 20% [15] [211] [212]\n\n\nPlayers\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\n\n\nFirst-team squad\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\n\n\nOut on loan\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\n\n\nUnder-21s and Academy\nList of under-21s and academy players with articles\n\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\n\n\nOut on loan\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\n\n\nPlayer of the Year awards\nManchester United is one of the most successful clubs in Europe in terms of trophies won [272] The club's first trophy was the Manchester Cup, which they won as Newton Heath LYR in 1886 [273] In 1908, the club won their first league title, and won the FA Cup for the first time the following year Since then, they have gone on to win a record 20 top-division titles – including a record 13 Premier League titles – and their total of 13 FA Cups is second only to Arsenal (14) Those titles have meant the club has appeared a record 30 times in the FA Community Shield (formerly the FA Charity Shield), which is played at the start of each season between the winners of the league and FA Cup from the previous season;

The club was founded in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR Football Club by the Carriage and Wagon department of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) depot at Newton Heath. The team initially played games against other departments and railway companies, but on 20 November 1880, they competed in their first recorded match; wearing the colours of the railway company – green and gold – they were defeated 6–0 by Bolton Wanderers' reserve team.\n\n**Early years (1878–1945)**\n\nBy 1888, the club had become a founding member of The Combination, a regional football league. Following the league's dissolution after only one season, Newton Heath joined the newly formed Football Alliance, which ran for three seasons before being merged with The Football League. This resulted in the club starting the 1892–93 season in the First Division, by which time it had become independent of the railway company and dropped the \"LYR\" from its name. After two seasons, the club was relegated to the Second Division.\n\n**Busby years (1945–1969)**\n\nIn October 1945, the impending resumption of football after the war led to the managerial appointment of Matt Busby, who demanded an unprecedented level of control over team selection, player transfers, and training sessions. Busby led the team to second-place league finishes in 1947, 1948, and 1949, and to FA Cup victory in 1948. In 1952, the club won the First Division, its first league title for 41 years. They then won back-to-back league titles in 1956 and 1957; the squad, who had an average age of 22, were nicknamed \"the Busby Babes\" by the media, a testament to Busby's faith in his youth players. In 1957, Manchester United became the first English team to compete in the European Cup, despite objections from The Football League, who had denied Chelsea the same opportunity the previous season.\n\n**1969–1986**\n\nFollowing an eighth-place finish in the 1969–70 season and a poor start to the 1970–71 season, Busby was persuaded to temporarily resume managerial duties, and McGuinness returned to his position as reserve team coach. In June 1971, Frank O'Farrell was appointed as manager, but lasted less than 18 months before being replaced by Tommy Docherty in December 1972. Docherty saved Manchester United from relegation that season, only to see them relegated in 1974; by that time the trio of Best, Law, and Charlton had left the club.\n\n**Ferguson years (1986–2013)**\n\nAlex Ferguson and his assistant Archie Knox arrived from Aberdeen on the day of Atkinson's dismissal, and guided the club to an 11th-place finish in the league. Despite a second-place finish in 1987–88, the club was back in 11th place the following season. Reportedly on the verge of being dismissed, Ferguson's job was saved by victory over Crystal Palace in the 1990 FA Cup final. The following season, Manchester United claimed its first UEFA Cup Winners' Cup title. That triumph allowed the club to compete in the European Super Cup for the first time, where United beat European Cup holders Red Star Belgrade 1–0 at Old Trafford.\n\n**Post-Ferguson years and struggles (2013–present)**\n\nOn 8 May 2013, Ferguson announced that he was to retire as manager at the end of the football season, but would remain at the club as a director and club ambassador. He retired as the most decorated manager in football history. The club announced the next day that Everton manager David Moyes would replace him from 1 July, having signed a six-year contract. Ryan Giggs took over as interim player-manager 10 months later, on 22 April 2014, when Moyes was sacked after a poor season in which the club failed to defend their Premier League title and failed to qualify for the UEFA Champions League for the first time since 1995–96.\n\n**Ownership and finances**\n\nOriginally funded by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, the club became a limited company in 1892 and sold shares to local supporters for £1 via an application form. In 1902, majority ownership passed to the four local businessmen who invested £500 to save the club from bankruptcy, including future club president John Henry Davies. After his death in 1927, the club faced bankruptcy yet again, but was saved in December 1931 by James W Gibson, who assumed control of the club after an investment of £2,000.\n\n**Grounds**\n\nNewton Heath initially played on a field on North Road, close to the railway yard; the original capacity was about 12,000, but club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club hoping to join The Football League. In June 1893, after the club was evicted from North Road by its owners, Manchester Deans and Canons, who felt it was inappropriate for the club to charge an entry fee to the ground, secretary A H Albut procured the use of the Bank Street ground in Clayton. A record attendance of 76,962 was set at Old Trafford on 25 March 1939, when an FA Cup semi-final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby Town drew 76,962 spectators.\n\n**Support**\n\nManchester United is one of the most popular football clubs in the world, with one of the highest average home attendances in Europe. The club states that its worldwide fan base includes more than 200 officially recognised branches of the Manchester United Supporters Club (MUSC), in at least 24 countries. Deloitte estimate that Manchester United has 75 million fans worldwide. The club has the third highest social media following in the world among sports teams, with over 82 million Facebook followers as of July 2023.\n\n**Rivalries**\n\nManchester United has high-profile rivalries with Liverpool and local neighbours Manchester City. The club has also had rivalries throughout its history with the likes of Arsenal, Leeds United, and Chelsea.\n\n**Honours**\n\nManchester United is one of the most successful clubs in Europe in terms of trophies won. The club's first trophy was the Manchester Cup, which they won as Newton Heath LYR in 1886. In 1908, the club won its first league title, and won the FA Cup for the first time the following year. Since then, they have gone on to win a record 20 top-division titles – including a record 13 Premier League titles – and their total of 13 FA Cups is second only to Arsenal (14). Those titles have meant the club has appeared a record 30 times in the FA Community Shield (formerly the FA Charity Shield), which is played at the start of each season between the winners of the league and FA Cup from the previous season; of those 30 appearances, Manchester United have won a record 21, including four times when the match was drawn and the trophy shared by the two clubs.\n\n**Doubles and Trebles**\n\nShort competitions – such as the FA Charity/Community Shield, Intercontinental Cup (now defunct), FIFA Club World Cup or UEFA Super Cup – are not generally considered to contribute towards a Double or Treble.\n\n**Manchester United Women**\n\nManchester United Supporters Club Ladies began operations in the late 1970s and was unofficially recognised as the club's senior women's team. They became founding members of the North West Women's Regional Football League in 1989. The team made an official partnership with Manchester United in 2001, becoming the club's official women's team; however, in 2005, following Malcolm Glazer's takeover, the club was disbanded as it was seen to be \"unprofitable\". In 2018, Manchester United formed a new women's football team, which entered the second division of women's football in England for their debut season. The women's football team won their first trophy on 12 May 2024 as they lifted the Women's FA Cup as they defeated Tottenham Hotspur 4–0.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Manchester_United_F.C.\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nManchester United were formed in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR Football Club by the Carriage and Wagon department of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) depot at Newton Heath [16] The team initially played games against other departments and railway companies, but on 20 November 1880, they competed in their first recorded match; wearing the colours of the railway company – green and gold – they were defeated 6–0 by Bolton Wanderers' reserve team [17] By 1888, the club had become a founding member of The Combination, a regional football league Following the league's dissolution after only one season, Newton Heath joined the newly formed Football Alliance, which ran for three seasons before being merged with The Football League This resulted in the club starting the 1892–93 season in the First Division, by which time it had become independent of the railway company and dropped the \"LYR\" from its name [16] After two seasons, the club was relegated to the Second Division [16]\n\n\nEarly years (1878–1945)\nManchester United were formed in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR Football Club by the Carriage and Wagon department of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) depot at Newton Heath [16] The team initially played games against other departments and railway companies, but on 20 November 1880, they competed in their first recorded match;

the squad, who had an average age of 22, were nicknamed \"the Busby Babes\" by the media, a testament to Busby's faith in his youth players [27] In 1957, Manchester United became the first English team to compete in the European Cup, despite objections from The Football League, who had denied Chelsea the same opportunity the previous season [28] En route to the semi-final, which they lost to Real Madrid, the team recorded a 10–0 victory over Belgian champions Anderlecht, which remains the club's biggest victory on record [29]\n\n\n1969–1986\nFollowing an eighth-place finish in the 1969–70 season and a poor start to the 1970–71 season, Busby was persuaded to temporarily resume managerial duties, and McGuinness returned to his position as reserve team coach In June 1971, Frank O'Farrell was appointed as manager, but lasted less than 18 months before being replaced by Tommy Docherty in December 1972 [39] Docherty saved Manchester United from relegation that season, only to see them relegated in 1974; by that time the trio of Best, Law, and Charlton had left the club [35] The team won promotion at the first attempt and reached the FA Cup final in 1976, but were beaten by Southampton They reached the final again in 1977, beating Liverpool 2–1 Docherty was dismissed shortly afterwards, following the revelation of his affair with the club physiotherapist's wife [37] [40]\n\n\nFerguson years (1986–2013)\nAlex Ferguson and his assistant Archie Knox arrived from Aberdeen on the day of Atkinson's dismissal, [43] and guided the club to an 11th-place finish in the league [44] Despite a second-place finish in 1987–88, the club was back in 11th place the following season [45] Reportedly on the verge of being dismissed, Ferguson's job was saved by victory over Crystal Palace in the 1990 FA Cup final [46] [47] The following season, Manchester United claimed their first UEFA Cup Winners' Cup title That triumph allowed the club to compete in the European Super Cup for the first time, where United beat European Cup holders Red Star Belgrade 1–0 at Old Trafford The club appeared in two consecutive League Cup finals in 1991 and 1992, beating Nottingham Forest 1–0 in the second to win that competition for the first time as well [42] In 1993, in the first season of the newly founded Premier League, the club won their first league title since 1967, and a year later, for the first time since 1957, they won a second consecutive title – alongside the FA Cup – to complete the first \"Double\" in the club's history [42] United then became the first English club to do the Double twice when they won both competitions again in 1995–96, [48] before retaining the league title once more in 1996–97 with a game to spare [49]\n\n\nPost-Ferguson years and struggles (2013–present)\nOn 8 May 2013, Ferguson announced that he was to retire as manager at the end of the football season, but would remain at the club as a director and club ambassador [65] [66] He retired as the most decorated manager in football history [67] [68] The club announced the next day that Everton manager David Moyes would replace him from 1 July, having signed a six-year contract [69] [70] [71] Ryan Giggs took over as interim player-manager 10 months later, on 22 April 2014, when Moyes was sacked after a poor season in which the club failed to defend their Premier League title and failed to qualify for the UEFA Champions League for the first time since 1995–96 [72] They also failed to qualify for the UEFA Europa League, the first time Manchester United had not qualified for a European competition since 1990 [73] On 19 May 2014, it was confirmed that Louis van Gaal would replace Moyes as Manchester United manager on a three-year deal, with Giggs as his assistant [74] Malcolm Glazer, the patriarch of the family that owns the club, died on 28 May 2014 [75]\n\n\nCrest and colours\nThe club crest is derived from the Manchester City Council coat of arms, although all that remains of it on the current crest is the ship in full sail [101] The devil stems from the club's nickname \"The Red Devils\" inspired from Salford Rugby Club; [102] [103] it was included on club programmes and scarves in the 1960s, and incorporated into the club crest in 1970, although the crest was not included on the chest of the shirt until 1971 [101] In 1975, the red devil (\"A devil facing the sinister guardant supporting with both hands a trident gules\") was granted as a heraldic badge by the College of Arms to the English Football League for use by Manchester United [104] In 2023, the Red Devil motif alone, which had been used in promotional items and merchandise previously, was used as the sole badge on the Manchester United third kit The existing crest remains on the home and away kits.\n\n\nGrounds\nNewton Heath initially played on a field on North Road, close to the railway yard; the original capacity was about 12,000, but club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club hoping to join The Football League [117] Some expansion took place in 1887, and in 1891, Newton Heath used its minimal financial reserves to purchase two grandstands, each able to hold 1,000 spectators [118] Although attendances were not recorded for many of the earliest matches at North Road, the highest documented attendance was approximately 15,000 for a First Division match against Sunderland on 4 March 1893 [119] A similar attendance was also recorded for a friendly match against Gorton Villa on 5 September 1889 [120]\n\n\n1878–1893: North Road\nNewton Heath initially played on a field on North Road, close to the railway yard;

one spanning the full length of the pitch on one side and the other behind the goal at the \"Bradford end\" At the opposite end, the \"Clayton end\", the ground had been \"built up, thousands thus being provided for\" [121] Newton Heath's first league match at Bank Street was played against Burnley on 1 September 1893, when 10,000 people saw Alf Farman score a hat-trick, Newton Heath's only goals in a 3–2 win The remaining stands were completed for the following league game against Nottingham Forest three weeks later [121] In October 1895, before the visit of Manchester City, the club purchased a 2,000-capacity stand from the Broughton Rangers rugby league club, and put up another stand on the \"reserved side\" (as distinct from the \"popular side\"); however, weather restricted the attendance for the Manchester City match to just 12,000 [122]\n\n\n1910–present: Old Trafford\nFollowing Manchester United's first league title in 1908 and the FA Cup a year later, it was decided that Bank Street was too restrictive for Davies' ambition; [124] in February 1909, six weeks before the club's first FA Cup title, Old Trafford was named as the home of Manchester United, following the purchase of land for around £60,000 Architect Archibald Leitch was given a budget of £30,000 for construction; original plans called for seating capacity of 100,000, though budget constraints forced a revision to 77,000 [125] [126] The building was constructed by Messrs Brameld and Smith of Manchester The stadium's record attendance was registered on 25 March 1939, when an FA Cup semi-final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby Town drew 76,962 spectators [127]\n\n\nSupport\nManchester United is one of the most popular football clubs in the world, with one of the highest average home attendances in Europe [140] The club states that its worldwide fan base includes more than 200 officially recognised branches of the Manchester United Supporters Club (MUSC), in at least 24 countries [141] The club takes advantage of this support through its worldwide summer tours Accountancy firm and sports industry consultants Deloitte estimate that Manchester United has 75 million fans worldwide [11] The club has the third highest social media following in the world among sports teams (after Barcelona and Real Madrid), with over 82 million Facebook followers as of July 2023 [12] [142] A 2014 study showed that Manchester United had the loudest fans in the Premier League [143]\n\n\nRivalries\nManchester United has high-profile rivalries with Liverpool and local neighbours Manchester City The club has also had rivalries throughout its history with the likes of Arsenal, Leeds United and Chelsea [146] [147]\n\n\nGlobal brand\nManchester United has been described as a global brand; a 2011 report by Brand Finance, valued the club's trademarks and associated intellectual property at £412 million – an increase of £39 million on the previous year, valuing it at £11 million more than the second best brand, Real Madrid – and gave the brand a strength rating of AAA (Extremely Strong) [164] In July 2012, Manchester United was ranked first by Forbes magazine in its list of the ten most valuable sports team brands, valuing the Manchester United brand at $2.23 billion [165] The club is ranked third in the Deloitte Football Money League (behind Real Madrid and Barcelona) [166] In January 2013, the club became the first sports team in the world to be valued at $3 billion [167] Forbes magazine valued the club at $3.3 billion – $1.2 billion higher than the next most valuable sports team [167] They were overtaken by Real Madrid for the next four years, but Manchester United returned to the top of the Forbes list in June 2017, with a valuation of $3.689 billion [168]\n\n\nSponsorship\nIn an initial five-year deal worth £500,000, Sharp Electronics became the club's first shirt sponsor at the beginning of the 1982–83 season, a relationship that lasted until the end of the 1999–2000 season, when Vodafone agreed a four-year, £30 million deal [176] Vodafone agreed to pay £36 million to extend the deal by four years, but after two seasons triggered a break clause in order to concentrate on its sponsorship of the Champions League [176]\n\n\nOwnership and finances\nOriginally funded by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, the club became a limited company in 1892 and sold shares to local supporters for £1 via an application form [19] In 1902, majority ownership passed to the four local businessmen who invested £500 to save the club from bankruptcy, including future club president John Henry Davies [19] After his death in 1927, the club faced bankruptcy yet again, but was saved in December 1931 by James W Gibson, who assumed control of the club after an investment of £2,000 [24] Gibson promoted his son, Alan, to the board in 1948, [200] but died three years later; the Gibson family retained ownership of the club through James' wife, Lillian, [201] but the position of chairman passed to former player Harold Hardman [202]\n\n\nGlazer ownership\nIn May 2005, Malcolm Glazer purchased the 28.7 per cent stake held by McManus and Magnier, thus acquiring a controlling interest through his investment vehicle Red Football Ltd in a highly leveraged takeover valuing the club at approximately £800 million (then approx $1.5 billion) [209] Once the purchase was complete, the club was taken off the stock exchange [210] Much of the takeover money was borrowed by the Glazers; the debts were transferred to the club As a result, the club went from being debt-free to being saddled with debts of £540 million, at interest rates of between 7% and 20% [15] [211] [212]\n\n\nPlayers\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\n\n\nFirst-team squad\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\n\n\nOut on loan\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\n\n\nUnder-21s and Academy\nList of under-21s and academy players with articles\n\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\n\n\nOut on loan\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\n\n\nPlayer of the Year awards\nManchester United is one of the most successful clubs in Europe in terms of trophies won [272] The club's first trophy was the Manchester Cup, which they won as Newton Heath LYR in 1886 [273] In 1908, the club won their first league title, and won the FA Cup for the first time the following year Since then, they have gone on to win a record 20 top-division titles – including a record 13 Premier League titles – and their total of 13 FA Cups is second only to Arsenal (14) Those titles have meant the club has appeared a record 30 times in the FA Community Shield (formerly the FA Charity Shield), which is played at the start of each season between the winners of the league and FA Cup from the previous season;

He made his full debut in Avengers #196 (June 1980).\n\nFictional Character Biography\n-----------------------------\n\nTaskmaster is a mysterious figure believed to have been born in the Bronx, New York City. He is able to mimic the physical movements of anyone he witnesses, a skill he claims to have had since childhood. Taskmaster is a combat instructor and part-time mercenary. Initially portrayed as a villain, he has also trained U.S. Agent and other neophyte superheroes at the behest of the U.S. government. As a mercenary, Taskmaster has no ideology except that of his employer. Taskmaster has occasionally been used to impersonate other characters.\n\nPowers and Abilities\n---------------------\n\nTaskmaster injected himself with SS-Hauptsturmführer Horst Gorscht's primer, an elaborate modification of the adrenal steroid cortisol designed to unlock the mind's procedural memory potential. This increased Taskmaster's natural ability to absorb knowledge. This ability is linked to his muscle memory, allowing Taskmaster to instantly replicate the physical movement of peak-level humans. Taskmaster cannot duplicate a physical feat that requires superhuman effort, like lifting a car. These \"photographic reflexes\" have made Taskmaster highly skilled in various forms of combat: martial arts (mimicking Elektra, Iron Fist, Shang-Chi), swordfighting (Black Knight, Silver Samurai, Swordsman), marksmanship (Captain America with a shield, Hawkeye with a bow and arrow, the Punisher with firearms, and Bullseye with various projectiles); he also displays a strenuously honed athletic ability (Black Panther, Daredevil, Spider-Man). Taskmaster can use every fighting style he has watched in any given fight. Once the Taskmaster has mastered an opponent's physical movements, he can predict the next attack. A few people can negate Taskmaster's abilities; among them are Deadpool, whose manic personality makes him nearly impossible to predict; Mister X, who uses his psychic abilities to get the better of Taskmaster in a fight; and Slapstick, whose flexible cartoony body causes Taskmaster to break his own spine upon copying the hero's ability. A side effect of the primer is severe declarative memory loss. As he gains implicit memories (i.e., knowledge and abilities), he loses explicit memories (i.e., personal experiences). The Org (Mercedes Merced) has acted as Taskmaster's surrogate memory, his banker, and his handler during his criminal career.\n\nWeaponry\n---------\n\nTaskmaster carries many weapons.

Taskmaster once used a stolen S.H.I.E.L.D device that was able to create various forms of weaponry (such as arrows and shields) using solid energy.\n\nOther Versions\n----------------\n\nIn the Age of Ultron story, the Taskmaster is depicted as working with the Black Panther and Red Hulk in Chicago attempting to capture Ultron Sentinel technology. Successful in doing so, Red Hulk holds off the Ultron minions to allow Taskmaster and Black Panther to escape. When Taskmaster tries to run away with one of the Ultron Sentinels, Red Hulk tells him he doesn't trust him, and then kills him.\n\nAvataars: Covenant of the Shield\n--------------------------------\n\nAn alternate version of the Taskmaster appears in Avataars: Covenant of the Shield #1 (2000) where the Marvel Universe is re-imagined in a fantasy setting. In this reality, the Taskmaster is an assassin known as the Deathmaster.\n\nDeadpool Max\n-------------\n\nA female version of Taskmaster appeared in the Marvel Max series Deadpool Max.

However, he is exposed after murdering Tigra.\n\nJLA/Avengers\n-------------\n\nTaskmaster appears in JLA/Avengers #4 as a brainwashed minion of Krona.\n\nMarvel Apes\n------------\n\nA primate version of the Taskmaster appears in the Marvel Apes titles Marvel Apes: Evolution Starts Here #1 (2009), Marvel: Apes: Speedball Special #1 (2009), and Marvel Apes: Grunt Line Special #1 (2009).\n\nMarvel Universe Millennial Visions 2001\n--------------------------------------\n\nIn the Marvel Universe Millennial Visions 2001 (2002) storyline Thunderbolts: Give a Guy a Break, Hawkeye takes it upon himself to force supervillains to seek redemption. The Taskmaster is among the supervillains hypnotized by the Ringmaster and forced to become a member of the Thunderbolts.\n\nMarvel Universe vs. the Punisher\n---------------------------------\n\nIn Marvel Universe vs the Punisher #4 (September 2010), where the Marvel Universe is infected by a cannibal plague, the Taskmaster is killed when the Red Hulk tears his head off.\n\nMarvel vs. Capcom\n-----------------\n\nThe Taskmaster appears in Marvel Vs Capcom: Fate of Two Worlds #1 (2011) based on his appearance in the Marvel vs Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds video game.

Germany and Italy [17]\n\n\nBeginnings\nRegional tournaments for national teams existed before the advent of a truly pan-European competition Starting in 1883, the British Home Championship was an annual competition contested between the United Kingdom's four national teams, England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland Until these national teams entered the FIFA World Cup in 1950, it was the most important international tournament these nations competed in Similarly, from 1927 until 1960, the Central European International Cup was held six times It brought together the national teams of Austria, Hungary, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, and Yugoslavia The idea for a pan-European football tournament was first proposed by the French Football Federation's secretary-general Henri Delaunay in 1927, but it was not until 1958 that the tournament was started, three years after Delaunay's death [12] In honour of Delaunay, the trophy awarded to the champions is named after him [13] The 1960 tournament, held in France, had four teams competing in the finals out of 17 that entered the competition [14] It was won by the Soviet Union, beating Yugoslavia 2–1 in a tense final in Paris [15] Spain withdrew from its quarter-final match against the Soviet Union because of two political protests [16] Of the 17 teams that entered the qualifying tournament, notable absentees were England, the Netherlands, West Germany and Italy [17]\n\n\nExpansion to 8 teams\nThe competition was expanded to eight teams in the 1980 tournament, again hosted by Italy It involved a group stage, with the winners of the groups going on to contest the final, and the runners-up playing in the third place play-off [32] West Germany won their second European title by beating Belgium 2–1, with two goals scored by Horst Hrubesch at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome [33] Horst Hrubesch scored early in the first half before René Vandereycken equalised for Belgium with a penalty in the second half With two minutes remaining, Hrubesch headed the winner for West Germany from a Karl-Heinz Rummenigge corner [34]\n\n\nExpansion to 16 teams\nEngland hosted UEFA Euro 1996, the first tournament to use the nomenclature \"Euro  [year]\" and would see the number of teams taking part double to 16 [46] The hosts, in a replay of the 1990 FIFA World Cup semi-final, were knocked out on penalties by Germany [47] The surprise team of the tournament was the newly formed Czech Republic, participating on its first international competition following the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, which reached the final after beating Portugal and France in the knockout stage Germany would go on to win the final 2–1 thanks to the first golden goal ever in a major tournament, scored by Oliver Bierhoff five minutes into extra time [48] [49] This was Germany's first title as a unified nation.\n\n\nExpansion to 24 teams\nIn 2007, the Football Association of Ireland and Scottish Football Association proposed the expansion of the tournament, which was later confirmed by the UEFA Executive Committee in September 2008 [64] [65] Out of the 54 member associations of UEFA, only three, including England and Germany, opposed the expansion [66] On 28 May 2010, UEFA announced that UEFA Euro 2016 would be hosted by France France beat bids of Turkey (7–6 in voting in the second voting round) and Italy, which had the fewest votes in the first voting round [67] Euro 2016 was the first to have 24 teams in the finals [68] This was the third time France have hosted the competition Portugal, which qualified for the knock-out phase despite finishing third in its group, went on to win the championship by defeating heavily favoured host team France 1–0 in the Final, thanks to a goal from Eder in the 109th minute Cristiano Ronaldo, Portugal's world-renowned striker, came out of the game due to injury in the 25th minute This was the first time Portugal won a major tournament.\n\n\nTrophy\nThe Henri Delaunay Trophy, which is awarded to the winner of the European Championship, [80] is named in honour of Henri Delaunay, the first General Secretary of UEFA, who came up with the idea of a European championship but died five years before the first tournament in 1960 His son Pierre was in charge of creating the trophy [81] Since the first tournament it has been awarded to the winning team for them to keep for four years, until the next tournament This trophy bore the words Coupe d'Europe (\"European Cup\"), Coupe Henri Delaunay (\"Henri Delaunay Cup\"), and Championnat d'Europe (\"European Championship\") on the front and a juggling boy on the back.\n\n\nFormat\nBefore 1980, only four teams qualified for the final tournament From 1980, eight teams competed In 1996 the tournament expanded to 16 teams, since it was easier for European nations to qualify for the World Cup than their own continental championship; 14 of the 24 teams at the 1982, 1986 and 1990 World Cups had been European, whereas the European Championship finals still involved only eight teams.\n\n\nThe competition\nBefore 1980, only four teams qualified for the final tournament From 1980, eight teams

spots or win a play-off After this, a team proceeds to the finals round in the host country, although hosts qualify for the tournament automatically.\n\n\nFinal tournament\nSixteen teams progressed to the final tournament for the 2012 tournament They were joint hosts Poland and Ukraine, the winners and the highest ranked second-placed team from the nine qualifying groups as well as the winners of four play-off matches between the runners-up of the other groups These sixteen teams were divided equally into four groups, A, B, C and D, each consisting of four teams The groups were drawn up by the UEFA administration, again using seeding The seeded teams being the host nations, the reigning champions, should they qualify, and those with the best points per game coefficients over the qualifying phase of the tournament and the previous World Cup qualifying Other finalists were assigned to by means of a draw, using coefficients as a basis.\n\n\nResults\nNotes\n\n\nSummary\nThere are currently

The series also features a group of male students known as the Specialists, who are the Winx fairies' boyfriends and are trained to fight against evil.\n\n**Premise**\n\nThe series follows the adventures of the Winx fairies as they attend Alfea College, where they learn to master their magical powers and battle against evil forces. The main male characters are the Specialists, a group of students at the Red Fountain school who are trained to fight against evil.

The first stage in the production of an episode is developing its script, a process that can last 5-6 months. When the series began production, the writers were based entirely in Italy. After Viacom became a co-owner of Rainbow in 2011, Rainbow's group of 30 writers began collaborating with teams in both Italy and the United States. The international coordination, which has continued through 2019, intends to make scenarios depicted in the program multicultural and accessible to viewers from different countries.\n\n**Development**\n\nThe series was created by Iginio Straffi, who was inspired by the concept of a \"sort of 'Oxford-Cambridge rivalry' in a magical dimension.\" Straffi drew his inspiration from Japanese manga and the comics of Sergio Bonelli.

even talk about boys there I think this removes something essential.\" [85] The series last aired on The CW (as part of The CW4Kids) before 4Kids' broadcast agreement was permanently revoked by Rainbow in 2009 [24]\n\n\nReception\nUpon its debut, Winx Club was a ratings success During its first season in 2004, the series became one of the highest-rated programs on Rai 2 with an average audience share of 17% [25] Among viewers 4–14 years old, the average share was 45% [25] In France and Belgium, the season reached a 56% share among 10 to 14-year-olds [86] According to Rai in 2009, the gender mix of Winx Club's audience was nearly equal across the first three seasons; in the target demographic of 4–14 years of age, females represented only 3% more of the audience than males [87] The premiere of the fourth season set a record for an animated show's audience on Rai 2 with 500,000 viewers [88] In 2007, Iginio Straffi noted that there were lower ratings in English-speaking territories than in Europe at the time, which he surmised was due to cultural differences [89]\n\n\nRatings\nUpon its debut, Winx Club was a ratings success During its first season in 2004, the series

Times article, Bocconi University professor Paola Dubini stated that the themes and characters of Winx Club appealed to both the target audience and their parents Dubini wrote that the fairies' \"defined and different personalities\" made them relatable to viewers [94] Common Sense Media reviewer Tara Swords gave the show a three-star review, calling it \"an imaginative story with bold, take-charge heroines\" while also arguing that the show is hindered by its design elements [95]\n\n\nCultural impact\nWinx Club has been popular at fan conventions For example, in 2012 and 2013, the

Rainbow of copying the Winx Club concept from its W.I.T.C.H comic book, [114] which was published over a year after production on Winx Club began [115] Disney applied for an injunction order to halt the further release of the Winx Club series and comic magazine; to declare the Winx Club trademark invalid; and to seize the periodical and film material bearing the allegedly infringing Winx Club name [114] Rainbow won the case against Disney, and the judge declared there were no confusing similarities between the two [114] Straffi mentioned that the Winx Club pilot entered production by 2000, while the W.I.T.C.H comic was not released until May 2001 [115] [116] On 2 August 2004, [117] all of Disney's infringement claims were rejected by the Tribunale di Bologna's Specialized Commercial

list of organ composers is a vast and diverse collection of musicians who have written music for the organ, a keyboard instrument with a rich history dating back to the Middle Ages. From the early Renaissance to the present day, organ composers have been creating music that has captivated audiences around the world. This article provides an overview of the history of organ music and a list of notable organ composers from various countries and periods.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe organ is one of the oldest keyboard instruments, with a history spanning over a thousand years. It has been a staple of Christian worship and has played a significant role in the development of Western classical music. Over the centuries, the organ has evolved from a simple, portable instrument to a complex, electrified machine capable of producing a wide range of tonal colors. Organ composers have been instrumental in shaping the instrument's sound and repertoire, creating music that is both beautiful and expressive.\n\n**Tablatures, Manuscripts, and Printed Music before 1580**\n\nDuring the early days of the organ, music was notated using tablature, a system of symbols and markings that indicated the fingerings and phrasings of a piece. Many of these tablatures have been lost over time, but some have been preserved in manuscripts and printed music collections. These early sources provide valuable insights into the development of organ music and the techniques of early organ composers.\n\n### Germany\n\n* Hans Leo Haßler (1564-1612): A German organist and composer who wrote music for the organ and harpsichord.\n* Michael Praetorius (1571-1621): A German composer and organist who wrote music for the organ and other instruments.\n* Georg Böhm (1661-1733): A German organist and composer who wrote music for the organ and harpsichord.\n\n### Argentina\n\n* Note: There are no notable organ composers from Argentina during this period.\n\n### Australia\n\n* Note: There are no notable organ composers from Australia during this period.\n\n### Austria\n\n* Note: Many Austrian composers were active during this period, but their music was not specifically written for the organ.\n\n### Belgium\n\n* Note: Many Belgian composers were active during this period, but their music was not specifically written for the organ.\n\n### Brazil\n\n* Note: There are no notable organ composers from Brazil during this period.\n\n### Canada\n\n* Note: There are no notable organ composers from Canada during this period.\n\n### Chile\n\n* Note: There are no notable organ composers from Chile during this period.\n\n### China\n\n* Note: There are no notable organ composers from China during this period.\n\n### Croatia\n\n* Note: There are no notable organ composers from Croatia during this period.\n\n### Cuba\n\n* Note: There are no notable organ composers from Cuba during this period.\n\n### Czech Republic (Bohemia)\n\n* Jakub Jan Ryba (1765-1815): A Czech composer and organist who wrote music for the organ and other instruments.\n\n### Denmark\n\n* Note: There are no notable organ composers from Denmark during this period.\n\n### Estonia\n\n* Note: There are no notable organ composers from Estonia during this period.\n\n## Romantic Era\n\nThe Romantic era saw a significant shift in the style and sound of organ music.

Republicans and other critics began using the term \"border czar\" to tie Harris to the Mexico–United States border crisis, including in a July 2024 House resolution, despite her having no authority over the border itself [217] [218] [219] [220] [221]\n\n\nForeign policy\nHarris met with French president Emmanuel Macron in November 2021 to strengthen ties after the contentious cancellation of a

her hometown of Oakland, California, on January 27, according to a police estimate [159]\n\n\nVice presidential campaign\nIn May 2019, senior members of the Congressional Black Caucus endorsed the idea of a Biden–Harris ticket [175] In late February 2020, Biden won a landslide victory in the 2020 South Carolina Democratic primary with the endorsement of House whip Jim Clyburn, with more victories on Super Tuesday In early March, Clyburn suggested Biden choose a black woman as a running mate, saying, \"African American women needed to be rewarded for their loyalty\" [176] In March,

acknowledged non-European ancestry to become president or vice president [c]\n\n\nSenate presidency\nWhen Harris took office the 117th Congress's Senate was divided 50–50 between Republicans and Democrats; [193] this meant that she was often called upon to exercise her power to cast tie-breaking votes as president of the Senate Harris cast her first two tie-breaking votes on February 5 In February and March, Harris's tie-breaking votes were required to pass the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 stimulus package Biden proposed, since no Senate Republicans voted for it [194] [195] On July

effort [208] Multiple news organizations at the time described Harris as a \"border czar\", [209] [210] [211] though Harris rejected the title and never actually held it [212] [213] [214] [215] [216] Republicans and other critics began using the term \"border czar\" to tie Harris to the Mexico–United States border crisis, including in a July 2024 House resolution, despite her having no authority over the border itself [217] [218] [219] [220] [221]\n\n\nForeign policy\nHarris met with French president Emmanuel Macron in November 2021 to strengthen ties after the contentious cancellation of a submarine program [225] Another meeting was held in November 2022 during Macron's visit to the U.S., resulting in an agreement to strengthen U.S.–France space cooperation across civil, commercial, and national security sectors [226]\n\n\n2024 presidential campaign\nOn July 21, 2024, incumbent president and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden suspended his campaign for reelection in 2024 and

[236] In the first 24 hours of her candidacy, her campaign raised $81 million in small-dollar donations, the highest single-day total of any presidential candidate in history [237] If elected, Harris would be the first female and first Asian-American president of the United States, and the second African-American president, after Obama [238] By August 5, Harris had officially secured the nomination via a virtual roll call of delegates [239] [240] [241] The next day, she announced Minnesota governor Tim Walz as her vice presidential running mate [242]\nOn August 22, 2024, the fourth day of the Democratic National Convention, Harris officially accepted the Democratic nomination for president [243] Harris participated in a debate with Trump on September 10; it was widely reported

legislation to address climate change [248] [249] [94] On immigration, she supports an earned pathway to citizenship and increases in border security, as well as addressing the root causes of illegal immigration by means of the RCS program [250] [251]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn the 1990s, Harris dated Willie Brown, Speaker of the California Assembly (1980–1995) and then Mayor of San Francisco (1996–2004) [28] In 2001, she briefly dated talk show host Montel Williams [256]\n\n\nPublic image\nThough the public had an unfavorable view of Harris as vice president, setting a record low, [273] her public image improved after Biden withdrew his candidacy for reelection Notably, her approval rating rose 13% among Democrats [274]\n\nPublications\nHarris has written two nonfiction books and one children's book.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\nOfficial\n\n\nOther\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is the eldest child of Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, and his wife, Sophie, Countess of Wessex. James was born on 17 December 2007, at 16:20 GMT, at Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey, England. His birth was a significant event in the British royal family, as it marked the first time a member of the royal family had been born in a hospital since 1955.\n\n**Infancy**\n\nJames was born by caesarean section, a decision made by his parents due to concerns about the health of his mother. His father, Prince Edward, is the youngest child of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. His mother, Sophie, Countess of Wessex, worked in public relations before joining the royal family through her marriage in 1999. James's full name, James Alexander Philip Theo, was announced on 21 December 2007, just four days after his birth.\n\n**Education**\n\nJames attended Eagle House School, a coeducational preparatory school near Sandhurst, Berkshire, from 2011 to 2021. During his time at Eagle House, James was reportedly a keen student and developed a strong interest in sports, particularly hockey and cricket. In 2021, James joined Radley College, a private boarding school in Oxfordshire, where he is currently a student. Radley College is a well-established institution with a strong reputation for academic excellence and extracurricular activities. James's education is being overseen by his parents, who are committed to ensuring that he receives a well-rounded education that prepares him for his future role in the royal family.\n\n**Official Appearances**\n\nJames made his first official appearance at the Trooping the Colour ceremony in 2016, where he rode in the carriage procession alongside his parents and other members of the royal family. Since then, James has appeared at several official events, including the 2022 Trooping the Colour ceremony. These appearances have allowed James to become more familiar with the duties and responsibilities of a member of the royal family and to develop his skills in interacting with the public.\n\n**Titles, Styles, and Honours**\n\nJames was accorded the courtesy title of Viscount Severn at birth, as heir apparent to his father's earldom. The title Viscount Severn alludes to the Welsh ancestry of Sophie's family, which has a long history of connections to the royal family. James's title reflects his position as a member of the royal family and his potential future role as a working royal.\n\n**Honours and Decorations**\n\nIn June 2008, a lake in the Canadian province of Manitoba was named Lake James in recognition of Prince Edward's visit to the province. James's sister, Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor, was similarly honoured by the naming of Lake Louise in the same province. These honours reflect the close relationship between the British royal family and the Canadian government and people.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nJames, Viscount Severn, is a member of the British royal family with a promising future ahead of him. As a member of the royal family, James has a unique position in society and a role to play in promoting the interests of the UK and the Commonwealth. Through his education and official appearances, James is developing the skills and knowledge necessary to fulfill his duties as a member of the royal family. As he grows and matures, James will become an increasingly important figure in the British royal family and a respected member of society.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"James_Mountbatten-Windsor,_Viscount_Severn\" following this outline:\n\n\nInfancy\nJames was born on 17 December 2007 at 16:20 GMT at Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey by caesarean section [1] [2] His father Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh, is the youngest child of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh His mother Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh, worked in public relations before joining the royal family through her marriage in 1999 His full name, James Alexander Philip Theo, was announced on 21 December [3]\n\n\nEducation\nJames attended Eagle House School, a coeducational preparatory school near Sandhurst, Berkshire from 2011 to 2021, before joining the private Radley College in Oxfordshire [7]\n\n\nOfficial appearances\nJames made his first official appearance in the carriage procession at Trooping the Colour in 2016 [8] and also appeared at the 2022 Trooping the Colour [9]\n\n\nTitles, styles, and honours\nThe title Viscount Severn alludes to the Welsh ancestry of Sophie's family [19] James was accorded this courtesy title at birth, as heir apparent to his father's earldom [20]\n\n\nTitles and styles\nThe title Viscount Severn alludes to the Welsh ancestry of Sophie's family [19] James was accorded this courtesy title at birth, as heir apparent to his father's earldom [20]\n\n\nHonours and decorations\nIn June 2008, to recognise Prince Edward's visit to the Canadian province of Manitoba, a lake in the north of the province was called Lake James James's sister was similarly honoured by Lake Louise in the same province [29]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The party was founded in 2020 by Philip Proudfoot, an international development studies lecturer at the University of Sussex, and his colleague Evie McGovern, along with other former Labour Party activists who were disillusioned with the party's shift towards the center.\n\n**History**\n\nThe NIP was formed on 22 October 2020, with the aim of creating an independent state in the North of England, called Northumbria. The party's founders were inspired by the Scottish National Party's (SNP) campaign for an independent Scotland. Proudfoot, a former Labour Party activist from County Durham, was motivated by his desire to see the North of England taking control of its own destiny and unleashing its potential. He was also inspired by Andy Burnham's critical response to the Westminster government's support package for Greater Manchester during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nProudfoot has said that the geography of Northumbria would consist of Yorkshire, Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Tyne and Wear, Greater Manchester, County Durham, Northumberland, and Cheshire. Since 2022, the party has generally included the borough of High Peak in northern Derbyshire within it. The party has proposed York as a possible capital city, although it has also suggested having multiple capitals.\n\n**Policies**\n\nThe NIP's policies are centered around the idea of creating an independent state in the North of England. The party advocates for the devolution of power from Westminster to the North of England, which would allow the region to make its own decisions on issues such as healthcare, education, and transportation. The party also wants to see the creation of a new economic model for the North of England, which would prioritize local businesses and industry over multinational corporations.\n\nThe NIP's policies are also influenced by the party's commitment to social justice and equality. The party wants to see an end to poverty and inequality in the North of England, and it advocates for a more progressive tax system that would see the wealthy contributing more to the economy. The party also wants to see an increase in public services, including education, healthcare, and social care.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe NIP has received a mixed response from politicians and commentators. Some have welcomed the party's commitment to devolution and social justice, while others have questioned the party's chances of success. Stewart Arnold, a journalist with The Yorkshire Post, has argued that the party's presence will be \"good for democracy\" as it will challenge the two main parties to present suitable plans that allow Yorkshire and the rest of the North to take control of its own destiny and unleash its potential.\n\nHowever, others have been more skeptical. Alex Niven, a journalist with The Guardian, has argued that the NIP's chances of success are slim due to the \"archaic first-past-the-post system\" that makes it difficult for smaller parties to establish a foothold in Westminster. Niven has also questioned the party's ability to make a significant impact, suggesting that the party may be more of a \"token\" party that fails to deliver.\n\n**Elections**\n\nThe NIP has contested several elections since its formation, including parliamentary by-elections and local elections. In the 2021 Hartlepool by-election, the party selected Thelma Walker, a former Labour MP, as its candidate. However, the party was not registered with the Electoral Commission before the candidate nomination deadline, and Walker appeared on the ballot as an independent. Walker received 250 votes, coming eighth with 0.84% of the vote and losing her deposit.\n\nThe party has also contested several local elections, including the 2021 local elections in Sefton and Salford, and the 2022 local elections in Barnsley, Leeds, Newcastle upon Tyne, Sefton, Sheffield, and Wirral. However, the party has not yet won any seats.\n\n**Parliamentary by-elections**\n\nThe NIP has contested several parliamentary by-elections since its formation.

However, none of these candidates were elected.\n\n**2022 local elections**\n\nThe NIP ran eight candidates in the 2022 local elections in Barnsley, Leeds, Newcastle upon Tyne, Sefton, Sheffield, and Wirral.

However, neither of these candidates were elected.\n\n**2024 local and general elections**\n\nThe party did not stand any candidates in the 2024 local elections or the 2024 general election.\n\n**See also**\n\nThe Northern Independence Party is part of a broader movement of parties and organizations that advocate for the independence of the North of England.

{"title": "Donda", "content": "\nBackground\nDuring a conversation with French fashion designer Michèle Lamy in an Instagram Live stream on May 25, 2020, American cinematographer Arthur Jafa revealed that he was working on video material with West for a single from his forthcoming album, titled God's Country [1] On July 21, West confirmed the album title had been changed to Donda in honor of his mother, after whom he had also named his creative company [2] [3] The album had its name briefly changed to Donda: With Child, which was later reversed [4] West announced a release date of July 24, and posted a track listing for the album In the following days, West continued to post track listings, only to subsequently delete them [2] Ultimately, the album missed its planned release date [5] In September 2020, West sent out a series of tweets about his relationship with Universal Music, mostly addressing his desire to buy his master recordings back from them [6] The rapper asserted that these efforts were obstructed by his signed contracts, succeeding this by tweeting multiple images that supposedly showed the contracts [6]\n\n\nRecording\nThe recording sessions began a month after Jesus Is King was released [14] Producer BoogzDaBeast recalled that he was called in to Wyoming with West telling him \"Man we're going back in, we're about to do a new album Let's keep this going.\" [14] BoogzDaBeast came to Wyoming with 166 beats, which the producer clarified that they were mostly unfinished ideas [14] Of those 166 ideas, West freestyled over 99 of them in what the producer calls \"That One Night in Wyoming\" Songs such as \"Wash Us in the Blood\"–which was originally set for release on Donda in 2020, but was left off the final album–and \"Lord I Need You\" were originally conceived during said session [15]\n\n\nSongs\nThe album's opening track, \"Donda Chant\", consists of Syleena Johnson chanting Donda West's forename repeatedly for nearly a minute It has been theorized by fans that the rhythm represents that of Donda West's heart beating [82] [63] [76] \"Jail\" follows and is the first full track, featuring Kanye West and Jay-Z combining metaphors about crime with details of marriage and sin [63] [65] The track is a fusion of \"maximalist hip hop\", [69] pop, and alternative rock, [74] incorporating auto-tuned vocals and arena rock guitar riffs [73] [64] [83] The song contains almost no drums, [84] until the last segment of the track brings a \"brief, stilted drum pattern\", [73] described as industrial percussion [85] \"God Breathed\" has an abrasive, industrial sound that was compared to Yeezus, [73] [63] and features West offering redemption, reaffirming his trust in God before a wordless choir performs the outro [66] [67] [76] Playboi Carti and fellow rapper Fivio Foreign attempt to find a balance between faith in themselves and faith in God within their verses on \"Off the Grid\", [63] [86] later being followed by West providing a revelation of his religious mission statement in the closing verse and at one point, he dubs God \"my bestie\" [65] [71] The song has an intense drill beat, featuring a \"melodically complex\" bassline and a \"sustained choir\" [66] \"Hurricane\" is an R&B song, [64] with layered organs and processed choir vocals that are cut akin to a sample [84] [87] West touches on personal issues such as his breakup with Kardashian and his house, while the hook sees the Weeknd exude confidence and Lil Baby provides a mournful performance [64] [78] [83] \"Praise God\" contains a vocal sample of Donda West proclaiming, \"Even if you are not ready for the day, it cannot always be night.\" [80] Lyrically, the song features Baby Keem mixing \"worship with the dark carnality of the mosh pit\" and Kanye West connecting his issues to God's mysterious behavior [76] [83] \"Jonah\" sees him rapping about his relationship with God, [78] alongside fellow rappers Vory and Lil Durk opening up about their pain of losing friends and family members, respectively [64] [83]\n\n\nMusic and lyrics\nDonda covers the stylistic groundwork of West's previous albums; [63] [64] it has been described as a hip hop, [65] [66] gospel, [67] [68] progressive rap, [66] and pop record, [69] [70] while the album also includes elements of trap, drill, boom bap, [71] hip house, and rock [72] Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Mikael Wood described it as a blend of Yeezus's rough industrial hip hop, the \"church-organ gospel\" of West's previous studio album Jesus Is King (2019), the \"gothic swagger\" of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010), and the \"bleeping\" electropop of 808s & Heartbreak (2008) [64] Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic perceived that \"stylistic innovation has driven West's career\" continuously, but he possibly \"conceives of Donda as the album of his life—a capstone, an anthology\" [63] However, the album is unusual in his catalog due to its lack of drums, outside of a light amount of snares and occasional synth basses that imitate rhythm sections [73] [47] Donda's integration of gospel music is more subtle than that of its predecessor, [74] [75] instead favoring the usage of trap beats and Auto-Tune [68] [76] At Pitchfork, Dylan Green noted the production \"jumps\" from trap and drill to boom-bap and gospel, invoking GOOD Music's compilation album Cruel Summer (2012) [71]\n\n\nSongs\nThe album's opening track, \"Donda Chant\", consists of Syleena Johnson chanting Donda West's forename repeatedly for nearly a minute It has been theorized by fans that

rapper Fivio Foreign attempt to find a balance between faith in themselves and faith in God within their verses on \"Off the Grid\", [63] [86] later being followed by West providing a revelation of his religious mission statement in the closing verse and at one point, he dubs God \"my bestie\" [65] [71] The song has an intense drill beat, featuring a \"melodically complex\" bassline and a \"sustained choir\" [66] \"Hurricane\" is an R&B song, [64] with layered organs and processed choir vocals that are cut akin to a sample [84] [87] West touches on personal issues such as his breakup with Kardashian and his house, while the hook sees the Weeknd exude confidence and Lil Baby provides a mournful performance [64] [78] [83] \"Praise God\" contains a vocal sample of Donda West

connecting his issues to God's mysterious behavior [76] [83] \"Jonah\" sees him rapping about his relationship with God, [78] alongside fellow rappers Vory and Lil Durk opening up about their pain of losing friends and family members, respectively [64] [83]\n\n\nRelease and promotion\nOn June 26, 2020, West unveiled a collaboration between his fashion company Yeezy and clothing retailer Gap, and also launched the #WestDayEver promotional campaign on Twitter that accompanied announcements of different projects [91] One of the projects was a music video for the track \"Wash Us in the Blood\" that features fellow rapper Travis Scott, directed by Jafa; the video was released simultaneously with the song on June 30, following a teaser in which West officially announced the album's title as

neither of them made the final cut [98] [73]\n\n\nCover art\nOn July 25, 2020, West tweeted out an album cover, [133] showing an infrared scheme of orange and red mirroring the shape of the people, sun, and moon in the sky, backed by green mountains alongside purple and white clouds designed by Pierre-Louis Auvray [92] In the lead up to the first Donda listening event on July 22, 2021, a possible replacement cover was used as the promo artwork The cover was an adaptation of a Louise Bourgeois gouache painting that had been created in 2007, the same year as Donda West's death, and included in Bourgeois' series Les têtes bleues et les femmes rouges (2015) [134] [135] In the painting, a woman is shown in monochromatic red and a matching ponytail flows behind her, while a fertility idol is also partially present [134] [135] After Kanye West posted numerous potential covers, a plain black square was ultimately used as the artwork for the album [136]\n\n\nStreaming performance and updates\nIn its first day of release, Donda earned the second-biggest global Spotify debut for album streams ever, with nearly 100 million streams, and broke the record for the biggest first day streams of 2021 on the service that was set by Olivia Rodrigo's Sour [137] [138] The album also set a new record by reaching number one on Apple Music's top albums chart in 152 countries in its first day, and earned the third-biggest first day debut streams for an album Donda broke the 2021 record for the most-streamed album in one day on Apple Music, while 19 of the top-20 tracks on the service's Top 100 Global songs chart were from the album [139] Donda amassed 60 million first day streams in the United States on Apple, setting a streaming record for 2021 in the country [140] After eight days of streaming, it had reached around 423 million on-demand audio streams in the US [141] 25 of the tracks debuted with the top-40 of Spotify's U.S chart, with 10 of them occupying the top-10 [137] The album's 2021 record for first day Spotify streams was broken by Certified Lover Boy, which also surpassed its eight-day total of US on-demand audio streams within three days, amassing over 430 million streams [141] [142] By October 26, the former had amassed over a billion streams on Spotify, becoming West's fastest album to achieve this milestone [143]\n\n\nDonda Stem Player\nOn August 25, 2021, West announced the Donda Stem Player via his website, a standalone music player allowing users to remix the album's songs using their stems [145] [146] [147] Users are also given the ability to control vocals, drums, bass, and samples, isolate parts, and add effects [145] [146] [148] The player was announced as being set to be released by West's brand Yeezy Tech in collaboration with Kano

Vory, KayCyy, Westside Gunn, Conway the Machine, Jay Electronica, Pop Smoke, the Sunday Service Choir, DaBaby, Marilyn Manson, and the Weeknd [161] [162] [163] West had updated Donda after each listening event like he did with his seventh studio album The Life of Pablo (2016), changing content such as the features on songs [164] Speaking with Apple Music's Zane Lowe, Dean depicted the process as \"interesting\" and \"gruelling\", remembering \"lots of hours\" and changes, from which the album \"came out great\" He elaborated by explaining that \"each listening party was like a test\" of sorts, with West succeeding each one by taking all \"the information he got from everyone, including online reviews  [and] personal friends' reviews\", then \"digest [ing] it all\" in a manner to \"adjust\" Donda \"the way\" he wanted [165]\n\n\nCritical reception\nDonda received mixed reviews from music critics [196] At Metacritic, the album received an weighted mean score of 53, based on 19 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\" [194] Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave it a 5.4 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus [193]\n\n\nCriticism of guest artists\nThe revelation of DaBaby and Marilyn Manson as guest artists during Donda's August 26 listening event was met with intense disapproval from critics due to the respective allegations of homophobia and sexual abuse against them [115] [197] According to Jem Aswad of Variety, \"West was widely accused of trolling the public, among other things, after  [the] event.\" [114] In response, as Ellen Durney of BuzzFeed News wrote, \"some fans\" suggested that the inclusion of DaBaby and Manson might have been West's \"attempt at commentary on 'cancel culture'\", [198] and Consequence writer Alex Young provided a similar presumption [199] West defended DaBaby's presence, recalling him being \"the only person who said he would vote for me in public\" [115] An unspecified source told People about West's decision to work with the rapper and Marilyn Manson: \"He knows that having controversial figures around will be provocative and will get people to talking.\" The source continued by opening up that West knows \"people are going to be upset\" and he will experience \"backlash\", and is also aware \"people are talking about it today when they wouldn't have been otherwise\" [115] [200] [201]\n\n\nAccolades\nOn Complex's list of the best albums of 2021, Donda was placed sixth [203] Similarly, Time ranked the album at number seven on their list for the year [204] On Caramanica's list of the best albums of 2021, the deluxe edition was placed at number 10 Caramanica said it \"lives at the intersection\" of West's Yeezus and Jesus eras, commenting that the \"scabrous, churning production that sets a chaotic mood\" is accompanied by \"moments of intense searching, gasps for air amid the unrest\" [205] Associated Press listed Donda as among the top 10 albums of the year [206] Billboard placed it at number 39 on their \"The 50 Best Albums of 2021: Staff List\", with Heran Mamo declaring that West confronts his inner demons and \"yearns for mercy without two key women\" in his mother and Kardashian [207]\n\n\nCommercial performance\nDonda debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 after a five-day period of tracking, with 309,000 album-equivalent units that consisted of 272,000 streaming-equivalent album units, 37,000 pure album sales, and less than 1,000 track-equivalent units [209] [210] The album-equivalent units set a record for the highest amount of 2021, exceeding the 295,000 units amassed by Olivia Rodrigo's Sour Kanye West scored his 10th chart-topper on the Billboard 200 with the album, making him one of seven artists to have gathered this amount of number-ones on the chart It also marked West's 10th consecutive album to debut at the summit, tying him with Eminem's record [209] It also reached the summit of the US Top Christian Albums and Top Gospel Albums charts, becoming West's second album to top the two charts and achieving the biggest unit week for both [211] The album entered atop the US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, on which it was the rapper's 10th chart-topper [212] 23 of Donda's tracks debuted on the Billboard Hot 100, leading to West joining Drake as one of the two artists to have 23 or more songs chart simultaneously This also increased West's Hot 100 entries to 133, the fifth most of any act, a ranking he attained for top-40 hits as well by having scored 68 \"Hurricane\" was the highest charting track, reaching number six and becoming West's 19th top-20 hit [120] The 23 tracks took up the top-23 spots on both the US Christian Songs and Gospel Songs charts, exceeding West's record of all top-10 positions on the former chart and the top-11 on the latter [211] As a result of the album and its tracks, West went up from number 67 to the top position on the Billboard Artist 100, giving him his third week atop the

It was initially titled God's Country, but was changed to Donda in honor of West's mother, Donda West. The album was produced by West and features guest appearances from various artists, including Jay-Z, Kid Cudi, and The Weeknd. Donda received mixed reviews from music critics, but was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart and being certified platinum by the RIAA.\n\n# Background\n\nDuring a conversation with French fashion designer Michèle Lamy in an Instagram Live stream on May 25, 2020, American cinematographer Arthur Jafa revealed that he was working on video material with West for a single from his forthcoming album, titled God's Country. On July 21, West confirmed the album title had been changed to Donda in honor of his mother, after whom he had also named his creative company. The album had its name briefly changed to Donda: With Child, which was later reversed. West announced a release date of July 24, and posted a track listing for the album. In the following days, West continued to post track listings, only to subsequently delete them. Ultimately, the album missed its planned release date.\n\n# Recording\n\nThe recording sessions began a month after Jesus Is King was released. Producer BoogzDaBeast recalled that he was called in to Wyoming with West telling him \"Man we're going back in, we're about to do a new album Let's keep this going.\" BoogzDaBeast came to Wyoming with 166 beats, which the producer clarified that they were mostly unfinished ideas. Of those 166 ideas, West freestyled over 99 of them in what the producer calls \"That One Night in Wyoming\" Songs such as \"Wash Us in the Blood\"–which was originally set for release on Donda in 2020, but was left off the final album–and \"Lord I Need You\" were originally conceived during said session.\n\n# Songs\n\nThe album's opening track, \"Donda Chant\", consists of Syleena Johnson chanting Donda West's forename repeatedly for nearly a minute. It has been theorized by fans that the rhythm represents that of Donda West's heart beating. \"Jail\" follows and is the first full track, featuring Kanye West and Jay-Z combining metaphors about crime with details of marriage and sin. The track is a fusion of \"maximalist hip hop\", pop, and alternative rock, incorporating auto-tuned vocals and arena rock guitar riffs. The song contains almost no drums, until the last segment of the track brings a \"brief, stilted drum pattern\", described as industrial percussion. \"God Breathed\" has an abrasive, industrial sound that was compared to Yeezus, and features West offering redemption, reaffirming his trust in God before a wordless choir performs the outro.\n\n# Music and lyrics\n\nDonda covers the stylistic groundwork of West's previous albums; it has been described as a hip hop, gospel, progressive rap, and pop record, while the album also includes elements of trap, drill, boom bap, hip house, and rock. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Mikael Wood described it as a blend of Yeezus's rough industrial hip hop, the \"church-organ gospel\" of West's previous studio album Jesus Is King (2019), the \"gothic swagger\" of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010), and the \"bleeping\" electropop of 808s & Heartbreak (2008). Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic perceived that \"stylistic innovation has driven West's career\" continuously, but he possibly \"conceives of Donda as the album of his life—a capstone, an anthology\". However, the album is unusual in his catalog due to its lack of drums, outside of a light amount of snares and occasional synth basses that imitate rhythm sections. Donda's integration of gospel music is more subtle than that of its predecessor, instead favoring the usage of trap beats and Auto-Tune.\n\n# Release and promotion\n\nOn June 26, 2020, West unveiled a collaboration between his fashion company Yeezy and clothing retailer Gap, and also launched the #WestDayEver promotional campaign on Twitter that accompanied announcements of different projects. One of the projects was a music video for the track \"Wash Us in the Blood\" that features fellow rapper Travis Scott, directed by Jafa; the video was released simultaneously with the song on June 30, following a teaser in which West officially announced the album's title as God's Country.

a conversation with French fashion designer Michèle Lamy in an Instagram Live stream on May 25, 2020, American cinematographer Arthur Jafa revealed that he was working on video material with West for a single from his forthcoming album, titled God's Country [1] On July 21, West confirmed the album title had been changed to Donda in honor of his mother, after whom he had also named his creative company [2] [3] The album had its name briefly changed to Donda: With Child, which was later reversed [4] West announced a release date of July 24, and posted a track listing for the album In the following days, West continued to post track listings, only to subsequently delete them [2] Ultimately, the album missed its planned release date [5] In September 2020, West sent out a series of tweets about his relationship with Universal Music, mostly addressing his desire to buy his master recordings back from them [6] The rapper asserted that these efforts were obstructed by his signed contracts, succeeding this by tweeting multiple images that supposedly showed the contracts [6]\n\n\nRecording\nThe recording sessions began a month after Jesus Is King was released [14] Producer BoogzDaBeast recalled that he was called in to Wyoming with West telling him \"Man we're going back in, we're about to do a new album Let's keep this going.\" [14] BoogzDaBeast came to Wyoming with 166 beats, which the producer clarified that they were mostly unfinished ideas [14] Of those 166 ideas, West freestyled over 99 of them in what the producer calls \"That One Night in Wyoming\" Songs such as \"Wash Us in the Blood\"–which was originally set for release on Donda in 2020, but was left off the final album–and \"Lord I Need You\" were originally conceived during said session [15]\n\n\nSongs\nThe album's opening track, \"Donda Chant\", consists of Syleena Johnson chanting Donda West's forename repeatedly for nearly a minute It has been theorized by fans that the rhythm represents that of Donda West's heart beating [82] [63] [76] \"Jail\" follows and is the first full track, featuring Kanye West and Jay-Z combining metaphors about crime with details of marriage and sin [63] [65] The track is a fusion of \"maximalist hip hop\", [69] pop, and alternative rock, [74] incorporating auto-tuned vocals and arena rock guitar riffs [73] [64] [83] The song contains almost no drums, [84] until the last segment of the track brings a \"brief, stilted drum pattern\", [73] described as industrial percussion [85] \"God Breathed\" has an abrasive, industrial sound that was compared to Yeezus, [73] [63] and features West offering redemption, reaffirming his trust in God before a wordless choir performs the outro [66] [67] [76] Playboi Carti and fellow rapper Fivio Foreign attempt to find a balance between faith in themselves and faith in God within their verses on \"Off the Grid\", [63] [86] later being followed by West providing a revelation of his religious mission statement in the closing verse and at one point, he dubs God \"my bestie\" [65] [71] The song has an intense drill beat, featuring a \"melodically complex\" bassline and a \"sustained choir\" [66] \"Hurricane\" is an R&B song, [64] with layered organs and processed choir vocals that are cut akin to a sample [84] [87] West touches on personal issues such as his breakup with Kardashian and his house, while the hook sees the Weeknd exude confidence and Lil Baby provides a mournful performance [64] [78] [83] \"Praise God\" contains a vocal sample of Donda West proclaiming, \"Even if you are not ready for the day, it cannot always be night.\" [80] Lyrically, the song features Baby Keem mixing \"worship with the dark carnality of the mosh pit\" and Kanye West connecting his issues to God's mysterious behavior [76] [83] \"Jonah\" sees him rapping about his relationship with God, [78] alongside fellow rappers Vory and Lil Durk opening up about their pain of losing friends and family members, respectively [64] [83]\n\n\nMusic and lyrics\nDonda covers the stylistic groundwork of West's previous albums; [63] [64] it has been described as a hip hop, [65] [66] gospel, [67] [68] progressive rap, [66] and pop record, [69] [70] while the album also includes elements of trap, drill, boom bap, [71] hip house, and rock [72] Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Mikael Wood described it as a blend of Yeezus's rough industrial hip hop, the \"church-organ gospel\" of West's previous studio album Jesus Is King (2019), the \"gothic swagger\" of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010), and the \"bleeping\" electropop of 808s & Heartbreak (2008) [64] Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic perceived that \"stylistic innovation has driven West's career\" continuously, but he possibly \"conceives of Donda as the album of his life—a capstone, an anthology\" [63] However, the album is unusual in his catalog due to its lack of drums, outside of a light amount of snares and occasional synth basses that imitate rhythm sections [73] [47] Donda's integration of gospel music is more subtle than that of its predecessor, [74] [75] instead favoring the usage of trap beats and Auto-Tune [68] [76] At Pitchfork, Dylan Green noted the production \"jumps\" from trap and drill to boom-bap and gospel, invoking GOOD Music's compilation album Cruel Summer (2012) [71]\n\n\nSongs\nThe album's opening track, \"Donda Chant\", consists of Syleena Johnson chanting Donda West's forename repeatedly for nearly a minute It has been theorized by fans that the rhythm represents that of Donda West's heart beating [82] [63] [76] \"Jail\" follows and is the first full track, featuring Kanye West and Jay-Z combining metaphors about crime with details of marriage and

God's mysterious behavior [76] [83] \"Jonah\" sees him rapping about his relationship with God, [78] alongside fellow rappers Vory and Lil Durk opening up about their pain of losing friends and family members, respectively [64] [83]\n\n\nRelease and promotion\nOn June 26, 2020, West unveiled a collaboration between his fashion company Yeezy and clothing retailer Gap, and also launched the #WestDayEver promotional campaign on Twitter that accompanied announcements of different projects [91] One of the projects was a music video for the track \"Wash Us in the Blood\" that features fellow rapper Travis Scott, directed by Jafa; the video was released simultaneously with the song on June 30, following a teaser in which West officially announced the album's title as God's Country [91] [92] The track was set to be included on Donda, but did not appear on the final track listing [93] [5] On July 13, 2020, Kanye shared a snippet on Twitter of a song titled \"Donda\", which featured his late mother Donda West reciting KRS-One's \"Sound of da Police\" (1993) and was accompanied by archival footage, including the Wests rapping together [94] The song was replaced with another track also titled \"Donda\" on the final track listing On September 26, 2020, West shared a 39-second snippet of the track \"Believe What I Say\" to Twitter [95] West later released a song entitled \"Nah Nah Nah\" on October 26, calling the song his 2020 presidential campaign's theme music; it includes him referencing his candidacy [96] On November 13, 2020, West released a remix of \"Nah Nah Nah\" that features fellow rappers DaBaby and 2 Chainz [97] After the original and remix were both removed from streaming services in the lead up to Donda's release, neither of them made the final cut [98] [73]\n\n\nCover art\nOn July 25, 2020, West tweeted out an album cover, [133] showing an infrared scheme of orange and red mirroring the shape of the people, sun, and moon in the sky, backed by green mountains alongside purple and white clouds designed by Pierre-Louis Auvray [92] In the lead up to the first Donda listening event on July 22, 2021, a possible replacement cover was used as the promo artwork The cover was an adaptation of a Louise Bourgeois gouache painting that had been created in 2007, the same year as Donda West's death, and included in Bourgeois' series Les têtes bleues et les femmes rouges (2015) [134] [135] In the painting, a woman is shown in monochromatic red and a matching ponytail flows behind her, while a fertility idol is also partially present [134] [135] After Kanye West posted numerous potential covers, a plain black square was ultimately used as the artwork for the album [136]\n\n\nStreaming performance and updates\nIn its first day of release, Donda earned the second-biggest global Spotify debut for album streams ever, with nearly 100 million streams, and broke the record for the biggest first day streams of 2021 on the service that was set by Olivia Rodrigo's Sour [137] [138] The album also set a new record by reaching number one on Apple Music's top albums chart in 152 countries in its first day, and earned the third-biggest first day debut streams for an album Donda broke the 2021 record for the most-streamed album in one day on Apple Music, while 19 of the top-20 tracks on the service's Top 100 Global songs chart were from the album [139] Donda amassed 60 million first day streams in the United States on Apple, setting a streaming record for 2021 in the country [140] After eight days of streaming, it had reached around 423 million on-demand audio streams in the US [141] 25 of the tracks debuted with the top-40 of Spotify's U.S chart, with 10 of them occupying the top-10 [137] The album's 2021 record for first day Spotify streams was broken by Certified Lover Boy, which also surpassed its eight-day total of US on-demand audio streams within three days, amassing over 430 million streams [141] [142] By October 26, the former had amassed over a billion streams on Spotify, becoming West's fastest album to achieve this milestone [143]\n\n\nDonda Stem Player\nOn August 25, 2021, West announced the Donda Stem Player via his website, a standalone music player allowing users to remix the album's songs using their stems [145] [146] [147] Users are also given the ability to control vocals, drums, bass, and samples, isolate parts, and add effects [145] [146] [148] The player was announced as being set to be released by West's brand Yeezy Tech in collaboration with Kano Computing and sold for $200 [146] [147] [149] On October 27, 2021, the Donda Stem Player was made available by West, with three extra songs being included The new songs are a censored edit of \"Life of the Party\", \"Up from the Ashes\", and an updated version of \"Never Abandon Your Family\" In addition, the player contains a version of \"Remote Control\" that re-adds Kid Cudi's original contribution [150] [151] On November 17, 2021, the Donda Stem Player website was updated to include downloadable stems for Jesus Is King On December 10, 2021, stems for \"Wash Us in the Blood\" were added in an update [152]\n\n\nDeluxe edition\nOn November 5, 2021, in an interview with N.O.R.E on Drink Champs, West announced that a deluxe version of Donda was set to be released, teasing a song called \"Let Go\" [154] [155] Eight days later, billboards advertising the deluxe edition appeared around Los Angeles [156] On November 14, 2021, Donda (Deluxe) was released to streaming services [48] Simultaneously, an explicit version of \"Life of the Party\" was released as a single from the deluxe edition [157] The song charted at number 13 on the US Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart [158] A 2xCD physical version of the deluxe edition was released on February 11, 2022 [159] A 4xLP deluxe gatefold version was released on vinyl on June 24, 2022 [160]\n\n\nListening events\nTo promote Donda prior to its release, West held a series of listening events During the album's events, guest appearances from various artists were revealed, including Lil Baby, Playboi Carti, Pusha T, Jay-Z, Lil Yachty, Vory, KayCyy, Westside Gunn, Conway the Machine, Jay Electronica, Pop Smoke, the Sunday Service Choir, DaBaby, Marilyn Manson, and the Weeknd [161] [162] [163] West had updated Donda after each listening event like he did with his seventh studio album The Life of Pablo (2016), changing content such as the features on songs [164] Speaking with Apple Music's Zane Lowe, Dean depicted the process as \"interesting\" and \"gruelling\", remembering \"lots of hours\" and changes, from which the album \"came out great\" He elaborated by explaining that \"each listening party was like a test\" of sorts, with West succeeding each one by taking all \"the information he got from everyone, including online reviews  [and] personal friends' reviews\", then \"digest [ing] it all\" in a manner to \"adjust\" Donda \"the way\" he wanted [165]\n\n\nCritical reception\nDonda received mixed reviews from music critics [196] At Metacritic, the album received an weighted mean score of 53, based on 19 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\" [194] Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave it a 5.4 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus [193]\n\n\nCriticism of guest artists\nThe revelation of DaBaby and Marilyn Manson as guest artists during Donda's August 26 listening event was met with intense disapproval from critics due to the respective allegations of homophobia and sexual abuse against them [115] [197] According to Jem Aswad of Variety, \"West was widely accused of trolling the public, among other things, after  [the] event.\" [114] In response, as Ellen Durney of BuzzFeed News wrote, \"some fans\" suggested that the inclusion of DaBaby and Manson might have been West's \"attempt at commentary on 'cancel culture'\", [198] and Consequence writer Alex Young provided a similar presumption [199] West defended DaBaby's presence, recalling him being \"the only person who said he would vote for me in public\" [115] An unspecified source told People about West's decision to work with the rapper and Marilyn Manson: \"He knows that having controversial figures around will be provocative and will get people to talking.\" The source continued by opening up that West knows \"people are going to be upset\" and he will experience \"backlash\", and is also aware \"people are talking about it today when they wouldn't have been otherwise\" [115] [200] [201]\n\n\nAccolades\nOn Complex's list of the best albums of 2021, Donda was placed sixth [203] Similarly, Time ranked the album at number seven on their list for the year [204] On Caramanica's list of the best albums of 2021, the deluxe edition was placed at number 10 Caramanica said it \"lives at the intersection\" of West's Yeezus and Jesus eras, commenting that the \"scabrous, churning production that sets a chaotic mood\" is accompanied by \"moments of intense searching, gasps for air amid the unrest\" [205] Associated Press listed Donda as among the top 10 albums of the year [206] Billboard placed it at number 39 on their \"The 50 Best Albums of 2021: Staff List\", with Heran Mamo declaring that West confronts his inner demons and \"yearns for mercy without two key women\" in his mother and Kardashian [207]\n\n\nCommercial performance\nDonda debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 after a five-day period of tracking, with 309,000 album-equivalent units that consisted of 272,000 streaming-equivalent album units, 37,000 pure album sales, and less than 1,000 track-equivalent units [209] [210] The album-equivalent units set a record for the highest amount of 2021, exceeding the 295,000 units amassed by Olivia Rodrigo's Sour Kanye West scored his 10th chart-topper on the Billboard 200 with the album, making him one of seven artists to have gathered this amount of number-ones on the chart It also marked West's 10th consecutive album to debut at the summit, tying him with Eminem's record [209] It also reached the summit of the US Top Christian Albums and Top Gospel Albums charts, becoming West's second album to top the two charts and achieving the biggest unit week for both [211] The album entered atop the US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, on which it was the rapper's 10th chart-topper [212] 23 of Donda's tracks debuted on the Billboard Hot 100, leading to West joining Drake as one of the two artists to have 23 or more songs chart simultaneously This also increased West's Hot 100 entries to 133, the fifth most of any act, a ranking he attained for top-40 hits as well by having scored 68 \"Hurricane\" was the highest charting track, reaching number six and becoming West's 19th top-20 hit [120] The 23 tracks took up the top-23 spots on both the US Christian Songs and Gospel Songs charts, exceeding West's record of all top-10 positions on the former chart and the top-11 on the latter [211] As a result of the album and its tracks, West went up from number 67 to the top position on the Billboard Artist 100, giving him his third week atop the chart [213] It was the ninth best-selling digital album of 2021 in the United States [214] On March 9, 2022, Donda was certified platinum by the RIAA for pushing 1,000,000 certified units in the US

of the first Venom had led to box office success and they would not be looking to change the franchise's tone simply because it had worked for others; [43] the sequel ultimately received a PG-13 rating [44] Tolmach said the biggest lesson learned from the first Venom was that fans loved the relationship between Eddie and Venom, and the sequel would focus more on the two characters together because of this [45] Serkis described the relationship as the \"central love affair\" of the film, and explained that the sequence in the film where Venom goes to a rave and talks about the \"cruel treatment of aliens\" uses imagery reminiscent of LGBTQIA festivals because the sequence is intended to be Venom's \"coming-out party\" [17] Chinese production company Tencent Pictures co-financed the sequel after previously doing the same for the first film [46]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began on November 15, 2019, [47] at Leavesden Studios in Hertfordshire, England, under the working title Fillmore [48] [49] Robert Richardson served as cinematographer for the film, reuniting with Serkis after they worked together on Breathe (2017) [50] Filming took place at the campus of London South Bank University in mid-January 2020 [51] Hardy revealed that filming in England was completed on February 8, with the production then moving to San Francisco where the film is set [52] Location filming continued in that city for several weeks, taking place in several neighborhoods including the Tenderloin, North Beach, Nob Hill, and Potrero Hill In Potrero Hill, the Anchor Brewery stood in for a police station, while filming in Nob Hill took place at Grace Cathedral on February 20 and 21 Filming also took place at the Palace of Fine Arts in the Marina District [53] Some filming in San Francisco was impacted by production on The Matrix Resurrections (2021), with certain locations such as roads for driving scenes being unavailable to the Venom crew because that film was already using them Helicopters that were being used to film Matrix sequences are visible in the background of a scene in the Venom sequel which uses dialogue to explain them as being police helicopters searching the city [54] Reshoots took place at Pinewood Studios [55]\n\n\nPost-production\nPost-production for the film began shortly before many film productions were forced to shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with Serkis beginning work editing the film in London with the editorial department Once post-production had to be shut down, the film's editor returned to the United States and began working with Serkis remotely to finish editing the film [56] The initial director's cut for the film was around 10 or 15 minutes longer than the final runtime, with Serkis wanting the film to be shorter than expected to make it a \"real thrill ride\" and to try get to Carnage's introduction with as little exposition as possible [17]\n\n\nMusic\nMarco Beltrami was revealed to be the composer for the film in December 2020, after previously composing for several Marvel-based films produced by Parker [66] In September 2021, Eminem was revealed to be composing a new song for the film after doing the same for the first Venom Titled \"Last One Standing\", it was made in collaboration with Skylar Grey, Polo G, and Mozzy [67]\n\n\nMarketing\nAfter announcing the film's official title in April 2020, Sony also released a short teaser featuring the official logo for the film [68] Many fans of the Venom comic books criticized the title, with some wondering why the comic book storyline title Maximum Carnage was not used [69] Sam Barsanti of The A.V Club also thought Maximum Carnage would have worked better, or even Venom 2, and negatively compared the official title to films like Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007), and Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole (2010) [70] /Film's Ethan Anderton acknowledged these criticisms, but felt it was a great title given the first film was \"surprisingly goofy\" [71] Vinnie Mancuso at Collider agreed, calling it \"the perfect title for a beautifully stupid franchise\" He said it suggested Sony \"knows the kind of property it has on its hands\" [72] Tom Reimann, also at Collider, described the teaser as Sony \"proudly showing off the logo of the new film as if the title isn't completely insane\" [68]\n\n\nRelease\nVenom: Let There Be Carnage was screened for fans in London on September 14, 2021, [83] and was released in the United States on

reprise their roles from Godzilla vs Kong while Fala Chen, Alex Ferns and Rachel House would join the cast as well It was also revealed that Wingard would collaborate once more with production designer Tom Hammock, editor Josh Schaeffer, composer Tom Holkenborg, and that Terry Rossio had returned to write the script with Jeremy Slater and Wingard's frequent collaborator Simon Barrett [27] [24] Ultimately, Rossio, Barrett, and Slater received \"screenplay by\" credit, while Rossio, Wingard, and Barrett received \"story by\" credit; Michael Dougherty and Zach Shields, both of whom co-wrote Godzilla: King of the Monsters and Godzilla vs Kong, shared off-screen \"additional literary material\" credit with James Ashcroft, Eli Kent, and Nicole Perlman [28]

[32]\n\n\nPost-production\nThe film's visual effects were supervised by Alessandro Ongaro [33] Wingard confirmed that Mothra's inclusion was always part of the plan However, Legendary did not have the rights to Mothra by the time that post-production began and used a placeholder character named \"Phosphera\" until the rights were secured Wingard also refuted rumors that Phosphera was replaced with Mothra due to poor testing, iterating that Mothra was included as far back as the first draft [34]\n\n\nInfluences\nAfter watching the trailer for Godzilla Minus One (2023), Wingard and Ongaro decided to pay tribute to that film by recreating a shot of the ground bursting beneath Godzilla's footfall for the film's Rome sequence [33] The Egyptian battle between Godzilla and Kong was inspired by the fight scene between Roddy Piper and Keith David from They Live (1988) [35]\n\n\nMusic\nIn August 2022, Tom Holkenborg was announced to return to compose as co-composers the film's score, after

rights to Mothra by the time that post-production began and used a placeholder character named \"Phosphera\" until the rights were secured Wingard also refuted rumors that Phosphera was replaced with Mothra due to poor testing, iterating that Mothra was included as far back as the first draft [34]\n\n\nInfluences\nAfter watching the trailer for Godzilla Minus One (2023), Wingard and Ongaro decided

system whereby the defending champion automatically qualified for the next year's final, where he would play the winner of the all-comers tournament.\n\n\n1915–1977: West Side Tennis Club\nIn early 1915, a group of about 100 tennis players signed a petition in favor of moving the tournament They argued that most tennis clubs, players, and fans were located in the New York City area and that it would therefore be beneficial for the development of the sport to host the national championships there [13] This view was opposed by another group of players that included eight former national singles champions [14] [15] This contentious issue was brought to a vote at the annual USNLTA meeting on February 5, 1915, with 128 votes in favor of and 119 against relocation [16] [17] [18] In August 1915, the men's singles tournament was held at the West Side Tennis Club, Forest Hills in New York City for the first time, while the women's tournament was held at the Philadelphia Cricket Club in Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia (the women's singles event was not moved until 1921) From 1917 to 1933, the men's doubles event was held at the Longwood Cricket Club in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts In 1934, both men's and women's doubles events were held at Longwood Cricket Club [19]\n\n\nOpen Era\nThe Open Era began in 1968 when professional tennis players were allowed to compete for the first time at the Grand Slam tournament held at the West Side Tennis Club The previous U.S National Championships had been limited to amateur players Except for mixed doubles, [citation needed] all events at the 1968 national tournament were open to professionals That year, 96 men and 63 women entered, and prize money totaled $100,000 In 1970, the US Open became the first Grand Slam tournament to use a tiebreaker to decide a set that reached a 6–6 score in games From 1970 through 1974, the US Open used a best-of-nine-point sudden-death tiebreaker before moving to the International Tennis Federation's (ITF) best-of-twelve points system [5] In 1973, the US Open became the first Grand Slam tournament to award equal prize money to men and women, with that year's singles champions, John Newcombe and Margaret Court, receiving $25,000 each [5] Since 1975, following complaints about the surface and its impact on the ball's bounce, the tournament has been played on clay courts instead of grass This was also an experiment to make it more \"TV friendly\" The addition of floodlights allowed matches to be played at night [25] [26]\n\n\nSince 1978: USTA National Tennis Center\nIn 1978, the tournament moved from the West Side Tennis Club to the larger and newly constructed USTA National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, Queens, 3 miles (4.8 km) to the north The tournament's court surface also switched from clay to hardcourt Jimmy Connors is the only individual to have won US Open singles titles on all three surfaces (grass, clay, and hardcourt), while Chris Evert is the only woman to have won US Open singles titles on two surfaces (clay and hardcourt) [5]\n\n\nGrounds\nThe grounds of the US Open have 22 outdoor courts (plus 12 practice courts just outside the East Gate) consisting of four \"show courts\" (Arthur Ashe Stadium, Louis Armstrong Stadium, the Grandstand, and Court 17), 13 field courts, and 5 practice courts.\n\n\nSurface\nFrom 1978 to 2019, the US Open was played on a hardcourt surface called Pro DecoTurf It is a multi-layer cushioned surface and classified by the International Tennis Federation as medium-fast [47] Each August before the start of the tournament, the courts are resurfaced [48] In March 2020, the USTA announced that Laykold would become the new court surface supplier beginning with the 2020 tournament [49]\n\n\nPlayer line call challenges\nIn 2006, the US Open introduced instant replay reviews of line calls, using the Hawk-Eye computer system It was the first Grand Slam tournament to use the system [51] The Open felt the need to implement the system because of the controversial quarterfinal match at the 2004 US Open [citation needed] between Serena Williams and Jennifer Capriati, where a number of important line calls went against Williams  Replays on TV showed these calls were incorrect, including one critical point in the match that was incorrectly overruled by the chair umpire [52] Instant replay was available only on the Arthur Ashe Stadium and Louis Armstrong Stadium courts through the 2008 tournament In 2009, it became available on the Grandstand court [citation needed] In 2018, all competition courts were outfitted with Hawk-Eye, and all matches in the main draws (Men's and Women's Singles and Doubles) followed the same procedure, whereby each player was allowed three incorrect challenges per set, with one more given in a tiebreak Player challenges were eliminated in 2021, when the tournament became the second Grand Slam to fully incorporate Hawk-Eye Live, where all line calls are made electronically; the previous year's tournament had also incorporated Hawk-Eye Live on all courts except for Arthur Ashe and Louis Armstrong stadiums to reduce personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic [53]\n\n\nPoint and prize money distribution\nRanking points for the men (ATP) and women (WTA) have varied at the US Open through the years Below is a series of tables for each

Born on November 25, 1947, in New Orleans, Louisiana, Larroquette has had a diverse career in film, television, and theater.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nLarroquette was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, the son of Berthalla Oramous, a department store clerk, and John Edgar Larroquette Jr., who served in the United States Navy. His paternal grandfather, John Larroquette Sr., emigrated to the United States from France in 1895. Larroquette's early life was marked by a strong sense of family and a love for storytelling, which would later influence his career as an actor.\n\n**Career**\n\nLarroquette's first acting role in Hollywood was providing the opening voiceover narration for the 1974 film _The Texas Chain Saw Massacre_. He did this as a favor for the film's director, Tobe Hooper, and was paid in marijuana. His first series regular role was in the 1970s NBC program _Baa Baa Black Sheep_, where he portrayed a World War II United States Marine Corps fighter pilot, 2nd Lt. Bob Anderson.\n\n## Early Career\n\nLarroquette's early career was marked by a mix of film and television roles. He appeared in a number of small parts on television shows, including _The Mary Tyler Moore Show_ and _The Bob Newhart Show_. He also began to make a name for himself in the theater world, appearing in productions such as _Enter Laughing_ and _The Real Thing_.\n\n**Night Court (1984–1992)**\n\nLarroquette's breakout role came in 1984 when he was cast as Assistant District Attorney Dan Fielding on the NBC sitcom _Night Court_. The character was initially rather conservative, but changed after the show's creator, Reinhold Weege, came to learn more about Larroquette's sense of humor. The role won Larroquette four consecutive Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 1985, 1986, 1987, and 1988. In 1989, he asked not to be considered for an Emmy Award, but his four consecutive wins remained a record at the time.\n\n## The John Larroquette Show\n\nAfter leaving _Night Court_, Larroquette and showrunner Don Reo developed a show revolving around some of Larroquette's own personal demons, particularly alcoholism. The show, _The John Larroquette Show_, was named by the insistence of NBC, and starred Larroquette as the character John Hemingway. The show was lauded by critics, but failed to attract the prime-time audience, ranking around number 97 for most of the first season.\n\n**Boston Legal and Other Television Roles**\n\nIn 1998, Larroquette guest-starred on three episodes of the legal drama _The Practice_. His portrayal of Joey Heric, a wealthy, wisecracking, narcissistic psychopath with a habit of stabbing his gay lovers to death, won him his fifth Emmy Award. He reprised the role for one episode in 2002, for which he was once again nominated for an Emmy Award. He also appeared in an episode of _The West Wing_ as White House Counsel Lionel Tribbey.\n\n**Film**\n\nLarroquette has appeared in a number of films throughout his career, including _The Texas Chain Saw Massacre_ (1974), _Enter Laughing_ (1975), _The Real Thing_ (1975), and _Masquerade_ (1988). He has also voiced characters in animated films such as _Looney Tunes: Back in Action_ (2003) and _The Muppets_ (2011).\n\n## Theatre\n\nLarroquette has had a successful career in theater, appearing in productions such as _Enter Laughing_ (1975), _The Real Thing_ (1976), and _Old Times_ (1978). He has also appeared in several Broadway productions, including _The Real Thing_ (1976), _The Sunshine Boys_ (1992), and _The Importance of Being Earnest_ (2000).\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nLarroquette met his wife, Elizabeth Ann Cookson, in 1974 while working in the play _Enter Laughing_. They were married in 1975, as that was the only day they had off from rehearsals. Cookson brought her daughter, Lisa, from a previous relationship into the marriage, and Larroquette and Cookson would have two sons together, Jonathan and Benjamin. Jonathan co-hosts a comedy podcast called _Uhh Yeah Dude_.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* _The Texas Chain Saw Massacre_ (1974)\n* _Enter Laughing_ (1975)\n* _The Real Thing_ (1976)\n* _Masquerade_ (1988)\n* _Looney Tunes: Back in Action_ (2003)\n* _The Muppets_ (2011)\n\n**Television**\n\n* _Baa Baa Black Sheep_ (1970s)\n* _The Mary Tyler Moore Show_ (1970s)\n* _The Bob Newhart Show_ (1970s)\n* _Night Court_ (1984–1992)\n* _The John Larroquette Show_ (1993–1996)\n* _The Practice_ (1998)\n* _The West Wing_ (2000)\n* _Boston Legal_ (2004)\n* _Uhh Yeah Dude_ (2020)\n\n**Theatre**\n\n* _Enter Laughing_ (1975)\n* _The Real Thing_ (1976)\n* _Old Times_ (1978)\n* _The Sunshine Boys_ (1992)\n* _The Importance of Being Earnest_ (2000)\n\n**Awards and Nominations**\n\n* Emmy Awards:\n\t+ Won: Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for _Night Court_ (1985, 1986, 1987, 1988)\n\t+ Won: Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for _The Practice_ (1998)\n\t+ Nominated: Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for _The West Wing_ (2000)\n\t+ Nominated: Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for _Boston Legal_ (2004)\n* Golden Globe Awards:\n\t+ Nominated: Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Miniseries, or Motion Picture Made for Television for _The Practice_ (1999)\n\t+ Nominated: Best Actor in a Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television for _The Practice_ (1999)\n* Screen Actors Guild Awards:\n\t+ Nominated: Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series for _The Practice_ (2000)\n\t+ Nominated: Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series for _The Practice_ (2000)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"John_Larroquette\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nLarroquette was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, on November 25, 1947, the son of Berthalla Oramous, a department store clerk, and John Edgar Larroquette Jr., who was in the United States Navy [2] [3] His paternal grandfather, John Larroquette Sr., was born in France and emigrated to the United States in 1895.\n\n\nCareer\nHis first acting role in Hollywood was providing the opening voiceover narration for The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) Larroquette did this as a favor for the film's director Tobe Hooper, and was paid in marijuana [5] His first series regular role was in the 1970s NBC program Baa Baa Black Sheep, where he portrayed a World War II United States Marine Corps fighter pilot, 2nd Lt Bob Anderson.\n\n\nEarly career\nHis first acting role in Hollywood was providing the opening voiceover narration for The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) Larroquette did this as a favor for the film's director Tobe Hooper, and was paid in marijuana [5] His first series regular role was in the 1970s NBC program Baa Baa Black Sheep, where he portrayed a World War II United States Marine Corps fighter pilot, 2nd Lt Bob Anderson.\n\n\nNight Court (1984–1992)\nLarroquette played Assistant District Attorney Dan Fielding on Night Court; the character was initially rather conservative, but changed after the sitcom's creator Reinhold Weege came to learn more about Larroquette's sense of humor [7] [8] The role won him Emmy Awards in 1985, 1986, 1987 and 1988 In 1989, he asked not to be considered for an Emmy Award [9] His four consecutive wins were, at the time, a record.\n\n\nThe John Larroquette Show\nInstead of a spinoff, Larroquette and Don Reo developed a show revolving around some of Larroquette's own personal demons, particularly alcoholism The John Larroquette Show, named by the insistence of NBC, starred Larroquette as the character John Hemingway The show was lauded by critics, but failed to attract the prime-time audience, ranking around number 97 for most of the first season.\n\n\nBoston Legal and other television roles\nIn 1998, he guest-starred on three episodes of the legal drama The Practice His portrayal of Joey Heric, a wealthy, wisecracking, narcissistic psychopath with a habit of stabbing his gay lovers to death, won him his fifth Emmy Award He reprised the role for one episode in 2002, for which he was once again nominated for an Emmy Award He also appeared in an episode of The West Wing as White House Counsel Lionel Tribbey.\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTheatre\n\n\nPersonal life\nLarroquette met his wife Elizabeth Ann Cookson in 1974 while working in the play Enter Laughing They were married July 4, 1975, as that was the only day they had off from rehearsals [8] Cookson brought her daughter Lisa from a previous relationship into the marriage, and she and Larroquette would have two sons together, Jonathan and Benjamin [13] Jonathan co-hosts a comedy podcast called Uhh Yeah Dude.\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nTheatre\n\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "AIM-9_Sidewinder", "content": "\nDesign\nThe AIM-9 was a product of the US Naval Weapons Center at China Lake in the Mojave Desert It features a lightweight, compact design with cruciform canards and tail fins It uses a solid rocket motor for propulsion, similar to most conventional missiles, a continuous-rod fragmentation warhead, and an infrared seeker [9]\n\n\nGuidance\nThe Sidewinder is not guided by the actual position recorded by the detector, but by the change in position since the last sighting So if the target remained at 5 degrees left between two rotations of the mirror, the electronics would not output any signal to the control system Consider a missile fired at right angles to its target; if the missile is flying at the same speed as the target, it should \"lead\" it by 45 degrees, flying to an impact point far in front of where the target was when it was fired If the missile is traveling four times the speed of the target, it should follow an angle about 11 degrees in front In either case, the missile should keep that angle all the way to interception, which means that the angle that the target makes against the detector is constant It was this constant angle that the Sidewinder attempted to maintain This \"proportional pursuit\" system is straightforward to implement and offers high-performance lead calculation almost for free and can respond to changes in the target's flight path, [12] which is much more efficient and makes the missile \"lead\" the target [13]\n\n\nHistory\nDuring World War II, various researchers in Germany designed infrared guidance systems of various complexity The most mature development of these, codenamed Hamburg, was intended for use by the Blohm & Voss BV 143 glide bomb in an anti-ship role Hamburg used a single IR photocell as its detector along with a spinning disk with lines painted on it, alternately known as a \"reticle\" or \"chopper\" The reticle spun at a fixed speed, causing the output of the photocell to be interrupted in a pattern, and the precise timing of the resulting signal indicated the bearing of the target Although Hamburg and similar devices like Madrid were essentially complete, the work of mating them to a missile had not been carried out by the time the war ended [14]\n\n\nOrigins\nDuring World War II, various researchers in Germany designed infrared

to be interrupted in a pattern, and the precise timing of the resulting signal indicated the bearing of the target Although Hamburg and similar devices like Madrid were essentially complete, the work of mating them to a missile had not been carried out by the time the war ended [14]\n\n\nFirst Generation Rear-Aspect Variants\nNearly 100,000 of the first generation (AIM-9B/C/D/E) of the Sidewinder were produced with Raytheon and General Electric as major subcontractors Philco-Ford produced the guidance and control sections of the early missiles The NATO version of the first-generation missile was built under license in Germany by Bodenseewerk Gerätetechnik; 9,200 examples were built [15]\n\n\nAIM-9A (AAM-N-7 Sidewinder I) (USN)\nAIM-9A was a pre-production of the Sidewinder, first fired successfully in September 1953 Missile production began in 1955, and the first models entered the Navy's fleet service in 1956 Generally, it was a prototype production run, with 240 pieces being produced, and mainly intended for training pilots in air combat techniques The AIM-9A was initially called the AAM-N-7 before the tri-service designation change in 1962 [17]\n\n\nAIM-9B (AAM-N-7 Sidewinder IA) (USAF/USN)\nThe AIM-9B is very similar to the AIM-9A, but the \"B\" has a more sophisticated rear and more aerodynamical front fins The AIM-9B is a very limited weapon, but it had no serious competitors and counters when it was introduced, causing it to be adopted by the USAF and NATO as a standard weapon, with around 80,000 units being produced from 1958 to 1962 [17]\n\n\nAIM-9B Derivatives\nRB24: A Swedish AIM-9B Sidewinder.\n\n\nAIM-9C (AAM-N-7 Sidewinder IC (SARH)) (USN)\nThe lackluster performance of the AIM-9B caused the Navy to look for successor And in 1963 the AAM-N-7 Sidewinder IC was designed, It was developed in two variations: a SARH (semi-active radar homing) variant (AIM-9C) and an IR (AIM-9D) in 1963 The AIM-9C's semi-active radar was exclusively tied to the F-8 Crusader's radar and fire control system (FCS) A total of around 1,000 AIM-9C missiles were launched from 1965 to 1967, but their usage in Vietnam war proved unsuccessful, downing no enemies A filter modification program for reworked units (to allow high altitude capability up to 18,288m (60,000 feet) This was the only planned modification [citation needed]\n\n\nAIM-9D \"Delta\" (AAM-N-7 Sidewinder IC (IR)) (USN)\nRecognizing the limitations of the initial AIM-9B, the US Navy (USN) worked to improve the missile's performance They changed the missile nose to an aerodynamical ogival nose The seeker was improved with a wider field of view beyond 25 degrees and a reduced instantaneous field of view of 2.5 degrees, to reduce foreign thermal interference (from flares) A better nitrogen cooling system was added for the fuze, being the first in the world This enhanced the missile's head sensitivity Maneuverability was also improved with a faster tracking rate, as well as a new actuator system The Sidewinder's range was improved as well, with the new Hercules MK 36 solid-fuel rocket motor allowing the missile to fly up to 18km Finally, a new Mk 48 continuous-rod warhead was fitted to the missile for increased damage; this also meant infrared or a radio proximity fuze could be used These improvements were all added into AIM-9D and went into service with the USN Around 1,000 AIM-9D units were produced from 1965 to 1969 The primary problem of the AIM-9D was breakup during launch The AIM-9D was eventually developed into AIM-9G [18]\n\n\nAIM-9D Derivatives\nATM-9D (USN): AIM-9D used for captive flight target acquisition training [17]\n\n\nAIM-9E \"Echo\" (USAF)\nThe AIM-9E \"Echo\" was the first version developed solely by the U.S Air Force (USAF) The AIM-9E allows the expansion of the weapons acquisition envelope, especially at low-altitude, increasing its Probability of Kill (P [k]) It achieved this using a new low-drag conical nose head, being a distinguishing feature of USAF Sidewinders A magnesium fluoride seeker dome was introduced, along with a more compact optical assembly, an improved guidance control system, new electronics, and significant changes to the internal wiring harnesses These improvements facilitated a better 100 Hz reticle rate, and a 16.5 deg/sec tracking rate The most significant design change was the addition of cooling for the PbS detector, adding Peltier (thermoelectric) cooling, giving the advantage of unlimited cooling when positioned on the launch rail, but is only active when electrical power is present The AIM-9E gives greater range over the AIM-9B, but is worse than the \"D\" The canard design was changed to a squared tip double delta planform, this helped improve canard behaviour at higher angles of attack (AOA) Over 5,000 AIM-9B's were rebuilt into AIM-9E's [17]\n\n\nAIM-9E Variants\nAIM-9E: Standard production model.\n\n\nAIM-9B FGW.2 Sidewinder (AIM-9F)\nAs the Sidewinder was being acquired by NATO forces, licensed production was given to West Germany and they would produce around 15,000 units Like the Americans, the West Germans sought to improve the AIM-9B design due to its limitations The only visible exterior difference is a greenish sensor window, but many tech improvements were added beneath the shell Unnoticed improvements include solid state electronics (instead of vacuum tubes), carbon dioxide seeker cooling, a new nose dome and superior optical filtering Conversions were done to European AIM-9B to upgrade them to the FGW.2 standard The official designation is the AIM-9B FGW.2 but it is known as the AIM-9F in US nomenclature.\n\n\nAIM-9G \"Golf\" (USN)\nThe AIM-9G was very similar to the AIM-9D in most aspects, and did not differ externally The AIM-9G was an AIM-9D that used an improved AIM-9D seeker head with SEAM (Sidewinder Extended Acquisition Mode), this allowed the slewing of the optics through a search pattern to acquire the enemy (most likely using a rosette scan), [citation needed] it also allowed the slaving of the optics to a radar or helmet sight This was connected to the onboard computer of the aircraft, which gave the capability of capturing the target using the data coming from the airborne radar This meant that the target could be locked without being in the sights, and the missile automatically got pre-launch instructions The conical scanning speed was also increased greatly The seeker head was now able to seek in a 25˚ circular scan This allowed the AIM-9G to have an improved chance of acquiring the target than earlier models This, along with other upgraded solid-state modules, culminated in the AIM-9G The improvement was substantial enough that an order of 5,000 AIM-9D seekers was stopped at 1,850 units, with the rest being ordered to AIM-9G seeker specifications instead Around 2120 AIM-9G were built by Raytheon from 1970 to 1972 [17]\n\n\nAIM-9G Derivatives\nATM-9G (USN): AIM-9G used for captive flight target acquisition training [17]\n\n\nAIM-9H (USN)\nWithin December 1965, two designers McLean and LaBerge (who were employed by Philco-Ford) came together to create ways to improve the AIM-9G's reliability One submission was to advance all the remaining missile electronic components from vacuum to solid-state gradually.The US Air Force adhered to this steady replacement of their AIM-9's to solid-state, however the Navy opted for a different approach after Walt Freitag, a USN engineer proposed a full change to solid-state in one missile.\n\n\nAIM-9H Derivatives\nATM-9H: Was a training version of the AIM-9H for captive flight target acquisition [17]\n\n\nAIM-9K (USN)\nThe AIM-9K was a planned U.S Navy (USN) upgrade to the AIM-9H, but the development was abandoned in favour of USAF/USN joint AIM-9L.\n\n\nAIM-9J (USAF)\nAs the AIM-9E Sidewinder was entering service in Southeast Asia during the conclusion of Operation Rolling Thunder, the USAF started the development the next generation Sidewinders to replace the AIM-9E In November 1968, the testing of an AIM-9E upgrade the \"Extended Performance\" began The missile was designed to give pilots a more capable close-range IR missile against a manoeuvring target It would eventually be designated the AIM-9J.\n\n\nAIM-9J Variants\nAIM-9J: The base variant.\n\n\nAIM-9J Derivatives\nRB24J: Swedish designation of the AIM-9J.\n\n\nAIM-9P\nThe AIM-9P Sidewinder missile was a USAF sponsored family of export missiles based on the AIM-9J/N, and would be upgraded multiple times over its lifespan The AIM-9P was an improved AIM-9J with a new motor, fuze and better reliability It included a greater engagement range, allowing it to be launched farther from the target The AIM-9P was more maneuverable than the AIM-9J, and also included improved solid-state electronics that increased reliability and maintainability The AIM-9P was either a rebuilt B/E or J or all-new production  Deliveries of the AIM-9P began in 1978.\n\n\nAIM-9P Variants\nAIM-9P: The base model.\n\n\nLater Generation All-Aspect Variants\nThe next major advance in IR Sidewinder development was the AIM-9L (\"Lima\") model which was in full production in 1977 [21] [23] This was the first \"all-aspect\" Sidewinder with the ability to attack from all directions, including head-on, which had a dramatic effect on close-in combat tactics.\n\n\nAIM-9L (USAF/USN)\nThe next major advance in IR Sidewinder development was the AIM-9L (\"Lima\") model which was in full production in 1977 [21] [23] This was the first \"all-aspect\" Sidewinder with the ability to attack from all directions, including head-on, which had a dramatic effect on close-in combat tactics.\n\n\nAIM-9L Derivatives\nDATM-9L (USAF/USN): This is a AIM-9L used to train ground personnel in missile assembly, disassembly, loading, transportation, and storage procedures and techniques [4]\n\n\nAIM-9M (USAF/USN)\nThe AIM-9M is an improved AIM-9L inheriting the all-aspect capability of the L model, but providing all-around higher performance Having a better background rejection and infrared countermeasures discrimination (WGU-4/B), a low-smoke motor to reduce the visual signature of the weapon, and improved guidance control section with counter-countermeasures and improved maintainability and producibility The AIM-9M uses an annular blast fragmentation warhead These modifications increase ability to locate and lock-on a target and decrease the missile's chances for detection.\n\n\nAIM-9M Variants\nThe AIM-9R was an improved AIM-9M developed by the navy, it included the new WGU-19/B IIR (Imaging Infrared) seeker, with much better tracking performance and detection performance (during daytime), with the ability to reject both background terrain and clouds, a bigger seeker FOV, and more effective counter-countermeasures capability against known and postulated jamming or seduction techniques The first live firing occurred in 1990, but in 1992, production was cancelled as a lack of funding due to defense budget cuts [17]\n\n\nAIM-9M Derivatives\nThe AIM-9R was an improved AIM-9M developed by the navy, it included the new WGU-19/B IIR (Imaging Infrared) seeker, with much better tracking performance and detection performance (during daytime), with the ability to reject both background terrain and clouds, a bigger seeker FOV, and more effective counter-countermeasures capability against known and postulated jamming or seduction techniques The first live firing occurred in 1990, but in 1992, production was cancelled as a lack of funding due to defense budget cuts [17]\n\n\nNATM-9M Variants\nThe AIM-9R was an improved AIM-9M developed by the navy, it included the new WGU-19/B IIR (Imaging Infrared) seeker, with much better tracking performance and detection performance (during daytime), with the ability to reject both background terrain and clouds, a bigger seeker FOV, and more effective counter-countermeasures capability against known and postulated jamming or seduction techniques The first live firing occurred in 1990, but in 1992, production was cancelled as a lack of funding due to defense budget cuts

jamming or seduction techniques The first live firing occurred in 1990, but in 1992, production was cancelled as a lack of funding due to defense budget cuts [17]\n\n\nAIM-9S (USN)\nThe AIM-9S is a modified AIM-9M with the counter-countermeasures (CCM) equipment removed from the guidance-control section This derivative is used for FMS (Foreign Military Sales), giving the latest Sidewinder technology, to USA allies, without giving away valuable missile technology A customer of the AIM-9S was Turkey with them having 310 units in 2005 [17]\n\n\nBOA/Box Office\nChina Lake developed an improved compressed carriage control configuration titled BOA \"Compressed carriage\" missiles have smaller control surfaces to allow more missiles to fit in a given space [25] The surfaces may be permanently \"clipped\", or may fold out when the missile is launched.\n\n\nAIM-9X (USAF/USN)\nHughes Electronics was awarded a contract for development of the AIM-9X Sidewinder in 1996 after a competition against Raytheon for the next short-range aerial combat missile, [26] though Raytheon purchased the defense portions of Hughes Electronics the following year [27] The AIM-9X entered service in November 2003 with the USAF (the lead platform was the F-15C) and the USN (the lead platform was the F/A-18C) and is a substantial upgrade to the Sidewinder family featuring an imaging infrared focal-plane array (FPA) seeker with claimed 90° off-boresight capability, compatibility with helmet-mounted displays such as the new U.S Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS), and a totally new two-axis thrust-vectoring control (TVC) system providing increased turn capability over traditional control surfaces (60 g) Using the JHMCS, a pilot can point the AIM-9X missile's seeker and \"lock on\" by simply looking at a target, thereby increasing air combat effectiveness [28] It retains the same rocket motor, fuze and warhead of the AIM-9M, but its lower drag gives it improved range and speed [29] The AIM-9X also includes an internal cooling system, eliminating the need for use of launch-rail nitrogen bottles (U.S Navy and Marines) or internal argon bottles (USAF) It also features an electronic safe and arm device similar to the AMRAAM, allowing for a reduction in minimum range, and reprogrammable infrared Counter Counter Measures (IRCCM) capability that coupled with the FPA provides improved look down into clutter and performance against the latest IRCM Though not part of the original requirement, the AIM-9X demonstrated potential for lock-on after launch capability, allowing for possible internal use for the F-35 Lightning II, F-22 Raptor and even in a submarine-launched configuration for use against ASW platforms [30] The AIM-9X has been tested for a surface attack capability, with mixed results [31]\n\n\nBlock II\nTesting work on the AIM-9X Block II version began in September 2008 [32] The Block II adds lock-on after launch capability with a datalink, so the missile can be launched first and then directed to its target afterwards by an aircraft with the proper equipment for 360-degree engagements, such as the F-35 or the F-22 [33] By January 2013, the AIM-9X Block II was about halfway through its operational testing and performing better than expected NAVAIR reported that the missile was exceeding performance requirements in all areas, including lock-on after launch (LOAL) One area where the Block II needs improvement is helmetless high off-boresight (HHOBS) performance It is functioning well on the missile, but performance is below that of the Block I AIM-9X The HHOBS deficiency does not impact any other Block II capabilities, and is planned to be improved upon by a software clean-up build Objectives of the operational test were due to be completed by the third quarter of 2013 [34] However, as of May 2014 there have been plans to resume operational testing and evaluation (including surface-to-air missile system compatibility) [35] As of June 2013 [update], Raytheon had delivered 5,000 AIM-9X missiles to the armed services [36] On 18 June 2017, after an AIM-9X did not successfully track a targeted Syrian Air Force Su-22 Fitter, US Navy Lt Cmdr Michael \"Mob\" Tremel flying a F/A-18E Super Hornet used an AMRAAM AAM to successfully destroy the enemy aircraft [37] There is a theory that the Sidewinder is tested against American and not Soviet/Russian flares The Sidewinder is used to rejecting American but not Soviet/Russian flares Similar issues arose from the testing of the AIM-9P model The missile would ignore American flares but go for Soviet ones due to their \"different burn time, intensity and separation.\" [38] [39]\n\n\nBlock III\nIn September 2012, Raytheon was ordered to continue developing the Sidewinder into a Block III variant, even though the Block II had not yet entered service The USN projected that the new missile would have a 60 percent longer range, modern components to replace old ones, and an insensitive munitions warhead, which is more stable and less likely to detonate by accident, making it safer for ground crews The need for the AIM-9 to have an increased range was caused by digital radio frequency memory (DRFM) jammers that can blind the onboard radar of an AIM-120D AMRAAM, so the Sidewinder Block III's passive imaging infrared homing guidance system was seen as a useful alternative Although it could supplement the AMRAAM for beyond visual range (BVR) engagements, it would still be capable of performing within visual range (WVR) Modifying the AIM-9X was seen as a cost-effective alternative to developing a new missile in a time of declining budgets To achieve the range increase, the rocket motor would have a combination of increased performance and missile power management The Block III would \"leverage\" the Block II's guidance unit and electronics, including the AMRAAM-derived datalink The Block III was scheduled to achieve initial operational capability (IOC) in 2022, following the increased number of F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters to enter service [41] [42] The Navy pressed for this upgrade in response to a projected threat which analysts have speculated will be due to the difficulty of targeting upcoming Chinese fifth-generation jet fighters (Chengdu J-20, Shenyang J-31) with the radar-guided AMRAAM, [43] specifically that Chinese advances in electronics will mean Chinese fighters will use their AESA radars as jammers to degrade the AIM-120's kill probability [44] However, the Navy's FY 2016 budget canceled the AIM-9X Block III as they cut down buys of the F-35C, as it was primarily intended to permit the fighter to carry six BVR missiles; the insensitive munition warhead will be retained for the AIM-9X program [45]\n\n\nCombat\nThe first combat use of the Sidewinder came on 24 September 1958 by the Republic of China (Taiwan) Air Force during the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis At the time, ROCAF North American F-86 Sabres were routinely engaged in air battles with the People's Republic of China over the Taiwan Strait In similar fashion to Korean War encounters between the F-86 and earlier MiG-15, high-flying PRC MiG-17s cruised above the ROC Sabres, immune to their .50-cal guns and only fighting when conditions favoured them [47]\n\n\nCombat debut: Taiwan Strait, 1958\nThe

classified Red Baron Report while the Navy conducted a study concentrating primarily on performance of air-to-air weapons that was informally known as the \"Ault Report\" Both services subsequently modified their AIM-9s to improve performance and reliability [51]\n\n\nVietnam War AIM-9 claimed aerial combat kills\nIn total 452 Sidewinders were fired during the Vietnam War, resulting in a kill

fighter jet of the Argentine Air Force while on combat air patrol protecting the invasion fleet [56] By the end of the war, Sea Harriers armed with AIM-9L Sidewinders had destroyed 23 Argentine aircraft in air to air engagements without losing a single British aircraft to enemy fire [57] The fact that heat seeking Sidewinders were targeting hot jet exhausts against a cold background of the South Atlantic in winter resulted in a lethality rate of over\n80 percent [58]\n\n\n2023 North American balloon & unidentified object shootdowns\nOn 4 February 2023, an F-22 Raptor operated by the United States Air Force used a single AIM-9X missile to shoot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon off the coast of Surfside Beach, South Carolina at an altitude between 60,000 to 65,000 feet (18,000 to 20,000 m) [59] [60] Six days later, another object was shot down near Alaska [61] On 11 and 12 February two more objects were shot down, over Yukon, Canada and Lake Huron in Michigan respectively

"**Introduction**\n\nThe AIM-9 Sidewinder is a family of infrared-guided air-to-air missiles developed in the United States in the late 1950s. It has become one of the most widely used and iconic missiles in the world, with a history spanning over six decades. The Sidewinder has undergone numerous upgrades and improvements, resulting in various models and variants. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the AIM-9 Sidewinder, including its design, guidance, history, and combat performance.\n\n**Design**\n\nThe AIM-9 was a product of the US Naval Weapons Center at China Lake in the Mojave Desert. It features a lightweight, compact design with cruciform canards and tail fins. The missile uses a solid rocket motor for propulsion, similar to most conventional missiles, and a continuous-rod fragmentation warhead. The most distinctive feature of the Sidewinder is its infrared seeker, which uses a single IR photocell as its detector.\n\n**Guidance**\n\nThe Sidewinder is not guided by the actual position recorded by the detector, but by the change in position since the last sighting. This allows the missile to maintain a constant angle with the target, which is crucial for its effectiveness. The \"proportional pursuit\" system used by the Sidewinder is straightforward to implement and offers high-performance lead calculation.\n\n**History**\n\nThe development of the Sidewinder began in the late 1950s, with the first successful flight test taking place in September 1953. The missile was initially called the AAM-N-7 Sidewinder and was intended for use by the US Navy. The first production models entered service in 1956, and the missile quickly gained popularity due to its effectiveness and ease of use.\n\n**First Generation Rear-Aspect Variants**\n\nThe first generation of Sidewinders (AIM-9B/C/D/E) was produced with Raytheon and General Electric as major subcontractors. Philco-Ford produced the guidance and control sections of the early missiles. The NATO version of the first-generation missile was built under license in Germany by Bodenseewerk Gerätetechnik, with 9,200 examples produced.\n\n**AIM-9A (AAM-N-7 Sidewinder I)**\n\nThe AIM-9A was a pre-production model of the Sidewinder, with 240 pieces produced. It was primarily intended for training pilots in air combat techniques.\n\n**AIM-9B (AAM-N-7 Sidewinder IA)**\n\nThe AIM-9B was a slight improvement over the AIM-9A, with a more sophisticated rear and more aerodynamic front fins. It was adopted by the USAF and NATO as a standard weapon, with around 80,000 units produced from 1958 to 1962.\n\n**AIM-9C (AAM-N-7 Sidewinder IC (SARH))**\n\nThe AIM-9C was a semi-active radar homing variant of the Sidewinder, designed to be used with the F-8 Crusader's radar and fire control system. Only around 1,000 AIM-9C missiles were launched, with limited success.\n\n**AIM-9D \"Delta\" (AAM-N-7 Sidewinder IC (IR))**\n\nThe AIM-9D was an improved version of the AIM-9C, with a wider field of view and a more efficient seeker. It was used by the US Navy from 1965 to 1969.\n\n**AIM-9E \"Echo\"**\n\nThe AIM-9E was the first version developed solely by the US Air Force. It featured a new low-drag conical nose head and improved guidance control systems.\n\n**Later Generation All-Aspect Variants**\n\nThe next major advance in IR Sidewinder development was the AIM-9L model, which was in full production in 1977. This was the first \"all-aspect\" Sidewinder, with the ability to attack from all directions, including head-on.\n\n**AIM-9L**\n\nThe AIM-9L was a significant improvement over the AIM-9E, with a more advanced seeker and improved guidance control systems. It was used by the US Navy and Air Force from 1977 to 1996.\n\n**AIM-9M**\n\nThe AIM-9M was an improved version of the AIM-9L, with a more advanced seeker and improved guidance control systems. It was used by the US Navy and Air Force from 1985 to 2003.\n\n**AIM-9R**\n\nThe AIM-9R was an improved version of the AIM-9M, developed by the US Navy. It featured a new WGU-19/B IIR seeker and improved guidance control systems.\n\n**AIM-9S**\n\nThe AIM-9S was a modified version of the AIM-9M, with the counter-countermeasures equipment removed from the guidance-control section. It was used by the US Navy for Foreign Military Sales.\n\n**BOA/Box Office**\n\nThe BOA was an improved compressed carriage control configuration developed by China Lake. It featured smaller control surfaces to allow more missiles to fit in a given space.\n\n**AIM-9X**\n\nThe AIM-9X was a substantial upgrade to the Sidewinder family, featuring an imaging infrared focal-plane array seeker and a two-axis thrust-vectoring control system. It was used by the US Air Force and Navy from 2003 to present.\n\n**Block II**\n\nThe AIM-9X Block II was an improved version of the AIM-9X, featuring a datalink and lock-on after launch capability. It was used by the US Air Force and Navy from 2013 to present.\n\n**Block III**\n\nThe AIM-9X Block III was an improved version of the AIM-9X, featuring a longer range and more advanced seeker. It was canceled by the US Navy in 2016.\n\n**Combat**\n\nThe first combat use of the Sidewinder came on September 24, 1958, by the Republic of China Air Force during the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis. The missile was used by the US Navy and Air Force in various conflicts, including the Vietnam War and the Gulf War. The Sidewinder has been credited with numerous kills, including 23 Argentine aircraft during the Falklands War.\n\n**Later Developments**\n\nThe Sidewinder has undergone numerous upgrades and improvements, including the development of new variants and the integration of new technologies. The missile has been used in various roles, including air-to-air combat and surface-to-air defense.\n\n**Other Ground Launch Platforms**\n\nThe MIM-72 Chaparral is an American-made self-propelled surface-to-air missile (SAM) based on the AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missile system. The AIM-9X has also been test-fired from a Multi-Mission Launcher at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, USA.\n\n**Operators**\n\nThe Sidewinder has been used by various countries, including the United States, Israel, and Turkey. The missile has also been exported to several countries, including Australia and South Korea.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article has been written in a neutral, encyclopedic tone and follows the exact outline structure using \"#\" for main sections and \"##\" for subsections.

this outline:\n\n\nDesign\nThe AIM-9 was a product of the US Naval Weapons Center at China Lake in the Mojave Desert It features a lightweight, compact design with cruciform canards and tail fins It uses a solid rocket motor for propulsion, similar to most conventional missiles, a continuous-rod fragmentation warhead, and an infrared seeker [9]\n\n\nGuidance\nThe Sidewinder is not guided by the actual position recorded by the detector, but by the change in position since the last sighting So if the target remained at 5 degrees left between two rotations of the mirror, the electronics would not output any signal to the control system Consider a missile fired at right angles to its target; if the missile is flying at the same speed as the target, it should \"lead\" it by 45 degrees, flying to an impact point far in front of where the target was when it was fired If the missile is traveling four times the speed of the target, it should follow an angle about 11 degrees in front In either case, the missile should keep that angle all the way to interception, which means that the angle that the target makes against the detector is constant It was this constant angle that the Sidewinder attempted to maintain This \"proportional pursuit\" system is straightforward to implement and offers high-performance lead calculation almost for free and can respond to changes in the target's flight path, [12] which is much more efficient and makes the missile \"lead\" the target [13]\n\n\nHistory\nDuring World War II, various researchers in Germany designed infrared guidance systems of various complexity The most mature development of these, codenamed Hamburg, was intended for use by the Blohm & Voss BV 143 glide bomb in an anti-ship role Hamburg used a single IR photocell as its detector along with a spinning disk with lines painted on it, alternately known as a \"reticle\" or \"chopper\" The reticle spun at a fixed speed, causing the output of the photocell to be interrupted in a pattern, and the precise timing of the resulting signal indicated the bearing of the target Although Hamburg and similar devices like Madrid were essentially complete, the work of mating them to a missile had not been carried out by the time the war ended [14]\n\n\nOrigins\nDuring World War II, various researchers in Germany designed infrared guidance systems of various

Raytheon and General Electric as major subcontractors Philco-Ford produced the guidance and control sections of the early missiles The NATO version of the first-generation missile was built under license in Germany by Bodenseewerk Gerätetechnik; 9,200 examples were built [15]\n\n\nAIM-9A (AAM-N-7 Sidewinder I) (USN)\nAIM-9A was a pre-production of the Sidewinder, first fired successfully in September 1953 Missile production began in 1955, and the first models entered the Navy's fleet service in 1956 Generally, it was a prototype production run, with 240 pieces being produced, and mainly intended for training pilots in air combat techniques The AIM-9A was initially called the AAM-N-7 before the tri-service designation change in 1962 [17]\n\n\nAIM-9B (AAM-N-7 Sidewinder IA) (USAF/USN)\nThe AIM-9B is very similar to the AIM-9A, but the \"B\" has a more sophisticated rear and more aerodynamical front fins The AIM-9B is a very limited weapon, but it had no serious competitors and counters when it was introduced, causing it to be adopted by the USAF and NATO as a standard weapon, with around 80,000 units being produced from 1958 to 1962 [17]\n\n\nAIM-9B Derivatives\nRB24: A Swedish AIM-9B Sidewinder.\n\n\nAIM-9C (AAM-N-7 Sidewinder IC (SARH)) (USN)\nThe lackluster performance of the AIM-9B caused the Navy to look for successor And in 1963 the AAM-N-7 Sidewinder IC was designed, It was developed in two variations: a SARH (semi-active radar homing) variant (AIM-9C) and an IR (AIM-9D) in 1963 The AIM-9C's semi-active radar was exclusively tied to the F-8 Crusader's radar and fire control system (FCS) A total of around 1,000 AIM-9C missiles were launched from 1965 to 1967, but their usage in Vietnam war proved unsuccessful, downing no enemies A filter modification program for reworked units (to allow high altitude capability up to 18,288m (60,000 feet) This was the only planned modification [citation needed]\n\n\nAIM-9D \"Delta\" (AAM-N-7 Sidewinder IC (IR)) (USN)\nRecognizing the limitations of the initial AIM-9B, the US Navy (USN) worked to improve the missile's performance They changed the missile nose to an aerodynamical ogival nose The seeker was improved with a wider field of view beyond 25 degrees and a reduced instantaneous field of view of 2.5 degrees, to reduce foreign thermal interference (from flares) A better nitrogen cooling system was added for the fuze, being the first in the world This enhanced the missile's head sensitivity Maneuverability was also improved with a faster tracking rate, as well as a new actuator system The Sidewinder's range was improved as well, with the new Hercules MK 36 solid-fuel rocket motor allowing the missile to fly up to 18km Finally, a new Mk 48 continuous-rod warhead was fitted to the missile for increased damage; this also meant infrared or a radio proximity fuze could be used These improvements were all added into AIM-9D and went into service with the USN Around 1,000 AIM-9D units were produced from 1965 to 1969 The primary problem of the AIM-9D was breakup during launch The AIM-9D was eventually developed into AIM-9G [18]\n\n\nAIM-9D Derivatives\nATM-9D (USN): AIM-9D used for captive flight target acquisition training [17]\n\n\nAIM-9E \"Echo\" (USAF)\nThe AIM-9E \"Echo\" was the first version developed solely by the U.S Air Force (USAF) The AIM-9E allows the expansion of the weapons acquisition envelope, especially at low-altitude, increasing its Probability of Kill (P [k]) It achieved this using a new low-drag conical nose head, being a distinguishing feature of USAF Sidewinders A magnesium fluoride seeker dome was introduced, along with a more compact optical assembly, an improved guidance control system, new electronics, and significant changes to the internal wiring harnesses These improvements facilitated a better 100 Hz reticle rate, and a 16.5 deg/sec tracking rate The most significant design change was the addition of cooling for the PbS detector, adding Peltier (thermoelectric) cooling, giving the advantage of unlimited cooling when positioned on the launch rail, but is only active when electrical power is present The AIM-9E gives greater range over the AIM-9B, but is worse than the \"D\" The canard design was changed to a squared tip double delta planform, this helped improve canard behaviour at higher angles of attack (AOA) Over 5,000 AIM-9B's were rebuilt into AIM-9E's [17]\n\n\nAIM-9E Variants\nAIM-9E: Standard production model.\n\n\nAIM-9B FGW.2 Sidewinder (AIM-9F)\nAs the Sidewinder was being acquired by NATO forces, licensed production was given to West Germany and they would produce around 15,000 units Like the Americans, the West Germans sought to improve the AIM-9B design due to its limitations The only visible exterior difference is a greenish sensor window, but many tech improvements were added beneath the shell Unnoticed improvements include solid state electronics (instead of vacuum tubes), carbon dioxide seeker cooling, a new nose dome and superior optical filtering Conversions were done to European AIM-9B to upgrade them to the FGW.2 standard The official designation is the AIM-9B FGW.2 but it is known as the AIM-9F in US nomenclature.\n\n\nAIM-9G \"Golf\" (USN)\nThe AIM-9G was very similar to the AIM-9D in most aspects, and did not differ externally The AIM-9G was an AIM-9D that used an improved AIM-9D seeker head with SEAM (Sidewinder Extended Acquisition Mode), this allowed the slewing of the optics through a search pattern to acquire the enemy (most likely using a rosette scan), [citation needed] it also allowed the slaving of the optics to a radar or helmet sight This was connected to the onboard computer of the aircraft, which gave the capability of capturing the target using the data coming from the airborne radar This meant that the target could be locked without being in the sights, and the missile automatically got pre-launch instructions The conical scanning speed was also increased greatly The seeker head was now able to seek in a 25˚ circular scan This allowed the AIM-9G to have an improved chance of acquiring the target than earlier models This, along with other upgraded solid-state modules, culminated in the AIM-9G The improvement was substantial enough that an order of 5,000 AIM-9D seekers was stopped at 1,850 units, with the rest being ordered to AIM-9G seeker specifications instead Around 2120 AIM-9G were built by Raytheon from 1970 to 1972 [17]\n\n\nAIM-9G Derivatives\nATM-9G (USN): AIM-9G used for captive flight target acquisition training [17]\n\n\nAIM-9H (USN)\nWithin December 1965, two designers McLean and LaBerge (who were employed by Philco-Ford) came together to create ways to improve the AIM-9G's reliability One submission was to advance all the remaining missile electronic components from vacuum to solid-state gradually.The US Air Force adhered to this steady replacement of their AIM-9's to solid-state, however the Navy opted for a different approach after Walt Freitag, a USN engineer proposed a full change to solid-state in one missile.\n\n\nAIM-9H Derivatives\nATM-9H: Was a training version of the AIM-9H for captive flight target acquisition [17]\n\n\nAIM-9K (USN)\nThe AIM-9K was a planned U.S Navy (USN) upgrade to the AIM-9H, but the development was abandoned in favour of USAF/USN joint AIM-9L.\n\n\nAIM-9J (USAF)\nAs the AIM-9E Sidewinder was entering service in Southeast Asia during the conclusion of Operation Rolling Thunder, the USAF started the development the next generation Sidewinders to replace the AIM-9E In November 1968, the testing of an AIM-9E upgrade the \"Extended Performance\" began The missile was designed to give pilots a more capable close-range IR missile against a manoeuvring target It would eventually be designated the AIM-9J.\n\n\nAIM-9J Variants\nAIM-9J: The base variant.\n\n\nAIM-9J Derivatives\nRB24J: Swedish designation of the AIM-9J.\n\n\nAIM-9P\nThe AIM-9P Sidewinder missile was a USAF sponsored family of export missiles based on the AIM-9J/N, and would be upgraded multiple times over its lifespan The AIM-9P was an improved AIM-9J with a new motor, fuze and better reliability It included a greater engagement range, allowing it to be launched farther from the target The AIM-9P was more maneuverable than the AIM-9J, and also included improved solid-state electronics that increased reliability and maintainability The AIM-9P was either a rebuilt B/E or J or all-new production  Deliveries of the AIM-9P began in 1978.\n\n\nAIM-9P Variants\nAIM-9P: The base model.\n\n\nLater Generation All-Aspect Variants\nThe next major advance in IR Sidewinder development was the AIM-9L (\"Lima\") model which was in full production in 1977 [21] [23] This was the first \"all-aspect\" Sidewinder with the ability to attack from all directions, including head-on, which had a dramatic effect on close-in combat tactics.\n\n\nAIM-9L (USAF/USN)\nThe next major advance in IR Sidewinder development was the AIM-9L (\"Lima\") model which was in full production in 1977 [21] [23] This was the first \"all-aspect\" Sidewinder with the ability to attack from all directions, including head-on, which had a dramatic effect on close-in combat tactics.\n\n\nAIM-9L Derivatives\nDATM-9L (USAF/USN): This is a AIM-9L used to train ground personnel in missile assembly, disassembly, loading, transportation, and storage procedures and techniques [4]\n\n\nAIM-9M (USAF/USN)\nThe AIM-9M is an improved AIM-9L inheriting the all-aspect capability of the L model, but providing all-around higher performance Having a better background rejection and infrared countermeasures discrimination (WGU-4/B), a low-smoke motor to reduce the visual signature of the weapon, and improved guidance control section with counter-countermeasures and improved maintainability and producibility The AIM-9M uses an annular blast fragmentation warhead These modifications increase ability to locate and lock-on a target and decrease the missile's chances for detection.\n\n\nAIM-9M Variants\nThe AIM-9R was an improved AIM-9M developed by the navy, it included the new WGU-19/B IIR (Imaging Infrared) seeker, with much better tracking performance and detection performance (during daytime), with the ability to reject both background terrain and clouds, a bigger seeker FOV, and more effective counter-countermeasures capability against known and postulated jamming or seduction techniques The first live firing occurred in 1990, but in 1992, production was cancelled as a lack of funding due to defense budget cuts [17]\n\n\nAIM-9M Derivatives\nThe AIM-9R was an improved AIM-9M developed by the navy, it included the new WGU-19/B IIR (Imaging Infrared) seeker, with much better tracking performance and detection performance (during daytime), with the ability to reject both background terrain and clouds, a bigger seeker FOV, and more effective counter-countermeasures capability against known and postulated jamming or seduction techniques The first live firing occurred in 1990, but in 1992, production was cancelled as a lack of funding due to defense budget cuts [17]\n\n\nNATM-9M Variants\nThe AIM-9R was an improved AIM-9M developed by the navy, it included the new WGU-19/B IIR (Imaging Infrared) seeker, with much better tracking performance and detection performance (during daytime), with the ability to reject both background terrain and clouds, a bigger seeker FOV, and more effective counter-countermeasures capability against known and postulated jamming or seduction techniques The first live firing occurred in 1990, but in 1992, production was cancelled as a lack of funding due to defense budget cuts

performance (during daytime), with the ability to reject both background terrain and clouds, a bigger seeker FOV, and more effective counter-countermeasures capability against known and postulated jamming or seduction techniques The first live firing occurred in 1990, but in 1992, production was cancelled as a lack of funding due to defense budget cuts [17]\n\n\nAIM-9S (USN)\nThe AIM-9S is a modified AIM-9M with the counter-countermeasures (CCM) equipment removed from the guidance-control section This derivative is used for FMS (Foreign Military Sales), giving the latest Sidewinder technology, to USA allies, without giving away valuable missile technology A customer of the AIM-9S was Turkey with them having 310 units in 2005 [17]\n\n\nBOA/Box Office\nChina Lake developed an improved compressed carriage control configuration titled BOA \"Compressed carriage\" missiles have smaller control surfaces to allow more missiles to fit in a given space [25] The surfaces may be permanently \"clipped\", or may fold out when the missile is launched.\n\n\nAIM-9X (USAF/USN)\nHughes Electronics was awarded a contract for development of the AIM-9X Sidewinder in 1996 after a competition against Raytheon for the next short-range aerial combat missile, [26] though Raytheon purchased the defense portions of Hughes Electronics the following year [27] The AIM-9X entered service in November 2003 with the USAF (the lead platform was the F-15C) and the USN (the lead platform was the F/A-18C) and is a substantial upgrade to the Sidewinder family featuring an imaging infrared focal-plane array (FPA) seeker with claimed 90° off-boresight capability, compatibility with helmet-mounted displays such as the new U.S Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS), and a totally new two-axis thrust-vectoring control (TVC) system providing increased turn capability over traditional control surfaces (60 g) Using the JHMCS, a pilot can point the AIM-9X missile's seeker and \"lock on\" by simply looking at a target, thereby increasing air combat effectiveness [28] It retains the same rocket motor, fuze and warhead of the AIM-9M, but its lower drag gives it improved range and speed [29] The AIM-9X also includes an internal cooling system, eliminating the need for use of launch-rail nitrogen bottles (U.S Navy and Marines) or internal argon bottles (USAF) It also features an electronic safe and arm device similar to the AMRAAM, allowing for a reduction in minimum range, and reprogrammable infrared Counter Counter Measures (IRCCM) capability that coupled with the FPA provides improved look down into clutter and performance against the latest IRCM Though not part of the original requirement, the AIM-9X demonstrated potential for lock-on after launch capability, allowing for possible internal use for the F-35 Lightning II, F-22 Raptor and even in a submarine-launched configuration for use against ASW platforms [30] The AIM-9X has been tested for a surface attack capability, with mixed results [31]\n\n\nBlock II\nTesting work on the AIM-9X Block II version began in September 2008 [32] The Block II adds lock-on after launch capability with a datalink, so the missile can be launched first and then directed to its target afterwards by an aircraft with the proper equipment for 360-degree engagements, such as the F-35 or the F-22 [33] By January 2013, the AIM-9X Block II was about halfway through its operational testing and performing better than expected NAVAIR reported that the missile was exceeding performance requirements in all areas, including lock-on after launch (LOAL) One area where the Block II needs improvement is helmetless high off-boresight (HHOBS) performance It is functioning well on the missile, but performance is below that of the Block I AIM-9X The HHOBS deficiency does not impact any other Block II capabilities, and is planned to be improved upon by a software clean-up build Objectives of the operational test were due to be completed by the third quarter of 2013 [34] However, as of May 2014 there have been plans to resume operational testing and evaluation (including surface-to-air missile system compatibility) [35] As of June 2013 [update], Raytheon had delivered 5,000 AIM-9X missiles to the armed services [36] On 18 June 2017, after an AIM-9X did not successfully track a targeted Syrian Air Force Su-22 Fitter, US Navy Lt Cmdr Michael \"Mob\" Tremel flying a F/A-18E Super Hornet used an AMRAAM AAM to successfully destroy the enemy aircraft [37] There is a theory that the Sidewinder is tested against American and not Soviet/Russian flares The Sidewinder is used to rejecting American but not Soviet/Russian flares Similar issues arose from the testing of the AIM-9P model The missile would ignore American flares but go for Soviet ones due to their \"different burn time, intensity and separation.\" [38] [39]\n\n\nBlock III\nIn September 2012, Raytheon was ordered to continue developing the Sidewinder into a Block III variant, even though the Block II had not yet entered service The USN projected that the new missile would have a 60 percent longer range, modern components to replace old ones, and an insensitive munitions warhead, which is more stable and less likely to detonate by accident, making it safer for ground crews The need for the AIM-9 to have an increased range was caused by digital radio frequency memory (DRFM) jammers that can blind the onboard radar of an AIM-120D AMRAAM, so the Sidewinder Block III's passive imaging infrared homing guidance system was seen as a useful alternative Although it could supplement the AMRAAM for beyond visual range (BVR) engagements, it would still be capable of performing within visual range (WVR) Modifying the AIM-9X was seen as a cost-effective alternative to developing a new missile in a time of declining budgets To achieve the range increase, the rocket motor would have a combination of increased performance and missile power management The Block III would \"leverage\" the Block II's guidance unit and electronics, including the AMRAAM-derived datalink The Block III was scheduled to achieve initial operational capability (IOC) in 2022, following the increased number of F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters to enter service [41] [42] The Navy pressed for this upgrade in response to a projected threat which analysts have speculated will be due to the difficulty of targeting upcoming Chinese fifth-generation jet fighters (Chengdu J-20, Shenyang J-31) with the radar-guided AMRAAM, [43] specifically that Chinese advances in electronics will mean Chinese fighters will use their AESA radars as jammers to degrade the AIM-120's kill probability [44] However, the Navy's FY 2016 budget canceled the AIM-9X Block III as they cut down buys of the F-35C, as it was primarily intended to permit the fighter to carry six BVR missiles; the insensitive munition warhead will be retained for the AIM-9X program [45]\n\n\nCombat\nThe first combat use of the Sidewinder came on 24 September 1958 by the Republic of China (Taiwan) Air Force during the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis At the time, ROCAF North American F-86 Sabres were routinely engaged in air battles with the People's Republic of China over the Taiwan Strait In similar fashion to Korean War encounters between the F-86 and earlier MiG-15, high-flying PRC MiG-17s cruised above the ROC Sabres, immune to their .50-cal guns and only fighting when conditions favoured them [47]\n\n\nCombat debut: Taiwan Strait, 1958\nThe first combat use of the Sidewinder came on 24 September 1958 by the Republic of China (Taiwan) Air Force during the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis At the time, ROCAF North American F-86 Sabres were

cruised above the ROC Sabres, immune to their .50-cal guns and only fighting when conditions favoured them [47]\n\n\nVietnam War service 1965–1973\nPerformance of the 454 Sidewinders launched [50] during the war was not as satisfactory as hoped Both the USN and USAF studied the performance of their aircrews, aircraft, weapons, training, and supporting infrastructure The USAF conducted the classified Red Baron Report while the Navy conducted a study concentrating primarily on performance of air-to-air weapons that was informally known as the \"Ault Report\" Both services subsequently modified their AIM-9s to improve performance and reliability [51]\n\n\nVietnam War AIM-9 claimed aerial combat kills\nIn total 452 Sidewinders were fired during the Vietnam War, resulting in a kill probability of 0.18 [53]\n\n\n1982 Falklands War\nDuring the Falklands War, the United States Air Force provided the Royal Air Force with 200 units of the AIM-9L Sidewinder air-to-air missile for use on their Harrier jump jets [54] [55] The first combat use of the AIM-9L Sidewinder by British forces occurred on 01 May 1982, when Sea Harriers of the 801 Naval Air Squadron shot down a Mirage III fighter jet of the Argentine Air Force while on combat air patrol protecting the invasion fleet [56] By the end of the war, Sea Harriers armed with AIM-9L Sidewinders had destroyed 23 Argentine aircraft in air to air engagements without losing a single British aircraft to enemy fire [57] The fact that heat seeking Sidewinders were targeting hot jet exhausts against a cold background of the South Atlantic in winter resulted in a lethality rate of over\n80 percent [58]\n\n\n2023 North American balloon & unidentified object shootdowns\nOn 4 February 2023, an F-22 Raptor operated by the United States Air Force used a single AIM-9X missile to shoot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon off the coast of Surfside Beach, South Carolina at an altitude between 60,000 to 65,000 feet (18,000 to 20,000 m) [59] [60] Six days later, another object was shot down near Alaska [61] On 11 and 12 February two more objects were shot down, over Yukon, Canada and Lake Huron in Michigan respectively [62] [63] [64]\n\n\n2023 Israel–Hamas war\nOn 2 November 2023, Israeli Air Force claimed one of its F-35I have shot down an unidentified cruise missile, using an AIM-9X Sidewinder [65]\n\n\nSidewinder descendants\nNaval Air Weapons Station China Lake experimented with Sidewinders in the air-to-ground mode including use as an anti-tank weapon.\nStarting from 2008, the AIM-9X demonstrated its ability

late 2022, the United States and Ukraine began working on a program to adapt older AIM-9M Sidewinders into surface to air missiles, as part of a wider program known as \"FrankenSAM\", [74] in an attempt to better protect Ukraine against Russian airstrikes of \ncritical power infrastructure during the Russo-Ukrainian War [75] On 24 October 2023, a Ukrainian official said: \"Those  [AIM-9] missiles were out of operation...We found a way of launching them  [Sidewinders] from the ground It's a kind of self-made air defence.\" [76]\n\n\nOperators\nPlease note that this list is not

{"title": "\"Weird_Al\"_Yankovic", "content": "\nEarly life\nAlfred Matthew Yankovic was born in Downey, California, on October 23, 1959, [10] the only child of Mary Elizabeth (née Vivalda, 1923–2004) and Nick Yankovic (1917–2004) He was raised in nearby Lynwood, California [11] His father, who was born in the Strawberry Hill neighborhood of Kansas City, Kansas, was of Slovene and Croatian descent: Nick Yankovic was the son of Matthew Yankovich (baptized Matija Jankovič, 1887–1969), who was born in Bedenj, Slovenia, [11] [12] [13] and Mary Yankovich (née Braj, 1890–1968), born in Croatia [14] Nick Yankovic began living in California after earning two Purple Hearts for his service as a medic during World War II [15] [16] [17] He believed \"the key to success\" was \"doing for a living whatever makes you happy\" and often reminded his son of this philosophy [15] Yankovic's mother, a stenographer from Kentucky of English and Italian descent, married his father in 1949 She moved to California a decade before Yankovic was born [15] [17]\n\n\nCareer\nYankovic received his first exposure via syndicated comedy radio personality Dr Demento's Southern California-based radio show, later saying, \"If there hadn't been a Dr Demento, I'd probably have a real job now.\" [24] Despite his mother having caught him listening to Dr Demento's program and banning him from listening to it again, he found ways to hear it discreetly [17] In 1976, Dr Demento spoke at Yankovic's school, where the 16-year-old Yankovic gave him a homemade cassette tape of original and parody songs performed on the accordion in Yankovic's bedroom into a \"cheesy little tape recorder\" The tape's first song, \"Belvedere Cruisin'\" (about his family's Plymouth Belvedere) was played on Demento's comedy radio show, launching Yankovic's career Demento said, \"'Belvedere Cruising' might not have been the very best song I ever heard, but it had some clever lines  [...] I put the tape on the air immediately.\" [15] [25] Yankovic also played at local coffeehouses, accompanied by fellow dorm resident Joel Miller on bongos [26] He recalled in 2007:\n\n\n1976–1981: Dr. Demento and early fame\nYankovic received his first exposure via syndicated comedy radio personality Dr Demento's Southern California-based radio show, later saying, \"If there hadn't been a Dr Demento, I'd probably have a real job now.\" [24] Despite his mother having caught him listening to Dr Demento's program and banning him from listening to it again, he found ways to hear it discreetly [17] In 1976, Dr Demento spoke at Yankovic's school, where the 16-year-old Yankovic gave him a homemade cassette tape of original and parody songs performed on the accordion in Yankovic's bedroom into a \"cheesy little tape recorder\" The tape's first song, \"Belvedere Cruisin'\" (about his family's Plymouth Belvedere) was played on Demento's comedy radio show, launching Yankovic's career Demento said, \"'Belvedere Cruising' might not have been the very best song I ever heard, but it had some clever lines  [...] I put the tape on the air immediately.\" [15] [25] Yankovic also played at local coffeehouses, accompanied by fellow dorm resident Joel Miller on bongos [26] He recalled in 2007:\n\n\n1981–1989: Band and fame\n1981 brought Yankovic on tour for the first time as part of Dr Demento's stage show His stage act in a Phoenix, Arizona, nightclub caught the eye of manager Jay Levey, who was \"blown away\" [15] Levey asked Yankovic if he had considered creating a full band and doing his music as a career Yankovic admitted that he had, so Levey held auditions Steve Jay became Yankovic's bass player, and Jay's friend Jim West played guitar Schwartz continued on drums Yankovic's first show with his new band was on March 31, 1982 [8] Several days later, Yankovic and his band were the opening act for Missing Persons.\n\n\n1990–1997: Revived career\nYankovic had returned to the studio to prepare songs for his next album Off the Deep End around 1990 During production, Rubén Valtierra joined the band on keyboards in 1991, allowing Yankovic to concentrate more on singing and increasing his use of the stage space during concerts Further, Yankovic took over production from Rick Derringer in 1992 While Derringer had produced six of Yankovic's previous albums, for which he won two Grammy Awards, Derringer's drug-related issues had become a problem, along with Yankovic's increasingly more complex musical vision (involving horns and other instruments) [26]\n\n\n1998–2014: New look\nOn January 24, 1998, Yankovic had LASIK eye surgery to correct his extreme myopia [41] Yankovic had the surgery for free when he agreed to let KTLA Morning News broadcast it live on television [42] When Running with Scissors debuted in 1999, he unveiled a radically changed look In addition to shedding his glasses, he had shaved off his moustache and grown out his hair He had previously shaved his moustache in 1983 for the video of \"Ricky\" to resemble Desi Arnaz, in 1989 for segments of the \"UHF\" music video and in 1996 for the \"Amish Paradise\" video Yankovic reasoned, \"If Madonna's allowed to reinvent herself every 15 minutes, I figure I should be good for a change at least once every 20 years.\" [43] He parodied the reaction to this \"new look\" in a commercial for his nonexistent MTV Unplugged special The commercial featured Yankovic in the short-haired wig from the music video for Hanson's \"River\", claiming his new look was an attempt to \"get back to the core of what I'm all about\", that being \"the music\" [44]\n\n\n2015–present: Transition from studio albums\nYankovic said in an interview promoting Mandatory Fun that, with the end of his recording contract, it was likely his last traditional album, in the sense of recording and releasing that many songs at a time; he said he will likely switch to releasing singles and EPs over the Internet, a method which offers more immediate release opportunities, as Yankovic considers his parodies in particular as something that can become dated by the time of release [59] Since Mandatory Fun, Yankovic has not released any additional albums In a 2017 interview with Rolling Stone, Yankovic said, \"I can't tell you when any material is coming out Inspiration could strike tomorrow and I might have something out next month There's no plan It's just going to be whenever it winds up being.\" [60]\n\n\nPersonal life\nYankovic became a vegetarian in 1992 when his girlfriend gave him a copy of the 1987 John Robbins book Diet for a New America, which he said \"made a very compelling argument for a strict vegetarian diet\" [75] [76] When asked how he can rationalize performing shows at events such as the Great American Rib Cook-Off as a vegetarian, he replied, \"The same way I can rationalize playing at a college even though I'm not a student anymore.\" [77] In a 2011 interview with OnMilwaukee, he clarified his stance on his diet, \"I am still a vegetarian, and I try to be a vegan, but I occasionally cheat If there's a cheese pizza on the band bus, I might sneak a piece.\" [78]\n\n\nMusical style\nYankovic is well known for creating parodies of contemporary radio hits, which typically make up about half of his studio releases Unlike other parody artists such as Allan Sherman, Yankovic and his band strive to keep the backing music in his parodies the same as the original, transcribing the original song by ear and re-recording the song for the parody [90] In some cases, after Yankovic has requested that the original band allow his parody, the band will offer to help out with the recreation: Dire Straits members Mark Knopfler and Guy Fletcher perform on \"Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies*\", Yankovic's parody of Dire Straits' \"Money for Nothing\", while Imagine Dragons provided Yankovic with advice on how to recreate some of the electronic sounds they used for \"Radioactive\" in Yankovic's parody \"Inactive\" [91] Yankovic's career in novelty and comedy music has outlasted many of his \"mainstream\" parody targets, such as Toni Basil, MC Hammer, and Men Without Hats [92] [93] Yankovic's continued success (including the top 10 single \"White & Nerdy\" and album Straight Outta Lynwood in 2006) has enabled him to escape the one-hit wonder stigma often associated with novelty music [94]\n\n\nParodies\nYankovic is well known for creating parodies of contemporary radio hits, which typically make up about half of his studio releases Unlike other parody artists such as Allan Sherman, Yankovic and his band strive to keep the backing music in his parodies the same as the original, transcribing the original song by ear and re-recording the song for the parody [90] In some

often associated with novelty music [94]\n\n\nPolka medleys\nMost of Yankovic's studio albums include a polka medley of about a dozen contemporary songs at the time of the album, with the choruses or memorable lines of various songs juxtaposed for humorous effect In Yankovic's early career, before recording his first album, he had performed such polka medleys in live shows in California, though then using songs from lesser-known bands like Bad Brains and the Plasmatics He had been inspired to do so from Spike Jones, who had transitioned from classical music into polka [98] Yankovic said that converting these songs to polka was \"...the way God intended\" [99] Yankovic did not include a medley on his first album, but considered this for his second, In 3-D, recognizing that it would only work if he used well-known songs The resulting \"Polkas on 45\", which featured songs from Devo, Deep Purple, Berlin, and The Beatles, was popular, and the polka medley became a staple of all but one of Yankovic's future albums [98] Yankovic said that \"fans would be rioting in the streets, I think, if I didn't do a polka medley.\" [99] More current polka medleys feature songs that Yankovic had wanted to parody but which had proved difficult, such as Daft Punk's \"Get Lucky\", which lacked sufficient lyrics to parody [98] The polkas are recorded in studio, including the sound effects which are performed live during recording, which Yankovic considered one of his favorite parts of recording [98] In 2018, Yankovic created a medley of songs from the musical Hamilton, \"The Hamilton Polka\".\n\n\nOriginal songs\nYankovic has recorded numerous original humorous songs, such as \"You Don't Love Me Anymore\" and \"One More Minute\" [11] Many of these songs are style pastiches of specific bands with allusions to specific songs For example, \"First World Problems\" from Mandatory Fun is a style take on Pixies, with the opening stanza reminiscent of Pixies' \"Debaser\" [100] Other style parodies includes those of Rage Against the Machine with \"I'll Sue Ya\" (which features many aspects of the hit song \"Killing in the Name\"), Devo with \"Dare to Be Stupid\", The B-52's with \"Mr Popeil\", Talking Heads with \"Dog Eat Dog\", Frank Zappa with \"Genius in France\", Nine Inch Nails with \"Germs\", and Queen with \"Ringtone\" [101] Some songs are pastiches of an overall genre of music, rather than a specific band (for example, country music with \"Good Enough For Now\", charity records with \"Don't Download This Song\" and college fight songs with \"Sports Song\") Yankovic stated that he does not have any unreleased original songs, instead coming up and committing to the song ideas he arrives at for his albums and other releases [102]\n\n\nRecurring themes\nOne of Yankovic's recurring jokes involves the number 27 It is mentioned in the lyrics of several songs, and seen on the covers for Running with Scissors, Poodle Hat [103] and Straight Outta Lynwood He had originally just pulled the number 27 as a random figure to use in filling out lyrics, but as his fans started to notice the reuse of the number after the first few times, he began to purposely drop references to 27 within his lyrics, videos, and album covers He explains that \"It's just a number I started using that people started attaching a lot of importance to.\" [104] Other recurring jokes revolve around the names Bob (the Al TV interviews often mention the name, [105] David Bowe's character in UHF is named Bob, and a song called \"Bob\", done in the style of Bob Dylan, is featured on Poodle Hat), Frank (e.g \"Frank's 2000\" TV\"), and the surname \"Finkelstein\" (e.g the music video for \"I Lost on Jeopardy\", or Fran Drescher's character, Pamela Finkelstein, in UHF) A number of songs use the phrase \"internal organs\" In addition, a hamster called Harvey the Wonder Hamster is a recurring character in The Weird Al Show and the Al TV specials, as well as the subject of an original song on Alapalooza Other recurring jokes include Yankovic borrowing or being owed $5 In a number of Al TV interviews, he often asks if he can borrow $5, being turned down every time This motif also occurs in \"Why Does This Always Happen to Me?\", in which his deceased friend owes him $5 Another recurring joke is his attraction to female nostrils or nostrils in general This also appears in numerous Al TV interviews as well as in several of his songs (such as \"Albuquerque\" and \"Wanna B Ur Lovr\") Yankovic also asks his celebrity guests if they could \"shave his back for a nickel\" This also appears in the song \"Albuquerque\" Yankovic has also put two backmasking messages into his songs The first, in \"Nature Trail to Hell\", said \"Satan Eats Cheez Whiz\"; the second, in \"I Remember Larry\", said \"Wow, you must have an awful lot of free time on your hands.\" [106]\n\n\nMusic videos\nWhile Yankovic's musical parodies generally do not include references to the songs or the artists of the original songs, Yankovic's music videos will sometimes parody the original song's music video in whole or in part [107] Most notably, the video for \"Smells Like Nirvana\" uses an extremely similar set to Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", including using several of the same actors This video contended with \"Smells like Teen Spirit\" at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards for Best Male Video Other videos that draw directly from those of the original song include \"Eat It\", \"Fat\", \"Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies*\", \"Bedrock Anthem\", \"Headline News\", \"It's All About the Pentiums\", \"Amish Paradise\", \"Like a Surgeon\", and \"White & Nerdy\" The video for \"Dare to Be Stupid\" is, as stated by Yankovic, a style parody in general of Devo videos [108]\n\n\nReactions from original artists\nUnder the \"fair use\" provision of U.S copyright law, affirmed by the United States Supreme Court in the 1994 case Campbell v Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., artists such as Yankovic do not need permission to record a parody [115] However, as a personal rule and as a means of maintaining good relationships, Yankovic has always sought permission from the original artist before commercially releasing a parody [115] [98] Yankovic stated of these efforts: \"I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings I don't want to be embroiled in any nastiness That's not how I live my life I like everybody to be in on the joke and be happy for my success I take pains not to burn bridges.\" [26] The communications are typically handled by his manager Jay Levey, but at times Yankovic has asked the artist directly, such as flying to Denver, Colorado, to attend an Iggy Azalea concert and speak to her personally about parodying her song \"Fancy\" [116] He claims that only about two to three percent of the artists he approaches for permission deny his requests [117]\n\n\nPositive\nMany artists parodied by Yankovic have considered this as a rite of passage to show they have made it in the music industry [117] [26]\n\n\nNegative\nOne of Yankovic's most controversial parodies was 1996's \"Amish Paradise\", based on \"Gangsta's Paradise\" by hip-hop artist Coolio, which, in turn, was based on \"Pastime Paradise\" by Stevie Wonder Reportedly, Coolio's label gave Yankovic the impression that Coolio had granted permission to record the parody, but Coolio maintained that he never did While Coolio claimed he was upset, legal action never materialized, and Coolio accepted royalty payments for the song After this controversy, Yankovic has always made sure to speak directly with the artist of every song he parodied At the XM Satellite Radio booth at the 2006 Consumer Electronics Show, Yankovic and Coolio made peace On his website, Yankovic wrote of this event, \"I don't remember what we said to each other exactly, but it was all very friendly I doubt I'll be invited to Coolio's next birthday party, but at least I can stop wearing that bulletproof vest to the mall.\" [132] In an interview in 2014, Coolio extended his apology for refusing his permission, stating that at the time \"I was being cocky and shit and being stupid and I was wrong and I should've embraced that shit and went with it\", and that he considered Yankovic's parody \"actually funny as shit\" [133]\n\n\nRefused parodies\nOn numerous occasions, Prince refused Yankovic permission to record parodies of his songs Yankovic had stated in interviews prior to Prince's death in 2016 that he had \"approached him every few years  [to] see if he's lightened up\" [136] Yankovic related one story where, before the American Music Awards where he and Prince were assigned to sit in the same row, he got a telegram from Prince's management company, demanding he not even make eye contact with the artist [117] Among parodies that Yankovic had ideas for included one based on \"Let's Go Crazy\" about The Beverly Hillbillies, \"Yellow Snow\" as a parody of \"Purple Rain\", \"1999\" as an infomercial with a call-in number ending in −1999, and parodies of \"Kiss\" and \"When Doves Cry\" [118] Despite these refusals, Yankovic was able to gain permission to parody the \"When Doves Cry\" video as part of his music video for the song \"UHF\" [137] He was also permitted to write the song \"Traffic Jam\" from his album Alapalooza, which is in the style of \"Let's Go Crazy\" [138]\n\n\nLive performances\nYankovic often describes his live concert performances as \"a rock and comedy multimedia extravaganza\" [145] with an audience that \"ranges from toddlers to geriatrics\" [96] Apart from Yankovic and his band performing his classic and contemporary hits, staples of Yankovic's live performances include a medley of parodies, many costume changes between songs, and a video screen on which various clips are played during the costume changes [145] A concert from Yankovic's 1999 tour, \"Touring with Scissors\", for the Running with Scissors album was released on VHS in 1999 and on DVD in 2000 [6] Titled \"Weird Al\" Yankovic Live!, the concert was recorded at the Marin County Civic Center in San Rafael, California, on October 2, 1999 [146] For legal reasons, video clips (apart from those for Yankovic's own music videos) could not be shown for the home release, and unreleased parodies were removed from the parody medley for the performance [147]\n\n\nLegacy and influence\nWith \"Word Crimes\" from Mandatory Fun debuting at No 39 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2014, Yankovic became the third musical artist after Michael Jackson and Madonna to have a song in the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 over each decade since the 1980s, his other Top 40 songs being \"Eat It\", \"Smells Like Nirvana\", and \"White & Nerdy\" [160] Since then, only U2 and Kenny G have also entered this group [161] Billboard named Yankovic #15 of the top 100 music video artists of all time in an August 2020 compilation, addressing that alongside his musical fame, \"his accompanying video parodies are a vital part of the recipe\" [162]\n\n\nOther works\nIn 1989, Yankovic starred in a full-length feature film called UHF, co-written by himself and manager Jay Levey and filmed in Tulsa, Oklahoma A satire of the television and film industries, also starring Michael Richards, Fran Drescher, and Victoria Jackson, it brought floundering studio Orion their highest test scores since the film RoboCop [165] However, it was unsuccessful in theaters due to both poor critical reception and competition from other summer blockbusters at the time such as Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Lethal Weapon 2, Batman and Licence to Kill [166] The failure of the film left Yankovic in a three-year slump, which was later broken by his inspiration to compose \"Smells Like Nirvana\" [40]\n\n\nFilms\nIn 1989, Yankovic starred in a full-length feature film called UHF, co-written by himself and manager Jay Levey and filmed in Tulsa, Oklahoma A satire of the television

The Al Yankovic Story, a fictional biographical film that parodies other films based on musicians; Yankovic (played by Aaron Paul) is seen hiding his \"weirdness\" from his parents (Gary Cole and Mary Steenburgen), making it big using song parodies with the help of Dr Demento (Patton Oswalt), falling in and out of love with Madonna (Olivia Wilde), and fading into alcoholism and being arrested, at which point his father finally admits he is \"weird\" as well Yankovic himself plays a music producer in the short [48] [172] [173] [174] Yankovic and Appel announced in January 2022 that they would be making a full-length biopic of the same name based on the trailer, starring Daniel Radcliffe as Yankovic, Evan Rachel Wood as Madonna, and Rainn Wilson as Dr Demento [175] The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2022, and was released on the Roku Channel in November 2022 The film's soundtrack album includes several re-recorded parodies featured in the film along with an original song \"Now You Know\" [176] Among other nominations and awards, the film won the Best Television Movie at the 75th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards [177]\n\n\nLive television\nIn 2012, Yankovic extensively featured in the sixth-season episode of 30 Rock, \"Kidnapped by Danger\", in which Jenna Maroney desperately tries to come up with a \"'Weird Al'-proof\" song [178]  In 2014, he performed at the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards, singing a comedic medley of songs based on the themes of several Emmy-nominated shows, including Mad Men and Game of Thrones [179]\n\n\nAnimation and voice work\nYankovic has done voice-overs for several animated series He appeared in a 2003 episode of The Simpsons, singing \"The Ballad of Homer & Marge\" (a parody of John Mellencamp's \"Jack & Diane\") with his band The episode, \"Three Gays of the Condo\", in which Marge hires Yankovic to sing the aforementioned song to Homer in an attempt to reconcile their marriage, later won an Emmy Award for \"Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming Less Than One Hour)\" Yankovic also had a cameo in a 2008 episode, titled \"That '90s Show\", during which he records a parody of Homer's grunge hit \"Shave Me\" titled \"Brain Freeze\" (Homer's song, \"Shave Me\", was itself a parody of Nirvana's \"Rape Me\") making Yankovic one of only a handful of celebrities to appear twice on the show playing themselves.\n\n\nWeb media\nIn 2008, Weird Al joined Michael J Nelson as a guest on the RiffTrax audio commentary of Jurassic Park On November 10, 2009, Weird Al was a guest \"internet scientist\" on Rocketboom's \"Know Your Meme\" video series, in the installment on the topic of Auto-Tune, hosted by Jamie Wilkinson Yankovic later appeared in another Funny or Die short alongside Huey Lewis which parodied the ax murder scene in the film American Psycho, in which Christian Bale's character Patrick Bateman discusses the nature of Lewis's musical work before killing his victim [189] [190]\n\n\nDirecting\nYankovic has directed many of his own music videos; he has directed all of his music videos from 1993's \"Bedrock Anthem\" to 2006's \"White & Nerdy\" He also directed the end sequence of 1986's \"Christmas at Ground Zero\" (an original piece juxtaposing Christmas with nuclear warfare) from his Polka Party! album and the title sequence to Spy Hard, for which he sang the title song [196]\n\n\nBooks\nYankovic wrote When I Grow Up, a children's book released on February 1, 2011, and published by HarperCollins [203] The book features 8-year-old Billy presenting to his class the wide variety of imaginative career possibilities that he is considering Yankovic stated that the idea for the book was based on his own \"circuitous\" career path [204] The book allows Yankovic to apply the humorous writing style found in his music in another medium, allowing him to use puns and rhymes [204] Yankovic worked with HarperCollins' editor Anne Hoppe—the first time that Yankovic has had an editor—and found her help to be a positive experience [204] The book is illustrated by Wes Hargis, who, according to Yankovic, has \"a childlike quality and a very fun quality and a very imaginative quality\" that matched well with Yankovic's writing [204] The book reached the No 4 position on The New York Times Best Seller list for Children's Picture Books for the week of February 20, 2011 [205]\n\n\nOther media\nYankovic competed on a week of Wheel of Fortune taped at Disney's Hollywood Studios in March 1994 [209] He also competed on Rock & Roll Jeopardy!\n\n\nMisattribution and imitators\nSongs posted to file-sharing networks are often misattributed to him because of their humorous subject matter Often, his surname is misspelled (and thus mispronounced) as \"Yankovich\", among other variations Much to the disdain of Yankovic, these misattributed files include songs that are racist, sexually explicit, or otherwise offensive A young listener who had heard several of these offensive tracks by way of a file-sharing service confronted Yankovic online, threatening a boycott because of his supposedly explicit lyrics [221] Quite a few of the songs, such as \"Star Wars Cantina\" by Mark Jonathan Davis (not, in a double misattribution, his lounge-singer character Richard Cheese), \"Star Wars Gangsta Rap\", \"Yoda Smokes Weed\", \"Chewbacca\", \"The Devil Went to Jamaica\", and several more have a Star Wars motif [222] Some songs misattributed to him are not songs, but spoken skits, such as \"Sesame Street on Crack\", which is also widely misattributed to Adam Sandler A list of songs frequently misattributed to Yankovic can be found at The Not Al Page [222] and a list of all commercially released songs recorded by Yankovic can be found on his website [223]\n\n\nFan-driven campaigns\nThe Weird Al Star Fund was a campaign started by Yankovic's fans to get him a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame Their mission was

"article": "# Introduction\n\n\"Weird Al\" Yankovic is an American singer, songwriter, parodist, and record producer known for his humorous songs that make fun of popular culture. Born on October 23, 1959, in Downey, California, Yankovic has been making people laugh with his music for over four decades. With his unique blend of humor and music, he has become a beloved figure in the entertainment industry.\n\n# Early Life\n\nAlfred Matthew Yankovic was born in Downey, California, to Mary Elizabeth and Nick Yankovic. His father, Nick, was a medic during World War II and earned two Purple Hearts. Yankovic's mother, Mary, was a stenographer from Kentucky. Yankovic's parents instilled in him a love of music and comedy, which would later become the foundation of his career.\n\nYankovic grew up in the nearby town of Lynwood, California. As a child, he was fascinated by comedy and music, and he began to develop his skills as a musician and comedian. He started to write his own songs and create his own comedy routines. Yankovic's parents encouraged his creativity and supported his aspirations.\n\n# Career\n\nYankovic's career in music began in the 1970s, when he started to create parody songs of popular hits. He was heavily influenced by Dr. Demento, a radio personality who played comedy music on his show. Yankovic's first exposure to Dr. Demento's show was through a homemade cassette tape that he had created, featuring his own parody songs. Dr. Demento was impressed by Yankovic's talent and offered him a spot on his show.\n\nYankovic's first album, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic in 3-D, was released in 1984. The album was a commercial success, and it established Yankovic as a rising star in the comedy music scene. He continued to release albums throughout the 1980s and 1990s, each one more successful than the last.\n\n## 1976-1981: Dr. Demento and Early Fame\n\nYankovic received his first exposure via Dr. Demento's Southern California-based radio show, later saying, \"If there hadn't been a Dr. Demento, I'd probably have a real job now.\" Despite his mother having caught him listening to Dr. Demento's program and banning him from listening to it again, he found ways to hear it discreetly. In 1976, Dr. Demento spoke at Yankovic's school, where the 16-year-old Yankovic gave him a homemade cassette tape of original and parody songs performed on the accordion in Yankovic's bedroom into a \"cheesy little tape recorder.\" The tape's first song, \"Belvedere Cruising,\" was played on Dr. Demento's comedy radio show, launching Yankovic's career.\n\n## 1981-1989: Band and Fame\n\nIn 1981, Yankovic went on tour for the first time as part of Dr. Demento's stage show. His stage act in a Phoenix, Arizona, nightclub caught the eye of manager Jay Levey, who was \"blown away.\" Levey asked Yankovic if he had considered creating a full band and doing his music as a career. Yankovic admitted that he had, so Levey held auditions. Steve Jay became Yankovic's bass player, and Jay's friend Jim West played guitar. Schwartz continued on drums. Yankovic's first show with his new band was on March 31, 1982. Several days later, Yankovic and his band were the opening act for Missing Persons.\n\n## 1990-1997: Revived Career\n\nIn 1990, Yankovic returned to the studio to prepare songs for his next album, Off the Deep End. During production, Rubén Valtierra joined the band on keyboards in 1991, allowing Yankovic to concentrate more on singing and increasing his use of the stage space during concerts. Further, Yankovic took over production from Rick Derringer in 1992. While Derringer had produced six of Yankovic's previous albums, for which he won two Grammy Awards, Derringer's drug-related issues had become a problem, along with Yankovic's increasingly more complex musical vision (involving horns and other instruments).\n\n## 1998-2014: New Look\n\nOn January 24, 1998, Yankovic had LASIK eye surgery to correct his extreme myopia. Yankovic had the surgery for free when he agreed to let KTLA Morning News broadcast it live on television. When Running with Scissors debuted in 1999, he unveiled a radically changed look. In addition to shedding his glasses, he had shaved off his moustache and grown out his hair. He had previously shaved his moustache in 1983 for the video of \"Ricky\" to resemble Desi Arnaz, in 1989 for segments of the \"UHF\" music video and in 1996 for the \"Amish Paradise\" video. Yankovic reasoned, \"If Madonna's allowed to reinvent herself every 15 minutes, I figure I should be good for a change at least once every 20 years.\"\n\n# Parodies\n\nYankovic is well known for creating parodies of contemporary radio hits, which typically make up about half of his studio releases. Unlike other parody artists such as Allan Sherman, Yankovic and his band strive to keep the backing music in his parodies the same as the original, transcribing the original song by ear and re-recording the song for the parody. In some cases, after Yankovic has requested that the original band allow his parody, the band will offer to help out with the recreation: Dire Straits members Mark Knopfler and Guy Fletcher perform on \"Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies*\" (Yankovic's parody of Dire Straits' \"Money for Nothing\"), while Imagine Dragons provided Yankovic with advice on how to recreate some of the electronic sounds they used for \"Radioactive\" in Yankovic's parody \"Inactive\".\n\n# Polka Medleys\n\nMost of Yankovic's studio albums include a polka medley of about a dozen contemporary songs at the time of the album, with the choruses or memorable lines of various songs juxtaposed for humorous effect. In Yankovic's early career, before recording his first album, he had performed such polka medleys in live shows in California, though then using songs from lesser-known bands like Bad Brains and the Plasmatics. He had been inspired to do so from Spike Jones, who had transitioned from classical music into polka. Yankovic said that converting these songs to polka was \"...the way God intended.\" Yankovic did not include a medley on his first album, but considered this for his second, In 3-D, recognizing that it would only work if he used well-known songs. The resulting \"Polkas on 45,\" which featured songs from Devo, Deep Purple, Berlin, and The Beatles, was popular, and the polka medley became a staple of all but one of Yankovic's future albums.\n\n# Original Songs\n\nYankovic has recorded numerous original humorous songs, such as \"You Don't Love Me Anymore\" and \"One More Minute.\" Many of these songs are style pastiches of specific bands with allusions to specific songs. For example, \"First World Problems\" from Mandatory Fun is a style take on Pixies, with the opening stanza reminiscent of Pixies' \"Debaser.\" Other style parodies includes those of Rage Against the Machine with \"I'll Sue Ya\" (which features many aspects of the hit song \"Killing in the Name\"), Devo with \"Dare to Be Stupid,\" The B-52's with \"Mr Popeil,\" Talking Heads with \"Dog Eat Dog,\" Frank Zappa with \"Genius in France,\" Nine Inch Nails with \"Germs,\" and Queen with \"Ringtone.\" Some songs are pastiches of an overall genre of music, rather than a specific band (for example, country music with \"Good Enough For Now,\" charity records with \"Don't Download This Song\" and college fight songs with \"Sports Song\").\n\n# Live Performances\n\nYankovic often describes his live concert performances as \"a rock and comedy multimedia extravaganza\" with an audience that \"ranges from toddlers to geriatrics.\" Apart from Yankovic and his band performing his classic and contemporary hits, staples of Yankovic's live performances include a medley of parodies, many costume changes between songs, and a video screen on which various clips are played during the costume changes. A concert from Yankovic's 1999 tour, \"Touring with Scissors,\" for the Running with Scissors album was released on VHS in 1999 and on DVD in 2000, titled \"Weird Al\" Yankovic Live!\n\n# Legacy and Influence\n\nWith \"Word Crimes\" from Mandatory Fun debuting at No 39 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2014, Yankovic became the third musical artist after Michael Jackson and Madonna to have a song in the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 over each decade since the 1980s, his other Top 40 songs being \"Eat It,\" \"Smells Like Nirvana,\" and \"White & Nerdy.\" Since then, only U2 and Kenny G have also entered this group. Billboard named Yankovic #15 of the top 100 music video artists of all time in an August 2020 compilation, addressing that alongside his musical fame, \"his accompanying video parodies are a vital part of the recipe.\"\n\n# Other Works\n\nIn 1989, Yankovic starred in a full-length feature film called UHF, co-written by himself and manager Jay Levey and filmed in Tulsa, Oklahoma. A satire of the television and film industries, the film also starred Michael Richards, Fran Drescher, and Victoria Jackson. Yankovic also wrote and directed the music video for the film's title song. In 2010, Eric Appel produced a Funny or Die trailer for Weird: The Al Yankovic Story, a fictional biographical film that parodies other films based on musicians. The trailer features Yankovic (played by Aaron Paul) hiding his \"weirdness\" from his parents, making it big using song parodies with the help of Dr. Demento (Patton Oswalt), falling in and out of love with Madonna (Olivia Wilde), and fading into alcoholism and being arrested, at which point his father finally admits he is \"weird\" as well. Yankovic and Appel announced in January 2022 that they would be making a full-length biopic of the same name based on the trailer, starring Daniel Radcliffe as Yankovic, Evan Rachel Wood as Madonna, and Rainn Wilson as Dr. Demento.\n\n# Books\n\nIn 2011, Yankovic wrote a children's book called When I Grow Up, which features 8-year-old Billy presenting to his class the wide variety of imaginative career possibilities that he is considering. Yankovic stated that the idea for the book was based on his own \"circuitous\" career path. The book allows Yankovic to apply the humorous writing style found in his music in another medium, allowing him to use puns and rhymes. Yankovic worked with HarperCollins' editor Anne Hoppe, the first time that Yankovic has had an editor, and found her help to be a positive experience. The book is illustrated by Wes Hargis, who, according to Yankovic, has \"a childlike quality and a very fun quality and a very imaginative quality\" that matched well with Yankovic's writing. The book reached the No 4 position on The New York Times Best Seller list for Children's Picture Books for the week of February 20, 2011.\n\n# Fan-Driven Campaigns\n\nThe Weird Al Star Fund was a campaign started by Yankovic's fans to get him a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Their mission was to \"solicit, collect, and raise the necessary money, and to compile the information needed for the application to nominate \"Weird Al\" Yankovic for a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\" Fans worldwide have sent donations to raise the US$40,000 needed for a nomination. In addition to the preferred method of cash donations, many methods were used to raise money for the cause, such as a live benefit show held April 11, 2006, and selling merchandise on the official website and eBay, including T-shirts, calendars, and cookbooks. On May 26, 2006, the campaign hit the then-$15,000 target, just five days before the May 31 deadline to submit the necessary paperwork. However, Yankovic was not included on the list of inductees for 2007. On February 9, 2007, the Hollywood Chamber Of Commerce raised the price to sponsor a new star to $25,000. Yankovic's application was resubmitted for consideration in 2007, but he was not included among 2008's inductees. In December 2010, the price was raised again to $30,000, and in 2017 the price was raised to $40,000. The campaign raised the new target each time and applications continued to be submitted yearly, until The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce announced in June 2017 that Yankovic would receive a star on the Walk of Fame as one of the 2018 inductees. In an official induction ceremony on August 27, 2018, Al received the 2,643rd star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The star is located at 6914 Hollywood Blvd, directly across the street from TCL Chinese Theatre. The ceremony was attended by 1,500 fans.\n\n# Awards and Nominations\n\nYankovic has received numerous awards and nominations throughout his career, including Grammy Awards, American Music Awards, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

life\nAlfred Matthew Yankovic was born in Downey, California, on October 23, 1959, [10] the only child of Mary Elizabeth (née Vivalda, 1923–2004) and Nick Yankovic (1917–2004) He was raised in nearby Lynwood, California [11] His father, who was born in the Strawberry Hill neighborhood of Kansas City, Kansas, was of Slovene and Croatian descent: Nick Yankovic was the son of Matthew Yankovich (baptized Matija Jankovič, 1887–1969), who was born in Bedenj, Slovenia, [11] [12] [13] and Mary Yankovich (née Braj, 1890–1968), born in Croatia [14] Nick Yankovic began living in California after earning two Purple Hearts for his service as a medic during World War II [15] [16] [17] He believed \"the key to success\" was \"doing for a living whatever makes you happy\" and often reminded his son of this philosophy [15] Yankovic's mother, a stenographer from Kentucky of English and Italian descent, married his father in 1949 She moved to California a decade before Yankovic was born [15] [17]\n\n\nCareer\nYankovic received his first exposure via syndicated comedy radio personality Dr Demento's Southern California-based radio show, later saying, \"If there hadn't been a Dr Demento, I'd probably have a real job now.\" [24] Despite his mother having caught him listening to Dr Demento's program and banning him from listening to it again, he found ways to hear it discreetly [17] In

\"cheesy little tape recorder\" The tape's first song, \"Belvedere Cruisin'\" (about his family's Plymouth Belvedere) was played on Demento's comedy radio show, launching Yankovic's career Demento said, \"'Belvedere Cruising' might not have been the very best song I ever heard, but it had some clever lines  [...] I put the tape on the air immediately.\" [15] [25] Yankovic also played at local coffeehouses, accompanied by fellow dorm resident Joel Miller on bongos [26] He recalled in 2007:\n\n\n1976–1981: Dr. Demento and early fame\nYankovic received his first exposure via syndicated comedy radio personality Dr Demento's Southern California-based radio show, later saying, \"If there hadn't been a Dr Demento, I'd probably have a real job now.\" [24] Despite his mother having caught him

recalled in 2007:\n\n\n1981–1989: Band and fame\n1981 brought Yankovic on tour for the first time as part of Dr Demento's stage show His stage act in a Phoenix, Arizona, nightclub caught the eye of manager Jay Levey, who was \"blown away\" [15] Levey asked Yankovic if he had considered creating a full band and doing his music as a career Yankovic admitted that he had, so Levey held auditions Steve Jay became Yankovic's bass player, and Jay's friend Jim West played guitar Schwartz continued on drums Yankovic's first show with his new band was on March 31, 1982 [8] Several days later, Yankovic and his band were the opening act for Missing Persons.\n\n\n1990–1997: Revived career\nYankovic had returned to the studio to prepare songs for his next album Off the Deep End around 1990 During production, Rubén Valtierra joined the band on keyboards in 1991, allowing Yankovic to concentrate more on singing and increasing his use of the stage space during concerts Further, Yankovic took over production from Rick Derringer in 1992 While Derringer had produced six of Yankovic's previous albums, for which he won two Grammy Awards, Derringer's drug-related issues had become a problem, along with Yankovic's increasingly more complex musical vision (involving horns and other instruments) [26]\n\n\n1998–2014: New look\nOn January 24, 1998, Yankovic had LASIK eye surgery to correct his extreme myopia [41] Yankovic had the surgery for free when he agreed to let KTLA Morning News broadcast it live on television [42] When Running with Scissors debuted in 1999, he unveiled a radically changed look In addition to shedding his glasses, he had shaved off his moustache and grown out his hair He had previously shaved his moustache in 1983 for the video of \"Ricky\" to resemble Desi Arnaz, in 1989 for segments of the \"UHF\" music video and in 1996 for the \"Amish Paradise\" video Yankovic reasoned, \"If Madonna's allowed to reinvent herself every 15 minutes, I figure I should be good for a change at least once every 20 years.\" [43] He parodied the reaction to this \"new look\" in a commercial for his nonexistent MTV Unplugged special The commercial featured Yankovic in the short-haired wig from the music video for Hanson's \"River\", claiming his new look was an attempt to \"get back to the core of what I'm all about\", that being \"the music\" [44]\n\n\n2015–present: Transition from studio albums\nYankovic said in an interview promoting Mandatory Fun that, with the end of his recording contract, it was likely his last traditional album, in the sense of recording and releasing that many songs at a time; he said he will likely switch to releasing singles and EPs over the Internet, a method which offers more immediate release opportunities, as Yankovic considers his parodies in particular as something that can become dated by the time of release [59] Since Mandatory Fun, Yankovic has not released any additional albums In a 2017 interview with Rolling Stone, Yankovic said, \"I can't tell you when any material is coming out Inspiration could strike tomorrow and I might have something out next month There's no plan It's just going to be whenever it winds up being.\" [60]\n\n\nPersonal life\nYankovic became a vegetarian in 1992 when his girlfriend gave him a copy of the 1987 John Robbins book Diet for a New America, which he said \"made a very compelling argument for a strict vegetarian diet\" [75] [76] When asked how he can rationalize performing shows at events such as the Great American Rib Cook-Off as a vegetarian, he replied, \"The same way I can rationalize playing at a college even though I'm not a student anymore.\" [77] In a 2011 interview with OnMilwaukee, he clarified his stance on his diet, \"I am still a vegetarian, and I try to be a vegan, but I occasionally cheat If there's a cheese pizza on the band bus, I might sneak a piece.\" [78]\n\n\nMusical style\nYankovic is well known for creating parodies of contemporary radio hits, which typically make up about half of his studio releases Unlike other parody artists such as Allan Sherman, Yankovic and his band strive to keep the backing music in his parodies the same as the original, transcribing the original song by ear and re-recording the song for the parody [90] In some cases, after Yankovic has requested that the original band allow his parody, the band will offer to help out with the recreation: Dire Straits members Mark Knopfler and Guy Fletcher perform on \"Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies*\", Yankovic's parody of Dire Straits' \"Money for Nothing\", while Imagine Dragons provided Yankovic with advice on how to recreate some of the electronic sounds they used for \"Radioactive\" in Yankovic's parody \"Inactive\" [91] Yankovic's career in novelty and comedy music has outlasted many of his \"mainstream\" parody targets, such as Toni Basil, MC Hammer, and Men Without Hats [92] [93] Yankovic's continued success (including the top 10 single \"White & Nerdy\" and album Straight Outta Lynwood in 2006) has enabled him to escape the one-hit wonder stigma often associated with novelty music [94]\n\n\nParodies\nYankovic is well known for creating parodies of contemporary radio hits, which typically make up about half of his studio releases Unlike other parody artists such as Allan

of Yankovic's future albums [98] Yankovic said that \"fans would be rioting in the streets, I think, if I didn't do a polka medley.\" [99] More current polka medleys feature songs that Yankovic had wanted to parody but which had proved difficult, such as Daft Punk's \"Get Lucky\", which lacked sufficient lyrics to parody [98] The polkas are recorded in studio, including the sound effects which are performed live during recording, which Yankovic considered one of his favorite parts of recording [98] In 2018, Yankovic created a medley of songs from the musical Hamilton, \"The Hamilton Polka\".\n\n\nOriginal songs\nYankovic has recorded numerous original humorous songs, such as \"You Don't Love Me Anymore\" and \"One More Minute\" [11] Many of these songs are style pastiches of specific bands with allusions to specific songs For example, \"First World Problems\" from Mandatory Fun is a style take on Pixies, with the opening stanza reminiscent of Pixies' \"Debaser\" [100] Other style parodies includes those of Rage Against the Machine with \"I'll Sue Ya\" (which features many aspects of the hit song \"Killing in the Name\"), Devo with \"Dare to Be Stupid\", The B-52's with \"Mr Popeil\", Talking Heads with \"Dog Eat Dog\", Frank Zappa with \"Genius in France\", Nine Inch Nails with \"Germs\", and Queen with \"Ringtone\" [101] Some songs are pastiches of an overall genre of music, rather than a specific band (for example, country music with \"Good Enough For Now\", charity records with \"Don't Download This Song\" and college fight songs with \"Sports Song\") Yankovic stated that he does not have any unreleased original songs, instead coming up and committing to the song ideas he arrives at for his albums and other releases [102]\n\n\nRecurring themes\nOne of Yankovic's recurring jokes involves the number 27 It is mentioned in the lyrics of several songs, and seen on the covers for Running with Scissors, Poodle Hat [103] and Straight Outta Lynwood He had originally just pulled the number 27 as a random figure to use in filling out lyrics, but as his fans started to notice the reuse of the number after the first few times, he began to purposely drop references to 27 within his lyrics, videos, and album covers He explains that \"It's just a number I started using that people started attaching a lot of importance to.\" [104] Other recurring jokes revolve around the names Bob (the Al TV interviews often mention the name, [105] David Bowe's character in UHF is named Bob, and a song called \"Bob\", done in the style of Bob Dylan, is featured on Poodle Hat), Frank (e.g \"Frank's 2000\" TV\"), and the surname \"Finkelstein\" (e.g the music video for \"I Lost on Jeopardy\", or Fran Drescher's character, Pamela Finkelstein, in UHF) A number of songs use the phrase \"internal organs\" In addition, a hamster called Harvey the Wonder Hamster is a recurring character in The Weird Al Show and the Al TV specials, as well as the subject of an original song on Alapalooza Other recurring jokes include Yankovic borrowing or being owed $5 In a number of Al TV interviews, he often asks if he can borrow $5, being turned down every time This motif also occurs in \"Why Does This Always Happen to Me?\", in which his deceased friend owes him $5 Another recurring joke is his attraction to female nostrils or nostrils in general This also appears in numerous Al TV interviews as well as in several of his songs (such as \"Albuquerque\" and \"Wanna B Ur Lovr\") Yankovic also asks his celebrity guests if they could \"shave his back for a nickel\" This also appears in the song \"Albuquerque\" Yankovic has also put two backmasking messages into his songs The first, in \"Nature Trail to Hell\", said \"Satan Eats Cheez Whiz\"; the second, in \"I Remember Larry\", said \"Wow, you must have an awful lot of free time on your hands.\" [106]\n\n\nMusic videos\nWhile Yankovic's musical parodies generally do not include references to the songs or the artists of the original songs, Yankovic's music videos will sometimes parody the original song's music video in whole or in part [107] Most notably, the video for \"Smells Like Nirvana\" uses an extremely similar set to Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", including using several of the same actors This video contended with \"Smells like Teen Spirit\" at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards for Best Male Video Other videos that draw directly from those of the original song include \"Eat It\", \"Fat\", \"Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies*\", \"Bedrock Anthem\", \"Headline News\", \"It's All About the Pentiums\", \"Amish Paradise\", \"Like a Surgeon\", and \"White & Nerdy\" The video for \"Dare to Be Stupid\" is, as stated by Yankovic, a style parody in general of Devo videos [108]\n\n\nReactions from original artists\nUnder the \"fair use\" provision of U.S copyright law, affirmed by the United States Supreme Court in the 1994 case Campbell v Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., artists such as Yankovic do not need permission to record a parody [115] However, as a personal rule and as a means of maintaining good relationships, Yankovic has always sought permission from the original artist before commercially releasing a parody [115] [98] Yankovic stated of these efforts: \"I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings I don't want to be embroiled in any nastiness That's not how I live my life I like everybody to be in on the joke and be happy for my success I take pains not to burn bridges.\" [26] The communications are typically handled by his manager Jay Levey, but at times Yankovic has asked the artist directly, such as flying to Denver, Colorado, to attend an Iggy Azalea concert and speak to her personally about parodying her song \"Fancy\" [116] He claims that only about two to three percent of the artists he approaches for permission deny his requests [117]\n\n\nPositive\nMany artists parodied by Yankovic have considered this as a rite of passage to show they have made it in the music industry [117] [26]\n\n\nNegative\nOne of Yankovic's most controversial parodies was 1996's \"Amish Paradise\", based on \"Gangsta's Paradise\" by hip-hop artist Coolio, which, in turn, was based on \"Pastime Paradise\" by Stevie Wonder Reportedly, Coolio's label gave Yankovic the impression that Coolio had granted permission to record the parody, but Coolio maintained that he never did While Coolio claimed he was upset, legal action never materialized, and Coolio accepted royalty payments for the song After this controversy, Yankovic has always made sure to speak directly with the artist of every song he parodied At the XM Satellite Radio booth at the 2006 Consumer Electronics Show, Yankovic and Coolio made peace On his website, Yankovic wrote of this event, \"I don't remember what we said to each other exactly, but it was all very friendly I doubt I'll be invited to Coolio's next birthday party, but at least I can stop wearing that bulletproof vest to the mall.\" [132] In an interview in 2014, Coolio extended his apology for refusing his permission, stating that at the time \"I was being cocky and shit and being stupid and I was wrong and I should've embraced that shit and went with it\", and that he considered Yankovic's parody \"actually funny as shit\" [133]\n\n\nRefused parodies\nOn numerous occasions, Prince refused Yankovic permission to record parodies of his songs Yankovic had stated in interviews prior to Prince's death in 2016 that he had \"approached him every few years  [to] see if he's lightened up\" [136] Yankovic related one story where, before the American Music Awards where he and Prince were assigned to sit in the same row, he got a telegram from Prince's management company, demanding he not even make eye contact with the artist [117] Among parodies that Yankovic had ideas for included one based on \"Let's Go Crazy\" about The Beverly Hillbillies, \"Yellow Snow\" as a parody of \"Purple Rain\", \"1999\" as an infomercial with a call-in number ending in −1999, and parodies of \"Kiss\" and \"When Doves Cry\" [118] Despite these refusals, Yankovic was able to gain permission to parody the \"When Doves Cry\" video as part of his music video for the song \"UHF\" [137] He was also permitted to write the song \"Traffic Jam\" from his album Alapalooza, which is in the style of \"Let's Go Crazy\" [138]\n\n\nLive performances\nYankovic often describes his live concert performances as \"a rock and comedy multimedia extravaganza\" [145] with an audience that \"ranges from toddlers to geriatrics\" [96] Apart from Yankovic and his band performing his classic and contemporary hits, staples of Yankovic's live performances include a medley of parodies, many costume changes between songs, and a video screen on which various clips are played during the costume changes [145] A concert from Yankovic's 1999 tour, \"Touring with Scissors\", for the Running with Scissors album was released on VHS in 1999 and on DVD in 2000 [6] Titled \"Weird Al\" Yankovic Live!, the concert was recorded at the Marin County Civic Center in San Rafael, California, on October 2, 1999 [146] For legal reasons, video clips (apart from those for Yankovic's own music videos) could not be shown for the home release, and unreleased parodies were removed from the parody medley for the performance [147]\n\n\nLegacy and influence\nWith \"Word Crimes\" from Mandatory Fun debuting at No 39 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2014, Yankovic became the third musical artist after Michael Jackson and Madonna to have a song in the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 over each decade since the 1980s, his other Top 40 songs being \"Eat It\", \"Smells Like Nirvana\", and \"White & Nerdy\" [160] Since then, only U2 and Kenny G have also entered this group [161] Billboard named Yankovic #15 of the top 100 music video artists of all time in an August 2020 compilation, addressing that alongside his musical fame, \"his accompanying video parodies are a vital part of the recipe\" [162]\n\n\nOther works\nIn 1989, Yankovic starred in a full-length feature film called UHF, co-written by himself and manager Jay Levey and filmed in Tulsa, Oklahoma A satire of the television and film industries, also starring Michael Richards, Fran Drescher, and Victoria Jackson, it brought floundering studio Orion their highest test scores since the film RoboCop [165] However, it was unsuccessful in theaters due to both poor critical reception and competition from other summer blockbusters at the time such as Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Lethal Weapon 2, Batman and Licence to Kill [166] The failure of the film left Yankovic in a three-year slump, which was later broken by his inspiration to compose \"Smells Like Nirvana\" [40]\n\n\nFilms\nIn 1989, Yankovic starred in a full-length feature film called UHF, co-written by himself and manager Jay Levey and filmed in Tulsa, Oklahoma A satire of the television

three-year slump, which was later broken by his inspiration to compose \"Smells Like Nirvana\" [40]\n\n\nWeird: The Al Yankovic Story\nIn 2010, Eric Appel produced a Funny or Die trailer for Weird: The Al Yankovic Story, a fictional biographical film that parodies other films based on musicians; Yankovic (played by Aaron Paul) is seen hiding his \"weirdness\" from his parents (Gary Cole and Mary Steenburgen), making it big using song parodies with the help of Dr Demento (Patton Oswalt), falling in and out of love with Madonna (Olivia Wilde), and fading into alcoholism and being arrested, at which point his father finally admits he is \"weird\" as well Yankovic himself plays a music producer in the short [48] [172] [173] [174] Yankovic and Appel announced in January 2022 that they would be making a full-length biopic of the same name based on the trailer, starring Daniel Radcliffe as Yankovic, Evan Rachel Wood as Madonna, and Rainn Wilson as Dr Demento [175] The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2022, and was released on the Roku Channel in November 2022 The film's soundtrack album includes several re-recorded parodies featured in the film along with an original song \"Now You Know\" [176] Among other nominations and awards, the film won the Best Television Movie at the 75th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards [177]\n\n\nLive television\nIn 2012, Yankovic extensively featured in the sixth-season episode of 30 Rock, \"Kidnapped by Danger\", in which Jenna Maroney desperately tries to come up with a \"'Weird Al'-proof\" song [178]  In 2014, he performed at the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards, singing a comedic medley of songs based on the themes of several Emmy-nominated shows, including Mad Men and Game of Thrones [179]\n\n\nAnimation and voice work\nYankovic has done voice-overs for several animated series He appeared in a 2003 episode of The Simpsons, singing \"The Ballad of Homer & Marge\" (a parody of John Mellencamp's \"Jack & Diane\") with his band The episode, \"Three Gays of the Condo\", in which Marge hires Yankovic to sing the aforementioned song to Homer in an attempt to reconcile their marriage, later won an Emmy Award for \"Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming Less Than One Hour)\" Yankovic also had a cameo in a 2008 episode, titled \"That '90s Show\", during which he records a parody of Homer's grunge hit \"Shave Me\" titled \"Brain Freeze\" (Homer's song, \"Shave Me\", was itself a parody of Nirvana's \"Rape Me\") making Yankovic one of only a handful of celebrities to appear twice on the show playing themselves.\n\n\nWeb media\nIn 2008, Weird Al joined Michael J Nelson as a guest on the RiffTrax audio commentary of Jurassic Park On November 10, 2009, Weird Al was a guest \"internet scientist\" on Rocketboom's \"Know Your Meme\" video series, in the installment on the topic of Auto-Tune, hosted by Jamie Wilkinson Yankovic later appeared in another Funny or Die short alongside Huey Lewis which parodied the ax murder scene in the film American Psycho, in which Christian Bale's character Patrick Bateman discusses the nature of Lewis's musical work before killing his victim [189] [190]\n\n\nDirecting\nYankovic has directed many of his own music videos; he has directed all of his music videos from 1993's \"Bedrock Anthem\" to 2006's \"White & Nerdy\" He also directed the end sequence of 1986's \"Christmas at Ground Zero\" (an original piece juxtaposing Christmas with nuclear warfare) from his Polka Party! album and the title sequence to Spy Hard, for which he sang the title song [196]\n\n\nBooks\nYankovic wrote When I Grow Up, a children's book released on February 1, 2011, and published by HarperCollins [203] The book features 8-year-old Billy presenting to his class the wide variety of imaginative career possibilities that he is considering Yankovic stated that the idea for the book was based on his own \"circuitous\" career path [204] The book allows Yankovic to apply the humorous writing style found in his music in another medium, allowing him to use puns and rhymes [204] Yankovic worked with HarperCollins' editor Anne Hoppe—the first time that Yankovic has had an editor—and found her help to be a positive experience [204] The book is illustrated by Wes Hargis, who, according to Yankovic, has \"a childlike quality and a very fun quality and a very imaginative quality\" that matched well with Yankovic's writing [204] The book reached the No 4 position on The New York Times Best Seller list for Children's Picture Books for the week of February 20, 2011 [205]\n\n\nOther media\nYankovic competed on a week of Wheel of Fortune taped at Disney's Hollywood Studios in March 1994 [209] He also competed on Rock & Roll Jeopardy!\n\n\nMisattribution and imitators\nSongs posted to file-sharing networks are often misattributed to him because of their humorous subject matter Often, his surname is misspelled (and thus mispronounced) as \"Yankovich\", among other variations Much to the disdain of Yankovic, these misattributed files include songs that are racist, sexually explicit, or otherwise offensive A young listener who had heard several of these offensive tracks by way of a file-sharing service confronted Yankovic online, threatening a boycott because of his supposedly explicit lyrics [221] Quite a few of the songs, such as \"Star Wars Cantina\" by Mark Jonathan Davis (not, in a double misattribution, his lounge-singer character Richard Cheese), \"Star Wars Gangsta Rap\", \"Yoda Smokes Weed\", \"Chewbacca\", \"The Devil Went to Jamaica\", and several more have a Star Wars motif [222] Some songs misattributed to him are not songs, but spoken skits, such as \"Sesame Street on Crack\", which is also widely misattributed to Adam Sandler A list of songs frequently misattributed to Yankovic can be found at The Not Al Page [222] and a list of all commercially released songs recorded by Yankovic can be found on his website [223]\n\n\nFan-driven campaigns\nThe Weird Al Star Fund was a campaign started by Yankovic's fans to get him a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame Their mission was to \"solicit, collect, and raise the necessary money, and to compile the information needed for the application to nominate \"Weird Al\" Yankovic for a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame\" [227] Fans worldwide have sent donations to raise the US$40,000 needed for a nomination In addition to the preferred method of cash donations, many methods were used to raise money for the cause, such as a live benefit show held April 11, 2006, and selling merchandise on the official website and eBay, including T-shirts, calendars, and cookbooks [228] On May 26, 2006, the campaign hit the then-$15,000 target, just five days before the May 31 deadline to submit the necessary paperwork [227] However, Yankovic was not included on the list of inductees for 2007 [229] On February 9, 2007, the Hollywood Chamber Of Commerce raised the price to sponsor a new star to $25,000 [227] Yankovic's application was resubmitted for consideration in 2007, but he was not included among 2008's inductees [230] In December 2010, the price was raised again to $30,000 [227] and in 2017 the price was raised to $40,000 [227] The campaign raised the new target each time and applications continued to be submitted yearly, until The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce announced in June 2017 that Yankovic would receive a star on the Walk of Fame as one of the 2018 inductees  In an official induction ceremony on August 27, 2018, [231] Al received the 2,643rd star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame The star is located at 6914 Hollywood Blvd, directly across the street from TCL Chinese Theatre The ceremony was attended by 1,500 fans [232] [233]\n\n\nAwards and nominations\nCurrent members\n\n\nGrammy Awards\nCurrent members\n\n\nHollywood Critics Association TV Awards\nCurrent members\n\n\nHollywood Music in Media

Born on April 27, 1948, in the Bronx, New York City, Abagnale's life has been marked by a series of high-profile crimes and controversies.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nAbagnale was born to an Algerian-American mother and an Italian-American father. His parents separated when he was 12 years old and divorced when he was 15. After the divorce, Abagnale moved with his father and stepmother to Mount Vernon, New York. Abagnale's early life was marked by instability and financial struggles, which may have contributed to his later involvement in crime.\n\n**Airline Pilot**\n\nAt the age of 17, Abagnale began impersonating an airline pilot. He obtained a uniform at a Manhattan uniform company and claimed to be a graduate of the American Airlines pilot school in Fort Worth, Texas. However, Abagnale's scheme was short-lived, and he was arrested for theft of checks in Tuckahoe, New York, just days after his initial claim.\n\nAbagnale was sentenced to three years at the Great Meadow Prison in Comstock, New York, for the stolen checks. He served only two years of his sentence before being released into the custody of his mother. However, Abagnale soon broke the terms of his parole with a stolen-car conviction in Boston, Massachusetts, and was returned to Great Meadow for an additional year.\n\n**Europe**\n\nIn 1969, Abagnale was arrested in Montpellier, France, for stealing a car and defrauding two local families in Klippan, Sweden. He was sentenced to four months for theft in France, although he only served three months in Perpignan's prison.\n\n**United States**\n\nAfter returning to the United States, Abagnale continued to impersonate an airline pilot, claiming to be recruiting stewardesses for Pan Am. He traveled to college campuses, passing bad checks and conducting physical examinations on female college students who wanted to be part of flight crews. Abagnale's scheme was eventually exposed, but not before he had accumulated a significant amount of money and notoriety.\n\n**Veracity of Claims**\n\nAbagnale has made numerous claims about his life and exploits, including stating that he was wanted in 26 countries, worked extensively for the FBI, and escaped several times from FBI custody. However, almost all of these claims have been refuted by journalists and experts. Abagnale has also claimed to have cashed over 17,000 bad checks, amounting to $2.5 million, and worked as an assistant attorney general and a hospital physician. These claims have also been disputed.\n\n**Relationship with the Federal Bureau of Investigation**\n\nAbagnale's relationship with the FBI has been a subject of controversy. In 1977, Abagnale began claiming a five-year uninterrupted life on the run, involving multiprofession imposter scams. However, he did not claim to work for the FBI at this time. Instead, he leveraged the names of FBI personnel to bolster his new biographical claims. Abagnale's publicist was also accused of giving out the names of FBI agents to any party that asked for references or verification of his claimed biography.\n\n**Talks at Google**\n\nIn 2022, Google disabled all comments and added a disclaimer to Abagnale's \"Talks at Google\" video, stating that the company does not endorse or condone the content contained within the video. The disclaimer was added in response to members of the audience who had raised concerns about Abagnale's credibility and the accuracy of his claims.\n\n**Controversy at Xavier and Other Universities**\n\nIn 2022, Abagnale was awarded the \"Heroes in Ethics\" award by Xavier University, located in Cincinnati, Ohio. Abagnale gave the keynote lecture at the university's annual Heroes of Professional Ethics series, but his talk was met with skepticism and criticism from some members of the audience. One audience member asked Abagnale to come clean about his past and admit to lying about his exploits, but Abagnale denied telling any lies or spreading any misinformation.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nAbagnale and his wife Kelly live on Daniel Island, an island community which is part of Charleston, South Carolina.

soldiers, played by Burt Lancaster, Montgomery Clift, and Sinatra, stationed on Hawaii in the months leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor [399] Sinatra had long been desperate to find a film role that would bring him back into the spotlight, and Columbia Pictures boss Harry Cohn had been inundated by appeals from people across Hollywood to give Sinatra a chance to star as \"Maggio\" in the film [400] [ab] During production, Montgomery Clift became a close friend, [402] and Sinatra later professed that he \"learned more about acting from him than anybody I ever knew before\" [403] After several years of critical and commercial decline, his Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor win helped him regain his position as the top recording artist in the world [404] His performance also won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture [405] The Los Angeles Examiner wrote that Sinatra is \"simply superb, comical, pitiful, childishly brave, pathetically defiant\",

Manchurian Candidate (1962), which he considered to be the role he was most excited about and the high point of his film career [431] Vincent Canby, writing for the magazine Variety, found the portrayal of Sinatra's character to be \"a wide-awake pro creating a straight, quietly humorous character of some sensitivity.\" [432] He appeared with the Rat Pack in the western Sergeants 3 (1962), [430] and again in the 1964 gangster-oriented musical Robin and the 7 Hoods For his performance in Come Blow Your Horn (1963), adapted from the Neil Simon play, he was nominated for the Golden Globe

obsessed with cleanliness—while with the Tommy Dorsey band, he developed the nickname \"Lady Macbeth\" because of frequent showering and switching his outfits [509] His deep blue eyes earned him the popular nickname \"Ol' Blue Eyes\" [510]\n\n\nAlleged organized-crime links and Cal Neva Lodge\nSinatra became the stereotype of the \"tough working-class Italian American,\" something which he embraced He said that if it had not been for his interest in music, he would have likely ended up in a life of crime [524] Willie Moretti was Sinatra's godfather and the notorious underboss of the

younger years, Sinatra had \"ardent liberal\" sympathies and was \"so concerned about poor people that he was always quoting Henry Wallace.\"  [544] He was outspoken against racism, particularly toward black people and Italians, from a young age In the early 1950s, he was among those who campaigned to combine the racially segregated musicians' unions in Los Angeles [545] In November 1945, Sinatra was invited by the mayor of Gary, Indiana, to try to settle a strike by white students of Froebel High School against the \"Pro-Negro\" policies of the new principal [546] His comments, while praised by liberal publications, led to accusations by some that he was a communist, which he said were not true [547] In the 1948 presidential election, Sinatra actively campaigned for President Harry S Truman [548] In 1952 and 1956, he campaigned for Adlai Stevenson [548]\n\n\nDeath and funeral\nDuring the final years of his life, Sinatra was in ill health and was frequently hospitalized for

attempts were made to stabilize him, and reported that his final words were, \"I'm losing.\" [568] Sinatra's daughter, Tina, later wrote that she and her siblings had not been notified of their father's final hospitalization, and it was her belief that \"the omission was deliberate Barbara would be the grieving widow alone at her husband's side.\" [569] The night after Sinatra's death, the lights on the Empire State Building were turned blue, the lights at the Las Vegas Strip were dimmed in his honor, and the casinos stopped spinning for one minute [566] [570] Significant increases in recording sales worldwide were reported by Billboard in the month of his death [240]\n\n\nLegacy and honors\nRobert Christgau referred to Sinatra as \"the greatest singer of the 20th century\" [5] His popularity is matched only by Bing Crosby, Elvis Presley, The Beatles, and Michael Jackson [565] For Santopietro, Sinatra was the \"greatest male pop singer in the history of America,\"  [575] who amassed \"unprecedented power onscreen and off,\" and \"seemed to exemplify the common man, an ethnic twentieth-century American male who reached the 'top of the heap,' yet never forgot his roots.\" Santopietro argues that Sinatra created his world, which he was able to dominate—his career was centered around power, perfecting the ability to capture an audience [576]\n\n\nTribute albums to

chauffeur the group around Sinatra soon learned they were auditioning for the Major Bowes Amateur Hour show and \"begged\" the group to let him in on the act [50]\n\n\n1935–1942: Hoboken Four, Harry James, and Tommy Dorsey\nSinatra began singing professionally as a teenager Even though he never learned to read music, he learned by ear [47] [48] He got his first break in 1935 when his mother persuaded a local singing group called the 3 Flashes to let him join Baritone Fred Tamburro stated that \"Frank hung around us like we were gods or something,\" admitting that they only took him on board because he owned a car [g] and could chauffeur the group around Sinatra soon learned they were auditioning for the Major Bowes Amateur Hour show and \"begged\" the group to let him in on the act [50]\n\n\n1942–1945: Onset of Sinatramania and Role in World War II\nPerfectly simple: It was the war years, and there was a great loneliness, and I was the boy in every corner drugstore, the boy who'd gone off drafted to the war That's all.\n\n1946–1952: Columbia years and career slump\nDespite being heavily involved in political activity in 1945 and 1946, in those two years, Sinatra sang on 160 radio shows, recorded 36 times, and shot four films By 1946, he was performing on stage up to 45 times a week, singing up to 100 songs daily, and earning up to $93,000 a week  [119]\n\n\n1953–1960: Career Revival and the Capitol years\nThe release of the film From Here to Eternity in August 1953 marked the beginning of a remarkable career revival [165] Tom Santopietro notes that Sinatra began to bury himself in his work, with an \"unparalleled frenetic schedule of recordings, movies and concerts,\"  [166] in what authors Anthony Summers and Robbyn Swan describe as \"a new and brilliant phase.\" [167]\n\n\n1960–1969: Reprise years\nSinatra grew discontented at Capitol and fell into a feud with Alan Livingston, which lasted over six months [220] His first attempt at owning his own label was with his pursuit of buying declining jazz label Verve Records, which ended once an initial agreement with Verve founder Norman Granz \"failed to materialize\" [221]\n\n\n1970–1981: \"Retirement\" and return\nIn 1970, Sinatra released Watertown, a critically acclaimed concept album, with music by Bob Gaudio (of the Four Seasons) and lyrics by Jake Holmes [271] However, it sold a mere 30,000 copies that year and reached a peak chart position of 101 [272]\n\n\n1982–1998: Later career and final projects\nSantopietro stated that by the early 1980s, Sinatra's voice had \"coarsened, losing much of its power and flexibility, but audiences didn't care.\" [322] In 1982, he signed a $16 million three-year deal with the Golden Nugget of Las Vegas \n\n\nArtistry\n\n\n\nFilm career\nSinatra attempted to pursue an acting career in Hollywood in the early 1940s While films appealed to him, [383] being exceptionally self-confident, [384] he was rarely enthusiastic about his own acting, once remarking that \"pictures stink\" [385] Sinatra made his film debut performing in an uncredited sequence in Las Vegas Nights (1941), singing \"I'll Never Smile Again\" with Tommy Dorsey's Pied Pipers [386] He had a cameo role along with Duke Ellington and Count Basie in Charles Barton's Reveille with Beverly (1943), making a brief appearance singing \"Night and Day\" [387] Next, he was given leading roles in Higher and Higher and Step Lively (both 1944) for RKO [388] [389]\n\n\n1941–1952: Debut, musical films, and career slump\nSinatra attempted to pursue an acting career in Hollywood in the early 1940s While films appealed to him, [383] being exceptionally self-confident, [384] he was rarely enthusiastic about his own acting, once remarking that \"pictures stink\" [385] Sinatra made his film debut performing in an uncredited sequence in Las Vegas Nights (1941), singing \"I'll Never Smile Again\" with Tommy Dorsey's Pied Pipers [386] He had a cameo role along with Duke Ellington and Count Basie in Charles Barton's Reveille with Beverly (1943), making a brief appearance singing \"Night and Day\" [387] Next, he was given leading roles in Higher and Higher and Step Lively (both 1944) for RKO [388] [389]\n\n\n1953–1959: Career comeback and prime\nFred Zinnemann's From Here to Eternity (1953) deals with the tribulations of three soldiers, played by Burt Lancaster, Montgomery Clift, and Sinatra, stationed on Hawaii in the months leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor [399] Sinatra had long been desperate to find a film role that would bring him back into the spotlight, and Columbia Pictures boss Harry Cohn had been inundated by appeals from people across Hollywood to give Sinatra a chance to star as \"Maggio\" in the film [400] [ab] During production, Montgomery Clift became a close friend, [402] and Sinatra later professed that he \"learned more about acting from him than anybody I ever knew before\" [403] After several years of critical and commercial decline, his Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor win helped him regain his position as the top recording artist in the world [404] His performance also won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture [405] The Los Angeles Examiner wrote that Sinatra is \"simply superb, comical, pitiful, childishly brave, pathetically defiant\", commenting that his death scene is \"one of the best ever photographed\" [406]\n\n\n1960–1980: Later career\nDue to an obligation, he owed to 20th Century Fox for walking off the set of Henry King's Carousel (1956), [ad] Sinatra starred opposite Shirley MacLaine, Maurice Chevalier and Louis Jourdan in Can-Can (1960) He earned $200,000 and 25% of the profits for the performance [428] Around the same time, he starred in the Las Vegas-set Ocean's 11 (1960), the first film to feature the Rat Pack together and the start of a \"new era of screen cool\" for Santopietro [429] Sinatra personally financed the film and paid Martin and Davis fees of $150,000 and $125,000, respectively, sums considered exorbitant for the period [430] He had a leading role opposite Laurence Harvey in The Manchurian Candidate (1962), which he considered to be the role he was most excited about and the high point of his film career [431] Vincent Canby, writing for the magazine Variety, found the portrayal of Sinatra's character to be \"a wide-awake pro creating a straight, quietly humorous character of some sensitivity.\" [432] He appeared with the Rat Pack in the western Sergeants 3 (1962), [430] and again in the 1964 gangster-oriented musical Robin and the 7 Hoods For his performance in Come Blow Your Horn (1963), adapted from the Neil Simon play, he was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy [405]\n\n\nTelevision and radio career\nAfter beginning on the Major Bowes Amateur Hour radio show with the Hoboken Four in 1935, and later WNEW and WAAT in Jersey City, [56] Sinatra became the star of radio shows of his own on NBC and CBS from the early 1940s to the mid-1950s In 1942, Sinatra hired arranger Axel Stordahl away from Tommy Dorsey before he began his first radio program that year, keeping Stordahl with him for all of his radio work [445] By the end of 1942, he was named the \"Most Popular Male Vocalist on Radio\" in a DownBeat poll [446] Early on he frequently worked with The Andrews Sisters on radio They would appear as guests on each other's shows, [116] as well as on many USO shows broadcast to troops via the Armed Forces Radio Service (AFRS) [117] He appeared as a special guest in the sisters' ABC Eight-to-the-Bar Ranch series, [447] while the trio in turn guested on his Songs by Sinatra series on CBS [448] Sinatra had two stints as a regular member of the cast of Your Hit Parade; [ae] his first was from 1943 to 1945, [450] and second was from 1946 to May 28, 1949, [451] during which he was paired with the then-new girl singer, Doris Day [452] Starting in September 1949, the BBD&O advertising agency produced a radio series starring Sinatra for Lucky Strike called Light Up Time – some 176 15-minute shows that featured him and Dorothy Kirsten singing – which lasted through to May 1950 [453]\n\n\nPersonal life\nSinatra was married to Nancy Sinatra (née Barbato) from 1939 to 1951 The couple had three children, Nancy (born 1940), Frank Jr (1944–2016) and Tina (born 1948) [468] [469]\n\n\nStyle and personality\nSinatra was known for his immaculate sense of style [506] He spent lavishly on expensive custom-tailored tuxedos and stylish pin-striped suits, which made him feel wealthy and important and that he was giving his very best to the audience [507] [508] He was also obsessed with cleanliness—while with the Tommy Dorsey band, he developed the nickname \"Lady Macbeth\" because of frequent showering and switching his outfits [509] His deep blue eyes earned him the popular nickname \"Ol' Blue Eyes\" [510]\n\n\nAlleged organized-crime links and Cal Neva Lodge\nSinatra became the stereotype of the \"tough working-class Italian American,\" something which he embraced He said that if it had not been for his interest in music, he would have likely ended up in a life of crime [524] Willie Moretti was Sinatra's godfather and the notorious underboss of the Genovese crime family, and he helped Sinatra in exchange for kickbacks and was reported to have intervened in releasing Sinatra from his contract with Tommy Dorsey [525] Sinatra was present at the Mafia Havana Conference in 1946, [526] and the press learned of his being there with Lucky Luciano One newspaper published the headline \"Shame, Sinatra.\"  [527] He was reported to be a good friend of mobster Sam Giancana, [528] Kelley quoted Jo-Carrol Silvers that Sinatra \"adored\" Bugsy Siegel and boasted to friends about him and how many people Siegel had killed [529] Kelley says that Sinatra and mobster Joseph Fischetti had been good friends from 1938 onward and acted like \"Sicilian brothers\" [530] She also states that Sinatra and Hank Sanicola were financial partners with Mickey Cohen in the gossip magazine Hollywood Night Life [531]\n\n\nPolitical views and activism\nSinatra held varied political views throughout his life His mother, Dolly, was a Democratic Party ward leader [542] After meeting President Franklin D Roosevelt in 1944, he subsequently heavily campaigned for the Democrats in the 1944 presidential election [543] According to Jo Carroll Silvers, in his younger years, Sinatra had \"ardent liberal\" sympathies and was \"so concerned about poor people that he was always quoting Henry Wallace.\"  [544] He was outspoken against racism, particularly toward black people and Italians, from a young age In the early 1950s, he was among those who campaigned to combine the racially segregated musicians' unions in Los Angeles [545] In November 1945, Sinatra was invited by the mayor of Gary, Indiana, to try to settle a strike by white students of Froebel High School against the \"Pro-Negro\" policies of the new principal [546] His comments, while praised by liberal publications, led to accusations by some that he was a communist, which he said were not true [547] In the 1948 presidential election, Sinatra actively campaigned for President Harry S Truman [548] In 1952 and 1956, he campaigned for Adlai Stevenson [548]\n\n\nDeath and funeral\nDuring the final years of his life, Sinatra was in ill health and was frequently hospitalized for heart and breathing problems, high blood pressure, pneumonia, and bladder cancer He made no public appearances following a heart attack in February 1997 [565] On the night of May 14, 1998, Sinatra died of another heart attack at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, with his wife Barbara at his side; he was 82 years old [565] [566] [567] Barbara encouraged Sinatra to \"fight\" while attempts were made to stabilize him, and reported that his final words were, \"I'm losing.\" [568] Sinatra's daughter, Tina, later wrote that she and her siblings had not been notified of their father's final hospitalization, and it was her belief that \"the omission was deliberate Barbara would be the grieving widow alone at her husband's side.\" [569] The night after Sinatra's death, the lights on the Empire State Building were turned blue, the lights at the Las Vegas Strip were dimmed in his honor, and the casinos stopped spinning for one minute [566] [570] Significant increases in recording sales worldwide were reported by Billboard in the month of his death [240]\n\n\nLegacy and honors\nRobert Christgau referred to Sinatra as \"the greatest singer of the 20th century\" [5] His popularity is matched only by Bing Crosby, Elvis Presley, The Beatles, and Michael Jackson [565] For Santopietro, Sinatra was the \"greatest male pop singer in the history of America,\"  [575] who amassed \"unprecedented power onscreen and off,\" and \"seemed to exemplify the common man, an ethnic twentieth-century American male who reached the 'top of the heap,' yet never forgot his roots.\" Santopietro argues that Sinatra created his world, which he was able to dominate—his career was centered around power, perfecting the ability to capture an audience [576]\n\n\nTribute albums to

Despite their past failures, however, Ecuador has risen to be a serious South American competitor in recent years. The team has qualified for the FIFA World Cup six times, with their best finish being a quarter-final appearance in 2006. Ecuador has also won several regional titles, including the 1947 South American Championship and the 1959 Bolivarian Games.\n\n**Home stadium**\n\nThe Ecuador national team plays their home games at the Estadio Olímpico Atahualpa in Quito. Having opened in 1951, it initially had a capacity of 45,000, but was later reduced to 35,724. The stadium has undergone several renovations and expansions over the years, including the addition of a new roof and improved seating.\n\n**Team image**\n\nThe standard Ecuador uniform maintains the colours of the national flag, typically a yellow top, blue shorts, and red socks. The alternate colours of the uniform are white and blue, this being based on the flag of the Guayas Province. From 1965 to 2020, the crest featured the Andean condor, Ecuador's national bird, above a shield with the country's colours. In January 2020, the Ecuadorian Football Federation announced a rebrand of the logo; a navy blue shield with an \"FEF\" monogram attempting to \"abstractly build a condor\".\n\n**Kit sponsorship**\n\nThe Ecuador national team has a long-standing kit sponsorship deal with Puma, a well-known sportswear company.

was not always a public controversy [25] [26] [27] [28] At a time when society was more concerned with the serious consequences of women becoming pregnant out of wedlock, family affairs were handled out of public view [25] [29] The criminality of abortion at common law is a matter of debate by historians and legal scholars [30] [31] [32]\n\n\nHistory of the case\nSarah Weddington recruited Linda Coffee to help her with abortion litigation Their first plaintiffs were a married couple; they joined after the woman heard Coffee give a speech [55] The intended suit would state abortions were medically necessary for the woman The woman had a neurochemical disorder and it was considered medically necessary that she not give birth or raise children, yet they did not want to abstain from sex, and contraception might fail [55] The attorneys were concerned about standing since the woman was not pregnant Weddington later wrote that they \"needed to find a pregnant Texas woman who wanted an abortion and would be willing to be a plaintiff.\" [56] They also wanted to increase the likelihood that the panel selection would help them win in court They wanted to present their case to a three-judge panel which included a judge they thought would be sympathetic, [56] which was a possibility only by filing a case in Dallas [57]  If either of the two cases they filed in Dallas were assigned favorably, they intended to ask for the other one to be consolidated with it [56]\n\n\nHearing the case\nRoe v Wade reached the Supreme Court when both sides appealed in 1970 It bypassed the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit [82] because 28 USC § 1253 authorizes a direct appeal to the Supreme Court in cases concerning the granting or denial of a civil injunction decided by a three judge panel [83]\nThe case continued under the name Roe v Wade instead of being switched to Wade v Roe The justices delayed taking action on Roe and a closely related case, Doe v Bolton, until they had first decided certain other cases One case they decided first was Younger v Harris The justices felt the appeals raised difficult questions on judicial jurisdiction.\n\n\nPostponement\nRoe v Wade reached the Supreme Court when both sides appealed in 1970 It bypassed the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit [82] because 28 USC § 1253 authorizes a direct appeal to the Supreme Court in cases concerning the granting or denial of a civil injunction decided by a three judge panel [83]\nThe case continued under the name Roe v Wade instead of being switched to Wade v Roe The justices delayed taking action on Roe and a closely related case, Doe v Bolton, until they had first decided certain other cases One case they decided first was Younger v Harris The justices felt the appeals raised difficult questions on judicial jurisdiction.\n\n\nOral argument\nAs she began speaking for the oral argument, Sarah Weddington was unaware that the Court had decided to hear the case to decide which courts had jurisdiction to hear it rather than as an attempt to overturn abortion laws in a broad ruling She began by bringing up constitutional reasons why the Court should overturn Texas's abortion law, but Justice Stewart asked questions directed towards the jurisdiction question instead Weddington replied that she saw no problem with jurisdiction and continued to talk about a constitutional right to abortion [91] Overall, she spent between 20 and 30 minutes discussing jurisdiction and procedure instead of constitutional issues [88]\n\n\nInitial discussions\nAfter the first argument session, Burger assigned the task of writing the Court's opinions for both Roe and Doe to Blackmun [95] Douglas suggested to Blackmun that Burger assigned the opinions to him out of malicious intention, but Blackmun disagreed He knew that Burger could not write it himself because the abortion was too controversial, and his opinions might get rejected by the majority He also understood why the other justices could not be assigned to write the opinions: Douglas was too liberal for the public to accept his word Likewise, he might split the Court's vote by writing something radical In addition, the quality of his opinions had suffered recently Brennan was the only Catholic on the Court, and he would have to face Catholic political groups which were against abortion If Marshall wrote the opinions, the ruling would be perceived as being directed towards African Americans, and he would have to face the displeasure of African American political groups Stewart would have trouble going far enough in legalizing abortion [96]\n\n\nDrafting the opinion\nBlackmun continued to work on his opinions in both cases over the summer recess, even though there was no guarantee that he would be assigned to write them again Over the recess, he spent a week researching the history of abortion at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, where he had worked in the 1950s He talked daily on the phone with George Frampton, his 28-year-old law clerk who stayed behind in Washington, D.C [106] Frampton researched the history of abortion using a book authored by Lawrence Lader, the founding chairman of what is now called NARAL Pro-Choice America Blackmun's papers made available since his death contain at least seven citations [107] for Lader's 1966 book, Abortion [106] Chapter 16 of his book, \"A Blueprint for Changing U.S Abortion Laws\" predicted that if abortion were to be legalized, \"the possibility of community opposition is slight\" [108] Lader also predicted that \"If such a theoretical case was carried to a high court, perhaps even the U.S Supreme Court, and the judges confirmed a broad interpretation of the meaning of a threat to life, undoubtedly a landmark in abortion decisions would be reached.\" [109]\n\n\nSupreme Court decision\nOn January 22, 1973, the Supreme Court issued a 7–2 decision in favor of \"Jane Roe\" (Norma McCorvey) holding that women in the United States had a fundamental right to choose whether to have abortions without excessive government restriction and striking down Texas's abortion ban as unconstitutional The decision was issued together with a decision in a companion case, Doe v Bolton, which involved a similar challenge to Georgia's abortion laws [2]\n\n\nOpinion of the Court\nJustice Harry Blackmun authored the opinion of the Court—the \"majority opinion\"—and was joined by six other justices: Chief Justice Warren Burger and Justices Potter Stewart, William J Brennan Jr., William O Douglas, Thurgood Marshall, and Lewis F Powell Jr.\n\n\nMootness\nAfter reciting the facts of the case, the Court's opinion first addressed several legal questions involving procedure and justiciability These included mootness, a legal doctrine that prevents American federal courts from hearing cases that have ceased to be \"live\" controversies because of intervening events [119] Under a normal application of the doctrine, McCorvey's appeal would have been considered moot because she had already given birth to her child and therefore no longer had a pregnancy to abort [120]\n\n\nAbortion and right to privacy\nAfter dealing with mootness and standing, the Court proceeded to the main issue of the case: the constitutionality of Texas's abortion law The Court first surveyed abortion's status throughout the history of Roman law and the English and early American common law [6] It also reviewed the developments of medical procedures and technology used in abortions [6]\n\n\nConcurrences\nThree justices from the majority filed concurring opinions in the case Justice Potter Stewart wrote a concurring opinion in which he said that even though the Constitution makes no mention of the right to choose to have an abortion without interference, he thought the Court's decision was a permissible interpretation of the doctrine of substantive due process, which says that the Due Process Clause's protection of liberty extends beyond simple procedures and protects certain fundamental rights [129] [7] Justice William O Douglas's concurring opinion described his view that although the Court was correct to find that the right to choose to have an abortion was a fundamental right, he thought it would have been better to derive it from the Ninth Amendment—which states that the fact that a right is not specifically enumerated in the Constitution shall not be construed to mean that American people do not possess it—rather than through the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause [129] [7]\n\n\nDissents\nJustices Byron White and William Rehnquist dissented from the Court's decision [7]  White's dissent, which was issued with Roe's companion case, Doe v Bolton, argued that the Court had no basis for deciding between the competing values of pregnant women and unborn children: \n\n\nReception\nThere was a strong response to the decision shortly after it was issued [143] The Catholic Church condemned the ruling [144] Prominent organized groups that responded to Roe include National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws, which became the National Abortion Rights Action League in late 1973 to reflect the Court's repeal of restrictive laws, [145] and the National Right to Life Committee [146]\n\n\nSupport for Roe and abortion rights\nIn the 1960s, there was an alliance between the population control movement and the abortion-rights movement in the United States [148] Abortion rights were especially supported by younger women within the population control movement [149] The cooperation was mostly due to feminists who wanted some of the popularity already enjoyed by the population control movement [citation needed] In addition, population control advocates thought that legalizing abortion would help solve the coming population crisis that demographers had projected [148]\n\n\n1960s–1970s\nIn the 1960s, there was an alliance between the population control movement and the abortion-rights movement in the United States [148] Abortion rights were especially supported by younger women within the population control movement [149] The cooperation was mostly due to feminists who wanted some of the popularity already enjoyed by the population control movement [citation needed] In addition, population control advocates thought that legalizing abortion would help solve the coming population crisis that demographers had projected [148]\n\n\n21st century\nInto the 21st century, advocates of Roe describe it as vital to the preservation of women's rights, personal freedom, bodily integrity, and privacy Advocates have also reasoned that access to safe abortion and reproductive freedom generally are fundamental rights Supporters of Roe contend that even if abortion rights are also supported by another portion of the constitution, the decision in 1973 accurately founds the right in the Fourteenth Amendment Others support Roe despite concern that the fundamental right to abortion is found elsewhere in the Constitution but not in the portions referenced in the 1973 decision [162] [163] They also tend to believe that the power balance between men and women is unequal, and that issues like access to birth control and political representation affect women's equality [164]\n\n\nOpposition to Roe\nThe Catholic Church condemned the ruling by the Supreme Court [144] Blackmun wrote in his diary, \"Abortion flak—3 Cardinals—Vatican—Rochester wires!\" [144]\n\n\nCondemnation by Catholic Bishops\nThe Catholic Church condemned the ruling by the Supreme Court [144] Blackmun wrote in his diary, \"Abortion flak—3 Cardinals—Vatican—Rochester wires!\" [144]\n\n\nOpposition to Roe but support for abortion rights\nSome supporters of abortion rights oppose Roe v Wade on the grounds that it laid a foundation for abortion in civil rights rather than in human rights, which are broader and would require government entities to take active measures to ensure every woman has access to abortion [16] [page needed] This particular position is indicated by the use of rhetoric concerning \"reproductive justice\", which replaces earlier rhetoric centered around \"choice\", such as the \"pro-choice\" label [179] Reproductive justice proponents contend that factors permitting choice are unequal, thus perpetuating oppression and serving to divide women [180] Reproductive justice advocates instead want abortion to be considered an affirmative right that the government would be obligated to guarantee equal access to, even if the women seeking abortions are nonwhite, poor, or live outside major metropolitan areas [181] With a broader interpretation of the right to an abortion, it would be possible to require all new obstetricians to be in favor of abortion rights, lest as professionals they employ conscience clauses and refuse to perform abortions [182] In the 1989 decision of Webster v Reproductive Health Services, the Supreme Court ruled against an affirmative right to nontherapeutic abortions and noted that states would not be required to pay for them [183]\n\n\nOpposition to both Roe and abortion rights\nEvery year, on the anniversary of the decision, opponents of abortion march up Constitution Avenue to the Supreme Court Building in Washington, D.C., in the March for Life [185] Around 250,000 people attended the march until 2010 [186] [187] Estimates put the 2011 and 2012 attendances at 400,000 each, [188] and the 2013 March for Life drew an estimated 650,000 people [189] The march was started in October 1973 by Nellie Gray and the first march took place on January 22, 1974, to mark the first anniversary of Roe v Wade.\n\n\nResponses within the legal profession\nLiberal and feminist legal scholars have had various reactions to Roe, not always giving the decision unqualified support One argument is that Justice Blackmun reached the correct result but went about it the wrong way [12] Another is that the end achieved by Roe does not justify its means of judicial fiat [14]\n\n\nLater responses by those involved\nJustice Blackmun, who authored the Roe decision, subsequently had mixed feelings about his role in the case During a 1974 television interview, he stated that Roe \"will be regarded as one of the worst mistakes in the court's history or one of its great decisions, a turning point.\" [222]\n\n\nHarry Blackmun\nJustice Blackmun, who authored the Roe decision, subsequently had mixed feelings about his role in the case During a 1974 television interview, he stated that Roe \"will be regarded as one of the worst mistakes in the court's history or one of its great decisions, a turning point.\" [222]\n\n\nNorma McCorvey\nA few years after the Supreme Court decided Roe, Norma McCorvey made a claim—which she recanted many years later—that she had a nightmare about \"little babies lying around with daggers in their hearts\" She said this was the first of recurring nightmares that kept her awake at night [228] She became worried and wondered, \"What really, had I done?\" [229] and \"Well, how do they kill a baby inside a mother's stomach anyway?\" McCorvey later claimed:\n\n\nSarah Weddington\nAfter arguing in Roe v Wade at the age of 26, Sarah Weddington was elected to the Texas House of Representatives for three terms Weddington also was general counsel for the U.S Department of Agriculture, an assistant to President Jimmy Carter, [244] lecturer at the Texas Wesleyan University School of Law, and speaker and adjunct professor at the University of Texas at Austin [245]\n\n\nSubsequent judicial developments\nRoe is embedded in a long line of cases concerning personal liberty in the realm of privacy, since Roe was based on individual liberty cases concerning privacy like Meyer v Nebraska (1923), Griswold v Connecticut (1965), Loving v Virginia (1967) and Eisenstadt v Baird (1972) [249] [250] [251] and became a foundation for individual liberty cases concerning privacy like Lawrence v Texas (2003) and Obergefell v Hodges (2015) [250] [252]\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood v. Danforth\nIn Planned Parenthood v Danforth, 428 U.S 52 (1976), [275] the plaintiffs challenged a Missouri statute which regulated abortion In the regulations for abortions on demand, the state required prior written consent from a parent if the patient was a minor or a spouse if the patient was married For pregnancies at 12 weeks and later, the statute also banned saline abortions, [276] in which chemicals are injected into the amniotic sac to burn the fetus [277] The portions of the statute involving parental or spousal consent and prohibiting saline abortions were struck down [276]\n\n\nFloyd v. Anders\nIn Floyd v Anders, 440 F Supp 535 (D.S.C 1977), South Carolina attempted to prosecute a doctor for illegal abortion and murder after he attempted to abort an African American boy at 25 weeks During the abortion, the boy was born alive and survived for 20 days before dying [278] His prosecution was blocked by Judge Clement Haynsworth, and shortly afterwards by a unanimous three judge panel for the U.S District Court for the District of South Carolina Judge Haynsworth, writing for the panel, stated \"Indeed, the Supreme Court declared the fetus in the womb is neither alive nor a person within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" [279] John T Noonan criticized this from an anti-abortion perspective, stating that \"Judge Haynsworth had replaced the Supreme Court's test of potential ability to live with a new test of actual ability to live indefinitely He also had spelled out what was implied in Roe v Wade but never actually stated there For the American legal systems the fetus in the womb was not alive.\" [280] The standard in Roe for viability outside the womb required a \"capability of meaningful life\" [281] Without this capability, the state had no compelling \"important and legitimate interest in potential life\" [281]\n\n\nWebster v. Reproductive Health Services\nIn a 5–4 decision in 1989's Webster v Reproductive Health Services, Chief Justice Rehnquist, writing for the Court, declined to explicitly overrule Roe, because \"none of the challenged provisions of the Missouri Act properly before us conflict with the Constitution.\" In particular, the Court found that the ability to have a nontherapeutic abortion was not an affirmative right of the sort that required the state to pay for it [183] In this case, the Court upheld several abortion restrictions, and modified the Roe trimester framework [183]\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood v. Casey\nDuring initial deliberations for Planned Parenthood v Casey (1992), an initial majority of five justices (Rehnquist, White, Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas) were willing to effectively overturn Roe Justice Kennedy changed his mind after the initial conference, [282] and Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter joined Justices Blackmun and Stevens to reaffirm the central holding of Roe, [283] but instead of justifying the liberty to abort as being based on privacy as in Roe, it justified the liberty in a broader manner The opinion asserted an individual's liberty to choose concerning family life and also protection from legal enforcement intended to maintain traditional sex roles, writing, [284] \"Our law affords constitutional protection to personal decisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education. ...\" [285] and against the state insisting \"upon its own vision of the woman's role, however dominant that vision has been in the course of our history and our culture The destiny of the woman must be shaped to a large extent on her own conception of her spiritual imperatives and her place in society.\" [286]\n\n\nStenberg v. Carhart\nDuring the 1990s, Nebraska enacted a law banning partial-birth abortion The law allowed another second-trimester abortion procedure known as dilation and evacuation In 2000, the Supreme Court struck down the law by a 5–4 vote in Stenberg v Carhart, with Justice Stephen Breyer writing for the majority that sometimes partial-birth abortion \"would be the safest procedure\" [294] Justice O'Connor wrote a concurrence stating Nebraska was actually banning both abortion methods [295] Justices Ginsburg and Stevens joined each other's concurrences Justice Stevens stated that \"the notion that either of these two equally gruesome procedures performed at this late stage of gestation is more akin to infanticide than the other .. is simply irrational.\" [296] Justice Ginsburg stated that the \"law does not save any fetus from destruction, for it targets only 'a method of performing abortion'.\" [297]\n\n\nGonzales v. Carhart\nIn 2003, Congress passed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, [302] which led to a lawsuit in the case of Gonzales v Carhart [303] The Court previously ruled in Stenberg v Carhart that a state's ban on partial-birth abortion was unconstitutional because such a ban did not have an exception for the health of the woman [304] The membership of the Court changed after Stenberg, with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito replacing Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice O'Connor [305] [306] The ban at issue in Gonzales v Carhart was similar to the one in Stenberg, [304] but had been adjusted to comply with the Court's ruling [307]\n\n\nDubay v. Wells\nDubay v Wells was a 2006 paternity case where a man argued he should not have to pay child support for a child he did not want to parent The case was billed as \"Roe v Wade for men\" [312]\n\n\nWhole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt\nIn 2013, the Texas legislature enacted restrictions which required abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at a local hospital and required abortion clinics to have facilities equivalent to others which conducted outpatient surgery [315] On June 27, 2016, the Supreme Court in a 5–3 decision for Whole Woman's Health v Hellerstedt struck down these restrictions [315]\n\n\nBox v. Planned Parenthood\nIn 2016, Indiana passed House Bill 1337, enacting a law which regulated what is done with fetal remains and banning abortion for sexist, racist, or ableist purposes [317] In its unsigned 2019 ruling for Box v Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Inc., the U.S Supreme Court upheld the regulations about fetal remains, but declined to hear the remainder of the law, which had been blocked by lower courts [318] Justice Ginsburg dissented from the part of the ruling about fetal remains on the basis that the regulations violated Casey [319] She also criticized Justice Thomas over his use of the word \"mother\" in his concurrence [320]\n\n\nWhole Woman's Health v. Jackson\nIn 2021, the state of Texas devised a legal workaround to Roe that allowed it to successfully outlaw abortion at six weeks of pregnancy despite the continued existence of Roe and Casey In the Texas Heartbeat Act, the legislature created a novel enforcement mechanism that bars state officials from enforcing the statute and authorizes private individuals to sue anyone who performs or assists an illegal abortion [324] [325] Because the Act is enforced by private citizens rather than government officials, there are no state officials that abortion providers can sue to stop the enforcement of the law, and they cannot obtain judicial relief that will stop private lawsuits from being initiated against them [326] This has produced an end-run around Roe because the threat of private civil-enforcement lawsuits has forced abortion providers to comply with the Act despite its incompatibility with the Supreme Court's abortion pronouncements [327] [328] Other states have copied this enforcement mechanism to sidestep Roe and immunize their anti-abortion statutes from judicial review [329] [330] [331] This maneuver has weakened Roe and undercut the federal judiciary's ability to protect abortion rights from state legislation [332]\n\n\nDobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization\nDobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization is a case that was a legal challenge to Mississippi's 2018 Gestational Age Act, which had banned abortions after 15 weeks with exceptions only for medical emergencies or fetal abnormalities Federal courts had enjoined the state from enforcing the law after the state's only abortion clinic, Jackson Women's Health Organization, filed suit immediately after passage; the federal courts stated that the law violated the previously established 24-week point of viability Mississippi asked the Supreme Court to hear the case on June 15, 2020, and the Court certified the petition on May 17, 2021, limited to the question, \"Whether all pre-viability prohibitions on elective abortions are unconstitutional.\" [333] The Court chose not to take up two other questions that Mississippi wanted to bring before the Court [333]\n\n\nRole in politics\nGenerally, presidential opinions following Roe have been split along major party lines The decision was opposed by presidents Gerald Ford, [344] Ronald Reagan, [345] George W Bush, [346] and Donald Trump [347] President George H W Bush also opposed Roe, though he had supported abortion rights earlier in his career [348] [349]\n\n\nPresidential positions\nGenerally, presidential opinions following Roe have been split along major party lines The decision was opposed by presidents Gerald Ford, [344] Ronald Reagan, [345] George W Bush, [346] and Donald Trump [347] President George H W Bush also opposed Roe, though he had supported abortion rights earlier in his career [348] [349]\n\n\nFederal bills or laws regarding Roe\nFederal bills, amendments, or laws regarding Roe include the Women's Health Protection Act, Freedom of Choice Act, Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, Born-Alive Infants Protection Act, Unborn Victims of Violence Act, Interstate Abortion Bill, No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1995, Sanctity of Human Life Act, Sanctity of Life Act, Hyde Amendment, Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, and the Baby Doe Law.\n\n\nState laws regarding Roe\nAt the state level, there have been many laws about abortion In the decade after Roe, most states passed laws protecting medical workers with a conscientious objection to abortion Nine states which had legalized abortion or loosened abortion restrictions prior to Roe already had statutory protection for those who did not want to participate in or perform an abortion As of 2011, forty-seven states and the District of Columbia had laws allowing certain people to decline to perform certain actions or provide information related to abortion or reproductive health [368] At the federal level, the Church Amendment of 1973 was proposed to protect private hospitals objecting to abortion from being deprived of funding It first passed the Senate, 92–1, then a slightly modified version passed the House, 372–1, and the final bill which contained it passed the Senate 94–0 [369] Justice Blackmun supported this and other regulations protecting individual physicians and entire hospitals operated by religious denominations [370]\n\n\nLegacy\nRoe v Wade caused a 4.5% decline in births in states that had not previously legalized abortion [391] According to a 2019 study, if Roe v Wade is reversed and some states prohibit abortion on demand, the increases in travel distance are estimated to prevent at a low estimate of over 90,000 women and at a high estimate of over 140,000 women from having abortions in the year following the ruling's overturning [392] If Roe were to be overturned by a constitutional amendment which would apply to all the states, fertility could be expected to increase by 11% because then mothers would not travel to states where abortion is legal [393] Although the legalization of abortion in the United States increased the labor supply of fertile-aged women in the workforce, it decreased the labor supply of older women This is thought to be due to the fact they now had fewer opportunities to financially support grandchildren Older women whose labors became less necessary for the family's financial wellbeing either left or stayed out of the workforce [394] Since Roe, the risk of death due to legal abortion fell considerably due to increased physician skills, improved medical technology, and earlier termination of pregnancy [395] Various studies have shown that overturning Roe could have adverse socio-economic conditions, higher maternal mortality, [396] and other negative impacts [392] [397] [398]\n\n\nEffects of legalization\nRoe v Wade caused a 4.5% decline in births in states that had not previously legalized abortion [391] According to a 2019

women whose labors became less necessary for the family's financial wellbeing either left or stayed out of the workforce [394] Since Roe, the risk of death due to legal abortion fell considerably due to increased physician skills, improved medical technology, and earlier termination of pregnancy [395] Various studies have shown that overturning Roe could have adverse socio-economic conditions, higher maternal mortality, [396] and other negative impacts [392] [397] [398]\n\n\nOpinion polls\nInto the 21st century, polls of Americans' opinions about abortion indicated they are about equally divided Several organizations, among them Gallup, [405] [406] Pew Research Center, [407] and Harris Insights & Analytics, [408] [409] conduct abortion or Roe v Wade-related polls Regarding the Roe decision as a whole, more Americans supported it than supported overturning it [410] In the 2000s, when pollsters describe various regulations that Roe prevented legislatures from enacting, support for Roe dropped [410] [411]\n\n\nSee also\nAdditional references\n\n\nReferences\nAdditional references\n\n\nFurther reading\nWritten opinions\n\n\nExternal links\nWritten opinions\n\n", "lang": "en",

Wade is a landmark Supreme Court case that was decided on January 22, 1973. The case involved a challenge to a Texas law that prohibited abortion except when necessary to save the life of the mother. The case was brought by a pregnant woman, known as \"Jane Roe,\" who was seeking to have an abortion. The Supreme Court ultimately ruled in favor of Roe, holding that a woman's right to choose to have an abortion is protected by the Constitution.\n\n**Background**\n\nAbortion was a fairly common practice in the history of the United States, and was not always a public controversy. At a time when society was more concerned with the serious consequences of women becoming pregnant out of wedlock, family affairs were handled out of public view. The criminality of abortion at common law is a matter of debate by historians and legal scholars.\n\n**History of Abortion Laws in the United States**\n\nAbortion was a fairly common practice in the history of the United States, and was not always a public controversy. At a time when society was more concerned with the serious consequences of women becoming pregnant out of wedlock, family affairs were handled out of public view. The criminality of abortion at common law is a matter of debate by historians and legal scholars.\n\n**History of the Case**\n\nThe case of Roe v. Wade began in 1969 when Sarah Weddington, a young lawyer, recruited Linda Coffee to help her with abortion litigation. Their first plaintiffs were a married couple; they joined after the woman heard Coffee give a speech. The intended suit would state abortions were medically necessary for the woman. The woman had a neurochemical disorder and it was considered medically necessary that she not give birth or raise children, yet they did not want to abstain from sex, and contraception might fail.\n\n**Hearing the Case**\n\nRoe v. Wade reached the Supreme Court when both sides appealed in 1970. It bypassed the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit because 28 USC § 1253 authorizes a direct appeal to the Supreme Court in cases concerning the granting or denial of a civil injunction decided by a three-judge panel. The case continued under the name Roe v. Wade instead of being switched to Wade v. Roe.\n\n**Postponement**\n\nThe justices delayed taking action on Roe and a closely related case, Doe v. Bolton, until they had first decided certain other cases. One case they decided first was Younger v. Harris. The justices felt the appeals raised difficult questions on judicial jurisdiction.\n\n**Oral Argument**\n\nAs she began speaking for the oral argument, Sarah Weddington was unaware that the Court had decided to hear the case to decide which courts had jurisdiction to hear it rather than as an attempt to overturn abortion laws in a broad ruling. She began by bringing up constitutional reasons why the Court should overturn Texas's abortion law, but Justice Stewart asked questions directed towards the jurisdiction question instead. Weddington replied that she saw no problem with jurisdiction and continued to talk about a constitutional right to abortion.\n\n**Initial Discussions**\n\nAfter the first argument session, Burger assigned the task of writing the Court's opinions for both Roe and Doe to Blackmun. Douglas suggested to Blackmun that Burger assigned the opinions to him out of malicious intention, but Blackmun disagreed. He knew that Burger could not write it himself because the abortion was too controversial, and his opinions might get rejected by the majority.\n\n**Opinion of the Court**\n\nJustice Harry Blackmun authored the opinion of the Court—the \"majority opinion\"—and was joined by six other justices: Chief Justice Warren Burger and Justices Potter Stewart, William J. Brennan Jr., William O. Douglas, Thurgood Marshall, and Lewis F. Powell Jr. The opinion first addressed several legal questions involving procedure and justiciability, and then proceeded to the main issue of the case: the constitutionality of Texas's abortion law.\n\n**Mootness**\n\nAfter reciting the facts of the case, the Court's opinion first addressed several legal questions involving procedure and justiciability. These included mootness, a legal doctrine that prevents American federal courts from hearing cases that have ceased to be \"live\" controversies because of intervening events. Under a normal application of the doctrine, McCorvey's appeal would have been considered moot because she had already given birth to her child and therefore no longer had a pregnancy to abort.\n\n**Abortion and Right to Privacy**\n\nThe Court proceeded to the main issue of the case: the constitutionality of Texas's abortion law. The Court first surveyed abortion's status throughout the history of Roman law and the English and early American common law. It also reviewed the developments of medical procedures and technology used in abortions.\n\n**Concurrences**\n\nThree justices from the majority filed concurring opinions in the case. Justice Potter Stewart wrote a concurring opinion in which he said that even though the Constitution makes no mention of the right to choose to have an abortion without interference, he thought the Court's decision was a permissible interpretation of the doctrine of substantive due process.\n\n**Dissents**\n\nJustices Byron White and William Rehnquist dissented from the Court's decision. White's dissent argued that the Court had no basis for deciding between the competing values of pregnant women and unborn children.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThere was a strong response to the decision shortly after it was issued. The Catholic Church condemned the ruling. Prominent organized groups that responded to Roe include National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws, which became the National Abortion Rights Action League in late 1973 to reflect the Court's repeal of restrictive laws.\n\n**Support for Roe and Abortion Rights**\n\nIn the 1960s, there was an alliance between the population control movement and the abortion-rights movement in the United States. Abortion rights were especially supported by younger women within the population control movement. The cooperation was mostly due to feminists who wanted some of the popularity already enjoyed by the population control movement.\n\n**Opposition to Roe**\n\nThe Catholic Church condemned the ruling by the Supreme Court. Blackmun wrote in his diary, \"Abortion flak—3 Cardinals—Vatican—Rochester wires!\"\n\n**Legacy**\n\nRoe v. Wade caused a 4.5% decline in births in states that had not previously legalized abortion. According to a 2019 study, if Roe v. Wade is reversed and some states prohibit abortion on demand, the increases in travel distance are estimated to prevent at a low estimate of over 90,000 women and at a high estimate of over 140,000 women from having abortions in the year following the ruling's overturning.\n\n**Effects of Legalization**\n\nRoe v. Wade caused a 4.5% decline in births in states that had not previously legalized abortion. Since Roe, the risk of death due to legal abortion fell considerably due to increased physician skills, improved medical technology, and earlier termination of pregnancy.\n\n**Opinion Polls**\n\nInto the 21st century, polls of Americans' opinions about abortion indicated they are about equally divided. More Americans supported the Roe decision than supported overturning it. In the 2000s, when pollsters describe various regulations that Roe prevented legislatures from enacting, support for Roe dropped.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about

woman who wanted an abortion and would be willing to be a plaintiff.\" [56] They also wanted to increase the likelihood that the panel selection would help them win in court They wanted to present their case to a three-judge panel which included a judge they thought would be sympathetic, [56] which was a possibility only by filing a case in Dallas [57]  If either of the two cases they filed in Dallas were assigned favorably, they intended to ask for the other one to be consolidated with it [56]\n\n\nHearing the case\nRoe v Wade reached the Supreme Court when both sides appealed in 1970 It

why the Court should overturn Texas's abortion law, but Justice Stewart asked questions directed towards the jurisdiction question instead Weddington replied that she saw no problem with jurisdiction and continued to talk about a constitutional right to abortion [91] Overall, she spent between 20 and 30 minutes discussing jurisdiction and procedure instead of constitutional issues [88]\n\n\nInitial discussions\nAfter the first argument session, Burger assigned the task of writing the Court's opinions for both Roe and Doe to Blackmun [95] Douglas suggested to Blackmun that Burger assigned the opinions to him out of malicious intention, but Blackmun disagreed He knew that Burger could not write it himself because the abortion was too controversial, and his opinions might get rejected by the majority He also understood why the other justices could not be assigned to write the opinions: Douglas was too liberal for the public to accept his word Likewise, he might split the Court's vote by writing something radical In addition, the quality of his opinions had suffered recently Brennan was the only Catholic on the Court, and he would have to face Catholic political groups which were against abortion If Marshall wrote the opinions, the ruling would be perceived as being directed towards African Americans, and he would have to face the displeasure of African American political groups Stewart would have trouble going far enough in legalizing abortion [96]\n\n\nDrafting the opinion\nBlackmun continued to work on his opinions in both cases over the summer recess, even though there was no guarantee that he would be assigned to write them again Over the recess, he spent a week researching the history of abortion at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, where he had worked in the 1950s He talked daily on the phone with George Frampton, his 28-year-old law clerk who stayed behind in Washington, D.C [106] Frampton researched the history of abortion using a book authored by Lawrence Lader, the founding chairman of what is now called NARAL Pro-Choice America Blackmun's papers made available since his death contain at least seven citations [107] for Lader's 1966 book, Abortion [106] Chapter 16 of his book, \"A Blueprint for Changing U.S Abortion Laws\" predicted that if abortion were to be legalized, \"the possibility of community opposition is slight\" [108] Lader also predicted that \"If such a theoretical case was carried to a high court, perhaps even the U.S Supreme Court, and the judges confirmed a broad interpretation of the meaning of a threat to life, undoubtedly a landmark in abortion decisions would be reached.\" [109]\n\n\nSupreme Court decision\nOn January 22, 1973, the Supreme Court issued a 7–2 decision in favor of \"Jane Roe\" (Norma McCorvey) holding that women in the United States had a fundamental right to choose whether to have abortions without excessive government restriction and striking down Texas's abortion ban as unconstitutional The decision was issued together with a decision in a companion case, Doe v Bolton, which involved a similar challenge to Georgia's abortion laws [2]\n\n\nOpinion of the Court\nJustice Harry Blackmun authored the opinion of the Court—the \"majority opinion\"—and was joined by six other justices: Chief Justice Warren Burger and Justices Potter Stewart, William J Brennan Jr., William O Douglas, Thurgood Marshall, and Lewis F Powell Jr.\n\n\nMootness\nAfter reciting the facts of the case, the Court's opinion first addressed several legal questions involving procedure and justiciability These included mootness, a legal doctrine that prevents American federal courts from hearing cases that have ceased to be \"live\" controversies because of intervening events [119] Under a normal application of the doctrine, McCorvey's appeal would have been considered moot because she had already given birth to her child and therefore no longer had a pregnancy to abort [120]\n\n\nAbortion and right to privacy\nAfter dealing with mootness and standing, the Court proceeded to the main issue of the case: the constitutionality of Texas's abortion law The Court first surveyed abortion's status throughout the history of Roman law and the English and early American common law [6] It also reviewed the developments of medical procedures and technology used in abortions [6]\n\n\nConcurrences\nThree justices from the majority filed concurring opinions in the case Justice Potter Stewart wrote a concurring opinion in which he said that even though the Constitution makes no mention of the right to choose to have an abortion without interference, he thought the Court's decision was a permissible interpretation of the doctrine of substantive due process, which says that the Due Process Clause's protection of liberty extends beyond simple procedures and protects certain fundamental rights [129] [7] Justice William O Douglas's concurring opinion described his view that although the Court was correct to find that the right to choose to have an abortion was a fundamental right, he thought it would have been better to derive it from the Ninth Amendment—which states that the fact that a right is not specifically enumerated in the Constitution shall not be construed to mean that American people do not possess it—rather than through the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause [129] [7]\n\n\nDissents\nJustices Byron White and William Rehnquist dissented from the Court's decision [7]  White's dissent, which was issued with Roe's companion case, Doe v Bolton, argued that the Court had no basis for deciding between the competing values of pregnant women and unborn children: \n\n\nReception\nThere was a strong response to the decision shortly after it was issued [143] The Catholic Church condemned the ruling [144] Prominent organized groups that responded to Roe include National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws, which became the National Abortion Rights Action League in late 1973 to reflect the Court's repeal of restrictive laws, [145] and the National Right to Life Committee [146]\n\n\nSupport for Roe and abortion rights\nIn the 1960s, there was an alliance between the population control movement and the abortion-rights movement in the United States [148] Abortion rights were especially supported by younger women within the population control movement [149] The cooperation was mostly due to feminists who wanted some of the popularity already enjoyed by the population control movement [citation needed] In addition, population control advocates thought that legalizing abortion would help solve the coming population crisis that demographers had projected [148]\n\n\n1960s–1970s\nIn the 1960s, there was an alliance between the population control movement and the abortion-rights movement in the United States [148] Abortion rights were especially supported by younger women within the population control movement [149] The cooperation was mostly due to feminists who wanted some of the popularity already enjoyed by the population control movement [citation needed] In addition, population control advocates thought that legalizing abortion would help solve the coming population crisis that demographers had projected [148]\n\n\n21st century\nInto the 21st century, advocates of Roe describe it as vital to the preservation of women's rights, personal freedom, bodily integrity, and privacy Advocates have also reasoned that access to safe abortion and reproductive freedom generally are fundamental rights Supporters of Roe contend that even if abortion rights are also supported by another portion of the constitution, the decision in 1973 accurately founds the right in the Fourteenth Amendment Others support Roe despite concern that the fundamental right to abortion is found elsewhere in the Constitution but not in the portions referenced in the 1973 decision [162] [163] They also tend to believe that the power balance between men and women is unequal, and that issues like access to birth control and political representation affect women's equality [164]\n\n\nOpposition to Roe\nThe Catholic Church condemned the ruling by the Supreme Court [144] Blackmun wrote in his diary, \"Abortion flak—3 Cardinals—Vatican—Rochester wires!\" [144]\n\n\nCondemnation by Catholic Bishops\nThe Catholic Church condemned the ruling by the Supreme Court [144] Blackmun wrote in his diary, \"Abortion flak—3 Cardinals—Vatican—Rochester wires!\" [144]\n\n\nOpposition to Roe but support for abortion rights\nSome supporters of abortion rights oppose Roe v Wade on the grounds that it laid a foundation for abortion in civil rights rather than in human rights, which are broader and would require government entities to take active measures to ensure every woman has access to abortion [16] [page needed] This particular position is indicated by the use of rhetoric concerning \"reproductive justice\", which replaces earlier rhetoric centered around \"choice\", such as the \"pro-choice\" label [179] Reproductive justice proponents contend that factors permitting choice are unequal, thus perpetuating oppression and serving to divide women [180] Reproductive justice advocates instead want abortion to be considered an affirmative right that the government would be obligated to guarantee equal access to, even if the women seeking abortions are nonwhite, poor, or live outside major metropolitan areas [181] With a broader interpretation of the right to an abortion, it would be possible to require all new obstetricians to be in favor of abortion rights, lest as professionals they employ conscience clauses and refuse to perform abortions [182] In the 1989 decision of Webster v Reproductive Health Services, the Supreme Court ruled against an affirmative right to nontherapeutic abortions and noted that states would not be required to pay for them [183]\n\n\nOpposition to both Roe and abortion rights\nEvery year, on the anniversary of the decision, opponents of abortion march up Constitution Avenue to the Supreme Court Building in Washington, D.C., in the March for Life [185] Around 250,000 people attended the march until 2010 [186] [187] Estimates put the 2011 and 2012 attendances at 400,000 each, [188] and the 2013 March for Life drew an estimated 650,000 people [189] The march was started in October 1973 by Nellie Gray and the first march took place on January 22, 1974, to mark the first anniversary of Roe v Wade.\n\n\nResponses within the legal profession\nLiberal and feminist legal scholars have had various reactions to Roe, not always giving the decision unqualified support One argument is that Justice Blackmun reached the correct result but went about it the wrong way [12] Another is that the end achieved by Roe does not justify its means of judicial fiat [14]\n\n\nLater responses by those involved\nJustice Blackmun, who authored the Roe decision, subsequently had mixed feelings about his role in the case During a 1974 television interview, he stated that Roe \"will be regarded as one of the worst mistakes in the court's history or one of its great decisions, a turning point.\" [222]\n\n\nHarry Blackmun\nJustice Blackmun, who authored the Roe decision, subsequently had mixed feelings about his role in the case During a 1974 television interview, he stated that Roe \"will be regarded as one of the worst mistakes in the court's history or one of its great decisions, a turning point.\" [222]\n\n\nNorma McCorvey\nA few years after the Supreme Court decided Roe, Norma McCorvey made a claim—which she recanted many years later—that she had a nightmare about \"little babies lying around with daggers in their hearts\" She said this was the first of recurring nightmares that kept her awake at night [228] She became worried and wondered, \"What really, had I done?\" [229] and \"Well, how do they kill a baby inside a mother's stomach anyway?\" McCorvey later claimed:\n\n\nSarah Weddington\nAfter arguing in Roe v Wade at the age of 26, Sarah Weddington was elected to the Texas House of Representatives for three terms Weddington also was general counsel for the U.S Department of Agriculture, an assistant to President Jimmy Carter, [244] lecturer at the Texas Wesleyan University School of Law, and speaker and adjunct professor at the University of Texas at Austin [245]\n\n\nSubsequent judicial developments\nRoe is embedded in a long line of cases concerning personal liberty in the realm of privacy, since Roe was based on individual liberty cases concerning privacy like Meyer v Nebraska (1923), Griswold v Connecticut (1965), Loving v Virginia (1967) and Eisenstadt v Baird (1972) [249] [250] [251] and became a foundation for individual liberty cases concerning privacy like Lawrence v Texas (2003) and Obergefell v Hodges (2015) [250] [252]\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood v. Danforth\nIn Planned Parenthood v Danforth, 428 U.S 52 (1976), [275] the plaintiffs challenged a Missouri statute which regulated abortion In the regulations for abortions on demand, the state required prior written consent from a parent if the patient was a minor or a spouse if the patient was married For pregnancies at 12 weeks and later, the statute also banned saline abortions, [276] in which chemicals are injected into the amniotic sac to burn the fetus [277] The portions of the statute involving parental or spousal consent and prohibiting saline abortions were struck down [276]\n\n\nFloyd v. Anders\nIn Floyd v Anders, 440 F Supp 535 (D.S.C 1977), South Carolina attempted to prosecute a doctor for illegal abortion and murder after he attempted to abort an African American boy at 25 weeks During the abortion, the boy was born alive and survived for 20 days before dying [278] His prosecution was blocked by Judge Clement Haynsworth, and shortly afterwards by a unanimous three judge panel for the U.S District Court for the District of South Carolina Judge Haynsworth, writing for the panel, stated \"Indeed, the Supreme Court declared the fetus in the womb is neither alive nor a person within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" [279] John T Noonan criticized this from an anti-abortion perspective, stating that \"Judge Haynsworth had replaced the Supreme Court's test of potential ability to live with a new test of actual ability to live indefinitely He also had spelled out what was implied in Roe v Wade but never actually stated there For the American legal systems the fetus in the womb was not alive.\" [280] The standard in Roe for viability outside the womb required a \"capability of meaningful life\" [281] Without this capability, the state had no compelling \"important and legitimate interest in potential life\" [281]\n\n\nWebster v. Reproductive Health Services\nIn a 5–4 decision in 1989's Webster v Reproductive Health Services, Chief Justice Rehnquist, writing for the Court, declined to explicitly overrule Roe, because \"none of the challenged provisions of the Missouri Act properly before us conflict with the Constitution.\" In particular, the Court found that the ability to have a nontherapeutic abortion was not an affirmative right of the sort that required the state to pay for it [183] In this case, the Court upheld several abortion restrictions, and modified the Roe trimester framework [183]\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood v. Casey\nDuring initial deliberations for Planned Parenthood v Casey (1992), an initial majority of five justices (Rehnquist, White, Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas) were willing to effectively overturn Roe Justice Kennedy changed his mind after the initial conference, [282] and Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter joined Justices Blackmun and Stevens to reaffirm the central holding of Roe, [283] but instead of justifying the liberty to abort as being based on privacy as in Roe, it justified the liberty in a broader manner The opinion asserted an individual's liberty to choose concerning family life and also protection from legal enforcement intended to maintain traditional sex roles, writing, [284] \"Our law affords constitutional protection to personal decisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education. ...\" [285] and against the state insisting \"upon its own vision of the woman's role, however dominant that vision has been in the course of our history and our culture The destiny of the woman must be shaped to a large extent on her own conception of her spiritual imperatives and her place in society.\" [286]\n\n\nStenberg v. Carhart\nDuring the 1990s, Nebraska enacted a law banning partial-birth abortion The law allowed another second-trimester abortion procedure known as dilation and evacuation In 2000, the Supreme Court struck down the law by a 5–4 vote in Stenberg v Carhart, with Justice Stephen Breyer writing for the majority that sometimes partial-birth abortion \"would be the safest procedure\" [294] Justice O'Connor wrote a concurrence stating Nebraska was actually banning both abortion methods [295] Justices Ginsburg and Stevens joined each other's concurrences Justice Stevens stated that \"the notion that either of these two equally gruesome procedures performed at this late stage of gestation is more akin to infanticide than the other .. is simply irrational.\" [296] Justice Ginsburg stated that the \"law does not save any fetus from destruction, for it targets only 'a method of performing abortion'.\" [297]\n\n\nGonzales v. Carhart\nIn 2003, Congress passed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, [302] which led to a lawsuit in the case of Gonzales v Carhart [303] The Court previously ruled in Stenberg v Carhart that a state's ban on partial-birth abortion was unconstitutional because such a ban did not have an exception for the health of the woman [304] The membership of the Court changed after Stenberg, with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito replacing Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice O'Connor [305] [306] The ban at issue in Gonzales v Carhart was similar to the one in Stenberg, [304] but had been adjusted to comply with the Court's ruling [307]\n\n\nDubay v. Wells\nDubay v Wells was a 2006 paternity case where a man argued he should not have to pay child support for a child he did not want to parent The case was billed as \"Roe v Wade for men\" [312]\n\n\nWhole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt\nIn 2013, the Texas legislature enacted restrictions which required abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at a local hospital and required abortion clinics to have facilities equivalent to others which conducted outpatient surgery [315] On June 27, 2016, the Supreme Court in a 5–3 decision for Whole Woman's Health v Hellerstedt struck down these restrictions [315]\n\n\nBox v. Planned Parenthood\nIn 2016, Indiana passed House Bill 1337, enacting a law which regulated what is done with fetal remains and banning abortion for sexist, racist, or ableist purposes [317] In its unsigned 2019 ruling for Box v Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Inc., the U.S Supreme Court upheld the regulations about fetal remains, but declined to hear the remainder of the law, which had been blocked by lower courts [318] Justice Ginsburg dissented from the part of the ruling about fetal remains on the basis that the regulations violated Casey [319] She also criticized Justice Thomas over his use of the word \"mother\" in his concurrence [320]\n\n\nWhole Woman's Health v. Jackson\nIn 2021, the state of Texas devised a legal workaround to Roe that allowed it to successfully outlaw abortion at six weeks of pregnancy despite the continued existence of Roe and Casey In the Texas Heartbeat Act, the legislature created a novel enforcement mechanism that bars state officials from enforcing the statute and authorizes private individuals to sue anyone who performs or assists an illegal abortion [324] [325] Because the Act is enforced by private citizens rather than government officials, there are no state officials that abortion providers can sue to stop the enforcement of the law, and they cannot obtain judicial relief that will stop private lawsuits from being initiated against them [326] This has produced an end-run around Roe because the threat of private civil-enforcement lawsuits has forced abortion providers to comply with the Act despite its incompatibility with the Supreme Court's abortion pronouncements [327] [328] Other states have copied this enforcement mechanism to sidestep Roe and immunize their anti-abortion statutes from judicial review [329] [330] [331] This maneuver has weakened Roe and undercut the federal judiciary's ability to protect abortion rights from state legislation [332]\n\n\nDobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization\nDobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization is a case that was a legal challenge to Mississippi's 2018 Gestational Age Act, which had banned abortions after 15 weeks with exceptions only for medical emergencies or fetal abnormalities Federal courts had enjoined the state from enforcing the law after the state's only abortion clinic, Jackson Women's Health Organization, filed suit immediately after passage; the federal courts stated that the law violated the previously established 24-week point of viability Mississippi asked the Supreme Court to hear the case on June 15, 2020, and the Court certified the petition on May 17, 2021, limited to the question, \"Whether all pre-viability prohibitions on elective abortions are unconstitutional.\" [333] The Court chose not to take up two other questions that Mississippi wanted to bring before the Court [333]\n\n\nRole in politics\nGenerally, presidential opinions following Roe have been split along major party lines The decision was opposed by presidents Gerald Ford, [344] Ronald Reagan, [345] George W Bush, [346] and Donald Trump [347] President George H W Bush also opposed Roe, though he had supported abortion rights earlier in his career [348] [349]\n\n\nPresidential positions\nGenerally, presidential opinions following Roe have been split along major party lines The decision was opposed

Ban Act, Born-Alive Infants Protection Act, Unborn Victims of Violence Act, Interstate Abortion Bill, No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1995, Sanctity of Human Life Act, Sanctity of Life Act, Hyde Amendment, Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, and the Baby Doe Law.\n\n\nState laws regarding Roe\nAt the state level, there have been many laws about abortion In the decade after Roe, most states passed laws protecting medical workers with a conscientious objection to abortion Nine states which had legalized abortion or loosened abortion restrictions prior to Roe already had statutory protection for those who did not want to participate in or perform an abortion As of 2011, forty-seven states and the District of Columbia had laws allowing certain people to decline to perform certain actions or provide information related to abortion or reproductive health [368] At the federal level, the Church Amendment of 1973 was proposed to protect private hospitals objecting to abortion from being deprived of funding It first passed the Senate, 92–1, then a slightly modified version passed the House, 372–1, and the final bill which contained it passed the Senate 94–0 [369] Justice Blackmun supported this and other regulations protecting individual physicians and entire hospitals operated by religious denominations [370]\n\n\nLegacy\nRoe v Wade caused a 4.5% decline in births in states that had not previously legalized abortion [391] According to a 2019 study, if Roe v Wade is reversed and some states prohibit abortion on demand, the increases in travel distance are estimated to prevent at a low estimate of over 90,000 women and at a high estimate of over 140,000 women from having abortions in the year following the ruling's overturning [392] If Roe were to be overturned by a constitutional amendment which would apply to all the states, fertility could be expected to increase by 11% because then mothers would not travel to states where abortion is legal [393] Although the legalization of abortion in the United States increased the labor supply of fertile-aged women in the workforce, it decreased the labor supply of older women This is thought to be due to the fact they now had fewer opportunities to financially support grandchildren Older women whose labors became less necessary for the family's financial wellbeing either left or stayed out of the workforce [394] Since Roe, the risk of death due to legal abortion fell considerably due to increased physician skills, improved medical technology, and earlier termination of pregnancy [395] Various studies have shown that overturning Roe could have adverse socio-economic conditions, higher maternal mortality, [396] and other negative impacts [392] [397] [398]\n\n\nEffects of legalization\nRoe v Wade caused a 4.5% decline in births in states that had not previously legalized abortion [391] According to a 2019

higher maternal mortality, [396] and other negative impacts [392] [397] [398]\n\n\nOpinion polls\nInto the 21st century, polls of Americans' opinions about abortion indicated they are about equally divided Several organizations, among them Gallup, [405] [406] Pew Research Center, [407] and Harris Insights & Analytics, [408] [409] conduct abortion or Roe v Wade-related polls Regarding the Roe decision as a whole, more Americans supported it than supported overturning it [410] In the 2000s, when pollsters describe various regulations that Roe prevented legislatures from enacting, support for Roe dropped [410] [411]\n\n\nSee also\nAdditional references\n\n\nReferences\nAdditional references\n\n\nFurther reading\nWritten opinions\n\n\nExternal links\nWritten

was published on March 5 The Court agreed with Halep’s contention that her positive test was likely caused by contamination of a supplement she had been using Though the Court determined Halep did bear some level of fault or negligence for using the supplement, it did not rise to the level to justify a multi-year ban Therefore the Court´s decision reduced the original four-year ban levied by the International Tennis Federation to nine months, which Halep had already served [191]\nHalep was cleared for immediate return from suspension [192]\n\n\nNational representation\nHalep made her

a lot of balls back in play to someone who plays more aggressively Journalist Louisa Thomas has compared her improved style of play to that of Novak Djokovic as someone who can hit strong but simple winners from defensive positions where opponents would expect a less aggressive shot She can hit winners both cross-court and down-the-line During points, Halep strives to disrupt her opponent's rhythm She uses her speed and anticipation to set up powerful shots rather than just extend points [32] [222] Her fluidity and balance have been credited as the basis for this style of play that is both aggressive and defensive [223]\n\n\nCoaching team\nAs a junior, Halep was coached by Ioan Stan in Constanța [4] She began working with Firicel Tomai in 2008 [227] After five years, she switched

tennis player born on September 27, 1991, in Constanța, Romania to Stere and Tania Halep. She is of Aromanian descent and has a brother, Nicolae, who is five and a half years older. Halep's father played lower-division football for AS Săgeata Stejaru and worked as a zootechnics technician before becoming the owner of a dairy products factory. He developed an interest in supporting his children's athletic ventures after wondering how far he would have progressed as a footballer if his parents could have provided him with more financial support when he was young.\n\n## Early life and background\n\nHalep started playing tennis at the age of four after attending one of her brother's training sessions. Her brother stopped playing tennis after a few years, but Simona continued practicing twice a week until she was six. She also played football and handball while growing up. Growing up in Constanța, Halep routinely trained on the beaches and in the water of the Black Sea. She was sponsored by Corneliu Idu, the owner of the leading tennis club in Constanța, and later moved away from her family to train in Bucharest.\n\n## Junior career\n\nHalep began playing on the ITF Junior Circuit in 2005 at the age of 13 and finished runner-up at the low-level Grade 4 Mamaia-Sen Junior ITF Tournament in Romania in her second career event. The following year, she won all four ITF singles events she entered, including the Mamaia-Sen tournament, which was reclassified to mid-level Grade 3 after her first win. Halep also represented Romania at the Junior Fed Cup alongside Irina-Camelia Begu and Andreea Mitu.

Throughout his career, he appeared in a wide range of film and television productions, earning numerous awards and nominations.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nWilliam Hurt was born on March 20, 1950, in Washington, D.C., to Claire Isabel (née McGill) and Alfred McChord Hurt. His father worked for the United States Agency for International Development and the State Department, which led to the family's relocation to various countries, including Lahore, Mogadishu, and Khartoum. Hurt's parents divorced, and his mother married Henry Luce III, a son of publisher Henry Luce, in 1960.\n\nHurt's early life was marked by a diverse cultural background and exposure to different environments. His family's nomadic lifestyle instilled in him a sense of adaptability and a strong work ethic, which would serve him well in his future endeavors. Despite the challenges posed by his family's frequent relocations, Hurt developed a keen interest in the arts, particularly in music and theater.\n\n**Career**\n\nHurt began his career in stage productions, joining the acting company at Circle Repertory Company in 1977. During his tenure, he won an Obie Award for his debut appearance in Corinne Jacker's \"My Life\" and a 1978 Theatre World Award for his performances in \"Fifth of July,\" \"Ulysses in Traction,\" and \"Lulu.\" His early success on stage laid the foundation for his future work in film and television.\n\nIn 1979, Hurt played Hamlet under the direction of Marshall W Mason, opposite Lindsay Crouse and Beatrice Straight. This production marked a significant milestone in his career, as it showcased his range and versatility as an actor.

However, his most notable relationship was with Sandra Jennings, whom he dated in the 1980s. Jennings sued Hurt in New York, seeking recognition of their relationship as a common-law marriage under South Carolina law. The court ultimately ruled in Hurt's favor, finding that no marriage existed.\n\nDuring the lawsuit, Jennings alleged that Hurt subjected her to physical and verbal abuse. Hurt's spokesperson denied the allegations, stating that Hurt never beat Jennings. The controversy surrounding the lawsuit and the allegations of domestic violence marked a difficult period in Hurt's personal life.\n\n**Domestic Violence Allegations**\n\nThe allegations of domestic violence made by Sandra Jennings against Hurt in 1986 sparked a media frenzy and raised questions about Hurt's behavior towards women. The lawsuit and the subsequent media coverage had a significant impact on Hurt's personal and professional life.\n\nIn a 1986 interview with a journalist, Hurt denied the allegations, stating that he had never physically abused Jennings. However, the controversy surrounding the lawsuit and the allegations of domestic violence marked a difficult period in Hurt's personal life.\n\n**Death and Tributes**\n\nHurt died on March 13, 2022, at his home in Portland, Oregon, due to complications from bone-metastasized terminal prostate cancer. He was 71.

{"title": "Cruella_de_Vil", "content": "\nName\nThe name Cruella de Vil is a pun of the words cruel and devil, an allusion that is emphasized by having her English country house nicknamed 'Hell Hall' [3] The name 'de Vil' is also a literary allusion to Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897), in which the realty firm Mitchell, Sons & Candy write a letter to Lord Godalming, informing him that the purchaser of a house in Piccadilly, London is \"a foreign nobleman, Count De Ville\" Count De Ville, however, proves to be an alias for Count Dracula himself.\n\n\nThe Hundred and One Dalmatians novel\nCruella is depicted as a pampered and glamorous London heiress in the original story She was a former schoolmate of Mrs Dearly (one of the owners of the original Dalmatians), but Mrs Dearly says they were not friends because Cruella frightened her As a child, Cruella had one black plait and one white plait and was eventually expelled for drinking ink However, she appears to be on friendlier terms with Mrs Dearly by the novel's beginning, before Cruella steals the Dearlys' Dalmatian puppies, having noted they would make \"enchanting fur coats\" and that no one had thought of making coats of dog skins before [6]\n\n\nThe Starlight Barking novel\nIn Smith's 1967 sequel, The Starlight Barking, Cruella and her husband return to England and start a business selling metallic plastics Cruella, while still obsessed with heat and pepper, has lost her obsession with fur, replacing all her coats, sheets, cloaks etc with metallic plastic versions that are as impenetrable as armor She has dyed her hair to its normal black and white state When Sirius puts all the humans to sleep, the dogs and cats believe Cruella is responsible and decide to kill her once and for all, until they find she is asleep like everyone else and no longer a threat to them due to having lost interest in fur It is noted that she is the only one of the sleepers who does not look peaceful (even her husband snores away happily) but instead is grim and unhappy even in sleep She has repainted her house and removed the marble (artificial marble, according to the White Cat), so the walls now resemble angular psychedelic paintings, many of them portraits of herself.\n\n\nAnimated adaptations\nDisney's animated version of Cruella first appeared in 1961's One Hundred and One Dalmatians, in which she was voiced by Betty

claimed that Betty Lou Gerson's vocal performance was his greatest inspiration when it came to the character [9] Disney based its version of Cruella on the personality and mannerisms of Tallulah Bankhead, and her long, lanky physical design came from Mary Wickes, who served as her live-action model The cool detachment of the original character was replaced by a crazed mania, in which Cruella only barely clung to a sheen of glamour For unexplained reasons, Cruella's cat and husband were omitted from the Disney version Cruella drives a very distinctive automobile, colored red and black,

villains, and as such has featured prominently in popular culture.\n\n**In music**\n\nCruella de Vil has been referenced and parodied in various songs.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Cruella_de_Vil\" following this outline:\n\n\nName\nThe name Cruella de Vil is a pun of the words cruel and devil, an allusion that is emphasized by having her English country house nicknamed 'Hell Hall' [3] The name 'de Vil' is also a literary allusion to Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897), in which the realty firm Mitchell, Sons & Candy write a letter to Lord Godalming, informing him that the purchaser of a house in Piccadilly, London is \"a foreign nobleman, Count De Ville\" Count De Ville, however, proves to be an alias for Count Dracula himself.\n\n\nThe Hundred and One Dalmatians novel\nCruella is depicted as a pampered and glamorous London heiress in the original story She was a former schoolmate of Mrs Dearly (one of the owners of the original Dalmatians), but Mrs Dearly says they were not friends because Cruella frightened her As a child, Cruella had one black plait and one white plait and was eventually expelled for drinking ink However, she appears to be on friendlier terms with Mrs Dearly by the novel's beginning, before Cruella steals the Dearlys' Dalmatian puppies, having noted they would make \"enchanting fur coats\" and that no one had thought of making coats of dog skins before [6]\n\n\nThe Starlight Barking novel\nIn Smith's 1967 sequel, The Starlight Barking, Cruella and her husband return to England and start a business selling metallic plastics Cruella, while still obsessed with heat and pepper, has lost her obsession with fur, replacing all her coats, sheets, cloaks etc with metallic plastic versions that are as impenetrable as armor She has dyed her hair to its normal black and white state When Sirius puts all the humans to sleep, the dogs and cats believe Cruella is responsible and decide to kill her once and for all, until they find she is asleep like everyone else and no longer a threat to them due to having lost interest in fur It is noted that she is the only one of the sleepers who does not look peaceful (even her husband snores away happily) but instead is grim and unhappy even in sleep She has repainted her house and removed the marble (artificial marble, according to the White Cat), so the walls now resemble angular psychedelic paintings, many of them portraits of herself.\n\n\nAnimated adaptations\nDisney's animated version of Cruella first appeared in 1961's One Hundred and One Dalmatians, in which she was voiced by Betty Lou Gerson and animated by Marc Davis who together crafted her into an iconic and memorable character Cruella is one of the few characters to be completely controlled by a single animator, and Davis claimed that Betty Lou Gerson's vocal performance was his greatest inspiration when it came to the character [9] Disney based its version of Cruella on the personality and mannerisms of Tallulah Bankhead, and her long, lanky physical design came from Mary Wickes, who served as her live-action model The cool detachment of the original character was replaced by a crazed mania, in which Cruella only barely clung to a sheen of glamour For unexplained reasons, Cruella's cat and husband were omitted from the Disney version Cruella drives a very distinctive automobile, colored red and black, which strongly resembles a Mercedes-Benz 500K Cabriolet.\n\n\nOne Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961 film)\nDisney's animated version of Cruella first

antagonist of the 101 Dalmatians animated series, voiced by April Winchell in the majority of the episodes, and Tress MacNeille in the episodes \"Fungus Among Us\" and \"Close But No Cigar\" This Cruella is based on Glenn Close's portrayal from the live-action film, but with Marc Davis's design from the animated film She does not wear fur, usually does not smoke (although in the episodes \"Smoke Detectors\" and \"Hail to the Chief\" she did) and is totally sane, yet still temperamental and impatient Her villainous plot in the show was to steal the Dearlys' farm from them, using the puppies as a ransom Her mother Malevola de Vil demands she do this, and Cruella also was denied the farm by old Widow Smedly the first time she tried to buy it, incensing her and beginning her obsession.\n\n\n101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure\nCruella returns in 101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure, once again as the main antagonist, where she is now voiced by Susanne

to prison for her crimes She is prohibited from contacting the Radcliffes or their dogs and placed on probation which prohibits her from purchasing any more furs After being wrecked in the first film,

make the fur coat When he finds out, he turns on her and causes her to be injured by a machine She is later arrested for her crimes.\n\n\nOther Disney animations\nSusanne Blakeslee also voiced Cruella

specializes in fur couture The character of Anita (played by Joely Richardson) is a couturière and employee of De Vil Unlike the animated film, the live-action version provides another reason as to why Cruella wants to make the puppies into coats at a young age: their fur wouldn't be as soft and as fine as when they fully grow up At the start of the film, it is revealed that Cruella has secretly had her henchmen slaughter a white Siberian tiger at London Zoo for its pelt The suspicions and accusations of the Dearly family force Cruella to step up her plans to make the puppies into a coat, the puppies escaping while her henchmen are preparing to do the work and Cruella being subsequently thrown into a vat of molasses and a pig pen when she tries to track them to a farm At the end of the

him, she learned that her world, a perpetual 1920s England, was one of many Smitten with her, the Author gave her the power to control animals Cruella used the new power to have her mother's dalmatians kill her, and killed them and made their fur into a coat In a struggle to prevent the Author from writing another note about her, the vial of magic ink spills on her causing her blonde hair to turn into the iconic black and white However, the pen had a remnant of ink in it, which the Author used to write down a note that would, from there on, prevent Cruella from taking another life: \"Cruella De Vil can no longer take away the life of another\" Cruella kept this secret, as intimidation would still work for her needs.\n\n\nDescendants\nCruella De Vil appears in the 2015 Disney

many, indicating she may not be fully human Cruella and her husband do not leave England at the end of the story, and their fate is left unknown Furthermore, the Dearlys never figure out that Cruella

younger sister Marian (born 13 October 1798) survived past 20 years old [1]\n\n\nRelationship with Eliza Raine\nIn 1805, Anne Lister was sent to the Manor House School in York (in the King's Manor buildings), where Anne met her first love, Eliza Raine (1791–1860) [5] Raine was the illegitimate, half-Indian daughter of an East India Company surgeon in Madras, brought to Yorkshire after his death and set to inherit a substantial amount of money [6] Lister and Raine shared a bedroom at the boarding school  Raine later became a patient at Clifton House Asylum, run by Belcombe's father, William, in 1814 [7] [8] [page needed] Eliza Raine was later transferred to Terrace House in Osbaldwick and died there on 31 January 1860 She is buried in the Osbaldwick churchyard across the road [9]\n\n\nShibden Hall\nLister inherited the Shibden estate on her uncle's death in 1826, but she only controlled part of its income until the deaths of both her father and her aunt in 1836, when their shares of the income passed to her In addition to earnings from the agricultural tenancy, Lister's financial portfolio included properties in town, shares in the canal and railway industries, mining, and stone quarries Her wealth allowed her some measure of freedom to live as she pleased, and she used the income from her varied portfolio to finance her two passions: the renovation of Shibden Hall, and European travel [10]\n\n\nRelationship with Ann Walker\nAlthough Lister had met her on various occasions in the 1820s, Ann Walker—who by 1832 had become a wealthy heiress—took on a much more

themselves married, but without legal recognition The church has been described as \"an icon for what is interpreted as the site of the first lesbian marriage to be held in Britain\", and the building

recording in secret code parcels sent to and from Eliza Raine, and eventually became the 26 quarto volumes, ending at her death in 1840 In addition to her handwriting being difficult to decipher, [10] around one-sixth of the diary is encrypted in a simple code Eliza and she had devised, combining the Greek alphabet, zodiac, punctuation, and mathematical symbols, [11] and it describes in great detail her lesbian identity and affairs, [40] as well as the methods she used for seduction The diaries also contain her thoughts on the weather, social events, national events, and her business interests The majority of her diary deals with her daily life, and not merely her sexuality, [13] and provides detailed information on social, political, and economic events of the time.\n\n\nResearch\nWork by Dorothy Thompson and Patricia Hughes in the late 1980s at Birmingham University's Department of Modern History resulted in translation of much of the code, as well as discovery of the first juvenile Lister diaries and decoding of the other two Lister codes [citation needed] Hughes self-published The Early Life of Miss Anne Lister and the Curious Tale of Miss Eliza Raine (2010) and Anne Lister's Secret Diary for 1817 (2019), both of which make extensive use of other materials in the Lister archives including letters, diaries, and ancillary

to production-related issues, and Marvel Studios pushed back Deadpool & Wolverine to November 8, 2024, as a result [45] In December, Echo head writer Marion Dayre said the series would be delayed to late 2023, around that December [46] In early February 2023, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced that the company would be re-evaluating the volume of content it output as a way to cut costs over the next few years [47] [48] Shortly after, when reflecting on the amount of Disney+ content released for Phase Four in a short time frame, Feige anticipated that Marvel Studios would look to space out the releases of the Phase Five and Six Disney+ series or put fewer out each year \"so they can each get a chance to shine\" [49] [48] At that time, the second season of Loki and Secret Invasion were still expected to release in 2023, while other projects in post-production, such as Echo and Ironheart, were unlikely to release that year as previously announced [48] The Marvels was also delayed to November 10, 2023 [50] A month later, Iger said there was \"nothing in any way inherently off in terms of the Marvel brand\", and was not concerned with the volume of Marvel content being released Rather, he believed there would be more of a benefit to shifting to new characters and stories, instead of producing third or fourth sequels with some characters [51]\n\n\nFilms\nScott Lang and Hope

{"title": "Philip_Rivers", "content": "\nEarly life\nRivers was born in Decatur, Alabama, where his father, Steve, was the head coach of Decatur High's football team and his mother, Joan, was a teacher [3] As part of a fifth-grade project, he had to make a poster about his dreams and aspirations On the poster, he pasted his face over that of a Minnesota Vikings player who had appeared on a cover of Sports Illustrated [4] Rivers' first start in an official game came in the seventh grade, in 1994 He has worn the number 17 jersey since the ninth grade, in honor of his father, who wore the same number in high school After his dad got the head coaching job, Rivers played high school football at Athens High School in nearby Athens [5] [6]\n\n\nCollege career\nAfter high school, Rivers attended North Carolina State University in Raleigh, North Carolina, where he played for coach Chuck Amato's Wolfpack football team [9] Rivers enrolled in January and suited up for his first practice as a college quarterback in the spring of 2000 [10]\n\n\n2000 season\nAs a freshman in 2000, Rivers led NC State to an 8–4 record, including a win against Minnesota in the MicronPC Bowl [11] Four of the Wolfpack's victories were comebacks In his debut, a 38–31 double-overtime win over Arkansas State, he passed for 397 yards and three touchdowns He directed a 74-yard game-tying drive as time expired [12] A week later, he threw for 401 yards in a 41–38 win against Indiana The performance was highlighted by a timely 47-yard pass to future first round pick Koren Robinson with under a minute to go [13] Against Duke, NC State trailed 31–28 late in the fourth quarter when Rivers scored a rushing touchdown on a seven-yard run Rivers threw for a season-high 413 yards to go along with three touchdowns and one interception [14] For the season, Rivers passed for 3,054 yards and 25 touchdowns He broke a half-dozen school passing marks, was ACC Rookie of the Week a record eight times, and earned honors as the conference Freshman of the Year [15] For the first time since Roman Gabriel ran the Wolfpack offense in the early 1960s, NC State had an All-American caliber quarterback.\n\n\n2001 season\nAs a sophomore in 2001, Rivers connected for 2,586 yards and 16 touchdowns [16] His 65.2 percent completion mark led the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) [17] The Wolfpack finished the 2001 campaign at 7–4 and made a return trip to the Tangerine Bowl The quarterback had a good game against Pitt in a 34–19 loss, passing for 189 yards and a touchdown [18]\n\n\n2002 season\nIn 2002, Rivers led the Wolfpack to victories in their first nine games, which led to a number #10 ranking in the AP Poll [19] It was the best start in the school's history The season took a disappointing turn however when they lost three consecutive ACC contests, but NC State defeated Florida State by a score of 17–7 in their season finale, and received an invitation to play against Notre Dame in the Gator Bowl Once again, Rivers delivered an MVP performance in the most important game of the year, pacing the Wolfpack to a dominating 28–6 win over Notre Dame In the victory, Rivers was 23-of-37 for 228 passing yards and two passing touchdowns [20] The game would set up a remarkable year for Rivers in 2003 [21]\n\n\n2003 season\nAs a senior in 2003, Rivers threw for 4,491 yards and 34 touchdowns in 12 games, capping his career as the most productive and durable quarterback in ACC history [22]\n\n\nLegacy\nDuring his collegiate career, Rivers shattered almost every NC State and ACC passing record [31] [32] He started 51 straight games and completed a conference record 1,147 passes in 1,710 tries, with 95 touchdowns His career culminated with an NCAA record 51st consecutive college start [33] The Wolfpack went to four consecutive bowl games under the leadership of Rivers, winning three of them Rivers finished his career at NC State with 13,484 passing yards, 13th all-time among Division I quarterbacks (he finished in second place at the end of his collegiate career) [34] He also threw 95 touchdown passes, which tied him for eighth all-time with Kliff Kingsbury and Brady Quinn Rivers' number was retired before his final home game at North Carolina State [35]\n\n\nCollege statistics\nRivers was projected to be an early first-round pick in the 2004 NFL draft However, despite Rivers' record of success in college and high accuracy (72 completion percentage for his senior season), questions about his lack of arm strength and his unorthodox side-arm throwing motion were concerns for some NFL general managers The pre-draft consensus was that Rivers could be selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers with the 11th pick The San Diego Chargers coveted Eli Manning and wanted to select him with their first round pick, which was also the first overall pick of the draft However, after Manning indicated before the draft that he would not sign with them, Rivers was their first alternative because the Chargers' head coach at the time, Marty Schottenheimer, had coached him at the Senior Bowl and he liked what he saw The Chargers agreed to a draft day deal with the New York Giants San Diego selected Manning first, then traded him to New York for Rivers, selected fourth by the Giants, plus draft picks later used by the Chargers on future Pro Bowlers Shawne Merriman and Nate Kaeding.\n\n\nProfessional career\nRivers was projected to be an early first-round pick in the 2004 NFL draft However, despite Rivers' record of success in college

Chargers\nIn August 2004, Rivers signed a six-year, $40.5 million contract with the San Diego Chargers that included $14.5 million in signing bonuses [40] However, due to a protracted contract negotiation with the San Diego Chargers, Rivers only reported to the team during the last week of training camp, and incumbent Drew Brees retained his starting job Rivers began the season as the Chargers' third quarterback option, behind Doug Flutie, [41] and ahead of the fourth quarterback  on the depth chart, Cleo Lemon Unfortunately for Rivers, Brees went on to have a then-career year and was named to the NFL Pro Bowl while winning the NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award [42] Rivers received very limited playing time, playing in only two games He only threw passes in the second half of the last game of the 2004 season, a victory over the Kansas City Chiefs, by which time the Chargers had already clinched a home playoff spot and the AFC West division title In the victory, he threw his first touchdown pass to fellow rookie Malcom Floyd [43] He was not on the active roster for San Diego's Wild Card Round playoff loss to the New York Jets [44]\n\n\n2004 season\nIn August 2004, Rivers signed a six-year, $40.5 million contract with the San Diego Chargers that included $14.5 million in signing bonuses [40] However, due to a protracted contract negotiation with the San Diego

rookie Malcom Floyd [43] He was not on the active roster for San Diego's Wild Card Round playoff loss to the New York Jets [44]\n\n\n2005 season\nRivers was promoted to second on the Chargers quarterback depth chart after Flutie was released [41] Rivers was unable to beat out Brees for the starting quarterback job in the Chargers' 2005 training camp and preseason In the Chargers' final game of the 2005 season, at home in Qualcomm Stadium, Rivers entered the game after Brees dislocated his right shoulder late in the second quarter due to a hit from Denver Broncos safety John Lynch [45] Rivers completed 12 of 22 passing attempts for 115 yards with one interception and two fumbles [46] The Chargers lost to Denver, 23–7 However, Rivers led the Chargers on their only scoring drive that game, which culminated in a four-yard touchdown run by running back LaDainian Tomlinson [47]\n\n\n2006 season\n After the 2005 season, Brees was not re-signed (partly due to the injury suffered in the Denver game) by the Chargers Instead he signed a large contract that included sizeable guaranteed money with the New Orleans Saints, during the 2006 free agency period Many [who?] doubted the Chargers' decision to change quarterbacks as they were a Super Bowl contender, believing that Rivers' inexperience would hinder them Rivers was named the Chargers' starter going into training camp Expectations were high for Rivers due to the large amount of talent on the Chargers' offense and the performance of his peers from the 2004 draft (Eli Manning and Ben Roethlisberger) as starters.\n\n\n2007 season\nNorv Turner took over as head coach of the Chargers in 2007 [61] After a 1–3 start, the Chargers turned their season around, finishing 11–5 and winning the AFC West for the second straight year [62] [63] Rivers finished the season with 3,152 passing yards, 21 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions [64]\n\n\n2008 season\nIn 2008, Rivers led the NFL in multiple categories including touchdown passes (34), passer rating (105.5), yards per pass attempt (8.4), and adjusted yards per attempt (8.8) [70] [71] In Week 2, against the Denver Broncos, he had a season-high 377 passing yards, three touchdowns, and one interception in the 39–38 loss [72] On December 28, 2008, Rivers set the Chargers team record for touchdown passes in a season with 34, a record previously held by Dan Fouts, who had 33 in 1981 [73] After a 4–8 start, Rivers threw 11 touchdown passes and one interception to win the final four games of the season, winning the AFC West division on a season-finale 52–21 tie-breaking win over the Denver Broncos [74] On January 3, 2009, in the Wild Card Round, the San Diego Chargers defeated the Indianapolis Colts to advance to the AFC Divisional Playoff [75] Rivers led the Chargers down the field down three points with under two minutes left He set up Nate Kaeding for a game-tying field goal that would lead to overtime, where the Chargers would go on to win 23–17, thanks to a Darren Sproles touchdown In the Divisional Round 35–24 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers, Rivers played well, throwing for over 300 yards and three touchdowns, but was sacked four times and threw an interception They possessed the ball for only 17 seconds during the third quarter and had only 15 yards rushing [76]\n\n\n2009 season\nOn August 24, 2009, Rivers signed a six-year, $92 million contract extension with the Chargers, with approximately $38 million guaranteed [77] Rivers was voted into his second career Pro Bowl on December 29 [78] He ended the season with a passer rating of 104.4, the third highest in the NFL, after passing for 4,254 yards, 28 touchdowns, and only nine interceptions [79] For the second consecutive year, he led the NFL in yards per attempt (8.8) and adjusted yards per attempt (9.1) [70] [71] He led the Chargers to the second seed in the AFC with a 13–3 record, tied for second best in the NFL [80] In the Divisional Round, Rivers was 27–40 for 298 yards while rushing and throwing for a touchdown and was intercepted twice in the 17–14 loss to the New York Jets [81]\n\n\n2010 season\nRivers led the league in passing yards, throwing for a career-high 4,710 yards [82] The Chargers started off the year slowly again at 3–5 and finished a disappointing 9–7 and their four-year reign as AFC West champions ended while they missed the playoffs [83] [84] In Week 3, against the Seattle Seahawks, Rivers threw for 455 yards and two passing touchdowns in a losing effort 20–27 [85] These 455 yards broke the franchise single-game record for most passing yardage, previously held by Dan Fouts, who had 444 in 1982 [86] Rivers recorded 431 and threw two passing touchdowns, but lost to the Oakland Raiders in Week 5 [87] In Week 8, Rivers threw for 305 yards, with two passing touchdowns and one interception in a 33–25 win against the Tennessee Titans, extending his active player-leading streak to 21 games with a touchdown thrown and giving him the record for most passing yards (2,649) ever after 8 games, passing Fouts' previous record (2,580) [88] [89] Rivers threw for four passing touchdowns, two to backup tight end Randy McMichael and the other two to rookie receiver Seyi Ajirotutu in a comeback 29–23 victory over the Houston Texans [90] The Chargers' top receivers Gates (torn plantar fascia), Vincent Jackson (suspended), Malcom Floyd (hamstring), and Legedu Naanee (hamstring) did not play in the game [70] [91] Rivers lost his first ever game in December, a 13–28 loss at home against the Raiders [92] Rivers was invited to the 2011 Pro Bowl, his fourth invite overall, and started in place of an injured Tom Brady [93] [94] It was the first time he played in a Pro Bowl, twice missing previous games due to injury and once for the birth of his child in the 2010 Pro Bowl [94] Rivers was named the quarterback in the 2010 NFL Alumni Player of the Year Awards over Brady, who was

Canepa of the San Diego Union-Tribune called Rivers a \"better quarterback\" than Fouts, a first-ballot Hall of Fame quarterback Canepa cited Rivers \" [completing] passes to an astounding 17 different receivers\" in 2010, amid the injuries to Chargers receivers, and his then 55–25 record as a starter compared to 86–84–1 for Fouts He also noted, \"Fouts made more mistakes than Rivers.\"  Rivers had completed 63.7 percent of his 2,455 passes with 58 interceptions and a 97.2 passer rating, while Fouts was successful on 58.8 percent of his 5,604 attempts with 242 interceptions and an 80.2 rating Rivers had never thrown more than two interceptions in a game, including seven playoff games [97] His passer rating was the highest in league history, and he had the second-best

the season with 3,606 passing yards, 26 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions [125] The Chargers' 7–9 record was the first losing season in Rivers's career, [41] and the team's first since 2003 [123] They missed the playoffs for the third straight season, leading to the firing of Turner and general manager A J Smith [123]\n\n\n2013 season\nRivers's combined 35 interceptions the two previous seasons led many to wonder whether he was injured or if his career was on the decline [126] [127] Only two offensive coaches returned in 2013 in an overhauled coaching staff led by new head coach Mike McCoy, and a revamped offensive system had Rivers release the ball earlier and taking what opposing defenses conceded [128] In their Week 2 win over the Philadelphia Eagles, he threw for 419 yards and three touchdowns [129] In their Week 4 win over the Dallas Cowboys, Rivers set an NFL record for completion percentage (83%) for a quarterback who also threw for over 400 yards (401), three touchdowns, and

over 120 for five consecutive games [137] Later in the season, Rivers suffered from sore ribs and a back injury, but he denied that they affected his performance His 71.2 rating in December was his lowest in a single month since November 2007 (68.8) [138] He finished the 2014 season with 4,286 passing yards, 31 touchdowns, and 18\tinterceptions [139] He was ranked 43rd by his fellow players on

After the game, Rivers and several other Chargers players returned to the field to sign autographs for the fans, as they were unsure if it would be the team's final time playing in San Diego Rivers would gift the shoes he wore to two fans in the stadium to show his appreciation [148] The team would ultimately stay in the city the following season [149]\n\n\n2016 season\nRivers and the Chargers started the 2016 season with a 1–4 record In that stretch, Rivers passed for four touchdowns in two separate games [154] [155] [156] On October 13, 2016, in Week 6, Rivers passed Fouts to become the Chargers' all-time passing yards leader [157] In Week 7, against the Atlanta Falcons, he had a season-high 371 passing yards, one touchdown, and one interception in the 33–30 victory [158] Following

projected to be an early first-round pick in the 2004 NFL draft However, despite Rivers' record of success in college and high accuracy (72 completion percentage for his senior season), questions about his lack of arm strength and his unorthodox side-arm throwing motion were concerns for some NFL general managers The pre-draft consensus was that Rivers could be selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers with the 11th pick The San Diego Chargers coveted Eli Manning and wanted to select him with their first round pick, which was also the first overall pick of the draft However, after Manning indicated before the draft that he would not sign with them, Rivers was their first alternative because the Chargers' head coach at the time, Marty Schottenheimer, had coached him at the Senior Bowl and he liked what he saw The Chargers agreed to a draft day deal with the New York Giants San Diego selected Manning first, then traded him to New York for Rivers, selected fourth by the Giants, plus draft picks later used by the Chargers on future Pro Bowlers Shawne Merriman and Nate Kaeding.\n\n\nProfessional career\nRivers was projected to be an early first-round pick in the 2004 NFL draft However, despite Rivers' record of success in college and high accuracy (72 completion percentage for his senior season), questions about his lack of arm strength and his unorthodox side-arm throwing motion were concerns for some NFL general managers The pre-draft consensus was that Rivers could be selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers with the 11th pick The San Diego Chargers coveted Eli Manning and wanted to select him with their first round pick, which was also the first overall pick of the draft However, after Manning indicated before the draft that he would not sign with them, Rivers was their first alternative because the Chargers' head coach at the time, Marty Schottenheimer, had coached him at the Senior Bowl and he liked what he saw The Chargers agreed to a draft day deal with the New York Giants San Diego selected Manning first, then traded him to New York for Rivers, selected fourth by the Giants, plus draft picks later used by the Chargers on future Pro Bowlers Shawne

season, Brees was not re-signed (partly due to the injury suffered in the Denver game) by the Chargers Instead he signed a large contract that included sizeable guaranteed money with the New Orleans Saints, during the 2006 free agency period Many [who?] doubted the Chargers' decision to change quarterbacks as they were a Super Bowl contender, believing that Rivers' inexperience would hinder them Rivers was named the Chargers' starter going into training camp Expectations were high for Rivers due to the large amount of talent on the Chargers' offense and the performance of his peers from the 2004 draft (Eli Manning and Ben Roethlisberger) as starters.\n\n\n2007 season\nNorv Turner took over as head coach of the Chargers in 2007 [61] After a 1–3 start, the Chargers turned their season

[96]\n\n\n2011 season\nEntering the 2011 season, Nick Canepa of the San Diego Union-Tribune called Rivers a \"better quarterback\" than Fouts, a first-ballot Hall of Fame quarterback Canepa cited Rivers \" [completing] passes to an astounding 17 different receivers\" in 2010, amid the injuries to Chargers receivers, and his then 55–25 record as a starter compared to 86–84–1 for Fouts He also noted, \"Fouts made more mistakes than Rivers.\"  Rivers had completed 63.7 percent of his 2,455 passes with 58 interceptions and a 97.2 passer rating, while Fouts was successful on 58.8 percent of

season\nRivers's combined 35 interceptions the two previous seasons led many to wonder whether he was injured or if his career was on the decline [126] [127] Only two offensive coaches returned in 2013 in an overhauled coaching staff led by new head coach Mike McCoy, and a revamped offensive system had Rivers release the ball earlier and taking what opposing defenses conceded [128] In their

in Yemen refer to a series of military operations conducted by the United States and the United Kingdom against Houthi targets in Yemen. The strikes began in January 2024 and continued throughout the year, resulting in significant damage to Houthi military infrastructure and equipment.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Houthi movement, also known as Ansar Allah, has been a major player in the Yemeni conflict since 2015. The movement has been involved in a series of conflicts with the internationally recognized government of Yemen, as well as with other regional and international actors. In 2021, the Biden administration removed the Houthi movement from the Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) blacklist, citing concerns that the designation would impede the delivery of humanitarian aid to Yemen.\n\n**Timeline**\n\nThe first wave of strikes began on January 12, 2024, at approximately 2:30 a.m. Yemen time (UTC+3). American fighter jets, armed with precision-guided bombs, were dispatched from regional bases. Simultaneously, 22 fixed-wing aircraft, including F/A-18s, took off from the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower. In addition, the cruiser USS Philippine Sea, the destroyers USS Gravely and USS Mason, along with the cruise-missile submarine USS Florida, launched a total of 80 Tomahawk cruise missiles.

The strikes were part of a larger effort to disrupt Houthi military operations and prevent the movement from launching attacks on civilian targets.\n\n**March**\n\nThe United States conducted a strike targeting a Houthi surface-to-air missile that was deemed as a threat to the US aircraft in the region. The strike was part of a broader effort to neutralize Houthi military capabilities and prevent the movement from launching attacks on civilian targets.\n\n**April**\n\nOn April 4, 2024, the United States conducted a strike on one anti-ship missile in a Houthi-controlled territory of Yemen. The strike was part of a larger effort to disrupt Houthi military operations and prevent the movement from launching attacks on civilian targets.\n\n**May**\n\nOn May 2, 2024, the United States conducted strikes on three uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.

The strikes were part of a larger effort to disrupt Houthi military operations and prevent the movement from launching attacks on civilian targets.\n\n**Assessments**\n\nThe 2024 missile strikes in Yemen have resulted in significant damage to Houthi military infrastructure and equipment. The strikes have also disrupted Houthi military operations and prevented the movement from launching attacks on civilian targets. However, the conflict in Yemen remains ongoing, and the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe internationally recognized Government of Yemen issued a statement to Saba News Agency strongly condemning military actions by the Houthis, blaming them for \"dragging the country into a military confrontation arena for propaganda purposes\" and \"misleadingly linking it to support for Palestinians.\" The Government of Yemen also called on the international community to take action to prevent the escalation of the conflict.\n\nThe Houthi movement responded to the strikes by vowing to retaliate against the United States and the United Kingdom. Houthi deputy foreign minister Hussein al-Izzi called the attacks \"blatant aggression\" and said the US and UK would \"pay a heavy price.\" Mohammed Abdulsalam, a spokesman for the group, announced that the Houthis would continue to target Israeli ships or any ships heading to \"the ports of occupied Palestine,\" saying that the US and UK were wrong to think that the strikes \"would deter Yemen from supporting Palestine and Gaza.\"\n\n**Participants**\n\nThe 2024 missile strikes in Yemen involved the United States and the United Kingdom, with the aim of disrupting Houthi military operations and preventing the movement from launching attacks on civilian targets.

Idol and X Factor franchises, Cowell, his company Syco, and its business partners developed a talent show format open to performers of any kind, not only singers, but also dancers, instrumentalists, magicians, comedians, novelty acts, and so on The origins of the Got Talent format can be traced to the British talent shows Opportunity Knocks (on screen from 1956, with the winner using the now-standard method of a telephone vote) and New Faces [80] Immensely popular with weekly audiences of 20 million, Opportunity Knocks showcased singers, dancers and comedians in addition to non

{"title": "Battle_of_Stalingrad", "content": "\nBackground\nBy the spring of 1942, despite the failure of Operation Barbarossa to defeat the Soviet Union in a single campaign, the Wehrmacht had captured vast territories, including Ukraine, Belarus, and the Baltic republics On the Western Front, Germany held most of Europe, the U-boat offensive was curbing American support, and in North Africa, Erwin Rommel had just captured Tobruk [47]: 522  In the east, the Germans had stabilized a front running from Leningrad to Rostov, with several minor salients Hitler remained confident of breaking the Red Army, despite heavy losses west of Moscow in the winter of 1941–42, because large parts of Army Group Centre had been rested and re-equipped [48] Hitler decided that the 1942 summer campaign would target the southern Soviet Union The initial objectives around Stalingrad were to destroy the city's industrial capacity and block the Volga River traffic, crucial for connecting the Caucasus and Caspian Sea to central Russia The capture of Stalingrad would also disrupt Lend-Lease supplies via the Persian Corridor [49] [50]\n\n\nPrelude\nIf I do not get the oil of Maikop and Grozny then I must finish  [liquidieren; \"kill off\", \"liquidate\"] this war.\n\nOrders of battle\nDuring the defence of Stalingrad, the Red Army deployed five armies in and around the city (28th, 51st, 57th, 62nd and 64th Armies); and an additional nine armies in the encirclement counteroffensive [71] (24th, 65th, 66th Armies and 16th Air Army from the north as part of the Don Front offensive, and 1st Guards Army, 5th Tank, 21st Army, 2nd Air Army and 17th Air Army from the south as part of the Southwestern Front).\n\n\nRed Army\nDuring the defence of Stalingrad, the Red Army deployed five

north as part of the Don Front offensive, and 1st Guards Army, 5th Tank, 21st Army, 2nd Air Army and 17th Air Army from the south as part of the Southwestern Front).\n\n\nAxis\nGerman forces first clashed with the Stalingrad Front on 17 July on the distant approaches to Stalingrad, in the bend of the Don [72] [73] A significant clash in the early stages of the battle was fought at Kalach, in which \"We had had to pay a high cost in men and material .. left on the Kalach battlefield were numerous burnt-out or shot-up German tanks.\" [74] Military historian David Glantz indicated that four hard-fought battles – collectively known as the Kotluban Operations – north of Stalingrad, where the Soviets made their greatest stand, decided Germany's fate before the Nazis ever set foot in the city itself, and were a turning point in the war [75] Beginning in late August and lasting into October, the Soviets committed between two and four armies in hastily coordinated and poorly controlled attacks against the Germans' northern flank The actions resulted in over 200,000 Soviet Army casualties but did slow the German assault [75]\n\n\nAttack on Stalingrad\nGerman forces first clashed with

described the insanity of the battle and brutal nature of the urban combat: [36]\n\nFighting in the industrial district\nAfter 27 September, much of the fighting in the city shifted north to the industrial district Having slowly advanced over 10 days against strong Soviet resistance, the 51st Army Corps was finally in front of the three giant factories of Stalingrad: the Red October Steel Factory, the Barrikady Arms Factory and Stalingrad Tractor Factory It took a few more days for them to prepare for the most savage offensive of all, which was unleashed on 14 October, [125] which Chuikov considered to be the worst day of the battle [126] Exceptionally intense shelling and bombing paved the way for the first German assault groups The main attack (led by the 14th Panzer and 305th Infantry Divisions) attacked towards the tractor factory, while another assault led by the 24th Panzer Division hit to the south of the giant plant [127]\n\n\nAir attacks\nFrom 5 to 12 September, Luftflotte 4 conducted 7,507 sorties (938 per day) From 16 to 25 September, it carried out 9,746 missions (975 per day) [139] Determined to crush Soviet resistance, Luftflotte 4's Stukawaffe flew 900 individual sorties against Soviet positions at the Stalingrad Tractor Factory on 5 October Several Soviet regiments were wiped out; the entire staff of the Soviet 339th Infantry Regiment was killed the following morning during an air raid [140]\n\n\nGermans reach the Volga\nIn August 1942 after three months of slow advance, the Germans finally reached the river banks, capturing 90% of the ruined city and splitting the remaining Soviet forces into two narrow pockets Ice floes on the Volga now prevented boats and tugs from supplying the Soviet defenders Nevertheless, the fighting continued, especially on the slopes of Mamayev Kurgan and inside the factory area in the northern part of the city [147] From 21 August to 20 November, the German 6th Army lost 60,548 men, including 12,782 killed, 45,545 wounded and 2,221 missing [148] Fighting for the Volga banks has been noted as the \"most concentrated and ferocious fighting in perhaps the whole war\" [149]\n\n\nSoviet counter-offensives\nRecognising that German troops were ill-prepared for offensive operations during the winter of 1942 and that most of them were deployed elsewhere on the southern sector of the Eastern Front, the Stavka decided to conduct a number of offensive operations between 19 November 1942 and 2 February 1943 These operations opened the Winter Campaign of 1942–1943 (19 November 1942 – 3 March 1943), which involved some fifteen Armies operating on several fronts As per Zhukov, \"German operational blunders were aggravated by poor intelligence: they failed to spot preparations for the major counter-offensive near Stalingrad where there were 10 field, 1 tank and 4 air armies.\" [150]\n\n\nWeakness on the Axis flanks\nDuring the siege, the German and allied Italian, Hungarian, and Romanian armies protecting Army Group B's north and south flanks had pressed their headquarters for support The Hungarian 2nd Army was given the task of defending a 200 km (120 mi) section of the front north of Stalingrad between the Italian Army and Voronezh This resulted in a very thin line, with some sectors where 1–2 km (0.62–1.24 mi) stretches were being defended by a single platoon (platoons typically have around 20 to 50 men) These forces were also lacking in effective anti-tank weapons Zhukov states, \"Compared with the Germans, the troops of the satellites were not so well armed, less experienced and less efficient, even in defence.\" [151]\n\n\nOperation Uranus\nIn autumn, Zhukov and Vasilevsky, responsible for strategic planning in the Stalingrad area, concentrated forces in the steppes to the north and south of the city The northern flank was defended by Romanian units, often in open positions on the steppes The natural line of defence, the Don River, had never been properly established by the German side The armies in the area were also poorly equipped in terms of anti-tank weapons The plan was to punch through the overstretched and weakly defended flanks and surround the German forces in the Stalingrad region.\n\n\nSixth Army surrounded\nBy the time of the encirclement, approximately 330,000 Axis personnel, including Germans, Romanians, Italians, and Croatians, were trapped [157] [158] Among them were between 40,000 and 65,000 Hilfswillige (Hiwi), or \"volunteer auxiliaries,\" recruited from Soviet POWs and civilians These Hiwi often served in supporting roles but were also deployed in frontline units due to their growing numbers [159] [160]\n\n\nEnd of the battle\nManstein's plan to rescue the Sixth Army – Operation Winter Storm – was developed in full consultation with Führer headquarters It aimed to break through to the Sixth Army and establish a corridor to keep it supplied and reinforced, so that, according to Hitler's order, it could maintain its \"cornerstone\" position on the Volga, \"with regard to operations in 1943\" Manstein, however, who knew that Sixth Army could not survive the winter there, instructed his headquarters to draw up a further plan in the event of Hitler's seeing sense.\n\n\nOperation Winter Storm\nManstein's plan to rescue the Sixth Army – Operation Winter Storm – was developed in full consultation with Führer headquarters It aimed to break through to the Sixth Army and establish a corridor to keep it supplied and reinforced, so that, according to Hitler's order, it could maintain its \"cornerstone\" position on the Volga, \"with regard to operations in 1943\" Manstein, however, who knew that Sixth Army could not survive the winter there, instructed his headquarters to draw up a further plan in the event of Hitler's seeing sense.\n\n\nOperation Little Saturn\nOn 16 December, the Soviets launched Operation Little Saturn, which attempted to punch through the Axis army (mainly Italians) on the Don The Germans set up a \"mobile defence\" of small units that were to hold towns until supporting armour arrived From the Soviet bridgehead at Mamon, 15 divisions – supported by at least 100 tanks – attacked the Italian Cosseria and Ravenna Divisions, and although outnumbered 9 to 1, the Italians initially fought well, with the Germans praising the quality of the Italian defenders, [168] but on 19 December, with the Italian lines disintegrating, ARMIR headquarters ordered the battered divisions to withdraw to new lines [169]\n\n\nSoviet victory\nThe Red Army High Command sent three envoys while, simultaneously, aircraft and loudspeakers announced the terms of capitulation on 7 January 1943 The letter was signed by Colonel-General of Artillery Voronov and the commander-in-chief of the Don Front, Lieutenant-General Rokossovsky A low-level Soviet envoy party (comprising Major Aleksandr Smyslov, Captain Nikolay Dyatlenko and a trumpeter) carried generous surrender terms to Paulus: if he surrendered within 24 hours, he would receive a guarantee of safety for all prisoners, medical care for the sick and wounded, prisoners being allowed to keep their personal belongings, \"normal\" food rations, and repatriation to any country they wished after the war Rokossovsky's letter also stressed that Paulus' men were in an untenable situation Paulus requested permission to surrender, but Hitler rejected Paulus' request out of hand Accordingly, Paulus did not respond [173] [174] The German High Command informed Paulus, \"Every day that the army holds out longer helps the whole front and draws away the Russian divisions from it.\" [175]\n\n\nTactics and battle conditions\nGerman military doctrine was based on the principle of combined-arms teams and close cooperation between tanks, infantry, engineers, artillery and ground-attack aircraft To negate the German usage of tanks and artillery in the ruins of the city, Soviet commander Chuikov introduced a tactic he described as \"hugging\" the enemy: keeping Soviet front-line positions as close as possible to those of the Germans, so German artillery and aircraft could not attack without risking friendly fire [197] [198] After mid-September, to reduce casualties, he ceased launching organized daylight counterattacks, instead emphasizing small unit tactics in which infantry moved through the city's sewers to strike into the rear of attacking German units [199] The Soviets preferred night attacks, which disrupted German morale by depriving them of sleep Soviet reconnaissance patrols were used to find German positions and take prisoners for interrogation, enabling them to anticipate attacks When Soviet troops detected a coming attack, they launched their own counterattacks at dawn before German air support could arrive Soviet troops blunted the German attacks themselves through ambushes that separated tanks from their supporting infantry, as well as the employment of booby traps and mines These tactical innovations became widespread [200]\n\n\nMedical and food conditions\nThe conditions of both armies were atrocious Disease ran rampant, with many deaths due to dysentery, typhus, diphtheria, tuberculosis and jaundice, causing medical staff to fear a possible epidemic [254] Rats and mice were plentiful, serving as one reason Germans could not counterattack in time, due to mice having chewed their tank wiring [254] Lice were heavily prevalent, and plagues of flies would gather around kitchens, adding to the possibility of wound infections Brutal winter conditions affected soldiers tremendously, [32] with temperatures at times reaching as low as −40 °C in the second half of November, [255] and −30 °C in late January [254] The weather conditions were considered to be extreme and the worst possible [256] [32] The weather conditions caused rapid frostbite, with many cases of gangrene and amputation The conditions saw soldiers dying en masse due to frostbite and hypothermia [254] Both armies suffered food shortages, with mass starvation on both sides Stress, tiredness and the cold upset the metabolism of soldiers, receiving a reduced amount of calories from food [254] German forces eventually ran out of medical supplies such as ether, antiseptics and bandages Surgery had to be done without anaesthesia [254]\n\n\nCasualties\nThe Axis suffered 800,000–1,500,000 casualties (killed, wounded or captured) among all branches of the German armed forces and their allies:\n\n\nLuftwaffe losses\nThe losses of transport planes were especially serious, as they destroyed the capacity for supply of the trapped 6th Army The destruction of 72 aircraft when the airfield at Tatsinskaya Airfield was overrun meant the loss of about 10 percent of the Luftwaffe transport fleet [288]\n\n\nAftermath\nThe German public was not officially told of the impending disaster until the end of January 1943, though positive media reports had stopped in the weeks before the announcement [289] Stalingrad marked the first time that the Nazi government publicly acknowledged a failure in its war effort On 31 January, regular programmes on German state radio were replaced by a broadcast of the sombre Adagio movement from Anton Bruckner's Seventh Symphony, followed by the announcement of the defeat at Stalingrad [289] On 18 February, Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels gave the famous Sportpalast speech in Berlin, encouraging the Germans to accept a total war that would claim all resources and efforts from the entire population.\n\n\nSignificance\nStalingrad has been described as the greatest single defeat in the history of the German Army [310] Historian Geoffrey Roberts described it as \"the biggest and most traumatic defeat in German military history\" and that \"the myth of the invincible Wehrmacht was gone forever\" [311] The German military historian Walter Görlitz stated that \"It was a second Jena, and was certainly the greatest defeat in history that a German Army had ever undergone\" [312] The battle is commonly identified as the turning point on the Eastern Front, in the war against Germany overall, and in the entire Second World War [313] [314] [315] The battle is analyzed as being a \"point of no return\" on the Eastern Front and as the \"final military consequence\" of Germany's decreasing chances to win the war against the Soviet Union [316] The Soviet general Viktor Matsulenko deemed the battle to be the \"beginning of a basic turning point not just in the course of the Great Patriotic War, but for the entire World War II\" and that the battle was the \"most important military-political event of World War II\" [317] The battle is also seen as the turning point in the air war, as German forces lost countless aircraft and experienced crewmen [318] Stalingrad gave the people of the Soviet Union hope, with military historian David Glantz asserting that \"Russians, as well as many of the former Soviet Union’s other ethnic minorities, saw the Red Army’s victory at Stalingrad as a catharsis which saved Stalin’s city and salvaged a nation’s shattered pride\" [296] In 1989, a comprehensive quantitative analysis concluded that Stalingrad was the military turning point of the war, the turning point for the Soviet leadership, as Stalin recognized the practicality of using his experienced commanders and gave his generals more freedom in fighting the war, and that the Soviet Union had indeed seized the initiative as a result of the battle, based on some of the critical factors examined in the study [319] An analysis in 2004 also concluded that the epic battle sealed the fate of the Germans in the East, a blow in which they would never recover from, and as a result the strategic initiative shifted to the Soviet side, therefore establishing the Battle of Stalingrad as the fundamental turning point in the war on the Eastern Front [320] A year of Axis gains from Case Blue had been wiped out The Sixth Army of Germany had ceased to exist, and the forces of Germany's European allies, except Finland, had been shattered [321] In a speech on 9 November 1944, Hitler himself blamed Stalingrad for Germany's impending doom [322] Furthermore, according to some historians, such as Mikhail Myagkov, a Russian historian, the battle ended up completely dissuading Turkey and Japan from declaring war on the Soviet Union [323] The battle also stifled plans for future joint strategy in the Indian Ocean area between the Japanese and the Germans once their forces met up, and made certain that the German ambitions to use Soviet resources to fight against the Western Allies were no longer feasible [324] Its importance was further noted by historian John Erickson, who stated that \"If the battle of Poltava in 1709 turned Russia into a European power, then Stalingrad set the Soviet Union on the road to being a world power\" [325]\n\n\nCommemoration\nIn recognition of the determination of its defenders, Stalingrad was awarded the title Hero City in 1945 A colossal monument called The Motherland Calls was erected in 1967 on Mamayev Kurgan, the hill overlooking the city where bones and rusty metal splinters can still be found [342] The statue forms part of a war memorial complex which includes the ruins of the Grain Silo and Pavlov's House On 2 February 2013 Volgograd hosted a military parade and other events to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the final victory [343] [344] Since then, military parades have always commemorated the victory in the city.\n\n\nIn popular culture\nThe events of the Battle for Stalingrad have been covered in numerous media works of British, American, German, and Russian origin, [346] for its significance as a turning point in the Second World War and for the loss of life associated with the battle Stalingrad has become synonymous with large-scale urban battles with immense casualties on both sides, [36] [31] [347] [32] [34] and according to historian David Glantz, has become a \"metaphor for the ferocity of the Soviet-German conflict and, indeed, for the devastating nature of twentieth-century warfare as a whole\" [348] Also, historian Geoffrey Roberts states that \"No battle of any war has had more written about it than Stalingrad\" [349] and that \"No battle of the Second World War has captured the public imagination as much as the clash between Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany at Stalingrad in 1942. .. Stalingrad was an epic battle unmatched by any other in its dimensions, drama and decisiveness.\" [350] In addition, besides the battle being recognized as the bloodiest and fiercest of the war, it is also considered to have been the closest of the war as well, [351] as Geoffrey Roberts quotes the Duke of Wellington's remark about the Battle of Waterloo as a \"close-run thing\" to describe the Battle of Stalingrad, [352] further adding to its popularity status and notoriety.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Battle of Stalingrad**\n\nThe Battle of Stalingrad was a major military engagement between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union during World War II. It was a turning point in the war on the Eastern Front and one of the bloodiest battles in history.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nBy the spring of 1942, despite the failure of Operation Barbarossa to defeat the Soviet Union in a single campaign, the Wehrmacht had captured vast territories, including Ukraine, Belarus, and the Baltic republics. On the Western Front, Germany held most of Europe, the U-boat offensive was curbing American support, and in North Africa, Erwin Rommel had just captured Tobruk. In the east, the Germans had stabilized a front running from Leningrad to Rostov, with several minor salients. Hitler remained confident of breaking the Red Army, despite heavy losses west of Moscow in the winter of 1941–42, because large parts of Army Group Centre had been rested and re-equipped.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe initial objectives around Stalingrad were to destroy the city's industrial capacity and block the Volga River traffic, crucial for connecting the Caucasus and Caspian Sea to central Russia. The capture of Stalingrad would also disrupt Lend-Lease supplies via the Persian Corridor.\n\n**Prelude**\n\nIn the autumn of 1942, the German Army Group B, led by General Friedrich Paulus, began to concentrate its forces around Stalingrad. The Red Army, led by General Georgy Zhukov, was preparing to defend the city. The Soviet forces were bolstered by the arrival of fresh troops from Siberia and the Far East.\n\n**Orders of Battle**\n\nDuring the defence of Stalingrad, the Red Army deployed five armies in and around the city (28th, 51st, 57th, 62nd and 64th Armies); and an additional nine armies in the encirclement counteroffensive (24th, 65th, 66th Armies and 16th Air Army from the north as part of the Don Front offensive, and 1st Guards Army, 5th Tank, 21st Army, 2nd Air Army and 17th Air Army from the south as part of the Southwestern Front).\n\n**Red Army**\n\nThe Red Army had a significant advantage in terms of manpower and resources. The Soviet forces were well-equipped with modern tanks, artillery, and aircraft. The Red Army also had a strong air force, with over 2,000 aircraft, including bombers, fighters, and ground-attack planes.\n\n**Axis**\n\nThe German forces were led by General Friedrich Paulus, who was confident of capturing the city quickly. The German Army Group B consisted of four army corps, with a total of 250,000 soldiers. The German forces were supported by Italian, Hungarian, and Romanian troops.\n\n**Attack on Stalingrad**\n\nThe German forces began their attack on Stalingrad on 23 August 1942. The initial assault was a success, but the Soviet defenders put up a fierce resistance. The fighting was intense, with both sides suffering heavy losses.\n\n**Initial Attack**\n\nThe initial attack on Stalingrad was a success, but the Soviet defenders put up a fierce resistance. The fighting was intense, with both sides suffering heavy losses. The German forces advanced slowly, with the Soviet defenders using guerrilla tactics to delay their progress.\n\n**September City Battles**\n\nAfter 27 September, much of the fighting in the city shifted north to the industrial district. The 51st Army Corps was finally in front of the three giant factories of Stalingrad: the Red October Steel Factory, the Barrikady Arms Factory and Stalingrad Tractor Factory. It took a few more days for them to prepare for the most savage offensive of all, which was unleashed on 14 October.\n\n**Air Attacks**\n\nFrom 5 to 12 September, Luftflotte 4 conducted 7,507 sorties. From 16 to 25 September, it carried out 9,746 missions. Determined to crush Soviet resistance, Luftflotte 4's Stukawaffe flew 900 individual sorties against Soviet positions at the Stalingrad Tractor Factory on 5 October.\n\n**Germans Reach the Volga**\n\nIn August 1942 after three months of slow advance, the Germans finally reached the river banks, capturing 90% of the ruined city and splitting the remaining Soviet forces into two narrow pockets. Ice floes on the Volga now prevented boats and tugs from supplying the Soviet defenders.\n\n**Soviet Counter-Offensives**\n\nRecognizing that German troops were ill-prepared for offensive operations during the winter of 1942 and that most of them were deployed elsewhere on the southern sector of the Eastern Front, the Stavka decided to conduct a number of offensive operations between 19 November 1942 and 2 February 1943.\n\n**Weakness on the Axis Flanks**\n\nDuring the siege, the German and allied Italian, Hungarian, and Romanian armies protecting Army Group B's north and south flanks had pressed their headquarters for support. The Hungarian 2nd Army was given the task of defending a 200 km (120 mi) section of the front north of Stalingrad between the Italian Army and Voronezh.\n\n**Operation Uranus**\n\nIn autumn, Zhukov and Vasilevsky, responsible for strategic planning in the Stalingrad area, concentrated forces in the steppes to the north and south of the city. The northern flank was defended by Romanian units, often in open positions on the steppes.\n\n**Sixth Army Surrounded**\n\nBy the time of the encirclement, approximately 330,000 Axis personnel, including Germans, Romanians, Italians, and Croatians, were trapped. Among them were between 40,000 and 65,000 Hilfswillige (Hiwi), or \"volunteer auxiliaries,\" recruited from Soviet POWs and civilians.\n\n**End of the Battle**\n\nThe German High Command informed Paulus, \"Every day that the army holds out longer helps the whole front and draws away the Russian divisions from it.\" Manstein's plan to rescue the Sixth Army – Operation Winter Storm – was developed in full consultation with Führer headquarters.\n\n**Operation Winter Storm**\n\nManstein's plan to rescue the Sixth Army – Operation Winter Storm – was developed in full consultation with Führer headquarters. It aimed to break through to the Sixth Army and establish a corridor to keep it supplied and reinforced, so that, according to Hitler's order, it could maintain its \"cornerstone\" position on the Volga, \"with regard to operations in 1943\".\n\n**Operation Little Saturn**\n\nOn 16 December, the Soviets launched Operation Little Saturn, which attempted to punch through the Axis army (mainly Italians) on the Don. The Germans set up a \"mobile defence\" of small units that were to hold towns until supporting armour arrived.\n\n**Soviet Victory**\n\nThe Red Army High Command sent three envoys while, simultaneously, aircraft and loudspeakers announced the terms of capitulation on 7 January 1943. The letter was signed by Colonel-General of Artillery Voronov and the commander-in-chief of the Don Front, Lieutenant-General Rokossovsky.\n\n**Tactics and Battle Conditions**\n\nThe German military doctrine was based on the principle of combined-arms teams and close cooperation between tanks, infantry, engineers, artillery and ground-attack aircraft. To negate the German usage of tanks and artillery in the ruins of the city, Soviet commander Chuikov introduced a tactic he described as \"hugging\" the enemy.\n\n**Medical and Food Conditions**\n\nThe conditions of both armies were atrocious. Disease ran rampant, with many deaths due to dysentery, typhus, diphtheria, tuberculosis and jaundice, causing medical staff to fear a possible epidemic. Rats and mice were plentiful, serving as one reason Germans could not counterattack in time, due to mice having chewed their tank wiring.\n\n**Casualties**\n\nThe Axis suffered 800,000–1,500,000 casualties (killed, wounded or captured) among all branches of the German armed forces and their allies.\n\n**Luftwaffe Losses**\n\nThe losses of transport planes were especially serious, as they destroyed the capacity for supply of the trapped 6th Army. The destruction of 72 aircraft when the airfield at Tatsinskaya Airfield was overrun meant the loss of about 10 percent of the Luftwaffe transport fleet.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe German public was not officially told of the impending disaster until the end of January 1943, though positive media reports had stopped in the weeks before the announcement. Stalingrad marked the first time that the Nazi government publicly acknowledged a failure in its war effort.\n\n**Significance**\n\nStalingrad has been described as the greatest single defeat in the history of the German Army.

insanity of the battle and brutal nature of the urban combat: [36]\n\nFighting in the industrial district\nAfter 27 September, much of the fighting in the city shifted north to the industrial district Having slowly advanced over 10 days against strong Soviet resistance, the 51st Army Corps was finally in front of the three giant factories of Stalingrad: the Red October Steel Factory, the Barrikady Arms Factory and Stalingrad Tractor Factory It took a few more days for them to prepare for the most savage offensive of all, which was unleashed on 14 October, [125] which Chuikov considered to be the worst day of the battle [126] Exceptionally intense shelling and bombing paved the way for the first German assault groups The main attack (led by the 14th Panzer and 305th Infantry Divisions) attacked towards the tractor factory, while another assault led by the 24th Panzer Division hit to the south of the giant plant [127]\n\n\nAir attacks\nFrom 5 to 12 September, Luftflotte 4 conducted 7,507 sorties (938 per day) From 16 to 25 September, it carried out 9,746 missions (975 per day) [139] Determined to crush Soviet resistance, Luftflotte 4's Stukawaffe flew 900 individual sorties against Soviet positions at the Stalingrad Tractor Factory on 5 October Several Soviet regiments were wiped out; the entire staff of the Soviet 339th Infantry Regiment was killed the following morning during an air raid [140]\n\n\nGermans reach the Volga\nIn August 1942 after three months of slow advance, the Germans finally reached the river banks, capturing 90% of the ruined city and splitting the remaining Soviet forces into two narrow pockets Ice floes on the Volga now prevented boats and tugs from supplying the Soviet defenders Nevertheless, the fighting continued, especially on the slopes of Mamayev Kurgan and inside the factory area in the northern part of the city [147] From 21 August to 20 November, the German 6th Army lost 60,548 men, including 12,782 killed, 45,545 wounded and 2,221 missing [148] Fighting for the Volga banks has been noted as the \"most concentrated and ferocious fighting in perhaps the whole war\" [149]\n\n\nSoviet counter-offensives\nRecognising that German troops were ill-prepared for offensive operations during the winter of 1942 and that most of them were deployed elsewhere on the southern sector of the Eastern Front, the Stavka decided to conduct a number of offensive operations between 19 November 1942 and 2 February 1943 These operations opened the Winter Campaign of 1942–1943 (19 November 1942 – 3 March 1943), which involved some fifteen Armies operating on several fronts As per Zhukov, \"German operational blunders were aggravated by poor intelligence: they failed to spot preparations for the major counter-offensive near Stalingrad where there were 10 field, 1 tank and 4 air armies.\" [150]\n\n\nWeakness on the Axis flanks\nDuring the siege, the German and allied Italian, Hungarian, and Romanian armies protecting Army Group B's north and south flanks had pressed their headquarters for support The Hungarian 2nd Army was given the task of defending a 200 km (120 mi) section of the front north of Stalingrad between the Italian Army and Voronezh This resulted in a very thin line, with some sectors where 1–2 km (0.62–1.24 mi) stretches were being defended by a single platoon (platoons typically have around 20 to 50 men) These forces were also lacking in effective anti-tank weapons Zhukov states, \"Compared with the Germans, the troops of the satellites were not so well armed, less experienced and less efficient, even in defence.\" [151]\n\n\nOperation Uranus\nIn autumn, Zhukov and Vasilevsky, responsible for strategic planning in the Stalingrad area, concentrated forces in the steppes to the north and south of the city The northern flank was defended by Romanian units, often in open positions on the steppes The natural line of defence, the Don River, had never been properly established by the German side The armies in the area were also poorly equipped in terms of anti-tank weapons The plan was to punch through the overstretched and weakly defended flanks and surround the German forces in the Stalingrad region.\n\n\nSixth Army surrounded\nBy the time of the encirclement, approximately 330,000 Axis personnel, including Germans, Romanians, Italians, and Croatians, were trapped [157] [158] Among them were between 40,000 and 65,000 Hilfswillige (Hiwi), or \"volunteer auxiliaries,\" recruited from Soviet POWs and civilians These Hiwi often served in supporting roles but were also deployed in frontline units due to their growing numbers [159] [160]\n\n\nEnd of the battle\nManstein's plan to rescue the Sixth Army – Operation Winter Storm – was developed in full consultation with Führer headquarters It aimed to break through to the Sixth Army and establish a corridor to keep it supplied and reinforced, so that, according to Hitler's order, it could maintain its \"cornerstone\" position on the Volga, \"with regard to operations in 1943\" Manstein, however, who knew that Sixth Army could not survive the winter there, instructed his headquarters to draw up a further plan in the event of Hitler's seeing sense.\n\n\nOperation Winter Storm\nManstein's plan to rescue the Sixth Army – Operation Winter Storm – was developed in full consultation with Führer headquarters It

a \"mobile defence\" of small units that were to hold towns until supporting armour arrived From the Soviet bridgehead at Mamon, 15 divisions – supported by at least 100 tanks – attacked the Italian Cosseria and Ravenna Divisions, and although outnumbered 9 to 1, the Italians initially fought well, with the Germans praising the quality of the Italian defenders, [168] but on 19 December, with the Italian lines disintegrating, ARMIR headquarters ordered the battered divisions to withdraw to new lines [169]\n\n\nSoviet victory\nThe Red Army High Command sent three envoys while, simultaneously, aircraft and loudspeakers announced the terms of capitulation on 7 January 1943 The letter was signed by Colonel-General of Artillery Voronov and the commander-in-chief of the Don Front, Lieutenant-General Rokossovsky A low-level Soviet envoy party (comprising Major Aleksandr Smyslov, Captain Nikolay Dyatlenko and a trumpeter) carried generous surrender terms to Paulus: if he surrendered within 24 hours, he would receive a guarantee of safety for all prisoners, medical care for the sick and wounded, prisoners being allowed to keep their personal belongings, \"normal\" food rations, and repatriation to any country they wished after the war Rokossovsky's letter also stressed that Paulus' men were in an untenable situation Paulus requested permission to surrender, but Hitler rejected Paulus' request out of hand Accordingly, Paulus did not respond [173] [174] The German High Command informed Paulus, \"Every day that the army holds out longer helps the whole front and draws away the Russian divisions from it.\" [175]\n\n\nTactics and battle conditions\nGerman military doctrine was based on the principle of combined-arms teams and close cooperation between tanks, infantry, engineers, artillery and ground-attack aircraft To negate the German usage of tanks and artillery in the ruins of the city, Soviet commander Chuikov introduced a tactic he described as \"hugging\" the enemy: keeping Soviet front-line positions as close as possible to those of the Germans, so German artillery and aircraft could not attack without risking friendly fire [197] [198] After mid-September, to reduce casualties, he ceased launching organized daylight counterattacks, instead emphasizing small unit tactics in which infantry moved through the city's sewers to strike into the rear of attacking German units [199] The Soviets preferred night attacks, which disrupted German morale by depriving them of sleep Soviet reconnaissance patrols were used to find German positions and take prisoners for interrogation, enabling them to anticipate attacks When Soviet troops detected a coming attack, they launched their own counterattacks at dawn before German air support could arrive Soviet troops blunted the German attacks themselves through ambushes that separated tanks from their supporting infantry, as well as the employment of booby traps and mines These tactical innovations became widespread [200]\n\n\nMedical and food conditions\nThe conditions of both armies were atrocious Disease ran rampant, with many deaths due to dysentery, typhus, diphtheria, tuberculosis and jaundice, causing medical staff to fear a possible epidemic [254] Rats and mice were plentiful, serving as one reason Germans could not counterattack in time, due to mice having chewed their tank wiring [254] Lice were heavily prevalent, and plagues of flies would gather around kitchens, adding to the possibility of wound infections Brutal winter conditions affected soldiers tremendously, [32] with temperatures at times reaching as low as −40 °C in the second half of November, [255] and −30 °C in late January [254] The weather conditions were considered to be extreme and the worst possible [256] [32] The weather conditions caused rapid frostbite, with many cases of gangrene and amputation The conditions saw soldiers dying en masse due to frostbite and hypothermia [254] Both armies suffered food shortages, with mass starvation on both sides Stress, tiredness and the cold upset the metabolism of soldiers, receiving a reduced amount of calories from food [254] German forces eventually ran out of medical supplies such as ether, antiseptics and bandages Surgery had to be done without anaesthesia [254]\n\n\nCasualties\nThe Axis suffered 800,000–1,500,000 casualties (killed, wounded or captured) among all branches of the German armed forces and their allies:\n\n\nLuftwaffe losses\nThe losses of transport planes were especially serious, as they destroyed the capacity for supply of the trapped 6th Army The destruction of 72 aircraft when the airfield at Tatsinskaya Airfield was overrun meant the loss of about 10 percent of the Luftwaffe transport fleet [288]\n\n\nAftermath\nThe German public was not officially told of the impending disaster until the end of January 1943, though positive media reports had stopped in the weeks before the announcement [289] Stalingrad marked the first time that the Nazi government publicly acknowledged a failure in its war effort On 31 January, regular programmes on German state radio were replaced by a broadcast of the sombre Adagio movement from Anton Bruckner's Seventh Symphony, followed by the announcement of the defeat at Stalingrad [289] On 18 February, Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels gave the famous Sportpalast speech in Berlin, encouraging the Germans to accept a total war that would claim all resources and efforts from the entire population.\n\n\nSignificance\nStalingrad has been described as the greatest single defeat in the history of the German Army [310] Historian Geoffrey Roberts described it as \"the biggest and most traumatic defeat in German military history\" and that \"the myth of the invincible Wehrmacht was gone forever\" [311] The German military historian Walter Görlitz stated that \"It was a second Jena, and was certainly the greatest defeat in history that a German Army had ever undergone\" [312] The battle is commonly identified as the turning point on the Eastern Front, in the war against Germany overall, and in the entire Second World War [313] [314] [315] The battle is analyzed as being a \"point of no return\" on the Eastern Front and as the \"final military consequence\" of Germany's decreasing chances to win the war against the Soviet Union [316] The Soviet general Viktor Matsulenko deemed the battle to be the \"beginning of a basic turning point not just in the course of the Great Patriotic War, but for the entire World War II\" and that the battle was the \"most important military-political event of World War II\" [317] The battle is also seen as the turning point in the air war, as German forces lost countless aircraft and experienced crewmen [318] Stalingrad gave the people of the Soviet Union hope, with military historian David Glantz asserting that \"Russians, as well as many of the former Soviet Union’s other ethnic minorities, saw the Red Army’s victory at Stalingrad as a catharsis which saved Stalin’s city and salvaged a nation’s shattered pride\" [296] In 1989, a comprehensive quantitative analysis concluded that Stalingrad was the military turning point of the war, the turning point for the Soviet leadership, as Stalin recognized the practicality of using his experienced commanders and gave his generals more freedom in fighting the war, and that the Soviet Union had indeed seized the initiative as a result of the battle, based on some of the critical factors examined in the study [319] An analysis in 2004 also concluded that the epic battle sealed the fate of the Germans in the East, a blow in which they would never recover from, and as a result the strategic initiative shifted to the Soviet side, therefore establishing the Battle of Stalingrad as the fundamental turning point in the war on the Eastern Front [320] A year of Axis gains from Case Blue had been wiped out The Sixth Army of Germany had ceased to exist, and the forces of Germany's European allies, except Finland, had been shattered [321] In a speech on 9 November 1944, Hitler himself blamed Stalingrad for Germany's impending doom [322] Furthermore, according to some historians, such as Mikhail Myagkov, a Russian historian, the battle ended up completely dissuading Turkey and Japan from declaring war on the Soviet Union [323] The battle also stifled plans for future joint strategy in the Indian Ocean area between the Japanese and the Germans once their forces met up, and made certain that the German ambitions to use Soviet resources to fight against the Western Allies were no longer feasible [324] Its importance was further noted by historian John Erickson, who stated that \"If the battle of Poltava in 1709 turned Russia into a European power, then Stalingrad set the Soviet Union on the road to being a world power\" [325]\n\n\nCommemoration\nIn recognition of the determination of its defenders, Stalingrad was awarded the title Hero City in 1945 A colossal monument called The Motherland Calls was erected in 1967 on Mamayev Kurgan, the hill overlooking the city where bones and rusty metal splinters can still be found [342] The statue forms part of a war memorial complex which includes the ruins of the Grain Silo and Pavlov's House On 2 February 2013 Volgograd hosted a military parade and other events to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the final victory [343] [344] Since then, military parades have always commemorated the victory in the city.\n\n\nIn popular culture\nThe events of the Battle for Stalingrad have been covered in numerous media works of British, American, German, and Russian origin, [346] for its significance as a turning point in the Second World War and for the loss of life associated with the battle Stalingrad has become synonymous with large-scale urban battles with immense casualties on both sides, [36] [31] [347] [32] [34] and according to historian David Glantz, has become a \"metaphor for the ferocity of the Soviet-German conflict and, indeed, for the devastating nature of twentieth-century warfare as a whole\" [348] Also, historian Geoffrey Roberts states that \"No battle of any war has had more written about it than Stalingrad\" [349] and that \"No battle of the Second World War has captured the public imagination as much as the clash between Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany at Stalingrad in 1942. .. Stalingrad was an epic battle unmatched by any other in its dimensions, drama and decisiveness.\" [350] In addition, besides the battle being recognized as the bloodiest and fiercest of the war, it is also considered to have been the closest of the war as well, [351] as Geoffrey Roberts quotes the Duke of Wellington's remark about the Battle of Waterloo as a \"close-run thing\" to describe the Battle of Stalingrad, [352] further adding to its popularity status and notoriety.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is contested between the champions of the Primeira Liga and the winners of Taça de Portugal. The competition is named after Cândido de Oliveira, a renowned Portuguese footballer and coach.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira was first conceived in the 1943–44 season, with the inaugural game played between Primeira Divisão champions Sporting CP and Taça de Portugal winners Benfica. The match was held on the occasion of the inauguration of the Estádio Nacional, a prominent football stadium in Portugal. The trophy, commissioned specifically for the occasion, was called the Taça Império – a distinction that should not be confused with Taça do Império, the first incarnation of the Taça de Portugal.\n\nHowever, following the game, it was decided that the competition would be continued, but it was later canceled due to a decrease in interest. It took 20 years for the Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira to re-emerge, when Casa da Imprensa (The Press House) instituted a trophy, the Taça de Ouro da Imprensa. This new incarnation of the competition was designed to be contested between the national champions and the cup winners.\n\n**Editions**\n\nSince its revival, the Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira has been held annually, with the exception of a few instances where the competition was postponed or canceled due to logistical or scheduling conflicts. The Supertaça has been played at various stadiums across Portugal, with the Estádio Nacional and Estádio do Dragão being the most frequent hosts.\n\nThroughout its history, the Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira has had its fair share of memorable matches, with some of the most notable encounters between rival clubs such as Benfica, Sporting CP, and Porto. These matches have not only showcased exceptional football skills but also highlighted the intense rivalries and competitiveness that define the world of Portuguese football.\n\n**Performance by Club**\n\nThe Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira has been dominated by a few clubs, with Benfica and Porto emerging as the most successful teams in the competition's history. Benfica has won the Supertaça on 11 occasions, while Porto has secured the trophy 9 times. Sporting CP, the inaugural winners of the competition, have also enjoyed some success, claiming the Supertaça on 5 occasions.\n\nThe following table provides a comprehensive breakdown of the performance by club in the Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira:\n\n| Club | Supertaça Titles | Runners-up |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Benfica | 11 | 8 |\n| Porto | 9 | 6 |\n| Sporting CP | 5 | 8 |\n| Braga | 2 | 2 |\n| Vizela | 1 | 0 |\n| Sporting de Braga | 1 | 0 |\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira has undergone several changes throughout its history, with the most significant revision taking place in 1998. At that time, the competition was renamed Supertaça de Portugal, and the trophy was redesigned to feature the image of Cândido de Oliveira.\n\nIn recent years, the Supertaça has gained popularity, with increasing numbers of fans attending the matches. The competition has also attracted attention from football enthusiasts worldwide, with the Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira being considered one of the most prestigious domestic cup competitions in Portugal.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Primeira Liga\n* Taça de Portugal\n* Portuguese Football Federation\n* List of Portuguese Football Champions\n* List of Taça de Portugal winners\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Official Website of the Portuguese Football Federation\n* Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira on UEFA.com\n* Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira on RSSSF.com", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Supertaça_Cândido_de_Oliveira\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nIn the 1943–44 season, the Super Cup was created for a special game between Primeira Divisão champions Sporting CP and Taça de Portugal winners Benfica, on occasion of the inauguration of the Estádio Nacional The commissioned trophy was named Taça Império – not to be mistaken with Taça do Império, the first incarnation of the Taça de Portugal After the game, it was decided that the competition was to be continued, but it was later canceled The second incarnation came 20 years later when Casa da Imprensa (The Press House) instituted a trophy, the Taça de Ouro da Imprensa to be challenged between the national champions and the cup winners.\n\n\nEditions\n\n\nPerformance by club\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

he was on the loose for several hours [21] The incident began after a pedestrian threw an empty soda bottle at the car, which went through a partially open window and struck Travis while they were stopped at a red light [3] Startled, he unbuckled his seat belt, got out of the car, and chased the pedestrian, but missed him When police arrived, they lured Travis into the car several times, only for him to let himself out of another door and occasionally chase them around the car [9]\n\n\n2009 attack\nOn February 16, 2009, at around 3:40 pm, Travis attacked and mauled Sandra's 55-year-old friend, Charla Nash, inflicting devastating injuries to her face and limbs [23] [24] Travis had taken   Sandra's car keys and left the house with them Sandra asked Charla to help get the chimp back inside; upon seeing Charla holding an Elmo doll, one of his favorite toys, Travis flew into a rage and attacked her [9]Travis was familiar with Charla, as she had also worked at Sandra and Jerome's towing company, although she had a different hairstyle and was driving a different car at the time of the attack, which may have confused and alarmed the chimp [25]Sandra had previously given Travis tea which she had laced with  Xanax He was also on medications for Lyme disease [8] Sandra attempted to stop Travis by beating him on the head with a shovel and stabbing him in the back with a butcher knife.\n\n\nAftermath\nThe paramedic crew described Charla's injuries as \"horrendous\" [21] Within the following 72 hours, she underwent more than seven hours of surgery on her face and hands by four teams of surgeons The hospital provided counseling to staff members who initially treated her because of the extraordinary nature of her wounds [31] Paramedics noted she had lost her eyes, nose, lips, mid-face bone structure, and 9 fingers [32] Doctors removed some of Travis's hair and teeth that were embedded in her bones and reattached her jaw, but announced on April 7, 2009 that she would be blind for life Her injuries made her a possible candidate for an experimental face transplant surgery [31] After initial treatment at Stamford Hospital, she was transferred to the Cleveland Clinic [33] Her family started a trust fund to raise money to pay her \"unfathomable\" medical bills and support her daughter [34] She revealed her face in public for the first time since the attack on The Oprah Winfrey Show on November 11, 2009 She was not in physical pain from the attack at that time, and relatives said she hoped to leave the Cleveland Clinic soon [35] Pictures have surfaced on the Internet displaying her face before and after the attack [30]\n\n\nLawsuits\nIn March 2009, Charla's family attorney filed a $50 million lawsuit against Sandra [52] On May 6, a Stamford judge froze her assets, valued at US$10 million [53] Another potential defendant was the DEP, the city of Stamford, and the veterinarian who prescribed the Xanax [citation needed] The defense claimed Travis had no violent behavior before the attack, that the 1996 attack was an act of provocation, and that he had no teeth; he denied that the 1998 attack occurred [54] In November 2012, Charla settled with Sandra's estate and received approximately $4 million [55]\n\n\nIn media\nNews reports of the incident spread as far away as Ireland, China, and Russia [58] The attack, reminiscent of another one that occurred four years earlier in California, [59] provoked discussion by sources such as Time magazine and primatologists Jane Goodall and Frans de Waal about the logic of keeping such exotic animals as pets [60] [61] [62]\n\n\nInfluence on legislation\nConnecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal noted that a defect in the existing 2004 Connecticut law prohibiting chimpanzees Travis's size, itself a result of the 2003 incident, allowed the attack to occur [69] A Connecticut DEP spokesperson clarified that Travis was exempt because he did not appear to present a public health risk and was owned before the registration requirement began [70] The DEP was seeking a law banning large primates and, after the incident, announced that it sought the help of the public, police officers, and animal control officers to report such pets to the agency The editorial board of the Stamford Advocate newspaper also supported banning the possession of all exotic birds and reptiles [71]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born and raised in Stockholm, Sweden, Ek has had a successful career in the tech industry, with a focus on innovation and entrepreneurship.\n\nEarly Life and Education\n-------------------------\n\nDaniel Ek grew up in the Rågsved district of Stockholm, Sweden. He developed an interest in technology and programming at a young age and went on to study engineering at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology. However, Ek dropped out of college after just eight weeks to focus on his IT career.\n\nCareer\n--------\n\nEk's early career in the tech industry was marked by several notable roles. He held a senior position at Nordic auction company Tradera, which was acquired by eBay in 2006. Ek was also the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of the browser-based game and fashion community Stardoll. In addition, he co-founded Advertigo, an online advertising company that was later sold to TradeDoubler in 2006.\n\nEk's most notable achievement came when he briefly became the CEO of μTorrent, a popular BitTorrent client. During his time at μTorrent, Ek worked closely with the company's founder, Ludvig Strigeus. Ek also gained notoriety for hacking Google's search algorithm in 2007, forcing the Tradera site to show at the top of Google search results. Ek did this as a response to being rejected by Google, but the move ultimately ended when μTorrent was sold to BitTorrent in December 2006.\n\nSpotify\n--------\n\nThe sale of Advertigo and his previous work made Ek wealthy enough that he decided to retire. However, after a few months, he realized he wanted a new project, leading to him founding Spotify. Ek first had the idea for Spotify in 2002, when peer-to-peer music service Napster shut down and another illegal site, Kazaa, took over the market. Ek realized that the only way to solve the problem of piracy was to create a service that was better than piracy and at the same time compensated the music industry.\n\nEk's vision for Spotify was to create a music streaming service that would revolutionize the way people consumed music. He assembled a team of talented developers and designers, and together they worked tirelessly to bring the service to life. Spotify launched in 2008 and quickly gained popularity, thanks to its user-friendly interface and vast music library.\n\nNeko Health\n------------\n\nIn 2018, Ek co-founded the medical technology company Neko Health, alongside engineer Hjalmar Nilsonne. The company emerged from stealth mode in 2023, showcasing its non-invasive full-body scanning technology. This technology uses sensors and artificial intelligence to collect and analyze health data. Initially self-funded with €30 million from Ek through his investment vehicle, the company has since received backing from outside investors. Neko Health operates in Stockholm and London as of 2024.\n\nPolitical Positions\n-------------------\n\nIn 2016, Ek and fellow Spotify co-founder Martin Lorentzon wrote an open letter to the Swedish government, warning that if certain changes to Swedish law regarding housing, taxation, and education were not made, Spotify would be forced to relocate from the country. Ek claimed that the high taxes in Sweden on stock options made it difficult to incentivize programmers to work at startups. He also argued that the Swedish permitting policy was overly restrictive, limiting the supply of affordable housing.\n\nPersonal Life\n--------------\n\nIn 2016, Ek married Sofia Levander, his longtime partner, at Lake Como. The wedding was attended by numerous high-profile guests, including Bruno Mars and Mark Zuckerberg. Ek and his wife have two daughters together.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Daniel_Ek\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nEk grew up in the Rågsved district of Stockholm, Sweden [4] He graduated from high school in IT-Gymnasiet in Sundbyberg Municipality in 2002 and then studied engineering at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology for 8 weeks before dropping out to focus on his IT career [5] [6]\n\n\nCareer\nEk had a senior role at Nordic auction company Tradera, which was acquired by eBay in 2006 He was also the CTO of the browser-based game and fashion community Stardoll and later started Advertigo, an online advertising company Advertigo was sold to TradeDoubler in 2006, [7] after which Ek briefly became the CEO of μTorrent, working with μTorrent founder Ludvig Strigeus He also hacked Google’s search algorithm in 2007 when he was working in Tradera, in order to force the Tradera site to show at the top of the Google search He did this because he got rejected by Google This ended when μTorrent was sold to BitTorrent on 7 December 2006 Strigeus would later join Ek as a Spotify developer [8]\n\n\nEarly career\nEk had a senior role at Nordic auction company Tradera, which was acquired by eBay in 2006 He was also the CTO of the browser-based game and fashion community Stardoll and later started Advertigo, an online advertising company Advertigo was sold to TradeDoubler in 2006, [7] after which Ek briefly became the CEO of μTorrent, working with μTorrent founder Ludvig Strigeus He also hacked Google’s search algorithm in 2007 when he was working in Tradera, in order to force the Tradera site to show at the top of the Google search He did this because he got rejected by Google This ended when μTorrent was sold to BitTorrent on 7 December 2006 Strigeus would later join Ek as a Spotify developer [8]\n\n\nSpotify\nThe sale of Advertigo as well as his previous work made Ek wealthy enough that he decided to retire However, after a few months, he realized he wanted a new project, leading to him founding Spotify [9] Ek first had the idea for Spotify in 2002 when peer-to-peer music service Napster shut down and another illegal site Kazaa took over Ek said he \"realized that you can never legislate away from piracy Laws can definitely help, but it doesn't take away the problem The only way to solve the problem was to create a service that was better than piracy and at the same time compensates the music industry – that gave us Spotify.\" [7]\n\n\nNeko Health\nEk co-founded the medical technology company Neko Health in 2018, along with engineer Hjalmar Nilsonne The company emerged from stealth mode in 2023 showcasing its non-invasive full-body scanning technology, which uses sensors and artificial intelligence to collect and analyze health data Initially self-funded with €30 million from Ek through his investment vehicle, the company has since received backing from outside investors The company operates in Stockholm and London as of 2024 [19] [20] [21]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nIn 2016, Ek and fellow Spotify co-founder Martin Lorentzon wrote an open letter on the blogging platform Medium to the Swedish government saying that if certain changes to Swedish law regarding housing, taxation, and education are not made, Spotify will be forced to relocate from the country [22] More specifically, Ek claims that the high taxes in Sweden on stock options makes it difficult to incentivize programmers to work at startups when startups have trouble competing with larger companies on salary Moreover, Ek claims the Swedish permitting policy is overly restrictive, limiting the supply of affordable housing [23]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn 2016, Ek married Sofia Levander, his longtime partner, at Lake Como At Ek's wedding, Bruno Mars performed and Chris Rock officiated; he invited numerous guests, including Mark Zuckerberg [24] Ek and his wife have two daughters together [21]\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

year of fieldwork researching Pakistani madrassas as a Fulbright Scholar [22]\n\n\nWorld Bank (1991–2001)\nIn 1991, Ghani became Lead Anthropologist at the World Bank During this time, he spent five years working in China, India, and Russia working on various projects [22] After the mid-nineties, he switched to working on the Bank's social policy, reviewing country strategies, and designing reform programs [27] While working for the Bank, he attended the leadership training programs of Harvard-INSEAD and World Bank-Stanford Graduate School of Business.\n\n\nReturn to Afghanistan (2001–2013)\nIn December 2001, he finally returned to Afghanistan after 24 years of absence After the ousting of the Taliban that year, Ghani became a key figure in the Afghan Interim Administration, which lasted from December 2001 until July 2002.\n\n\nMinister of Finance (2002–2004)\nOn 2 June 2002, Ghani became finance minister of the new Transitional Afghan government under President Karzai This government would last until 2004, when it was to be replaced by a \"fully representative government\".\n\n\nChancellor of Kabul University (2004–2008)\nAfter Karzai was elected in October 2004, Ghani had declined to join his cabinet and instead asked to be appointed to the chancellorship at Kabul University [citation needed] From 22 December 2004 to 21 December 2008, Ghani thus served as Chancellor of Kabul University He focused on rebuilding the university and its resources after years of conflict and neglect under the Taliban government.\n\n\n2009 presidential election\nIn January 2009, an article by Ahmad Majidyar of the American Enterprise Institute included Ghani on a list of fifteen possible candidates in the 2009 Afghan presidential election [36] [37]\n\n\nChairman of Transition Coordination Commission (2010–2013)\nFrom 2010 to 1 October 2013, he served as chairman of the Afghan Transition Coordination Commission (TCC), which was responsible for transferring power from ISAF/NATO troops to Afghan Security Forces He travelled across Afghanistan extensively during this time [27]\n\n\nPresidency (2014–2021)\nAfter announcing his candidacy for the 2014 elections, Ghani tapped General Abdul Rashid Dostum, a prominent Uzbek politician and former military official in Karzai's government, and Sarwar Danish, an ethnic Hazara who  served as the justice minister in Karzai's cabinet, as his vice presidential candidates [43]\n\n\nEconomy and trade\nDuring his tenure, Ghani strengthened ties with Central Asian countries such as Uzbekistan, with which it has made deals to increase mutual trading [46] [47] New trade routes have also been launched within the wider region The Chabahar Port in Iran allows increased trading with India whilst avoiding Pakistani territory [48] Plans for a railway line from Khaf, Iran to Herat, Afghanistan were set in motion in 2018, with the railway being completed in 2020 [49] [50] In 2017, a railway line from Turkmenistan was extended to Aqina in Afghanistan, the precursor of the \"Lapis Lazuli\" transport corridor that was signed by Ghani that same year and would link Afghanistan to the Caucasus and the Black Sea [51] Other regional projects include the CASA-1000 hydroelectricity transmission from Central Asia, and the TAPI gas pipeline, expected to be completed by 2018 and 2019 respectively [52] In January 2018, at the inauguration of the Khan Steel iron smelting plant in Kabul, Ghani said that he is aiming for Afghanistan to become a steel exporter [53]\n\n\nRelations with Pakistan and India\nSince his election, Ghani wanted to improve relations with Pakistan, which in turn could pave the way for peace talks with the Taliban [citation needed] He refused to recognize the border with Pakistan, known as the Durand Line, which Pakistan views as an existential issue [55] He made his first visit to Pakistan on 14 November 2014, meeting Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif [56] However, after many terror attacks in Afghanistan which were largely blamed on Pakistan, and failed Taliban peace talks, Ghani grew increasingly cold to Pakistan [57] Ghani claimed that Pakistan had hit an \"undeclared war of aggression\" against Afghanistan [58] Following two deadly Taliban/Haqqani attacks in Kabul in January 2018, Ghani called Pakistan the \"center of the Taliban\" [59] Tolo News while quoting an unnamed source alleged that Ashraf Ghani had refused to take a call from the Pakistani prime minister, instead he sent a NDS delegation to hand over evidence that the terrorists were supported by Pakistan [60] However, Afghan envoy Omar Zakhilwal rejected such reports regarding Ghani's phone call rejection with Pakistan prime minister He stated that no phone call took place between the two leaders and that such reports are baseless [61] At a July 2021 conference in Tashkent, Ghani accused Pakistan of fomenting violence in Afghanistan through the Taliban; Pakistan accused Afghanistan of helping insurgent groups inside Pakistan (the Tehreek-e-Taliban and the Balochistan Liberation Army) [62]\n\n\nRelations with Taliban\nIn an interview with Vice News, Ghani said that his 'heart breaks for  [the] Taliban' He further stated that 'Talibans are Afghans and he is president of all Afghans' [67] [68] [69] Ashraf Ghani also said that he is willing to offer Afghan passports to the Taliban and to recognise them as a legitimate political group in Afghanistan, as an attempt to strike a peace deal with them [70]\n\n\nFlight from Afghanistan\nThe Taliban took control of Afghanistan on 15 August and Ghani was deposed [78] [79] That day, Ghani left Afghanistan with his wife and two close aides to Uzbekistan as the Taliban captured Kabul The Arg, the presidential palace, was captured a few hours later by the group Afghan officials stated that Ghani had left the presidential palace Sunday morning to go to the US embassy He has since been described as the former president [80] [81] [82] [83] A senior cabinet minister said that Ghani fled to Tajikistan, [84] however it was then claimed that he landed in Tashkent, capital of Uzbekistan [85]\n\n\nPolitical views\nGhani is a progressive modernist with the belief and goal to \"transform Afghanistan from a tribal, patronage-based society to a modern technocratic state\" [10] He is a fond admirer of both King Amanullah Khan, who was a progressive Afghan monarch in the 1920s, [104] [105] and General Sardar Mohammad Daoud Khan, a former prime minister of the Kingdom of Afghanistan, who served as the first president of the Republic of Afghanistan in the 1970s [106]\n\n\nPersonal life\nAshraf Ghani is married to Rula Saade, [107] who was born into a Lebanese Christian family [108] The couple married after they met during their studies at the American University of Beirut, Lebanon during the 1970s [109] They eventually settled in the United States and obtained U.S citizenship However, Ghani renounced his U.S citizenship in 2009 so he could run in Afghan elections [1]\n\n\nControversy\nOn 2 February 2020, Ashraf Ghani made controversial remarks while talking about Timur and Muhammad of Ghor [117] which angered the Uzbek population of Afghanistan [118] He made those remarks while delivering a speech to a group of Afghan students on History, Culture, and the National Identity [118] [119] Ghani stated that Muhammad of Ghor destroyed Afghanistan's central irrigation system while Genghis Khan demolished the irrigation system of the northern provinces Ghani also referred to Turkic conqueror Amir Timur by his Persian-origin epithet \"Timur Lang\" (Timur the Lame) and stated that Timur wiped-out the irrigation system for Sistan, Farah, and Helmand provinces [119] His remarks regarding Timur were considered offensive to Uzbeks, according to experts, and drew condemnation from Afghanistan's Uzbek population [118]\n\n\nPublications\nGhani is the coauthor with Clare Lockhart of Fixing Failed States: A Framework for Rebuilding a Fractured World (2008) [122] Along with Lockhart, he was listed on the 'Top 100 global thinkers list' for 2010 by Foreign Policy [123]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nSee

His academic research was on state-building and social transformation. In 1985, he completed a year of fieldwork researching Pakistani madrassas as a Fulbright Scholar.\n\n**World Bank (1991–2001)**\n\nIn 1991, Ghani became Lead Anthropologist at the World Bank. During this time, he spent five years working in China, India, and Russia working on various projects. After the mid-nineties, he switched to working on the Bank's social policy, reviewing country strategies, and designing reform programs. While working for the Bank, he attended the leadership training programs of Harvard-INSEAD and World Bank-Stanford Graduate School of Business.\n\n**Return to Afghanistan (2001–2013)**\n\nIn December 2001, he finally returned to Afghanistan after 24 years of absence. After the ousting of the Taliban that year, Ghani became a key figure in the Afghan Interim Administration, which lasted from December 2001 until July 2002.\n\n**Minister of Finance (2002–2004)**\n\nOn 2 June 2002, Ghani became finance minister of the new Transitional Afghan government under President Karzai. This government would last until 2004, when it was to be replaced by a \"fully representative government\".\n\n**Chancellor of Kabul University (2004–2008)**\n\nAfter Karzai was elected in October 2004, Ghani had declined to join his cabinet and instead asked to be appointed to the chancellorship at Kabul University. From 22 December 2004 to 21 December 2008, Ghani thus served as Chancellor of Kabul University. He focused on rebuilding the university and its resources after years of conflict and neglect under the Taliban government.\n\n**2009 presidential election**\n\nIn January 2009, an article by Ahmad Majidyar of the American Enterprise Institute included Ghani on a list of fifteen possible candidates in the 2009 Afghan presidential election.\n\n**Chairman of Transition Coordination Commission (2010–2013)**\n\nFrom 2010 to 1 October 2013, he served as chairman of the Afghan Transition Coordination Commission (TCC), which was responsible for transferring power from ISAF/NATO troops to Afghan Security Forces. He travelled across Afghanistan extensively during this time.\n\n**Presidency (2014–2021)**\n\nAfter announcing his candidacy for the 2014 elections, Ghani tapped General Abdul Rashid Dostum, a prominent Uzbek politician and former military official in Karzai's government, and Sarwar Danish, an ethnic Hazara who served as the justice minister in Karzai's cabinet, as his vice presidential candidates.\n\nDuring his tenure, Ghani strengthened ties with Central Asian countries such as Uzbekistan, with which it has made deals to increase mutual trading. New trade routes have also been launched within the wider region. The Chabahar Port in Iran allows increased trading with India whilst avoiding Pakistani territory. Plans for a railway line from Khaf, Iran to Herat, Afghanistan were set in motion in 2018, with the railway being completed in 2020. In 2017, a railway line from Turkmenistan was extended to Aqina in Afghanistan, the precursor of the \"Lapis Lazuli\" transport corridor that was signed by Ghani that same year and would link Afghanistan to the Caucasus and the Black Sea. Other regional projects include the CASA-1000 hydroelectricity transmission from Central Asia, and the TAPI gas pipeline, expected to be completed by 2018 and 2019 respectively.\n\n**Relations with Pakistan and India**\n\nSince his election, Ghani wanted to improve relations with Pakistan, which in turn could pave the way for peace talks with the Taliban. He refused to recognize the border with Pakistan, known as the Durand Line, which Pakistan views as an existential issue. He made his first visit to Pakistan on 14 November 2014, meeting Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. However, after many terror attacks in Afghanistan which were largely blamed on Pakistan, and failed Taliban peace talks, Ghani grew increasingly cold to Pakistan. Ghani claimed that Pakistan had hit an \"undeclared war of aggression\" against Afghanistan. Following two deadly Taliban/Haqqani attacks in Kabul in January 2018, Ghani called Pakistan the \"center of the Taliban\". Tolo News while quoting an unnamed source alleged that Ashraf Ghani had refused to take a call from the Pakistani prime minister, instead he sent a NDS delegation to hand over evidence that the terrorists were supported by Pakistan. However, Afghan envoy Omar Zakhilwal rejected such reports regarding Ghani's phone call rejection with Pakistan prime minister He stated that no phone call took place between the two leaders and that such reports are baseless. At a July 2021 conference in Tashkent, Ghani accused Pakistan of fomenting violence in Afghanistan through the Taliban; Pakistan accused Afghanistan of helping insurgent groups inside Pakistan (the Tehreek-e-Taliban and the Balochistan Liberation Army).\n\n**Relations with Taliban**\n\nIn an interview with Vice News, Ghani said that his 'heart breaks for the Taliban'. He further stated that 'Talibans are Afghans and he is president of all Afghans'. Ashraf Ghani also said that he is willing to offer Afghan passports to the Taliban and to recognise them as a legitimate political group in Afghanistan, as an attempt to strike a peace deal with them.\n\n**Flight from Afghanistan**\n\nThe Taliban took control of Afghanistan on 15 August and Ghani was deposed. That day, Ghani left Afghanistan with his wife and two close aides to Uzbekistan as the Taliban captured Kabul. The Arg, the presidential palace, was captured a few hours later by the group. Afghan officials stated that Ghani had left the presidential palace Sunday morning to go to the US embassy. He has since been described as the former president. A senior cabinet minister said that Ghani fled to Tajikistan, however it was then claimed that he landed in Tashkent, capital of Uzbekistan.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nAshraf Ghani is married to Rula Saade, who was born into a Lebanese Christian family. The couple married after they met during their studies at the American University of Beirut, Lebanon during the 1970s. They eventually settled in the United States and obtained U.S citizenship. However, Ghani renounced his U.S citizenship in 2009 so he could run in Afghan elections.\n\n**Controversy**\n\nOn 2 February 2020, Ashraf Ghani made controversial remarks while talking about Timur and Muhammad of Ghor, which angered the Uzbek population of Afghanistan. He made those remarks while delivering a speech to a group of Afghan students on History, Culture, and the National Identity. Ghani stated that Muhammad of Ghor destroyed Afghanistan's central irrigation system while Genghis Khan demolished the irrigation system of the northern provinces. Ghani also referred to Turkic conqueror Amir Timur by his Persian-origin epithet \"Timur Lang\" (Timur the Lame) and stated that Timur wiped-out the irrigation system for Sistan, Farah, and Helmand provinces. His remarks regarding Timur were considered offensive to Uzbeks, according to experts, and drew condemnation from Afghanistan's Uzbek population.\n\n**Publications**\n\nGhani is the coauthor with Clare Lockhart of Fixing Failed States: A Framework for Rebuilding a Fractured World (2008).
