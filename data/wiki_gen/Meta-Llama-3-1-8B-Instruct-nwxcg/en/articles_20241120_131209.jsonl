{"title": "Anwar_Ibrahim", "content": "\nEarly life and education\nAnwar bin Ibrahim was born in Cherok Tok Kun, Bukit Mertajam in the Crown Colony of Penang [18] [19] His father, Ibrahim bin Abdul Rahman  [ms], started his career as a hospital porter, and later joined politics as a member of  UMNO Ibrahim won election as Seberang Tengah in 1959 and 1964, serving as the parliamentary secretary to the ministry of health from 1964 until his defeat in the 1969 general election by Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia candidate Mustapha Hussain  [ms] Anwar's mother, Che Yan binti Hussein, was a housewife active in UMNO grassroots politics in Penang [20]\n\n\nEarly years and activism (1968–1982)\nFrom 1968 to 1971, as a student, Anwar was the president of the National Union of Malaysian Muslim Students Around the same time, he was also the president of the University of Malaya Malay Language Society (Malay: Persatuan Bahasa Melayu Universiti Malaya  [ms] (PBMUM)) In 1971, he was a member of the pro tem committee of Angkatan Belia Islam Malaysia (ABIM) or Muslim Youth Movement of Malaysia, which he co-founded At the same time, he was elected as the 2nd President of the Malaysian Youth Council or Majlis Belia Malaysia (MBM) In 1974, Anwar was arrested during student protests against rural poverty and hunger This came as a report surfaced stating that a family died from starvation in a village in Baling, in the state of Kedah, which was later demonstrated to be false However, the rubber tappers in Baling were experiencing severe hardship as the price of rubber dropped in 1974 He was imprisoned under the Internal Security Act (ISA), which allowed for detention without trial and spent 20 months in the Kamunting Detention Centre From 1975 until 1982, he served as a representative for Asia Pacific of the World Assembly of Muslim Youth (WAMY) [25] Anwar Ibrahim is also the co-founder of the International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT) in the USA (founded in 1981) [26] Anwar has been one of four acting directors, a board member of IIIT [27] and a trustee [28] [29] He was also a chancellor of International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM) between 1988 and 1998 [25]\n\n\nEarly political career (1982–1993)\nIn 1982, Anwar, who was the founding leader and second president of the Islamic youth organisation Angkatan Belia Islam Malaysia (ABIM), joined the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), which was led by Mahathir Mohamad, who had become prime minister in 1981 Anwar's decision was influenced by the advice of Palestinian-American scholar Ismail al-Faruqi, who recognized the Mahathir administration's commitment to its Islamization agenda [30]\n\n\nDeputy Prime Minister (1993–1998)\nIn 1993, he became Mahathir's deputy prime minister after beating Abdul Ghafar Baba for the position of deputy president in UMNO Anwar's allusions in public to his \"son-father\" relationship with Mahathir contributed to view that he was to be Mahathir's successor.\n\n\nFinancial crisis\nDuring the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, Anwar supported the IMF plan as a finance minister He also instituted an austerity package that cut government spending by 18%, cut ministerial salaries and deferred major projects \"Mega projects\", despite being a cornerstone of Mahathir's development strategy, were greatly curtailed [37]\n\n\nFall from power and first sodomy conviction\nIn 1998 the Newsweek magazine named Anwar the \"Asian of the Year\" in spite of being beaten by the then Inspector General of Police [39] However, in that year, matters between Anwar and Mahathir came to a head around the quadrennial UMNO General Assembly The Youth wing of UMNO, headed by Anwar's associate Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, gave notice that it would initiate a debate on \"cronyism and nepotism\"  At the General Assembly, a book by Khalid Jafri, \"50 Dalil Kenapa Anwar Tidak Boleh Jadi PM\" (\"50 Reasons Why Anwar Cannot Become Prime Minister\") was circulated containing graphic allegations of homosexuality, as well as accusations of corruption against Anwar Khalid Jafri was an ex-editor of the government-controlled newspaper Utusan Malaysia and former editor-in-chief of a failed magazine, Harian National Anwar obtained a court injunction to prevent further distribution of the book and filed a lawsuit against the author for defamation Police charged the author of the book with malicious publishing of false news [40] The police were instructed to investigate the veracity of the claims.\n\n\nReformasi and formation of KEADILAN (1998–1999)\nShortly after Anwar was dismissed as deputy prime minister, Anwar and his supporters initiated the Reformasi movement It consisted of several mass demonstrations and rallies against the long-standing Barisan Nasional coalition government.\n\n\nInterim years (1999–2007)\nIn 1999, Anwar brought suit against Prime Minister Mahathir for defamation for allegedly uttering accusations of immoral acts and calling Anwar a homosexual at a news conference in Malaysia [50]\n\n\nFirst sodomy conviction\nIn 1999, Anwar brought suit against Prime Minister Mahathir for defamation for allegedly uttering accusations of immoral acts and calling Anwar a homosexual at a news conference in Malaysia [50]\n\n\nTeaching and non-profit work\nAfter his release from prison, Anwar held teaching positions at St Antony's College, Oxford, where he was a visiting fellow and senior associate member, at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, D.C., as a Distinguished Senior Visiting Fellow, and in 2005–2006 as a visiting professor at the Prince Alwaleed Center for Muslim–Christian Understanding in the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University [57] In March 2006 he was appointed as Honorary President of the London-based organisation AccountAbility (Institute of Social and Ethical AccountAbility) [58]\n\n\nReturn to politics\nIn November 2006, Anwar announced he planned to run for Parliament in 2008 after his disqualification expired Anwar was critical of government policies after his release from prison, most notably the New Economic Policy (NEP), which provided affirmative action for the Bumiputras The policy set a number of quotas, such as for units of housing and initial public offerings, that must be met [61]\n\n\nPermatang Pauh by-election\nAnwar Ibrahim was victorious in the Permatang Pauh by-election held on 26 August 2008 Muhammad Muhammad Taib, information chief of the UMNO, stated: \"Yes, of course we have lost .. we were the underdogs going into this race.\" [68] Final results announced by the Election Commission revealed that Anwar Ibrahim won 31,195 of the estimated 47,000 votes cast in the district, while Arif Shah Omar Shah received 15,524 votes and a third candidate had 92 votes [69] [70]\n\n\nFirst term as Leader of the Opposition (2008–2015)\nOn 26 August 2008, Anwar won re-election in the Permatang Pauh by-election and returned to Parliament as Leader of the Opposition He has stated the need for liberalisation, including an independent judiciary and free media, to combat the endemic corruption that he considers pushes Malaysia close to failed state status [76]\n\n\nPetition against Najib Razak\nAnwar continued to attack Najib on his first day as prime minister, stating he found inconsistencies in the latter's decision to release 13 Internal Security Act (ISA) detainees He said as long as the ISA existed, Barisan Nasional could still detain citizens at will [77] In September 2011 Prime Minister Najib Razak acted to abolish the ISA and three other laws [78] Some members of the opposition did not view this in a positive way [79]\n\n\nParliamentary censure over APCO and 1Malaysia\nAnwar has made numerous remarks about a supposed conspiracy among the Malaysian government, APCO (a public relations firm retained by the Malaysian government), Israel, and the United States Anwar condemned the Malaysian government for seeking advice from APCO He claims that the firm is linked to the \"murder of Muslims in Palestine.\" He further claims to have given proof to a disciplinary committee of the Malaysian parliament, investigating his comments, that APCO is a front for the Israeli government On another occasion, Anwar, speaking from the parliament, claimed that the firm was controlled by Jews and working on behalf of the American government to influence Malaysian foreign policy He further implied that changes in Malaysian foreign policy could only be explained if Jews were manipulating Malaysia for the United States [80]\n\n\nAttempts to form a majority coalition\nAnwar has missed several deadlines he personally set for the transfer of power [85] Anwar said he would need more time, and the recalibration of his message has not gone unnoticed: Deputy Prime Minister Najib Razak chose that day to initiate a broadband internet program Anwar opposes, saying that he had not doubted that the government would still be in office on 16 September [86] Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi too pointed out that Anwar had missed his own deadline, and dismissed his claim to have secured the defection of 30 MPs [87]\n\n\n2013 general election\nIn the 2013 general election (GE13), Anwar Ibrahim, as the Leader of the Opposition, led his Pakatan Rakyat coalition (comprising the three parties DAP, PAS, and PKR) to contest in the election On 25 February 2013, Pakatan Rakyat launched their manifesto titled The People's Manifesto: Pakatan the hope of the people, pledging to reduce their financial burden, among other promises [95] [96] Anwar, who has taught at Oxford and Georgetown University, said he would return to academic life if he lost the next election to incumbent prime minister Najib Razak [97]\n\n\nKajang Move\nOn 27 January 2014, the member of the Selangor State Legislative Assembly for Kajang, Lee Chin Cheh, resigned [105] This triggered a by-election A day later, Anwar Ibrahim was announced as Pakatan Rakyat candidate for the by-election [106] Anwar's candidacy was originally to propel him to become Selangor's Menteri Besar [107] Later, this move was known as the \"Kajang Move\".\n\n\n2008–2014 sodomy trials\nOn 29 June 2008, online news portal Malaysiakini reported that a male aide of Anwar, Saiful Bukhari Azlan, had lodged a police report claiming that he had been sodomised by Anwar [112] Anwar said that the possibility of a prison sentence as a result of the allegations could be seen as an attempt to remove him from the leadership of the opposition following his growing support and by-election victories He also reaffirmed his innocence and cited evidence in the form of medical reports [76] In July 2008, he was arrested over allegations of sodomy again, but was acquitted of the charge in January 2012 by The High Court [113] The presiding judge ruled that DNA evidence used in the case had been compromised and was unreliable [114] The prosecution filed an appeal against the acquittal [115]\n\n\nPakatan Harapan backbencher (2018–2020)\nAfter the Pakatan Rakyat's dissolution during his imprisonment, a new opposition coalition named the Pakatan Harapan was formed with Anwar as the de facto leader in absentia The coalition had come into power by overthrowing Barisan Nasional in the 2018 general election (GE14) Following the formation of the new ruling government, Anwar was given a full royal pardon and was released from prison on 16 May 2018 He was designated to take over the reins from interim Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad as planned and agreed by the coalition before GE14 [121] [122] In an interview, he justified his reluctance to immediately step into power on the basis that Mahathir appeared committed to the reform agenda, and was doing a good job tackling a \"disintegrating\" political system He also added that he was keen to travel and honour speaking engagements [123] Anwar also indicated that he initially had reservations about Mahathir's \"reconciliation efforts\", but he eventually forgave his former enemy after Mahathir showed \"compassion and concern which (Anwar) thought was absent in the past\".\n\n\nRoyal pardon and release\nAfter the Pakatan Rakyat's dissolution during his imprisonment, a new opposition coalition named the Pakatan Harapan was formed with Anwar as the de facto leader in absentia The coalition had come into power by overthrowing Barisan Nasional in the 2018 general election (GE14) Following the formation of the new ruling government, Anwar was given a full royal pardon and was released from prison on 16 May 2018 He was designated to take over the reins from interim Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad as planned and agreed by the coalition before GE14 [121] [122] In an interview, he justified his reluctance to immediately step into power on the basis that Mahathir appeared committed to the reform agenda, and was doing a good job tackling a \"disintegrating\" political system He also added that he was keen to travel and honour speaking engagements [123] Anwar also indicated that he initially had reservations about Mahathir's \"reconciliation efforts\", but he eventually forgave his former enemy after Mahathir showed \"compassion and concern which (Anwar) thought was absent in the past\".\n\n\nReturn to parliament\nAnwar returned to Parliament through the Port Dickson by-election on 13 October 2018, [124] after receiving a royal pardon for a sodomy conviction he maintained was politically motivated He won the by-election with an increased majority, returning to Parliament for the first time in three years [125] The seat had been vacated by army veteran Danyal Balagopal Abdullah, a member of parliament for Anwar's PKR [126]\n\n\nSheraton Move and return to opposition\nIn late February 2020, the Pakatan Harapan government collapsed following defections by Anwar's deputy, Azmin Ali, and several MPs aligned to him, along with the withdrawal of BERSATU by Muhyiddin Yassin from the coalition Mahathir promptly resigned from government, as well as from BERSATU The political manoeuvring has been labelled the \"Sheraton Move\" for the hotel in Petaling Jaya at which defecting MPs gathered with the opposition to show support for a new government [127] Following the resignation of Mahathir, Anwar attempted to gather support for his appointment as prime minister However, BERSATU president, Muhyiddin Yassin, was eventually appointed prime minister, with the support of a slender majority in the Dewan Rakyat [128] Thus, Pakatan Harapan returned to the opposition, with Anwar being named leader of the opposition [129]\n\n\nSecond term as Leader of the Opposition (2020–2022)\nWhile Muhyiddin formed a government under the auspices of a new coalition known as Perikatan Nasional, Mahathir attempted to regain his post with his Pakatan allies However, under Anwar's leadership, KEADILAN refused to endorse Mahathir's bid for a third term as premier, claiming the nonagenarian had reneged on his repeated pledge to hand over the office to Anwar [130] Mahathir, in turn, refused to lend support to Anwar's candidacy, and nominated Sabah Chief Minister, Shafie Apdal, for the position of prime minister instead Despite the support of allies DAP and Amanah for this compromise, KEADILAN again rejected the proposal and continued to propose Anwar as the coalition's candidate [131]\n\n\nCollaboration with UMNO\nIn September 2020, Anwar attempted to form a new government, claiming that he had amassed a \"formidable\" majority, [132] and submitted the number of 120 members of parliament to the then-Yang di-Pertuan Agong, Abdullah of Pahang [133] However, this move failed and Anwar, speaking at a party congress in July 2022, claimed that he had been forced to back down after refusing to provide assurances to Barisan Nasional and UMNO leaders that he would discontinue their court cases [134] Zahid had previously admitted to writing a statutory declaration alongside Najib supporting Anwar for the position as prime minister in October 2020 [135]\n\n\n2022 general election\nAt a pre-election Pakatan Harapan convention, the coalition officially announced Anwar Ibrahim as the coalition's candidate for prime minister in the 2022 general election [139] Anwar announced he would be contesting the Tambun parliamentary seat in the 2022 general election and that if he became prime minister, he would form a smaller cabinet and reduce cabinet ministers' salaries [140] The decision to contest in Tambun, where an easy victory was not expected, was motivated by the fact its incumbent member of parliament at the time was former chief minister of Perak and BERSATU member Ahmad Faizal Azumu, who had followed his party into the opposing Perikatan Nasional coalition during the Sheraton Move For this, he was labelled a \"traitor\" by the Pakaran Harapan coalition [141]\n\n\nPrime Minister (2022–present)\nAnwar announced his cabinet on 2 December 2022, appointing himself as the Minister of Finance He also appointed President of UMNO Ahmad Zahid Hamidi and the Parliamentary Whip of Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS) Fadillah Yusof as the Deputy Prime Ministers This marked the first time Malaysia had two deputy prime ministers in office concurrently Zahid's appointment was controversial due to his ongoing trials for money laundering, bribery and criminal breach of trust [158] [159] The Straits Times of Singapore has referred to the Anwar cabinet as a \"kleptocrat\" cabinet as a result [160] On December 12 2023, Anwar carried out the first cabinet reshuffle, appointing five new ministers and deputy ministers respectively \n\n\nCabinet appointments\nAnwar announced his cabinet on 2 December 2022, appointing himself as the Minister of Finance He also appointed President of UMNO Ahmad Zahid Hamidi and the Parliamentary

2022. He was born on August 10, 1947, in Cherok Tok Kun, Bukit Mertajam, in the Crown Colony of Penang. Anwar's father, Ibrahim bin Abdul Rahman, was a hospital porter who later joined politics as a member of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO).\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nAnwar was born into a Malay family in Penang, Malaysia. His father, Ibrahim, was a hospital porter who later joined politics as a member of UMNO. Anwar's mother, Che Yan binti Hussein, was a housewife who was active in UMNO grassroots politics in Penang. Anwar has five siblings, and his family was known for their strong political involvement.\n\nAnwar attended the National Higher School in Penang and later pursued his tertiary education at the University of Malaya, where he graduated with a degree in Malay Studies in 1971. During his time at the university, Anwar was involved in various student organizations and became the president of the National Union of Malaysian Muslim Students.\n\n**Early Years and Activism (1968-1982)**\n\nAnwar's involvement in student politics began in 1968, when he became the president of the National Union of Malaysian Muslim Students. He was also the president of the University of Malaya Malay Language Society (PBMUM). In 1971, Anwar was a member of the pro tem committee of Angkatan Belia Islam Malaysia (ABIM), a Muslim youth movement in Malaysia. He later became the 2nd President of the Malaysian Youth Council, a position he held from 1971 to 1974.\n\nAnwar's activism during this period focused on issues related to rural poverty, hunger, and education. He was involved in several student protests, including a notable protest against rural poverty in 1974. During this protest, a family died from starvation in a village in Baling, Kedah, which led to Anwar's arrest under the Internal Security Act (ISA).\n\n**Deputy Prime Minister (1993-1998)**\n\nAnwar became a member of UMNO in 1982 and quickly rose through the ranks. In 1993, he became the Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia, a position he held until his dismissal in 1998. As Deputy Prime Minister, Anwar was known for his efforts to reform the Malaysian economy and improve the country's human rights record.\n\nAnwar's decision to join UMNO was influenced by the advice of Palestinian-American scholar Ismail al-Faruqi, who recognized the Mahathir administration's commitment to its Islamization agenda. Anwar's allusions in public to his \"son-father\" relationship with Mahathir contributed to the view that he was to be Mahathir's successor.\n\n**Financial Crisis and Fall from Power**\n\nDuring the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, Anwar supported the IMF plan as a finance minister. He also instituted an austerity package that cut government spending by 18%, cut ministerial salaries, and deferred major projects. Despite being a cornerstone of Mahathir's development strategy, \"mega projects\" were greatly curtailed.\n\nIn 1998, matters between Anwar and Mahathir came to a head around the quadrennial UMNO General Assembly. A book by Khalid Jafri, \"50 Dalil Kenapa Anwar Tidak Boleh Jadi PM\" (\"50 Reasons Why Anwar Cannot Become Prime Minister\"), was circulated containing graphic allegations of homosexuality, as well as accusations of corruption against Anwar. Anwar obtained a court injunction to prevent further distribution of the book and filed a lawsuit against the author for defamation.\n\n**Reformasi and Formation of KEADILAN (1998-1999)**\n\nShortly after Anwar was dismissed as Deputy Prime Minister, Anwar and his supporters initiated the Reformasi movement. The movement consisted of several mass demonstrations and rallies against the long-standing Barisan Nasional coalition government.\n\nIn 1999, Anwar brought suit against Prime Minister Mahathir for defamation for allegedly uttering accusations of immoral acts and calling Anwar a homosexual at a news conference in Malaysia.\n\n**Teaching and Non-Profit Work**\n\nAfter his release from prison, Anwar held teaching positions at St Antony's College, Oxford, where he was a visiting fellow and senior associate member. He also held positions at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, D.C., as a Distinguished Senior Visiting Fellow, and at Georgetown University's Prince Alwaleed Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding in the School of Foreign Service.\n\n**Return to Politics**\n\nIn November 2006, Anwar announced he planned to run for Parliament in 2008 after his disqualification expired.

He condemned the Malaysian government for seeking advice from APCO and claimed that the firm is linked to the \"murder of Muslims in Palestine.\"\n\n**Attempts to Form a Majority Coalition**\n\nAnwar has missed several deadlines he personally set for the transfer of power. In 2013, Anwar led his Pakatan Rakyat coalition to contest in the general election, but lost to the Barisan Nasional coalition.\n\n**Pakatan Harapan Backbencher (2018-2020)**\n\nAfter the Pakatan Rakyat's dissolution during his imprisonment, a new opposition coalition named the Pakatan Harapan was formed with Anwar as the de facto leader in absentia. The coalition had come into power by overthrowing Barisan Nasional in the 2018 general election.\n\n**Royal Pardon and Release**\n\nAnwar was given a full royal pardon and was released from prison on May 16, 2018. He was designated to take over the reins from interim Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad as planned and agreed by the coalition before GE14.\n\n**Return to Parliament**\n\nAnwar returned to Parliament through the Port Dickson by-election on October 13, 2018, after receiving a royal pardon for a sodomy conviction he maintained was politically motivated.\n\n**Sheraton Move and Return to Opposition**\n\nIn February 2020, the Pakatan Harapan government collapsed following defections by Anwar's deputy, Azmin Ali, and several MPs aligned to him, along with the withdrawal of BERSATU by Muhyiddin Yassin from the coalition. The political manoeuvring has been labelled the \"Sheraton Move\" for the hotel in Petaling Jaya at which defecting MPs gathered with the opposition to show support for a new government.\n\n**Second Term as Leader of the Opposition (2020-2022)**\n\nWhile Muhyiddin formed a government under the auspices of a new coalition known as Perikatan Nasional, Mahathir attempted to regain his post with his Pakatan allies. However, under Anwar's leadership, KEADILAN refused to endorse Mahathir's bid for a third term as premier, claiming the nonagenarian had reneged on his repeated pledge to hand over the office to Anwar.\n\n**Prime Minister (2022-present)**\n\nAnwar announced his cabinet on December 2, 2022, appointing himself as the Minister of Finance. He also appointed President of UMNO Ahmad Zahid Hamidi and the Parliamentary Whip of Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS) Fadillah Yusof as the Deputy Prime Ministers.

he would form a smaller cabinet and reduce cabinet ministers' salaries [140] The decision to contest in Tambun, where an easy victory was not expected, was motivated by the fact its incumbent member of parliament at the time was former chief minister of Perak and BERSATU member Ahmad Faizal Azumu, who had followed his party into the opposing Perikatan Nasional coalition during the Sheraton Move

response to claims that his government had \"abandoned Islam\" [162] He refuted claims that he was displaying a \"strong Islamist attitude\", arguing that the broadening of JAKIM's responsibilities is

event included four matches that resulted from scripted storylines Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, [16] [17] while storylines were played out on WWE's weekly television shows, Monday Night Raw and Friday Night SmackDown [18]\n\n\nEvent\nThe event opened with the Women's Royal Rumble match The first two entrants were Natalya from Raw, who continued her streak of being in every Women's Rumble, and Naomi, who returned to WWE after walking out of the company in May 2022 and after performing in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) the preceding few months She was followed by SmackDown's Bayley at number three TNA Knockouts World Champion Jordynne Grace entered at number five as a surprise entrant, and briefly reignited her feud with Naomi, who she defeated in Naomi's final TNA match for the title Past Women's Rumble winners Asuka (2018) and Bianca Belair (2021), both from SmackDown, later entered at numbers seven and 10, respectively As the ring filled up, Raw's Nia Jax entered at number 19 and went on a run of eliminations 2019 winner Becky Lynch from Raw entered at number 21 As Raw's Valhalla was making her entrance as the 24th

eliminated eighth entrant Karrion Kross also from SmackDown, but Kross' Final Testament stablemates Authors of Pain (Akam and Rezar) stormed the ring, leading to Kross coming back in to eliminate Lashley, resulting in a ringside brawl between the Final Testament, Lashley, and his associates The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) As the ring filled up, 2023 Rumble winner Cody Rhodes from Raw entered at number 15 NXT's Bron Breakker made his Rumble debut at number 20, and scored several rapid eliminations Omos was next at number 21, followed by surprise entrant Pat McAfee (#22), who had earlier made a surprise return as a commentator for the event After coming face to face with the over seven foot tall Omos, McAfee backed away and eliminated himself by climbing over

press conference, Cody Rhodes, who won the men's Royal Rumble as a Raw wrestler, seemingly made his decision of which world championship he would challenge for at WrestleMania XL He stated that while

Universal Championship, as he failed to do so at WrestleMania 39 the previous year [27] However, on the following episode of Raw, Rollins explained why Rhodes should instead challenge him at WrestleMania, stating that the title Reigns held lost its luster due to Reigns defending it so infrequently, and the shady reputations of other past champions, while Rollins made his title representative of the blue collar, workhorse style that Cody's father Dusty Rhodes embodied A conflicted Rhodes said he would think about it [28] Rhodes then appeared on SmackDown and confronted Reigns and said that he would eventually win Reigns' title, but not at WrestleMania [29] The Rock then came out and stared down Reigns in the ring as the episode went off the air, seemingly challenging for Reigns' title at WrestleMania, which has since drawn intense fan backlash [30] [31] However, during the WrestleMania XL Kickoff event on February 8, Rhodes announced that he had in

to accept the Electoral College votes [39]\n\n\nFormer staff and focus on media attention\nMany former Congressional staffers for Mace have described her approach to her office as focused on gaining media attention Her staffers have attributed many of her political actions, such as her vote against McCarthy, to a desire to make headlines and appear on TV programs Staffers recalled her attempting to attract attention to herself during the January 6 Capitol attack by risking her own safety and seeking to be assaulted by rioters Legislative staffers for Mace described her efforts to attract media attention as hampering her legislative agenda and working relationships with other members of Congress [48] [57]\n\n\nRedistricting\nSouth Carolina redrew its congressional map after the 2020 census showed significant population changes between districts A three-judge federal panel ruled in 2023 that Mace's congressional District 1 was redrawn in a \"stark racial gerrymander\" intended to suppress the power of Black voters [59] The redistricting moved 62% of Black Charleston County voters (a total of 30,000) from Mace's District 1 to District 6, represented by Jim Clyburn, a Black Democrat who has held the seat for 30 years, and moved inland white voters into Mace's District 1 [60]\n\n\nCongressional oversight\nAs Chairwoman of the House Subcommittee on Cybersecurity,

Mace faced Mount Pleasant City Councilwoman Kathy Landing and Bikers for Trump founder Chris Cox in the June 9 Republican primary.

The redistricting moved 62% of Black Charleston County voters (a total of 30,000) from Mace's District 1 to District 6, represented by Jim Clyburn, a Black Democrat who has held the seat for 30 years, and moved inland white voters into Mace's District 1.\n\n**Congressional Oversight**\n\nAs Chairwoman of the House Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation, Mace has led congressional hearings on UAPs (also known as UFOs) and government transparency.

Mace has voiced support for gestational limits of 15 to 20 weeks.\n\n**LGBTQ Rights**\n\nIn 2021, the Washington Examiner wrote that Mace \"is a supporter of both religious liberty and gay marriage.\" Later that year, she told the Examiner, \"I strongly support LGBTQ rights and equality. No one should be discriminated against.\" She opposed the Equality Act, instead co-sponsoring a Republican alternative called the Fairness for All Act.\n\n**Washington, D.C. Statehood**\n\nIn April 2021, Mace voiced her opposition to a Democratic proposal to grant the District of Columbia statehood. She argued that Washington, D.C was too small to qualify as a state, saying, \"D.C wouldn't even qualify as a singular congressional district.\"\n\n**Debt Ceiling**\n\nOn May 31, 2023, Mace was among 71 House Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 to raise the debt ceiling.

After saying \"Kamala\" correctly, Mace began to mispronounce the name and, when corrected by other CNN panelists, Mace claimed \"I will say Kamala's name any way that I want to.\"\n\n**Kevin McCarthy**\n\nMace was one of eight Republicans that voted for the removal of Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House and the only one of those eight not considered a far-right politician by a 538 analysis of the 118th Congress.

{"title": "Diana_Spencer", "content": "\nEarly life\nDiana Frances Spencer was born on 1 July 1961, the fourth of five children of John Spencer, Viscount Althorp (1924–1992), and Frances Spencer, Viscountess Althorp (née Roche; 1936–2004) [2] She was delivered at Park House, Sandringham, Norfolk [3] The Spencer family had been closely allied with the British royal family for several generations; [4] her grandmothers, Cynthia Spencer, Countess Spencer, and Ruth Roche, Baroness Fermoy, had served as ladies-in-waiting to Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother [5] Her parents were hoping for a boy to carry on the family line, and no name was chosen for a week until they settled on Diana Frances after her mother and Lady Diana Spencer, a many-times-great-aunt who was also a prospective Princess of Wales as a potential bride for Frederick, Prince of Wales [6] Within the family, she was also known informally as \"Duch\", a reference to her duchess-like attitude in childhood [7]\n\n\nEducation and career\nDiana was initially home-schooled under the supervision of her governess, Gertrude Allen [21] She began her formal education at Silfield Private School in King's Lynn, Norfolk, and moved to Riddlesworth Hall School, an all-girls boarding school near Thetford, when she was nine [22] She joined her sisters at West Heath Girls' School in Sevenoaks, Kent, in 1973 [23] She did not perform well academically, failing her O-levels twice [24] [25] Her outstanding community spirit was recognised with an award from West Heath [26] She left West Heath when she was sixteen [27] Her brother Charles recalls her as being quite shy up until that time [28] She demonstrated musical ability as a skilled pianist [26] She also excelled in swimming and diving, and studied ballet and tap dance [29]\n\n\nPersonal life\nDiana first met Charles, Prince of Wales, the Queen's eldest son and heir apparent, when she was 16 in November 1977 He was then 29 and dating her older sister, Sarah [39] [40] Charles and Diana were guests at a country weekend during the summer of 1980 and he took a serious interest in her as a potential bride [41] The relationship progressed when he invited her aboard the royal yacht Britannia for a sailing weekend to Cowes This was followed by an invitation to Balmoral Castle (the royal family's Scottish residence) to meet his family [42] [43] She was well received by the Queen, the Queen Mother and the Duke of Edinburgh Charles subsequently courted Diana in London He proposed on 6 February 1981 at Windsor Castle, and she accepted, but their engagement was kept secret for two and a half weeks [38]\n\n\nEngagement and wedding\nTheir engagement became official on 24 February 1981 [21] Diana selected her own engagement ring [21] Following the engagement, she left her occupation as a nursery teacher's assistant and temporarily lived at the Queen Mother's residence, Clarence House [44] She subsequently resided at Buckingham Palace until the wedding, [44] where, according to the biographer Ingrid Seward, her life was \"incredibly lonely\" [45] Diana was the first Englishwoman to marry the first in line to the throne since Anne Hyde married James, Duke of York and Albany (later James VII and II), over 300 years earlier, and she was also the first royal bride to have a paying job before her engagement [21] [26] Diana's first public appearance with Charles was at a charity ball held at Goldsmiths' Hall in March 1981, where she was introduced to Princess Grace of Monaco [44]\n\n\nChildren\nThe couple had residences at Kensington Palace and Highgrove House, near Tetbury On 5 November 1981, Diana's pregnancy was announced [53] In January 1982—12 weeks into the pregnancy—Diana fell down a staircase at Sandringham, suffering some bruising, and the royal gynaecologist George Pinker was summoned from London; the foetus was uninjured [54] Diana later confessed that she had intentionally thrown herself down the stairs because she was feeling \"so inadequate\" [55] On 21 June 1982, she gave birth to the couple's first son, Prince William [56] She subsequently suffered from postpartum depression after her first pregnancy [57] Amidst some media criticism, she decided to take William—who was still a baby—on her first major tours of Australia and New Zealand, and the decision was popularly applauded By her own admission, Diana had not initially intended to take William until Malcolm Fraser, the Australian prime minister, made the suggestion [58]\n\n\nProblems and separation\nFive years into the marriage, the couple's incompatibility and age difference became visible and damaging [66] In 1986, Diana began a relationship with James Hewitt, the family's former riding instructor and in the same year, Charles resumed his relationship with his former girlfriend Camilla Parker Bowles The media speculated that Hewitt, not Charles, was Harry's father based on the alleged physical similarity between Hewitt and Harry, but Hewitt and others have denied this Harry was born two years before Hewitt and Diana began their affair [60] [67]\n\n\nDivorce\nThe journalist Martin Bashir interviewed Diana for the BBC current affairs show Panorama The interview was broadcast on 20 November 1995 [117] Diana discussed her own and her husband's extramarital affairs [118] Referring to Charles's relationship with Parker Bowles, she said: \"Well, there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded.\" She also expressed doubt about her husband's suitability for kingship [117] The authors Tina Brown, Sally Bedell Smith, and Sarah Bradford support Diana's admission in the interview that she had suffered from depression, bulimia and had engaged numerous times in the act of self-harm; the show's transcript records Diana confirming many of her mental health problems [117] The combination of illnesses from which Diana herself said she suffered resulted in some of her biographers opining that she had borderline personality disorder [119] [120] It was later revealed that Bashir had used forged bank statements to win Diana and her brother's trust to secure the interview, falsely indicating people close to her had been paid for spying [121] Lord Dyson conducted an independent inquiry into the issue and concluded that Bashir had \"little difficulty in playing on  [Diana's] fears and paranoia\", a sentiment that was shared by Diana's son William [122] [123]\n\n\nPost-divorce\nAfter her divorce, Diana retained the double apartment on the north side of Kensington Palace that she had shared with Charles since the first year of their marriage; the apartment remained her home until her death the following year She also moved her offices to Kensington Palace but was permitted \"to use the state apartments at St James's Palace\" [128] [142] In a book published in 2003, Paul Burrell claimed Diana's private letters had revealed that her brother, Lord Spencer, had refused to allow her to live at Althorp, despite her request [130] The allegations were proven to be untrue as Spencer received legal apologies from different newspapers, including The Times in 2021, which admitted that \"having considered his sister's safety, and in line with police advice, the Earl offered the Princess of Wales a number of properties including Wormleighton Manor, the Spencer family's original ancestral home\" [143] However, he could not offer Garden House cottage on the Althorp estate to Diana as the home was intended for a member of staff [143]\n\n\nPrincess of Wales\nFollowing her engagement to Charles, Diana made her first official public appearance in March 1981 in a charity event at Goldsmiths' Hall [172] [173] She attended the Trooping the Colour for the first time in June 1981, making her appearance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace afterwards In October 1981, Charles and Diana visited Wales [26] [174] She attended the State Opening of Parliament for the first time on 4 November 1981 [175] Her first solo engagement was a visit to Regent Street on 18 November 1981 to switch on the Christmas lights [176] Diana made her inaugural overseas tour in September 1982, to attend the funeral of Princess Grace of Monaco [26] Also in 1982, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands created Diana a Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown [177] In 1983, Diana accompanied Charles and William on a tour of Australia and New Zealand The tour was a success and the couple drew immense crowds, though the press focused more on Diana rather than Charles, coining the term 'Dianamania' as a reference to people's obsession with her [178] While sitting in a car with Charles near the Sydney Opera House, Diana burst into tears for a few minutes, which their office stated was due to jet lag and the heat [179] In New Zealand, the couple met with representatives of the Māori people [26] Their visit to Canada in June and July 1983 included a trip to Edmonton to open the 1983 Summer Universiade and a stop in Newfoundland to commemorate the 400th anniversary of that island's acquisition by the Crown [180] In 1983, she was targeted by the Scottish National Liberation Army who tried to deliver a letter bomb to her [181]\n\n\nCharity work and patronages\nIn 1983 Diana confided to the premier of Newfoundland, Brian Peckford, \"I am finding it very difficult to cope with the pressures of being Princess of Wales, but I am learning to cope with it\" [208] She was expected to make regular public appearances at hospitals, schools, and other facilities, in the 20th-century model of royal patronage From the mid-1980s, she became increasingly associated with numerous charities She carried out 191 official engagements in 1988 [209] and 397 in 1991 [210] Diana developed an intense interest in serious illnesses and health-related matters outside the purview of traditional royal involvement, including AIDS and leprosy In recognition of her effect as a philanthropist, Stephen Lee, director of the UK Institute of Charity Fundraising Managers, said \"Her overall effect on charity is probably more significant than any other person's in the 20th century.\" [211]\n\n\nHIV/AIDS\nDiana began her work with AIDS patients in the 1980s [236] Contrary to the prevailing stigmatization of AIDS patients, she was not averse to making physical contact with patients, [195] and was the first British royal to do so [236] In 1987, she held hands with an AIDS patient in one of her early efforts to destigmatise the condition [237] [238] Diana noted: \"HIV does not make people dangerous to know You can shake their hands and give them a hug Heaven knows they need it What's more, you can share their homes, their workplaces, and their playgrounds and toys\" [189] To Diana's disappointment, the Queen did not support this type of charity work, suggesting she get involved in \"something more pleasant\" [236] In July 1989, she opened Landmark Aids Centre in South London [239] [240] In October 1990, Diana opened Grandma's House, a home for young AIDS patients in Washington, DC [241] She was also a patron of the National AIDS Trust and regularly visited London Lighthouse, which provided residential care for HIV patients (it has since merged with the Terrence Higgins Trust) [189] [242] In 1991, she hugged one patient during a visit to the AIDS ward of the Middlesex Hospital, [189] which she had opened in 1987 as the first hospital unit dedicated to this cause in the UK [237] [243] As the patron of Turning Point, a health and social care organisation, Diana visited its project in London for people with HIV/AIDS in 1992 [244] She later established and led fundraising campaigns for AIDS research [21]\n\n\nLandmines\nDiana was patron of the HALO Trust, an organisation that removes debris—particularly landmines—left behind by war [249] [250] In January 1997, pictures of Diana touring an Angolan minefield in a ballistic helmet and flak jacket were seen worldwide [249] [250] During her campaign, she was accused of meddling in politics and called a \"loose cannon\" by Lord Howe, an official in the British Ministry of Defence [251] Despite the criticism, HALO states that Diana's efforts resulted in raising international awareness about landmines and the subsequent sufferings caused by them [249] [250] In June 1997, she gave a speech at a landmines conference held at the Royal Geographical Society, and went to Washington, DC to support the American Red Cross's anti-landmine initiative [26] From 7 to 10 August 1997, just days before her death, she visited Bosnia and Herzegovina with Jerry White and Ken Rutherford of the Landmine Survivors Network [26] [252] [253] [254]\n\n\nCancer\nFor her first solo official trip, Diana visited The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, a cancer treatment hospital in London [222] She later chose this charity to be among the organisations that benefited from the auction of her clothes in New York [222] The trust's communications manager said she did \"much to remove the stigma and taboo associated with diseases such as cancer, AIDS, HIV and leprosy\" [222] Diana became president of the hospital on 27 June 1989 [258] [259] [260] The Wolfson Children's Cancer Unit was opened by Diana on 25 February 1993 [258] In February 1996, Diana, who had been informed about a newly opened cancer hospital built by Imran Khan, travelled to Pakistan to visit its children's cancer wards and attend a fundraising dinner in aid of the charity in Lahore [261] She later visited the hospital again in May 1997 [262] In June 1996, she travelled to Chicago in her capacity as president of the Royal Marsden Hospital in order to attend a fundraising event at the Field Museum of Natural History and raised more than £1 million for cancer research [189] She additionally visited patients at the Cook County Hospital and delivered remarks at a conference on breast cancer at the Northwestern University Chicago campus after meeting a group of breast cancer researchers [263] In September 1996, after being asked by Katharine Graham, Diana went to Washington and appeared at a White House breakfast in respect of the Nina Hyde Center for Breast Cancer Research [264] She also attended an annual fund-raiser for breast cancer research organised by The Washington Post at the same centre [21] [265]\n\n\nOther areas\nIn November 1989, Diana visited a leprosy hospital in Indonesia [269] [236] Following her visit, she became patron of the Leprosy Mission, an organisation dedicated to providing medicine, treatment, and other support services to those who are afflicted with the disease She remained the patron of this charity [231] and visited several of its hospitals around the world, especially in India, Nepal, Zimbabwe and Nigeria until her death in 1997 [189] [270] She touched those affected by the disease when many people believed it could be contracted through casual contact [189] [269] \"It has always been my concern to touch people with leprosy, trying to show in a simple action that they are not reviled, nor are we repulsed\", she commented [270] The Diana Princess of Wales Health Education and Media Centre in Noida, India, was opened in her honour in November 1999, funded by the Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Fund to give social support to the people affected by leprosy and disability [270]\n\n\nPrivacy and legal issues\nIn November 1980, the Sunday Mirror ran a story claiming that Charles had used the Royal Train twice for secret love rendezvous with Diana, prompting the palace to issue a statement, calling the story \"a total fabrication\" and demanding an apology [277] [278] The newspaper editors, however, insisted that the woman boarding the train was Diana and declined to apologise [277] In February 1982, pictures of a pregnant Diana in bikini while holidaying were published in the media The Queen subsequently released a statement and called it \"the blackest day in the history of British journalism.\" [279]\n\n\nDeath\nDiana died on 31 August 1997 in a car crash in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in Paris while her driver was fleeing the paparazzi [286] The crash also resulted in the deaths of her companion Dodi Fayed and their driver, Henri Paul, who was also the acting security manager of Hôtel Ritz Paris Trevor Rees-Jones, who was employed as a bodyguard by Dodi's father, [287] survived the crash, suffering a serious head injury The televised funeral, on 6 September, was watched by a British television audience that peaked at 32.1 million, which was one of the United Kingdom's highest viewing figures ever and a United States television audience that peaked at 50 million [288] [289] The event was broadcast to over 200 countries and was seen by an estimated 2.5 billion people [290] [291]\n\n\nTribute, funeral, and burial\nThe sudden and unexpected death of an extraordinarily popular royal figure brought statements from senior figures worldwide and many tributes by members of the public [292] [293] [294] People left flowers, candles, cards, and personal messages outside Kensington Palace for many months Diana's coffin, draped with the royal flag, was brought to London from Paris by Charles and her two sisters on 31 August 1997 [295] [296] The coffin was taken to a private mortuary and then placed in the Chapel Royal, St James's Palace [295]\n\n\nConspiracy theories, inquest and verdict\nThe initial French judicial investigation concluded that the crash was caused by Paul's intoxication, reckless driving, speeding, and effects of prescription drugs [304] In February 1998, Mohamed Al-Fayed, father of Dodi Fayed, publicly said the crash, which killed his son, had been planned, [305] and accused MI6 and the Duke of Edinburgh [306] An inquest, which started in London in 2004 and continued in 2007 and 2008, [307] attributed the crash to grossly negligent driving by Paul and to the pursuing paparazzi, who forced Paul to speed into the tunnel [308] On 7 April 2008, the jury returned a verdict of \"unlawful killing\" On the day after the final verdict of the inquest, Al-Fayed announced that he would end his 10-year campaign to establish that the tragedy was murder; he said he did so for the sake of Diana's children [309]\n\n\nLater events\nFollowing her death, Diana left a £21 million estate, \"netting £17 million after estate taxes\", which were left in the hands of trustees, her mother, and her sister Sarah [310] [311] The will was signed in June 1993, but Diana had it modified in February 1996 to remove the name of her personal secretary from the list of trustees and have Sarah replace him [312] After applying personal and inheritance taxes, a net estate of £12.9 million was left to be distributed among the beneficiaries [313] Her two sons subsequently inherited the majority of her estate Each of them was left with £6.5 million which was invested and gathered substantial interest, and an estimated £10 million was given to each son upon turning 30 years old in 2012 and 2014 respectively [314] [315] Many of Diana's possessions were initially left in the care of her brother, who put them on show in Althorp twice a year until they were returned to Diana's sons [314] [310] They were also put on display in American museums and as of 2011 [update] raised two million dollars for charities [310] Among the objects were her dresses and suits along with numerous family paintings and jewels [314] Diana's engagement ring and her yellow gold watch were given to William and Harry, respectively William later passed the ring to his wife, Catherine Middleton Her wedding dress was also given to her sons [314] [316] [317]\n\n\nFinances\nFollowing her death, Diana left a £21 million estate, \"netting £17 million after estate taxes\", which were left in the hands of trustees, her mother, and her sister Sarah [310] [311] The will was signed in June 1993, but Diana had it modified in February 1996 to remove the name of her personal secretary from the list of trustees and have Sarah replace him [312] After applying personal and inheritance taxes, a net estate of £12.9 million was left to be distributed among the beneficiaries [313] Her two sons subsequently inherited the majority of her estate Each of them was left with £6.5 million which was invested and gathered substantial interest, and an estimated £10 million was given to each son upon turning 30 years old in 2012 and 2014 respectively [314] [315] Many of Diana's possessions were initially left in the care of her brother, who put them on show in Althorp twice a year until they were returned to Diana's sons [314] [310] They were also put on display in American museums and as of 2011 [update] raised two million dollars for charities [310] Among the objects were her dresses and suits along with numerous family paintings and jewels [314] Diana's engagement ring and her yellow gold watch were given to William and Harry, respectively William later passed the ring to his wife, Catherine Middleton Her wedding dress was also given to her sons [314] [316] [317]\n\n\nSubject of US government surveillance\nIn 1999, after the submission of a Freedom of Information request by the Internet news service apbonline.com, it was revealed that Diana had been placed under surveillance by the National Security Agency until her death, and the organisation kept a top secret file on her containing more than 1,000 pages [318] [319] The contents of Diana's NSA file cannot be disclosed because of national security concerns [318] The NSA officials insisted Diana was not a \"target of  [their] massive, worldwide electronic eavesdropping infrastructure.\" [318] Despite multiple inquiries for the files to be declassified—with one of the notable ones being filed by Mohamed Al-Fayed—the NSA has refused to release the documents [319]\n\n\nAnniversaries, commemorations, and auctions\nOn the first anniversary of Diana's death, people left flowers and bouquets outside the gates of Kensington Palace and a memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey [321] [322] The royal family and Tony Blair and his family went to Crathie Kirk for private prayers, while Diana's family held a private memorial service at Althorp [323] [324] All flags at Buckingham Palace and other royal residences were flown at half-mast on the Queen's orders [325] The Union Jack was first lowered to half-mast on the day of Diana's funeral and has set a precedent, as based on the previous protocol no flag could ever fly at half-mast over the palace \"even on the death of a monarch\" [325] Since 1997, however, the Union Flag (but not the Royal Standard) has flown at half-mast upon the deaths of members of the royal family, and other times of national mourning [326]\n\n\nLegacy\nDiana remains one of the most popular members of the royal family throughout history, and she continues to influence the younger generations of royals [343] [344] [345] She was a major presence on the world stage from her engagement to Charles until her death, and was often described as the \"world's most photographed woman\" [21] [346] She was noted for her compassion, style, charisma, and high-profile charity work, as well as her ill-fated marriage [347] [211] [348] Biographer Sarah Bradford commented, \"The only cure for her suffering would have been the love of the Prince of Wales .. the way in which he consistently denigrated her reduced her to despair.\" [99] Despite all the marital issues and scandals, Diana continued to enjoy a high level of popularity in the polls while her husband was suffering from low levels of public approval [21] Diana's former private secretary Patrick Jephson described her as an organised and hardworking person, and pointed out Charles was not able to \"reconcile with his wife's extraordinary popularity\", [349] a viewpoint supported by the biographer Tina Brown [350] He also said she was a tough boss who was \"equally quick to appreciate hard work\" but could also be defiant \"if she felt she had been the victim of injustice\" [349] Diana's mother also defined her as a \"loving\" figure who could occasionally be \"tempestuous\" [162] She was often described as a devoted mother to her children, [21] [351] who are believed to be influenced by her personality and way of life [352]\n\n\nPublic image\nDiana remains one of the most popular

devoted mother to her children, [21] [351] who are believed to be influenced by her personality and way of life [352]\n\n\nFashion and style\nDiana was a fashion icon whose style was emulated by women around the world In 2012, Time included Diana on its All-Time 100 Fashion Icons list [376] Iain Hollingshead of The Telegraph wrote: \" [Diana] had an ability to sell clothes just by looking at them.\" [377] [378] An early example of the effect occurred during her courtship with Charles in 1980 when sales of Hunter Wellington boots skyrocketed after she was pictured wearing a pair on the Balmoral estate [377] [379] According to designers and people who worked with Diana, she used fashion and style to endorse her charitable causes, express herself and communicate [380] [381] [382] Diana remains a prominent figure for her fashion style, impacting recent cultural and style trends [383] [384] [336] [385]\n\n\nMemorials\nPermanent memorials to Diana include the Diana, Princess of

German-speaking country [409] The Flame of Liberty was erected in 1989 on the Place de l'Alma in Paris above the entrance to the tunnel in which the fatal crash later occurred It became an unofficial memorial to Diana [410] [411] The Place de l'Alma was renamed Place Diana princesse de Galles in 2019 [412] Following her death, several countries issued postage stamps commemorating Diana, including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Somalia, and Congo [413] [414] [415] A bronze plaque was unveiled by Earl Spencer at Northampton Guildhall in 2002 as a memorial to his sister [416]\n\n\nIn popular culture and art\nBefore and after her death, Diana has been the subject of films and television series and depicted in contemporary art The first biopics about Diana and Charles were Charles & Diana: A Royal Love Story and The Royal Romance of Charles and Diana that were broadcast on American TV channels on 17 and 20 September 1981, respectively [423] In December 1992, ABC aired Charles and Diana: Unhappily Ever After, a TV movie about marital discord between Diana and Charles [424] Actresses who have portrayed Diana include Serena Scott Thomas (in Diana: Her True Story, 1993), [425] Julie Cox (in

of Wales\n\n## Early Life\n\nDiana Frances Spencer was born on 1 July 1961, the fourth of five children of John Spencer, Viscount Althorp (1924–1992), and Frances Spencer, Viscountess Althorp (née Roche; 1936–2004). She was delivered at Park House, Sandringham, Norfolk. The Spencer family had been closely allied with the British royal family for several generations; her grandmothers, Cynthia Spencer, Countess Spencer, and Ruth Roche, Baroness Fermoy, had served as ladies-in-waiting to Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. Her parents were hoping for a boy to carry on the family line, and no name was chosen for a week until they settled on Diana Frances after her mother and Lady Diana Spencer, a many-times-great-aunt who was also a prospective Princess of Wales as a potential bride for Frederick, Prince of Wales.\n\n## Education and Career\n\nInitially, Diana was home-schooled under the supervision of her governess, Gertrude Allen. She began her formal education at Silfield Private School in King's Lynn, Norfolk, and moved to Riddlesworth Hall School, an all-girls boarding school near Thetford, when she was nine. She joined her sisters at West Heath Girls' School in Sevenoaks, Kent, in 1973. She did not perform well academically, failing her O-levels twice. Her outstanding community spirit was recognised with an award from West Heath. She left West Heath when she was sixteen. Her brother Charles recalls her as being quite shy up until that time. She demonstrated musical ability as a skilled pianist. She also excelled in swimming and diving, and studied ballet and tap dance.\n\n## Personal Life\n\nDiana first met Charles, Prince of Wales, the Queen's eldest son and heir apparent, when she was 16 in November 1977. He was then 29 and dating her older sister, Sarah. Charles and Diana were guests at a country weekend during the summer of 1980 and he took a serious interest in her as a potential bride. The relationship progressed when he invited her aboard the royal yacht Britannia for a sailing weekend to Cowes. This was followed by an invitation to Balmoral Castle (the royal family's Scottish residence) to meet his family. She was well received by the Queen, the Queen Mother, and the Duke of Edinburgh. Charles subsequently courted Diana in London. He proposed on 6 February 1981 at Windsor Castle, and she accepted, but their engagement was kept secret for two and a half weeks.\n\n## Engagement and Wedding\n\nTheir engagement became official on 24 February 1981. Diana selected her own engagement ring. Following the engagement, she left her occupation as a nursery teacher's assistant and temporarily lived at the Queen Mother's residence, Clarence House. She subsequently resided at Buckingham Palace until the wedding. Diana was the first Englishwoman to marry the first in line to the throne since Anne Hyde married James, Duke of York and Albany (later James VII and II), over 300 years earlier. She was also the first royal bride to have a paying job before her engagement.\n\n## Children\n\nThe couple had residences at Kensington Palace and Highgrove House, near Tetbury. On 5 November 1981, Diana's pregnancy was announced. In January 1982—12 weeks into the pregnancy—Diana fell down a staircase at Sandringham, suffering some bruising, and the royal gynaecologist George Pinker was summoned from London; the foetus was uninjured. Diana later confessed that she had intentionally thrown herself down the stairs because she was feeling \"so inadequate.\" On 21 June 1982, she gave birth to the couple's first son, Prince William. She subsequently suffered from postpartum depression after her first pregnancy. Amidst some media criticism, she decided to take William—who was still a baby—on her first major tours of Australia and New Zealand, and the decision was popularly applauded. By her own admission, Diana had not initially intended to take William until Malcolm Fraser, the Australian prime minister, made the suggestion.\n\n## Problems and Separation\n\nFive years into the marriage, the couple's incompatibility and age difference became visible and damaging. In 1986, Diana began a relationship with James Hewitt, the family's former riding instructor, and in the same year, Charles resumed his relationship with his former girlfriend Camilla Parker Bowles. The media speculated that Hewitt, not Charles, was Harry's father based on the alleged physical similarity between Hewitt and Harry, but Hewitt and others have denied this. Harry was born two years before Hewitt and Diana began their affair.\n\n## Divorce\n\nThe journalist Martin Bashir interviewed Diana for the BBC current affairs show Panorama. The interview was broadcast on 20 November 1995. Diana discussed her own and her husband's extramarital affairs. Referring to Charles's relationship with Parker Bowles, she said: \"Well, there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded.\" She also expressed doubt about her husband's suitability for kingship. The authors Tina Brown, Sally Bedell Smith, and Sarah Bradford support Diana's admission in the interview that she had suffered from depression, bulimia, and had engaged in self-harm. Diana's mental health problems were later used by some as an explanation for her increasing unhappiness in the marriage.\n\n## Death\n\nDiana died on 31 August 1997 in a car crash in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in Paris while her driver was fleeing the paparazzi. The crash also resulted in the deaths of her companion Dodi Fayed and their driver, Henri Paul, who was also the acting security manager of Hôtel Ritz Paris. Trevor Rees-Jones, who was employed as a bodyguard by Dodi's father, survived the crash with serious injuries. The televised funeral, on 6 September, was watched by a British television audience that peaked at 32.1 million, which was one of the United Kingdom's highest viewing figures ever and a United States television audience that peaked at 50 million.\n\n## Memorials\n\nPermanent memorials to Diana include the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain in Hyde Park, London; the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Playground in Kensington Gardens; the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Walk, a circular path between Kensington Gardens, Green Park, Hyde Park, and St James's Park; the Statue of Diana, Princess of Wales, in the Sunken Garden of Kensington Palace; and the Princess Diana Memorial in the garden of Schloss Cobenzl in Vienna, making it the first memorial dedicated to Diana in a German-speaking country.\n\n## Titles, Styles, and Honours\n\nAs Princess of Wales, Diana held the following military appointments. Diana was born into the British Spencer family, different branches of which hold the titles of Duke of Marlborough, Earl Spencer, Earl of Sunderland, and Baron Churchill. The Spencers claimed descent from a cadet branch of the powerful medieval Despenser family, but its validity is questioned. Her great-grandmother was Margaret Baring, a member of the German-British Baring family of bankers and the daughter of Edward Baring, 1st Baron Revelstoke.\n\n## Ancestry\n\nDiana was born into the British Spencer family, different branches of which hold the titles of Duke of Marlborough, Earl Spencer, Earl of Sunderland, and Baron Churchill.

first royal bride to have a paying job before her engagement [21] [26] Diana's first public appearance with Charles was at a charity ball held at Goldsmiths' Hall in March 1981, where she was introduced to Princess Grace of Monaco [44]\n\n\nChildren\nThe couple had residences at Kensington Palace and Highgrove House, near Tetbury On 5 November 1981, Diana's pregnancy was announced [53] In

own and her husband's extramarital affairs [118] Referring to Charles's relationship with Parker Bowles, she said: \"Well, there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded.\" She also expressed doubt about her husband's suitability for kingship [117] The authors Tina Brown, Sally Bedell Smith, and Sarah Bradford support Diana's admission in the interview that she had suffered from depression, bulimia and had engaged numerous times in the act of self-harm; the show's transcript records Diana confirming many of her mental health problems [117] The combination of illnesses from which Diana herself said she suffered resulted in some of her biographers opining that she had borderline personality disorder [119] [120] It was later revealed that Bashir had used forged bank statements to win Diana and her brother's trust to secure the interview, falsely indicating people close to her had been paid for spying [121] Lord Dyson conducted an independent inquiry into the issue and concluded that Bashir had \"little difficulty in playing on  [Diana's] fears and paranoia\", a sentiment that was shared by Diana's son William [122] [123]\n\n\nPost-divorce\nAfter her divorce, Diana retained the double apartment on the north side of Kensington Palace that she had shared with Charles since the first year of their marriage; the apartment remained her home until her death the following year She also moved her offices to Kensington Palace but was permitted \"to use the state apartments at St James's Palace\" [128] [142] In a book published in 2003, Paul Burrell claimed Diana's private letters had revealed that her brother, Lord Spencer, had refused to allow her to live at Althorp, despite her request [130] The allegations were proven to be untrue as Spencer received legal apologies from different newspapers, including The Times in 2021, which admitted that \"having considered his sister's safety, and in line with police advice, the Earl offered the Princess of Wales a number of properties including Wormleighton Manor, the Spencer family's original ancestral home\" [143] However, he could not offer Garden House cottage on the Althorp estate to Diana as the home was intended for a member of staff [143]\n\n\nPrincess of Wales\nFollowing her engagement to Charles, Diana made her first official public appearance in March 1981 in a charity event at Goldsmiths' Hall [172] [173] She attended the Trooping the Colour for the first time in June 1981, making her appearance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace afterwards In October 1981, Charles and Diana visited Wales [26] [174] She attended the State Opening of Parliament for the first time on 4 November 1981 [175] Her first solo engagement was a visit to Regent Street on 18 November 1981 to switch on the Christmas lights [176] Diana made her inaugural overseas tour in September 1982, to attend the funeral of Princess Grace of Monaco [26] Also in 1982, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands created Diana a Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown [177] In 1983, Diana accompanied Charles and William on a tour of Australia and New Zealand The tour was a success and the couple drew immense crowds, though the press focused more on Diana rather than Charles, coining the term 'Dianamania' as a reference to people's obsession with her [178] While sitting in a car with Charles near the Sydney Opera House, Diana burst into tears for a few minutes, which their office stated was due to jet lag and the heat [179] In New Zealand, the couple met with representatives of the Māori people [26] Their visit to Canada in June and July 1983 included a trip to Edmonton to open the 1983 Summer Universiade and a stop in Newfoundland to commemorate the 400th anniversary of that island's acquisition by the Crown [180] In 1983, she was targeted by the Scottish National Liberation Army who tried to deliver a letter bomb to her [181]\n\n\nCharity work and patronages\nIn 1983 Diana confided to the premier of Newfoundland, Brian Peckford, \"I am finding it very difficult to cope with the pressures of being Princess of Wales, but I am learning to cope with it\" [208] She was expected to make regular public appearances at hospitals, schools, and other facilities, in the 20th-century model of royal patronage From the mid-1980s, she became increasingly associated with numerous charities She carried out 191 official engagements in 1988 [209] and 397 in 1991 [210] Diana developed an intense interest in serious illnesses and health-related matters outside the purview of traditional royal involvement, including AIDS and leprosy In recognition of her effect as a philanthropist, Stephen Lee, director of the UK Institute of Charity Fundraising Managers, said \"Her overall effect on charity is probably more significant than any other person's in the 20th century.\" [211]\n\n\nHIV/AIDS\nDiana began her work with AIDS patients in the 1980s [236] Contrary to the prevailing stigmatization of AIDS patients, she was not averse to making physical contact with patients, [195] and was the first British royal to do so [236] In 1987, she held hands with an AIDS patient in one of her early efforts to destigmatise the condition [237] [238] Diana noted: \"HIV does not make people dangerous to know You can shake their hands and give them a hug Heaven knows they need it What's more, you can share their homes, their workplaces, and their playgrounds and toys\" [189] To Diana's disappointment, the Queen did not support this type of charity work, suggesting she get involved in \"something more pleasant\" [236] In July 1989, she opened Landmark Aids Centre in South London [239] [240] In October 1990, Diana opened Grandma's House, a home for young AIDS patients in Washington, DC [241] She was also a patron of the National AIDS Trust and regularly visited London Lighthouse, which provided residential care for HIV patients (it has since merged with the Terrence Higgins Trust) [189] [242] In 1991, she hugged one patient during a visit to the AIDS ward of the Middlesex Hospital, [189] which she had opened in 1987 as the first hospital unit dedicated to this cause in the UK [237] [243] As the patron of Turning Point, a health and social care organisation, Diana visited its project in London for people with HIV/AIDS in 1992 [244] She later established and led fundraising campaigns for AIDS research [21]\n\n\nLandmines\nDiana was patron of the HALO Trust, an organisation that removes debris—particularly landmines—left behind by war [249] [250] In January 1997, pictures of Diana touring an Angolan minefield in a ballistic helmet and flak jacket were seen worldwide [249] [250] During her campaign, she was accused of meddling in politics and called a \"loose cannon\" by Lord Howe, an official in the British Ministry of Defence [251] Despite the criticism, HALO states that Diana's efforts resulted in raising international awareness about landmines and the subsequent sufferings caused by them [249] [250] In June 1997, she gave a speech at a landmines conference held at the Royal Geographical Society, and went to Washington, DC to support the American Red Cross's anti-landmine initiative [26] From 7 to 10 August 1997, just days before her death, she visited Bosnia and Herzegovina with Jerry White and Ken Rutherford of the Landmine Survivors Network [26] [252] [253] [254]\n\n\nCancer\nFor her first solo official trip, Diana visited The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, a cancer treatment hospital in London [222] She later chose this charity to be among the organisations that benefited from the auction of her clothes in New York [222] The trust's communications manager said she did \"much to remove the stigma and taboo associated with diseases such as cancer, AIDS, HIV and leprosy\" [222] Diana became president of the hospital on 27 June 1989 [258] [259] [260] The Wolfson Children's Cancer Unit was opened by Diana on 25 February 1993 [258] In February 1996, Diana, who had been informed about a newly opened cancer hospital built by Imran Khan, travelled to Pakistan to visit its children's cancer wards and attend a fundraising dinner in aid of the charity in Lahore [261] She later visited the hospital again in May 1997 [262] In June 1996, she travelled to Chicago in her capacity as president of the Royal Marsden Hospital in order to attend a fundraising event at the Field Museum of Natural History and raised more than £1 million for cancer research [189] She additionally visited patients at the Cook County Hospital and delivered remarks at a conference on breast cancer at the Northwestern University Chicago campus after meeting a group of breast cancer researchers [263] In September 1996, after being asked by Katharine Graham, Diana went to Washington and appeared at a White House breakfast in respect of the Nina Hyde Center for Breast Cancer Research [264] She also attended an annual fund-raiser for breast cancer research organised by The Washington Post at the same centre [21] [265]\n\n\nOther areas\nIn November 1989, Diana visited a leprosy hospital in Indonesia [269] [236] Following her visit, she became patron of the Leprosy Mission, an organisation dedicated to providing medicine, treatment, and other support services to those who are afflicted with the disease She remained the patron of this charity [231] and visited several of its hospitals around the world, especially in India, Nepal, Zimbabwe and Nigeria until her death in 1997 [189] [270] She touched those affected by the disease when many people believed it could be contracted through casual contact [189] [269] \"It has always been my concern to touch people with leprosy, trying to show in a simple action that they are not reviled, nor are we repulsed\", she commented [270] The Diana Princess of Wales Health Education and Media Centre in Noida, India, was opened in her honour in November 1999, funded by the Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Fund to give social support to the people affected by leprosy and disability [270]\n\n\nPrivacy and legal issues\nIn November 1980, the Sunday Mirror ran a story claiming that Charles had used the Royal Train twice for secret love rendezvous with Diana, prompting the palace to issue a statement, calling the story \"a total fabrication\" and demanding an apology [277] [278] The newspaper editors, however, insisted that the woman boarding the train was Diana and declined to apologise [277] In February 1982, pictures of a pregnant Diana in bikini while holidaying were published in the media The Queen subsequently released a statement and called it \"the blackest day in the history of British journalism.\" [279]\n\n\nDeath\nDiana died on 31 August 1997 in a car crash in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in Paris while her driver was fleeing the paparazzi [286] The crash also resulted in the deaths of her companion Dodi Fayed and their driver, Henri Paul, who was also the acting security manager of Hôtel Ritz Paris Trevor Rees-Jones, who was employed as a bodyguard by Dodi's father, [287] survived the crash, suffering a serious head injury The televised funeral, on 6 September, was watched by a British television audience that peaked at 32.1 million, which was one of the United Kingdom's highest viewing figures ever and a United States television audience that peaked at 50 million [288] [289] The event was broadcast to over 200 countries and was seen by an estimated 2.5 billion people [290] [291]\n\n\nTribute, funeral, and burial\nThe sudden and unexpected death of an extraordinarily popular royal figure brought statements from senior figures worldwide and many tributes by members of the public [292] [293] [294] People left flowers, candles, cards, and personal messages outside Kensington Palace for many months Diana's coffin, draped with the royal flag, was brought to London from Paris by Charles and her two sisters on 31 August 1997 [295] [296] The coffin was taken to a private mortuary and then placed in the Chapel Royal, St James's Palace [295]\n\n\nConspiracy theories, inquest and verdict\nThe initial French judicial investigation concluded that the crash was caused by Paul's intoxication, reckless driving, speeding, and effects of prescription drugs [304] In February 1998, Mohamed Al-Fayed, father of Dodi Fayed, publicly said the crash, which killed his son, had been planned, [305] and accused MI6 and the Duke of Edinburgh [306] An inquest, which started in London in 2004 and continued in 2007 and 2008, [307] attributed the crash to grossly negligent driving by Paul and to the pursuing paparazzi, who forced Paul to speed into the tunnel [308] On 7 April 2008, the jury returned a verdict of \"unlawful killing\" On the day after the final verdict of the inquest, Al-Fayed announced that he would end his 10-year campaign to establish that the tragedy was murder; he said he did so for the sake of Diana's children [309]\n\n\nLater events\nFollowing her death, Diana left a £21 million estate, \"netting £17 million after estate taxes\", which were left in the hands of trustees, her mother, and her sister Sarah [310] [311] The will was signed in June 1993, but Diana had it modified in February 1996 to remove the name of her personal secretary from the list of trustees and have Sarah replace him [312] After applying personal and inheritance taxes, a net estate of £12.9 million was left to be distributed among the beneficiaries [313] Her two sons subsequently inherited the majority of her estate Each of them was left with £6.5 million which was invested and gathered substantial interest, and an estimated £10 million was given to each son upon turning 30 years old in 2012 and 2014 respectively [314] [315] Many of Diana's possessions were initially left in the care of her brother, who put them on show in Althorp twice a year until they were returned to Diana's sons [314] [310] They were also put on display in American museums and as of 2011 [update] raised two million dollars for charities [310] Among the objects were her dresses and suits along with numerous family paintings and jewels [314] Diana's engagement ring and her yellow gold watch were given to William and Harry, respectively William later passed the ring to his wife, Catherine Middleton Her wedding dress was also given to her sons [314] [316] [317]\n\n\nFinances\nFollowing her death, Diana left a £21 million estate, \"netting £17 million after estate taxes\", which were left in the hands of trustees, her mother, and her sister Sarah [310] [311] The will was signed in June 1993, but Diana had it modified in February 1996 to remove the name of her personal secretary from the list of trustees and have Sarah replace him [312] After applying personal and inheritance taxes, a net estate of £12.9 million

William and Harry, respectively William later passed the ring to his wife, Catherine Middleton Her wedding dress was also given to her sons [314] [316] [317]\n\n\nSubject of US government surveillance\nIn 1999, after the submission of a Freedom of Information request by the Internet news service apbonline.com, it was revealed that Diana had been placed under surveillance by the National Security Agency until her death, and the organisation kept a top secret file on her containing more than 1,000 pages [318] [319] The contents of Diana's NSA file cannot be disclosed because of national security concerns [318] The NSA officials insisted Diana was not a \"target of  [their] massive, worldwide electronic eavesdropping infrastructure.\" [318] Despite multiple inquiries for the files to be declassified—with one of the notable ones being filed by Mohamed Al-Fayed—the NSA has refused to release the documents [319]\n\n\nAnniversaries, commemorations, and auctions\nOn the first anniversary of Diana's death, people left flowers and bouquets outside the gates of Kensington Palace and a memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey [321] [322] The royal family and Tony Blair and his family went to Crathie Kirk for private prayers, while Diana's family held a private memorial service at Althorp [323] [324] All flags at Buckingham Palace and other royal residences were flown at half-mast on the Queen's orders [325] The Union Jack was first lowered to half-mast on the day of Diana's funeral and has set a precedent, as based on the previous protocol no flag could ever fly at half-mast over the palace \"even on the death of a monarch\" [325] Since 1997, however, the Union Flag (but not the Royal Standard) has flown at half-mast upon the deaths of members of the royal family, and other times of national mourning [326]\n\n\nLegacy\nDiana remains one of the most popular members of the royal family throughout history, and she continues to influence the younger generations of royals [343] [344] [345] She was a major presence on the world stage from her engagement to Charles until her death, and was often described as the \"world's most photographed woman\" [21] [346] She was noted for her compassion, style, charisma, and high-profile charity work, as well as her ill-fated marriage [347] [211] [348] Biographer Sarah Bradford commented, \"The only cure for her suffering would have been the love of the Prince of Wales .. the way in which he consistently denigrated her reduced her to despair.\" [99] Despite all the marital issues and scandals, Diana continued to enjoy a high level of popularity in the polls while her husband was suffering from low levels of public approval [21] Diana's former private secretary Patrick Jephson described her as an organised and hardworking person, and pointed out Charles was not able to \"reconcile with his wife's extraordinary popularity\", [349] a viewpoint supported by the biographer Tina Brown [350] He also said she was a tough boss who was \"equally quick to appreciate hard work\" but could also be defiant \"if she felt she had been the victim of injustice\" [349] Diana's mother also defined her as a \"loving\" figure who could occasionally be \"tempestuous\" [162] She was often described as a devoted mother to her children, [21] [351] who are believed to be influenced by her personality and way of life [352]\n\n\nPublic image\nDiana remains one of the most popular members of the royal family throughout history, and she continues to influence the younger generations of royals [343] [344]

and style\nDiana was a fashion icon whose style was emulated by women around the world In 2012, Time included Diana on its All-Time 100 Fashion Icons list [376] Iain Hollingshead of The Telegraph wrote: \" [Diana] had an ability to sell clothes just by looking at them.\" [377] [378] An early example of the effect occurred during her courtship with Charles in 1980 when sales of Hunter Wellington boots skyrocketed after she was pictured wearing a pair on the Balmoral estate [377] [379] According to designers and people who worked with Diana, she used fashion and style to endorse her charitable causes, express herself and communicate [380] [381] [382] Diana remains a prominent figure for her fashion style, impacting recent cultural and style trends [383] [384] [336] [385]\n\n\nMemorials\nPermanent memorials to Diana include the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain in Hyde Park, London; [404] the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Playground in Kensington Gardens; [405] the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Walk, a circular path between Kensington Gardens, Green Park, Hyde Park, and St James's Park; [406] the Diana Memorial Award, established in 1999 and later relaunched in 2007 by  Gordon Brown; [407] the Statue of Diana, Princess of Wales, in the Sunken Garden of Kensington Palace; [408] and the Princess Diana Memorial in the garden of Schloss Cobenzl in Vienna, making it the first memorial dedicated to Diana in a German-speaking country [409] The Flame of Liberty was erected in 1989 on the Place de l'Alma in Paris above the entrance to the tunnel in which the fatal crash later occurred It became an unofficial memorial to Diana [410] [411] The Place de l'Alma was renamed Place Diana princesse de Galles in 2019 [412] Following her death, several countries issued postage stamps commemorating Diana, including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Somalia, and Congo [413] [414] [415] A bronze plaque was unveiled by Earl Spencer at Northampton Guildhall in 2002 as a memorial to his sister [416]\n\n\nIn popular culture and art\nBefore and after her death, Diana has been the subject of films and television series and depicted in contemporary art The first biopics about Diana and Charles were Charles & Diana: A Royal Love Story and The Royal Romance of Charles and Diana that were broadcast on American TV channels on 17 and 20 September 1981, respectively [423] In December 1992, ABC aired Charles and Diana: Unhappily Ever After, a TV movie about marital discord between Diana and Charles [424] Actresses who have portrayed Diana include

Cornwall, [443] Countess of Chester, [444] [445] and Baroness of Renfrew [443] After her divorce in 1996 and until her death, she was known as \"Diana, Princess of Wales\", without the style of \"Her Royal Highness\" [442] Though popularly referred to as \"Princess Diana\", that style is incorrect and one she never held officially [b] She is still sometimes referred to in the media as \"Lady Diana Spencer\" or colloquially as \"Lady Di\" In a speech after her death, Tony Blair referred to Diana as \"the people's princess\" [447] [448] Discussions were also held with the Spencer family and the British royal family as to whether Diana's HRH style needed to be restored posthumously, but Diana's family decided that it would be against her wishes and, thus, no formal offer was made

Until the age of nine, he lived in Lorain, Ohio, but due to his asthma, the family moved to South Tampa, Florida, where he attended Henry B. Plant High School. Gallagher's early life was marked by a strong interest in music and comedy, which would eventually become the foundation of his career.\n\n**Career**\n\nAfter high school, Gallagher attended the University of South Florida, where he graduated with a chemical engineering degree in 1970. He minored in English literature and began working as a road manager for comedian/musician Jim Stafford. During this time, Gallagher honed his own comedy act and began performing at local comedy clubs, including The Comedy Store and The Ice House.\n\nGallagher's big break came when he appeared on \"The Tonight Show\" with Johnny Carson in 1975, demonstrating his prop, \"The Tonight Show Home Game.\" He returned to the show in 1979 and also appeared on other popular TV programs, including \"The Mike Douglas Show,\" \"The Merv Griffin Show,\" and \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour.\" Gallagher's comedy style quickly gained popularity, and he became a regular performer at the Playboy Clubs.\n\n**Comedy Style**\n\nGallagher's comedy style is characterized by his use of witty wordplay, sharp observational humor, and outrageous physical antics. He is known for his ability to think on his feet and to create humorous situations and characters. His most famous prop is the \"Sledge-O-Matic,\" a large wooden mallet that he uses to smash a variety of food items and other objects, culminating with a watermelon.\n\nThe Sledge-O-Matic act is a parody of the unintentionally humorous advertisements for the Ronco Veg-O-Matic, a kitchen tool that was heavily advertised on U.S. television from the mid-1960s through the 1970s. Gallagher's audiences are often issued ponchos or know to bring raincoats to prepare for debris cast off into the audience, which he dubs \"Death Row.\" His show also features a variety of props, including a large trampoline designed to look like a couch.\n\n**Sledge-O-Matic**\n\nThe Sledge-O-Matic is Gallagher's signature prop and the centerpiece of his comedy act. It is a large wooden mallet that he uses to smash a variety of food items and other objects, culminating with a watermelon. The Sledge-O-Matic is a parody of the unintentionally humorous advertisements for the Ronco Veg-O-Matic, a kitchen tool that was heavily advertised on U.S. television from the mid-1960s through the 1970s.\n\nGallagher's Sledge-O-Matic act is a physical prop comedy routine that involves smashing a variety of food items and other objects with the mallet. He typically ends each of his shows with this routine, which has become a hallmark of his comedy style. The Sledge-O-Matic has become synonymous with Gallagher's brand of humor and is widely recognized as a symbol of his comedy.\n\n**Audience Injuries**\n\nOn some occasions, audience members have sustained injuries during Gallagher's performances. The most common injuries are minor, such as scratches and bruises, but in some cases, audience members have been hit by debris or other objects that have been smashed by the Sledge-O-Matic.\n\nGallagher has taken steps to minimize the risk of injury to his audience, including issuing ponchos and warning them to be prepared for debris cast off into the audience. Despite these precautions, some audience members have still been injured, and Gallagher has been sued on several occasions for damages.\n\n**Conflict with Brother**\n\nIn the early 1990s, Gallagher's younger brother Ron asked him for permission to perform shows using Gallagher's trademark Sledge-O-Matic routine. Gallagher granted his permission on the condition that Ron and his manager clarified in promotional materials that it was Ron Gallagher, not Leo Gallagher, who was performing.\n\nHowever, Ron began promoting his act as \"Gallagher Too\" or \"Gallagher Two,\" which led to confusion among fans and led to a conflict between the two brothers. In some instances, Ron's act was promoted in a way that left unclear the fact that he was not the original Gallagher.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nIn 2004, Comedy Central rated Gallagher the 100th best stand-up comedian of all time. Gallagher was displeased with being ranked so low and told The Oregonian, \"I looked at the other people and I was trying to find anyone I ever heard of. How could I be behind people I never heard of?... I made 13 one-hour shows for Showtime, which are available on videotape. I invented the one-man show on cable.\"\n\nGallagher's legacy is that of a pioneer in the world of comedy. He was one of the first comedians to use props and physical comedy in his act, and he paved the way for other comedians to follow in his footsteps. His Sledge-O-Matic act is widely recognized as a classic of comedy and has become synonymous with his brand of humor.\n\n**Scientific Study**\n\nIn the 1980s, researchers at Loma Linda University used Gallagher's comedy to study laughter's effect on the body. They took blood samples from ten medical school students while they watched Gallagher in action and observed that the subjects' white blood cells increased.\n\nThe scientists said that laughing appeared to have boosted the subjects' immune systems and that Gallagher's comedy was a effective way to stimulate laughter. The study was published in a medical journal and helped to further the understanding of the effects of laughter on the body.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nGallagher has been married three times and has two children. He has been open about his struggles with money and has joked that he was \"broke\" after losing nearly all of his fortune speculating on the stock market. However, his long-time manager disputed this as a bit of comedic exaggeration, adding, \"We all need to be as broke as Leo.\"\n\nGallagher has been a resident of California for many years and has been involved in various charitable organizations, including the Make-A-Wish Foundation and the Children's Hospital Los Angeles.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* _Gallagher's Greatest Hits_ (1986)\n* _Gallagher's

He is best known for his iconic roles in the television series _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ and the PBS children's show _Reading Rainbow_. Born on February 16, 1957, in Landstuhl, West Germany, Burton's career spans over four decades, with a wide range of notable performances in film, television, and theater.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nBurton was born to Erma Gene (née Christian), a social worker, administrator, and educator, in Landstuhl, West Germany. He and his two sisters were raised by their mother in Sacramento, California, United States. Burton's early life was marked by a strong emphasis on education and the arts, which would later shape his career choices.\n\n**Career**\n\nBurton made his acting debut in 1976 with the film _Almos' a Man_, a film based on the Richard Wright short story \"The Man Who Was Almost a Man.\" In this early role, Burton starred alongside Madge Sinclair, marking the beginning of his professional career. However, it was his breakout role as the young Kunta Kinte in the ABC miniseries _Roots_ (1977) that catapulted him to national recognition. Based on the novel of the same name by Alex Haley, _Roots_ told the story of the transatlantic slave trade and the experiences of African slaves in America. Burton's performance earned him an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor for a Single Appearance in a Drama or Comedy Series.\n\n**Early Work**\n\nBurton's early work was marked by a series of small roles in film and television. He appeared in _Almos' a Man_ (1976), _Roots_ (1977), and _The Waltons_ (1977), among other productions. However, it was his subsequent roles in _Roots_ and _Reading Rainbow_ that established him as a talented and versatile actor.\n\n**Roots**\n\nBurton's breakthrough role as the young Kunta Kinte in _Roots_ marked a significant turning point in his career. The miniseries, which aired in 1977, told the story of the transatlantic slave trade and the experiences of African slaves in America. Burton's performance earned him widespread recognition and critical acclaim. As a result of his performance, he was nominated for an Emmy in the Outstanding Lead Actor for a Single Appearance in a Drama or Comedy Series category.\n\n**Reading Rainbow**\n\nIn 1983, Burton began hosting and executive producing the PBS children's show _Reading Rainbow_. The series, which ran for 23 seasons, aimed to encourage a love of reading in children. Burton's warm and engaging on-screen presence made the show a hit, and it became a staple of children's television. During his tenure as host, Burton read a wide range of books, from classic children's literature to contemporary fiction.\n\n**Star Trek: The Next Generation**\n\nIn 1986, Gene Roddenberry approached Burton with the role of Lieutenant Junior Grade Geordi La Forge in the Star Trek: The Next Generation television series. The character, who is blind but is granted \"sight\" through the use of a prosthetic device called a VISOR worn over his eyes, was a departure from traditional heroic roles. La Forge began as the USS Enterprise's helmsman and, as of the show's second season, had become its chief engineer. At the time, Burton was considerably better known than Patrick Stewart in the United States, due to his roles in _Roots_ and _Reading Rainbow_. When the show premiered, the Associated Press stated that Burton's role was essentially the \"new Spock.\" However, in a 2019 interview, Burton laughed in disbelief at the idea, stating \"that speculation never came to fruition.\"\n\nBurton also portrayed La Forge in the subsequent feature films based on _Star Trek: The Next Generation_, from _Star Trek Generations_ (1994) to _Star Trek: Nemesis_ (2002). He directed two episodes of _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ and several episodes of _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_, _Star Trek: Voyager_, and _Star Trek: Enterprise_. Burton reprised the role of LaForge in the third and final season of _Star Trek: Picard_ (2023).\n\n**Podcast: LeVar Burton Reads**\n\nIn 2017, Burton began a podcast, _LeVar Burton Reads_. Each 30-45-minute episode features Burton reading a piece of short fiction and sharing his thoughts on it. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Burton continued to read on his podcast and also gave live readings three times a week during a Twitter livestream focused at different times to different children, young adults, and adult audiences.\n\n**Other Appearances**\n\nBurton has appeared in a wide range of other productions, including _Fantasy Island_, _The Love Boat_, _Battle of the Network Stars_, and _The Muppet Show_. He has also been a frequent guest on several game shows.\n\n**Directing**\n\nThroughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Burton directed episodes for each of the various _Star Trek_ series then in production. He has directed more _Star Trek_ episodes than any other former regular cast member.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nLeVar Burton married Stephanie Cozart, a professional make-up artist, on October 3, 1992. Burton has two children, son Eian Burton Smith and daughter Michaela \"Mica\" Jean Burton. The family lives in Sherman Oaks, California.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* _Almos' a Man_ (1976)\n* _Roots_ (1977)\n* _The Waltons_ (1977)\n* _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ (1987-1994)\n* _Star Trek Generations_ (1994)\n* _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ (1993-1999)\n* _Star Trek: Voyager_ (1995-2001)\n* _Star Trek: Enterprise_ (2001-2005)\n* _Reading Rainbow_ (1983-2006)\n* _LeVar Burton Reads_ (2017-present)\n\n**Awards and Honors**\n\n* Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor for a Single Appearance in a Drama or Comedy Series for _Roots_ (1977)\n* Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (1990)\n* Received the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actor in a Drama Series for _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ (1992)\n* Received the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Host of a TV Talk or Awards Show for _Reading Rainbow_ (1993)\n* Received the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Writing in a Dramatic Series for _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ (1995)\n\n**Books**\n\n* _Star Trek: The Next Generation - The Best of Both Worlds_ (1993)\n* _Star Trek: The Next Generation - All Good Things_ (1994)\n\n**See also**\n\n* _Star Trek: The Next Generation_\n* _Reading Rainbow_\n* _LeVar Burton Reads_\n* _Geordi La Forge_\n* _Kunta Kinte_\n\n**Notes**\n\n* LeVar Burton's early life was marked by a strong emphasis on education and the arts.\n* Burton's breakout role as the young Kunta Kinte in _Roots_ marked a significant turning point in his career.\n* Burton's role as Geordi La Forge in _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ was a departure from traditional heroic roles.\n* Burton has directed more _Star Trek_ episodes than any other former regular cast member.\n\n**References**\n\n* \"LeVar Burton.\" _IMDb_.

Tony Blair said that he was \"utterly devastated by the death of the Princess\" [68] [108] US President Bill Clinton said that he and his wife, Hillary Clinton, were \"profoundly saddened\" when they found out about her death [28] Kofi Annan, the United Nations Secretary-General said that her death \"has robbed the world of a consistent and committed voice for the improvement of the lives of suffering children worldwide\" [88] In a telegram of condolences, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl expressed the view that Diana had also become the victim of an \"increasingly brutal and unscrupulous competition on the part of some of the media.\" [109] In Australia, the Deputy Prime Minister, Tim Fischer, condemned the paparazzi for their overzealous coverage of Diana [110] Russian President Boris Yeltsin praised Diana's charity work in a statement saying, \"All know of Princess Diana's big contribution to charitable work, and not only in Great Britain\" [111] [112] Among other politicians who sent messages of condolences were Australian Prime Minister John Howard, South African President Nelson Mandela, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, New Zealand Prime Minister Jim Bolger, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [111] The Australian House of Representatives and the New Zealand House of Representatives also passed parliamentary motions of condolence [113] [114] The Government of Canada, as well as individual provinces in the country, set up online and in-person books of condolences in their parliament buildings and memorial services were held across the country [115]\n\n\nPublic\nIn London, thousands of people carried bouquets and stood outside Buckingham Palace after the news of her death [88] People started bringing flowers within an hour after the news was shared [85] The BBC flew its flags at half-mast [88] Both radio and television aired the British national anthem, \"God Save the Queen\", in response to Diana's death, as is precedent for the death of a member of the Royal Family [85] An elegy was published by Ted Hughes to mark her death [119] Sporting events in the UK were rearranged, with demands for Scotland's Football Association chief executive to resign due to their delayed response to reschedule Scotland's World Cup qualifier [120]\n\n\nSocial and economic impact\nDuring the four weeks following her funeral, the suicide rate in England and Wales rose by 17% and cases of deliberate self-harm by 44.3% compared with the average for that period in the four previous years Researchers suggest that this was caused by the \"identification\" effect, as the greatest increase in suicides was by people most similar to Diana: women aged 25 to 44, whose suicide rate increased by over 45% [128] Another research showed that 50% of Britons and 27% of Americans were deeply affected by her death as if someone they knew had died It also concluded that in general women were more affected than men in both of the countries [129] The same research showed that Diana's \"charitable endeavors\" and \"ability to identify with ordinary people\" were among the main factors that caused her to be admired and respected by the people [129] In the weeks after her death counselling services reported an increase in the number of phone calls by the people who were seeking help due to grief or distress [130]\n\n\nReception\nSome criticised the reaction to Diana's death at the time as being \"hysterical\" and \"irrational\" As early as 1998, philosopher Anthony O'Hear identified the mourning as a defining point in the \"sentimentalisation of Britain\", a media-fuelled phenomenon where image and reality become blurred [137] Oasis bandleader Noel Gallagher responded to the reaction with, \"The woman's dead Shut up Get over it\" [138] These criticisms were repeated on the tenth anniversary of the crash, when journalist Jonathan Freedland of The Guardian expressed the opinion that, \"It has become an embarrassing memory, like a mawkish, self-pitying teenage entry in a diary .. we cringe to think about it.\" [139] In 2010, Theodore Dalrymple suggested \"sentimentality, both spontaneous and generated by the exaggerated attention of the media, that was necessary to turn the death of the princess into an event of such magnitude thus served a political purpose, one that was inherently dishonest in a way that parallels the dishonesty that lies behind much sentimentality itself\" [140]\n\n\nMemorials\nIn the years after her death, many memorials were commissioned and dedicated to her As a temporary memorial, the public co-opted the Flamme de la Liberté (Flame of Liberty), a monument near the Pont de l'Alma tunnel related to the French donation of the Statue of Liberty to the US The messages of condolence have since been removed and its use as a Diana memorial has discontinued, though visitors still leave messages in her memory A permanent memorial, the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain, was opened by the Queen in Hyde Park in London on 6 July 2004, [148] followed by a statue in the Sunken Garden of Kensington Palace, which was unveiled by her sons on 1 July 2021 [149]\n\n\nInquests\nUnder English law, an inquest is required in cases of sudden or unexplained death [151] [152] A French judicial investigation had already been carried out, but the 6,000-page report was never published [153] On 6 January 2004, six years after Diana's death, an inquest into the crash opened in London held by Michael Burgess, the coroner of the Queen's Household [152] The coroner asked the Metropolitan Police commissioner, Sir John Stevens, to make inquiries in response to speculation that the deaths were not an accident [152] [154] Forensic scientist Angela Gallop was commissioned to examine the forensic evidence [155] The police investigation reported its findings in Operation Paget in December 2006 [156]\n\n\nRelated lawsuits\nNine photographers, who had been following Diana and Dodi in 1997, were charged with manslaughter in France [2] France's \"highest court\" dropped the charges in 2002 [2]\n\n\nConspiracy theories\nAlthough the initial French investigation found that Diana had died as a result of an accident, several conspiracy theories have been raised [178] Since February 1998, Fayed's father, Mohamed Al-Fayed, has claimed that the crash was a result of a conspiracy, [179] and later contended that the crash was orchestrated by MI6 on the instructions of the Royal Family [180] His claims were dismissed by a French judicial investigation [4] and by Operation Paget [181] On 7 April 2008, Lord Justice Baker's inquest into the deaths of Diana and Fayed ended with the jury concluding that they were the victims of an \"unlawful killing\" by Henri Paul and the drivers of the following vehicles [182] Additional factors were \"the impairment of the judgment of the driver of the Mercedes through alcohol\" and \"the death of the deceased was caused or contributed to by the fact that the deceased was not wearing a seat belt, the fact that the Mercedes struck the pillar in the Alma Tunnel rather than colliding with something else\" [170]\n\n\nIn the media\nActor George Clooney was critical of several tabloids and paparazzi agencies following Diana's death A few of the tabloids boycotted Clooney following the outburst, stating that he \"owed a fair portion of his celebrity\" to the tabloids and photo agencies in question [185] In September 1997, a number of supermarket chains in the US removed the September 9 issue of the National Enquirer, which bore the title \"Di Goes Sex Mad\" [186] The paper's editor described the incident as \"an unfortunate circumstance\", which was not meant to coincide with her death [187] Another American tabloid, Globe, issued an apology for its headline \"To Di For\" [187]\n\n\nInternet coverage\nDiana's death occurred at a time when Internet use in the developed world was booming, and several national newspapers and at least one British regional newspaper had already launched online news services BBC News had set up online coverage of the general election earlier in 1997 [197] and as a result of the widespread public and media attention surrounding Diana's death, BBC News swiftly created a website featuring news coverage of Diana's death and the events that followed it Diana's death helped BBC News officials realise how important online news services were becoming, and a full online news service was launched on 4 November that year, alongside the launch of the BBC's rolling news channel BBC News 24 on 9 November [198]\n\n\nTelevision\nIn the United Kingdom, the BBC were the first to announce the crash, with Martyn Lewis on the air on both BBC1 (interrupting Borsalino) and BBC2 Lewis would later announce Diana's death at 06:30 GMT  [199] On BBC World, Nik Gowing was on duty within a few hours of the crash for rolling coverage alongside Maxine Mawhinney and George Arney He would also announce Diana's death just before 6am [200]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang":

The photographers, who were driving on motorcycles, had been trying to get close to the couple, and their aggressive behavior was seen as a contributing factor to the accident. In the hours leading up to the crash, Diana and Dodi had been at the Ritz Hotel, where they had been staying, and had been seen leaving the hotel in a blue Fiat Uno. The car was being driven by Henri Paul, the acting head of security at the Ritz, who was known to have a troubled past. Paul was driving at a speed of around 65 mph (105 km/h) in a 31 mph (50 km/h) zone, and the car was seen swerving to avoid a white Fiat Uno before crashing into the 13th pillar of the Alma Tunnel.\n\n## The Crash\n\nAt 00:23, Paul lost control of the car at the entrance to the Pont de l'Alma underpass.

greatest increase in suicides was by people most similar to Diana: women aged 25 to 44, whose suicide rate increased by over 45% [128] Another research showed that 50% of Britons and 27% of Americans were deeply affected by her death as if someone they knew had died It also concluded that in general women were more affected than men in both of the countries [129] The same research showed that Diana's \"charitable endeavors\" and \"ability to identify with ordinary people\" were among the main factors that caused her to be admired and respected by the people [129] In the weeks after her death counselling services reported an increase in the number of phone calls by the people who were seeking help due to grief or distress [130]\n\n\nReception\nSome criticised the reaction to Diana's death at the time as being \"hysterical\" and \"irrational\" As early as 1998, philosopher Anthony O'Hear identified the mourning as a defining point in the \"sentimentalisation of Britain\", a media-fuelled phenomenon where image and reality become blurred [137] Oasis bandleader Noel Gallagher responded to the reaction with, \"The woman's dead Shut up Get over it\" [138] These criticisms were repeated on the tenth anniversary of the crash, when journalist Jonathan Freedland of The Guardian expressed the opinion that, \"It has become an embarrassing memory, like a mawkish, self-pitying teenage entry in a diary .. we cringe to think about it.\" [139] In 2010, Theodore Dalrymple suggested \"sentimentality, both spontaneous and generated by the exaggerated attention of the media, that was necessary to turn the death of the princess into an event of such magnitude thus served a political purpose, one that was inherently dishonest in a way that parallels the dishonesty that lies behind much sentimentality itself\" [140]\n\n\nMemorials\nIn the years after her death, many memorials were commissioned and dedicated to her As a temporary memorial, the public co-opted the Flamme de la Liberté (Flame of Liberty), a monument near the Pont de l'Alma tunnel related to the French donation of the Statue of Liberty to the US The messages of condolence have since been removed and its use as a Diana memorial has discontinued, though visitors still leave messages in her memory A permanent memorial, the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain, was opened by the Queen in Hyde Park in London on 6 July 2004, [148] followed by a statue in the Sunken Garden of Kensington Palace, which was unveiled by her sons on 1 July 2021 [149]\n\n\nInquests\nUnder English law, an inquest is required in cases of sudden or unexplained death [151] [152] A French judicial investigation had already been carried out, but the 6,000-page report was never published [153] On 6 January 2004, six years after Diana's death, an inquest into the crash opened in London held by Michael Burgess, the coroner of the Queen's Household [152] The coroner asked the Metropolitan Police commissioner, Sir John Stevens, to make inquiries in response to speculation that the deaths were not an accident [152] [154] Forensic scientist Angela Gallop was commissioned to examine the forensic evidence [155] The police investigation reported its findings in Operation Paget in December 2006 [156]\n\n\nRelated lawsuits\nNine photographers, who had been following Diana and Dodi in 1997, were charged with manslaughter in France [2] France's \"highest court\" dropped the charges in 2002 [2]\n\n\nConspiracy theories\nAlthough the initial French investigation found that Diana had died as a result of an accident, several conspiracy theories have been raised [178] Since February 1998, Fayed's father, Mohamed Al-Fayed, has claimed that the crash was a result of a conspiracy, [179] and later contended that the crash was orchestrated by MI6 on the instructions of the Royal Family [180] His claims were dismissed by a French judicial investigation [4] and by Operation Paget [181] On 7 April 2008, Lord Justice Baker's inquest into the deaths of Diana and Fayed ended with the jury concluding that they were the victims of an \"unlawful killing\" by Henri Paul and the drivers of the following vehicles [182] Additional factors were \"the impairment of the judgment of the driver of the Mercedes through alcohol\" and \"the death of the deceased was caused or contributed to by the fact that the deceased was not wearing a seat belt, the fact that the Mercedes struck the pillar in the Alma Tunnel rather than colliding with something else\" [170]\n\n\nIn the media\nActor George Clooney was critical of several tabloids and paparazzi agencies following Diana's death A few of the tabloids boycotted Clooney following the outburst, stating that he \"owed a fair portion of his celebrity\" to the tabloids and photo agencies in question [185] In September 1997, a number of supermarket chains in the US removed the September 9 issue of the National Enquirer, which bore the title \"Di Goes Sex Mad\" [186] The paper's editor described the incident as \"an unfortunate circumstance\", which was not meant to coincide with her death [187] Another American tabloid, Globe, issued an apology for its headline \"To Di For\" [187]\n\n\nInternet coverage\nDiana's death occurred at a time when Internet use in the developed world was booming, and several national newspapers and at least one British regional newspaper had already launched online news services BBC News had set up online coverage of the general election earlier in 1997 [197] and as a result of the widespread public and media attention surrounding Diana's death, BBC News swiftly created a website featuring news coverage of Diana's death and the events that followed it Diana's death helped BBC News officials realise how important online news services were becoming, and a full online news service was launched on 4 November that year, alongside the launch of the BBC's rolling news channel BBC News 24 on 9 November [198]\n\n\nTelevision\nIn the United Kingdom, the BBC were the first to announce the crash, with Martyn Lewis on the air on both BBC1 (interrupting Borsalino) and BBC2 Lewis would later announce Diana's death at 06:30 GMT  [199] On BBC World, Nik Gowing was on duty within a few hours of the crash for rolling coverage alongside Maxine Mawhinney and George Arney He would also announce Diana's death just before 6am [200]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

His stuff was dazzling.\" Burrows wrote Allen letters of introduction to Sid Caesar, Phil Silvers, and Peter Lind Hayes, who immediately sent Allen a check for just the jokes Burrows included as samples [42] As a result of the jokes Allen mailed to various writers, he was invited, then age 19, to join the NBC Writer's Development Program in 1955, followed by a job on The NBC Comedy Hour in Los Angeles, then a job as a full-time writer for humorist Herb Shriner, initially earning $25 a week [38] He began writing scripts for The Ed Sullivan Show, The Tonight Show, specials for Sid Caesar post-Caesar's Hour (1954–1957), and other television shows [43] By the time he was working for Caesar, he was earning $1,500 a week He worked alongside Mel Brooks, Carl Reiner, Larry Gelbart, and Neil Simon He also worked with Danny Simon, whom Allen credits for helping form his writing style [38] [44] In 2021, Brooks said of working with Allen, \"Woody was so young then I was about 24 when I started, but Woody must have been 19, but so wise, so smart He had this tricky little mind and he'd surprise you, which is the trick of being a good comedy writer.\" [45] In 1962 alone, he estimated that he wrote twenty thousand jokes for various comics [46] Allen also wrote for Candid Camera and appeared in several episodes [47]\n\n\n1960–1969: Stand-up comedian\nFrom 1960 to 1969 Allen performed as a comedian in various places around Greenwich Village, including The Bitter End and Cafe Au Go Go, alongside such contemporaries as Lenny Bruce, the team of Mike Nichols and Elaine May, Joan Rivers, George Carlin, Richard Pryor, Dick Cavett, Bill Cosby and Mort Sahl (his personal favorite), as well as such other artists of the day as Bob Dylan and Barbra Streisand [57] Comedian Milton Berle claims to have suggested to Allen to go into standup comedy and even introduced him at the Village Vanguard [58] Comedy historian Gerald Nachman writes, \"He helped turn it into biting, brutally honest satirical commentary on the cultural and psychological tenor of the times.\" [37]\n\n\n1965–1976: Broadway debut and early films\nAllen's first movie was the Charles K Feldman production What's New Pussycat? (1965) [78] Allen was disappointed with the final product, which led him to direct every film he wrote thereafter except Play It Again, Sam [79] Allen's first directorial effort was What's Up, Tiger Lily? (1966, co-written with Mickey Rose) [80] That same year, Allen wrote the play Don't Drink the Water, starring Lou Jacobi, Kay Medford, Anita Gillette, and Allen's future movie co-star Tony Roberts

black-and-white homage to the German expressionists and features the music of Kurt Weill [124] Allen then made his critically acclaimed comedy-drama Husbands and Wives (1992), which received two Oscar nominations: Best Supporting Actress for Judy Davis and Best Original Screenplay for Allen Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993) combined suspense with dark comedy and marked the return of Diane Keaton, Alan Alda and Anjelica Huston.\n\n\n2005–2014: Career resurgence\n\"In the United States things have changed a lot, and it's hard to make good small films now\", Allen said in a 2004 interview \"The avaricious studios couldn't care less about good films—if they get a good film they're twice as happy but money-making films are their goal They only want these $100 million pictures that make $500 million.\" [135] Allen traveled to London, where he made Match Point (2005), one of his most successful films of the decade, garnering positive reviews [136] Set in London, it starred Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Scarlett Johansson It is markedly darker than Allen's first four films with DreamWorks SKG In Match Point Allen shifts focus from the intellectual upper class of New York to the moneyed upper class of London The film earned more than $23 million domestically (more than any of his films in nearly 20 years) and over $62 million in international box office sales [137] It earned Allen his first Academy Award nomination since 1998, for Best Writing – Original Screenplay, with directing and writing nominations at the Golden Globes, his first Globe nominations since 1987 In a 2006

not sure where to begin My guess is that Roy Price  [the head of Amazon Studios] will regret this.\" [167] [168] [169] At the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, Allen said of his upcoming Amazon show: \"It was a catastrophic mistake I don't know what I'm doing I'm floundering I expect this to be a cosmic embarrassment.\" [170] On September 30, 2016, Amazon Video debuted Allen's first television series

criticism from employees of the publishers [207] [208] On March 6, the publisher announced that it had canceled the book's release, saying in part, \"The decision to cancel Mr Allen's book was a difficult one.\" [209] Hachette's decision also drew criticism from novelist Stephen King, Executive director of PEN America Suzanne Nossel, and others [210] [211] On March 6, 2020, Manuel Carcassonne

The next day, that friend's babysitter told her employer that she had seen that \"Dylan was sitting on the sofa, and Woody was kneeling on the floor, facing her, with his head in her lap.\" When Farrow asked Dylan about it, Dylan allegedly said that Allen had touched Dylan's \"private part\" while they were alone together in the attic.\n\n**Works About Allen**\n\nFrom 1976 to 1984, Stuart Hample wrote and drew Inside Woody Allen, a comic strip based on Allen's film persona.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Woody_Allen\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nAllen was born Allan Stewart Konigsberg [23] at Mount Eden Hospital in Bronx, New York City, on November 30, 1935, [a] [24] [25] to Nettie (née Cherry; 1906–2002), a bookkeeper at her family's delicatessen, and Martin Konigsberg (1900–2001), [26] a jewelry engraver and waiter [27] His grandparents were Jewish immigrants to the U.S from Austria and Panevėžys, Lithuania [28] They spoke German, Hebrew, and Yiddish [29] [30] He and his younger sister, film producer Letty Aronson, were raised in Brooklyn's Midwood neighborhood Both their parents were born and raised on the Lower East Side of Manhattan [31]\n\n\nCareer\nNote: For a list of Allen's films, see Woody Allen filmography.\n\n\n1955–1959: Comedy writer and television work\nAllen began writing short jokes when he was 15, [41] and the next year began offering them to various Broadway writers for sale.: 539  One of them, Abe Burrows, co-author of Guys and Dolls, wrote, \"Wow! His stuff was dazzling.\" Burrows wrote Allen letters of introduction to Sid Caesar, Phil Silvers, and Peter Lind Hayes, who immediately sent Allen a check for just the jokes Burrows included as samples [42] As a result of the jokes Allen mailed to various writers, he was invited, then age 19, to join the NBC Writer's Development Program in 1955, followed by a job on The NBC Comedy Hour in Los Angeles, then a job as a full-time writer for humorist Herb Shriner, initially earning $25 a week [38] He began writing scripts for The Ed Sullivan Show, The Tonight Show, specials for Sid Caesar post-Caesar's Hour (1954–1957), and other television shows [43] By the time he was working for Caesar, he was earning $1,500 a week He worked alongside Mel Brooks, Carl Reiner, Larry Gelbart, and Neil Simon He also worked with Danny Simon, whom Allen credits for helping form his writing style [38] [44] In 2021, Brooks said of working with Allen, \"Woody was so young then I was about 24 when I started, but Woody must have been 19, but so wise, so smart He had this tricky little mind and he'd surprise you, which is the trick of being a good comedy writer.\" [45] In 1962 alone, he estimated that he wrote twenty thousand jokes for various comics [46] Allen also wrote for Candid Camera and appeared in several episodes [47]\n\n\n1960–1969: Stand-up comedian\nFrom 1960 to 1969 Allen performed as a comedian in various places around Greenwich Village, including The Bitter End and Cafe Au Go Go, alongside such contemporaries as Lenny Bruce, the team of Mike Nichols and Elaine May, Joan Rivers, George Carlin, Richard Pryor, Dick Cavett, Bill Cosby and Mort Sahl (his personal favorite), as well as such other artists of the day as Bob Dylan and Barbra Streisand [57] Comedian Milton Berle claims to have suggested to Allen to go into standup comedy and even introduced him at the Village Vanguard [58] Comedy historian Gerald Nachman writes, \"He helped turn it into biting, brutally honest satirical commentary on the cultural and psychological tenor of the times.\" [37]\n\n\n1965–1976: Broadway debut and early films\nAllen's first movie was the Charles K Feldman production What's New Pussycat? (1965) [78] Allen was disappointed with the final product, which led him to direct every film he wrote thereafter except Play It Again, Sam [79] Allen's first directorial effort was What's Up, Tiger Lily? (1966, co-written with Mickey Rose) [80] That same year, Allen wrote the play Don't Drink the Water, starring Lou Jacobi, Kay Medford, Anita Gillette, and Allen's future movie co-star Tony Roberts [81] In 1994 Allen directed and starred in a second version for television, with Michael J Fox and Mayim Bialik [82]\n\n\n1977–1989: Established career\nI don't like meeting heroes There's nobody I want to meet and nobody I want to work with—I'd rather work with Diane Keaton than anyone—she's absolutely great, a natural.\n\n\n1990–2004: Continued work\nAllen's 1991 film Shadows and Fog is a black-and-white homage to the German expressionists and features the music of Kurt Weill [124] Allen then made his critically acclaimed comedy-drama Husbands and Wives (1992), which received two Oscar nominations: Best Supporting Actress for Judy Davis and Best Original Screenplay for Allen Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993) combined suspense with dark comedy and marked the return of Diane Keaton, Alan Alda and Anjelica Huston.\n\n\n2005–2014: Career resurgence\n\"In the United States things have changed a lot, and it's hard to make good small films now\", Allen said in a 2004 interview \"The avaricious studios couldn't care less about good films—if they get a good film they're twice as happy but money-making films are their goal They only want these $100 million pictures that make $500 million.\" [135] Allen traveled to London, where he made Match Point (2005), one of his most successful films of the decade, garnering positive reviews [136] Set in London, it starred Jonathan Rhys

not sure where to begin My guess is that Roy Price  [the head of Amazon Studios] will regret this.\" [167] [168] [169] At the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, Allen said of his upcoming Amazon show: \"It was a catastrophic mistake I don't know what I'm doing I'm floundering I expect this to be a cosmic embarrassment.\" [170] On September 30, 2016, Amazon Video debuted Allen's first television series

account of Allen's life, both personal and professional, and describes his work in films, theater, television, nightclubs, and print...Allen also writes of his relationships with family, friends, and

criticism from employees of the publishers [207] [208] On March 6, the publisher announced that it had canceled the book's release, saying in part, \"The decision to cancel Mr Allen's book was a difficult one.\" [209] Hachette's decision also drew criticism from novelist Stephen King, Executive director of PEN America Suzanne Nossel, and others [210] [211] On March 6, 2020, Manuel Carcassonne

The tournament will be the 23rd edition of the FIFA World Cup and will feature 32 national teams competing for the championship.\n\n**Host Selection**\n\nThe host selection process for the 2030 FIFA World Cup began in 2022. FIFA launched the bidding process, which saw several countries expressing interest in hosting the tournament. The bidding process was notable for the large number of countries involved, with a total of 8 associations submitting bids. The bidding process was also unprecedented for its geographical scope, with countries from different confederations participating.\n\nThe bidding process was conducted through a series of meetings and presentations, with each bidding country showcasing their proposed host cities, stadiums, and infrastructure. The bidding process also saw the introduction of a new bidding format, which emphasized sustainability and environmental considerations.\n\n**Concerns**\n\nThe 2030 FIFA World Cup has already been met with backlash from fans, football officials, and environmental groups. One of the main concerns is the large distance between South America and Europe, which would require considerable plane travel. This would increase the carbon footprint and negate FIFA's carbon neutral plans.\n\nAnother concern is the issue of fan accessibility, particularly for teams that would get drawn with Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Fans of these teams would face significant travel restrictions, which could impact their ability to attend matches.\n\nThe short amount of rest for players once those teams travel back to the main hosts in Iberia and Morocco has also raised concerns. This could lead to player fatigue and injuries, which could impact the overall quality of the tournament.\n\nFormer FIFA president Sepp Blatter has warned that the number of hosts in the 2030 FIFA World Cup would cause the tournament to \"lose its identity.\" This is because the tournament would be spread across multiple countries, which could lead to a lack of cohesion and unity among the participating teams.\n\n**Potential Venues**\n\nPrior to the finalizing of the bid book on 31 July, the Royal Spanish Football Federation announced its proposed 11 stadiums from 9 cities to host matches. The proposed stadiums include:\n\n* Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid\n* Camp Nou in Barcelona\n* Wanda Metropolitano in Madrid\n* Estadio Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid\n* Estadio La Cartuja in Seville\n* Estadio Riazor in A Coruña\n* Estadio El Molinón in Gijón\n* Estadio El Sadar in Pamplona\n* Estadio Ipurua in Eibar\n\nThe host city list was finalized 12 days later, including 6 stadia in 6 cities from Morocco, 3 stadia in 2 cities from Portugal, joining 11 stadia in 9 cities from Spain, for a total of 20 stadia in 17 cities.\n\n**Teams**\n\nAll six host nations will qualify for the World Cup. This is a change from previous World Cups, where only the top teams from each confederation qualified. The host nations will be guaranteed a spot in the tournament, regardless of their performance in the qualifying rounds.\n\n**Qualification**\n\nThe qualification process for the 2030 FIFA World Cup will follow the same format as previous World Cups. The top teams from each confederation will qualify for the tournament, with the host nations guaranteed a spot. The qualification process will begin in 2025, with the final spots decided by a series of matches and playoffs.\n\nThe qualification process will be overseen by FIFA, which will ensure that the tournament is conducted fairly and in accordance with the rules. The qualification process will also be subject to review and appeal, to ensure that the process is transparent and unbiased.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe 2030 FIFA World Cup is an exciting and unprecedented tournament that will feature 32 national teams competing for the championship. The tournament will be held in 2030 and will be the 23rd edition of the FIFA World Cup. The host selection process has raised concerns about sustainability and environmental considerations, as well as fan accessibility and player fatigue.

\"beaten to death by another man's hands .. outside of  [her] restaurant\", and began encouraging the restaurant's servers to carry guns openly [25] [20] [26] That is mostly false: in 2013, a man who had reportedly engaged in a fight blocks away ran to within about a block of Boebert's restaurant, fell, and died from a methamphetamine overdose [26] [27] [28] The Boeberts also owned a restaurant called Smokehouse 1776 (now defunct), across the street from Shooters Grill [29] In 2015, Boebert opened Putters restaurant on Rifle Creek Golf Course, [30] which she sold in December 2016 [31]

[103]\n\n\n2022\nIn August 2021, the FEC investigated the apparent use of more than $6,000 from Boebert's 2022 reelection campaign funds for her personal expenses [80] The funds were used between May

[83] During the primary, her main challenger was Don Coram, a state senator who positioned himself as more moderate Boebert aimed to portray him as corrupt, in particular by alleging that he used his powers as a state legislator to pass laws legalizing hemp, which Coram grows (state voters approved the amendment legalizing marijuana in 2012), and as not Republican enough [84] [85] A Democratic-aligned Super PAC made false claims and unproven allegations about Boebert [86] [87] Boebert's attorney said in June that she would file a defamation lawsuit against the group, but she has

candidacy with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) on January 13, 2023 [104] After narrowly winning reelection in 2022, she attempted to rebrand her image with the voters in her district from a MAGA firebrand to a hard-working congresswoman [102] [105] In 2023, she blamed her narrow 2022 victory on \"'ballot harvesting' — a GOP term for third-party collection of absentee ballots — rather than what Democrats have called her 'MAGA extremism' and political charades\" while her press releases focused on local issues, including a \"$5 million grant for a rural health center in a spending package she voted against\" [106]\n\n\nTenure\nObservers describe Boebert as far-right; [6] she rejects the label [110]\n\n\nEfforts to impeach President Biden\nBoebert has twice attempted to impeach

next day, in the hours before the Capitol was attacked, she described the day's events as Republicans' \"1776 moment\", a reference to the American Revolutionary War [130] Boebert then told Speaker Nancy Pelosi that her constituents were outside the Capitol and that she had promised to represent their voices in the chamber [131] During a town hall in March, Boebert appeared to defend the January 6 attackers on the Capitol, saying, \"We already see in Washington, D.C You can't petition your government You're an insurrectionist if you do that!\", later claiming that the remarks were made \"in reference to the ongoing security measures in place around the Capitol complex\" [132]\n\n\nCertification of 2020 presidential election and Capitol attack\nOn January 5, 2021, the day before the

priorities is to eliminate critical race theory from schools, even though it is not part of the K-12 Colorado Academic Standards [152] [153] During a press conference, she asserted that it was a lie, that it was racist, [154] and that it would lead to children hating each other [155] Boebert opposes sex education in schools [156] Boebert supported Louisiana's order to display the Ten Commandments in public schools, as she commented in June 2024: \"This is something we need all throughout our nation … because we need morals back in our nation.\" [157]\n\n\nFirearms\nBoebert is a strong advocate of gun rights During her primary campaign, she voiced opposition to Colorado's recently enacted red flag law [24] [25] On January 1, 2021, in a letter co-signed by more than 80 Republicans, Boebert asked Speaker Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to uphold the 1967 law exempting members of Congress from a Capitol Hill ban on firearms, which allowed them to keep arms in their offices [158]\n\n\nImmigration\nBoebert sponsored H.R 6202, the American Tech Workforce Act of 2021, introduced by Representative Jim Banks The legislation would establish a wage floor for the high-skill H-1B visa program, thereby significantly reducing employer dependence on the program The bill would also eliminate the Optional Practical Training program that allows foreign graduates to stay and work in the United States [165] [better source needed]\n\n\nSupport for conspiracy theories\nBoebert has embraced the QAnon conspiracy theory [166] During a March 15, 2021, town hall in Montrose, Colorado, advertised only to local Republicans who were asked to not disclose it publicly, she was asked when Hillary Clinton and other former officials would be arrested, a recurring theme of QAnon She responded that she knew someone involved with documents declassified by Trump during the closing days of his presidency, and that the documents would reveal corruption that would trigger resignations that would allow Republicans to retake the House and Senate before 2022, echoing a theory promoted by The Epoch Times Boebert urged people to dismiss comments about the outlet's unreliability and said the information came from \"very good sources\" [167] [168] [169]\n\n\nComments on representatives of other religions\nIn September 2021, Boebert told attendees at a Republican fundraiser that she and an aide were joined by Democratic representative Ilhan Omar on a Capitol elevator and that Boebert then said to her aide, \"it's the Jihad Squad .. She doesn't have a backpack, she wasn't dropping it and running so we're good\" [172] Also that month, Boebert called Omar \"a full-time propagandist for Hamas\" and an \"honorary member of Hamas\" [172] During a November 18, 2021, speech on the House floor, Boebert called Omar \"the Jihad Squad member from Minnesota\" [173] At a November 20 event, she repeated the elevator story, this time including a Capitol Police officer with \"fret all over his face\" [174] [172] Omar responded that the story was invented and that \"Anti-Muslim bigotry isn't funny and shouldn't be normalized\" Boebert later apologized \"to anyone in the Muslim community I offended with my comment about Representative Omar\" [172] [175] After Boebert and Omar spoke by phone, both said the call went badly, with Boebert saying that she would put \"America first, never sympathizing with terrorists Unfortunately, Ilhan can't say the same thing.\" [176] The Denver Post apologized on Boebert's behalf for her remarks, saying that it was embarrassing that a Colorado representative engaged in such behavior [177]\n\n\nEconomy\nDuring her 2020 campaign, Boebert pledged that she would not support any federal budget that resulted in additional debt [42] and that she would support a balanced budget amendment to the U.S Constitution [180] She opposes any tax increases [181] While expressing support for more defense expenditure, Boebert was one of 75 House Republicans to vote against the National Defense Authorization Act of 2022, [182] saying the bill had a \"woke agenda\" [183]\n\n\nEnvironment\nBoebert has supported the energy industry [32] [77] During her campaign, she said she supported \"all-of-the-above energy, but the markets decide .. not the government\" [186] She declared support for uranium extraction and the generation of nuclear power, touting it as the \"cleanest form of energy\" [187] In February 2021, Boebert proposed a bill to ban executive moratoriums on oil and gas leases and permits on some federal lands [77] She also proposed amendments to the Build Back Better Act that would abolish methane-emission payments by fracking companies and others that would increase royalties for oil and gas extraction on federal lands and abolish fines and financial requirements for cleaning abandoned drilling infrastructure [188] Conversely, Boebert opposes sustainable energy initiatives because she considers green energy unreliable and believes that decreasing the extraction of fossil fuels in her district will \"regulate our communities into poverty\" [189] She opposes the Green New Deal, [which?] claiming it would cost $93 trillion to implement and would bankrupt the country [190] [b] Boebert also opposes the participation of the United States in the Paris Agreement, calling it \"job-killing\", and introduced a bill the day after Biden's inauguration seeking to block re-entrance of the country to the agreement by forcing its ratification in the Senate by a two-thirds supermajority and prohibiting the use of federal funds for reaching the agreement's goals [192]\n\n\nForeign policy\nBoebert was one of 14 House Republicans, most of them members of the Freedom Caucus, to vote against a measure condemning the Myanmar coup d'état that passed overwhelmingly [196] She cited concern about a passage that urged social media platforms to prevent disinformation and violence, which she said was tantamount to making Big Tech the \"arbiter of truth\" [197]\n\n\nHealth care\nDuring her primary campaign, Boebert argued for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, [207] and opposed the introduction of a single-payer healthcare system, saying it would harm small businesses like hers because of the prohibitive cost [208] After the election, she said she was undecided about whether it was best to keep or repeal Obamacare, but wished that a more market-based system would be adopted [187] During her tenure in Congress, she was one of two representatives (the other was Marjorie Taylor Greene) to vote against the TRANSPLANT Act, which reauthorized the National Marrow Donor Program through 2026, citing concern over the addition of the program to the national debt as it had not received a Congressional Budget Office evaluation [209]\n\n\nCOVID-19 policies\nBoebert opposes mitigation policies seeking to reduce COVID-19's spread She has called the vaccine mandates unconstitutional [83] and in particular opposed them for the military [183] She compared the federal government's COVID-19 vaccination efforts to \"Biden  [deploying] his Needle Nazis\", [210] [211] and accused Anthony Fauci, who told people to overcome their political opposition and get the COVID-19 vaccine, of bullying [212] Boebert also alleged that there was a deliberate effort to introduce immigrants who would substitute the unvaccinated people [213] In June 2021, Boebert advised her constituents in Mesa County, who were experiencing an uptick of Delta variant cases at the time, that the \"easiest way to make the Delta variant go away is to turn off CNN  [and] vote Republican\", but has since deleted the tweet amid public criticism [214] [215] She has also compared the virus to communism [216]\n\n\nFentanyl\nIn June 2022, Boebert introduced a bill to classify the opioid fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction [225] A Congressional Research Service report released in March stated that \"formally designating fentanyl as  [a weapon of mass destruction] may not be necessary for additional executive branch action\" but that Congress could consider legislation to \"address 'perceived shortcomings'.\" [226]\n\n\nLGBT rights\nBoebert opposes the Equality Act, saying it promotes \"supremacy of gays\" and says transgender women take scholarships and sports opportunities away from cis women [227] [228] She opposes same-sex marriage, writing on her campaign website that she opposes \"efforts to redefine marriage as anything other than the union of one man and one woman\" [229] She introduced a bill to ban federal funding of research and publications into transgender health care for minors, asserting that they are being \"sexualized and used for horrific sexual 'research'\" when being administered puberty blockers [230] In 2022, she cosponsored two bills widely seen as anti-LGBT legislation The first, introduced by Marjorie Taylor Greene, would criminalize providing sex reassignment surgery and other forms of transgender health care to minors; the second was the Stop the Sexualization of Children Act, introduced by Mike Johnson, which would prohibit federally funded institutions from promoting or instructing on LGBT issues or sexual orientation and is widely seen as a national version of Florida Parental Rights in Education Act [231] [232]\n\n\nAbortion and Planned Parenthood\nBoebert opposes comprehensive sex education, abortion, and federal funding of Planned Parenthood [25]\n\n\nSeparation of church and state\nBoebert promotes the ideals of Christian nationalism [233] [234] [235] In June 2022, she told a church audience, \"The church is supposed to direct the government The government is not supposed to direct the church That is not how our Founding Fathers intended it And I am tired of this separation of church and state junk It's not in the Constitution.\" [8] [236] Boebert's office asserted she was not expressing support of Christian theocracy [237] Experts said her statement is contrary to the Constitution's Establishment Clause [238] [239] [240]\n\n\nPersonal life\nBoebert lived with her husband, Jayson Boebert, in Silt, Colorado [243] They have four sons [25] and one grandson [244] Her mother \"inspired me to be a mother when I was 18 years old.\" [156] Jayson worked in the oil and gas industry prior to opening their restaurant, Shooters Grill, and continued working in that industry even after opening the restaurant [18] [245]\n\n\nLegal issues\nIn 2015, Boebert was detained at a music festival for shouting at a group of people arrested for underage drinking, yelling that the arrest was unconstitutional because they had not received Miranda warnings Deputies reported she \"encouraged people arrested for underage drinking to break free and repeatedly said she had 'friends at Fox News' who would report on her subsequent 'illegal arrest'\" She was cited for misdemeanor disorderly conduct and twice failed to appear in court on the charge The charge was later dismissed because the Mesa County district attorney's office believed there was no reasonable likelihood of conviction if the case went to trial [250] [251]\n\n\nElectoral history\n\n\n2020 election cycle\n\n\n2022 election cycle\n\n\n2024 election

man was \"beaten to death by another man's hands .. outside of  [her] restaurant\", and began encouraging the restaurant's servers to carry guns openly [25] [20] [26] That is mostly false: in 2013, a man who had reportedly engaged in a fight blocks away ran to within about a block of Boebert's restaurant, fell, and died from a methamphetamine overdose [26] [27] [28] The Boeberts also owned a restaurant called Smokehouse 1776 (now defunct), across the street from Shooters Grill [29] In 2015, Boebert opened Putters restaurant on Rifle Creek Golf Course, [30] which she sold in December 2016 [31] Shooters Grill, according to her congressional disclosure forms, lost $143,000 in 2019 and $226,000 in 2020 [32]\n\n\nU.S. House of Representatives\nIn September 2019, Boebert made national headlines when she confronted Beto O'Rourke, a candidate in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, at an Aurora town hall meeting over his proposal for a buy-back program and a ban on assault-style rifles like AR-15s [41] [42] [23] [43] Later that month, she opposed a measure banning guns in city-owned buildings at a meeting of the Aspen City Council [44] [43] The ordinance passed unanimously a month later [45]\n\n\nElections\nIn September 2019, Boebert made national headlines when she confronted Beto O'Rourke, a candidate in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, at an Aurora town hall

did not cross-examine Frisch, proposed more oil and gas development to respond to climate change, and continuously attacked House speaker Nancy Pelosi [96] [97] Boebert defeated Frisch by a small margin in a closer than expected race The margin was so close it triggered an automatic recount [98] [99] [100] The recount was completed on December 12 and affirmed that Boebert won by 546 votes out of 327,000 [101] [102] [103]\n\n\n2022\nIn August 2021, the FEC investigated the apparent use of more than $6,000 from Boebert's 2022 reelection campaign funds for her personal expenses [80] The funds were used between May and June 2021 via four Venmo payments [80] Boebert's communications director said that these were indeed personal expenses, \"billed to the campaign account in error\", and that the \"reimbursement has already happened\" [80] In September 2021, Boebert submitted documents to the FEC declaring that the campaign money had been used to settle rental and utilities bills, and had since been reimbursed [81] [82]\n\n\nUse of campaign funds for personal expenses\nIn August 2021, the FEC investigated the apparent use of more than $6,000 from Boebert's 2022 reelection campaign

2022 election [83] During the primary, her main challenger was Don Coram, a state senator who positioned himself as more moderate Boebert aimed to portray him as corrupt, in particular by alleging that he used his powers as a state legislator to pass laws legalizing hemp, which Coram grows (state voters approved the amendment legalizing marijuana in 2012), and as not Republican enough [84] [85] A Democratic-aligned Super PAC made false claims and unproven allegations about Boebert [86] [87] Boebert's attorney said in June that she would file a defamation lawsuit against the group, but she has not done so The temporary restraining order she obtained on June 23 against David Wheeler, one of its co-founders, [88] was vacated in July and the case dismissed [87]\n\n\nGeneral election\nIn a

candidacy with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) on January 13, 2023 [104] After narrowly winning reelection in 2022, she attempted to rebrand her image with the voters in her district from a MAGA firebrand to a hard-working congresswoman [102] [105] In 2023, she blamed her narrow 2022 victory on \"'ballot harvesting' — a GOP term for third-party collection of absentee ballots — rather than what Democrats have called her 'MAGA extremism' and political charades\" while her press releases focused on local issues, including a \"$5 million grant for a rural health center in a spending package she voted against\" [106]\n\n\nTenure\nObservers describe Boebert as far-right; [6] she rejects the label [110]\n\n\nEfforts to impeach President Biden\nBoebert has twice attempted to impeach President Biden In September 2021, she submitted a resolution to impeach him and another to impeach Vice President Kamala Harris over the withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan [122] [123] [124]\n\n\nCommittee assignments\nFor the 118th Congress: [126]\n\n\nCaucus memberships\nBoebert is a member of the following Congressional caucuses: [127]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nOn January 5, 2021, the day before the storming of the United States Capitol, Boebert urged people to \"remember these next 48 hours\", saying they would be among the most important in American history [129] The next day, in the hours before the Capitol was attacked, she described the day's events as Republicans' \"1776 moment\", a reference to the American Revolutionary War [130] Boebert then told Speaker Nancy Pelosi that her constituents were outside the Capitol and that she had promised to represent their voices in the chamber [131] During a town hall in March, Boebert appeared to defend the January 6 attackers on the Capitol, saying, \"We already see in Washington, D.C You can't petition your government You're an insurrectionist if you do that!\", later claiming that the remarks were made \"in reference to the ongoing security measures in place around the Capitol complex\" [132]\n\n\nCertification of 2020 presidential election and Capitol attack\nOn January 5, 2021, the day before the storming of the United States Capitol, Boebert urged people to \"remember these next 48 hours\", saying they would be among the most important in American history [129] The next day, in the hours

ongoing security measures in place around the Capitol complex\" [132]\n\n\nEducation\nBoebert supports eliminating the U.S Department of Education [42] She has said that one of her top legislative priorities is to eliminate critical race theory from schools, even though it is not part of the K-12 Colorado Academic Standards [152] [153] During a press conference, she asserted that it was a lie, that it was racist, [154] and that it would lead to children hating each other [155] Boebert opposes sex education in schools [156] Boebert supported Louisiana's order to display the Ten Commandments in public schools, as she commented in June 2024: \"This is something we need all throughout our nation … because we need morals back in our nation.\" [157]\n\n\nFirearms\nBoebert is a strong advocate of gun rights During her primary campaign, she voiced opposition to Colorado's recently enacted red flag law [24] [25] On January 1, 2021, in a letter co-signed by more than 80 Republicans, Boebert asked Speaker Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to uphold the 1967 law exempting members of Congress from a Capitol Hill ban on firearms, which allowed them to keep arms in their offices [158]\n\n\nImmigration\nBoebert sponsored H.R 6202, the American Tech Workforce Act of 2021, introduced by Representative Jim Banks The legislation would establish a wage floor for the high-skill H-1B visa program, thereby significantly reducing employer dependence on the program The bill would also eliminate the Optional Practical Training program that allows foreign graduates to stay and work in the United States [165] [better source needed]\n\n\nSupport for conspiracy theories\nBoebert has embraced the QAnon conspiracy theory [166] During a March 15, 2021, town hall in Montrose, Colorado, advertised only to local Republicans who were asked to not disclose it publicly, she was asked when Hillary Clinton and other former officials would be arrested, a recurring theme of QAnon She responded that she knew someone involved with documents declassified by Trump during the closing days of his presidency, and that the documents would reveal corruption that would trigger resignations that would allow Republicans to retake the House and Senate before 2022, echoing a theory promoted by The Epoch Times Boebert urged people to dismiss comments about the outlet's unreliability and said the information came from \"very good sources\" [167] [168] [169]\n\n\nComments on representatives of other religions\nIn September 2021, Boebert told attendees at a Republican fundraiser that she and an aide were joined by Democratic representative Ilhan Omar on a Capitol elevator and that Boebert then said to her aide, \"it's the Jihad Squad .. She doesn't have a backpack, she wasn't dropping it and running so we're good\" [172] Also that month, Boebert called Omar \"a full-time propagandist for Hamas\" and an \"honorary member of Hamas\" [172] During a November 18, 2021, speech on the House floor, Boebert called Omar \"the Jihad Squad member from Minnesota\" [173] At a November 20 event, she repeated the elevator story, this time including a Capitol Police officer with \"fret all over his face\" [174] [172] Omar responded that the story was invented and that \"Anti-Muslim bigotry isn't funny and shouldn't be normalized\" Boebert later apologized \"to anyone in the Muslim community I offended with my comment about Representative Omar\" [172] [175] After Boebert and Omar spoke by phone, both said the call went badly, with Boebert saying that she would put \"America first, never sympathizing with terrorists Unfortunately, Ilhan can't say the same thing.\" [176] The Denver Post apologized on Boebert's behalf for her remarks, saying that it was embarrassing that a Colorado representative engaged in such behavior [177]\n\n\nEconomy\nDuring her 2020 campaign, Boebert pledged that she would not support any federal budget that resulted in additional debt [42] and that she would support a balanced budget amendment to the U.S Constitution [180] She opposes any tax increases [181] While expressing support for more defense expenditure, Boebert was one of 75 House Republicans to vote against the National Defense Authorization Act of 2022, [182] saying the bill had a \"woke agenda\" [183]\n\n\nEnvironment\nBoebert has supported the energy industry [32] [77] During her campaign, she said she supported \"all-of-the-above energy, but the markets decide .. not the government\" [186] She declared support for uranium extraction and the generation of nuclear power, touting it as the \"cleanest form of energy\" [187] In February 2021, Boebert proposed a bill to ban executive moratoriums on oil and gas leases and permits on some federal lands [77] She also proposed amendments to the Build Back Better Act that would abolish methane-emission payments by fracking companies and others that would increase royalties for oil and gas extraction on federal lands and abolish fines and financial requirements for cleaning abandoned drilling infrastructure [188] Conversely, Boebert opposes sustainable energy initiatives because she considers green energy unreliable and believes that decreasing the extraction of fossil fuels in her district will \"regulate our communities into poverty\" [189] She opposes the Green New Deal, [which?] claiming it would cost $93 trillion to implement and would bankrupt the country [190] [b] Boebert also opposes the participation of the United States in the Paris Agreement, calling it \"job-killing\", and introduced a bill the day after Biden's inauguration seeking to block re-entrance of the country to the agreement by forcing its ratification in the Senate by a two-thirds supermajority and prohibiting the use of federal funds for reaching the agreement's goals [192]\n\n\nForeign policy\nBoebert was one of 14 House Republicans, most of them members of the Freedom Caucus, to vote against a measure condemning the Myanmar coup d'état that passed overwhelmingly [196] She cited concern about a passage that urged social media platforms to prevent disinformation and violence, which she said was tantamount to making Big Tech the \"arbiter of truth\" [197]\n\n\nHealth care\nDuring her primary campaign, Boebert argued for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, [207] and opposed the introduction of a single-payer healthcare system, saying it would harm small businesses like hers because of the prohibitive cost [208] After the election, she said she was undecided about whether it was best to keep or repeal Obamacare, but wished that a more market-based system would be adopted [187] During her tenure in Congress, she was one of two representatives (the other was Marjorie Taylor Greene) to vote against the TRANSPLANT Act, which reauthorized the National Marrow Donor Program through 2026, citing concern over the addition of the program to the national debt as it had not received a Congressional Budget Office evaluation [209]\n\n\nCOVID-19 policies\nBoebert opposes mitigation policies seeking to reduce COVID-19's spread She has called the vaccine mandates unconstitutional [83] and in particular opposed them for the military [183] She compared the federal government's COVID-19 vaccination efforts to \"Biden  [deploying] his Needle Nazis\", [210] [211] and accused Anthony Fauci, who told people to overcome their political opposition and get the COVID-19 vaccine, of bullying [212] Boebert also alleged that there was a deliberate effort to introduce immigrants who would substitute the unvaccinated people [213] In June 2021, Boebert advised her constituents in Mesa County, who were experiencing an uptick of Delta variant cases at the time, that the \"easiest way to make the Delta variant go away is to turn off CNN  [and] vote Republican\", but has since deleted the tweet amid public criticism [214] [215] She has also compared the virus to communism [216]\n\n\nFentanyl\nIn June 2022, Boebert introduced a bill to classify the opioid fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction [225] A Congressional Research Service report released in March stated that \"formally designating fentanyl as  [a weapon of mass destruction] may not be necessary for additional executive branch action\" but that Congress could consider legislation to \"address 'perceived shortcomings'.\" [226]\n\n\nLGBT rights\nBoebert opposes the Equality Act, saying it promotes \"supremacy of gays\" and says transgender women take scholarships and sports opportunities away from cis women [227] [228] She opposes same-sex marriage, writing on her campaign website that she opposes \"efforts to redefine marriage as anything other than the union of one man and one woman\" [229] She introduced a bill to ban federal funding of research and publications into transgender health care for minors, asserting that they are being \"sexualized and used for horrific sexual 'research'\" when being administered puberty blockers [230] In 2022, she cosponsored two bills widely seen as anti-LGBT legislation The first, introduced by Marjorie Taylor Greene, would criminalize providing sex reassignment surgery and other forms of transgender health care to minors; the second was the Stop the Sexualization of Children Act, introduced by Mike Johnson, which would prohibit federally funded institutions from promoting or instructing on LGBT issues or sexual orientation and is widely seen as a national version of Florida Parental Rights in Education Act [231] [232]\n\n\nAbortion and Planned Parenthood\nBoebert opposes comprehensive sex education, abortion, and federal funding of Planned Parenthood [25]\n\n\nSeparation of church and state\nBoebert promotes the ideals of Christian nationalism [233] [234] [235] In June 2022, she told a church audience, \"The church is supposed to direct the government The government is not supposed to direct the church That is not how our Founding Fathers intended it And I am tired of this separation of church and state junk It's not in the Constitution.\" [8] [236] Boebert's office asserted she was not expressing support of Christian theocracy [237] Experts said her statement is contrary to the Constitution's Establishment Clause [238] [239] [240]\n\n\nPersonal life\nBoebert lived with her husband, Jayson Boebert, in Silt, Colorado [243] They have four sons [25] and one grandson [244] Her mother \"inspired me to be a mother when I was 18 years old.\" [156] Jayson worked in the oil and gas industry prior to opening their restaurant, Shooters Grill, and continued working in that industry even after opening the restaurant [18] [245]\n\n\nLegal issues\nIn 2015, Boebert was detained at a music festival for shouting at a group of people arrested for underage drinking, yelling that the arrest was unconstitutional because they had not received Miranda warnings Deputies reported she \"encouraged people arrested for underage drinking to break free and repeatedly said she had 'friends at Fox News' who would report on her subsequent 'illegal arrest'\" She was cited for misdemeanor disorderly conduct and twice failed to appear in court on the charge The charge was later dismissed because the Mesa County district attorney's office believed there was no reasonable likelihood of conviction if the case went to trial [250] [251]\n\n\nElectoral history\n\n\n2020 election cycle\n\n\n2022 election cycle\n\n\n2024 election

{"title": "Catherine_the_Great", "content": "\nEarly life\nCatherine was born on 2 May 1729 in Stettin, Province of Pomerania, Kingdom of Prussia, as Princess Sophia Augusta Frederica (Sophie Auguste Friederike) von Anhalt-Zerbst-Dornburg [2] Her mother was Joanna Elisabeth of Holstein-Gottorp Her father, Christian August, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst, belonged to the ruling German family of Anhalt [3] He failed to become the duke of the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia and, at the time of his daughter's birth, he held the rank of a Prussian general in his capacity as governor of the city of Stettin However, because her second cousin Peter III converted to Orthodox Christianity, her mother's brother became the heir to the Swedish throne [4] and two of her first cousins, Gustav III and Charles XIII, became Kings of Sweden [5] In accordance with the prevailing custom among the ruling dynasties of Germany, she received her education chiefly from a French governess and from tutors According to her memoirs, Sophie was considered a tomboy and trained herself to master a sword.\n\n\nMarriage and reign of Peter III\nThe choice of Sophie as wife of the future tsar was a result of the Lopukhina affair, in which Count Jean Armand de Lestocq and King Frederick the Great of Prussia took an active part The objective was to strengthen the friendship between Prussia and Russia, to weaken the influence of Austria, and to overthrow the chancellor Alexey Bestuzhev-Ryumin, a known partisan of the Austrian alliance on whom the reigning Russian Empress Elizabeth relied The diplomatic intrigue failed, largely due to the intervention of Sophie's mother, Joanna Elisabeth of Holstein-Gottorp [11]\n\n\nReign (1762–1796)\nCatherine was crowned at the Assumption Cathedral in Moscow on 22 September 1762 [29] Her coronation marks the creation of one of the main treasures of the Romanov dynasty, the Great Imperial Crown of Russia, designed by Swiss-French court diamond jeweller Jérémie Pauzié Inspired by Byzantine design, the crown was constructed of two half spheres, one gold and one silver, representing the Eastern and Western Roman Empires, divided by a foliate garland and fastened with a low hoop [30]\n\n\nCoronation (1762)\nCatherine was crowned at the Assumption Cathedral in Moscow on 22 September 1762 [29] Her coronation marks the creation of one of the main treasures of the Romanov dynasty, the Great Imperial Crown of Russia, designed by Swiss-French court diamond jeweller Jérémie Pauzié Inspired by Byzantine design, the crown was constructed of two half spheres, one gold and one silver, representing the Eastern and Western Roman Empires, divided by a foliate garland and fastened with a low hoop [30]\n\n\nForeign affairs\nDuring her reign, Catherine extended the borders of the Russian Empire by some 520,000 square kilometres (200,000 sq mi), absorbing New Russia, Crimea, the North Caucasus, right-bank Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, and Courland at the expense, mainly, of two powers—the Ottoman Empire and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth [32]\n\n\nRusso-Turkish Wars\nPeter the Great had gained a foothold in the south, on the edge of the Black Sea, during the Azov campaigns Catherine completed the conquest of the south, making Russia the dominant power in the Balkans following the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774 Russia inflicted some of the heaviest defeats ever suffered by the Ottoman Empire, including at the Battle of Chesma (5–7 July 1770) and the Battle of Kagul (21 July 1770) In 1769, a last major Crimean–Nogai slave raid, which ravaged the Russian held territories in Ukraine, saw the capture of up to 20,000 slaves for the Crimean slave trade [35] [36]\n\n\nRusso-Persian War\nIn the Treaty of Georgievsk (1783), Russia agreed to protect Georgia against any new invasions and further political aspirations of their Persian suzerains Catherine waged a new war against Persia in 1796 after they, under the new king Agha Mohammad Khan, again invaded Georgia and established rule in 1795, expelling the newly established Russian garrisons in the Caucasus The ultimate goal for the Russian government, however, was to topple the anti-Russian shah (king), and to replace him with his pro-Russian half-brother Morteza Qoli Khan, who had defected to Russia [38] [39]\n\n\nRelations with Western Europe\nCatherine longed for recognition as an enlightened sovereign She refused the Duchy of Holstein-Gottorp, which had ports on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean and refrained from having a Russian army in Germany Instead, she pioneered for Russia the role that Britain later played through most of the 19th and early 20th centuries as an international mediator in disputes that could, or did, lead to war She acted as mediator in the War of the Bavarian Succession (1778–1779) between the German states of Prussia and Austria In 1780, she established a League of Armed Neutrality, designed to defend neutral shipping from being searched by the British Royal Navy during the American Revolutionary War.\n\n\nPartitions of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth\nIn 1764, Catherine placed Stanislaus Augustus Poniatowski, her former lover, on the Polish throne Although the idea of partitioning Poland came from Frederick II of Prussia, Catherine took a leading role in its execution in the 1790s In 1768, she formally became the protector of the political rights of dissidents and peasants of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, which provoked an anti-Russian uprising in Poland, the Confederation of Bar (1768–1772), supported by France After the rebels, their French and European volunteers, and their allied Ottoman Empire had been defeated, she established in the Commonwealth a system of government fully controlled by the Russian Empire through a Permanent Council, under the supervision of her ambassadors and envoys [43]\n\n\nRelations with China\nThe Qianlong Emperor of China was committed to an expansionist policy in Central Asia and saw the Russian Empire as a potential rival, making for difficult and unfriendly relations between Beijing and Saint Petersburg [45] In 1762, he unilaterally abrogated the Treaty of Kyakhta, which governed the caravan trade between the two empires [46] Another source of tension was the wave of Dzungar Mongol fugitives from the Qing Empire who took refuge with the Russians [47]\n\n\nRelations with Japan\nIn the Far East, Russians became active in fur trapping in Kamchatka and the Kuril Islands This spurred Russian interest in opening trade with Japan to the south for supplies and food In 1783, storms drove a Japanese sea captain, Daikokuya Kōdayū, ashore in the Aleutian Islands, at that time Russian territory Russian local authorities helped his party, and the Russian government decided to use him as a trade envoy On 28 June 1791, Catherine granted Daikokuya an audience at Tsarskoye Selo Subsequently, in 1792, the Russian government dispatched a trade mission to Japan, led by Adam Laxman The Tokugawa shogunate received the mission, but negotiations failed [48]\n\n\nThe evaluation of foreign policy\nNicholas I, her grandson, evaluated the foreign policy of Catherine the Great as a dishonest one [49] Catherine failed to reach any of the initial goals she had put forward Her foreign policy lacked a long-term strategy and from the very start was characterised by a series of mistakes She lost the large territories of the Russian protectorate of the Commonwealth of Poland and Lithuania and left its territories to Prussia and Austria The Commonwealth had become the Russian protectorate since the reign of Peter I, but he did not intervene into the problem of political freedoms of dissidents advocating for their religious freedoms only Catherine did turn Russia into a global great power, not only a European one, but with quite a different reputation from what she initially had planned as an honest policy The global trade of Russian natural resources and Russian grain provoked famines, starvation and fear of famines in Russia Her dynasty lost power because of this and of a war with Austria and Germany, impossible without her foreign policy [50]\n\n\nEconomics and finance\nRussian economic development was well below the standards in western Europe Historian François Cruzet writes that Russia under Catherine:\n\n\nPublic health\nCatherine made public health a priority She made use of the social theory ideas of German cameralism and French physiocracy, as well as Russian precedents and experiments such as foundling homes In 1764, she launched the Moscow Foundling Home and lying-in hospital In 1763, she opened Paul's Hospital, also known as Pavlovskaya Hospital She had the government collect and publish vital statistics In 1762, she called on the army to upgrade its medical services She established a centralised medical administration charged with initiating vigorous health policies Catherine decided to have herself inoculated against smallpox by English doctor Thomas Dimsdale While this was considered a controversial method at the time, she succeeded Her son Pavel later was inoculated as well [55]\n\n\nSerfs\nAccording to a census taken from 1754 to 1762, Catherine owned 500,000 serfs A further 2.8 million belonged to the Russian state [57]\n\n\nRights and conditions\nAt the time of Catherine's reign, the landowning noble class owned the serfs, who were bound to the land they tilled Children of serfs were born into serfdom and worked the same land their parents had Even before the rule of Catherine, serfs had very limited rights, but they were not exactly slaves While the state did not technically allow them to own possessions, some serfs were able to accumulate enough wealth to pay for their freedom [58] The understanding of law in Imperial Russia by all sections of society was often weak, confused, or nonexistent, particularly in the provinces where most serfs lived This is why some serfs were able to do things such as to accumulate wealth To become serfs, people conceded their freedoms to a landowner in exchange for their protection and support in times of hardship In addition, they received land to till, but were taxed a certain percentage of their crops to give to their landowners These were the privileges a serf was entitled to and that nobles were bound to carry out All of this was true before Catherine's reign, and this is the system she inherited.\n\n\nAttitudes towards Catherine\nThe attitude of the serfs toward their autocrat had historically been a positive one [65]\nHowever, if the empress' policies were too extreme or too disliked, she was not considered the true empress In these cases, it was necessary to replace this \"fake\" empress with the \"true\" empress, whoever she may be Because the serfs had no political power, they rioted to convey their message However, usually, if the serfs did not like the policies of the empress, they saw the nobles as corrupt and evil, preventing the people of Russia from communicating with the well-intentioned empress and misinterpreting her decrees [66] However, they were already suspicious of Catherine upon her accession because she had annulled an act by Peter III that essentially freed the serfs belonging to the Orthodox Church [67] Naturally, the serfs did not like it when Catherine tried to take away their right to petition her because they felt as though she had severed their connection to the autocrat, and their power to appeal to her Far away from the capital, they were confused as to the circumstances of her accession to the throne [68]\n\n\nArts and culture\nCatherine was a patron of the arts, literature, and education The Hermitage Museum, which now [update] occupies the whole Winter Palace, began as Catherine's personal collection The empress was a great lover of art and books, and ordered the construction of the Hermitage in 1770 to house her expanding collection of paintings, sculpture, and books [72] By 1790, the Hermitage was home to 38,000 books, 10,000 gems and 10,000 drawings Two wings were devoted to her collections of \"curiosities\" [73]\n\n\nEducation\nCatherine held western European philosophies and culture close to her heart, and she wanted to surround herself with like-minded people within Russia [90] She believed a 'new kind of person' could be created by inculcating Russian children with European education Catherine believed education could change the hearts and minds of the Russian people and turn them away from backwardness This meant developing individuals both intellectually and morally, providing them knowledge and skills, and fostering a sense of civic responsibility Her goal was to modernise education across Russia [91]\n\n\nReligious affairs\nCatherine's apparent embrace of all things Russian (including Orthodoxy) may have prompted her personal indifference to religion She nationalised all of the church lands to help pay for her wars, largely emptied the monasteries, and forced most of the remaining clergymen to survive as farmers or from fees for baptisms and other services Very few members of the nobility entered the church, which became even less important than it had been She did not allow dissenters to build chapels, and she suppressed religious dissent after the onset of the French Revolution [106]\n\n\nIslam\nCatherine took many different approaches to Islam during her reign She avoided force and tried persuasion (and money) to integrate Muslim areas into her empire [109] Between 1762 and 1773, Muslims were prohibited from owning any Orthodox serfs They were pressured into Orthodoxy through monetary incentives Catherine promised more serfs of all religions, as well as amnesty for convicts, if Muslims chose to convert to Orthodoxy However, the Legislative Commission of 1767 offered several seats to people professing the Islamic faith This commission promised to protect their religious rights, but did not do so Many Orthodox peasants felt threatened by the sudden change, and burned mosques as a sign of their displeasure [citation needed]\n\n\nJudaism\nRussia often treated Judaism as a separate entity, where Jews were maintained with a separate legal and bureaucratic system Although the government knew that Judaism existed, Catherine and her advisers had no real definition of what a Jew is because the term meant many things during her reign [112] Judaism was a small, if not non-existent, religion in Russia until 1772 When Catherine agreed to the First Partition of Poland, the large new Jewish element was treated as a separate people, defined by their religion Catherine separated the Jews from Orthodox society, restricting them to the Pale of Settlement She levied additional taxes on the followers of Judaism; if a family converted to the Orthodox faith, that additional tax was lifted [113] Jewish members of society were required to pay double the tax of their Orthodox neighbours Converted Jews could gain permission to enter the merchant class and farm as free peasants under Russian rule [114] [115]\n\n\nRussian Orthodoxy\nIn many ways, the Orthodox Church fared no better than its foreign counterparts during the reign of Catherine Under her leadership, she completed what Peter III had started The church's lands were expropriated, and the budget of both monasteries and bishoprics were controlled by the Collegium of Accounting [119] Endowments from the government replaced income from privately held lands The endowments were often much less than the original intended amount [120] She closed 569 of 954 monasteries, of which only 161 received government money Only 400,000 roubles of church wealth were paid back [121] While other religions (such as Islam) received invitations to the Legislative Commission, the Orthodox clergy did not receive a single seat [120] Their place in government was restricted severely during the years of Catherine's reign [106]\n\n\nPersonal life\nCatherine, throughout her long reign, took many lovers, often elevating them to high positions for as long as they held her interest and then pensioning them off with gifts of serfs and large estates [126] [127] The percentage of state money spent on the court increased from 10% in 1767 to 11% in 1781 to 14% in 1795 Catherine gave away 66,000 serfs from 1762 to 1772, 202,000 from 1773 to 1793, and 100,000 in one day: 18 August 1795 [128]: 119  Catherine bought the support of the bureaucracy In 1767, Catherine decreed that after seven years in one rank, civil servants automatically would be promoted regardless of office or merit [129]\n\n\nPoniatowski\nSir Charles Hanbury Williams, the British ambassador to Russia, offered Stanisław Poniatowski a place in the embassy in return for gaining Catherine as an ally Poniatowski, through his mother's side, came from the Czartoryski family, prominent members of the pro-Russian faction in Poland; Poniatowski and Catherine were eighth cousins, twice removed, by their mutual ancestor King Christian I of Denmark, by virtue of Poniatowski's maternal descent from the Scottish House of Stuart Catherine, 26 years old and already married to the then-Grand Duke Peter for some 10 years, met the 22-year-old Poniatowski in 1755, well before encountering the Orlov brothers They had a daughter named Anna Petrovna in December 1757 (not to be confused with Grand Duchess Anna Petrovna of Russia, the daughter of Peter I's second marriage), although she was legally regarded as Grand Duke Peter's [134]\n\n\nOrlov\nGrigory Orlov, the grandson of a rebel in the Streltsy uprising (1698) against Peter the Great, distinguished himself in the Battle of Zorndorf (25 August 1758), receiving three wounds He represented an opposite to Peter's pro-Prussian sentiment, with which Catherine disagreed By 1759, he and Catherine had become lovers; no one told Catherine's husband, Peter Catherine saw Orlov as very useful, and he became instrumental in the 28 June 1762 coup d'état against her husband, but she preferred to remain the dowager empress of Russia rather than marrying anyone.\n\n\nPotemkin\nGrigory Potemkin was involved in the palace coup of 1762 In 1772, Catherine's close friends informed her of Orlov's affairs with other women, and she dismissed him By the winter of 1773, the Pugachev revolt had started to threaten Catherine's son Paul had started gaining support; both of these trends threatened her power She called Potemkin for help—mostly military—and he became devoted to her.\n\n\nFinal months and death\nCatherine's life and reign included many personal successes, but they ended in two failures Her Swedish cousin (once removed), King Gustav IV Adolf, visited her in September 1796, the empress's intention being that her granddaughter Alexandra should become queen of Sweden by marriage A ball was given at the imperial court on 11 September when the engagement was supposed to be announced Gustav Adolph felt pressured to accept that Alexandra would not convert to Lutheranism, and though he was delighted by the young lady, he refused to appear at the ball and left for Stockholm The frustration affected Catherine's health She recovered well enough to begin to plan a ceremony which would establish her favourite grandson Alexander as her heir, superseding her difficult son Paul, but she died before the announcement could be made, just over two months after the engagement ball [137]\n\n\nIssue\nThe Manifesto

"**Catherine the Great**\n\nCatherine the Great, born Sophie Friederike Auguste von Anhalt-Zerbst-Dornburg, was the Empress of Russia from 1762 until her death in 1796. She is considered one of the most influential and successful leaders in Russian history, known for her expansion of the Russian Empire, her patronage of the arts and education, and her reforms of the Russian government and society.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nCatherine was born on May 2, 1729, in Stettin, Province of Pomerania, Kingdom of Prussia, as Princess Sophia Augusta Frederica (Sophie Auguste Friederike) von Anhalt-Zerbst-Dornburg. Her mother was Joanna Elisabeth of Holstein-Gottorp, and her father, Christian August, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst, belonged to the ruling German family of Anhalt. He failed to become the duke of the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia and, at the time of his daughter's birth, he held the rank of a Prussian general in his capacity as governor of the city of Stettin. Catherine's early life was marked by a strict education, which included French and German tutors. She was considered a tomboy and trained herself to master a sword.\n\n**Marriage and Reign of Peter III**\n\nIn 1745, Catherine was selected to marry the future Tsar Peter III, a grandson of Peter the Great. The choice of Catherine was a result of the Lopukhina affair, in which Count Jean Armand de Lestocq and King Frederick the Great of Prussia took an active part. The objective was to strengthen the friendship between Prussia and Russia, to weaken the influence of Austria, and to overthrow the chancellor Alexey Bestuzhev-Ryumin, a known partisan of the Austrian alliance on whom the reigning Russian Empress Elizabeth relied. In 1745, Catherine and Peter III married, and Catherine was baptized into the Russian Orthodox Church, taking the name Ekaterina Alekseyevna.\n\n**Reign (1762–1796)**\n\nCatherine was crowned at the Assumption Cathedral in Moscow on September 22, 1762, after the death of her husband Peter III. Her coronation marks the creation of one of the main treasures of the Romanov dynasty, the Great Imperial Crown of Russia, designed by Swiss-French court diamond jeweller Jérémie Pauzié.\n\n**Coronation (1762)**\n\nCatherine was crowned at the Assumption Cathedral in Moscow on September 22, 1762, marking the beginning of her reign.\n\n**Foreign Affairs**\n\nDuring her reign, Catherine extended the borders of the Russian Empire by some 520,000 square kilometers (200,000 square miles), absorbing New Russia, Crimea, the North Caucasus, right-bank Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, and Courland at the expense, mainly, of two powers—the Ottoman Empire and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.\n\n**Russo-Turkish Wars**\n\nCatherine completed the conquest of the south, making Russia the dominant power in the Balkans following the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774. Russia inflicted some of the heaviest defeats ever suffered by the Ottoman Empire, including at the Battle of Chesma (5–7 July 1770) and the Battle of Kagul (21 July 1770).\n\n**Russo-Persian War**\n\nIn the Treaty of Georgievsk (1783), Russia agreed to protect Georgia against any new invasions and further political aspirations of their Persian suzerains. Catherine waged a new war against Persia in 1796 after they, under the new king Agha Mohammad Khan, again invaded Georgia and established rule in 1795, expelling the newly established Russian garrisons in the Caucasus.\n\n**Relations with Western Europe**\n\nCatherine longed for recognition as an enlightened sovereign and refused the Duchy of Holstein-Gottorp, which had ports on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean and refrained from having a Russian army in Germany. She pioneered for Russia the role that Britain later played through most of the 19th and early 20th centuries as an international mediator in disputes that could, or did, lead to war.\n\n**Partitions of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth**\n\nIn 1764, Catherine placed Stanislaus Augustus Poniatowski, her former lover, on the Polish throne. Although the idea of partitioning Poland came from Frederick II of Prussia, Catherine took a leading role in its execution in the 1790s.\n\n**Relations with China**\n\nThe Qianlong Emperor of China was committed to an expansionist policy in Central Asia and saw the Russian Empire as a potential rival, making for difficult and unfriendly relations between Beijing and Saint Petersburg.\n\n**Relations with Japan**\n\nIn the Far East, Russians became active in fur trapping in Kamchatka and the Kuril Islands, which spurred Russian interest in opening trade with Japan to the south for supplies and food. Catherine granted Daikokuya Kōdayū, a Japanese sea captain, an audience at Tsarskoye Selo in 1791.\n\n**Economics and Finance**\n\nRussian economic development was well below the standards in western Europe. Historian François Cruzet writes that Russia under Catherine was characterized by a lack of development in trade, industry, and agriculture.\n\n**Public Health**\n\nCatherine made public health a priority and made use of the social theory ideas of German cameralism and French physiocracy, as well as Russian precedents and experiments such as foundling homes. She launched the Moscow Foundling Home and lying-in hospital in 1764 and had the government collect and publish vital statistics.\n\n**Serfs**\n\nAt the time of Catherine's reign, the landowning noble class owned the serfs, who were bound to the land they tilled. Children of serfs were born into serfdom and worked the same land their parents had.\n\n**Rights and Conditions**\n\nThe understanding of law in Imperial Russia by all sections of society was often weak, confused, or nonexistent, particularly in the provinces where most serfs lived. This is why some serfs were able to do things such as to accumulate wealth.\n\n**Attitudes towards Catherine**\n\nThe attitude of the serfs toward their autocrat had historically been a positive one. However, if the empress' policies were too extreme or too disliked, she was not considered the true empress.\n\n**Arts and Culture**\n\nCatherine was a patron of the arts, literature, and education. She was a great lover of art and books and ordered the construction of the Hermitage in 1770 to house her expanding collection of paintings, sculpture, and books.\n\n**Education**\n\nCatherine held western European philosophies and culture close to her heart, and she wanted to surround herself with like-minded people within Russia.

Prussian general in his capacity as governor of the city of Stettin However, because her second cousin Peter III converted to Orthodox Christianity, her mother's brother became the heir to the Swedish throne [4] and two of her first cousins, Gustav III and Charles XIII, became Kings of Sweden [5] In accordance with the prevailing custom among the ruling dynasties of Germany, she received her education chiefly from a French governess and from tutors According to her memoirs, Sophie was considered a tomboy and trained herself to master a sword.\n\n\nMarriage and reign of Peter III\nThe choice of Sophie as wife of the future tsar was a result of the Lopukhina affair, in which Count Jean Armand de Lestocq and King Frederick the Great of Prussia took an active part The objective was to strengthen the friendship between Prussia and Russia, to weaken the influence of Austria, and to overthrow the chancellor Alexey Bestuzhev-Ryumin, a known partisan of the Austrian alliance on whom the reigning Russian Empress Elizabeth relied The diplomatic intrigue failed, largely due to the intervention of Sophie's mother, Joanna Elisabeth of Holstein-Gottorp [11]\n\n\nReign (1762–1796)\nCatherine was crowned at the Assumption Cathedral in Moscow on 22 September 1762 [29] Her coronation marks the creation of one of the main treasures of the Romanov dynasty, the Great Imperial Crown of Russia, designed by Swiss-French court diamond jeweller Jérémie Pauzié Inspired by Byzantine design, the crown was constructed of two half spheres, one gold and one silver, representing the Eastern and Western Roman Empires, divided by a foliate garland and fastened with a low hoop [30]\n\n\nCoronation (1762)\nCatherine was crowned at the Assumption Cathedral in Moscow

Crimea, the North Caucasus, right-bank Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, and Courland at the expense, mainly, of two powers—the Ottoman Empire and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth [32]\n\n\nRusso-Turkish Wars\nPeter the Great had gained a foothold in the south, on the edge of the Black Sea, during the Azov campaigns Catherine completed the conquest of the south, making Russia the dominant power in the Balkans following the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774 Russia inflicted some of the heaviest defeats ever suffered by the Ottoman Empire, including at the Battle of Chesma (5–7 July 1770) and the Battle of Kagul (21 July 1770) In 1769, a last major Crimean–Nogai slave raid, which ravaged the Russian held territories in Ukraine, saw the capture of up to 20,000 slaves for the Crimean slave trade [35] [36]\n\n\nRusso-Persian War\nIn the Treaty of Georgievsk (1783), Russia agreed to protect Georgia against any new invasions and further political aspirations of their Persian suzerains Catherine waged a new war against Persia in 1796 after they, under the new king Agha Mohammad Khan, again invaded Georgia and established rule in 1795, expelling the newly established Russian garrisons in the Caucasus The ultimate goal for the Russian government, however, was to topple the anti-Russian shah (king), and to replace him with his pro-Russian half-brother Morteza Qoli Khan, who had defected to Russia [38] [39]\n\n\nRelations with Western Europe\nCatherine longed for recognition as an enlightened sovereign She refused the Duchy of Holstein-Gottorp, which had ports on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean and refrained from having a Russian army in Germany Instead, she pioneered for Russia the role that Britain later played through most of the 19th and early 20th centuries as an international mediator in disputes that could, or did, lead to war She acted as mediator in the War of the Bavarian Succession (1778–1779) between the German states of Prussia and Austria In 1780, she established a League of Armed Neutrality, designed to defend neutral shipping from being searched by the British Royal Navy during the American Revolutionary War.\n\n\nPartitions of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth\nIn 1764, Catherine placed Stanislaus Augustus Poniatowski, her former lover, on the Polish throne Although the idea of partitioning Poland came from Frederick II of Prussia, Catherine took a leading role in its execution in the 1790s In 1768, she formally became the protector of the political rights of dissidents and peasants of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, which provoked an anti-Russian uprising in Poland, the Confederation of Bar (1768–1772), supported by France After the rebels, their French and European volunteers, and their allied Ottoman Empire had been defeated, she established in the Commonwealth a system of government fully controlled by the Russian Empire through a Permanent Council, under the supervision of her ambassadors and envoys [43]\n\n\nRelations with China\nThe Qianlong Emperor of China was committed to an expansionist policy in Central Asia and saw the Russian Empire as a potential rival, making for difficult and unfriendly relations between Beijing and Saint Petersburg [45] In 1762, he unilaterally abrogated the Treaty of Kyakhta, which governed the caravan trade between the two empires [46] Another source of tension was the wave of Dzungar Mongol fugitives from the Qing Empire who took refuge with the Russians [47]\n\n\nRelations with Japan\nIn the Far East, Russians became active in fur trapping in Kamchatka and the Kuril Islands This spurred Russian interest in opening trade with Japan to the south for supplies and food In 1783, storms drove a Japanese sea captain, Daikokuya Kōdayū, ashore in the Aleutian Islands, at that time Russian territory Russian local authorities helped his party, and the Russian government decided to use him as a trade envoy On 28 June 1791, Catherine granted Daikokuya an audience at Tsarskoye Selo Subsequently, in 1792, the Russian government dispatched a trade mission to Japan, led by Adam Laxman The Tokugawa shogunate received the mission, but negotiations failed [48]\n\n\nThe evaluation of foreign policy\nNicholas I, her grandson, evaluated the foreign policy of Catherine the Great as a dishonest one [49] Catherine failed to reach any of the initial goals she had put forward Her foreign policy lacked a long-term strategy and from the very start was characterised by a series of mistakes She lost the large territories of the Russian protectorate of the Commonwealth of Poland and Lithuania and left its territories to Prussia and Austria The Commonwealth had become the Russian protectorate since the reign of Peter I, but he did not intervene into the problem of political freedoms of dissidents advocating for their religious freedoms only Catherine did turn Russia into a global great power, not only a European one, but with quite a different reputation from what she initially had planned as an honest policy The global trade of Russian natural resources and Russian grain provoked famines, starvation and fear of famines in Russia Her dynasty lost power because of this and of a war with Austria and Germany, impossible without her foreign policy [50]\n\n\nEconomics and finance\nRussian economic development was well below the standards in western Europe Historian François Cruzet writes that Russia under Catherine:\n\n\nPublic health\nCatherine made public health a priority She made use of the social theory ideas of German cameralism and French physiocracy, as well as Russian precedents and experiments such as foundling homes In 1764, she launched the Moscow Foundling Home and lying-in hospital In 1763, she opened Paul's Hospital, also known as Pavlovskaya Hospital She had the government collect and publish vital statistics In 1762, she called on the army to upgrade its medical services She established a centralised medical administration charged with initiating vigorous health policies Catherine decided to have herself inoculated against smallpox by English doctor Thomas Dimsdale While this was considered a controversial method at the time, she succeeded Her son Pavel later was inoculated as well [55]\n\n\nSerfs\nAccording to a census taken from 1754 to 1762, Catherine owned 500,000 serfs A further 2.8 million belonged to the Russian state [57]\n\n\nRights and conditions\nAt the time of Catherine's reign, the landowning noble class owned the serfs, who were bound to the land they tilled Children of serfs were born into serfdom and worked the same land their parents had Even before the rule of Catherine, serfs had very limited rights, but they were not exactly slaves While the state did not technically allow them to own possessions, some serfs were able to accumulate enough wealth to pay for their freedom [58] The understanding of law in Imperial Russia by all sections of society was often weak, confused, or nonexistent, particularly in the provinces where most serfs lived This is why some serfs were able to do things such as to accumulate wealth To become serfs, people conceded their freedoms to a landowner in exchange for their protection and support in times of hardship In addition, they received land to till, but were taxed a certain percentage of their crops to give to their landowners These were the privileges a serf was entitled to and that nobles were bound to carry out All of this was true before Catherine's reign, and this is the system she inherited.\n\n\nAttitudes towards Catherine\nThe attitude of the serfs toward their autocrat had historically been a positive one [65]\nHowever, if the empress' policies were too extreme or too disliked, she was not considered the true empress In these cases, it was necessary to replace this \"fake\" empress with the \"true\" empress, whoever she may be Because the serfs had no political power, they rioted to convey their message However, usually, if the serfs did not like the policies of the empress, they saw the nobles as corrupt and evil, preventing the people of Russia from communicating with the well-intentioned empress and misinterpreting her decrees [66] However, they were already suspicious of Catherine upon her accession because she had annulled an act by Peter III that essentially freed the serfs belonging to the Orthodox Church [67] Naturally, the serfs did not like it when Catherine tried to take away their right to petition her because they felt as though she had severed their connection to the autocrat, and their power to appeal to her Far away from the capital, they were confused as to the circumstances of her accession to the throne [68]\n\n\nArts and culture\nCatherine was a patron of the arts, literature, and education The Hermitage Museum, which now [update] occupies the whole Winter Palace, began as Catherine's personal collection The empress was a great lover of art and books, and ordered the construction of the Hermitage in 1770 to house her expanding collection of paintings, sculpture, and books [72] By 1790, the Hermitage was home to 38,000 books, 10,000 gems and 10,000 drawings Two wings were devoted to her collections of \"curiosities\" [73]\n\n\nEducation\nCatherine held western European philosophies and culture close to her heart, and she wanted to surround herself with like-minded people within Russia [90] She believed a 'new kind of person' could be created by inculcating Russian children with European education Catherine believed education could change the hearts and minds of the Russian people and turn them away from backwardness This meant developing individuals both intellectually and morally, providing them knowledge and skills, and fostering a sense of civic responsibility Her goal was to modernise education across Russia [91]\n\n\nReligious affairs\nCatherine's apparent embrace of all things Russian (including Orthodoxy) may have prompted her personal indifference to religion She nationalised all of the church lands to help pay for her wars, largely emptied the monasteries, and forced most of the remaining clergymen to survive as farmers or from fees for baptisms and other services Very few members of the nobility entered the church, which became even less important than it had been She did not allow dissenters to build chapels, and she suppressed religious dissent after the onset of the French Revolution [106]\n\n\nIslam\nCatherine took many different approaches to Islam during her reign She avoided force and tried persuasion (and money) to integrate Muslim areas into her empire [109] Between 1762 and 1773, Muslims were prohibited from owning any Orthodox serfs They were pressured into Orthodoxy through monetary incentives Catherine promised more serfs of all religions, as well as amnesty for convicts, if Muslims chose to convert to Orthodoxy However, the Legislative Commission of 1767 offered several seats to people professing the Islamic faith This commission promised to protect their religious rights, but did not do so Many Orthodox peasants felt threatened by the sudden change, and burned mosques as a sign of their displeasure [citation needed]\n\n\nJudaism\nRussia often treated Judaism as a separate entity, where Jews were maintained with a separate legal and bureaucratic system Although the government knew that Judaism existed, Catherine and her advisers had no real definition of what a Jew is because the term meant many things during her reign [112] Judaism was a small, if not non-existent, religion in Russia until 1772 When Catherine agreed to the First Partition of Poland, the large new Jewish element was treated as a separate people, defined by their religion Catherine separated the Jews from Orthodox society, restricting them to the Pale of Settlement She levied additional taxes on the followers of Judaism; if a family converted to the Orthodox faith, that additional tax was lifted [113] Jewish members of society were required to pay double the tax of their Orthodox neighbours Converted Jews could gain permission to enter the merchant class and farm as free peasants under Russian rule [114] [115]\n\n\nRussian Orthodoxy\nIn many ways, the Orthodox Church fared no better than its foreign counterparts during the reign of Catherine Under her leadership, she completed what Peter III had started The church's lands were expropriated, and the budget of both monasteries and bishoprics were controlled by the Collegium of Accounting [119] Endowments from the government replaced income from privately held lands The endowments were often much less than the original intended amount [120] She closed 569 of 954 monasteries, of which only 161 received government money Only 400,000 roubles of church wealth were paid back [121] While other religions (such as Islam) received invitations to the Legislative Commission, the Orthodox clergy did not receive a single seat [120] Their place in government was restricted severely during the years of Catherine's reign [106]\n\n\nPersonal life\nCatherine, throughout her long reign, took many lovers, often elevating them to high positions for as long as they held her interest and then pensioning them off with gifts of serfs and large estates [126] [127] The percentage of state money spent on the court increased from 10% in 1767 to 11% in 1781 to 14% in 1795 Catherine gave away 66,000 serfs from 1762 to 1772, 202,000 from 1773 to 1793, and 100,000 in one day: 18 August 1795 [128]: 119  Catherine bought the support of the bureaucracy In 1767, Catherine decreed that after seven years in one rank, civil servants automatically would be promoted regardless of office or merit [129]\n\n\nPoniatowski\nSir Charles Hanbury Williams, the British ambassador to Russia, offered Stanisław Poniatowski a place in the embassy in return for gaining Catherine as an ally Poniatowski, through his mother's side, came from the Czartoryski family, prominent members of the pro-Russian faction in Poland; Poniatowski and Catherine were eighth cousins, twice removed, by their mutual ancestor King Christian I of Denmark, by virtue of Poniatowski's maternal descent from the Scottish House of Stuart Catherine, 26 years old and already married to the then-Grand Duke Peter for some 10 years, met the 22-year-old Poniatowski in 1755, well before encountering the Orlov brothers They had a daughter named Anna Petrovna in December 1757 (not to be confused with Grand Duchess Anna Petrovna of Russia, the daughter of Peter I's second marriage), although she was legally regarded as Grand Duke Peter's [134]\n\n\nOrlov\nGrigory Orlov, the grandson of a rebel in the Streltsy uprising (1698) against Peter the Great, distinguished himself in the Battle of Zorndorf (25 August 1758), receiving three wounds He represented an opposite to Peter's pro-Prussian sentiment, with which Catherine disagreed By 1759, he and Catherine had become lovers; no one told Catherine's husband, Peter Catherine saw Orlov as very useful, and he became instrumental in the 28 June 1762 coup d'état against her husband, but she preferred to remain the dowager empress of Russia rather than marrying anyone.\n\n\nPotemkin\nGrigory Potemkin was involved in the palace coup of 1762 In 1772, Catherine's close friends informed her of Orlov's affairs with other women, and she dismissed him By the winter of 1773, the Pugachev revolt had started to threaten Catherine's son Paul had started gaining support; both of these trends threatened her power She called Potemkin for help—mostly military—and he became devoted to her.\n\n\nFinal months and death\nCatherine's life and reign included many personal successes, but they ended in two failures Her Swedish cousin (once removed), King Gustav IV Adolf, visited her in September 1796, the empress's intention being that her granddaughter Alexandra should become queen of Sweden by marriage A ball was given at the imperial court on 11 September when the engagement was supposed to be announced Gustav Adolph felt pressured to accept that Alexandra would not convert to Lutheranism, and though he was delighted by the young lady, he refused to appear at the ball and left for Stockholm The frustration affected Catherine's health She recovered well enough to begin to plan a ceremony which would establish her favourite grandson Alexander as her heir, superseding her difficult son Paul, but she died before the announcement could be made, just over two months after the engagement ball [137]\n\n\nIssue\nThe Manifesto of 1763 begins with Catherine's title:\n\n\nTitle\nThe Manifesto of 1763 begins with Catherine's

It is a day of celebration and indulgence, as well as a time for Christians to reflect on their sins and seek forgiveness.\n\n# History\n\nThe tradition of marking the start of Lent has been documented for centuries. Ælfric of Eynsham's \"Ecclesiastical Institutes\" from around 1000 AD states: \"In the week immediately before Lent everyone shall go to his confessor and confess his deeds and the confessor shall so shrive him as he then may hear by his deeds what he is to do  [in the way of penance]\" By the time of the late Middle Ages, the celebration of Shrovetide lasted until the start of Lent.\n\nShrove Tuesday has its roots in the medieval Christian tradition of \"shriving,\" or confessing one's sins to a priest before the start of Lent. This practice was an important part of the Christian calendar, as it allowed individuals to reflect on their transgressions and seek forgiveness before embarking on the 40-day fast of Lent.\n\nOver time, Shrove Tuesday evolved into a celebration of feasting, merriment, and indulgence. It became a time for Christians to enjoy rich foods, drink, and entertainment before the somber period of Lent began. In many cultures, Shrove Tuesday is still celebrated as a time of revelry and excess, with traditional foods such as pancakes, waffles, and other sweet treats being consumed in abundance.\n\n# Terminology\n\nThe word \"shrove\" is a form of the English word \"shrive,\" which means to give absolution for someone's sins by way of Confession and doing penance. Thus, Shrove Tuesday was named after the custom of Christians to be \"shriven\" before the start of Lent.\n\nIn modern times, the term \"shrove\" is often used interchangeably with \"shrived,\" but the original meaning of the word has been lost in translation. Today, Shrove Tuesday is simply a day of celebration and indulgence, rather than a day of spiritual reflection and repentance.\n\n# Traditions\n\nShrove Tuesday serves a dual purpose of allowing Christians to repent of any sins they might have committed before the start of Lent on the next day Ash Wednesday and giving them the opportunity to engage in a last round of merriment before the start of the somber Lenten season.\n\nOn Shrove Tuesday, many Christians attend church services and participate in traditional rituals such as Confession and the distribution of ashes. Others may engage in a variety of activities, such as attending pancake parties, playing games, or watching parades.\n\nIn some cultures, Shrove Tuesday is a time for traditional foods and drinks, such as pancakes, waffles, and hot chocolate. In others, it is a time for music, dance, and other forms of celebration.\n\n# Observances\n\nOn the final day of Shrovetide, Shrove Tuesday, many traditional Christians, such as Anglicans, Lutherans, Methodists and Roman Catholics, make a special point of self-examination, of considering what wrongs they need to repent, and what amendments of life or areas of spiritual growth they especially need to ask God's help in dealing with.\n\nAs such, many churches offer Confession on Shrove Tuesday, providing individuals with the opportunity to reflect on their sins and seek forgiveness before the start of Lent.\n\n# Festivities\n\nIn the United Kingdom, as part of community celebration, many towns held traditional Shrove Tuesday \"mob football\" games, some dating as far back as the 17th century. The practice mostly died out in the 19th century after the passing of the Highway Act 1835 which banned playing football on public highways.\n\nA number of towns have maintained the tradition, including Alnwick in Northumberland (Scoring the Hales), Ashbourne in Derbyshire (called the Royal Shrovetide Football), Atherstone in Warwickshire (called simply the Atherstone Ball Game), St Columb Major in Cornwall (called Hurling the Silver Ball), and Sedgefield in County Durham (Sedgefield Ball Game).\n\nIn addition to mob football, Shrove Tuesday is also celebrated with a variety of other activities, such as pancake racing, parades, and fairs. In some cultures, it is a time for traditional music and dance, while in others it is a time for feasting and merriment.\n\n# Dates\n\nShrove Tuesday is exactly 47 days before Easter Sunday, a moveable feast based on the cycles of the moon. The date can be between 3 February and 9 March inclusive.\n\nThe exact date of Shrove Tuesday varies from year to year, depending on the date of Easter Sunday. In some years, it falls as early as February 3, while in others it falls as late as March 9.\n\n# See also\n\nShrove Tuesday is a unique and important part of the Christian calendar, and its traditions and customs have been celebrated for centuries. In addition to the information provided in this article, there are many other interesting facts and tidbits about Shrove Tuesday that are worth exploring.\n\nFor example, did you know that Shrove Tuesday is also known as Pancake Day in some cultures?

{"title": "Killers_of_the_Flower_Moon", "content": "", "lang": "en", "article": "**Killers of the Flower Moon**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon is a forthcoming American epic crime drama film written and directed by Martin Scorsese. The film is based on the 2017 non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann, which examines a series of murders of Osage Native Americans in Oklahoma during the 1920s. The film is set to star Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, among others.\n\n**The Osage Murders**\n\n## Background\n\nThe Osage Nation is a federally recognized tribe of Native Americans living in the state of Oklahoma. In the early 20th century, the Osage were one of the wealthiest tribes in the United States, with large tracts of land rich in oil and gas. The discovery of oil on Osage land in the 1890s led to a rapid increase in the tribe's wealth, with many Osage individuals becoming millionaires.\n\n## The Murders\n\nBetween 1921 and 1925, a series of mysterious murders took place on Osage land. At least 20 Osage individuals were killed, with many more injured. The victims were all members of the Osage Nation, and the murders were carried out in a particularly brutal and ruthless manner.\n\n## Investigating the Crimes\n\nThe Oklahoma Bureau of Investigation, led by the legendary detective Tom White, was tasked with investigating the murders. White and his team worked tirelessly to gather evidence and track down suspects, but they faced significant challenges in the form of corruption, intimidation, and racism.\n\n## The Role of the FBI\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was also involved in the investigation, with J. Edgar Hoover playing a key role in the case. Hoover and his agents worked closely with White and his team to gather evidence and build a case against the suspects.\n\n**The Main Suspects**\n\n## Ernest Burkhart\n\nErnest Burkhart was a nephew of William Hale, a wealthy and influential Osage businessman. Burkhart was a key suspect in the investigation, and he was eventually charged with the murder of Mollie Burkhart, a wealthy Osage woman.\n\n## William Hale\n\nWilliam Hale was a wealthy and influential Osage businessman who stood to gain a significant amount of money from the death of his nephew, Ernest Burkhart. Hale was also a key suspect in the investigation, and he was eventually charged with the murder of several Osage individuals.\n\n## W.C. Vaughn\n\nW.C. Vaughn was a lawyer who represented many of the wealthy Osage individuals who were targeted by the conspirators. Vaughn was also a suspect in the investigation, and he was eventually charged with the murder of several Osage individuals.\n\n**The Trial and Aftermath**\n\n## The Trial of Ernest Burkhart\n\nErnest Burkhart was put on trial for the murder of Mollie Burkhart. The prosecution presented a strong case against Burkhart, and he was eventually convicted of the crime.\n\n## The Trial of William Hale and W.C. Vaughn\n\nWilliam Hale and W.C. Vaughn were also put on trial for their roles in the conspiracy. The prosecution presented a strong case against both men, and they were eventually convicted of their crimes.\n\n## The Aftermath\n\nThe conviction of the conspirators marked the end of a long and difficult investigation, but it also marked the beginning of a new era for the Osage Nation. The Osage people were finally able to begin rebuilding their lives and their communities, free from the grip of the conspirators.\n\n**The Impact of the Killers of the Flower Moon Case**\n\n## The Impact on the Osage Nation\n\nThe Killers of the Flower Moon case had a profound impact on the Osage Nation. The case exposed the widespread corruption and racism that had been perpetrated against the Osage people, and it marked a turning point in the history of the tribe.\n\n## The Impact on the FBI\n\nThe Killers of the Flower Moon case also had a significant impact on the FBI. The case marked a major achievement for the agency, and it helped to establish the FBI as a powerful and effective law enforcement agency.\n\n## The Legacy of the Killers of the Flower Moon Case\n\nThe Killers of the Flower Moon case is remembered as one of the most significant and disturbing crimes in American history. The case serves as a reminder of the dark and troubled history of the United States, and it highlights the ongoing struggles of the Osage Nation and other Native American communities.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Killers of the Flower Moon case is a complex and disturbing chapter in American history. The case highlights the dark and troubled history of the United States, and it serves as a reminder of the ongoing struggles of the Osage Nation and other Native American communities. The case also marks a turning point in the history of the FBI, and it serves as a reminder of the importance of justice and accountability in our society.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Killers_of_the_Flower_Moon\" following this outline:\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik and written by John Hughes. The film stars Chevy Chase as Clark Griswold, a well-meaning but hapless family man who embarks on a disastrous Christmas vacation with his family.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place in the Griswold family's home in the Chicago suburbs, where Clark (Chevy Chase) and his wife Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) are preparing for a traditional family Christmas. Clark's goals for the holiday include decorating the house, hosting a festive dinner, and making memories with his family. However, things quickly go awry as Clark's plans are thwarted by a series of misadventures, including a disastrous trip to the mall, a chaotic house decorating session, and a disastrous Christmas dinner.\n\nAs the holiday chaos escalates, Clark's family – including his children Rusty (Johnny Galecki) and Audrey (Juliette Lewis) – struggle to cope with their father's antics. Meanwhile, Clark's eccentric relatives, including his bumbling brother-in-law Eddie (Randy Quaid), add to the holiday mayhem.\n\n**Cast**\n\nNational Lampoon's Christmas Vacation originated from a short story by writer John Hughes called \"Christmas '59\", which was published in the December 1980 issue of National Lampoon magazine.

[128] [129] the country's traditional blankets are also featured in the film [128] Coogler compared the rarity of vibranium existing only in Wakanda to the real-life mineral coltan that can almost only be found in Congo [130] He wanted Wakanda to feel like a full country with multiple distinct tribes, [37] and created a project bible that detailed each Wakandan tribe to guide the design process Special care was taken to create a futuristic look that was not alien, [10] as some of Jack Kirby's original comic designs appeared [131]\n\n\nSets\nBeachler wanted to honor the comic designs, but fill in the gaps with research concentrated on Sub-Saharan Africa, pulling inspiration from Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Congo-Kinshasa, Ethiopia, [132] as well as the designs of Zaha Hadid, [10] and the pre-colonization architecture of the historic Mali Empire and the city of Timbuktu [133] Moore described this approach of taking inspiration from many different sources as a love letter to Africa [10] Beachler looked at the architecture of existing tribes, and then tried to advance the technology naturally rather than if Wakanda had been colonized [132] Circular motifs, signifying the transmission of energy, were an important theme throughout the film Older locations depicted in the film, such as Warrior Falls, the City of the Dead, and the Hall of Kings, were juxtaposed with the more modern Afro-punk style of the Golden City, the capital [10] Rondavels were incorporated into the tops of Wakanda's skyscrapers, inspired by the appearance of mountains at Blyde River Canyon in South Africa [132]\n\n\nCostumes\nCostume designer Ruth E Carter referenced the Maasai, Himba, Dogon, Basotho, Tuareg, Turkana, Xhosa, Zulu, Suri and Dinka people in her designs [134] [135] She also examined appropriate works by Japanese fashion designer Issey Miyake, French fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent, and American fashion designer Donna Karan [135] Winnie Mandela provided inspiration to Carter for Angela Bassett's costumes [10]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography had begun by January 21, 2017, [136] at EUE/Screen Gems Studios in the Atlanta metropolitan area, [137] [138] under the working title Motherland [139] [140] Filming also took place at Pinewood Atlanta Studios, [141] and in the Sweet Auburn neighborhood in Atlanta, which doubled as Oakland; the High Museum of Art, which served as the fictional Museum of Great Britain in London; and Atlanta City Hall, which served as a United Nations building [137] [142] Cinematographer Rachel Morrison, who was eager to work on Black Panther after working with Coogler on Fruitvale Station, [143] first watched all of the other MCU films to understand the established \"language\" She wanted to \"push\" that language and feature more contrast in color Visual effects supervisor Geoff Baumann provided Morrison with before-and-after shots of scenes from Civil War so she could understand what elements are captured on set and what is created digitally [144] She filmed in 3.4K ArriRaw with Arri Alexa XT Plus cameras and Panavision Primo lenses, [145] primarily using a two-camera set-up with a third or fourth camera on occasion Morrison said that lighting was her biggest challenge, the magnitude of which \"was much bigger than I'd experienced before\", and made extensive use of Arri SkyPanel LED light fixtures, which she could preprogram from an iPad Some sets were completely surrounded by SkyPanels [143]\n\n\nPost-production\nBlack Panther was edited by Michael Shawver and Debbie Berman, with Shawver spending time on set during filming as well as at an editing suite near the Atlanta production base [153] Berman joined the film after an initial director's cut had been produced, two weeks after she completed work on Marvel's Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), [154] because Coogler likes to have both a male and female editing his films [153] She believed that she was chosen by Marvel because she is South African, and had been expressing interest in Black Panther throughout the editing process for Homecoming after first seeing the character in Civil War [154] Shawver said that a lot of their time editing was spent discussing how their work was affecting the audience For instance, Shawver felt that initial versions of the first Warrior Falls fight fell \"flat\" and used techniques he learned working with Coogler on Creed to have the editing move back-and-forth to mimic the back-and-forth of the fighters He also felt that adding more reaction shots to the crowd during the fight gave more weight to T'Challa's victory at the end [155] During work on the final battle, Berman pointed out to Coogler that the female Dora Milaje are rescued by the all-male Jabari tribe, which she felt undermined the focus on female characters leading up to that moment Coogler agreed, and subsequently added female Jabari fighters to the scene through additional photography, including the first onscreen Jabari fighter in the scene Berman felt that this was an important change that would not have been made if only men were editing the film [154]\n\n\nEditing\nBlack Panther was edited by Michael Shawver and Debbie Berman, with Shawver spending time on set during filming as well as at an editing suite near the Atlanta production base [153] Berman joined the film after an initial director's cut had been produced, two weeks after she completed work on Marvel's Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), [154] because Coogler likes to have both a male and female editing his films [153] She believed that she was chosen by Marvel because she is South African, and had been expressing interest in Black Panther throughout the editing process for Homecoming after first seeing the character in Civil War [154] Shawver said that a lot of their time editing was spent discussing how their work was affecting the audience For instance, Shawver felt that initial versions of the first Warrior Falls fight fell \"flat\" and used techniques he learned working with Coogler on Creed to have the editing move back-and-forth to mimic the back-and-forth of the fighters He also felt that adding more reaction shots to the crowd during the fight gave more weight to T'Challa's victory at the end [155] During work on the final battle, Berman pointed out to Coogler that the female Dora Milaje are rescued by the all-male Jabari tribe, which she felt undermined the focus on female characters leading up to that moment Coogler agreed, and subsequently added female Jabari fighters to the scene through additional photography, including the first onscreen Jabari fighter in the scene Berman felt that this was an important change that would not have been made if only men were editing the film [154]\n\n\nVisual effects\nVisual effects for the film were created by: Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) with help from Virtuos, Stereo D, and Scanline VFX;

If this is what the future of superhero movies looks like, deal me in.\" [105] The screened footage was the first time Marvel had shown raw dailies, which Feige said they did to show off the \"highest-class cast we've had\" despite editing having not yet begun [178] A poster was released ahead of the first teaser trailer, which premiered during Game 4 of the 2017 NBA Finals [179] [180] Fans on Twitter felt the poster was poorly photoshopped, [181] and it was compared to a real-life picture of Black Panther Party co-founder Huey P Newton [179] The trailer received a much more positive response, with Peter Sciretta of /Film finding it unexpected and refreshing, [182] io9's Charles Pulliam-Moore calling it \"every bit as intense as you were hoping it would be\", [183] and Andrew Husband for Uproxx feeling the single teaser outshone the entire Homecoming marketing campaign [180] It was viewed 89 million times in 24 hours, generating 349,000 mentions (second only to the amount the Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017) teaser received) and \"dominated the conversation on social media\" over Game 4 [184] [181] Per comScore and its PreAct service, the film was the subject of

[Racial and ethnic socialization] helps to strengthen identity and helps reduce the likelihood on internalizing negative stereotypes about one's ethnic group.\n\n\nAfrican and African-American representation\nDwayne Wong (Omowale) writing in HuffPost saw the film and its comic origins as addressing \"serious political issues concerning Africa's relationship to the West that is very rarely given the serious attention that it deserves\", with Wakandans portrayed as suspicious towards outsiders He concluded that while the country is fictional, the politics \"are very real The end of colonialism did not end Western tampering in Africa's politics\" [308] Carlos Rosario Gonzalez of Bam! Smack! Pow! said the struggle between T'Challa and Killmonger represents the collision of \"what it means to be African\" and \"what Africa means to Afro-minorities today\" In this view, Wakanda represents Africa without Western colonialism, and Killmonger shows us that \"we can sometimes inevitably become what we seek to destroy,\" concluding that Killmonger wants to use Wakanda's resources to become a colonizer of the West while \"Wakanda's conservative ways created the very problem that sought to destroy them, Erik Killmonger\" [309] Jelani Cobb, writing in The New Yorker, discussed the divide between Africans and African Americans, which he called a \"fundamental dissonance\" He felt T'Challa and Killmonger represented \"dueling responses to five centuries of African exploitation at the hands of the West The villain, to the extent that the term applies, is history itself\" Cobb added that Black Panther is political in a way previous MCU films were not because in those \"we were at least clear about where the lines of fantasy departed from reality  [while this film is set in] in an invented nation in Africa, a continent that has been grappling with invented versions of itself ever since white men first declared it the 'dark continent' and set about plundering its people and its resources.\" [310] Writing for The Atlantic, Adam Serwer argued against the assertion that Erik Killmonger was a representation for Black liberation, positing instead that he represented imperialism He felt that this was emphasized through his actions, as Killmonger's attempts to take over several of the world's major cities notably include Hong Kong Since China does not have a white Western hegemony in need of overthrowing, Killmonger's desire to conquer China was purely for the sake of power Ultimately, he argues that \"Black Panther does not render a verdict that violence is an unacceptable tool of Black liberation—to the contrary, that is precisely how Wakanda is liberated It renders a verdict on imperialism as a tool of Black liberation, to say that the master's tools cannot dismantle the master's house.\" [311]\n\n\nAccolades\nAt the 91st Academy Awards, Black Panther received nominations for Best Picture, Best Original Song, Best Sound Editing, and Best Sound Mixing; and won Best Costume Design, Best Production Design and Best Original Score [314] The film's other nominations include a British Academy Film Award (which it won), [315] twelve Critics' Choice Movie Awards (winning three), [316] and three Golden Globe Awards [317] Its nominations for the Academy Award for Best Picture and Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama were firsts for a superhero film, [318] [319] while its Academy Award wins were the first for Marvel Studios and an MCU film [320] The National Board of Review and the American Film Institute named Black Panther one of the ten-best films of 2018 [321] [322] The film was the top entertainment Google Search of 2018 along with the sixth overall [323] In December 2021, its screenplay was listed number fifty-seven on the Writers Guild of America's \"101 Greatest Screenplays of the 21st Century (So Far)\" [324]\n\n\nOscars campaign\nBy late August 2018, Disney hired Academy Award campaign strategist Cynthia Swartz to create a nomination campaign on behalf of the film for the 91st Academy Awards, with Feige and Marvel Studios said to have given the film a noteworthy budget for the awards season, an obligation which Marvel didn't consider for previous films The campaign was focused to highlight \"the film's creative accomplishments and the global impact it made\" in the hopes of receiving a Best Picture nomination; the campaign was not altered with the announcement of the new Best Popular Film award, which appeared to be \"designed to reward blockbusters like Black Panther\" in the event they did not receive a Best Picture nomination [325] The Best Popular Film award was ultimately not implemented for the 91st Academy Awards, in order for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to \"examine and seek additional input regarding\" it [326] [327] Glenn Whipp of the Los Angeles Times felt the \"blueprint\" for the film's Best Picture campaign was to \"communicate to Oscar voters that this is an auteur-driven superhero movie possessing a deep significance both to its director and to people historically underrepresented in Hollywood films.\" Another Oscar campaign consultant felt reminding the Oscar voters Black Panther \"wasn't just a movie, it was a phenomenon\" would help the film earn a nomination Another said voters \"want to reward good movies and they also want to reward movies that say something significant and make the industry look good.\" The consultants also felt if Black Panther could earn multiple nominations in the craft award categories, it would bolster its chances for a Best Picture nomination; Whipp believed that Morrison, Beachler, Carter, Friend and Harlow, and Lamar all had the possibility to be nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and Best Original Song, respectively [325] A few weeks later, Disney revealed their For Your Consideration list, with consideration in all Awards of Merit categories, aside from Best Actress and categories it was not eligible for, such as those for animation, short films, and documentaries [328] [329]\n\n\nFuture\nA sequel, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, was released on November 11, 2022, [332] with Coogler returning to write and direct [333] Nyong'o, [334] Gurira, [335] Freeman, [336] Wright, [337] Duke, and Bassett reprise their roles, while Tenoch Huerta was cast as Namor [334] In August 2020, Boseman died from colon cancer;

[128] [129] the country's traditional blankets are also featured in the film [128] Coogler compared the rarity of vibranium existing only in Wakanda to the real-life mineral coltan that can almost only be found in Congo [130] He wanted Wakanda to feel like a full country with multiple distinct tribes, [37] and created a project bible that detailed each Wakandan tribe to guide the design process Special care was taken to create a futuristic look that was not alien, [10] as some of Jack Kirby's original comic designs appeared [131]\n\n\nSets\nBeachler wanted to honor the comic designs, but fill in the gaps with research concentrated on Sub-Saharan Africa, pulling inspiration from Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Congo-Kinshasa, Ethiopia, [132] as well as the designs of Zaha Hadid, [10] and the pre-colonization architecture of the historic Mali Empire and the city of Timbuktu [133] Moore described this approach of taking inspiration from many different sources as a love letter to Africa [10] Beachler looked at the architecture of existing tribes, and then tried to advance the technology naturally rather than if Wakanda had been colonized [132] Circular motifs, signifying the transmission of energy, were an important theme throughout the film Older locations depicted in the film, such as Warrior Falls, the City of the Dead, and the Hall of Kings, were juxtaposed with the more modern Afro-punk style of the Golden City, the capital [10] Rondavels were incorporated into the tops of Wakanda's skyscrapers, inspired by the appearance of mountains at Blyde River Canyon in South Africa [132]\n\n\nCostumes\nCostume designer Ruth E Carter referenced the Maasai, Himba, Dogon, Basotho, Tuareg, Turkana, Xhosa, Zulu, Suri and Dinka people in her designs [134] [135] She also examined appropriate works by Japanese fashion designer Issey Miyake, French fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent, and American fashion designer Donna Karan [135] Winnie Mandela provided inspiration to Carter for Angela Bassett's costumes [10]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography had begun by January 21, 2017, [136] at EUE/Screen Gems Studios in the Atlanta metropolitan area, [137] [138] under the working title Motherland [139] [140] Filming also took place at Pinewood Atlanta Studios, [141] and in the Sweet Auburn neighborhood in Atlanta, which doubled as Oakland; the High Museum of Art, which served as the fictional Museum of Great Britain in London; and Atlanta City Hall, which served as a United Nations building [137] [142] Cinematographer Rachel Morrison, who was eager to work on Black Panther after working with Coogler on Fruitvale Station, [143] first watched all of the other MCU films to understand the established \"language\" She wanted to \"push\" that language and feature more contrast in color Visual effects supervisor Geoff Baumann provided Morrison with before-and-after shots of scenes from Civil War so she could understand what elements are captured on set and what is created digitally [144] She filmed in 3.4K ArriRaw with Arri Alexa XT Plus cameras and Panavision Primo lenses, [145] primarily using a two-camera set-up with a third or fourth camera on occasion Morrison said that lighting was her biggest challenge, the magnitude of which \"was much bigger than I'd experienced before\", and made extensive use of Arri SkyPanel LED light fixtures, which she could preprogram from an iPad Some sets were completely surrounded by SkyPanels [143]\n\n\nPost-production\nBlack Panther was edited by Michael Shawver and Debbie Berman, with Shawver spending time on set during filming as well as at an editing suite near the Atlanta production base [153] Berman joined the film after an initial director's cut had been produced, two weeks after she completed work on Marvel's Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), [154] because Coogler likes to have both a male and female editing his films [153] She believed that she was chosen by Marvel because she is South African, and had been expressing interest in Black Panther throughout the editing process for Homecoming after first seeing the character in Civil War [154] Shawver said that a lot of their time editing was spent discussing how their work was affecting the audience For instance, Shawver felt that initial versions of the first Warrior Falls fight fell \"flat\" and used techniques he learned working with Coogler on Creed to have the editing move back-and-forth to mimic the back-and-forth of the fighters He also felt that adding more reaction shots to the crowd during the fight gave more weight to T'Challa's victory at the end [155] During work on the final battle, Berman pointed out to Coogler that the female Dora Milaje are rescued by the all-male Jabari tribe, which she felt undermined the focus on female characters leading up to that moment Coogler agreed, and subsequently added female Jabari fighters to the scene through additional photography, including the first onscreen Jabari fighter in the scene Berman felt that this was an important change that would not have been made if only men were editing the film [154]\n\n\nEditing\nBlack Panther was edited by Michael Shawver and Debbie Berman, with Shawver spending time on set during filming as well as at an editing suite near the Atlanta production base [153] Berman joined the film after an initial director's cut had been produced, two weeks after she completed work on Marvel's Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), [154] because Coogler likes to have both a male and female editing his films [153] She believed that she was chosen by Marvel because she is South African, and had been expressing interest in Black Panther throughout the editing process for Homecoming after first seeing the character in Civil War [154] Shawver said that a lot of their time editing was spent discussing how their work was affecting the audience For instance, Shawver felt that initial versions of the first Warrior Falls fight fell \"flat\" and used techniques he learned working with Coogler on Creed to have the editing move back-and-forth to mimic the back-and-forth of the fighters He also felt that adding more reaction shots to the crowd during the fight gave more weight to T'Challa's victory at the end [155] During work on the final battle, Berman pointed out to Coogler that the female Dora Milaje are rescued by the all-male Jabari tribe, which she felt undermined the focus on female characters leading up to that moment Coogler agreed, and subsequently added female Jabari fighters to the scene through additional photography, including the first onscreen Jabari fighter in the scene Berman felt that this was an important change that would not have been made if only men were editing the film [154]\n\n\nVisual effects\nVisual effects for the film were created by: Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) with help from Virtuos, Stereo D, and Scanline VFX;

If this is what the future of superhero movies looks like, deal me in.\" [105] The screened footage was the first time Marvel had shown raw dailies, which Feige said they did to show off the \"highest-class cast we've had\" despite editing having not yet begun [178] A poster was released ahead of the first teaser trailer, which premiered during Game 4 of the 2017 NBA Finals [179] [180] Fans on Twitter felt the poster was poorly photoshopped, [181] and it was compared to a real-life picture of Black Panther Party co-founder Huey P Newton [179] The trailer received a much more positive response, with Peter Sciretta of /Film finding it unexpected and refreshing, [182] io9's Charles Pulliam-Moore calling it \"every bit as intense as you were hoping it would be\", [183] and Andrew Husband for Uproxx feeling the single teaser outshone the entire Homecoming marketing campaign [180] It was viewed 89 million times in 24 hours, generating 349,000 mentions (second only to the amount the Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017) teaser received) and \"dominated the conversation on social media\" over Game 4 [184] [181] Per comScore and its PreAct service, the film was the subject of the most new social media conversations for the rest of the week, [185] and the second-most for the week ending June 18, behind Homecoming [186]\n\n\nRelease\nBlack Panther had its world premiere at

[Racial and ethnic socialization] helps to strengthen identity and helps reduce the likelihood on internalizing negative stereotypes about one's ethnic group.\n\n\nAfrican and African-American representation\nDwayne Wong (Omowale) writing in HuffPost saw the film and its comic origins as addressing \"serious political issues concerning Africa's relationship to the West that is very rarely given the serious attention that it deserves\", with Wakandans portrayed as suspicious towards outsiders He concluded that while the country is fictional, the politics \"are very real The end of colonialism did not end Western tampering in Africa's politics\" [308] Carlos Rosario Gonzalez of Bam! Smack! Pow! said the struggle between T'Challa and Killmonger represents the collision of \"what it means to be African\" and \"what Africa means to Afro-minorities today\" In this view, Wakanda represents Africa without Western colonialism, and Killmonger shows us that \"we can sometimes inevitably become what we seek to destroy,\" concluding that Killmonger wants to use Wakanda's resources to become a colonizer of the West while \"Wakanda's conservative ways created the very problem that sought to destroy them, Erik Killmonger\" [309] Jelani Cobb, writing in The New Yorker, discussed the divide between Africans and African Americans, which he called a \"fundamental dissonance\" He felt T'Challa and Killmonger represented \"dueling responses to five centuries of African exploitation at the hands of the West The villain, to the extent that the term applies, is history itself\" Cobb added that Black Panther is political in a way previous MCU films were not because in those \"we were at least clear about where the lines of fantasy departed from reality  [while this film is set in] in an invented nation in Africa, a continent that has been grappling with invented versions of itself ever since white men first declared it the 'dark continent' and set about plundering its people and its resources.\" [310] Writing for The Atlantic, Adam Serwer argued against the assertion that Erik Killmonger was a representation for Black liberation, positing instead that he represented imperialism He felt that this was emphasized through his actions, as Killmonger's attempts to take over several of the world's major cities notably include Hong Kong Since China does not have a white Western hegemony in need of overthrowing, Killmonger's desire to conquer China was purely for the sake of power Ultimately, he argues that \"Black Panther does not render a verdict that violence is an unacceptable tool of Black liberation—to the contrary, that is precisely how Wakanda is liberated It renders a verdict on imperialism as a tool of Black liberation, to say that the master's tools cannot dismantle the master's house.\" [311]\n\n\nAccolades\nAt the 91st Academy Awards, Black Panther received nominations for Best Picture, Best Original Song, Best Sound Editing, and Best Sound Mixing; and won Best Costume Design, Best Production Design and Best Original Score [314] The film's other nominations include a British Academy Film Award (which it won), [315] twelve Critics' Choice Movie Awards (winning three), [316] and three Golden Globe Awards [317] Its nominations for the Academy Award for Best Picture and Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama were firsts for a superhero film, [318] [319] while its Academy Award wins were the first for Marvel Studios and an MCU film [320] The National Board of Review and the American Film Institute named Black Panther one of the ten-best films of 2018 [321] [322] The film was the top entertainment Google Search of 2018 along with the sixth overall [323] In December 2021, its screenplay was listed number fifty-seven on the Writers Guild of America's \"101 Greatest Screenplays of the 21st Century (So Far)\" [324]\n\n\nOscars campaign\nBy late August 2018, Disney hired Academy Award campaign strategist Cynthia Swartz to create a nomination campaign on behalf of the film for the 91st Academy Awards, with Feige and Marvel Studios said to have given the film a noteworthy budget for the awards season, an obligation which Marvel didn't consider for previous films The campaign was focused to highlight \"the film's creative accomplishments and the global impact it made\" in the hopes of receiving a Best Picture nomination; the campaign was not altered with the announcement of the new Best Popular Film award, which appeared to be \"designed to reward blockbusters like Black Panther\" in the event they did not receive a Best Picture nomination [325] The Best Popular Film award was ultimately not implemented for the 91st Academy Awards, in order for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to \"examine and seek additional input regarding\" it [326] [327] Glenn Whipp of the Los Angeles Times felt the \"blueprint\" for the film's Best Picture campaign was to \"communicate to Oscar voters that this is an auteur-driven superhero movie possessing a deep significance both to its director and to people historically underrepresented in Hollywood films.\" Another Oscar campaign consultant felt reminding the Oscar voters Black Panther \"wasn't just a movie, it was a phenomenon\" would help the film earn a nomination Another said voters \"want to reward good movies and they also want to reward movies that say something significant and make the industry look good.\" The consultants also felt if Black Panther could earn multiple nominations in the craft award categories, it would bolster its chances for a Best Picture nomination; Whipp believed that Morrison, Beachler, Carter, Friend and Harlow, and Lamar all had the possibility to be nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and Best Original Song, respectively [325] A few weeks later, Disney revealed their For Your Consideration list, with consideration in all Awards of Merit categories, aside from Best Actress and categories it was not eligible for, such as those for animation, short films, and documentaries [328] [329]\n\n\nFuture\nA sequel, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, was released on November 11, 2022, [332] with Coogler returning to write and direct [333] Nyong'o, [334] Gurira, [335] Freeman, [336] Wright, [337] Duke, and Bassett reprise their roles, while Tenoch Huerta was cast as Namor [334] In August 2020, Boseman died from colon cancer;

this task are varied and span many disciplines; most well known among them are machine learning and statistics Classification and prediction tasks aim at building models that describe and distinguish classes or concepts for future prediction The differences between them are the following:\n\n\nMachine learning approaches\nArtificial neural networks in bioinformatics have been used for: [5]\n\n\nArtificial neural networks\nArtificial neural networks in bioinformatics have been used for: [5]\n\n\nFeature engineering\nThe way that features, often vectors in a many-dimensional space, are extracted from the domain data is an important component of learning systems [6] In genomics, a typical representation of a sequence is a vector of k-mers frequencies, which is a vector of dimension \n\n\n\n\n4\n\nk\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 4^{k}}\n\n whose entries count the appearance of each subsequence of length \n\n\n\nk\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k}\n\n in a given sequence Since for a value as small as \n\n\n\nk\n=\n12\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k=12}\n\n the dimensionality of these vectors is huge (e.g in this case the dimension is \n\n\n\n\n4\n\n12\n\n\n≈\n16\n×\n\n10\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 4^{12}\\approx 16\\times 10^{6}}\n\n), techniques such as principal component analysis are used to project the data to a lower dimensional space, thus selecting a smaller set of features from the sequences [6] [additional citation(s) needed]\n\n\nClassification\nIn this type of machine learning task, the output is a discrete variable One example of this type of task in bioinformatics is labeling new genomic data (such as genomes of unculturable bacteria) based on a model of already labeled data [6]\n\n\nHidden Markov models\nHidden Markov models (HMMs) are a class of statistical models for sequential data (often related to systems evolving over time) An HMM is composed of two mathematical objects: an observed state‐dependent process \n\n\n\n\nX\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\nX\n\n2\n\n\n,\n…\n,\n\nX\n\nM\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X_{1},X_{2},\\ldots ,X_{M}}\n\n, and an unobserved (hidden) state process \n\n\n\n\nS\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\nS\n\n2\n\n\n,\n…\n,\n\nS\n\nT\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S_{1},S_{2},\\ldots ,S_{T}}\n\n In an HMM, the state process is not directly observed – it is a 'hidden' (or 'latent') variable – but observations are made of a state‐dependent process (or observation process) that is driven by the underlying state process (and which can thus be regarded as a noisy measurement of the system states of interest) [7] HMMs can be formulated in continuous time [8] [9]\n\n\nConvolutional neural networks\nConvolutional neural networks (CNN) are a class of deep neural network whose architecture is based on shared weights of convolution kernels or filters that slide along input features, providing translation-equivariant responses known as feature maps [12] [13] CNNs take advantage of the hierarchical pattern in data and assemble patterns of increasing complexity using smaller and simpler patterns discovered via their filters [14]\n\n\nSelf-supervised learning\nUnlike supervised methods, self-supervised learning methods learn representations without relying on annotated data That is well-suited for genomics, where high throughput sequencing techniques can create potentially large amounts of unlabeled data Some examples of self-supervised learning methods applied on genomics include DNABERT and Self-GenomeNet [20] [21]\n\n\nRandom forest\nRandom forests (RF) classify by constructing an ensemble of decision trees, and outputting the average prediction of the individual trees [22] This is a modification of bootstrap aggregating (which aggregates a large collection of decision trees) and can be used for classification or regression [23] [24]\n\n\nClustering\nClustering - the partitioning of a data set into disjoint subsets, so that the data in each subset are as close as possible to each other and as distant as possible from data in any other subset, according to some defined distance or similarity function - is a common technique for statistical data analysis.\n\n\nClustering algorithms used in bioinformatics\nData clustering algorithms can be hierarchical or partitional Hierarchical algorithms find successive clusters using previously established clusters, whereas partitional algorithms determine all clusters at once Hierarchical algorithms can be agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down).\n\n\nWorkflow\nTypically, a workflow for applying machine learning to biological data goes through four steps: [2]\n\n\nData errors\nIn general, a machine learning system can usually be trained to recognize elements of a certain class given sufficient samples [30] For example, machine learning methods can be trained to identify specific visual features such as splice sites [31]\n\n\nApplications\nIn general, a machine learning system can usually be trained to recognize elements of a certain class given sufficient samples [30] For example, machine learning methods can be trained to identify specific visual features such as splice sites [31]\n\n\nPrecision/personalized medicine\nNatural language processing algorithms personalized medicine for patients who suffer genetic diseases, by combining the extraction of clinical information and genomic data available from the patients Institutes such as Health-funded Pharmacogenomics Research Network focus on finding breast cancer treatments [37]\n\n\nGenomics\nWhile genomic sequence data has historically been sparse due to the technical difficulty of sequencing a piece of DNA, the number of available sequences is growing On average, the number of bases available in the GenBank public repository has doubled every 18 months since 1982 [39]  However, while raw data was becoming increasingly available and accessible, As of 2002 [update], biological interpretation of this data was occurring at a much slower pace [40] This made for an increasing need for developing computational genomics tools, including machine learning systems, that can automatically determine the location of protein-encoding genes within a given DNA sequence (i.e gene prediction) [40]\n\n\nProteomics\nProteins, strings of amino acids, gain much of their function from protein folding, where they conform into a three-dimensional structure, including the primary structure, the secondary structure (alpha helices and beta sheets), the tertiary structure, and the quaternary structure.\n\n\nMetagenomics\nMetagenomics is the study of microbial communities from environmental DNA samples [44] Currently, limitations and challenges predominate in the implementation of machine learning tools due to the amount of data in environmental samples [45] Supercomputers and web servers have made access to these tools easier [46] The high dimensionality of microbiome datasets is a major challenge in studying the microbiome; this significantly limits the power of current approaches for identifying true differences and increases the chance of false discoveries [47] [better source needed]\n\n\nMicroarrays\nMicroarrays, a type of lab-on-a-chip, are used for automatically collecting data about large amounts of biological material Machine learning can aid in analysis, and has been applied to expression pattern identification, classification, and genetic network induction [2]\n\n\nSystems biology\nSystems biology focuses on the study of emergent behaviors from complex interactions of simple biological components in a system Such components can include DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites [52]\n\n\nEvolution\nThis domain, particularly phylogenetic tree reconstruction, uses the features of machine learning techniques Phylogenetic trees are schematic representations of the evolution of organisms Initially, they were constructed using features such as morphological and metabolic features Later, due to the availability of genome sequences, the construction of the phylogenetic tree algorithm used the concept based on genome comparison With the help of optimization techniques, a comparison was done by means of multiple sequence alignment [54]\n\n\nStroke diagnosis\nMachine learning methods for the analysis of neuroimaging data are used to help diagnose stroke Historically multiple approaches to this problem involved neural networks [55] [56]\n\n\nText mining\nThe increase in biological publications increased the difficulty in searching and compiling relevant available information on a given topic This task is known as knowledge extraction It is necessary for biological data collection which can then in turn be fed into machine learning algorithms to generate new biological knowledge [2] [59] Machine learning can be used for this knowledge extraction task using techniques such as natural language processing to extract the useful information from human-generated reports in a database Text Nailing, an alternative approach to machine learning, capable of extracting features from clinical narrative notes was introduced in 2017.\n\n\nClustering and abundance profiling of biosynthetic gene clusters\nMicrobial communities are complex assembles of diverse microorganisms, [61] where symbiont partners constantly produce diverse metabolites derived from the primary and secondary (specialized) metabolism, from which metabolism plays an important role in microbial interaction [62] Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data are an important source for deciphering communications signals.\n\n\nDecodification of RiPPs chemical structures\nThe increase of experimentally characterized ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs), together with the availability of information on their sequence and chemical structure, selected from databases such as BAGEL, BACTIBASE, MIBIG, and THIOBASE, provide the opportunity to develop machine learning tools to decode the chemical structure and classify them.\n\n\nMass spectral similarity scoring\nMany tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) based metabolomics studies, such as library matching and molecular networking, use spectral similarity as a proxy for structural similarity Spec2vec [77] algorithm provides a new way of spectral similarity score, based on Word2Vec Spec2Vec learns fragmental relationships within a large set of spectral data, in order to assess spectral similarities between molecules and to classify unknown molecules through these comparisons.\n\n\nDatabases\nAn important part of bioinformatics is the management of big datasets, known as databases of reference Databases exist for each type of biological data, for example for biosynthetic gene clusters and metagenomes.\n\n\nGeneral databases by bioinformatics\nThe National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [79] provides a large suite of online resources for biological information and data, including the GenBank nucleic acid sequence database and the PubMed database of citations and abstracts for published life science journals Augmenting many of the Web applications are custom implementations of the BLAST program optimized to search specialized data sets Resources include PubMed Data Management, RefSeq Functional Elements, genome data download, variation services API, Magic-BLAST, QuickBLASTp, and Identical Protein Groups All of these resources can be accessed through NCBI

minimum information about any sequence (MIxS) framework [83]\n\n\nSILVA\nSILVA [85] is an interdisciplinary project among biologists and computers scientists assembling a complete database of RNA ribosomal (rRNA) sequences of genes, both small (16S, 18S, SSU) and large (23S, 28S, LSU) subunits, which belong to the bacteria, archaea and eukarya domains These data are freely available for

tree inference [88] [89] Overview: \n\n\nOpen Tree of Life Taxonomy\nOpen Tree of Life Taxonomy (OTT) [90] aims to build a complete, dynamic, and digitally available Tree of Life by synthesizing published phylogenetic trees along with taxonomic data Phylogenetic trees have been classified, aligned, and merged Taxonomies have been used to fill in sparse regions and gaps left by phylogenies OTT is a base that has been little used for sequencing analyzes of the 16S region, however, it has a greater number of sequences classified taxonomically down to the genus level compared to SILVA and Greengenes However, in terms of classification at the edge level, it contains a lesser amount of information [91]\n\n\nRibosomal Database Project\nRibosomal Database Project (RDP) [92] is a database that provides RNA ribosomal (rRNA) sequences of small subunits of domain bacterial and archaeal (16S); and fungal rRNA sequences of large subunits (28S) [93]\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "# Machine

technique for statistical data analysis.\n\n\nClustering algorithms used in bioinformatics\nData clustering algorithms can be hierarchical or partitional Hierarchical algorithms find successive clusters using previously established clusters, whereas partitional algorithms determine all clusters at once Hierarchical algorithms can be agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down).\n\n\nWorkflow\nTypically, a workflow for applying machine learning to biological data goes through four steps: [2]\n\n\nData errors\nIn general, a machine learning system can usually be trained to recognize elements of a certain class given sufficient samples [30] For example, machine learning methods can be trained to identify specific visual features such as splice sites [31]\n\n\nApplications\nIn general, a machine learning system can usually be trained to recognize elements of a certain class given sufficient samples [30] For example, machine learning methods can be trained to identify specific visual features such as splice sites [31]\n\n\nPrecision/personalized medicine\nNatural language processing algorithms personalized medicine for patients who suffer genetic diseases, by combining the extraction of clinical information and genomic data available from the patients Institutes such as Health-funded Pharmacogenomics Research Network focus on finding breast cancer treatments [37]\n\n\nGenomics\nWhile genomic sequence data has historically been sparse due to the technical difficulty of sequencing a piece of DNA, the number of available sequences is growing On average, the number of bases available in the GenBank public repository has doubled every 18 months since 1982 [39]  However, while raw data was becoming increasingly available and accessible, As of 2002 [update], biological interpretation of this data was occurring at a much slower pace [40] This made for an increasing need for developing computational genomics tools, including machine learning systems, that can automatically determine the location of protein-encoding genes within a given DNA sequence (i.e gene prediction) [40]\n\n\nProteomics\nProteins, strings of amino acids, gain much of their function from protein folding, where they conform into a three-dimensional structure, including the primary structure, the secondary structure (alpha helices and beta sheets), the tertiary structure, and the quaternary structure.\n\n\nMetagenomics\nMetagenomics is the study of microbial communities from environmental DNA samples [44] Currently, limitations and challenges predominate in the implementation of machine learning tools due to the amount of data in environmental samples [45] Supercomputers and web servers have made access to these tools easier [46] The high dimensionality of microbiome datasets is a major challenge in studying the microbiome; this significantly limits the power of current approaches for identifying true differences and increases the chance of false discoveries [47] [better source needed]\n\n\nMicroarrays\nMicroarrays, a type of lab-on-a-chip, are used for automatically collecting data about large amounts of biological material Machine learning can aid in analysis, and has been applied to expression pattern identification, classification, and genetic network induction [2]\n\n\nSystems biology\nSystems biology focuses on the study of emergent behaviors from complex interactions of simple biological components in a system Such components can include DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites [52]\n\n\nEvolution\nThis domain, particularly phylogenetic tree reconstruction, uses the features of machine learning techniques Phylogenetic trees are schematic representations of the evolution of organisms Initially, they were constructed using features such as morphological and metabolic features Later, due to the availability of genome sequences, the construction of the phylogenetic tree algorithm used the concept based on genome comparison With the help of optimization techniques, a comparison was done by means of multiple sequence alignment [54]\n\n\nStroke diagnosis\nMachine learning methods for the analysis of neuroimaging data are used to help diagnose stroke Historically multiple approaches to this problem involved neural networks [55] [56]\n\n\nText mining\nThe increase in biological publications increased the difficulty in searching and compiling relevant available information on a given topic This task is known as knowledge extraction It is necessary for biological data collection which can then in turn be fed into machine learning algorithms to generate new biological knowledge [2] [59] Machine learning can be used for this knowledge extraction task using techniques such as natural language processing to extract the useful information from human-generated reports in a database Text Nailing, an alternative approach to machine learning, capable of extracting features from clinical narrative notes was introduced in 2017.\n\n\nClustering and abundance profiling of biosynthetic gene clusters\nMicrobial communities are complex assembles of diverse microorganisms, [61] where symbiont partners constantly produce diverse metabolites derived from the primary and secondary (specialized) metabolism, from which metabolism plays an important role in microbial interaction [62] Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data are an important source for deciphering communications signals.\n\n\nDecodification of RiPPs chemical structures\nThe increase of experimentally characterized ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs), together with the availability of information on their sequence and chemical structure, selected from databases such as BAGEL, BACTIBASE, MIBIG, and THIOBASE, provide the opportunity to develop machine learning tools to decode the chemical structure and classify them.\n\n\nMass spectral similarity scoring\nMany tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) based metabolomics studies, such as library matching and molecular networking, use spectral similarity as a proxy for structural similarity Spec2vec [77] algorithm provides a new way of spectral similarity score, based on Word2Vec Spec2Vec learns fragmental relationships within a large set of spectral data, in order to assess spectral similarities between molecules and to classify unknown molecules through these comparisons.\n\n\nDatabases\nAn important part of bioinformatics is the management of big datasets, known as databases of reference Databases exist for each type of biological data, for example for biosynthetic gene clusters and metagenomes.\n\n\nGeneral databases by bioinformatics\nThe National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [79] provides a large suite of online resources for biological information and data, including the GenBank nucleic acid sequence database and the PubMed database of citations and abstracts for published life science journals Augmenting many of the Web applications are custom implementations of the BLAST program optimized to search specialized data sets Resources include PubMed Data Management, RefSeq Functional Elements, genome data download, variation services API, Magic-BLAST, QuickBLASTp, and Identical Protein Groups All of these resources can be accessed through NCBI [80]\n\n\nNational Center for Biotechnology Information\nThe National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [79] provides a large suite of online resources for biological information and data,

cluster specification, provides a standard for annotations and metadata on biosynthetic gene clusters and their molecular products MIBiG is a Genomic Standards Consortium project that builds on the minimum information about any sequence (MIxS) framework [83]\n\n\nSILVA\nSILVA [85] is an interdisciplinary project among biologists and computers scientists assembling a complete database of RNA ribosomal (rRNA) sequences of genes, both small (16S, 18S, SSU) and large (23S, 28S, LSU) subunits, which belong to the bacteria, archaea and eukarya domains These data are freely available for academic and commercial use [86]\n\n\nGreengenes\nGreengenes [87] is a full-length 16S rRNA gene database that provides chimera screening, standard alignment and a curated taxonomy based on de novo tree inference [88] [89] Overview: \n\n\nOpen Tree of Life Taxonomy\nOpen Tree of Life Taxonomy (OTT) [90] aims to build a complete, dynamic, and digitally available Tree of Life by synthesizing published phylogenetic trees along with taxonomic data Phylogenetic trees have been classified, aligned, and merged Taxonomies have been used to fill in sparse regions and gaps left by phylogenies OTT is a base that has been little used for sequencing analyzes of the 16S region, however, it has a greater number of sequences classified taxonomically down to the genus level compared to SILVA and Greengenes However, in terms of classification at the edge level, it contains a lesser amount of information [91]\n\n\nRibosomal Database Project\nRibosomal Database Project (RDP) [92] is a database that provides RNA ribosomal (rRNA) sequences of small subunits of domain bacterial and archaeal (16S); and fungal rRNA sequences of large subunits (28S) [93]\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is one of the most successful and enduring figures in the history of Formula One, with a career spanning over five decades. Williams' journey to the pinnacle of motorsport was marked by his unwavering passion, determination, and innovative approach to the sport.\n\nEarly Life\n----------\n\nFrank Williams was born on April 16, 1942, in South Shields, County Durham, England. At the time, his father was an active Royal Air Force officer, while his mother worked as a school teacher. Williams' parents' marriage eventually broke down, and he was partly raised by his aunt and uncle in Jarrow. This formative experience would later shape his strong work ethic and resilience.\n\nMotorsports Career\n------------------\n\nAfter a brief career as a driver and mechanic, Williams founded Frank Williams Racing Cars in 1966, funded by his work as a traveling grocery salesman. He ran drivers, including Piers Courage, for several years in Formula Two and Formula Three. Williams' entrepreneurial spirit and strategic thinking allowed him to navigate the complexities of the racing world.\n\nIn 1969, Williams purchased a Brabham Formula One chassis, which Courage drove throughout the season, twice finishing in second place. This marked the beginning of Williams' involvement in Formula One, a discipline that would become synonymous with his name. Over the years, Williams' team would establish itself as a dominant force in the sport, winning numerous championships and cementing its place in the pantheon of Formula One legends.\n\nPersonal Life and Death\n----------------------\n\nWilliams met Virginia Berry in 1967, and they married in 1974. They had two sons, Jonathan and Jaime, and a daughter, Claire, who would go on to become the deputy team principal of his future Formula One team, Williams Grand Prix Engineering. Williams' family life was marked by his dedication to his team and his sport, often taking precedence over personal interests.\n\nTragically, Williams passed away on November 28, 2021, at the age of 79, after a long battle with cancer. His legacy, however, continues to inspire and influence the world of motorsport.\n\nHonours\n--------\n\nWilliams was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) by Queen Elizabeth II in the 1987 New Year Honours, recognizing his outstanding contributions to the sport. In 1999, he received a knighthood in the same honors list, \"For services to the Motor Sport Industry.\" Williams was also appointed a Knight of the Legion of Honour by France, for his achievements with Renault F1's engines.\n\nIn 2008, Williams received the Wheatcroft Trophy, in recognition of his significant contributions to motorsports. This prestigious award is given annually to individuals who have made a lasting impact on the sport.\n\nNational Honours\n----------------\n\nWilliams' achievements have been recognized by his home country, the United Kingdom. He has been awarded numerous honors and accolades, cementing his status as a national treasure.\n\nForeign Honours\n----------------\n\nWilliams' international reputation has earned him recognition from other countries. In 2008, he was awarded a decoration by the French government for his contributions to the sport.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal Links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Frank_Williams_(Formula_One)\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nOn 16 April 1942, [1] Williams was born in South Shields, County Durham [2] [3] At the time, his father served as an active Royal Air Force officer, while his mother worked as a school teacher Williams was partly raised by his aunt and uncle in Jarrow, after the breakdown of his parents' marriage [4] [5]\n\n\nMotorsports career\nAfter a brief career as a driver and mechanic, Williams founded Frank Williams Racing Cars in 1966, funded by his work as a travelling grocery salesman He ran drivers, including Piers Courage, for several years in Formula Two and Formula Three [7] Williams purchased a Brabham Formula One chassis, which Courage drove throughout the 1969 Formula One season, twice finishing in second place [6] [8]\n\n\nPersonal life and death\nWilliams met Virginia Berry in 1967 They married in 1974 [15] They had two sons, Jonathan and Jaime, [16] and a daughter, Claire, who would go on to become the deputy team principal of his future Formula One team Williams Grand Prix Engineering [1]\n\n\nHonours\nWilliams was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) by Queen Elizabeth II in the 1987 New Year Honours, [27] and received a knighthood in the 1999 New Year Honours \"For services to the Motor Sport Industry.\" [28] He was appointed a Knight of the Legion of Honour by France, for his achievements with Renault F1's engines [29] Williams received the Wheatcroft Trophy in 2008, in recognition of his significant contributions to motorsports [30]\n\n\nNational honours\n\n\nForeign honours\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

FIFA Executive Committee members [7] FIFA hoped that by staging the world's most prestigious tournament there, it would lead to a growth of interest in the sport [8]\n\n\nVenues\nThe games were played in nine cities across the contiguous United States [20] All stadiums had a capacity of at least 53,000  and were occupied by professional or college American football teams [21]\n\n\nParticipating teams and officials\nThree teams—one African, one Asian, and one European—made their debuts at the 1994 tournament Nigeria qualified from the African zone alongside Cameroon and Morocco as CAF was granted three spots as a result of the strong performances by African teams in 1986 and 1990 In the Asian zone, Saudi Arabia qualified for the first time by topping the final round group ahead of South Korea as both edged out Japan, which was close to making its own World Cup debut, but was denied by Iraq in what became known as the \"Agony of Doha\" In the European zone, Greece made its first World Cup appearance after topping a group from which Russia also qualified, competing independently for the first time after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\n\n\nQualification\nThree teams—one

from which Russia also qualified, competing independently for the first time after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\n\n\nList of qualified teams\nThe following 24 teams, shown with their pre-tournament FIFA World Ranking (in parentheses) from June 1994, [34] qualified for the final tournamentː\n\n\nSquads\nTeams were selected following usual FIFA rules with 22 players Greece, Italy, Saudi Arabia, and Spain were the only countries that had all their players coming from domestic teams, while the Republic of Ireland and Nigeria had no players from domestic teams Saudi Arabia was the only team with no players from European teams.\n\n\nReferees\nThe FIFA Organizing Committee upheld the tradition to seed the host (United States) and defending champion (Germany), along with the other four teams ranked in the top five based on their results obtained in the last three FIFA World Cups The newly introduced FIFA World Ranking was not used as part of the calculated ranking for the seeding in this World Cup, as FIFA considered it to be too new [35] Despite that it was not used in any way, for comparison purposes the teams' pre-tournament FIFA World ranking position from June 1994 are shown in parentheses, [36] followed by the official and used ranking (OR) position determined by the results obtained in the last three world cups.\n\n\nDraw\nThe FIFA Organizing Committee

the draw\nIn each group, the teams played three games, one against each of the other teams After completion of the group stage, the best two teams in each group, as well as the four best-ranked third-place teams, advanced to the round of 16 in the knockout stage This format was identical to the tournament structure used in 1986 and 1990 except that a win now earned three points instead of two, to encourage more attacking play.\n\n\nSummary\n\nThe format of the competition stayed the same as in the 1990 World Cup: 24 teams qualified, divided into six groups of four Sixteen teams would qualify for the knockout phase: the six group winners, the six group runners-up, and the four third-placed teams with the best records This was the last time this format was used, due to the expansion of the finals tournament in 1998 to 32 teams FIFA introduced three rule changes for this tournament to encourage attacking play: three points awarded for a win in a group stage match instead of two, a relaxed offside rule and a ban on picking up back-passes to goalkeepers The number of goals increased to 2.73 per game from the record-low of 2.21 in 1990 [42]\n\n\nOpening ceremony\nThe opening ceremony of the World Cup was held on June 17 at Chicago's Soldier Field The ceremony was emceed by Oprah Winfrey, who introduced Diana Ross: she gave a musical performance Ross was also intended to score a penalty at the beginning of her performance, with the goal then splitting in two as part of a pre-orchestrated stunt [51] Instead, she kicked the ball wide to the left, missing the goal, but the goalposts collapsed anyway in accordance with the stunt plans In addition, Daryl Hall and Jon Secada also gave musical performances [52] It was officially opened by then-President Bill Clinton [53]\n\n\nGroup stage\nTimes are Eastern Daylight Time (UTC−4) (East Rutherford, Foxborough, Orlando, Pontiac and Washington), Central Daylight Time (UTC−5) (Chicago and Dallas), and Pacific Daylight Time (UTC−7) (Pasadena and Stanford).\n\n\nGroup A\nThe Group A game between the United States and Switzerland was the first to take place indoors, played under the roof at the Pontiac Silverdome.\n\n\nGroup B\nGroup B produced two of the four semifinalists of this World Cup — Brazil and Sweden — and was also one of the two groups in which only two, rather than three, sides progressed to the second round The match between the two eliminated teams, Cameroon and Russia, broke two World Cup records Oleg Salenko of Russia became the first – and remains the only [citation needed] – man to score five goals in a single World Cup game as Russia won 6–1 The goals also ensured that Salenko finished the tournament joint-top scorer with six goals, having previously bagged one against Sweden Cameroon left a mark too as Roger Milla, at the age of 42, became the oldest World Cup goalscorer of all time, as he grabbed his side's consolation goal in the game The result was not enough to take Russia through following losses to Brazil and Sweden Brazil beat Cameroon, and then confirmed the top spot with a draw to Sweden.\n\n\nGroup C\nAs was the case with Group B, Group C would only send two teams into the Round of 16 as Spain and defending champions Germany progressed to round two Coming from two goals down with four minutes left to snatch a 2–2 draw against Spain, the South Koreans very nearly eclipsed that feat against Germany when they came from 3–0 down to lose narrowly 3–2 In spite of these comebacks, South Korea was held to a 0–0 draw against Bolivia in their other group game when a win would have seen them through Spain's late implosion against the South Koreans effectively decided that it would be Germany who won the group and not them.\n\n\nGroup D\nTournament favorites Argentina led by Diego Maradona collected a maximum of six points from their opening two games after dominating Greece 4–0 in Foxboro with a Gabriel Batistuta hattrick before winning a close match against a formidable Nigeria with a 2–1 victory on the same field four days later; despite this Argentina finished third in the group Nigeria had been very impressive on their World Cup debut, and despite the narrow loss to Argentina, had emerged as group winners following victories against Bulgaria and Greece, the latter in which Nigeria doubled its lead late on a goal from Daniel Amokachi – a goal that would allow Nigeria to top its group Maradona only played with Argentina during their first two games, both in Foxborough (playing Greece and Nigeria and scoring his last ever World Cup goal against the former); he was thrown out of the tournament after testing positive for ephedrine.\n\n\nGroup E\nGroup E remains the only group in World Cup history in which all four teams finished with the same points All four teams even had the same goal difference It began at Giants Stadium where Ray Houghton's chip ensured a shock Irish victory over the then-three-time champions Italy by 1–0, as well as gaining a measure of revenge for the previous World Cup, in which Italy both hosted and eliminated Ireland at the quarterfinal stage The next day in Washington, Norway played its first World Cup game since 1938 and Kjetil Rekdal's goal five minutes from time proved decisive in an equally tense encounter as Norway beat Mexico.\n\n\nGroup F\nJust as happened to Argentina in Group D, Belgium endured the same fate in Group F Despite winning both of its first two matches 1–0 against Morocco and neighbors Netherlands, Belgium finished third as, in an upset, it lost to tournament newcomers Saudi Arabia 1–0 in the third game During that game, Saudi player Saaed Al-Owairan ran from his own half through a maze of Belgian players to score the game's only goal.\n\n\nRanking of third-placed teams\nHristo Stoichkov and Oleg Salenko received the Golden Boot for scoring six goals [55] In total, 141 goals were scored by 81 players, with only one of them

other teams After completion of the group stage, the best two teams in each group, as well as the four best-ranked third-place teams, advanced to the round of 16 in the knockout stage This format was identical to the tournament structure used in 1986 and 1990 except that a win now earned three points instead of two, to encourage more attacking play.\n\n\nSummary\n\nThe format of the competition stayed the same as in the 1990 World Cup: 24 teams qualified, divided into six groups of four Sixteen teams would qualify for the knockout phase: the six group winners, the six group runners-up, and the four third-placed teams with the best records This was the last time this format was used, due to the expansion of the finals tournament in 1998 to 32 teams FIFA introduced three rule changes for this tournament to encourage attacking play: three points awarded for a win in a group stage match instead of two, a relaxed offside rule and a ban on picking up back-passes to goalkeepers The number of goals increased to 2.73 per game from the record-low of 2.21 in 1990 [42]\n\n\nOpening ceremony\nThe opening ceremony of the World Cup was held on June 17 at Chicago's Soldier Field The ceremony was emceed by Oprah Winfrey, who introduced Diana Ross: she gave a musical performance Ross was also intended to score a penalty at the beginning of her performance, with the goal then splitting in two as part of a pre-orchestrated stunt [51] Instead, she kicked the ball wide to the left, missing the goal, but the goalposts collapsed anyway in accordance with the stunt plans In addition, Daryl Hall and Jon Secada also gave musical performances [52] It was officially opened by then-President Bill Clinton [53]\n\n\nGroup stage\nTimes are Eastern Daylight Time (UTC−4) (East Rutherford, Foxborough, Orlando, Pontiac and Washington), Central Daylight Time (UTC−5) (Chicago and Dallas), and Pacific Daylight Time (UTC−7) (Pasadena and Stanford).\n\n\nGroup A\nThe Group A game between the United States and Switzerland was the first to take place indoors, played under the roof at the Pontiac Silverdome.\n\n\nGroup B\nGroup B produced two of the four semifinalists of this World Cup — Brazil and Sweden — and was also one of the two groups in which only two, rather than three, sides progressed to the second round The match between the two eliminated teams, Cameroon and Russia, broke two World Cup records Oleg Salenko of Russia became the first – and remains the only [citation needed] – man to score five goals in a single World Cup game as Russia won 6–1 The goals also ensured that Salenko finished the tournament joint-top scorer with six goals, having previously bagged one against Sweden Cameroon left a mark too as Roger Milla, at the age of 42, became the oldest World Cup goalscorer of all time, as he grabbed his side's consolation goal in the game The result was not enough to take Russia through following losses to Brazil and Sweden Brazil beat Cameroon, and then confirmed the top spot with a draw to Sweden.\n\n\nGroup C\nAs was the case with Group B, Group C would only send two teams into the Round of 16 as Spain and defending champions Germany progressed to round two Coming from two goals down with four minutes left to snatch a 2–2 draw against Spain, the South Koreans very nearly eclipsed that feat against Germany when they came from 3–0 down to lose narrowly 3–2 In spite of these comebacks, South Korea was held to a 0–0 draw against Bolivia in their other group game when a win would have seen them through Spain's late implosion against the South Koreans effectively decided that it would be Germany who won the group and not them.\n\n\nGroup D\nTournament favorites Argentina led by Diego Maradona collected a maximum of six points from their opening two games after dominating Greece 4–0 in Foxboro with a Gabriel Batistuta hattrick before winning a close match against a formidable Nigeria with a 2–1 victory on the same field four days later; despite this Argentina finished third in the group Nigeria had been very impressive on their World Cup debut, and despite the narrow loss to Argentina, had emerged as group winners following victories against Bulgaria and Greece, the latter in which Nigeria doubled its lead late on a goal from Daniel Amokachi – a goal that would allow Nigeria to top its group Maradona only played with Argentina during their first two games, both in Foxborough (playing Greece and Nigeria and scoring his last ever World Cup goal against the former); he was thrown out of the tournament after testing positive for ephedrine.\n\n\nGroup E\nGroup E remains the only group in World Cup history in which all four teams finished with the same points All four teams even had the same goal difference It began at Giants Stadium where Ray Houghton's chip ensured a shock Irish victory over the then-three-time champions Italy by 1–0, as well as gaining a measure of revenge for the previous World Cup, in which Italy both hosted and eliminated Ireland at the quarterfinal stage The next day in Washington, Norway played its first World Cup game since 1938 and Kjetil Rekdal's goal five minutes from time proved decisive in an equally tense encounter as Norway beat Mexico.\n\n\nGroup F\nJust as happened to Argentina in Group D, Belgium endured the same fate in Group F Despite winning both of its first two matches 1–0 against Morocco and neighbors Netherlands, Belgium finished third as, in an upset, it lost to tournament newcomers Saudi Arabia 1–0 in the third game During that game, Saudi player Saaed Al-Owairan ran from his own half through a maze of Belgian players to score the game's only goal.\n\n\nRanking of third-placed teams\nHristo Stoichkov and Oleg Salenko received the Golden Boot

subdivided into district councils with different responsibilities These are first-past-the-post or block voting elections, with a mixture of single-member and multi-member electoral divisions County councils are elected in full every four years, with the last election having been in 2021 However, due to consultations about possible unitarisation, elections for three county councils were postponed

lowest-ever number of councillors in the capital In 2018, Labour won control of Tower Hamlets council which had previously been under no overall control, but did not gain control of Barnet, Wandsworth or Westminster councils, which the party had targeted Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats gained control of Kingston upon Thames and Richmond upon Thames borough councils from the Conservatives [25]\n\n\nMetropolitan boroughs\nThere are thirty-six metropolitan boroughs, which are single-tier local authorities Thirty-three of them elect a third of their councillors every year for three years, with no election in each fourth year These councils hold their elections on the same timetable, which includes elections in 2022 Birmingham City Council holds its elections on a four-year cycle from 2018, so is also due to hold an election in 2022 Due to boundary changes, three councils which generally elect their councillors in thirds will elect all of their councillors in 2022 They will then return to the thirds schedule, apart from St Helens Council, which is moving to all-out elections every four years starting in 2022 Several other boundary reviews have been delayed to 2023 due to the COVID-19 pandemic The scheduled elections in Liverpool in 2022 have been cancelled and instead the city is expected to move to all-out elections from 2023 on new ward boundaries [27]\n\n\nElections

He ruled from 1714 until his death in 1727 and played a significant role in the unification of England and Scotland into the Kingdom of Great Britain.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nGeorge I was born on May 28, 1660, in Hanover, Germany, to Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, and his wife, Sophia of the Palatinate. He was the eldest son of his parents and went on to become one of the most influential monarchs in British history.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nGeorge was born in the city of Hanover in the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg in the Holy Roman Empire. His mother, Sophia, was the granddaughter of King James I of England through her mother, Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia. This made George a great-grandson of James I and a great-great-grandson of Margaret Tudor, making him a descendant of the English royal family.\n\n**Marriage**\n\nIn 1682, George married Sophia Dorothea of Celle, the daughter of his uncle George William. This marriage was a strategic move to secure additional incomes that would have been outside of Salic laws. The marriage was arranged primarily to ensure a healthy annual income and to assist in the eventual unification of Hanover and Celle. However, George's mother initially opposed the marriage due to Sophia Dorothea's mother being from lower French nobility and Sophia Dorothea's legitimized status.\n\n**Electoral Reign**\n\nErnest Augustus died on January 23, 1698, leaving all of his territories to George, except for the Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrück. George thus became Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and Archbannerbearer and a Prince-Elector of the Holy Roman Empire. His court in Hanover was graced by many cultural icons, including the mathematician and philosopher Gottfried Leibniz and the composers George Frideric Händel and Agostino Steffani.\n\n**Accession in Great Britain and Ireland**\n\nAlthough both England and Scotland recognized Anne as their queen, only the Parliament of England had settled on Sophia, Electress of Hanover, as the heir presumptive. The Parliament of Scotland had not formally settled the succession question for the Scottish throne. In 1703, the Estates passed a bill declaring that their selection for Queen Anne's successor would not be the same individual as the successor to the English throne, unless England granted full freedom of trade to Scottish merchants in England and its colonies. The English Parliament passed the Alien Act 1705, which threatened to restrict Anglo-Scottish trade and cripple the Scottish economy if the Estates did not agree to the Hanoverian succession.\n\n**Wars and Rebellions**\n\nWithin a year of George's accession, the Whigs won an overwhelming victory in the general election of 1715. Several members of the defeated Tory Party sympathized with the Jacobites, who sought to replace George with Anne's Catholic half-brother, James Francis Edward Stuart. Some disgruntled Tories sided with a Jacobite rebellion, which became known as \"The Fifteen.\" James's supporters, led by Lord Mar, instigated rebellion in Scotland, where support for Jacobitism was stronger than in England. However, \"The Fifteen\" was a dismal failure, and by the end of the year, the rebellion had all but collapsed.\n\n**Ministries**\n\nIn Hanover, the King was an absolute monarch, with all government expenditure above 50 thalers and the appointment of all army officers, all ministers, and even government officials above the level of copyist in his personal control. However, in Great Britain, George had to govern through Parliament.\n\n**Later Years**\n\nAs requested by Walpole, George revived the Order of the Bath in 1725, which enabled Walpole to reward or gain political supporters by offering them the honor. Walpole became extremely powerful and was largely able to appoint ministers of his own choosing. Unlike his predecessor, Queen Anne, George rarely attended meetings of the cabinet, and most of his communications were in private. He only exercised substantial influence with respect to British foreign policy.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nGeorge was ridiculed by his British subjects, with some of his contemporaries thinking him unintelligent on the grounds that he was wooden in public. Although he was unpopular in Great Britain due to his supposed inability to speak English, this may not have existed later in his reign, as documents from that time show that he understood, spoke, and wrote English. He certainly spoke fluent German and French, good Latin, and some Italian and Dutch. His treatment of his wife, Sophia Dorothea, became something of a scandal, and his Lutheran faith, his overseeing both the Lutheran churches in Hanover and the Church of England, and the presence of Lutheran preachers in his court caused some consternation among his Anglican subjects.\n\n**Arms**\n\nAs King, his arms were: Quarterly, I, Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for England) impaling Or a lion rampant within a tressure flory-counter-flory Gules (for Scotland); II, Azure three fleurs-de-lis Or (for France); III, Azure a harp Or stringed Argent (for Ireland); IV, tierced per pale and per chevron (for Hanover), I Gules two lions passant guardant Or (for Brunswick), II Or a semy of hearts Gules a lion rampant Azure (for Lüneburg), III Gules a horse courant Argent (for Westphalia), overall an escutcheon Gules charged with the crown of Charlemagne Or (for the dignity of Archtreasurer of the Holy Roman Empire).\n\n**Issue and Mistresses**\n\nIn addition to Melusine von der Schulenburg, three other women were said to be George's mistresses. His issue included a son, Frederick, Prince of Wales, who predeceased him, and a daughter, Princess Anne, who married William IV of Great Britain.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"George_I_of_Great_Britain\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nGeorge was born on 28 May 1660 in the city of Hanover in the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg in the Holy Roman Empire [b] He was the eldest son of Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, and his wife, Sophia of the Palatinate Sophia was the granddaughter of King James I of England, through her mother, Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia [3]\n\n\nMarriage\nIn 1682, George married Sophia Dorothea of Celle, the daughter of his uncle George William, thereby securing additional incomes that would have been outside Salic laws This marriage of state was arranged primarily to ensure a healthy annual income, and assisted the eventual unification of Hanover and Celle His mother at first opposed the marriage because she looked down on Sophia Dorothea's mother, Eleonore (who came from lower French nobility), and because she was concerned by Sophia Dorothea's legitimated status She was eventually won over by the advantages inherent in the marriage [9]\n\n\nElectoral reign\nErnest Augustus died on 23 January 1698, leaving all of his territories to George with the exception of the Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrück, an office he had held since 1661 [c] George thus became Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg (also known as Hanover, after its capital) as well as Archbannerbearer and a Prince-Elector of the Holy Roman Empire [15] His court in Hanover was graced by many cultural icons such as the mathematician and philosopher Gottfried Leibniz and the composers George Frideric Händel and Agostino Steffani.\n\n\nAccession in Great Britain and Ireland\nThough both England and Scotland recognised Anne as their queen, only the Parliament of England had settled on Sophia, Electress of Hanover, as the heir presumptive The Parliament of Scotland (the Estates) had not formally settled the succession question for the Scottish throne In 1703, the Estates passed a bill declaring that their selection for Queen Anne's successor would not be the same individual as the successor to the English throne, unless England granted full freedom of trade to Scottish merchants in England and its colonies At first Royal Assent was withheld, but the following year Anne capitulated to the wishes of the Estates and assent was granted to the bill, which became the Act of Security 1704 In response the English Parliament passed the Alien Act 1705, which threatened to restrict Anglo-Scottish trade and cripple the Scottish economy if the Estates did not agree to the Hanoverian succession [25] Eventually, in 1707, both Parliaments agreed on a Treaty of Union, which united England and Scotland into a single political entity, the Kingdom of Great Britain, and established the rules of succession as laid down by the Act of Settlement 1701 [26] The union created the largest free trade area in 18th-century Europe [27]\n\n\nWars and rebellions\nWithin a year of George's accession the Whigs won an overwhelming victory in the general election of 1715 Several members of the defeated Tory Party sympathised with the Jacobites, who sought to replace George with Anne's Catholic half-brother, James Francis Edward Stuart (called \"James III and VIII\" by his supporters and \"the Pretender\" by his opponents) Some disgruntled Tories sided with a Jacobite rebellion, which became known as \"The Fifteen\" James's supporters, led by Lord Mar, a Scottish nobleman who had previously served as a secretary of state, instigated rebellion in Scotland where support for Jacobitism was stronger than in England \"The Fifteen\", however, was a dismal failure;

[77] some of his contemporaries, such as Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, thought him unintelligent on the grounds that he was wooden in public [78] Though he was unpopular in Great Britain due to his supposed inability to speak English, such an inability may not have existed later in his reign as documents from that time show that he understood, spoke and wrote English [79] He certainly spoke fluent German and French, good Latin, and some Italian and Dutch [34] His treatment of his wife, Sophia Dorothea, became something of a scandal [80] His Lutheran faith, his overseeing both the Lutheran churches in Hanover and the Church of England, and the presence of Lutheran preachers in his court caused some consternation among his Anglican subjects [81]\n\n\nArms\nAs king, his arms were: Quarterly, I, Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for England) impaling Or a lion rampant within a tressure flory-counter-flory Gules (for Scotland); II, Azure three fleurs-de-lis Or (for France); III, Azure a harp Or stringed Argent (for Ireland); IV, tierced per pale and per chevron (for Hanover), I Gules two lions passant guardant Or (for Brunswick), II Or a semy of hearts Gules a lion rampant Azure (for Lüneburg), III Gules a horse courant Argent (for Westphalia), overall an escutcheon Gules charged with the crown of Charlemagne Or (for the dignity of Archtreasurer of the Holy Roman Empire) [86]\n\n\nIssue and mistresses\nIn addition to Melusine von der Schulenburg, three other women were said to be George's mistresses: [89] [90]\n\n\nIssue\nIn addition to Melusine von der Schulenburg, three other women were said to be George's mistresses: [89] [90]\n\n\nMistresses\nIn addition to Melusine von der Schulenburg, three other women were said to be George's mistresses: [89] [90]\n\n\nAncestry\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nSources\n\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

wanted to move on with his career [6] Ashton Kutcher switched to a recurring guest role when he also chose to depart following the seventh season [6] However, Kelso had not been written out yet, so to give better closure to the character, Kutcher appeared in the first four episodes of the eighth season (credited as a special guest star) Both Grace and Kutcher returned for the series finale, although the former was uncredited Tommy Chong (who began reappearing by late season 7 after a long absence) became a regular again to help fill Kelso's role as the dimwit of the group Eric was supposed to be replaced by his new friend Charlie, played by Bret Harrison, as an \"innocent character\", who proved fairly popular with audiences, but the character was killed off after Harrison was offered a lead role in the series The Loop [7] Another new character named Randy Pearson, played by Josh Meyers (brother of Late Night host Seth Meyers), was introduced to take the place of both Eric and, to a lesser extent, Charlie [8] Another new character, Samantha, a stripper played by Jud Tylor, was added as Hyde's wife for nine episodes The location of the show's introductory theme song was changed from the Vista Cruiser to the circle.\n\n\nProduction\nThe working titles for the show were:\n\n\nTitle\nThe working titles for the show were:\n\n\nThemes\nThe show addressed many social issues of the 1970s such as sexual attitudes of the era, generational conflict, the economic hardships of the 1970s recession, mistrust of the American government by blue-collar workers, and underage drinking/drug use The series also highlighted developments in fashion trends, [12] the entertainment industry, including the television remote (\"the clicker\"), reruns, VCRs, and cable TV; the video games Pong and Space Invaders; the cassette tape and Disco; MAD magazine; and Eric's obsession with  Star Wars, which came out in 1977 [13] The show has been compared to Happy Days, which was similarly set 20 years before the time in which it aired [14]\n\n\nThe 1970s\nThe show addressed many social issues of the 1970s such as sexual attitudes of the era, generational conflict, the

Circle, a group of characters, usually the teenagers, sit in a circle (generally in Eric's basement, though occasionally elsewhere), as the camera pans, stopping at each character as they speak It was usually apparent that the characters are under the influence of marijuana Thick clouds of smoke, frequent coughing and an extreme wide-angle lens added to the \"drug-induced\" feel, although the audience never saw anyone actually smoking the drug Also, no visible drug-related paraphernalia were seen, such as bongs or joint papers Characters never spoke the word \"marijuana\" while in The Circle (except in one episode \"Reefer Madness\"), often referring to it as \"stuff\" or a \"stash\" In the episode \"Bye-Bye Basement\", Theo (Leo's cousin) refers to \"weed\"; in \"The Relapse\", Kelso tells Fez that the concrete wall behind the gym is used mostly for \"smoking weed and beating up freshmen;\" in \"Ski Trip\" Kitty asks Eric why he is taking so much oregano to Jackie's ski lodge; in \"Eric's Burger Job\", Kelso blames his \"roach clip\" when the water bed on which he is sitting at a party deflates; in two episodes (\"That Wrestling Show\" and \"Hyde Moves In\"), Eric and Hyde can be seen wearing shirts with the words \"Cannabis sativa\" written on a Campbell's soup can; and in \"The Pill\", Red, referring to Kelso, exclaims, \"That kid's on dope!\" A gimmick related to the circle and the marijuana smoking was Eric watching the kitchen wall moving erratically, although this technique was also used to show that Eric was drunk.\n\n\nVista Cruiser\nMany of the show's episodes featured Eric and the rest of the kids in or around Eric's \"Aztec Gold\" 1969 Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser, handed down to Eric by Red in the pilot episode (after Red begrudgingly buys a 1976 Toyota Corolla, a more economical car) For the first seven seasons of the show, the show's introduction showed the cast inside the Vista Cruiser The particular station wagon was bought by Wilmer Valderrama at the show's conclusion from Carsey-Werner for \"no more than\" US$500 [16] The Vista Cruiser makes a brief appearance, in its original \"That 70's Show\" configuration, in the sequel series, That 90's Show.\n\n\nRunning gags and catchphrases\nIn one of the show's major running gags, Red often threatens to punish Eric with many variations of the catchphrase, \"my foot in your ass\" or more generally \"kicking your ass.\" [18] For example, in \"Kitty and Eric's Night Out\", Red mistakenly thinks Eric offended Kitty, so Red says, \"I swear I'll kick his ass!\" In \"Eric's Hot Cousin\", Eric tries to get out of something by claiming he is sleepwalking and Red says, \"And I'm about to be sleep-kicking your ass\", and, in \"Prank Day\", when Red gets covered in oatmeal, Eric tries to explain that it was just a prank that had gone \"horribly, horribly wrong\" Red says, \"Well, I have a prank, too One where my foot doesn't plow through your ass Let's hope it doesn't go horribly, horribly wrong!\" In the eighth season, Hyde asks Red, \"did you ever actually do that?\"  To which Red replies \"Once, during the war.. I can't talk about it.\"  Several of the running gags were shown in edited clips for the series finale.\n\n\nIn other media\nThat '70s Show was released on DVD in Regions 1, 2 and 4 by 20th Century

out of the series at the end of the seventh season, as Topher Grace wanted to move on with his career [6] Ashton Kutcher switched to a recurring guest role when he also chose to depart following the seventh season [6] However, Kelso had not been written out yet, so to give better closure to the character, Kutcher appeared in the first four episodes of the eighth season (credited as a special guest star) Both Grace and Kutcher returned for the series finale, although the former was uncredited Tommy Chong (who began reappearing by late season 7 after a long absence) became a regular again to help fill Kelso's role as the dimwit of the group Eric was supposed to be replaced by his new friend Charlie, played by Bret Harrison, as an \"innocent character\", who proved fairly popular with audiences, but the character was killed off after Harrison was offered a lead role in the series The Loop [7] Another new character named Randy Pearson, played by Josh Meyers (brother of Late Night host Seth Meyers), was introduced to take the place of both Eric and, to a lesser extent, Charlie [8] Another new character, Samantha, a stripper played by Jud Tylor, was added as Hyde's wife for nine episodes The location of the show's introductory theme song was changed from the Vista Cruiser to the circle.\n\n\nProduction\nThe working titles for the show were:\n\n\nTitle\nThe working titles for the show were:\n\n\nThemes\nThe show addressed many social issues of the 1970s such as sexual attitudes of the era, generational conflict, the economic hardships of the 1970s recession, mistrust of the American government by blue-collar workers, and underage drinking/drug use The series also highlighted developments in fashion trends, [12] the entertainment industry, including the television remote (\"the clicker\"), reruns, VCRs, and cable TV; the video games Pong and Space Invaders; the cassette tape and Disco; MAD magazine; and Eric's obsession with  Star Wars, which came out in 1977 [13] The show has been compared to Happy Days, which was similarly set 20 years before the time in which it aired [14]\n\n\nThe 1970s\nThe show addressed many social issues of the 1970s such as sexual

which it aired [14]\n\n\nThe Circle\nIn The Circle, a group of characters, usually the teenagers, sit in a circle (generally in Eric's basement, though occasionally elsewhere), as the camera pans, stopping at each character as they speak It was usually apparent that the characters are under the influence of marijuana Thick clouds of smoke, frequent coughing and an extreme wide-angle lens added to the \"drug-induced\" feel, although the audience never saw anyone actually smoking the drug Also, no visible drug-related paraphernalia were seen, such as bongs or joint papers Characters never spoke the word \"marijuana\" while in The Circle (except in one episode \"Reefer Madness\"), often referring to it as \"stuff\" or a \"stash\" In the episode \"Bye-Bye Basement\", Theo (Leo's cousin) refers to \"weed\"; in \"The Relapse\", Kelso tells Fez that the concrete wall behind the gym is used mostly for \"smoking weed and beating up freshmen;\" in \"Ski Trip\" Kitty asks Eric why he is taking so much oregano to Jackie's ski lodge; in \"Eric's Burger Job\", Kelso blames his \"roach clip\" when the water bed on which he is sitting at a party deflates; in two episodes (\"That Wrestling Show\" and \"Hyde Moves In\"), Eric and Hyde can be seen wearing shirts with the words \"Cannabis sativa\" written on a Campbell's soup can; and in \"The Pill\", Red, referring to Kelso, exclaims, \"That kid's on dope!\" A gimmick related to the circle and the marijuana smoking was Eric watching the kitchen wall moving erratically, although this technique was also used to show that Eric was drunk.\n\n\nVista Cruiser\nMany of the show's episodes featured Eric and the rest of the kids in or around Eric's \"Aztec Gold\" 1969 Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser, handed down to Eric by Red in the pilot episode (after Red begrudgingly buys a 1976 Toyota Corolla, a more economical car) For the first seven seasons of the show, the show's introduction showed the cast inside the Vista Cruiser The particular station wagon was bought by Wilmer Valderrama at the show's conclusion from Carsey-Werner for \"no more than\" US$500 [16] The Vista Cruiser makes a brief appearance, in its original \"That 70's Show\" configuration, in the sequel series, That 90's Show.\n\n\nRunning gags and catchphrases\nIn one of the show's major running gags, Red often threatens to punish Eric with many variations of the catchphrase, \"my foot in your ass\" or more generally \"kicking your ass.\" [18] For example, in \"Kitty and Eric's Night Out\", Red mistakenly thinks Eric offended Kitty, so Red says, \"I swear I'll kick his ass!\" In \"Eric's Hot Cousin\", Eric tries to get out of something by claiming he is sleepwalking and Red says, \"And I'm about to be sleep-kicking your ass\", and, in \"Prank Day\", when Red gets covered in oatmeal, Eric tries to explain that it was just a prank that had gone \"horribly, horribly wrong\" Red says, \"Well, I have a prank, too One where my foot doesn't plow through your ass Let's hope it doesn't go horribly, horribly wrong!\" In the eighth season, Hyde asks Red, \"did you ever actually do that?\"  To which Red replies \"Once, during the war.. I can't talk about it.\"  Several of the running gags were shown in edited clips for the series finale.\n\n\nIn other media\nThat '70s Show was released on DVD in Regions 1, 2 and 4 by 20th Century

region by overthrowing the powerful kingdom of Kozhikode, a long time war rival of Kochi Portuguese military commander Alfonso de Noronho trains Kochi soldiers to use firearms and offers them cannons in exchange for trading crops and spices However, the Malabar natives are displeased with the new Cartaz license system they've established which impedes trade with the Arabs Kuttiyali Marakkar, an influential merchant, finds a way to trade while bypassing Portuguese customs laws, but he's sold out by his brother-in-law Moidu who is allied with Alfonso.\n\n\nCast\nA film based on Kunjali

Mohanlal-starring Kaalapani (1996) in Kozhikode [6] Due to budget constraints, it did not progress, \"back then, our industry size was very limited and most producers weren't ready to invest hugely in such big ventures\", said Priyadarshan [7] Damodaran pitched a plot idea in 1999, but \"it was inconceivable back then to make a film that was extensively set at sea\", said Priyadarshan [8] The project was still on their mind for years [6] Priyadarshan recalled that it was difficult to shoot with one ship in Kaalapani, let alone a film with multiple ships on turbulent waters of the Arabian Sea Years later, with the advancement of visual effects and producers willing to fund the film, Priyadarshan revisited the idea [2] Meanwhile, during 2008 – 2009, director Jayaraj too planned a film on Kunjali Marakkar with Mohanlal in the title role and hired T P Rajeevan to write the screenplay It was ready to begin production and when the screenplay was handed over to Mohanlal, he did not show interest That screenplay was later bought by August Cinema from Rajeevan for making a separate project with different cast and crew [9]\n\n\nProduction\nA film based on Kunjali Marakkar was originally

August Cinema from Rajeevan for making a separate project with different cast and crew [9]\n\n\nWriting\nPriyadarshan co-wrote the screenplay with his assistant Ani Sasi Ani himself expressed interest in collaborating with Priyadarshan when he learnt that the latter was working on a film about Kunjali Marakkar [19] Priyadarshan also incorporating many inputs from late Damodaran from their early discussions The first draft was completed in April 2018 It was estimated to require seven months for pre-production and eight months for post-production [17] They completed the final draft by early June 2018 [20] The story spans the period from 1505 to 1601 [21] Marakkar IV was chosen as the protagonist not only because he has the most interesting story, but also they knew more about him than the other Marakkars, and he was the one who brought a lot of strategies, and \"everything ended with him\" [19] Priyadarshan said that not many reliable sources exist about Marakkar I, and facts about Marakkar II, III, and IV are a mystery, and their available accounts are conflicting with each other The screenplay was written with a combination of facts, fiction, and folklore He said that his characters are historical figures but they all may not be contemporaries, cinematic liberty that he has taken [2]\n\n\nCasting\nMohanlal was attached to the project in the initial discussion itself in 1996 The screenplay was written with Mohanlal in mind as Priyadarshan wanted an actor with an image that fits the larger-than-life stature of Marakkar IV [2] Priyadarshan said that, \"heroic figures like Marakkar or Velu Thampi Dalawa had this aura about them and Lal has that\", also Marakkar IV was 53 years old when he died and Mohanlal suits the age too [8] The team was then on a lookout for a Chinese actor to play the role of Chinali, Marakkar IV's trusted lieutenant [17] In May 2018, it was reported that Nagarjuna, Suniel Shetty, and Paresh Rawal has been cast alongside Mohanlal in ensemble roles [23] Shetty was confirmed to have signed the film, [24] while Nagarjuna was in talks for a role [25] Shetty grew his hair out for his role [26] In June, Nagarjuna said he has not yet heard the script and will sign only after that [27] At the end, he did not take the role [28] Madhu and Prabhu were confirmed in that month, with the former cast as Kunjali Marakkar I / Kuttiyali Marakkar [29] Prabhu plays a Tamil shipwright who build boats for Marakkar, such a character is mentioned in history [22] Madhu opted out from the film (and other films) as part of his decision to retire from cinema industry [30] Fazil took the role in his absence [21] Akshay Kumar was offered a role, but declined [31]\n\n\nFilming and production design\nPrincipal photography began on 1 December 2018 at Ramoji Film City, Hyderabad Cinematography was handled by Tirru [42] Co-writer Ani Sasi also worked as an assistant director in the film Pranav and Kalyani shot a few scenes early that month [43] A song sequence between the two was choreographed by Brinda [35] Prasanna Sujit choreographed another sequence [44] Mohanlal joined the sets in mid December [45] [46] Filming was wrapped by late March 2019 [47] Principal photography lasted 104 days [48] In an interview, Priyadarshan said that they were simultaneously shooting some scenes in Tamil [49] [50] [51] However, the Tamil version is reportedly dubbed [52] The bulk of filming took place at Ramoji Film City itself, a five-day shoot was also held in Thiruvananthapuram [53] [54] Meeting scene between the Samoothiri and the Portuguese was shot at Adimalathura [55] Kazu Neda, Sumret Muangput, and B Thyagarajan were responsible for the action sequences [56]\n\n\nPost-production\nM S Aiyappan Nair was the editor, digital intermediate was processed by Prime Focus studio M R Rajakrishnan of Sync Cinema was the sound designer Around a quarter of the film is set in sea, nonetheless, the film was never shot on sea, except for a shot of sea shore The sea was completely created using visual effects Priyadarshan's son Siddharth Priyadarshan worked as the film's visual effects supervisor, he hired his son to reduce the film's cost Siddharth divided the graphics work among four personnel The film was shot using storyboard (which is scarcely used in Indian productions) as it is helpful in creating visual effects [65] In Priyadarshan's view, success of a film like Lion of the Arabian Sea depends largely on the fineness of graphics, \"if you don't get your graphics right, the film will look terrible Which we have seen often in Indian cinema\" [66] Priyadarshan said that the most difficult thing to create in VFX is water and fire, for that they bought necessary software from Austria and Hungary [67] Pune-based Anibrain, and two Chennai-based Knack Studios and Golden Star Studio were employed for the film's visual effects creation [68] Post-production began in Chennai as soon as they completed filming It was expected to last 11 months, with eight months consuming for visual effects alone [48] Post-production took 14 months to complete [8] The film was reportedly completed with a cost of ₹85 – 100 crore [2] [69] [70] The film's theatrical cut runs for 181.07 minutes It underwent censoring in India on 23 December 2019 [71]\n\n\nMusic\nThe original score was composed by Rahul Raj, Ankit Suri and Lyell Evans Roeder Suri and Roeder, composers of Alternative Fidelity, a British-American music production house were hired to compose the score for battle sequences in the film It was also their debut in Malayalam cinema [72] A few months later, Rahul Raj, who freshly graduated from Berklee College of Music was hired to independently compose and produce the rest of the score [73] Raj was chosen by Priyadarshan after being impressed watching a video of him conducting a 52-piece London orchestra as part of his thesis in Berklee [74] While scoring, Raj avoided giving a regional touch to the music which would have been easier for a film set in Malabar, as Priyadarshan was clear that he was making a film which caters for a global audience and it should resonate in its music too [75] Deviating from his usual norm, Priyadarshan who is known for giving references and definitive instructions to his composers, gave full creative freedom to Rahul Raj for scoring His only instruction was to imagine as if he is working for a Hollywood epic and compose with that on mind Raj wanted a soundscape that could bring an epic feel as in films produced during the golden age of Hollywood [74] He mentioned Ben-Hur and The Ten Commandments as examples [75] Beside composing, Rahul Raj also performed programming and production entirely by himself as opposed to have additional programmers in many regular film scores The Chennai Strings Orchestra played string pieces for some of the significant portions [74]\n\n\nMarketing\nOn 22 September 2019, The first teaser trailer of the film was exclusively screened at Aashirvadathode Lalettan, an event held at Gokulam Park, Kochi, organised by Aashirvad Cinemas [84] The first trailer released in March 2020 was edited by Alphonse Putharen [85] In November 2021, a promotional event was conducted on the luxury cruise ship Nefertiti Cruise, organised in association with Jain International School of Creative Arts [86]\n\n\nRelease\nThe film was originally scheduled to be released on 19 March 2020, as announced in October 2019 [87] It was then moved to 26 March by January 2020 [88] However, it was further postponed without a release date after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic [89] Priyadarshan said that the postponement was at the behest of exhibitors in the Gulf, particularly those across Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, as the box office collection from these countries are crucial to the film's success [90] In February 2021, Mohanlal told to Variety that it is a global film with an international

"Marakkar: Lion of the Arabian Sea\n\nMarakkar: Lion of the Arabian Sea is a 2021 Indian Malayalam-language epic historical action drama film directed by Priyadarshan and produced by Antony Perumbavoor under the banner of Aashirvad Cinemas. The film stars Mohanlal in the title role, alongside Suniel Shetty, Prabhu, and Madhu in supporting roles. The film is based on the life of Kunjali Marakkar, a naval commander of the Zamorin of Calicut who fought against the Portuguese in the 16th century.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film is set in the 16th century and revolves around the life of Kunjali Marakkar, a naval commander of the Zamorin of Calicut. The Zamorin, a powerful king of Calicut, has allied with the Portuguese to expand his kingdom and overpower his enemies. However, Kunjali Marakkar, a skilled naval commander, opposes the alliance and leads a rebellion against the Portuguese.\n\nThe film begins with the arrival of the Portuguese in Calicut, led by Alfonso de Noronha, a Portuguese military commander. Noronha trains the Kochi soldiers to use firearms and offers them cannons in exchange for trading crops and spices. However, the Malabar natives are displeased with the new Cartaz license system established by the Portuguese, which impedes trade with the Arabs.\n\nKunjali Marakkar, an influential merchant, finds a way to trade while bypassing the Portuguese customs laws. However, he is sold out by his brother-in-law, Moidu, who is allied with Noronha. This betrayal leads to a confrontation between Kunjali Marakkar and Noronha, resulting in the former's banishment from Calicut.\n\nUndeterred, Kunjali Marakkar returns to Calicut and rallies the locals to join his rebellion against the Portuguese. He builds a fleet of ships and engages in a series of battles against the Portuguese, led by Noronha. The film culminates in a massive naval battle between the two forces, which ends in the victory of the Malabar natives.\n\n**Cast**\n\nMohanlal was attached to the project in the initial discussion itself in 1996. The screenplay was written with Mohanlal in mind as Priyadarshan wanted an actor with an image that fits the larger-than-life stature of Marakkar IV. The team was then on a lookout for a Chinese actor to play the role of Chinali, Marakkar IV's trusted lieutenant. In May 2018, it was reported that Nagarjuna, Suniel Shetty, and Paresh Rawal had been cast alongside Mohanlal in ensemble roles. Shetty was confirmed to have signed the film, while Nagarjuna was in talks for a role. However, Nagarjuna eventually dropped out of the project.\n\nMadhu was originally cast as Kunjali Marakkar I / Kuttiyali Marakkar, but he opted out of the film as part of his decision to retire from the film industry. Fazil took the role in his absence. Akshay Kumar was also offered a role, but he declined.\n\n**Filming and Production Design**\n\nPrincipal photography began on 1 December 2018 at Ramoji Film City, Hyderabad. The film was shot using a combination of traditional and digital techniques. The cinematography was handled by Tirru, who used a combination of 35mm film and digital cameras to capture the film's visuals. The production design was handled by Sabu Cyril, who built sets and created costumes for the film.\n\nThe film's action sequences were choreographed by Kazu Neda, Sumret Muangput, and B Thyagarajan. The visual effects were created by Anibrain, Knack Studios, and Golden Star Studio, with the supervision of Siddharth Priyadarshan, Priyadarshan's son.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe original score was composed by Rahul Raj, Ankit Suri, and Lyell Evans Roeder. Suri and Roeder, composers of Alternative Fidelity, a British-American music production house, were hired to compose the score for the battle sequences in the film. A few months later, Rahul Raj, who had freshly graduated from Berklee College of Music, was hired to independently compose and produce the rest of the score.\n\nRaj was chosen by Priyadarshan after being impressed by a video of him conducting a 52-piece London orchestra as part of his thesis in Berklee. While scoring, Raj avoided giving a regional touch to the music, which would have been easier for a film set in Malabar, as Priyadarshan was clear that he was making a film that caters to a global audience and it should resonate in its music too.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nOn 22 September 2019, the first teaser trailer of the film was exclusively screened at Aashirvadathode Lalettan, an event held at Gokulam Park, Kochi, organized by Aashirvad Cinemas. The first trailer released in March 2020 was edited by Alphonse Putharen. In November 2021, a promotional event was conducted on the luxury cruise ship Nefertiti Cruise, organized in association with Jain International School of Creative Arts.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe film was originally scheduled to be released on 19 March 2020, as announced in October 2019. However, it was postponed several times due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film was eventually released on 3 December 2021.\n\n**Distribution**\n\nThe film was reported to be releasing in more than 5000 theaters worldwide in March 2020, in more than 50 countries worldwide, which would make it the largest release for a Malayalam film up until then. Besides the original Malayalam version, the film also has dubbed versions in Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and Kannada.\n\n**Home Media**\n\nMarakkar was released on Amazon Prime Video in Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Hindi on 17 December 2021.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics and audience.

of Mohanlal-starring Kaalapani (1996) in Kozhikode [6] Due to budget constraints, it did not progress, \"back then, our industry size was very limited and most producers weren't ready to invest hugely in such big ventures\", said Priyadarshan [7] Damodaran pitched a plot idea in 1999, but \"it was inconceivable back then to make a film that was extensively set at sea\", said Priyadarshan [8] The project was still on their mind for years [6] Priyadarshan recalled that it was difficult to shoot with one ship in Kaalapani, let alone a film with multiple ships on turbulent waters of the Arabian Sea Years later, with the advancement of visual effects and producers willing to fund the film, Priyadarshan revisited the idea [2] Meanwhile, during 2008 – 2009, director Jayaraj too planned a film on Kunjali Marakkar with Mohanlal in the title role and hired T P Rajeevan to write the screenplay It was ready to begin production and when the screenplay was handed over to Mohanlal, he did not show

in collaborating with Priyadarshan when he learnt that the latter was working on a film about Kunjali Marakkar [19] Priyadarshan also incorporating many inputs from late Damodaran from their early discussions The first draft was completed in April 2018 It was estimated to require seven months for pre-production and eight months for post-production [17] They completed the final draft by early June 2018 [20] The story spans the period from 1505 to 1601 [21] Marakkar IV was chosen as the protagonist not only because he has the most interesting story, but also they knew more about him than the other Marakkars, and he was the one who brought a lot of strategies, and \"everything ended with him\" [19] Priyadarshan said that not many reliable sources exist about Marakkar I, and facts about Marakkar II, III, and IV are a mystery, and their available accounts are conflicting with each other The screenplay was written with a combination of facts, fiction, and folklore He said that his characters are historical figures but they all may not be contemporaries, cinematic liberty that he has taken [2]\n\n\nCasting\nMohanlal was attached to the project in the initial discussion itself in 1996 The screenplay was written with Mohanlal in mind as Priyadarshan wanted an actor with an image that fits the larger-than-life stature of Marakkar IV [2] Priyadarshan said that, \"heroic figures like Marakkar or Velu Thampi Dalawa had this aura about them and Lal has that\", also Marakkar IV was 53 years old when he died and Mohanlal suits the age too [8] The team was then on a lookout for a Chinese actor to play the role of Chinali, Marakkar IV's trusted lieutenant [17] In May 2018, it was reported that Nagarjuna, Suniel Shetty, and Paresh Rawal has been cast alongside Mohanlal in ensemble roles [23] Shetty was confirmed to have signed the film, [24] while Nagarjuna was in talks for a role [25] Shetty grew his hair out for his role [26] In June, Nagarjuna said he has not yet heard the script and will sign only after that [27] At the end, he did not take the role [28] Madhu and Prabhu were confirmed in that month, with the former cast as Kunjali Marakkar I / Kuttiyali Marakkar [29] Prabhu plays a Tamil shipwright who build boats for Marakkar, such a character is mentioned in history [22] Madhu opted out from the film (and other films) as part of his decision to retire from cinema industry [30] Fazil took the role in his absence [21] Akshay Kumar was offered a role, but declined [31]\n\n\nFilming and production design\nPrincipal photography began on 1 December 2018 at Ramoji Film City, Hyderabad Cinematography was handled by Tirru [42] Co-writer Ani Sasi also worked as an assistant director in the film Pranav and Kalyani shot a few scenes early that month [43] A song sequence between the two was choreographed by Brinda [35] Prasanna Sujit choreographed another sequence [44] Mohanlal joined the sets in mid December [45] [46] Filming was wrapped by late March 2019 [47] Principal photography lasted 104 days [48] In an interview, Priyadarshan said that they were simultaneously shooting some scenes in Tamil [49] [50] [51] However, the Tamil version is reportedly dubbed [52] The bulk of filming took place at Ramoji Film City itself, a five-day shoot was also held in Thiruvananthapuram [53] [54] Meeting scene between the Samoothiri and the Portuguese was shot at Adimalathura [55] Kazu Neda, Sumret Muangput, and B Thyagarajan were responsible for the action sequences [56]\n\n\nPost-production\nM S Aiyappan Nair was the editor, digital intermediate was processed by Prime Focus studio M R Rajakrishnan of Sync Cinema was the sound designer Around a quarter of the film is set in sea, nonetheless, the film was never shot on sea, except for a shot of sea shore The sea was completely created using visual effects Priyadarshan's son Siddharth Priyadarshan worked as the film's visual effects supervisor, he hired his son to reduce the film's cost Siddharth divided the graphics work among four personnel The film was shot using storyboard (which is scarcely used in Indian productions) as it is helpful in creating visual effects [65] In Priyadarshan's view, success of a film like Lion of the Arabian Sea depends largely on the fineness of graphics, \"if you don't get your graphics right, the film will look terrible Which we have seen often in Indian cinema\" [66] Priyadarshan said that the most difficult thing to create in VFX is water and fire, for that they bought necessary software from Austria and Hungary [67] Pune-based Anibrain, and two Chennai-based Knack Studios and Golden Star Studio were employed for the film's visual effects creation [68] Post-production began in Chennai as soon as they completed filming It was expected to last 11 months, with eight months consuming for visual effects alone [48] Post-production took 14 months to complete [8] The film was reportedly completed with a cost of

was chosen by Priyadarshan after being impressed watching a video of him conducting a 52-piece London orchestra as part of his thesis in Berklee [74] While scoring, Raj avoided giving a regional touch to the music which would have been easier for a film set in Malabar, as Priyadarshan was clear that he was making a film which caters for a global audience and it should resonate in its music too [75] Deviating from his usual norm, Priyadarshan who is known for giving references and definitive instructions to his composers, gave full creative freedom to Rahul Raj for scoring His only instruction was to imagine as if he is working for a Hollywood epic and compose with that on mind Raj wanted a soundscape that could bring an epic feel as in films produced during the golden age of Hollywood [74] He mentioned Ben-Hur and The Ten Commandments as examples [75] Beside composing, Rahul Raj also performed programming and production entirely by himself as opposed to have additional programmers in many regular film scores The Chennai Strings Orchestra played string pieces for some of the significant portions [74]\n\n\nMarketing\nOn 22 September 2019, The first teaser trailer of the film was

chronologically with Episode I – The Phantom Menace (1999) and concludes with Episode IX – The Rise of Skywalker (2019).\n\n\nStandalone films\nAs Lucas was outlining a trilogy of trilogies, he also imagined making additional movies unrelated to the Skywalker Saga [19] The first theatrical films set outside the main episodic series were the Ewok spin-off films Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure (1984) and Ewoks: The Battle for Endor (1985), the first of which was screened internationally after being produced for television [20]\n\n\nAnimated film\nPreceding the airing of the

the development of a Kasdan film [31] and Entertainment Weekly reported that it would focus on Han Solo [32] Disney CFO Jay Rasulo has described the standalone films as origin stories [22] Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy confirmed that there was \"no attempt being made to carry characters (from the standalone films) in and out of the saga episodes.\" [33] The standalone films are subtitled \"A Star Wars Story\" [23] [34]\n\n\nRogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016)\nRogue One is set directly before Episode IV: A New Hope and focuses on the eponymous group of rebels who obtain the plans to the Death Star [35] Its laser was developed by scientist Galen Erso (played by Mads Mikkelsen) after the Empire forcibly abducted him, separating him from his daughter Jyn Galen secretly sends a defecting Imperial pilot, Bodhi Rook, to deliver a message warning of the weapon's existence and revealing its weakness to his rebel friend Saw Gerrera Under the false promise of her father's liberation, Jyn agrees to help Rebel Alliance intelligence officer Cassian Andor and his droid K-2SO retrieve the message from Saw, now the paranoid leader of an extremist cell of rebels.\n\n\nSolo: A

the future era of the galaxy.\" [105] According to Jenkins, the film would be an original story \"with great influence from the games and the books\" [106] A script was being worked on as of December 2020, [107] at which time, Wonder Woman 3's story was still being worked on [108] Matthew Robinson was hired to write Rogue Squadron in May 2021; [109] [110] late the next month, Jenkins revealed that the script was almost finished [111] On November 8, the film's production was delayed from 2022 due to Jenkins' busy schedule [112] A month later, Jenkins had left her planned Cleopatra film as

film franchise [121] The project was considered to have been \"back-burnered\" by May 2022 due to Johnson's involvement with other projects, including the Knives Out franchise [89] Johnson indicated that he would make at least one more film in that series following Glass Onion before returning to Star Wars [122] [123]\n\n\nProduced for television\nThe first spin-off film (also the first sequel to

DVD Although based on stories written by George Lucas, they do not bear Star Wars in their titles, and were considered to exist in a lower level of canon than the episodic films Following Disney's acquisition of the franchise, they were excluded from the canon [133] [20] The Battle for Endor would be the last live-action Star Wars television project produced by Lucasfilm until 2019's The

relocated to California during the early 1960s Geography does play a minor role in the rivalry; however there exists more respect between both teams and fans alike, unlike the Dodgers–Giants rivalry of MLB, or the 49ers–Rams rivalry of the NFL in which both teams express fierce animosity against one another [303] [304] The rivalry began to sprout during the 1970s as the two teams would meet six times in the postseason from 1967 to 1991 Both teams fluctuated in success at varying times, however; the Lakers recent rise following the signing of LeBron James contributed heavily to adding a level of competition between both sides as James had previously faced the Warriors in four straight finals as a member of the Cavaliers Both teams have met seven times in the postseason, combining for 38 division titles since both teams relocated to California in the early 1960s [305] [306] The Lakers lead the all time regular season series 262–173, and the postseason series 25–11 [307] [308]\n\n\nLos

Chalfen purchased the NBL's disbanded Detroit Gems for $15,000 in 1947, changed their name to the Lakers, and relocated them to Minnesota Max Winter bought a third of the club in their early years and sold his share to Mikan in 1954 Berger bought Mikan's share in 1956 giving him a controlling (⅔) interest [314] After Mikan retired, attendance plummeted and the team lost money for several seasons, leading the ownership group to put the team up for sale in 1957 [315] Marty Marion, a retired baseball player and manager, and his business partner Milton Fischman attempted to purchase the team with the intention of moving the club to Kansas City, Missouri [315] [316] Mikan offered to mortgage his home in an attempt to buy the team and keep the club in Minnesota [317] The Lakers were sold to a group of investors led by Bob Short, however [314] The team was sold to Short's group with the agreement that it would not be relocated to Kansas City but kept in Minnesota [318] Short's ownership group consisted of 117 Minnesota businesses and private citizens, who amassed a total of $200,000 for the purchase; $150,000 to buy the team and $50,000 to run it [314] By 1958 Short had become 80% owner of the team by buying out his partners, [314] but the team was floundering Attendance remained poor, and the NBA had put the Lakers on \"financial probation\", notifying them that if they did not meet certain ticket sales numbers they could be bought out by the league and relocated Short was forced to move the team to Los Angeles in 1960; the club had lost $60,000 in the first half of the 1959–60 season alone [319] The NBA's owners originally voted 7–1 against the move [320] When Short indicated that he might take the team to a new rival league that was developing, however, the owners held another vote that same day and allowed the relocation (8–0) [321] Aided by Baylor's drawing power, [322] [323] and the new locale, the team's finances improved when they arrived in LA [324] [325] Short sold the team to Washington Redskins owner and publisher Jack Kent Cooke in 1965 for a then league record amount of $5.175 million [326] Short insisted the deal be conducted in cash as he was wary of Cooke, so guards transported the money in a cart from one New York bank to another [327]\n\n\nName, logo, and uniforms\nThe Laker nickname came from the state of Minnesota being the Land of 10,000 Lakes [14] [349] The team's colors are purple, gold and white [350] [6] [351] The Lakers logo consists of the team name, \"Los Angeles Lakers\" written in purple on top of a gold basketball The

Short sold the team to Washington Redskins owner and publisher Jack Kent Cooke in 1965 for a then league record amount of $5.175 million [326] Short insisted the deal be conducted in cash as he was

Many readers do not fully understand the community's processes, and not all tags get addressed in a timely manner, staying in place for months or years, forming an ever-growing Wikipedia backlog—this itself can be a problem.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nIn the collaborative editing community of Wikipedia, editors work together to create and improve articles on a wide range of topics. When an editor adds a fact or statement to an article, it is essential to verify the information through credible sources to ensure its accuracy and reliability. A \"citation needed\" tag is a request for another editor to supply a source for the tagged fact, which serves as a reminder to provide evidence to support the statement. This tag is a crucial aspect of the editing process, as it helps maintain the integrity and trustworthiness of Wikipedia content.\n\n**When to use this tag**\n\nA \"citation needed\" tag is used to request another editor to supply a source for the tagged fact. This tag is not a criticism of the original editor, but rather a call to action to provide evidence to support the statement. It is essential to use this tag when the source of the information is unclear or when the statement is not supported by credible sources. In such cases, the tag serves as a reminder to the original editor to verify the information and provide a reliable source.\n\n**When not to use this tag**\n\nBefore adding a tag, it is essential to consider the following alternatives, one of which may prove much more constructive:\n\n*   **Delete the statement**: If the statement is not supported by credible sources, it may be more effective to delete it altogether rather than adding a tag.\n*   **Verifying the information**: Try to verify the information through credible sources before adding a tag.\n*   **Clarify the statement**: If the statement is unclear, try to clarify it before adding a tag.\n\n**If your work has been tagged**\n\nIf your work has been tagged with a \"citation needed\" statement, it is essential to address the issue promptly. Here are some steps you can take:\n\n1.  **Verify the information**: Verify the information through credible sources to ensure its accuracy and reliability.\n2.  **Provide a reliable source**: Provide a reliable source to support the statement.\n3.  **Edit the article**: Edit the article to reflect the new information and remove the \"citation needed\" tag.\n\n**How to help reduce the backlog**\n\nThere are 533,030 articles with \"Citation needed\" statements. You can browse the whole list of these articles at Category:All articles with unsourced statements.

He was born in Dakar, Senegal, and moved to France at the age of 10, where he was adopted by a French couple. Adams' life was marked by both success and tragedy, as he achieved notable honors in his club and international careers, but was also the victim of a medical error that left him in a coma for 39 years.\n\n## **Early Life**\n\nAdams was born and raised in Dakar, the capital city of Senegal, until the age of 10, when he left his native country on a pilgrimage to Montargis in the Loiret department accompanied by his grandmother, a devout Catholic. When they arrived, she enrolled him at a local Catholic school, Saint-Louis de Montargis. Adams was adopted by a French couple shortly after his arrival in the country, which marked the beginning of a new chapter in his life.\n\n## **Club Career**\n\nAdams started playing football with Entente BFN in 1967 as a striker, with whom he was runner-up in the Championnat de France Amateur twice. In 1970, he signed a contract with Nîmes, going on to remain in Division 1 for the following nine seasons. During his time at Nîmes, Adams established himself as a skilled and prolific striker, earning him recognition as one of the top players in the league. He later represented Nice and Paris Saint-Germain, with whom he won several honors and continued to demonstrate his exceptional skill and dedication to the sport.\n\n## **International Career**\n\nOn 15 June 1972, Adams made his debut for the France national team in an unofficial exhibition game against an African XI selected by the Confederation of African Football. His first competitive cap came on 13 October of that year, in a 1–0 home win over the Soviet Union for the 1974 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. Adams went on to earn several more caps for the national team, cementing his place as a respected and skilled player on the international stage.\n\n## **Personal Life, Injury, and Death**\n\nAdams and his wife Bernadette were married in April 1969 and had two sons, Laurent (born 1969) and Frédéric (1976). However, in March 1982, Adams suffered a devastating injury that would change the course of his life forever. Following a ligament rupture, he was hospitalized for surgery at the Édouard Herriot Hospital in Lyon. Due to a strike by hospital staff, errors were made by his anesthetist and a trainee, who later admitted to being \"not up to the task.\" As a result, Adams suffered a bronchospasm, which starved his brain of oxygen, and he slipped into a coma.\n\nAdams spent 39 years in a coma, a tragedy that was met with widespread shock and sadness. Despite the efforts of his family and medical professionals, he never regained consciousness and passed away on December 6, 2021, at the age of 74. His death was a poignant reminder of the fragility of life and the importance of prioritizing patient care and safety in medical settings.\n\n## **Honours**\n\nEntente BFN, Adams' first club, was a significant part of his early career, and he was honored to have been a part of the team that reached the finals of the Championnat de France Amateur twice.

I am Rose!

wouldn't go off for days even despite all my washing I was pushed, literally dragged from one studio to another A terrible thing to do to a 13-year-old child.\"\n\n\nCareer fluctuations in the 1970s (1971–1977)\nRekha subsequently got several offers but nothing of substance, as her roles were mostly just of a glamour girl [36] [57] She was highly prolific during the decade, working on average in ten films a year, most of which were deemed potboilers and failed to propel her career forward in terms of roles and appreciation [58] She appeared in several commercially successful films at the time, including Raampur Ka Lakshman (1972), Kahani Kismat Ki (1973), and Pran Jaye Par Vachan Na Jaye (1974), yet she was not regarded for her acting abilities and—according to the author Tejaswini Ganti—\"the industry was surprised by her success as her dark complexion, plump figure, and garish clothing contradicted the norms of beauty prevalent in the film industry and in society.\" [36] [19] In 1975, she appeared in the war film Aakraman as Rakesh Roshan's wife Sheetal, a role Qurratulain Hyder thought was cliché and labelled \"a clothes-horse\" [59] Randhir Kapoor's Dharam Karam is a drama about a hoodlum, and Link magazine noted that Rekha's part in it is the most pathetic of the entire cast [60] The mafia film Dharmatma was her only financial success of the year [61] [62] Directed by and starring Feroz Khan, the film saw her in the part of Anu, Khan's childhood sweetheart [63] Additional films include Kabeela, about her appearance in which critic Gautam Kundu wrote that she \"manages to be as undistinguished as the script will allow, which is plenty\" [64]\n\n\nTurning point, stardom, and parallel cinema (1978–1984)\nRekha's turning point came in 1978, with her portrayal of a rape victim in the social drama Ghar [80] She plays Aarti, a newly married woman who gets gravely traumatized after being gang-raped The film follows her character's struggle and traumatised with the help of her husband (Vinod Mehra) [81] The film was considered her first notable milestone, [36] and her performance was acclaimed by both critics and audiences [28] [82] Dinesh Raheja elaborated, \"Ghar heralded the arrival of a mature Rekha Her archetypal jubilance was replaced by her very realistic portrayal...\" [44] She received her first nomination for Best Actress at the Filmfare Awards [19] In that same year, her another release, Muqaddar Ka Sikandar, emerged as the biggest hit of that year, as well as one of the biggest hits of the decade, and Rekha was set as one of the most successful actresses of these times [83] The film opened to a positive critical reception, [84] and Rekha's brief role as a tawaif named Zohrabai earned her a Best Supporting Actress nomination at the Filmfare [19] [85] M L Dhawan of The Tribune noted her \"smouldering intensity\" [81] Rekha recalled this phase as a period of self-discovery [86] Other films that year include Karmayogi [87]\n\n\nSetback and resurgence (1985–1989)\nApart from parallel cinema, Rekha took on other increasingly adventurous roles She was among the early actresses to play lead roles in heroine-oriented revenge films, the first of which was Khoon Bhari Maang in 1988 [131] Made by Rakesh Roshan specifically with Rekha in mind, the film featured her in the role Aarti Saxena, a wealthy, unassuming widow who narrowly survives an attempted murder by her scheming second husband and—presumed to be dead—returns to seek revenge under a concealed identity She won her second Filmfare Award for her performance in the film Rekha went on to describe Khoon Bhari Maang as \"the first and only film I concentrated and understood all throughout.\" [132] M.L Dhawan from The Tribune, while documenting the famous Hindi films of 1988, remarked that Khoon Bhari Maang was \"a crowning glory for Rekha, who rose like a phoenix .. and bedazzled the audience with her daredevilry.\" [133] Encyclopædia Britannica's Encyclopædia of Hindi Cinema listed her role in the film as one of Hindi cinema's memorable female characters, noting it for changing \"the perception of the ever-forgiving wife, turning her into an avenging angel.\" [134] In a similar list by Screen magazine, the role was included as one of \"ten memorable roles that made the Hindi film heroine proud.\" [135]\n\n\nCareer fluctuations and short revival (1990–1999)\nThe 1990s saw a drop in Rekha's success Few of her films were successful and many of her roles were condemned by reviewers Critics still

"**Rekha**\n\nRekha, born Bhanurekha Ganesan, is an Indian actress who has appeared in over 180 films in a career spanning more than four decades. She is one of the most successful and iconic actresses in Indian cinema, known for her versatility, range, and dedication to her craft. Rekha has won numerous awards, including two Filmfare Awards, and has been recognized with several other honors for her contributions to Indian cinema.\n\n**Early Life and Work**\n\nRekha was born on 10 October 1954 in Madras (present-day Chennai) to South Indian actors Gemini Ganesan and Pushpavalli. Her father was previously married to T R \"Bobjima\" Alamelu and had four children from that marriage. Rekha's mother had two children from her previous marriage to the lawyer I V Rangachari. Ganesan and Pushpavalli had another daughter, Radha, born in 1955. Rekha's maternal grandfather was a Telugu-speaking lawyer, and her mother tongue is Telugu, although she is also fluent in Tamil and Hindi.\n\nRekha's early life was marked by a nomadic existence, as her father's career as an actor took him to various locations in India. She has mentioned in interviews that she was often left alone and had to fend for herself, which had a profound impact on her personality and career choices.\n\n**Early Roles (1968–1970)**\n\nRekha's entry into films was accidental, when she was just 13 years old. She was discovered by a film producer who saw her performing in a school play. Rekha's early roles were mostly small and insignificant, and she was often typecast as a \"jungle girl\" or a \"dancer.\" However, she was determined to make a mark in the film industry and worked tirelessly to hone her craft.\n\n**Career Fluctuations in the 1970s (1971–1977)**\n\nIn the early 1970s, Rekha started to receive more substantial roles, but they were mostly limited to glamour girl roles. She appeared in several commercially successful films, including Raampur Ka Lakshman, Kahani Kismat Ki, and Pran Jaye Par Vachan Na Jaye. However, she was not regarded for her acting abilities, and the industry was surprised by her success, given her dark complexion, plump figure, and garish clothing, which contradicted the norms of beauty prevalent in the film industry and in society.\n\n**Turning Point, Stardom, and Parallel Cinema (1978–1984)**\n\nRekha's turning point came in 1978, with her portrayal of a rape victim in the social drama Ghar. Her performance was acclaimed by both critics and audiences, and she received her first nomination for Best Actress at the Filmfare Awards. The film was considered a milestone in her career, as it showcased her range and depth as an actress.\n\nIn the same year, she appeared in Muqaddar Ka Sikandar, which emerged as the biggest hit of that year and one of the biggest hits of the decade. Rekha's brief role as a tawaif named Zohrabai earned her a Best Supporting Actress nomination at the Filmfare Awards. Her performance in the film was noted for its \"smouldering intensity\" by M L Dhawan of The Tribune.\n\nRekha's success with Ghar and Muqaddar Ka Sikandar marked a turning point in her career, as she transitioned from being a glamour girl to a serious actress. She went on to appear in several parallel cinema films, including Karmayogi, which showcased her versatility and range as an actress.\n\n**Setback and Resurgence (1985–1989)**\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Rekha's career experienced a setback, as she struggled to find meaningful roles. However, she continued to work in the film industry, taking on increasingly adventurous roles. In 1988, she appeared in Khoon Bhari Maang, a heroine-oriented revenge film, which marked a resurgence in her career. Her performance in the film earned her her second Filmfare Award, and she was recognized as a leading actress in the industry.\n\nRekha's success with Khoon Bhari Maang was followed by several other successful films, including Phool Bane Angaray, which showcased her range and depth as an actress.\n\n**Career Fluctuations and Short Revival (1990–1999)**\n\nIn the 1990s, Rekha's career experienced a decline, as she struggled to find meaningful roles. However, she continued to work in the film industry, taking on leading roles in several films. In 1991, she appeared in Phool Bane Angaray, which was a box-office hit and earned her a Best Actress nomination at the Filmfare Awards.\n\n**Recognition for Character Roles (2000–2006)**\n\nIn the 2000s, Rekha appeared in relatively few films, but she started to receive recognition for her character roles. In 2001, she appeared in Bulandi, directed by T Rama Rao, and in 2002, she appeared in Zubeidaa, co-starring Karisma Kapoor and Manoj Vajapayee.\n\n**Occasional Work; Hiatus (2007–present)**\n\nIn 2007, Rekha appeared in Goutam Ghose's Yatra, a film that failed to do well. In 2010, she was awarded the Padma Shri, the 4th highest civilian award given by the Government of India.\n\n**Personal Life and Off-Screen Work**\n\nIn 1990, Rekha married Delhi-based industrialist Mukesh Aggarwal. Aggarwal was a self-made entrepreneur and owner of the kitchenware brand Hotline. However, he struggled with depression, and in 1991, he died by suicide, leaving a note, \"Don't blame anyone.\" Rekha was pilloried by the press at that time, but she continued to work in the film industry and eventually came out of the eclipse unblemished.\n\n**Image and Artistry**\n\nRekha is known for her versatility, range, and dedication to her craft. She has been recognized as one of the most iconic actresses in Indian cinema, known for her \"tempestuous woman\" image, which has made her a subject of fascination for audiences and critics alike.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Rekha\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and work\nRekha was born Bhanurekha Ganesan in Madras (present-day Chennai) on 10 October 1954 to South Indian actors Gemini Ganesan and Pushpavalli, when the couple were unmarried [3] [4] Ganesan was previously married to T R \"Bobjima\" Alamelu and had four children: the Illinois-based radiation oncologist Revathi Swaminathan, the gynecologist Kamala Selvaraj, The Times of India's journalist Narayani Ganesan, and the medical doctor Jaya Shreedhar [5] [6] He had two more children with actress Savitri—Vijaya Chamundeswari, a fitness expert, and Sathish Kumaar [6] [7] [8] Meanwhile, Pushpavalli had two children (Babuji and Rama) from her earlier marriage to the lawyer I V Rangachari [9] Ganesan and Pushpavalli had another daughter, Radha (born 1955) [10] [11] Nagaprasad and the actress Shubha are her cousins, while Vedantam Raghavayya and his wife Suryaprabha are her uncle and aunt, respectively [12] Born to a Tamil father and a Telugu mother, Rekha's mother tongue is Telugu and is a fluent speaker of Telugu, [13] but she has mentioned that \"at home we used to talk in English, barely spoke in Telugu\", [14] and that she thinks in English [15] She is also fluent in Tamil and Hindi.\n\n\nFilm career\n\"Bombay was like a jungle, and I had walked in unarmed It was one of the most frightening phases of my life..

(1971–1977)\nRekha subsequently got several offers but nothing of substance, as her roles were mostly just of a glamour girl [36] [57] She was highly prolific during the decade, working on average in ten films a year, most of which were deemed potboilers and failed to propel her career forward in terms of roles and appreciation [58] She appeared in several commercially successful films at the time, including Raampur Ka Lakshman (1972), Kahani Kismat Ki (1973), and Pran Jaye Par Vachan Na Jaye (1974), yet she was not regarded for her acting abilities and—according to the author Tejaswini Ganti—\"the industry was surprised by her success as her dark complexion, plump figure, and garish clothing contradicted the norms of beauty prevalent in the film industry and in society.\" [36] [19] In 1975, she appeared in the war film Aakraman as Rakesh Roshan's wife Sheetal, a role Qurratulain Hyder thought was cliché and labelled \"a clothes-horse\" [59] Randhir Kapoor's Dharam Karam is a drama about a hoodlum, and Link magazine noted that Rekha's part in it is the most pathetic of the entire cast [60] The mafia film Dharmatma was her only financial success of the year [61] [62] Directed by and starring Feroz Khan, the film saw her in the part of Anu, Khan's childhood sweetheart [63] Additional films include Kabeela, about her appearance in which critic Gautam Kundu wrote that she \"manages to be as undistinguished as the script will allow, which is plenty\" [64]\n\n\nTurning point, stardom, and parallel cinema (1978–1984)\nRekha's turning point came in 1978, with her portrayal of a rape victim in the social drama Ghar [80] She plays Aarti, a newly married woman who gets gravely traumatized after being gang-raped The film follows her character's struggle and traumatised with the help of her husband (Vinod Mehra) [81] The film was considered her first notable milestone, [36] and her performance was acclaimed by both critics and audiences [28] [82] Dinesh Raheja elaborated, \"Ghar heralded the arrival of a mature Rekha Her archetypal jubilance was replaced by her very realistic portrayal...\" [44] She received her first nomination for Best Actress at the Filmfare Awards [19] In that same year, her another release, Muqaddar Ka Sikandar, emerged as the biggest hit of that year, as well as one of the biggest hits of the decade, and Rekha was set as one of the most successful actresses of these times [83] The film opened to a positive critical reception, [84] and Rekha's brief role as a tawaif named Zohrabai earned her a Best Supporting Actress nomination at the Filmfare [19] [85] M L Dhawan of The Tribune noted her \"smouldering intensity\" [81] Rekha recalled this phase as a period of self-discovery [86] Other films that year include Karmayogi [87]\n\n\nSetback and resurgence (1985–1989)\nApart from parallel cinema, Rekha took on other increasingly adventurous roles She was among the early actresses to play lead roles in heroine-oriented revenge films, the first of which was Khoon Bhari Maang in 1988 [131] Made by Rakesh Roshan specifically with Rekha in mind, the film featured her in the role Aarti Saxena, a wealthy, unassuming widow who narrowly survives an attempted murder by her scheming second husband and—presumed to be dead—returns to seek revenge under a concealed identity She won her second Filmfare Award for her performance in the film Rekha went on to describe Khoon Bhari Maang as \"the first and only film I concentrated and understood all throughout.\" [132] M.L Dhawan from The Tribune, while documenting the famous Hindi films of 1988, remarked that Khoon Bhari Maang was \"a crowning glory for Rekha, who rose like a phoenix .. and bedazzled the audience with her daredevilry.\" [133] Encyclopædia Britannica's Encyclopædia of Hindi Cinema listed her role in the film as one of Hindi cinema's memorable female characters, noting it for changing \"the perception of the ever-forgiving wife, turning her into an avenging angel.\" [134] In a similar list by Screen magazine, the role was included as one of \"ten memorable roles that made the Hindi film heroine proud.\" [135]\n\n\nCareer fluctuations and short revival (1990–1999)\nThe 1990s saw a drop in Rekha's success Few of her films were successful and many of her roles were condemned by reviewers Critics still noted, however, that unlike most of the actresses of her generation, like Hema Malini and Raakhee, who succumbed to playing character parts, typically of mothers and aunts, Rekha was still playing

State, and now the capital city of Madhya Pradesh He was a Muhajir of Urdu-speaking Pashtun origin [16] [17] [2] [5] [18] His maternal ancestors hailed from the Tirah Valley (now in the Khyber District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan) while from his paternal side he descended from an Uzbek soldier who came to India with Muhammad of Ghor, the 12th century conqueror, the reason why years later he’d name his ballistic missiles as Ghauri [19]\n\n\nCareer in Europe\nIn 1972, Khan joined the Physics Dynamics Research Laboratory (or in Dutch: FDO), an engineering firm subsidiary of Verenigde Machinefabrieken (VMF) based in Amsterdam, from Brabers's recommendation [33] The FDO was a subcontractor for Ultra-Centrifuge Nederland of the, British-German-Dutch uranium enrichment consortium, URENCO which was operating a uranium enrichment plant in Almelo and employed gaseous centrifuge method to assure a supply of nuclear fuel for nuclear power plants in the Netherlands [34] Soon after, Khan left FDO when URENCO offered him a senior technical position, initially conducting studies on uranium metallurgy [35]: 87 \n\n\nScientific career in Pakistan\nUpon learning of India's surprise nuclear test, 'Smiling Buddha', in May 1974, Khan wanted to contribute to efforts to build an atomic bomb and met with officials at the Pakistani Embassy in The Hague, who dissuaded him by saying it was \"hard to find\" a job in PAEC as a \"metallurgist\" [49] In August 1974, Khan wrote a letter which went unnoticed, but he directed another letter through the Pakistani ambassador to the Prime Minister's Secretariat in September 1974 [37]: 140 \n\n\nSmiling Buddha and initiation\nUpon learning of India's surprise nuclear test, 'Smiling Buddha', in May 1974, Khan wanted to contribute

1974, Khan wrote a letter which went unnoticed, but he directed another letter through the Pakistani ambassador to the Prime Minister's Secretariat in September 1974 [37]: 140 \n\n\nKhan Research Laboratories and atomic bomb program\nIn April 1976, Khan joined the atomic bomb program and became part of the enrichment division, initially collaborating with Khalil Qureshi – a physical chemist [53]: 62–63  Calculations performed by him were valuable contributions to centrifuges and a vital link to nuclear weapon research, but continue to push for his ideas for feasibility of weapon-grade uranium even though it had a low priority, with most efforts still aimed to produce military-grade plutonium [50]: 73–74  [53] Because of his interest in uranium metallurgy and his frustration at having been passed over for director of the uranium division (the job was instead given to Bashiruddin Mahmood), Khan refused to engage in further calculations and caused tensions with other researchers [37]: 147–148  Khan became highly unsatisfied and bored with the research led by Mahmood – finally, he submitted a critical report to Bhutto, in which he explained that the \"enrichment program\" was nowhere near success [53]: 62–63 \n\n\nNuclear tests: Chagai-I\nMany of his theorists were unsure that military-grade uranium would be feasible on time without the centrifuges, since Alam had notified PAEC that the \"blueprints were incomplete\" and \"lacked the scientific information needed even for the basic gas-centrifuges.\" [50]: 75–76  [37]: 145–146  Calculations by Tasneem Shah, and confirmed by Alam, showed that Khan's earlier estimation of the quantity of uranium needing enrichment for the production of weapon-grade uranium was possible, even with the small number of centrifuges deployed [50]: 77 \n\n\nProliferation controversy\nIn the 1970s, Khan had been very vocal about establishing a network to acquire imported electronic materials from the Dutch firms and had very little trust of PAEC's domestic manufacturing of materials, despite the government accepting PAEC's arguments for the long term sustainability of the nuclear weapons program [37]: 148  [55] [64] [65] [66] At one point, Khan reached out to the People's Republic of China for acquiring the uranium hexafluoride (UF6) when he attended a conference there – the Pakistani Government sent it back to the People's Republic of China, asking KRL to use the UF6 supplied by PAEC [37]: 150–151  In an investigative report published by Nuclear Threat Initiative, Chinese scientists were reportedly present at Khan Research Laboratories (KRL) in Kahuta in the early 1980s [67] In 1996, the U.S intelligence community maintained that China provided magnetic rings for special suspension bearings mounted at the top of rotating centrifuge cylinders In 2005, it was revealed that President Zia-ul-Haq's military government had KRL run a HEU programme in the Chinese nuclear weapons program [68] Khan said that \"KRL has built a centrifuge facility for China in Hanzhong city\" [68] China also exported some of DF-11's ballistic missile technology to Pakistan, where Pakistan's Ghaznavi and Shaheen-II borrowed from DF-11 technology [69] [70] [71]\n\n\nCourt controversy and U.S. objections\nIn 1979, the Dutch government eventually probed Khan on suspicion of nuclear espionage but he was not prosecuted due to lack of evidence, though it did file a criminal complaint against him in a local court in Amsterdam, which sentenced him in absentia in 1985 to four years in prison [41] [74] Upon learning of the sentence, Khan filed an appeal through his attorney, S M Zafar, who teamed up with the administration of Leuven University, and successfully argued that the technical information requested by Khan was commonly found and taught in undergraduate and doctoral physics at the university – the court exonerated Khan by overturning his sentence on a legal technicality [74]: 35  [56] Reacting to the suspicions of espionage, Khan stressed that: \"I had requested for it as we had no library of our own at KRL, at that time All the research work  [at Kahuta] was the result of our innovation and struggle We did not receive any technical 'know-how' from abroad, but we cannot reject the use of books, magazines, and research papers in this connection.\" [56]\n\n\nNorth Korea, Iran, and

and facilitated the technology transfer to Khan Research Laboratories in 1993 [78]\n\n\nSecurity hearings, pardon, and aftermath\nStarting in 2001, Khan served as an adviser on science and technology

Pakistan Television (PTV) and confessed to running a proliferation ring, and transferring technology to Iran between 1989 and 1991, and to North Korea and Libya between 1991 and 1997 [94] [95] The

testing program and defence strength through nuclear weapons He justified Pakistan's nuclear deterrence program as sparing his country the fate of Iraq or Libya [112] In an interview in 2011, Khan

strap around the shaft, so when they released the javelin, the unwinding of the thong gave the javelin a spiral trajectory [2]\n\n\nRules and competitions\nThe size, shape, minimum weight, and center of gravity of the javelin are all defined by World Athletics rules In international competition, men throw a javelin between 2.6 and 2.7 m (8 ft 6 in and 8 ft 10 in) in length and 800 g (28 oz) in weight, and women throw a javelin between 2.2 and 2.3 m (7 ft 3 in and 7 ft 7 in) in length and 600 g (21 oz) in weight The javelin has a grip, about 150 mm (5.9 in) wide, made of cord and located at the javelin's center of gravity (0.9 to 1.06 m (2 ft 11 in to 3 ft 6 in)) from the javelin tip for the men's javelin and 0.8 to 0.92 m (2 ft 7 in to 3 ft 0 in) from the javelin tip for the women's

javelin design because of the increasingly frequent flat landings and the resulting discussions and protests when these attempts were declared valid or invalid by competition judges The world record had also crept up to a potentially dangerous level, 104.80 m (343.8 ft) by Uwe Hohn With throws exceeding 100 metres, it was becoming difficult to safely stage the competition within the confines of a stadium infield The javelin was redesigned so that the centre of gravity was moved 4 cm (1.6 in) forward In addition, the surface area in front of centre of gravity was reduced, while the surface area behind the centre of gravity was increased This had an effect similar to that produced by the feathers on an arrow The javelin turns into the relative wind This relative wind appears to originate from the ground as the javelin descends, thus the javelin turns to face the ground As the javelin turns into the wind less lift is generated, reducing the flight distance by around 10% but also causing the

throwing area. The javelin throw is one of the oldest and most ancient Olympic sports, with a rich history dating back to the earliest recorded Olympic Games.\n\n**History**\n\nThe javelin throw was added to the Ancient Olympic Games as part of the pentathlon in 708 BC. The pentathlon consisted of five events: running, jumping, wrestling, discus throw, and javelin throw. The javelin throw was included in the pentathlon to test an athlete's strength, speed, and agility. In ancient Greece, the javelin was thrown with the aid of a thong (ankyle in Greek) that was wound around the middle of the shaft. Athletes held the javelin by the ankyle, a leather strap around the shaft, so when they released the javelin, the unwinding of the thong gave the javelin a spiral trajectory.\n\n**Rules and Competitions**\n\nThe size, shape, minimum weight, and center of gravity of the javelin are all defined by World Athletics rules.

{"title": "Georgia_(country)", "content": "\nEtymology\n\n\n\nNames of Georgia\nAncient Greeks (Strabo, Herodotus, Plutarch, Homer, etc.) and Romans (Titus Livius, Tacitus, etc.) referred to early western Georgians as Colchians and eastern Georgians as Iberians (Iberoi, Ἰβηροι in some Greek sources) [22]\n\n\nState name\nThe official name of the country is Georgia per Article 2 of the Georgian Constitution [31] In Georgia's two official languages (Georgian and Abkhaz), the country is named საქართველო (Sakartvelo) and Қырҭтәыла (Kərttʷʼəla) respectively Prior to the adoption of the Constitution in 1995 and following the dissolution of the USSR, the country was commonly [citation needed] called the \"Republic of Georgia\" and occasionally it still is [32]\n\n\nHistory\nThe oldest traces of archaic humans in what is now Georgia date from approximately 1.8 million years ago in the form of the Dmanisi hominins, a subspecies of Homo erectus representing the oldest-known fossils of hominins in Eurasia [38] Buffered by the Caucasus and benefiting from the Black Sea ecosystem, the region seems to have served as a refugium throughout the Pleistocene, [39] while the first continuous primitive settlements date back to the Middle Paleolithic, close to 200,000 years ago [40] During the Upper Paleolithic, settlements developed mostly in Western Georgia, in the valleys of the Rioni and Qvirila rivers [41]\n\n\nPrehistory\nThe oldest traces of archaic humans in what is now Georgia date from approximately 1.8 million years ago in the form of the Dmanisi hominins, a subspecies of Homo erectus representing the oldest-known fossils of hominins in Eurasia [38] Buffered by the Caucasus and benefiting from the Black Sea ecosystem, the region seems to have served as a refugium throughout the Pleistocene, [39] while the first continuous primitive settlements date back to the Middle Paleolithic, close to 200,000 years ago [40] During the Upper Paleolithic, settlements developed mostly in Western Georgia, in the valleys of the Rioni and Qvirila rivers [41]\n\n\nAntiquity\nThe classical period saw the rise of a number of Georgian states, including Colchis in western Georgia, where Greek mythology located the Golden Fleece sought after by the Argonauts Archaeological evidence points to a wealthy kingdom in Colchis as early as the 14th century BC [47] and an extensive trade network with Greek colonies on the eastern Black Sea shore (such as Dioscurias and Phasis), [48] though, the entire region would be annexed first by Pontus and then by the Roman Republic in the first century BC.\n\n\nMedieval unification of Georgia\nIn 580, the Sasanian Empire abolished the Kingdom of Iberia, leading to the disintegration of its constituent territories into various feudal regions by the early Middle Ages The Roman–Persian Wars plunged the region into chaos, with both Persia and Constantinople supporting various warring factions in the Caucasus; however, the Byzantine Empire was able to establish control over Georgian territories by the end of the 6th century, ruling Iberia indirectly through a local Kouropalates [51]\n\n\nGolden Age and Division\nFor much of the 11th century, the nascent Georgian kingdom experienced geopolitical and internal difficulties, with various noble factions opposed to the centralization of the Georgian state They were often backed by the Byzantine Empire, which feared a dominion of the Caucasus region by the Bagrationi dynasty, and in some instances fueled internal conflict through aristocratic families seeking more power However, ties between Byzantium and Georgia were normalized when the two countries faced a new common enemy, the rising Seljuk Empire in the 1060s Following the decisive Byzantine defeat at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, Constantinople started to retreat from eastern Anatolia and entrusted Georgia with its administration, placing Georgia at the forefront of Turkish in the 1080s.\n\n\nTripartite division\nThe Kingdom of Georgia collapsed into anarchy by 1466 and fragmented into three independent kingdoms and five semi-independent principalities Neighboring large empires subsequently exploited the internal division of the weakened country, and beginning in the 16th century, various Ottoman and Iranian forces subjugated western and eastern regions of Georgia, respectively [65] This pushed local Georgian rulers to seek closer ties with Russia In 1649, the Kingdom of Imereti sent ambassadors to the Russian royal court, with Russia returning the favor in 1651 In the presence of these ambassadors, Alexander III of Imereti swore an oath of allegiance to Tsar Alexis of Russia on behalf of Imereti [66] Subsequent rulers also sought assistance from Pope Innocent XII but without success [67]\n\n\nWithin the Russian Empire\nOn 22 December 1800, Tsar Paul I of Russia, at the alleged request of the Georgian King George XII, signed the proclamation on the incorporation of Georgia (Kartli-Kakheti) within the Russian Empire, which was finalized by a decree on 8 January 1801, [73] [74] and confirmed by Tsar Alexander I on 12 September 1801 [75] [76] The Bagrationi royal family was deported from the kingdom The Georgian envoy in Saint Petersburg reacted with a note of protest that was presented to the Russian vice-chancellor, Prince Kurakin [77]\n\n\nDeclaration of independence\nAfter the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic was established with Nikolay Chkheidze acting as its president The federation consisted of three nations: Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan [17] As the Ottomans advanced into the Caucasian territories of the crumbling Russian Empire, Georgia declared independence on 26 May 1918 [83] The Menshevik Social Democratic Party of Georgia won the parliamentary election and its leader, Noe Zhordania, became prime minister Despite the Soviet takeover, Zhordania was recognized as the legitimate head of the Georgian Government by France, UK, Belgium, and Poland through the 1930s [84]\n\n\nSoviet Socialist Republic\nIn February 1921, during the Russian Civil War, the Red Army advanced into Georgia and brought the local Bolsheviks to power The Georgian army was defeated, and the Social Democratic government fled the country On 25 February 1921, the Red Army entered Tbilisi and established a government of workers' and peasants' soviets with Filipp Makharadze as acting head of state Georgia was incorporated into what would soon become the Soviet Union Soviet rule was firmly established only after local insurrections were defeated [86] Georgia would remain an unindustrialized periphery of the USSR until the first five-year plan (1928–1932), when it became a major centre for textile goods.\n\n\nRestoration of independence\nStarting in 1988, mass protests erupted in Georgia in favor of independence, led by Georgian nationalists such as Merab Kostava and Zviad Gamsakhurdia The following year, the brutal suppression by Soviet forces of a large peaceful demonstration held in Tbilisi on 4–9 April 1989 proved to be a pivotal event in discrediting the continuation of Soviet rule over the country [91]\n\n\nRusso-Georgian War\nThere was a Russo-Georgian diplomatic crisis in April 2008 [110] [111] A bomb explosion on 1 August 2008 targeted a car transporting Georgian peacekeepers South Ossetians were responsible for instigating this incident, which marked the opening of hostilities and injured five Georgian servicemen, then several South Ossetian militiamen were killed by snipers [112] [113] South Ossetian separatists began shelling Georgian villages on 1 August These artillery bombardments caused Georgian servicemen to return fire periodically [110] [113] [114] [115] [116]\n\n\nGeorgian Dream government (2012–present)\nIn preparation for the 2012 parliamentary elections, Georgia implemented constitutional reforms to switch to a parliamentary democracy, moving executive powers from the President to the Prime Minister [141] The transition was set to start with the October 2012 parliamentary elections and to be completed with the 2013 presidential elections.\nAgainst the expectations of the ruling United National Movement (UNM) of president Mikheil Saakashvili, a 6-party coalition centred around the newly founded Georgian Dream party won the parliamentary elections in October 2012, bringing an end to nine years of UNM rule and marking the first peaceful electoral transfer of power in Georgia President Saakashvili acknowledged the defeat of his party on the following day [142] Georgian Dream was founded, led and financed by tycoon Bidzina Ivanishvili, the country's richest man, who was subsequently elected by parliament as new Prime Minister [143] Due to the incomplete transition to parliamentary democracy, a year of uneasy cohabitation between Ivanishvili and Saakashvili followed until the presidential election in October 2013, [144] [145] which was won by Giorgi Margvelashvili from the Georgian Dream party [146] With the completed transfer of power, Prime Minister Ivanishvili stepped aside and named one of his close business associates, Irakli Garibashvili, as the next prime minister [147] Ivanishvili has since been called the informal leader of Georgia, arranging political reappointments from behind the scenes [148] Saakashvili left Georgia shortly after the election In 2018, he was convicted in absentia on corruption charges and abuse of power, which he denied [149]\n\n\nGeography\nGeorgia is a mountainous country situated almost entirely in the South Caucasus, while some slivers of the country are situated north of the Caucasus Watershed in the North Caucasus [169] [170] The country lies between latitudes 41° and 44° N, and longitudes 40° and 47° E, with an area of 67,900 km2 (26,216 sq mi) The Likhi Range divides the country into eastern and western halves [171] Historically, the western portion of Georgia was known as Colchis while the eastern plateau was called Iberia [172]\n\n\nTopography\nThe landscape within the nation's boundaries is quite varied Western Georgia's landscape ranges from low-land marsh-forests, swamps, and temperate rainforests to eternal snows and glaciers, while the eastern part of the country even contains a small segment of semi-arid plains [172]\n\n\nClimate\nThe climate of Georgia is extremely diverse, considering the nation's small size There are two main climatic zones, roughly corresponding to the eastern and western parts of the country The Greater Caucasus Mountain Range plays an important role in moderating Georgia's climate and protects the nation from the penetration of colder air masses from the north The Lesser Caucasus Mountains partially protect the region from the influence of dry and hot air masses from the south [174]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nBecause of its high landscape diversity and low latitude, Georgia is home to about 5,601 species of animals, including 648 species of vertebrates (more than 1% of the species found worldwide) and many of these species are endemics [175] A number of large carnivores live in the forests, namely Brown bears, wolves, lynxes and Caucasian Leopards The common pheasant (also known as the Colchian Pheasant) is an endemic bird of Georgia which has been widely introduced throughout the rest of the world as an important game bird The species number of invertebrates is considered to be very high but data is distributed across a high number of publications The spider checklist of Georgia, for example, includes 501 species [176] The Rioni River may contain a breeding population of the critically endangered bastard sturgeon [177]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nGeorgia is a representative democratic parliamentary republic; the President serves as the largely ceremonial head of state, [185] whereas the Prime Minister is head of government Executive power is vested in the Cabinet of Georgia, composed of ministers headed by the Prime Minister and appointed by the Parliament Salome Zurabishvili is the current President of Georgia after winning 59.52% of the vote in the 2018 Georgian presidential election Since February 2024, Irakli Kobakhidze has been the prime minister of Georgia.\n\n\nForeign relations\nThe explicit western orientation of Georgia, deepening political ties with the US and European Union, notably through its EU and NATO membership aspirations, the US Train and Equip military assistance programme, and the construction of the Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline, increasingly strained Tbilisi's relations with Moscow in the early 2000s Georgia's decision to boost its presence in the coalition forces in Iraq was an important initiative [189] The European Union has identified Georgia as a prospective member, [190] and Georgia has sought membership [191]\n\n\nMilitary\nGeorgia's military is organized into land and air forces collectively known as the Georgian Defense Forces (GDF); naval forces were merged into the Coast Guard in 2009, which falls under the Internal Affairs Minister More than 20% of the GDF consists of conscripts [209] The mission and functions of the GDF are based on the Constitution of Georgia, Georgia's Law on Defense and National Military Strategy, and international agreements to which Georgia is signatory [citation needed] As of 2021, Georgia's military budget was 900₾ ($280) million, of which newly two-thirds is allocated for maintaining defence forces readiness and potency development [210] After its independence from the Soviet Union, Georgia began to develop its own military industry, namely through the state owned STC Delta [211] The country produces a range of indigenous military equipment, including armored vehicles, artillery systems, aviation systems, personal protection equipment, and small arms [212]\n\n\nLaw enforcement\nThe Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia is charged with internal law enforcement In recent years, the Patrol Police Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia has undergone a radical transformation, with the police having now absorbed a great many duties previously performed by dedicated independent government agencies New duties performed by the police include border security and customs functions and contracted security provision; the latter function is performed by the dedicated 'security police' [citation needed]\n\n\nCorruption\nPrior to the Rose Revolution, Georgia was among the most corrupt countries in the world [226] However, following the reforms brought by the peaceful revolution, corruption in the country abated dramatically In 2010, Transparency International (TI) named Georgia \"the best corruption-buster in the world.\" [227] In 2012, the World Bank called Georgia a \"unique success\" of the world in fighting corruption, noting \"Georgia's experience shows that the vicious cycle of endemic corruption can be broken and, with appropriate and decisive reforms, can be turned into a virtuous cycle.\" [228]\n\n\nHuman rights and freedom\nHuman rights in Georgia are guaranteed by the country's constitution There is an independent human rights public defender elected by the Parliament of Georgia to ensure such rights are enforced [232] Georgia has ratified the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities in 2005 NGO \"Tolerance\", in its alternative report about its implementation, speaks of a rapid decrease in the number of Azerbaijani schools and cases of appointing headmasters to Azerbaijani schools who do not speak the Azerbaijani language [233]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nGeorgia is administratively divided into 9 regions, 1 capital region, and 2 autonomous republics These in turn are subdivided into 67 districts and 5 self-governing cities [255]\n\n\nEconomy\nArchaeological research demonstrates that Georgia has been involved in commerce with many lands and empires since ancient times, largely due its location on the Black Sea and later on the historical Silk Road Gold, silver, copper and iron have been mined in the Caucasus Mountains Georgian wine making is a very old tradition and a key branch of the country's economy The country has sizeable hydropower resources [263] Throughout Georgia's modern history agriculture and tourism have been principal economic sectors, because of the country's climate and topography.\n\n\nTourism\nTourism is an increasingly significant part of the Georgian economy In 2016, over 2.7 million tourists brought approximately US$2.16 billion to the country [285] In 2019, the number of international arrivals reached a record high of 9.3 million people [286] with foreign exchange income in the year's first three-quarters amounting to over US$3 billion The country plans to host 11 million visitors by 2025 with annual revenues reaching US$6.6 billion [287] According to the government, there are 103 resorts in different climatic zones in Georgia Tourist attractions include more than 2,000 mineral springs, over 12,000 historical and cultural monuments, four of which are recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Sites (Bagrati Cathedral in Kutaisi and Gelati Monastery, historical monuments of Mtskheta, and Upper Svaneti) [288] Other tourist attractions are Cave City, Ananuri Castle/Church, Sighnaghi and Mount Kazbek In 2018, more than 1.4 million tourists from Russia visited Georgia [289]\n\n\nTransport\nToday, transport in Georgia is provided by rail, road, ferry, and air The total length of roads in Georgia, excluding the occupied territories, is 21,110 kilometres (13,120 mi) and railways – 1,576 km (979 mi) [290] Positioned in the Caucasus and on the coast of the Black Sea, Georgia is a key country through which energy imports to the European Union from neighboring Azerbaijan pass [citation needed]\n\n\nDemographics\nLike most native Caucasian peoples, the Georgians do not fit into any of the main ethnic categories of Europe or Asia The Georgian language, the most pervasive of the Kartvelian languages, is not Indo-European, Turkic, or Semitic The present-day Georgian or Kartvelian nation is thought to have resulted from the fusion of indigenous inhabitants with various immigrants who moved into South Caucasus from Anatolia in remote antiquity [300]\n\n\nReligion\nMain religions (2014) [3] [c]\n\n\nEducation\nThe education system of Georgia has undergone sweeping, though controversial, modernization since 2004 [339] [340] Education in Georgia is mandatory for all children aged 6–14 [341] The school system is divided into elementary (six years; ages 6–12), basic (three years; ages 12–15), and secondary (three years; ages 15–18), or alternatively vocational studies (two years) Access to higher education is given to students who have gained a secondary school certificate Only those students who have passed the Unified National Examinations may enroll in a state-accredited higher education institution, based on ranking of the scores received at the exams [342]\n\n\nCulture\nGeorgian culture evolved over thousands of years from its foundations in the Iberian and Colchian civilizations [351] Georgian culture enjoyed a renaissance and golden age of classical literature, arts, philosophy, architecture and science in the 11th century [352] Georgian culture was influenced by Classical Greece, the Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, the various Iranian empires (notably the Achaemenid, Parthian, Sassanian, Safavid, and Qajar empires), [353] [354] [355] [356] and later, since the 19th century, by the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union [357]\n\n\nArchitecture and arts\nGeorgian architecture has been influenced by many civilizations There are several architectural styles for castles, towers, fortifications and churches The Upper Svaneti fortifications, and the castle town of Shatili in Khevsureti, are some of the finest examples of medieval Georgian castle architecture Other architectural features of Georgia include Rustaveli Avenue in Tbilisi and the Old Town District [citation needed]\n\n\nLiterature\nThe Georgian language, and the Classical Georgian literature of the poet Shota Rustaveli, were revived in the 19th century after a long period of turmoil, laying the foundations of the romantics and novelists of the modern era such as Grigol Orbeliani, Nikoloz Baratashvili, Ilia Chavchavadze, Akaki Tsereteli, and Vazha-Pshavela [361] The Georgian language is written in three unique scripts which, according to traditional accounts, were invented by King Pharnavaz I of Iberia in the 3rd century BC [363] [364]\n\n\nMedia\nTelevision, magazines, and newspapers in Georgia are all operated by both state-owned and for-profit corporations which depend on advertising, subscription, and other sales-related revenues The Constitution of Georgia guarantees freedom of speech [citation needed] The media environment of Georgia remains the freest and most diverse in the South Caucasus, [365] despite the long-term politicization and polarisation affecting the sector The political struggle for control over the public broadcaster has left it without a direction in 2014 too [366]\n\n\nMusic\nGeorgia has an ancient musical tradition, which is primarily known for its early development of polyphony Georgian polyphony is based on three vocal parts, a unique tuning system based on perfect fifths, and a harmonic structure rich in parallel fifths and dissonances [citation needed] Three types of polyphony have developed in Georgia: a complex version in Svaneti, a dialogue over a bass background in the Kakheti region, and a three-part partially improvised version in western Georgia [367] The Georgian folk song \"Chakrulo\" was one of 27 musical compositions included on the Voyager Golden Records that were sent into space on Voyager 2 on 20 August 1977 [368]\n\n\nCuisine\nGeorgian cuisine and wine have evolved through the centuries, adapting traditions in each era One of the most unusual traditions of dining is supra, or Georgian table, which is also a way of socializing with friends and family The head of supra is known as tamada He also conducts the highly philosophical toasts, and makes sure that everyone is enjoying themselves Various historical regions of Georgia are known for their particular dishes: for example, khinkali (meat dumplings), from eastern mountainous Georgia, and khachapuri, mainly from Imereti, Samegrelo and Adjara [369]\n\n\nWine\nGeorgia is one of the oldest wine-producing countries in the world Archaeology indicates that fertile valleys and slopes in and around Georgia have been home to grapevine cultivation and neolithic wine production (Georgian: ღვინო, ɣvino) for millennia [370] [371] [372] [373] Local traditions associated with wine are entwined with its national identity [370] In 2013, UNESCO added the ancient traditional Georgian winemaking method using the Kvevri clay jars to the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists [370] [374]\n\n\nSports\nThe most popular sports in Georgia are football, basketball, rugby union, wrestling, judo, and weightlifting Rugby is considered Georgia's national sport [377] Historically, Georgia has been famous for its physical education; the Romans were fascinated with Georgians' physical qualities after seeing the training techniques of ancient Iberia [378] Wrestling remains a historically important sport of Georgia, and some historians think that the Greco-Roman style of wrestling incorporates many Georgian elements [379]\n\n\nSee also\n42°00′N 43°30′E﻿ / ﻿42.000°N 43.500°E﻿ / 42.000;

Georgia, is a country located at the crossroads of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. It has a rich history, diverse culture, and stunning natural beauty. The country is situated in the Caucasus region, bordered by Russia to the north, Turkey and Armenia to the south, Azerbaijan to the east, and the Black Sea to the west.\n\n## Etymology\n\nThe name \"Georgia\" is derived from the Persian word \"gurğ\" or \"kartveli,\" which refers to the ancient kingdom of Kartli. The country has undergone various name changes throughout its history, with the most common names being Kartveli, Kartli, and Iberia.\n\n## Names of Georgia\n\nAncient Greeks and Romans referred to the early western Georgians as Colchians and eastern Georgians as Iberians. The name \"Iberia\" was first used by the ancient Greeks to refer to the region, and it was later adopted by the Romans.\n\n## State name\n\nThe official name of the country is Georgia, as stated in Article 2 of the Georgian Constitution. In Georgia's two official languages, the country is named საქართველო (Sakartvelo) and Қырҭтәыла (Kərttʷʼəla), respectively.\n\n## History\n\nThe oldest traces of archaic humans in what is now Georgia date back to approximately 1.8 million years ago, in the form of the Dmanisi hominins, a subspecies of Homo erectus. The region served as a refugium throughout the Pleistocene, with the first continuous primitive settlements dating back to the Middle Paleolithic, close to 200,000 years ago.\n\n## Prehistory\n\nThe Dmanisi hominins represent the oldest-known fossils of hominins in Eurasia. The region's unique location, buffered by the Caucasus and benefiting from the Black Sea ecosystem, made it an ideal refugium for early human settlements.\n\n## Antiquity\n\nThe classical period saw the rise of a number of Georgian states, including Colchis in western Georgia, where Greek mythology located the Golden Fleece sought after by the Argonauts. Archaeological evidence points to a wealthy kingdom in Colchis as early as the 14th century BC.\n\n## Medieval unification of Georgia\n\nIn 580, the Sasanian Empire abolished the Kingdom of Iberia, leading to the disintegration of its constituent territories into various feudal regions by the early Middle Ages. The Byzantine Empire was able to establish control over Georgian territories by the end of the 6th century.\n\n## Golden Age and Division\n\nFor much of the 11th century, the nascent Georgian kingdom experienced geopolitical and internal difficulties, with various noble factions opposed to the centralization of the Georgian state. The Kingdom of Georgia collapsed into anarchy by 1466 and fragmented into three independent kingdoms and five semi-independent principalities.\n\n## Tripartite division\n\nThe three independent kingdoms were Kartli, Kakheti, and Imereti, while the five semi-independent principalities were Odishi, Guria, Samegrelo, Abkhazia, and Svaneti. The division of the country into three kingdoms and five principalities lasted for over a century.\n\n## Within the Russian Empire\n\nOn 22 December 1800, Tsar Paul I of Russia signed a proclamation on the incorporation of Georgia (Kartli-Kakheti) within the Russian Empire. The incorporation was finalized by a decree on 8 January 1801, and confirmed by Tsar Alexander I on 12 September 1801.\n\n## Declaration of independence\n\nAfter the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic was established with Nikolay Chkheidze acting as its president.

Georgia was incorporated into the Soviet Union, and Soviet rule was firmly established only after local insurrections were defeated.\n\n## Restoration of independence\n\nStarting in 1988, mass protests erupted in Georgia in favor of independence, led by Georgian nationalists such as Merab Kostava and Zviad Gamsakhurdia. The brutal suppression of a large peaceful demonstration in Tbilisi on 4–9 April 1989 proved to be a pivotal event in discrediting the continuation of Soviet rule over the country.\n\n## Russo-Georgian War\n\nIn April 2008, a diplomatic crisis erupted between Georgia and Russia over the status of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. The crisis culminated in a brief war between Georgia and Russia, which resulted in the recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states by Russia.\n\n## Georgian Dream government (2012–present)\n\nIn 2012, a 6-party coalition centered around the Georgian Dream party won the parliamentary elections, marking the first peaceful electoral transfer of power in Georgia.

as Colchians and eastern Georgians as Iberians (Iberoi, Ἰβηροι in some Greek sources) [22]\n\n\nState name\nThe official name of the country is Georgia per Article 2 of the Georgian Constitution [31] In Georgia's two official languages (Georgian and Abkhaz), the country is named საქართველო (Sakartvelo) and Қырҭтәыла (Kərttʷʼəla) respectively Prior to the adoption of the Constitution in 1995 and following the dissolution of the USSR, the country was commonly [citation needed] called the \"Republic of Georgia\" and occasionally it still is [32]\n\n\nHistory\nThe oldest traces of archaic humans in what is now Georgia date from approximately 1.8 million years ago in the form of the Dmanisi hominins, a subspecies of Homo erectus representing the oldest-known fossils of hominins in Eurasia [38] Buffered by the Caucasus and benefiting from the Black Sea ecosystem, the region seems to have served as a refugium throughout the Pleistocene, [39] while the first continuous primitive settlements date back to the Middle Paleolithic, close to 200,000 years ago [40] During the Upper Paleolithic, settlements developed mostly in Western Georgia, in the valleys of the Rioni and Qvirila rivers [41]\n\n\nPrehistory\nThe oldest traces of archaic humans in what is now Georgia date from approximately 1.8 million years ago in the form of the Dmanisi hominins, a subspecies of Homo erectus

mythology located the Golden Fleece sought after by the Argonauts Archaeological evidence points to a wealthy kingdom in Colchis as early as the 14th century BC [47] and an extensive trade network with Greek colonies on the eastern Black Sea shore (such as Dioscurias and Phasis), [48] though, the entire region would be annexed first by Pontus and then by the Roman Republic in the first century BC.\n\n\nMedieval unification of Georgia\nIn 580, the Sasanian Empire abolished the Kingdom of Iberia, leading to the disintegration of its constituent territories into various feudal regions by the early Middle Ages The Roman–Persian Wars plunged the region into chaos, with both Persia and Constantinople supporting various warring factions in the Caucasus; however, the Byzantine Empire was able to establish control over Georgian territories by the end of the 6th century, ruling Iberia indirectly through a local Kouropalates [51]\n\n\nGolden Age and Division\nFor much of the 11th century, the nascent Georgian kingdom experienced geopolitical and internal difficulties, with various noble factions opposed to the centralization of the Georgian state They were often backed by the Byzantine Empire, which feared a dominion of the Caucasus region by the Bagrationi dynasty, and in some instances fueled internal conflict through aristocratic families seeking more power However, ties between Byzantium and Georgia were normalized when the two countries faced a new common enemy, the rising Seljuk Empire in the 1060s Following the decisive Byzantine defeat at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, Constantinople started to retreat from eastern Anatolia and entrusted Georgia with its administration, placing Georgia at the forefront of Turkish in the 1080s.\n\n\nTripartite division\nThe Kingdom of Georgia collapsed into anarchy by 1466 and fragmented into three independent kingdoms and five semi-independent principalities Neighboring large empires subsequently exploited the internal division of the weakened country, and beginning in the 16th century, various Ottoman and Iranian forces subjugated western and eastern regions of Georgia, respectively [65] This pushed local Georgian rulers to seek closer ties with Russia In 1649, the Kingdom of Imereti sent ambassadors to the Russian royal court, with Russia returning the favor in 1651 In the presence of these ambassadors, Alexander III of Imereti swore an oath of allegiance to Tsar Alexis of Russia on behalf of Imereti [66] Subsequent rulers also sought assistance from Pope Innocent XII but without success [67]\n\n\nWithin the Russian Empire\nOn 22 December 1800, Tsar Paul I of Russia, at the alleged request of the Georgian King George XII, signed the proclamation on the incorporation of Georgia (Kartli-Kakheti) within the Russian Empire, which was finalized by a decree on 8 January 1801, [73] [74] and confirmed by Tsar Alexander I on 12 September 1801 [75] [76] The Bagrationi royal family was deported from the kingdom The Georgian envoy in Saint Petersburg reacted with a note of protest that was presented to the Russian vice-chancellor, Prince Kurakin [77]\n\n\nDeclaration of independence\nAfter the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic was established with Nikolay Chkheidze acting as its president The federation consisted of three nations: Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan [17] As the Ottomans advanced into the Caucasian territories of the crumbling Russian Empire, Georgia declared independence on 26 May 1918 [83] The Menshevik Social Democratic Party of Georgia won the parliamentary election and its leader, Noe Zhordania, became prime minister Despite the Soviet takeover, Zhordania was recognized as the legitimate head of the Georgian Government by France, UK, Belgium, and Poland through the 1930s [84]\n\n\nSoviet Socialist Republic\nIn February 1921, during the Russian Civil War, the Red Army advanced into Georgia and brought the local Bolsheviks to power The Georgian army was defeated, and the Social Democratic government fled the country On 25 February 1921, the Red Army entered Tbilisi and established a government of workers' and peasants' soviets with Filipp Makharadze as acting head of state Georgia was incorporated into what would soon become the Soviet Union Soviet rule was firmly established only after local insurrections were defeated [86] Georgia would remain an unindustrialized periphery of the USSR until the first five-year plan (1928–1932), when it became a major centre for textile goods.\n\n\nRestoration of independence\nStarting in 1988, mass protests erupted in Georgia in favor of independence, led by Georgian nationalists such as Merab Kostava and Zviad Gamsakhurdia The following year, the brutal suppression by Soviet forces of a large peaceful demonstration held in Tbilisi on 4–9 April 1989 proved to be a pivotal event in discrediting the continuation of Soviet rule over the country [91]\n\n\nRusso-Georgian War\nThere was a Russo-Georgian diplomatic crisis in April 2008 [110] [111] A bomb explosion on 1 August 2008 targeted a car transporting Georgian peacekeepers South Ossetians were responsible for instigating this incident, which marked the opening of hostilities and injured five Georgian servicemen, then several South Ossetian militiamen were killed by snipers [112] [113] South Ossetian separatists began shelling Georgian villages on 1 August These artillery bombardments caused Georgian servicemen to return fire periodically [110] [113] [114] [115] [116]\n\n\nGeorgian Dream government (2012–present)\nIn preparation for the 2012 parliamentary elections, Georgia implemented constitutional reforms to switch to a parliamentary democracy, moving executive powers from the President to the Prime Minister [141] The transition was set to start with the October 2012 parliamentary elections and to be completed with the 2013 presidential elections.\nAgainst the expectations of the ruling United National Movement (UNM) of president Mikheil Saakashvili, a 6-party coalition centred around the newly founded Georgian Dream party won the parliamentary elections in October 2012, bringing an end to nine years of UNM rule and marking the first peaceful electoral transfer of power in Georgia President Saakashvili acknowledged the defeat of his party on the following day [142] Georgian Dream was founded, led and financed by tycoon Bidzina Ivanishvili, the country's richest man, who was subsequently elected by parliament as new Prime Minister [143] Due to the incomplete transition to parliamentary democracy, a year of uneasy cohabitation between Ivanishvili and Saakashvili followed until the presidential election in October 2013, [144] [145] which was won by Giorgi Margvelashvili from the Georgian Dream party [146] With the completed transfer of power, Prime Minister Ivanishvili stepped aside and named one of his close business associates, Irakli Garibashvili, as the next prime minister [147] Ivanishvili has since been called the informal leader of Georgia, arranging political reappointments from behind the scenes [148] Saakashvili left Georgia shortly after the election In 2018, he was convicted in absentia on corruption charges and abuse of power, which he denied [149]\n\n\nGeography\nGeorgia is a mountainous country situated almost entirely in the South Caucasus, while some slivers of the country are situated north of the Caucasus Watershed in the North Caucasus [169] [170] The country lies between latitudes 41° and 44° N, and longitudes 40° and 47° E, with an area of 67,900 km2 (26,216 sq mi) The Likhi Range divides the country into eastern and western halves [171] Historically, the western portion of Georgia was known as Colchis while the eastern plateau was called Iberia [172]\n\n\nTopography\nThe landscape within the nation's boundaries is quite varied Western Georgia's landscape ranges from low-land marsh-forests, swamps, and temperate rainforests to eternal snows and glaciers, while the eastern part of the country even contains a small segment of semi-arid plains [172]\n\n\nClimate\nThe climate of Georgia is extremely diverse, considering the nation's small size There are two main climatic zones, roughly corresponding to the eastern and western parts of the country The Greater Caucasus Mountain Range plays an important role in moderating Georgia's climate and protects the nation from the penetration of colder air masses from the north The Lesser Caucasus Mountains partially protect the region from the influence of dry and hot air masses from the south [174]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nBecause of its high landscape diversity and low latitude, Georgia is home to about 5,601 species of animals, including 648 species of vertebrates (more than 1% of the species found worldwide) and many of these species are endemics [175] A number of large carnivores live in the forests, namely Brown bears, wolves, lynxes and Caucasian Leopards The common pheasant (also known as the Colchian Pheasant) is an endemic bird of Georgia which has been widely introduced throughout the rest of the world as an important game bird The species number of invertebrates is considered to be very high but data is distributed across a high number of publications The spider checklist of Georgia, for example, includes 501 species [176] The Rioni River may contain a breeding population of the critically endangered bastard sturgeon [177]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nGeorgia is a representative democratic parliamentary republic; the President serves as the largely ceremonial head of state, [185] whereas the Prime Minister is head of government Executive power is vested in the Cabinet of Georgia, composed of ministers headed by the Prime Minister and appointed by the Parliament Salome Zurabishvili is the current President of Georgia after winning 59.52% of the vote in the 2018 Georgian presidential election Since February 2024, Irakli Kobakhidze has been the prime minister of Georgia.\n\n\nForeign relations\nThe explicit western orientation of Georgia, deepening political ties with the US and European Union, notably through its EU and NATO membership aspirations, the US Train and Equip military assistance programme, and the construction of the Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline, increasingly strained Tbilisi's relations with Moscow in the early 2000s Georgia's decision to boost its presence in the coalition forces in Iraq was an important initiative [189] The European Union has identified Georgia as a prospective member, [190] and Georgia has sought membership [191]\n\n\nMilitary\nGeorgia's military is organized into land and air forces collectively known as the Georgian Defense Forces (GDF); naval forces were merged into the Coast Guard in 2009, which falls under the Internal Affairs Minister More than 20% of the GDF consists of conscripts [209] The mission and functions of the GDF are based on the Constitution of Georgia, Georgia's Law on Defense and National Military Strategy, and international agreements to which Georgia is signatory [citation needed] As of 2021, Georgia's military budget was 900₾ ($280) million, of which newly two-thirds is allocated for maintaining defence forces readiness and potency development [210] After its independence from the Soviet Union, Georgia began to develop its own military industry, namely through the state owned STC Delta [211] The country produces a range of indigenous military equipment, including armored vehicles, artillery systems, aviation systems, personal protection equipment, and small arms [212]\n\n\nLaw enforcement\nThe Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia is charged with internal law enforcement In recent years, the Patrol Police Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia has undergone a radical transformation, with the police having now absorbed a great many duties previously performed by dedicated independent government agencies New duties performed by the police include border security and customs functions and contracted security provision; the latter function is performed by the dedicated 'security police' [citation needed]\n\n\nCorruption\nPrior to the Rose Revolution, Georgia was among the most corrupt countries in the world [226] However, following the reforms brought by the peaceful revolution, corruption in the country abated dramatically In 2010, Transparency International (TI) named Georgia \"the best corruption-buster in the world.\" [227] In 2012, the World Bank called Georgia a \"unique success\" of the world in fighting corruption, noting \"Georgia's experience shows that the vicious cycle of endemic corruption can be broken and, with appropriate and decisive reforms, can be turned into a virtuous cycle.\" [228]\n\n\nHuman rights and freedom\nHuman rights in Georgia are guaranteed by the country's constitution There is an independent human rights public defender elected by the Parliament of Georgia to ensure such rights are enforced [232] Georgia has ratified the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities in 2005 NGO \"Tolerance\", in its alternative report about its implementation, speaks of a rapid decrease in the number of Azerbaijani schools and cases of appointing headmasters to Azerbaijani schools who do not speak the Azerbaijani language [233]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nGeorgia is administratively divided into 9 regions, 1 capital region, and 2 autonomous republics These in turn are subdivided into 67 districts and 5 self-governing cities [255]\n\n\nEconomy\nArchaeological research demonstrates that Georgia has been involved in commerce with many lands and empires since ancient times, largely due its location on the Black Sea and later on the historical Silk Road Gold, silver, copper and iron have been mined in the Caucasus Mountains Georgian wine making is a very old tradition and a key branch of the country's economy The country has sizeable hydropower resources [263] Throughout Georgia's modern history agriculture and tourism have been principal economic sectors, because of the country's climate and topography.\n\n\nTourism\nTourism is an increasingly significant part of the Georgian economy In 2016, over 2.7 million tourists brought approximately US$2.16 billion to the country [285] In 2019, the number of international arrivals reached a record high of 9.3 million people [286] with foreign exchange income in the year's first three-quarters amounting to over US$3 billion The country plans to host 11 million visitors by 2025 with annual revenues reaching US$6.6 billion [287] According to the government, there are 103 resorts in different climatic zones in Georgia Tourist attractions include more than 2,000 mineral springs, over 12,000 historical and cultural monuments, four of which are recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Sites (Bagrati Cathedral in Kutaisi and Gelati Monastery, historical monuments of Mtskheta, and Upper Svaneti) [288] Other tourist attractions are Cave City, Ananuri Castle/Church, Sighnaghi and Mount Kazbek In 2018, more than 1.4 million tourists from Russia visited Georgia [289]\n\n\nTransport\nToday, transport in Georgia is provided by rail, road, ferry, and air The total length of roads in Georgia, excluding the occupied territories, is 21,110 kilometres (13,120 mi) and railways – 1,576 km (979 mi) [290] Positioned in the Caucasus and on the coast of the Black Sea, Georgia is a key country through which energy imports to the European Union from neighboring Azerbaijan pass [citation needed]\n\n\nDemographics\nLike most native Caucasian peoples, the Georgians do not fit into any of the main ethnic categories of Europe or Asia The Georgian language, the most pervasive of the Kartvelian languages, is not Indo-European, Turkic, or Semitic The present-day Georgian or Kartvelian nation is thought to have resulted from the fusion of indigenous inhabitants with various immigrants who moved into South Caucasus from Anatolia in remote antiquity [300]\n\n\nReligion\nMain religions (2014) [3] [c]\n\n\nEducation\nThe education system of Georgia has undergone sweeping, though controversial, modernization since 2004 [339] [340] Education in Georgia is mandatory for all children aged 6–14 [341] The school system is divided into elementary (six years; ages 6–12), basic (three years; ages 12–15), and secondary (three years; ages 15–18), or alternatively vocational studies (two years) Access to higher education is given to students who have gained a secondary school certificate Only those students who have passed the Unified National Examinations may enroll in a state-accredited higher education institution, based on ranking of the scores received at the exams [342]\n\n\nCulture\nGeorgian culture evolved over thousands of years from its foundations in the Iberian and Colchian civilizations [351] Georgian culture enjoyed a renaissance and golden age of classical literature, arts, philosophy, architecture and science in the 11th century [352] Georgian culture was influenced by Classical Greece, the Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, the various Iranian empires (notably the Achaemenid, Parthian, Sassanian, Safavid, and Qajar empires), [353] [354] [355] [356] and later, since the 19th century, by the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union [357]\n\n\nArchitecture and arts\nGeorgian architecture has been influenced by many civilizations There are several architectural styles for castles, towers, fortifications and churches The Upper Svaneti fortifications, and the castle town of Shatili in Khevsureti, are some of the finest examples of medieval Georgian castle architecture Other architectural features of Georgia include Rustaveli Avenue in Tbilisi and the Old Town District [citation needed]\n\n\nLiterature\nThe Georgian language, and the Classical Georgian literature of the poet Shota Rustaveli, were revived in the 19th century after a long period of turmoil, laying the foundations of the romantics and novelists of the modern era such as Grigol Orbeliani, Nikoloz Baratashvili, Ilia Chavchavadze, Akaki Tsereteli, and Vazha-Pshavela [361] The Georgian language is written in three unique scripts which, according to traditional accounts, were invented by King Pharnavaz I of Iberia in the 3rd century BC [363] [364]\n\n\nMedia\nTelevision, magazines, and newspapers in Georgia are all operated by both state-owned and for-profit corporations which depend on advertising, subscription, and other sales-related revenues The Constitution of Georgia guarantees freedom of speech [citation needed] The media environment of Georgia remains the freest and most diverse in the South Caucasus, [365] despite the long-term politicization and polarisation affecting the sector The political struggle for control over the public broadcaster has left it without a direction in 2014 too [366]\n\n\nMusic\nGeorgia has an ancient musical tradition, which is primarily known for its early development of polyphony Georgian polyphony is based on three vocal parts, a unique tuning system based on perfect fifths, and a harmonic structure rich in parallel fifths and dissonances [citation needed] Three types of polyphony have developed in Georgia: a complex version in Svaneti, a dialogue over a bass background in the Kakheti region, and a three-part partially improvised version in western Georgia [367] The Georgian folk song \"Chakrulo\" was one of 27 musical compositions included on the Voyager Golden Records that were sent into space on Voyager 2 on 20 August 1977 [368]\n\n\nCuisine\nGeorgian cuisine and wine have evolved through the centuries, adapting traditions in each era One of the most unusual traditions of dining is supra, or Georgian table, which is also a way of socializing with friends and family The head of supra is known as tamada He also conducts the highly philosophical toasts, and makes sure that everyone is enjoying themselves Various historical regions of Georgia are known for their particular dishes: for example, khinkali (meat dumplings), from eastern mountainous Georgia, and khachapuri, mainly from Imereti, Samegrelo and Adjara [369]\n\n\nWine\nGeorgia is one of the oldest wine-producing countries in the world Archaeology indicates that fertile valleys and slopes in and around Georgia have been home to grapevine cultivation and neolithic wine production (Georgian: ღვინო, ɣvino) for millennia [370] [371] [372] [373] Local traditions associated with wine are entwined with its national identity [370] In 2013, UNESCO added the ancient traditional Georgian winemaking method using the Kvevri clay jars to the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists [370] [374]\n\n\nSports\nThe most popular sports in Georgia are football, basketball, rugby union, wrestling, judo, and weightlifting Rugby is considered Georgia's national sport [377] Historically, Georgia has been famous for its physical education; the Romans were fascinated with Georgians' physical qualities after seeing the training techniques of ancient Iberia [378] Wrestling remains a historically important sport of Georgia, and some historians think that the Greco-Roman style of wrestling incorporates many Georgian elements [379]\n\n\nSee also\n42°00′N 43°30′E﻿ / ﻿42.000°N 43.500°E﻿ / 42.000; 43.500\n\n\nNotes\n42°00′N 43°30′E﻿ /

dignified life like a tightly drawn bowstring\", [16] [17]: 1  symbolizing confidence, strength, and straightness [18] Hanyu's father was an advisor to the baseball school club and recommended the sport to his son, but Hanyu eventually decided to pursue a career in figure skating His mother used to make the costumes in his early career, [14] including the free skate costume for the 2010–11 season, which was designed by American figure skater Johnny Weir [18] [19] In 2012, she moved with Hanyu to Toronto, Canada, and accompanied him during training, while his father and older sister,

Russia [35] [38] Hanyu opened the season at the Nebelhorn Trophy, where he won his first gold medal at an international senior competition During the event, he shared his career goals with the media: \"My goals for the future are to land all quad jumps in competition I would also like to learn the quad Axel Another goal is to win the next two Olympics, or at least win medals.\" [21] For the 2011–12 Grand Prix series, he was assigned to the Cup of China, where he placed fourth, and the Rostelecom Cup, which he won with one of the closest margins of 0.03 points ahead of Javier Fernández

first season at his new skating club, Hanyu teamed up with two new choreographers His short program was created by the 2008 World champion, Jeffrey Buttle, to \"Parisienne Walkways\" by Gary Moore, and the free skate was choreographed by Canadian David Wilson to a medley of Riccardo Cocciante's musical Notre-Dame de Paris [35] [38] The coaching change resulted in immediate success; At the 2012 Finlandia Trophy, Hanyu landed his first quadruple Salchow in international competition and won the event [47] [48] In the Grand Prix series, he scored his first two world records in the short program with 95.07 points at the 2012 Skate America, [49] [50] where he finished second behind Takahiko Kozuka, [38] and 95.32 points at the NHK Trophy, which he won ahead of Daisuke Takahashi [49] [51] The placements qualified him for the Grand Prix Final, where he finished second behind Takahashi and beat Patrick Chan for the first time in competition [52] At the Japan Championships, Hanyu won his first national senior title, defeating the reigning and five-time national champion, Daisuke Takahashi, scoring an unofficial record of 285.23 points in the combined total [53] [note 2] However, his win was not well received among spectators and officials, being booed on the podium, but Orser encouraged his student, saying: \"They will come around Just give it some time and they will come your way.\" [46] After the 2013 Four Continents Championships, where he had finished second behind Canadian Kevin Reynolds, Hanyu suffered a knee injury and resumed training two weeks prior to the World Championships An additional ankle sprain in practice forced him to compete on painkillers [54]: 3  Placing ninth after the short program, he fought back with a strong free skate, finishing fourth overall behind Patrick Chan (gold), Denis Ten (silver), and Javier Fernández (bronze), and earning a third spot for Japanese men at the 2014 Winter Olympics [48]\n\n\n2013–14 season: First Olympic and world title\nFor his first Olympic season, Hanyu returned to his short program \"Parisienne Walkways\" and selected Nino Rota's music from Romeo and Juliet for the free skate, choreographed by David Wilson [55] He launched the season with a win at the 2013 Finlandia Trophy and won silver in both of his Grand Prix events, the 2013 Skate Canada and Trophée Éric Bompard, qualifying him for the

becoming the first skater to win the Olympics, Worlds, and the Grand Prix Final in the same season after Russian Alexei Yagudin in 2002–01 [46] [63]\n\n\nSecond Olympic cycle (2014–2018)\nAfter the Sochi Olympics, Hanyu's coaching team was joined by jump expert Ghislain Briand who had coached Canadian skater Elvis Stojko to Olympic silver and two world titles in the 1990s [64] [65] After Stojko's retirement, Briand was convinced that he would \"never have the opportunity to work with another athlete with that much talent, dedication, and passion.\" [65] However, with Hanyu, Briand had eventually found a student who was open towards his unconventional training methods and analysis of figure skating jumps, stating: \"Yuzu is probably the first athlete who really recognizes what I do with him He is the perfect model and he masters his art like no one else It sometimes makes the job easier, but his higher level also comes with many challenges.\" [64]: 1 \n\n\n2014–15 season: Second Grand Prix Final win\nAfter the Sochi Olympics, Hanyu's coaching team was joined by jump expert Ghislain Briand who had coached Canadian skater Elvis Stojko to Olympic silver and two world titles in the 1990s [64] [65] After Stojko's retirement, Briand was convinced that he would \"never have the opportunity to work with another athlete with that much talent, dedication, and passion.\" [65] However, with Hanyu, Briand had eventually found a student who was open towards his unconventional training methods and analysis of figure skating jumps, stating: \"Yuzu is probably the first athlete who really recognizes what I do with him He is the perfect model and he masters his art like no one else It sometimes makes the job easier, but his higher level also comes with many challenges.\" [64]: 1 \n\n\n2015–16 season: Back-to-back world records\nFor the 2015–16 season, Hanyu returned to his short program Ballade No 1 and selected the soundtrack of the films Onmyōji and Onmyōji II by Shigeru Umebayashi for the free skate, portraying the Japanese philosopher and astronomer Abe no Seimei [77] He started the season by winning gold at the 2015 Autumn Classic, finishing 36 points ahead of silver medalist Nam Nguyen [78] However, in his first Grand Prix event at Skate Canada, he placed sixth in the short program after invalidating two jumping passes, finishing second overall behind Patrick Chan [79] [80] Hanyu had been struggling with his short program layout throughout the previous season that included a quad toe loop and a triple Lutz-triple toe loop combination in the second half [80] [81] While his coach Brian Orser suggested a more \"conservative\" change, Hanyu decided to add another quad, stating: \"I thought by the time of the Pyeongchang Olympics, you cannot win without a short program that includes two quads with difficult entries and exits—plus excellent footwork, spins, and presentation As the reigning Olympic champion, I want to be absolutely dominant.\" [81] The offensive strategy earned him a series of back-to-back world records within two weeks: At the 2015 NHK Trophy, he set new highest scores of 106.33 in the short program, 216.07 in the free skate, and 322.40 in the combined total, becoming the first skater to score above 200 and 300 points in the two segments, respectively [82] [83] It was the first free skate performance of Hanyu's competitive career with all-positive grades of execution, featuring three quadruple jumps and two triple Axels [83] [84] At the 2015–16 Grand Prix Final in Barcelona, he broke his own records in all three segments with 110.95 points in the short program, 219.48 in the free skate, and 330.43 overall, becoming the first man to win the Grand Prix Final for three consecutive seasons [82] [84] He finished 37.48 points ahead of Javier Fernández, breaking the record of the largest victory margin at the Grand Prix Final, which was held by Evgeni Plushenko with 35.10 points in 2004 [85] At the Japan Championships, Hanyu won his fourth consecutive national title after placing first in both segments [86] However, a lingering pain in his left foot worsened throughout the season, threatening his participation at the 2016 World Championships in Boston [87] [88] At the event, he managed to skate another clean short program of 110.56 points, but faltered in the free skate, placing second overall behind Fernández [84] [89] It was subsequently announced that Hanyu had been diagnosed with a Lisfranc injury in his left foot, forcing him off ice for two months [87] [88]\n\n\n2016–17 season: Second world title\nIn the 2016–17 season, Hanyu skated to the song \"Let's Go Crazy\" by Prince in the short program and a medley of \"Asian Dream Song\" and \"View of Silence\" by Joe Hisaishi, titled Hope and Legacy, in the free skate [90] He opened the season with a win at the 2016 Autumn Classic, becoming the first skater to successfully land a quadruple loop jump in competition [63] [91] After a rough performance at Skate Canada with a second-place finish behind Patrick Chan, Hanyu and Orser had a debate on the approach for the next competitions While Orser described the performances as a \"skeleton of the  [planned] choreography\" and pleaded to work on the \"total package\", Hanyu was convinced that landing his jumps was the key to a well-rounded program [92] The strategy paid off with a win at the NHK Trophy, surpassing the 300 mark with a total score of 301.47 [93] At the 2016–17 Grand Prix Final in Marseille, Hanyu placed first the short program with a season's best score of 106.53 In the free skate, he made mistakes on three jumping passes, placing third in the segment, but his advantage from the short program was enough to stay in first overall, becoming the first male single skater to win four consecutive Grand Prix Finals [94] After contracting the flu, Hanyu was forced to withdraw from the Japan Championships, missing the event for the first time [91] At the 2017 Four Continents Championships, he placed third in the short program after turning his quad Salchow into a double, [91] a jump that had caused him issues throughout the season [95] He fought back with a strong free skate, placing first in the segment and scoring a new season's best of 303.71 points in the combined total However, he finished second behind American Nathan Chen by about four points, taking the silver medal for a third time [96] At the World Championships, Hanyu moved up from fifth place after the short program to first with a clean free skate performance that featured four quadruple jumps and two triple Axels He scored a new world record of 223.20 points in the segment and won his second world title, finishing ahead of his compatriot Shoma Uno (silver) and Jin Boyang from China (bronze) [97] The event marked the first time that all three medalists scored above 300 points [60] In July 2022, Hanyu named the free skate performance of Hope and Legacy as the one that he thought would represent him best and was the most perfectly executed of his competitive career [98]: 1  At the 2017 World Team Trophy, the final competition of the season, he came in seventh place after an error-filled short program, but placed first in the free skating, [91] becoming the first skater to complete three quadruple jumps in the second half of a skating program He contributed 18 points to the team score and won gold with Team Japan [99]\n\n\n2017–18 season: Second Olympic title\nFor the Olympic season, Hanyu returned to his short program

his first successful quadruple Lutz jump in international competition [100] However, due to mistakes, he finished second at both events behind Javier Fernández and Nathan Chen, respectively [100] [92] In November, Hanyu was scheduled to compete at the NHK Trophy, but injured a lateral ligament in his right ankle after a fall on a quad Lutz in practice and was forced to withdraw from all remaining competitions of the year [92] [101] At the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, he placed first in the short program with a new Olympic record of 111.68 points [60] [102] In the free skating, he missed a jump combination and stumbled on his final triple Lutz, placing second in the segment, but it was enough to stay in first overall ahead of Shoma Uno (silver) and Javier Fernández (bronze), scoring another Olympic record of 317.85 points in the combined total [60] [103] With his win, Hanyu became the first male single skater in 66 years to successfully defend his Olympic title since Dick Button in 1952 [92] [103] Upon the conclusion of the Olympics, Hanyu announced the quadruple Axel as his next career goal, a jump that hadn't been landed in competition until then [104] In order to allow his injured ankle to recover, he decided to withdraw from the World Championships, [105] but remained first in the world standings for a fifth consecutive time at the end of the 2017–18 season [2]\n\n\nThird Olympic cycle (2018–2022)\nFor the 2018–19 season, Hanyu selected his programs with the thought to pay tribute to the skating idols of his childhood His short program to \"Otoñal\" by

and \"Magic Stradivarius\" by Edvin Marton, was a homage to Russian Evgeni Plushenko who had skated to the music in his free skate Tribute to Nijinsky in 2003–04 [90] [106] Regarding his program choices, Hanyu remarked: \"I am satisfied that as a result  [of my Olympic success] I have been released from the pressure that I have to produce results I think and feel that I can skate for myself from now on I want to go back to my skating origins.\" [106]\n\n\n2018–19 season: Records in new judging system\nFor the 2018–19 season, Hanyu selected his programs with the thought to pay tribute to

coronavirus pandemic, Hanyu started to train alone in Sendai with some remote consultation from his coaches Despite the difficulties of training alone, Hanyu found that it had been a good opportunity to learn how to control and analyze himself, [133] which led him not return to Canada until he turned professional and made Ice Rink Sendai his training base again [134] Hanyu also opted to receive remote choreography for his programs ever since and has contributed significantly to the choreography of his programs in the 2020–21 season [135] On August 28, he announced that he would skip the Grand Prix series, citing the risk of COVID-19 for himself, the competition staff, and for his fans who would gather to support him [136] Despite feeling \"conflicted\" over whether he should have competed or not as COVID-19 continued and practicing without his coaching team, Hanyu decided to compete in Japanese championships, which doubled as the final qualifier for the upcoming World Championships in Stockholm [137] [138] He placed first in the short program (103.53 points) and the free skate (215.83 points) with all positive grades of execution on jumping passes and won his fifth

work with another athlete with that much talent, dedication, and passion.\" [65] However, with Hanyu, Briand had eventually found a student who was open towards his unconventional training methods and analysis of figure skating jumps, stating: \"Yuzu is probably the first athlete who really recognizes what I do with him He is the perfect model and he masters his art like no one else It sometimes

jump expert Ghislain Briand who had coached Canadian skater Elvis Stojko to Olympic silver and two world titles in the 1990s [64] [65] After Stojko's retirement, Briand was convinced that he would \"never have the opportunity to work with another athlete with that much talent, dedication, and passion.\" [65] However, with Hanyu, Briand had eventually found a student who was open towards his unconventional training methods and analysis of figure skating jumps, stating: \"Yuzu is probably the first athlete who really recognizes what I do with him He is the perfect model and he masters his art like no one else It sometimes makes the job easier, but his higher level also comes with many challenges.\" [64]: 1 \n\n\n2015–16 season: Back-to-back world records\nFor the 2015–16 season, Hanyu returned to his short program Ballade No 1 and selected the soundtrack of the films Onmyōji and Onmyōji II by Shigeru Umebayashi for the free skate, portraying the Japanese philosopher and astronomer Abe no Seimei [77] He started the season by winning gold at the 2015 Autumn Classic, finishing 36 points ahead of silver medalist Nam Nguyen [78] However, in his first Grand Prix event at Skate Canada, he placed sixth in the short program after invalidating two jumping passes, finishing second overall behind Patrick Chan [79] [80] Hanyu had been struggling with his short program layout throughout the previous season that included a quad toe loop and a triple Lutz-triple toe loop combination in the second half [80] [81] While his coach Brian Orser suggested a more \"conservative\" change, Hanyu decided to add another quad, stating: \"I thought by the time of the Pyeongchang Olympics, you cannot win without a short program that includes two quads with difficult entries and exits—plus excellent footwork, spins, and presentation As the reigning Olympic champion, I want to be absolutely dominant.\" [81] The offensive strategy earned him a series of back-to-back world records within two weeks: At the 2015 NHK Trophy, he set new highest scores of 106.33 in the short program, 216.07 in the free skate, and 322.40 in the combined total, becoming the first skater to score above 200 and 300 points in the two segments, respectively [82] [83] It was the first free skate performance of Hanyu's competitive career with all-positive grades of execution, featuring three

skate, and 330.43 overall, becoming the first man to win the Grand Prix Final for three consecutive seasons [82] [84] He finished 37.48 points ahead of Javier Fernández, breaking the record of the largest victory margin at the Grand Prix Final, which was held by Evgeni Plushenko with 35.10 points in 2004 [85] At the Japan Championships, Hanyu won his fourth consecutive national title after placing first in both segments [86] However, a lingering pain in his left foot worsened throughout the season, threatening his participation at the 2016 World Championships in Boston [87] [88] At the event, he managed to skate another clean short program of 110.56 points, but faltered in the free skate, placing second overall behind Fernández [84] [89] It was subsequently announced that Hanyu had been diagnosed with a Lisfranc injury in his left foot, forcing him off ice for two months [87] [88]\n\n\n2016–17 season: Second world title\nIn the 2016–17 season, Hanyu skated to the song \"Let's Go

the 2016 Autumn Classic, becoming the first skater to successfully land a quadruple loop jump in competition [63] [91] After a rough performance at Skate Canada with a second-place finish behind Patrick Chan, Hanyu and Orser had a debate on the approach for the next competitions While Orser described the performances as a \"skeleton of the  [planned] choreography\" and pleaded to work on the \"total package\", Hanyu was convinced that landing his jumps was the key to a well-rounded program [92] The strategy paid off with a win at the NHK Trophy, surpassing the 300 mark with a total score of 301.47 [93] At the 2016–17 Grand Prix Final in Marseille, Hanyu placed first the short program with a season's best score of 106.53 In the free skate, he made mistakes on three jumping passes, placing third in the segment, but his advantage from the short program was enough to stay in first overall, becoming the first male single skater to win four consecutive Grand Prix Finals [94] After contracting the flu, Hanyu was forced to withdraw from the Japan Championships, missing the event for the first time [91] At the 2017 Four Continents Championships, he placed third in the short program after turning his quad Salchow into a double, [91] a jump that had caused him issues throughout the season [95] He fought back with a strong free skate, placing first in the segment and scoring a new season's best of 303.71 points in the combined total However, he finished second behind American Nathan Chen by about four points, taking the silver medal for a third time [96] At the

record of 223.20 points in the segment and won his second world title, finishing ahead of his compatriot Shoma Uno (silver) and Jin Boyang from China (bronze) [97] The event marked the first time that all three medalists scored above 300 points [60] In July 2022, Hanyu named the free skate performance of Hope and Legacy as the one that he thought would represent him best and was the most perfectly executed of his competitive career [98]: 1  At the 2017 World Team Trophy, the final competition of the season, he came in seventh place after an error-filled short program, but placed first in the free skating, [91] becoming the first skater to complete three quadruple jumps in the second half of a skating program He contributed 18 points to the team score and won gold with Team Japan [99]\n\n\n2017–18 season: Second Olympic title\nFor the Olympic season, Hanyu returned to his short program Ballade No 1 and free skate Seimei from the 2015–16 season [38] At the 2017 CS Autumn Classic, he scored a new world record of 112.72 points in the short program; [50] at the Rostelecom Cup, he landed his first successful quadruple Lutz jump in international competition [100] However, due to mistakes, he finished second at both events behind Javier Fernández and Nathan Chen, respectively [100] [92] In November, Hanyu was scheduled to compete at the NHK Trophy, but injured a lateral ligament in his right ankle after a fall on a quad Lutz in practice and was forced to withdraw from all remaining competitions of the year [92] [101] At the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, he placed first in the short program with a new Olympic record of 111.68 points [60] [102] In the free skating, he missed a jump combination and stumbled on his final triple Lutz, placing second in the segment, but it was enough to stay in first overall ahead of Shoma Uno (silver) and Javier Fernández (bronze), scoring another Olympic record of 317.85 points in the combined total [60] [103] With his win, Hanyu became the first male single skater in 66 years to successfully defend his Olympic title since Dick Button in 1952 [92] [103] Upon the conclusion of the Olympics, Hanyu announced the quadruple Axel as his next career goal, a jump that hadn't been landed in competition until then [104] In order to allow his injured ankle to recover, he decided to withdraw from the World Championships, [105] but remained first in the world standings for a fifth consecutive time at the end of the 2017–18 season [2]\n\n\nThird Olympic cycle (2018–2022)\nFor the 2018–19 season, Hanyu selected his programs with the thought to pay tribute to the skating idols of his childhood His short program to \"Otoñal\" by Raúl Di Blasio was dedicated to American skater Johnny Weir who had used the piece for his free skate in the 2004–05 season Hanyu's new free skate program Origin, a medley of the pieces \"Art on Ice\" and \"Magic Stradivarius\" by Edvin Marton, was a homage to Russian Evgeni Plushenko who had skated to the music in his free skate Tribute to Nijinsky in 2003–04 [90] [106] Regarding his program choices, Hanyu remarked: \"I am satisfied that as a result  [of my Olympic success] I have been released from the pressure that I have to produce results I think and feel that I can skate for myself from now on I want to go back to my skating origins.\"

\"Otoñal\" by Raúl Di Blasio was dedicated to American skater Johnny Weir who had used the piece for his free skate in the 2004–05 season Hanyu's new free skate program Origin, a medley of the pieces \"Art on Ice\" and \"Magic Stradivarius\" by Edvin Marton, was a homage to Russian Evgeni Plushenko who had skated to the music in his free skate Tribute to Nijinsky in 2003–04 [90] [106] Regarding his program choices, Hanyu remarked: \"I am satisfied that as a result  [of my Olympic success] I have been released from the pressure that I have to produce results I think and feel that I can skate

300 and more than 55 points ahead of silver medalist Kevin Aymoz [121] [122] At the Grand Prix Final, Hanyu went into the short program without company due to a delayed arrival of his coach Ghislain Briand In his performance, he missed a mandatory jump combination, placing second in the segment and trailing Nathan Chen by about 13 points [122] In the free skate, Hanyu landed five quadruple jumps in one program for the first time in his career, including his first attempt on a quad Lutz since 2017, but missed a planned triple Axel-triple Axel sequence, finishing second overall behind Chen by more than 43 points [123]\n\n\n2020–21 season: Seventh world medal\nIn 2021, due to travel restrictions related to the coronavirus pandemic, Hanyu started to train alone in Sendai with some remote consultation from his coaches Despite the difficulties of training alone, Hanyu found that it had been a good opportunity to learn how to control and analyze himself, [133] which led him not return to Canada until he turned professional and made Ice Rink Sendai his training base again [134] Hanyu also opted to receive remote choreography for his programs ever since and has contributed significantly to the choreography of his programs in the 2020–21 season [135] On August 28, he announced that he would skip the Grand Prix series, citing the risk of COVID-19 for himself, the competition staff, and for his fans who would gather to support him [136] Despite feeling \"conflicted\" over whether he should have competed or not as COVID-19 continued and practicing without his coaching team, Hanyu

a fall in practice [150] The JSF subsequently announced his withdrawal from the Rostelecom Cup prior to the event, but said that he would remain in consideration for the Olympic team [151] [152]\n\n\nProfessional skating career\nAt a press conference on July 19, 2022, Hanyu announced his decision to \"step away\" from competitive figure skating at amateur level and turn professional, stating that \"he had achieved everything he could achieve\" and would no longer \"seek those kinds of evaluations.\" [160] [161] He also stated his intention to continue pursuing his \"ideal skating\" and dream of completing the quadruple Axel as a professional athlete Nikkei Asia and International Figure Skating noted that Hanyu's exit from the competitive circuit \"marks the end of an era\" [162] [163] Juliet Macur of The New York Times remarked that \"we may never see another skater like Yuzuru Hanyu\" [161] Numerous sports figures from and outside figure skating reacted to Hanyu's announcement with gratitude and praise, including Japanese gymnast Kōhei Uchimura, [164] baseballer Shohei Ohtani, and tennis player Naomi Osaka [165] [166]\n\n\nLaunch of social media and Share Practice\nIn August and September 2022, Hanyu opened accounts on social media, having long eschewed it for years, that are mainly managed by staff [167] He stated his intention to show his skating through his YouTube channel and increase opportunities for everyone to watch it, including those who are unable to attend ice shows [168] On August 10, he live-streamed an open practice session on his channel titled Share Practice where he presented some of his past programs, including three run-throughs and a clean performance of his free skate Seimei with the same elements as used in his layout at the 2018 Winter Olympics The session was open to the press, followed from the rinkside by numerous journalists and photographers, and was watched live on YouTube by more than 100,000 people, having exceeded a total of 3 million views in less than a month [169]\n\n\nYuzuru Hanyu Ice Story solo show series\nIn 2022, Hanyu presented his first ice show as a professional figure skater,

eight different programs performed at the athletic level of skating competitions, including multiple quadruple jumps and triple Axels [172] [173] Prologue was a prelude event to the Yuzuru Hanyu Ice

show Yuzuru Hanyu Notte Stellata, a commemoration event of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, was inaugurated at Sekisui Heim Super Arena in Rifu, which had served as a morgue at the time of the disaster [187] The show is produced by Nippon TV with Hanyu as the chairperson, featuring a cast of international professional skaters as well as a guest artist from a different sport or performing art field The special guests of the first two editions were three-time Olympic gymnastics champion Kohei Uchimura and renowned stage actor Mao Daichi [188] [189]\n\n\nSkating technique and style\nHanyu is regarded by analysts as an accomplished skater known for his high-level technical elements as well as mature and versatile artistry [5] [2] [192] His performance is often characterized as \"the perfect combination of skills, strength and elegance\", [193] [194] [195] tending to \" [blur] rigid gender lines\" [7] According to four-time Olympic medalist Evgeni Plushenko, Hanyu had a \"decided edge over other skaters in the completeness of his performance—spins, skating skills, transitions between jumps and musical interpretation\" [7] Two-time world champion Stephane Lambiel described him as \"the most complete athlete in figure skating, probably ever.\" [7]\n\n\nPublic life\nHanyu has appeared in many commercials and advertising campaigns over the years In 2013, Hanyu,

has appeared in many commercials and advertising campaigns over the years In 2013, Hanyu, alongside fellow Japanese figure skater Daisuke Takahashi, became the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics campaign ambassador for P&G's global \"Proud Sponsor of Moms\" campaign [224] He also signed an affiliation contract with All Nippon Airways which ended when he turned professional in 2022 but he remained

GUM FOR THE GAME [231] [232] [233] [234]\n\n\nPhilanthropy\nSince the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Hanyu has been an advocate for and supporter of various campaigns to help earthquake victims, as he was also directly affected by the disaster, stating: \"When the earthquake hit, I was on the ice at my home rink in Sendai\" [18] Shortly after the disaster, he and other skaters skated in ice shows to raise money for the victims, raising a total of more than US$150,000 He also sold his personal belongings at the show, fundraising an additional ¥2,954,323 ($35,387) [18] And since the disaster, Hanyu has been lending his image to the Great East Japan Earthquake Employment, Education and Health Support Organization to use for posters encouraging donations for the disaster area [252]\n\n\nFilm and television\nHanyu served as a judge on Japan's popular New Year's Eve music show Kōhaku Uta Gassen twice, in 2015 and 2022 [276] [277] He made his on-screen debut as Date Shigemura, a samurai lord, in the 2016 movie, The Magnificent Nine [278] [279] In May 2023, Hanyu guested on a special episode celebrating the 48th-anniversary of the world's longest-running

final part of the series Blue Flames IV were released As of 2023, the series has sold over 400,000 copies [291]\n\n\nAccolades and impact\nMany sport writers, commentators, and skaters have made the case for Hanyu as the greatest skater in history, [11] [7] [9] [4] particularly after his second Olympic victory, for his well-rounded skills, longevity at the top in a highly competitive field, and ability to deliver under pressure [12] [13] [5] [6] [2] His decision to attempt the quadruple Axel at the 2022 Winter Olympics instead of taking a conservative option was seen to have strengthened his status [5] [6]\n\n\nPersonal life and education\nSince Hanyu began carrying a Winnie-the-Pooh tissue box to competitions in 2010, his supporters and fans eventually made it a custom to acknowledge the end of his performances by throwing Pooh bears onto the ice instead of other kinds of stuffed toys or gifts, which has been a tradition in figure skating Hanyu donates the bears to disadvantaged children at local hospitals and charities surrounding the arena that hosted the event [336] [337]\n\n\nWorld records and other achievements\nThroughout his career, Hanyu has broken world records nineteen times – seven times under the current +5/-5 GOE System and twelve times in the former +3/-3 GOE System [note 3] He holds the historical world record in all three competition segments: the short program, free skating, and combined total score [50] [114]\n\n\nPrograms and ice show productions\nSolo ice shows\n\n\nCompetitive highlights\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes and

Her research on the pathophysiology of cancer through the medium of animals led to a further appreciation of causes of diseases such as leukaemia, breast cancer, and Esophageal cancer. Evolution of the leprosy vaccine was a result of her basic research on the bacteria related to leprosy.\n\nRanadive was a great inspiration to Indian women scientists to work on cancer research, in particular on the subject cancer among women and children. One such project was on \"Immunohematology of Tribal Blood\" related to the study of infants.\n\nSpecial Studies\n\nWhen Ranadive was working for Tata Memorial Cancer Hospital in Bombay (which later became Cancer Research Centre) in the department of pathology, she reported on the research studies on the \"Comparative morphology of normal mammary glands of four strains of mice varying in their susceptibility to breast cancer\". In February 1945, she reported on the studies of cancer of the breast that had drawn special attention.

Republican leadership against Republican lawmakers who would participate in a House committee to investigate the Capitol attack [60] [61] After McCarthy rescinded his recommendations, Pelosi announced on July 25 that she had appointed Kinzinger to the committee [71] [72] Kinzinger was one of the ten House Republicans who voted for Trump's second impeachment [73] As a member of the committee investigating the January 6 attack and related issues, Kinzinger oversaw its fifth public hearing on June 23, 2022, serving as the lead questioner of witnesses The hearing featured testimony from former Department of Justice officials describing how Trump tried to enlist them in his fight to overturn the 2020 presidential election [74] Kinzinger also co-led the eighth hearing with Representative Elaine Luria.\n\n\nCensure by Republican National Committee\nOn February 4, 2022, the Republican National Committee called the events of January 6, 2021, a \"legitimate political discourse\" and overwhelmingly voted by voice vote to censure Kinzinger, along with Representative Liz Cheney, for taking part in the House investigation of the Capitol assault [75]\n\n\nFarewell address\nIn his farewell address to Congress on December 15, 2022, Kinzinger warned his colleagues of the influence of conspiracy theories and falsehoods on politics, as well as threats to democracy

Iran, killed [93] Reacting to news of the assassination, Kinzinger tweeted, \"Mess with the bull, get the horns If true, nice call, @realdonaldtrump.\" [94] He continued tweeting, writing, \"killed a man responsible for thousands of deaths in #Syria and elsewhere, including Americans Let's see how long the #blameAmerica left takes to make him a poor victim.\" [95]\n\n\nRussia and Ukraine\nAfter the Russian invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, Kinzinger supported providing aid to Ukraine [96] Until the end of his tenure, he was among the most vocal members of Congress on the topic on social media [97] He is a member of NAFO, an online pro-Ukrainian movement dedicated to countering propaganda and disinformation [98] His support stood in contrast to some Republicans who opposed the aid; when House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy declared the party would not \"write a blank check\" to Ukraine should they retake the House, Kinzinger accused him of \"giving aid and comfort to the enemy, intentionally or unintentionally.\" [97] [99]\n\n\nSocial issues\nKinzinger opposed late-term abortion and the use of federal funds for abortion or health coverage that funds abortion

President Donald Trump about 90% of the time [8] and voted against Trump's first impeachment (though he later admitted to regretting this vote), [8] [124] but he subsequently became one of Trump's biggest critics and made headlines as a rare Republican officeholder willing to criticize him [125] [126] In summer 2020, Kinzinger denounced QAnon and other baseless conspiracy theories that gained currency among Republican voters [8] After the 2020 presidential election, which Trump lost to Joe Biden, Kinzinger denounced Trump's claims that the election was stolen and criticized Trump's attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election [8] In December 2020, after Trump repeated his claims of fraud on Twitter, Kinzinger tweeted that it was time for Trump to delete his Twitter account [8] [127] He also criticized the Texas Republican Party and called for the firing of its chairman, Allen West, when the party floated the idea of secession, after the Supreme Court rejected Texas v Pennsylvania, a bid by the state of Texas to overturn the presidential election outcome [128]\n\n\nCountry First movement\nIn early 2021, a few weeks after the January 6 Capitol attack,

{"title": "Jerusalem", "content": "\nEtymology and names\nThe name \"Jerusalem\" is variously etymologized to mean \"foundation (Semitic yry' 'to found, to lay a cornerstone') of the pagan god Shalem\"; [41] [42] the god Shalem was thus the original tutelary deity of the Bronze Age city [43]\n\n\nEtymology\nThe name \"Jerusalem\" is variously etymologized to mean \"foundation (Semitic yry' 'to found, to lay a cornerstone') of the pagan god Shalem\"; [41] [42] the god Shalem was thus the original tutelary deity of the Bronze Age city [43]\n\n\nAncient Egyptian sources\nThe Execration Texts of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt (c 19th century BCE), which refer to a city called rwšꜣlmm or ꜣwšꜣmm, variously transcribed as Rušalimum, or Urušalimum, [53] [54] may indicate Jerusalem [55] [56] Alternatively, the Amarna letters of Abdi-Heba (1330s BCE), which reference an Úrušalim, may be the earliest mention of the city [57] [58] [59]\n\n\nHebrew Bible and Jewish sources\nThe form Yerushalem or Yerushalayim first appears in the Bible, in the Book of Joshua According to a Midrash, the name is a combination of two names united by God, Yireh (\"the abiding place\", the name given by Abraham to the place where he planned to sacrifice his son) and Shalem (\"Place of Peace\", the name given by high priest Shem) [60]\n\n\nOldest written mention of Jerusalem\nOne of the earliest extra-biblical Hebrew writing of the word Jerusalem is dated to the sixth or seventh century BCE [61] [62] and was discovered in Khirbet Beit Lei near Beit Guvrin in 1961 The inscription states: \"I am Yahweh thy God, I will accept the cities of Judah and I will redeem Jerusalem\", [63] [64] [65] or as other scholars suggest: \"Yahweh is the God of the whole earth The mountains of Judah belong to him, to the God of Jerusalem\" [66] [67] An earlier example of the name appears in a papyrus from the 7th century BCE [68] [69]\n\n\nJebus, Zion, City of David\nAn ancient settlement of Jerusalem, founded as early as the Bronze Age on the hill above the Gihon Spring, was, according to the Bible, named Jebus [70] [71] [72] Called the \"Fortress of Zion\" (metsudat Zion), it was renamed as the \"City of David\", [73] and was known by this name in antiquity [74] [75] Another name, \"Zion\", initially referred to a distinct part of the city, but later came to signify the city as a whole, and afterwards to represent the whole biblical Land of Israel.\n\n\nGreek, Roman and Byzantine names\nIn Greek and Latin, the city's name was transliterated Hierosolyma/Hierosoluma (Greek: Ἱεροσόλυμα; in Greek hieròs, ἱερός, means holy), and was the term used by Matthew and Mark in their gospels instead of the Hebrew term [76]\n\n\nSalem\nThe Aramaic Apocryphon of Genesis of the Dead Sea Scrolls (1QapGen 22:13) equates Jerusalem with the earlier \"Salem\" (שלם), said to be the kingdom of Melchizedek in Genesis 14 [77] Other early Hebrew sources, [78] early Christian renderings of the verse [79] and targumim, [80] however, put Salem in Northern Israel near Shechem (Sichem), now Nablus, a city of some importance in early sacred Hebrew writing [81] Possibly the redactor of the Apocryphon of Genesis wanted to dissociate Melchizedek from the area of Shechem, which at the time was in possession of the Samaritans [82] However that may be, later Rabbinic sources also equate Salem with Jerusalem, mainly to link Melchizedek to later Temple traditions [83]\n\n\nArabic names\nOriginally titled Bayt al-Maqdis, today, Jerusalem is most commonly known in Arabic as القُدس, transliterated as al-Quds and meaning \"the holy\" or \"the holy sanctuary\", [47] [48] cognate with Hebrew: הקדש, romanized: ha-qodesh The name is possibly a shortened form of مدينة القُدس Madīnat al-Quds \"city of the holy sanctuary\" after the Hebrew nickname with the same meaning, Ir ha-Qodesh (עיר הקדש) The ق (Q) is pronounced either with a voiceless uvular plosive (/q/), as in Classical Arabic, or with a glottal stop (ʔ) as in Levantine Arabic [7] Official Israeli government policy mandates that أُورُشَلِيمَ, transliterated as Ūrušalīm, which is the name frequently used in Christian translations of the Bible into Arabic, [84] [85] be used as the Arabic language name for the city in conjunction with القُدس, giving أُورُشَلِيمَ-القُدس, Ūrušalīm-al-Quds [86] Palestinian Arab families who hail from this city are often called \"Qudsi\" (قُدسي) or \"Maqdasi\" (مقدسي), while Palestinian Muslim Jerusalemites may use these terms as a demonym [87]\n\n\nHistory\nJerusalem is one of the world's oldest cities, with a history spanning over 5,000 years Its origins trace back to around 3000 BCE, with the first settlement near the Gihon Spring The city is first mentioned in Egyptian Execration texts around 2000 BCE as \"Rusalimum.\" By the 17th century BCE, Jerusalem had developed into a fortified city under Canaanite rule, with massive walls protecting its water system During the Late Bronze Age, Jerusalem became a vassal of Ancient Egypt, as documented in the Amarna letters.\n\n\nPolitical status\nFrom 1923 until 1948, Jerusalem served as the administrative capital of Mandatory Palestine [88]\n\n\nInternational status\nWhile the international community regards East Jerusalem, including the entire Old City, as part of the occupied Palestinian territories, neither part, West or East Jerusalem, is recognized as part of the territory of Israel or the State of Palestine [96] [97] [98] [99] Under the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1947, Jerusalem was envisaged to become a corpus separatum administered by the United Nations In the war of 1948, the western part of the city was occupied by forces of the nascent state of Israel, while the eastern part was occupied by Jordan The international community largely considers the legal status of Jerusalem to derive from the partition plan, and correspondingly refuses to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the city [100]\n\n\nStatus under Israeli rule\nFollowing the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel extended its jurisdiction and administration over East Jerusalem, establishing new municipal borders.\n\n\nJerusalem as capital of Israel\nOn 5 December 1949, Israel's first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, proclaimed Jerusalem as Israel's \"eternal\" and \"sacred\" capital, and eight days later specified that only the war had \"compelled\" the Israeli leadership \"to establish the seat of Government in Tel Aviv\", while \"for the State of Israel there has always been and always will be one capital only – Jerusalem the Eternal\", and that after the war, efforts had been ongoing for creating the conditions for \"the Knesset.. returning to Jerusalem.\" [110] This indeed took place, and since the beginning of 1950 all branches of the Israeli government—legislative, judicial, and executive—have resided there, except for the Ministry of Defense, which is located at HaKirya in Tel Aviv [111] [112] At the time of Ben Gurion's proclamations and the ensuing Knesset vote of 24 January 1950, [112] Jerusalem was divided between Israel and Jordan, and thus the proclamation only applied to West Jerusalem.\n\n\nGovernment precinct and national institutions\nThe Kiryat HaLeom (national precinct) project is intended to house most government agencies and national cultural institutions They are located in the Kiryat HaMemshala (government complex) in the Givat Ram neighbourhood Some government buildings are located in Kiryat Menachem Begin The city is home to the Knesset, [138] the Supreme Court, [139] the Bank of Israel, the National Headquarters of the Israel Police, the official residences of the President and Prime Minister, the Cabinet, and all ministries except for the Ministry of Defense (which is located in central Tel Aviv's HaKirya district) and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (which is located in Rishon LeZion, in the wider Tel Aviv metropolitan area, near Beit Dagan).\n\n\nIsraeli settlements\nSince its capture in 1967, the Israeli government has built 12 Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem, with a population amounting to 220,000 Israeli Jewish settlers as of 2019 [140] The international community consider Israeli settlements to be illegal under international law [141]\n\n\nJerusalem as capital of Palestine\nThe Palestinian National Authority views East Jerusalem as occupied territory according to United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 The Palestinian Authority claims Jerusalem, including the Haram al-Sharif, as the capital of the State of Palestine, [105] The PLO claims that West Jerusalem is also subject to permanent status negotiations However, it has stated that it would be willing to consider alternative solutions, such as making Jerusalem an open city [142]\n\n\nPalestinian offices and institutions\nGovernment offices are located outside the Israeli municipal limits include the Palestinian Security Services, Force 17, the Preventative Security Service and the Ministry of Interior [147] [148] [149] There is a Palestinian Authority regional office and an electoral office located in the Dahiyat al Barid neighborhood [150]\n\n\nMunicipal administration\nThe Jerusalem City Council is a body of 31 elected members headed by the mayor, who serves a five-year term and appoints eight deputies The former mayor of Jerusalem, Uri Lupolianski, was elected in 2003 [151] In the November 2008 city elections, Nir Barkat was elected In November 2018, Moshe Lion was elected mayor [152]\n\n\nGeography\nJerusalem is situated on the southern spur of a plateau in the Judaean Mountains, which include the Mount of Olives (East) and Mount Scopus (North East) The elevation of the Old City is approximately 760 m (2,490 ft) [161] The whole of Jerusalem is surrounded by valleys and dry riverbeds (wadis) The Kidron, Hinnom, and Tyropoeon Valleys intersect in an area just south of the Old City of Jerusalem [162] The Kidron Valley runs to the east of the Old City and separates the Mount of Olives from the city proper Along the southern side of old Jerusalem is the Valley of Hinnom, a steep ravine associated in biblical eschatology with the concept of Gehenna or Hell [163]\n\n\nClimate\nThe city is characterized by a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csa), with hot, dry summers, and mild, wet winters Snow flurries usually occur once or twice a winter, although the city experiences heavy snowfall every three to four years, on average, with short-lived accumulation.\n\n\nDemographics\nJerusalem's population size and composition has shifted many times over its 5,000-year history Since the 19th century, the Old City of Jerusalem has been divided into Jewish, Muslim, Christian, and Armenian quarters Matthew Teller writes that this convention may have originated in the 1841 British Royal Engineers map of Jerusalem, [13] or at least Reverend George Williams' subsequent labelling of it [179]\n\n\nDemographic history\nJerusalem's population size and composition has shifted many times over its 5,000-year history Since the 19th century, the Old City of Jerusalem has been divided into Jewish, Muslim, Christian, and Armenian quarters Matthew Teller writes that this convention may have originated in the 1841 British Royal Engineers map of Jerusalem, [13] or at least Reverend George Williams' subsequent labelling of it [179]\n\n\nCurrent demographics\nIn December 2007, Jerusalem had a population of 747,600—63.7% were Jewish, 33.1% Muslim, and 2% Christian [182]\n\n\nUrban planning issues\nCritics of efforts to promote a Jewish majority in Jerusalem say that government planning policies are motivated by demographic considerations and seek to limit Arab construction while promoting Jewish construction [197] According to a World Bank report, the number of recorded building violations between 1996 and 2000 was four and half times higher in Jewish neighbourhoods but four times fewer demolition orders were issued in West Jerusalem than in East Jerusalem; Arabs in Jerusalem were less likely to receive construction permits than Jews, and \"the authorities are much more likely to take action against Palestinian violators\" than Jewish violators of the permit process [198] In recent years, private Jewish foundations have received permission from the government to develop projects on disputed lands, such as the City of David archaeological site in the 60% Arab neighbourhood of Silwan (adjacent to the Old City), [199] and the Museum of Tolerance on Mamilla Cemetery (adjacent to Zion Square) [198] [200]\n\n\nReligious significance\nJerusalem has been sacred to Judaism for roughly 3000 years, to Christianity for around 2000 years, and to Islam for approximately 1400 years The 2000 Statistical Yearbook of Jerusalem lists 1204 synagogues, 158 churches, and 73 mosques within the city [201] Despite efforts to maintain peaceful religious coexistence, some sites, such as the Temple Mount, have been a continuous source of friction and controversy The Temple Mount is the holiest spot in Judaism and the third holiest site in Islam Jews venerate it as the site of the two former Temples and Muslims believe that Muhammad was transported from the Great Mosque of Mecca to this location during the Night Journey.\n\n\nJudaism\nJerusalem has been the holiest city in Judaism and the ancestral and spiritual homeland of the Jewish people since King David proclaimed it his capital in the 10th century BCE [note 5] [21] Without counting its other names, Jerusalem appears in the Hebrew Bible 669 times [202] The first section, the Torah (Pentateuch), only mentions Moriah, but in later parts of the Bible, the city is mentioned explicitly [203] The Temple Mount, which was the site of Solomon's Temple and the Second Temple, is the holiest site in Judaism and the place Jews turn towards during prayer [204] [205] The Western Wall, a remnant of the wall surrounding the Second Temple, is the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray [206] Synagogues around the world are traditionally built with the Holy Ark facing Jerusalem, [207] and Arks within Jerusalem face the Holy of Holies [208] As prescribed in the Mishna and codified in the Shulchan Aruch, daily prayers are recited while facing towards Jerusalem and the Temple Mount Many Jews have \"Mizrach\" plaques hung on a wall of their homes to indicate the direction of prayer [208] [209] The Western Wall is a remnant of the Second Temple and the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray.\n\n\nChristianity\nJerusalem is generally considered the cradle of Christianity [210] Christianity reveres Jerusalem for its Old Testament history, and also for its significance in the life of Jesus According to the New Testament, Jesus was brought to Jerusalem soon after his birth [211] and later in his life cleansed the Second Temple [212] The Cenacle, believed to be the site of Jesus' Last Supper, is located on Mount Zion in the same building that houses the Tomb of King David [213] [214] Another prominent Christian site in Jerusalem is Golgotha, the site of the crucifixion The Gospel of John describes it as being located outside Jerusalem, [215] but recent archaeological evidence suggests Golgotha is a short distance from the Old City walls, within the present-day confines of the city [216] The land occupied by the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is considered one of the top candidates for Golgotha and thus has been a Christian pilgrimage site for the past 2000 years [216] [217] [218] The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is generally considered the most important church in Christendom [219] It contains the two holiest sites in Christianity: the site where Jesus was crucified, and Jesus's empty tomb, where he is believed by Christians to have been buried and resurrected.\n\n\nIslam\nJerusalem is the third-holiest city in Sunni Islam [28] Islamic tradition holds that for approximately a year, before it was permanently switched to the Kaaba in Mecca, the qibla (direction of prayer) for Muslims was Jerusalem [220] [221] The city's lasting place in Islam, however, is primarily due to Muhammad's Night Journey (c. 620 CE) Muslims believe that Muhammad was miraculously transported one night from the Great Mosque of Mecca to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, whereupon he ascended to Heaven to meet previous prophets of Islam [222] [223] [224] The first verse in the Qur'an's Surat al-Isra notes the destination of Muhammad's journey as al-masjid al-aqṣā (\"the farthest place of prayer\") [225] [226] In the earliest days of Islam, this was understood as a reference to a site in the heavens, [227] however, Post-Rashidun Islamic scholars understood it as relating to Jerusalem, and particularly to the site of the former Jewish Temple [228] The hadith, a collection of the sayings of Muhammad, mentions that the location of the Al-Aqsa Mosque is in Jerusalem [229] The Al-Aqsa Mosque, originally named after the wider compound it sits within, [230] was built on the Temple Mount under the Umayyad Caliph Al-Walid several decades after Muhammad's death to commemorate the place from which Muslims believe he had ascended to Heaven [231]\n\n\nEconomy\nHistorically, Jerusalem's economy was supported almost exclusively by religious pilgrims, as it was far from the major ports of Jaffa and Gaza [232] Jerusalem's religious and cultural landmarks today remain the top draw for foreign visitors, with the majority of tourists visiting the Western Wall and the Old City [185] In 2010, Jerusalem was named the top leisure travel city in Africa and the Middle East by Travel + Leisure magazine [233]\nin 2013, 75% of the 3.5 million tourists to Israel visited Jerusalem [234]\n\n\nUrban structure\nJerusalem has traditionally had a low-rise skyline About 18 tall buildings were built at different times in the downtown area when there was no clear policy over the matter One of them, Holyland Tower 1, Jerusalem's tallest building, is a skyscraper by international standards, rising 32 stories Holyland Tower 2, which has been approved for construction, will reach the same height [254] [255]\n\n\nHigh-rise

Holyland Tower 1, Jerusalem's tallest building, is a skyscraper by international standards, rising 32 stories Holyland Tower 2, which has been approved for construction, will reach the same height [254] [255]\n\n\nNew projects in Jerusalem\nIn 2021, Bashar Masri announced and launched \"Lana\", a massive mix-used project in East Jerusalem, which is located in the neighborhood of Beit Hanina The project is in a partnership between Massar International and the Orthodox Church of Jerusalem It features 400 residential apartments along with a vibrant commercial center that hosts well-known global brands, cinemas, restaurants, cafes, and offices The project also includes modern educational facilities, such as a school and a kindergarten, catering to the needs of residents In addition to its focus on residential and commercial aspects, the Lana project emphasizes the improvement of infrastructure within the project and its surroundings This involves the construction of three to four floors of underground parking to accommodate the residents' vehicles conveniently Furthermore, there is a comprehensive plan to expand the road network surrounding the project, ensuring smooth transportation and accessibility for both residents and visitors It is situated just 15 minutes away from the historic Old City of Jerusalem [262]\n\n\nTransportation\nJerusalem is served by highly developed communication infrastructures, making it a leading logistics hub for Israel.\n\n\nPublic transport\nJerusalem is served by highly developed communication infrastructures, making it a leading logistics hub for Israel.\n\n\nRailway\nThe Jerusalem Light Rail initiated service in August 2011 According to plans, the first rail line will be capable of transporting an estimated 200,000 people daily, and has 23 stops The route is from Pisgat Ze'ev in the north via the Old City and city centre to Mt Herzl in the south.\n\n\nAirport\nIn the past, Jerusalem was also served by the local Jerusalem International Airport, locally known as Atarot Airport It was the first airport built in the British Mandate of Palestine Palestinians considered the Atarot Airport as a \"symbol of Palestinian sovereignty\" [271] The airport falls beyond Green Line After 1948 war, it came under control of Jordan Following the Six Day War of 1967, the airport came under control of Israel [272] With increase of violence in the second intifada, Atarot Airport ceased operation in 2000 Today Jerusalem is served by Ben Gurion Airport, some 50 km (30 mi) northwest of the Jerusalem, on the route to Tel Aviv The Tel Aviv–Jerusalem railway runs non-stop from Jerusalem–Yitzhak Navon railway station to the airport and began operation in 2018 [273]\n\n\nEducation\nJerusalem is home to several prestigious universities offering courses in Hebrew, Arabic and English.\n\n\nUniversities\nJerusalem is home to several prestigious universities offering courses in Hebrew, Arabic and English.\n\n\nArab schools\nIsrael's public schools for Arabs in Jerusalem and other parts of the country have been criticized for offering a lower quality education than those catering to Israeli Jewish students [296] While many schools in the heavily Arab East Jerusalem are filled to capacity and there have been complaints of overcrowding, the Jerusalem Municipality is building over a dozen new schools in the city's Arab neighbourhoods [297] Schools in Ras el-Amud and Umm Lison opened in 2008 [298] In March 2007, the Israeli government approved a five-year plan to build 8,000 new classrooms in the city, 40 percent in the Arab sector and 28 percent in the Haredi sector A budget of 4.6 billion shekels was allocated for this project [299] In 2008, Jewish British philanthropists donated $3 million for the construction of schools for Arabs in East Jerusalem [298] Arab high school students take the Bagrut matriculation exams, so that much of their curriculum parallels that of other Israeli high schools and includes certain Jewish subjects [296]\n\n\nCulture\nAlthough Jerusalem is known primarily for its religious significance, the city is also home to many artistic and cultural venues The Israel Museum attracts nearly one million visitors a year, approximately one-third of them tourists [300] The 8 ha (20-acre) museum complex comprises several buildings featuring special exhibits and extensive collections of Judaica, archaeological findings, and Israeli and European art The Dead Sea scrolls, discovered in the mid-20th century in the Qumran Caves near the Dead Sea, are housed in the Museum's Shrine of the Book [301] The Youth Wing, which mounts changing exhibits and runs an extensive art education programme, is visited by 100,000 children a year The museum has a large outdoor sculpture garden and includes the Holyland Model of Jerusalem, a scale-model of the city during the late Second Temple period [300] The Ticho House in downtown Jerusalem houses the paintings of Anna Ticho and the Judaica collections of her husband, an ophthalmologist who opened Jerusalem's first eye clinic in this building in 1912 [302]\n\n\nMedia\nThe headquarters of the Israel Broadcasting Authority and its successor Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation are located in Jerusalem, as well as television and radio studios for Channel 12, Channel 13, and part of the radio studios of BBC News The Jerusalem Post and The Times of Israel are also headquartered in Jerusalem Local newspapers include the Israeli Kol Ha'ir and the Palestinian Jerusalem Times God TV, an international Christian television network, is also based in the city PYALARA, an organisation based in Jerusalem, transformed Jaba into a digital hub, which is the Middle East's first digital village and is also home to first Media Interactive Learning Center in the Middle East [336]\n\n\nSports\nThe two most popular sports are football (soccer) and basketball [337] Beitar Jerusalem Football Club is one of the most well known in Israel Fans include political figures who often attend its games [338] Jerusalem's other major football team, and one of Beitar's top rivals, is Hapoel Jerusalem F.C Whereas Beitar has been Israel State Cup champion seven times, [339] Hapoel has won the Cup only once Beitar has won the top league six times, while Hapoel has never succeeded Beitar plays in the more prestigious Ligat HaAl, while Hapoel is in the second division Liga Leumit Since its opening in 1992, Teddy Stadium has been Jerusalem's primary football stadium, with a capacity of 31,733

It has been considered a sacred city for Jews, Christians, and Muslims for thousands of years, with a history dating back over 5,000 years.\n\n**Etymology and Names**\n\nThe name \"Jerusalem\" is variously etymologized to mean \"foundation (Semitic yry' 'to found, to lay a cornerstone') of the pagan god Shalem\"; the god Shalem was thus the original tutelary deity of the Bronze Age city. The name \"Jerusalem\" is derived from the Hebrew word \"Yerushalayim\", which is a combination of two words: \"Yireh\" (meaning \"the abiding place\") and \"Shalem\" (meaning \"Place of Peace\").\n\n**Ancient Egyptian Sources**\n\nThe Execration Texts of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt (c 19th century BCE), which refer to a city called rwšꜣlmm or ꜣwšꜣmm, variously transcribed as Rušalimum, or Urušalimum, may indicate Jerusalem. Alternatively, the Amarna letters of Abdi-Heba (1330s BCE), which reference an Úrušalim, may be the earliest mention of the city.\n\n**Hebrew Bible and Jewish Sources**\n\nThe form Yerushalem or Yerushalayim first appears in the Bible, in the Book of Joshua. According to a Midrash, the name is a combination of two names united by God, Yireh (\"the abiding place\", the name given by Abraham to the place where he planned to sacrifice his son) and Shalem (\"Place of Peace\", the name given by high priest Shem).\n\n**Oldest Written Mention of Jerusalem**\n\nOne of the earliest extra-biblical Hebrew writing of the word Jerusalem is dated to the sixth or seventh century BCE and was discovered in Khirbet Beit Lei near Beit Guvrin in 1961. The inscription states: \"I am Yahweh thy God, I will accept the cities of Judah and I will redeem Jerusalem\".\n\n**Jebus, Zion, City of David**\n\nAn ancient settlement of Jerusalem, founded as early as the Bronze Age on the hill above the Gihon Spring, was, according to the Bible, named Jebus. Called the \"Fortress of Zion\" (metsudat Zion), it was renamed as the \"City of David\", and was known by this name in antiquity.\n\n**Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Names**\n\nIn Greek and Latin, the city's name was transliterated Hierosolyma/Hierosoluma (Greek: Ἱεροσόλυμα; in Greek hieròs, ἱερός, means holy), and was the term used by Matthew and Mark in their gospels instead of the Hebrew term.\n\n**Salem**\n\nThe Aramaic Apocryphon of Genesis of the Dead Sea Scrolls (1QapGen 22:13) equates Jerusalem with the earlier \"Salem\" (שלם), said to be the kingdom of Melchizedek in Genesis 14. Other early Hebrew sources, early Christian renderings of the verse, and targumim, however, put Salem in Northern Israel near Shechem (Sichem), now Nablus, a city of some importance in early sacred Hebrew writing.\n\n**Arabic Names**\n\nOriginally titled Bayt al-Maqdis, today, Jerusalem is most commonly known in Arabic as القُدس, transliterated as al-Quds and meaning \"the holy\" or \"the holy sanctuary\". The name is possibly a shortened form of مدينة القُدس Madīnat al-Quds \"city of the holy sanctuary\" after the Hebrew nickname with the same meaning, Ir ha-Qodesh (עיר הקדש).\n\n**History**\n\nJerusalem is one of the world's oldest cities, with a history spanning over 5,000 years. Its origins trace back to around 3000 BCE, with the first settlement near the Gihon Spring. By the 17th century BCE, Jerusalem had developed into a fortified city under Canaanite rule, with massive walls protecting its water system.\n\n**Political Status**\n\nFrom 1923 until 1948, Jerusalem served as the administrative capital of Mandatory Palestine. While the international community regards East Jerusalem, including the entire Old City, as part of the occupied Palestinian territories, neither part, West or East Jerusalem, is recognized as part of the territory of Israel or the State of Palestine.\n\n**Status Under Israeli Rule**\n\nFollowing the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel extended its jurisdiction and administration over East Jerusalem, establishing new municipal borders. The Israeli government has built 12 Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem, with a population amounting to 220,000 Israeli Jewish settlers as of 2019.\n\n**Jerusalem as Capital of Israel**\n\nOn 5 December 1949, Israel's first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, proclaimed Jerusalem as Israel's \"eternal\" and \"sacred\" capital, and eight days later specified that only the war had \"compelled\" the Israeli leadership \"to establish the seat of Government in Tel Aviv\", while \"for the State of Israel there has always been and always will be one capital only – Jerusalem the Eternal\".\n\n**Government Precinct and National Institutions**\n\nThe Kiryat HaLeom (national precinct) project is intended to house most government agencies and national cultural institutions. They are located in the Kiryat HaMemshala (government complex) in the Givat Ram neighbourhood.\n\n**Israeli Settlements**\n\nSince its capture in 1967, the Israeli government has built 12 Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem, with a population amounting to 220,000 Israeli Jewish settlers as of 2019.\n\n**Palestinian Offices and Institutions**\n\nGovernment offices are located outside the Israeli municipal limits include the Palestinian Security Services, Force 17, the Preventative Security Service and the Ministry of Interior.\n\n**Municipal Administration**\n\nThe Jerusalem City Council is a body of 31 elected members headed by the mayor, who serves a five-year term and appoints eight deputies.\n\n**Geography**\n\nJerusalem is situated on the southern spur of a plateau in the Judaean Mountains, which include the Mount of Olives (East) and Mount Scopus (North East). The elevation of the Old City is approximately 760 m (2,490 ft).\n\n**Climate**\n\nThe city is characterized by a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csa), with hot, dry summers, and mild, wet winters. Snow flurries usually occur once or twice a winter, although the city experiences heavy snowfall every three to four years, on average, with short-lived accumulation.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nJerusalem's population size and composition has shifted many times over its 5,000-year history. Since the 19th century, the Old City of Jerusalem has been divided into Jewish, Muslim, Christian, and Armenian quarters.\n\n**Urban Planning Issues**\n\nCritics of efforts to promote a Jewish majority in Jerusalem say that government planning policies are motivated by demographic considerations and seek to limit Arab construction while promoting Jewish construction.\n\n**Religious Significance**\n\nJerusalem has been sacred to Judaism for roughly 3000 years, to Christianity for around 2000 years, and to Islam for approximately 1400 years. The 2000 Statistical Yearbook of Jerusalem lists 1204 synagogues, 158 churches, and 73 mosques within the city.\n\n**Judaism**\n\nJerusalem has been the holiest city in Judaism and the ancestral and spiritual homeland of the Jewish people since King David proclaimed it his capital in the 10th century BCE. The first section, the Torah (Pentateuch), only mentions Moriah, but in later parts of the Bible, the city is mentioned explicitly.\n\n**Christianity**\n\nJerusalem is generally considered the cradle of Christianity. Christianity reveres Jerusalem for its Old Testament history, and also for its significance in the life of Jesus. According to the New Testament, Jesus was brought to Jerusalem soon after his birth, and later in his life cleansed the Second Temple.\n\n**Islam**\n\nJerusalem is the third-holiest city in Sunni Islam. Islamic tradition holds that for approximately a year, before it was permanently switched to the Kaaba in Mecca, the qibla (direction of prayer) for Muslims was Jerusalem. The city's lasting place in Islam, however, is primarily due to Muhammad's Night Journey.\n\n**Economy**\n\nHistorically, Jerusalem's economy was supported almost exclusively by religious pilgrims, as it was far from the major ports of Jaffa and Gaza. Jerusalem's religious and cultural landmarks today remain the top draw for foreign visitors, with the majority of tourists visiting the Western Wall and the Old City.\n\n**Urban Structure**\n\nJerusalem has traditionally had a low-rise skyline.

writing of the word Jerusalem is dated to the sixth or seventh century BCE [61] [62] and was discovered in Khirbet Beit Lei near Beit Guvrin in 1961 The inscription states: \"I am Yahweh thy God, I will accept the cities of Judah and I will redeem Jerusalem\", [63] [64] [65] or as other scholars suggest: \"Yahweh is the God of the whole earth The mountains of Judah belong to him, to the God of Jerusalem\" [66] [67] An earlier example of the name appears in a papyrus from the 7th century BCE [68] [69]\n\n\nJebus, Zion, City of David\nAn ancient settlement of Jerusalem, founded as early as the Bronze Age on the hill above the Gihon Spring, was, according to the Bible, named Jebus [70] [71] [72] Called the \"Fortress of Zion\" (metsudat Zion), it was renamed as the \"City of David\", [73] and was known by this name in antiquity [74] [75] Another name, \"Zion\", initially referred to a distinct part of the city, but later came to signify the city as a whole, and afterwards to represent the whole biblical Land of Israel.\n\n\nGreek, Roman and Byzantine names\nIn Greek and Latin, the city's name was transliterated Hierosolyma/Hierosoluma (Greek: Ἱεροσόλυμα; in Greek hieròs, ἱερός, means holy), and was the term used by Matthew and Mark in their gospels instead of the Hebrew term [76]\n\n\nSalem\nThe Aramaic Apocryphon of Genesis of the Dead Sea Scrolls (1QapGen 22:13) equates Jerusalem with the earlier \"Salem\" (שלם), said to be the kingdom of Melchizedek in Genesis 14 [77] Other early Hebrew sources, [78] early Christian renderings of the verse [79] and targumim, [80] however, put Salem in Northern Israel near Shechem (Sichem), now Nablus, a city of some importance in early sacred Hebrew writing [81] Possibly the redactor of the Apocryphon of Genesis wanted to dissociate Melchizedek from the area of Shechem, which at the time was in possession of the Samaritans [82] However that may be, later Rabbinic sources also equate Salem with Jerusalem, mainly to link Melchizedek to later Temple traditions [83]\n\n\nArabic names\nOriginally titled Bayt al-Maqdis, today, Jerusalem is most commonly known in Arabic as القُدس, transliterated as al-Quds and meaning \"the holy\" or \"the holy sanctuary\", [47] [48] cognate with Hebrew: הקדש, romanized: ha-qodesh The name is possibly a shortened form of مدينة القُدس Madīnat al-Quds \"city of the holy sanctuary\" after the Hebrew nickname with the same meaning, Ir ha-Qodesh (עיר הקדש) The ق (Q) is pronounced either with a voiceless uvular plosive (/q/), as in Classical Arabic, or with a glottal stop (ʔ) as in Levantine Arabic [7] Official Israeli government policy mandates that أُورُشَلِيمَ, transliterated as Ūrušalīm, which is the name frequently used in Christian translations of the Bible into Arabic, [84] [85] be used as the Arabic language name for the city in conjunction with القُدس, giving أُورُشَلِيمَ-القُدس, Ūrušalīm-al-Quds [86] Palestinian Arab families who hail from this city are often called \"Qudsi\" (قُدسي) or \"Maqdasi\" (مقدسي), while Palestinian Muslim Jerusalemites may use these terms as a demonym [87]\n\n\nHistory\nJerusalem is one of the world's oldest cities, with a history spanning over 5,000 years Its origins trace back to around 3000 BCE, with the first settlement near the Gihon Spring The city is first mentioned in Egyptian Execration texts around 2000 BCE as \"Rusalimum.\" By the 17th century BCE, Jerusalem had developed into a fortified city under Canaanite rule, with massive walls protecting its water system During the Late Bronze Age, Jerusalem became a vassal of Ancient Egypt, as documented in the Amarna letters.\n\n\nPolitical status\nFrom 1923 until 1948, Jerusalem served as the administrative capital of Mandatory Palestine [88]\n\n\nInternational status\nWhile the international community regards East Jerusalem, including the entire Old City, as part of the occupied Palestinian territories, neither part, West or East Jerusalem, is recognized as part of the territory of Israel or the State of Palestine [96] [97] [98] [99] Under the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1947, Jerusalem was envisaged to become a corpus separatum administered by the United Nations In the war of 1948, the western part of the city was occupied by forces of the nascent state of Israel, while the eastern part was occupied by Jordan The international community largely considers the legal status of Jerusalem to derive from the partition plan, and correspondingly refuses to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the city [100]\n\n\nStatus under Israeli rule\nFollowing the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel extended its jurisdiction and administration over East Jerusalem, establishing new municipal borders.\n\n\nJerusalem as capital of Israel\nOn 5 December 1949, Israel's first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, proclaimed Jerusalem as Israel's \"eternal\" and \"sacred\" capital, and eight days later specified that only the war had \"compelled\" the Israeli leadership \"to establish the seat of Government in Tel Aviv\", while \"for the State of Israel there has always been and always will be one capital only – Jerusalem the Eternal\", and that after the war, efforts had been ongoing for creating the conditions for \"the Knesset.. returning to Jerusalem.\" [110] This indeed took place, and since the beginning of 1950 all branches of the Israeli government—legislative, judicial, and executive—have resided there, except for the Ministry of Defense, which is located at HaKirya in Tel Aviv [111] [112] At the time of Ben Gurion's proclamations and the ensuing Knesset vote of 24 January 1950, [112] Jerusalem was divided between Israel and Jordan, and thus the proclamation only applied to West Jerusalem.\n\n\nGovernment precinct and national institutions\nThe Kiryat HaLeom (national precinct) project is intended to house most government agencies and national cultural institutions They are located in the Kiryat HaMemshala (government complex) in the Givat Ram neighbourhood Some government buildings are located in Kiryat Menachem Begin The city is home to the Knesset, [138] the Supreme Court, [139] the Bank of Israel, the National Headquarters of the Israel Police, the official residences of the President and Prime Minister, the Cabinet, and all ministries except for the Ministry of Defense (which is located in central Tel Aviv's HaKirya district) and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (which is located in Rishon LeZion, in the wider Tel Aviv metropolitan area, near Beit Dagan).\n\n\nIsraeli settlements\nSince its capture in 1967, the Israeli government has built 12 Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem, with a population amounting to 220,000 Israeli Jewish settlers as of 2019 [140] The international community consider Israeli settlements to be illegal under international law [141]\n\n\nJerusalem as capital of Palestine\nThe Palestinian National Authority views East Jerusalem as occupied territory according to United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 The Palestinian Authority claims Jerusalem, including the Haram al-Sharif, as the capital of the State of Palestine, [105] The PLO claims that West Jerusalem is also subject to permanent status negotiations However, it has stated that it would be willing to consider alternative solutions, such as making Jerusalem an open city [142]\n\n\nPalestinian offices and institutions\nGovernment offices are located outside the Israeli municipal limits include the Palestinian Security Services, Force 17, the Preventative Security Service and the Ministry of Interior [147] [148] [149] There is a Palestinian Authority regional office and an electoral office located in the Dahiyat al Barid neighborhood [150]\n\n\nMunicipal administration\nThe Jerusalem City Council is a body of 31 elected members headed by the mayor, who serves a five-year term and appoints eight deputies The former mayor of Jerusalem, Uri Lupolianski, was elected in 2003 [151] In the November 2008 city elections, Nir Barkat was elected In November 2018, Moshe Lion was elected mayor [152]\n\n\nGeography\nJerusalem is situated on the southern spur of a plateau in the Judaean Mountains, which include the Mount of Olives (East) and Mount Scopus (North East) The elevation of the Old City is approximately 760 m (2,490 ft) [161] The whole of Jerusalem is surrounded by valleys and dry riverbeds (wadis) The Kidron, Hinnom, and Tyropoeon Valleys intersect in an area just south of the Old City of Jerusalem [162] The Kidron Valley runs to the east of the Old City and separates the Mount of Olives from the city proper Along the southern side of old Jerusalem is the Valley of Hinnom, a steep ravine associated in biblical eschatology with the concept of Gehenna or Hell [163]\n\n\nClimate\nThe city is characterized by a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csa), with hot, dry summers, and mild, wet winters Snow flurries usually occur once or twice a winter, although the city experiences heavy snowfall every three to four years, on average, with short-lived accumulation.\n\n\nDemographics\nJerusalem's population size and composition has shifted many times over its 5,000-year history Since the 19th century, the Old City of Jerusalem has been divided into Jewish, Muslim, Christian, and Armenian quarters Matthew Teller writes that this convention may have originated in the 1841 British Royal Engineers map of Jerusalem, [13] or at least Reverend George Williams' subsequent labelling of it [179]\n\n\nDemographic history\nJerusalem's population size and composition has shifted many times over its 5,000-year history

747,600—63.7% were Jewish, 33.1% Muslim, and 2% Christian [182]\n\n\nUrban planning issues\nCritics of efforts to promote a Jewish majority in Jerusalem say that government planning policies are motivated by demographic considerations and seek to limit Arab construction while promoting Jewish construction [197] According to a World Bank report, the number of recorded building violations between 1996 and 2000 was four and half times higher in Jewish neighbourhoods but four times fewer demolition orders were issued in West Jerusalem than in East Jerusalem; Arabs in Jerusalem were less likely to receive construction permits than Jews, and \"the authorities are much more likely to take action against Palestinian violators\" than Jewish violators of the permit process [198] In recent years, private Jewish foundations have received permission from the government to develop projects on disputed lands, such as the City of David archaeological site in the 60% Arab neighbourhood of Silwan (adjacent to the Old City), [199] and the Museum of Tolerance on Mamilla Cemetery (adjacent to Zion Square) [198] [200]\n\n\nReligious significance\nJerusalem has been sacred to Judaism for roughly 3000 years, to Christianity for around 2000 years, and to Islam for approximately 1400 years The 2000 Statistical Yearbook of Jerusalem lists 1204 synagogues, 158 churches, and 73 mosques within the city [201] Despite efforts to maintain peaceful religious coexistence, some sites, such as the Temple Mount, have been a continuous source of friction and controversy The Temple Mount is the holiest spot in Judaism and the third holiest site in Islam Jews venerate it as the site of the two former Temples and Muslims believe that Muhammad was transported from the Great Mosque of Mecca to this location during the Night Journey.\n\n\nJudaism\nJerusalem has been the holiest city in Judaism and the ancestral and spiritual homeland of the Jewish people since King David proclaimed it his capital in the 10th century BCE [note 5] [21] Without counting its other names, Jerusalem appears in the Hebrew Bible 669 times [202] The first section, the Torah (Pentateuch), only mentions Moriah, but in later parts of the Bible, the city is mentioned explicitly [203] The Temple Mount, which was the site of Solomon's Temple and the Second Temple, is the holiest site in Judaism and the place Jews turn towards during prayer [204] [205] The Western Wall, a remnant of the wall surrounding the Second Temple, is the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray [206] Synagogues around the world are traditionally built with the Holy Ark facing Jerusalem, [207] and Arks within Jerusalem face the Holy of Holies [208] As prescribed in the Mishna and codified in the Shulchan Aruch, daily prayers are recited while facing towards Jerusalem and the Temple Mount Many Jews have \"Mizrach\" plaques hung on a wall of their homes to indicate the direction of prayer [208] [209] The Western Wall is a remnant of the Second Temple and the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray.\n\n\nChristianity\nJerusalem is generally considered the cradle of Christianity [210] Christianity reveres Jerusalem for its Old Testament history, and also for its significance in the life of Jesus According to the New Testament, Jesus was brought to Jerusalem soon after his birth [211] and later in his life cleansed the Second Temple [212] The Cenacle, believed to be the site of Jesus' Last Supper, is located on Mount Zion in the same building that houses the Tomb of King David [213] [214] Another prominent Christian site in Jerusalem is Golgotha, the site of the crucifixion The Gospel of John describes it as being located outside Jerusalem, [215] but recent archaeological evidence suggests Golgotha is a short distance from the Old City walls, within the present-day confines of the city [216] The land occupied by the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is considered one of the top candidates for Golgotha and thus has been a Christian pilgrimage site for the past 2000 years [216] [217] [218] The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is generally considered the most important church in Christendom [219] It contains the two holiest sites in Christianity: the site where Jesus was crucified, and Jesus's empty tomb, where he is believed by Christians to have been buried and resurrected.\n\n\nIslam\nJerusalem is the third-holiest city in Sunni Islam [28] Islamic tradition holds that for approximately a year, before it was permanently switched to the Kaaba in Mecca, the qibla (direction of prayer) for Muslims was Jerusalem [220] [221] The city's lasting place in Islam, however, is primarily due to Muhammad's Night Journey (c. 620 CE) Muslims believe that Muhammad was miraculously transported one night from the Great Mosque of Mecca to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, whereupon he ascended to Heaven to meet previous prophets of Islam [222] [223] [224] The first verse in the Qur'an's Surat al-Isra notes the destination of Muhammad's journey as al-masjid al-aqṣā (\"the farthest place of prayer\") [225] [226] In the earliest days of Islam, this was understood as a reference to a site in the heavens, [227] however, Post-Rashidun Islamic scholars understood it as relating to Jerusalem, and particularly to the site of the former Jewish Temple [228] The hadith, a collection of the sayings of Muhammad, mentions that the location of the Al-Aqsa Mosque is in Jerusalem [229] The Al-Aqsa Mosque, originally named after the wider compound it sits within, [230] was built on the Temple Mount under the Umayyad Caliph Al-Walid several decades after Muhammad's death to commemorate the place from which Muslims believe he had ascended to Heaven [231]\n\n\nEconomy\nHistorically, Jerusalem's economy was supported almost exclusively by religious pilgrims, as it was far from the major ports of Jaffa and Gaza [232] Jerusalem's religious and cultural landmarks today remain the top draw for foreign visitors, with the majority of tourists visiting the Western Wall and the Old City [185] In 2010, Jerusalem was named the top leisure travel city in Africa and the Middle East by Travel + Leisure magazine [233]\nin 2013, 75% of the 3.5 million tourists to Israel visited Jerusalem [234]\n\n\nUrban structure\nJerusalem has traditionally had a low-rise skyline About 18 tall buildings were built at different times in the downtown area when there was no clear policy over the matter One of them, Holyland Tower 1, Jerusalem's tallest building, is a skyscraper by international standards, rising 32 stories Holyland Tower 2, which has been approved for construction, will reach the same height [254] [255]\n\n\nHigh-rise construction\nJerusalem has traditionally had a low-rise skyline About 18 tall buildings were built at different times in the downtown area when there was no clear policy over the matter One of them, Holyland Tower 1, Jerusalem's tallest building, is a skyscraper by international standards, rising 32 stories Holyland Tower 2, which has been approved for construction, will reach the same height [254] [255]\n\n\nNew projects in Jerusalem\nIn 2021, Bashar Masri announced and launched \"Lana\", a massive mix-used project in East Jerusalem, which is located in the neighborhood of Beit Hanina The project is in a partnership between Massar International and the Orthodox Church of Jerusalem It features 400 residential apartments along with a vibrant commercial center that hosts well-known global brands, cinemas, restaurants, cafes, and offices The project also includes modern educational facilities, such as a school and a kindergarten, catering to the needs of residents In addition to its focus on residential and commercial aspects, the Lana project emphasizes the improvement of infrastructure within the project and its surroundings This involves the construction of three to four floors of underground parking to accommodate the residents' vehicles conveniently Furthermore, there is a comprehensive plan to expand the road network surrounding the project, ensuring smooth transportation and accessibility for both residents and visitors It is situated just 15 minutes away from the historic Old City of Jerusalem [262]\n\n\nTransportation\nJerusalem is served by highly developed communication infrastructures, making it a leading logistics hub for Israel.\n\n\nPublic transport\nJerusalem is served by highly developed communication infrastructures, making it a leading logistics hub for Israel.\n\n\nRailway\nThe Jerusalem Light Rail initiated service in August 2011 According to plans, the first rail line will be capable of transporting an estimated 200,000 people daily, and has 23 stops The route is from Pisgat Ze'ev in the north via the Old City and city centre to Mt Herzl in the south.\n\n\nAirport\nIn the past, Jerusalem was also served by the local Jerusalem International Airport, locally known as Atarot Airport It was the first airport built in the British Mandate of Palestine Palestinians considered the Atarot Airport as a \"symbol of Palestinian sovereignty\" [271] The airport falls beyond Green Line After 1948 war, it came under control of Jordan Following the Six Day War of 1967, the airport came under control of Israel [272] With increase of violence in the second intifada, Atarot Airport ceased operation in 2000 Today Jerusalem is served by Ben Gurion Airport, some 50 km (30 mi) northwest of the Jerusalem, on the route to Tel Aviv The Tel Aviv–Jerusalem railway runs non-stop from Jerusalem–Yitzhak Navon railway station to the airport and began operation in 2018 [273]\n\n\nEducation\nJerusalem is home to several prestigious universities offering courses in Hebrew, Arabic and English.\n\n\nUniversities\nJerusalem is home to several prestigious universities offering courses in Hebrew, Arabic and English.\n\n\nArab schools\nIsrael's public schools for Arabs in Jerusalem and other parts of the country have been criticized for offering a lower quality education than those catering to Israeli Jewish students [296] While many schools in the heavily Arab East Jerusalem are filled to capacity and there have been complaints of overcrowding, the Jerusalem Municipality is building over a dozen new schools in the city's Arab neighbourhoods [297] Schools in Ras el-Amud and Umm Lison opened in 2008 [298] In March 2007, the Israeli government approved a five-year plan to build 8,000 new classrooms in the city, 40 percent in the Arab sector and 28 percent in the Haredi sector A budget of 4.6 billion shekels was allocated for this project [299] In 2008, Jewish British philanthropists donated $3 million for the construction of schools for Arabs in East Jerusalem [298] Arab high school students take the Bagrut matriculation exams, so that much of their curriculum parallels that of other Israeli high schools and includes certain Jewish subjects [296]\n\n\nCulture\nAlthough Jerusalem is known primarily for its religious significance, the city is also home to many artistic and cultural venues The Israel Museum attracts nearly one million visitors a year, approximately one-third of them tourists [300] The 8 ha (20-acre) museum complex comprises several buildings featuring special exhibits and extensive collections of Judaica, archaeological findings, and Israeli and European art The Dead Sea scrolls, discovered in the mid-20th century in the Qumran Caves near the Dead Sea, are housed in the Museum's Shrine of the Book [301] The Youth Wing, which mounts changing exhibits and runs an extensive art education programme, is visited by 100,000 children a year The museum has a large outdoor sculpture garden and includes the Holyland Model of Jerusalem, a scale-model of the city during the late Second Temple period [300] The Ticho House in downtown Jerusalem houses the paintings of Anna Ticho and the Judaica collections of her husband, an ophthalmologist who opened Jerusalem's first eye clinic in this building in 1912 [302]\n\n\nMedia\nThe headquarters of the Israel Broadcasting Authority and its successor Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation are located in Jerusalem, as well as television and radio studios for Channel 12, Channel 13, and part of the radio studios of BBC News The Jerusalem Post and The Times of Israel are also headquartered in Jerusalem Local newspapers include the Israeli Kol Ha'ir and the Palestinian Jerusalem Times God TV, an international Christian television network, is also based in the city PYALARA, an organisation based in Jerusalem, transformed Jaba into a digital hub, which is the Middle East's first digital village and is also home to first Media Interactive Learning Center in the Middle East [336]\n\n\nSports\nThe two most popular sports are football (soccer) and basketball [337] Beitar Jerusalem Football Club is one of the most well known in Israel Fans include political figures who often attend its games [338] Jerusalem's other major football team, and one of Beitar's top rivals, is Hapoel Jerusalem F.C Whereas Beitar has been Israel State Cup champion seven times, [339] Hapoel has won the Cup only once Beitar has won the top league six times, while Hapoel has never succeeded Beitar plays in the more prestigious Ligat HaAl, while Hapoel is in the second division Liga Leumit Since its opening in 1992, Teddy Stadium has been Jerusalem's primary football stadium, with a capacity of 31,733

{"title": "Sinking_of_MV_Sewol", "content": "\nBackground\nAt the time of its purchase by Chonghaejin Marine on October 8, 2012, the ship that would come to be known as MV Sewol was eighteen years old and dilapidated [29] It was originally named Ferry Naminoue and was operated from 1994 to 2012 [30] as a transport ship for cargo and passengers by the Japanese company A-Line Ferry [31]: 9  According to A-Line Ferry, it did not experience any problems during its service in Japan [32] After it was purchased, the vessel underwent modifications between October 12, 2012, and February 12, 2013, and was registered by Chonghaejin on October 22, 2012 [31]: 9  The modifications were originally claimed to be illegal, but the Korean Register of Shipping stated that the Sewol had \"normally passed\" all of the blueprint inspections, ship stability tests, and shipboard inclination tests when the cabin was expanded [33]\n\n\nWednesday, April 16, 2014\nOn 16 April at 7:30 a.m (KST), third mate Park Han-kyul and helmsman Cho Joon-ki [56] took over the watch from the previous team At this time, Sewol was heading at a course of about 165 degrees at a speed of about 20 knots (37 km/h; 23 mph) and was operating two radar devices Around 8:20 a.m when the ship was about 3–5 kilometres (2–3 nmi) from entering the Maenggol Channel, Park ordered Cho to change the steering system from autopilot to manual steering When Sewol arrived at the channel at 8:27 a.m at a course of around 137 degrees, the wind speed was between 4–7 metres per second (8–14 kn; 14–25 km/h), the wave height about 0.5 meters (1 ft 8 in), and the visibility good [31]: 38 \n\n\nMultiple turns to the right (08:48)\nRight before the incident, Park and Cho were standing side by side near the ship's wheel at the bridge [67] Captain Lee was absent from the bridge at the time [58] At 8:46 a.m., as Sewol was travelling at a speed of 18 knots (33 km/h; 21 mph) at a course of around 136 degrees, Park ordered Cho to change the course from 135 degrees to 140 degrees, which Cho consequently undertook [31]: 39 \n\n\nEffects of the turn\nLater analysis of Sewol's track chart by the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries revealed that the ship's Automatic Identification System (AIS) had stopped collecting data from 8:48:37 to 8:49:13; consequently, the Ministry and the Jindo VTS lost thirty-six seconds of data [70] [71] While earlier reports and investigations believed that there was a power outage, [72] [73] Huh Yong-bum, the head of the expert advisory panel on the police-prosecution joint investigation team, testified that the AIS failure was due to system limitations and that the failure did not affect the steering [71]\n\n\nCalls for rescue (8:52–9:30)\nDo not move Just stay where you are It's dangerous if you move, so just stay where you are.\n\n\nCaptain and crew\nOn 19 April, Captain Lee Jun-seok was arrested on suspicion of negligence of duty, violation of maritime law and other infringements [214] Lee had abandoned Sewol with passengers still aboard the ferry, while South Korean law explicitly requires captains to remain on the ship during a disaster [215] [216] [217] Two other crew members, a helmsman and the third mate, were also arrested on that day on suspicion of negligence and manslaughter [218] By 26 April, twelve further arrests had been made with the whole crew responsible for navigation in detention [219] [220]\n\n\nPassengers\nAs Sewol capsized, some passengers followed the announcements to stay put, even as the water came in [113] Most of the student passengers obeyed the announcements [114] Some passengers, who disobeyed the announcements, climbed to the top of the ship or jumped into the water and were rescued [115]\n\n\nRescue operations\nAn investigation conducted by Social Disaster Special Investigation Committee clearly confirmed that the Coast Guard Command was responsible for the lives of 304 people In a position with clear duties and authority according to their laws and operation procedures, the Coast Guard Command should have mobilized all available resources to grasp the situation and identify the emergencies with the Sewol ferry, providing direction to the mobilized forces to evacuate the Sewol ferry passengers However, they failed to carry out these actions The Coast Guard Command neither tried to figure out the specific status of the Sewol nor shared the information already secured (through passenger reports, etc.) with dispatchers Even though they should have been aware of the urgency of the Sewol ferry incident based on the information provided by the mobilized forces and the passenger reports, the Coast Guard Command still did not issue the proper commands to the mobilized forces [125]\n\n\nFirst day\nAt 8:58 a.m (KST) on 16 April 2014, the Mokpo Coast Guard dispatched Patrol Vessel No 123 in response to the first report of the incident [98] After receiving the news of the capsizing from the Jeollanam Provincial Government, the Republic of Korea Navy 3rd Fleet sent a Gumdoksuri-class patrol vessel (PKG) to the site at 9:03 a.m.; the Navy dispatched another PKG at 9:09 a.m [129] At 9:04 a.m., the government created the Central Disaster Countermeasure Headquarters (중앙재난안전대책본부), an organization which would directly report to the government The KCG set up a rescue operations headquarters at 9:10 a.m [130]\n\n\nSecond day\nStarting on 17 April, Undine Marine Industries, a privately held company, [144] began to lead the search for missing passengers [145] At 12:30 a.m., hull investigations were started by the KCG with the help of flares [146] As of 6:00 a.m., 171 ships, twenty-nine aircraft and thirty divers were involved in the rescue effort The KCG had assigned twenty divers in teams of two The ROK Navy also assigned eight divers, [147] but the KCG prevented them from participating [145] and waited for divers from Undine Industries [148] At 7:24 a.m., civilian groups of expert divers were reported to be helping out in the rescue operations [149] During the morning, the number of divers involved in the operations reached 555 [150] The navy also established a military control tower on the Dokdo-class assault ship [151] Starting around 2:00 p.m., rescue operations were practically stopped due to bad weather conditions [152] A marine crane arrived on the scene at night [153]\n\n\nSubsequent operations\nAt 10:50 a.m on 18 April, [154] the KCG began pumping in air to support possible air pockets [106] At the same time, divers entered the capsized ship's hull [155] but only gained access to the cargo deck [156] The divers' entrance was later labeled a 'failure' by the Central Disaster Countermeasure Headquarters [157] On 19 April, a navy petty officer who was injured during rescue operations died [158] On 21 April, remotely operated underwater vehicles began to be used for operations [159] On 24 April, the CR200 'Crabster' robot was sent to the rescue site [160] An Undine Marine diver died on 6 May, [161] [162] followed by another diver's death on 30 May [163] On 17 July, a firefighting helicopter returning from rescue operations crashed near an apartment complex, killing all five officers aboard and injuring a high school student [164] [165]\n\n\nForeign response\nThe USS Bonhomme Richard was sent to assist in the air-sea rescue operation, [167] [168] but did not get the approval of the ROK Navy for its helicopters to participate in the rescue [169]\n\n\nSurvivors and casualties\nAt 11:01 a.m., Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation began reporting that all students had been rescued; this news was re-reported by other news organizations and continued until 11:26 a.m [173] Around 11 a.m KST, officers working for the educational departments for the Gyeonggi Province sent text messages to the students' parents stating that all students had been rescued [174] The officers' belief was apparently confirmed by a police officer in the Danwon Police Department [173]\nInitial reports stated that rescuers retrieved 368 people from cold waters as the passengers, mostly students, had jumped overboard when the vessel started sinking; the South Korean government later corrected this statement, saying 295 passengers remained missing [175] Twenty-two of the twenty-nine crew survived, including fifteen responsible for the navigation [176]\n\n\nInvestigation\nAs of 13 December 2022, investigators have concluded that the cause of the sinking was undetermined [187] Early theories about the sinking included a range of explanations, given as follows.\n\n\nCauses\nAs of 13 December 2022, investigators have concluded that the cause of the sinking was undetermined [187] Early theories about the sinking included a range of explanations, given as follows.\n\n\nOther theories\nGong Gil-young (공길영), a professor of aviation engineering at Korea Maritime University, commented that Sewol's sudden turn was simply the 'first cause' and that there were secondary causes to the incident He advocated an explosion as the most probable secondary cause [207] [208]\n\n\nExplosion\nGong Gil-young (공길영), a professor of aviation engineering at Korea Maritime University, commented that Sewol's sudden turn was simply the 'first cause' and that there were secondary causes to the incident He advocated an explosion as the most probable secondary cause [207] [208]\n\n\nReef collision\nAt the beginning of the investigation, the KCG thought that the cause was a collision with a reef, believing this likely because the area was foggy [209] Captain Lee denied this was the cause of the sinking, [210] and a reef collision has been dismissed as a cause by consensus among experts [211] The theory is also not currently advocated by the KCG [188]\n\n\nCollision with submarine\nSeveral media outlets, such as the Jaju Sibo (Self-Reliance News) have speculated the ferry sinking to be result of crashing with a submarine [212] This was from discussions over a screenshot from videos of the ferry sinking, where a dark vessel was visible in sea fog behind the ship While most media correctly identified the vessel as a fishing boat, a few have concluded this to be a military submarine of South Korean, Japanese, American, French, or Israeli origin This theory was repeated by online vigilante group \"Zaro -- Netizens' investigation team\", who pointed out in a 9-hour long video that the route taken by the ill-fated ferry didn't match conventional routes, and external factors such as a submarine collision can explain the disaster He claimed an errant sub collided with the Sewol based on his analysis of radar recordings and the Navy may have concealed the submarine crash in order to achieve its goal of sailing 2 million miles (3.2 million kilometres) without a sinking [213]\n\n\nCaptain and crew\nOn 19 April, Captain Lee Jun-seok was arrested on suspicion of negligence of duty, violation of maritime law and other infringements [214] Lee had abandoned Sewol with passengers still aboard the ferry, while South Korean law explicitly requires captains to remain on the ship during a disaster [215] [216] [217] Two other crew members, a helmsman and the third mate, were also arrested on that day on suspicion of negligence and manslaughter [218] By 26 April, twelve further arrests had been made with the whole crew responsible for navigation in detention [219] [220]\n\n\nOperators\nOn 8 May, the chief executive of Chonghaejin, Kim Han-sik, was arrested and faced charges including causing death by negligence [225] Four other Chonghaejin officials were also taken into custody [226] The Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries revoked the company's license to operate ferries on the Incheon-Jeju Island route in May 2014 [227]\n\n\nRegulation\nThe Sewol disaster raised questions regarding governmental regulation of shipping in South Korea Shipping is regulated by the Korean Shipping Association, which is also an industry trade group, something experts consider a likely conflict of interest In addition, government regulators outside the Association frequently move to jobs as part of the association after their government service Yun Jong-hwui, a professor at Korea Maritime and Ocean University, notes that while South Korean regulations are strong, they are often poorly enforced [228]\n\n\nLitigation\nOn 3 June, the Gwangju District Court issued arrest warrants for a senior vessel safety operator of the Korea Shipping Association's Incheon unit and a vessel inspector of the KR's Mokpo unit [229] Amongst fifteen crew accused of the sinking, prosecutors sought the death penalty for Captain Lee under the charge of homicide for failing to carry out his duty Lead prosecutor Park Jae-eok said: \"Lee supplied the cause of the sinking of the Sewol .. he has the heaviest responsibility for the accident We ask that the court sentence him to death.\" While no formal pleas were made, Lee denied intent to kill The others had lesser charges, including negligence.\n\n\nAftermath\nBased on the National Crisis Management Basic Guidelines' explicit provisions, the Blue House should have played the role of a control tower in a national crisis situation However, this control tower, which was absent on April 16, 2014, became active only when the public opinion toward the government worsened after the disaster To prevent the spread of criticism of their administration, the Blue House provided misleading information to the public and took actions with the purpose of polarizing the public according to their political interests The crisis was viewed by the Blue House as a \"crisis of the regime,\" and in specific instances when there was a divide in public sentiment, the president and the government attacked the individuals and groups who were critical of them of being \"ideologically biased\" and \"pro-North Korea forces,\" and imposed restrictions During this process, the Blue House utilized right-wing organizations and strengthened their conservative base by providing financial support to the organizations that cooperated with them or by appointing active personnel to key positions The Blue House did not protect the victims, but instead stigmatized them as instigated by politically aligned groups In this way, Park Geun-hye's Blue House distorted the victims' demands, aggravated social conflict, and even hindered comprehensive fact-finding investigation efforts aimed to improve future disaster response capabilities and enact special laws [125]\n\n\nGovernment's report and concerns about public opinion\nBased on the National Crisis Management Basic Guidelines' explicit provisions, the Blue House should have played the role

State Crime\nThe arrest of Yoo Byung-eun and the confiscation of his property were key to ending the Sewol ferry scandal according to the Defense Security Command (DSC), and a special task force was organized to apprehend Yoo The Defense Security Command argued that monitoring civilians in Geumsuwon, as well as collecting vast amounts of personal information on members of the Evangelical Baptist Church (Salvation Sect) were considered legitimate \"administrative support.\" However, the activities of the Defense Security Command were determined to be operations that should only be carried out by investigative agencies, thus rendering these acts illegal as they could not be categorized as administrative support under the Administrative Procedures Act It was also confirmed that these illegal actions taken by the Defense Security Command were regularly reported to the Blue House [243]\n\n\nMedia representation\nThe disaster is the subject of the 2014 documentary film The Truth Shall Not Sink with Sewol [245] The director's cut of the film was made available for public viewing on YouTube on 31 August 2015 [246] Two British filmmakers that were living in South Korea during the tragedy, Neil George and Matthew Root, created the documentary After the Sewol, which was released in several forms between 2016 and 2020 George later reorganized the footage into Crossroads, with Root credited only as producer, with a 38-minute cut made viewable through Asian Boss The film uses interviews with survivors, emergency response workers, and family members of the victims along with news coverage to create a study about the conflicting reports about disaster [247] A separate short documentary In the Absence was created to showcase the disaster in real time, with audio, visual and multi-media messages and video from the victims The documentary was nominated for Best Documentary Short in the 92nd Academy Awards in 2020 [248]\n\n\nReactions\nIn addition to reaction against the actions of Sewol, [249] there has been a much wider political reaction to the disaster Criticism has ranged from anger at the lax regulatory environment, which may have contributed to the safety violations that could have sunk Sewol, [250] to anger about the rescue operations, [251] to anger at President Park, whose approval ratings fell from a high of 71 percent before the disaster to \"the

Coalition evaluated the results of the investigation of the SDC, pointing out four major issues First, the investigation of the failed rescue efforts on the day of the disaster was not conducted properly Second, there were questionable acts committed by the Park administration during the investigation that were widely publicized, such as concealing information, interfering with the investigation of the sinking and rescue, violations of the rights of the victims' families, and illegal interrogations Representatives from the group noted it was impossible to obtain data from Korea's intelligence agencies (the acting prime minister after Park was removed from office designated Park's activities on the day of the disaster as a matter of \"presidential record\", making the files unable to be accessed for up to 30 years [293]) Third, the cause of the sinking could not be determined Fourth, various limitations and problems, including confusion due to lack of communication, were revealed in the investigation process.\n\n\nSalvage\nOn 22 March 2017, the salvage operation began to raise the wreck of Sewol [294] A Chinese consortium, Shanghai Salvage Company, was contracted by the government to carry out the operation [295] The ship was lying on her port side, nearly forty metres below the surface Diesel and oil were drained from the ship All the cabins were sealed and a huge fence was erected on the seabed to prevent any wreckage from drifting away A crane lifted the bow of the ship five degrees so that thirty-three lifting beams could be placed underneath The salvage crew pumped water out of the ship's ballast tanks and attached air bags to increase the ship's buoyancy Cables were attached to the lifting beams and strand jacks gradually lifted the ship to thirteen metres below the surface, where she was then attached to a barge [296] Sewol was then towed and loaded onto a semi-submersible vessel, Dockwise White Marlin [297] She was loaded onto self-propelled modular transporters (SPMTs) while on the vessel, which then transported her to shore The vessel docked at Mokpo, where ALE were contracted to unload the ship using the SPMTs [298] The wreck is located on a Mokpo dock at 34°45'30.69\"N 126°21'3.30\"E.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Introduction**\n\nThe sinking of MV Sewol was a maritime disaster that occurred on April 16, 2014, off the coast of South Korea. The ferry, which was carrying 476 passengers, including 325 high school students, capsized and sank while en route from Incheon to Jeju Island. The incident resulted in the loss of 304 lives, making it one of the deadliest maritime disasters in South Korean history.\n\n**Background**\n\nAt the time of its purchase by Chonghaejin Marine on October 8, 2012, the ship that would come to be known as MV Sewol was eighteen years old and dilapidated. It was originally named Ferry Naminoue and was operated from 1994 to 2012 as a transport ship for cargo and passengers by the Japanese company A-Line Ferry. According to A-Line Ferry, it did not experience any problems during its service in Japan. After it was purchased, the vessel underwent modifications between October 12, 2012, and February 12, 2013, and was registered by Chonghaejin on October 22, 2012. The modifications were originally claimed to be illegal, but the Korean Register of Shipping stated that the Sewol had \"normally passed\" all of the blueprint inspections, ship stability tests, and shipboard inclination tests when the cabin was expanded.\n\n**Wednesday, April 16, 2014**\n\nOn 16 April at 7:30 a.m (KST), third mate Park Han-kyul and helmsman Cho Joon-ki took over the watch from the previous team. At this time, Sewol was heading at a course of about 165 degrees at a speed of about 20 knots (37 km/h; 23 mph) and was operating two radar devices. Around 8:20 a.m, when the ship was about 3–5 kilometres (2–3 nmi) from entering the Maenggol Channel, Park ordered Cho to change the steering system from autopilot to manual steering. Sewol arrived at the channel at 8:27 a.m at a course of around 137 degrees, the wind speed was between 4–7 metres per second (8–14 kn; 14–25 km/h), the wave height about 0.5 meters (1 ft 8 in), and the visibility good.\n\n**Multiple turns to the right (08:48)**\n\nRight before the incident, Park and Cho were standing side by side near the ship's wheel at the bridge. Captain Lee was absent from the bridge at the time. At 8:46 a.m., as Sewol was travelling at a speed of 18 knots (33 km/h; 21 mph) at a course of around 136 degrees, Park ordered Cho to change the course from 135 degrees to 140 degrees, which Cho consequently undertook.\n\n**Effects of the turn**\n\nLater analysis of Sewol's track chart by the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries revealed that the ship's Automatic Identification System (AIS) had stopped collecting data from 8:48:37 to 8:49:13; consequently, the Ministry and the Jindo VTS lost thirty-six seconds of data. While earlier reports and investigations believed that there was a power outage, Huh Yong-bum, the head of the expert advisory panel on the police-prosecution joint investigation team, testified that the AIS failure was due to system limitations and that the failure did not affect the steering.\n\n**Calls for rescue (8:52–9:30)**\n\nDo not move Just stay where you are It's dangerous if you move, so just stay where you are.\n\n**Captain and crew**\n\nOn 19 April, Captain Lee Jun-seok was arrested on suspicion of negligence of duty, violation of maritime law and other infringements. Lee had abandoned Sewol with passengers still aboard the ferry, while South Korean law explicitly requires captains to remain on the ship during a disaster. Two other crew members, a helmsman and the third mate, were also arrested on that day on suspicion of negligence and manslaughter. By 26 April, twelve further arrests had been made with the whole crew responsible for navigation in detention.\n\n**Passengers**\n\nAs Sewol capsized, some passengers followed the announcements to stay put, even as the water came in. Most of the student passengers obeyed the announcements. Some passengers, who disobeyed the announcements, climbed to the top of the ship or jumped into the water and were rescued.\n\n**Rescue operations**\n\nAn investigation conducted by Social Disaster Special Investigation Committee clearly confirmed that the Coast Guard Command was responsible for the lives of 304 people. In a position with clear duties and authority according to their laws and operation procedures, the Coast Guard Command should have mobilized all available resources to grasp the situation and identify the emergencies with the Sewol ferry, providing direction to the mobilized forces to evacuate the Sewol ferry passengers. However, they failed to carry out these actions. The Coast Guard Command neither tried to figure out the specific status of the Sewol nor shared the information already secured (through passenger reports, etc.) with dispatchers. Even though they should have been aware of the urgency of the Sewol ferry incident based on the information provided by the mobilized forces and the passenger reports, the Coast Guard Command still did not issue the proper commands to the mobilized forces.\n\n**First day**\n\nAt 8:58 a.m (KST) on 16 April 2014, the Mokpo Coast Guard dispatched Patrol Vessel No 123 in response to the first report of the incident. After receiving the news of the capsizing from the Jeollanam Provincial Government, the Republic of Korea Navy 3rd Fleet sent a Gumdoksuri-class patrol vessel (PKG) to the site at 9:03 a.m.; the Navy dispatched another PKG at 9:09 a.m. At 9:04 a.m., the government created the Central Disaster Countermeasure Headquarters (중앙재난안전대책본부), an organization which would directly report to the government. The KCG set up a rescue operations headquarters at 9:10 a.m.\n\n**Second day**\n\nStarting on 17 April, Undine Marine Industries, a privately held company, began to lead the search for missing passengers. At 12:30 a.m., hull investigations were started by the KCG with the help of flares. As of 6:00 a.m., 171 ships, twenty-nine aircraft and thirty divers were involved in the rescue effort. The KCG had assigned twenty divers in teams of two. The ROK Navy also assigned eight divers, but the KCG prevented them from participating and waited for divers from Undine Industries. At 7:24 a.m., civilian groups of expert divers were reported to be helping out in the rescue operations. During the morning, the number of divers involved in the operations reached 555. The navy also established a military control tower on the Dokdo-class assault ship. Starting around 2:00 p.m., rescue operations were practically stopped due to bad weather conditions. A marine crane arrived on the scene at night.\n\n**Subsequent operations**\n\nAt 10:50 a.m on 18 April, the KCG began pumping in air to support possible air pockets. At the same time, divers entered the capsized ship's hull but only gained access to the cargo deck. The divers' entrance was later labeled a 'failure' by the Central Disaster Countermeasure Headquarters. On 19 April, a navy petty officer who was injured during rescue operations died. On 21 April, remotely operated underwater vehicles began to be used for operations. On 24 April, the CR200 'Crabster' robot was sent to the rescue site. An Undine Marine diver died on 6 May, followed by another diver's death on 30 May. On 17 July, a firefighting helicopter returning from rescue operations crashed near an apartment complex, killing all five officers aboard and injuring a high school student.\n\n**Foreign response**\n\nThe USS Bonhomme Richard was sent to assist in the air-sea rescue operation, but did not get the approval of the ROK Navy for its helicopters to participate in the rescue.\n\n**Survivors and casualties**\n\nAt 11:01 a.m., Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation began reporting that all students had been rescued; this news was re-reported by other news organizations and continued until 11:26 a.m. Around 11 a.m KST, officers working for the educational departments for the Gyeonggi Province sent text messages to the students' parents stating that all students had been rescued. The officers' belief was apparently confirmed by a police officer in the Danwon Police Department. Initial reports stated that rescuers retrieved 368 people from cold waters as the passengers, mostly students, had jumped overboard when the vessel started sinking; the South Korean government later corrected this statement, saying 295 passengers remained missing. Twenty-two of the twenty-nine crew survived, including fifteen responsible for the navigation.\n\n**Investigation**\n\nAs of 13 December 2022, investigators have concluded that the cause of the sinking was undetermined. Early theories about the sinking included a range of explanations, given as follows.\n\n**Other theories**\n\nGong Gil-young, a professor of aviation engineering at Korea Maritime University, commented that Sewol's sudden turn was simply the 'first cause' and that there were secondary causes to the incident. He advocated an explosion as the most probable secondary cause.\n\n**Explosion**\n\nGong Gil-young, a professor of aviation engineering at Korea Maritime University, commented that Sewol's sudden turn was simply the 'first cause' and that there were secondary causes to the incident. He advocated an explosion as the most probable secondary cause.\n\n**Reef collision**\n\nAt the beginning of the investigation, the KCG thought that the cause was a collision with a reef, believing this likely because the area was foggy. Captain Lee denied this was the cause of the sinking, and a reef collision has been dismissed as a cause by consensus among experts. The theory is also not currently advocated by the KCG.\n\n**Collision with submarine**\n\nSeveral media outlets, such as the Jaju Sibo (Self-Reliance News), have speculated the ferry sinking to be result of crashing with a submarine. This was from discussions over a screenshot from videos of the ferry sinking, where a dark vessel was visible in sea fog behind the ship. While most media correctly identified the vessel as a fishing boat, a few have concluded this to be a military submarine of South Korean, Japanese, American, French, or Israeli origin. This theory was repeated by online vigilante group \"Zaro -- Netizens' investigation team\", who pointed out in a 9-hour long video that the route taken by the ill-fated ferry didn't match conventional routes, and external factors such as a submarine collision can explain the disaster. He claimed an errant sub collided with the Sewol based on his analysis of radar recordings and the Navy may have concealed the submarine crash in order to achieve its goal of sailing 2 million miles (3.2 million kilometres) without a sinking.\n\n**Captain and crew operators**\n\nOn 8 May, the chief executive of Chonghaejin, Kim Han-sik, was arrested and faced charges including causing death by negligence. Four other Chonghaejin officials were also taken into custody. The Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries revoked the company's license to operate ferries on the Incheon-Jeju Island route in May 2014.\n\n**Regulation**\n\nThe Sewol disaster raised questions regarding governmental regulation of shipping in South Korea. Shipping is regulated by the Korean Shipping Association, which is also an industry trade group, something experts consider a likely conflict of interest. In addition, government regulators outside the Association frequently move to jobs as part of the association after their government service. Yun Jong-hwui, a professor at Korea Maritime and Ocean University, notes that while South Korean regulations are strong, they are often poorly enforced.\n\n**Litigation**\n\nOn 3 June, the Gwangju District Court issued arrest warrants for a senior vessel safety operator of the Korea Shipping Association's Incheon unit and a vessel inspector of the KR's Mokpo unit. Amongst fifteen crew accused of the sinking, prosecutors sought the death penalty for Captain Lee under the charge of homicide for failing to carry out his duty. Lead prosecutor Park Jae-eok said: \"Lee supplied the cause of the sinking of the Sewol.. he has the heaviest responsibility for the accident We ask that the court sentence him to death.\" While no formal pleas were made, Lee denied intent to kill. The others had lesser charges, including negligence.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nBased on the National Crisis Management Basic Guidelines' explicit provisions, the Blue House should have played the role of a control tower in a national crisis situation. However, this control tower, which was absent on April 16, 2014, became active only when the public opinion toward the government worsened after the disaster. To prevent the spread of criticism of their administration, the Blue House provided misleading information to the public and took actions with the purpose of polarizing the public according to their political interests. The crisis was viewed by the Blue House as a \"crisis of the regime,\" and in specific instances when there was a divide in public sentiment, the president and the government attacked the individuals and groups who were critical of them of being \"ideologically biased\" and \"pro-North Korea forces,\" and imposed restrictions. During this process, the Blue House utilized right-wing organizations and strengthened their conservative base by providing financial support to the organizations that cooperated with them or by appointing active personnel to key positions. The Blue House did not protect the victims, but instead stigmatized them as instigated by politically aligned groups. In this way, Park Geun-hye's Blue House distorted the victims' demands, aggravated social conflict, and even hindered comprehensive fact-finding investigation efforts aimed to improve future disaster response capabilities and enact special laws.\n\n**Government's report and concerns about public opinion**\n\nBased on the National Crisis Management Basic Guidelines' explicit provisions, the Blue House should have played the role of a control tower in a national crisis situation.

The Defense Security Command argued that monitoring civilians in Geumsuwon, as well as collecting vast amounts of personal information on members of the Evangelical Baptist Church (Salvation Sect), were considered legitimate \"administrative support.\" However, the activities of the Defense Security Command were determined to be operations that should only be carried out by investigative agencies, thus rendering these acts illegal as they could not be categorized as administrative support under the Administrative Procedures Act. It was also confirmed that these illegal actions taken by the Defense Security Command were regularly reported to the Blue House.\n\n**Media representation**\n\nThe disaster is the subject of the 2014 documentary film The Truth Shall Not Sink with Sewol. The director's cut of the film was made available for public viewing on YouTube on 31 August 2015. Two British filmmakers that were living in South Korea during the tragedy, Neil George and Matthew Root, created the documentary After the Sewol, which was released in several forms between 2016 and 2020.

The documentary was nominated for Best Documentary Short in the 92nd Academy Awards in 2020.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nIn addition to reaction against the actions of Sewol, there has been a much wider political reaction to the disaster. Criticism has ranged from anger at the lax regulatory environment, which may have contributed to the safety violations that could have sunk Sewol, to anger about the rescue operations, to anger at President Park, whose approval ratings fell from a high of 71 percent before the disaster to \"the 40 percent range\" weeks afterwards.\n\n**Political**\n\nIn addition to reaction against the actions of Sewol, there has been a much wider political reaction to the disaster.

detention [219] [220]\n\n\nPassengers\nAs Sewol capsized, some passengers followed the announcements to stay put, even as the water came in [113] Most of the student passengers obeyed the announcements [114] Some passengers, who disobeyed the announcements, climbed to the top of the ship or jumped into the water and were rescued [115]\n\n\nRescue operations\nAn investigation conducted by Social Disaster Special Investigation Committee clearly confirmed that the Coast Guard Command was responsible for the lives of 304 people In a position with clear duties and authority according to their laws and operation procedures, the Coast Guard Command should have mobilized all available resources to grasp the situation and identify the emergencies with the Sewol ferry, providing direction to the mobilized forces to evacuate the Sewol ferry passengers However, they failed to carry out these actions The Coast Guard Command neither tried to figure out the specific status of the Sewol nor shared the information already secured (through passenger reports, etc.) with dispatchers Even though they should have been aware of the urgency of the Sewol ferry incident based on the information provided by the mobilized forces and the passenger reports, the Coast Guard Command still did not issue the proper commands to the mobilized forces [125]\n\n\nFirst day\nAt 8:58 a.m (KST) on 16 April 2014, the Mokpo Coast Guard dispatched Patrol Vessel No 123 in response to the first report of the incident [98] After receiving the news of the capsizing from the Jeollanam Provincial Government, the Republic of Korea Navy 3rd Fleet sent a Gumdoksuri-class patrol vessel (PKG) to the site at 9:03 a.m.; the Navy dispatched another PKG at 9:09 a.m [129] At 9:04 a.m., the government created the Central Disaster Countermeasure Headquarters (중앙재난안전대책본부), an organization which would directly report to the government The KCG set up a rescue operations headquarters at 9:10 a.m [130]\n\n\nSecond day\nStarting on 17 April, Undine Marine Industries, a privately held company, [144] began to lead the search for missing passengers [145] At 12:30 a.m., hull investigations were started by the KCG with the help of flares [146] As of 6:00 a.m., 171 ships, twenty-nine aircraft and thirty divers were involved in the rescue effort The KCG had assigned twenty divers in teams of two The ROK Navy also assigned eight divers, [147] but the KCG prevented them from participating [145] and waited for divers from Undine Industries [148] At 7:24 a.m., civilian groups of expert divers were reported to be helping out in the rescue operations [149] During the morning, the number of divers involved in the operations reached 555 [150] The navy also established a military control tower on the Dokdo-class assault ship [151] Starting around 2:00 p.m., rescue operations were practically stopped due to bad weather conditions [152] A marine crane arrived on the scene at night [153]\n\n\nSubsequent operations\nAt 10:50 a.m on 18 April, [154] the KCG began pumping in air to support possible air pockets [106] At the same time, divers entered the capsized ship's hull [155] but only gained access to the cargo deck [156] The divers' entrance was later labeled a 'failure' by the Central Disaster Countermeasure Headquarters [157] On 19 April, a navy petty officer who was injured during rescue operations died [158] On 21 April, remotely operated underwater vehicles began to be used for operations [159] On 24 April, the CR200 'Crabster' robot was sent to the rescue site [160] An Undine Marine diver died on 6 May, [161] [162] followed by another diver's death on 30 May [163] On 17 July, a firefighting helicopter returning from rescue operations crashed near an apartment complex, killing all five officers aboard and injuring a high school student [164] [165]\n\n\nForeign response\nThe USS Bonhomme Richard was sent to assist in the air-sea rescue operation, [167] [168] but did not get the approval of the ROK Navy for its helicopters to participate in the rescue [169]\n\n\nSurvivors and casualties\nAt 11:01 a.m., Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation began reporting that all students had been rescued; this news was re-reported by other news organizations and continued until 11:26 a.m [173] Around 11 a.m KST, officers working for the educational departments for the Gyeonggi Province sent text messages to the students' parents stating that all students had been rescued [174] The officers' belief was apparently confirmed by a police officer in the Danwon Police Department [173]\nInitial reports stated that rescuers retrieved 368 people from cold waters as the passengers, mostly students, had jumped overboard when the vessel started sinking; the South Korean government later corrected this statement, saying 295 passengers remained missing [175] Twenty-two of the twenty-nine crew survived, including fifteen responsible for the navigation [176]\n\n\nInvestigation\nAs of 13 December 2022, investigators have concluded that the cause of the sinking was undetermined [187] Early theories about the sinking included a range of explanations, given as follows.\n\n\nCauses\nAs of 13 December 2022, investigators have concluded that the cause of the sinking was undetermined [187] Early theories about the sinking included a range of explanations, given as follows.\n\n\nOther theories\nGong Gil-young (공길영), a professor of aviation engineering at Korea Maritime University, commented that Sewol's sudden turn was simply the 'first cause' and that there were secondary causes to the incident He advocated an explosion as the most probable secondary cause [207] [208]\n\n\nExplosion\nGong Gil-young (공길영), a professor of aviation engineering at Korea Maritime University, commented that Sewol's sudden turn was simply the 'first cause' and that there were secondary causes to the incident He advocated an explosion as the most probable secondary cause [207] [208]\n\n\nReef collision\nAt the beginning of the investigation, the KCG thought that the cause was a collision with a reef, believing this likely because the area was foggy [209] Captain Lee denied this was the cause of the sinking, [210] and a reef collision has been dismissed as a cause by consensus among experts [211] The theory is also not currently advocated by the KCG [188]\n\n\nCollision with submarine\nSeveral media outlets, such as the Jaju Sibo (Self-Reliance News) have speculated the ferry sinking to be result of crashing with a submarine [212] This was from discussions over a screenshot from videos of the ferry sinking, where a dark vessel was visible in sea fog behind the ship While most media correctly identified the vessel as a fishing boat, a few have concluded this to be a military submarine of South Korean, Japanese, American, French, or Israeli origin This theory was repeated by online vigilante group \"Zaro -- Netizens' investigation team\", who pointed out in a 9-hour long video that the route taken by the ill-fated ferry didn't match conventional routes, and external factors such as a submarine collision can explain the disaster He claimed an errant sub collided with the Sewol based on his analysis of radar recordings and the Navy may have concealed the submarine crash in order to achieve its goal of sailing 2 million miles (3.2 million kilometres) without a sinking [213]\n\n\nCaptain and crew\nOn 19 April, Captain Lee Jun-seok was arrested on suspicion of negligence of duty, violation of maritime law and other infringements [214] Lee had abandoned Sewol with passengers still aboard the ferry, while South Korean law explicitly requires captains to remain on the ship during a disaster [215] [216] [217] Two other crew members, a helmsman and the third mate, were also arrested on that day on suspicion of negligence and manslaughter [218] By 26 April, twelve further arrests had been made with the whole crew responsible for navigation in detention [219] [220]\n\n\nOperators\nOn 8 May, the chief executive of Chonghaejin, Kim Han-sik, was arrested and faced charges including causing death by negligence [225] Four other Chonghaejin officials were also taken into custody [226] The Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries revoked the company's license to operate ferries on the Incheon-Jeju Island route in May 2014 [227]\n\n\nRegulation\nThe Sewol disaster raised questions regarding governmental regulation of shipping in South Korea Shipping is regulated by the Korean Shipping Association, which is also an industry trade group, something experts consider a likely conflict of interest In addition, government regulators outside the Association frequently move to jobs as part of the association after their government service Yun Jong-hwui, a professor at Korea Maritime and Ocean University, notes that while South Korean regulations are strong, they are often poorly enforced [228]\n\n\nLitigation\nOn 3 June, the Gwangju District Court issued arrest warrants for a senior vessel safety operator of the Korea Shipping Association's Incheon unit and a vessel inspector of the KR's Mokpo unit [229] Amongst fifteen crew accused of the sinking, prosecutors sought the death penalty for Captain Lee under the charge of homicide for failing to carry out his duty Lead prosecutor Park Jae-eok said: \"Lee supplied the cause of the sinking of the Sewol .. he has the heaviest responsibility for the accident We ask that the court sentence him to death.\" While no formal pleas were made, Lee denied intent to kill The others had lesser charges, including negligence.\n\n\nAftermath\nBased on the National Crisis Management Basic Guidelines' explicit provisions, the Blue House should have played the role of a control tower in a national crisis situation However, this control tower, which was absent on April 16, 2014, became active only when the public opinion toward the government worsened after the disaster To prevent the spread of criticism of their administration, the Blue House provided misleading information to the public and took actions with the purpose of polarizing the public according to their political interests The crisis was viewed by the Blue House as a \"crisis of the regime,\" and in specific instances when there was a divide in public sentiment, the president and the government attacked the individuals and groups who were critical of them of being \"ideologically biased\" and \"pro-North Korea forces,\" and imposed restrictions During this process, the Blue House utilized right-wing organizations and strengthened their conservative base by providing financial support to the organizations that cooperated with them or by appointing active personnel to key positions The Blue House did not protect the victims, but instead stigmatized them as instigated by politically aligned groups In this way, Park Geun-hye's Blue House distorted the victims' demands, aggravated social conflict, and even hindered comprehensive fact-finding investigation efforts aimed to improve future disaster response capabilities and enact special laws [125]\n\n\nGovernment's

comprehensive fact-finding investigation efforts aimed to improve future disaster response capabilities and enact special laws [125]\n\n\nThe Disaster and State Crime\nThe arrest of Yoo Byung-eun and the confiscation of his property were key to ending the Sewol ferry scandal according to the Defense Security Command (DSC), and a special task force was organized to apprehend Yoo The Defense Security Command argued that monitoring civilians in Geumsuwon, as well as collecting vast amounts of personal information on members of the Evangelical Baptist Church (Salvation Sect) were considered legitimate \"administrative support.\" However, the activities of the Defense Security Command were determined to be operations that should only be carried out by investigative agencies, thus rendering these acts illegal as they could not be categorized as administrative support under the Administrative Procedures Act It was also confirmed that these illegal actions taken by the Defense Security Command were regularly reported to the Blue House [243]\n\n\nMedia representation\nThe disaster is the subject of the 2014 documentary film The Truth Shall Not Sink with Sewol [245] The director's cut of the film was made available for public viewing on YouTube on 31 August 2015 [246] Two British filmmakers that were living in South Korea during the tragedy, Neil George and Matthew Root, created the documentary After the Sewol, which was released in several forms between 2016 and 2020 George later reorganized the footage into Crossroads, with Root credited only as producer, with a 38-minute cut made viewable through Asian Boss The film uses interviews with survivors, emergency response workers, and family members of the victims along with news coverage to create a study about the conflicting reports about disaster [247] A separate short documentary In the Absence was created to showcase the disaster in real time, with audio, visual and multi-media messages and video from the victims The documentary was nominated for Best Documentary Short in the 92nd Academy Awards in 2020 [248]\n\n\nReactions\nIn addition to reaction against the actions of Sewol, [249] there has been a much wider political reaction to the disaster Criticism has ranged from anger at the lax regulatory environment, which may have contributed to the safety violations that could have sunk Sewol, [250] to anger about the rescue operations, [251] to anger at President Park, whose approval ratings fell from a high of 71 percent before the disaster to \"the 40 percent range\" weeks afterwards [252]\n\n\nPolitical\nIn addition to reaction against the actions of Sewol, [249] there has been a much wider political reaction to the disaster Criticism has ranged from anger at the lax regulatory

from a high of 71 percent before the disaster to \"the 40 percent range\" weeks afterwards [252]\n\n\nCivilian\nOn 17 April, a representative of Cheonghaejin Marine apologized for the incident [273] The chairman and CEO of the KR, Chon Young-Kee, resigned on 28 April, following raids on its offices by South Korean prosecutors [274]\n\n\nVictims' families\nThe 4–16 Coalition (translated name) represents some of the Sewol victims' families, and it has encouraged the investigation of the Sewol ferry accident [292]  The 4–16 Coalition evaluated the results of the investigation of the SDC, pointing out four major issues First, the investigation of the failed rescue efforts on the day of the disaster was not conducted properly Second, there were questionable acts committed by the Park administration during the investigation that were widely publicized, such as concealing information, interfering with the investigation of the sinking and rescue, violations of the rights of the victims' families, and illegal interrogations Representatives from the group noted it was impossible to obtain data from Korea's intelligence agencies (the acting prime minister after Park was removed from office designated Park's activities on the day of the disaster as a matter of \"presidential record\", making the files unable to be accessed for up to 30 years [293]) Third, the cause of the sinking could not be determined Fourth, various limitations and problems, including confusion due to lack of communication, were revealed in the investigation process.\n\n\nSalvage\nOn 22 March 2017, the salvage operation began to raise the wreck of Sewol [294] A Chinese consortium, Shanghai Salvage Company, was contracted by the government to carry out the operation [295] The ship was lying on her port side, nearly forty metres below the surface Diesel and oil were drained from the ship All the cabins were sealed and a huge fence was erected on the seabed to prevent any wreckage from drifting away A crane lifted the bow of the ship five degrees so that thirty-three lifting beams could be placed underneath The salvage crew pumped water out of the ship's ballast tanks and attached air bags to increase the ship's buoyancy Cables were attached to the lifting beams and strand jacks gradually lifted the ship to thirteen metres below the surface, where she was then attached to a barge [296] Sewol was then towed and loaded onto a semi-submersible vessel, Dockwise White Marlin [297] She was loaded onto self-propelled modular transporters (SPMTs) while on the vessel, which then transported her to shore The vessel docked at Mokpo, where ALE were contracted to unload the ship using the SPMTs [298] The wreck is located on a Mokpo dock at 34°45'30.69\"N 126°21'3.30\"E.\n\n\nSee

{"title": "George_H._W._Bush", "content": "\nEarly life and education (1924–1948)\nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush was born on June 12, 1924, in Milton, Massachusetts [4] He was the second son of Prescott Bush and Dorothy (Walker) Bush, [5] and a younger brother of Prescott Bush Jr His paternal grandfather, Samuel P Bush, worked as an executive for a railroad parts company in Columbus, Ohio, [6] while his maternal grandfather and namesake, George Herbert Walker, led Wall Street investment bank W A Harriman & Co [7] Walker was known as \"Pop\", and young Bush was called \"Poppy\" as a tribute to him [8]\n\n\nWorld War II\nOn his 18th birthday, immediately after graduating from Phillips Academy, he enlisted in the United States Navy as a naval aviator [15] After a period of training, he was commissioned as an ensign in the Naval Reserve at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi on June 9, 1943, becoming one of the youngest pilots in the Navy [16] [c] Beginning in 1944, Bush served in the Pacific theater, where he flew a Grumman TBM Avenger, a torpedo bomber capable of taking off from aircraft carriers [21] His squadron was assigned to the USS San Jacinto as a member of Air Group 51, where his lanky physique earned him the nickname \"Skin\" [22]\n\n\nMarriage\nBush met Barbara Pierce at a Christmas dance in Greenwich in December 1941, [31] and, after a period of courtship, they became engaged in December 1943 [32] While Bush was on leave from the Navy, they married in Rye, New York, on January 6, 1945 [33] The Bushes enjoyed a strong marriage, and Barbara would later be a popular First Lady, seen by many as \"a kind of national grandmother\" [34] [e] They had six children: George W (b 1946), Robin (1949–1953), Jeb (b 1953), Neil (b 1955), Marvin (b 1956), and Doro (b 1959) [15] Their oldest daughter, Robin, died of leukemia in 1953 [37] [38]\n\n\nCollege years\nBush enrolled at Yale College, where he took part in an accelerated program that enabled him to graduate in two and a half years rather than the usual four [15] He was a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity and was elected its president [39] He also captained the Yale baseball team and played in the first two College World Series as a left-handed first baseman [40] Like his father, he was a member of the Yale cheerleading squad [41] and was initiated into the Skull and Bones secret society He graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1948 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics [42]\n\n\nBusiness career (1948–1963)\nAfter graduating from Yale, Bush moved his young family to West Texas Biographer Jon Meacham writes that Bush's relocation to Texas allowed him to move out of the \"daily shadow of his Wall Street father and Grandfather Walker, two dominant figures in the financial world,\" but would still allow Bush to \"call on their connections if he needed to raise capital.\" [43] His first position in Texas was an oil field equipment salesman [44] for Dresser Industries, which was led by family friend Neil Mallon [45] While working for Dresser, Bush lived in various places with his family: Odessa, Texas; Ventura, Bakersfield and Compton, California; and Midland, Texas [46] In 1952, he volunteered for the successful presidential campaign of Republican candidate Dwight D Eisenhower That same year, his father won election to represent Connecticut in the United States Senate as a member of the Republican Party [47]\n\n\nEarly political career (1963–1971)\nBy the early 1960s, Bush was widely regarded as an appealing political candidate, and some leading Democrats attempted to convince Bush to become a Democrat He declined to leave the Republican Party, later citing his belief that the national Democratic Party favored \"big, centralized government\" The Democratic Party had historically dominated Texas, but Republicans scored their first major victory in the state with John G Tower's victory in a 1961 special election to the United States Senate Motivated by Tower's victory and hoping to prevent the far-right John Birch Society from coming to power, Bush ran for the chairmanship of the Harris County Republican Party, winning election in February 1963 [55] Like most other Texas Republicans, Bush supported conservative Senator Barry Goldwater over the more centrist Nelson Rockefeller in the 1964 Republican Party presidential primaries [56]\n\n\nEntry into politics\nBy the early 1960s, Bush was widely regarded as an appealing political candidate, and some leading Democrats attempted to convince Bush to become a Democrat He declined to leave the Republican Party, later citing his belief that the national Democratic Party favored \"big, centralized government\" The Democratic Party had historically dominated Texas, but Republicans scored their first major victory in the state with John G Tower's victory in a 1961 special election to the United States Senate Motivated by Tower's victory and hoping to prevent the far-right John Birch Society from coming to power, Bush ran for the chairmanship of the Harris County Republican Party, winning election in February 1963 [55] Like most other Texas Republicans, Bush supported conservative Senator Barry Goldwater over the more centrist Nelson Rockefeller in the 1964 Republican Party presidential primaries [56]\n\n\nU.S. House of Representatives\nIn 1966, Bush ran for the United States House of Representatives in Texas's 7th congressional district, a newly redistricted seat in the Greater Houston area Initial polling showed him trailing his Democratic opponent, Harris County District Attorney Frank Briscoe, but he ultimately won the race with 57 percent of the vote [60] To woo potential candidates in the South and Southwest, House Republicans secured Bush an appointment to the powerful United States House Committee on Ways and Means, making Bush the first freshman to serve on the committee since 1904 [61] His voting record in the House was generally conservative He supported the Nixon administration's Vietnam policies but broke with Republicans on the issue of birth control, which he supported He also voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1968, although it was generally unpopular in his district [62] [63] [64] [65] In 1968, Bush joined several other Republicans in issuing the party's Response to the State of the Union address; Bush's part of the address focused on a call for fiscal responsibility [66]\n\n\nNixon and Ford administrations (1971–1977)\nAfter the 1970 Senate election, Bush accepted a position as a senior adviser to the president, but he convinced Nixon to instead appoint him as the U.S Ambassador to the United Nations [70] The position represented Bush's first foray into foreign policy, as well as his first major experiences with the Soviet Union and China, the two major U.S rivals in the Cold War [71] During Bush's tenure, the Nixon administration pursued a policy of détente, seeking to ease tensions with both the Soviet Union and China [72] Bush's ambassadorship was marked by a defeat on the China question, as the United Nations General Assembly voted, in Resolution 2758, to expel the Republic of China and replace it with the People's Republic of China in October 1971 [73] In the 1971 crisis in Pakistan, Bush supported an Indian motion at the UN General Assembly to condemn the Pakistani government of Yahya Khan for waging genocide in East Pakistan (modern Bangladesh), referring to the \"tradition which we have supported that the human rights question transcended domestic jurisdiction and should be freely debated\" [74] Bush's support for India at the UN put him into conflict with Nixon who was supporting Pakistan, partly because Yahya Khan was a useful intermediary in his attempts to reach out to China and partly because the president was fond of Yahya Khan [75] In 1972, during a controversy over whether the United States was intentionally bombing civilian hydrological infrastructure in Vietnam, Bush was sent by Nixon to convince Kurt Waldheim of the United States' position Bush, who was himself a fighter pilot in the Second World War, was \"unwilling to press his assigned case that the dikes had been spared,\" and told reporters \"I think that the best thing I can do on the subject is shut up.\" [76]\n\n\nAmbassador to the United Nations\nAfter the 1970 Senate election, Bush accepted a position as a senior adviser to the president, but he convinced Nixon to instead appoint him as the U.S Ambassador to the United Nations [70] The position represented Bush's first foray into foreign policy, as well as his first major experiences with the Soviet Union and China, the two major U.S rivals in the Cold War [71] During Bush's tenure, the Nixon administration pursued a policy of détente, seeking to ease tensions with both the Soviet Union and China [72] Bush's ambassadorship was marked by a defeat on the China question, as the United Nations General Assembly voted, in Resolution 2758, to expel the Republic of China and replace it with the People's Republic of China in October 1971 [73] In the 1971 crisis in Pakistan, Bush supported an Indian motion at the UN General Assembly to condemn the Pakistani government of Yahya Khan for waging genocide in East Pakistan (modern Bangladesh), referring to the \"tradition which we have supported that the human rights question transcended domestic jurisdiction and should be freely debated\" [74] Bush's support for India at the UN put him into conflict with Nixon who was supporting Pakistan, partly because Yahya Khan was a useful intermediary in his attempts to reach out to China and partly because the president was fond of Yahya Khan [75] In 1972, during a controversy over whether the United States was intentionally bombing civilian hydrological infrastructure in Vietnam, Bush was sent by Nixon to convince Kurt Waldheim of the United States' position Bush, who was himself a fighter pilot in the Second World War, was \"unwilling to press his assigned case that the dikes had been spared,\" and told reporters \"I think that the best thing I can do on the subject is shut up.\" [76]\n\n\nChairman of the Republican National Committee\nAfter Nixon won a landslide victory in the 1972 presidential election, he appointed Bush as chair of the Republican National Committee (RNC) [77] [78] In that position, he was charged with fundraising, candidate recruitment, and making appearances on behalf of the party in the media.\n\n\nHead of U.S. Liaison Office in China\nUpon his ascension to the presidency, Ford strongly considered Bush, Donald Rumsfeld, and Nelson Rockefeller for the vacant position of vice president Ford ultimately chose Nelson Rockefeller, partly because of the publication of a news report claiming that Bush's 1970 campaign had benefited from a secret fund set up by Nixon; Bush was later cleared of any suspicion by a special prosecutor [84] Bush accepted appointment as Chief of the U.S Liaison Office in the People's Republic of China, making him the de facto ambassador to China [85] According to biographer Jon Meacham, Bush's time in China convinced him that American engagement abroad was needed to ensure global stability and that the United States \"needed to be visible but not pushy, muscular but not domineering.\" [86]\n\n\nDirector of Central Intelligence\nIn January 1976, Ford brought Bush back to Washington to become the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI), placing him in charge of the CIA [87] In the aftermath of the Watergate scandal and the Vietnam War, the CIA's reputation had been damaged for its role in various covert operations Bush was tasked with restoring the agency's morale and public reputation [88] [f] During Bush's year in charge of the CIA, the U.S national security apparatus actively supported Operation Condor operations and right-wing military dictatorships in Latin America [89] [90]\n\n\n1980 presidential election\nBush's tenure at the CIA ended after Carter narrowly defeated Ford in the 1976 presidential election Out of public office for the first time since the 1960s, Bush became chairman on the executive committee of the First International Bank in Houston [93] He also spent a year as a part-time professor of Administrative Science at Rice University's Jones School of Business, [94] continued his membership in the Council on Foreign Relations, and joined the Trilateral Commission Meanwhile, he began to lay the groundwork for his candidacy in the 1980 Republican Party presidential primaries [95] In the 1980 Republican primary campaign, Bush faced Ronald Reagan, who was widely regarded as the front-runner, as well as other contenders like Senator Bob Dole, Senator Howard Baker, Texas Governor John Connally, Congressman Phil Crane, and Congressman John B Anderson [96]\n\n\nPresidential campaign\nBush's tenure at the CIA ended after Carter narrowly defeated Ford in the 1976 presidential election Out of public office for the first time since the 1960s, Bush became chairman on the executive committee of the First International Bank in Houston [93] He also spent a year as a part-time professor of Administrative Science at Rice University's Jones School of Business, [94] continued his membership in the Council on Foreign Relations, and joined the Trilateral Commission Meanwhile, he began to lay the groundwork for his candidacy in the 1980 Republican Party presidential primaries [95] In the 1980 Republican primary campaign, Bush faced Ronald Reagan, who was widely regarded as the front-runner, as well as other contenders like Senator Bob Dole, Senator Howard Baker, Texas Governor John Connally, Congressman Phil Crane, and Congressman John B Anderson [96]\n\n\nVice presidential campaign\nAfter Reagan clinched a majority of delegates in late May, Bush reluctantly dropped out of the race [107] At the 1980 Republican National Convention, Reagan made the last-minute decision to select Bush as his vice presidential nominee after negotiations with Ford regarding a Reagan–Ford ticket collapsed [108] Though Reagan had resented many of the Bush campaign's attacks during the primary campaign, and several conservative leaders had actively opposed Bush's nomination, Reagan ultimately decided that Bush's popularity with moderate Republicans made him the best and safest pick Bush, who had believed his political career might be over following the primaries, eagerly accepted the position and threw himself into campaigning for the Reagan–Bush ticket [109] The 1980 general election campaign between Reagan and Carter was conducted amid a multitude of domestic concerns and the ongoing Iran hostage crisis, and Reagan sought to focus the race on Carter's handling of the economy [110] Though the race was widely regarded as a close contest for most of the campaign, Reagan ultimately won over the large majority of undecided voters [111] Reagan took 50.7 percent of the popular vote and 489 of the 538 electoral votes, while Carter won 41% of the popular vote and John Anderson, running as an independent candidate, won 6.6% of the popular vote [112]\n\n\nVice presidency (1981–1989)\nAs vice president, Bush generally maintained a low profile, recognizing the constitutional limits of the office; he avoided decision-making or criticizing Reagan in any way This approach helped him earn Reagan's trust, easing tensions left over from their earlier rivalry [101] Bush also generally enjoyed a good relationship with Reagan staffers, including Bush's close friend James Baker, who served as Reagan's initial chief of staff [113] His understanding of the vice presidency was heavily influenced by Vice President Walter Mondale, who enjoyed a strong relationship with Carter in part because of his ability to avoid confrontations with senior staff and Cabinet members, and by Vice President Nelson Rockefeller's difficult relationship with some members of the White House staff during the Ford administration [114] The Bushes attended a large number of public and ceremonial events in their positions, including many state funerals, which became a common joke for comedians As the president of the Senate, Bush also stayed in contact with members of Congress and kept the president informed on occurrences on Capitol Hill [101]\n\n\nFirst term\nOn March 30, 1981, while Bush was in Texas, Reagan was shot and seriously wounded by John Hinckley Jr Bush immediately flew back to Washington D.C.; when his plane landed, his aides advised him to proceed directly to the White House by helicopter to show that the government was still functioning [101] Bush rejected the idea, fearing that such a dramatic scene risked giving the impression that he sought to usurp Reagan's powers and prerogatives [115] During Reagan's short period of incapacity, Bush presided over Cabinet meetings, met with congressional and foreign leaders, and briefed reporters Still, he consistently rejected invoking the Twenty-fifth Amendment [116] Bush's handling of the attempted assassination and its aftermath made a positive impression on Reagan, who recovered and returned to work within two weeks of the shooting From then on, the two men would have regular Thursday lunches in the Oval Office [117]\n\n\nSecond term\nMikhail Gorbachev came to power in the Soviet Union in 1985 Rejecting the ideological rigidity of his three elderly sick predecessors, Gorbachev insisted on urgently needed economic and political reforms called \"glasnost\" (openness) and \"perestroika\" (restructuring) [125] At the 1987 Washington Summit, Gorbachev and Reagan signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which committed both signatories to the total abolition of their respective short-range and medium-range missile stockpiles [126] The treaty began a new era of trade, openness, and cooperation between the two powers [127] President Reagan and Secretary of State George Shultz took the lead in these negotiations, but Bush sat in on many meetings Bush did not agree with many of the Reagan policies, but he did tell Gorbachev that he would seek to continue improving relations if he succeeded Reagan [128] On July 13, 1985, Bush became the first vice president to serve as acting president when Reagan underwent surgery to remove polyps from his colon; Bush served as the acting president for approximately eight hours [129]\n\n\n1988 presidential election\nBush began planning for a presidential run after the 1984 election, and he officially entered the 1988 Republican Party presidential primaries in October 1987 [101] He put together a campaign led by Reagan staffer Lee Atwater, which also included his son, George W Bush, and media consultant Roger Ailes [137] Though he had moved to the right during his time as vice president, endorsing a Human Life Amendment and repudiating his earlier comments on \"voodoo economics\", Bush still faced opposition from many conservatives in the Republican Party [138] His major rivals for the Republican nomination were Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, Representative Jack Kemp of New York, and Christian televangelist Pat Robertson [139] Reagan did not publicly endorse any candidate but privately expressed support for Bush [140]\n\n\nPresidency (1989–1993)\nBush was inaugurated on January 20, 1989, succeeding Reagan In his inaugural address, Bush said:\n\n\nForeign affairs\nDuring the first year of his tenure, Bush paused Reagan's détente policy toward the Soviet Union [162] Bush and his advisers were initially divided on Gorbachev; some administration officials saw him as a democratic reformer, but others suspected him of trying to make the minimum changes necessary to restore the Soviet Union to a competitive position with the United States [163] In 1989, all the Communist governments collapsed in Eastern Europe Gorbachev declined to send in the Soviet military, effectively abandoning the Brezhnev Doctrine The U.S was not directly involved in these upheavals, but the Bush administration avoided gloating over the demise of the Eastern Bloc to avoid undermining further democratic reforms [164]\n\n\nEnd of the Cold War\nDuring the first year of his tenure, Bush paused Reagan's détente policy toward the Soviet Union [162] Bush and his advisers were initially divided on Gorbachev; some administration officials saw him as a democratic reformer, but others suspected him of trying to make the minimum changes necessary to restore the Soviet Union to a competitive position with the United States [163] In 1989, all the Communist governments collapsed in Eastern Europe Gorbachev declined to send in the Soviet military, effectively abandoning the Brezhnev Doctrine The U.S was not directly involved in these upheavals, but the Bush administration avoided gloating over the demise of the Eastern Bloc to avoid undermining further democratic reforms [164]\n\n\nInvasion of Panama\nThrough the late 1980s, the U.S provided aid to Manuel Noriega, the anti-Communist leader of Panama Noriega had long-standing ties to United States intelligence agencies, including during Bush's tenure as Director of Central Intelligence, and was also deeply involved in drug trafficking [178] In May 1989, Noriega annulled the results of a democratic presidential election in which Guillermo Endara had been elected Bush objected to the annulment of the election and worried about the status of the Panama Canal with Noriega still in office [179] Bush dispatched 2,000 soldiers to the country, where they began conducting regular military exercises violating prior treaties [180] After Panamanian forces shot a U.S serviceman in December 1989, Bush ordered the United States invasion of Panama, known as \"Operation Just Cause\" The invasion was the first large-scale American military operation unrelated to the Cold War in more than 40 years American forces quickly took control of the Panama Canal Zone and Panama City Noriega surrendered on January 3, 1990, and was quickly transported to a prison in the United States Twenty-three Americans died in the operation, while another 394 were wounded Noriega was convicted and imprisoned on racketeering and drug trafficking charges in April 1992 [179] Historian Stewart Brewer argues that the invasion \"represented a new era in American foreign policy\" because Bush did not justify the invasion under the Monroe Doctrine or the threat of Communism, but rather because it was in the best interests of the United States [181]\n\n\nGulf War\nFaced with massive debts and low oil prices in the aftermath of the Iran–Iraq War, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein decided to conquer the country of Kuwait, a small, oil-rich country situated on Iraq's southern border [182] After Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, Bush imposed economic sanctions on Iraq and assembled a multi-national coalition opposed to the invasion [183] Some in the administration feared that a failure to respond to the invasion would embolden Hussein to attack Saudi Arabia or Israel [184] Robert Gates attempted to convince Brent Scowcroft that Bush should tone down the rhetoric but Bush insisted it was his primary concern to discourage other countries from \"unanswered aggression\" [185] Bush also wanted to ensure continued access to oil, as Iraq and Kuwait collectively accounted for 20 percent of the world's oil production, and Saudi Arabia produced another 26 percent of the world's oil supply [186]\n\n\nNAFTA\nIn 1987, the U.S and Canada reached a free trade agreement that eliminated many tariffs between the two countries President Reagan had intended it as the first step towards a larger trade agreement to eliminate most tariffs among the United States, Canada, and Mexico [196] The Bush administration, along with the Progressive Conservative Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney, spearheaded the negotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Mexico In addition to lowering tariffs, the proposed treaty would affect patents, copyrights, and trademarks [197] In 1991, Bush sought fast track authority, which grants the president the power to submit an international trade agreement to Congress without the possibility of amendment Despite congressional opposition led by House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt, both houses of Congress voted to grant Bush fast track authority NAFTA was signed in December 1992, after Bush lost reelection, [198] but President Clinton won ratification of NAFTA in 1993 [199] NAFTA was controversial for its impact on wages, jobs, and overall economic growth [200] In 2020, it was replaced entirely by the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA).\n\n\nDomestic affairs\nThe U.S economy had generally performed well since emerging from recession in late 1982, but it slipped into a mild recession in 1990 The unemployment rate rose from 5.9 percent in 1989 to a high of 7.8 percent in mid-1991 [201] [202] Large federal deficits, spawned during the Reagan years, rose from $152.1 billion in 1989 [203] to $220 billion for 1990; [204] the $220 billion deficit represented a threefold increase since 1980 [205] As the public became increasingly concerned about the economy and other domestic affairs, Bush's well-received handling of foreign affairs became less of an issue for most voters [206] Bush's top domestic priority was to end federal budget deficits, which he saw as a liability for the country's long-term economic health and standing in the world [207] As he was opposed to major defense spending cuts [208] and had pledged not to raise taxes, the president had major difficulties in balancing the budget [209]\n\n\nEconomy and fiscal issues\nThe U.S economy had generally performed well since emerging from recession in late 1982, but it slipped into a mild recession in 1990 The unemployment rate rose from 5.9 percent in 1989 to a high of 7.8 percent in mid-1991 [201] [202] Large federal deficits, spawned during the Reagan years, rose from $152.1 billion in 1989 [203] to $220 billion for 1990;

43 Republicans and 9 Democrats voted to confirm Thomas's nomination, while 46 Democrats and 2 Republicans voted against confirmation [235] Thomas became one of the most conservative justices of his era [236]\n\n\nOther issues\nBush's education platform consisted mainly of offering federal support for a variety of innovations, such as open enrollment, incentive pay for outstanding teachers, and rewards for schools that improve performance with underprivileged children [237] Though Bush did not pass a major educational reform package during his presidency, his ideas influenced later reform efforts, including Goals 2000 and the No Child Left Behind Act [238] Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990, [239] which led to a 40 percent increase in legal immigration to the United States [240] The act more than doubled the number of visas given to immigrants on the basis of job skills [241] In the wake of the savings and loan crisis, Bush proposed a $50 billion package to rescue the savings and loans industry, and also proposed the creation of the Office of Thrift Supervision to regulate the industry Congress passed the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, which incorporated most of Bush's proposals [242]\n\n\nPublic image\nBush was widely seen as a \"pragmatic caretaker\" president who lacked a unified and compelling long-term theme in his efforts [243] [244] [245] A Bush sound bite, referring to the issue of overarching purpose as \"the vision thing\", has become a metonym applied to other political figures accused of similar difficulties [246] [247] [248] [249] [250] [251] His ability to gain broad international support for the Gulf War and the war's result were seen as both a diplomatic and military triumph, [252] rousing bipartisan approval, [253] though his decision to withdraw without removing Saddam Hussein left mixed feelings, and attention returned to the domestic front and a souring economy [254] A New York Times article mistakenly depicted Bush as being surprised to see a supermarket barcode reader; [255] [256] the report of his reaction exacerbated the notion that he was \"out of touch\" [255]\n\n\n1992 presidential campaign\nBush announced his reelection bid in early 1992; with a coalition victory in the Persian Gulf War and high approval ratings, Bush's reelection initially looked likely [262] As a result, many leading Democrats, including Mario Cuomo, Dick Gephardt, and Al Gore, declined to seek their party's presidential nomination [263] However, Bush's tax increase angered many conservatives, who believed that Bush had strayed from the conservative principles of Ronald Reagan [264] He faced a challenge from conservative political columnist Pat Buchanan in the 1992 Republican primaries [265] Bush fended off Buchanan's challenge and won his party's nomination at the 1992 Republican National Convention Still, the convention adopted a socially conservative platform strongly influenced by the Christian right [266]\n\n\nPost-presidency (1993–2018)\nAfter leaving office, Bush and his wife built a retirement house in the community of West Oaks, Houston [283] He established a presidential office within the Park Laureate Building on Memorial Drive in Houston [284] He also frequently spent time at his vacation home in Kennebunkport, took annual cruises in Greece, went on fishing trips in Florida, and visited the Bohemian Club in Northern California He declined to serve on corporate boards but delivered numerous paid speeches and was an adviser to The Carlyle Group, a private equity firm [285] He never published his memoirs, but he and Brent Scowcroft co-wrote A World Transformed, a 1998 work on foreign policy Portions of his letters and his diary were later published as The China Diary of George H. W Bush and All the Best, George Bush [286]\n\n\nAppearances\nAfter leaving office, Bush and his wife built a retirement house in the community of West Oaks, Houston [283] He established a presidential office within the Park Laureate Building on Memorial Drive in Houston [284] He also frequently spent time at his vacation home in Kennebunkport, took annual cruises in Greece, went on fishing trips in Florida, and visited the Bohemian Club in Northern California He declined to serve on corporate boards but delivered numerous paid speeches and was an adviser to The Carlyle Group, a private equity firm [285] He never published his memoirs, but he and Brent Scowcroft co-wrote A World Transformed, a 1998 work on foreign policy Portions of his letters and his diary were later published as The China Diary of George H. W Bush and All the Best, George Bush [286]\n\n\nFinal years\nBush supported Republican John McCain in the 2008 presidential election, [301] and Republican Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election, [302] but both were defeated by Democrat Barack Obama In 2011, Obama awarded Bush with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States [303]\n\n\nDeath and funeral\nAfter a long battle with vascular Parkinson's disease, Bush died at his home in Houston on November 30, 2018, at the age of 94 [316] [317] At the time of his death he was the longest-lived U.S president, [318] a distinction now held by Jimmy Carter [319] He was also the third-oldest vice president [h] Bush lay in state in the Rotunda of the U.S Capitol from December 3 through December 5; he was the 12th U.S president to be accorded this honor [321] [322] Then, on December 5, Bush's casket was transferred from the Capitol rotunda to Washington National Cathedral where a state funeral was held [323] After the funeral, Bush's body was transported to George H.W Bush Presidential Library in College Station, Texas, where he was buried next to his wife Barbara and daughter Robin [324] At the funeral, former president George W Bush eulogized his father saying,\n\"He looked for the good in each person, and he usually found it.\" [323]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn May 1991, The New York Times revealed that Bush had developed Graves' disease, a non-contagious thyroid condition that his wife Barbara also had [325] Bush had two separate hip replacement surgeries in 2000 and 2007 [326] Thereafter, Bush started to experience weakness in his legs, which was attributed to vascular parkinsonism, a form of Parkinson's disease He progressively developed problems walking, initially needing a walking stick for mobility aid before he eventually came to rely on a wheelchair from 2011 onwards [327]\n\n\nLegacy\nDefunct\n\n\nHistorical reputation\nDefunct\n\n\nMemorials, awards, and honors\nIn 1990, Time magazine named him the Man of the Year [352] In 1997, the Houston Intercontinental Airport was renamed as the George Bush Intercontinental Airport [353] In 1999, the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, was named the George Bush Center for Intelligence in his honor [354] In 2011, Bush, an avid golfer, was inducted in the World Golf Hall of Fame [355] The USS George H.W Bush (CVN-77), the tenth and last Nimitz-class supercarrier of the United States Navy, was named for Bush [356] [357] Bush is commemorated on a postage stamp that was issued by the United States Postal Service in 2019 [358] In December 2020, the United States Mint honored Bush with a Presidential Dollar coin.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nSecondary sources\n\n\nPrimary sources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**George H. W. Bush**\n\nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush was the 41st President of the United States, serving from 1989 to 1993. He was a member of the Republican Party and is known for his diplomatic and international relations expertise.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nGeorge H. W. Bush was born on June 12, 1924, in Milton, Massachusetts. He was the second son of Prescott Bush and Dorothy (Walker) Bush, and a younger brother of Prescott Bush Jr. His paternal grandfather, Samuel P Bush, worked as an executive for a railroad parts company in Columbus, Ohio, while his maternal grandfather and namesake, George Herbert Walker, led Wall Street investment bank W. A. Harriman & Co. Walker was known as \"Pop,\" and young Bush was called \"Poppy\" as a tribute to him.\n\n**World War II**\n\nOn his 18th birthday, immediately after graduating from Phillips Academy, he enlisted in the United States Navy as a naval aviator. After a period of training, he was commissioned as an ensign in the Naval Reserve at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi on June 9, 1943, becoming one of the youngest pilots in the Navy. He served in the Pacific theater, where he flew a Grumman TBM Avenger, a torpedo bomber capable of taking off from aircraft carriers. His squadron was assigned to the USS San Jacinto as a member of Air Group 51, where his lanky physique earned him the nickname \"Skin.\"\n\n**Marriage**\n\nBush met Barbara Pierce at a Christmas dance in Greenwich in December 1941, and, after a period of courtship, they became engaged in December 1943. While Bush was on leave from the Navy, they married in Rye, New York, on January 6, 1945. The Bushes enjoyed a strong marriage, and Barbara would later be a popular First Lady, seen by many as \"a kind of national grandmother.\" They had six children: George W (b 1946), Robin (1949–1953), Jeb (b 1953), Neil (b 1955), Marvin (b 1956), and Doro (b 1959). Their oldest daughter, Robin, died of leukemia in 1953.\n\n**College Years**\n\nBush enrolled at Yale College, where he took part in an accelerated program that enabled him to graduate in two and a half years rather than the usual four. He was a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity and was elected its president. He also captained the Yale baseball team and played in the first two College World Series as a left-handed first baseman. Like his father, he was a member of the Yale cheerleading squad and was initiated into the Skull and Bones secret society. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1948 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics.\n\n**Business Career**\n\nAfter graduating from Yale, Bush moved his young family to West Texas. Biographer Jon Meacham writes that Bush's relocation to Texas allowed him to move out of the \"daily shadow of his Wall Street father and Grandfather Walker, two dominant figures in the financial world,\" but would still allow Bush to \"call on their connections if he needed to raise capital.\" His first position in Texas was an oil field equipment salesman for Dresser Industries, which was led by family friend Neil Mallon. While working for Dresser, Bush lived in various places with his family: Odessa, Texas; Ventura, Bakersfield, and Compton, California; and Midland, Texas. In 1952, he volunteered for the successful presidential campaign of Republican candidate Dwight D Eisenhower. That same year, his father won election to represent Connecticut in the United States Senate as a member of the Republican Party.\n\n**Early Political Career**\n\nBy the early 1960s, Bush was widely regarded as an appealing political candidate, and some leading Democrats attempted to convince Bush to become a Democrat. He declined to leave the Republican Party, later citing his belief that the national Democratic Party favored \"big, centralized government.\" The Democratic Party had historically dominated Texas, but Republicans scored their first major victory in the state with John G Tower's victory in a 1961 special election to the United States Senate. Motivated by Tower's victory and hoping to prevent the far-right John Birch Society from coming to power, Bush ran for the chairmanship of the Harris County Republican Party, winning election in February 1963.\n\n**U.S. House of Representatives**\n\nIn 1966, Bush ran for the United States House of Representatives in Texas's 7th congressional district, a newly redistricted seat in the Greater Houston area. Initial polling showed him trailing his Democratic opponent, Harris County District Attorney Frank Briscoe, but he ultimately won the race with 57 percent of the vote. To woo potential candidates in the South and Southwest, House Republicans secured Bush an appointment to the powerful United States House Committee on Ways and Means, making Bush the first freshman to serve on the committee since 1904. His voting record in the House was generally conservative. He supported the Nixon administration's Vietnam policies but broke with Republicans on the issue of birth control, which he supported. He also voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1968, although it was generally unpopular in his district.\n\n**Nixon and Ford Administrations**\n\nAfter the 1970 Senate election, Bush accepted a position as a senior adviser to the president, but he convinced Nixon to instead appoint him as the U.S Ambassador to the United Nations. The position represented Bush's first foray into foreign policy, as well as his first major experiences with the Soviet Union and China, the two major U.S rivals in the Cold War. During Bush's tenure, the Nixon administration pursued a policy of détente, seeking to ease tensions with both the Soviet Union and China. Bush's ambassadorship was marked by a defeat on the China question, as the United Nations General Assembly voted, in Resolution 2758, to expel the Republic of China and replace it with the People's Republic of China in October 1971. In the 1971 crisis in Pakistan, Bush supported an Indian motion at the UN General Assembly to condemn the Pakistani government of Yahya Khan for waging genocide in East Pakistan (modern Bangladesh), referring to the \"tradition which we have supported that the human rights question transcended domestic jurisdiction and should be freely debated.\" Bush's support for India at the UN put him into conflict with Nixon who was supporting Pakistan, partly because Yahya Khan was a useful intermediary in his attempts to reach out to China and partly because the president was fond of Yahya Khan. In 1972, during a controversy over whether the United States was intentionally bombing civilian hydrological infrastructure in Vietnam, Bush was sent by Nixon to convince Kurt Waldheim of the United States' position. Bush, who was himself a fighter pilot in the Second World War, was \"unwilling to press his assigned case that the dikes had been spared,\" and told reporters \"I think that the best thing I can do on the subject is shut up.\"\n\n**Chairman of the Republican National Committee**\n\nAfter Nixon won a landslide victory in the 1972 presidential election, he appointed Bush as chair of the Republican National Committee (RNC). In that position, he was charged with fundraising, candidate recruitment, and making appearances on behalf of the party in the media. In 1974, Bush was appointed to the U.S Liaison Office in the People's Republic of China, making him the de facto ambassador to China. According to biographer Jon Meacham, Bush's time in China convinced him that American engagement abroad was needed to ensure global stability and that the United States \"needed to be visible but not pushy, muscular but not domineering.\"\n\n**Director of Central Intelligence**\n\nIn January 1976, Ford brought Bush back to Washington to become the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI), placing him in charge of the CIA. In the aftermath of the Watergate scandal and the Vietnam War, the CIA's reputation had been damaged for its role in various covert operations. Bush was tasked with restoring the agency's morale and public reputation. During Bush's year in charge of the CIA, the U.S national security apparatus actively supported Operation Condor operations and right-wing military dictatorships in Latin America.\n\n**1980 Presidential Election**\n\nBush began planning for a presidential run after the 1984 election, and he officially entered the 1988 Republican Party presidential primaries in October 1987. He put together a campaign led by Reagan staffer Lee Atwater, which also included his son, George W Bush, and media consultant Roger Ailes. Though he had moved to the right during his time as vice president, endorsing a Human Life Amendment and repudiating his earlier comments on \"voodoo economics,\" Bush still faced opposition from many conservatives in the Republican Party. His major rivals for the Republican nomination were Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, Representative Jack Kemp of New York, and Christian televangelist Pat Robertson. Reagan did not publicly endorse any candidate but privately expressed support for Bush.\n\n**Presidency**\n\nBush was inaugurated on January 20, 1989, succeeding Reagan. In his inaugural address, Bush said, \"I have spoken of a thousand points of light, of all the community organizations that are spread like stars throughout the Nation, doing good.\" During his presidency, Bush honored numerous volunteers with the Daily Point of Light Award, a tradition that his presidential successors continued. In 1990, the Points of Light Foundation was created as a nonprofit organization in Washington to promote this spirit of volunteerism. In 2007, the Points of Light Foundation merged with the Hands On Network to create a new organization, Points of Light.\n\n**Foreign Affairs**\n\nDuring the first year of his tenure, Bush paused Reagan's détente policy toward the Soviet Union. Bush and his advisers were initially divided on Gorbachev; some administration officials saw him as a democratic reformer, but others suspected him of trying to make the minimum changes necessary to restore the Soviet Union to a competitive position with the United States. In 1989, all the Communist governments collapsed in Eastern Europe Gorbachev declined to send in the Soviet military, effectively abandoning the Brezhnev Doctrine The U.S was not directly involved in these upheavals, but the Bush administration avoided gloating over the demise of the Eastern Bloc to avoid undermining further democratic reforms.\n\n**Invasion of Panama**\n\nThrough the late 1980s, the U.S provided aid to Manuel Noriega, the anti-Communist leader of Panama Noriega had long-standing ties to United States intelligence agencies, including during Bush's tenure as Director of Central Intelligence, and was also deeply involved in drug trafficking. In May 1989, Noriega annulled the results of a democratic presidential election in which Guillermo Endara had been elected Bush objected to the annulment of the election and worried about the status of the Panama Canal with Noriega still in office. Bush dispatched 2,000 soldiers to the country, where they began conducting regular military exercises violating prior treaties. After Panamanian forces shot a U.S serviceman in December 1989, Bush ordered the United States invasion of Panama, known as \"Operation Just Cause\" The invasion was the first large-scale American military operation unrelated to the Cold War in more than 40 years American forces quickly took control of the Panama Canal Zone and Panama City Noriega surrendered on January 3, 1990, and was quickly transported to a prison in the United States Twenty-three Americans died in the operation, while another 394 were wounded.\n\n**Gulf War**\n\nFaced with massive debts and low oil prices in the aftermath of the Iran–Iraq War, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein decided to conquer the country of Kuwait, a small, oil-rich country situated on Iraq's southern border. After Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, Bush imposed economic sanctions on Iraq and assembled a multi-national coalition opposed to the invasion. Some in the administration feared that a failure to respond to the invasion would embolden Hussein to attack Saudi Arabia or Israel. Robert Gates attempted to convince Brent Scowcroft that Bush should tone down the rhetoric but Bush insisted it was his primary concern to discourage other countries from \"unanswered aggression\" Bush also wanted to ensure continued access to oil, as Iraq and Kuwait collectively accounted for 20 percent of the world's oil production, and Saudi Arabia produced another 26 percent of the world's oil supply.\n\n**NAFTA**\n\nIn 1987, the U.S and Canada reached a free trade agreement that eliminated many tariffs between the two countries. President Reagan had intended it as the first step towards a larger trade agreement to eliminate most tariffs among the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The Bush administration, along with the Progressive Conservative Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney, spearheaded the negotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Mexico. In addition to lowering tariffs, the proposed treaty would affect patents, copyrights, and trademarks. In 1991, Bush sought fast track authority, which grants the president the power to submit an international trade agreement to Congress without the possibility of amendment. Despite congressional opposition led by House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt, both houses of Congress voted to grant Bush fast track authority. NAFTA was signed in December 1992, after Bush lost reelection.\n\n**Domestic Affairs**\n\nThe U.S economy had generally performed well since emerging from recession in late 1982, but it slipped into a mild recession in 1990. The unemployment rate rose from 5.9 percent in 1989 to a high of 7.8 percent in mid-1991. Large federal deficits, spawned during the Reagan years, rose from $152.1 billion in 1989 to $220 billion for 1990; the $220 billion deficit represented a threefold increase since 1980. As the public became increasingly concerned about the economy and other domestic affairs, Bush's well-received handling of foreign affairs became less of an issue for most voters. Bush's top domestic priority was to end federal budget deficits, which he saw as a liability for the country's long-term economic health and standing in the world. As he was opposed to major defense spending cuts and had pledged not to raise taxes, the president had major difficulties in balancing the budget.\n\n**Judicial Appointments**\n\nBush appointed two justices to the Supreme Court of the United States. In 1990, Bush appointed a largely unknown state appellate judge, David Souter, to replace liberal icon William J Brennan Jr. Souter was easily confirmed and served until 2009, but joined the liberal bloc of the court, disappointing Bush. In 1991, Bush nominated conservative federal judge Clarence Thomas to succeed Thurgood Marshall, a long-time liberal stalwart. Thomas, the former head of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), faced heavy opposition in the Senate, as well as from pro-choice groups and the NAACP. His nomination faced another difficulty when Anita Hill accused Thomas of having sexually harassed her during his time as the chair of EEOC. Thomas won confirmation in a narrow 52–48 vote; 43 Republicans and 9 Democrats voted to confirm Thomas's nomination, while 46 Democrats and 2 Republicans voted against confirmation.\n\n**Economy and Fiscal Issues**\n\nThe U.S economy had generally performed well since emerging from recession in late 1982, but it slipped into a mild recession in 1990. The unemployment rate rose from 5.9 percent in 1989 to a high of 7.8 percent in mid-1991. Large federal deficits, spawned during the Reagan years, rose from $152.1 billion in 1989 to $220 billion for 1990; the $220 billion deficit represented a threefold increase since 1980.\n\n**Discrimination**\n\nIn May 1991, The New York Times revealed that Bush had developed Graves' disease, a non-contagious thyroid condition that his wife Barbara also had. Bush had two separate hip replacement surgeries in 2000 and 2007. Thereafter, Bush started to experience weakness in his legs, which was attributed to vascular parkinsonism, a form of Parkinson's disease. He progressively developed problems walking, initially needing a walking stick for mobility aid before he eventually came to rely on a wheelchair from 2011 onwards.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nIn 1990, Time magazine named him the Man of the Year. In 1997, the Houston Intercontinental Airport was renamed as the George Bush Intercontinental Airport. In 1999, the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, was named the George Bush Center for Intelligence in his honor. In 2011, Bush, an avid golfer, was inducted in the World Golf Hall of Fame. The USS George H.W. Bush (CVN-77), the tenth and last Nimitz-class supercarrier of the United States Navy, was named for Bush. Bush is commemorated on a postage stamp that was issued by the United States Postal Service in 2019. In December 2020, the United States Mint honored Bush with a Presidential Dollar coin.\n\n**See also**\n\n* George H. W.

Ventura, Bakersfield and Compton, California; and Midland, Texas [46] In 1952, he volunteered for the successful presidential campaign of Republican candidate Dwight D Eisenhower That same year, his father won election to represent Connecticut in the United States Senate as a member of the Republican Party [47]\n\n\nEarly political career (1963–1971)\nBy the early 1960s, Bush was widely regarded as an appealing political candidate, and some leading Democrats attempted to convince Bush to become a Democrat He declined to leave the Republican Party, later citing his belief that the national Democratic Party favored \"big, centralized government\" The Democratic Party had historically dominated Texas, but Republicans scored their first major victory in the state with John G Tower's victory in a 1961 special election to the United States Senate Motivated by Tower's victory and hoping to prevent the far-right John Birch Society from coming to power, Bush ran for the chairmanship of the Harris County Republican Party, winning election in February 1963 [55] Like most other Texas Republicans, Bush supported conservative Senator Barry Goldwater over the more centrist Nelson Rockefeller in the 1964 Republican Party presidential primaries [56]\n\n\nEntry into politics\nBy the early 1960s, Bush was widely regarded as an appealing political candidate, and some leading Democrats attempted to convince Bush to become a Democrat He declined to leave the Republican Party, later citing his belief that the national Democratic Party favored \"big, centralized government\" The Democratic Party had historically dominated Texas, but Republicans scored their first major victory in the state with John G Tower's victory in a 1961 special election to the United States Senate Motivated by Tower's victory and hoping to prevent the far-right John Birch Society from coming to power, Bush ran for the chairmanship of the Harris County Republican Party, winning election in February 1963 [55] Like most other Texas Republicans, Bush supported conservative Senator Barry Goldwater over the more centrist Nelson Rockefeller in the 1964 Republican Party presidential primaries [56]\n\n\nU.S. House of Representatives\nIn 1966, Bush ran for the United States House of Representatives in Texas's 7th congressional district, a newly redistricted seat in the Greater Houston area Initial polling showed him trailing his Democratic opponent, Harris County District Attorney Frank Briscoe, but he ultimately won the race with 57 percent of the vote [60] To woo potential candidates in the South and Southwest, House Republicans secured Bush an appointment to the powerful United States House Committee on Ways and Means, making Bush the first freshman to serve on the committee since 1904 [61] His voting record in the House was generally conservative He supported the Nixon administration's Vietnam policies but broke with Republicans on the issue of birth control, which he supported He also voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1968, although it was generally unpopular in his district [62] [63] [64] [65] In 1968, Bush joined several other Republicans in issuing the party's Response to the State of the Union address; Bush's part of the address focused on a call for fiscal responsibility [66]\n\n\nNixon and Ford administrations (1971–1977)\nAfter the 1970 Senate election, Bush accepted a position as a senior adviser to the president, but he convinced Nixon to instead appoint him as the U.S Ambassador to the United Nations [70] The position represented Bush's first foray into foreign policy, as well as his first major experiences with the Soviet Union and China, the two major U.S rivals in the Cold War [71] During Bush's tenure, the Nixon administration pursued a policy of détente, seeking to ease tensions with both the Soviet Union and China [72] Bush's ambassadorship was marked by a defeat on the China question, as the United Nations General Assembly voted, in Resolution 2758, to expel the Republic of China and replace it with the People's Republic of China in October 1971 [73] In the 1971 crisis in Pakistan, Bush supported an Indian motion at the UN General Assembly to condemn the Pakistani government of Yahya Khan for waging genocide in East Pakistan (modern Bangladesh), referring to the \"tradition which we have supported that the human rights question transcended domestic jurisdiction and should be freely debated\" [74] Bush's support for India at the UN put him into conflict with Nixon who was supporting Pakistan, partly because Yahya Khan was a useful intermediary in his attempts to reach out to China and partly because the president was fond of Yahya Khan [75] In 1972, during a controversy over whether the United States was intentionally bombing civilian hydrological infrastructure in Vietnam, Bush was sent by Nixon to convince Kurt Waldheim of the United States' position Bush, who was himself a fighter pilot in the Second World War, was \"unwilling to press his assigned case that the dikes had been spared,\" and told reporters \"I think that the best thing I can do on the subject is shut up.\" [76]\n\n\nAmbassador to the United Nations\nAfter the 1970 Senate election, Bush accepted a position as a senior adviser to the president, but he convinced Nixon to instead appoint him as the U.S Ambassador to the United Nations [70] The position represented Bush's first foray into foreign policy, as well as his first major experiences with the Soviet Union and China, the two major U.S rivals in the Cold War [71] During Bush's tenure, the Nixon administration pursued a policy of détente, seeking to ease tensions with both the Soviet Union and China [72] Bush's ambassadorship was marked by a defeat on the China question, as the United Nations General Assembly voted, in Resolution 2758, to expel the Republic of China and replace it with the People's Republic of China in October 1971 [73] In the 1971 crisis in Pakistan, Bush supported an Indian motion at the UN General Assembly to condemn the Pakistani government of Yahya Khan for waging genocide in East Pakistan (modern Bangladesh), referring to the \"tradition which we have supported that the human rights question transcended domestic jurisdiction and should be freely debated\" [74] Bush's support for India at the UN put him into conflict with Nixon who was supporting Pakistan, partly because Yahya Khan was a useful intermediary in his attempts to reach out to China and partly because the president was fond of Yahya Khan [75] In 1972, during a controversy over whether the United States was intentionally bombing civilian hydrological infrastructure in Vietnam, Bush was sent by Nixon to convince Kurt Waldheim of the United States' position Bush, who was himself a fighter pilot in the Second World War, was \"unwilling to press his assigned case that the dikes had been spared,\" and told reporters \"I think that the best thing I can do on the subject is shut up.\" [76]\n\n\nChairman of the Republican National Committee\nAfter Nixon won a landslide victory in the 1972 presidential election, he appointed Bush as chair of the Republican National Committee (RNC) [77] [78] In that position, he was charged with fundraising, candidate recruitment, and making appearances on behalf of the party in the media.\n\n\nHead of U.S. Liaison Office in China\nUpon his ascension to the presidency, Ford strongly considered Bush, Donald Rumsfeld, and Nelson Rockefeller for the vacant position of vice president Ford ultimately chose Nelson Rockefeller, partly because of the publication of a news report claiming that Bush's 1970 campaign had benefited from a secret fund set up by Nixon; Bush was later cleared of any suspicion by a special prosecutor [84] Bush accepted appointment as Chief of the U.S Liaison Office in the People's Republic of China, making him the de facto ambassador to China [85] According to biographer Jon Meacham, Bush's time in China convinced him that American engagement abroad was needed to ensure global stability and that the United States \"needed to be visible but not pushy, muscular but not domineering.\" [86]\n\n\nDirector of Central Intelligence\nIn January 1976, Ford brought Bush back to Washington to become the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI), placing him in charge of the CIA [87] In the aftermath of the Watergate scandal and the Vietnam War, the CIA's reputation had been damaged for its role in various covert operations Bush was tasked with restoring the agency's morale and public reputation [88] [f] During Bush's year in charge of the CIA, the U.S national security apparatus actively supported Operation Condor operations and right-wing military dictatorships in Latin America [89] [90]\n\n\n1980 presidential election\nBush's tenure at the CIA ended after Carter narrowly defeated Ford in the 1976 presidential election Out of public office for the first time since the 1960s, Bush became chairman on the executive committee of the First International Bank in Houston [93] He also spent a year as a part-time professor of Administrative Science at Rice University's Jones School of Business, [94] continued his membership in the Council on Foreign Relations, and joined the Trilateral Commission Meanwhile, he began to lay the groundwork for his candidacy in the 1980 Republican Party presidential primaries [95] In the 1980 Republican primary campaign, Bush faced Ronald Reagan, who was widely regarded as the front-runner, as well as other contenders like Senator Bob Dole, Senator Howard Baker, Texas Governor John Connally, Congressman Phil Crane, and Congressman John B Anderson [96]\n\n\nPresidential campaign\nBush's tenure at the CIA ended after Carter narrowly defeated Ford in the 1976 presidential election Out of public office for the first time since the 1960s, Bush became chairman on the executive committee of the First International Bank in Houston [93] He also spent a year as a part-time professor of Administrative Science at Rice University's Jones School of Business, [94] continued his membership in the Council on Foreign Relations, and joined the Trilateral Commission Meanwhile, he began to lay the groundwork for his candidacy in the 1980 Republican Party presidential primaries [95] In the 1980 Republican primary campaign, Bush faced Ronald Reagan, who was widely regarded as the front-runner, as well as other contenders like Senator Bob Dole, Senator Howard Baker, Texas Governor John Connally, Congressman Phil Crane, and Congressman John B Anderson [96]\n\n\nVice presidential campaign\nAfter Reagan clinched a majority of delegates in late May, Bush reluctantly dropped out of the race [107] At the 1980 Republican National Convention, Reagan made the last-minute decision to select Bush as his vice presidential nominee after negotiations with Ford regarding a Reagan–Ford ticket collapsed [108] Though Reagan had resented many of the Bush campaign's attacks during the primary campaign, and several conservative leaders had actively opposed Bush's nomination, Reagan ultimately decided that Bush's popularity with moderate Republicans made him the best and safest pick Bush, who had believed his political career might be over following the primaries, eagerly accepted the position and threw himself into campaigning for the Reagan–Bush ticket [109] The 1980 general election campaign between Reagan and Carter was conducted amid a multitude of domestic concerns and the ongoing Iran hostage crisis, and Reagan sought to focus the race on Carter's handling of the economy [110] Though the race was widely regarded as a close contest for most of the campaign, Reagan ultimately won over the large majority of undecided voters [111] Reagan took 50.7 percent of the popular vote and 489 of the 538 electoral votes, while Carter won 41% of the popular vote and John Anderson, running as an independent candidate, won 6.6% of the popular vote [112]\n\n\nVice presidency (1981–1989)\nAs vice president, Bush generally maintained a low profile, recognizing the constitutional limits of the office; he avoided decision-making or criticizing Reagan in any way This approach helped him earn Reagan's trust, easing tensions left over from their earlier rivalry [101] Bush also generally enjoyed a good relationship with Reagan staffers, including Bush's close friend James Baker, who served as Reagan's initial chief of staff [113] His understanding of the vice presidency was heavily influenced by Vice President Walter Mondale, who enjoyed a strong relationship with Carter in part because of his ability to avoid confrontations with senior staff and Cabinet members, and by Vice President Nelson Rockefeller's difficult relationship with some members of the White House staff during the Ford administration [114] The Bushes attended a large number of public and ceremonial events in their positions, including many state funerals, which became a common joke for comedians As the president of the Senate, Bush also stayed in contact with members of Congress and kept the president informed on occurrences on Capitol Hill [101]\n\n\nFirst term\nOn March 30, 1981, while Bush was in Texas, Reagan was shot and seriously wounded by John Hinckley Jr Bush immediately flew back to Washington D.C.; when his plane landed, his aides advised him to proceed directly to the White House by helicopter to show that the government was still functioning [101] Bush rejected the idea, fearing that such a dramatic scene risked giving the impression that he sought to usurp Reagan's powers and prerogatives [115] During Reagan's short period of incapacity, Bush presided over Cabinet meetings, met with congressional and foreign leaders, and briefed reporters Still, he consistently rejected invoking the Twenty-fifth Amendment [116] Bush's handling of the attempted assassination and its aftermath made a positive impression on Reagan, who recovered and returned to work within two weeks of the shooting From then on, the two men would have regular Thursday lunches in the Oval Office [117]\n\n\nSecond term\nMikhail Gorbachev came to power in the Soviet Union in 1985 Rejecting the ideological rigidity of his three elderly sick predecessors, Gorbachev insisted on urgently needed economic and political reforms called \"glasnost\" (openness) and \"perestroika\" (restructuring) [125] At the 1987 Washington Summit, Gorbachev and Reagan signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which committed both signatories to the total abolition of their respective short-range and medium-range missile stockpiles [126] The treaty began a new era of trade, openness, and cooperation between the two powers [127] President Reagan and Secretary of State George Shultz took the lead in these negotiations, but Bush sat in on many meetings Bush did not agree with many of the Reagan policies, but he did tell Gorbachev that he would seek to continue improving relations if he succeeded Reagan [128] On July 13, 1985, Bush became the first vice president to serve as acting president when Reagan underwent surgery to remove polyps from his colon; Bush served as the acting president for approximately eight hours [129]\n\n\n1988 presidential election\nBush began planning for a presidential run after the 1984 election, and he officially entered the 1988 Republican Party presidential primaries in October 1987 [101] He put together a campaign led by Reagan staffer Lee Atwater, which also included his son, George W Bush, and media consultant Roger Ailes [137] Though he had moved to the right during his time as vice president, endorsing a Human Life Amendment and repudiating his earlier comments on \"voodoo economics\", Bush still faced opposition from many conservatives in the Republican Party [138] His major rivals for the Republican nomination were Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, Representative Jack Kemp of New York, and Christian televangelist Pat Robertson [139] Reagan did not publicly endorse any candidate but privately expressed support for Bush [140]\n\n\nPresidency (1989–1993)\nBush was inaugurated on January 20, 1989, succeeding Reagan In his inaugural address, Bush said:\n\n\nForeign affairs\nDuring the first year of his tenure, Bush paused Reagan's détente policy toward the Soviet Union [162] Bush and his advisers were initially divided on Gorbachev; some administration officials saw him as a democratic reformer, but others suspected him of trying to make the minimum changes necessary to restore the Soviet Union to a competitive position with the United States [163] In 1989, all the Communist governments collapsed in Eastern Europe Gorbachev declined to send in the Soviet military, effectively abandoning the Brezhnev Doctrine The U.S was not directly involved in these upheavals, but the Bush administration avoided gloating over the demise of the Eastern Bloc to avoid undermining further democratic reforms [164]\n\n\nEnd of the Cold War\nDuring the first year of his tenure, Bush paused Reagan's détente policy toward the Soviet Union [162] Bush and his advisers were initially divided on Gorbachev; some administration officials saw him as a democratic reformer, but others suspected him of trying to make the minimum changes necessary to restore the Soviet Union to a competitive position with the United States [163] In 1989, all the Communist governments collapsed in Eastern Europe Gorbachev declined to send in the Soviet military, effectively abandoning the Brezhnev Doctrine The U.S was not directly involved in these upheavals, but the Bush administration avoided gloating over the demise of the Eastern Bloc to avoid undermining further democratic reforms [164]\n\n\nInvasion of Panama\nThrough the late 1980s, the U.S provided aid to Manuel Noriega, the anti-Communist leader of Panama Noriega had long-standing ties to United States intelligence agencies, including during Bush's tenure as Director of Central Intelligence, and was also deeply involved in drug trafficking [178] In May 1989, Noriega annulled the results of a democratic presidential election in which Guillermo Endara had been elected Bush objected to the annulment of the election and worried about the status of the Panama Canal with Noriega still in office [179] Bush dispatched 2,000 soldiers to the country, where they began conducting regular military exercises violating prior treaties [180] After Panamanian forces shot a U.S serviceman in December 1989, Bush ordered the United States invasion of Panama, known as \"Operation Just Cause\" The invasion was the first large-scale American military operation unrelated to the Cold War in more than 40 years American forces quickly took control of the Panama Canal Zone and Panama City Noriega surrendered on January 3, 1990, and was quickly transported to a prison in the United States Twenty-three Americans died in the operation, while another 394 were wounded Noriega was convicted and imprisoned on racketeering and drug trafficking charges in April 1992 [179] Historian Stewart Brewer argues that the invasion \"represented a new era in American foreign policy\" because Bush did not justify the invasion under the Monroe Doctrine or the threat of Communism, but rather because it was in the best interests of the United States [181]\n\n\nGulf War\nFaced with massive debts and low oil prices in the aftermath of the Iran–Iraq War, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein decided to conquer the country of Kuwait, a small, oil-rich country situated on Iraq's southern border [182] After Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, Bush imposed economic sanctions on Iraq and assembled a multi-national coalition opposed to the invasion [183] Some in the administration feared that a failure to respond to the invasion would embolden Hussein to attack Saudi Arabia or Israel [184] Robert Gates attempted to convince Brent Scowcroft that Bush should tone down the rhetoric but Bush insisted it was his primary concern to discourage other countries from \"unanswered aggression\" [185] Bush also wanted to ensure continued access to oil, as Iraq and Kuwait collectively accounted for 20 percent of the world's oil production, and Saudi Arabia produced another 26 percent of the world's oil supply [186]\n\n\nNAFTA\nIn 1987, the U.S and Canada reached a free trade agreement that eliminated many tariffs between the two countries President Reagan had intended it as the first step towards a larger trade agreement to eliminate most tariffs among the United States, Canada, and Mexico [196] The Bush administration, along with the Progressive Conservative Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney, spearheaded the negotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Mexico In addition to lowering tariffs, the proposed treaty would affect patents, copyrights, and trademarks [197] In 1991, Bush sought fast track authority, which grants the president the power to submit an international trade agreement to Congress without the possibility of amendment Despite congressional opposition led by House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt, both houses of Congress voted to grant Bush fast track authority NAFTA was signed in December 1992, after Bush lost reelection, [198] but President Clinton won ratification of NAFTA in 1993 [199] NAFTA was controversial for its impact on wages, jobs, and overall economic growth [200] In 2020, it was replaced entirely by the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA).\n\n\nDomestic affairs\nThe U.S economy had generally performed well since emerging from recession in late 1982, but it slipped into a mild recession in 1990 The unemployment rate rose from 5.9 percent in 1989 to a high of 7.8 percent in mid-1991 [201] [202] Large federal deficits, spawned during the Reagan years, rose from $152.1 billion in 1989 [203] to $220 billion for 1990; [204] the $220 billion deficit represented a threefold increase since 1980 [205] As the public became increasingly concerned about the economy and other domestic affairs, Bush's well-received handling of foreign affairs became less of an issue for most voters [206] Bush's top domestic priority was to end federal budget deficits, which he saw as a liability for the country's long-term economic health and standing in the world [207] As he was opposed to major defense spending cuts [208] and had pledged not to raise taxes, the president had major difficulties in balancing the budget [209]\n\n\nEconomy and fiscal issues\nThe U.S economy had generally performed well since emerging from recession in late 1982, but it slipped into a mild recession in 1990 The unemployment rate rose from 5.9 percent in 1989 to a high of 7.8 percent in mid-1991 [201] [202] Large federal deficits, spawned during the Reagan years, rose from $152.1 billion in 1989 [203] to $220 billion for 1990; [204] the $220 billion deficit represented a threefold increase since 1980 [205] As the public became increasingly concerned about the economy and other domestic affairs, Bush's well-received handling of foreign affairs became less of an issue for most voters [206] Bush's top domestic priority was to end federal budget deficits, which he saw as a liability for the country's long-term economic health and standing in the world [207] As he was opposed to major defense spending cuts [208] and had pledged not to raise taxes, the president had major difficulties in balancing the budget [209]\n\n\nDiscrimination\n\"Even the strongest person couldn't scale the Berlin Wall to gain the elusive promise of independence that lay just beyond And so, together we rejoiced when that barrier fell And now I sign legislation which takes a sledgehammer to another wall, one which has for too many generations separated Americans with disabilities from the freedom they could glimpse, but not grasp.\"\n\n\nEnvironment\nIn June 1989, the Bush administration proposed a bill to amend the Clean Air Act Working with Senate Majority Leader George J Mitchell, the administration won passage of the amendments over the opposition of business-aligned members of Congress who feared the impact of tougher regulations [226] The legislation sought to curb acid rain and smog by requiring decreased emissions of chemicals such as sulfur dioxide, [227] and was the first major update to the Clean Air Act since 1977 [228] Bush also signed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 in response to the Exxon Valdez oil spill However, the League of Conservation Voters criticized some of Bush's other environmental actions, including his opposition to stricter auto-mileage standards [229]\n\n\nPoints of Light\nBush devoted attention to voluntary service to solve some of America's most serious social problems He often used the \"thousand points of light\" theme to describe the power of citizens to solve community problems In his 1989 inaugural address, Bush said, \"I have spoken of a thousand points of light, of all the community organizations that are spread like stars throughout the Nation, doing good.\" [230] During his presidency, Bush honored numerous volunteers with the Daily Point of Light Award, a tradition that his presidential successors continued [231] In 1990, the Points of Light Foundation was created as a nonprofit organization in Washington to promote this spirit of volunteerism [232] In 2007, the Points of Light Foundation merged with the Hands On Network to create a new organization, Points of Light [233]\n\n\nJudicial appointments\nBush appointed two justices to the Supreme Court of the United States In 1990, Bush appointed a largely unknown state appellate judge, David Souter, to replace liberal icon William J Brennan Jr [234] Souter was easily confirmed and served until 2009, but joined the liberal bloc of the court, disappointing Bush [234] In 1991, Bush nominated conservative federal judge Clarence Thomas to succeed Thurgood Marshall, a long-time liberal stalwart Thomas, the former head of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), faced heavy opposition in the Senate, as well as from pro-choice groups and the NAACP His nomination faced another difficulty when Anita Hill accused Thomas of having sexually harassed her during his time as the chair of EEOC Thomas won confirmation in a narrow 52–48 vote; 43 Republicans and 9 Democrats voted to confirm Thomas's nomination, while 46 Democrats and 2 Republicans voted against confirmation [235] Thomas became one of the most conservative justices of his era [236]\n\n\nOther issues\nBush's education platform consisted mainly of offering federal support for a variety of innovations, such as open enrollment, incentive pay for outstanding teachers, and rewards for schools that improve performance with underprivileged children [237] Though Bush did not pass a major educational reform package during his presidency, his ideas influenced later reform efforts, including Goals 2000 and the No Child Left Behind Act [238] Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990, [239] which led to a 40 percent increase in legal immigration to the United States [240] The act more than doubled the number of visas given to immigrants on the basis of job skills [241] In the wake of the savings and loan crisis, Bush proposed a $50 billion package to rescue the savings and loans industry, and also proposed the creation of the Office of Thrift Supervision to regulate the industry Congress passed the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, which incorporated most of Bush's proposals [242]\n\n\nPublic image\nBush was widely seen as a \"pragmatic caretaker\" president who lacked a unified and compelling long-term theme in his efforts [243] [244] [245] A Bush sound bite, referring to the issue of overarching purpose as \"the vision thing\", has become a metonym applied to other political figures accused of similar difficulties [246] [247] [248] [249] [250] [251] His ability to gain broad international support for the Gulf War and the war's result were seen as both a diplomatic and military triumph, [252] rousing bipartisan approval, [253] though his decision to withdraw without removing Saddam Hussein left mixed feelings, and attention returned to the domestic front and a souring economy [254] A New York Times article mistakenly depicted Bush as being surprised to see a supermarket barcode reader; [255] [256] the report of his reaction exacerbated the notion that he was \"out of touch\" [255]\n\n\n1992 presidential campaign\nBush announced his reelection bid in early 1992; with a coalition victory in the Persian Gulf War and high approval ratings, Bush's reelection initially looked likely [262] As a result, many leading Democrats, including Mario Cuomo, Dick Gephardt, and Al Gore, declined to seek their party's presidential nomination [263] However, Bush's tax increase angered many conservatives, who believed that Bush had strayed from the conservative principles of Ronald Reagan [264] He faced a challenge from conservative political columnist Pat Buchanan in the 1992 Republican primaries [265] Bush fended off Buchanan's challenge and won his party's nomination at the 1992 Republican National Convention Still, the convention adopted a socially conservative platform strongly influenced by the Christian right [266]\n\n\nPost-presidency (1993–2018)\nAfter leaving office, Bush and his wife built a retirement house in the community of West Oaks, Houston [283] He established a presidential office within the Park Laureate Building on Memorial Drive in Houston [284] He also frequently spent time at his vacation home in Kennebunkport, took annual cruises in Greece, went on fishing trips in Florida, and visited the Bohemian Club in Northern California He declined to serve on corporate boards but delivered numerous paid speeches and was an adviser to The Carlyle Group, a private equity firm [285] He never published his memoirs, but he and Brent Scowcroft co-wrote A World Transformed, a 1998 work on foreign policy Portions of his letters and his diary were later published as The China Diary of George H. W Bush and All the Best, George Bush [286]\n\n\nAppearances\nAfter leaving office, Bush and his wife built a retirement house in the community of West Oaks, Houston [283] He established a presidential office within the Park Laureate Building on Memorial Drive in Houston [284] He also frequently spent time at his vacation home in Kennebunkport, took annual cruises in Greece, went on fishing trips in Florida, and visited the Bohemian Club in Northern California He declined to serve on corporate boards but delivered numerous paid speeches and was an adviser to The Carlyle Group, a private equity firm [285] He never published his memoirs, but he and Brent Scowcroft co-wrote A World Transformed, a 1998 work on foreign policy Portions of his letters and his diary were later published as The China Diary of George H. W Bush and All the Best, George Bush [286]\n\n\nFinal years\nBush supported Republican John McCain in the 2008 presidential election, [301] and Republican Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election, [302] but both were defeated by Democrat Barack Obama In 2011, Obama awarded Bush with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States [303]\n\n\nDeath and funeral\nAfter a long battle with vascular Parkinson's disease, Bush died at his home in Houston on November 30, 2018, at the age of 94 [316] [317] At the time of his death he was the longest-lived U.S president, [318] a distinction now held by Jimmy Carter [319] He was also the third-oldest vice president [h] Bush lay in state in the Rotunda of the U.S Capitol from December 3 through December 5; he was the 12th U.S president to be accorded this honor [321] [322] Then, on December 5, Bush's casket was transferred from the Capitol rotunda to Washington National Cathedral where a state funeral was held [323] After the funeral, Bush's body was transported to George H.W Bush Presidential Library in College Station, Texas, where he was buried next to his wife Barbara and daughter Robin [324] At the funeral, former president George W Bush eulogized his father saying,\n\"He looked for the good in each person, and he usually found it.\" [323]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn May 1991, The New York Times revealed that Bush had developed Graves' disease, a non-contagious thyroid condition that his wife Barbara also had [325] Bush had two separate hip replacement surgeries in 2000 and 2007 [326] Thereafter, Bush started to experience weakness in his legs, which was attributed to vascular parkinsonism, a form of Parkinson's disease He progressively developed problems walking, initially needing a walking stick for mobility aid before he eventually came to rely on a wheelchair from 2011 onwards [327]\n\n\nLegacy\nDefunct\n\n\nHistorical reputation\nDefunct\n\n\nMemorials, awards, and honors\nIn 1990, Time magazine named him the Man of the Year [352] In 1997, the Houston Intercontinental Airport was renamed as the George Bush Intercontinental Airport [353] In 1999, the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, was named the George Bush Center for Intelligence in his honor [354] In 2011, Bush, an avid golfer, was inducted in the World Golf Hall of Fame [355] The USS George H.W Bush (CVN-77), the tenth and last Nimitz-class supercarrier of the United States Navy, was named for Bush [356] [357] Bush is commemorated on a postage stamp that was issued by the United States Postal Service in 2019 [358] In December 2020, the United States Mint honored Bush with a Presidential Dollar coin.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nSecondary sources\n\n\nPrimary sources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Dick_Cheney", "content": "\nEarly life and education\nCheney was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, the son of Marjorie Lorraine (née Dickey) and Richard Herbert Cheney He is of predominantly English, as well as Welsh, Irish, and French Huguenot ancestry His father was a soil conservation agent for the U.S Department of Agriculture and his mother was a softball star in the 1930s; [17] Cheney was one of three children.\nHe attended Calvert Elementary School [18] [19] before his family moved to Casper, Wyoming, [20] where he attended Natrona County High School.\n\n\nEarly career\nCheney's political career began in 1969, as an intern for Congressman William A Steiger during the Richard Nixon Administration He then joined the staff of Donald Rumsfeld, who was then Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity from 1969 to 1970 [25] He held several positions in the years that followed: White House Staff Assistant in 1971, Assistant Director of the Cost of Living Council from 1971 to 1973, and Deputy Assistant to the president from 1974 to 1975 As deputy assistant, Cheney suggested several options in a memo to Rumsfeld, including use of the US Justice Department, that the Ford administration could use to limit damage from an article, published by The New York Times, in which investigative reporter Seymour Hersh reported that Navy submarines had tapped into Soviet undersea communications as part of a highly classified program, Operation Ivy Bells [31] [32]\n\n\nWhite House Chief of Staff\nCheney was Assistant to the President and White House Deputy Chief of Staff under Gerald Ford from December 1974 to November 1975 [33] [34] [35] When Rumsfeld was named Secretary of Defense, Cheney became White House Chief of Staff, succeeding Rumsfeld [25] He later was campaign manager for Ford's 1976 presidential campaign [36]\n\n\nU.S. House of Representatives (1979–1989)\nIn 1978, Cheney was elected to represent Wyoming in the U.S House of Representatives and succeeded retiring Democratic Congressman Teno Roncalio, having defeated his Democratic opponent, Bill Bagley Cheney was re-elected five times, serving until 1989 [citation needed]\n\n\nElections\nIn 1978, Cheney was elected to represent Wyoming in the U.S House of Representatives and succeeded retiring Democratic Congressman Teno Roncalio, having defeated his Democratic opponent, Bill Bagley Cheney was re-elected five times, serving until 1989 [citation needed]\n\n\nTenure\nIn 1987, he was elected Chairman of the House Republican Conference The following year, he was elected House Minority Whip [37] He served for two and a half months before he was appointed Secretary of Defense instead of former U.S Senator John G Tower, whose nomination had been rejected by the U.S Senate in March 1989 [38]\n\n\nLeadership\nIn 1987, he was elected Chairman of the House Republican Conference The following year, he was elected House Minority Whip [37] He served for two and a half months before he was appointed Secretary of Defense instead of former U.S Senator John G Tower, whose nomination had been rejected by the U.S Senate in March 1989 [38]\n\n\nVotes\nHe voted against the creation of the U.S Department of Education, citing his concern over budget deficits and expansion of the federal government, and claiming that the department was an encroachment on states' rights [39] He voted against funding Head Start, but reversed his position in 2000 [40]\n\n\nCommittee assignments\nOriginally declining, U.S Congressman Barber Conable persuaded Cheney to join the moderate Republican Wednesday Group in order to move up the leadership ranks He was elected Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee from 1981 to 1987 Cheney was the Ranking Member of the Select Committee to investigate the Iran-Contra Affair [25] [48] [49] He promoted Wyoming's petroleum and coal businesses as well [50]\n\n\nSecretary of Defense (1989–1993)\nPresident George H W Bush nominated Cheney for the office of Secretary of Defense immediately after the U.S Senate failed to confirm John Tower for that position [51] The senate confirmed Cheney by a vote of 92 to 0 [51] and he served in that office from March 1989 to January 1993 He directed the United States invasion of Panama and Operation Desert Storm in the Middle East In 1991, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Bush [37] [30] Later that year, he received the U.S Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards [52]\n\n\nEarly tenure\nCheney worked closely with Pete Williams, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, and Paul Wolfowitz, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, from the beginning of his tenure He focused primarily on external matters, and left most of the internal DoD management to Deputy Secretary of Defense Donald Atwood [38]\n\n\nBudgetary practices\nCheney's most immediate issue as Secretary of Defense was the Department of Defense budget Cheney deemed it appropriate to cut the budget and downsize the military, following the Reagan Administration's peacetime defense buildup at the height of the Cold War [55] As part of the fiscal year 1990 budget, Cheney assessed the requests from each of the branches of the armed services for such expensive programs as the Avenger II Naval attack aircraft, the B-2 stealth bomber, the V-22 Osprey tilt-wing helicopter, the Aegis destroyer and the MX missile, totaling approximately $4.5 billion in light of changed world politics [38] Cheney opposed the V-22 program, which Congress had already appropriated funds for, and initially refused to issue contracts for it before relenting [56]\nWhen the 1990 Budget came before Congress in the summer of 1989, it settled on a figure between the Administration's request and the House Armed Services Committee's recommendation [38]\n\n\nPolitical climate and agenda\nCheney publicly expressed concern that nations such as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, could acquire nuclear components after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 The end of the Cold War, the fall of the Soviet Union, and the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact obliged the first Bush Administration to reevaluate the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO's) purpose and makeup Cheney believed that NATO should remain the foundation of European security relationships and that it would remain important to the United States in the long term; he urged the alliance to lend more assistance to the new democracies in Eastern Europe [38]\n\n\nInternational situations\nUsing economic sanctions and political pressure, the United States mounted a campaign to drive Panamanian ruler General Manuel Antonio Noriega from power after he fell from favor [38] In May 1989, after Guillermo Endara had been duly elected President of Panama, Noriega nullified the election outcome, drawing intensified pressure In October, Noriega suppressed a military coup, but in December, after soldiers of the Panamanian army killed a U.S serviceman, the United States invasion of Panama began under Cheney's direction The stated reason for the invasion was to seize Noriega to face drug charges in the United States, protect U.S lives and property, and restore Panamanian civil liberties [61] Although the mission was controversial, [62] U.S forces achieved control of Panama and Endara assumed the presidency; Noriega was convicted and imprisoned on racketeering and drug trafficking charges in April 1992 [citation needed]\n\n\nIraqi invasion of Kuwait\nOn August 1, 1990, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein sent the invading Iraqi forces into neighboring Kuwait, a small petroleum-rich state long claimed by Iraq as part of its territory This invasion sparked the initiation of the Persian Gulf War and it brought worldwide condemnation [63] An estimated 140,000 Iraqi troops quickly took control of Kuwait City and moved on to the Saudi Arabia/Kuwait border [38] The United States had already begun to develop contingency plans for the defense of Saudi Arabia by the U.S Central Command, headed by General Norman Schwarzkopf, because of its important petroleum reserves.\n\n\nU.S. and world reaction\nCheney and Schwarzkopf oversaw planning for what would become a full-scale U.S military operation According to General Colin Powell, Cheney \"had become a glutton for information, with an appetite we could barely satisfy He spent hours in the National Military Command Center peppering my staff with questions.\" [38]\n\n\nMilitary action\nThe first phase of Operation Desert Storm, which began on January 17, 1991, was an air offensive to secure air superiority and attack Iraqi forces, targeting key Iraqi command and control centers, including the cities of Baghdad and Basra Cheney turned most other Department of Defense matters over to Deputy Secretary Atwood and briefed Congress during the air and ground phases of the war [38] He flew with Powell to the region to review and finalize the ground war plans [63]\n\n\nAftermath\nA total of 147 U.S military personnel died in combat, and another 236 died as a result of accidents or other causes [38] [64] Iraq agreed to a formal truce on March 3, and a permanent cease-fire on April 6 [38] There was subsequent debate about whether Coalition forces should have driven as far as Baghdad to oust Saddam Hussein from power Bush agreed that the decision to end the ground war when they did was correct, but the debate persisted as Hussein remained in power and rebuilt his military forces [38] Arguably the most significant debate concerned whether U.S and Coalition forces had left Iraq too soon [66] [67] In an April 15, 1994, interview with C-SPAN, Cheney was asked if the U.S.-led Coalition forces should have moved into Baghdad Cheney replied that occupying and attempting to take over the country would have been a \"bad idea\" and would have led to a \"quagmire\", explaining that:\n\n\nPrivate sector career\nBetween 1987 and 1989, during his last term in Congress, Cheney served on the board of the Council on Foreign Relations foreign policy organization [71]\n\n\n2000 presidential election\nIn early 2000, while serving as the CEO of Halliburton, Cheney headed then-Governor of Texas George W Bush's vice-presidential search committee On July 25, after reviewing Cheney's findings, Bush surprised some pundits by asking Cheney himself to join the Republican ticket [25] [83] Halliburton reportedly reached agreement on July 20 to allow Cheney to retire, with a package estimated at $20 million [84]\n\n\nVice presidency (2001–2009)\nFollowing the September 11, 2001, attacks, Cheney remained physically apart from Bush for security reasons For a period, Cheney stayed at a variety of undisclosed locations, out of public view [88] Cheney later revealed in his memoir In My Time that these \"undisclosed locations\" included his official vice presidential residence, his home in Wyoming, and Camp David [89] He also utilized a heavy security detail, employing a motorcade of 12 to 18 government vehicles for his daily commute from the vice presidential residence at the U.S Naval Observatory to the White House [90]\n\n\nFirst term (2001–2005)\nFollowing the September 11, 2001, attacks, Cheney remained physically apart from Bush for security reasons For a period, Cheney stayed at a variety of undisclosed locations, out of public view [88] Cheney later revealed in his memoir In My Time that these \"undisclosed locations\" included his official vice presidential residence, his home in Wyoming, and Camp David [89] He also utilized a heavy security detail, employing a motorcade of 12 to 18 government vehicles for his daily commute from the vice presidential residence at the U.S Naval Observatory to the White House [90]\n\n\nIraq War\nFollowing 9/11, Cheney was instrumental in providing a primary justification for a renewed war against Iraq Cheney helped shape Bush's approach to the \"War on Terror\", making numerous public statements alleging Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, [93] and making several personal visits to CIA headquarters, where he questioned mid-level agency analysts on their conclusions [94] Cheney continued to allege links between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda, even though President Bush received a classified President's Daily Brief on September 21, 2001, indicating the U.S intelligence community had no evidence linking Saddam Hussein to the September 11 attacks and that \"there was scant credible evidence that Iraq had any significant collaborative ties with Al Qaeda.\" [95] Furthermore, in 2004, the 9/11 Commission concluded that there was no \"collaborative relationship\" between Iraq and al-Qaeda [96] By 2014, Cheney continued to misleadingly claim that Saddam \"had a 10-year relationship with al Qaeda.\" [97]\n\n\nSecond term (2005–2009)\nBush and Cheney were re-elected in the 2004 presidential election, running against John Kerry and his running mate, John Edwards During the election, the pregnancy of his daughter Mary and her sexual orientation as a lesbian became a source of public attention for Cheney in light of the same-sex marriage debate [102] Cheney has since stated that he is in favor of gay marriages personally, but that each individual U.S state should decide whether to permit it or not [103] Cheney's former chief legal counsel, David Addington, [104] became his chief of staff and remained in that office until Cheney's departure from office John P Hannah served as Cheney's national security adviser [105]\nUntil his indictment and resignation [106] in 2005, I Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby Jr served in both roles [107]\n\n\nDisclosure of documents\nCheney was a prominent member of the National Energy Policy Development Group (NEPDG), [110] commonly known as the Energy Task Force, composed of energy industry representatives, including several Enron executives After the Enron scandal, the Bush administration was accused of improper political and business ties In July 2003, the Supreme Court ruled that the US Department of Commerce must disclose NEPDG documents, containing references to companies that had made agreements with the previous Iraqi government to extract Iraq's petroleum [111]\n\n\nCIA leak scandal\nOn October 18, 2005, The Washington Post reported that the vice president's office was central to the investigation of the Valerie Plame CIA leak scandal, for Cheney's former chief of staff, Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, was one of the figures under investigation [120] Libby resigned his positions as Cheney's chief of staff and assistant on national security affairs later in the month after he was indicted.\n\n\nAssassination attempt\nOn February 27, 2007, at about 10 am, a suicide bomber killed 23 people and wounded 20 more outside Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan during a visit by Cheney The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack and declared that Cheney was its intended target They also claimed that Osama bin Laden supervised the operation [129] The bomb went off outside the front gate while Cheney was inside the base and half a mile away He reported hearing the blast, saying \"I heard a loud boom.. The Secret Service came in and told me there had been an attack on the main gate.\" [130] The purpose of Cheney's visit to the region had been to press Pakistan for a united front against the Taliban [131]\n\n\nPolicy formulation\nCheney has been characterized as the most powerful and influential Vice President in history [132] [133]\nBoth supporters and critics of Cheney regard him as a shrewd and knowledgeable politician who knows the functions and intricacies of the federal government A sign of Cheney's active policy-making role was then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert's provision of an office near the House floor for Cheney [134] in addition to his office in the West Wing, [135] his ceremonial office in the Old Executive Office Building, [136] and his Senate offices (one in the Dirksen Senate Office Building and another off the floor of the Senate) [134] [137]\n\n\nPost–vice presidency (2009–present)\nIn 2008 Cheney purchased a home on Chain Bridge Road in McLean, Virginia, part of the Washington suburbs, which he tore down for a replacement structure [150] He also maintains homes in Wyoming and on Maryland's Eastern Shore [151]\n\n\nPolitical activity\nIn July 2012, Cheney used his Wyoming home to host a private fundraiser for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, which netted over $4 million in contributions from attendees for Romney's campaign [152]\n\n\nViews on President Obama\nOn December 29, 2009, four days after the attempted bombing of an international passenger flight from the Netherlands to United States, Cheney criticized President Barack Obama: \" [We] are at war and when President Obama pretends we aren't, it makes us less safe .. Why doesn't he want to admit we're at war? It doesn't fit with the view of the world he brought with him to the Oval Office It doesn't fit with what seems to be the goal of his presidency – social transformation – the restructuring of American society.\" [171] In response, White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer wrote on the official White House blog the following day, \" [I]t is telling that Vice President Cheney and others seem to be more focused on criticizing the Administration than condemning the attackers Unfortunately too many are engaged in the typical Washington game of pointing fingers and making political hay, instead of working together to find solutions to make our country safer.\" [172] [173]\nDuring a February 14, 2010, appearance on ABC's This Week, Cheney reiterated his criticism of the Obama administration's policies for handling suspected terrorists, criticizing the \"mindset\" of treating \"terror attacks against the United States as criminal acts as opposed to acts of war\" [149]\n\n\nMemoir\nIn August 2011, Cheney published his memoir, In My Time: A Personal and Political Memoir, written with Liz Cheney The book outlines Cheney's recollections of 9/11, the War on Terrorism, the 2001 War in Afghanistan, the run-up to the 2003 Iraq War, so-called \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" and other events [176] According to Barton Gellman, the author of Angler: The Cheney Vice Presidency, Cheney's book differs from publicly available records on details surrounding the NSA surveillance program [177] [178]\n\n\nExceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America\nIn 2015, Cheney published another book, Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America, again co-authored with his daughter Liz The book traces the history of U.S foreign policy and military successes and failures from Franklin Roosevelt's administration through the Obama administration The authors tell the story of what they describe as the unique role the United States has played as a defender of freedom throughout the world since World War II [179] Drawing upon the notion of American exceptionalism, the co-authors criticize Barack Obama's and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's foreign policies, and offer what they see as the solutions needed to restore American greatness and power on the world stage in defense of freedom [180] [181]\n\n\nViews on President Trump\nCheney has criticized modern Republican leadership [182] In May 2016, Cheney said he would support Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election [183] In May 2018, Cheney supported Trump's decision to withdraw from the Iran Nuclear Deal [184]\n\n\nPublic perception and legacy\nCheney's early public opinion polls were more favorable than unfavorable, reaching his peak approval rating in the wake of the September 11 attacks at 68 percent [15] However, polling numbers for both him and the president gradually declined in their second terms, [15] [193] with Cheney reaching his lowest point shortly before leaving office at 13 percent [193] [194] Cheney's Gallup poll figures are mostly consistent with those from other polls: [15] [195]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nCheney is a member of the United Methodist Church [210] and was the first Methodist vice president to serve under a Methodist president [211]\n\n\nPersonal life\nCheney is a member of the United Methodist Church [210] and was the first Methodist vice president to serve under a Methodist president [211]\n\n\nHealth problems\nCheney's long histories of cardiovascular disease and periodic need for urgent health care raised questions of whether he was medically fit to serve in public office [218] Having smoked approximately 3 packs of cigarettes per day for nearly 20 years, [219] Cheney had his first of five heart attacks on June 18, 1978, [220] at age 37 Subsequent heart attacks in 1984, 1988, on November 22, 2000, and on February 22, 2010, resulted in moderate contractile dysfunction of his left ventricle [221] [222] [clarification needed] He underwent four-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting in 1988, coronary artery stenting in November 2000, urgent coronary balloon angioplasty in March 2001, and the implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator in June 2001 [221]\n\n\nHunting incident\nOn February 11, 2006, Cheney accidentally shot Harry Whittington, a then-78-year-old Texas attorney, while participating in a quail hunt at Armstrong ranch in Kenedy County, Texas [241] Secret Service agents and medical aides, who were traveling with Cheney, came to Whittington's assistance and treated his birdshot wounds to his right cheek, neck, and chest An ambulance standing by for the Vice President took Whittington to nearby Kingsville before he was flown by helicopter to Corpus Christi Memorial Hospital On February 14, 2006, Whittington had a non-fatal heart attack and atrial fibrillation due to at least one lead-shot pellet lodged in or near his heart [242] Because of the small size of the birdshot pellets, doctors decided to leave up to 30 pieces of the pellets lodged in his body rather than try to remove them.\n\n\nWorks\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal

Born on January 30, 1941, in Lincoln, Nebraska, Cheney is a prominent figure in American politics, known for his conservative views and influential role in shaping U.S. foreign policy.\n\nEarly Life and Education\nCheney was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, the son of Marjorie Lorraine (née Dickey) and Richard Herbert Cheney. He is of predominantly English, Welsh, Irish, and French Huguenot ancestry. Cheney's father was a soil conservation agent for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and his mother was a softball star in the 1930s. Cheney was one of three children.\n\nCheney attended Calvert Elementary School before his family moved to Casper, Wyoming, where he attended Natrona County High School. He developed an interest in politics at an early age and was elected student body president in his senior year.\n\nEarly Career\nCheney's political career began in 1969, as an intern for Congressman William A. Steiger during the Richard Nixon Administration. He then joined the staff of Donald Rumsfeld, who was then Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity from 1969 to 1970. Cheney held several positions in the years that followed: White House Staff Assistant in 1971, Assistant Director of the Cost of Living Council from 1971 to 1973, and Deputy Assistant to the President from 1974 to 1975.\n\nWhite House Chief of Staff\nCheney was Assistant to the President and White House Deputy Chief of Staff under Gerald Ford from December 1974 to November 1975. When Rumsfeld was named Secretary of Defense, Cheney became White House Chief of Staff, succeeding Rumsfeld. He later was campaign manager for Ford's 1976 presidential campaign.\n\nU.S. House of Representatives (1979–1989)\nIn 1978, Cheney was elected to represent Wyoming in the U.S. House of Representatives and succeeded retiring Democratic Congressman Teno Roncalio, having defeated his Democratic opponent, Bill Bagley. Cheney was re-elected five times, serving until 1989.\n\nLeadership\nIn 1987, he was elected Chairman of the House Republican Conference. The following year, he was elected House Minority Whip. He served for two and a half months before he was appointed Secretary of Defense instead of former U.S. Senator John G. Tower, whose nomination had been rejected by the U.S. Senate in March 1989.\n\nVotes\nCheney voted against the creation of the U.S. Department of Education, citing his concern over budget deficits and expansion of the federal government, and claiming that the department was an encroachment on states' rights. He voted against funding Head Start, but reversed his position in 2000.\n\nCommittee Assignments\nOriginally declining, U.S. Congressman Barber Conable persuaded Cheney to join the moderate Republican Wednesday Group in order to move up the leadership ranks. He was elected Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee from 1981 to 1987. Cheney was the Ranking Member of the Select Committee to investigate the Iran-Contra Affair.\n\nSecretary of Defense (1989–1993)\nPresident George H.W. Bush nominated Cheney for the office of Secretary of Defense immediately after the U.S. Senate failed to confirm John Tower for that position. The senate confirmed Cheney by a vote of 92 to 0, and he served in that office from March 1989 to January 1993. He directed the United States invasion of Panama and Operation Desert Storm in the Middle East. In 1991, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Bush. Later that year, he received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official.\n\nPrivate Sector Career\nBetween 1987 and 1989, during his last term in Congress, Cheney served on the board of the Council on Foreign Relations foreign policy organization.\n\nVice Presidency (2001–2009)\nFollowing the September 11, 2001, attacks, Cheney remained physically apart from Bush for security reasons. For a period, Cheney stayed at a variety of undisclosed locations, out of public view. He later revealed in his memoir In My Time that these \"undisclosed locations\" included his official vice presidential residence, his home in Wyoming, and Camp David. He also utilized a heavy security detail, employing a motorcade of 12 to 18 government vehicles for his daily commute from the vice presidential residence at the U.S. Naval Observatory to the White House.\n\nIraq War\nFollowing 9/11, Cheney was instrumental in providing a primary justification for a renewed war against Iraq. He helped shape Bush's approach to the \"War on Terror,\" making numerous public statements alleging Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, and making several personal visits to CIA headquarters, where he questioned mid-level agency analysts on their conclusions. Cheney continued to allege links between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda, even though President Bush received a classified President's Daily Brief on September 21, 2001, indicating the U.S. intelligence community had no evidence linking Saddam Hussein to the September 11 attacks and that \"there was scant credible evidence that Iraq had any significant collaborative ties with Al Qaeda.\"\n\nPost-Vice Presidency (2009-Present)\nIn 2008, Cheney purchased a home on Chain Bridge Road in McLean, Virginia, part of the Washington suburbs, which he tore down for a replacement structure. He also maintains homes in Wyoming and on Maryland's Eastern Shore.\n\nPublic Perception and Legacy\nCheney's early public opinion polls were more favorable than unfavorable, reaching his peak approval rating in the wake of the September 11 attacks at 68 percent. However, polling numbers for both him and the president gradually declined in their second terms, with Cheney reaching his lowest point shortly before leaving office at 13 percent.\n\nPersonal Life\nCheney is a member of the United Methodist Church and was the first Methodist vice president to serve under a Methodist president. He has had a long history of cardiovascular disease and has undergone several heart surgeries, including coronary artery bypass grafting and the implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator.\n\nHealth Problems\nCheney's long history of cardiovascular disease and periodic need for urgent health care raised questions of whether he was medically fit to serve in public office.

Living Council from 1971 to 1973, and Deputy Assistant to the president from 1974 to 1975 As deputy assistant, Cheney suggested several options in a memo to Rumsfeld, including use of the US Justice

nominated Cheney for the office of Secretary of Defense immediately after the U.S Senate failed to confirm John Tower for that position [51] The senate confirmed Cheney by a vote of 92 to 0 [51] and he served in that office from March 1989 to January 1993 He directed the United States invasion of Panama and Operation Desert Storm in the Middle East In 1991, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Bush [37] [30] Later that year, he received the U.S Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards [52]\n\n\nEarly tenure\nCheney worked closely with Pete Williams, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, and Paul Wolfowitz, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, from the beginning of his tenure He focused primarily on external matters, and left most of the internal DoD management to Deputy Secretary of Defense Donald Atwood [38]\n\n\nBudgetary practices\nCheney's most immediate issue as Secretary of Defense was the Department of Defense budget Cheney deemed it appropriate to cut the budget and downsize the military, following the Reagan Administration's peacetime defense buildup at the height of the Cold War [55] As part of the fiscal year 1990 budget, Cheney assessed the requests from each of the branches of the armed services for such expensive programs as the Avenger II Naval attack aircraft, the B-2 stealth bomber, the V-22 Osprey tilt-wing helicopter, the Aegis destroyer and the MX missile, totaling approximately $4.5 billion in light of changed world politics [38] Cheney opposed the V-22 program, which Congress had already appropriated funds for, and initially refused to issue contracts for it before relenting [56]\nWhen the 1990 Budget came before Congress in the summer of 1989, it settled on a figure between the Administration's request and the House Armed Services Committee's recommendation [38]\n\n\nPolitical climate and agenda\nCheney publicly expressed concern that nations such as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, could acquire nuclear components after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 The end of the Cold War, the fall of the Soviet Union, and the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact obliged the first Bush Administration to reevaluate the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO's) purpose and makeup Cheney believed that NATO should remain the foundation of European security relationships and that it would remain important to the United States in the long term; he urged the alliance to lend more assistance to the new democracies in Eastern Europe [38]\n\n\nInternational situations\nUsing economic sanctions and political pressure, the United States mounted a campaign to drive Panamanian ruler General Manuel Antonio Noriega from power after he fell from favor [38] In May 1989, after Guillermo Endara had been duly elected President of Panama, Noriega nullified the election outcome, drawing intensified pressure In October, Noriega suppressed a military coup, but in December, after soldiers of the Panamanian army killed a U.S serviceman, the United States invasion of Panama began under Cheney's direction The stated reason for the invasion was to seize Noriega to face drug charges in the United States, protect U.S lives and property, and restore Panamanian civil liberties [61] Although the mission was controversial, [62] U.S forces achieved control of Panama and Endara assumed the presidency; Noriega was convicted and imprisoned on racketeering and drug trafficking charges in April 1992 [citation needed]\n\n\nIraqi invasion of Kuwait\nOn August 1, 1990, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein sent the invading Iraqi forces into neighboring Kuwait, a small petroleum-rich state long claimed by Iraq as part of its territory This invasion sparked the initiation of the Persian Gulf War and it brought worldwide condemnation [63] An estimated 140,000 Iraqi troops quickly took control of Kuwait City and moved on to the Saudi Arabia/Kuwait border [38] The United States had already begun to develop contingency plans for the defense of Saudi Arabia by the U.S Central Command, headed by General Norman Schwarzkopf, because of its important petroleum reserves.\n\n\nU.S. and world reaction\nCheney and Schwarzkopf oversaw planning for what would become a full-scale U.S military operation According to General Colin Powell, Cheney \"had become a glutton for information, with an appetite we could barely satisfy He spent hours in the National Military Command Center peppering my staff with questions.\" [38]\n\n\nMilitary action\nThe first phase of Operation Desert Storm, which began on January 17, 1991, was an air offensive to secure air superiority and attack Iraqi forces, targeting key Iraqi command and control centers, including the cities of Baghdad and Basra Cheney turned most other Department of Defense matters over to Deputy Secretary Atwood and briefed Congress during the air and ground phases of the war [38] He flew with Powell to the region to review and finalize the ground war plans [63]\n\n\nAftermath\nA total of 147 U.S military personnel died in combat, and another 236 died as a result of accidents or other causes [38] [64] Iraq agreed to a formal truce on March 3, and a permanent cease-fire on April 6 [38] There was subsequent debate about whether Coalition forces should have driven as far as Baghdad to oust Saddam Hussein from power Bush agreed that the decision to end the ground war when they did was correct, but the debate persisted as Hussein remained in power and rebuilt his military forces [38] Arguably the most significant debate concerned whether U.S and Coalition forces had left Iraq too soon [66] [67] In an April 15, 1994, interview with C-SPAN, Cheney was asked if the U.S.-led Coalition forces should have moved into Baghdad Cheney replied that occupying and attempting to take over the country would have been a \"bad idea\" and would have led to a \"quagmire\", explaining that:\n\n\nPrivate sector career\nBetween 1987 and 1989, during his last term in Congress, Cheney served on the board of the Council on Foreign Relations foreign policy organization [71]\n\n\n2000 presidential election\nIn early 2000, while serving as the CEO of Halliburton, Cheney headed then-Governor of Texas George W Bush's vice-presidential search committee On July 25, after reviewing Cheney's findings, Bush surprised some pundits by asking Cheney himself to join the Republican ticket [25] [83] Halliburton reportedly reached agreement on July 20 to allow Cheney to retire, with a package estimated at $20 million [84]\n\n\nVice presidency (2001–2009)\nFollowing the September 11, 2001, attacks, Cheney remained physically apart from Bush for security reasons For a period, Cheney stayed at a variety of undisclosed locations, out of public view [88] Cheney later revealed in his memoir In My Time that these

Saddam Hussein to the September 11 attacks and that \"there was scant credible evidence that Iraq had any significant collaborative ties with Al Qaeda.\" [95] Furthermore, in 2004, the 9/11 Commission concluded that there was no \"collaborative relationship\" between Iraq and al-Qaeda [96] By 2014, Cheney continued to misleadingly claim that Saddam \"had a 10-year relationship with al Qaeda.\" [97]\n\n\nSecond term (2005–2009)\nBush and Cheney were re-elected in the 2004 presidential election, running against John Kerry and his running mate, John Edwards During the election, the pregnancy of his daughter Mary and her sexual orientation as a lesbian became a source of public attention for Cheney in light of the same-sex marriage debate [102] Cheney has since stated that he is in favor of gay marriages personally, but that each individual U.S state should decide whether to permit it or not [103] Cheney's former chief legal counsel, David Addington, [104] became his chief of staff and remained in that office until Cheney's departure from office John P Hannah served as Cheney's national security adviser [105]\nUntil his indictment and resignation [106] in 2005, I Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby Jr served in both roles [107]\n\n\nDisclosure of documents\nCheney was a prominent member of the National Energy Policy Development Group (NEPDG), [110] commonly known as the Energy Task Force, composed of energy industry representatives, including several Enron executives After the Enron scandal, the Bush administration was accused of improper political and business ties In July 2003, the Supreme Court ruled that the US Department of Commerce must disclose NEPDG documents, containing references to companies that had made agreements with the previous Iraqi government to extract Iraq's petroleum [111]\n\n\nCIA leak scandal\nOn October 18, 2005, The Washington Post reported that the vice president's office was central to the investigation of the Valerie Plame CIA leak scandal, for Cheney's former chief of staff, Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, was one of the figures under investigation [120] Libby resigned his positions as Cheney's chief of staff and assistant on national security affairs later in the month after he was indicted.\n\n\nAssassination attempt\nOn February 27, 2007, at about 10 am, a suicide bomber killed 23 people and wounded 20 more outside Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan during a visit by Cheney The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack and declared that Cheney was its intended target They also claimed that Osama bin Laden supervised the operation [129] The bomb went off outside the front gate while Cheney was inside the base and half a mile away He reported hearing the blast, saying \"I heard a loud boom.. The Secret Service came in and told me there had been an attack on the main gate.\" [130] The purpose of Cheney's visit to the region had been to press Pakistan for a united front against the Taliban [131]\n\n\nPolicy formulation\nCheney has been characterized as the most powerful and influential Vice President in history [132] [133]\nBoth supporters and critics of Cheney regard him as a shrewd and knowledgeable politician who knows the functions and intricacies of the federal government A sign of Cheney's active policy-making role was then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert's provision of an office near the House floor for Cheney [134] in addition to his office in the West Wing, [135] his ceremonial office in the Old Executive Office Building, [136] and his Senate offices (one in the Dirksen Senate Office Building and another off the floor of the Senate) [134] [137]\n\n\nPost–vice presidency (2009–present)\nIn 2008 Cheney purchased a home on Chain Bridge Road in McLean, Virginia, part of the Washington suburbs, which he tore down for a replacement structure [150] He also maintains homes in Wyoming and on Maryland's Eastern Shore [151]\n\n\nPolitical activity\nIn July 2012, Cheney used his Wyoming home to host a private fundraiser for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, which netted over $4 million in contributions from attendees for Romney's campaign [152]\n\n\nViews on President Obama\nOn December 29, 2009, four days after the attempted bombing of an international passenger flight from the Netherlands to United States, Cheney criticized President Barack Obama: \" [We] are at war and when President Obama pretends we aren't, it makes us less safe .. Why doesn't he want to admit we're at war? It doesn't fit with the view of the world he brought with him to the Oval Office It doesn't fit with what seems to be the goal of his presidency – social transformation – the restructuring of American society.\" [171] In response, White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer wrote on the official White House blog the following day, \" [I]t is telling that Vice President Cheney and others seem to be more focused on criticizing the Administration than condemning the attackers Unfortunately too many are engaged in the typical Washington game of pointing fingers and making political hay, instead of working together to find solutions to make our country safer.\" [172] [173]\nDuring a February 14, 2010, appearance on ABC's This Week, Cheney reiterated his criticism of the Obama administration's policies for handling suspected terrorists, criticizing the \"mindset\" of treating \"terror attacks against the United States as criminal acts as opposed to acts of war\" [149]\n\n\nMemoir\nIn August 2011, Cheney published his memoir, In My Time: A Personal and Political Memoir, written with Liz Cheney The book outlines Cheney's recollections of 9/11, the War on Terrorism, the 2001 War in Afghanistan, the run-up to the 2003 Iraq War, so-called \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" and other events [176] According to Barton Gellman, the author of Angler: The Cheney Vice Presidency, Cheney's book differs from publicly available records on details surrounding the NSA surveillance program [177] [178]\n\n\nExceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America\nIn 2015, Cheney published another book, Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America, again co-authored with his daughter Liz The book traces the history of U.S foreign policy and military successes and failures from Franklin Roosevelt's administration through the Obama administration The authors tell the story of what they describe as the unique role the United States has played as a defender of freedom throughout the world since World War II [179] Drawing upon the notion of American exceptionalism, the co-authors criticize Barack Obama's and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's foreign policies, and offer what they see as the solutions needed to restore American greatness and power on the world stage in defense of freedom [180] [181]\n\n\nViews on President Trump\nCheney has criticized modern Republican leadership [182] In May 2016, Cheney said he would support Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election [183] In May 2018, Cheney supported Trump's decision to withdraw from the Iran Nuclear Deal [184]\n\n\nPublic perception and legacy\nCheney's early public opinion polls were more favorable than unfavorable, reaching his peak approval rating in the wake of the September 11 attacks at 68 percent [15] However, polling numbers for both him and the president gradually declined in their second terms, [15] [193] with Cheney reaching his lowest point shortly before leaving office at 13 percent [193] [194] Cheney's Gallup poll figures are mostly consistent with those from other polls: [15] [195]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nCheney is a member of the United Methodist Church [210] and was the first Methodist vice president to serve under a Methodist president [211]\n\n\nPersonal life\nCheney is a member of the United Methodist Church [210] and was the first Methodist vice president to serve under a Methodist president [211]\n\n\nHealth problems\nCheney's long histories of cardiovascular disease and periodic need for urgent health care raised questions of whether he was medically fit to serve in public office [218] Having smoked approximately 3 packs of cigarettes per day for nearly 20 years, [219] Cheney had his first of five heart attacks on June 18, 1978, [220] at age 37 Subsequent heart attacks in 1984, 1988, on November 22, 2000, and on February 22, 2010, resulted in moderate contractile dysfunction of his left ventricle [221] [222] [clarification needed] He underwent four-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting in 1988, coronary artery stenting in November 2000, urgent coronary balloon angioplasty in March 2001, and the implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator in June 2001 [221]\n\n\nHunting incident\nOn February 11, 2006, Cheney accidentally shot Harry Whittington, a then-78-year-old Texas attorney, while participating in a quail hunt at Armstrong ranch in Kenedy County, Texas [241] Secret Service agents and medical aides, who were traveling with Cheney, came to Whittington's assistance and treated his birdshot wounds to his right cheek, neck, and chest An ambulance standing by for the Vice President took Whittington to nearby Kingsville before he was flown by helicopter to Corpus Christi Memorial Hospital On February 14, 2006, Whittington had a non-fatal heart attack and atrial fibrillation due to at least one lead-shot pellet lodged in or near his heart [242] Because of the small size of the birdshot pellets, doctors decided to leave up to 30 pieces of the pellets lodged in his body rather than try to remove them.\n\n\nWorks\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal

Billboard writer Michael Saponara claimed, \"If West and his sparse 808s were a tree, it would have grown another branch with the blossoming art displayed by fellow Chicago native Juice WRLD in 2018.\" Higgins was among the ranks of openly vulnerable artists born from the emo rap scene inspired by West's influential fourth album, \"808s & Heartbreak\" (2008). During an interview with All Def Music, Higgins said, \"I was singing 'Street Lights' like I had shit to be sad about Kanye [West] is a time traveler That nigga went to damn near 2015 and came back with some sauce.\" His other influences included Wu-Tang Clan, Quietdrive, Fall Out Boy, Black Sabbath, the Starting Line, the Cranberries, the City Drive, 2Pac, Eminem, XXXTentacion, Kid Cudi, and Escape the Fate.

His songs harbor melodic flows to complement their melancholic subjects. Higgins claimed he talked about things others are thinking but are afraid to speak about, such as being vulnerable and hurt. Having built a following through emo rap, Higgins offered lyrics that touch on heartbreak and fragmented feelings. Though not entirely groundbreaking, his musical approach provided a sense of familiarity that heartbroken adolescents of the current generation could gravitate towards. Higgins maintained that he only wrote from personal experience, and found strength in his pain and vulnerability. While the lyrical content of his songs often centered on heartache and bitterness, there are occasionally more boastful lines and creative references.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nHiggins had a history of drug abuse, which began at an early age; he spoke openly about his experiences. His mother claimed that he was also dealing with anxiety and depression on top of his battle with drug addiction. Higgins had agreed to attend drug rehabilitation weeks prior to his death.\n\n**Death**\n\nOn December 8, 2019, Higgins was aboard a private Gulfstream jet flying from Van Nuys Airport in Los Angeles to Midway International Airport in Chicago. Law enforcement officers were waiting for the jet to arrive, having been notified by federal agents, while the flight was en route, that they suspected there were guns and drugs on the plane. Law enforcement officials said that they found 70 pounds of marijuana on the aircraft and said several members of Higgins' management team aboard the flight told them that Higgins had taken \"several unknown pills.\" The investigation concluded that Higgins died from an accidental overdose of oxycodone and codeine.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nFellow rapper Boosie Badazz suggested that the pilot of the plane was ultimately responsible for Higgins' death, referring to him as being a snitch. In fact, Higgins had been suspected by federal authorities of illegal activity following an incident that occurred in November 2019 before he departed for Australia, which prompted a search of his plane. Badazz gave an interview threatening violence upon the pilot before later recanting, after reflecting on the dangers of young artists suddenly being overwhelmed with money.\n\n**Discography**\n\nStudio Albums:\n\n* \"Goodbye & Good Riddance\" (2018)\n* \"Wrld on Drugs\" (2018)\n* \"Death Race for Love\" (2019)\n* \"Legends Never Die\" (2020)\n* \"Fighting Demons\" (2021)\n\nFilmography:\n\n* \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\" (2018)\n\nConcert Tours:\n\n* \"WRLD Domination Tour\" (2018)\n* \"Death Race for Love Tour\" (2019)\n\nAwards and Nominations:\n\n* American Music Awards:\n\t+ Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Album (2019) - \"Death Race for Love\"\n* BET Awards:\n\t+ Best Collaboration (2019) - \"Lucid Dreams\" (feat.

They were known for their conservative views and were vocal supporters of former President Donald Trump.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nDiamond and Silk rose to prominence in the early 2010s, initially as YouTube personalities and later as social media influencers and commentators. They gained a significant following on platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter, and were known for their outspoken views on politics, social issues, and culture. Their rise to fame coincided with the 2016 presidential election, during which they campaigned for Donald Trump and appeared on various media outlets to promote their views.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nLynnette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson were born into a large family in North Carolina. They were the youngest of four sisters and had three older siblings. Hardaway and Richardson grew up in a low-income household and struggled financially throughout their childhood.

However, a U.S. Federal Election Commission filing later revealed that the Trump campaign had paid them $1,275 for \"field consulting\" on November 22, 2016.\n\nThe controversy surrounding this issue led to accusations that Hardaway and Richardson had committed perjury. Representative Hakeem Jeffries suggested that they could be committing perjury and showed them the U.S. Federal Election Commission filing, which reported that the Trump campaign had paid them for their services.\n\n**Diamond and Silk Act of 2019**\n\nIn June 2019, House Representative Steve King introduced the Diamond and Silk Act, an anti-sanctuary city bill.

Day\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nInternational Workers' Day, also known as Labor Day, May Day, or Workers' Day, is a public holiday celebrated on May 1st in many countries around the world. It originated in the late 19th century as a day to commemorate the struggles of workers and labor movements for better working conditions, higher wages, and social justice. The day has been observed in different forms and with varying levels of enthusiasm over the years, but its core purpose remains the same – to promote workers' rights and social equality.\n\nOrigin\n------\n\nLabor celebrations existed in some European countries since the end of the 18th century. For instance, in France, the first Labor Day was celebrated in 1793, while in the United Kingdom, the first public holiday for workers was established in 1871. However, the modern concept of International Workers' Day was born in the late 19th century, particularly in the United States and Europe.\n\nSoviet Union and Eastern Bloc under socialist governments\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nUnder the Soviet Union and other socialist governments in Eastern Europe, May Day was a major public holiday and a symbol of the ideology of communism. Workers were de facto required to participate in large state-organized parades on May Day, which was seen as a celebration of the unity and solidarity of the working class. In many countries, including Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary, May Day was a day off work and a day out of school.\n\nBy country\n-----------\n\n### Africa\n\n#### Algeria\n\nIn Algeria, 1 May is a public holiday celebrated as Labour Day.\n\n#### Angola\n\nIn Angola, 1 May is recognized as a public holiday and called Workers' Day.\n\n#### Egypt\n\nIn Egypt, 1 May is known as Labour Day and is considered a paid holiday.

{"title": "Northern_Alliance", "content": "\nCommanders and factions\nThe United Front was formed in late 1996 against the Taliban government by opposition factions Since early 1999, Ahmad Shah Massoud was the only main leader able to defend his territory against the Taliban, and as such remained as the main de facto political and military leader of the United Front recognized by members of all the different ethnic groups Massoud decided on the main political line and the general military strategy of the alliance A part of the United Front military factions, such as Junbish-i Milli or Hezb-e Wahdat, however, did not fall under the direct control of Massoud but remained under their respective regional or ethnic leaders.\n\n\nHeadquarters\nInitially, the city of Mazar-i-Sharif under Dostum's control served as one of the Northern Alliance's headquarters, until the city was overrun in 1997 Under Massoud's control, Taloqan in Takhar Province, north of Panjshir, was the group's headquarters until September 5, 2000, when the city was taken by the Taliban [11] and led to its base moving to Badakhshan Province [3] Massoud also maintained a private residence in Dushanbe, Tajikistan It was there where Massoud would meet international diplomatic staff who supported the Northern Alliance [12]\n\n\nHistory\nDuring the early 1990s the Najibullah regime funded pro government militias all over the country in order to fight the mujahedeen insurgency however Najibullah, an ethnic Pashtun began to mistrust the mostly non-Pashtun militias in the north many of whom had ties to Ahmad Shah Massoud [5] [13] In an effort to reassert his control over the supply lines in the North, Najibullah replaced General Abdul Momim, an ethnic Tajik, with General Rasul, a Pashtun Khalqi known for being the brutal commander of Pul-e-Charkhi [6] Momim refused to step down, he and ethnic Uzbek, General Rashid Dostum defected and allied with Ahmad Shah Massoud and Ali Mazari forming the Northern Alliance The alliance would take the city of Mazar-i Sharif on March 19, 1992 and launching a massive offensive towards the capital of Kabul Many non Pashtuns in the Afghan military defected to the alliance [6] [1]\n\n\nBackground\nDuring the early 1990s the Najibullah regime funded pro government militias all over the country in order to fight the mujahedeen insurgency however Najibullah, an ethnic Pashtun began to mistrust the mostly non-Pashtun militias in the north many of whom had ties to Ahmad Shah Massoud [5] [13] In an effort to reassert his control over the supply lines in the North, Najibullah replaced General Abdul Momim, an ethnic Tajik, with General Rasul, a Pashtun Khalqi known for being the brutal commander of Pul-e-Charkhi [6] Momim refused to

March 19, 1992 and launching a massive offensive towards the capital of Kabul Many non Pashtuns in the Afghan military defected to the alliance [6] [1]\n\n\nReestablishment of the United Front\nAhmad Shah Massoud and Abdul Rashid Dostum, former allies and enemies, recreated a United Front (Northern Alliance) against the Taliban that were preparing offensives against the remaining areas under the control of Massoud and those under the control of Dostum The United Front included beside the dominantly Tajik forces of Massoud and the Uzbek forces of Dostum, Hazara troops led by Haji Mohammad Mohaqiq and Pashtun forces under the leadership of commanders such as Abdul Haq and Haji Abdul Qadir Notable politicians and diplomats of the United Front included Abdul Rahim Ghafoorzai, Abdullah Abdullah and Masood Khalili From the Taliban conquest of Kabul in September 1996 until November 2001 the United Front controlled roughly 30% of Afghanistan's population in provinces such as Badakhshan, Kapisa, Takhar and parts of Parwan, Kunar, Nuristan, Laghman, Samangan, Kunduz, Ghōr and Bamyan.\n\n\nForeign intervention\nThroughout the 1990s, Iran was the primary state sponsor of the Northern Alliance, [27] along with India and Russia By contrast, the Taliban were supported by Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the UAE [28] Because of Indian influence in the Alliance, Pakistan feared a Northern Alliance victory would result in Pakistan's encirclement by India on one side and an Indian-allied Northern Alliance on the other [29] [30] [31] During the 1990s, Turkey also supported the Northern Alliance [32] Israel was initially not critical of the Taliban, as both governments opposed Iran, and the Mossad reached out to the Taliban [33] However, later, under pressure from United States and Turkey, Israel instead began reaching out to the Northern Alliance, even though it remained suspicious of the Alliance's pro-Iran position [33]\n\n\nTaliban massacres\nAccording to a 55-page report by the United Nations, the Taliban, while trying to consolidate control over northern and western Afghanistan, committed systematic massacres against civilians [56] [57] UN officials stated that there had been \"15 massacres\" between 1996 and 2001 [56] [57] They also said, that \" [t]hese have been highly systematic and they all lead back to the  [Taliban] Ministry of Defense or to Mullah Omar himself\" [56] [57] Al Qaeda's so-called 055 Brigade was also responsible for mass-killings of Afghan civilians [36] The report by the United Nations quotes eyewitnesses in many villages describing Arab fighters \"carrying long knives used for slitting throats and skinning people\" [56] [57]\n\n\nAhmad Shah Massoud\nAfter longstanding battles especially for the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif, Abdul Rashid Dostum and his Junbish-i Milli forces alongside allied Hezb-e Wahdat forces were defeated by the Taliban and their allies in 1998 Dostum subsequently went into exile Ahmad Shah Massoud remained the only major anti-Taliban leader inside the country who was able to defend vast parts of his territory against the Pakistani Army, the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, not once leaving Afghanistan except for diplomatic purposes [58] [59]\n\n\nPost 9/11\nAfter the September 11 attacks in the United States in 2001, the United Front succeeded in retaking Kabul from the Taliban with air support from US-led forces during Operation Enduring Freedom Despite fears of a return to the chaos similar to that of the 1992–1996 civil war, all the Afghan leaders met in Germany to create a new government Hamid Karzai was chosen to lead the country and most key positions were given to Tajik members of the Northern Alliance This created a major international issue While Pakistan has always favored Afghanistan's major ethnic group, the Pashtun, India saw an opportunity for increasing its regional power by jumping on board with the support of the Northern Alliance in the early days of the war [71] With both nations seeking to increase or maintain their regional power through opposing factions on the ground, observers came to view the conflict in Afghanistan as a proxy-war between the two state powers [72] [73]\n\n\nLegacy\nBetween 1996 and 2001, the Northern Alliance blocked the Taliban and al-Qaeda from gaining control of the entirety of Afghanistan Many internally displaced persons found shelter in areas controlled by Ahmad Shah Massoud After the September 2001 attacks in the United States, U.S air raids followed by ground troops of the United Front ousted the Taliban from power in Kabul Between November and December 2001, the United Front gained control of most major Afghan cities Had it not been for the United Front, the U.S would have needed to deploy

fought against the Taliban regime and its allies from 1996 to 2001. The alliance was formed in the aftermath of the collapse of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and the subsequent rise of the Taliban.\n\n## Background\n\nDuring the early 1990s, the Najibullah regime, an ethnic Pashtun, began to mistrust the mostly non-Pashtun militias in the north, many of whom had ties to Ahmad Shah Massoud. In an effort to reassert his control over the supply lines in the North, Najibullah replaced General Abdul Momim, an ethnic Tajik, with General Rasul, a Pashtun Khalqi known for being the brutal commander of Pul-e-Charkhi. Momim refused to step down, he and ethnic Uzbek, General Rashid Dostum defected and allied with Ahmad Shah Massoud and Ali Mazari forming the Northern Alliance.\n\n## Reestablishment of the United Front\n\nAhmad Shah Massoud and Abdul Rashid Dostum, former allies and enemies, recreated a United Front (Northern Alliance) against the Taliban that were preparing offensives against the remaining areas under the control of Massoud and those under the control of Dostum. The United Front included beside the dominantly Tajik forces of Massoud and the Uzbek forces of Dostum, Hazara troops led by Haji Mohammad Mohaqiq and Pashtun forces under the leadership of commanders such as Abdul Haq and Haji Abdul Qadir. Notable politicians and diplomats of the United Front included Abdul Rahim Ghafoorzai, Abdullah Abdullah, and Masood Khalili.\n\n## Foreign Intervention\n\nThroughout the 1990s, Iran was the primary state sponsor of the Northern Alliance, along with India and Russia. By contrast, the Taliban were supported by Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. Because of Indian influence in the Alliance, Pakistan feared a Northern Alliance victory would result in Pakistan's encirclement by India on one side and an Indian-allied Northern Alliance on the other. During the 1990s, Turkey also supported the Northern Alliance. Israel was initially not critical of the Taliban, as both governments opposed Iran, and the Mossad reached out to the Taliban. However, later, under pressure from United States and Turkey, Israel instead began reaching out to the Northern Alliance, even though it remained suspicious of the Alliance's pro-Iran position.\n\n## History\n\nThe Northern Alliance fought against the Taliban from 1996 to 2001. During this period, the Taliban committed systematic massacres against civilians in an effort to consolidate control over northern and western Afghanistan. The United Nations reported that there had been \"15 massacres\" between 1996 and 2001, and that these had been \"highly systematic and they all lead back to the Taliban Ministry of Defense or to Mullah Omar himself.\" Al-Qaeda's so-called 055 Brigade was also responsible for mass-killings of Afghan civilians.\n\n## Post 9/11\n\nAfter the September 11 attacks in the United States in 2001, the United Front succeeded in retaking Kabul from the Taliban with air support from US-led forces during Operation Enduring Freedom. Despite fears of a return to the chaos similar to that of the 1992-1996 civil war, all the Afghan leaders met in Germany to create a new government. Hamid Karzai was chosen to lead the country and most key positions were given to Tajik members of the Northern Alliance.\n\n## Legacy\n\nBetween 1996 and 2001, the Northern Alliance blocked the Taliban and al-Qaeda from gaining control of the entirety of Afghanistan. Many internally displaced persons found shelter in areas controlled by Ahmad Shah Massoud. After the September 2001 attacks in the United States, US air raids followed by ground troops of the United Front ousted the Taliban from power in Kabul. Between November and December 2001, the United Front gained control of most major Afghan cities. Had it not been for the United Front, the US would have needed to deploy large numbers of ground troops, as was done in the Iraq War.\n\n## Reformation\n\nThe National Front of Afghanistan, which was created by Ahmad Zia Massoud, Abdul Rashid Dostum, and Mohammad Mohaqiq in late 2011 to oppose peace talks with the Taliban, is generally considered as a reformation of the military wing of the United Front. Meanwhile, much of the political wing has reunited under the National Coalition of Afghanistan led by Abdullah Abdullah.\n\n## 2021 Resurgence\n\nFollowing a takeover of Kabul and much of Afghanistan by the Taliban in 2021, the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan, led by Ahmad Massoud, son of late Afghan politician Ahmad Shah Massoud, and Vice President Amrullah Saleh started gathering strength in the Panjshir Valley. The flag of the 'Northern Alliance' or the United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan was hoisted for the first time since 2001 in the Panjshir Valley, signalling their return.\n\n## Human Rights Issues\n\nThe human rights situation during combat was heavily dependent on the specific commander and his troops. The situation for different leaders and their troops of the United Front thus shows sharp contrasts. Also, the quality of life of the Afghan population was heavily dependent on the specific leader that was directly controlling the area in which they lived. Sharp contrasts could also be witnessed regarding life and structures in those areas.\n\nThe area under Ahmad Shah Massoud's control, including the Panjshir Valley, some other parts of Parwan, and Thakhar province, was considered to be relatively safe for civilians. Some parts of Badakshan were also under his influence, while others were controlled by Burhanuddin Rabbani.\n\nThe area under Abdul Rashid Dostum's control, including Samangan, Balkh, Jowzjan, Faryab, and Baghlan provinces, was considered to be relatively violent and prone to human rights abuses. According to Human Rights Watch, many of the violations of international humanitarian law committed by the United Front forces date from 1996-1998, when Dostum controlled most of the north.\n\nDancing boys, a regional custom known as bacha bazi (boy play), were also prevalent in the areas under the control of the Northern Alliance. Commanders and other members of the Northern Alliance sexually abused dancing boys they and their friends owned. This practice was downplayed and covered up by United States and Afghan authorities.\n\nThe legacy of the Northern Alliance is complex and multifaceted. On the one hand, the alliance played a crucial role in blocking the Taliban and al-Qaeda from gaining control of Afghanistan. On the other hand, the alliance was also responsible for human rights abuses and other negative activities.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Northern_Alliance\" following this outline:\n\n\nCommanders and factions\nThe United Front was formed in late 1996 against the Taliban government by opposition factions Since early 1999, Ahmad Shah Massoud was the only main leader able to defend his territory against the Taliban, and as such remained as the main de facto political and military leader of the United Front recognized by members of all the different ethnic groups Massoud decided on the main political line and the general military strategy of the alliance A part of the United Front military factions, such as Junbish-i Milli or Hezb-e Wahdat, however, did not fall under the direct control of Massoud but remained under their respective regional or ethnic leaders.\n\n\nHeadquarters\nInitially, the city of Mazar-i-Sharif under Dostum's control served as one of the Northern Alliance's headquarters, until the city was overrun in 1997 Under Massoud's control, Taloqan in Takhar Province, north of Panjshir, was the group's headquarters until September 5, 2000, when the city was taken by the Taliban [11] and led to its base moving to Badakhshan Province [3] Massoud also maintained a private residence in Dushanbe, Tajikistan It was there where Massoud would meet international diplomatic staff who supported the Northern Alliance [12]\n\n\nHistory\nDuring the early 1990s the Najibullah regime funded pro government militias all over the country in order to fight the mujahedeen insurgency however Najibullah, an ethnic Pashtun began to mistrust the mostly non-Pashtun militias in the north many of whom had ties to Ahmad Shah

parts of Parwan, Kunar, Nuristan, Laghman, Samangan, Kunduz, Ghōr and Bamyan.\n\n\nForeign intervention\nThroughout the 1990s, Iran was the primary state sponsor of the Northern Alliance, [27] along with India and Russia By contrast, the Taliban were supported by Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the UAE [28] Because of Indian influence in the Alliance, Pakistan feared a Northern Alliance victory would

began reaching out to the Northern Alliance, even though it remained suspicious of the Alliance's pro-Iran position [33]\n\n\nTaliban massacres\nAccording to a 55-page report by the United Nations, the Taliban, while trying to consolidate control over northern and western Afghanistan, committed systematic massacres against civilians [56] [57] UN officials stated that there had been \"15 massacres\" between 1996 and 2001 [56] [57] They also said, that \" [t]hese have been highly systematic and they all lead back to the  [Taliban] Ministry of Defense or to Mullah Omar himself\" [56]

\"carrying long knives used for slitting throats and skinning people\" [56] [57]\n\n\nAhmad Shah Massoud\nAfter longstanding battles especially for the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif, Abdul Rashid Dostum and his Junbish-i Milli forces alongside allied Hezb-e Wahdat forces were defeated by the Taliban and their allies in 1998 Dostum subsequently went into exile Ahmad Shah Massoud remained the only major anti-Taliban leader inside the country who was able to defend vast parts of his territory against the Pakistani Army, the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, not once leaving Afghanistan except for diplomatic purposes [58] [59]\n\n\nPost 9/11\nAfter the September 11 attacks in the United States in 2001, the United Front succeeded in retaking Kabul from the Taliban with air support from US-led

Karzai was chosen to lead the country and most key positions were given to Tajik members of the Northern Alliance This created a major international issue While Pakistan has always favored Afghanistan's major ethnic group, the Pashtun, India saw an opportunity for increasing its regional power by jumping on board with the support of the Northern Alliance in the early days of the war [71] With both nations seeking to increase or maintain their regional power through opposing factions on the ground, observers came to view the conflict in Afghanistan as a proxy-war between the two state powers [72] [73]\n\n\nLegacy\nBetween 1996 and 2001, the Northern Alliance blocked the Taliban and al-Qaeda from gaining control of the entirety of Afghanistan Many internally displaced persons

After a string of disappointing performances in the 2018 FIFA World Cup, where they lost to eventual champions France in the first knockout round, and the 2019 Copa América, where they finished third, newly appointed coach Lionel Scaloni led Argentina to their first international title since 1993 by defeating title holders Brazil 1–0 in the 2021 Copa América final and handing captain Lionel Messi his first senior international title. After winning the 2022 Finalissima, beating European champions Italy 3–0, Argentina entered Qatar as one of the favourites to win.\n\n**Venue**\n\nThe final was played at Lusail Stadium in Lusail, Qatar, located about 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) north of the city centre of Doha. The stadium was intended to host the final as part of Qatar's World Cup bid, and was confirmed as the final venue on 15 July 2020. The stadium was allocated to also host nine previous World Cup matches, with six in the group stage and three other knockout fixtures.\n\n**Route to the final**\n\nDrawn in group C and coming off a three-year, 36-game-long unbeaten streak, Argentina were defeated in their opening game 2–1 by Saudi Arabia. However, the Argentines bounced back from the shock loss to overcome Mexico 2–0 after a long-range effort by Messi who then assisted Enzo Fernández for the second, reigniting their World Cup hopes. Boosted by the win, Argentina then beat Poland with the same scoreline with goals from Alexis Mac Allister and Julián Álvarez despite a first-half penalty miss from Messi, taking first place in Group C and condemning both Mexico and Saudi Arabia to World Cup elimination.\n\n**Argentina**\n\nDrawn in group C and coming off a three-year, 36-game-long unbeaten streak, Argentina were defeated in their opening game 2–1 by Saudi Arabia.

Boosted by the win, Argentina then beat Poland with the same scoreline with goals from Alexis Mac Allister and Julián Álvarez despite a first-half penalty miss from Messi, taking first place in Group C and condemning both Mexico and Saudi Arabia to World Cup elimination.\n\n**France**\n\nFrance started their World Cup campaign as the defending world champions, having won the most recent tournament in Russia, and was drawn in group D. Their first meeting was against AFC representative Australia. The French suffered a shock deficit after nine minutes due to a goal by Craig Goodwin, but were able to stage a comeback with a double from Olivier Giroud together with goals from Adrien Rabiot and Kylian Mbappé to win 4–1. Empowered by the win, France overcame a highly organised and threatening Denmark side with Mbappé striking twice in the second half, despite conceding an equaliser from Andreas Christensen France won 2–1 and became the first team to progress to the knockout stage of the World Cup in Qatar and the first European world champions to do so since 1994. With progression assured, France rotated most of their team, resting their key players for the final game against a desperate Tunisia; France resultantly lost 1–0 courtesy of a goal by French-born Wahbi Khazri before having an equaliser by Antoine Griezmann disallowed France maintained top of the group due to a superior goal difference over Australia.\n\n**Pre-match**\n\nPolish referee Szymon Marciniak was named as the referee of the final on 15 December 2022, with fellow Poles Paweł Sokolnicki and Tomasz Listkiewicz appointed as assistant referees. Marciniak became a FIFA referee in 2011 and had previously served as a referee at the UEFA Euro 2016 and 2018 FIFA World Cup, as well as during the 2018 UEFA Super Cup. Earlier in the tournament, Marciniak officiated the France–Denmark group stage game, as well as the Argentina–Australia match in the round of 16. It was the first time that a Polish referee led the team of officials at a World Cup final, and the second time that a Polish referee was included among the officials during such a match, after Michał Listkiewicz (father of Marciniak's assistant Tomasz) served as a linesman during the 1990 FIFA World Cup final.\n\n**Match**\n\nFrance kicked off the match at 18:00 local time (15:00 UTC) in front of a crowd of 88,966. Argentina were awarded a penalty in the 23rd minute when Ángel Di María was fouled in the penalty area by Ousmane Dembélé as Di María cut in from the left. Lionel Messi scored the penalty with a low shot to the right corner. In the 36th minute, Di Maria finished a sweeping Argentina counter-attack to make it 2–0, shooting with his left foot over the goalkeeper to the right corner of the net after a pass from Alexis Mac Allister from the right. France made two early substitutions near the end of the first half and went into half-time trailing 0–2.\n\n**First half**\n\nFrance kicked off the match at 18:00 local time (15:00 UTC) in front of a crowd of 88,966. Argentina were awarded a penalty in the 23rd minute when Ángel Di María was fouled in the penalty area by Ousmane Dembélé as Di María cut in from the left. Lionel Messi scored the penalty with a low shot to the right corner. In the 36th minute, Di Maria finished a sweeping Argentina counter-attack to make it 2–0, shooting with his left foot over the goalkeeper to the right corner of the net after a pass from Alexis Mac Allister from the right. France made two early substitutions near the end of the first half and went into half-time trailing 0–2.\n\n**Second half**\n\nArgentina were on course for the win, controlling possession, and defensively shutting down France, who failed to make an attempt on goal until the 80th minute, at which point France was awarded a penalty after Randal Kolo Muani was brought down in the penalty area by Nicolás Otamendi. Kylian Mbappé scored the penalty low to the left corner, despite Emiliano Martínez getting a hand on the ball, making the game 2–1. 97 seconds later, Kingsley Coman tackled Messi right as the game restarted, starting a rapid counter-attack which finished with Mbappé first-time volleying a lofted pass from Marcus Thuram with his right foot as he was falling to the ground to the bottom-right corner of the net to make the game 2–2; Martínez again attempted to parry the ball but couldn't keep it out. Five minutes after Mbappé's equalizer, Thuram went down in the penalty box after slightly tripping on Enzo Fernández's leg, only to be booked for diving. Both teams came close to finishing the game near the end of added time as Adrien Rabiot fired a quick shot inside the box, forcing a fumbling save from Emiliano Martínez; then three minutes later Messi had a hard shot parried over the bar by Hugo Lloris. With the score tied at the end of regulation time, the match went to extra time.\n\n**Extra time**\n\nAfter first half of extra time finished goalless, notably highlighted by two one-on-one opportunities missed by Lautaro Martínez, Messi scored again for Argentina in the second period of extra time when he finished from close range after Lloris had parried a shot from Lautaro Martínez on the right, in what seemed to be the winning goal. However, France was awarded a second penalty in the 118th minute after a shot by Mbappé hit the arm of Gonzalo Montiel. Mbappé scored his third goal with his penalty kick to the left, sending Martínez the wrong way and becoming the second player to score a hat-trick in a men's World Cup final after Geoff Hurst for England in 1966. In the 123rd minute, with 15 seconds of the extra time to spare, a loose ball fell to an unmarked Kolo Muani at the edge of the box, who shot low to the right of the goal; however, Emiliano Martínez blocked the shot with his left shin. Argentina counter-attacked immediately, ending with Lautaro Martínez heading wide of the goal from 10 yards. France produced one last attack when Mbappé dribbled in the penalty box, passing three Argentina defenders, only for Paulo Dybala to make a timely clearance off the field. The referee then blew the final whistle of extra time and the match went to a penalty shoot-out.\n\n**Penalty shoot-out**\n\nThis was the third time the World Cup final would be decided on penalties. Mbappé and Messi successfully converted the first two attempts to begin the penalty shootout at 1–1. Argentina goalkeeper Martínez would continue to use the psychological tactics and means of gamesmanship that he utilized during the penalty shoot-outs in the quarter-final against the Netherlands. After delaying Kingsley Coman's attempt by arguing with the referee, Martínez then saved Coman's shot, which was down low to Martínez's right. Dybala sent a shot into the net up the middle to give Argentina a 2–1 lead. Before Aurélien Tchouaméni's shot, Martínez picked up the ball and then threw it to the edge of the box. Tchouaméni then sent his shot wide of the goal to the left. Leandro Paredes then scored to put France on the brink of defeat at 3–1. Kolo Muani kept France alive by scoring his chance and reducing France's deficit to 3–2; Martínez attempted to use his psychological tactics on Kolo Muani but was instead shown a yellow card. Montiel was then given a chance to make up for his late handball by clinching the championship for Argentina. Montiel scored low to the left, securing the 4–2 penalty shoot-out victory for Argentina and giving them their third World Cup trophy and first since 1986.\n\n**Details**\n\nMan of the Match: Lionel Messi (Argentina)\n\n**Statistics**\n\nPundits, commentators, and audiences praised the intensity, stressful atmosphere, and thrilling back-and-forth nature of the match, highlighting the number of goals scored, and with many media outlets spotlighting it as a duel between Paris Saint-Germain teammates Messi and Mbappé.

on the platform [13] Previously, only Roblox administrators had the ability to sell accessories, body parts, gear, and packages under the official Roblox user account, [30] with virtual hats and accessories also being able to be published by a select few users with past experience working with Roblox Corporation [31] [32] This arrangement was in place until the introduction of the UGC Catalog, [33] [34] which allowed selected individuals within the Roblox community to create and sell customized user-generated content (UGC) avatar items through the UGC Program [35] [36] [37] Several individuals design items as a full-time job, with the highest-earning creators making over $100,000 a year off item sales [38]\n\n\nScams\nA sizable amount of scams relate to Roblox, largely revolving around automated messages promoting scam websites, scam games designed to appear to give out free Robux, and invalid Robux codes [49] [18] In the Roblox community, there are people known as \"beamers\" who compromise Roblox accounts to steal and sell their items on black markets They employ various techniques, such as creating phishing websites or ploys to acquire a victim's login token [50] Once they gain access to the victim's account, these \"beamers\" steal and subsequently sell valuable limited items owned by the victims for real-world currency or cryptocurrency through marketplace sites or Discord chatrooms The slang term \"beaming\" is commonly used to describe this entire process, along with the victim having been \"beamed\" Roblox does offer hacking victims a \"rollback\" for their items, although this is only offered once per account [40]\n\n\nEvents\nRoblox occasionally hosts real-life and virtual events They have in the past hosted events such as BloxCon, which was a convention for ordinary players on the platform [45] Roblox operates annual Easter egg hunts [51] and also hosts an annual event called the \"Bloxy Awards\", an awards ceremony that also functions as a fundraiser The 2020 edition of the Bloxy Awards, held virtually on the platform, drew 600,000 viewers [52] [53] In 2022, \"Bloxy Awards\" got rebranded into the \"Roblox Innovation Awards\" [54] Roblox Corporation annually hosts the Roblox Developers Conference, a three-day invite-only event in San Francisco where top content creators on the site learn of upcoming changes to the platform [55] The company has also hosted similar events in London and Amsterdam [56] [57]\n\n\nHistory\nThe beta version of Roblox was created by co-founders David Baszucki and Erik Cassel in 2004 under the name DynaBlocks [69] Baszucki started testing the first demos that year [70] In 2005, the company changed its name to Roblox [70]\n\n\n2004–2005\nThe beta version of Roblox

[70]\n\n\n2006–2013\nRoblox officially launched on September 1, 2006 [2] In March 2007, Roblox became compliant with COPPA through the addition of safe chat, a change that limited the communication ability of users under the age of 13 by restricting them to selecting predefined messages from a menu [71] In August, Roblox applied server improvements and released a premium membership service named \"Builders Club\", [72] which was rebranded as Roblox Premium in September 2019 [73] In December 2011, Roblox held its first Hack Week, an annual event where Roblox developers work on outside-the-box ideas for new developments to present to the company [74] [75] On December 11, 2012, an iOS version of Roblox was released [4] On October 1, 2013, Roblox released its Developer Exchange program, allowing developers to exchange Robux earned from their games into real-world currencies [76]\n\n\n2014–2017\nOn July 16, 2014, an Android version was released [5] On May 31, 2015, a feature called Smooth Terrain was added, increasing the graphical fidelity of in-game terrain and changing the Roblox physics engine from a block-oriented style to a smoother and more realistic one [77] On November 20, Roblox was launched on Xbox One, with an initial selection of 15 games chosen by Roblox staff [6] Support for the publishing of Roblox games for Xbox One was later rolled out to all users, subject to an approval process based on Entertainment Software Ratings Board standards [78]\n\n\n2018–2023\nIn November 2018, the ability for a player to play as a \"guest\", without an account, which had been progressively restricted over the previous two years, was removed entirely [84] In July 2020, Roblox announced the creation of \"Party Place\", which functions as an online hangout The feature was created using new technology that had been used during the 2020 Bloxy Awards and was designed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic [85] Roblox was granted permission to release in China on December 3, 2020 [86]\n\n\n2024–present\nIn March 2024, two generative artificial intelligence tools were introduced to Roblox Studio in an effort to speed up content creation: automatic avatar customization and a texture generator The avatar customization feature automatically converts three-dimensional body meshes into live-animated avatars, and the texture generator allows users to create textures of objects using text descriptions through a text-to-image model [96] [97]\n\n\nCommunity and culture\nUsers of Roblox have been noted for their efforts against racism, with numerous regular users and co-founder Baszucki having declared their support for the George Floyd protests and Black Lives Matter [98] [99] In August 2019, an investigation by NBC News revealed over 100 accounts linked to far-right and neo-Nazi groups After being contacted about the accounts by NBC, Roblox moderators removed them [100]\n\n\nActivism\nUsers of Roblox have been noted for their efforts against

revealed over 100 accounts linked to far-right and neo-Nazi groups After being contacted about the accounts by NBC, Roblox moderators removed them [100]\n\n\nEffects of the COVID-19 pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected Roblox in numerous ways Due to quarantines imposed by the pandemic limiting social interaction, Roblox was being used as a way for children to communicate with each other [101] One of the most noted ways that this method of communication is being carried out is the phenomenon of birthday parties being held on the platform [102] [103] COVID-19 has caused a substantial increase in both the platform's revenue and the number of players on it, in line with similar effects experienced by the majority of the gaming industry, as players forced to remain indoors due to COVID-19 lockdowns spent more time playing video games [104] [105]\n\n\n\"Oof\" sound effect\nFrom its release until November 2020, Roblox's sound effect for when a character dies was a sound commonly transcribed and titled as \"oof\", which became a substantial part of the platform's reputation due to its status as a meme [108] The sound was originally produced by Joey Kuras [109] for the studio of video game composer Tommy Tallarico for the video game Messiah produced in 2000 This caused the two to enter a copyright dispute, which ended in 2022 when Roblox pulled the sound from their platform and replaced it with a new one [110] [111]\n\n\nReception and revenue\nDue to its status as a user-created games platform, Roblox has a variety of popular games As of May 2020, the most popular games on Roblox had over 10 million monthly active players each As of August 2020, at least 20 games had been played more than one billion times, and at least 5,000 have been played more than one million times [112] TechCrunch noted in March 2021 that Roblox games are largely distinct from established traditions in free-to-play video games, finding that successful Roblox games were geared towards immediate satisfaction, and finding that the addition of tutorials significantly decreased player engagement, contrary to established wisdom about free-to-play games [113] Companies have used Roblox as a platform for advergames promoting their products [114] [115] [116]\n\n\nGames\nDue to its status as a user-created games platform, Roblox has a variety of popular games As of May

Companies have used Roblox as a platform for advergames promoting their products [114] [115] [116]\n\n\nRevenue\nDuring the 2017 Roblox Developers Conference, officials said that creators on the game platform, of which there were about 1.7 million as of 2017, [117] collectively earned at least $30 million in 2017 [118] The iOS version of Roblox passed $1 billion of lifetime revenue in November 2019, [119] $1.5 billion in June 2020, [120] and $2 billion in October 2020, [121] making it the iOS app with the second-highest revenue [11] Several individual games on Roblox have accumulated revenues of over $10 million, [122] while developers as a whole on the platform were collectively projected to have earned around $250 million over the course of 2020 [123] It became the third highest-grossing game of 2020, with a revenue of $2.29 billion, below the Tencent titles PUBG and Honor of Kings [124]\n\n\nCritical reception\nRoblox has generally received positive reviews [citation needed] Common Sense Media gave it 4 out of 5 stars, praising the website's variety of games and ability to encourage creativity in children while finding that the decentralized nature of the platform meant game quality varied, and recommended disabling chat functions for young players to prevent possibly harmful interactions [125] Patricia E Vance of the Family Online Safety Institute advised parents to monitor their child's interactions on the platform but praised the platform for \"...allowing kids to play, explore, socialize, create and learn in a self-directed way\", and granting special praise to Roblox Studio for its ability to encourage children to experience game development [126] Trusted Reviews, in its overview of the platform, also praised Roblox Studio, stating that \"for anyone seeking to develop their computer science skills, or create projects that will instantly receive feedback from a huge audience, the appeal is obvious\" [127] Craig Hurda, writing in Android Guys, gave a more moderate review, praising the number of games available and finding that the game was entertaining for children, while also finding that the platform's audio was \"hit-or-miss\" and declaring that it had limited appeal for adult players [128]\n\n\nRestrictions by country\nRoblox is banned in seven countries: China, Guatemala, Jordan, North Korea, Oman, Turkey, [129] and the United Arab Emirates [130] [unreliable source?] China has banned Roblox due to its American origin and perceived anti-communist propaganda, aiming to protect Chinese children from anti-communist influences Instead, Roblox Corporation released a Chinese version of Roblox, called Luobulesi (Chinese: 罗布乐思), in 2021, [131] [132] [better source needed] which was later shut down in 2022 [133] Guatemala has banned Roblox because the gaming platform violates laws and regulations regarding the safety and protection of children and adolescents Jordan has banned Roblox due to concerns about foul language, scamming, and hacking, which it claims can harm children during puberty North Korea has banned Roblox because the game allows users to chat with others worldwide, violating its laws on isolation Oman has banned Roblox due to explicit and inappropriate content, along with concerns about hacking and scamming Turkey has banned Roblox because the platform contains content that may lead to gambling and child sexual abuse [129] [134] [135] The United Arab Emirates has banned Roblox out of fear that the game, targeted towards kids, may contain inappropriate content [130]\n\n\nCriticism and controversies\nRoblox has received widespread criticism for its chat filtration system [137] [138] Although Roblox's filtration system, Community Sift, [139] censors and removes most inappropriate messages and content, it is possible to avoid the system, for example by using third-party chat apps [138] To combat these issues, Roblox has 1,600 people working to remove such content from the platform [137] Roblox offers privacy settings; parents can limit what people a user can contact, restrict access to private servers, and turn on parental controls [140]\n\n\nInappropriate content and predatory behavior\nRoblox has received widespread criticism for its chat filtration system [137] [138] Although Roblox's filtration system, Community Sift, [139] censors and removes most inappropriate messages and content, it is possible to avoid the system, for example by using third-party chat apps [138] To combat these issues, Roblox has 1,600 people working to remove such content from the platform [137] Roblox offers privacy settings; parents can limit what people a user can contact, restrict access to private servers, and turn on parental controls [140]\n\n\nAccusations of encouraging consumerism\nRoblox has been criticized for making it easy for children to spend large sums of money through microtransactions, leading to numerous instances where children have spent large sums of money on the platform without parents' knowledge, [148] [149] and deleting the accounts of players who file chargebacks or request refunds for Robux payments through their banks, card issuers or other third-party companies [150] Professor Jane Juffer at Cornell University accused Roblox of encouraging consumerism in children [151]\n\n\nExtremism\nIn May 2021, researcher Daniel Kelley of the Anti-Defamation League reported that numerous games on Roblox have recreated mass shootings, and criticized its moderation team for being unable to moderate them An example of this were three different games that simulated the Christchurch mosque shootings Later that year in June, Cecilia D'Anastasio of Wired reported that numerous groups and games on Roblox that simulated real-world military units and regimes including the Wehrmacht An example that was provided was Innsbruck Border Simulator, a game that had players play as Nazis, was reported to have gained over a million plays before being deleted by the Roblox team [153] [154] In 2023, Gamesindustry.biz reported that congresswoman Lori Trahan criticized numerous video game companies for failing to address questions on how to combat online extremism, but noted Roblox to be an exception, with them claiming to have a team dedicated to moderating extremist content Gamesindustry.biz, however, mentioned the company being criticized in the past for being unable to moderate games that recreated real world shootings [155]\n\n\nAlleged exploitative practices towards children\nRoblox has been accused by the investigative journalism YouTube channel People Make Games of \"exploiting\" child game developers by promising them huge amounts of money when they monetize their games, while only giving them little to no money in return by having high revenue cuts, an exchange rate in selling Robux lower than the rate for buying Robux, and lack of methods to make their games easily discoverable This was likened to company scrip [156] [157] In a discussion with Axios, Roblox's chief product officer (CPO) Manuel Bronstein responded by saying that Roblox intends to give more money to its community developers [158]\n\n\nKardashian-Roblox scandal\nThe series premiere of The Kardashians, which debuted on April 14, 2022, titled \"Burn Them All to the F*cking Ground\", led to a public feud between Kim Kardashian and Roblox [162] [163] In the episode, Kim's son Saint West shows his mother an experience on the platform from a tablet that depicts an image of Kim crying [163] She claimed, however, that the person who uploaded the experience had also obtained footage of her and Ray J's sex tape, [162] and that she reacted by crying and claiming to later sue the company [164] The veracity of this incident has been questioned, as Roblox's filters do not allow the words \"sex tape\" or variant spellings, and because given that Roblox had about 11.1 million experiences at the time, the chances that Saint West would randomly stumble upon an experience promoting her sex tape are very small [163]\n\n\nToy lines\nIn January 2017, toy fabricator Jazwares partnered with Roblox Corporation to produce toy minifigures based on user-generated content created by developers on the platform [168] The minifigures have limbs and joints similar to that of Lego minifigures, though they are about twice the size [169] The minifigures have limbs and accessories that are interchangeable The sets included a code that was used to redeem virtual items, as well as blind boxes that contained random minifigures [170] [171] In 2019, Jazwares released a new line of toys, branded as the \"Roblox Desktop\" series [172] On April 13, 2021, Roblox partnered with Hasbro to release Roblox-themed Nerf blasters and a Roblox-themed Monopoly edition [173]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "# Roblox\nRoblox

December 3, 2020 [86]\n\n\n2024–present\nIn March 2024, two generative artificial intelligence tools were introduced to Roblox Studio in an effort to speed up content creation: automatic avatar customization and a texture generator The avatar customization feature automatically converts three-dimensional body meshes into live-animated avatars, and the texture generator allows users to create textures of objects using text descriptions through a text-to-image model [96] [97]\n\n\nCommunity and culture\nUsers of Roblox have been noted for their efforts against racism, with numerous regular users and co-founder Baszucki having declared their support for the George Floyd protests and Black Lives Matter [98] [99] In August 2019, an investigation by NBC News revealed over 100 accounts linked to far-right and neo-Nazi groups After being contacted about the accounts by NBC, Roblox moderators removed them [100]\n\n\nActivism\nUsers of Roblox have been noted for their efforts against racism, with numerous regular users and co-founder Baszucki having declared their support for the George Floyd protests and Black Lives Matter [98] [99] In August 2019, an investigation by NBC News revealed over 100 accounts linked to far-right and neo-Nazi groups After being contacted about the accounts by NBC, Roblox moderators removed them [100]\n\n\nEffects of the COVID-19 pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected Roblox in numerous ways Due to quarantines imposed by the pandemic limiting social interaction, Roblox was being used as a way for children to communicate with each other [101] One of the most noted ways that this method of communication is being carried out is the phenomenon of birthday parties being held on the platform [102] [103] COVID-19 has caused a substantial increase in both the platform's revenue and the number of players on it, in line with similar effects experienced by the majority of the gaming industry, as players forced to remain indoors due to COVID-19 lockdowns spent more time playing video games [104] [105]\n\n\n\"Oof\" sound effect\nFrom its release until November 2020, Roblox's sound effect for when a character dies was a sound commonly transcribed and titled as \"oof\", which became a substantial part of the platform's reputation due to its status as a meme [108] The sound was originally produced by Joey Kuras [109] for the studio of video game composer Tommy Tallarico for the video game Messiah produced in 2000 This caused the two to enter a copyright dispute, which ended in 2022 when Roblox pulled the sound from their platform and replaced it with a new one [110] [111]\n\n\nReception and revenue\nDue to its status as a user-created games platform, Roblox has a variety of popular games As of May 2020, the most popular games on Roblox had over 10 million monthly active players each As of August 2020, at least 20 games had been played more than one billion times, and at least 5,000 have been played more than one million times [112] TechCrunch noted in March 2021 that Roblox games are largely distinct from established traditions in free-to-play video games, finding that successful Roblox games were geared towards immediate satisfaction, and finding that the addition of tutorials significantly decreased player engagement, contrary to established wisdom about free-to-play games [113] Companies have used Roblox as a platform for advergames promoting their products [114] [115] [116]\n\n\nGames\nDue to its status as a user-created games platform, Roblox has a variety of popular games As of May

Companies have used Roblox as a platform for advergames promoting their products [114] [115] [116]\n\n\nRevenue\nDuring the 2017 Roblox Developers Conference, officials said that creators on the game platform, of which there were about 1.7 million as of 2017, [117] collectively earned at least $30 million in 2017 [118] The iOS version of Roblox passed $1 billion of lifetime revenue in November 2019, [119] $1.5 billion in June 2020, [120] and $2 billion in October 2020, [121] making it the iOS app with the second-highest revenue [11] Several individual games on Roblox have accumulated revenues of over $10 million, [122] while developers as a whole on the platform were collectively projected to have earned around $250 million over the course of 2020 [123] It became the third highest-grossing game of 2020, with a revenue of $2.29 billion, below the Tencent titles PUBG and Honor of Kings [124]\n\n\nCritical reception\nRoblox has generally received positive reviews [citation needed] Common Sense Media gave it 4 out of 5 stars, praising the website's variety of games and ability to encourage creativity in children while finding that the decentralized nature of the platform meant game quality varied, and recommended disabling chat functions for young players to prevent possibly harmful interactions [125] Patricia E Vance of the Family Online Safety Institute advised parents to monitor their child's interactions on the platform but praised the platform for \"...allowing kids to play, explore, socialize, create and learn in a self-directed way\", and granting special praise to Roblox Studio for its ability to encourage children to experience game development [126] Trusted Reviews, in its overview of the platform, also praised Roblox Studio, stating that \"for anyone seeking to develop their computer science skills, or create projects that will instantly receive feedback from a huge audience, the appeal is obvious\" [127] Craig Hurda, writing in Android Guys, gave a more moderate review, praising the number of games available and finding that the game was entertaining for children, while also finding that the platform's audio was \"hit-or-miss\" and declaring that it had limited appeal for adult players [128]\n\n\nRestrictions by country\nRoblox is banned in seven countries: China, Guatemala, Jordan, North Korea, Oman, Turkey, [129] and the United Arab Emirates [130] [unreliable source?] China has banned Roblox due to its American origin and perceived anti-communist propaganda, aiming to protect Chinese children from anti-communist influences Instead, Roblox Corporation released a Chinese version of Roblox, called Luobulesi (Chinese: 罗布乐思), in 2021, [131] [132] [better source needed] which was later shut down in 2022 [133] Guatemala has banned Roblox because the gaming platform violates laws and regulations regarding the safety and protection of children and adolescents Jordan has banned Roblox due to concerns about foul language, scamming, and hacking, which it claims can harm children during puberty North Korea has banned Roblox because the game allows users to chat with others worldwide, violating its laws on isolation Oman has banned Roblox due to explicit and inappropriate content, along with concerns about hacking and scamming Turkey has banned Roblox because the platform contains content that may lead to gambling and child sexual abuse [129] [134] [135] The United Arab Emirates has banned Roblox out of fear that the game, targeted towards kids, may contain inappropriate content [130]\n\n\nCriticism and controversies\nRoblox has received widespread criticism for its chat filtration system [137] [138] Although Roblox's filtration system, Community Sift, [139] censors and removes most inappropriate messages and content, it is possible to avoid the system, for example by using third-party chat apps [138] To combat these issues, Roblox has 1,600 people working to remove such content from the platform [137] Roblox offers privacy settings; parents can limit what people a user can contact, restrict access to private servers, and turn on parental controls [140]\n\n\nInappropriate content and predatory behavior\nRoblox has received widespread criticism for its chat filtration system [137] [138] Although Roblox's filtration system, Community Sift, [139] censors and removes most inappropriate messages and content, it is possible to avoid the system, for example by using third-party chat apps [138] To combat these issues, Roblox has 1,600 people working to remove such content from the platform [137] Roblox offers privacy settings; parents can limit what people a user can contact, restrict access to private servers, and turn on parental controls [140]\n\n\nAccusations of encouraging consumerism\nRoblox has been criticized for making it easy for children to spend large sums of money through microtransactions, leading to numerous instances where children have spent large sums of money on the platform without parents' knowledge, [148] [149] and deleting the accounts of players who file chargebacks or request refunds for Robux payments through their banks, card issuers or other third-party companies [150] Professor Jane Juffer at Cornell University accused Roblox of encouraging consumerism in children [151]\n\n\nExtremism\nIn May 2021, researcher Daniel Kelley of the Anti-Defamation League reported that numerous games on Roblox have recreated mass shootings, and criticized its moderation team for being unable to moderate them An example of this were three different games that simulated the Christchurch mosque shootings Later that year in June, Cecilia D'Anastasio of Wired reported that numerous groups and games on Roblox that simulated real-world military units and regimes including the Wehrmacht An example that was provided was Innsbruck Border Simulator, a game that had players play as Nazis, was reported to have gained over a million plays before being deleted by the Roblox team [153] [154] In 2023, Gamesindustry.biz reported that congresswoman Lori Trahan criticized numerous video game companies for failing to address questions on how to combat online extremism, but noted Roblox to be an exception, with them claiming to have a team dedicated to moderating extremist content Gamesindustry.biz, however, mentioned the company being criticized in the past for being unable to moderate games that recreated real world shootings [155]\n\n\nAlleged exploitative practices towards children\nRoblox has been accused by the investigative journalism YouTube channel People Make Games of \"exploiting\" child game developers by promising them huge amounts of money when they monetize their games, while only giving them little to no money in return by having high revenue cuts, an exchange rate in selling Robux lower than the rate for buying Robux, and lack of methods to make their games easily discoverable This was likened to company scrip [156] [157] In a discussion with Axios, Roblox's chief product officer (CPO) Manuel Bronstein responded by saying that Roblox intends to give more money to its community developers [158]\n\n\nKardashian-Roblox scandal\nThe series premiere of The Kardashians, which debuted on April 14, 2022, titled \"Burn Them All to the F*cking Ground\", led to a public feud between Kim Kardashian and Roblox [162] [163] In the episode, Kim's son Saint West shows his mother an experience on the platform from a tablet that depicts an image of Kim crying [163] She claimed, however, that the person who uploaded the experience had also obtained footage of her and Ray J's sex tape, [162] and that she reacted by crying and claiming to later sue the company [164] The veracity of this incident has been questioned, as Roblox's filters do not allow the words \"sex tape\" or variant spellings, and because given that Roblox had about 11.1 million experiences at the time, the chances that Saint West would randomly stumble upon an experience promoting her sex tape are very small [163]\n\n\nToy lines\nIn January 2017, toy fabricator Jazwares partnered with Roblox Corporation to produce toy minifigures based on user-generated content created by developers on the platform [168] The minifigures have limbs and joints similar to that of Lego minifigures, though they are about twice the size [169] The minifigures have limbs and accessories that are interchangeable The sets included a code that was used to redeem virtual items, as well as blind boxes that contained random minifigures [170] [171] In 2019, Jazwares released a new line of toys, branded as the \"Roblox Desktop\" series [172] On April 13, 2021, Roblox partnered with Hasbro to release Roblox-themed Nerf blasters and a Roblox-themed Monopoly edition [173]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born on July 8, 1961, in Nottingham, England, Fletcher's early life and career were marked by a passion for music and a desire to create unique sounds.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nFletcher was the eldest of four siblings born to Joy and John Fletcher. When he was two years old, his family moved to Basildon, Essex, where his father had secured a job at a cigarette factory. Growing up in the suburban town, Fletcher was an active member of the local Boys' Brigade, where he primarily played football. His musical influences, however, were shaped by the emerging punk rock scene in the late 1970s. As he recalled in an interview, \"we were very lucky in life\" to experience this pivotal moment in music history at the age of 14.\n\nFletcher attended Nicholas Comprehensive School, where he was in the same sixth form class as Martin Gore and Alison Moyet. After leaving school, he worked as an insurance clerk, a job that would later provide a sense of stability during his music career. Despite the mundane nature of his employment, Fletcher's passion for music remained a driving force in his life.\n\n**Career**\n\nFletcher's musical journey began in the late 1970s, when he formed the short-lived band No Romance in China with Vince Clarke. This initial collaboration marked the beginning of a long-term creative partnership with Clarke, who would later become a key figure in Depeche Mode. In 1980, Clarke and Fletcher formed Composition of Sound, a band that would eventually adopt the name Depeche Mode after the recruitment of singer Dave Gahan.\n\nThe early days of Depeche Mode were marked by a unique blend of punk, new wave, and electronic music influences. As a bassist, Fletcher played a crucial role in shaping the band's sound, which was characterized by its dark, introspective tone and innovative use of synthesizers. Clarke's songwriting skills and Gore's synthesizer work complemented Fletcher's bass playing, creating a distinctive sound that would differentiate Depeche Mode from other bands of the era.\n\n**Depeche Mode**\n\nAs a member of Depeche Mode, Fletcher's role within the band was often a topic of speculation. In early incarnations, he played both electric and synth bass, providing a versatile foundation for the band's music. After Clarke's departure in 1981, Fletcher's role evolved as each member took on areas that suited them and benefited the band collectively. In a 1989 documentary film, Fletcher described his role within the band, stating, \"Martin's the songwriter, Alan's the good musician, Dave's the vocalist, and I bum around.\"\n\nFletcher's statement was later echoed by Rolling Stone writer Gavin Edwards, who noted that \"Depeche Mode's unique division of labor has been long established, with each of the three remaining members having a distinct role: Martin Gore writes the songs, Dave Gahan sings them and Andy Fletcher shows up for photo shoots and cashes the checks.\" Despite his lack of songwriting credits, Fletcher's contributions to Depeche Mode's music and legacy were invaluable.\n\n**Toast Hawaii**\n\nIn 2002, Fletcher launched his own record label, a Mute Records imprint called Toast Hawaii, named after his favorite dish. He signed the band Client, coordinating the recording of their eponymous 2003 debut and 2004's City. Fletcher also produced extended remixes for Client's subsequent singles, including \"Price of Love,\" \"Rock and Roll Machine,\" \"Here and Now,\" \"In It for the Money,\" \"Radio,\" and \"Pornography\" (featuring Carl Barât of the Libertines).\n\n**DJ Career**\n\nTo support Client's live shows, Fletcher began touring as a DJ, playing occasional festivals and club gigs whenever he was on hiatus from Depeche Mode. His sets often featured exclusive Depeche remixes, which added to his reputation as a skilled DJ.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nFletcher was married to Gráinne Fletcher (née Mullan) for approximately 30 years, having two children together. The couple's long-term relationship provided a sense of stability and support during Fletcher's music career.\n\n**Death**\n\nAndy Fletcher passed away on May 26, 2022, at the age of 60, following an aortic dissection while at home. His bandmates, Dave Gahan and Martin Gore, released a statement expressing their shock and sadness at his untimely passing, saying, \"we are shocked and filled with overwhelming sadness with the untimely passing of our dear friend, family member and bandmate Andy 'Fletch' Fletcher.\" Former Depeche Mode member Alan Wilder also paid tribute to Fletcher, stating that learning of his death was \"a real bolt from the blue.\"\n\n**Album Discography with Depeche Mode**\n\n* Speak & Spell (1981)\n* A Broken Frame (1982)\n* Construction Time Again (1983)\n* Some Great Reward (1984)\n* Black Celebration (1986)\n* Music for the Masses (1987)\n* Violator (1990)\n* Songs of Faith and Devotion (1993)\n* Ultra (1997)\n* Exciter (2001)\n* Playing the Angel (2005)\n* Sounds of the Universe (2009)\n* Delta Machine (2013)\n* Spirit (2017)\n* Memento Mori (2021)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Andy_Fletcher_(musician)\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nFletcher was the eldest of four siblings born to Joy and John Fletcher [4] The family moved to Basildon from Nottingham when he was two years old, when his father, an engineer, was offered a job at a cigarette factory [5] He was active in the local Boys' Brigade from an early age, primarily to play football [6] He attended Nicholas Comprehensive where he was in the same sixth form class as Martin Gore and Alison Moyet [7] After leaving school be worked as an insurance clerk [7]\n\n\nCareer\nFletcher, and acquaintances Vince Clarke and Martin Gore, were in their mid-teens when punk rock arrived on the music scene Fletcher said this was \"obviously the perfect age to experience it\", noting that \"we were very lucky in life\" [8] Fletcher and Clarke formed the short-lived band No Romance in China, in which Fletcher played bass guitar [9] In 1980, Clarke and Fletcher formed a band called Composition of Sound, with Clarke on vocals/guitar and Fletcher on bass;
