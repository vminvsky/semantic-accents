Vinoth. The film stars Ajith Kumar, Hanya Rani, and Kartikeya Gummakonda. It was produced by Boney Kapoor and Zee Studios.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film is set in the city of Chennai, where a group of bike racers, led by a young woman named Shakthi (Hanya Rani), become embroiled in a conflict with a local gangster, Raju Bhai (Kartikeya Gummakonda). As the story unfolds, Ajith Kumar's character, a bike cop, is tasked with taking down Raju Bhai and his gang, while also navigating his personal relationships and confrontations with corruption.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Ajith Kumar as Inspector Durai\n* Hanya Rani as Shakthi\n* Kartikeya Gummakonda as Raju Bhai\n* Bagavathi Perumal as Raju's uncle\n* Pugazhendhi as Shakthi's father\n* Ravi Shankar as Shakthi's uncle\n\n**Production**\n\n#### Development\n\nThe film was first announced in 2019, with H. Vinoth set to direct and Boney Kapoor producing. The script was written by Vinoth, who had previously worked with Ajith on the 2017 film Vivegam. The film's story was inspired by real-life events, with Vinoth drawing from his own experiences as a bike enthusiast.\n\n#### Casting\n\nAjith Kumar was reportedly approached for the lead role in 2019, and he accepted the offer soon after. Hanya Rani was cast as the female lead, and Kartikeya Gummakonda was brought on board to play the role of Raju Bhai. The rest of the cast was finalized over the next few months.\n\n#### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography began in October 2020, with Vinoth directing and cinematographer G.K. Vishnu taking charge of the camera work. The film was shot on a combination of digital and 35mm film, with a mix of action sequences, drama, and romance.\n\n#### Post-production\n\nThe film's editing was handled by Vivek Harshan, with the music composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja. The sound design was done by Dileep Subbarayan, and the visual effects were handled by Weta Digital.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe soundtrack of Valimai features six tracks, all composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja. The songs were released on January 14, 2022, to positive reviews from music critics. The album includes a mix of energetic and emotional tracks, with lyrics written by Arunraja Kamaraj, Mohanraj, and Madhan Karky.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nThe film's marketing campaign began in earnest in January 2022, with the release of the first trailer and a series of promotional posters and teasers. The film's social media presence was also ramped up, with Ajith and the cast sharing updates and behind-the-scenes content.\n\n**Release**\n\n#### Theatrical\n\nValimai was released in India on February 24, 2022, in Tamil Nadu and other southern states. The film was released in a limited capacity due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but it still managed to attract a large audience.\n\n#### Screenings and statistics\n\nThe film was released in over 600 screens across India, with a total of 2,000 shows per day. The film's opening day collections were reportedly over ₹25 crore, with the total domestic collection standing at over ₹150 crore by the end of its first week.\n\n#### Pre-release business\n\nThe film's pre-release business was reportedly significant, with the producers selling the rights to several territories, including the United States, Malaysia, and Singapore. The film's satellite rights were sold to Star Vijay for a reported ₹45 crore.\n\n#### Distribution\n\nThe film was distributed by Zee Studios and Boney Kapoor's production company, Boney Kapoor Productions. The film's distribution was handled by various local distributors across India.\n\n#### Home media\n\nThe film was released on digital platforms on March 18, 2022, and it was later released on DVD and Blu-ray in April 2022.\n\n**Reception**\n\n#### Critical response\n\nValimai received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising the film's action sequences, performances, and direction. The film holds a 72% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 10 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10.\n\n#### Box office\n\nThe film was a commercial success, grossing over ₹200 crore at the domestic box office and over ₹300 crore worldwide. The film's performances in international markets, particularly in the United States and Malaysia, were particularly impressive.\n\n**Plagiarism allegations**\n\nIn March 2022, a claim of plagiarism was made against the film's script, with some accusing the writer, H. Vinoth, of copying from a 2019 Telugu film, F2: Fun and Frustration. An investigation was launched, but no concrete evidence was found to support the allegations.\n\n**Impact**\n\nValimai had a significant impact on the Tamil film industry, with its success paving the way for other action films. The film's success also marked a comeback of sorts for Ajith Kumar, who had been away from the industry for a few years.\n\n**Potential sequel**\n\nIn April 2022, it was reported that a sequel to Valimai was in the works, with H. Vinoth set to direct and Ajith Kumar reprising his role. However, no official announcement was made, and the status of the project remains unclear.\n\n**References**\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n**Notes**\n\n* The film's title, Valimai, is a Tamil word that translates to \"honesty\" in English.\n* The film's script was written by H.

Born on December 8, 1970, in Dublin, Ireland, O'Connor rose to international fame in the 1990s with her critically acclaimed albums and unflinching performances.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nSinéad O'Connor was born to Sean O'Connor, a manager of a local pub, and Joan Gibbons, a social worker. She was the second of three children, and her parents divorced when she was a young child. O'Connor's early life was marked by poverty and instability, with her family relying on social services to get by. Despite these challenges, O'Connor's mother encouraged her love of music, and she began singing in local choirs and musical groups from a young age.\n\nO'Connor attended Mount Anville Secondary School in Dublin, where she was known for her talent and her fiery personality. She was expelled from school at the age of 14 for refusing to participate in a school play, citing her own struggles with anxiety and depression. After her expulsion, O'Connor moved to a new school, where she began to develop her musical skills and write her own songs.\n\n**Music career**\n\nO'Connor's music career began in the late 1980s, when she joined the Dublin-based band Ton Ton Macoute.

He has been involved in various controversies and has been the subject of intense media scrutiny.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nSam Bankman-Fried was born on March 6, 1992, in Stanford, California, to a family of academics. His parents, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, were both professors at Stanford Law School. Bankman-Fried's father specializes in tax law, and his mother is a law professor who has written extensively on topics related to political economy and ethics. Bankman-Fried's upbringing was marked by a strong emphasis on philanthropy and ethics, with his parents encouraging him to pursue careers in these areas.\n\nBankman-Fried attended the Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire, where he excelled in math and science. He then went on to attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he studied physics and graduated in 2014 with a Bachelor of Science degree. During his time at MIT, Bankman-Fried developed an interest in economics and began to study the subject extensively.\n\n**Career**\n\nAfter graduating from MIT, Bankman-Fried moved to Hong Kong to work as a quantitative trading analyst for Jane Street, a global trading firm. He worked at Jane Street for several years, developing his skills in quantitative trading and learning about the cryptocurrency market. In 2017, Bankman-Fried founded Alameda Research, a quantitative trading firm that focused on cryptocurrency markets.\n\nIn 2019, Bankman-Fried founded FTX, a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange that quickly gained popularity due to its user-friendly interface and competitive pricing. FTX was designed to be a more accessible and user-friendly alternative to other cryptocurrency exchanges, and it quickly gained a large following among retail traders. Under Bankman-Fried's leadership, FTX expanded its operations rapidly, and it became one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world.\n\n**Views on charity and market regulation**\n\nBankman-Fried has been open about his views on charity and market regulation. He has stated that he believes in the importance of giving to effective altruism causes, and he has donated millions of dollars to organizations such as the Schistosoma Research Network and the Against Malaria Foundation.\n\nBankman-Fried has also expressed views on market regulation, stating that he believes that cryptocurrency markets should be subject to stricter regulations in order to protect consumers. However, he has also argued that overly stringent regulations can stifle innovation and hamper the growth of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\n**Bankruptcy of FTX**\n\nIn November 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy in the United States, following a series of events that led to a liquidity crisis at the company. The bankruptcy filing was sparked by a series of withdrawals by customers, which left FTX with a significant shortfall in its reserves. The company's collapse was a major blow to the cryptocurrency industry, and it sparked widespread criticism of Bankman-Fried's leadership and business practices.\n\n**Arrest and charges**\n\nIn December 2022, Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas and charged with eight counts of fraud, money laundering, and other financial crimes. The charges were brought by the U.S. Department of Justice, which alleged that Bankman-Fried had used FTX customer funds to finance his own business ventures and to make extravagant purchases.\n\nBankman-Fried was extradited to the United States and appeared in court in January 2023, where he was denied bail. He has since been held in pre-trial detention pending his trial.\n\n**United States v. Bankman-Fried**\n\nBankman-Fried's trial is currently ongoing, with a jury of 12 citizens selected to hear the case. The trial is expected to last several weeks, and it will involve testimony from numerous witnesses, including former FTX employees and customers.\n\nThe prosecution is expected to present evidence that Bankman-Fried used FTX customer funds to finance his own business ventures, including his company Alameda Research. The prosecution will also allege that Bankman-Fried made false statements to investors and customers about the financial health of FTX.\n\nThe defense is expected to argue that Bankman-Fried did not knowingly engage in any wrongdoing, and that he was unaware of the true financial condition of FTX. The defense will also argue that Bankman-Fried's actions were justified by the need to protect the company and its customers from a liquidity crisis.\n\n**Trial conclusion**\n\nThe trial is ongoing, and a verdict has not yet been reached. However, it is expected that the trial will last several weeks, and that the jury will hear extensive testimony from numerous witnesses.\n\n**Second trial dismissed**\n\nIn January 2024, a second trial was dismissed against Bankman-Fried, citing a lack of evidence. The dismissal was a major blow to the prosecution, and it raised concerns about the strength of the case against Bankman-Fried.\n\n**Appeal**\n\nThe prosecution has announced that it will appeal the dismissal of the second trial, and the case is expected to go to the U.S. Court of Appeals. The appeal is expected to be heard in the coming months, and it will involve a review of the trial court's decision to dismiss the case.\n\n**Incarceration history**\n\nBankman-Fried has been held in pre-trial detention since his arrest in December 2022. He has been denied bail on multiple occasions, and he is currently being held at a federal prison in New York.\n\n**Donations**\n\nBankman-Fried has made significant donations to various causes and organizations over the years. In 2018, he donated $2.5 million to the Schistosoma Research Network, a charity that focuses on the treatment and prevention of schistosomiasis. In 2020, he donated $1 million to the Against Malaria Foundation, a charity that focuses on the prevention and treatment of malaria.\n\n**Politics**\n\nBankman-Fried has been involved in various political causes and organizations over the years. In 2020, he donated $5 million to the Joe Biden presidential campaign, making him one of the largest donors to the campaign.\n\n**2020 and earlier**\n\nIn 2020, Bankman-Fried was a prominent supporter of the Joe Biden presidential campaign. He donated $5 million to the campaign and served as a fundraiser for the candidate. He also wrote an op-ed in The New York Times criticizing the Trump administration's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**2021–2022**\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, Bankman-Fried continued to be involved in politics, donating to various Democratic candidates and causes. He also served as a spokesperson for the cryptocurrency industry, advocating for greater regulation and oversight of the industry.\n\n**2022 U.S. midterm elections**\n\nIn the 2022 U.S. midterm elections, Bankman-Fried donated $1 million to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, a fundraising arm of the Democratic Party. He also donated to various Democratic candidates, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders.\n\n**Pandemic prevention contributions and related controversy**\n\nIn 2020, Bankman-Fried donated $1 million to the Against Malaria Foundation, a charity that focuses on the prevention and treatment of malaria. However, the donation was criticized by some, who argued that it was not an effective use of funds given the relatively low mortality rate of malaria compared to other diseases.\n\n**Attempts to recoup donations**\n\nIn 2023, Bankman-Fried began to attempt to recoup some of his donations, citing the collapse of FTX and the resulting financial difficulties. However, his efforts were met with criticism from some, who argued that he had no right to attempt to recoup donations made to charitable causes.\n\n**Personal life**\n\nBankman-Fried is known to be a private person, and little is known about his personal life. However, it is reported that he is married and has children. He is also known to be a fan of science fiction and fantasy literature, and has expressed a particular fondness for the works of authors such as Isaac Asimov and George R.R. Martin.\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe collapse of FTX and the subsequent arrest and trial of Sam Bankman-Fried have sparked widespread controversy and debate in the cryptocurrency industry and beyond. The case has raised questions about the regulation of the industry, the role of effective altruism in philanthropy, and the importance of corporate governance and transparency.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any citations or references, as the information is based on publicly available sources and is intended to provide a neutral and encyclopedic overview of the topic.\n\n**External links**\n\n* FTX website\n* Sam Bankman-Fried's Twitter account\n* The New York Times article on the collapse of FTX\n* The Wall Street Journal article on the arrest of Sam Bankman-Fried\n* The Washington Post article on the trial of Sam Bankman-Fried", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Sam_Bankman-Fried\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#Career\n##Views on charity and market regulation\n##Bankruptcy of FTX\n#Arrest and charges\n#United States v.

It is a unique and ecologically significant species, endemic to the southeastern United States. This article provides an in-depth overview of the discovery, taxonomy, and conservation status of Torreya taxifolia, as well as its ecology, distribution, and extinction threats.\n\n**Species discovery**\n\nThe discovery of Torreya taxifolia dates back to the late 19th century, when the species was first described by American botanist John Torrey in 1844. Torrey, a prominent botanist of his time, was instrumental in the exploration and classification of plant species in North America. The species was initially known as Taxus taxifolia, but was later reclassified into the genus Torreya, which is named after its discoverer.\n\n**Taxonomy and naming**\n\nThe taxonomy of Torreya taxifolia is complex and has undergone several revisions over the years. The species is currently classified within the family Taxaceae, which is a small but ecologically significant family of coniferous trees. The genus Torreya is part of the order Coniferales, which includes conifers and other related species. The species name taxifolia refers to the similarity between the leaves of Torreya taxifolia and those of the yew tree (Taxus baccata).\n\n**Type species of genus Torreya**\n\nTorreya taxifolia is the type species of the genus Torreya. As such, it serves as a reference point for the classification and identification of other species within the genus. The species is characterized by its unique combination of morphological and anatomical features, which distinguish it from other species within the family Taxaceae.\n\n**Common names**\n\nTorreya taxifolia is commonly known as the Florida nutmeg due to its unique fruit, which resembles a small nutmeg. The species is also known as the Florida torreya, reflecting its endemic status in the state of Florida. Other common names for the species include the Florida yew and the Florida cedar.\n\n**Description**\n\n**Technical description**\n\nTorreya taxifolia is a small to medium-sized tree that grows up to 15 meters in height. The tree has a conical shape, with a straight trunk and a rounded crown. The bark is reddish-brown and smooth, with deep furrows and ridges. The leaves are scale-like, with a flat, lanceolate shape and a waxy texture. The leaves are arranged in a spiral pattern on the twigs, and are a dark green color on the upper surface and a light green color on the lower surface.\n\n**Subcanopy growth adaptations**\n\nOne of the unique features of Torreya taxifolia is its ability to grow in the subcanopy, where it can thrive in low light conditions. The species has adapted to this environment by developing a unique root system, which allows it to absorb nutrients and water from the soil. The tree also has a deep taproot, which allows it to access water deep in the soil.\n\n**Distribution**\n\n**Wild population**\n\nThe wild population of Torreya taxifolia is limited to a small area in the Panhandle of Florida, where it grows in a narrow strip along the Apalachicola River. The species is found in a variety of habitats, including pine flatwoods, oak hammocks, and scrubby flatwoods.\n\n**Prehistoric distribution**\n\nFossil records suggest that Torreya taxifolia had a broader distribution in the past, with evidence of the species found in fossil deposits as far north as New York and as far south as Mexico. However, the species appears to have undergone a significant decline in its range over the past few thousand years, possibly due to changes in climate and vegetation.\n\n**Ecology**\n\n**Habitat**\n\nTorreya taxifolia grows in a variety of habitats, including pine flatwoods, oak hammocks, and scrubby flatwoods. The species is often found in areas with high levels of humidity and moderate temperatures, where it can thrive in the subcanopy.\n\n**Seed dispersal**\n\nThe seeds of Torreya taxifolia are dispersed by birds and small mammals, which eat the fruit and then deposit the seeds in a new location. The seeds are also dispersed by the wind, which can carry them long distances.\n\n**Extinction threats**\n\n**Vulnerabilities of restricted range size**\n\nOne of the major extinction threats to Torreya taxifolia is its restricted range size. The species is found in a small area in the Panhandle of Florida, where it is vulnerable to changes in climate and vegetation. The species is also vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation, which can make it difficult for the species to survive.\n\n**The die-off begins**\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, a die-off began in the wild population of Torreya taxifolia, with many trees mysteriously dying. The cause of the die-off was initially unknown, but it was later attributed to a combination of factors, including pathogens, habitat deterioration, and changes in climate.\n\n**The role of pathogens in the die-off**\n\nOne of the major causes of the die-off was a stem canker fungus that infected the trees. The fungus, which was later identified as Phytophthora cinnamomi, caused a decline in the health of the trees, making them more susceptible to other stressors.\n\n**The role of habitat deterioration in the die-off**\n\nHabitat deterioration was also a major factor in the die-off. The destruction of the natural habitat of Torreya taxifolia, including the clearing of pine flatwoods and the construction of roads and buildings, made it difficult for the species to survive.\n\n**Focus on a stem canker fungus**\n\nThe focus of conservation efforts shifted to the stem canker fungus, with researchers working to understand the causes of the disease and to develop strategies for controlling it. However, the ultimate cause of the die-off remains unsolved.\n\n**Ultimate cause of die-off still unsolved**\n\nDespite significant research efforts, the ultimate cause of the die-off remains unsolved. The die-off continues to this day, with many trees still dying in the wild population.\n\n**Conservation actions**\n\n**Protect areas in species range**\n\nConservation efforts have focused on protecting areas in the species range, including the establishment of nature reserves and the creation of buffer zones around the remaining wild population. These efforts aim to reduce the impact of human activities on the species and to provide a safe habitat for the trees.\n\n**List the species as endangered**\n\nThe species has been listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List, which provides a global assessment of the conservation status of species. The listing highlights the need for urgent conservation action to protect the species.\n\n**In situ habitat improvement**\n\nIn situ habitat improvement is an important conservation strategy for Torreya taxifolia. The aim is to improve the habitat of the species, including the creation of new areas for the trees to grow and the restoration of degraded habitats.\n\n**Ex situ genetic safeguarding**\n\nEx situ genetic safeguarding is another important conservation strategy for Torreya taxifolia. The aim is to safeguard the genetic material of the species, including the collection and storage of seeds and the creation of genetic banks.\n\n**Document early horticultural plantings**\n\nDocumenting early horticultural plantings is an important conservation strategy for Torreya taxifolia. The aim is to record the history of the species in cultivation, including the date and location of early plantings and the people involved.\n\n**Conservation controversies**\n\n**Assisted migration (the policy debate)**\n\nOne of the major conservation controversies surrounding Torreya taxifolia is the policy debate over assisted migration. Assisted migration is a strategy that involves moving the species to areas outside its current range, in order to increase its population and reduce the risk of extinction. However, the policy debate surrounding assisted migration is contentious, with some arguing that it is necessary to ensure the survival of the species, while others argue that it is not worth the risk.\n\n**Management of seeds produced ex situ**\n\nThe management of seeds produced ex situ is another major conservation controversy surrounding Torreya taxifolia. Seeds produced ex situ are seeds that are produced in controlled environments, such as greenhouses or seed banks. However, there are different opinions on how these seeds should be managed, with some arguing that they should be used for conservation purposes, while others argue that they should be used for commercial purposes.\n\n**Seeds produced from official plantings**\n\nSeeds produced from official plantings are seeds that are produced from plants that have been established by official conservation organizations. These seeds are often seen as being of high quality and are used for conservation purposes. However, there are concerns that seeds produced from official plantings may be used for commercial purposes, rather than for conservation.\n\n**Seeds accessed by citizens**\n\nSeeds accessed by citizens are seeds that are produced by individuals, rather than by official conservation organizations. These seeds are often seen as being of lower quality and are not used for conservation purposes.

It is native to the Mediterranean region and is also found in parts of Asia and North Africa.\n\n**Scientific Name**\n\nThe scientific name Anagyris foetida is derived from the Greek words \"anagyros\" and \"foetida\", meaning \"stinking\" or \"fetid\". This refers to the plant's distinctive, unpleasant odor.\n\n**Common Names**\n\nAnagyris foetida is also known by the common names \"stinking anagyris\", \"fetid anagyris\", and \"Medicinal vetch\".\n\n**Distribution**\n\nAnagyris foetida is found in the Mediterranean region, including countries such as Spain, France, Italy, Greece, and Turkey. It is also found in parts of Asia, including Iran and Iraq, and in North Africa, including Algeria and Morocco.\n\n**Habitat**\n\nAnagyris foetida grows in a variety of habitats, including dry rocky areas, scrublands, and woodland edges. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun.\n\n**Adaptations to growth in Winter and early Spring**\n\nAnagyris foetida has several adaptations that allow it to grow and thrive during the winter and early spring months.\n\n### **Summer leaf-fall**\n\nOne of the most distinctive features of Anagyris foetida is its unique habit of dropping its leaves in the summer months. This allows the plant to conserve water and energy during the hot and dry summer, and to focus its resources on producing flowers and seeds.\n\n### **Pollination by birds**\n\nAnagyris foetida is pollinated by birds, which are attracted to the plant's bright yellow flowers and sweet nectar. The plant's flowers are also visited by other pollinators, such as bees and butterflies.\n\n**Seed Dispersal**\n\nAnagyris foetida seeds are dispersed in a variety of ways, including through soil seed banks, olive mimicry, and the actions of animals.\n\n### **Soil seed banks**\n\nAnagyris foetida seeds can survive for many years in soil seed banks, allowing the plant to recolonize areas where it has been absent.\n\n### **Olive mimicry**\n\nAnagyris foetida seeds have a unique, olive-like shape that allows them to be mistaken for olive seeds. This can lead to the plant being dispersed by humans, who collect olives for food and oil.\n\n### **Role of sheep**\n\nSheep are also important vectors for the dispersal of Anagyris foetida seeds. The seeds can become attached to the sheep's wool, allowing them to be transported to new areas.\n\n### **Other possible mammalian and avian vectors**\n\nOther animals, such as deer and birds, may also play a role in the dispersal of Anagyris foetida seeds.\n\n### **Unknown seed dispersal vector**\n\nThe exact mechanisms of Anagyris foetida seed dispersal are not fully understood, and further research is needed to determine the full range of vectors involved.\n\n### **Tough, waterproof seed coats**\n\nAnagyris foetida seeds have tough, waterproof seed coats that allow them to survive for long periods in the environment.\n\n**Value as a nitrogen-fixing pioneer and companion plant**\n\nAnagyris foetida is a nitrogen-fixing plant, meaning that it has the ability to convert atmospheric nitrogen into a form that can be used by other plants. This makes it a valuable companion plant for other plants, particularly those that require high levels of nitrogen.\n\n**Medicinal use**\n\nAnagyris foetida has been used in traditional medicine for a variety of purposes, including the treatment of respiratory infections and the relief of symptoms associated with colds and flu.\n\n**Toxicity**\n\nAnagyris foetida contains a number of toxic compounds, including alkaloids and glycosides. These compounds can be hazardous to humans and animals, particularly if ingested in large quantities.\n\n### **Alkaloid anagyrine a cause of birth defects**\n\nThe alkaloid anagyrine, found in Anagyris foetida, has been linked to birth defects in animals. This has raised concerns about the potential risks of Anagyris foetida to human health.\n\n### **Danger to children**\n\nAnagyris foetida is particularly hazardous to children, who may be tempted to ingest the plant's toxic seeds or leaves.\n\n### **Hazardous tainting of milk products**\n\nThe toxic compounds found in Anagyris foetida can also contaminate milk products, making them hazardous to human consumption.\n\n### **Case of accidental poisoning in Algeria**\n\nA case of accidental poisoning involving Anagyris foetida was reported in Algeria, highlighting the risks of the plant to human health.\n\n**Cultural references: Anagyris and Anagyrous**\n\nThe name Anagyris has been used in a number of cultural references, including in the ancient Greek play Lysistrata.\n\n### **Lysistrata**\n\nIn Lysistrata, the character of Anagyris is a minor figure who is mentioned in a scene in which the women of Athens are discussing their refusal to have sex with their husbands.\n\n### **Persistence of name**\n\nThe name Anagyris has persisted through time, with references to the plant found in modern literature and art.\n\n**Gallery**\n\n### **Anagyris foetida**\n\nImage of Anagyris foetida in bloom.\n\n### **Avian pollinators**\n\nImage of birds visiting Anagyris foetida flowers.\n\n### **Avian nectar thief**\n\nImage of a bird stealing nectar from an Anagyris foetida flower.\n\n### **Insect pollinators**\n\nImage of insects visiting Anagyris foetida flowers.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Fabaceae\n* Medicinal plants\n* Nitrogen-fixing plants\n* Poisonous plants\n* Traditional medicine", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Anagyris_foetida\" following this outline:\n\n#Scientific Name\n#Common names\n#Distribution\n#Habitat\n#Adaptations to growth in Winter and early Spring\n##Summer leaf-fall\n##Pollination by birds\n#Seed dispersal\n##Soil seed banks\n##Olive mimicry\n##Role of sheep\n##Other possible mammalian and avian vectors\n##Unknown seed dispersal vector\n##Tough, waterproof seed coats\n#Value as a nitrogen-fixing pioneer and companion plant\n#Medicinal use\n#Toxicity\n##Alkaloid anagyrine a cause of birth defects\n##Danger to children\n##Hazardous tainting of milk products\n##Case of accidental poisoning in Algeria\n#Cultural references: Anagyris and Anagyrous\n##Lysistrata\n##Persistence of name\n#Gallery\n##Anagyris foetida\n##Avian pollinators\n##Avian nectar thief\n##Insect pollinators\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Along the way, they befriend a young British soldier, Scott B. Amery (Ajay Devgn), who becomes an unlikely ally in their fight for freedom. Meanwhile, a British officer, Bham (Shrikanth), is tasked with capturing the two revolutionaries and crushing the Indian independence movement.

This phenomenon has occurred in various countries throughout history, often as a result of regime change, civil war, or other forms of political upheaval.\n\n**History**\n\n### Russia (1917–1925)\n\nFollowing the February Revolution in 1917, the Russian government collapsed, and a new government was established by the Provisional Government. However, this government was short-lived, and the Bolsheviks seized power in October 1917. The Bolsheviks established the Soviet Union in 1922, and the Russian diplomatic missions abroad continued to operate under the new government.\n\n#### Diplomatic missions after 1917\n\nThe Russian diplomatic missions abroad were initially maintained by the Provisional Government, but as the Bolsheviks took control, they attempted to re-establish diplomatic relations with other countries. However, many countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, refused to recognize the new Soviet government and instead continued to recognize the old Russian government. This led to a situation where Russia had diplomatic missions abroad that were not recognized by the host countries.\n\n#### Dissolution of the Soviet Union\n\nIn 1991, the Soviet Union was dissolved, and the Russian Federation took its place. The Russian diplomatic missions abroad continued to operate, but they were now recognized by the host countries as the representatives of the Russian Federation.\n\n### Spain (1939–1977)\n\nIn 1936, the Spanish Civil War broke out, and the government of the Second Spanish Republic was overthrown by the Nationalist forces led by General Francisco Franco. The Republican government continued to exist in exile, and its diplomatic missions abroad continued to operate.\n\n#### Diplomatic missions after 1939\n\nThe Republican government's diplomatic missions were recognized by many countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. However, as the Nationalist forces gained control of more territory, the Republican government's legitimacy was diminished. In 1940, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France recognized the Nationalist government as the legitimate government of Spain, and the Republican government's diplomatic missions were no longer recognized.\n\n### Poland (1939–1990)\n\nIn 1939, Poland was invaded by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, and the Polish government was forced to flee. The Polish government-in-exile continued to exist, and its diplomatic missions abroad continued to operate.\n\n#### Diplomatic missions after 1939\n\nThe Polish government-in-exile's diplomatic missions were recognized by many countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. However, as the war progressed, the Polish government-in-exile's legitimacy was diminished, and its diplomatic missions were no longer recognized by many countries.\n\n### Afghanistan (2021–present)\n\nIn 2021, the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan, and the government of Afghanistan was overthrown. The diplomatic missions of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan continued to operate, but they were no longer recognized by the host countries.\n\n#### Diplomatic missions after 2021\n\nThe diplomatic missions of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan were initially recognized by many countries, but as the Taliban took control, many countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, refused to recognize the new government. The diplomatic missions of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan are currently operating in a situation similar to that of the Russian diplomatic missions in 1917.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Diplomatic recognition\n* Government-in-exile\n* Regime change\n* Civil war\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The situation of an embassy without a government is a complex and nuanced one, and the information presented in this article is intended to provide a general overview of the phenomenon.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Embassy_without_a_government\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Russia (1917–1925)\n###Diplomatic missions after 1917\n###Dissolution of the Soviet Union\n##Spain (1939–1977)\n###Diplomatic missions after 1939\n##Poland (1939–1990)\n###Diplomatic missions after 1939\n##Afghanistan (2021–present)\n###Diplomatic missions after 2021\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The company is headquartered in the Bahamas and has become one of the largest and most prominent cryptocurrency exchanges in the world.\n\n**History**\n\nFTX was founded in May 2019 by Sam Bankman-Fried, a young entrepreneur with a background in physics and mathematics. Bankman-Fried had previously worked at Jane Street, a quantitative trading firm, where he gained experience in trading and risk management. FTX was initially launched as a derivatives exchange, allowing users to trade cryptocurrencies with leverage.\n\nIn the early days, FTX focused on providing a unique set of products and features to its users, including perpetual swaps, options, and futures contracts. The exchange quickly gained popularity among cryptocurrency traders and investors, and its user base grew rapidly.\n\n**November 2022 crisis and bankruptcy**\n\n### Background: FTX and Alameda, Binance, and CoinDesk report\n\nIn the months leading up to the crisis, FTX had been experiencing significant growth and had become one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. However, behind the scenes, the company was facing significant financial difficulties. FTX's sister company, Alameda Research, a quantitative trading firm, was facing financial difficulties due to a combination of factors, including a decline in the value of FTT, a cryptocurrency token issued by FTX.\n\nIn October 2022, CoinDesk reported that FTX had faced significant financial difficulties, including a $8 billion hole in its balance sheet. The report sparked concerns among FTX's users and investors, who began to withdraw their funds from the exchange.\n\n### Crisis begins: Binance FTT sale, sell-off, and withdrawn rescue bid\n\nOn November 6, 2022, Binance, another large cryptocurrency exchange, announced that it would sell its holdings of FTT, the cryptocurrency token issued by FTX. The move sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market, causing a sharp decline in the value of FTT.\n\nAs FTT's value plummeted, FTX's users began to withdraw their funds from the exchange, triggering a massive sell-off of cryptocurrencies. The sell-off was so severe that FTX's liquidity crisis deepened, making it impossible for the company to meet its financial obligations.\n\nIn response to the crisis, Binance, which had been in talks with FTX about a potential merger, announced that it would withdraw its rescue bid. The move sent FTX's stock price plummeting, and the company's financial situation continued to deteriorate.\n\n### Bankruptcy and unauthorized transactions\n\nOn November 11, 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy in the United States, citing a liquidity crisis and significant financial difficulties. The bankruptcy filing was made in the Southern District of New York, where FTX had a significant presence.\n\nIn the days following the bankruptcy filing, it was revealed that FTX had made unauthorized transactions with its customers' funds. The transactions, which were made by FTX's management, were allegedly used to prop up Alameda Research, FTX's sister company.\n\nThe unauthorized transactions sparked outrage among FTX's users and investors, who felt that their funds had been misused by the company's management.\n\n### Widening impact and contagion fears\n\nThe collapse of FTX sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market, causing a sharp decline in the value of cryptocurrencies. The sell-off was so severe that it triggered a contagion effect, causing other cryptocurrency exchanges and firms to experience significant financial difficulties.\n\nThe collapse of FTX also raised concerns about the stability of the global cryptocurrency market, with many experts warning about the potential for a wider collapse. The incident highlighted the need for greater regulation and oversight of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\n### Responses and effects\n\n#### Effects on investors\n\nThe collapse of FTX had a significant impact on its investors, who saw their investments decline sharply. Many investors had invested heavily in FTX, expecting to earn significant returns. However, the collapse of the company left many investors with significant losses.\n\nIn the aftermath of the collapse, many investors began to question the stability of the cryptocurrency market, and the risks associated with investing in it. The incident highlighted the need for greater caution and due diligence when investing in the cryptocurrency market.\n\n#### Effects on other cryptocurrency firms and cryptocurrency markets\n\nThe collapse of FTX had a significant impact on other cryptocurrency firms and the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Many firms began to experience financial difficulties, and the value of cryptocurrencies declined sharply.\n\nThe incident highlighted the need for greater regulation and oversight of the cryptocurrency industry, and the need for greater stability and security in the market.\n\n#### Responses and commentary\n\nThe collapse of FTX was widely criticized by experts and regulators, who cited a lack of oversight and regulation as contributing factors. Many experts warned about the dangers of unchecked growth and the importance of greater regulation.\n\nThe incident highlighted the need for greater transparency and accountability in the cryptocurrency industry, and the need for greater protection for investors.\n\n**Legal process**\n\nThe collapse of FTX triggered a significant legal process, with multiple lawsuits filed against the company and its management. The lawsuits alleged that FTX's management had engaged in fraudulent and unauthorized activities, including the misuse of customer funds.\n\nThe legal process is ongoing, with multiple parties involved. The outcome of the process will determine the extent of the financial losses suffered by FTX's investors and the level of accountability of the company's management.\n\n**Sponsorships**\n\nFTX had several high-profile sponsorships, including partnerships with major sports teams and events. The company's sponsorships were seen as a way to promote its brand and increase its visibility.\n\nHowever, in the aftermath of the collapse, many of FTX's sponsorships were terminated, and the company's brand was damaged.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article has been written based on publicly available information.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"FTX\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#November 2022 crisis and bankruptcy\n##Background: FTX and Alameda, Binance, and CoinDesk report\n##Crisis begins: Binance FTT sale, sell-off, and withdrawn rescue bid\n##Bankruptcy and unauthorized transactions\n##Widening impact and contagion fears\n##Responses and effects\n###Effects on investors\n###Effects on other cryptocurrency firms and cryptocurrency markets\n###Responses and commentary\n#Legal process\n#Sponsorships\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The season began in September 2022 and continued through to the end of March 2023. During this period, several powerful windstorms formed over the Atlantic and Mediterranean regions, causing damage and disruption to communities across the continent.\n\n## Background and Naming\n\n### Definitions and Naming Conventions\n\nThe naming of European windstorms follows a specific convention, which is similar to that used for hurricanes in the Atlantic. The storms are given names from a pre-determined list, with each name being associated with a particular type of wind speed or direction. The list of names is coordinated by the European Windstorm Naming Authority, which is responsible for ensuring that the same name is not used for multiple storms in the same season.\n\n### Western Group (United Kingdom, Ireland and the Netherlands)\n\nThe Western Group includes the United Kingdom, Ireland, and the Netherlands. This region is prone to strong winds and stormy weather, particularly during the winter months. The storms that form in this region are often associated with low-pressure systems that develop over the Atlantic and move eastwards towards the European coast.\n\n### South-western Group (France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium and Luxembourg)\n\nThe South-western Group includes France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, and Luxembourg. This region is also susceptible to strong winds and stormy weather, particularly during the winter months. The storms that form in this region are often associated with low-pressure systems that develop over the Mediterranean and move northwards towards the European coast.\n\n### Southeastern Mediterranean Group (Greece, Israel and Cyprus)\n\nThe Southeastern Mediterranean Group includes Greece, Israel, and Cyprus. This region is prone to strong winds and stormy weather, particularly during the winter months. The storms that form in this region are often associated with low-pressure systems that develop over the Mediterranean and move northwards towards the European coast.\n\n### Central Mediterranean Group (Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Malta)\n\nThe Central Mediterranean Group includes Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Malta. This region is also susceptible to strong winds and stormy weather, particularly during the winter months. The storms that form in this region are often associated with low-pressure systems that develop over the Mediterranean and move northwards towards the European coast.\n\n### Northern Group (Denmark, Norway and Sweden)\n\nThe Northern Group includes Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. This region is prone to strong winds and stormy weather, particularly during the winter months. The storms that form in this region are often associated with low-pressure systems that develop over the Arctic and move southwards towards the European coast.\n\n### Central & Southern Group (Germany, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Austria)\n\nThe Central & Southern Group includes Germany, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and Austria. This region is also susceptible to strong winds and stormy weather, particularly during the winter months. The storms that form in this region are often associated with low-pressure systems that develop over the European mainland and move westwards towards the Atlantic coast.\n\n### Ex-Atlantic Hurricane\n\nEx-Atlantic hurricanes are low-pressure systems that originate over the Atlantic Ocean and move towards the European coast. These systems can bring strong winds and stormy weather to the region, particularly during the winter months. The storms that form in this region are often associated with the remnants of hurricanes that have moved northwards from the tropics.\n\n## Season Summary\n\nThe 2022–23 European windstorm season was a period of significant weather events that affected various parts of Europe. The season began in September 2022 and continued through to the end of March 2023.

He played a significant role in the development of the English navy and the establishment of the English presence in the New World. Despite his controversial reputation, Drake remains one of the most celebrated figures in English history.\n\n**Birth and Early Years**\n\nFrancis Drake was born around 1540 in Tavistock, Devon, England, to Edmund Drake and his wife, Mary. His father was a Protestant clergyman, and Francis was the eldest of three sons. The family moved to the nearby village of Crowndale, where Francis grew up. Little is known about his early life, but it is believed that he was educated at the local grammar school and later attended the University of Cambridge.\n\n**Early Career at Sea**\n\nDrake's early career at sea was marked by his involvement in the slave trade. He began his maritime career as a teenager, sailing on merchant ships and engaging in privateering expeditions. In 1564, he became a member of a privateering expedition to the Caribbean, where he saw action against Spanish ships. This experience likely influenced his later decision to become a privateer.\n\n**Slave Trade**\n\nAs a young man, Drake became involved in the slave trade, participating in several expeditions to the Caribbean and the coast of Africa. He was likely influenced by the wealth and prestige associated with this trade, which became a significant factor in his later career.\n\n**Expedition of 1572–1573**\n\nIn 1572, Drake joined a privateering expedition to the Caribbean, where he played a key role in several battles against Spanish ships. He was instrumental in capturing several Spanish galleons and amassing a significant fortune. This expedition marked the beginning of Drake's reputation as a skilled naval commander.\n\n**Rathlin Island Massacre**\n\nIn 1574, Drake was involved in the Rathlin Island massacre, a brutal attack on a group of Scottish and Irish prisoners who were being held on the island. The incident remains a source of controversy and has been the subject of much debate among historians.\n\n**Circumnavigation (1577–1580)**\n\nIn 1577, Drake set sail on his most famous expedition, a circumnavigation of the globe. He sailed through the Strait of Magellan at the tip of South America and into the Pacific Ocean, becoming the first Englishman to navigate the Pacific. The expedition was marked by several challenges, including the execution of Thomas Doughty, a member of Drake's crew who was accused of treason.\n\n**Execution of Thomas Doughty**\n\nThomas Doughty was a member of Drake's crew who was accused of treason. The circumstances surrounding his execution are unclear, but it is believed that Doughty was executed by hanging. This incident marked a turning point in Drake's relationship with his crew, who were increasingly wary of his leadership.\n\n**Entering the Pacific (1578)**\n\nDrake entered the Pacific Ocean in 1578, becoming the first Englishman to do so. He sailed up the west coast of North America, visiting present-day California and exploring the coastline. The expedition marked the beginning of English interest in the Pacific and the establishment of a presence on the West Coast.\n\n**Raids on Spanish American West Coast**\n\nDrake and his crew raided several Spanish settlements on the West Coast, including present-day California and Mexico. The expeditions were marked by violence and destruction, and Drake and his crew amassed a significant fortune.\n\n**Coast of California: Nova Albion (1579)**\n\nIn 1579, Drake and his crew visited the coast of present-day California, where they claimed the land for England and named it Nova Albion. The expedition marked the beginning of English interest in the region and the establishment of a presence on the West Coast.\n\n**Across the Pacific and Around Africa**\n\nAfter exploring the Pacific and raiding Spanish settlements, Drake and his crew sailed back across the Pacific and around Africa, becoming the first Englishmen to circumnavigate the globe. The expedition marked a significant achievement in the history of English exploration.\n\n**Return to Plymouth (1580)**\n\nDrake and his crew returned to Plymouth in 1580, where they were greeted as heroes. The expedition marked a significant achievement in the history of English exploration and the establishment of a presence on the West Coast.\n\n**Knighthood and Arms**\n\nDrake was knighted by Queen Elizabeth I for his services to the Crown. He was also granted a coat of arms, which featured a dragon and the motto \"Sic Parvis Magna.\" The coat of arms marked Drake's reputation as a skilled naval commander and his association with the Elizabethan era.\n\n**Political Career**\n\nDrake's political career was marked by his service to the English Crown. He played a significant role in the development of the English navy and the establishment of a presence on the West Coast. He was involved in several expeditions to the Caribbean and the coast of Africa, and he was instrumental in the defeat of the Spanish Armada.\n\n**Great Expedition to America**\n\nIn 1585, Drake led a Great Expedition to America, which aimed to establish a permanent English presence on the West Coast. The expedition was marked by several challenges, including the capture of several Spanish ships and the landing of a group of English settlers on the coast of present-day California.\n\n**Conflict with the Spanish Armada**\n\nDrake played a significant role in the conflict with the Spanish Armada, which was a fleet of Spanish ships that was sent to England in 1588. The Armada was defeated by the English navy, led by Drake and other English commanders.

It was held on June 2, 2022, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. The election was called by Premier Doug Ford on May 4, 2022, and was the third election held in the province since 2018.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Ontario general election is a crucial event in the province's democratic process, allowing voters to elect a new government and give their representatives a mandate to govern for the next four years. The election is typically held every four years, but it can be called earlier if the government is defeated in a confidence vote or if the Premier decides to call an election.\n\nThe 2022 election was significant because it marked the third consecutive election held by the Progressive Conservative (PC) government, which was led by Premier Doug Ford. The PC government had implemented several policies and programs since 2018, including the elimination of the cap-and-trade program, the introduction of a basic income guarantee for low-income workers, and the expansion of the Ontario College of Trades.\n\nThe election also took place against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a significant impact on the province's economy and healthcare system. The pandemic had led to widespread lockdowns, travel restrictions, and the closure of non-essential businesses, which had a significant impact on the province's economy and public health.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n### 2018\n\nThe 2018 Ontario general election was held on June 7, 2018, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. The election was called by Premier Kathleen Wynne on March 28, 2018. The Progressive Conservative (PC) party, led by Doug Ford, won a majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly, defeating the Liberal Party and the New Democratic Party (NDP).\n\n### 2020\n\nThe 2020 Ontario general election was held on October 24, 2020, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. The election was called by Premier Doug Ford on August 3, 2020.

The incident has garnered significant attention and scrutiny, with calls for investigations and explanations from various quarters.\n\n**Background**\n\nPresident Joe Biden has been in office since January 2021, following his election as the 46th President of the United States. As part of his presidential duties, Biden has access to sensitive and classified information. However, the handling and storage of classified documents are governed by strict protocols and regulations, particularly when it comes to presidential records and sensitive information.\n\n**Discoveries and Other Developments**\n\n### First Batch of Documents\n\nThe first batch of classified documents was discovered on November 2, 2022, at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement in Washington, D.C. The center is a think tank affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania, where Biden served as a professor. The documents, which included classified materials from Biden's time as Vice President under Barack Obama, were found in a locked closet.\n\n### DOJ Letter to Bob Bauer\n\nOn November 4, 2022, the Department of Justice (DOJ) sent a letter to Bob Bauer, a lawyer representing the Biden family, informing him of the discovery of the classified documents. The letter stated that the DOJ would be investigating the matter and requested that Bauer cooperate.\n\n### Second Batch of Documents\n\nOn December 13, 2022, it was reported that a second batch of classified documents had been found at Biden's home in Wilmington, Delaware. The documents, which included top-secret materials from Biden's time as Vice President, were discovered in a storage room.\n\n### FBI Search of Biden's Wilmington Home\n\nOn January 2, 2023, the FBI conducted a search of Biden's Wilmington home, as part of the ongoing investigation. The search was authorized by Attorney General Merrick Garland, who had appointed a special counsel to oversee the investigation.\n\n### Other Searches\n\nIn addition to the searches of Biden's homes, the FBI also searched the offices of Biden's lawyers and other locations where classified documents may have been stored.\n\n**Initial Responses**\n\n### Biden and His Legal Team\n\nPresident Biden initially stated that he was \"surprised\" by the discovery of the classified documents and that he had cooperated fully with the investigation. His lawyers have maintained that the documents were stored in a secure location and that Biden had not intentionally attempted to conceal or mishandle them.\n\n### Elected Officials\n\n### Republican Elected Officials\n\nRepublican elected officials, including Senator Chuck Grassley and Representative Jim Jordan, have called for further investigation and have accused Biden of mishandling classified documents. Some have also questioned Biden's fitness for office.\n\n### Democratic Elected Officials\n\nDemocratic elected officials, including Senator Chris Coons and Representative Hakeem Jeffries, have defended Biden and stated that the investigation should be allowed to run its course.\n\n### Media Analysis\n\nMedia outlets have provided varying analyses of the incident, with some focusing on the potential security implications and others on the political fallout.\n\n### Misinformation\n\nThere has been some misinformation circulating on social media, including claims that Biden had deliberately attempted to conceal the classified documents.\n\n### Discovery of Classified Documents at Mike Pence's Residence\n\nIn January 2023, it was reported that classified documents had also been found at the residence of former Vice President Mike Pence. The discovery has raised questions about how widespread the mishandling of classified documents may be.\n\n**Investigations**\n\n### Special Counsel\n\nIn January 2023, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel to oversee the investigation into the classified documents. The special counsel is tasked with determining whether Biden or his team intentionally mishandled the documents.\n\n### Decision That Charges Were Unwarranted\n\nIn March 2023, the special counsel announced that charges were unwarranted in the case, citing a lack of evidence that Biden had intentionally mishandled the documents.\n\n### Comments on Biden's Memory\n\nThe special counsel also commented on Biden's memory of the documents, stating that Biden had provided inconsistent accounts of his knowledge of the documents.\n\n**Congressional**\n\nCongress has begun to scrutinize the incident and has called for hearings and investigations. The House Oversight Committee has launched an investigation into the matter, with a focus on the handling of classified documents.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Joe Biden\n* Classified information\n* National Archives and Records Administration\n* Department of Justice\n* Federal Bureau of Investigation\n* Special counsel", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Joe_Biden_classified_documents_incident\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Discoveries and other developments\n##First batch of documents\n##DOJ letter to Bob Bauer\n##Second batch of documents\n##FBI search of Biden's Wilmington home\n##Other searches\n#Initial responses\n##Biden and his legal team\n##Elected officials\n###Republican elected officials\n###Democratic elected officials\n##Media analysis\n##Misinformation\n##Discovery of classified documents at Mike Pence's residence\n#Investigations\n##Special counsel\n###Decision that charges were unwarranted\n###Comments on Biden's memory\n##Congressional\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The battle was a significant defensive victory for the United Nations Command (UNC) and marked a turning point in the war.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Korean War began in June 1950, following the invasion of South Korea by North Korean forces. The UNC, led by the United States, launched a counterattack, but the war quickly bogged down into a stalemate. In April 1951, the UNC and Chinese forces clashed in the Kapyong Valley, a strategic location that controlled access to Seoul, the capital city of South Korea.\n\n**Military Situation**\n\nBy April 1951, the UNC had established a defensive line along the 38th parallel, which had been breached by Chinese forces during the previous winter's fighting. The UNC had regrouped and reorganized its forces, preparing to launch a counterattack to drive the Chinese out of South Korea. The UNC forces in the Kapyong Valley were led by the 1st Canadian Infantry Brigade, which had been deployed to Korea in February 1951.\n\n**Chinese Spring Offensive**\n\nIn April 1951, the Chinese launched a massive spring offensive, aimed at retaking the initiative in the war. The Chinese forces, numbering over 100,000 soldiers, pushed forward in a series of waves, attempting to break through the UNC defensive line. The UNC, however, was well-prepared and had established a series of strongpoints, including the village of Kapyong, which controlled access to the valley.\n\n**Preparations**\n\nIn anticipation of the Chinese attack, the UNC forces in the Kapyong Valley had prepared a series of defensive positions, including trenches, foxholes, and strongpoints. The Australian 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR), had taken up positions on Hill 504, a strategic location that dominated the Kapyong Valley. The Canadian 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (2 PPCLI), had established a defensive position on Hill 677, another key location in the valley.\n\n**Launch of Chinese Spring Offensive**\n\nOn April 22, 1951, the Chinese launched their spring offensive, pushing forward with a series of waves of soldiers. The UNC forces, however, were well-prepared and held their ground, inflicting heavy casualties on the Chinese. The Australian 3 RAR, led by Lieutenant Colonel Ian MacKay, defended Hill 504, while the Canadian 2 PPCLI, led by Lieutenant Colonel James Stone, defended Hill 677.\n\n**South Korean Withdrawal, 22-23 April 1951**\n\nAs the Chinese attack gained momentum, the South Korean 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry Regiment, withdrew from the Kapyong Valley, leaving the UNC forces to hold the line. The Australian 3 RAR and Canadian 2 PPCLI were forced to assume additional defensive positions, including the village of Kapyong, which was heavily attacked by Chinese forces.\n\n**Australian 3 RAR Defence of Hill 504, 23-24 April 1951**\n\nOn April 23, 1951, the Australian 3 RAR launched a counterattack against the Chinese forces on Hill 504, pushing them back and reclaiming the high ground. The Australians then dug in, preparing for a night battle against the Chinese, who launched a series of attacks against the Australian positions. The Australians held their ground, inflicting heavy casualties on the Chinese.\n\n**Night Battle**\n\nThe night battle on Hill 504 was intense, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. The Australians used artillery and machine guns to devastating effect, cutting down Chinese attackers as they approached the Australian positions. The Chinese, however, continued to push forward, using sheer numbers to try and break through the Australian line.\n\n**Day Battle**\n\nOn the morning of April 24, 1951, the Chinese launched a day battle against the Australian positions on Hill 504. The Australians, however, were well-prepared and held their ground, inflicting heavy casualties on the Chinese. The Australians then launched a counterattack, pushing the Chinese back and reclaiming the high ground.\n\n**3 RAR Withdraws**\n\nAfter a series of fierce battles, the Australian 3 RAR withdrew from Hill 504 on April 24, 1951, having held their ground against overwhelming Chinese forces. The Canadians, however, continued to defend Hill 677, which was heavily attacked by Chinese forces.\n\n**Canadian 2 PPCLI Last Stand on Hill 677, 24-25 April 1951**\n\nOn April 24, 1951, the Canadian 2 PPCLI launched a last stand against the Chinese forces on Hill 677, preparing to defend the high ground to the death. The Canadians dug in, using machine guns and artillery to devastating effect, cutting down Chinese attackers as they approached the Canadian positions.\n\n**Preparations**\n\nThe Canadians had prepared a series of defensive positions on Hill 677, including a fortified farm house, which dominated the surrounding terrain. The Canadians had also established a series of rifle pits and machine gun positions, which they used to devastating effect against the Chinese.\n\n**Night Battle**\n\nOn the night of April 24, 1951, the Chinese launched a series of attacks against the Canadian positions on Hill 677. The Canadians held their ground, inflicting heavy casualties on the Chinese. The Canadians then launched a counterattack, pushing the Chinese back and reclaiming the high ground.\n\n**Final 2 PPCLI Operations**\n\nOn the morning of April 25, 1951, the Canadian 2 PPCLI launched a final operation against the Chinese forces on Hill 677. The Canadians pushed forward, inflicting heavy casualties on the Chinese, and reclaimed the high ground.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe Battle of Kapyong was a pivotal engagement fought during the Korean War, taking place from April 22 to 25, 1951, in the vicinity of Kapyong, South Korea. The battle was a significant defensive victory for the United Nations Command (UNC) and marked a turning point in the war.\n\n**Summary and Casualties**\n\nThe UNC forces suffered heavy casualties during the battle, including over 900 killed or wounded. The Chinese forces, however, suffered even heavier casualties, with estimates suggesting over 3,000 killed or wounded.\n\n**Awards**\n\nThe Battle of Kapyong was recognized as a significant military engagement, with several awards and decorations being granted to the UNC forces who fought in the battle.\n\n**Subsequent Operations**\n\nThe Battle of Kapyong was a turning point in the Korean War, marking a shift in the momentum of the conflict. The UNC forces, led by the United States, continued to push forward, eventually driving the Chinese out of South Korea and back to the 38th parallel.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Korean War\n* United Nations Command\n* Chinese Spring Offensive\n* Australian 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment\n* Canadian 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The battle is also known as the Battle of Kapyong Valley or the Battle of Hill 677.\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: No references or citations have been included in this article, as per the requirements.)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Battle_of_Kapyong\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Military situation\n#Chinese Spring Offensive\n##Preparations\n##Launch of Chinese Spring Offensive\n##South Korean withdrawal, 22–23 April 1951\n#Australian 3 RAR defence of Hill 504, 23–24 April 1951\n##Night battle\n##Day battle\n##3 RAR withdraws\n#Canadian 2 PPCLI last stand on Hill 677, 24–25 April 1951\n##Preparations\n##Night battle\n##Final 2 PPCLI Operations\n#Aftermath\n##Summary and casualties\n##Awards\n##Subsequent operations\n#See also\n#Notes\n##Footnotes\n##Citations\n#References\n#Further reading\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
