The series features images of Campbell's soup cans, which were produced by the Campbell's Soup Company. The artwork is considered a quintessential example of Pop Art, a movement that emerged in the 1960s, characterized by its focus on popular culture and consumer products. The Campbell's Soup Cans series is widely regarded as one of the most iconic and influential artworks of the 20th century.\n\n**Early career**\n\n### New York art scene\n\nIn the early 1960s, Warhol was a prominent figure in the New York art scene, known for his experimental and avant-garde approach to art. He had already gained recognition for his work in film and photography, and his interest in popular culture and consumer products was well-established. Warhol's fascination with Campbell's soup cans was likely inspired by their ubiquity and familiarity in American culture.\n\n### Pop art\n\nThe Pop Art movement, which emerged in the late 1950s, emphasized the use of popular culture and consumer products as subject matter. Warhol, along with other artists such as Roy Lichtenstein and Jasper Johns, was instrumental in shaping the movement's aesthetic and themes. The use of everyday objects, such as Campbell's soup cans, in art challenged traditional notions of art as a rarefied and elite pursuit.\n\n**Premiere**\n\n### Subsequent publicity\n\nThe Campbell's Soup Cans series premiered in 1962 at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles, California. The exhibition was a major success, attracting widespread attention and critical acclaim. The series was later exhibited at the Tate Gallery in London, further cementing its status as a landmark work of Pop Art.\n\n**Campbell's Soup Company**\n\n### Can and label history\n\nCampbell's Soup Company was founded in 1869 by Joseph A. Campbell, and it quickly became a leading manufacturer of canned soup in the United States. The company's cans were designed to be durable, easy to open, and affordable, making them accessible to a wide range of consumers. The label design, featuring a red and white color scheme and the company's iconic logo, became synonymous with the product.\n\n### Relation to Warhol's art\n\nWarhol's use of Campbell's soup cans in his art was a deliberate subversion of the company's branding and marketing efforts. By taking the familiar and banal image of a soup can and elevating it to the status of art, Warhol highlighted the ways in which consumer culture and advertising shape our perceptions of reality. The Campbell's Soup Cans series also served as a commentary on the banality and ubiquity of consumer products in modern life.\n\n**Inspiration**\n\n### Artist colleagues\n\nWarhol's use of Campbell's soup cans in his art was influenced by his relationships with other artists, including Roy Lichtenstein and Jasper Johns. Lichtenstein's use of comic book imagery and Johns' use of everyday objects as subject matter were both precursors to Warhol's work. Warhol's use of Campbell's soup cans was also inspired by the artist's fascination with the mundane and the banal.\n\n**Interpretation**\n\nThe Campbell's Soup Cans series has been interpreted in a variety of ways over the years. Some critics have seen it as a commentary on the banality and ubiquity of consumer culture, while others have viewed it as a celebration of the beauty and simplicity of everyday objects. The series has also been seen as a commentary on the role of advertising and branding in shaping our perceptions of reality.\n\n**Variations**\n\n### Campbell's Soup I and Campbell's Soup Cans II\n\nWarhol created two major variations of the Campbell's Soup Cans series, Campbell's Soup I and Campbell's Soup Cans II. The former, created in 1962, features a more minimalist and straightforward approach, with a focus on the iconic image of the soup can. The latter, created in 1962, features a more experimental and expressive approach, with a focus on the use of color and texture.\n\n### Colored soup cans\n\nIn 1964, Warhol created a series of colored soup cans, which featured the iconic image of the soup can in a range of vibrant colors. The use of color added a new layer of depth and complexity to the series, and highlighted the ways in which Warhol's use of everyday objects could be transformed and reinterpreted.\n\n### Unauthorized versions\n\nOver the years, a number of unauthorized versions of the Campbell's Soup Cans series have been created, often using the original images and designs without permission from the artist or the Campbell's Soup Company. These versions have been widely available in gift shops and online, and have helped to further cement the series' status as a cultural icon.\n\n### Other variations\n\nIn addition to the major variations of the Campbell's Soup Cans series, Warhol also created a number of other works that featured the iconic image of the soup can. These works included prints, paintings, and even a series of photographs. Each of these works offered a unique perspective on the series and its themes, and highlighted the ways in which Warhol's use of everyday objects could be transformed and reinterpreted.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Campbell's Soup Cans series is a landmark work of Pop Art, widely regarded as one of the most iconic and influential artworks of the 20th century. The series' use of everyday objects, such as Campbell's soup cans, challenged traditional notions of art as a rarefied and elite pursuit, and highlighted the ways in which consumer culture and advertising shape our perceptions of reality. The series has been interpreted in a variety of ways over the years, and its themes and motifs continue to be relevant today.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Pop Art\n* Andy Warhol\n* Roy Lichtenstein\n* Jasper Johns\n* Campbell's Soup Company\n* Ferus Gallery\n* Tate Gallery\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The Campbell's Soup Cans series is widely regarded as one of the most iconic and influential artworks of the 20th century.\n* The series was a major success, attracting widespread attention and critical acclaim.\n* The use of everyday objects, such as Campbell's soup cans, in art challenged traditional notions of art as a rarefied and elite pursuit.\n* The series has been interpreted in a variety of ways over the years, including as a commentary on the banality and ubiquity of consumer culture.\n\n**References**\n\n* Warhol, A.

The mission aimed to send the Orion spacecraft on a lunar flyby, testing its systems and paving the way for future crewed missions to the Moon and beyond.\n\n**Mission Profile**\n\nThe Artemis I mission profile was designed to test the Orion spacecraft's systems in a lunar flyby configuration. The spacecraft was equipped with a crew module and a service module, which provided power, propulsion, and life support systems.\n\n### Mission Profile Animation\n\nA mission profile animation was created to visualize the Artemis I mission trajectory. The animation showed the Orion spacecraft launching from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39B, followed by a series of burns in Earth orbit, a trans-lunar injection (TLI) burn, and a lunar flyby. The animation also depicted the spacecraft's return journey to Earth, including a series of re-entry burns and a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Artemis I mission was the culmination of years of work by NASA and its partners to develop a new heavy-lift rocket and a next-generation spacecraft. The mission was designed to test the SLS rocket's ability to send a spacecraft on a lunar flyby, while also testing the Orion spacecraft's systems and capabilities.\n\n### Ground Testing\n\nThe SLS rocket underwent a series of ground tests at NASA's Stennis Space Center in Mississippi, where the rocket's four RS-25 engines were tested and verified. The Orion spacecraft also underwent a series of tests, including a pad abort test and an acoustic test.\n\n### Assembly\n\nThe SLS rocket and the Orion spacecraft were assembled at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The rocket's four RS-25 engines were installed in the rocket's core stage, while the Orion spacecraft was integrated with the SLS rocket's upper stage.\n\n### Launch Preparations\n\nThe Artemis I mission was launched on November 16, 2022, from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39B. The launch was delayed several times due to technical issues and weather concerns.\n\n### Initial Launch Attempts\n\nThe Artemis I mission was initially scheduled to launch on September 2, 2022, but the launch was scrubbed due to a technical issue with the SLS rocket's core stage. The launch was rescheduled for September 3, but it was again scrubbed due to a problem with the rocket's upper stage. The launch was eventually rescheduled for November 16, 2022.\n\n**Flight**\n\nThe Artemis I mission was launched on November 16, 2022, at 1:47 a.m. EST. The SLS rocket lifted off from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39B and sent the Orion spacecraft on a lunar flyby trajectory.\n\n### Launch\n\nThe SLS rocket lifted off from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39B, experiencing a minor anomaly during the TLI burn. The rocket's four RS-25 engines performed nominally, sending the Orion spacecraft on its way to the Moon.\n\n### Outbound Flight\n\nThe Orion spacecraft traveled through space for 25 days, performing a series of burns to adjust its trajectory and ensure a precise lunar flyby. The spacecraft's systems were tested and verified, including its power, propulsion, and life support systems.\n\n### Lunar Orbit\n\nThe Orion spacecraft entered into a lunar orbit on November 26, 2022, where it remained for several hours. The spacecraft's systems were tested and verified, and it captured stunning images of the Moon's surface.\n\n### Return Flight\n\nThe Orion spacecraft left lunar orbit on November 26, 2022, and began its return journey to Earth. The spacecraft performed a series of re-entry burns to slow down and prepare for entry into the Earth's atmosphere.\n\n### Reentry and Splashdown\n\nThe Orion spacecraft re-entered the Earth's atmosphere on December 11, 2022, and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean. The spacecraft's systems performed nominally, and it successfully completed its lunar flyby mission.\n\n**Payloads**\n\nThe Artemis I mission carried several payloads, including a series of cubesats. The cubesats were designed to test and demonstrate various technologies, including navigation, communication, and propulsion systems.\n\n### Cubesats\n\nThe Artemis I mission carried several cubesats, including the ArgoMoon, the NeMO-Insight, the BioSentinel, the Near-Earth Asteroid Scout (NEAS), and the Lunar Flashlight. The cubesats were designed to test and demonstrate various technologies, including navigation, communication, and propulsion systems.\n\n**Media Outreach**\n\nThe Artemis I mission received extensive media coverage, with multiple news outlets and social media platforms following the mission's progress. The mission's success marked a major milestone for NASA and its partners, and it paved the way for future crewed missions to the Moon and beyond.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Artemis program\n* Space Launch System (SLS)\n* Orion spacecraft\n* Lunar flyby\n* Re-entry\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The Artemis I mission was the first major test of NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and the Orion spacecraft.\n* The mission marked a major milestone for NASA and its partners, and it paved the way for future crewed missions to the Moon and beyond.\n\n**References**\n\nN/A\n\n**External Links**\n\n* NASA's Artemis I Mission Website\n* NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) Website\n* NASA's Orion Spacecraft Website\n* NASA's Artemis Program Website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Artemis_I\" following this outline:\n\n#Mission profile\n##Mission profile animation\n#Background\n##Ground testing\n##Assembly\n##Launch preparations\n##Initial launch attempts\n#Flight\n##Launch\n##Outbound flight\n##Lunar orbit\n##Return flight\n##Reentry and splashdown\n#Payloads\n##Cubesats\n#Media outreach\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It was the 47th federal election in Australian history and the first federal election held under the new electoral boundaries.\n\nBackground\n\nPrevious election\nThe previous federal election was held in 2019, in which the Liberal Party of Australia, led by Scott Morrison, won a narrow victory over the Australian Labor Party, led by Bill Shorten.\n\nComposition of parliament\nAt the time of the 2022 election, the Australian Parliament consisted of 151 members of the House of Representatives and 76 senators. The Liberal Party held 76 seats in the House of Representatives, the Labor Party held 68 seats, and there were 7 independent members.\n\nEvents of the 46th Parliament\nDuring the 46th Parliament, several significant events occurred, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the Black Summer bushfires, and the 2020 Australian bushfire season. The Morrison government introduced several policies, including the JobKeeper wage subsidy and the JobSeeker payment, in response to the pandemic.\n\nChange in party registration rules\nIn 2021, the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) introduced new rules for party registration, requiring parties to meet stricter requirements to be registered for the 2022 election. The rules included a requirement for parties to have at least 500 members and to have a nominated leader.\n\nParty preselection issues\nPrior to the 2022 election, several parties experienced preselection issues, including the Labor Party and the Liberal Party. The Labor Party faced allegations of factionalism and branch stacking, while the Liberal Party faced allegations of factional infighting and branch stacking.\n\nIndependents\nSeveral independent candidates contested the 2022 election, including Zali Steggall, Helen Haines, and Andrew Wilkie. These candidates were seen as potential kingmakers in the event of a hung parliament.\n\nElectoral system\nThe Australian electoral system is a preferential voting system, in which voters rank candidates in order of preference. The system is used to elect members of the House of Representatives and senators.\n\nState of electorates\nPrior to the 2022 election, the AEC conducted a redistribution of electoral boundaries to ensure that the number of voters in each electorate was approximately equal. The redistribution resulted in the creation of new electorates and the abolition of several existing electorates.\n\nRedistribution\nThe redistribution of electoral boundaries resulted in several changes to the electoral map.

It is a crucial tool in modern timekeeping, allowing for precise synchronization of clocks around the world and enabling scientists to study the fundamental laws of physics.\n\n# History\n\n## Definition of the Second\n\nThe definition of the second is the foundation of atomic clocks. In 1967, the International System of Units (SI) redefined the second as the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom. This definition is based on the fact that the energy difference between these two levels is extremely stable and can be measured with high precision.\n\n## Metrology Advancements and Optical Clocks\n\nThe development of atomic clocks has been driven by advances in metrology, the science of measurement. The first atomic clocks used microwave radiation to measure the frequency of the caesium atom, but more recent developments have led to the creation of optical clocks that use laser light to measure the frequency of atoms such as ytterbium and strontium. These optical clocks have achieved even higher accuracy than microwave clocks, with some estimates suggesting that they can measure time to within a few seconds over the age of the universe.\n\n## Chip-Scale Atomic Clocks\n\nIn recent years, there has been a significant development in the field of chip-scale atomic clocks. These clocks are designed to be compact and low-power, making them ideal for use in a wide range of applications, from consumer electronics to scientific research. Chip-scale atomic clocks use a combination of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and quantum mechanics to create a stable atomic clock that can be integrated onto a silicon chip.\n\n# Measuring Time with Atomic Clocks\n\n## Clock Mechanism\n\nAn atomic clock works by using a beam of atoms to measure the frequency of a specific atomic transition. The clock consists of three main components: a beam of atoms, a resonant cavity, and a detector. The beam of atoms is passed through the resonant cavity, where it interacts with a laser or microwave radiation. The detector then measures the frequency of the radiation emitted by the atoms, which is proportional to the frequency of the atomic transition.\n\n## Tuning and Optimization\n\nTo achieve high accuracy, atomic clocks require careful tuning and optimization of the resonant cavity and the laser or microwave radiation. The cavity must be tuned to the precise frequency of the atomic transition, and the radiation must be optimized to ensure that it interacts with the atoms in the correct way. This requires a deep understanding of the physics of the atomic transition and the behavior of the atoms in the clock.\n\n# Accuracy\n\nAtomic clocks are extremely accurate, with some clocks achieving an error of only one second over tens of millions of years. This level of accuracy is achieved through a combination of careful design and precise tuning of the clock. The stability of the clock is also critical, as any fluctuations in the frequency of the atomic transition can cause the clock to drift away from the correct time.\n\n# Comparing Atomic Clocks\n\n## Time Standards\n\nAtomic clocks are used as time standards around the world, with many countries maintaining their own atomic clock ensembles. These clocks are used to synchronize clocks and other devices, ensuring that they are all running at the same rate.\n\n## Synchronization with Satellites\n\nAtomic clocks are also used to synchronize clocks with satellites, such as those used in global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). These clocks are used to provide accurate timing and location information to users around the world.\n\n## International Timekeeping\n\nAtomic clocks play a crucial role in international timekeeping, with many countries participating in the International System of Units (SI) and the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS). These organizations work together to maintain a consistent and accurate definition of time and to ensure that clocks around the world are synchronized.\n\n## Fiber Optics\n\nFiber optic clocks are a type of atomic clock that uses fiber optic cables to transmit the clock signal. These clocks are highly accurate and can be used in a wide range of applications, from scientific research to telecommunications.\n\n# Microwave Atomic Clocks\n\n## Caesium\n\nCaesium atomic clocks are the most common type of atomic clock. They use the caesium-133 atom to measure the frequency of the radiation emitted by the atom. The caesium clock is a highly stable clock that can achieve an error of only one second over tens of millions of years.\n\n### Block Diagram\n\nA block diagram of a caesium clock is shown below:\n\n*   **Atomic beam source**: Produces a beam of caesium atoms\n*   **Magnet**: Used to steer the atomic beam\n*   **Resonant cavity**: Where the atomic beam interacts with the radiation\n*   **Detector**: Measures the frequency of the radiation emitted by the atoms\n*   **Stabilizer**: Maintains the frequency of the clock\n\n## Rubidium\n\nRubidium atomic clocks are also highly accurate and are used in a wide range of applications. They use the rubidium-87 atom to measure the frequency of the radiation emitted by the atom.\n\n## Hydrogen\n\nHydrogen atomic clocks are a type of atomic clock that uses the hydrogen atom to measure the frequency of the radiation emitted by the atom. These clocks are highly accurate and can achieve an error of only one second over tens of millions of years.\n\n# Other Types of Atomic Clocks\n\n## Quantum Clocks\n\nQuantum clocks are a type of atomic clock that use the principles of quantum mechanics to measure time. These clocks are highly accurate and can achieve an error of only one second over tens of millions of years.\n\n## Nuclear Clock Concept\n\nThe nuclear clock concept is a type of atomic clock that uses the energy levels of atomic nuclei to measure time. These clocks are highly accurate and can achieve an error of only one second over tens of millions of years.\n\n# Potential for Redefining the Second\n\n## Rydberg Constant\n\nThe Rydberg constant is a fundamental constant of nature that is used to define the second. It is a measure of the energy difference between atomic energy levels and is used to calculate the frequency of atomic transitions.\n\n## Requirements\n\nTo redefine the second, a new definition of the Rydberg constant must be established. This requires a deep understanding of the physics of atomic transitions and the behavior of atoms in the clock.\n\n## Secondary Representations of the Second\n\nSecondary representations of the second are alternative definitions of the second that are based on the Rydberg constant. These definitions are used to calculate the frequency of atomic transitions and to determine the accuracy of atomic clocks.\n\n# Applications\n\n## Global Navigation Satellite Systems\n\nAtomic clocks are used in global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) to provide accurate timing and location information to users around the world. These clocks are used to synchronize the satellites and to ensure that they are all running at the same rate.\n\n### Experimental Space Clock\n\nThe experimental space clock is a type of atomic clock that is designed to be used in space. It is a highly accurate clock that can achieve an error of only one second over tens of millions of years.\n\n### Military Usage\n\nAtomic clocks are also used in military applications, such as navigation and timing.

She was the third of eight children born to the family. Murmu's early life was marked by hardship, as her family struggled to make ends meet. She began her education at the local government school and later moved to Rairangpur High School, where she completed her secondary education.\n\nMurmu's father passed away when she was young, and her mother remarried. Despite the challenges she faced, Murmu persevered and pursued her education, eventually earning a bachelor's degree in arts from Rama Devi Women's College in Bhubaneswar.\n\nEarly career\n\nAfter completing her education, Murmu began her career as a teacher at the Rairangpur High School. She worked as a teacher for several years, during which time she became involved in local politics. In 1997, Murmu joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and began her ascent through the party's ranks.\n\nMurmu's entry into politics was a significant moment in her life. She was one of the few women from her community who had the courage to take on a leadership role. Her commitment to social justice and her willingness to challenge the status quo made her a compelling figure in the BJP.\n\nPolitical career\n\nMurmu's entry into politics marked the beginning of a long and storied career. She quickly rose through the ranks of the BJP, becoming a prominent leader in the party. In 2002, Murmu was appointed as the State Vice-President of the BJP in Odisha. Her work in the party earned her recognition, and she was soon appointed as the State President of the BJP in Odisha.\n\nIn 2007, Murmu was appointed as the Minister of State for Commerce and Transport in the Government of Odisha. Her tenure as Minister was marked by significant achievements, including the launch of several initiatives to promote economic growth and social development.\n\nGovernor of Jharkhand (2015–2021)\n\nIn May 2015, Murmu was appointed as the Governor of Jharkhand. Her appointment was seen as a significant moment in the history of the state, as she became the first tribal woman to hold the office of Governor.\n\nPathalgadi movement\n\nDuring her tenure as Governor, Murmu faced several challenges, including the Pathalgadi movement. The movement, which emerged in the districts of Khunti, Simdega, and West Singhbhum, aimed to assert the rights of the local tribal communities. Murmu played a key role in resolving the crisis, using her mediation skills to bring the parties together.\n\nReligion and land bill\n\nMurmu also faced criticism for her support of the Jharkhand Regulation of Foreign Contribution (Amendment) Act, 2016. The Act aimed to regulate foreign contributions to NGOs in the state, but critics argued that it was designed to silence dissenting voices. Murmu defended the Act, saying that it was necessary to prevent foreign interference in the state's affairs.\n\nPresidential campaign\n\nIn 2022, Murmu announced her candidacy for the office of President of India. Her campaign was marked by significant momentum, as she became the first woman to run for the office from a tribal background. Murmu's campaign focused on issues such as economic development, education, and social justice.\n\nPresidency (2022–present)\n\nOn July 21, 2022, Murmu was elected as the 15th President of India, becoming the first woman from a tribal background to hold the office.

Discovery\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery is a multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate formed through the merger of WarnerMedia and Discovery, Inc. in 2021. The company is a direct result of a strategic combination of two major media conglomerates, bringing together a diverse portfolio of well-known brands, networks, and content production studios.\n\nBackground\n\nThe history of Warner Bros. Discovery can be traced back to the early 20th century, when the Warner Bros. studio was founded in 1923 by the four Warner brothers: Harry, Albert, Samuel, and Jack. Initially, the studio focused on producing low-budget films, but it soon expanded to become one of the major players in the American film industry.\n\n### 1923–1979\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, Warner Bros. established itself as a leading producer of films, with a focus on genres such as westerns and gangster movies. The studio's most notable releases during this period include The Public Enemy (1931) and The Maltese Falcon (1931). In the 1940s and 1950s, Warner Bros. continued to produce a wide range of films, including dramas, musicals, and comedies.\n\n### 1979–1994\n\nIn 1979, Warner Communications merged with Time Inc. to form Warner Communications, Inc.

Born on September 29, 1935, in Ferriday, Louisiana, Lewis has had a storied career spanning over six decades, with a diverse range of musical styles that have captivated audiences worldwide.\n\n**Early life**\n\nLewis was the youngest of the three children born to Elmo and Mamie Lewis. His parents were devout Pentecostal Christians who instilled in him a strong faith, which would later influence his music and personal life. Lewis's early life was marked by a love for music, which he began playing at the age of five. He was largely self-taught on the piano, but he also received formal lessons from a local teacher. Lewis's family moved to Memphis, Tennessee, when he was nine years old, and it was there that he began performing on local radio stations and at local events.\n\n**Career**\n\nLewis's music career began in the late 1950s, but it was not until the early 1960s that he gained widespread recognition. His breakthrough came when he signed with Sun Records, a Memphis-based label that was home to other notable artists such as Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash.\n\n### J&M Studio\n\nLewis's early recordings were made at J&M Studio, a small studio located above the Wee Bee Records store in Memphis. The studio was owned by Jack Clement, a producer and musician who would later become a prominent figure in Lewis's career. At J&M Studio, Lewis recorded his first single, \"Crazy Arms,\" which was released in 1956. The song was a moderate success, but it was his follow-up single, \"End of the Road,\" that brought him his first taste of fame.\n\n### Sun Records\n\nIn 1957, Lewis signed with Sun Records, where he began working with Sam Phillips, the label's founder. Phillips saw Lewis as a raw talent with a unique style, and he worked extensively with him to develop his sound. During his time at Sun Records, Lewis recorded some of his most iconic songs, including \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\" and \"Great Balls of Fire.\" These songs were released in 1957 and 1958, respectively, and they became huge hits, propelling Lewis to national fame.\n\n### Marriage controversy\n\nLewis's marriage to his 13-year-old cousin, Myra Gale Brown, in 1957 caused a scandal that damaged his career. The marriage was seen as a publicity stunt, and it was widely condemned by the public and the media. The controversy surrounding the marriage led to Lewis being blacklisted by many radio stations and promoters, and it took him several years to recover from the backlash.\n\n### Smash Records\n\nIn 1963, Lewis signed with Smash Records, a label that was owned by Mercury Records. During his time at Smash, Lewis released several albums, including \"The Return of Rock\" and \"Another Place, Another Time.\" These albums were commercial successes, but they did not match the level of success he had achieved at Sun Records.\n\n### Live at the Star Club, Hamburg\n\nIn 1964, Lewis embarked on a European tour, which included a performance at the Star Club in Hamburg, Germany. The performance was recorded and released as a live album, which was a commercial success. The album was notable for its raw and energetic sound, which was characteristic of Lewis's live performances.\n\n### Country comeback\n\nIn the late 1960s, Lewis experienced a resurgence in popularity, largely due to his country-pop sound. He released several albums, including \"Another Place, Another Time\" and \"She Still Comes Around (To Love You),\" which were both commercial successes. Lewis's country sound was characterized by his use of pedal steel guitar and his emphasis on storytelling through his lyrics.\n\n### Grand Ole Opry appearance\n\nIn 1968, Lewis made his debut appearance on the Grand Ole Opry, which was a major milestone in his career. The Opry was a prestigious institution in country music, and Lewis's appearance was seen as a recognition of his talent and contributions to the genre.\n\n### The Session and Southern Roots\n\nIn the 1970s, Lewis released several albums, including \"The Session\" and \"Southern Roots,\" which were both critical and commercial successes. These albums were notable for their blend of country, rock, and gospel sounds, which was characteristic of Lewis's eclectic style.\n\n### Later career\n\nIn the 1980s, Lewis continued to release music, although at a slower pace than in the past. He also began to tour more extensively, performing in the United States and abroad. Lewis's later career was marked by a renewed focus on his gospel roots, and he released several albums that featured gospel-inspired music.\n\n**Music legacy**\n\nLewis's music legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century, and his impact on rock and roll, country, and gospel music is still felt today. Lewis's unique style, which blended elements of rock, country, and gospel, helped to pave the way for future generations of musicians.\n\n### Accolades\n\nLewis has received numerous accolades throughout his career, including a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, and a Country Music Hall of Fame induction. He has also been named one of the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time by Rolling Stone magazine.\n\n### Piano style\n\nLewis's piano style is characterized by his use of a distinctive finger-picking technique, which was influenced by his gospel roots. His piano playing is often described as raw and energetic, with a strong emphasis on rhythm and groove. Lewis's piano style has been cited as an influence by numerous musicians, including Elton John and Billy Joel.\n\n**Personal life**\n\nLewis's personal life has been marked by controversy and scandal. He was married seven times, including his infamous marriage to his 13-year-old cousin, Myra Gale Brown. Lewis has also been open about his struggles with addiction and his experiences with the music industry.\n\n### Relationships and children\n\nLewis has been married seven times, and he has five children from his various marriages. His children have been involved in his music career, with some of them performing with him on stage.\n\n### Religious beliefs\n\nLewis is a devout Pentecostal Christian, and his faith has played a significant role in his life and music. He has often incorporated gospel and Christian themes into his songs, and he has been open about his spiritual experiences.\n\n### Graceland arrest\n\nIn 1973, Lewis was arrested at Elvis Presley's Graceland estate, where he had been attending a party. Lewis was charged with disorderly conduct and possession of a firearm, and he was later fined and released on bail.\n\n### Debt\n\nLewis has struggled with debt throughout his career, including a $250,000 debt to the IRS in the 1980s. He has also been sued by creditors and has had to file for bankruptcy protection.\n\n### Health and death\n\nLewis has experienced health problems throughout his life, including heart disease and stroke. He has undergone several surgeries and has been hospitalized on several occasions. Lewis passed away on October 28, 2022, at the age of 87.\n\n**Selected discography**\n\n* \"Crazy Arms\" (1956)\n* \"End of the Road\" (1956)\n* \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\" (1957)\n* \"Great Balls of Fire\" (1958)\n* \"The Return of Rock\" (1963)\n* \"Another Place, Another Time\" (1963)\n* \"Another Place, Another Time\" (1964)\n* \"She Still Comes Around (To Love You)\" (1967)\n* \"The Session\" (1973)\n* \"Southern Roots\" (1974)\n\n**Compositions**\n\n* \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\"\n* \"Great Balls of Fire\"\n* \"You Win Again\"\n* \"Breathless\"\n* \"High Heel Sneakers\"\n\n**References**\n\n* \"The Life and Times of Jerry Lee Lewis\" by Rick Bragg (2007)\n* \"Jerry Lee Lewis: The Biography\" by Robert Hilburn (2013)\n* \"Jerry Lee Lewis: The Man and the Music\" by Charles M.

This history is marked by various conflicts, wars, and peacekeeping efforts that have shaped the country's development and identity.\n\n**Warfare pre-contact**\n\nBefore the arrival of European settlers, the indigenous peoples of Canada engaged in various forms of warfare, often to protect their lands, resources, and communities. These conflicts were typically small-scale and localized, with different tribes and nations having their own distinct cultural and military traditions.\n\n**European contact**\n\nThe arrival of European explorers and settlers in the 16th century introduced new forms of warfare to North America. The French and British, in particular, established colonies and trading posts, which led to conflicts with indigenous peoples over resources and territory.\n\n**17th century**\n\nThe 17th century saw the beginning of major conflicts in North America, including:\n\n### **Beaver Wars (1609–1667)**\n\nThe Beaver Wars were a series of conflicts between the French and the Iroquois Confederacy over control of the beaver trade. The wars lasted for nearly 60 years, with the French ultimately emerging victorious.\n\n### **Beaver Wars (1668–1701)**\n\nThe second phase of the Beaver Wars saw the French establish a series of forts and trading posts in the Great Lakes region, leading to further conflicts with the Iroquois.\n\n**Early British-French colonial hostilities**\n\nThe 17th century also saw the beginning of British-French colonial competition in North America.

The Kansas City Chiefs, representing the American Football Conference (AFC), faced the Philadelphia Eagles, representing the National Football Conference (NFC), in the 57th edition of the Super Bowl.\n\n# Background\n\n## Host Selection\n\nThe host city for Super Bowl LVII was announced on May 22, 2020, when the NFL owners voted to award the game to State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. The stadium, which has a seating capacity of over 63,000, has hosted several high-profile events, including the Fiesta Bowl and the College Football Playoff National Championship.\n\n## Calls for Location Change\n\nIn the months leading up to the game, there were calls for the NFL to change the location of Super Bowl LVII due to Arizona's controversial \"stand your ground\" law, which critics argued was discriminatory against the LGBTQ+ community. The NFL, however, stood by its decision to hold the game in Arizona, citing the state's strong football tradition and the willingness of local authorities to ensure a safe and welcoming environment for all attendees.\n\n## Indigenous Representation\n\nIn recognition of the rich Native American heritage of the region, the NFL partnered with the Arizona State University's Native American Student Association to create a special pre-game program celebrating Native American culture. The program featured traditional music, dance, and art, as well as a powwow and a traditional Native American blessing.\n\n## Stadium Playing Surface\n\nState Farm Stadium features a natural grass playing surface, which was specifically designed to meet the NFL's stringent standards for football fields. The stadium's playing surface is made up of a combination of Kentucky bluegrass and perennial ryegrass, and is maintained by a team of experienced groundskeepers who ensure that it is in top condition for each event.\n\n# Teams\n\n## Kansas City Chiefs\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs, representing the AFC, were led by quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who was looking to capture his third Super Bowl title in as many years. The Chiefs, who finished the regular season with a 14-3 record, were seeking to become the first team in NFL history to win back-to-back Super Bowls.\n\n## Philadelphia Eagles\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles, representing the NFC, were led by quarterback Jalen Hurts, who was making his first Super Bowl appearance as a starter. The Eagles, who finished the regular season with a 14-3 record, were seeking to capture their second Super Bowl title in franchise history.\n\n## Playoffs\n\nBoth the Chiefs and the Eagles entered the playoffs as the number one seeds in their respective conferences. The Chiefs defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars in the Divisional Round, 27-20, while the Eagles defeated the New York Giants in the Divisional Round, 38-7.\n\n## Pre-game notes\n\nIn the days leading up to the game, there was a lot of attention focused on the matchup between Mahomes and Hurts, who were widely regarded as two of the top young quarterbacks in the NFL. The two quarterbacks were also friends and had a strong respect for one another, which made for a compelling storyline heading into the game.\n\n# Broadcasting\n\n## United States\n\n### Television\n\nThe game was broadcast on CBS, with Jim Nantz and Tony Romo providing play-by-play and color commentary. The pre-game and halftime shows were hosted by Tracy Wolfson and James Brown.\n\n### Advertising\n\nThe game featured a number of high-profile advertisers, including Pepsi, Bud Light, and Amazon. The commercials were widely praised for their creativity and humor, with many going viral on social media.\n\n### Ratings\n\nThe game drew a record 115.1 million viewers, making it the most-watched television program in U.S. history. The game also generated $600 million in ad revenue, making it the most lucrative Super Bowl advertising market in history.\n\n### Streaming\n\nThe game was streamed on CBS All Access, the NFL's digital streaming platform, which offered a live feed of the game as well as a number of pre-game and halftime shows.\n\n### Radio\n\nThe game was broadcast on radio by Westwood One, with Kevin Harlan and Trent Green providing play-by-play and color commentary.\n\n## International\n\nThe game was broadcast in over 200 countries and territories around the world, with a global audience of over 1 billion people. The game was broadcast in a number of languages, including Spanish, French, and Mandarin.\n\n# Entertainment\n\n## Pregame\n\nThe pre-game show featured a number of high-profile performers, including Rihanna, who sang the national anthem, and the Kansas City Chiefs' mascot, K.C. Wolf, who performed a number of dance routines.\n\n## Halftime\n\nThe halftime show was headlined by pop star Rihanna, who performed a number of her hit songs, including \"Work\" and \"Love on the Brain.\" The show was widely praised for its energy and creativity, with many considering it one of the best halftime shows in Super Bowl history.\n\n# Game summary\n\n## First half\n\nThe game got off to a slow start, with both teams struggling to move the ball on offense. The Chiefs finally got on the board with a field goal midway through the second quarter, but the Eagles responded with a touchdown of their own to take a 7-3 lead.

The inquiry was marked by controversy and partisan divisions, with the Democrats opposing the inquiry as a politically motivated attempt to undermine the President.\n\nBackground\n\nThe impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden was sparked by allegations of wrongdoing by the President's son, Hunter Biden, who was accused of engaging in corrupt business practices while his father was serving as Vice President under Barack Obama. The allegations centered on Hunter Biden's role in the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings, as well as his association with Chinese business figures.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the Biden family's business dealings gained momentum in 2020, when the New York Post published a series of articles alleging that Hunter Biden had introduced his father to a Burisma executive, and that the President had pressured the Ukrainian government to fire a prosecutor investigating the company. The allegations were fueled by revelations that Hunter Biden had been paid millions of dollars by Burisma, and that he had used his father's connections to secure business deals in Ukraine and China.\n\nInitiation of the inquiry\n\nOn February 10, 2023, the House of Representatives voted to initiate an impeachment inquiry into President Biden, with 226 Republicans voting in favor and 208 Democrats opposing the resolution. The resolution authorized the House Judiciary Committee to conduct an investigation into the allegations of wrongdoing by the President, and to determine whether impeachment proceedings should be brought against him.\n\nHouse committee investigations\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee began its investigation into the allegations against President Biden in March 2023, with a series of hearings and depositions featuring testimony from witnesses and experts. The committee heard testimony from Alexander Smirnov, a former Ukrainian prosecutor who had investigated Burisma Holdings, as well as from other witnesses who claimed to have information about the President's dealings with his son.\n\nWitness credibility\n\nThe credibility of the witnesses testifying before the House committee was a subject of controversy throughout the inquiry. Alexander Smirnov's testimony was called into question by Democrats, who pointed out that he had a history of anti-corruption activism in Ukraine and had made numerous allegations against the President's son.\n\nAlexander Smirnov\n\nSmirnov's testimony was notable for its claims that he had personally investigated Burisma Holdings and had found evidence of wrongdoing by the company. However, his credibility was questioned by Democrats, who pointed out that he had made similar allegations against the President's son in the past. The committee also raised questions about the reliability of Smirnov's testimony, given his history of activism and his potential biases.\n\nResponses\n\nThe impeachment inquiry into President Biden was met with a mixed reaction from the public and from politicians. Republicans generally supported the inquiry, arguing that it was necessary to investigate the President's alleged wrongdoing.\n\nRepublican reaction\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy praised the decision to initiate the impeachment inquiry, saying that it was a \"necessary step\" to hold the President accountable for his actions. Other Republicans, including Representatives Jim Jordan and Elise Stefanik, also expressed their support for the inquiry, arguing that it was a vital part of the legislative process.\n\nDemocratic reaction\n\nThe Democratic Party, on the other hand, opposed the impeachment inquiry from the outset. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the inquiry a \"politically motivated\" attempt to undermine the President, and argued that it was a distraction from more pressing issues facing the country. Other Democrats, including Representatives Adam Schiff and Jamie Raskin, also spoke out against the inquiry, saying that it was a \"waste of time\" and a \"diversion\" from more important work.\n\nReaction from academics\n\nAcademics and constitutional law experts also weighed in on the impeachment inquiry, with some arguing that it was a necessary step to hold the President accountable for his actions. Others argued that the inquiry was a thinly veiled attempt to undermine the President and score partisan points.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe impeachment inquiry into President Biden raised several questions about the President's actions and the constitutionality of the inquiry itself. The inquiry's focus on the President's alleged wrongdoing in Ukraine and China sparked debate about the limits of presidential power and the role of Congress in investigating the President.\n\nLegal standing\n\nThe legality of the impeachment inquiry was questioned by some constitutional law experts, who argued that the House of Representatives did not have the authority to investigate the President in this manner. Others argued that the inquiry was a legitimate exercise of Congress's oversight powers.\n\nOpinion polling\n\nOpinion polling on the impeachment inquiry was mixed, with some polls showing strong support for the inquiry and others showing significant opposition. A survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in March 2023 found that 51% of Americans believed that the President had committed impeachable offenses, while 44% did not. Another survey conducted by Gallup in April 2023 found that 56% of Americans supported the impeachment inquiry, while 41% opposed it.\n\nSupport for inquiry\n\nThe majority of Americans supported the impeachment inquiry, with many believing that it was necessary to hold the President accountable for his actions. However, a significant minority of Americans opposed the inquiry, arguing that it was a politically motivated attempt to undermine the President.\n\nSupport for impeachment\n\nPublic opinion on impeachment was more divided, with some polls showing strong support for impeachment and others showing significant opposition. A survey conducted by the Washington Post in May 2023 found that 54% of Americans believed that the President should be impeached and removed from office, while 43% did not.\n\nOutcome\n\nThe outcome of the impeachment inquiry into President Biden was ultimately inconclusive, with the House Judiciary Committee failing to produce a formal report recommending impeachment. The inquiry was widely seen as a partisan exercise, with Republicans seeking to undermine the President and Democrats defending him against what they saw as baseless allegations.\n\nNotes\n\nThe impeachment inquiry into President Biden was a complex and contentious process that highlighted the deep divisions in American politics. While the inquiry raised important questions about the President's actions and the limits of presidential power, it ultimately failed to produce a clear outcome. The inquiry's legacy remains a subject of debate, with some arguing that it was a necessary step to hold the President accountable and others seeing it as a partisan exercise aimed at undermining the President.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Impeachment_inquiry_into_Joe_Biden\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Initiation of the inquiry\n#House committee investigations\n#Witness credibility\n##Alexander Smirnov\n#Responses\n##Republican reaction\n##Democratic reaction\n##Reaction from academics\n#Analysis\n##Legal standing\n#Opinion polling\n##Support for inquiry\n##Support for impeachment\n#Outcome\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The outbreak was characterized by a prolonged period of severe weather, resulting in multiple tornadoes that caused significant damage and loss of life.\n\n**Meteorological Synopsis**\n\nThe meteorological conditions that led to the outbreak were complex and involved a combination of factors. The outbreak was influenced by a strong low-pressure system that developed over the southeastern United States, which interacted with a strong cold front and a warm front.\n\n### March 24–25\n\nOn March 24, a strong low-pressure system began to develop over the southeastern United States, with a warm front extending northward from the Gulf of Mexico. This system interacted with a strong cold front that moved southward from Canada, creating a region of instability and low-level moisture convergence. As the system continued to intensify, a line of severe thunderstorms developed, producing multiple tornadoes.\n\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) issued a series of tornado watches and warnings throughout the day, as the system continued to produce intense thunderstorms and tornadoes. The storms produced large hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes, with the most significant activity occurring in the afternoon and evening hours.\n\n### March 26–27\n\nOn March 26, the low-pressure system continued to intensify, with a secondary low-pressure system developing over the southern United States. This secondary system interacted with the original low-pressure system, creating a region of enhanced instability and low-level moisture convergence. As a result, a second line of severe thunderstorms developed, producing multiple tornadoes.\n\nThe NWS issued a series of tornado watches and warnings throughout the day, as the system continued to produce intense thunderstorms and tornadoes. The storms produced large hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes, with the most significant activity occurring in the afternoon and evening hours.\n\n**Confirmed Tornadoes**\n\nA total of 37 tornadoes were confirmed during the outbreak, with the majority occurring on March 26.

In April 2019, Löfven's government collapsed, and a caretaker government was formed to oversee the election.\n\n### Andersson's government\n\nMagdalena Andersson, the leader of the Social Democrats, became Prime Minister in October 2021 after winning a party leadership election. She formed a coalition government with the Green Party and the Centre Party, with the support of the Left Party.

The Moderate Party campaigned on a platform of reduced government spending and increased tax cuts.

The Sweden Democrats used the slogan \"Sweden's prosperity is in our hands\".\n\n### Debates\n\nThe campaign featured several televised debates, including a debate between the leaders of the two main blocs.

The results also showed a significant difference in voting patterns between men and women, with women tending to vote for the Social Democrats and the Green Party, and men tending to vote for the Moderate Party and the Sweden Democrats.\n\n### By constituency\n\nThe election results showed a significant difference in voting patterns between different constituencies, with the Social Democrats performing well in urban constituencies and the Moderate Party performing well in rural constituencies.\n\n### Seat distribution\n\nThe final seat distribution in the Riksdag was as follows: the Social Democrats 107, the Moderate Party 73, the Sweden Democrats 62, the Centre Party 31, the Green Party 18, the Left Party 24, the Christian Democrats 19, the Liberals 20, the New Democracy 0, the Alternative for Sweden 0, the Unity Party 0, the Pirate Party 0, the Feminist Initiative 6, the Communist Party of Sweden 0, the Climate Alliance 0, and the Unity Party 0.\n\n### Maps\n\nThe election results were mapped by constituency, with the Social Democrats performing well in urban constituencies and the Moderate Party performing well in rural constituencies.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n### Government formation\n\nFollowing the election, Magdalena Andersson formed a coalition government with the Green Party, the Centre Party, and the Left Party, with the support of the Feminist Initiative.

He has been a key figure in Sri Lankan politics for over three decades and has played a significant role in shaping the country's history.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nRanil Wickremesinghe was born on March 24, 1945, in Colombo, Sri Lanka, to a prominent family with a long history of involvement in politics. His father, Esmond Wickremesinghe, was a lawyer and a member of the Ceylon National Congress, a party that played a significant role in the country's struggle for independence. Ranil Wickremesinghe was educated at Royal College, Colombo, and later studied law at the University of Peradeniya. He began his career in politics in the early 1960s, joining the United National Party (UNP), a party that had a significant impact on Sri Lankan politics during the post-independence period.\n\n**Political career**\n\nRanil Wickremesinghe's entry into politics was facilitated by his family connections, and he quickly rose through the ranks of the UNP. He became a member of the party's working committee in the mid-1960s and was elected as a member of parliament in 1977. He held various ministerial portfolios, including trade, commerce, and industry, and served as the minister for foreign affairs from 1977 to 1989.\n\n### Batalanda incident\n\nIn 1990, Ranil Wickremesinghe was implicated in the Batalanda incident, a scandal involving the alleged torture of suspected LTTE members at a secret detention center called Batalanda in Maharagama. The incident led to widespread criticism and calls for Wickremesinghe's resignation. Although he denied any involvement in the incident, it had a significant impact on his reputation and led to a decline in his popularity within the UNP.\n\n### First premiership (1993–1994)\n\nRanil Wickremesinghe became the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka for the first time in 1993, following the resignation of President Dingiri Banda Wijetunga. His government focused on economic reforms and reducing the country's dependence on foreign aid. However, his tenure was short-lived, and he resigned in 1994 following a no-confidence motion brought against him by the opposition.\n\n### Opposition (1994–2001)\n\nAfter his resignation, Ranil Wickremesinghe became the leader of the opposition, a position he held until 2001. During this period, he focused on rebuilding the UNP and regaining its position as a major force in Sri Lankan politics. He also played a key role in the 1999 presidential election, where he supported the candidacy of Chandrika Kumaratunga, the leader of the People's Alliance.\n\n### 1999 presidential election\n\nThe 1999 presidential election was a significant event in Sri Lankan politics, with Chandrika Kumaratunga facing off against Mahinda Rajapaksa, the leader of the People's Liberation Front. Although Kumaratunga won the election, Wickremesinghe's role in her campaign was seen as crucial in her victory.\n\n### Second premiership (2001–2004)\n\nRanil Wickremesinghe became the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka for the second time in 2001, following the resignation of President Kumaratunga. His government focused on peace talks with the LTTE, which had been ongoing since the late 1990s. Although the talks were successful, they were ultimately unsuccessful in bringing about a lasting peace.\n\n### Peace talks\n\nWickremesinghe's government engaged in peace talks with the LTTE in 2002, which led to the signing of the Oslo Agreement. However, the talks were ultimately unsuccessful in bringing about a lasting peace, and the LTTE resumed its military campaign in 2004.\n\n### Opposition (2004–2015)\n\nAfter his resignation, Ranil Wickremesinghe became the leader of the opposition once again, a position he held until 2015. During this period, he focused on rebuilding the UNP and regaining its position as a major force in Sri Lankan politics. He also played a key role in the 2005 presidential election, where he supported the candidacy of Mahinda Rajapaksa.\n\n### 2005 presidential election\n\nThe 2005 presidential election was a significant event in Sri Lankan politics, with Mahinda Rajapaksa facing off against Srimani Ratwatte, the leader of the United People's Freedom Alliance. Although Rajapaksa won the election, Wickremesinghe's role in his campaign was seen as crucial in his victory.\n\n### Dissent within the UNP\n\nDuring his time as leader of the opposition, Wickremesinghe faced dissent within the UNP, with some members calling for him to step down. However, he managed to maintain his position as leader of the party.\n\n### End of the civil war and 2010 presidential election\n\nThe civil war in Sri Lanka came to an end in 2009, following the defeat of the LTTE by the Sri Lankan military. The end of the war marked a significant turning point in Sri Lankan politics, and Wickremesinghe's role in the country's peace process was widely praised.\n\n## Third, fourth and fifth premierships (2015–2019)\n\nRanil Wickremesinghe became the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka for the third time in 2015, following the resignation of President Maithripala Sirisena. His government focused on economic reforms and reducing the country's dependence on foreign aid. However, his tenure was marked by controversy, including the government bonds controversy.\n\n### Foreign policy\n\nWickremesinghe's government was marked by significant developments in foreign policy, including the strengthening of ties with India and China.\n\n### Government bonds controversy\n\nIn 2016, a controversy emerged over the issuance of government bonds, with some investors alleging that the government had engaged in a cover-up. The controversy led to widespread criticism and calls for Wickremesinghe's resignation.\n\n## Opposition (2019–2022)\n\nAfter his resignation, Ranil Wickremesinghe became the leader of the opposition once again, a position he held until 2022. During this period, he focused on rebuilding the UNP and regaining its position as a major force in Sri Lankan politics.\n\n## Sixth premiership (2022)\n\nRanil Wickremesinghe became the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka for the sixth time in 2022, following the resignation of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. His government focused on economic reforms and reducing the country's dependence on foreign aid.\n\n**Presidency (2022–2024)**\n\nRanil Wickremesinghe became the President of Sri Lanka in 2022, following the resignation of Gotabaya Rajapaksa. His presidency has been marked by significant developments, including the crackdown on anti-government protests.\n\n### Crackdown on anti-government protests\n\nIn 2022, Wickremesinghe's government faced widespread protests over economic issues, including fuel and food shortages. However, the government responded to the protests with force, leading to reports of human rights abuses.\n\n### Handling of economic crisis\n\nWickremesinghe's government has faced significant criticism over its handling of the economic crisis, including the increasing poverty and unemployment. However, he has maintained that his government is working to address the crisis.\n\n### 2023 local government elections\n\nThe 2023 local government elections were held in Sri Lanka, with Wickremesinghe's government facing widespread criticism over the elections. However, the government maintained that the elections were free and fair.\n\n### 2024 presidential election\n\nThe 2024 presidential election is set to be held in Sri Lanka, with Wickremesinghe's presidency likely to be a major issue in the election.\n\n**Family and personal life**\n\nRanil Wickremesinghe is married to Maithree Wickremesinghe and has three children.

Witnesses reported that Walker then exited his car and fled on foot.\n\nAccording to police reports, Walker was seen running through a nearby alleyway, with officers in hot pursuit. Witnesses described the scene as chaotic, with multiple police vehicles and officers surrounding Walker.\n\n**Investigation**\n\nThe Akron Police Department released a statement shortly after the incident, stating that officers had attempted to de-escalate the situation before resorting to deadly force.

The town is situated on the west coast of Maui, approximately 25 miles northwest of Ka'anapali and 45 miles northwest of Kihei. With a population of over 13,000 residents, Lahaina is a charming and historic town that offers a unique blend of traditional Hawaiian culture, stunning natural beauty, and modern amenities.\n\n# History\n\n## Name\n\n### Modern name, etymology, and pronunciations\n\nThe modern name \"Lahaina\" is derived from the Hawaiian words \"la\" (sun) and \"haina\" (leeward). The name refers to the town's location on the leeward side of the island, where the sun shines brightly throughout the year. The name \"Lahaina\" is often pronounced as \"luh-hah-nee-nuh\" by locals and visitors alike.\n\n### Ancient names\n\nLahaina has been home to various ancient Hawaiian settlements and chiefs. The town's earliest known name was \"Olowalu,\" which dates back to the 13th century. Other ancient names for the area include \"Kaulana\" and \"Kuau.\"\n\n## Early rulers\n\nLahaina was a significant chiefdom in ancient Hawaii, ruled by prominent ali'i (chiefs) such as the Pi'ilani dynasty. The Pi'ilani ali'i were known for their powerful naval fleets, which enabled them to control trade and commerce throughout the Hawaiian Islands.\n\n## Western contact\n\n### Kahekili II\n\nKahekili II was a powerful ali'i who ruled Lahaina from 1778 to 1794. He was a skilled warrior and naval commander who expanded Lahaina's influence through conquest and alliances. Kahekili II was also a patron of the arts and culture, and his court attracted many talented musicians, dancers, and craftsmen.\n\n### Kamehameha I and Kamehameha II\n\nKamehameha I, who unified Hawaii under one rule, conquered Lahaina in 1795.

The outbreak was part of a larger complex of severe weather that affected multiple states across the country.\n\n**Meteorological Synopsis**\n\nThe tornado outbreak was preceded by a complex interaction of atmospheric systems, including a strong low-pressure system, a cold front, and a warm front. These systems converged over the southern United States, creating a region of instability that fueled the development of thunderstorms.\n\n### March 21\n\nOn March 21, a strong low-pressure system began to take shape over the Gulf of Mexico. As the system moved northward, it interacted with a cold front that was stalled over the southern United States. This interaction created a region of strong lift, leading to the development of a line of strong thunderstorms over Texas and Louisiana.\n\nAs the storms moved eastward, they encountered a warm front that was pushing northward from the Gulf Coast. This led to the formation of a strong low-level jet stream, which fueled the development of tornadoes.\n\n### March 22\n\nOn March 22, the low-pressure system continued to move northward, bringing with it a strong cold front. This front interacted with the warm front, creating a region of strong instability that led to the development of a second line of strong thunderstorms over the southeastern United States.\n\nThe storms moved eastward, producing a series of tornadoes across Alabama, Georgia, and the Florida Panhandle. The tornadoes were part of a larger complex of severe weather that affected multiple states across the region.\n\n### March 23\n\nOn March 23, the low-pressure system continued to move eastward, bringing with it a strong cold front. This front interacted with the warm front, creating a region of strong instability that led to the development of a third line of strong thunderstorms over the eastern United States.\n\nThe storms produced a series of tornadoes across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern states, including New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. The tornadoes were part of a larger complex of severe weather that affected multiple states across the region.\n\n**Confirmed Tornadoes**\n\nA total of 24 tornadoes were confirmed across the United States during the outbreak. The tornadoes were part of a larger complex of severe weather that affected multiple states across the country.\n\n### March 21 Event\n\nOn March 21, a total of 10 tornadoes were confirmed across the southern United States.

Established in 1986, the award is given to individuals or teams who have demonstrated exceptional courage, skill, and determination in the pursuit of adventure and exploration.\n\n# History\n\nThe Piolets d'Or was founded by a group of French mountaineers and adventure enthusiasts who sought to recognize and celebrate the achievements of their peers. The first awards were given in 1986, and since then, the ceremony has become an annual event, attracting attention from around the world.\n\nThe award is named \"Piolets d'Or\" which translates to \"Golden Piolet\" in French, a reference to the alpine climbing tool. The name was chosen to reflect the spirit of adventure and exploration that defines the award.\n\n## Multiple winners\n\nOver the years, the Piolets d'Or has recognized a diverse range of achievements, from pioneering new routes on the world's highest mountains to completing epic adventures in remote and inhospitable regions. In some years, multiple winners have been recognized for their achievements, often in different categories.\n\nThe 1994 awards, for example, recognized five winners: Reinhold Messner and Hans Kammerlander for their ascent of the Nordwand of the Eiger; Simone Moro and Summits and Maxime Chabloz for their ascent of the Dhaulagiri; and the Japanese team of Hiroyoshi Endo and Hiromi Kozaki for their ascent of the Annapurna.\n\n## Criteria\n\nThe Piolets d'Or is awarded to individuals or teams who have demonstrated exceptional courage, skill, and determination in the pursuit of adventure and exploration. The award recognizes achievements in a range of categories, including:\n\n* Ascents: The Piolets d'Or recognizes outstanding achievements in climbing and mountaineering, including first ascents, new routes, and pioneering climbs.\n* Expeditions: The award recognizes epic adventures and expeditions that push the boundaries of human endurance and exploration.\n* Exploration: The Piolets d'Or recognizes achievements in exploration, including the discovery of new routes, features, and landmarks.\n\n# Reception\n\nThe Piolets d'Or has received widespread recognition and acclaim from the adventure community. Many of the winners have gone on to achieve even greater success, inspiring a new generation of adventurers and explorers.\n\nHowever, the award has also faced criticism and controversy over the years. Some have argued that the award is too focused on individual achievements, rather than recognizing the contributions of teams and communities.\n\n## Criticism\n\nOne of the criticisms of the Piolets d'Or is that it can create a culture of competition and one-upmanship among adventurers and explorers. Some have argued that the award perpetuates a system of individualism, where individuals are recognized for their achievements, rather than the contributions of teams and communities.\n\nAnother criticism of the Piolets d'Or is that it can be too focused on the individual achievements of wealthy and well-connected adventurers. Some have argued that the award does not adequately recognize the contributions of smaller, less well-funded expeditions and adventures.\n\n# 2023 award (31st awards)\n\nThe 2023 Piolets d'Or awards were given to a range of outstanding adventurers and explorers, including:\n\n* Alex Honnold and Tommy Caldwell for their ascent of the Dawn Wall of Yosemite's El Capitan\n* Nirmal Purja for his ascent of the Seven Summits\n* The Japanese team of Hiroyoshi Endo and Hiromi Kozaki for their ascent of the Annapurna\n\n# 2022 award (30th awards)\n\nThe 2022 Piolets d'Or awards were given to a range of outstanding adventurers and explorers, including:\n\n* Reinhold Messner and Hans Kammerlander for their ascent of the Nordwand of the Eiger\n* Simone Moro and Summits and Maxime Chabloz for their ascent of the Dhaulagiri\n* The British team of Tom Franks and Richard Hall for their ascent of the Freney Pillar on Mont Blanc\n\n# 2021 award\n\nThe 2021 Piolets d'Or award was given to the American climber, Alex Honnold, for his ascent of the Dawn Wall of Yosemite's El Capitan. Honnold's achievement was recognized as one of the most epic and daring climbs of the year.\n\n# 2020 award\n\nThe 2020 Piolets d'Or award was given to the Italian climber, Simone Moro, for his ascent of the Dhaulagiri. Moro's achievement was recognized as one of the most impressive and challenging climbs of the year.\n\n# 2019 award (deaths of Lama and Auer)\n\nThe 2019 Piolets d'Or award was a somber occasion, as two of the winners, Ueli Lama and Michael Auer, tragically lost their lives while attempting to climb the north face of the Eiger. The award was given to a range of other outstanding adventurers and explorers, including:\n\n* Nirmal Purja for his ascent of the Seven Summits\n* The Japanese team of Hiroyoshi Endo and Hiromi Kozaki for their ascent of the Annapurna\n\n# 2018 award (leaves France)\n\nThe 2018 Piolets d'Or award was given to the French climber, Bruno Levet, for his ascent of the Freney Pillar on Mont Blanc.

Levet's achievement was recognized as one of the most impressive and challenging climbs of the year.\n\n# 2013 award (everybody wins)\n\nThe 2013 Piolets d'Or award was given to every single applicant, with the ceremony being held as a celebration of the entire adventure community rather than a recognition of individual achievements.\n\n# 2012 award (20th awards)\n\nThe 2012 Piolets d'Or award was given to a range of outstanding adventurers and explorers, including:\n\n* Reinhold Messner and Hans Kammerlander for their ascent of the Nordwand of the Eiger\n* Simone Moro and Summits and Maxime Chabloz for their ascent of the Dhaulagiri\n* The Japanese team of Hiroyoshi Endo and Hiromi Kozaki for their ascent of the Annapurna\n\n# 2011 award\n\nThe 2011 Piolets d'Or award was given to the American climber, Alex Honnold, for his ascent of the Dawn Wall of Yosemite's El Capitan.

This article provides a comprehensive overview of the Banat of Craiova, its history, government, and cultural legacy.\n\n**History**\n\nThe establishment of the Banat of Craiova was a result of Austrian conquests in the region. In 1690, the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I invaded Wallachia, which was then a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire. The Austrians defeated the Wallachian prince, Constantin Brâncoveanu, and incorporated the region into the Habsburg Monarchy.\n\n#### Austrian Conquest\n\nThe Austrian conquest of Wallachia was a response to the Ottoman Empire's expansion into Eastern Europe. The Habsburgs had long been concerned about the Ottoman threat and sought to limit their expansion. The invasion of Wallachia was a key component of the larger Habsburg-Ottoman conflict, which would continue for centuries.\n\nThe Austrian army, led by General Johann Lorenz von Königsegg, entered Wallachia in 1690 and quickly defeated the Wallachian forces. The prince, Constantin Brâncoveanu, fled to the Ottoman Empire, and the region was annexed by the Habsburgs.\n\n#### Government Creation\n\nFollowing the conquest, the Habsburgs established a new government in the region. The Banat of Craiova was created as a separate administrative unit, with its capital in the city of Craiova. The ban, or governor, was appointed by the Habsburg emperor and was responsible for governing the region.\n\nThe government of the Banat of Craiova was modeled after the Austrian system, with a combination of local and imperial authorities. The ban was advised by a council of local nobles and officials, and was responsible for collecting taxes, maintaining law and order, and overseeing the administration of justice.\n\n#### Boyar and Peasant Resistance\n\nThe establishment of the Banat of Craiova was met with resistance from the local boyar class, who had long been the dominant social group in Wallachia. The boyars, who were largely orthodox Christians, saw the Austrian conquest as a threat to their power and way of life.\n\nThe peasants, who were largely serfs, also resisted the Austrian rule. They saw the Austrians as foreign oppressors who were imposing a new system of government and taxation. The peasants participated in several uprisings against the Austrians, but were ultimately unsuccessful in their efforts to overthrow them.\n\n#### Austrian Consolidation\n\nDespite the resistance, the Habsburgs were able to consolidate their control over the Banat of Craiova. They established a network of officials and administrators, and imposed a new system of taxation and law. The Austrians also encouraged the development of trade and commerce in the region, and established new roads and infrastructure.\n\nThe Banat of Craiova became an important center of trade and commerce in the region, with Craiova emerging as a major commercial center. The city became a hub for the export of agricultural products, such as wheat and livestock, and the import of manufactured goods.\n\n#### Ottoman Reconquest\n\nIn 1718, the Ottoman Empire, which had been weakened by internal conflicts and external pressures, launched a counterattack against the Habsburgs. The Ottomans, led by the Grand Vizier, Ahmed Pasha, invaded the Banat of Craiova and quickly defeated the Austrian forces.\n\nThe Ottomans reestablished their control over Wallachia, and the Banat of Craiova was abolished. The region was once again incorporated into the Ottoman Empire, and the Habsburgs withdrew their forces.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nThe Banat of Craiova had a lasting impact on the history and culture of the region. The Austrian conquest and rule had a profound effect on the local population, who were exposed to a new system of government, law, and culture.\n\n#### \"Colonial\" Precedent\n\nThe Banat of Craiova was an early example of a \"colonial\" exercise, where a European power imposed its rule over a foreign territory. This precedent would be repeated in other parts of Eastern Europe, as European powers such as the Habsburgs, the Russians, and the French expanded their empires.\n\nThe Banat of Craiova also set a precedent for the use of military force to expand and maintain control over foreign territories. This approach would be employed by other European powers, with often devastating consequences for the local populations.\n\n#### Cultural Survivals\n\nDespite the Ottoman reconquest, the cultural legacy of the Banat of Craiova survived. The region continued to be a center of trade and commerce, and the city of Craiova remained an important commercial center.\n\nThe cultural exchange between the Austrians and the Wallachians also had a lasting impact on the region. The Austrians introduced new architectural styles, such as the Baroque, which were adopted by the Wallachians. The region also became a center of learning and culture, with the establishment of schools, libraries, and cultural institutions.\n\n**Symbols**\n\nThe Banat of Craiova had several symbols that reflected its history and culture. The region's coat of arms, which featured a combination of Austrian and Wallachian symbols, was a representation of the multiple influences that shaped the region.\n\nThe city of Craiova also had its own symbol, the Craiova Coat of Arms, which featured a combination of symbols that reflected the city's history and culture.\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe Banat of Craiova was a significant event in the history of Eastern Europe, marking the beginning of a new era of European expansion and cultural exchange. The region's legacy continues to be felt today, with the city of Craiova remaining an important cultural and commercial center in Romania.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Banat_of_Craiova\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Austrian conquest\n##Government creation\n##Boyar and peasant resistance\n##Austrian consolidation\n##Ottoman reconquest\n#Legacy\n##\"Colonial\" precedent\n##Cultural survivals\n#Symbols\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The election was the 15th general election since the country's independence in 1957 and the second under the country's current electoral system.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe 2022 general election was a significant event in Malaysian politics, as it marked a transfer of power from the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, which had ruled the country since independence, to the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition. The election was also notable for being the first general election to be held under a new electoral system, which introduced the concept of a \"first-past-the-post\" system, where voters could choose to vote for a candidate or a party.\n\n**Background**\n\n### **Previous Election**\n\nThe previous general election was held on 9 May 2018, in which the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition, led by Mahathir Mohamad, defeated the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, led by Najib Razak. The PH coalition won 113 seats in the Dewan Rakyat, while the BN coalition won 79 seats.\n\n### **Significant Events**\n\nSeveral significant events occurred between the previous general election and the 2022 general election. These included the formation of the Pakatan Harapan (PH) government, which was led by Mahathir Mohamad, and the subsequent resignation of Mahathir as Prime Minister in February 2020. The PH government was then led by Muhyiddin Yassin, who dissolved parliament in January 2020 and called for a snap election.\n\n### **2020–22 Political Crisis**\n\nThe country experienced a prolonged political crisis between 2020 and 2022, which saw several changes in government. In February 2020, Mahathir Mohamad resigned as Prime Minister, and Muhyiddin Yassin was sworn in as the new Prime Minister. However, Muhyiddin's government was short-lived, and he dissolved parliament in January 2021, calling for a snap election. The election was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the country experienced a prolonged period of political instability.\n\n**Electoral System**\n\nThe 2022 general election was held under a new electoral system, which introduced the concept of a \"first-past-the-post\" system. Under this system, voters could choose to vote for a candidate or a party, and the candidate or party with the most votes in a constituency would win the seat. The electoral system also introduced the concept of a \"safe seat,\" where a candidate or party was guaranteed to win the seat if they received a certain percentage of votes.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n### **Dissolution of Parliament**\n\nParliament was dissolved on 10 October 2022, and the election was scheduled to be held on 19 November 2022.\n\n### **Dissolution of State Legislatures**\n\nThe state legislatures of the states of Malaya and Sabah were dissolved on 10 October 2022, and the election was scheduled to be held on 19 November 2022.\n\n### **Pre-Nomination Events**\n\nThe pre-nomination events for the election began on 10 October 2022, and candidates were required to submit their nomination papers by 28 October 2022.\n\n### **Timetable**\n\nThe election timetable was as follows:\n\n* 10 October 2022: Parliament and state legislatures dissolved\n* 10 October 2022: Pre-nomination events begin\n* 28 October 2022: Candidates submit nomination papers\n* 19 November 2022: Election day\n\n**Last Election Pendulum**\n\nThe last election pendulum, which was used to predict the outcome of the election, showed that the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition was likely to win the election. The pendulum showed that PH had a strong advantage in the northern regions of the country, where the Malay majority population resides.\n\n**Political Parties and Candidates**\n\n### **Parties
