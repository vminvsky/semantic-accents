The season officially began on June 1, 2023, and ended on November 30, 2023.\n\n**Seasonal Forecasts**\n\n### Pre-season Forecasts\n\nIn the months leading up to the start of the season, various meteorological organizations and experts provided forecasts for the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season. These forecasts typically include predictions for the number of named storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes that will occur during the season.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued its pre-season forecast on May 25, 2023, predicting a near-normal season with 14 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes. The NOAA's forecast also noted that the Atlantic basin was experiencing above-average sea surface temperatures, which could contribute to an active season.\n\nThe Colorado State University (CSU) issued its pre-season forecast on April 6, 2023, predicting a slightly above-normal season with 16 named storms, 8 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes. The CSU's forecast also noted that the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was in a neutral phase, which could lead to an increase in hurricane activity.\n\nOther organizations, such as the UK Met Office and the National Hurricane Center (NHC), also issued pre-season forecasts, but these were generally less optimistic than those of the NOAA and CSU.\n\n### Mid-season Forecasts\n\nAs the season progressed, the forecasts were updated to reflect the actual activity. The NOAA issued its mid-season forecast on August 9, 2023, predicting 16 named storms, 9 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes. The CSU updated its forecast on August 23, 2023, predicting 18 named storms, 10 hurricanes, and 5 major hurricanes.\n\nThe NHC also issued updates to its forecast, predicting 17 named storms, 9 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes.\n\n**Seasonal Summary**\n\n### Background\n\nThe 2023 Atlantic hurricane season was influenced by various climate factors, including the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).

The earthquake had a magnitude of 6.9 on the moment magnitude scale and a depth of approximately 20 kilometers. It was a significant seismic event that caused widespread damage and loss of life in the region.\n\n**#Tectonic setting**\n\nThe Al Haouz Province is located in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco, a region prone to seismic activity. The Atlas Mountains are part of the African-Eurasian plate boundary, where the Eurasian plate is being pushed beneath the African plate. This process is known as subduction, and it can cause significant earthquakes in the region.\n\nThe Al Haouz Province is also home to several major faults, including the Al Haouz fault and the Atlas fault. These faults are thought to be responsible for many of the earthquakes that occur in the region. The tectonic setting of the Al Haouz Province is characterized by a combination of compressional and extensional forces, which can lead to the formation of earthquakes.\n\n**#Earthquake**\n\nThe 2023 Al Haouz earthquake occurred at 14:45 UTC on August 9, 2023. The epicenter of the earthquake was located in the Al Haouz Province, approximately 50 kilometers west of the city of Marrakech. The earthquake had a magnitude of 6.9 on the moment magnitude scale and a depth of approximately 20 kilometers.\n\n##**Mechanism**\n\nThe mechanism of the 2023 Al Haouz earthquake is thought to have been a combination of thrust faulting and strike-slip faulting. The earthquake occurred along a fault plane that dips at an angle of approximately 30 degrees. This type of faulting is common in regions where the tectonic forces are compressional.\n\n##**Ground effects**\n\nThe ground effects of the 2023 Al Haouz earthquake were significant. The earthquake caused the ground to shake for several seconds, with the shaking becoming more intense in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake. The earthquake also caused the ground to liquefy in some areas, which led to the formation of landslides and soil liquefaction.\n\n**#Damage and casualties**\n\nThe 2023 Al Haouz earthquake caused significant damage and loss of life in the Al Haouz Province. The earthquake destroyed several buildings, including homes, schools, and hospitals. The earthquake also damaged several major roads and highways, which made it difficult for emergency responders to access the affected areas.\n\nThe death toll from the earthquake was estimated to be in the hundreds, with many more people injured. The earthquake also left thousands of people homeless, with many more displaced from their homes.\n\n**#Search and rescue**\n\nThe search and rescue efforts following the 2023 Al Haouz earthquake were extensive. Emergency responders from the Moroccan government, as well as international aid teams, were deployed to the affected areas to search for survivors and provide aid.\n\nThe search and rescue efforts were hampered by the remote location of the affected areas and the damage to the infrastructure. However, the efforts of the emergency responders were successful in locating many survivors and providing them with medical aid.\n\n**#International response**\n\nThe international response to the 2023 Al Haouz earthquake was significant. The Moroccan government received aid and support from many countries, including the United States, the European Union, and the Arab League.\n\nThe international community provided financial aid, medical supplies, and disaster relief teams to support the efforts of the Moroccan government. The international response was coordinated through the United Nations, which played a key role in facilitating the aid efforts.\n\n**#Recovery and assistance**\n\nThe recovery and assistance efforts following the 2023 Al Haouz earthquake were extensive. The Moroccan government, as well as international aid teams, worked to provide aid and support to the affected communities.\n\nThe recovery efforts included the provision of food, shelter, and medical aid to those in need. The efforts also included the repair of damaged infrastructure, including roads, schools, and hospitals.\n\nThe recovery efforts were long-term, with many communities still recovering from the effects of the earthquake years after it occurred.\n\n**#Aid and crisis management**\n\nThe aid and crisis management efforts following the 2023 Al Haouz earthquake were extensive. The Moroccan government, as well as international aid teams, worked to provide aid and support to the affected communities.\n\nThe aid efforts included the provision of financial aid, medical supplies, and disaster relief teams. The efforts also included the coordination of emergency response teams, including search and rescue teams, medical teams, and logistics teams.\n\nThe crisis management efforts were coordinated through the United Nations, which played a key role in facilitating the aid efforts. The crisis management efforts also included the establishment of a coordination center to manage the aid efforts and coordinate the response.\n\n##**International aid**\n\nThe international aid efforts following the 2023 Al Haouz earthquake were significant. The Moroccan government received aid and support from many countries, including the United States, the European Union, and the Arab League.\n\nThe international community provided financial aid, medical supplies, and disaster relief teams to support the efforts of the Moroccan government. The international aid efforts were coordinated through the United Nations, which played a key role in facilitating the aid efforts.\n\n##**Crisis management**\n\nThe crisis management efforts following the 2023 Al Haouz earthquake were extensive. The Moroccan government, as well as international aid teams, worked to provide aid and support to the affected communities.\n\nThe crisis management efforts included the coordination of emergency response teams, including search and rescue teams, medical teams, and logistics teams. The efforts also included the establishment of a coordination center to manage the aid efforts and coordinate the response.\n\n##**Protests**\n\nThe 2023 Al Haouz earthquake led to widespread protests in Morocco. The protests were sparked by the slow response of the government to the disaster and the lack of aid to the affected communities.\n\nThe protests were peaceful, but they were significant in number, with thousands of people taking to the streets to demand action from the government. The protests were eventually successful in prompting the government to increase its aid efforts and provide more support to the affected communities.\n\n##**Reconstruction**\n\nThe reconstruction efforts following the 2023 Al Haouz earthquake were extensive. The Moroccan government, as well as international aid teams, worked to repair and rebuild damaged infrastructure, including roads, schools, and hospitals.\n\nThe reconstruction efforts were long-term, with many communities still recovering from the effects of the earthquake years after it occurred. The efforts included the provision of new housing for those who had lost their homes and the establishment of new businesses and services in the affected areas.\n\n**#See also**\n\n* List of earthquakes in Morocco\n* Al Haouz Province\n* Atlas Mountains\n* Tectonic setting of North Africa\n\n**#References**\n\nNote: This article does not include any citations or references.\n\n**#External links**\n\n* United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR). \"2023 Al Haouz Earthquake\" (in English)\n* Moroccan Government. \"2023 Al Haouz Earthquake\" (in Arabic)\n* European Union. \"2023 Al Haouz Earthquake\" (in English)\n* Arab League. \"2023 Al Haouz Earthquake\" (in Arabic)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Al_Haouz_earthquake\" following this outline:\n\n#Tectonic setting\n#Earthquake\n##Mechanism\n##Ground effects\n#Damage and casualties\n#Search and rescue\n#International response\n#Recovery and assistance\n#Aid and crisis management\n##International aid\n##Crisis management\n##Protests\n##Reconstruction\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It was one of the most important and enduring empires in Southeast Asian history, playing a significant role in shaping the region's politics, culture, and economy. This article provides an overview of the kingdom's history, government, culture, and economy, as well as its impact on the region and the world.\n\n**History**\n\n### Origins\n\nThe origins of the Ayutthaya Kingdom are shrouded in myth and legend. According to traditional accounts, the kingdom was founded by King Ramathibodi I (also known as Uthong), a descendant of the Khmer dynasty, in 1350. However, archaeological evidence suggests that the site of modern-day Ayutthaya was inhabited as early as the 12th century, and that the kingdom may have been established by a group of Mon people from the kingdom of Dvaravati.\n\n#### Pre-Ayutthaya cities\n\nPrior to the establishment of Ayutthaya, the region was home to several smaller kingdoms and cities, including the kingdom of Dvaravati, the kingdom of Sukhothai, and the city of Lopburi. These cities were often subject to the influence of the Khmer Empire, which dominated the region from the 9th to the 13th centuries.\n\n#### The traditional founding of Ayutthaya\n\nAccording to legend, King Ramathibodi I founded Ayutthaya in 1350, after being driven out of Sukhothai by the king of Sukhothai. The king is said to have chosen the site of modern-day Ayutthaya because of its strategic location, with access to the Chao Phraya River and the surrounding countryside.\n\n### Early maritime dominance\n\nDuring the 14th and 15th centuries, the Ayutthaya Kingdom established itself as a major maritime power in Southeast Asia. The kingdom's rulers encouraged trade with China, India, and other Southeast Asian kingdoms, and Ayutthaya became a major center for the production and trade of goods such as spices, textiles, and precious metals.\n\n### Age of warfare\n\nFrom the 16th to the 18th centuries, the Ayutthaya Kingdom was involved in a series of wars with its neighbors, including the Burmese, the Khmer, and the Vietnamese. These wars had a significant impact on the kingdom's development, leading to the centralization of power and the rise of the northern lords.\n\n#### Transition to a hinterland state\n\nDuring the 16th century, the Ayutthaya Kingdom began to transition from a maritime empire to a hinterland state, with a focus on agriculture and the management of the kingdom's vast territories. This transition was driven by the kingdom's increasing involvement in wars with its neighbors, which had depleted its resources and led to a decline in maritime trade.\n\n#### Centralization and dominance of the Northern lords\n\nDuring the 17th century, the Ayutthaya Kingdom underwent a significant period of centralization, with the rise of the northern lords to power. These lords, who were descended from the kingdom's original founders, dominated the kingdom's politics and economy, and played a key role in its military campaigns.\n\n#### First Burmese wars\n\nThe Ayutthaya Kingdom's first war with Burma took place in 1605, and lasted for several decades. The war was sparked by a series of border disputes between the two kingdoms, and was marked by a series of brutal and devastating battles.\n\n### Peace and commerce\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, the Ayutthaya Kingdom experienced a period of relative peace and prosperity, marked by increased trade and commerce with China, India, and other Southeast Asian kingdoms.

The war has its roots in the complex history and geopolitics of the region, and has involved multiple phases, including the annexation of Crimea, the war in the Donbas, and the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Independent Ukraine and the Orange Revolution\n\nUkraine gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, and in 2004, the country experienced a significant turning point with the Orange Revolution. The revolution was a peaceful protest movement that brought about a change in government, with Viktor Yushchenko becoming the new president. However, the revolution also marked a period of increased tensions between Ukraine and Russia, as Yushchenko's government sought to distance itself from Russian influence and integrate Ukraine into the European Union.\n\n### Euromaidan, Revolution of Dignity, and pro-Russian unrest\n\nIn 2013, a wave of protests, known as the Euromaidan movement, began in Ukraine, with demonstrators calling for closer ties with the European Union and demanding the resignation of President Viktor Yanukovych. The protests eventually led to Yanukovych's ousting, and a new government was formed. However, this also led to an increase in pro-Russian sentiment in Ukraine, particularly in the eastern regions, which were economically and culturally closely tied to Russia.\n\n### Russian military bases in Crimea\n\nRussia had maintained a significant military presence in Crimea, a peninsula on the northern coast of the Black Sea, since the Soviet era. In the 1990s, Ukraine had leased the Crimean naval base to Russia, which was seen as a strategic outpost for Russia's Black Sea Fleet.\n\n### Legality and declaration of war\n\nThe legality of the war is disputed, with Ukraine and its Western allies viewing Russia's actions as an invasion and annexation, while Russia claims that it is defending the rights of ethnic Russians in Ukraine. In 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, which was followed by the outbreak of conflict in the Donbas region.\n\n**History**\n\n### Russian annexation of Crimea (2014)\n\nOn February 27, 2014, Russian troops entered Crimea, and a referendum was held on March 16, in which a majority of Crimeans voted to join Russia. The annexation was widely condemned by the international community, with the United States and European Union imposing economic sanctions on Russia.\n\n### War in the Donbas (2014–2015)\n\nThe conflict in the Donbas region began in April 2014, with pro-Russian separatists declaring independence in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The conflict escalated into a full-blown war, with Russia providing military support to the separatists. In 2015, a ceasefire was agreed upon, but fighting continued, and in 2018, a gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine led to an escalation of the conflict.\n\n### Pro-Russia unrest\n\nIn 2014, pro-Russian unrest spread throughout Ukraine, with clashes between Ukrainian security forces and pro-Russian protesters. The unrest was particularly widespread in the eastern regions, where there were significant ethnic Russian populations.\n\n### Armed conflict\n\nThe armed conflict in the Donbas region began in April 2014, with pro-Russian separatists declaring independence in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The conflict escalated into a full-blown war, with Russia providing military support to the separatists.\n\n### August 2014 Russian invasion\n\nIn August 2014, Russia launched a major military invasion of Ukraine, with troops and equipment entering the country from multiple directions. The invasion was widely condemned by the international community, and led to a significant escalation of the conflict.\n\n### Mariupol offensive and first Minsk ceasefire\n\nIn June 2014, Ukrainian forces launched an offensive against pro-Russian separatists in the city of Mariupol, which led to a significant shift in the balance of power in the conflict. In September 2014, a ceasefire was agreed upon, known as the Minsk I agreement, which brought an end to the fighting, but did not address the underlying issues.\n\n### End of 2014 and Minsk II agreement\n\nIn December 2014, the Minsk II agreement was signed, which aimed to bring a lasting end to the conflict. The agreement included provisions for a ceasefire, withdrawal of heavy artillery, and the establishment of a buffer zone. However, the agreement was not fully implemented, and the conflict continued.\n\n**Line of conflict stabilizes (2015–2022)**\n\nFrom 2015 to 2022, the line of conflict stabilized, with periodic outbreaks of violence, but no major changes in the overall dynamics of the conflict. In 2018, a gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine led to an escalation of the conflict, with Russia cutting off gas supplies to Ukraine and European countries.\n\n### 2018 Kerch Strait incident\n\nIn November 2018, a confrontation between Russian and Ukrainian naval vessels in the Kerch Strait led to a significant escalation of the conflict. The incident marked a turning point in the conflict, with Russia increasing its military presence in the region and Ukraine imposing martial law.\n\n### 2019–2020\n\nIn 2019, the conflict continued, with periodic outbreaks of violence. In 2020, a significant escalation of the conflict occurred, with Russia launching a massive artillery bombardment of Ukrainian positions in the Donbas region.\n\n**Full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine (2022)**\n\n### Prelude\n\nIn January 2022, Russia began to build up its military presence along the Ukraine border, with thousands of troops and equipment entering the region. The build-up was widely seen as a prelude to a full-scale invasion.\n\n### Escalation\n\nOn February 24, 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with troops and equipment entering the country from multiple directions. The invasion was widely condemned by the international community, and led to a significant escalation of the conflict.\n\n### Full-scale invasion\n\nThe full-scale invasion of Ukraine marked a major turning point in the conflict, with Russia launching a massive military campaign against the country. The invasion led to a significant increase in violence, with thousands of civilians killed or injured.\n\n**Ukrainian counteroffensives and stalemate (2022–2023)**\n\nIn response to the full-scale invasion, Ukraine launched a series of counteroffensives, including a major push in the Kharkiv region. The counteroffensives were successful, but the conflict remained in a stalemate, with both sides suffering heavy losses.\n\n### Russian campaigns and Ukrainian Kursk offensive (1 December 2023 – present)\n\nIn recent months, Russia has launched a series of campaigns in Ukraine, including a major push in the Kherson region. Ukraine has responded with a series of counteroffensives, including the Kursk offensive, which has made significant gains.\n\n**Human rights violations**\n\nThe conflict has led to significant human rights violations, with both sides committing abuses against civilians and prisoners of war. The conflict has also led to a significant refugee crisis, with millions of people displaced from their homes.\n\n**Related issues**\n\n### Spillover\n\nThe conflict has led to a significant spillover effect, with violence and instability spreading to neighboring countries. The conflict has also led to a significant increase in organized crime and terrorism in the region.\n\n### Gas disputes and Nord Stream sabotage\n\nThe conflict has led to a significant gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine, with Russia cutting off gas supplies to Ukraine and European countries. In 2022, a sabotage attack on the Nord Stream pipeline led to a significant escalation of the conflict.\n\n### Hybrid warfare\n\nThe conflict has been characterized by a significant use of hybrid warfare tactics, including disinformation, propaganda, and cyber attacks.\n\n### Russian propaganda and disinformation campaigns\n\nRussia has launched a significant propaganda and disinformation campaign against Ukraine and its Western allies, using social media and other channels to spread false information.\n\n### Role of the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church has played a significant role in the conflict, with many Ukrainian Orthodox leaders opposing the Russian invasion and supporting Ukrainian independence.\n\n### Russia–NATO relations\n\nThe conflict has led to a significant deterioration in Russia–NATO relations, with the alliance imposing economic sanctions on Russia and increasing its military presence in Eastern Europe.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### Reactions to the Russian annexation of Crimea\n\nThe Russian annexation of Crimea was widely condemned by the international community, with the United States and European Union imposing economic sanctions on Russia.\n\n### Ukrainian response\n\nThe Ukrainian government responded to the annexation by imposing martial law and mobilizing its military.

In the context of string theory, a fuzzball is a highly energetic, compact, and dense entity that arises from the collapse of a black hole. This article will delve into the physical properties of fuzzballs, their relation to string theory and composition, densities, and their connection to the collapse of neutron stars. We will also explore the information paradox and the testability of the theory.\n\nPhysical properties\n\nString theory and composition\n\nString theory proposes that the fundamental building blocks of the universe are one-dimensional strings rather than point-like particles. These strings can vibrate at different frequencies, giving rise to the various particles we observe in the universe. A fuzzball is thought to be a highly energetic and compact entity that arises from the collapse of a black hole. It is composed of a collection of strings that are so densely packed that they form a single, highly energetic point.\n\nThe composition of a fuzzball is still a topic of debate among string theorists. Some propose that a fuzzball is a collection of strings that are all vibrating at the same frequency, while others suggest that it is a collection of strings that are vibrating at different frequencies. The composition of a fuzzball is closely tied to the nature of string theory itself, and a deeper understanding of fuzzballs may shed light on the fundamental principles of the theory.\n\nDensities\n\nA fuzzball is thought to be an extremely dense entity, with densities that are many orders of magnitude greater than those of a neutron star. The density of a fuzzball is so high that it would be compressed to a point, making it difficult to distinguish from a black hole. However, unlike a black hole, a fuzzball is thought to be a purely quantum mechanical object, and its density is determined by the laws of quantum mechanics rather than general relativity.\n\nThe density of a fuzzball is also closely tied to its energy. As the energy of a fuzzball increases, its density also increases. This is because the strings that make up a fuzzball are highly energetic and are packed more tightly together as the energy increases. The relationship between the density and energy of a fuzzball is a key area of research in string theory, and a deeper understanding of this relationship may shed light on the fundamental principles of the theory.\n\nNeutron star collapse\n\nThe collapse of a neutron star is thought to be a key process in the formation of a fuzzball. When a neutron star collapses, the density of the star increases to the point where the laws of quantum mechanics become important. At this point, the star begins to break down into its constituent strings, which then form a fuzzball.\n\nThe collapse of a neutron star is a complex process that involves the merger of two or more neutron stars. As the stars collide, their density increases, and the laws of quantum mechanics become more important. The resulting fuzzball is thought to be a highly energetic and compact entity that is composed of a collection of strings.\n\nThe collapse of a neutron star is also closely tied to the information paradox. The information paradox arises because the laws of quantum mechanics suggest that the information contained in a black hole is lost when it evaporates, while the laws of general relativity suggest that the information is preserved. The collapse of a neutron star is thought to be a key process in resolving this paradox, and a deeper understanding of this process may shed light on the fundamental principles of the theory.\n\nInformation paradox\n\nThe information paradox arises because the laws of quantum mechanics suggest that the information contained in a black hole is lost when it evaporates, while the laws of general relativity suggest that the information is preserved. This paradox is a key area of research in string theory, and a deeper understanding of it may shed light on the fundamental principles of the theory.\n\nThe collapse of a neutron star is thought to be a key process in resolving the information paradox. When a neutron star collapses, the information contained in the star is preserved in the form of a fuzzball. This fuzzball is thought to be a highly energetic and compact entity that is composed of a collection of strings.\n\nThe information paradox is closely tied to the concept of black hole complementarity, which proposes that the information contained in a black hole is both lost and preserved, depending on the observer's frame of reference. This paradox is a key area of research in string theory, and a deeper understanding of it may shed light on the fundamental principles of the theory.\n\nTestability of the theory\n\nThe testability of the theory is a key area of research in string theory. The theory is still in its early stages of development, and many of its predictions are still untested. However, the theory has made several predictions that are testable, including the existence of fuzzballs and the collapse of neutron stars.\n\nThe testability of the theory is closely tied to the development of new experimental techniques and technologies. For example, the development of new detectors and telescopes may allow for the detection of fuzzballs and the study of their properties. The testability of the theory is also closely tied to the development of new theoretical frameworks and models, which may allow for a deeper understanding of the theory and its predictions.\n\nThe testability of the theory is also closely tied to the concept of falsifiability, which proposes that a theory must be testable and falsifiable in order to be considered scientific. The theory of string theory is still in the process of being developed, and many of its predictions are still untested. However, the theory has made several predictions that are testable, and a deeper understanding of the theory and its predictions may shed light on the fundamental principles of the universe.\n\nReferences\n\nThis article does not include any citations or references.

The election was the 18th general election in Fiji since the country gained independence from British colonial rule in 1970.\n\n**Background**\n\nFiji has a parliamentary democracy with a constitutional monarch, the President of Fiji, serving as the head of state. The government is headed by the Prime Minister of Fiji, who is the head of government. The Parliament of Fiji is unicameral, comprising 51 members elected by popular vote for a four-year term.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nThe electoral system in Fiji is based on a mixed-member proportional representation system. Voters cast two votes: one for a candidate in their constituency and one for a party list. The candidate who wins the most votes in a constituency is elected as a member of parliament for that constituency. The remaining members are elected from the party lists, with seats allocated proportionally to the number of votes received by each party.\n\n**Voters**\n\nTo be eligible to vote in the election, a person must be a Fijian citizen, at least 18 years old, and registered on the electoral roll. The electoral roll is maintained by the Supervisor of Elections, who is responsible for ensuring that the roll is accurate and up-to-date.\n\n**Electoral changes**\n\nThe 2022 election saw significant changes to the electoral system. The number of constituencies was increased from 46 to 51, and the electoral boundaries were revised to reflect changes in population growth and settlement patterns.\n\n**Schedule**\n\nThe election schedule was as follows:\n\n* December 1, 2022: Nomination day for candidates\n* December 14, 2022: Election day\n* December 15, 2022: Counting of votes and declaration of results\n\n**Parties**\n\nSeven parties contested the election:\n\n* **FijiFirst Party** (FNP): led by Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka, FijiFirst is a conservative party that has been in power since 2014.\n* **Sodelpa Party** (SODELPA): led by Sitiveni Rabuka in 2022, but restored to the leadership position in 2024, SODELPA is a social democratic party that was founded in 2013.\n* **People's Alliance Party** (PAP): led by Pio Tikoduadua, PAP is a center-left party that was founded in 2021.\n* **National Federation Party** (NFP): led by Biman Prasad, NFP is a center-right party that was founded in 1952.\n* **Fiji Labour Party** (FLP): led by Mahendra Chaudhry, FLP is a social democratic party that was founded in 1985.\n* **All People's Party** (APP): led by Taito Tikoyace, APP is a center-right party that was founded in 2018.\n\n**Campaign**\n\nThe campaign for the 2022 election was marked by controversy and polarization.

The party also promised to strengthen the country's infrastructure and improve living standards.\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nOpinion polls conducted in the lead-up to the election suggested that FijiFirst would retain power, but that SODELPA and PAP were gaining ground. A poll conducted by a local newspaper in November 2022 found that 44% of respondents intended to vote for FijiFirst, while 28% intended to vote for SODELPA and 21% for PAP.\n\n**Preferred prime minister**\n\nA poll conducted by a local newspaper in November 2022 found that 51% of respondents preferred Sitiveni Rabuka as prime minister, while 24% preferred Pio Tikoduadua and 15% preferred Biman Prasad.\n\n**Voting intention**\n\nA poll conducted by a local newspaper in November 2022 found that 46% of respondents intended to vote for FijiFirst, while 31% intended to vote for SODELPA and 23% for PAP.\n\n**Forecast**\n\nBased on the opinion polls and voting intention, it was forecast that FijiFirst would retain power, but that SODELPA and PAP would gain significant ground.\n\n**Debates**\n\nThe election campaign was marked by several debates between the party leaders, including a televised debate hosted by a local television station in December 2022.

Taito Tikoyace (All People's Party)\n\n**Government formation**\n\nAfter the election, FijiFirst formed a coalition government with SODELPA and PAP, with Sitiveni Rabuka as Prime Minister.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe 2022 election was widely seen as a significant turning point in Fijian politics, with SODELPA and PAP gaining significant ground and challenging the dominance of FijiFirst. The election also marked a shift towards greater polarization and partisanship in Fijian politics.\n\n**Election night controversy**\n\nThe election night was marked by controversy, with reports of irregularities and intimidation in some areas. The Supervisor of Elections was criticized for failing to act quickly enough to address these issues.\n\n**SODELPA leadership**\n\nThe leadership of SODELPA was also criticized for its handling of the election campaign, with some members accusing the party leadership of being too soft on FijiFirst.\n\n**Military deployment**\n\nThe military was deployed in some areas to maintain order and stability, with reports of soldiers being used to intimidate voters and prevent them from casting their ballots.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe reactions to the election were mixed, with some welcoming the shift towards greater democracy and accountability, while others expressed concerns about the impact of the election on stability and security.\n\n**Domestic relations**\n\nThe relations between the parties were strained in the aftermath of the election, with FijiFirst accusing SODELPA and PAP of being overly aggressive and confrontational.

Born on April 16, 1974, in Santa Cruz, California, Sharma has spent his life exploring the vertical world, pushing the limits of physical and mental endurance, and inspiring a new generation of climbers.\n\n# Early life\n\nChris Sharma was born to a family of climbers. His parents, Harish and Karen Sharma, were both accomplished climbers and yoga instructors who instilled in their children a deep love and respect for the natural world. From a young age, Sharma was drawn to the mountains, where he would spend hours exploring the coastline and hills of Northern California.\n\nGrowing up in a family of climbers, Sharma was exposed to the sport from an early age. He began climbing at the age of 6, learning the basics from his parents and older siblings. As he grew older, Sharma's passion for climbing only intensified, and he began to compete in local and national competitions.\n\n# Climbing career\n\n## 1996–2002 (to Realization)\n\nSharma's early climbing career was marked by rapid progress and a series of notable ascents. In 1996, at the age of 22, he made his first major ascent, tackling the notorious \"Voyage of the Senses\" in the Santa Cruz Mountains. This climb, rated 5.13c, marked the beginning of Sharma's reputation as a rising star in the climbing world.\n\nOver the next several years, Sharma continued to push the limits of his abilities, tackling increasingly difficult routes and establishing himself as one of the world's top climbers. In 1998, he made the first ascent of \"Pure Imagination\" in Yosemite National Park, a 5.14a route that would become a benchmark for climbers for years to come.\n\n## 2002–2008 (to Jumbo Love)\n\nIn the early 2000s, Sharma shifted his focus to more extreme and adventurous climbing. He began exploring the world's most remote and inaccessible climbing destinations, from the towering walls of the Indian Himalayas to the unforgiving granite slabs of Patagonia.\n\nIn 2002, Sharma made the first ascent of \"Jumbo Love,\" a 5.14c route in the Sierra Nevada mountains. This climb, which took Sharma several days to complete, marked a major milestone in his career and cemented his reputation as one of the world's top climbers.\n\n## 2008–2013 (to La Dura Dura)\n\nIn the late 2000s and early 2010s, Sharma continued to push the limits of his abilities, tackling increasingly difficult routes and exploring new climbing destinations. In 2008, he made the first ascent of \"La Dura Dura,\" a 5.15a route in Oliana, Spain.\n\nThis climb, which took Sharma several weeks to complete, marked a major milestone in his career and solidified his reputation as one of the world's top climbers. Over the next several years, Sharma continued to tackle increasingly difficult routes, including the first ascent of \"Biographie\" in 2012.\n\n## Post 2013\n\nIn the years following his ascent of \"La Dura Dura,\" Sharma continued to climb at a high level, although at a slower pace than in the past. He began to focus more on his personal life and his passion for yoga and meditation, and less on competing and pushing the limits of his abilities.\n\nIn 2015, Sharma made the first ascent of \"Nessie,\" a 5.14d route in the Sierra Nevada mountains. This climb, which took Sharma several days to complete, marked a notable milestone in his career and demonstrated that he was still capable of tackling the world's most challenging routes.\n\n# Legacy\n\nChris Sharma's legacy in the climbing world is profound and far-reaching. He has inspired a generation of climbers with his innovative and groundbreaking ascents, and has helped to push the limits of what is possible on the world's most challenging routes.\n\nThrough his climbing and his advocacy, Sharma has helped to raise awareness about the importance of environmental conservation and the need to protect our planet's natural resources. He has also been a vocal advocate for the use of sustainable and eco-friendly climbing practices.\n\n# Personal life\n\n## Zen\n\nIn addition to his climbing career, Sharma is also a devoted student of Zen Buddhism and meditation. He has been practicing yoga and meditation for many years, and has found that these practices have helped him to cultivate a greater sense of calm, clarity, and focus in his life.\n\nSharma's love of Zen and meditation has also influenced his approach to climbing, where he seeks to cultivate a state of flow and presence in the midst of intense physical and mental challenge. By combining his passion for climbing with his practice of Zen and meditation, Sharma has been able to achieve a level of mental and physical well-being that is rare in the climbing world.\n\n# Notable ascents\n\n## Redpointed routes\n\n* Voyage of the Senses (5.13c), Santa Cruz Mountains\n* Pure Imagination (5.14a), Yosemite National Park\n* Jumbo Love (5.14c), Sierra Nevada mountains\n* La Dura Dura (5.15a), Oliana, Spain\n* Biographie (5.15a), Oliana, Spain\n* Nessie (5.14d), Sierra Nevada mountains\n\n## Onsighted routes\n\n* Picture Show (5.12a), Yosemite National Park\n* The Cookie Monster (5.13a), Yosemite National Park\n* The Fly (5.13b), Yosemite National Park\n\n## Deep-water solo routes\n\n* The Flying Squirrel (5.13a), Thailand\n* The Blue Angel (5.13b), Thailand\n\n## Boulder problems\n\n* The Bouldering Problem (V8), Yosemite National Park\n* The Powerline Problem (V9), Yosemite National Park\n\n# Bibliography\n\n* Sharma, C.

It is characterized by a specific set of colors woven into a repeating pattern of stripes, often associated with Scottish and other Celtic cultures. The term \"tartan\" is derived from the French word \"tartane,\" meaning \"woolen cloth,\" and has been used in English since the 17th century.\n\nEtymology and Terminology\n-------------------------\n\nThe term \"tartan\" has undergone various changes in spelling and meaning over the centuries. In the 16th century, the term referred to a type of woolen cloth, while in the 17th and 18th centuries, it referred to a specific type of plaid pattern. Today, the term is used to describe a wide range of plaid patterns, including those associated with Scottish clans and regiments.\n\nWeaving and Design\n------------------\n\n### Weaving Construction\n\nTartan weaving involves a specific type of loom called a \"tartan loom,\" which is designed to weave the complex patterns characteristic of tartan. The weaving process involves a combination of warp and weft threads, which are woven together to create the distinctive stripes of the tartan pattern.\n\n### Styles and Design Principles\n\nTartan designs are governed by a set of rules and principles that dictate the arrangement of colors and stripes. These principles include the use of specific colors, the arrangement of colors in a specific order, and the use of specific motifs and patterns. The most common tartan designs are characterized by a combination of red, blue, green, and yellow colors, although many other colors and variations are also used.\n\n### Colour, Palettes, and Meaning\n\nThe colors used in tartan designs are often associated with specific meanings and symbolism. For example, the colors of the Scottish flag, blue, white, and red, are often used in tartan designs to represent the nation's heritage. Other colors, such as green and yellow, are often associated with specific clans or families. The arrangement of colors in a tartan design can also convey specific information, such as a person's status or occupation.\n\nEarly History\n-------------\n\n### Pre-medieval Origins\n\nThe origins of tartan are unclear, but it is believed to have originated in the pre-medieval period, when the Celts were weaving woolen cloths in the Scottish Highlands.

The election was the party's fifth leadership contest and its second since the party's merger with the Canadian Alliance in 2003.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe leadership election was triggered by the resignation of Erin O'Toole, who became the party's leader in August 2020. O'Toole's leadership had been marked by controversy, particularly over his decision to support a COVID-19 vaccination mandate for members of the Canadian Armed Forces. He stepped down as leader on February 2, 2022, following a vote of non-confidence by the party's caucus.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n### 2020\n\n* August 24: Erin O'Toole is elected leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, defeating Peter MacKay, Leslyn Lewis, and Derek Sloan.\n* December 12: The COVID-19 pandemic is declared to be at a \"critical\" point in Canada, and the government announces a national vaccination mandate for members of the Canadian Armed Forces.\n\n### 2021\n\n* January 8: The Conservative Party of Canada's national council passes a resolution calling for an end to the COVID-19 vaccination mandate for members of the Canadian Armed Forces.\n* March 8: Erin O'Toole announces that he will support the vaccination mandate, despite opposition from within his own party.\n* June 20: The Conservative Party of Canada's national council passes a resolution calling for O'Toole to resign as leader.\n\n### 2022\n\n* January 11: Erin O'Toole announces that he will not seek re-election as leader of the Conservative Party of Canada.\n* February 2: O'Toole steps down as leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, triggering a leadership election.\n* February 19: The deadline for candidates to register for the leadership election passes, with 10 candidates registering to run.\n* March 17: The first debate of the leadership election is held, featuring all 10 candidates.\n* April 8: The deadline for party members to purchase a membership and vote in the leadership election passes.\n* April 9: The leadership election is held, with Pierre Poilievre declared the winner.\n\n**Rules and procedures**\n\nThe Conservative Party of Canada's leadership election rules and procedures are governed by the party's constitution. The election is open to all Conservative Party members, who must purchase a membership to be eligible to vote. The membership price varies depending on the province or territory, with a maximum price of $25 per year. The election is held by mail-in ballot, with members able to vote for their preferred candidate by returning a completed ballot to the party by the deadline.\n\n**Campaign**\n\nThe leadership campaign was marked by controversy and infighting within the party. Several candidates, including Pierre Poilievre and Leslyn Lewis, were criticized for their past comments and behaviors.

Born on September 30, 1969, in Upper Ferntree Gully, Victoria, Warne played international cricket for Australia from 1992 to 2007, captaining the team from 2000 to 2001. He was known for his unorthodox bowling action and his ability to take wickets off the surface, which earned him the nickname \"The King of Spin.\"\n\n**Early life**\n\nWarne was born to Keith and Judith Warne, and he grew up with two sisters, Kym and Joanne. His parents divorced when he was four years old, and he was raised by his mother in the suburban area of Upper Ferntree Gully. Warne developed an interest in cricket at a young age and began playing for local clubs in Melbourne. He attended Caulfield Grammar School, where he was an average student, but he excelled in cricket, representing the school in various tournaments.\n\n**Early career**\n\nWarne's early cricket career was marked by his success in junior competitions. He played for Victoria's under-15 and under-17 teams, and he made his first-class debut for Victoria in 1988. Warne's unorthodox bowling action, which involved a slow, spinning delivery, drew attention from selectors, and he was called up to the Australian under-19 team in 1988. He played in several junior tournaments, including the 1988 Under-19 World Cup, where he took 13 wickets in four matches.\n\n**Domestic career**\n\nWarne's domestic career was marked by his success with the Australian team, but he also played for Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory in domestic competitions. He made his first-class debut for Victoria in 1988 and played for the team until 2000. Warne was a regular member of the Victoria team, taking 342 wickets at an average of 25.39 in 64 matches. He also played for the Australian Capital Territory in the 2001-02 season, taking 22 wickets at an average of 20.63 in nine matches.\n\n**International career**\n\n#### Early international career (1992–1995)\n\nWarne made his international debut in 1992, playing for Australia against New Zealand. He was 22 years old at the time and was immediately recognized for his unique bowling action. Warne took 3/32 in his first test and went on to take 13 wickets in the two-match series. He made his ODI debut later that year and took 2/34 in his first match. Over the next three years, Warne established himself as a key member of the Australian team, taking 101 wickets in 23 tests and 57 wickets in 44 ODIs.\n\n#### West Indies tour, Cricket World Cup and injury (1995–1999)\n\nWarne's performances in the 1995 West Indies tour were impressive, taking 30 wickets in the five-match series. He also played a key role in the 1996 Cricket World Cup, taking 13 wickets in the tournament. However, his 1996 summer was marked by a series of injuries, including a side strain that forced him to miss several matches. Warne's injury problems continued in 1997, and he missed several matches, including the tour of South Africa.\n\n#### Vice-captaincy of Australia (1999–2000)\n\nWarne was appointed vice-captain of the Australian team in 1999, a position he held until 2000. He played a key role in the 1999-2000 tour of India, taking 25 wickets in the four-match series. Warne also played a crucial role in the 2000 tour of South Africa, taking 22 wickets in the three-match series.\n\n#### Wickets and injuries (2001–2003)\n\nWarne's wicket-taking ability remained one of his strongest assets, but his injury problems continued to plague him. He missed several matches in 2001, including the tour of New Zealand, and he played only three matches in the 2002 tour of England. In 2003, Warne's performances were affected by a series of injuries, and he missed several matches, including the tour of Sri Lanka.\n\n#### Ban from cricket (2003)\n\nIn 2003, Warne was banned from cricket for a year after testing positive for a banned substance. Warne claimed that he had taken a banned diuretic to treat a personal problem, but the ban was upheld by the Australian cricket board. Warne missed the 2003-04 season, including the tour of New Zealand, and he returned to the team in 2004.\n\n#### Return to cricket and beyond 600 Test wickets (2004–2006)\n\nWarne's return to cricket in 2004 was marked by his incredible performances, including a 7/108 in the second test against Pakistan. He continued to take wickets at an incredible rate, and in 2005, he surpassed the 500-wicket mark in test cricket. Warne's performances in 2006 were equally impressive, and he took his 700th wicket in test cricket in the fourth test against England.\n\n#### Later international career, 700th Test wicket and retirement (2006–2007)\n\nWarne's later international career was marked by his incredible wicket-taking ability, but also by his increasing injury problems. He played his final test in 2007 and retired from international cricket at the age of 37. Warne's performances in his final test were impressive, taking 5/122 in the first innings against South Africa.\n\n**Twenty20 career (2008–2013)**\n\nWarne played for the Australian team in the 2008-09 season, but he was not a regular member of the team. He played several matches for the Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League, taking 23 wickets in 19 matches. Warne also played for the Melbourne Stars in the Big Bash League, taking 12 wickets in nine matches.\n\n**Playing style**\n\nWarne's playing style was characterized by his unique bowling action, which involved a slow, spinning delivery. He was a leg-spinner, but his action was more similar to that of a left-arm orthodox spinner. Warne's ability to take wickets off the surface was one of his greatest strengths, and he was renowned for his ability to take wickets on the fifth day of a test. Warne's batting style was equally impressive, and he was a useful lower-order batsman for the Australian team.\n\n**Performance analysis**\n\n#### Test matches\n\nWarne played 145 test matches for Australia, taking 708 wickets at an average of 25.41.

This collaboration took many forms, including military cooperation, economic support, and ideological alignment.\n\n**Terminology**\n\nThe term \"collaboration\" is often associated with the French term \"collabos,\" which was used to describe individuals who collaborated with the German occupation. However, collaboration is a more nuanced term that encompasses a range of activities and relationships. In some cases, collaboration was a matter of survival, as individuals and groups sought to maintain their power, influence, or way of life under the new circumstances.\n\n**Collaboration in Western Europe**\n\nCollaboration in Western Europe was widespread and took many forms.\n\n### **Belgium**\n\nIn Belgium, collaboration with Germany was facilitated by the country's surrender in May 1940. The new government, led by King Leopold III, established a policy of collaboration, which included the establishment of a forced labor system and the creation of a military corps to support the German occupation. Many Belgians, including politicians, businessmen, and intellectuals, actively collaborated with the Germans, often in pursuit of personal gain or ideological alignment.\n\n### **British Channel Islands**\n\nThe British Channel Islands, which include Jersey and Guernsey, were occupied by Germany in 1940. The islands' governments and residents were pressured to collaborate with the Germans, who demanded support and cooperation in various forms, including the provision of labor, food, and other resources.\n\n### **Denmark**\n\nIn Denmark, collaboration with Germany was more nuanced. While many Danes actively collaborated with the Germans, others resisted or sought to maintain a neutral stance. The Danish government, led by King Christian X, negotiated a compromise with Germany, which allowed Denmark to maintain a degree of autonomy while still providing support to the Germans.\n\n### **France**\n\nFrance was occupied by Germany in June 1940, and the country's collaboration with the Germans was facilitated by the Vichy government, which was established by Marshal Philippe Pétain in July 1940. The Vichy regime implemented a range of policies aimed at supporting the German occupation, including the creation of a forced labor system and the establishment of a military corps to support the Germans.\n\n#### **Vichy France**\n\nVichy France was a collaborationist government that was established by Marshal Philippe Pétain in July 1940. The Vichy regime implemented a range of policies aimed at supporting the German occupation, including the creation of a forced labor system and the establishment of a military corps to support the Germans.\n\n#### **Collaborationist movements**\n\nIn France, several collaborationist movements emerged, including the Milice française, which was a paramilitary organization that was established by the Vichy government to support the German occupation. Other collaborationist movements, such as the Parti populaire français and the Rassemblement national populaire, were also established to promote French-German cooperation and support the Vichy regime.\n\n#### **Uniformed collaboration**\n\nUniformed collaboration in France took several forms, including the creation of a military corps to support the Germans and the establishment of a police force to enforce German rule. Many French soldiers and police officers actively collaborated with the Germans, often in pursuit of personal gain or ideological alignment.\n\n#### **Communist party**\n\nThe French Communist Party, which had been banned by the Vichy government, continued to operate in", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Collaboration_with_Nazi_Germany_and_Fascist_Italy\" following this outline:\n\n#Terminology\n#Collaboration in Western Europe\n##Belgium\n##British Channel Islands\n##Denmark\n##France\n###Vichy France\n###Collaborationist movements\n###Uniformed collaboration\n###Communist party\n###French workers for Germany\n###Vichy collaboration in the Holocaust\n###Aftermath\n##Luxembourg\n##Monaco\n##Netherlands\n##Norway\n#Collaboration in Eastern Europe\n##Albania\n##Baltic states\n###Estonia\n###Latvia\n###Lithuania\n##Bulgaria\n##Czecho-Slovakia\n###Sudetenland\n###Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (the Czech lands)\n###Slovak Republic\n##Greece\n##Hungary\n##Poland\n##Romania\n##Yugoslavia\n###Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia\n####Serbian units\n####Ethnic Russian units\n####Banat\n###Montenegro\n###Kosovo\n###Macedonia\n###Slovene Lands\n###Independent State of Croatia\n###Bosnia\n#Soviet Union\n##Hiwis\n##Eastern Legions\n##Russia\n###Kalmykians\n##Belarus\n##Transcaucasia\n#Collaboration beyond Europe with the European Axis powers\n##Egypt and the Palestine mandate\n##French colonial empire\n###French North Africa\n####Morocco\n####Tunisia\n###French Equatorial Africa\n###Syria and the Lebanon (League of Nations mandates)\n#Foreign volunteers\n##French military volunteers\n##Volunteers from British India\n##Non-German units of the Waffen-SS\n#Business collaboration\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Bibliography\n#Further reading\n##Estonia\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The phenomenon was characterized by a wave of eyewitness accounts describing saucer-shaped objects seen in the sky, often accompanied by claims of landings, close encounters, and alleged recoveries of debris.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe 1947 flying disc craze was a defining moment in the history of UFO sightings, marking the beginning of a widespread and enduring fascination with the possibility of extraterrestrial life. The events of that summer captivated the public imagination, sparking debates about the nature of the sightings and the implications for science, technology, and society.\n\n**Events of Summer 1947**\n\nThe flying disc craze began in early June 1947, when private pilot Kenneth Arnold reported seeing nine disk-shaped objects flying in formation over Mount Rainier, Washington. Arnold's sighting was widely publicized and sparked a wave of similar reports from across the country.\n\n### **Initial reports**\n\nArnold's sighting on June 24, 1947, was the first reported incident of the summer. However, it was not until July that the phenomenon gained widespread attention. On July 2, a pilot reported seeing a disc-shaped object near Seattle, Washington. Similar reports began to flood in from across the Pacific Northwest, including Washington, Oregon, and Idaho.\n\n### **Additional reports**\n\nAs the summer progressed, reports of flying discs continued to pour in from across the country. On July 3, a group of people in Oregon reported seeing a disc-shaped object in the sky. In California, a pilot reported seeing a disc near Sacramento. These sightings were often described as being saucer-shaped, disk-shaped, or cylindrical.\n\n### **Pacific Northwest reports amid jet speculation**\n\nThe Pacific Northwest was particularly prone to flying disc sightings, with multiple reports coming from Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. At the time, there was significant speculation about the possibility of military jets or other experimental aircraft being involved in the sightings. However, many eyewitnesses described the objects as being unlike any known aircraft.\n\n### **Reports throughout the West**\n\nAs the summer progressed, reports of flying discs spread throughout the Western United States, including California, Arizona, and Nevada. In some cases, witnesses described seeing multiple objects, often in a line or formation. These sightings were often accompanied by claims of strange lights, strange sounds, or other unusual phenomena.\n\n### **Potential explanations offered**\n\nIn the face of the sudden and widespread reports of flying discs, officials and experts were quick to offer explanations. Some suggested that the objects might be experimental aircraft, while others proposed that they might be natural phenomena, such as meteors or unusual cloud formations. However, many witnesses were adamant that the objects were unlike anything they had ever seen before.\n\n### **Increasing prominence**\n\nAs the summer wore on, the flying disc phenomenon gained increasing prominence in the media and public consciousness. On July 8, a group of people in Washington state reported seeing a disc-shaped object land in a field. This sighting was widely publicized and sparked a wave of interest in the possibility of extraterrestrial life.\n\n### **Lt. Governor sighting followed by official investigation**\n\nOn July 9, the Lt. Governor of Washington state reported seeing a disc-shaped object in the sky. In response to this sighting, Governor Monrad Wallgren launched an official investigation into the phenomenon. This investigation was one of the first of its kind and helped to fuel public interest in the flying disc craze.\n\n### **San Francisco fireworks and stories of landings**\n\nOn July 10, a group of people in San Francisco reported seeing a disc-shaped object land in a field. This sighting was accompanied by claims of strange lights and sounds. Similar reports began to flood in from across the country, with many witnesses describing seeing discs land in fields or other rural areas.\n\n### **July 4 press reports**\n\nOn July 4, a group of newspapers reported on the flying disc phenomenon, with many describing it as a \"saucer-shaped\" object. These reports helped to fuel public interest in the phenomenon and sparked a wave of speculation about the nature of the sightings.\n\n### **Flight 105**\n\nOn July 5, a commercial airliner reported seeing a disc-shaped object in the sky. This sighting was widely publicized and helped to fuel public interest in the phenomenon.\n\n### **Group sightings**\n\nAs the summer wore on, group sightings of flying discs became more common. On July 6, a group of people in Oregon reported seeing a disc-shaped object in the sky.

It was founded in 1972 by M. G. Ramachandran, a prominent actor and politician, after his departure from the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), another prominent Tamil party.\n\n**Ideology and policies**\n\n### Culture\n\nThe AIADMK has traditionally been known for its strong emphasis on Tamil culture and identity. The party has consistently championed the cause of Tamil language, literature, and arts. The party's ideology is rooted in the principles of Tamil nationalism, which emphasizes the importance of Tamil culture and identity in the face of regional and national forces that often try to suppress these values.\n\n### Economy\n\nThe AIADMK has traditionally been associated with a pro-business and pro-industrialization economic agenda. The party has consistently promoted the development of industries, particularly in the sectors of textiles, automobiles, and IT, and has sought to attract foreign investment to Tamil Nadu. The party has also emphasized the importance of rural development and has implemented various schemes to improve the livelihoods of rural communities.\n\n### Social justice\n\nThe AIADMK has a strong commitment to social justice and has implemented various policies to promote the welfare of marginalized communities. The party has consistently championed the cause of women's empowerment, Dalit rights, and the rights of other marginalized communities.

The party has implemented various schemes to promote the efficient use of water and has sought to protect the interests of farmers and other water users. The party has also emphasized the importance of protecting the state's water resources from pollution and encroachment.\n\n### Environment and nature\n\nThe AIADMK has consistently emphasized the importance of protecting the environment and natural resources. The party has implemented various schemes to promote sustainable development and has sought to protect the state's natural resources from pollution and degradation. The party has also emphasized the importance of promoting eco-friendly practices and has implemented various schemes to promote the use of renewable energy.\n\n**History**\n\n### M. G. Ramachandran era (1972–87)\n\nThe AIADMK was founded in 1972 by M. G. Ramachandran, a prominent actor and politician. Ramachandran had previously been a member of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), but he had a falling out with the party's leadership and decided to form his own party. The AIADMK quickly gained popularity and became a major force in Tamil Nadu politics.\n\n#### Succession conflict between the Janaki and Jayalalithaa factions\n\nAfter Ramachandran's death in 1987, there was a succession crisis within the party. Two factions emerged, one led by Ramachandran's wife, Janaki Ramachandran, and the other led by Ramachandran's close associate, Jayalalithaa. The two factions engaged in a bitter struggle for control of the party, which ultimately led to the emergence of Jayalalithaa as the party's leader.\n\n### J. Jayalalithaa era (1989–2016)\n\nJayalalithaa became the leader of the AIADMK in 1989 and went on to become one of the most prominent figures in Indian politics. She led the party to several electoral victories and implemented various policies to promote the welfare of the people of Tamil Nadu. Jayalalithaa's leadership was marked by her strong nationalist and anti-corruption stance.\n\n#### Expansion beyond Tamil Nadu and Puducherry\n\nUnder Jayalalithaa's leadership, the AIADMK expanded its presence beyond Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. The party won several seats in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha and established a significant presence in other states, particularly in the southern region.\n\n**V. K. Sasikala and T. T. V. Dhinakaran era (2016–17)**\n\nAfter Jayalalithaa's death in 2016, the AIADMK was plunged into a leadership crisis. V. K. Sasikala, Jayalalithaa's close associate, was elected as the party's general secretary, but she was later expelled from the party. T. T. V. Dhinakaran, Sasikala's nephew, emerged as the leader of the Sasikala faction.\n\n#### Expulsion of V. K. Sasikala and T. T. V. Dhinakaran\n\nIn 2017, the AIADMK expelled Sasikala and Dhinakaran from the party, citing their involvement in corruption and other unethical activities.\n\n**O. Panneerselvam and Edappadi K. Palaniswami era (2017–22)**\n\nAfter the expulsion of Sasikala and Dhinakaran, O. Panneerselvam and Edappadi K. Palaniswami emerged as the leaders of the AIADMK. Palaniswami was elected as the party's chief minister, while Panneerselvam was appointed as the deputy chief minister.\n\n#### Legal fight for the party by V. K. Sasikala and T. T. V. Dhinakaran\n\nSasikala and Dhinakaran continued to claim that they were the rightful leaders of the AIADMK and launched a legal fight to regain control of the party.\n\n#### Tensions with BJP\n\nThe AIADMK has had a complex relationship with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has been a major force in Indian politics. The party has been critical of the BJP's policies and has sought to protect the interests of the people of Tamil Nadu.\n\n#### Leadership tussle between O. Panneerselvam and Edappadi K. Palaniswami\n\nPanneerselvam and Palaniswami have had a long-standing leadership tussle, which has led to a split in the party.\n\n**Edappadi K. Palaniswami era (2022–present)**\n\nIn 2022, Edappadi K. Palaniswami was elected as the leader of the AIADMK, marking the end of the leadership tussle between Panneerselvam and Palaniswami.\n\n**Electoral performance**\n\n### Indian general elections\n\nThe AIADMK has performed well in Indian general elections, winning several seats in the Lok Sabha.\n\n### State legislative assembly elections\n\nThe AIADMK has been a major force in Tamil Nadu politics, winning several state legislative assembly elections.\n\n**Current office bearers and prominent members**\n\n### General Secretaries\n\n* Edappadi K.

From its inception, Zionism has grappled with the question of what it means to be Jewish, particularly in the context of racial and ethnic identity. This article provides an overview of the various conceptions of Jewish identity in Zionism, from the early days of the movement to the present.\n\n**Literature Review**\n\nThe concept of Jewish identity in Zionism has been explored in various academic studies. For example, historian Gershon Shafir has written extensively on the relationship between Zionism and Jewish identity, highlighting the tensions between different factions within the movement. Similarly, scholar Ella Shohat has critiqued the dominant narratives of Jewish identity in Zionism, arguing that they have often been based on a narrow and exclusionary definition of what it means to be Jewish.\n\n**History**\n\n### Background\n\nThe concept of Jewish identity in Zionism was shaped by the complex and often contradictory experiences of Jewish people in Europe and the Middle East. On the one hand, Jewish communities in these regions had developed a rich and distinctive cultural heritage, with their own languages, customs, and traditions. On the other hand, Jewish people had also faced centuries of persecution and marginalization, which had led to the development of a strong sense of shared identity and solidarity.\n\n### Early Zionism\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the first wave of Zionism emerged as a response to the growing anti-Semitism in Europe. Leaders such as Theodor Herzl and Chaim Weizmann saw the establishment of a Jewish homeland as a way to escape persecution and create a safe haven for Jewish people. However, this early Zionism was often characterized by a racialized and exclusivist understanding of Jewish identity, which emphasized the need for a Jewish state to be populated by \"pure\" Jews who were free from the \"taint\" of non-Jewish influence.\n\n### 1948–1960s\n\nIn the aftermath of World War II and the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, Zionism underwent a significant shift. The trauma of the Holocaust and the displacement of Jewish people from their homes in Europe led to a growing emphasis on the need for Jewish identity to be based on a sense of shared victimhood and solidarity. However, this emphasis on shared identity also led to a growing tension between different factions within the Zionist movement, particularly between the Labor and Revisionist wings.\n\n### 1960s–2000\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the Israeli government began to adopt a more inclusive definition of Jewish identity, which emphasized the importance of cultural and national identity over racial or ethnic differences. This shift was driven in part by the growing influence of immigration from North Africa and the Middle East, which introduced new cultural and linguistic practices into Israeli society. However, this shift also led to tensions between different groups within Israeli society, particularly between Ashkenazi and Mizrahi Jews.\n\n### The Genome Era: 2000 to the Present\n\nIn recent years, the concept of Jewish identity has been influenced by advances in genetic research and the development of DNA testing. Some proponents of this approach argue that Jewish identity can be defined by a shared genetic heritage, which can be identified through DNA testing. However, this approach has been criticized by many in the Jewish community, who argue that it is reductionist and neglects the complex cultural and historical factors that shape Jewish identity.\n\n### Race and Non-Jews\n\nOne of the most contentious issues in the concept of Jewish identity in Zionism is the relationship between Jewish identity and non-Jewish identity. Some proponents of Zionism have argued that Jewish identity is inherently opposed to non-Jewish identity, and that the two cannot be reconciled. However, this view has been challenged by many in the Jewish community, who argue that Jewish identity is not fixed or essential, but rather is shaped by a complex interplay of cultural, historical, and social factors.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe concept of Jewish identity in Zionism has had a profound impact on the development of Israeli society and politics. The emphasis on a racialized and exclusivist understanding of Jewish identity has contributed to the development of a complex and often contentious relationship between different groups within Israeli society, particularly between Ashkenazi and Mizrahi Jews. The shift towards a more inclusive definition of Jewish identity has also contributed to the growth of tensions between different groups within Israeli society, particularly between secular and religious Jews.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Zionism\n* Jewish identity\n* Israeli society\n* Mizrahi Jews\n* Ashkenazi Jews\n* Genetic research\n* DNA testing\n\n**Notes**\n\nThis article provides an overview of the various conceptions of Jewish identity in Zionism from the early days of the movement to the present. It highlights the tensions between different factions within the movement, particularly between Labor and Revisionist Zionists.

A Tupolev Tu-154M aircraft, operated by the Wagner Group, a Russian private military company, crashed while attempting to land at the Ramonski Airfield, killing all 27 people on board.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Wagner Group is a Russian private military company founded in 2014 by Dmitry Utkin, a former member of the Russian military. The company has been involved in various military conflicts in Ukraine, Syria, and Libya, and has been accused of human rights abuses and war crimes. The company's activities have been shrouded in secrecy, and its leadership has been the subject of various rumors and speculations.\n\n**Aircraft**\n\nThe Tupolev Tu-154M aircraft that crashed was a variant of the Tu-154, a Soviet-era passenger jet that has been widely used for military and civilian purposes. The Tu-154M is a modified version of the Tu-154, with a more powerful engine and improved avionics. The aircraft was manufactured in 1985 and had been used by the Russian military for transport and cargo purposes.\n\n**Incident**\n\nOn January 9, 2023, the Tupolev Tu-154M aircraft, registration RA-85820, took off from the Rostov-on-Don Airport in southern Russia, carrying a group of Wagner Group personnel to the city of Ramonski in the Kursk Oblast. The aircraft was flying at an altitude of 15,000 feet (4,572 meters) when it began to experience technical difficulties. The pilots attempted to make an emergency landing at the Ramonski Airfield, but the aircraft crashed into a wooded area about 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) from the airfield. The impact and subsequent fire killed all 27 people on board.\n\n**Passengers and crew**\n\nThe passengers and crew on board the aircraft were all employees of the Wagner Group. The group included high-ranking officials, military personnel, and support staff. The exact identities of the passengers and crew have not been made public due to security concerns. However, it is believed that the group included some of the company's top leaders, including Dmitry Utkin.\n\n**Investigation**\n\nThe investigation into the crash is being led by the Russian Investigative Committee. The committee has launched a criminal investigation into the causes of the crash and has begun to gather evidence from the crash site. The committee has also begun to interview witnesses and to review the aircraft's flight data recorders. The investigation is ongoing, and no official cause for the crash has been determined.\n\n**Assessments outside Russia**\n\nThe crash of the Wagner Group aircraft has been met with widespread criticism and condemnation from outside Russia. The incident has highlighted the risks and dangers of private military companies and has raised concerns about the accountability and transparency of these organizations. The crash has also been seen as a potential blow to the Wagner Group's operations and reputation.\n\n**Effect on the Wagner Group**\n\nThe crash of the Wagner Group aircraft has had a significant impact on the company's operations and reputation. The incident has raised questions about the company's safety record and has sparked concerns about the risks and dangers of private military companies. The crash has also led to a significant increase in scrutiny and criticism of the company's activities, both inside and outside Russia.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe aftermath of the crash has been marked by a significant outpouring of support for the families of the victims. The Russian government has established a special fund to provide financial assistance to the families of the victims and has pledged to provide full support to the investigation. The Wagner Group has also issued a statement expressing its condolences to the families of the victims and has pledged to cooperate fully with the investigation.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n**Domestic**\n\nThe crash of the Wagner Group aircraft has been met with widespread shock and outrage in Russia. The incident has sparked a significant increase in scrutiny and criticism of the company's activities, both inside and outside Russia. The Russian government has been criticized for its handling of the investigation and for its failure to provide adequate support to the families of the victims.\n\n**International**\n\nThe crash of the Wagner Group aircraft has been met with widespread condemnation and criticism from outside Russia. The incident has highlighted the risks and dangers of private military companies and has raised concerns about the accountability and transparency of these organizations. The crash has also been seen as a potential blow to the Wagner Group's operations and reputation.\n\n**Memorials**\n\nA memorial service was held at the Ramonski Airfield on January 12, 2023, to honor the victims of the crash. The service was attended by government officials, military personnel, and representatives of the Wagner Group. A memorial plaque was unveiled at the airfield to commemorate the victims of the crash.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Private military company\n* Russian Investigative Committee\n* Tupolev Tu-154\n* Wagner Group\n\nNote: This article is a work of fiction and is not based on any real events or individuals.

The election followed the resignation of Boris Johnson as party leader and Prime Minister on July 7, 2022, amidst a government crisis and amid controversy over the Partygate scandal.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Brexit and the 2019 leadership election\n\nThe Conservative Party has been dominated by the issue of Brexit since the 2016 referendum, in which a majority of British voters chose to leave the European Union. The 2019 Conservative Party leadership election was held in the wake of Theresa May's resignation, following her failure to secure a Brexit deal. Boris Johnson was elected as the new leader, promising to deliver Brexit by October 31, 2019.\n\n### 2019 general election\n\nThe 2019 general election was held in December 2019, with Johnson's Conservative Party winning a significant majority, allowing him to pass the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament. However, the party's victory was also marked by controversy, including accusations of voter suppression and misinformation.\n\n### COVID-19 pandemic and Partygate\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the Conservative Party's leadership, with Johnson's handling of the crisis facing widespread criticism. The Partygate scandal, which emerged in January 2022, further eroded public trust in the party and its leadership. Johnson's decision to hold a series of parties during lockdown, including a birthday celebration for himself, sparked outrage and calls for his resignation.\n\n### June 2022 confidence vote\n\nIn June 2022, Johnson faced a confidence vote within the Conservative Party, in which he won with a slim majority. However, the vote was seen as a significant setback for Johnson, and he was already under pressure from his own MPs over the Partygate scandal.\n\n### Government crisis\n\nThe Conservative Party's leadership election was precipitated by a government crisis, which was sparked by a series of resignations, including those of Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid. The crisis highlighted deep divisions within the party, with some MPs calling for Johnson's resignation and others defending him.\n\n**Election details**\n\nThe July–September 2022 Conservative Party leadership election was a two-stage process, with a first round of voting taking place between July 12 and July 14, 2022, and a second round taking place between July 18 and July 21, 2022.\n\n**Campaign**\n\nThe campaign for the leadership election was marked by a series of hustings, debates, and public appearances by the candidates.

The debates focused on a range of issues, including the economy, healthcare, and Brexit.\n\n### Public reaction\n\nThe debates were widely watched and sparked significant public reaction, with many viewers expressing criticism of the candidates and their policies.\n\n**Public hustings**\n\nThe candidates also took part in a series of public hustings, which were held across the UK. The hustings provided an opportunity for the candidates to address voters and respond to questions.\n\n**Opinion polling**\n\nThe leadership election was subject to a range of opinion polls, which measured public opinion on the candidates and their policies. The polls suggested a close contest between Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss, with some polls showing a narrow lead for Sunak and others showing a narrow lead for Truss.\n\n### Sunak vs. Truss\n\nThe polls suggested a close contest between Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss, with some polls showing a narrow lead for Sunak and others showing a narrow lead for Truss. The polls suggested that Sunak's lead was due to his perceived economic competence, while Truss's lead was due to her perceived commitment to Brexit.\n\n### Sunak vs. Truss vs. Johnson\n\nThe polls also suggested that Rishi Sunak's lead over Liz Truss was due to his perceived ability to unite the party and deliver a stable government.

It led to the emergence of Protestantism, which diversified into various denominations. The movement's impact extended beyond theology to politics, culture, and society as a whole.\n\n# Terminology\n\nThe term \"Reformation\" is derived from the Latin \"reformatio,\" meaning \"renewal\" or \"restoration.\" It is often associated with the Protestant movement, but other Christian denominations, such as the Eastern Orthodox Church, also underwent significant changes during this period.\n\n# Background\n\n## Calamities\n\nThe 15th century saw a succession of calamities, including the Black Death, which had a devastating impact on the European population and economy. The resulting social and economic upheaval created an environment in which the Catholic Church's authority was challenged.\n\n## Late Medieval Christianity\n\n### Institutions\n\nThe Catholic Church's institutional structure was highly centralized, with the Pope holding significant power. The Church's wealth and influence had grown to the point where it was seen as corrupt and oppressive by many.\n\n### Clergy\n\nThe clergy's relationship with the laity was often distant, with many clergymen seen as more interested in accumulating wealth and power than in serving the faithful. This led to widespread criticism of the clergy and the Church's institutions.\n\n### Papacy\n\nThe Papacy was seen as overly powerful and corrupt, with Popes often engaging in politics and personal scandals. This led to a growing sense of disillusionment with the Church and its leadership.\n\n### Partial and failed institutional reforms\n\nThe Catholic Church had undergone partial reforms in the centuries leading up to the Reformation, but these had largely failed to address the underlying issues. The Church's institutional structure remained largely unchanged, and its corrupt practices continued unabated.\n\n## Humanism and lay religion\n\nHumanism, a movement that emphasized the potential of human beings to achieve great things through education and reason, began to challenge the Church's authority. Laypeople began to take a more active role in their spiritual lives, seeking direct access to scripture and the sacraments.\n\n## Dissidents\n\nDissidents, such as the Lollards in England and the Hussites in Bohemia, emerged as vocal critics of the Church's practices and teachings. These groups laid the groundwork for the Protestant movement, which would soon sweep across Europe.\n\n# Beginnings\n\n## Luther and the Ninety-five Theses\n\nIn 1517, Martin Luther, a German theologian and monk, posted his Ninety-five Theses on the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, Germany. These theses challenged the Catholic Church's practice of selling indulgences and marked the beginning of the Reformation.\n\n## New theology\n\nLuther's theology emphasized justification by faith alone, the authority of scripture, and the priesthood of all believers. This new theology was a significant departure from the Catholic Church's teachings and would become the cornerstone of Protestantism.\n\n## Spread\n\nLuther's ideas quickly spread throughout Germany and beyond. Other theologians, such as Huldrych Zwingli and John Calvin, developed their own versions of Protestantism, leading to a proliferation of denominations.\n\n## Resistance and oppression\n\nThe Catholic Church and its allies responded to the Reformation with resistance and oppression. Many Protestant leaders were persecuted, and some were even martyred.\n\n# Alternatives\n\n## Saxon radicals and rebellious knights\n\nIn Germany, a group of Saxon radicals and rebellious knights emerged as a alternative to Luther's moderate approach. They advocated for a more radical form of Protestantism, which would eventually lead to the Peasants' War.\n\n## Zwingli\n\nHuldrych Zwingli, a Swiss theologian, developed a distinct form of Protestantism in Zurich. His teachings emphasized the importance of scripture and the sacraments, and he is often seen as a bridge between Luther and Calvin.\n\n## Swiss Brethren\n\nThe Swiss Brethren, a group of Anabaptists, emerged in Switzerland as a radical alternative to the established Church. They emphasized adult baptism, community of goods, and non-violence.\n\n## Peasants' War\n\nThe Peasants' War, a rebellion led by a coalition of peasants, artisans, and nobles, broke out in Germany in 1524. The war was a disaster for the rebels, but it marked a significant turning point in the Reformation.\n\n# Consolidation\n\n## Princely Reformation in Germany\n\nAs the Reformation gained momentum, many German princes began to adopt Protestantism as the official state church. This led to a significant shift in the balance of power in Germany.\n\n## Stalemate in Switzerland\n\nIn Switzerland, the Reformation led to a stalemate between the Protestant and Catholic cantons. The country was divided, and the conflict would continue for centuries.\n\n## Schleitheim Articles\n\nThe Schleitheim Articles, a set of principles adopted by the Swiss Brethren, emphasized the importance of adult baptism, non-violence, and community of goods.\n\n## Confessions\n\nThe various Protestant denominations developed their own confessions of faith, which outlined their core teachings and practices.\n\n## Royal Reformation in Scandinavia\n\nIn Scandinavia, the Reformation led to the adoption of Lutheranism as the official state church. The royal families played a significant role in promoting Protestantism in these countries.\n\n# Catholic reform\n\n## Beginnings\n\nThe Catholic Church also underwent significant reforms during this period. The movement for reform began with the Council of Pisa in 1409, which aimed to address the Church's corruption and inefficiency.\n\n## New Orders\n\nNew orders, such as the Jesuits, emerged as a response to the Reformation. These orders emphasized education, spirituality, and missionary work.\n\n## Council of Trent\n\nThe Council of Trent, a major ecumenical council, was convened in 1545 to address the Reformation and promote Catholic reform. The council's decrees emphasized the importance of scripture, tradition, and the sacraments.\n\n# New waves\n\n## English reformation under Henry VIII\n\nIn England, the Reformation was initiated by Henry VIII, who broke with Rome and established the Church of England. This led to a wave of Protestantism that would sweep across the country.\n\n## Münster\n\nIn Münster, a group of Anabaptists established a theocratic community that was marked by violence and intolerance. The community was eventually crushed by the authorities.\n\n## Calvin and the Institutes of the Christian Religion\n\nJohn Calvin, a French theologian, developed a distinctive form of Protestantism in Geneva. His Institutes of the Christian Religion became a major theological textbook for Protestantism.\n\n## Reformation in Britain\n\nThe Reformation in Britain was marked by significant conflict and persecution. Many Protestant leaders were martyred, including Thomas Cranmer and Hugh Latimer.\n\n## Servetus and the Restoration of Christianity\n\nMichael Servetus, a Spanish theologian, was a vocal critic of Calvin's theology. He was eventually martyred by Calvin, marking a significant turning point in the Reformation.\n\n# Wars of religion and tolerance\n\n## Schmalkaldic Wars\n\nThe Schmalkaldic Wars, a series of conflicts between Protestant and Catholic forces, broke out in Germany in the 1540s. The wars were fought over issues of territory and influence.\n\n## French Wars of Religion\n\nIn France, the Wars of Religion broke out in the 1560s, with Catholics and Protestants engaging in a series of brutal conflicts. The wars ended with the Edict of Nantes, which granted toleration to Protestants.\n\n## Revolt in the Netherlands\n\nThe Revolt in the Netherlands, led by William of Orange, broke out in the 1560s as a response to Spanish rule. The revolt would eventually lead to the establishment of the Dutch Republic.\n\n## Edict of Torda\n\nThe Edict of Torda, issued in 1568, granted toleration to Protestants in Hungary. The edict marked a significant turning point in the Reformation in Eastern Europe.\n\n## Warsaw Confederation\n\nThe Warsaw Confederation, a coalition of Polish and Lithuanian nobles, was formed in 1573 to promote religious tolerance. The confederation marked a significant shift in the balance of power in Eastern Europe.\n\n## Counter-Reformation and regional conflicts\n\nThe Counter-Reformation, a Catholic response to the Reformation, led to a series of regional conflicts and wars. The movement emphasized the importance of scripture, tradition, and the sacraments.\n\n# Reformation outside Germany\n\n## Nordic countries\n\n### Iceland\n\nIceland, a Scandinavian country, underwent a Reformation in the 16th century.

They were a powerful and influential tribe that played a significant role in the history of the region.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name \"Samnites\" is derived from the Sabine language, in which it is written as \"Samanium\" or \"Saminium\". The name is thought to be related to the Samnite word for \"mountain\", which is \"Saminus\". The Samnites were often referred to by the Romans as \"Saminium\", which is Latin for \"land of the Samnites\".\n\n**History**\n\n### Origins and early history\n\nThe origins of the Samnites are not well documented, but it is believed that they descended from the ancient Italic people who lived in the region before the arrival of the Indo-Europeans. The Samnites were a confederation of several tribes that lived in the Apennine Mountains, including the Pentri, the Caudini, and the Caraceni. They were known for their skill in warfare and their ability to defend their territory against invading forces.\n\nThe Samnites were also known for their agricultural skills, and they were one of the earliest civilizations in the region to cultivate wine, olive oil, and other crops. They were also skilled in metalworking and were known for their iron and bronze tools and weapons.\n\n### Samnite Wars\n\nThe Samnites played a significant role in the history of the Roman Republic, particularly during the Samnite Wars, which took place from 343 to 290 BC. The wars were a series of conflicts between the Samnites and the Romans, who were trying to expand their territory. The Samnites were able to resist the Roman advances for many years, but eventually, they were defeated and forced to surrender.\n\nThe Samnite Wars had a significant impact on the Roman Republic, as they helped to establish Rome as a major power in the region. The wars also led to the development of the Roman legions, which were instrumental in the expansion of the Roman Empire.\n\n### Later history\n\nAfter the Samnite Wars, the Samnites continued to play a significant role in the history of the region. They were known for their skill in warfare and their ability to defend their territory against invading forces. However, they were also subject to the influence of the Romans, who were trying to expand their territory.\n\nIn the 1st century BC, the Samnites were involved in the Social War, which was a conflict between the Romans and the Italian allies, including the Samnites. The war was sparked by the Roman decision to grant citizenship to the allies, but only to those who were willing to fight on behalf of Rome. The Samnites were opposed to the decision and refused to accept the offer of citizenship.\n\nThe Social War was a disaster for the Samnites, and they were eventually forced to surrender. The war marked the end of the Samnite Confederation and the beginning of the Roman dominance of the region.\n\n**Society**\n\n### Economy\n\nThe Samnites were a primarily agricultural society, and their economy was based on the cultivation of crops such as wheat, barley, and olives.

They were governed by a council of elders, which was responsible for making decisions on behalf of the tribe. The council was made up of representatives from each of the tribes, and it was responsible for defending the territory and making decisions on trade and commerce.\n\nThe Samnites were also known for their system of laws, which was based on the concept of \"lex\". The lex was a set of laws that governed the behavior of individuals and the tribe as a whole. The lex was used to settle disputes and to punish those who broke the law.\n\n### Military\n\nThe Samnites were known for their skill in warfare, and their military was one of the most powerful in the region. They were skilled in the use of iron and bronze tools and weapons, and they were able to resist the advances of the Romans and other invading forces.\n\nThe Samnites were also known for their use of cavalry, which was used to scout out enemy positions and to attack enemy forces. They were also skilled in the use of infantry, which was used to defend the territory and to attack enemy forces.\n\n#### Armor\n\nThe Samnites were known for their use of armor, which was made from iron and bronze. They wore helmets, breastplates, and greaves to protect themselves from enemy attacks. They also used shields to defend themselves from enemy arrows and other projectiles.\n\n#### Weaponry\n\nThe Samnites were known for their use of iron and bronze tools and weapons. They used swords, spears, and javelins to attack enemy forces, and they were skilled in the use of these weapons.\n\n**Culture**\n\n### Religion\n\nThe Samnites were a polytheistic people, and they worshipped a variety of gods and goddesses.

They would often sacrifice animals and other goods to the gods, and they would also offer prayers and hymns to ensure the protection and prosperity of the tribe.\n\n### Gender roles\n\nThe Samnites were a patriarchal society, and men played a significant role in the governance and defense of the tribe. Women played a more limited role, and they were often confined to the home and responsible for childcare and domestic tasks.\n\nHowever, women also played a significant role in the economy and in the worship of the gods.

In 1978, Congress passed the Presidential Records Act, which requires the President to transfer all records to the National Archives upon leaving office. However, in 2018, the Trump administration refused to transfer certain records to NARA, citing executive privilege.\n\n### Criminal laws listed on search warrant\n\nThe search warrant executed on August 8, 2022, cited several federal laws, including:\n\n* 18 U.S.C. § 793(f): Gathering, transmitting, or losing defense information\n* 18 U.S.C. § 793(e): Failure to report the loss of national defense information\n* 18 U.S.C. § 2071: Concealment, removal, or mutilation generally\n\n### Classified material and the presidency\n\nThe President has the authority to declassify classified information, but this authority is not absolute. The President must follow established protocols and procedures to declassify information, and the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) must approve declassifications.\n\n#### Declassification, presidential powers and regulations\n\nThe President's power to declassify information is established in the Constitution and the Presidential Records Act. However, the President must follow established procedures and protocols to declassify information, and the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) must approve declassifications.\n\n#### Protocols for loss or compromise of classified material\n\nIn the event of a loss or compromise of classified material, the President and the National Security Agency (NSA) must follow established protocols to investigate and mitigate the damage.\n\n**Events leading to the search**\n\n### NARA actions to retrieve presidential records from Mar-a-Lago\n\nIn January 2022, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requested that the Trump administration return all presidential records to NARA by February 2022. However, in February 2022, NARA sent a second request to the Trump administration, indicating that some records were still missing.\n\n### Partial return of records to NARA\n\nIn March 2022, the Trump administration returned some presidential records to NARA, but the agency stated that some records were still missing.\n\n### Trump's statement regarding return of records\n\nIn a statement, Trump claimed that the records returned to NARA were \"all declassified\" and that he had the authority to declassify any information.\n\n### NARA makes criminal referral\n\nIn May 2022, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) made a criminal referral to the Department of Justice (DOJ) regarding the missing presidential records.\n\n### Tom Fitton's advice to Trump\n\nIn a statement, Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, advised Trump to \"not cooperate\" with the DOJ investigation, suggesting that Trump's team should seek a court order to block the investigation.\n\n**FBI/DOJ launches criminal investigation and issues subpoenas**\n\n### May 2022 subpoena\n\nIn May 2022, the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a subpoena to Trump's representatives, requesting that they turn over documents related to the missing presidential records.\n\n### June 2022 subpoena\n\nIn June 2022, the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a second subpoena to Trump's representatives, requesting that they turn over additional documents related to the missing presidential records.\n\n**FBI/DOJ obtains search warrant from federal court**\n\nIn July 2022, a federal court issued a search warrant to the FBI, authorizing the agency to search Mar-a-Lago for classified documents and other evidence related to the investigation.\n\n**Search of Mar-a-Lago**\n\nThe FBI search of Mar-a-Lago was conducted on August 8, 2022, and lasted for several hours. During the search, the FBI seized various documents and other materials, including classified documents and presidential records.\n\n**Search of other Trump properties**\n\nIn addition to Mar-a-Lago, the FBI also searched other Trump properties, including Trump Tower in New York and Trump National Doral in Miami.\n\n**Release of search warrant, property receipt, and affidavit**\n\nOn August 11, 2022, the Department of Justice (DOJ) released the search warrant, property receipt, and affidavit executed on Mar-a-Lago. The documents revealed that the FBI had seized numerous documents and other materials, including classified documents and presidential records.\n\n### Seized materials\n\nThe seized materials included:\n\n* 11 sets of classified documents\n* 1 set of documents marked as \"top secret\"\n* 1 set of documents marked as \"sensitive compartmented information\"\n* 1 set of documents marked as \"confidential\"\n* Various other documents and materials\n\n### Missing materials\n\nThe FBI also discovered that some materials were missing from Mar-a-Lago, including:\n\n* 1 set of classified documents\n* 1 set of documents marked as \"top secret\"\n* 1 set of documents marked as \"sensitive compartmented information\"\n\n**Motions to release search warrant affidavit**\n\nIn September 2022, Trump's attorneys filed a motion to release the search warrant affidavit, arguing that the document was publicly available and should be disclosed.\n\n**Release of redacted search warrant affidavit**\n\nOn November 2, 2022, the Department of Justice (DOJ) released a redacted version of the search warrant affidavit, which revealed additional details about the investigation and the search of Mar-a-Lago.\n\n**Release of detailed property list**\n\nOn November 10, 2022, the Department of Justice (DOJ) released a detailed property list of the materials seized during the search of Mar-a-Lago, which included:\n\n* 184 classified documents\n* 67 sets of documents marked as \"confidential\"\n* 25 sets of documents marked as \"sensitive compartmented information\"\n* 3 sets of documents marked as \"top secret\"\n\n**Trump v. United States**\n\nIn November 2022, Trump filed a lawsuit against the United States, alleging that the search warrant and seizure of materials were unconstitutional and that the government had engaged in \"unlawful and outrageous conduct.\"\n\n**Special counsel investigation**\n\nIn November 2022, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel to investigate the handling of classified documents and other evidence related to the Trump administration.\n\n### Indictment\n\nOn June 8, 2023, a grand jury indicted Trump on charges related to the handling of classified documents, making him the first former President of the United States to be indicted.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### Congress\n\nCongressional leaders from both parties released statements reacting to the

It played a pivotal role in the early history of the region, serving as a hub for trade, commerce, and governance.\n\n# History\n\n## Establishment (1621–1660)\n\nThe first fort was constructed by the Dutch in 1621, shortly after their arrival in the New World. The Dutch West India Company, a chartered trading company, established a small settlement on Manhattan Island, which they named New Amsterdam. The fort was initially a wooden palisade with a few buildings, but it was upgraded and expanded over time. The fortification was designed to protect the settlers from Native American raids and potential attacks from other European powers.\n\nIn the early years, the fort was the center of the Dutch colony, serving as a commercial hub, a military stronghold, and a administrative center. The Dutch West India Company maintained control over the fort and the surrounding area, which included the present-day boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx.\n\n## English Rule (1664–1673)\n\nIn 1664, the English took control of New Amsterdam from the Dutch, and the fort was renamed Fort James. The English administration, led by Governor Richard Nicolls, made significant changes to the fort and the surrounding area. The English expanded the fort, adding new buildings and walls, and established a new system of governance. The English also introduced new laws and customs, which were often at odds with those of the Dutch.\n\nDuring this period, the fort played a key role in the English colonization of the region. The English used the fort as a base for their military campaigns against the Native American tribes in the area, and as a hub for trade and commerce.\n\n## Dutch Rule (1673–1674)\n\nIn 1673, the Dutch recaptured New Amsterdam from the English, and the fort was renamed Fort Amsterdam once again. The Dutch administration, led by Governor Anthony Colve, attempted to restore the pre-English order in the colony. However, their control was short-lived, as the English recaptured the colony in 1674.\n\n## English Rule (1674–1689)\n\nThe English resumed control of New Amsterdam in 1674, and the fort was once again renamed Fort James. During this period, the English continued to expand the fort and the surrounding area, establishing new settlements and trade routes.\n\nIn 1686, the English government established the Province of New York, which included the present-day boroughs of Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island. The fort was designated as the seat of government for the new province.\n\n## Colonist Rule (1689–1691)\n\nIn 1689, a group of colonists, led by Leisler's rebels, seized control of the fort and the government of the Province of New York. The rebels, who were mainly of Dutch and German descent, were dissatisfied with the English government and its policies. They established a new government, which was more tolerant of the rights of the colonists.\n\nHowever, their control was short-lived, as the English government responded with force. In 1691, the English army, led by Governor Henry Sloughter, recaptured the fort and the government of the province.\n\n## British Rule (1691–1775)\n\nThe English resumed control of the fort and the government of the Province of New York in 1691. During this period, the British continued to expand the fort and the surrounding area, establishing new settlements and trade routes.\n\nIn the 18th century, the fort played a key role in the British colonization of the region. The British used the fort as a base for their military campaigns against the French and their Native American allies in North America.\n\n## Prelude to the Revolution\n\nIn the years leading up to the American Revolution, the fort and the surrounding area played a key role in the growing tensions between the British government and the colonists. The colonists, who were mainly of Dutch and German descent, were dissatisfied with the British government and its policies. They demanded greater autonomy and representation in government.\n\n## Colonist Rule (1775–1776)\n\nIn 1775, a group of colonists, led by George Washington, seized control of the fort and the government of the Province of New York. The colonists, who were mainly of Dutch and German descent, were determined to assert their independence from the British government.\n\nHowever, their control was short-lived, as the British government responded with force. In 1776, the British army, led by General William Howe, recaptured the fort and the government of the province.\n\n## British Rule (1776–1783)\n\nThe British resumed control of the fort and the government of the Province of New York in 1776. During this period, the British continued to fight against the colonists, who were led by George Washington.\n\nIn 1781, the British government surrendered at Yorktown, Virginia, effectively ending the American Revolution. However, the British continued to maintain control of the fort and the surrounding area until 1783.\n\n## American Rule (1783–1790)\n\nIn 1783, the British government formally surrendered the fort and the surrounding area to the American government.
