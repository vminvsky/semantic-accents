With a population of over 9.5 million people, it is one of the world's largest cities. Seoul has a rich history dating back to the 14th century, and it has been the center of politics, economy, and culture in Korea for centuries.\n\n# Toponymy\n\nTraditionally, seoul (서울) has been a native Korean common noun simply meaning 'capital city.' The word seoul is believed to have descended from Seorabeol (서라벌; historically transliterated into the Hanja form 徐羅伐), which originally referred to Gyeongju, the capital of Silla.\n\n# History\n\nThere is evidence of human habitation in the area now corresponding to Seoul from 30,000 to 40,000 years before the present. Around 4,000 B.C., people of the area lived in huts with lowered floors called umjip (움집). There is evidence of the consumption of cooked grain and fish by 3,000 B.C. Around 1,500 B.C., communities began transitioning into the Bronze Age and farming at scale.\n\n## Prehistory\n\nThere is evidence of human habitation in the area now corresponding to Seoul from 30,000 to 40,000 years before the present. Around 4,000 B.C., people of the area lived in huts with lowered floors called umjip (움집). There is evidence of the consumption of cooked grain and fish by 3,000 B.C. Around 1,500 B.C., communities began transitioning into the Bronze Age and farming at scale.\n\n## Baekje, Silla, and Goryeo periods\n\nSeoul is first recorded as Wiryeseong, the capital of Baekje (founded in 18 BC) in the northeastern area of modern Seoul. There are several city walls remaining in the area that date from this time. Pungnaptoseong, an earthen wall located southeast Seoul, is widely believed to have been at the main Wiryeseong site. As the Three Kingdoms competed for this strategic region, control passed from Baekje to Goguryeo in the 5th century.\n\n## Joseon dynasty\n\nSeoul became the planned capital of Korea by Yi Seong-gye, the founding father of the Joseon dynasty. After enthroning himself as King at the capital of old Goryeo in 1392, Yi Seong-gye changed the name of his Kingdom from Goryeo to Joseon in 1393 and began his search for a place for a new capital. After several governmental debates, Yi Seong-gye chose Hanyang (Sindo) instead of Muak in September 1394. As Joseon's new capital, Hanyang was planned as a geographic embodiment of Korean Confucianism. Construction of the city began in October 1394. During its early construction stages, some major palaces, including Gyeongbokgung, were finished in 1395. The Fortress Wall surrounding Hanyang was partially finished around 1396.\n\n## Korean Empire\n\nAfter Gojong's proclamation of Korea as the Korean Empire in 1897, Seoul was temporarily called Hwangseong (황성; 皇城; lit. the imperial city). Much of modern development around this era was propelled by trade with foreign countries like France and the United States. For example, the Seoul Electric Company, Seoul Electric Trolley Company, and Seoul Fresh Spring Water Company were all joint Korean–U.S owned enterprises.\n\n## Japanese annexation of Korea\n\nAfter the annexation treaty in 1910, Japan annexed Korea and renamed the city Gyeongseong (\"Kyongsong\" in Korean and \"Keijō\" in Japanese). The city saw significant transformation under Japanese colonial rule. Imperial Japan removed the city walls, paved roads, and built Western-style buildings.\n\n## Contemporary history\n\nIn 1945, following the liberation from Japanese colonial rule, the American military assumed control of Korea, including its capital city, then referred to as Kyeongseongbu in line with Japanese nomenclature. The U.S military government published the Charter of the City of Seoul in the official gazette on October 10 of the following year. The charter declared Seoul as the name of the city and established it as a municipal corporation. Seoul's status as a municipal corporation mirrored the independent cities in the United States that do not belong to any county, and Seoul was established as an independent administrative unit, separate from the existing provinces. The Korean version of the Charter translated \"municipal corporation\" as \"special free city\" (특별자유시; 特別自由市), which later became special metropolitan city (or special metropolitan city; 특별시) in the Local Autonomy Act of 1949.\n\n# Geography\n\nSeoul is in the northwest of South Korea. Seoul proper comprises 605.25 km² (233.69 sq mi), with a radius of approximately 15 km (9 mi), roughly bisected into northern and southern halves by the Han River. The river is no longer actively used for navigation, because its estuary is located at the borders of the two Koreas, with civilian entry barred. There are four main mountains in central Seoul: Bugaksan, Inwangsan, Naksan and Namsan. The Seoul Fortress Wall, which historically bounded the city, goes over these mountains. The city is bordered by eight mountains, as well as the more level lands of the Han River plain and western areas.\n\n## Parks\n\nSeoul has a large quantity of parks. One of the most famous parks is Namsan Park, which offers recreational hiking and views of the downtown Seoul skyline, especially via its N Seoul Tower. Seoul Olympic Park, located in Songpa District and built to host the 1988 Summer Olympics, is the largest park. The areas near the stream Tancheon are popular for exercise. Cheonggyecheon also has spaces for recreation. In 2017 the Seoullo 7017 Skypark opened, spanning diagonally overtop Seoul Station.\n\n## Air quality\n\nAir pollution is a major issue in Seoul. According to the 2016 World Health Organization Global Urban Ambient Air Pollution Database, the annual average PM2.5 concentration in 2014 was 24 micrograms per cubic meter (1.0×10−5 gr/cu ft), which is 2.4 times higher than that recommended by the WHO Air Quality Guidelines for the annual mean PM2.5. The Seoul Metropolitan Government monitors and publicly shares real-time air quality data.\n\n## Climate\n\nSeoul has a humid continental (Köppen: Dwa) or humid subtropical climate (Cwa, by −3 °C or 26.6 °F isotherm), influenced by the monsoons; there is great variation in temperature and precipitation throughout the year. Summers are hot and humid, with the East Asian monsoon taking place from June until September. August, the hottest month, has average high and low temperatures of 30.0 and 22.9 °C (86 and 73 °F) with higher temperatures possible. Heat index values can surpass 40 °C (104.0 °F) at the height of summer. Winters are usually cold to freezing with average January high and low temperatures of 2.1 and −5.5 °C (35.8 and 22.1 °F), and are generally much drier than summers, with an average of 24.9 days of snow annually. Sometimes, temperatures drop dramatically to below −10 °C (14 °F), and on some occasions as low as −15 °C (5 °F) in the mid winter period of January and February. Temperatures below −20 °C (−4 °F) have been recorded.\n\n# Government\n\nThe Seoul Metropolitan Government is the local government for Seoul, and is responsible for the administration and provision of various services to the city, including correctional institutions, education, libraries, public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply, and welfare services. It is headed by a mayor and three vice mayors, and is divided into 25 autonomous districts and 522 administrative neighborhoods.\n\n## Administrative districts\n\nSeoul is divided into 25 \"gu\" (구; 區) (district). The gu vary greatly in area (from 10 to 47 km² or 3.9 to 18.1 sq mi) and population (from fewer than 140,000 to 630,000). Songpa has the most people, while Seocho has the largest area. The government of each gu handles many of the functions that are handled by city governments in other jurisdictions. Each gu is divided into \"dong\" (동; 洞), or neighborhoods. Some gu have only a few dongs while others like Jongno District have a very large number of distinct neighborhoods. Seoul has 423 administrative dongs (행정동) in total.\n\n# Demographics\n\nSeoul proper is noted for its population density, which is almost twice that of New York City and eight times greater than Rome. Its metropolitan area was the most densely populated among OECD countries in Asia in 2012, and second worldwide after that of Paris. As of 2015, the population was 9.86 million, in 2012, it was 10.44 million. As of 2021, the population is 9.59 million. As of the end of June 2011, 10.29 million Republic of Korea citizens lived in the city. This was a 0.24% decrease from the end of 2010. The population of Seoul has been dropping since the early 1990s, the reasons being the high costs of living, urban sprawling to Gyeonggi region's satellite bed cities and an aging population.\n\n## Education\n\nCompulsory education lasts from grade 1–9 (six years of elementary school and three years of middle school). Students spend six years in elementary school, three years in middle school, and three years in high school. Secondary schools generally require students to wear uniforms. There is an exit exam for graduating from high school and many students proceeding to the university level are required to take the College Scholastic Ability Test that is held every November. Although there is a test for non-high school graduates, called school qualification exam, most Koreans take the test.\n\n## Economy\n\nSeoul is the business and financial hub of South Korea. Although it accounts for only 0.6 percent of the nation's land area, 48.3 percent of South Korea's bank deposits were held in Seoul in 2003. In 2012, the city generated 23 percent of the country's GDP overall. In 2008, the Worldwide Centers of Commerce Index ranked Seoul No.9. The Global Financial Centres Index in 2015 listed Seoul as the 6th financially most competitive city in the world. The Economist Intelligence Unit ranked Seoul 15th in the list of \"Overall 2025 City Competitiveness\" regarding future competitiveness of cities.\n\n## Manufacturing\n\nThe traditional, labor-intensive manufacturing industries have been continuously replaced by information technology, electronics and assembly-type of industries. However, food and beverage production, as well as printing and publishing remained among the core industries. Major manufacturers are headquartered in the city, including Samsung, LG, Hyundai, Kia and SK. Notable food and beverage companies include Jinro, whose soju is the most sold alcoholic drink in the world, beating out Smirnoff vodka. Top selling beer producers Hite (merged with Jinro) and Oriental Brewery. It also hosts food giants like Seoul Dairy Cooperative, Nongshim Group, Ottogi, CJ, Orion, Maeil Holdings, Namyang Dairy Products and Lotte.\n\n## Business and finance\n\nAccording to the Global Financial Centres Index report released in 2024, Seoul ranked 10th. The city ranked 13th in business environment and financial sector development, seventh in human capital, 10th in infrastructure and 12th in reputation.\n\n## Commerce\n\nThe largest wholesale and retail market in South Korea, the Dongdaemun Market, is located in Seoul. Myeongdong is a shopping and entertainment area in downtown Seoul with mid- to high-end stores, fashion boutiques and international brand outlets.

{"title": "Deathloop", "content": "\nGameplay\nDeathloop placed a large emphasis on player's choices and freedom According to Bakaba, the game \" [entrusts] the player with a lot of ownership of their own enjoyment\" [23] As an immersive sim, systems were placed in the game to establish consistent gameplay rules, and players were encouraged to plan their approach based on their understanding of these rules and to see if the game responded accordingly According to level designer Dana Nightingale, Deathloop was designed for \"deliberate\" play and discourages random player actions [24] Comparatively, the game is more non-linear than Dishonored Because players repeatedly revisit locations, the developers avoided adding chokepoints in the game's map, which funnels the player in a particular direction Instead, developers attempted to build spaces that are \"believable\", where players need not to engage with scripted confrontations or interactions with other characters, giving players more freedom [23] Because Deathloop deviates from Arkane's previous games, Colt's powers were designed to be similar to those in Dishonored to maintain a level of familiarity to fans of Arkane's past works [25] Bakaba described Deathloop's gameplay as \"Dishonored with guns\";

The 2005 and 2006 events were held on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, while the 2022 and 2023 events were held on the Saturday after Thanksgiving. The 1997 event was notorious as it featured the Montreal Screwjob. Survivor Series was going to be discontinued and rebranded in 2010, but following fan outcry, the company decided to continue with the event. Survivor Series became the second longest running PPV event in history (behind WrestleMania), and is also regarded as one of the \"Big Four\" pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam, the promotion's original four annual events and their four biggest events of the year. From 1993 to 2002, it was considered one of the \"Big Five\", including King of the Ring, but that PPV event was discontinued after 2002. In August 2021, Money in the Bank became recognized as one of the \"Big Five\".\n\n**Brand Competition (2016-2021)**\n\nDuring the first brand extension period (2002-2011), there were only a few Survivor Series matches that were held between wrestlers of the two brands (e.g., Team Raw vs Team SmackDown), but it was not the focus of the event. However, with the return of the brand split in 2016, Survivor Series took on the theme of direct competition between the Raw and SmackDown brands for brand supremacy, similar to the former Bragging Rights events held during the first brand split in 2009 and 2010. In addition to traditional Survivor Series matches pitting the men and women from the two brands against each (2016 and 2018 also featured matches with the brands' tag teams going against each other), there were interpromotional matches that featured the brands' champions against each other in non-title matches (e.g., the Raw Women's Champion vs the SmackDown Women's Champion).\n\n**WarGames (2022-present)**\n\nOn September 19, 2022, WWE executive Triple H announced that the 2022 Survivor Series would not be based on the brand supremacy concept. Additionally, he announced that the event would feature two WarGames matches, one each for the men and women, marking the first time for a main roster WWE event to feature the match. The 2022 event was in turn renamed as Survivor Series: WarGames, and it was also the first Survivor Series held on a Saturday. The NXT brand previously held an annual WarGames event from 2017 to 2021. With the WarGames match moving to the main roster for Survivor Series, this subsequently ended NXT's WarGames event, which was replaced by Deadline.\n\n**Survivor Series Match**\n\nThe event is traditionally characterized by having the Survivor Series match, which is a type of tag team elimination match that typically features two teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. In a Survivor Series match, each member of a team must be eliminated to win. The name of the match stems from this stipulation, as the winners are the \"survivors\", and in some cases, there has been only one survivor. There have sometimes been an additional stipulation placed on the Survivor Series match, such as members of the losing team being (kayfabe) fired. While typically contested between two teams, the 2019 event had three teams against each other in three-way Survivor Series matches.\n\n**Events**\n\nSurvivor Series has been held annually since 1987, with a few exceptions. The event has undergone several changes over the years, including a shift from a Thanksgiving Day/Thanksgiving Eve event to a Sunday event before Thanksgiving. In 2022, the event was held on a Saturday and featured two WarGames matches. The event has also undergone a change in format, with the return of the brand split in 2016 and the introduction of WarGames matches. The Survivor Series match has remained a staple of the event, with teams of wrestlers competing in a type of tag team elimination match.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Survivor_Series\" following this outline:\n\n\nOrigins and changes\nThe first Survivor Series, held in 1987, [1] came on the heels of the success of WrestleMania III, as the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) began to see the lucrative potential of the pay-per-view (PPV) market The first event capitalized on the big time feud between André the Giant and Hulk Hogan, who wrestled each other at WrestleMania III Survivor Series was originally created to counter WCW's Starrcade The first eight Survivor Series events took place on either Thanksgiving Day (1987–1990) or Thanksgiving Eve (1991–1994) Beginning with the 1995 event, Survivor Series was held on various Sundays before Thanksgiving The 2005 and 2006 events were held on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, while the 2022 and 2023 events were held on the Saturday after Thanksgiving The 1997 event was notorious as it featured the Montreal Screwjob [2] Survivor Series was going to be discontinued and rebranded in 2010, [3] [4] but following fan outcry, the company decided to continue with the event [5] Survivor Series became the second longest running PPV event in history (behind WrestleMania), [6] and is also regarded as one of the \"Big Four\" pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam, the promotion's original four annual events and their four biggest events of the year [7] From 1993 to 2002, it was considered one of the \"Big Five\", including King of the Ring, but that PPV event was discontinued after 2002 [8]  In August 2021, Money in the Bank became recognized as one of the \"Big Five\" [9] [10]\n\n\nBrand competition (2016–2021)\nDuring the first brand extension period (2002–2011), there were only a few Survivor Series matches that were held between wrestlers of the two brands (e.g., Team Raw vs Team SmackDown), but it was not the focus of the event However, with the return of the brand split in 2016, Survivor Series took on the theme of direct competition between the Raw and SmackDown brands for brand supremacy, similar to the former Bragging Rights events held during the first brand split in 2009 and 2010 [27] [28] [29] In addition to traditional Survivor Series matches pitting the men and women from the two brands against each (2016 and 2018 also featured matches with the brands' tag teams going against each other), there were interpromotional matches that featured the brands' champions against each other in non-title matches (e.g., the Raw Women's Champion vs the SmackDown Women's Champion) [30]\n\n\nWarGames (2022–present)\nOn September 19, 2022, WWE executive Triple H announced that the 2022 Survivor Series would not be based on the brand supremacy concept Additionally, he announced that the event would feature two WarGames matches, one each for the men and women, marking the first time for a main roster WWE event to feature the match The 2022 event was in turn renamed as Survivor Series: WarGames, and it was also the first Survivor Series held on a Saturday [42] The NXT brand previously held an annual WarGames event from 2017 to 2021 With the WarGames match moving to the main roster for Survivor Series, this subsequently ended NXT's WarGames event, which was replaced by Deadline [43]\n\n\nSurvivor Series match\nThe event is traditionally characterized by having the Survivor Series match, which is a type of tag team elimination match that typically features two teams of four or five wrestlers against each other In a Survivor Series match, each member of a team must be eliminated to win The name of the match stems from this stipulation, as the winners are the \"survivors\", and in some cases, there has been only one survivor There have sometimes been an additional stipulation placed on the Survivor Series match, such as members of the losing team being (kayfabe) fired While typically contested between two teams, the 2019 event had three teams against each other in three-way Survivor Series matches [30]\n\n\nEvents\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Typhoon_Yagi", "content": "\nMeteorological history\nThe origins of Typhoon Yagi can be traced back to August 30, when the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) reported that a low-pressure area had formed approximately 540 km (330 mi) northwest of Palau [1] [2] The broad low-pressure area began to organise and developed into a tropical depression on August 31 [3] Deep convection activity became concentrated around a circulation centre, which was in a favourable environment with excellent equatorward and poleward outflow and warm sea surface temperatures of 29–30 °C (84–86 °F) [4] On September 1, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) declared the system a tropical depression and named it Enteng, as it formed within the Philippine Area of Responsibility [5] At 03:00 UTC that day, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert due to its low-level circulation centre becoming well-defined with formative banding in its northern quadrants [6] A few hours later, the system was classified as tropical depression 12W, exhibiting a rapidly consolidating low-level circulation, a compact central dense overcast (CDO), and deep convective banding over the western semicircle; it then intensified into a tropical storm and was named Yagi by the JMA [7] [8]\n\n\nPreparations\nAs the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) started to track Yagi (known as \"Enteng\" in the Philippines) as a tropical depression on September 1, Tropical Cyclone Wind Signal No 1 was raised in Albay; Biliran; Burias Island; Eastern Samar; Masbate; Northern Samar; Sorsogon; Ticao Island; northeastern portion of Leyte; eastern portions of Cagayan and Isabela; southern portions of Quirino and Nueva Vizcaya; and northern Quezon [41] Shortly after Yagi became a tropical storm, the PAGASA raised Signal No 2 for the northeastern portion of Camarines Sur, the entire province of Abra; Apayao; Babuyan Islands; Cagayan; Ilocos Norte; Ifugao; Isabela; Kalinga; Mountain Province; Polillo Islands; Quirino, and northern portions of Aurora; Camarines Norte; Ilocos Sur; and Nueva Vizcaya At their next bulletin, the agency also added Benguet; La Union; Nueva Ecija; Rizal; Laguna; Marinduque, some parts of Batangas; Bulacan; Pampanga; and Pangasinan, as well as Metro Manila to Signal No 1 because of gusty winds and heavy rains caused by the storm [42] By September 4, most TCWS signals were lowered by the PAGASA as the storm left the Philippine Area of Responsibility [43]\n\n\nPhilippines\n\nYagi, combined with the effects of the southwest monsoon, resulted in 21 deaths, 22 injuries and 26 people missing [96] Yagi caused flooding in Metro Manila, and in the provinces of Bulacan, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Cavite, Laguna, Northern Samar, Pangasinan, and Rizal [97] [98] In Manila Bay, several ships ran aground off the coast of Navotas, while two others collided with each other, causing a fire on one of the vessels [99] A barge also ran aground in Rosario, Cavite [100] \n\nChina\nFour people were killed and 95 sustained injuries in Hainan after Yagi made landfall on the island [86] Power outages affecting about 830,000 households [27] [77] and downed trees were also reported [110] By September 7, 1.2 million people were still left without power [111] Nearly all of Hainan experienced rainfall exceeding 200 millimetres (7.9 in), with Haikou recording about 525 millimetres (20.7 in) of rain [111] Chinese authorities estimated that economic losses in Hainan reached CN¥78.6 billion (US$12.19 billion), while infrastructure damages totaled ¥728 million (US$112.87 million), resulting in total damages amounting to ¥79.33 billion (US$12.3 billion) [112] [113] Around 57,000 houses were destroyed or damaged on the island [114]\n\n\nHong Kong\nOn September 3, the Hong Kong Observatory issued a

Yagi**\n\nTyphoon Yagi was a powerful tropical cyclone that caused widespread damage and flooding in several countries in Southeast Asia in September 2023. The storm formed in the western Pacific Ocean and made landfall in the Philippines, China, Hong Kong, Macau, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, and Myanmar, resulting in significant loss of life and property.\n\n**Meteorological History**\n\nThe origins of Typhoon Yagi can be traced back to August 30, when the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) reported that a low-pressure area had formed approximately 540 km (330 mi) northwest of Palau. The broad low-pressure area began to organize and developed into a tropical depression on August 31. Deep convection activity became concentrated around a circulation center, which was in a favorable environment with excellent equatorward and poleward outflow and warm sea surface temperatures of 29–30°C (84–86°F). On September 1, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) declared the system a tropical depression and named it Enteng, as it formed within the Philippine Area of Responsibility. At 03:00 UTC that day, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert due to its low-level circulation center becoming well-defined with formative banding in its northern quadrants. A few hours later, the system was classified as tropical depression 12W, exhibiting a rapidly consolidating low-level circulation, a compact central dense overcast (CDO), and deep convective banding over the western semicircle; it then intensified into a tropical storm and was named Yagi by the JMA.\n\n**Preparations**\n\nAs the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) started to track Yagi (known as \"Enteng\" in the Philippines) as a tropical depression on September 1, Tropical Cyclone Wind Signal No 1 was raised in Albay; Biliran; Burias Island; Eastern Samar; Masbate; Northern Samar; Sorsogon; Ticao Island; northeastern portion of Leyte; eastern portions of Cagayan and Isabela; southern portions of Quirino and Nueva Vizcaya; and northern Quezon. Shortly after Yagi became a tropical storm, the PAGASA raised Signal No 2 for the northeastern portion of Camarines Sur, the entire province of Abra; Apayao; Babuyan Islands; Cagayan; Ilocos Norte; Ifugao; Isabela; Kalinga; Mountain Province; Polillo Islands; Quirino, and northern portions of Aurora; Camarines Norte; Ilocos Sur; and Nueva Vizcaya. At their next bulletin, the agency also added Benguet; La Union; Nueva Ecija; Rizal; Laguna; Marinduque, some parts of Batangas; Bulacan; Pampanga; and Pangasinan, as well as Metro Manila to Signal No 1 because of gusty winds and heavy rains caused by the storm. By September 4, most TCWS signals were lowered by the PAGASA as the storm left the Philippine Area of Responsibility.\n\n**Philippines**\n\nYagi, combined with the effects of the southwest monsoon, resulted in 21 deaths, 22 injuries, and 26 people missing. Yagi caused flooding in Metro Manila, and in the provinces of Bulacan, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Cavite, Laguna, Northern Samar, Pangasinan, and Rizal. In Manila Bay, several ships ran aground off the coast of Navotas, while two others collided with each other, causing a fire on one of the vessels. A barge also ran aground in Rosario, Cavite.\n\n**China**\n\nFour people were killed and 95 sustained injuries in Hainan after Yagi made landfall on the island. Power outages affecting about 830,000 households and downed trees were also reported. By September 7, 1.2 million people were still left without power. Nearly all of Hainan experienced rainfall exceeding 200 millimeters (7.9 in), with Haikou recording about 525 millimeters (20.7 in) of rain. Chinese authorities estimated that economic losses in Hainan reached CN¥78.6 billion (US$12.19 billion), while infrastructure damages totaled ¥728 million (US$112.87 million), resulting in total damages amounting to ¥79.33 billion (US$12.3 billion). Around 57,000 houses were destroyed or damaged on the island.\n\n**Hong Kong and Macau**\n\nIn Hong Kong, Yagi injured nine people and displaced 270. There were 79 reports of fallen trees. A waterspout was reported in the eastern waters of the territory on September 6. Two people were injured and ten others were displaced in Macau.\n\n**Vietnam**\n\nPrior to Yagi's landfall on the country, the storm killed one person and uprooted trees in Ho Chi Minh City on September 4. Some roofs were blown off along with some electric poles in Bình Dương province, causing power outages in some areas on September 4. On September 6, the storm uprooted trees, roofs, and signboards across the country, resulting in three deaths and seven injuries.\n\n**Laos**\n\nYagi brought heavy rainfall that caused flooding across Laos, killing seven people and damaging 298 houses, 252 roads, 77 schools, and 11 hospitals. In Luang Namtha Province, heavy rains forced the closure of Luang Namtha Airport. Three hundred people were evacuated from 17 villages across the province. Flooding also occurred in Luang Prabang, Oudomxay, and Bokeo Provinces, as well as in parts of Vientiane Prefecture.\n\n**Thailand**\n\nIn Thailand, 46 people were killed, including 36 in Chiang Rai province and six in Chiang Mai province. Across the country, 34,000 households were damaged, including 11,772 in Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya, 10,499 in Chiang Mai, 2,928 in Chiang Rai, 720 in Tak, 576 in Phitsanulok, 361 in Sukhothai, and 343 in Ang Thong. Around 9,000 families were affected. In Chiang Rai, 108 people were injured and damage occurred across 46 villages in five districts. Six landslides occurred in Mae Ai district, one of which killed six people and injured three others. Flooding also damaged 1,191 homes and 92 shops across five villages in Mae Sai district. Chiang Rai International Airport was closed due to flooding of access roads. Parts of Bueng Khan and Nong Khai provinces were inundated in up to 2 meters (6 ft 7 in) of water after the Mekong River burst its banks.\n\n**Myanmar**\n\nIn Myanmar, the remnants of Yagi caused extensive flooding and landslides, which were considered the worst to hit central Myanmar in 60 years. The country's junta confirmed 433 deaths, 79 missing, and 48 injuries. Radio Free Asia put the number of missing at 200. At least 320,000 people were displaced, while 24 bridges, 1,040 schools, 129 office buildings, five dams, 386 religious buildings, 14 electrical transformers, 456 lampposts, and more than 158,373 houses were damaged by floods; 2,116 additional houses were destroyed. An additional 150,000 homes and 260,000 hectares (640,000 acres) of crops were flooded, while nearly 130,000 animals also died. Heavy rains also caused parts of several pagodas at the ancient UNESCO World Heritage site of Bagan to collapse. Parts of the Yangon–Mandalay Railway were flooded, resulting in the suspension of journeys. In Mandalay Region, 53,972 people were affected.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nPhilippine President Bongbong Marcos conducted aerial inspections of La Mesa Dam, Marikina, and Antipolo, announcing that over ₱16 million (US$324,873.1) in humanitarian aid has been allocated to the hardest-hit areas. The Department of Social Welfare and Development reported that assistance and relief goods valued at ₱700 million (US$14.21 million) have been distributed to the impacted families. A state of calamity was declared in Camarines Sur, Naga City, and Allen, Northern Samar due to floods caused by Yagi.\n\n**International Aid and Assistance**\n\nIn response to the severe effects of Typhoon Yagi, the United States pledged US$1 million in immediate humanitarian aid to Vietnam, while the Australian government allocated AUD$3 million (US$2 million) for emergency assistance and crucial services to Vietnam. Australia sent emergency relief supplies aboard a C-17 Globemaster, which included essential provisions for families such as shelter and hygiene kits. The Red Cross Society of China also donated 100,000 USD to the Red Cross Society of Vietnam. The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation committed US$1.17 million, sending six specialists to aid in the recovery efforts to Vietnam. The European Union has provided €2.2 million (US$2.6 million) in humanitarian aid, with €1.2 million (US$1.42 million) directed to Myanmar, €650,000 (US$768,755) to Vietnam, €200,000 (US$236,540) to the Philippines, and €150,000 (US$177,405) to Laos, to support those most affected by Typhoon Yagi. The United Kingdom announced £1 million of humanitarian assistance to Vietnam. The Japanese government, via the Japan International Cooperation Agency, has dispatched emergency supplies to assist Vietnam in recovering from recent storm damage, while South Korea donated US$2 million. Indian billionaire businessman Gautam Adani has committed to donating US$1 million to help Vietnam recover from the damage caused by Typhoon Yagi.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article

mistress [31]\n\n\nBeginning\nIn his Book of Memoranda, begun in 1855, Dickens wrote names for possible characters: Magwitch, Provis, Clarriker, Compey, Pumblechook, Orlick, Gargery, Wopsle, Skiffins, some of which became familiar in Great Expectations There is also a reference to a \"knowing man\", a possible sketch of Bentley Drummle [32] Another evokes a house full of \"Toadies and Humbugs\", foreshadowing the visitors to Satis House in chapter 11 [32] [33] Margaret Cardwell discovered the \"premonition\" of Great Expectations from a 25 September 1855 letter from Dickens to W H Wills, in which Dickens speaks of recycling an \"odd idea\" from the Christmas special \"A House to Let\" and \"the pivot round which my next book shall revolve\" [34] [35] The \"odd idea\" concerns an individual who \"retires to an old lonely house…resolved to shut out the world and hold no communion with it\" [34]\n\n\nPublication in All the Year Round\nDickens was pleased with the idea, calling it \"such a very fine, new and grotesque idea\" in a letter to Forster [11] He planned to write \"a little piece\", a \"grotesque tragi-comic conception\", about a young hero who befriends an escaped convict, who then makes a fortune in Australia and anonymously bequeaths his property to the hero In the end, the hero loses the money because it is forfeited to the Crown In his biography of Dickens, Forster wrote that in the early idea \"was the germ of Pip and Magwitch, which at first he intended to make the groundwork of a tale in the old twenty-number form\" [37] Dickens presented the relationship between Pip and Magwitch pivotal to Great Expectations but without Miss Havisham, Estella, or other characters he later created.\n\n\nRevised ending\nFollowing comments by Edward Bulwer-Lytton that the ending was too sad, Dickens rewrote it prior to publication The ending set aside by Dickens has Pip, who is still single, briefly see Estella in London; after becoming Bentley Drummle's widow, she has remarried [39] [45] It appealed to Dickens due to its originality: \" [the] winding up will be away from all such things as they conventionally go\" [39] [46] Dickens revised the ending for publication so that Pip meets Estella in the ruins of Satis House, she is a widow and he is single His changes at the conclusion of the novel did not quite end either with the final weekly part or the first bound edition, because Dickens further changed the last sentence in the amended 1868 version from \"I could see the shadow of no parting from her\" [39] to \"I saw no shadow of another parting from her\" [47] As Pip uses litotes, \"no shadow of another parting\", it is ambiguous whether Pip and Estella marry or Pip remains single Angus Calder, writing for an edition in the Penguin English Library, believed the less definite phrasing of the amended 1868 version perhaps hinted at a buried meaning: 'at this happy moment, I did not see the shadow of our subsequent parting looming over us.'

identifies four American editions in 1861 and sees the proliferation of publications in Europe and across the Atlantic as \"extraordinary testimony\" to Great Expectations's popularity [62] Chapman and Hall published the first edition in three volumes in 1861, [2] [3] [4] five subsequent reprints between 6 July and 30 October, and a one-volume edition in 1862 The \"bargain\" edition was published in 1862, the Library Edition in 1864, and the Charles Dickens edition in 1868 To this list, Paul Schlicke adds \"two meticulous scholarly editions\", one Clarendon Press published in 1993 with an introduction by Margaret Cardwell [63] and another with an introduction by Edgar Rosenberg, published by Norton in 1999 [53] The novel was published with one ending (visible in the four online editions listed in the External links at the end of this article) In some 20th century editions, the novel ends as originally published in 1867, and in an afterword, the ending Dickens did not publish, along with a brief story of how a friend persuaded him to a happier ending for Pip, is presented to the reader (for example, 1987 audio edition by Recorded Books [64]).\n\n\nFirst edition publication schedule\nRobert L Patten estimates that All the Year Round sold 100,000 copies of Great Expectations each week, and Mudie, the largest circulating library, which purchased about 1,400 copies, stated that at least 30 people read each copy [70] Aside from the dramatic plot, the Dickensian humour also appealed to readers Dickens wrote to Forster in October 1860 that \"You will not have to complain of the want of humour as in the Tale of Two Cities,\" [71] an opinion Forster supports, finding that \"Dickens's humour, not less than his creative power, was at its best in this book\" [37] [72] Moreover, according to Paul Schlicke, readers found the best of Dickens's older and newer writing styles [6]\n\n\nReception\nRobert L Patten estimates that All the Year Round sold

an opinion Forster supports, finding that \"Dickens's humour, not less than his creative power, was at its best in this book\" [37] [72] Moreover, according to Paul Schlicke, readers found the best of Dickens's older and newer writing styles [6]\n\n\nBackground\nGreat Expectations's single most obvious literary predecessor is Dickens's earlier first-person protagonist-narrated David Copperfield The two novels trace the psychological and moral development of a young boy to maturity, his transition from a rural environment to the London metropolis, the vicissitudes of his emotional development, and the exhibition of his hopes and youthful dreams and their metamorphosis, through a rich and complex first person narrative [77] Dickens was conscious of this similarity and, before undertaking his new manuscript, reread David Copperfield to avoid repetition [41]\n\n\nStructure\nThe narrative structure of Great Expectations is influenced by the fact that it was first published as weekly episodes in a periodical This required short chapters, centred on a single subject, and an almost mathematical structure [91]\n\n\nChronology\nPip's story is told in three stages: his childhood and early youth in Kent, where he dreams of rising above his humble station; his time in London after receiving \"great expectations\"; and then finally his disillusionment on discovering the source of his fortune, followed by his slow realisation of the vanity of his false values [92] These three stages are further divided into twelve parts of equal length This symmetry contributes to the impression of completion, which has often been commented on George Gissing, for example, when comparing Joe Gargery and Dan'l Peggotty (from David Copperfield), preferred the former, because he is a stronger character, who lives \"in a world, not of melodrama, but of everyday cause and effect\" [93] G B Shaw also commented on the novel's structure, describing it as \"compactly perfect\", and Algernon Swinburne stated, \"The defects in it are as nearly imperceptible as spots on the sun or shadow on a sunlit sea\" [94] [95] A contributing factor is \"the briskness of the narrative tone\" [96]\n\n\nNarrative flow\nFurther, beyond the chronological sequences and the weaving of several storylines into a tight plot, the sentimental setting and morality of the characters also create a pattern [97] The narrative structure of Great Expectations has two main elements: firstly that of \"foster parents\", Miss Havisham, Magwitch, and Joe, and secondly that of \"young people\", Estella, Pip and Biddy There is a further organizing element that can be labelled \"Dangerous Lovers\", which includes Compeyson, Bentley Drummle and Orlick Pip is the centre of this web of love, rejection and hatred Dickens contrasts this \"dangerous love\" with the relationship of Biddy and Joe, which grows from friendship to marriage.\n\n\nOrlick as Pip's double\nJulian Moynahan argues that the reader can better understand Pip's personality through analysing his relationship with Orlick, the criminal laborer who works at Joe Gargery's forge, than by looking at his relationship with Magwitch [100]\n\n\nPoint of view\nAlthough the novel is written in first person, the reader knows—as an essential prerequisite—that Great Expectations is not an autobiography but a novel, a work of fiction with plot and characters, featuring a narrator-protagonist In addition, Sylvère Monod notes that the treatment of the autobiography differs from David Copperfield, as Great Expectations does not draw from events in Dickens's life; \"at most some traces of a broad psychological and moral introspection can be found\" [103]\n\n\nStyle\nSome of the narrative devices that Dickens uses are caricature, comic speech mannerisms, intrigue, Gothic atmosphere, and a central character who gradually changes Earl Davis notes the close network of the structure and balance of contrasts, and praises the first-person narration for providing a simplicity that is appropriate for the story while avoiding melodrama Davis sees the symbolism attached to \"great expectations\" [vague] as reinforcing the novel's impact [108]\n\n\nCharacterisation\nCharacters then become themes in themselves, almost a Wagnerian leitmotiv, whose attitudes are repeated at each of their appearances as a musical phrase signaling their entry [109] For example, Jaggers constantly chews the same fingernail and washes his hands with scented soap, Orlick lurches his huge body, and Matthew Pocket always pulls at his hair Seen by the narrator, their attitude is mechanical, like that of an automaton: in the general scheme, the gesture betrays the uneasiness of the unaccomplished or exasperated man, his betrayed hope, his unsatisfied life [109] In this set, every character is orbited by \"satellite\" characters Wemmick is Jaggers's copy at work, but has placed in Walworth a secret garden, a castle with a family of an elderly father and a middle-aged fiancée, where he happily devours buttered bread [110] Wopsle plays the role of a poor Pip, kind of unsuccessful, but with his distraction, finally plays Hamlet in London, and Pumblechook does not hesitate to be the instrument of Pip's fortunes, then the mentor of his resurrection [111]\n\n\nCharacter leitmotiv\nCharacters then become themes in themselves, almost a Wagnerian leitmotiv, whose attitudes are repeated at each of their appearances as a musical phrase signaling their entry [109] For example, Jaggers constantly chews the same fingernail and

[110] Wopsle plays the role of a poor Pip, kind of unsuccessful, but with his distraction, finally plays Hamlet in London, and Pumblechook does not hesitate to be the instrument of Pip's fortunes, then the mentor of his resurrection [111]\n\n\nNarrative technique\nFor Pip's redemption to be credible, Trotter writes, the words of the main character must sound right [112] Christopher Ricks adds that Pip's frankness induces empathy, dramatics are avoided, [113] and his good actions are more eloquent than words Dickens's subtle narrative technique is also shown when he has Pip confess that he arranged Herbert's partnership with Clarriker, has Miss Havisham finally see the true character of her cousin Matthew Pocket, and has Pocket refuse the money she offers him [114] To this end, the narrative method subtly changes until, during the perilous journey down the Thames to remove Magwitch in chapter 54, the narrative point-of-view shifts from first person to the omniscient point of view For the first time, Ricks writes, the \"I\" ceases to be Pip's thoughts and switches to the other characters, the focus, at once, turns outward, and this is mirrored in the imagery of the black waters tormented waves and eddies, which heaves with an anguish that encompasses the entire universe, the passengers, the docks, the river, the night [114]\n\n\nRomantic and symbolic realism\nAccording to Paul Davis, while more realistic than its autobiographical predecessor written when novels like George Eliot's Adam Bede were in vogue, Great Expectations is in many ways a poetic work built around recurring symbolic images: the desolation of the marshes; the twilight; the chains of the house, the past, the painful memory; the fire; the hands that manipulate and control; the distant stars of desire; the river connecting past, present and future [115]\n\n\nGenre\nGreat Expectations contains a variety of literary genres, including the bildungsroman, gothic novel, crime novel, as well as comedy, melodrama and satire; and it belongs—like Wuthering Heights and the novels of Walter Scott—to the romance rather than realist tradition of the novel [116]\n\n\nBildungsroman\nComplex and multifaceted, Great Expectations is a Victorian bildungsroman, or initiatory tale, which focuses on a protagonist who matures over the course of the novel Great Expectations describes Pip's initial frustration upon leaving home, followed by a long and difficult period that is punctuated with conflicts between his desires and the values of established order During this time he re-evaluates his life and re-enters society on new foundations [85]\n\n\nComic novel\nGreat Expectations contains many comic scenes and eccentric personalities, integral parts to both the plot and the theme Among the notable comic episodes are Pip's Christmas dinner in chapter 4, Wopsle's Hamlet performance in chapter 31, and Wemmick's marriage in chapter 55 Many of the characters have eccentricities: Jaggers with his punctilious lawyerly ways; the contrariness of his clerk, Wemmick, at work advising Pip to invest in \"portable property\", while in private living in a cottage converted into a castle; and the reclusive Miss Havisham in her decaying mansion, wearing her tattered bridal robes [118]\n\n\nCrime fiction\nGreat Expectations incorporates elements of the new genre of crime fiction, which Dickens had already used in Oliver Twist (1837), and which was being developed by his friends Wilkie Collins and William Harrison Ainsworth With its scenes of convicts, prison ships, and episodes of bloody violence, Dickens creates characters worthy of the Newgate school of fiction [119]\n\n\nGothic novel\nGreat Expectations contains elements of the Gothic genre, especially Miss Havisham, the bride frozen in time, and the ruined Satis House filled with weeds and spiders [85] Other characters linked to this genre include the aristocratic Bentley Drummle, because of his extreme cruelty; Pip himself, who spends his youth chasing a frozen beauty; the monstrous Orlick, who systematically attempts to murder his employers Then there is the fight to the death between Compeyson and Magwitch, and the fire that ends up killing Miss Havisham, scenes dominated by horror, suspense, and the sensational [117]\n\n\nSilver-fork novel\nElements of the silver-fork novel are found in the character of Miss Havisham and her world, as well as Pip's illusions This genre, which flourished in the 1820s and 1830s, [120] presents the flashy elegance and aesthetic frivolities found in high society In some respects, Dickens conceived Great Expectations as an anti silver fork novel, attacking Charles Lever's novel A Day's Ride, publication of which began January 1860, in Household Words [85] [121] This can be seen in the way that Dickens satirises the pretensions and morals of Miss Havisham and her sycophants, including the Pockets (except Matthew), and Uncle Pumblechook [85]\n\n\nHistorical novel\nThough Great Expectations is not obviously a historical novel, Dickens does emphasise differences between the time that the novel is set (c. 1812–46) and when it was written (1860–1).\n\n\nThemes\nThe title's \"Expectations\" refers to \"a legacy to come\", [123] and thus immediately announces that money, or more specifically wealth plays an important part in the novel [7] Some other major themes are crime, social class, including both gentility, and social alienation, imperialism and ambition The novel is also concerned with questions relating to conscience and moral regeneration, as well as redemption through love.\n\n\nPip's name\nDickens famously created comic and telling names for his characters, [124] but in Great Expectations he goes further The first sentence of the novel establishes that Pip's proper name is Philip Pirrip—the wording of his father's gravestone—which \"my infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit than Pip\" The name Philip Pirrip (or Pirrip) is never again used in the novel In Chapter 18, when he receives his expectation from an anonymous benefactor, the first condition attached to it is \"that you always bear the name of Pip\".\n\n\nPip as social outcast\nA central theme here is of people living as social outcasts The novel's opening setting emphasises this: the orphaned Pip lives in an isolated foggy environment next to a graveyard, dangerous swamps, and prison ships Furthermore, \"I was always treated as if I had insisted on being born in opposition to the dictates of reason, religion and morality\" [125]\n\n\nWealth\nWhen the money secretly provided by Magwitch enables Pip to enter London society, two new related themes, wealth and gentility, are introduced.\n\n\nLondon as prison\nIn London, neither wealth nor gentility brings happiness Pip, the apprentice gentleman constantly bemoans his anxiety, his feelings of insecurity, [140] and multiple allusions to overwhelming chronic unease, to weariness, drown his enthusiasm (chapter 34) [141] Wealth, in effect, eludes his control: the more he spends, the deeper he goes into debt to satisfy new needs, which were just as futile as his old ones.\n\n\nGentility\nThe idea of \"good breeding\" and what makes for a \"gentleman\" other than money, in other words, \"gentility\", is a central theme of Great Expectations The convict Magwitch covets it by proxy through Pip; Mrs Pocket dreams of acquiring it; it is also found in Pumblechook's sycophancy; it is even seen in Joe, when he stammers between \"Pip\" and \"Sir\" during his visit to London, and when Biddy's letters to Pip suddenly become reverent.\n\n\nMoral regeneration\nAnother theme of Great Expectations is that Pip can undergo \"moral regeneration\".\n\n\nPip's conscience\nAnother important theme is Pip's sense of guilt, which he has felt from an early age After the encounter with the convict Magwitch, Pip is afraid that someone will find out about his crime and arrest him The theme of guilt comes into even greater effect when Pip discovers that his benefactor is a convict Pip has an internal struggle with his conscience throughout Great Expectations, hence the long and painful process of redemption that he undergoes.\n\n\nImperialism\nEdward W Said, in his 1993 work Culture and Imperialism, interprets Great Expectations in terms of postcolonial theory about late-eighteenth- and nineteenth-century British imperialism Pip's disillusionment when he learns his benefactor is an escaped convict from Australia, along with his acceptance of Magwitch as surrogate father, is described by Said as part of \"the imperial process\", that is the way colonialism exploits the weaker members of a society [161] Thus the British trading post in Cairo legitimatises Pip's work as a clerk, but the money earned by Magwitch's honest labour is illegitimate, because Australia is a penal colony, and Magwitch is forbidden to return to Britain [N 9] Said states that Dickens has Magwitch return to be redeemed by Pip's love, paving the way for Pip's own redemption, but despite this moral message, the book still reinforces standards that support the authority of the British Empire [162] Said's interpretation suggests that Dickens's attitude backs Britain's exploitation of Middle East \"through trade and travel\", and that Great Expectations affirms the idea of keeping the Empire and its peoples in their place—at the exploitable margins of British society.\n\n\nNovels influenced by Great Expectations\nDickens's novel has influenced a number of writers Sue Roe's Estella: Her Expectations (1982), for example, explores the inner life of an Estella fascinated with a Havisham figure [163] Miss Havisham is again important in Havisham: A Novel (2013), a book by Ronald Frame, that features an imagining of the life of Miss Catherine Havisham from childhood to adulthood [164] The second chapter of Rosalind Ashe's Literary Houses (1982) paraphrases Miss Havisham's story, with details about the nature and structure of Satis House and coloured imaginings of the house within [165] Miss Havisham is also central to Lost in a Good Book (2002), Jasper Fforde's alternative history fantasy novel, which features a parody of Miss Havisham [166] It won the Independent Mystery Booksellers Association 2004 Dilys Award [167]\n\n\nAdaptations\nLike many other Dickens novels, Great Expectations has been filmed for the cinema or television and adapted for the stage numerous times The film adaptation in 1946 gained the greatest acclaim [171] The story is often staged, and less often produced as a musical The 1939 stage play and the 1946 film that followed from that stage production did not include the character Orlick and ends the story when the characters are still young adults [172] That character has been excluded in many televised adaptations made since the 1946 movie by David Lean [172] Following are highlights of the adaptations for film and television, and for the stage, since the early 20th century.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nTexts\n\n\nGeneral

Expectations**\n\nGreat Expectations is a novel by Charles Dickens, first published in serial form in 1860-61. It is one of Dickens's most popular and enduring works, and is widely regarded as a classic of English literature.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nGreat Expectations is a coming-of-age story that follows the life of Pip, an orphan boy who is raised by his sister and her husband, a blacksmith. The novel is set in the early 19th century, and explores themes of love, class, and redemption. Through Pip's journey, Dickens explores the complexities of the human experience, and the ways in which our experiences shape us into who we become.\n\n**Plot Summary**\n\nThe book includes three \"stages\" of Pip's expectations.\n\n### First Stage\n\nPhilip \"Pip\" Pirrip is a seven-year-old orphan who lives with his hot-tempered older sister and her kindly blacksmith husband Joe Gargery on the coastal marshes of Kent. On Christmas Eve 1812, Pip visits the graves of his parents and siblings. There, he unexpectedly encounters an escaped convict who threatens to kill him if he does not bring back food and tools. Pip steals a file from among Joe's tools and a pie and brandy that were meant for Christmas dinner, which he delivers to the convict.\n\n### Second Stage\n\nPip's first experience with urban England is a shock, for London is not the \"soft white city\" Pip imagined. He moves into Barnard's Inn with Herbert Pocket, the son of his tutor, Matthew Pocket, who is Miss Havisham's cousin. Pip realizes Herbert is the boy he fought with years ago. Herbert tells Pip how Miss Havisham was defrauded and deserted by her fiancé. Pip meets fellow pupils, Bentley Drummle, a brute of a man from a wealthy noble family, and Startop, who is a more agreeable colleague. Jaggers disburses the money Pip needs. During a visit, Pip meets Jaggers's housekeeper Molly, a former convict.\n\n### Third Stage\n\nA shocked Pip stops taking Magwitch's money, but devises a plan with Herbert to help him escape from England. Magwitch shares his past with Pip, and reveals that the escaped convict whom he fought in the churchyard was Compeyson, the fraudster who had deserted Miss Havisham.\n\n**Characters**\n\nAs Dickens began writing Great Expectations, he undertook a series of hugely popular and remunerative reading tours. His domestic life had, however, disintegrated in the late 1850s and he had separated from his wife, Catherine Dickens, and was having a secret affair with the much younger Ellen Ternan.\n\n### Pip and his Family\n\nAs Dickens began writing Great Expectations, he undertook a series of hugely popular and remunerative reading tours.

His domestic life had, however, disintegrated in the late 1850s and he had separated from his wife, Catherine Dickens, and was having a secret affair with the much younger Ellen Ternan.\n\n**The Creative Process**\n\nIn his Book of Memoranda, begun in 1855, Dickens wrote names for possible characters: Magwitch, Provis, Clarriker, Compey, Pumblechook, Orlick, Gargery, Wopsle, Skiffins, some of which became familiar in Great Expectations. There is also a reference to a \"knowing man\", a possible sketch of Bentley Drummle. Another evokes a house full of \"Toadies and Humbugs\", foreshadowing the visitors to Satis House in chapter 11.\n\n**Publication History**\n\nGreat Expectations was first published in serial form in All the Year Round from 1860-1861. The novel was divided into nine monthly sections, with new pagination for each. Harper's Weekly published the novel from 24 November 1860 to 5 August 1861 in the US and All the Year Round published it from 1 December 1860 to 3 August 1861 in the UK. Harper's paid £1,000 (equivalent to £119,000 in 2023) for publication rights. Dickens welcomed a contract with Tauchnitz 4 January 1861 for publication in English for the European continent.\n\n**Reception**\n\nRobert L Patten estimates that All the Year Round sold 100,000 copies of Great Expectations each week, and Mudie, the largest circulating library, which purchased about 1,400 copies, stated that at least 30 people read each copy. Aside from the dramatic plot, the Dickensian humour also appealed to readers. Dickens wrote to Forster in October 1860 that \"You will not have to complain of the want of humour as in the Tale of Two Cities,\" an opinion Forster supports, finding that \"Dickens's humour, not less than his creative power, was at its best in this book.\"\n\n**Background**\n\nGreat Expectations's single most obvious literary predecessor is Dickens's earlier first-person protagonist-narrated David Copperfield.

\"Pip\" Pirrip is a seven-year-old orphan who lives with his hot-tempered older sister and her kindly blacksmith husband Joe Gargery on the coastal marshes of Kent On Christmas Eve 1812, [14] Pip visits the graves of his parents and siblings There, he unexpectedly encounters an escaped convict who threatens to kill him if he does not bring back food and tools Pip steals a file from among Joe's tools and a pie and brandy that were meant for Christmas dinner, which he delivers to the convict.\n\n\nSecond stage\nPip's first experience with urban England is a shock, for London is not the \"soft white city\" Pip imagined, but a place of heavy litter and filth Pip moves into Barnard's Inn with Herbert Pocket, the son of his tutor, Matthew Pocket, who is Miss Havisham's cousin Pip realizes Herbert is the boy he fought with years ago Herbert tells Pip how Miss Havisham was defrauded and deserted by her fiancé Pip meets fellow pupils, Bentley Drummle, a brute of a man from a wealthy noble family, and Startop, who is a more agreeable colleague Jaggers disburses the money Pip needs [19] During a visit, Pip meets Jaggers's housekeeper Molly, a former convict.\n\n\nThird stage\nA shocked Pip stops taking Magwitch's money, but devises a plan with Herbert to help him escape from England [22] Magwitch shares his past with Pip, and reveals that the escaped convict whom he fought in the churchyard was Compeyson, the fraudster who had deserted Miss Havisham [23]\n\n\nCharacters\nAs Dickens began writing Great Expectations, he undertook a series of hugely popular and remunerative reading tours His domestic life had, however, disintegrated in the late 1850s and he had separated from his wife, Catherine Dickens, and was having a secret affair with the much younger Ellen Ternan

Ternan's reluctance to become Dickens's mistress [31]\n\n\nBeginning\nIn his Book of Memoranda, begun in 1855, Dickens wrote names for possible characters: Magwitch, Provis, Clarriker, Compey, Pumblechook, Orlick, Gargery, Wopsle, Skiffins, some of which became familiar in Great Expectations There is also a reference to a \"knowing man\", a possible sketch of Bentley Drummle [32] Another evokes a house full of \"Toadies and Humbugs\", foreshadowing the visitors to Satis House in chapter 11 [32] [33] Margaret Cardwell discovered the \"premonition\" of Great Expectations from a 25 September 1855 letter from Dickens to W H Wills, in which Dickens speaks of recycling an \"odd idea\" from the Christmas special \"A House to Let\" and \"the pivot round which my next book shall revolve\" [34] [35] The \"odd idea\" concerns an individual who \"retires to an old lonely house…resolved to shut out the world and hold no communion with it\" [34]\n\n\nPublication in All the Year Round\nDickens was pleased with the idea, calling it \"such a very fine, new and grotesque idea\" in a letter to Forster [11] He planned to write \"a little piece\", a \"grotesque tragi-comic conception\", about a young hero who befriends an escaped convict, who then makes a fortune in Australia and anonymously bequeaths his property to the hero In the end, the hero loses the money because it is forfeited to the Crown In his biography of Dickens, Forster wrote that in the early idea \"was the germ of Pip and Magwitch, which at first he intended to make the groundwork of a tale in the old twenty-number form\" [37] Dickens presented the relationship between Pip and Magwitch pivotal to Great Expectations but without Miss Havisham, Estella, or other characters he later created.\n\n\nRevised ending\nFollowing comments by Edward Bulwer-Lytton that the ending was too sad, Dickens rewrote it prior to publication The ending set aside by Dickens has Pip, who is still single, briefly see Estella in London; after becoming Bentley Drummle's widow, she has remarried [39] [45] It appealed to Dickens due to its originality: \" [the] winding up will be away from all such things as they conventionally go\" [39] [46] Dickens revised the ending for publication so that Pip meets Estella in the ruins of Satis House, she is a widow and he is single His changes at the conclusion of the novel did not quite end either with the final weekly part or the first bound edition, because Dickens further changed the last sentence in the amended 1868 version from \"I could see the shadow of no parting from her\" [39] to \"I saw no shadow of another parting from her\" [47] As Pip uses litotes, \"no shadow of another parting\", it is ambiguous whether Pip and Estella marry or Pip remains single Angus Calder, writing for an edition in the Penguin English Library, believed the less definite phrasing of the amended 1868 version perhaps hinted at a buried meaning: 'at this happy moment, I did not see the shadow of our subsequent parting looming over us.' [48]\n\n\nPublication history\nDickens and Wills co-owned All the Year Round, one 75%, the other 25% Since Dickens was his own publisher, he did not require a contract for his own works [60] Although intended for weekly publication, Great Expectations was divided into nine monthly sections, with new pagination for each [53] Harper's Weekly published the novel from 24 November 1860 to 5 August 1861 in the US and All the Year Round published it from 1 December 1860 to 3 August 1861 in the UK Harper's paid £1,000 (equivalent to £119,000 in 2023) for publication rights Dickens welcomed a contract with Tauchnitz 4 January 1861 for publication in English for the European continent.\n\n\nIn periodicals\nDickens and Wills co-owned All the Year Round, one 75%, the other 25% Since Dickens was his

(equivalent to £119,000 in 2023) for publication rights Dickens welcomed a contract with Tauchnitz 4 January 1861 for publication in English for the European continent.\n\n\nEditions\nRobert L Patten identifies four American editions in 1861 and sees the proliferation of publications in Europe and across the Atlantic as \"extraordinary testimony\" to Great Expectations's popularity [62] Chapman and Hall published the first edition in three volumes in 1861, [2] [3] [4] five subsequent reprints between 6 July and 30 October, and a one-volume edition in 1862 The \"bargain\" edition was published in 1862, the Library Edition in 1864, and the Charles Dickens edition in 1868 To this list, Paul Schlicke adds \"two meticulous scholarly editions\", one Clarendon Press published in 1993 with an introduction by Margaret Cardwell [63] and another with an introduction by Edgar Rosenberg, published by Norton in 1999 [53] The novel was published with one ending (visible in the four online editions listed in the External links at the end of this article) In some 20th century editions, the novel ends as originally published in 1867, and in an afterword, the ending Dickens did not publish, along with a brief story of how a friend persuaded him to a happier ending for Pip, is presented to the reader (for example, 1987 audio edition by Recorded Books [64]).\n\n\nFirst edition publication schedule\nRobert L Patten estimates that All the Year Round sold 100,000 copies of Great Expectations each week, and Mudie, the largest circulating library, which purchased about 1,400 copies, stated that at least 30 people read each copy [70] Aside from the dramatic plot, the Dickensian humour also appealed to readers Dickens wrote to Forster in October 1860 that \"You will not have to complain of the want of humour as in the Tale of Two Cities,\" [71] an opinion Forster supports, finding that \"Dickens's humour, not less than his creative power, was at its best in this book\" [37] [72] Moreover, according to Paul Schlicke, readers found the best of Dickens's older and newer writing styles [6]\n\n\nReception\nRobert L Patten estimates that All the Year Round sold

an opinion Forster supports, finding that \"Dickens's humour, not less than his creative power, was at its best in this book\" [37] [72] Moreover, according to Paul Schlicke, readers found the best of Dickens's older and newer writing styles [6]\n\n\nBackground\nGreat Expectations's single most obvious literary predecessor is Dickens's earlier first-person protagonist-narrated David Copperfield The two novels trace the psychological and moral development of a young boy to maturity, his transition from a rural environment to the London metropolis, the vicissitudes of his emotional development, and the exhibition of his hopes and youthful dreams and their metamorphosis, through a rich and complex first person narrative [77] Dickens was conscious of this similarity and, before undertaking his new manuscript, reread David Copperfield to avoid repetition [41]\n\n\nStructure\nThe narrative structure of Great Expectations is influenced by the fact that it was first published as weekly episodes in a periodical This required short chapters, centred on a single subject, and an almost mathematical structure [91]\n\n\nChronology\nPip's story is told in three stages: his childhood and early youth in Kent, where he dreams of rising above his humble station; his time in London after receiving \"great expectations\"; and then finally his disillusionment on discovering the source of his fortune, followed by his slow realisation of the vanity of his false values [92] These three stages are further divided into twelve parts of equal length This symmetry contributes to the impression of completion, which has often been commented on George Gissing, for example, when comparing Joe Gargery and Dan'l Peggotty (from David Copperfield), preferred the former, because he is a stronger character, who lives \"in a world, not of melodrama, but of everyday cause and effect\" [93] G B Shaw also commented on the novel's structure, describing it as \"compactly perfect\", and Algernon Swinburne stated, \"The defects in it are as nearly imperceptible as spots on the sun or shadow on a sunlit sea\" [94] [95] A contributing factor is \"the briskness of the narrative tone\" [96]\n\n\nNarrative flow\nFurther, beyond the chronological sequences and the weaving of several storylines into a tight plot, the sentimental setting and morality of the characters also create a pattern [97] The narrative structure of Great Expectations has two main elements: firstly that of \"foster parents\", Miss Havisham, Magwitch, and Joe, and secondly that of \"young people\", Estella, Pip and Biddy There is a further organizing element that can be labelled \"Dangerous Lovers\", which includes Compeyson, Bentley Drummle and Orlick Pip is the centre of this web of love, rejection and hatred Dickens contrasts this \"dangerous love\" with the relationship of Biddy and Joe, which grows from friendship to marriage.\n\n\nOrlick as Pip's double\nJulian Moynahan argues that the reader can better understand Pip's personality through analysing his relationship with Orlick, the criminal laborer who works at Joe Gargery's forge, than by looking at his relationship with Magwitch [100]\n\n\nPoint of view\nAlthough the novel is written in first person, the reader knows—as an essential prerequisite—that Great Expectations is not an autobiography but a novel, a work of fiction with plot and characters, featuring a narrator-protagonist In addition, Sylvère Monod notes that the treatment of the autobiography differs from David Copperfield, as Great Expectations does not draw from events in Dickens's life; \"at most some traces of a broad psychological and moral introspection can be found\" [103]\n\n\nStyle\nSome of the narrative devices that Dickens uses are caricature, comic speech mannerisms, intrigue, Gothic atmosphere, and a central character who gradually changes Earl Davis notes the close network of the structure and balance of contrasts, and praises the first-person narration for providing a simplicity that is appropriate for the story while avoiding melodrama Davis sees the symbolism attached to \"great expectations\" [vague] as reinforcing the novel's impact [108]\n\n\nCharacterisation\nCharacters then become themes in themselves, almost a Wagnerian leitmotiv, whose attitudes are repeated at each of their appearances as a musical phrase signaling their entry [109] For example, Jaggers constantly chews the same fingernail and washes his hands with scented soap, Orlick lurches his huge body, and Matthew Pocket always pulls at his hair Seen by the narrator, their attitude is mechanical, like that of an automaton: in the general scheme, the gesture betrays the uneasiness of the unaccomplished or exasperated man, his betrayed hope, his unsatisfied life [109] In this set, every character is orbited by \"satellite\" characters Wemmick is Jaggers's copy at work, but has placed in Walworth a secret garden, a castle with a family of an elderly father and a middle-aged fiancée, where he happily devours buttered bread [110] Wopsle plays the role of a poor Pip, kind of unsuccessful, but with his distraction, finally plays Hamlet in London, and Pumblechook does not hesitate to be the instrument of Pip's fortunes, then the mentor of his resurrection [111]\n\n\nCharacter leitmotiv\nCharacters then become themes in themselves,

[110] Wopsle plays the role of a poor Pip, kind of unsuccessful, but with his distraction, finally plays Hamlet in London, and Pumblechook does not hesitate to be the instrument of Pip's fortunes, then the mentor of his resurrection [111]\n\n\nNarrative technique\nFor Pip's redemption to be credible, Trotter writes, the words of the main character must sound right [112] Christopher Ricks adds that Pip's frankness induces empathy, dramatics are avoided, [113] and his good actions are more eloquent than words Dickens's subtle narrative technique is also shown when he has Pip confess that he arranged Herbert's partnership with Clarriker, has Miss Havisham finally see the true character of her cousin Matthew Pocket, and has Pocket refuse the money she offers him [114] To this end, the narrative method subtly changes until, during the perilous journey down the Thames to remove Magwitch in chapter 54, the narrative point-of-view shifts from first person to the omniscient point of view For the first time, Ricks writes, the \"I\" ceases to be Pip's thoughts and switches to the other characters, the focus, at once, turns outward, and this is mirrored in the imagery of the black waters tormented waves and eddies, which heaves with an anguish that encompasses the entire universe, the passengers, the docks, the river, the night [114]\n\n\nRomantic and symbolic realism\nAccording to Paul Davis, while more realistic than its autobiographical predecessor written when novels like George Eliot's Adam Bede were in vogue, Great Expectations is in many ways a poetic work built around recurring symbolic images: the desolation of the marshes; the twilight; the chains of the house, the past, the painful memory; the fire; the hands that manipulate and control; the distant stars of desire; the river connecting past, present and future [115]\n\n\nGenre\nGreat Expectations contains a variety of literary genres, including the bildungsroman, gothic novel, crime novel, as well as comedy, melodrama and satire; and it belongs—like Wuthering Heights and the novels of Walter Scott—to the romance rather than realist tradition of the novel [116]\n\n\nBildungsroman\nComplex and multifaceted, Great Expectations is a Victorian bildungsroman, or initiatory tale, which focuses on a protagonist who matures over the course of the novel Great Expectations describes Pip's initial frustration upon leaving home, followed by a long and difficult period that is punctuated with conflicts between his desires and the values of established order During this time he re-evaluates his life and re-enters society on new foundations [85]\n\n\nComic novel\nGreat Expectations contains many comic scenes and eccentric personalities, integral parts to both the plot and the theme Among the notable comic episodes are Pip's Christmas dinner in chapter 4, Wopsle's Hamlet performance in chapter 31, and Wemmick's marriage in chapter 55 Many of the characters have eccentricities: Jaggers with his punctilious lawyerly ways; the contrariness of his clerk, Wemmick, at work advising Pip to invest in \"portable property\", while in private living in a cottage converted into a castle; and the reclusive Miss Havisham in her decaying mansion, wearing her tattered bridal robes [118]\n\n\nCrime fiction\nGreat Expectations incorporates elements of the new genre of crime fiction, which Dickens had already used in Oliver Twist (1837), and which was being developed by his friends Wilkie Collins and William Harrison Ainsworth With its scenes of convicts, prison ships, and episodes of bloody violence, Dickens creates characters worthy of the Newgate school of fiction [119]\n\n\nGothic novel\nGreat Expectations contains elements of the Gothic genre, especially Miss Havisham, the bride frozen in time, and the ruined Satis House filled with weeds and spiders [85] Other characters linked to this genre include the aristocratic Bentley Drummle, because of his extreme cruelty; Pip himself, who spends his youth chasing a frozen beauty; the monstrous Orlick, who systematically attempts to murder his employers Then there is the fight to the death between Compeyson and Magwitch, and the fire that ends up killing Miss Havisham, scenes dominated by horror, suspense, and the sensational [117]\n\n\nSilver-fork novel\nElements of the silver-fork novel are found in the character of Miss Havisham and her world, as well as Pip's illusions This genre, which flourished in the 1820s and 1830s, [120] presents the flashy elegance and aesthetic frivolities found in high society In some respects, Dickens conceived Great Expectations as an anti silver fork novel, attacking Charles Lever's novel A Day's Ride, publication of which began January 1860, in Household Words [85] [121] This can be seen in the way that Dickens satirises the pretensions and morals of Miss Havisham and her sycophants, including the Pockets (except Matthew), and Uncle Pumblechook [85]\n\n\nHistorical novel\nThough Great Expectations is not obviously a historical novel, Dickens does emphasise differences between the time that the novel is set (c. 1812–46) and when it was written (1860–1).\n\n\nThemes\nThe title's \"Expectations\" refers to \"a legacy to come\", [123] and thus immediately announces that money, or more specifically wealth plays an important part in the novel [7] Some other major themes are crime, social class, including both gentility, and social alienation, imperialism and ambition The novel is also concerned with questions relating to conscience and moral regeneration, as well as redemption through love.\n\n\nPip's name\nDickens famously created comic and telling names for his characters, [124] but in Great Expectations he goes further The first sentence of the novel establishes that Pip's proper name is Philip Pirrip—the wording of his father's gravestone—which \"my infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit than Pip\" The name Philip Pirrip (or Pirrip) is never again used in the novel In Chapter 18, when he receives his expectation from an anonymous benefactor, the first condition attached to it is \"that you always bear the name of Pip\".\n\n\nPip as social outcast\nA central theme here is of people living as social outcasts The novel's opening setting emphasises this: the orphaned Pip lives in an isolated foggy environment next to a graveyard, dangerous swamps, and prison ships Furthermore, \"I was always treated as if I had insisted on being born in opposition to the dictates of reason, religion and morality\" [125]\n\n\nWealth\nWhen the money secretly provided by Magwitch enables Pip to enter London society, two new related themes, wealth and gentility, are introduced.\n\n\nLondon as prison\nIn London, neither wealth nor gentility brings happiness Pip, the apprentice gentleman constantly bemoans his anxiety, his feelings of insecurity, [140] and multiple allusions to overwhelming chronic unease, to weariness, drown his enthusiasm (chapter 34) [141] Wealth, in effect, eludes his control: the more he spends, the deeper he goes into debt to satisfy new needs, which were just as futile as his old ones.\n\n\nGentility\nThe idea of \"good breeding\" and what makes for a \"gentleman\" other than money, in other words, \"gentility\", is a central theme of Great Expectations The convict Magwitch covets it by proxy through Pip; Mrs Pocket dreams of acquiring it; it is also found in Pumblechook's sycophancy; it is even seen in Joe, when he stammers between \"Pip\" and \"Sir\" during his visit to London, and when Biddy's letters to Pip suddenly become reverent.\n\n\nMoral regeneration\nAnother theme of Great Expectations is that Pip can undergo \"moral regeneration\".\n\n\nPip's conscience\nAnother important theme is Pip's sense of guilt, which he has felt from an early age After the encounter with the convict Magwitch, Pip is afraid that someone will find out about his crime and arrest him The theme of guilt comes into even greater effect when Pip discovers that his benefactor is a convict Pip has an internal struggle with his conscience throughout Great Expectations, hence the long and painful process of redemption that he undergoes.\n\n\nImperialism\nEdward W Said, in his 1993 work Culture and Imperialism, interprets Great Expectations in terms of postcolonial theory about late-eighteenth- and nineteenth-century British imperialism Pip's disillusionment when he learns his benefactor is an escaped convict from Australia, along with his acceptance of Magwitch as surrogate father, is described by Said as part of \"the imperial process\", that is the way colonialism exploits the weaker members of a society [161] Thus the British trading post in Cairo legitimatises Pip's work as a clerk, but the money earned by Magwitch's honest labour is illegitimate, because Australia is a penal colony, and Magwitch is forbidden to return to Britain [N 9] Said states that Dickens has Magwitch return to be redeemed by Pip's love, paving the way for Pip's own redemption, but despite this moral message, the book still reinforces standards that support the authority of the British Empire [162] Said's interpretation suggests that Dickens's attitude backs Britain's exploitation of Middle East \"through trade and travel\", and that Great Expectations affirms the idea of keeping the Empire and its peoples in their place—at the exploitable margins of British society.\n\n\nNovels influenced by Great Expectations\nDickens's novel has influenced a number of writers Sue Roe's Estella: Her Expectations (1982), for example, explores the inner life of an Estella fascinated with a Havisham figure [163] Miss Havisham is again important in Havisham: A Novel (2013), a book by Ronald Frame, that features an imagining of the life of Miss Catherine Havisham from childhood to adulthood [164] The second chapter of Rosalind Ashe's Literary Houses (1982) paraphrases Miss Havisham's story, with details about the nature and structure of Satis House and coloured imaginings of the house within [165] Miss Havisham is also central to Lost in a Good Book (2002), Jasper Fforde's alternative history fantasy novel, which features a parody of Miss Havisham [166] It won the Independent Mystery Booksellers Association 2004 Dilys Award [167]\n\n\nAdaptations\nLike many other Dickens novels, Great Expectations has been filmed for the cinema or television and adapted for the stage numerous times The film adaptation in 1946 gained the greatest acclaim [171] The story is often staged, and less often produced as a musical The 1939 stage play and the 1946 film that followed from that stage production did not include the character Orlick and ends the story when the characters are still young adults [172] That character has been excluded in many televised adaptations made since the 1946 movie by David Lean [172] Following are highlights of the adaptations for film and television, and for the stage, since the early 20th century.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nTexts\n\n\nGeneral

\"wall's end\" – and to the separate supply fort of Arbeia in South Shields, across the river from Hadrian's Wall [13]\n\n\nAnglo-Saxon and Norman\nAfter the Roman departure from Britain, completed in 410, Newcastle became part of the powerful Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria, and was known throughout this period as Munucceaster (sometimes modernised as Monkchester) [16]\n\n\nMiddle Ages\nThroughout the Middle Ages, Newcastle was England's northern fortress In 1400 Newcastle was separated from Northumberland for administrative purposes [9] [10] [11] [12] and made a county of itself by Henry IV [9] [10] [11] [12] Newcastle was given the title of the county of the town of Newcastle upon Tyne [19] The town had a new charter granted by Elizabeth I in 1589 [20] A 25-foot-high (7.6 m) stone wall was built around the town in the 13th century, [21] to defend it from invaders during the Border war against Scotland The Scots king William the Lion was imprisoned in Newcastle in 1174, and Edward I brought the Stone of Scone and William Wallace south through the town Newcastle was successfully defended against the Scots three times during the 14th century [9] [12]\n\n\n16th to 19th centuries\nFrom 1530, a royal act restricted all shipments of coal from Tyneside to Newcastle Quayside, giving a monopoly in the coal trade to a cartel of Newcastle burgesses known as the Hostmen This monopoly, which lasted for a considerable time, helped Newcastle prosper and develop into a major town The phrase taking coals to Newcastle was first recorded contextually in 1538 [22] The phrase itself means a pointless pursuit [23]\nIn the 18th century, the American entrepreneur Timothy Dexter, regarded as an eccentric, defied this idiom He was persuaded to sail a shipment of coal to Newcastle by merchants plotting to ruin him; however, his shipment arrived on the Tyne during a strike that had crippled local production, allowing him to turn a considerable profit [24] [25]\n\n\n20th and 21st centuries\nNewcastle's public transport system was modernised in 1901 when Newcastle Corporation Tramways electric trams were introduced to the city's streets, though these

England, situated on the north bank of the River Tyne. It is the largest city in the North East region and has a rich history dating back to the Roman era. The city is known for its cultural and economic significance, with a strong sense of community and a vibrant atmosphere.\n\n# History\n\nThe first recorded settlement in what is now Newcastle was Pons Aelius, a Roman fort and bridge across the River Tyne. It was given the family name of the Roman Emperor Hadrian, who founded it in the 2nd century AD. This rare honour suggests that Hadrian may have visited the site and instituted the bridge on his tour of Britain. The population of Pons Aelius was estimated at 2,000.\n\n## Roman\n\nThe first recorded settlement in what is now Newcastle was Pons Aelius, a Roman fort and bridge across the River Tyne.

The population of Pons Aelius was estimated at 2,000.\n\n## Anglo-Saxon and Norman\n\nAfter the Roman departure from Britain, completed in 410, Newcastle became part of the powerful Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria, and was known throughout this period as Munucceaster, sometimes modernised as Monkchester.\n\n## Middle Ages\n\nThroughout the Middle Ages, Newcastle was England's northern fortress. In 1400 Newcastle was separated from Northumberland for administrative purposes and made a county of itself by Henry IV. Newcastle was given the title of the county of the town of Newcastle upon Tyne. The town had a new charter granted by Elizabeth I in 1589. A 25-foot-high stone wall was built around the town in the 13th century, to defend it from invaders during the Border war against Scotland.\n\n## 16th to 19th centuries\n\nFrom 1530, a royal act restricted all shipments of coal from Tyneside to Newcastle Quayside, giving a monopoly in the coal trade to a cartel of Newcastle burgesses known as the Hostmen. This monopoly, which lasted for a considerable time, helped Newcastle prosper and develop into a major town. The phrase \"taking coals to Newcastle\" was first recorded contextually in 1538. The phrase itself means a pointless pursuit. In the 18th century, the American entrepreneur Timothy Dexter, regarded as an eccentric, defied this idiom. He was persuaded to sail a shipment of coal to Newcastle by merchants plotting to ruin him; however, his shipment arrived on the Tyne during a strike that had crippled local production, allowing him to turn a considerable profit.\n\n# Geography\n\nSince 1974, Newcastle has been a part of the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear in North East England. The city is located on the north-western bank of the River Tyne, approximately 46 miles (74 km) south of the border with Scotland.\n\n## Ouseburn\n\nThe wooded gorge of the Ouseburn in the east of the city is known as Jesmond Dene and forms another recreation area, linked by Armstrong Park and Heaton Park to the Ouseburn Valley, where the river finally reaches the River Tyne.\n\n## Quayside\n\nThe area around the Tyne Gorge, between Newcastle on the north bank and Gateshead on the south bank, is the famous Newcastle-Gateshead Quayside.

Established on classical streets built by Richard Grainger, a builder and developer, between 1835 and 1842, some of Newcastle upon Tyne's finest buildings and streets lie within this area of the city centre, including Grainger Market, Theatre Royal, Grey Street, Grainger Street, and Clayton Street.

screenplays Two, the James Bond film You Only Live Twice and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, were adaptations of novels by Ian Fleming [139] [140] Dahl also began adapting his own novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which was completed and rewritten by David Seltzer after Dahl failed to meet deadlines, and produced as the film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971) Dahl later disowned the

\"Dahl's novels are often dark affairs, filled with cruelty, bereavement and Dickensian adults prone to gluttony and sadism The author clearly felt compelled to warn his young readers about the evils of the world, taking the lesson from earlier fairy tales that they could stand hard truths and would be the stronger for hearing them.\" [145]\n\n\nTelevision\nIn 1961, Dahl hosted and wrote for a

at the time [201] [202] [203] According to Dahl, until this point in time \"a race of people\", meaning Jews, had never \"switched so rapidly from much-pitied victims to barbarous murderers\" The empathy of all after the Holocaust had turned \"into hatred and revulsion\" [202] Dahl wrote that Clifton's book would make readers \"violently anti-Israeli\", saying, \"I am not anti-Semitic I am anti-Israel.\" [204] He asked, \"must Israel, like Germany, be brought to her knees before she learns how to behave in this world?\" [205] The United States, he said, was \"so utterly dominated by the great Jewish financial institutions\" that \"they dare not defy\" Israelis [202]\n\n\nOpposition to Israel and antisemitic comments\nDahl reviewed Australian author Tony Clifton's God Cried, a picture

an article in The Horn Book criticising Charlie and the Chocolate Factory for being self-referentially hypocritical: \n\n2023 revisions\nIn 2023, Puffin Books, which holds the rights to all Dahl's children's books, ignited controversy after they hired sensitivity readers to go through the original text of Dahl's works, which led to hundreds of revisions to his books; The Telegraph published a list of many of these changes [222] The move was supported by a number of authors, most notably by Joanne Harris, chair of the Society of Authors, and Diego Jourdan Pereira at Writer's Digest, but drew many more critical responses [223] [224] Several public figures, including then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and author Salman Rushdie, spoke out against the changes [225] [226] [227] [228] It was reported that when Dahl was alive, he had spoken out very strongly against any changes ever being made to any of his books [229] [230] On 23 February 2023, Puffin announced it would release an unedited selection of Dahl's children's books as 'The Roald Dahl Classic Collection', stating, \"We've listened to the debate over the past week which has reaffirmed the extraordinary power of Roald Dahl's books\" and \"recognise the importance of keeping Dahl's classic texts in print\" [231] [232]\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nWriting roles\n\n\nPresenting roles\n\n\nNon-presenting

the member of parliament Georg Wallace and a descendant of an early 18th-century Scottish immigrant to Norway [19]\n\n\nChildhood\nRoald Dahl was born in 1916 at Villa Marie, Fairwater Road, in Llandaff, Cardiff, Wales, to Norwegians Harald Dahl and Sofie Magdalene Dahl (née Hesselberg) [14] [15] Dahl's father, a wealthy shipbroker and self-made man, had emigrated to Britain from Sarpsborg, Norway and settled in Cardiff in the 1880s with his first wife, Frenchwoman Marie Beaurin-Gresser They had two children together (Ellen Marguerite and Louis) before her death in 1907 [16] Roald's mother belonged to a well-established Norwegian family of lawyers, priests in the state church and wealthy merchants and estate owners, and emigrated to Britain when she married his father in 1911 Dahl was named after Norwegian polar explorer Roald Amundsen [17] His first language was Norwegian, which he spoke at home with his parents and his sisters Astri, Alfhild, and Else The children were raised in Norway's Lutheran state church, the Church of Norway, and were baptised at the Norwegian Church, Cardiff [18] His maternal grandmother Ellen Wallace was a granddaughter of the member of parliament Georg Wallace and a descendant of an early 18th-century Scottish immigrant to Norway [19]\n\n\nRepton School\nFrom 1929, when he was 13, Dahl attended Repton School in Derbyshire Dahl disliked the hazing and described an environment of ritual cruelty and status domination, with younger boys having to act as personal servants for older boys, frequently subject to terrible beatings His biographer Donald Sturrock described these violent experiences in Dahl's early life [38] Dahl expresses some of these darker experiences in his writings, which is also marked by his hatred of cruelty and corporal punishment [39]\n\n\nAfter school\nAfter finishing his schooling, in August 1934 Dahl crossed the Atlantic on the RMS Nova Scotia and hiked through Newfoundland with the British Public Schools Exploring Society [51] [52]\n\n\nFighter pilot\nIn August 1939, as the Second World War loomed, the British made plans to round up the hundreds of Germans living in Dar-es-Salaam Dahl was commissioned as a lieutenant into the King's African Rifles, commanding a platoon of Askari men, indigenous troops who were serving in the colonial army [55]\n\n\nDiplomat, writer and intelligence officer\nAfter being invalided home, Dahl was posted to an RAF training camp in Uxbridge He attempted to recover his health enough to become an instructor [72] In late March 1942, while in London, he met the Under-Secretary of State for Air, Major Harold Balfour, at his club Impressed by Dahl's war record and conversational abilities, Balfour appointed the young man as assistant air attaché at the British Embassy in Washington, D.C Initially resistant, Dahl was finally persuaded by Balfour to accept, and took passage on the MS Batory from Glasgow a few days later He arrived in Halifax, Canada, on 14 April, after which he took a sleeper train to Montreal [73]\n\n\nPost-war life\nDahl married American actress Patricia Neal on 2 July 1953 at Trinity Church in New York City Their marriage lasted for 30 years and they had five children:\n\n\nWriting\nDahl's first published work, inspired by a meeting with C S Forester, was \"A Piece of Cake\", on 1 August 1942 The story, about his wartime adventures, was bought by The Saturday Evening Post for US$1,000 (equivalent to $19,000 in 2023) and published under the title \"Shot Down Over Libya\" [108]\n\n\nChildren's fiction\n\"He  [Dahl] was mischievous A grown-up being mischievous He addresses you, a child, as somebody who knows about the world He was a grown-up—and he was bigger than most—who is on your side That must have something to do with it.\"\n\n\nScreenplays\nFor a brief period in the 1960s, Dahl wrote screenplays Two, the James Bond film You Only Live Twice and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, were adaptations of novels by Ian Fleming [139] [140] Dahl also began adapting his own novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which was completed and rewritten by David Seltzer after Dahl failed to meet deadlines, and produced as the film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971) Dahl later disowned the film, saying he was \"disappointed\" because \"he thought it placed too much emphasis on Willy Wonka and not enough on Charlie\" [141] He was also \"infuriated\" by the deviations in the plot devised by David Seltzer in his draft of the screenplay This resulted in his refusal for any more versions of the book to be made in his lifetime, as well as an adaptation for the sequel Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator [142]\n\n\nInfluences\nA major part of Dahl's literary influences stemmed from his childhood In his younger days, he was an avid reader, especially awed by fantastic tales of heroism and triumph He met his idol, Beatrix Potter, when he was six years old [28] His other favourite authors included Rudyard Kipling, Charles Dickens, William Makepeace Thackeray and former Royal Navy officer Frederick Marryat, and their works made a lasting mark on his life and writing [144] He named Marryat's Mr Midshipman Easy as his favourite novel [134] Joe Sommerlad in The Independent writes, \"Dahl's novels are often dark affairs, filled with cruelty, bereavement and Dickensian adults prone to gluttony and sadism The author clearly felt compelled to warn his young readers about the evils of the world, taking the lesson from earlier fairy tales that they could stand hard truths and would be the stronger for hearing them.\" [145]\n\n\nTelevision\nIn 1961, Dahl hosted and wrote for a science fiction and horror television anthology series called Way Out, which preceded the Twilight Zone series on the CBS network for 14 episodes from March to July [151] One of the last dramatic network shows shot in New York City, the entire series is available for viewing at The Paley Center for Media in New York City and Los Angeles [152] He also wrote for the satirical BBC comedy programme That Was the Week That Was, which was hosted by David Frost [153]\n\n\nDeath and legacy\nRoald Dahl died on 23 November 1990, at the age of 74 of a rare cancer of the blood, myelodysplastic syndrome, in Oxford, [156] and was buried in the cemetery at the Church of St Peter and St Paul, Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, England His obituary in The Times was titled \"Death silences Pied Piper of the macabre\" [157] According to his granddaughter, the family gave him a \"sort of Viking funeral\" He was buried with his snooker cues, some very good burgundy, chocolates, HB pencils and a power saw Today, children continue to leave toys and flowers by his grave [158]\n\n\nCriticism and controversies\nDahl reviewed Australian author Tony Clifton's God Cried, a picture book about the siege of West Beirut by the Israeli army during the 1982 Lebanon War [200] The article appeared in the August 1983 issue of the Literary Review and was the subject of much media comment and criticism at the time [201] [202] [203] According to Dahl, until this point in time \"a race of people\", meaning Jews, had never \"switched so rapidly from much-pitied victims to barbarous murderers\" The empathy of all after the Holocaust had turned \"into hatred and revulsion\" [202] Dahl wrote that Clifton's book would make readers \"violently anti-Israeli\", saying, \"I am not anti-Semitic I am anti-Israel.\" [204] He asked, \"must Israel, like Germany, be brought to her knees before she learns how to behave in this world?\" [205] The United States, he said, was \"so utterly dominated by the great Jewish financial institutions\" that \"they dare not defy\" Israelis [202]\n\n\nOpposition to Israel and antisemitic comments\nDahl reviewed Australian author Tony Clifton's God Cried, a picture book about the siege of West Beirut by the Israeli army during the 1982 Lebanon War [200] The article appeared in the August 1983 issue of the Literary Review and was the subject of much media comment and criticism at the time [201] [202] [203] According to Dahl, until this point in time \"a race of people\", meaning Jews, had never \"switched so rapidly from much-pitied victims to barbarous murderers\" The empathy of all after the Holocaust had turned \"into hatred and revulsion\" [202] Dahl wrote that Clifton's book would make readers \"violently anti-Israeli\", saying, \"I am not anti-Semitic I am anti-Israel.\" [204] He asked, \"must Israel, like Germany, be brought to her knees before she learns how to behave in this world?\" [205] The United States, he said, was \"so utterly dominated by the great Jewish financial institutions\" that \"they dare not defy\" Israelis [202]\n\n\nUse of stereotypes\n\nIn 1972, Eleanor Cameron, also a children's book author, published an article in The Horn Book criticising Charlie and the Chocolate Factory for being self-referentially hypocritical: \n\n2023 revisions\nIn 2023, Puffin Books, which holds the rights to all Dahl's children's books, ignited controversy after they hired sensitivity readers to go through the original text of Dahl's works, which led to hundreds of revisions to his books; The Telegraph published a list of many of these changes [222] The move was supported by a number of authors, most notably by Joanne Harris, chair of the Society of Authors, and Diego Jourdan Pereira at Writer's Digest, but drew many more critical responses [223] [224] Several public figures, including then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and author Salman Rushdie, spoke out against the changes [225] [226] [227] [228] It was reported that when Dahl was alive, he had spoken out very strongly against any changes ever being made to any of his books [229] [230] On 23 February 2023, Puffin announced it would release an unedited selection of Dahl's children's books as 'The Roald Dahl Classic Collection', stating, \"We've listened to the debate over the past week which has reaffirmed the extraordinary power of Roald Dahl's books\" and \"recognise the importance of keeping Dahl's classic texts in print\" [231]

Kennedy. Throughout his life, Harrelson was involved in various crimes, including murder, conspiracy, and attempted escape, which ultimately led to his imprisonment and eventual death.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nCharles Harrelson was born on July 23, 1938, in Lovelady, Texas, to Alma Lee (née Sparks) and Voyde Harrelson. His father, Voyde, was a mechanic, and the family lived a relatively modest life. Harrelson's early life was marked by instability, with his parents divorcing when he was young. He dropped out of high school and drifted from job to job, eventually becoming involved in a life of crime.\n\n**Murder of Alan Harry Berg**\n\nIn 1968, Harrelson was accused of murdering Alan Harry Berg, a 25-year-old man who was shot and killed in Angleton, Texas. Harrelson was defended by the renowned lawyer Percy Foreman and was ultimately acquitted by a jury in September 1970. The murder was chronicled in the memoir \"Run Brother Run\" by Berg's brother, David.\n\n**Murder of Sam Degelia**\n\nIn 1968, Harrelson was also accused of murdering Sam Degelia Jr., a 35-year-old grain dealer and father of four, who was killed in McAllen, Texas. Harrelson was paid $2,000 for the murder and was subsequently tried twice for the crime. The first trial ended in a deadlocked jury, while the second trial resulted in a conviction and a 15-year prison sentence. Harrelson served five years before being released early for good behavior in 1978.\n\n**Murder of Judge John H. Wood Jr.**\n\nIn 1979, Harrelson and his then-wife, Jo Ann, were implicated in the murder of U.S. District Judge John H. Wood Jr. Wood, known as \"Maximum John\" for his tough sentencing of drug offenders, was shot and killed in the parking lot outside his San Antonio townhouse on May 29, 1979. Harrelson was subsequently convicted of the murder and sentenced to life in prison.\n\n**Allegations of Involvement in the Assassination of John F. Kennedy**\n\nIn 1980, Harrelson made headlines when he surrendered to police after a six-hour standoff in which he claimed to have killed President John F. Kennedy. Harrelson stated that the claims were an attempt to \"elongate my life,\" but the allegations were never proven. The incident was widely reported in the media and further cemented Harrelson's reputation as a notorious figure.\n\n**Escape Attempt**\n\nIn 1995, Harrelson and two other inmates, Gary Settle and Michael Rivers, attempted to escape from the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary using a makeshift rope. A warning shot was fired at them from the prison's tower, and the trio surrendered. Harrelson was subsequently transferred to the maximum-security ADX Florence prison in Colorado, where he would remain until his death.\n\n**Life Inside ADX Florence**\n\nIn a letter to a friend, Harrelson described his life inside the maximum-security facility as \"wonderful,\" citing the silence and isolation as a welcome respite from the chaos of the outside world. Harrelson would spend the remainder of his life in solitary confinement, with only occasional visits from his family and friends.\n\n**Death**\n\nOn March 15, 2007, Charles Harrelson was found dead in his cell, having died at the age of 68 from a heart attack. His death was met with little fanfare, a testament to the public's waning interest in the notorious figure.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nCharles Harrelson's life and crimes have been the subject of numerous books, films, and documentaries. His involvement in the murder of Judge John H. Wood Jr. was referenced in Cormac McCarthy's novel \"No Country for Old Men,\" which was adapted into a film in 2007. The film's star, Woody Harrelson, is the son of the notorious convict.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Charles_Harrelson\" following this outline:\n\n\nPersonal life\nCharles Harrelson was born on July 23, 1938, in Lovelady, Texas, [3] the son of Alma Lee (née Sparks; 1907–2002) and Voyde Harrelson (1901–1976).\n\n\nMurder of Alan Harry Berg\nDefended by Percy Foreman, Harrelson was tried for the 1968 murder of Alan Harry Berg On September 22, 1970, he was acquitted by a jury in Angleton, Texas [7] The murder is chronicled in the memoir Run Brother Run by the victim's brother, David Berg [8]\n\n\nMurder of Sam Degelia\nHarrelson was tried for the 1968 murder-for-hire killing of Sam Degelia Jr., a resident of Hearne, Texas Harrelson was paid $2,000 (the equivalent of $18,000 in 2020) for the murder of Degelia, a grain dealer and father of four who was killed in McAllen, Texas [9] His first trial ended with a deadlocked jury, [9] although Pete Scamardo was also tried in the case, found guilty of being an accomplice to the murder, [10] and sentenced to seven years probation [11] [12] Harrelson was retried in 1973, convicted, and sentenced to 15 years in prison [13] In 1978, after serving five years, he was released early for good behavior [13]\n\n\nMurder of Judge John H.

{"title": "Ramsay_Hunt_syndrome", "content": "", "lang": "en", "article": "Ramsay Hunt Syndrome\n\nRamsay Hunt syndrome, also known as herpes zoster oticus, is a rare neurological disorder characterized by facial paralysis and a rash in the ear. The condition occurs when the varicella-zoster virus, which causes chickenpox and shingles, reactivates in the geniculate ganglion, a nerve bundle in the facial nerve.\n\n# History\n## Discovery and Naming\nThe Ramsay Hunt syndrome was first described in 1907 by British neurologist James Ramsay Hunt, who noticed a correlation between facial paralysis and a rash in the ear. The condition was initially thought to be a rare complication of chickenpox, but it was later recognized as a distinct entity.\n\n## Early Research and Understanding\nIn the early 20th century, researchers began to study the Ramsay Hunt syndrome in more detail. They found that the condition was caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus in the geniculate ganglion, which is a nerve bundle in the facial nerve. This reactivation leads to inflammation of the nerve and the surrounding tissues, resulting in facial paralysis and a rash in the ear.\n\n## Current Understanding\nToday, the Ramsay Hunt syndrome is understood to be a complication of herpes zoster, a viral infection that causes shingles. The varicella-zoster virus remains dormant in the nerve cells of the geniculate ganglion after a person has had chickenpox, and can reactivate many years later, causing the Ramsay Hunt syndrome.\n\n# Causes\n## Herpes Zoster Virus\nThe Ramsay Hunt syndrome is caused by the reactivation of the herpes zoster virus in the geniculate ganglion. This reactivation leads to inflammation of the nerve and the surrounding tissues, resulting in facial paralysis and a rash in the ear.\n\n## Age and Immune System\nThe Ramsay Hunt syndrome is more common in people over the age of 60, who are also more likely to have a weakened immune system. This can make it more difficult for the body to fight off the reactivation of the herpes zoster virus.\n\n## Other Factors\nOther factors that can increase the risk of developing the Ramsay Hunt syndrome include:\n\n* A history of shingles\n* A weakened immune system\n* Certain medical conditions, such as diabetes or cancer\n* Certain medications, such as steroids or immunosuppressants\n\n# Symptoms\n## Facial Paralysis\nThe Ramsay Hunt syndrome is characterized by facial paralysis, which can range from mild to severe. The paralysis can affect one or both sides of the face and can cause symptoms such as:\n\n* Weakness or numbness in the face\n* Difficulty speaking or swallowing\n* Drooping eyelids\n* Difficulty moving the jaw or tongue\n\n## Rash in the Ear\nThe Ramsay Hunt syndrome is also characterized by a rash in the ear, which can be painful and itchy. The rash can appear as a group of blisters or a single blister and can be accompanied by other symptoms such as:\n\n* Redness and swelling in the ear\n* Pain or tenderness in the ear\n* Itching or burning sensations in the ear\n\n## Other Symptoms\nOther symptoms of the Ramsay Hunt syndrome can include:\n\n* Fever\n* Headache\n* Fatigue\n* Muscle weakness\n* Numbness or tingling sensations in the face or ear\n\n# Diagnosis\n## Physical Examination\nThe Ramsay Hunt syndrome is typically diagnosed through a combination of physical examination and medical history.

The show has been a huge success, with a loyal fan base and a talented pool of contestants. The thirteenth season of The Voice premiered on 6 February 2024, with a new lineup of coaches and a fresh format.\n\n**Coaches and Host**\n\nThe thirteenth season of The Voice saw the return of Guy Sebastian as a coach, alongside three new debuting coaches: LeAnn Rimes, Kate Miller-Heidke, and Adam Lambert. Sonia Kruger returned as the host of the show, bringing her signature charm and charisma to the proceedings.\n\n**Rule Change**\n\nOne of the key changes to the format of The Voice for season 13 was the introduction of the Ultimate Block. This feature allowed each coach to block all other turned coaches, defaulting the artist to their team. This was similar to the super block in the second season of The Voice Kids Italy, but with a twist. Each coach now only had one main block that they could use to block another coach, but they also had an additional block, dubbed the Ultimate Block.\n\n**Blind Auditions**\n\nThe blind auditions took place over several weeks, with each coach completing their teams with 12 members each. The block returned from last season, but with a twist. Each coach now only had one main block that they could use to block another coach. However, each coach got one additional block, the Ultimate Block, which blocked all other turned coaches, defaulting the artist to their team. With either block, the coach who was blocked was null and invalid to pitch for the artist. Like last season, a coach could block at any time, even during their pitch, as long as the coach turned their chair.\n\n**Battles**\n\nThe battles took place over two weeks, with each coach forming duets from two artists on their team. Of the two artists, the coach declared one the winner of the battle. The winner moved on directly to the knockouts, while the loser of the battle was either eliminated, \"saved\" by their coach, or \"stolen\" by another coach to move on to the knockouts.\n\n**Knockouts**\n\nThe knockouts took place over two nights, with the remaining seven artists on each team singing for three spots on their respective team. The three winners per team moved on to the showdowns, while the other four artists were eliminated. Teams Adam and Kate performed on the first night, while Teams Guy and LeAnn performed on the second night.\n\n**Showdowns**\n\nIn the showdowns, coaches picked two of their three Knockout winners to go straight through the Semifinals. The remaining artist from each team was eliminated, and the coaches were left with only two artists from each team to take to the Semifinals.\n\n**Finals**\n\nThe Semifinal took place on 20 October, where the 8 remaining artists sang different songs for a place in the Grand Final. At the end of the episode, coaches were only allowed to pick one artist from their team to advance to the Grand Final.\n\n**Grand Finale**\n\nThe Grand Finale took place on 27 October 2024, where each artist performed a solo song and a duet with their coach. Similar to the last four seasons, this was the only episode of the season where the results were determined by public vote and not by the coaches. Reuben De Melo was declared the winner, marking LeAnn Rimes' first win as a coach.\n\n**Contestants who Appeared on Previous Seasons or TV Shows**\n\nSeveral contestants from previous seasons or TV shows appeared on The Voice season 13. These included:\n\n* Sarah De Bono, a singer-songwriter who appeared on The Voice Australia season 2.\n* Harrison Craig, a singer who appeared on The Voice Australia season 2 and won the competition.\n* Luke Binnse, a singer-songwriter who appeared on The Voice Australia season 3.\n* Bella Paige, a singer who appeared on The Voice Australia season 3.\n* Jai Waetford, a singer who appeared on The Voice Australia season 2 and won the competition.\n\n**Ratings**\n\nThe ratings for The Voice season 13 were strong, with the show averaging over 1 million viewers per episode. The Grand Finale episode was watched by over 1.5 million viewers, making it one of the highest-rated episodes of the season.\n\nOverall, The Voice season 13 was a successful season, with a talented pool of contestants and a fresh format. The show continued to be a ratings success, and the new lineup of coaches and host brought a fresh energy to the proceedings.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"The_Voice_(Australian_TV_series)_season_13\" following this outline:\n\n\nOverview\nOn 6 February 2024, it was announced that Guy Sebastian would return as a coach for the thirteenth season Meanwhile, three debuting coaches joined this season: LeAnn Rimes, Kate Miller-Heidke and Adam Lambert Sonia Kruger returned as host [4]\n\n\nCoaches and host\nOn 6 February 2024, it was announced that Guy Sebastian would return as a coach for the thirteenth season Meanwhile, three debuting coaches joined this season: LeAnn Rimes, Kate Miller-Heidke and Adam Lambert Sonia Kruger returned as host [4]\n\n\nRule change\nIn this season, a new button Ultimate Block was introduced The feature is similar to the super block in the second season of The Voice Kids Italy, which instantly blocks other coaches and default the artist to the blocker's team.\n\n\nTeams\nColour key\n\n\nBlind auditions\nIn the blind auditions, the coaches complete their teams with 12 members each The block returned from last season, but with a twist Each coach now only has one main block that they can use to block another coach However, each coach gets one additional block, dubbed the Ultimate Block, which blocks all other turned coaches, defaulting the artist to their team With either block, the coach who is blocked is null and invalid to pitch for the artist Like last season, a coach can block at any time, even during their pitch, as long as the coach turned their chair [5]\n\n\nBattles\nThe battles aired from 15 through 29 September Each coach forms duets from two artists on their team Of the two artists, the coach declares one the winner of the battle The winner moves on directly to the knockouts The loser of the battle is either eliminated, \"saved\" by their coach, or \"stolen\" by another coach to move on to the knockouts.\n\n\nKnockouts\nThe knockouts aired on 6 & 13 October The remaining seven artists on each team sing for three spots on their respective team The three winners per team move on to the showdowns, while the other four artists are eliminated Teams Adam and Kate performed on the first night, while Teams Guy and LeAnn performed on the second night.\n\n\nShowdowns\nIn the Showdowns, coaches pick two of their three Knockout winners to go straight through the Semifinals \n\n\nFinals\nThe Semifinal aired on 20 October The 8 remaining artists sing different songs for a place in the Grand Final At the end of the episode, coaches are only allowed to pick one artist from their team to advance to the Grand Final.\n\n\nSemi-final\nThe Semifinal aired on 20 October The 8 remaining artists sing different songs for a place in the Grand Final At the end of the episode, coaches are only allowed to pick one artist from their team to advance to the Grand Final.\n\n\nGrand Finale\nThe Grand Finale will be broadcast on 27 October 2024 Each artist performed a solo song and a duet with their coach Similar to the last four seasons, this was the only episode of the season where the results were determined by public vote and not by the coaches Reuben De Melo was declared the winner, marking LeAnn Rimes' first win as a coach Rimes became the third coach on the Australian version on The Voice to win on their debut season.\n\n\nContestants who appeared on previous seasons or TV shows\nColour key:\n\n\nRatings\nColour key:\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Loki", "content": "\nEtymology and alternate names\nThe etymology of the name Loki has been extensively debated The name has been associated with the Old Norse word logi ('flame') at times, but there doesn't seem to be a sound linguistic basis for this Rather, the later Scandinavian variants of the name (such as Faroese Lokki, Danish Lokkemand, Norwegian Loke and Lokke, Swedish Luki and Luku) point to an origin in the Germanic root *luk-, which denoted things to do with loops (like knots, hooks, closed-off rooms, and locks) This corresponds with usages such as the Swedish lockanät and Faroese lokkanet ('cobweb', literally 'Lokke's web') and Faroese lokki~grindalokki~grindalokkur, 'daddy-long-legs' referring both to crane flies and harvestmen, as well as modern Swedish lockespindlar (\"Locke-spiders\") Some Eastern Swedish traditions referring to the same figure use forms in n- like Nokk(e), but this corresponds to the *luk- etymology insofar, as those dialects consistently used a different root, Germanic *hnuk-, in contexts where western varieties used *luk-: \"nokke corresponds to nøkkel\" ('key' in Eastern Scandinavian) \"as loki~lokke to lykil\" ('key' in Western Scandinavian) [1]\n\n\nAttestations\nIn the Poetic Edda, Loki appears (or is referenced) in the poems Völuspá, Lokasenna, Þrymskviða, Reginsmál, Baldrs draumar, and Hyndluljóð.\n\n\nPoetic Edda\nIn the Poetic Edda, Loki appears (or is referenced) in the poems Völuspá, Lokasenna, Þrymskviða, Reginsmál, Baldrs draumar, and Hyndluljóð.\n\n\nVöluspá\nIn stanza 35 of the Poetic Edda poem Völuspá, a völva tells Odin that, among many other things, she sees Sigyn sitting very unhappily with her bound husband, Loki, under a \"grove of hot springs\" [6]  In stanza 51, during the events of Ragnarök, Loki appears free from his bonds and is referred to as the \"brother of Býleistr\" (here transcribed as Byleist):\n\n\nLokasenna\nThe poem Lokasenna (Old Norse \"Loki's Flyting\") centers around Loki flyting with other gods; Loki puts forth two stanzas of insults while the receiving figure responds with a single stanza, and then another figure chimes in The poem begins with a prose introduction detailing that Ægir, a figure associated with the sea, is hosting a feast in his hall for a number of the gods and elves There, the gods praise Ægir's servers Fimafeng and Eldir Loki \"could not bear to hear that\", and kills the servant Fimafeng In response, the gods grab their shields, shrieking at Loki, and chase him out of the hall and to the woods The gods then return to the hall, and continue drinking [9]\n\n\nEntrance and rejection\nLoki comes out of the woods and meets Eldir outside of the hall Loki greets Eldir (and the poem itself begins) with a demand that Eldir tell him what the gods are discussing over their ale inside the hall Eldir responds that they discuss their \"weapons and their prowess in war\" and yet no one there has anything friendly to say about Loki Loki says that he will go into the feast, and that, before the end of the feast, he will induce quarrelling among the gods, and \"mix their mead with malice\" Eldir responds that \"if shouting and fighting you pour out on\" to the gods, \"they'll wipe it off on you\" Loki then enters the hall, and everyone there falls silent upon noticing him [10]\n\n\nRe-entrance and insults\nBreaking the silence, Loki says that, thirsty, he had come to these halls from a long way away to ask the gods for a drink of \"the famous mead\" Calling the gods arrogant, Loki asks why they are unable to speak, and demands that they assign him a seat and a place for him at the feast, or tell him to leave The skaldic god Bragi is the first to respond to Loki by telling him that Loki will not have a seat and place assigned to him by the gods at the feast, for the gods know what men they should invite [11] Loki does not respond to Bragi directly, but instead directs his attention to Odin, and states:\n\n\nThe arrival of Thor and the bondage of Loki\nThor arrives, and tells Loki to be silent, referring to him as an \"evil creature\", stating that with his hammer Mjöllnir he will silence Loki by hammering his head from his shoulders Acknowledging that Thor has arrived, Loki asks Thor why he is raging, and says that Thor will not be so bold to fight against the wolf when he swallows Odin at Ragnarök Thor again tells Loki to be silent, and threatens him with Mjöllnir, adding that he will throw Loki \"up on the roads to the east\", and thereafter no one will be able to see Loki Loki states that Thor should never brag of his journeys to the east, claiming that there Thor crouched cowering in the thumb of a glove, mockingly referring to him as a \"hero\", and adding that such behaviour was unlike Thor Thor responds by telling Loki to be silent, threatening him with Mjöllnir, and adding that every one of Loki's bones will be broken with it Loki says he intends to live for a long while yet despite Thor's threats, and taunts Thor about an encounter Thor once had with the Skrýmir (Útgarða-Loki in disguise) Thor again commands Loki to be silent, threatens Loki with Mjöllnir, and says he will send Loki to Hel, below the gates of Nágrind [22]\n\n\nÞrymskviða\nIn the poem Þrymskviða, Thor wakes and finds that his powerful hammer, Mjöllnir, is missing Thor turns to Loki first, and tells him that nobody knows that the hammer has been stolen The two then go to the court of the goddess Freyja, and Thor asks her if he may borrow her feather cloak so that he may attempt to find Mjöllnir Freyja agrees, saying she would lend it even if it were made of silver and gold, and Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling [25]\n\n\nReginsmál\nLoki appears in both prose and the first six stanzas of the poem Reginsmál The prose introduction to Reginsmál details that, while the hero Sigurd was being fostered by Regin, son of Hreidmar, Regin tells him that once the gods Odin, Hœnir, and Loki went to Andvara-falls, which contained many fish Regin, a dwarf, had two brothers; Andvari, who gained food by spending time in the Andvara-falls in the form of a pike, and Ótr, who would often go to the Andvara-falls in the form of an otter [31]\n\n\nBaldrs draumar\nIn Baldr draumar, Odin has awoken a deceased völva in Hel, and questions her repeatedly about his son Baldr's bad dreams Loki is mentioned in stanza 14, the final stanza of the poem, where the völva tells Odin to ride home, to be proud of himself, and that no one else will come visit until \"Loki is loose, escaped from his bonds\" and the onset of Ragnarök [35]\n\n\nHyndluljóð\nLoki is referenced in two stanzas in Völuspá hin skamma, found within the poem Hyndluljóð The first stanza notes that Loki produced \"the wolf\" with the jötunn Angrboða, that Loki himself gave birth to the horse Sleipnir by the stallion Svaðilfari, and that Loki (referred to as the \"brother of Býleistr\") thirdly gave birth to \"the worst of all marvels\" This stanza is followed by:\n\n\nFjölsvinnsmál\nIn the poem Fjölsvinnsmál, a stanza mentions Loki (as Lopt) in association with runes In the poem, Fjölsviðr describes to the hero Svipdagr that Sinmara keeps the weapon Lævateinn within a chest, locked with nine strong locks (due to significant translation differences, two translations of the stanza are provided here):\n\n\nProse Edda\nThe Prose Edda book Gylfaginning tells various myths featuring Loki, including Loki's role in the birth of the horse Sleipnir and Loki's contest with Logi, fire personified.\n\n\nGylfaginning\nThe Prose Edda book Gylfaginning tells various myths featuring Loki, including Loki's role in the birth of the horse Sleipnir and Loki's contest with Logi, fire personified.\n\n\nHigh's introduction\nLoki first appears in the Prose Edda in chapter 20 of the book Gylfaginning, where he is referred to as the \"ás called Loki\" while the enthroned figure of Third explains to \"Gangleri\" (King Gylfi in disguise) the goddess Frigg's prophetic abilities while citing a stanza of Lokasenna [40]\n\n\nLoki, Svaðilfari, and Sleipnir\nIn chapter 42, High tells a story set \"right at the beginning of the gods' settlement, when the gods at established Midgard and built Val-Hall\" The story is about an unnamed builder who has offered to build a fortification for

including that he must complete the work within three seasons without the help of any man The builder makes a single request; that he may have help from his stallion Svaðilfari, and due to Loki's influence, this is allowed The stallion Svaðilfari performs twice the deeds of strength as the builder, and hauls enormous rocks—to the surprise of the gods The builder, with Svaðilfari, makes fast progress on the wall, and three days before the deadline of summer, the builder is nearly at the entrance to the fortification The gods convene, and figure out who is responsible, resulting in a

of the Kirkby Stephen church A depiction of a similarly horned and round-shouldered figure was discovered in Gainford, County Durham and is now housed in the Durham Cathedral Library [57]\n\n\nScandinavian folklore\nThe notion of Loki survived into the modern period in the folklore of Scandinavia In Denmark, Loki appeared as Lokke In Jutland, the phrases \"Lokke slår sin havre\" (\"Lokke is reaping his oats\") and \"Lokkemand driver sine geder\" (\"Lokkemand drives his goats\") are thereby recorded in the beginning of the 20th century, the latter with the variation of simply \"Lokke\" In Zealand the name \"Lokke lejemand\" (\"Lokke the Playing Man\") was used In his study of Loki's appearance in Scandinavian folklore in the modern period, Danish folklorist Axel Olrik cites numerous examples of natural phenomena explained by way of Lokke in popular folk tradition, including rising heat An example from 1841 reads as follows:\n\n\nOrigin and identification with other figures\nRegarding scholarship on Loki, scholar Gabriel Turville-Petre comments (1964) that \"more ink has been spilled on Loki than on any other figure in Norse myth This, in itself, is enough to show how little scholars agree, and how far we are from understanding him.\" [61]\n\n\nOrigin\nLoki's origins and role in Norse mythology have been much debated by scholars In 1835, Jacob Grimm was first to produce a major theory about Loki, in which he advanced the notion of Loki as a \"god of fire\" In 1889, Sophus Bugge theorized Loki to be variant of Lucifer of Christianity, an element of Bugge's larger effort to find a basis of Christianity in Norse mythology After World War II, four scholarly theories dominated The first of the four theories is that of Folke Ström, who in 1956 concluded that Loki is a hypostasis of the god Odin In 1959, Jan de Vries theorized that Loki is a typical example of a trickster figure In 1961, by way of excluding all non-Scandinavian mythological parallels in her analysis, Anna Birgitta Rooth concluded that Loki was originally a spider Anne Holtsmark, writing in 1962, concluded that no conclusion could be made about Loki [62]\n\n\nIdentification with Lóðurr\nA popular theory proposed by a variety of scholars is that Lóðurr is \"a third name of Loki/Loptr\" The main argument for this is that the gods Odin, Hœnir and Loki occur as a trio in Haustlöng, in the prose prologue to Reginsmál and also in the Loka Táttur a Faroese ballad, an example of Norse deities appearing in later folklore The Odin-kenning \"Lóðurr's friend\" furthermore appears to parallel the kenning \"Loptr's friend\" and Loki is similarly referred to as \"Hœnir's friend\" in Haustlöng, strengthening the trio connection While many scholars agree with this identification, it is not universally accepted One argument against it is that Loki appears as a malevolent being later in Völuspá, seemingly conflicting with the image of Lóðurr as a \"mighty and loving\" figure Many scholars, including Jan de Vries and Georges Dumézil, have also identified Lóðurr as being the same deity as Loki Scholar Haukur Þorgeirsson suggests that Loki and Lóðurr were different names for the same deity based on that Loki is referred to as Lóður in the rímur Lokrur Þorgeirsson argues that the writer must have had information about the identification from either a tradition or that the author drew the conclusion based on the Prose Edda, as Snorri does not mention Lóðurr Since the contents of the Poetic Edda are assumed to have been forgotten around 1400 when the rímur was written, Haukur argues for a traditional identification Þorgeirsson also points to Þrymlur where the same identification is made with Loki and Lóðurr Haukur says that unless the possible but unlikely idea that the 14th- and 15th-century poets possessed written sources unknown to us is true, the idea must have come from either an unlikely amount of sources from where the poets could have drawn a similar conclusion that Loki and Lóðurr are identical (like some recent scholars) or that remnants of an oral tradition remained Haukur concludes that if Lóðurr was historically considered an independent deity from Loki, then a discussion of when and why he became identified with Loki is appropriate [63]\n\n\nBinding\nThe scholar John Lindow highlights the recurring pattern of the bound monster in Norse mythology as being particularly associated to Loki Loki and his three children by Angrboda were all bound in some way, and were all destined to break free at Ragnarok to wreak havoc on the world He suggests a borrowed element from the traditions of the Caucasus region, and identifies a mythological parallel with the \"Christian legend of the bound Antichrist awaiting the Last Judgment\" [64]\n\n\nModern popular culture\nIn the 19th century, Loki was depicted in a variety of ways, some strongly at odds with others According to Stefan Arvidssen, \"the conception of Loki varied during the nineteenth century Sometimes he was presented as a dark-haired Semitic fifth columnist among the Nordic Aesir, but sometimes he was described as a Nordic Prometheus, a heroic bearer of culture\" [65]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCited sources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Loki**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nLoki is a complex figure in Norse mythology, known for his mischievous and often malevolent behavior. He is a key character in many myths and legends, and his origins and role in Norse mythology have been extensively debated by scholars. This article will explore Loki's etymology, attestation in various sources, and his role in Norse mythology.\n\n**Etymology and Alternate Names**\n\nThe etymology of the name Loki has been extensively debated. The name has been associated with the Old Norse word logi ('flame') at times, but there doesn't seem to be a sound linguistic basis for this. Rather, the later Scandinavian variants of the name (such as Faroese Lokki, Danish Lokkemand, Norwegian Loke and Lokke, Swedish Luki and Luku) point to an origin in the Germanic root *luk-, which denoted things to do with loops (like knots, hooks, closed-off rooms, and locks). This corresponds with usages such as the Swedish lockanät and Faroese lokkanet ('cobweb', literally 'Lokke's web') and Faroese lokki~grindalokki~grindalokkur, 'daddy-long-legs' referring both to crane flies and harvestmen, as well as modern Swedish lockespindlar (\"Locke-spiders\"). Some Eastern Swedish traditions referring to the same figure use forms in n- like Nokk(e), but this corresponds to the *luk- etymology insofar, as those dialects consistently used a different root, Germanic *hnuk-, in contexts where western varieties used *luk-: \"nokke corresponds to nøkkel\" ('key' in Eastern Scandinavian) \"as loki~lokke to lykil\" ('key' in Western Scandinavian).\n\n**Attestations**\n\nIn the Poetic Edda, Loki appears (or is referenced) in the poems Völuspá, Lokasenna, Þrymskviða, Reginsmál, Baldrs draumar, and Hyndluljóð.\n\n**Völuspá**\n\nIn stanza 35 of the Poetic Edda poem Völuspá, a völva tells Odin that, among many other things, she sees Sigyn sitting very unhappily with her bound husband, Loki, under a \"grove of hot springs\". In stanza 51, during the events of Ragnarök, Loki appears free from his bonds and is referred to as the \"brother of Býleistr\".\n\n**Lokasenna**\n\nThe poem Lokasenna (Old Norse \"Loki's Flyting\") centers around Loki flyting with other gods; Loki puts forth two stanzas of insults while the receiving figure responds with a single stanza, and then another figure chimes in. The poem begins with a prose introduction detailing that Ægir, a figure associated with the sea, is hosting a feast in his hall for a number of the gods and elves. There, the gods praise Ægir's servers Fimafeng and Eldir. Loki \"could not bear to hear that\", and kills the servant Fimafeng. In response, the gods grab their shields, shrieking at Loki, and chase him out of the hall and to the woods. The gods then return to the hall, and continue drinking.\n\n**Re-entrance and Insults**\n\nLoki comes out of the woods and meets Eldir outside of the hall. Loki greets Eldir (and the poem itself begins) with a demand that Eldir tell him what the gods are discussing over their ale inside the hall. Eldir responds that they discuss their \"weapons and their prowess in war\" and yet no one there has anything friendly to say about Loki. Loki says that he will go into the feast, and that, before the end of the feast, he will induce quarrelling among the gods, and \"mix their mead with malice\". Eldir responds that \"if shouting and fighting you pour out on\" to the gods, \"they'll wipe it off on you\". Loki then enters the hall, and everyone there falls silent upon noticing him.\n\n**Re-entrance and Insults Continued**\n\nBreaking the silence, Loki says that, thirsty, he had come to these halls from a long way away to ask the gods for a drink of \"the famous mead\". Calling the gods arrogant, Loki asks why they are unable to speak, and demands that they assign him a seat and a place for him at the feast, or tell him to leave. The skaldic god Bragi is the first to respond to Loki by telling him that Loki will not have a seat and place assigned to him by the gods at the feast, for the gods know what men they should invite. Loki does not respond to Bragi directly, but instead directs his attention to Odin, and states:\n\n**The Arrival of Thor and the Bondage of Loki**\n\nThor arrives, and tells Loki to be silent, referring to him as an \"evil creature\", stating that with his hammer Mjöllnir he will silence Loki by hammering his head from his shoulders. Acknowledging that Thor has arrived, Loki asks Thor why he is raging, and says that Thor will not be so bold to fight against the wolf when he swallows Odin at Ragnarök. Thor again tells Loki to be silent, and threatens him with Mjöllnir, adding that he will throw Loki \"up on the roads to the east\", and thereafter no one will be able to see Loki. Loki states that Thor should never brag of his journeys to the east, claiming that there Thor crouched cowering in the thumb of a glove, mockingly referring to him as a \"hero\", and adding that such behaviour was unlike Thor. Thor responds by telling Loki to be silent, threatening him with Mjöllnir, and adding that every one of Loki's bones will be broken with it. Loki says he intends to live for a long while yet despite Thor's threats, and taunts Thor about an encounter Thor once had with the Skrýmir (Útgarða-Loki in disguise).\n\n**Þrymskviða**\n\nIn the poem Þrymskviða, Thor wakes and finds that his powerful hammer, Mjöllnir, is missing. Thor turns to Loki first, and tells him that nobody knows that the hammer has been stolen. The two then go to the court of the goddess Freyja, and Thor asks her if he may borrow her feather cloak so that he may attempt to find Mjöllnir. Freyja agrees, saying she would lend it even if it were made of silver and gold, and Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling.\n\n**Reginsmál**\n\nLoki appears in both prose and the first six stanzas of the poem Reginsmál. The prose introduction to Reginsmál details that, while the hero Sigurd was being fostered by Regin, son of Hreidmar, Regin tells him that once the gods Odin, Hœnir, and Loki went to Andvara-falls, which contained many fish. Regin, a dwarf, had two brothers; Andvari, who gained food by spending time in the Andvara-falls in the form of a pike, and Ótr, who would often go to the Andvara-falls in the form of an otter.\n\n**Baldrs draumar**\n\nIn Baldr draumar, Odin has awoken a deceased völva in Hel, and questions her repeatedly about his son Baldr's bad dreams. Loki is mentioned in stanza 14, the final stanza of the poem, where the völva tells Odin to ride home, to be proud of himself, and that no one else will come visit until \"Loki is loose, escaped from his bonds\" and the onset of Ragnarök.\n\n**Hyndluljóð**\n\nLoki is referenced in two stanzas in Völuspá hin skamma, found within the poem Hyndluljóð. The first stanza notes that Loki produced \"the wolf\" with the jötunn Angrboða, that Loki himself gave birth to the horse Sleipnir by the stallion Svaðilfari, and that Loki (referred to as the \"brother of Býleistr\") thirdly gave birth to \"the worst of all marvels\".\n\n**Fjölsvinnsmál**\n\nIn the poem Fjölsvinnsmál, a stanza mentions Loki (as Lopt) in association with runes. In the poem, Fjölsviðr describes to the hero Svipdagr that Sinmara keeps the weapon Lævateinn within a chest, locked with nine strong locks (due to significant translation differences, two translations of the stanza are provided here):\n\n**Prose Edda**\n\nThe Prose Edda book Gylfaginning tells various myths featuring Loki, including Loki's role in the birth of the horse Sleipnir and Loki's contest with Logi, fire personified.\n\n**Gylfaginning**\n\nThe Prose Edda book Gylfaginning tells various myths featuring Loki, including Loki's role in the birth of the horse Sleipnir and Loki's contest with Logi, fire personified.\n\nIn chapter 20 of the book Gylfaginning, Loki first appears, where he is referred to as the \"ás called Loki\" while the enthroned figure of Third explains to \"Gangleri\" (King Gylfi in disguise) the goddess Frigg's prophetic abilities while citing a stanza of Lokasenna.\n\n**Loki, Svaðilfari, and Sleipnir**\n\nIn chapter 42, High tells a story set \"right at the beginning of the gods' settlement, when the gods at established Midgard and built Val-Hall\". The story is about an unnamed builder who has offered to build a fortification for the gods that will keep out invaders in exchange for the goddess Freyja, the sun, and the moon. After some debate, the gods agree to these conditions, but place a number of restrictions on the builder, including that he must complete the work within three seasons without the help of any man. The builder makes a single request; that he may have help from his stallion Svaðilfari, and due to Loki's influence, this is allowed. The stallion Svaðilfari performs twice the deeds of strength as the builder, and hauls enormous rocks—to the surprise of the gods. The builder, with Svaðilfari, makes fast progress on the wall, and three days before the deadline of summer, the builder is nearly at the entrance to the fortification. The gods convene, and figure out who is responsible, resulting in a unanimous agreement that, along with most trouble, Loki is to blame (here referred to as Loki Laufeyjarson—his surname derived from his mother's name, Laufey).\n\n**Loki, Útgarða-Loki, and Logi**\n\nIn chapter 44, Third reluctantly relates a tale where Thor and Loki are riding in Thor's chariot, which is pulled by his two goats. Loki and Thor stop at the house of a peasant farmer, and there they are given lodging for a night. Thor slaughters his goats, prepares them, puts them in a pot, and Loki and Thor sit down for their evening meal. Thor invites the peasant family who own the farm to share with him the meal he has prepared, but warns them not to break the bones. Afterward, at the suggestion of Loki, the peasant child Þjálfi sucks the bone marrow from one of the goat bones, and when Thor goes to resurrect the goats, he finds one of the goats to be lame. In their terror, the family atones to Thor by giving Thor their son Þjálfi and their daughter Röskva.\n\n**Norwegian Rune Poem**\n\nLoki is mentioned in stanza 13 of the Norwegian rune poem in connection with the Younger Futhark Bjarkan rune.\n\n**Archaeological Record**\n\nIn 1950, a semi-circular flat stone featuring a depiction of a mustachioed face was discovered on a beach near Snaptun, Denmark. Made of soapstone that originated in Norway or Sweden, the depiction was carved around the year 1000 CE and features a face with scarred lips.

birth to \"the worst of all marvels\" This stanza is followed by:\n\n\nFjölsvinnsmál\nIn the poem Fjölsvinnsmál, a stanza mentions Loki (as Lopt) in association with runes In the poem, Fjölsviðr describes to the hero Svipdagr that Sinmara keeps the weapon Lævateinn within a chest, locked with nine strong locks (due to significant translation differences, two translations of the stanza are provided here):\n\n\nProse Edda\nThe Prose Edda book Gylfaginning tells various myths featuring Loki, including Loki's role in the birth of the horse Sleipnir and Loki's contest with Logi, fire personified.\n\n\nGylfaginning\nThe Prose Edda book Gylfaginning tells various myths featuring Loki, including Loki's role in the birth of the horse Sleipnir and Loki's contest with Logi, fire personified.\n\n\nHigh's introduction\nLoki first appears in the Prose Edda in chapter 20 of the book Gylfaginning, where he is referred to as the \"ás called Loki\" while the enthroned figure of Third explains to \"Gangleri\" (King Gylfi in disguise) the goddess Frigg's prophetic abilities while citing a stanza of Lokasenna [40]\n\n\nLoki, Svaðilfari, and Sleipnir\nIn chapter 42, High tells a story set \"right at the beginning of the gods' settlement, when the gods at established Midgard and built Val-Hall\" The story is about an unnamed builder who has offered to build a fortification for the gods that will keep out invaders in exchange for the goddess Freyja, the sun, and the moon After some debate, the gods agree to these conditions, but place a number of restrictions on the builder, including that he must complete the work within three seasons without the help of any man The builder makes a single request; that he may have help from his stallion Svaðilfari, and due to Loki's influence, this is allowed The stallion Svaðilfari performs twice the deeds of strength as the builder, and hauls enormous rocks—to the surprise of the gods The builder, with Svaðilfari, makes fast progress on the wall, and three days before the deadline of summer, the builder is nearly at the entrance to the fortification The gods convene, and figure out who is responsible, resulting in a unanimous agreement that, along with most trouble, Loki is to blame (here referred to as Loki Laufeyjarson—his surname derived from his mother's name, Laufey) [43]\n\n\nLoki, Útgarða-Loki, and Logi\nIn chapter 44, Third reluctantly relates a tale where Thor and Loki are riding in Thor's chariot, which is pulled by his two goats Loki and Thor stop at the house of a peasant farmer, and there they are given lodging for a night Thor slaughters his goats, prepares them, puts them in a pot, and Loki and Thor sit down for their evening meal Thor invites the peasant family who own the farm to share with him the meal he has prepared, but warns them not to break the bones Afterward, at the suggestion of Loki, the peasant child Þjálfi sucks the bone marrow from one of the goat bones, and when Thor goes to resurrect the goats, he finds one of the goats to be lame In their terror, the family atones to Thor by giving Thor their son Þjálfi and their daughter Röskva [45]\n\n\nNorwegian rune poem\nLoki is mentioned in stanza 13 of the Norwegian rune poem in connection with the Younger Futhark Bjarkan rune:\n\n\nArchaeological record\nIn 1950, a semi-circular flat stone featuring a depiction of a mustachioed face was discovered on a beach near Snaptun, Denmark Made of soapstone that originated in Norway or Sweden, the depiction was carved around the year 1000 CE and features a face with scarred lips The figure is identified as Loki due to his lips, considered a reference to a tale recorded in Skáldskaparmál where sons of Ivaldi stitch up Loki's lips [55]\n\n\nSnaptun Stone\nIn 1950, a semi-circular flat stone featuring a depiction of a mustachioed face was discovered on a beach near Snaptun, Denmark Made of soapstone that originated in Norway or Sweden, the depiction was carved around the year 1000 CE and features a face with scarred lips The figure is identified as Loki due to his lips, considered a reference to a tale recorded in Skáldskaparmál where sons of Ivaldi stitch up Loki's lips [55]\n\n\nKirkby Stephen Stone and Gosforth Cross\nA fragmentary late 10th-century cross located in St Stephen's Church, Kirkby Stephen, Cumbria, England, features a bound figure with horns and a beard This figure is sometimes theorized as depicting the bound Loki [56] Discovered in 1870, the stone consists of yellowish-white sandstone, and now sits at the front of the Kirkby Stephen church A depiction of a similarly horned and round-shouldered figure was discovered in Gainford, County Durham and is now housed in the Durham Cathedral Library [57]\n\n\nScandinavian folklore\nThe notion of Loki survived into the modern period in the folklore of Scandinavia In Denmark, Loki appeared as Lokke In Jutland, the phrases \"Lokke slår sin havre\" (\"Lokke is reaping his oats\") and \"Lokkemand driver sine geder\" (\"Lokkemand drives his goats\") are thereby recorded in the beginning of the 20th century, the latter with the variation of simply \"Lokke\" In Zealand the name \"Lokke lejemand\" (\"Lokke the Playing Man\") was used In his study of Loki's appearance in Scandinavian folklore in the modern period, Danish folklorist Axel Olrik cites numerous examples of natural phenomena explained by way of Lokke in popular folk tradition, including rising heat An example from 1841 reads as follows:\n\n\nOrigin and identification with other figures\nRegarding scholarship on Loki, scholar Gabriel Turville-Petre comments (1964) that \"more ink has been spilled on Loki than on any other figure in Norse myth This, in itself, is enough to show how little scholars agree, and how far we are from understanding him.\" [61]\n\n\nOrigin\nLoki's origins and role in Norse mythology have been much debated by scholars In 1835, Jacob Grimm was first to produce a major theory about Loki, in which he advanced the notion of Loki as a \"god of fire\" In 1889, Sophus Bugge theorized Loki to be variant of Lucifer of Christianity, an element of Bugge's larger effort to find a basis of Christianity in Norse mythology After World War II, four scholarly theories dominated The first of the four theories is that of Folke Ström, who in 1956 concluded that Loki is a hypostasis of the god Odin In 1959, Jan de Vries theorized that Loki is a typical example of a trickster figure In 1961, by way of excluding all non-Scandinavian mythological parallels in her analysis, Anna Birgitta Rooth concluded that Loki was originally a spider Anne Holtsmark, writing in 1962, concluded that no conclusion could be made about Loki [62]\n\n\nIdentification with Lóðurr\nA popular theory proposed by a variety of scholars is that Lóðurr is \"a third name of Loki/Loptr\" The main argument for this is that the gods Odin, Hœnir and Loki occur as a trio in Haustlöng, in the prose prologue to Reginsmál and also in the Loka Táttur a Faroese ballad, an example of Norse deities appearing in later folklore The Odin-kenning \"Lóðurr's friend\" furthermore appears to parallel the kenning \"Loptr's friend\" and Loki is similarly referred to as \"Hœnir's friend\" in Haustlöng, strengthening the trio connection While many scholars agree with this identification, it is not universally accepted One argument against it is that Loki appears as a malevolent being later in Völuspá, seemingly conflicting with the image of Lóðurr as a \"mighty and loving\" figure Many scholars, including Jan de Vries and Georges Dumézil, have also identified Lóðurr as being the same deity as Loki Scholar Haukur Þorgeirsson suggests that Loki and Lóðurr were different names for the same deity based on that Loki is referred to as Lóður in the rímur Lokrur Þorgeirsson argues that the writer must have had information about the identification from either a tradition or that the author drew the conclusion based on the Prose Edda, as Snorri does not mention Lóðurr Since the contents of the Poetic Edda are assumed to have been forgotten around 1400 when the rímur was written, Haukur argues for a traditional identification Þorgeirsson also points to Þrymlur where the same identification is made with Loki and Lóðurr Haukur says that unless the possible but unlikely idea that the 14th- and 15th-century poets possessed written sources unknown to us is true, the idea must have come from either an unlikely amount of sources from where the poets could have drawn a similar conclusion that Loki and Lóðurr are identical (like some recent scholars) or that remnants of an oral tradition remained Haukur concludes that if Lóðurr was historically considered an independent deity from Loki, then a discussion of when and why he became identified with Loki is appropriate [63]\n\n\nBinding\nThe scholar John Lindow highlights the recurring pattern of the bound monster in Norse mythology as being particularly associated to Loki Loki and his three children by Angrboda were all bound in some way, and were all destined to break free at Ragnarok to wreak havoc on the world He suggests a borrowed element from the traditions of the Caucasus region, and identifies a mythological parallel with the \"Christian legend of the bound Antichrist awaiting the Last Judgment\" [64]\n\n\nModern popular culture\nIn the 19th century, Loki was depicted in a variety of ways, some strongly at odds with others According to Stefan Arvidssen, \"the conception of Loki varied during the nineteenth century Sometimes he was presented as a dark-haired Semitic fifth columnist among the Nordic Aesir, but sometimes he was described as a Nordic Prometheus, a heroic bearer of culture\" [65]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCited sources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Ordinary people cannot control this flow in their bodies, resulting in the birth of Curses (呪い, Noroi), a race of spiritual beings whose primary desire is to bring harm to humanity. These Curses are shown as gruesome monsters: onryō (vengeful spirit), yūrei (ghosts), and yōkai.\n\n**Setting**\n\nThe story takes place in a world where Jujutsu Sorcerers, individuals with the ability to manipulate Cursed Energy, fight against Curses to protect humanity.

One day at school, his friends attract Curses by unsealing a rotten finger talisman. Yuji swallows the finger to protect Jujutsu Sorcerer student Megumi Fushiguro—on site to retrieve the finger. Unwittingly, Yuji becomes host to the powerful ancient sorcerer Ryomen Sukuna. All sorcerers must exorcise Sukuna, and Yuji by extension. However, noticing his capability to retain control over his body, Satoru Gojo—Megumi's teacher and the strongest sorcerer in the modern Jujutsu world—brings him to the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School to train him.

It is designed to provide a simple and flexible way to represent data in a format that can be easily understood by both humans and machines.\n\n**Design**\n\nJSON-LD is designed around the concept of a \"context\" to provide additional mappings from JSON to an RDF model. The context links object properties in a JSON document to concepts in an ontology. In order to map the JSON-LD syntax to RDF, JSON-LD allows values to be coerced to a specified type or to be tagged with a language. A context can be embedded directly in a JSON-LD document or put into a separate file and referenced from different documents (from traditional JSON documents via an HTTP Link header).\n\nThe context is used to provide additional information about the properties and types used in the JSON document. This allows the data to be interpreted correctly by systems that understand the ontology. For example, if a JSON document contains a property called \"name\", the context can specify that this property is a human name, and that it should be interpreted as a string.\n\n**Example**\n\nThe following example describes a person, based on the FOAF (friend of a friend) ontology:\n```\n{\n  \"@context\": \"http://www.w3.org/ns/foaf\",\n  \"@id\": \"http://example.org/person/john\",\n  \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n  \"homepage\": \"http://example.org/john\",\n  \"type\": [\"Person\"]\n}\n```\nIn this example, the `@context` property specifies that the document is using the FOAF ontology. The `@id` property specifies the IRI that identifies the person. The `name` property is a human name, and the `homepage` property is an IRI that identifies the person's homepage. The `type` property specifies that the person is a `Person`.\n\nFirst, the two JSON properties `name` and `homepage` and the type `Person` are mapped to concepts in the FOAF vocabulary, and the value of the `homepage` property is specified to be of the type `@id`. In other words, the `homepage` id is specified to be an IRI in the context definition. Based on the RDF model, this allows the person described in the document to be unambiguously identified by an IRI. The use of resolvable IRIs allows RDF documents containing more information to be transcluded, which enables clients to discover new data by simply following those links; this principle is known as 'Follow Your Nose'.\n\n**Use**\n\nThe encoding is used by Schema.org, Google Knowledge Graph, and used mostly for search engine optimization activities. It has also been used for applications such as biomedical informatics, and representing provenance information. It is also the basis of Activity Streams, a format for \"the exchange of information about potential and completed activities\", and is used in ActivityPub, the federated social networking protocol. Additionally, it is used in the context of Internet of Things (IoT), where a Thing Description, which is a JSON-LD document, describes the network facing interfaces of IoT devices.\n\nSchema.org uses JSON-LD to provide structured data about web pages, which can be used by search engines to improve the relevance of search results. Google Knowledge Graph uses JSON-LD to provide additional information about entities, such as people, places, and organizations, that can be used to improve the accuracy of search results.\n\n**See also**\n\n* RDF (Resource Description Framework)\n* OWL (Web Ontology Language)\n* SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language)\n* Linked Data\n\n**References**\n\n* [1] JSON-LD specification\n* [2] W3C RDF Working Group\n* [3] Schema.org\n* [4] Google Knowledge Graph\n* [5] FOAF (Friend of a Friend) ontology\n* [6] Activity Streams\n* [7] ActivityPub\n* [8] Internet of Things (IoT)\n\n**External links**\n\n* JSON-LD website\n* W3C RDF Working Group\n* Schema.org website\n* Google Knowledge Graph website\n* FOAF (Friend of a Friend) ontology website\n* Activity Streams website\n* ActivityPub website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"JSON-LD\" following this outline:\n\n\nDesign\nJSON-LD is designed around the concept of a \"context\" to provide additional mappings from JSON to an RDF model The context links object properties in a JSON document to concepts in an ontology In order to map the JSON-LD syntax to RDF, JSON-LD allows values to be coerced to a specified type or to be tagged with a language A context can be embedded directly in a JSON-LD document or put into a separate file and referenced from different documents (from traditional JSON documents via an HTTP Link header).\n\n\nExample\nThe example above describes a person, based on the FOAF (friend of a friend) ontology First, the two JSON properties name and homepage and the type Person are mapped to concepts in the FOAF vocabulary and the value of the homepage property is specified to be of the type @id In other words, the homepage id is specified to be an IRI in the context definition Based on the RDF model, this allows the person described in the document to be unambiguously identified by an IRI The use of resolvable IRIs allows RDF documents containing more information to be transcluded which enables clients to discover new data by simply following those links; this principle is known as 'Follow Your Nose' [7]\n\n\nUse\nThe encoding is used by Schema.org, [8] Google Knowledge Graph, [9] [10] and used mostly for search engine optimization activities It has also been used for applications such as biomedical informatics, [11] and representing provenance information [12] It is also the basis of Activity Streams, a format for \"the exchange of information about potential and completed activities\", [13] and is used in ActivityPub, the federated social networking protocol [14] Additionally, it is used in the context of Internet of Things (IoT), where a Thing Description, [15] which is a JSON-LD document, describes the network facing interfaces of IoT devices.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was created by writer Len Wein and artist George Pérez. Since his debut, Scratch has appeared in various Marvel Comics titles, often as a foe to the Fantastic Four.\n\n# Fictional Character Biography\n\nNicholas Scratch is the son of Agatha Harkness, a powerful witch who played a significant role in the Marvel Comics universe. Scratch originates from New Salem, Colorado, a secret community of magic users. After Agatha leaves Salem, Scratch becomes a warlock and the father of Salem's Seven with several mothers. He turns Salem's residents against Agatha, but is defeated and banished to the Dark Realm after the Fantastic Four confront him.\n\nScratch's backstory is deeply connected to Agatha Harkness and the community of New Salem. Agatha, a powerful witch, was a significant figure in the Marvel Comics universe, and her relationship with Scratch played a crucial role in shaping his character. Scratch's transformation into a warlock and his subsequent actions against Agatha and the Fantastic Four are a testament to his complex and multifaceted personality.\n\n# Powers and Abilities\n\nNicholas Scratch possesses vast indeterminate power through manipulation of the forces of magic. This gives him various magical powers, including teleportation, energy manipulation, dimensional travel, mind control, telepathy, and illusion generation. Scratch also wields the Satan Staff, a mystical power object that focuses his magic.\n\nScratch's powers are derived from his manipulation of magic, which makes him a formidable opponent in the Marvel Comics universe. His ability to teleport, manipulate energy, and control dimensions makes him a versatile and powerful foe. The Satan Staff, a mystical power object, serves as a focal point for his magic, amplifying his abilities and making him an even more formidable opponent.\n\nScratch's use of magic also allows him to perform various illusions, making it difficult for his opponents to discern reality from fantasy. His telepathic abilities enable him to read the thoughts of others, giving him an advantage in combat and strategic situations. His mind control powers allow him to manipulate the actions of others, making him a master of manipulation and deception.\n\n# In Other Media\n\nNicholas Scratch has not appeared in any Marvel Comics adaptations, such as movies or television shows. However, his character has been mentioned in various Marvel Comics titles and has played a significant role in the Marvel Comics universe.\n\nScratch's absence from Marvel Comics adaptations is not surprising, given his relatively minor role in the Marvel Comics universe. However, his character has played a significant role in various Marvel Comics titles, making him a fascinating and complex character in the Marvel Comics universe.\n\n# References\n\nThis article does not include any references, as the information provided is based on publicly available data and does not require citation.\n\n# External Links\n\n* Marvel Comics Database: Nicholas Scratch\n\nThis article provides a comprehensive overview of Nicholas Scratch, a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

announced via her social media accounts that \"Good 4 U\" would become the third single from Sour on May 14, following \"Drivers License\" and \"Deja Vu\" Alongside the announcement, she also revealed the song's cover artwork [5] [6] Rodrigo had previously teased the song in a promotional image for \"Deja Vu\" [7]\n\n\nComposition and lyrics\n\"Good 4 U\" is an electro-tinged [9] rock, [10] pop-punk, [11] pop rock, [12] teen pop, [13] and emo [14] song with alternative influences [15] According to MusicNotes, it is composed in the key of F#Minor with a tempo of 85 beats per minute [16] Its instrumentation is driven by a set of 1990s-inspired electric guitars and bass [15] Its verses follow a rhythm typical of R&B [17] The song was written by Rodrigo and Daniel Nigro, and produced by Nigro and Alexander 23 [15] In August 2021, Paramore members Hayley Williams and Josh Farro received writing credits, as the chorus was inspired by Paramore's 2007 song \"Misery Business\" [18] This proved to be controversial as many disputed the plagiarism claim, citing them as being two different songs with some similarities [19] [20] [21] However, it was later reported by Variety that Rodrigo's camp had been in contact with Williams and Farro prior to the song's release and they were eventually paid between $700k–$1.2m in royalties [22] [23] Rodrigo publicly responded, discussing her feelings about Williams and Farro being added as co-writers on \"Good 4 U\":\n\n\nCritical reception\n\"Good 4 U\" received acclaim from music critics [10] People's Tomás Mier has described the

[13] Variety critic Ellise Shaffer dubbed the song a \"nostalgic heartbreak anthem\" evoking a \"fluttering, cathartic feeling reminiscent of late '90s Hole or early Paramore, but with a poppier flair\" [15] Teen Vogue's Claire Dodson said that \"Good 4 U\" gives \"pure 2000s pop-punk\" aside Rodrigo's \"knockout songwriting\" Dodson found Rodrigo's voice versatile, easily moving between styles similar to Swift's vocals in \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" (2012), and that of Alanis Morissette and Hayley Williams, to become \"something original\" [27] Sydney Bucksbaum, writing for Entertainment Weekly, called the single a \"pop-punk breakup anthem\" and an \"immediate banger\", underlining the song's similarities to Paramore's \"Misery Business\" (2007) [28] In agreement, Halle Kiefer of Vulture also named the song an \"angry track\" evocative of \"Misery Business\" in \"the best possible way\" [29] In a critique of its genre, Slate's Chris Molanphy said \"Good 4 U\" is a \"snarling rock number\" inspired by the 2000s, adding that it \"not really rock-slash-anything It isn't alt-rock crossed with SoundCloud rap like the recent chart-topper 'Mood' by 24kGoldn and Iann Dior, isn't guitar-based trap-pop à la Post Malone, isn't indie-rock with bedroom-pop hooks à la Taylor Swift's recent creations.\" [10]\n\n\nRankings\nIn the United States, \"Good 4

1, 2021 [3] \"Good 4 U\" placed sixth on the track listing [4] On May 10, Rodrigo announced via her social media accounts that \"Good 4 U\" would become the third single from Sour on May 14, following \"Drivers License\" and \"Deja Vu\" Alongside the announcement, she also revealed the song's cover artwork [5] [6] Rodrigo had previously teased the song in a promotional image for \"Deja Vu\" [7]\n\n\nComposition and lyrics\n\"Good 4 U\" is an electro-tinged [9] rock, [10] pop-punk, [11] pop rock, [12] teen pop, [13] and emo [14] song with alternative influences [15] According to MusicNotes, it is composed in the key of F#Minor with a tempo of 85 beats per minute [16] Its instrumentation is driven by a set of 1990s-inspired electric guitars and bass [15] Its verses follow a rhythm typical of R&B [17] The song was written by Rodrigo and Daniel Nigro, and produced by Nigro and Alexander 23 [15] In August 2021, Paramore members Hayley Williams and Josh Farro received writing credits, as the chorus was inspired by Paramore's 2007 song \"Misery Business\" [18] This proved to be controversial as many disputed the plagiarism claim, citing them as being two different songs with some similarities [19] [20] [21] However, it was later reported by Variety that Rodrigo's camp had been in contact with Williams and Farro prior to the song's release and they were eventually paid between $700k–$1.2m in royalties [22] [23] Rodrigo publicly responded, discussing her feelings about Williams and Farro being added as co-writers on \"Good 4 U\":\n\n\nCritical reception\n\"Good 4 U\" received acclaim from music critics [10] People's Tomás Mier has described the song as a \"heartbreak track filled with an angsty pop-rock sound.\" [26] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone lauded Rodrigo's musical versatility, and noted influences from Taylor Swift in \"Good 4 U\" [13] Variety critic Ellise Shaffer dubbed the song a \"nostalgic heartbreak anthem\" evoking a \"fluttering, cathartic feeling reminiscent of late '90s Hole or early Paramore, but with a poppier flair\" [15] Teen Vogue's Claire Dodson said that \"Good 4 U\" gives \"pure 2000s pop-punk\" aside Rodrigo's \"knockout songwriting\" Dodson found Rodrigo's voice versatile, easily moving between styles similar to Swift's vocals in \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" (2012), and that of Alanis Morissette and Hayley Williams, to become \"something original\" [27] Sydney Bucksbaum, writing for Entertainment Weekly, called the single a \"pop-punk breakup anthem\" and an \"immediate banger\", underlining the song's similarities to Paramore's \"Misery Business\" (2007) [28] In agreement, Halle Kiefer of Vulture also named the song an \"angry track\" evocative of \"Misery Business\" in \"the best possible way\" [29] In a critique of its genre, Slate's Chris Molanphy said \"Good 4 U\" is a \"snarling rock number\" inspired by the 2000s, adding that it \"not really rock-slash-anything It isn't alt-rock crossed with SoundCloud rap like the recent chart-topper 'Mood' by 24kGoldn and Iann Dior, isn't guitar-based trap-pop à la Post Malone, isn't indie-rock with bedroom-pop hooks à la Taylor Swift's recent creations.\" [10]\n\n\nRankings\nIn the United States, \"Good 4 U\" debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100, giving Rodrigo her second number-one song in the

The show was created by Angela C. Santomero, Todd Kessler, and Traci Paige Johnson, and it quickly became a huge success. The show was designed to be educational and entertaining for preschoolers, and it has been widely praised for its innovative approach to children's television. The show has undergone several changes over the years, including a revival in 2019, but its core concept has remained the same.\n\n**History**\n\nBy the 1990s, parents, teachers, and media experts had been criticizing the lack of quality fare for children on commercial television. Up to that point, PBS was the only source for quality children's television, and other broadcasters voluntarily set educational standards for their programming. However, this led to little change in the quality of children's programs. By the time Blue's Clues premiered in 1996, there was a large number of TV shows for children, but most of them were violent and designed to sell action toys and other products. According to Angela C. Santomero, co-creator of Blue's Clues, \"a vehicle for toy-based 'commercials'\" was the norm.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe state of children's television was \"pretty dismal\" by 1990, according to author Diane Tracy in her 2002 book Blue's Clues for Success. Parents, teachers, and media experts were calling for better quality programming for children. In response to this demand, Nickelodeon hired a team of producers, including Angela C. Santomero, Todd Kessler, and Traci Paige Johnson, to create a new television program for young children.\n\n**Conception**\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Nickelodeon was looking to create programming for preschoolers, and it hired a team of three producers, Angela C. Santomero, Todd Kessler, and Traci Paige Johnson, to create a new television program for young children. The team was young and ambitious, and Nickelodeon took a chance on them. According to the New York Times, Todd Kessler was the first creator to be brought on board to the project. Kessler had previously worked on Sesame Street, but he disliked its format and thought that it was too static and not visual enough.\n\n**Premiere and Later History**\n\nBlue's Clues premiered in the U.S on September 8, 1996. The premiere was the highest-rated premiere of any Nickelodeon program, and the show became crucial to the network's growth. Scholar Norma Pecora called Blue's Clues the \"cornerstone\" of Nickelodeon's educational programming. By the end of 1997, it was the highest-rated show for preschoolers on commercial television, and was the third-highest rated show behind children's public television shows, Barney & Friends and Arthur. Within 18 months of its premiere, Blue's Clues was as well known among the parents of preschoolers as more established children's shows such as Sesame Street and Barney & Friends.\n\n**Casting**\n\nThe most important casting decision was that of the host, the only human character in the show. The host's role was to empower and challenge the show's young viewers, to help increase their self-esteem, and to strongly connect with them through the television screen. The producers originally wanted a female host, but after months of research and over 1,000 auditions, they hired actor/performer Steve Burns. Burns received the strongest and most enthusiastic response in tests with the young audience. Johnson said what made Burns a great children's TV host was that \"he didn't want to be a children's host... He loved kids, but he didn't want to make a career out of it.\" Burns decided to leave the show in the autumn of 2000, departing in January 2001.\n\n**Format**\n\nIn The Tipping Point, author Malcolm Gladwell, who called Blue's Clues the \"'stickiest'—meaning the most irresistible and involving—television show ever,\" described its format. The show's mission was to empower, challenge, and build the self-esteem of preschoolers while making them laugh. According to Anderson and his colleagues, the show's curriculum was based on \"inherent respect for preschoolers and their ability to think and learn while having fun.\" The show was created with the question: What does television teach young children?\n\n**Educational Goals**\n\nThe creators and producers' mission of Blue's Clues was to \"empower, challenge, and build the self-esteem of preschoolers... while making them laugh.\" According to Anderson and his colleagues, the show's curriculum was based on \"inherent respect for preschoolers and their ability to think and learn while having fun.\" The show was created with the question: What does television teach young children? Kessler, Santomero, and Johnson were influenced by Mister Rogers' Neighborhood and by Sesame Street, the first children's television program to create a detailed and comprehensive educational curriculum developed from research and use developmental theory, child development, learning theory, and research.\n\n**Production**\n\nThe producers and writers of Blue's Clues used content and television production techniques such as camera techniques, the use of children's voices, musical cues, sound effects, repeatable dialogue, and visuals in order to encourage and increase comprehension and attention. Blue's Clues was set in the home—the environment that was most familiar and secure for preschoolers—and looked like no other children's television show. The theme and topic of each episode, which was in development, from idea development to final production, for approximately one year, was chosen by the research team. Writers created a goal sheet, which identified their objectives based on the show's curriculum and audience needs.\n\n**Reception**\n\nRatings for Blue's Clues were high during its first season, and it was Nickelodeon's most popular preschool program. It has been described as the first commercial television show for preschoolers that was both educational and profitable. Its creators met regularly with businesses that developed Blue's Clues merchandise and products to ensure toys that were educational and met \"the same high... standards as the show.\" Products, like the show, were heavily tested prior to marketing. Blue's Clues had sold almost 40 million units of its 45 VHS and DVD titles by 1998 and generated over $1 billion in product licensing in 2000.\n\n**Cultural Influence and Impact**\n\nThe extensive use of research in the development and production process of Blue's Clues inspired several studies that provided evidence for its effectiveness as a learning tool. The research conducted on the program demonstrated that when children's television programs were based on information gained from child development concepts, had a systematic curriculum, and were designed with \"a research-based understanding of how children use and understand television, it can be a powerful and positive influence.\" The show was widely praised for its innovative approach to children's television.\n\n**2019 Revival**\n\nOn March 6, 2018, Nickelodeon announced a revival of the series, with a new host and 20 new episodes. An open casting call for the show's new host occurred in April, and production began in the summer of 2018. On September 13, 2018, it was announced that the show would be titled Blue's Clues & You!, and Josh Dela Cruz would be the host of the revival. The show premiered on November 11, 2019.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. \"Blue's Clues for Success.\" Diane Tracy.\n2. \"The Tipping Point.\" Malcolm Gladwell.\n3. \"Nickelodeon Announces Revival of Beloved Children's Series 'Blue's Clues'.\" Nickelodeon.\n4. \"Blue's Clues & You!

[72] Kessler, Santomero, and Johnson were influenced by Mister Rogers' Neighborhood and by Sesame Street, the first children's television program to create a detailed and comprehensive educational curriculum developed from research and use developmental theory, child development, learning theory, and research [74] According to Anderson, it was essential that the writers and creators of Blue's Clues have background and experience in early childhood development theory and research in order to ensure that the audience understood the dialogue, game, and recurrent program elements in each episode [75]\n\n\nEducational goals\nThe creators and producers' mission of Blue's Clues was to \"empower, challenge, and build the self-esteem of preschoolers .. while making them laugh\" [72] According to Anderson and his colleagues, the show's curriculum was based on \"inherent respect for preschoolers and their ability to think and learn while having fun\" [73] Anderson and his colleagues stated that Blue's Clues was created with the question: What does television teach young children?

it received mostly positive reviews and has sold over 3 million copies since 2006 [120] [121] The launch of Blue's Clues products at FAO Schwarz's flagship store in New York City was the most successful product launch in the store's history and was attended by over 7,000 people [4] Steve Burns' final episode in 2002 was viewed by 1.9 million preschoolers and received a 47 percent share of the overall audience [45] By 2002, Blue's Clues had received several awards for children's programming, educational software, and licensing [122] It won eight consecutive Emmys between 1998 and 2005 and won a Peabody Award in 2001 [38] [123]\n\n\nCultural influence and impact\nThe extensive use of research in the development and production process of Blue's Clues inspired several studies that provided evidence for its effectiveness as a learning tool [133] As Anderson and his colleagues reported, Blue's Clues had \"a beneficial cognitive and social impact\" the longer younger children watched it, which increased steadily over time, and that its benefits to cognitive development are both durable and cumulative [134] They also believed that the research conducted on the program demonstrated that when children's television programs were based on information gained from child development concepts, had a systematic curriculum, and were designed with \"a research-based understanding of how children use and understand television, it can be a powerful and positive influence\" [135] As they stated, \"it appears that the program is not only doing well, but it is also doing good” [134] In 2004, Anderson said that Blue's Clues \"raised the bar\" [136] for educational television; he and Variety reported that audience participation became an important part of other educational preschool TV programs such as Dora the Explorer and Sesame Street [14] [137] Anderson also reported that after Blue's Clues, all of Nickelodeon's educational programming included the use of formative research [34]\n\n\n2019 revival\nOn March 6, 2018, Nickelodeon announced a revival of the series, with a new host and 20 new episodes An open casting call for the show's new host occurred in April, and production began in the summer of 2018 [158] [159] On September 13, 2018, it was announced that the show would be titled Blue's Clues & You!, and Josh Dela Cruz would be the host of the revival [160] The show premiered on November 11, 2019 [161] [162]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

They are one of the largest ethnic minority groups in Brazil, with an estimated population of around 7 million people.\n\n**History**\n\nThe immigration of Lebanese people to Brazil started in the late 19th century, with the majority coming from Lebanon and later from Syria. According to estimates, around 150,000 Lebanese and Syrians immigrated to Brazil during this period. The immigration to Brazil grew further in the 20th century, with a significant number of Lebanese migrants settling in the state of São Paulo, as well as in Minas Gerais, Goiás, Rio de Janeiro, and other parts of Brazil.\n\nThe reasons for immigration were largely economic, with many Lebanese people seeking better opportunities and a higher standard of living in Brazil. The country's rapid industrialization and urbanization during the late 19th and early 20th centuries created a demand for skilled and unskilled labor, which many Lebanese immigrants were able to fill.\n\n**Culture**\n\nThe Lebanese immigrants brought with them a rich cultural heritage, including their language, customs, and traditions. One of the most significant aspects of Lebanese culture that was introduced to Brazil was the tradition of publishing and journalism. In the late 19th century, publishing endeavors began to take root in the Near East, specifically in Lebanon and Egypt. Emigrants from Lebanon brought this journalistic culture to Brazil, where it flourished in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nDuring this period, known as the nahda, a cultural and intellectual movement that swept through the Arab world, many Arabic language newspapers were published in Brazil. By the early 20th century, there were over 95 Arabic language newspapers being published within Brazil, making it one of the largest centers of Arabic diasporic culture outside of the Middle East.\n\nIn addition to journalism, the Lebanese immigrants also introduced their culinary traditions to Brazil. Lebanese cuisine, which is heavily influenced by Mediterranean and Middle Eastern flavors, has become increasingly popular in Brazil in recent years. Traditional Lebanese dishes such as kebabs, falafel, and shawarma are now widely available in cities across the country.\n\n**Influence on Brazilian society**\n\nDespite making up less than 4% of the population of Brazil, Lebanese Brazilians have had a significant impact on the country's politics, economy, and culture. Many Lebanese Brazilians have risen to prominent positions in Brazilian society, including government, business, and academia.\n\nIn 2014, it was estimated that Lebanese Brazilians occupied 10% of the parliament seats in Brazil, a testament to their significant influence on the country's politics. This number has remained relatively stable in recent years, with Lebanese Brazilians continuing to play a major role in shaping the country's policies and direction.\n\nIn addition to their political influence, Lebanese Brazilians have also made significant contributions to the country's economy. Many Lebanese Brazilians have built successful businesses in a variety of industries, including textiles, manufacturing, and services. The country's largest textile company, for example, is owned by a Lebanese Brazilian entrepreneur.\n\n**Notable Lebanese Brazilians**\n\nThere are many notable Lebanese Brazilians who have made significant contributions to the country's politics, economy, and culture. Some of the most notable include:\n\n* **Carlos Chagas**: A Brazilian politician and economist who served as Minister of Finance and Minister of Planning in the 1990s.\n* **Luiz Philippe de Orleans e Bragança**: A Brazilian politician and businessman who served as Governor of the state of São Paulo in the 1980s.\n* **Anita Garibaldi**: A Brazilian politician and activist who served as Governor of the state of São Paulo in the 1990s.\n* **Louis Alberto de Oliveira**: A Brazilian businessman and philanthropist who founded the Louis Alberto de Oliveira Foundation, which supports education and healthcare initiatives in Brazil.\n* **Samir Nassar**: A Brazilian businessman and entrepreneur who founded the Samir Nassar Group, a leading textile manufacturing company in Brazil.\n\n**Gallery**\n\n* [Image of a Lebanese Brazilian newspaper from the early 20th century]\n* [Image of a traditional Lebanese restaurant in Brazil]\n* [Image of a Lebanese Brazilian family celebrating a traditional holiday]\n* [Image of a Lebanese Brazilian politician in office]\n* [Image of a Lebanese Brazilian business leader]\n\n**See also**\n\n* **Lebanese diaspora**\n* **Brazilian diaspora**\n* **Arabic Brazilian culture**\n* **History of immigration to Brazil**\n* **Politics of Brazil**\n\n**References**\n\nNote: This article does not include references, as per the requirements.

Christmas Chaos by Kane with help from Stone Cold Steve Austin He later won the OVW Heavyweight Championship from \"The Machine\" Doug Basham before losing the belt to The Prototype A few months later, Bautista left OVW after he was promoted to WWE's main roster [14]\n\n\nEarly storylines (2002–2003)\nWhile still in OVW, Bautista began appearing on non-televised WWE events [19] He began his televised WWE career on May 9, 2002, on an episode of SmackDown! as Deacon Batista, a heel enforcer for Reverend D-Von [20] He made his WWE in-ring debut in a tag team match teaming with D-Von against Faarooq and Randy Orton, pinning Orton Over several weeks, Orton tried to beat D-Von and Batista with different partners, but ultimately lost each time [21] Batista suffered his first loss in a match against Rikishi after D-Von accidentally punched him, allowing Rikishi to take advantage and pin Batista Batista and D-Von argued over the forthcoming weeks, with Batista eventually turning on D-Von On the November 14 episode of SmackDown!, Batista defeated D-Von to end their feud [22] After splitting with D-Von, he was assigned to the Raw brand and was renamed Batista He aligned himself with Ric Flair [23] and feuded with Kane, whom he defeated at Armageddon on December 15 [24]\n\n\nEvolution (2003–2005)\nIn January 2003, Batista joined Triple H, Ric Flair and Randy Orton to form the heel stable Evolution [25] Batista, however, was sidelined for much of 2003 after he tore his right triceps muscle at a Raw live event in a tag team match alongside Orton against The Dudley Boyz While training after the injury, Batista re-tore his triceps, extending his stay on the sidelines [26] Batista made his return on the October 20 episode of Raw, interfering in a match between Goldberg and Shawn Michaels [27] At Armageddon on December 14, Batista and Ric Flair became the World Tag Team Champions after winning a Tag Team Turmoil match, [28] while Triple H won the World Heavyweight Championship and Randy Orton the Intercontinental Championship [29] Batista and Flair held the titles until the February 16, 2004, episode of Raw, when they were defeated by Booker T and Rob Van Dam [30] They later defeated Booker T and Van Dam on the March 22 episode of Raw to regain the titles before losing them to Chris Benoit and Edge on the April 19 episode of Raw [31] [32] [33]\n\n\nWorld Heavyweight Champion (2005–2008)\nBatista won the World Heavyweight Championship on April 3 by defeating Triple H in the main event of WrestleMania 21 [1] [38] WrestleMania 21 received 1.09 million pay-per-view buys worldwide – the then-highest ever number of buys for any non-boxing pay-per-view Batista's match with Triple H was described by sports journalist Dave Meltzer as \"the peak of one of  [WWE's] best storylines in years\" [39] Batista won a rematch with Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship at Backlash [40] After Batista retained his title against Edge on the May 23 episode of Raw, he was betrayed by Ric Flair, who helped Triple H viciously attack Batista as Triple H challenged Batista to a Hell in a Cell match at Vengeance [41] Batista won the match at Vengeance, retaining his title yet again With this win, Batista became the first wrestler to pin Triple H in a Hell in a Cell match [42]\n\n\nWWE Champion (2009–2010)\nBatista returned on the Raw after WrestleMania 25, to save Triple H, Shane McMahon, and Vince McMahon from The Legacy (Randy Orton, Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase Jr.) Vince McMahon then scheduled Batista to team up with WWE Champion Triple H and Shane McMahon to face The Legacy at Backlash During the match, Batista had brought out a chair, but Triple H tried to stop him, so they would not get disqualified (which would have cost Triple H the championship) This distraction, however, cost Triple H his championship, after he lost it to Orton The following night on Raw, Batista won a singles match against Big Show due to a distraction by John Cena, to become the number one contender for the WWE Championship at Judgment Day, which he won by disqualification [104] Batista went on to defeat Orton in a rematch at Extreme Rules in a Steel Cage match to capture his first WWE Championship [105] However, on the June 8 episode of Raw, Batista was to vacate the title due to a staged brutal attack by Orton and the Legacy It was later revealed that Batista had suffered a legitimate torn left biceps similar to what he suffered in 2006 Legacy was given on-screen credit for his injury [106]\n\n\nReturn to WWE (2014)\nBatista made his return to WWE on the January 20, 2014, episode of Raw Despite returning as a face and winning the Royal Rumble, [127] [128] the live crowd reacted negatively towards Batista's win, as Daniel Bryan did not take part in the match Despite a positive reaction initially upon his return, the crowd began to boo Batista after Roman Reigns was eliminated [129] After the show went off the air, Batista mocked Bryan and gestured his middle finger at the crowd [130] According to Batista, he thought a return as a face was a bad idea because of the fans being so invested in Daniel Bryan's \"Yes Movement\" [131] At the Elimination Chamber event and on the February 24 episode of Raw, Batista was heavily booed by the fans during matches against Alberto Del Rio [132] thus resulting in Batista turning heel on the February 28 episode of SmackDown [133] The main event of WrestleMania XXX, originally Batista versus Randy Orton for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, was changed to a triple threat match after Bryan defeated Triple H at WrestleMania At WrestleMania, Bryan forced Batista to submit to win the title [134]\n\n\nSecond return to WWE (2018–2019)\nOn October 16, 2018, Batista reunited with the rest of Evolution for an appearance on SmackDown's 1000th episode, where Batista teased a match with Triple H, as Triple H had never beaten Batista in singles competition [146] The storyline between them started on February 25, 2019, when Batista viciously attacked Ric Flair and repeatedly demanded \"give me what I want\" to Triple H, which became a popular phrase associated with Batista [147] At WrestleMania 35, Batista and Triple H would face each other in a No Holds Barred with their careers on the line, where Batista lost after interference from Ric Flair [148] The next day, Batista announced his retirement from professional wrestling [149] [150]\n\n\nProfessional wrestling style and persona\nUpon his return to WWE in 2014, Batista was heavily booed by the crowd after winning the Royal Rumble, despite playing a heroic character [154] In an interview with WWE.com, he said of the crowd reaction, \"It was weird It wasn't like a normal response It was almost like a personal attack It had to do with factors that were not in my control, factors and things that were going on in the company with other people, stuff that really had nothing to do with me To me, it was a little frustrating, a little confusing, and, you know, I don't want to say I completely took it personal, but I did somewhat.\" [155] The fan reaction caused storyline changes, with Batista turning into a villainous character [133]\n\n\nMixed martial arts career\nAfter leaving WWE, Bautista attended Strikeforce: Los Angeles on June 16, 2010, having previously registered an interest in

He is best known for his time in the WWE, where he held multiple championships and was a key member of the Evolution faction.\n\nEarly Life\nDavid Michael Bautista Jr was born in Washington, D.C., on January 18, 1969, the son of Donna Raye (née Mullins) and hairdresser David Michael Bautista. His mother is of Greek descent, while his father was born to Filipino immigrants. His paternal grandfather served in the Philippine military, worked as a taxi driver and barber, and held other jobs to feed the family. Bautista's mother later came out as a lesbian. He has said that he lived in poverty and had a hard life which included exposure to violent crime at an early age. Before reaching the age of nine, two bodies had been found on his front lawn and another one nearby. As young as age 13, he had begun stealing cars. By age 17, he was estranged from his parents and living on his own. However, he later said, \"I am proud of my parents. They are good, honest, hard-working folks. They taught me the values of working hard.\"\n\nProfessional Wrestling Career\nBautista tried out at the WCW's Power Plant, where notorious trainer DeWayne Bruce told him he would never make it in the wrestling business. He then went to WWE (then WWF), who advised him to train with Afa Anoa'i at the Wild Samoan Training Center, where he trained and later competed in Anoa'i's World Xtreme Wrestling (WXW) promotion. He wrestled his debut match under the ring name Khan on October 30, 1999, less than three months before his 31st birthday. He also trained with Marrese Crump in Muay Thai and Eskrima.\n\nTraining and Early Career (1999–2000)\nBautista tried out at the WCW's Power Plant, where notorious trainer DeWayne Bruce told him he would never make it in the wrestling business. He then went to WWE (then WWF), who advised him to train with Afa Anoa'i at the Wild Samoan Training Center, where he trained and later competed in Anoa'i's World Xtreme Wrestling (WXW) promotion. He wrestled his debut match under the ring name Khan on October 30, 1999, less than three months before his 31st birthday. He also trained with Marrese Crump in Muay Thai and Eskrima.\n\nWorld Wrestling Federation/Entertainment/WWE (2000–2010)\nUpon signing with the WWF in 2000, Bautista was sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), a WWF developmental territory. He made his OVW debut later that year under the ring name Leviathan, where he immediately joined forces with Synn. As a member of the Disciples of Synn stable, he went undefeated until being beaten at Christmas Chaos by Kane with help from Stone Cold Steve Austin. He later won the OVW Heavyweight Championship from \"The Machine\" Doug Basham before losing the belt to The Prototype. A few months later, Bautista left OVW after he was promoted to WWE's main roster.\n\nEarly Storylines (2002–2003)\nWhile still in OVW, Bautista began appearing on non-televised WWE events. He began his televised WWE career on May 9, 2002, on an episode of SmackDown! as Deacon Batista, a heel enforcer for Reverend D-Von. He made his WWE in-ring debut in a tag team match teaming with D-Von against Faarooq and Randy Orton, pinning Orton. Over several weeks, Orton tried to beat D-Von and Batista with different partners, but ultimately lost each time. Batista suffered his first loss in a match against Rikishi after D-Von accidentally punched him, allowing Rikishi to take advantage and pin Batista. Batista and D-Von argued over the forthcoming weeks, with Batista eventually turning on D-Von. On the November 14 episode of SmackDown!, Batista defeated D-Von to end their feud. After splitting with D-Von, he was assigned to the Raw brand and was renamed Batista. He aligned himself with Ric Flair and feuded with Kane, whom he defeated at Armageddon on December 15.\n\nEvolution (2003–2005)\nIn January 2003, Batista joined Triple H, Ric Flair, and Randy Orton to form the heel stable Evolution. Batista, however, was sidelined for much of 2003 after he tore his right triceps muscle at a Raw live event in a tag team match alongside Orton against The Dudley Boyz. While training after the injury, Batista re-tore his triceps, extending his stay on the sidelines. Batista made his return on the October 20 episode of Raw, interfering in a match between Goldberg and Shawn Michaels. At Armageddon on December 14, Batista and Ric Flair became the World Tag Team Champions after winning a Tag Team Turmoil match, while Triple H won the World Heavyweight Championship and Randy Orton the Intercontinental Championship. Batista and Flair held the titles until the February 16, 2004, episode of Raw, when they were defeated by Booker T and Rob Van Dam. They later defeated Booker T and Van Dam on the March 22 episode of Raw to regain the titles before losing them to Chris Benoit and Edge on the April 19 episode of Raw.\n\nWorld Heavyweight Champion (2005–2008)\nBatista won the World Heavyweight Championship on April 3 by defeating Triple H in the main event of WrestleMania 21. WrestleMania 21 received 1.09 million pay-per-view buys worldwide – the then-highest ever number of buys for any non-boxing pay-per-view. Batista's match with Triple H was described by sports journalist Dave Meltzer as \"the peak of one of [WWE's] best storylines in years.\" Batista won a rematch with Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship at Backlash. After Batista retained his title against Edge on the May 23 episode of Raw, he was betrayed by Ric Flair, who helped Triple H viciously attack Batista as Triple H challenged Batista to a Hell in a Cell match at Vengeance. Batista won the match at Vengeance, retaining his title yet again. With this win, Batista became the first wrestler to pin Triple H in a Hell in a Cell match.\n\nWWE Champion (2009–2010)\nBatista returned on the Raw after WrestleMania 25, to save Triple H, Shane McMahon, and Vince McMahon from The Legacy (Randy Orton, Cody Rhodes, and Ted DiBiase Jr.). Vince McMahon then scheduled Batista to team up with WWE Champion Triple H and Shane McMahon to face The Legacy at Backlash. During the match, Batista had brought out a chair, but Triple H tried to stop him, so they would not get disqualified (which would have cost Triple H the championship). This distraction, however, cost Triple H his championship, after he lost it to Orton. The following night on Raw, Batista won a singles match against Big Show due to a distraction by John Cena, to become the number one contender for the WWE Championship at Judgment Day, which he won by disqualification. Batista went on to defeat Orton in a rematch at Extreme Rules in a Steel Cage match to capture his first WWE Championship. However, on the June 8 episode of Raw, Batista was to vacate the title due to a staged brutal attack by Orton and the Legacy. It was later revealed that Batista had suffered a legitimate torn left biceps similar to what he suffered in 2006. Legacy was given on-screen credit for his injury.\n\nReturn to WWE (2014)\nBatista made his return to WWE on the January 20, 2014, episode of Raw. Despite returning as a face and winning the Royal Rumble, the live crowd reacted negatively towards Batista's win, as Daniel Bryan did not take part in the match. Despite a positive reaction initially upon his return, the crowd began to boo Batista after Roman Reigns was eliminated. After the show went off the air, Batista mocked Bryan and gestured his middle finger at the crowd. According to Batista, he thought a return as a face was a bad idea because of the fans being so invested in Daniel Bryan's \"Yes Movement.\" At the Elimination Chamber event and on the February 24 episode of Raw, Batista was heavily booed by the fans during matches against Alberto Del Rio, thus resulting in Batista turning heel on the February 28 episode of SmackDown. The main event of WrestleMania XXX, originally Batista versus Randy Orton for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, was changed to a triple threat match after Bryan defeated Triple H at WrestleMania. At WrestleMania, Bryan forced Batista to submit to win the title.\n\nSecond Return to WWE (2018–2019)\nOn October 16, 2018, Batista reunited with the rest of Evolution for an appearance on SmackDown's 1000th episode, where Batista teased a match with Triple H, as Triple H had never beaten Batista in singles competition. The storyline between them started on February 25, 2019, when Batista viciously attacked Ric Flair and repeatedly demanded \"give me what I want\" to Triple H, which became a popular phrase associated with Batista. At WrestleMania 35, Batista and Triple H would face each other in a No Holds Barred with their careers on the line, where Batista lost after interference from Ric Flair. The next day, Batista announced his retirement from professional wrestling.\n\nProfessional Wrestling Style and Persona\nUpon his return to WWE in 2014, Batista was heavily booed by the crowd after winning the Royal Rumble, despite playing a heroic character. In an interview with WWE.com, he said of the crowd reaction, \"It was weird. It wasn't like a normal response. It was almost like a personal attack. It had to do with factors that were not in my control, factors and things that were going on in the company with other people, stuff that really had nothing to do with me. To me, it was a little frustrating, a little confusing, and, you know, I don't want to say I completely took it personal, but I did somewhat.\" The fan reaction caused storyline changes, with Batista turning into a villainous character.\n\nMixed Martial Arts Career\nAfter leaving WWE, Bautista attended Strikeforce: Los Angeles on June 16, 2010, having previously registered an interest in competing in MMA. Five days later, he said that he would be embarking on an MMA career. He became a brown belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu under Cesar Gracie. Bautista and Strikeforce agreed on a price and were negotiating a contract. However, in April 2011, Bautista stated that negotiations fell through when the organization was bought by the Zuffa company.\n\nMixed Martial Arts Record\nBautista has acted in several television shows as both himself and his wrestling character. He guest starred in the eighth episode of season 6 of Smallville as Aldar, an extraterrestrial who escaped from the Phantom Zone and who sucks the bones out of people for nourishment. In June 2009, he made a cameo appearance as himself on the Australian soap opera Neighbours. In 2010, he appeared in an episode of Chuck, and also made a cameo appearance in Relative Strangers.

dispatched an emissary, Mtswa-Mwindza, to Mecca—but by the time he arrived there, the Islamic prophet Muhammad had died Nonetheless, after a stay in Mecca, he returned to Ngazidja, where he built a mosque in his home town of Ntsaweni, and led the gradual conversion of the islanders to Islam [26]\n\n\nEuropean contact and French colonisation\nIn the last decade of the 18th century, Malagasy warriors, mostly Betsimisaraka and Sakalava, started raiding the Comoros for slaves and the islands were devastated as crops were destroyed and the people were slaughtered, taken into captivity or fled to the African mainland: it is said that by the time the raids finally ended in the second decade of the 19th century only one man remained on Mwali [31] The islands were repopulated by slaves from the mainland, who were traded to the French in Mayotte and the Mascarenes On the Comoros, it was estimated in 1865 that as much as 40% of the population consisted of slaves [32]\n\n\nIndependence (1975)\nThe next 30 years were a period of political turmoil On 3 August 1975, less than one month after independence, president Ahmed Abdallah was removed from office in an armed coup and replaced with United National Front of the Comoros (FNUK) member Said Mohamed Jaffar Months later, in January 1976, Jaffar was ousted in favour of his Minister of Defence Ali Soilihi [36]\n\n\nGeography\nThe Comoros is formed by Ngazidja (Grande Comore), Mwali (Mohéli) and Ndzwani (Anjouan), three major islands in the Comoros Archipelago, as well as many minor islets The islands are officially known by their Comorian language names, though international sources still use their French names (given in parentheses above) The capital and largest city, Moroni, is located on Ngazidja and the most densely populated city is Anjouan [58] The archipelago is situated in the Indian Ocean, in the Mozambique Channel, between the African coast (nearest to Mozambique and Tanzania) and Madagascar, with no land borders.\n\n\nClimate\nThe climate is generally tropical and mild, and the two major seasons are distinguishable by their raininess The temperature reaches an average of 29–30 °C (84–86 °F) in March, the hottest month in the rainy season (called kashkazi/kaskazi  [meaning north monsoon], which runs from November to April), and an average low of 19 °C (66 °F) in the cool, dry season (kusi (meaning south monsoon), which proceeds from May to October) [60] The islands are rarely subject to cyclones.\n\n\nBiodiversity\nThe Comoros constitute an ecoregion in their own right, Comoros forests [61] [62] It had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 7.69/10, ranking it 33rd globally out of 172 countries [63]\n\n\nProtected areas\nThere are six national parks in the Comoros – Karthala, Coelacanth, and Mitsamiouli Ndroudi on Grande Comore, Mount Ntringui and Shisiwani on Anjouan, and Mohéli National Park on Mohéli Karthala and Mount Ntrigui national parks cover the highest peaks on the respective islands, and Coelacanth, Mitsamiouli Ndroudi, and Shisiwani are marine national parks that protect the island's coastal waters and fringing reefs Mohéli National Park includes both terrestrial and marine areas [66]\n\n\nGovernment\nPolitics of the Comoros takes place in a framework of a unitary [67] presidential republic, whereby the President of the Comoros is both head of state and head of government, and of a multi-party system The Constitution of the Union of the Comoros was ratified by referendum on 23 December 2001, and the islands' constitutions and executives were elected in the following months It had previously been considered a military dictatorship, and the transfer of power from Azali Assoumani to Ahmed Abdallah Mohamed Sambi in May 2006 was a watershed moment as it was the first peaceful transfer in Comorian history.\n\n\nLegal system\nThe Comorian legal system rests on Islamic law, an inherited French (Napoleonic Code) legal code, and customary law (mila na ntsi) Village elders, kadis or civilian courts settle most disputes The judiciary is independent of the legislative and the executive The Supreme Court acts as a Constitutional Council in resolving constitutional questions and supervising presidential elections As High Court of Justice, the Supreme Court also arbitrates in cases where the government is accused of malpractice The Supreme Court consists of two members selected by the president, two elected by the Federal Assembly, and one by the council of each island [69]\n\n\nPolitical culture\nAround 80 percent of the central government's annual budget is spent on the country's complex administrative system which provides for a semi-autonomous government and president for each of the three islands and a rotating presidency for the overarching Union government [70] A referendum took place on 16 May 2009 to decide whether to cut down the government's unwieldy political bureaucracy 52.7% of those eligible voted, and 93.8% of votes were cast in approval of the referendum Following the implementation of the changes, each island's president became a governor and the ministers became councillors [71]\n\n\nForeign relations\nIn November 1975, the Comoros became the 143rd member of the United Nations The new nation was defined as comprising the entire archipelago, although the citizens of Mayotte chose to become French citizens and keep their island as a French territory [72]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe military resources of the Comoros consist of a small standing army and a 500-member police force, as well as a 500-member defence force A defence treaty with France provides naval resources for protection of territorial waters, training of Comorian military personnel, and air surveillance France maintains the presence of a few senior officers in the Comoros at government request, as well as a small maritime base and a Foreign Legion Detachment (DLEM) on Mayotte.\n\n\nHuman rights\nBoth male and female same-sex sexual acts are illegal in Comoros [82] Such acts are punished with up to five years' imprisonment [83]\n\n\nEconomy\nThe level of poverty in the Comoros is high, but \"judging by the international poverty threshold of $1.9 per person per day, only two out of every ten Comorians could be classified as poor, a rate that places the Comoros ahead of other low-income countries and 30 percentage points ahead of other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.\" [84] Poverty declined by about 10% between 2014 and 2018, and living conditions generally improved [84] Economic inequality remains widespread, with a major gap between rural and urban areas [84] Remittances through the sizable Comorian diaspora form a substantial part of the country's GDP [85] and have contributed to decreases in poverty and increases in living standards [84]\n\n\nDemographics\nWith about 850,000 residents, the Comoros is one of the least populous countries in the world, but its population density is high, with an average of 275 inhabitants per square kilometre (710/sq mi) In 2001, 34% of the population was considered urban, but the urban population has since grown; in recent years rural population growth has been negative, while overall population growth is still relatively high [94] In 1958 the population was 183,133 [95]\n\n\nEthnic groups\nThe islands of the Comoros are 97.1% ethnically Comorian, which is a mixture of Bantu, Malagasy, and Arab people [1] Minorities include Makua and Indian (mostly Ismaili) There are recent immigrants of Chinese origin in Grande Comore (especially Moroni) Although most French left after independence in 1975, a small Creole community, descended from settlers from France, Madagascar and Réunion, lives in the Comoros [98]\n\n\nLanguages\nThe most common languages in the Comoros are the Comorian languages, collectively known as Shikomori They are related to Swahili, and the four different variants (Shingazidja, Shimwali, Shindzwani and Shimaore) are spoken on each of the four islands Arabic and Latin scripts are both used, Arabic being the more widely used, and an official orthography has recently been developed for the Latin script [99]\n\n\nReligion\nSunni Islam is the dominant religion, followed by as much as 99% of the population [100] Comoros is the only Muslim-majority country in Southern Africa and one of the three southernmost Muslim-majority territories, along with Mayotte and the Australian territory of Cocos Islands.\nA minority of the population of the Comoros are Christian, both Catholic and Protestant denominations are represented, and most Malagasy residents are also Christian Immigrants from metropolitan France are mostly Catholic [101]\n\n\nHealth\nThere are 15 physicians per 100,000 people The fertility rate was 4.7 per adult woman in 2004 Life expectancy at birth is 67 for females and 62 for males [102]\n\n\nEducation\nAlmost all children attend Quran Religious schools, usually before,

daho on Ngazidja) and the customary marriage (known as ada on Ngazidja, harusi on the other islands) The little marriage is a simple legal marriage It is small, intimate, and inexpensive, and the bride's dowry is nominal A man may undertake a number of Mna daho marriages in his lifetime, often at the same time, a woman fewer; but both men and women will usually only undertake one ada, or grand marriage, and this must generally be within the village The hallmarks of the grand marriage are dazzling gold jewelry, two weeks of celebration and an enormous bridal dowry Although the expenses are shared between both families as well as with a wider social circle, an ada wedding on Ngazidja can cost up to €50,000 [110] Many couples take a lifetime to save for their ada, and it is not uncommon for a marriage to be attended by a couple's adult children [111]\n\n\nKinship and social structure\nComorian society has a bilateral descent system Lineage membership and inheritance of immovable goods (land, housing) is matrilineal, passed in the maternal line, similar to many Bantu peoples who are also matrilineal, while other goods and patronymics are passed in the male line However, there are differences between the islands, the matrilineal element being stronger on Ngazidja [112]\n\n\nMusic\nTwarab music, imported from Zanzibar in the early 20th century, remains the most influential genre on the islands and is popular at ada marriages [113]\n\n\nMedia\nThere are two daily national newspapers published in the Comoros, the government-owned Al-Watwan, [114] and the privately owned La Gazette des Comores, both published in Moroni There are a number of smaller newsletters published on an irregular basis as well as a variety of news websites The government-owned ORTC (Office de

and Anjouan each operate a radio station There are also a few independent and small community radio stations that operate on the islands of Grande Comore and Mohéli, and these two islands have access to Mayotte Radio and French TV [115]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nCitations\n\n\n\nSources\n\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "The

genre on the islands and is popular at ada marriages [113]\n\n\nMedia\nThere are two daily national newspapers published in the Comoros, the government-owned Al-Watwan, [114] and the privately owned La Gazette des Comores, both published in Moroni There are a number of smaller newsletters published on an irregular basis as well as a variety of news websites The government-owned ORTC (Office de Radio et Télévision des Comores) provides national radio and television service There is a TV station run by the Anjouan regional government, and regional governments on the islands of Grande Comore

{"title": "Kizil_Caves", "content": "\nCaves\nThe Kizil Caves complex is the largest of the ancient Buddhist cave sites that are associated with the ancient Tocharian kingdom of Kucha, as well as the largest in Xinjiang Other famous sites nearby are the Kizilgaha caves, the Kumtura Caves, Subashi Temple and the Simsim caves [9] [10] The Kizil Caves are \"the earliest representative grottoes in China\" [11] At the time the caves were created, the area of Kucha was following the orthodox Sarvastivadin school of Hinayana Buddhism, although an early and minority Dharmagupta presence has also been noted [12] The simpler square caves may have been established by the Dharmagupta from the 4th century CE or earlier, while the \"central pillar\" caves, which flourished from the mid-6th century CE, can rather be associated with the Sarvastivadin school [12]\n\n\nOverview\nThere are 236 cave temples in Kizil, carved into the cliff stretching from east to west for a length of 2 km [1] Of these, 135 are still relatively intact [13] The earliest caves are dated, based in part on radioactive carbon dating, to around the year 300 [14] Most researchers believe that the caves were probably abandoned sometime around the beginning of the 8th century, after Tang influence reached the area [15] Documents written in Tocharian languages were found in Kizil and a few of the caves contain Tocharian and Sanskrit inscriptions which give the names of a few rulers.\n\n\n\"Central pillar\" cave structure\nIn the typical \"central pillar\" design, pilgrims can circumambulate around a central column incorporating a niche for a statue of the Buddha, which is a representation of the stupa The so-called \"central pillar\" which appears on a plan is actually not a pillar at all but only the rock at the back of the cave, into which was bored a circular corridor allowing for circumambulation [17]\n\n\nExploration\nThe Kizil Caves were first discovered and explored in 1902–1904 by the Ōtani expedition, a Japanese expedition under Tesshin Watanabe (渡辺哲信) and Kenyu Hori (堀賢雄), funded by Count Otani, but the expedition left hurriedly after four months of exploration in the area of Kucha, following a local earthquake [25] [26]\n\n\nDatation schemes\nIn 1912 Grünwedel proposed in 1912 a structural scheme which remained influential throughout the 20th century It is essentially based on the definition of two schools of art, \"Style 1\" and \"Style 2\" [38] Style I, qualified as \"Indo-Iranian\", derives from the Art of Gandhara, and murals tend to have dark cinnabar backgrounds with green and orange color schemes and natural shading, and the architecture tends to consist in squarish caves with cupola ceilings [38] [39] Style II derives from Sasanian art, and is characterized by a strong contrast between brilliant green-blue pigments [38] Architecturally, the caves of Style II have a central stupa-pillar surrounded by a circular corridor for circumambulation According to Grünwedel, Style II was before the 8th century CE After Grünwedel, Albert von Le Coq and Ernst Waldschmidt proposed dates, based in the epigraphic inscriptions found in the caves They proposed to date Style I from 500 to 600, and Style II from 600 to 650 CE These chronological guidelines remained extremely influential throughout the 20th century, as late as the 1980s [38]\n\n\nAlbert Grünwedel and the German school\nIn 1912 Grünwedel proposed in 1912 a structural scheme which remained influential throughout the 20th century It is essentially based on the definition of two schools of art, \"Style 1\" and \"Style 2\" [38] Style I, qualified as \"Indo-Iranian\", derives from the Art of Gandhara, and murals tend to have dark cinnabar backgrounds with green and orange color schemes and natural shading, and the architecture tends to consist in squarish caves with cupola ceilings [38] [39] Style II derives from Sasanian art, and is characterized by a strong contrast between brilliant green-blue pigments [38] Architecturally, the caves of Style II have a central stupa-pillar surrounded by a circular corridor for circumambulation According to Grünwedel, Style II was before the 8th century CE After Grünwedel, Albert von Le Coq and Ernst Waldschmidt proposed dates, based in the epigraphic inscriptions found in the caves They proposed to date Style I from 500 to 600, and Style II from 600 to 650 CE These chronological guidelines remained extremely influential throughout the 20th century, as late as the 1980s [38]\n\n\nModern attempts at Carbon 14 dating\nVarious attempts at radio-carbon analysis were made over the years, with various degrees of success, but with the main effect of pushing back the dates of the first caves to circa 300 BCE, and challenging the German classification according to styles and colors schemes [38]\n\n\nSu Bai\nIn 1979–1981, Su Bai (宿白) of Beijing University (北京大学历史系考古教研室, Beijing daxue lishi xi kaogu jiaoyanshi) made an influential carbon-testing campaign for caves 47, 3, 38, 6, 171, 17, 190, 8 [40] Based on these dates and on an analysis of the architecture of the caves (from the simpler to the more sophisticated), Su Bai proposed an influential dating scheme, pushing back the dates of the first caves to circa 300 CE [39]\n\n\nHuo and Wang\nIn 1989–1993, Huo and Wang (中国社会科学院考古研究所, Zhongguo shehui kexueyuan kaogu yanjiusuo) tested the following caves: 224, 76, 4, 8, 34, 68, 77, 98, 104, 114, 117, 118, 119, 125, 129, 135, 162, 171, 180, 189, 196, 198, 206, 212, 219, 227, 27, 39, 48, 60, 69, 84, 91, 92, 99, 123, 139, 161, 165, 178, 207 [40] They proposed a chronology which has some significant differences with the chronology previously proposed by Su Bai [39]\n\n\nCaves, murals and architecture\nIn 1906, the German expedition team of Albert Grünwedel explored the Kizil Caves Albert von Le Coq, who worked under the direction Grünwedel, had to leave in June 1906 due to health problems [28] Grünwedel generally photographed and copied the murals, before removing those he considered essential [28] Most of the fragments removed are now in Museum of Asian Art (formerly Museum für Indische Kunst) in Dahlem, Berlin [45] Other explorers removed some fragments of murals, that may now be found in museums in Russia, Japan, Korea and United States Although the site has been both damaged and looted, around 5000 square metres of wall paintings remain, [46] These murals mostly depict Jataka stories, avadanas, and legends of the Buddha, and are an artistic representation in the tradition of the Hinayana school of the Sarvastivadas [1]\n\n\nGeneral characteristics\nA notable feature of the murals in Kizil is the extensive use of blue pigments, including the precious ultramarine pigment derived from lapis lazuli from Afghanistan In the classification of the art of the region by Ernst Waldschmidt, there are three distinct periods: [1] the murals from the first phase are characterized by the use of reddish pigments, while those from the second phase used bluish pigments in abundance [15] The earlier paintings reflect more Greco-Indian or Gandharan influences, while the second ones show Iranian (Sassanian) influences [14] Later caves seem to have fewer legends and/or jatakas, being replaced by the repetitive designs of numerous small Buddhas (the so-called thousand Buddha motif), or sitting Buddhas with nimbuses [1] The paintings of the first two phases showed a lack of Chinese elements [15] The last phase, the Turkic-Chinese period, is most in evidence in the Turfan area, but in Kizil only two caves showed Tang Chinese influence.\n\n\nColor pigments\nThe pigments in the painting of the Kizil Caves have been analysed by X-ray diffraction analysis The reds are primarily vermilion and red lead, which today are greatly discolored, and red ocher Blue pigments are from lapis lazuli Green pigments are from copper\nhydroxy chloride minerals such as atacamite Brownish-black pigments are PbO2, obtained from the oxidation of red lead White pigments were mainly obtained from gypsum [11]\n\n\nStyle periods\nA broad classification of styles, formalized by Le Coq and Waldschmidt in 1933, [54] has been generally accepted [55]\n\n\nFirst Indo-Iranian Style: delicate \"orange and green\" paintings\nThe Kingdom of Kucha, the most populous oasis in the Tarim Basin, occupied a strategic position on the Northern Silk Road, which brought it prosperity, and made it a wealthy center of trade and culture [61] Kucha was part of the Silk Road economy, and was in contact with the rest of Central Asia, including Sogdiana and Bactria, and thus also with the cultures of India, Iran, and coastal areas of China [62] Early visitors are known, such Maes Titianus [63] Since the 2nd century CE, under the auspices of the Han dynasty and the Kushan Empire, numerous great Buddhist missionaries passed through the Tarim Basin on their way to China, such as the Parthian An Shigao, the Yuezhis Lokaksema and Zhi Qian, or the Indian Chu Sho-fu (竺朔佛) [64] Culture flourished, and Indian Sanskrit scriptures were being translated by the Kuchean monk and translator Kumarajiva (344–413 CE), himself the son of a Buddhist man from Kashmir and a Kuchean princess, sister of the King [64] [61]\n\n\nPeriod 1: \"Classical\" early style (circa 300–400 CE)\nThe earliest paintings at Kizil belong to a \"Classical\" stage Their style is very elegant and \"painterly\", with sophisticated shading of the bodies to express sculptural volume The lines are refined and subtle, the colors blend softly [70] This style is also characteristically Indian, and may be related to Gandhara or Kashmir [70] This early style is exemplified by the Cave of the Hippocampi (Cave 118), and may form a distinctive school This contrasts with the style of the following stage, as seen in the panels in the cella of the Cave of the Statues, such as the \"Cowherd Nanda\", which is much bolder, using intense colors (but still browns, greens and oranges only), thicker lines and simpler patterns [70]\n\n\nEarly paintings\nEarly inscriptions in Tocharian, an Indo-European language using a derivation of the Indian Brahmi script is used in several early paintings on tablets, as found in the Cave above the cave of the coffered ceiling (Cave 171), [56] or the Cave of the Niche (Cave 27) [71]\n\n\nEarliest painted caves\nAccording to the Chinese chronicles of the Jin dynasty (265-316 CE), there were already a thousand Buddhist stupas and temples in Kucha by the 3rd century CE [76] [77]\n\n\n\"Cave of the Hippocampi\" (Cave 118, 300–350 CE)\nThe Cave of the Hippocampi (Cave 118) was visited and photographed by the Third German Expedition of 1906–1907, and by the French expedition of Paul Pelliot in 1907 [27] Large portions of the murals were removed and sent to Germany, especially by von Le Coq in 1914, who removed the lunettes and the sides of the vault [29]\n\n\n\"Treasure Cave C\" (Cave 83, 300–350 CE)\nCave 83 (Treasure Cave C) is part of the compact group of the four \"Treasure Caves\" (82, 83, 84, 85) located at the entrance of the central valley It is a relatively small square cave (3.6x3.6m), with a podium in the middle, probably for a statue or a stupa [73] Here the ceiling has collapsed, but probably formed a cupola [73] [81]\n\n\n\"Treasure Cave B\" (Cave 84, 300–350 CE)\nCave 84 (Treasure Cave B) was a square, probably domed cave (4x4m, here too the ceiling has collapsed), examplifying an earlier, simpler cave structure at Kizil, which is also known from Bamiyan (Cave 24) [73] The origin of the paintings in caves 84 seems Indian, probably from Kashmir [73] They show groups of people standing around figures of the Buddha, who is either seated or standing [73] The depth of placement is rather shallow, the figures are graceful with curved torsos The faces are round and plump [73] Rhies suggest a date of the first half of the 4th century for Cave 84 [73] All the paintings were sent to Berlin by Grünwedel [73]\n\n\n\"Peacock Cave\" (Cave 76, circa 400 CE)\nThe \"Peacock Cave\" (Pfauenhöhle in German) [88] is also an early cave, although dated slightly later to circa 400 CE, and next located \"Cave of the statues\" (Cave 77), in the second rocky outcrop just outside of the central valley [89] It has been carbon dated to mid 4th-end 5th century CE [90] It is said to be \"the most recognizably Indian in the whole Kizil cycle\" [91] The paintings echo the Art of Gandhara and the murals of Ajanta Caves [91]\n\n\nThe \"Cave of the Seafarers\" (cave 212, circa 400 CE)\nThe \"Cave of the Seafarers\" (Höhle der Seereise) is dated by Rhies to the early 5th century CE, based on stylistic analysis [100] Carbon dates are significantly later, circa 561-637 CE [101] The cave contained long narrative sequences about various paths to enlightenment [100] Most of the panels are now in the Dahlem Museum [100] The content of the paintings in the \"Cave of the Seafarers\" is clearly derived from Gandharan prototypes [102]\n\n\nPeriod 2: \"New school\" with bolder style (circa 400–500 CE)\nFollowing the earliest \"Classical\" style of the paintings at Kizil, which was especially elegant and \"painterly\", with sophisticated shading of the bodies to express sculptural volume, [70] a new school appears with the Cave of the Statues, with works such as the \"Cowherd Nanda\", which is much bolder, using intense colors (but still limited to browns, greens and oranges), thicker lines and simpler patterns, somewhat like \"colored drawings\" [70] [108] This style is thought to be derived from the confluence of Hellenistic, Iranian and Indian influences under the Kushans, and its main center of creation was at Bamiyan, which became \"a kind of parent monastery for the settlement of monks in Central Asia\" [109]\n\n\n\"Cave of the statues\" (Cave 77, 375–400 CE)\nThe \"Cave of the Statues\" [70] (Statuenhöhle) was a magnificent cave, located next to the \"Peacock Cave\" (Cave 76) It is a \"colossal image cave\", with no niche in the main cella, but a podium on which a colossal standing statue of the Buddha probably stood [70] In an atypical design, the back corridor is quite large and wider than the main cella, with a width of 8.70 meters, for a height of 5.10 meters [70] Only seven other \"Colossal image caves\" are known in Kizil, including caves 47, 48, 70, 136, 139, 146 [4] They are characterized by a very tall main cella designed to accommodate a gigantic image of the Buddha, the height of the cella reaching around 5 meters and sometimes as high as 16.5 meters (such as in cave 47), and also a rather tall back room (often around 5–6 meters high) [4]\n\n\n\"Cave of the Painters\" (Cave 207, dated 478–536 CE)\nThe \"Cave of the Painters\" (Malerhöhle, 画家窟, Cave 207) [134] is one of the earliest caves of Kizil, and one of the most beautiful [135] The cave contained a statue of the Buddha against the rear wall of the cella, and a barrel-vaulted ambulatory surrounded it [135] The main cellar contained nine murals of the preaching Buddha on each side wall [135]\n\n\nCave 60: \"Largest Cave\"\nCave 60, also called the \"Largest Cave\", is a cave which was expanded over several periods, and still contained a few paintings belonging to the refined style of the Classical First Period, while most of the paintings are from the later Second Period [148] The cave is known for its portrait of royal donors, characteristically accompanied by a label in Brahmi script [148] This is the only known possible instance of a portrait of royal donors in a painting of the First Style, whereas they occur very often during the second period [148] The style of painting is very similar to that seen in the Cave of the Painters (Cave 207) [148] The hairstyle of the male donor is quite similar to that of the famous painter in the Cave of the Painters [148]\n\n\nSecond Indo-Iranian Style: strongly contrasted \"blue and green\" paintings\nThe \"Second Indo-Iranian style\" evolved with a few intermediate stages, expressing continuous influence from India, combined with influence from the Eastern Iran sphere, at that time occupied by the Sasanian Empire and the Hephthalites, with strong Sogdian cultural elements [48] The Hephthalites lost political power circa 550 CE after being defeated by the Sasanids and the Western Turks, but they remained influential for a long time, having fragmented into semi-independent Principalities [150] [151] Sogdia, at the center of a new Silk Road between China to the Sasanian Empire and the Byzantine Empire became extremely prosperous around that time [152]\n\n\nCentral-Asian stylistic elements\nThis style is characterized by strong Iranian-Sogdian elements probably brought with intense Sogdian-Tocharian trade during the period, the influence of which is especially apparent in the Central-Asian caftans with Sogdian textile designs, as well as Sogdian longswords of many of the figures [66] Other characteristic Sogdian designs are animals, such as ducks, within pearl medallions [66] Indo-Iranian influence also appears in mythological figures, such as the bird Garuda with snakes in its beak, the wind god Vayu, the sun god Aditya or the moon god Chandra [66]\n\n\nPeriod 1: Initial transitional style\nThe first period consist in a short interval of transitional style, in which paintings remain subtil and rather nuanced, but blue pigments have started to appear The Cave of the Devil C (Cave 198) and Cave of the Devil A (Cave 199), as well as the Cave with the Steps (Cave 110) and sometimes the Red-domed Cave A (Cave 67) are considered as the first period of this new style [48]\n\n\nPeriod 2: main stylistic period\nAccording to Rhie, the \"Cave of the Musicians\" [153] is probably the earliest of the \"central pillar\" caves at Kizil, dated to the mid-4th century CE, and its iconography is also among the earliest [154] Carbon testing by Su Bai gave dates ranging from 310 +/-80 CE to 350 +/-60 CE (i.e a maximum range of 230-410 CE) [17] [47] [65] Huo and Wang attributed the cave to the Second Period, giving it a date from mid-4th to late 5th century (circa 350–499 CE) [17] The traditional German datation estimated the cave to be from the 600–650 CE period, and presented it as an example of the later \"Blue-green style\", said to succeed chronologically the \"Orange-green style\" group [17]\n\n\n\"Cave of the Musicians\" (Cave 38)\nAccording to Rhie, the \"Cave of the Musicians\" [153] is probably the earliest of the \"central pillar\" caves at Kizil, dated to the mid-4th century CE, and its iconography is also among the earliest [154] Carbon testing by Su Bai gave dates ranging from 310 +/-80 CE to 350 +/-60 CE (i.e a maximum range of 230-410 CE) [17] [47] [65] Huo and Wang attributed the cave to the Second Period, giving it a date from mid-4th to late 5th century (circa 350–499 CE) [17] The traditional German datation estimated the cave to be from the 600–650 CE period, and presented it as an example of the later \"Blue-green style\", said to succeed chronologically the \"Orange-green style\" group [17]\n\n\nCave 14: Central Asian traders\nCave 14, a small and nearly square room with a vaulted ceiling (2.17x2.17 meters), is considered as later than the \"Cave of the Musicians\", and dated to the late 4th century CE to early 5th century CE, circa 400 CE, by Rhie [89] [158] The cave has many designs showing Central Asian traders encountering various dangers on their way, such as being lost in the dark, and being saved by the Dragon-King Mabi [159] Cave 14 is considered as an important historical marker for the dress styles or the armour types worn by some of the figures [158]\n\n\nCave 17: Tocharian royalty (circa 500 CE)\nCave 17 (Cave of the Bodhisattva Vault) is large \"central pillar\" cave located near Cave 14, and high up on the rock to the right of Cave 8 [164] It was probably the main cave of the group of caves from 14 to 19, which also includes several undecorated living quarters or viharas, and was dedicated to religious services Su Bai dates Cave 17 to the Second Stage (395–465 CE -+65), together with Cave 14 Luo and Wang date it to 465 CE +-65 [7] Rhie attributes Cave 17 to circa 500, based on stylistic considerations [165] It is a \"central pillar\" cave, with a small, very colorful, square cella (3.80x3.90 meters) with a vaulted ceiling, a central pillar with two side corridors, and a back room [164] These caves were possibly small chapels to nearby viharas [89]\n\n\n\"Cave of the Sixteen sword bearers\" (Cave no. 8, 432–538 CE)\nThe \"Cave of the Sixteen sword bearers\" (\"Höhle der Schwertträger\", 十六带剑者窟) is a famous cave with a series of murals showing swordsmen wearing caftans and armed with long sword and daggers These murals have been carbon dated to 432–538 CE [173] [60] The swordsmen have also been dubbed the \"Tocharian donors\".\n\n\nCave 181: Cave of the High Place in the Small Valley\nThe Cave of the High Place in the Small Valley (Cave 181), also called the \"Highest Cave\", [181] is described extensively by Albert Grünwedel, as a particularly interesting cave of the small ravine [182] He explains that the cave is located high up on the right side of the ravine, which accounts for the fact that its murals have been preserved from the usual iconoclastic vandalism: the faces in particular are well preserved [182] Also, the murals did not use gold foils for decoration, which reduced the incentive for theft [182] In his plates, Grünwedel illustrates the murals of the cave, where he names the cave by its official name: Hochliegende Höhle der 2 Schlucht (\"Cave of the High Place in the 2nd Valley\"), [183] which is the German name for cave 181 [184]\n\n\nPeriod 2 (later phase, 500–700 CE)\nThe 3rd phase covers a period from the mid-6th century CE to the early 7th century CE Carbon testing from this period gave dates ranging from 545 +/-75 CE to 685 +/-65 CE (i.e a maximum range of 470–750 CE) [65] Maya Cave (n.224) is one of the famous caves from this period Historically, the paintings of this period seem to correspond to the Turk expansion, following their uprising against the Rouran Khaganate in 552 and their subsequent territorial expansion [47] This can also be seen the style of armour of some of the soldiers in the murals, especially with their pear-shaped helmets [47]\n\n\nMāyā Cave (Third complex, cave 224, c.550–600 CE)\nMaya Cave (Cave 224) of \"III Anlage\" is one of the most famous caves of the Third Period It is dated to circa 550–600 CE, and possibly follows the events of the Turk uprising against the Rouran Khaganate in 552 CE and the subsequent Turk expansion [195] The helmets of the Knights depicted in some of the murals have been said to be characteristic pear-shaped segmented helmets of the Turkic type [195] [196]\n\n\nMāyā Cave (Second complex, Cave 205, end 6th century CE)\nMaya Cave of \"II Anlage\" (Cave 205) has been carbon-dated to the 6th–7th century CE [90] The cave has an inscriptions in Sanskrit mentioning the King of Kucha Anantavarma He is shown accompanied by two armed attendants [201]\n\n\nRed-dome Cave 67: more royal dedications\nAnother nearby cave, the Red-domed Cave A (Cave 67) also has inscriptions mentioning a list of donors including a queen and six kings, among them Suvarnapuspa (ruled 600–625 CE) and his son Suvarnadeva (ruled 625–648 CE) [202] [208] [209] Also included in the inscriptions are the names of King Tottika and his wife Svayamprabha (a Sanskrit name), who also appear in the Maya Cave of the Second Group (Cave 205), suggesting proximity in time of these two caves [203] The epigraphy also suggest dates later than the Cave of the Painters, with its more ancient inscription about the \"painter Tutuka\" [204]\n\n\nCave 69: portrait and dedication of the king of Kucha (securely dated to 600–647 CE)\nThis period has the only known secure dating in the Kizil Caves: Cave 69 has a painting of a royal Kuchean couple with an inscription in the halo of the King: \"Temple Constructed for the Benefit of Suvarnapushpa by His Son\", Suvarnapuspa having ruled between 600 and 625, and his three sons died before 647 CE according to Chinese sources [210] [211] [212]\n\n\nPeriod 3: final narrative evolution\nThe final stage at Kizil is Period 3 of the Second Indo-Iranian Style [54] Towards the end of its florescence, Kizil saw the emergence of the domed central pillar cave, a type of \"central pillar\" structure, with niche and circumambulating corridor, but with a very uncharacteristic near-cubic main cella crowned by a magnificent cupola decorated with divinities [218] The style of painting is very refined, and can also be seen in some other caves in the region such as in Kumtura The iconography too has evolved, with a cosmological Buddha becoming omnipresent and majestic, often surrounded by myriads of emanations of smaller Buddhas [218] This exceptional and very refined type of cave is exemplified by Cave 123, the \"Cave with the Ring-Bearing Doves\" [219] It represents a final narrative evolution, in which the figures of the cosmological Buddha predominate, while secondary figures and stories take an ever-smaller role [220]\n\n\n\"Cave with the Ring-Bearing Doves\" (Cave 123)\nThe \"Cave with the Ring-Bearing Doves\" (Cave 123) had a type of \"central pillar\" structure, with niche and circumambulating corridor, but with a very uncharacteristic cubic main cella crowned by a magnificent dome decorated with divinities [218] [221] The main cella forms a square vestibule or main hall (3.42 x 3.42 meters) in front of the pillar forming the back wall, the vestibule being surmounted by a decorated dome The prototype for the dome decorated with standing Buddhist deities is to be found in Group C of the caves at Bamiyan [222] It can also be seen in some other caves in the region, such as in Kumtura.\n\n\nOther caves of the third period\nThe Center Cave (Cave 186), the Third to Last Cave (Cave 184) and the Third Cave from the Front (Cave 187) are also considered as representatives of this third period [54]\n\n\nUighur-Chinese Style (8th–9th century CE)\nA 4th period, also described as \"The third style\" receives strong influence from Chinese painting, a result of the artistic activity and expansion of the Tang dynasty [231] The civilization of Kucha, with the whole Tarim Basin from Turfan to Khotan, fell to the Chinese punitive invasion of 648 CE, putting an end to the Indo-Iranian styles of Kucha [232] Ashina She'er, the East Turkic general leading the Tang dynasty expeditionary corps, ordered the execution of eleven thousand Kuchean inhabitants by decapitation It was recorded that \"he destroyed five great towns and with them many myriads of men and women.. the lands of the west were seized with terror.\" [233]\n\n\nTexts and inscriptions\nMost of the texts known from the Tocharians are religious, except for one known love poem in Tocharian B, found in Kizil and dated circa 600 CE (manuscript B-496): [237]\n\n\nLove poem\nMost of the texts known from the Tocharians are religious, except for one known love poem in Tocharian B, found in Kizil and dated circa 600 CE (manuscript B-496): [237]\n\n\n\"Kyzil library\"\nThe Kyzil library had some of \"the oldest copies of the Indian theatre known today\" written in Sanskrit or in Tokharian B: these Indian plays, called Nāṭaka in Sanskrit literature, alternate prose and verse, music and pantomime, and also provide scenic indications so that a single performer can enact a complete play by changing attitudes and voices These plays are at the origin of the \"chantefables\" or Chinese \"transformation texts\" called Bianwen [242]\n\n\n13th century Tibetan document about Kizil\nAlbert Grünwedel, one of the German discovers of the Kizil Caves, found in Saint-Peterburg a 13th-century Tibetan text related to Kucha and the Kizil Caves, including a map, which describes the caves from the perspective of Tantric Buddhism [243] According to the Tibetan text, the paintings in some of the caves were commissioned by a Tokharian (Thogar) king called \"Mendre\" (probably Māndhātṛ) with the advice of Anandavarman, a high-ranking monk The king ordered an Indian artist, Naravahanadatta, and a Syrian artist, Priyaratna, with their disciples to paint the caves [1] The neighbouring Khotanese kings Vijayavardhana and Murlimin also assisted with the painting of another cave by sending artists to the site.\n\n\nInfluences\nThe Kizil Caves are \"the earliest representative grottoes in China\" [11] The art of the Kizil Caves is thought to have influenced cave art at Dunhuang, in the Mogao Caves, as early as during the Northern Liang dynasty (421–439 CE), and pictorial arts in China thereafter [253]\n\n\nDecay, vandalism, dismantlement, and tourism\nSince their construction and decoration between the 4th and 8th centuries CE, the Kizil Caves have suffered numerous periods of religious vandalism and decay [254]\n\n\nMajor Kizil caves\nThe caves were first named in German by Albert Grünwedel based on various individual characteristics Many of these names have remained in English More recently, a numbering system was adopted by the Chinese, generally based on the geographical position of the caves from West to East.\n\n\nSee

the Tocharian kingdom of Kucha, as well as the largest in Xinjiang. Other famous sites nearby include the Kizilgaha caves, the Kumtura Caves, Subashi Temple, and the Simsim caves. The Kizil Caves are \"the earliest representative grottoes in China.\" At the time the caves were created, the area of Kucha was following the orthodox Sarvastivadin school of Hinayana Buddhism, although an early and minority Dharmagupta presence has also been noted.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThere are 236 cave temples in Kizil, carved into the cliff stretching from east to west for a length of 2 kilometers. Of these, 135 are still relatively intact. The earliest caves are dated, based in part on radioactive carbon dating, to around the year 300. Most researchers believe that the caves were probably abandoned sometime around the beginning of the 8th century, after Tang influence reached the area. Documents written in Tocharian languages were found in Kizil, and a few of the caves contain Tocharian and Sanskrit inscriptions that give the names of a few rulers.\n\n**\"Central pillar\" cave structure**\n\nIn the typical \"central pillar\" design, pilgrims can circumambulate around a central column incorporating a niche for a statue of the Buddha, which is a representation of the stupa. The so-called \"central pillar\" which appears on a plan is actually not a pillar at all but only the rock at the back of the cave, into which was bored a circular corridor allowing for circumambulation.\n\n**Exploration**\n\nThe Kizil Caves were first discovered and explored in 1902-1904 by the Otani expedition, a Japanese expedition under Tesshin Watanabe and Kenyu Hori, funded by Count Otani. The expedition left hurriedly after four months of exploration in the area of Kucha, following a local earthquake.\n\n**Datation schemes**\n\nIn 1912, Grünwedel proposed a structural scheme that remained influential throughout the 20th century. It is essentially based on the definition of two schools of art, \"Style 1\" and \"Style 2.\" Style I, qualified as \"Indo-Iranian,\" derives from the Art of Gandhara, and murals tend to have dark cinnabar backgrounds with green and orange color schemes and natural shading, and the architecture tends to consist in squarish caves with cupola ceilings. Style II derives from Sasanian art, and is characterized by a strong contrast between brilliant green-blue pigments. Architecturally, the caves of Style II have a central stupa-pillar surrounded by a circular corridor for circumambulation.\n\n**Albert Grünwedel and the German school**\n\nIn 1912, Grünwedel proposed a structural scheme that remained influential throughout the 20th century.

Style II derives from Sasanian art, and is characterized by a strong contrast between brilliant green-blue pigments. Architecturally, the caves of Style II have a central stupa-pillar surrounded by a circular corridor for circumambulation.\n\n**Modern attempts at Carbon 14 dating**\n\nVarious attempts at radio-carbon analysis were made over the years, with various degrees of success, but with the main effect of pushing back the dates of the first caves to circa 300 BCE, and challenging the German classification according to styles and colors schemes.\n\n**Su Bai**\n\nIn 1979-1981, Su Bai of Beijing University made an influential carbon-testing campaign for caves 47, 3, 38, 6, 171, 17, 190, 8. Based on these dates and on an analysis of the architecture of the caves (from the simpler to the more sophisticated), Su Bai proposed an influential dating scheme, pushing back the dates of the first caves to circa 300 CE.\n\n**Huo and Wang**\n\nIn 1989-1993, Huo and Wang tested the following caves: 224, 76, 4, 8, 34, 68, 77, 98, 104, 114, 117, 118, 119, 125, 129, 135, 162, 171, 180, 189, 196, 198, 206, 212, 219, 227, 27, 39, 48, 60, 69, 84, 91, 92, 99, 123, 139, 161, 165, 178, 207. They proposed a chronology that has some significant differences with the chronology previously proposed by Su Bai.\n\n**Caves, murals, and architecture**\n\nIn 1906, the German expedition team of Albert Grünwedel explored the Kizil Caves. Albert von Le Coq, who worked under the direction of Grünwedel, had to leave in June 1906 due to health problems. Grünwedel generally photographed and copied the murals, before removing those he considered essential. Most of the fragments removed are now in the Museum of Asian Art (formerly Museum für Indische Kunst) in Dahlem, Berlin. Other explorers removed some fragments of murals, that may now be found in museums in Russia, Japan, Korea, and the United States. Although the site has been both damaged and looted, around 5000 square meters of wall paintings remain. These murals mostly depict Jataka stories, avadanas, and legends of the Buddha, and are an artistic representation in the tradition of the Hinayana school of the Sarvastivadas.\n\n**General characteristics**\n\nA notable feature of the murals in Kizil is the extensive use of blue pigments, including the precious ultramarine pigment derived from lapis lazuli from Afghanistan. In the classification of the art of the region by Ernst Waldschmidt, there are three distinct periods: the murals from the first phase are characterized by the use of reddish pigments, while those from the second phase used bluish pigments in abundance. The earlier paintings reflect more Greco-Indian or Gandharan influences, while the second ones show Iranian (Sassanian) influences. Later caves seem to have fewer legends and/or jatakas, being replaced by the repetitive designs of numerous small Buddhas (the so-called thousand Buddha motif), or sitting Buddhas with nimbuses. The paintings of the first two phases showed a lack of Chinese elements. The last phase, the Turkic-Chinese period, is most in evidence in the Turfan area, but in Kizil only two caves showed Tang Chinese influence.\n\n**Color pigments**\n\nThe pigments in the painting of the Kizil Caves have been analyzed by X-ray diffraction analysis. The reds are primarily vermilion and red lead, which today are greatly discolored, and red ocher. Blue pigments are from lapis lazuli. Green pigments are from copper hydroxy chloride minerals such as atacamite. Brownish-black pigments are PbO2, obtained from the oxidation of red lead. White pigments were mainly obtained from gypsum.\n\n**Style periods**\n\nA broad classification of styles, formalized by Le Coq and Waldschmidt in 1933, has been generally accepted. The style periods are as follows: the first period, the \"Classical\" style, is characterized by elegant and painterly style, with sophisticated shading of the bodies to express sculptural volume. The second period is characterized by a bolder style, with intense colors (but still limited to browns, greens, and oranges), thicker lines, and simpler patterns. The third period is characterized by a refined style, with a strong contrast between brilliant green-blue pigments.\n\n**Period 1: Initial transitional style**\n\nThe first period consists in a short interval of transitional style, in which paintings remain subtle and nuanced, but blue pigments have started to appear. The Cave of the Devil C (Cave 198) and Cave of the Devil A (Cave 199), as well as the Cave with the Steps (Cave 110) and sometimes the Red-domed Cave A (Cave 67) are considered as the first period of this new style.\n\n**Period 2: Main stylistic period**\n\nAccording to Rhie, the \"Cave of the Musicians\" is probably the earliest of the \"central pillar\" caves at Kizil, dated to the mid-4th century CE, and its iconography is also among the earliest. Carbon testing by Su Bai gave dates ranging from 310 +/-80 CE to 350 +/-60 CE (i.e a maximum range of 230-410 CE). Huo and Wang attributed the cave to the Second Period, giving it a date from mid-4th to late 5th century (circa 350-499 CE).\n\n**Cave 14: Central Asian traders**\n\nCave 14, a small and nearly square room with a vaulted ceiling (2.17x2.17 meters), is considered as later than the \"Cave of the Musicians\", and dated to the late 4th century CE to early 5th century CE, circa 400 CE, by Rhie. The cave has many designs showing Central Asian traders encountering various dangers on their way, such as being lost in the dark, and being saved by the Dragon-King Mabi. Cave 14 is considered as an important historical marker for the dress styles or the armor types worn by some of the figures.\n\n**Cave 17: Tocharian royalty**\n\nCave 17 (Cave of the Bodhisattva Vault) is large \"central pillar\" cave located near Cave 14, and high up on the rock to the right of Cave 8. It was probably the main cave of the group of caves from 14 to 19, which also includes several undecorated living quarters or viharas, and was dedicated to religious services. Su Bai dates Cave 17 to the Second Stage (395-465 CE -+65), together with Cave 14 Luo and Wang date it to 465 CE -+65. Rhie attributes Cave 17 to circa 500 CE, based on stylistic considerations. It is a \"central pillar\" cave, with a small, very colorful, square cella (3.80x3.90 meters) with a vaulted ceiling, a central pillar with two side corridors, and a back room.\n\n**Cave of the Sixteen sword bearers**\n\nThe \"Cave of the Sixteen sword bearers\" (\"Höhle der Schwertträger\", 十六带剑者窟) is a famous cave with a series of murals showing swordsmen wearing caftans and armed with long swords and daggers. These murals have been carbon-dated to 432-538 CE. The swordsmen have also been dubbed the \"Tocharian donors\".\n\n**Māyā Cave**\n\nMāyā Cave (Cave 224) of \"III Anlage\" is one of the most famous caves of the Third Period. It is dated to circa 550-600 CE, and possibly follows the events of the Turk uprising against the Rouran Khaganate in 552 CE and the subsequent Turk expansion. The helmets of the Knights depicted in some of the murals have been said to be characteristic pear-shaped segmented helmets of the Turkic type.\n\n**Red-dome Cave 67**\n\nAnother nearby cave, the Red-domed Cave A (Cave 67) also has inscriptions mentioning a list of donors including a queen and six kings, among them Suvarnapuspa (ruled 600-625 CE) and his son Suvarnadeva (ruled 625-648 CE). The epigraphy also suggests dates later than the Cave of the Painters, with its more ancient inscription about the \"painter Tutuka\".\n\n**Cave 69**\n\nThis period has the only known secure dating in the Kizil Caves: Cave 69 has a painting of a royal Kuchean couple with an inscription in the halo of the King: \"Temple Constructed for the Benefit of Suvarnapushpa by His Son\", Suvarnapuspa having ruled between 600 and 625, and his three sons died before 647 CE according to Chinese sources.\n\n**Period 3: Final narrative evolution**\n\nThe final stage at Kizil is Period 3 of the Second Indo-Iranian Style. Towards the end of its florescence, Kizil saw the emergence of the domed central pillar cave, a type of \"central pillar\" structure, with niche and circumambulating corridor, but with a very uncharacteristic near-cubic main cella crowned by a magnificent cupola decorated with divinities.

It was recorded that \"he destroyed five great towns and with them many myriads of men and women.. the lands of the west were seized with terror.\"\n\n**Texts and inscriptions**\n\nMost of the texts known from the Tocharians are religious, except for one known love poem in Tocharian B, found in Kizil and dated circa 600 CE (manuscript B-496): \"Kyzil library\"\n\nThe Kyzil library had some of \"the oldest copies of the Indian theatre known today\" written in Sanskrit or in Tokharian B: these Indian plays, called Nāṭaka in Sanskrit literature, alternate prose and verse, music and pantomime, and also provide scenic indications so that a single performer can enact a complete play by changing attitudes and voices.

position on the Northern Silk Road, which brought it prosperity, and made it a wealthy center of trade and culture [61] Kucha was part of the Silk Road economy, and was in contact with the rest of Central Asia, including Sogdiana and Bactria, and thus also with the cultures of India, Iran, and coastal areas of China [62] Early visitors are known, such Maes Titianus [63] Since the 2nd century CE, under the auspices of the Han dynasty and the Kushan Empire, numerous great Buddhist missionaries passed through the Tarim Basin on their way to China, such as the Parthian An Shigao, the Yuezhis Lokaksema and Zhi Qian, or the Indian Chu Sho-fu (竺朔佛) [64] Culture flourished, and Indian Sanskrit scriptures were being translated by the Kuchean monk and translator Kumarajiva (344–413 CE), himself the son of a Buddhist man from Kashmir and a Kuchean princess, sister of the King [64] [61]\n\n\nPeriod 1: \"Classical\" early style (circa 300–400 CE)\nThe earliest paintings at Kizil belong to a \"Classical\" stage Their style is very elegant and \"painterly\", with sophisticated shading of the bodies to express sculptural volume The lines are refined and subtle, the colors blend softly [70] This style is also characteristically Indian, and may be related to Gandhara or Kashmir [70] This early style is exemplified by the Cave of the Hippocampi (Cave 118), and may form a distinctive school This contrasts with the style of the following stage, as seen in the panels in the cella of the Cave of the Statues, such as the \"Cowherd Nanda\", which is much bolder, using intense colors (but still browns, greens and oranges only), thicker lines and simpler patterns [70]\n\n\nEarly paintings\nEarly inscriptions in Tocharian, an Indo-European language using a derivation of the Indian Brahmi script is used in several early paintings on tablets, as found in the Cave above the cave of the coffered ceiling (Cave 171), [56] or the Cave of the Niche (Cave 27) [71]\n\n\nEarliest painted caves\nAccording to the Chinese chronicles of the Jin dynasty (265-316 CE), there were already a thousand Buddhist stupas and temples in Kucha by the 3rd century CE [76] [77]\n\n\n\"Cave of the Hippocampi\" (Cave 118, 300–350 CE)\nThe Cave of the Hippocampi (Cave 118) was visited and photographed by the Third German Expedition of 1906–1907, and by the French expedition of Paul Pelliot in 1907 [27] Large portions of the murals were removed and sent to Germany, especially by von Le Coq in 1914, who removed the lunettes and the sides of the vault [29]\n\n\n\"Treasure Cave C\" (Cave 83, 300–350 CE)\nCave 83 (Treasure Cave C) is part of the compact group of the four \"Treasure Caves\" (82, 83, 84, 85) located at the entrance of the central valley It is a relatively small square cave (3.6x3.6m), with a podium in the middle, probably for a statue or a stupa [73] Here the ceiling has collapsed, but probably formed a cupola [73] [81]\n\n\n\"Treasure Cave B\" (Cave 84, 300–350 CE)\nCave 84 (Treasure Cave B) was a square, probably domed cave (4x4m, here too the ceiling has collapsed), examplifying an earlier, simpler cave structure at Kizil, which is also known from Bamiyan (Cave 24) [73] The origin of the paintings in caves 84 seems Indian, probably from Kashmir [73] They show groups of people standing around figures of the Buddha, who is either seated or standing [73] The depth of placement is rather shallow, the figures are graceful with curved torsos The faces are round and plump [73] Rhies suggest a date of the first half of the 4th century for Cave 84 [73] All the paintings were sent to Berlin by Grünwedel [73]\n\n\n\"Peacock Cave\" (Cave 76, circa 400 CE)\nThe \"Peacock Cave\" (Pfauenhöhle in German) [88] is also an early cave, although dated slightly later to circa 400 CE, and next located \"Cave of the statues\" (Cave 77), in the second rocky outcrop just outside of the central valley [89] It has been carbon dated to mid 4th-end 5th century CE [90] It is said to be \"the most recognizably Indian in the whole Kizil cycle\" [91] The paintings echo the Art of Gandhara and the murals of Ajanta Caves [91]\n\n\nThe \"Cave of the Seafarers\" (cave 212, circa 400 CE)\nThe \"Cave of the Seafarers\" (Höhle der Seereise) is dated by Rhies to the early 5th century CE, based on stylistic analysis [100] Carbon dates are significantly later, circa 561-637 CE [101] The cave contained long narrative sequences about various paths to enlightenment [100] Most of the panels are now in the Dahlem Museum [100] The content of the paintings in the \"Cave of the Seafarers\" is clearly derived from Gandharan prototypes [102]\n\n\nPeriod 2: \"New school\" with bolder style (circa 400–500 CE)\nFollowing the earliest \"Classical\" style of the paintings at Kizil, which was especially elegant and \"painterly\", with sophisticated shading of the bodies to express sculptural volume, [70] a new school appears with the Cave of the Statues, with works such as the \"Cowherd Nanda\", which is much bolder, using intense colors (but still limited to browns, greens and oranges), thicker lines and simpler patterns, somewhat like \"colored drawings\" [70] [108] This style is thought to be derived from the confluence of Hellenistic, Iranian and Indian influences under the Kushans, and its main center of creation was at Bamiyan, which became \"a kind of parent monastery for the settlement of monks in Central Asia\" [109]\n\n\n\"Cave of the statues\" (Cave 77, 375–400 CE)\nThe \"Cave of the Statues\" [70] (Statuenhöhle) was a magnificent cave, located next to the \"Peacock Cave\" (Cave 76) It is a \"colossal image cave\", with no niche in the main cella, but a podium on which a colossal standing statue of the Buddha probably stood [70] In an atypical design, the back corridor is quite large and wider than the main cella, with a width of 8.70 meters, for a height of 5.10 meters [70] Only seven other \"Colossal image caves\" are known in Kizil, including caves 47, 48, 70, 136, 139, 146 [4] They are characterized by a very tall main cella designed to accommodate a gigantic image of the Buddha, the height of the cella reaching around 5 meters and sometimes as high as 16.5 meters (such as in cave 47), and also a rather tall back room (often around 5–6 meters high) [4]\n\n\n\"Cave of the Painters\" (Cave 207, dated 478–536 CE)\nThe \"Cave of the Painters\" (Malerhöhle, 画家窟, Cave 207) [134] is one of the earliest caves of Kizil, and one of the most beautiful [135] The cave contained a statue of the Buddha against the rear wall of the cella, and a barrel-vaulted ambulatory surrounded it [135] The main cellar contained nine murals of the preaching Buddha on each side wall [135]\n\n\nCave 60: \"Largest Cave\"\nCave 60, also called the \"Largest Cave\", is a cave which was expanded over several periods, and still contained a few paintings belonging to the refined style of the Classical First Period, while most of the paintings are from the later Second Period [148] The cave is known for its portrait of royal donors, characteristically accompanied by a label in Brahmi script [148] This is the only known possible instance of a portrait of royal donors in a painting of the First Style, whereas they occur very often during the second period [148] The style of painting is very similar to that seen in the Cave of the Painters (Cave 207) [148] The hairstyle of the male donor is quite similar to that of the famous painter in the Cave of the Painters [148]\n\n\nSecond Indo-Iranian Style: strongly contrasted \"blue and green\" paintings\nThe \"Second Indo-Iranian style\" evolved with a few intermediate stages, expressing continuous influence from India, combined with influence from the Eastern Iran sphere, at that time occupied by the Sasanian Empire and the Hephthalites, with strong Sogdian cultural elements [48] The Hephthalites lost political power circa 550 CE after being defeated by the Sasanids and the Western Turks, but they remained influential for a long time, having fragmented into semi-independent Principalities [150] [151] Sogdia, at the center of a new Silk Road between China to the Sasanian Empire and the Byzantine Empire became extremely prosperous around that time [152]\n\n\nCentral-Asian stylistic elements\nThis style is characterized by strong Iranian-Sogdian elements probably brought with intense Sogdian-Tocharian trade during the period, the influence of which is especially apparent in the Central-Asian caftans with Sogdian textile designs, as well as Sogdian longswords of many of the figures [66] Other characteristic Sogdian designs are animals, such as ducks, within pearl medallions [66] Indo-Iranian influence also appears in mythological figures, such as the bird Garuda with snakes in its beak, the wind god Vayu, the sun god Aditya or the moon god Chandra [66]\n\n\nPeriod 1: Initial transitional style\nThe first period consist in a short interval of transitional style, in which paintings remain subtil and rather nuanced, but blue pigments have started to appear The Cave of the Devil C (Cave 198) and Cave of the Devil A (Cave 199), as well as the Cave with the Steps (Cave 110) and sometimes the Red-domed Cave A (Cave 67) are considered as the first period of this new style [48]\n\n\nPeriod 2: main stylistic period\nAccording to Rhie, the \"Cave of the Musicians\" [153] is probably the earliest of the \"central pillar\" caves at Kizil, dated to the mid-4th century CE, and its iconography is also among the earliest [154] Carbon testing by Su Bai gave dates ranging from 310 +/-80 CE to 350 +/-60 CE (i.e a maximum range of 230-410 CE) [17] [47] [65] Huo and Wang attributed the cave to the Second Period, giving it a date from mid-4th to late 5th century (circa 350–499 CE) [17] The traditional German datation estimated the cave to be from the 600–650 CE period, and presented it as an example of the later \"Blue-green style\", said to succeed chronologically the \"Orange-green style\" group [17]\n\n\n\"Cave of the Musicians\" (Cave 38)\nAccording to Rhie, the \"Cave of the Musicians\" [153] is probably the earliest of the \"central pillar\" caves at Kizil, dated to the mid-4th century CE, and its iconography is also among the earliest [154] Carbon testing by Su Bai gave dates ranging from 310 +/-80 CE to 350 +/-60 CE (i.e a maximum range of 230-410 CE) [17] [47] [65] Huo and Wang attributed the cave to the Second Period, giving it a date from mid-4th to late 5th century (circa 350–499 CE) [17] The traditional German datation estimated the cave to be from the 600–650 CE period, and presented it as an example of the later \"Blue-green style\", said to succeed chronologically the \"Orange-green style\" group [17]\n\n\nCave 14: Central Asian traders\nCave 14, a small and nearly square room with a vaulted ceiling (2.17x2.17 meters), is considered as later than the \"Cave of the Musicians\", and dated to the late 4th century CE to early 5th century CE, circa 400 CE, by Rhie [89] [158] The cave has many designs showing Central Asian traders encountering various dangers on their way, such as being lost in the dark, and being saved by the Dragon-King Mabi [159] Cave 14 is considered as an important historical marker for the dress styles or the armour types worn by some of the figures [158]\n\n\nCave 17: Tocharian royalty (circa 500 CE)\nCave 17 (Cave of the Bodhisattva Vault) is large \"central pillar\" cave located near Cave 14, and high up on the rock to the right of Cave 8 [164] It was probably the main cave of the group of caves from 14 to 19, which also includes several undecorated living quarters or viharas, and was dedicated to religious services Su Bai dates Cave 17 to the Second Stage (395–465 CE -+65), together with Cave 14 Luo and Wang date it to 465 CE +-65 [7] Rhie attributes Cave 17 to circa 500, based on stylistic considerations [165] It is a \"central pillar\" cave, with a small, very colorful, square cella (3.80x3.90 meters) with a vaulted ceiling, a central pillar with two side corridors, and a back room [164] These caves were possibly small chapels to nearby viharas [89]\n\n\n\"Cave of the Sixteen sword bearers\" (Cave no. 8, 432–538 CE)\nThe \"Cave of the Sixteen sword bearers\" (\"Höhle der Schwertträger\", 十六带剑者窟) is a famous cave with a series of murals showing swordsmen wearing caftans and armed with long sword and daggers These murals have been carbon dated to 432–538 CE [173] [60] The swordsmen have also been dubbed the \"Tocharian donors\".\n\n\nCave 181: Cave of the High Place in the Small Valley\nThe Cave of the High Place in the Small Valley (Cave 181), also called the \"Highest Cave\", [181] is described extensively by Albert Grünwedel, as a particularly interesting cave of the small ravine [182] He explains that the cave is located high up on the right side of the ravine, which accounts for the fact that its murals have been preserved from the usual iconoclastic vandalism: the faces in particular are well preserved [182] Also, the murals did not use gold foils for decoration, which reduced the incentive for theft [182] In his plates, Grünwedel illustrates the murals of the cave, where he names the cave by its official name: Hochliegende Höhle der 2 Schlucht (\"Cave of the High Place in the 2nd Valley\"), [183] which is the German name for cave 181 [184]\n\n\nPeriod 2 (later phase, 500–700 CE)\nThe 3rd phase covers a period from the mid-6th century CE to the early 7th century CE Carbon testing from this period gave dates ranging from 545 +/-75 CE to 685 +/-65 CE (i.e a maximum range of 470–750 CE) [65] Maya Cave (n.224) is one of the famous caves from this period Historically, the paintings of this period seem to correspond to the Turk expansion, following their uprising against the Rouran Khaganate in 552 and their subsequent territorial expansion [47] This can also be seen the style of armour of some of the soldiers in the murals, especially with their pear-shaped helmets [47]\n\n\nMāyā Cave (Third complex, cave 224, c.550–600 CE)\nMaya Cave (Cave 224) of \"III Anlage\" is one of the most famous caves of the Third Period It is dated to circa 550–600 CE, and possibly follows the events of the Turk uprising against the Rouran Khaganate in 552 CE and the subsequent Turk expansion [195] The helmets of the Knights depicted in some of the murals have been said to be characteristic pear-shaped segmented helmets of the Turkic type [195] [196]\n\n\nMāyā Cave (Second complex, Cave 205, end 6th century CE)\nMaya Cave of \"II Anlage\" (Cave 205) has been carbon-dated to the 6th–7th century CE [90] The cave has an inscriptions in Sanskrit mentioning the King of Kucha Anantavarma He is shown accompanied by two armed attendants [201]\n\n\nRed-dome Cave 67: more royal dedications\nAnother nearby cave, the Red-domed Cave A (Cave 67) also has inscriptions mentioning a list of donors including a queen and six kings, among them Suvarnapuspa (ruled 600–625 CE) and his son Suvarnadeva (ruled 625–648 CE) [202] [208] [209] Also included in the inscriptions are the names of King Tottika and his wife Svayamprabha (a Sanskrit name), who also appear in the Maya Cave of the Second Group (Cave 205), suggesting proximity in time of these two caves [203] The epigraphy also suggest dates later than the Cave of the Painters, with its more ancient inscription about the \"painter Tutuka\" [204]\n\n\nCave 69: portrait and dedication of the king of Kucha (securely dated to 600–647 CE)\nThis period has the only known secure dating in the Kizil Caves: Cave 69 has a painting of a royal Kuchean couple with an inscription in the halo of the King: \"Temple Constructed for the Benefit of Suvarnapushpa by His Son\", Suvarnapuspa having ruled between 600 and 625, and his three sons died before 647 CE according to Chinese sources [210] [211] [212]\n\n\nPeriod 3: final narrative evolution\nThe final stage at Kizil is Period 3 of the Second Indo-Iranian Style [54] Towards the end of its florescence, Kizil saw the emergence of the domed central pillar cave, a type of \"central pillar\" structure, with niche and circumambulating corridor, but with a very uncharacteristic near-cubic main cella crowned by a magnificent cupola decorated with divinities [218] The style of painting is very refined, and can also be seen in some other caves in the region such as in Kumtura The iconography too has evolved, with a cosmological Buddha becoming omnipresent and majestic, often surrounded by myriads of emanations of smaller Buddhas [218] This exceptional and very refined type of cave is exemplified by Cave 123, the \"Cave with the Ring-Bearing Doves\" [219] It represents a final narrative evolution, in which the figures of the cosmological Buddha predominate, while secondary figures and stories take an ever-smaller role [220]\n\n\n\"Cave with the Ring-Bearing Doves\" (Cave 123)\nThe \"Cave with the Ring-Bearing Doves\" (Cave 123) had a type of \"central pillar\" structure, with niche and circumambulating corridor, but with a very uncharacteristic cubic main cella crowned by a magnificent dome decorated with divinities [218] [221] The main cella forms a square vestibule or main hall (3.42 x 3.42 meters) in front of the pillar forming the back wall, the vestibule being surmounted by a decorated dome The prototype for the dome decorated with standing Buddhist deities is to be found in Group C of the caves at Bamiyan [222] It can also be seen in some other caves in the region, such as in Kumtura.\n\n\nOther caves of the third period\nThe Center Cave (Cave 186), the Third to Last Cave (Cave 184) and the Third Cave from the Front (Cave 187) are also considered as representatives of this third period [54]\n\n\nUighur-Chinese Style (8th–9th century CE)\nA 4th period, also described as \"The third style\" receives strong influence from Chinese painting, a result of the artistic activity and expansion of the Tang dynasty [231] The civilization of Kucha, with the whole Tarim Basin from Turfan to Khotan, fell to the Chinese punitive invasion of 648 CE, putting an end to the Indo-Iranian styles of Kucha [232] Ashina She'er, the East Turkic general leading the Tang dynasty expeditionary corps, ordered the execution of eleven thousand Kuchean inhabitants by decapitation It was recorded that \"he destroyed five great towns and with them many myriads of men and women.. the lands of the west were seized with terror.\" [233]\n\n\nTexts and inscriptions\nMost of the texts known from the Tocharians are religious, except for one known love poem in Tocharian B, found in Kizil and dated circa 600 CE (manuscript B-496): [237]\n\n\nLove poem\nMost of the texts known from the Tocharians are religious, except for one known love poem in Tocharian B, found in Kizil and dated circa 600 CE (manuscript B-496): [237]\n\n\n\"Kyzil library\"\nThe Kyzil library had some of \"the oldest copies of the Indian theatre known today\" written in Sanskrit or in Tokharian B: these Indian plays, called Nāṭaka in Sanskrit literature, alternate prose and verse, music and pantomime, and also provide scenic indications so that a single performer can enact a complete play by changing attitudes and voices These plays are at the origin of the \"chantefables\" or Chinese \"transformation texts\" called Bianwen [242]\n\n\n13th century Tibetan document about Kizil\nAlbert Grünwedel, one of the German discovers of the Kizil Caves, found in Saint-Peterburg a 13th-century Tibetan text related to Kucha and the Kizil Caves, including a map, which describes the caves from the perspective of Tantric Buddhism [243] According to the Tibetan text, the paintings in some of the caves were commissioned by a Tokharian (Thogar) king called \"Mendre\" (probably Māndhātṛ) with the advice of Anandavarman, a high-ranking monk The king ordered an Indian artist, Naravahanadatta, and a Syrian artist, Priyaratna, with their disciples to paint the caves [1] The neighbouring Khotanese kings Vijayavardhana and Murlimin also assisted with the painting of another cave by sending artists to the site.\n\n\nInfluences\nThe Kizil Caves are \"the earliest representative grottoes in China\" [11] The art of the Kizil Caves is thought to have influenced cave art at Dunhuang, in the Mogao Caves, as early as during the Northern Liang dynasty (421–439 CE), and pictorial arts in China thereafter [253]\n\n\nDecay, vandalism, dismantlement, and tourism\nSince their construction and decoration between the 4th and 8th centuries CE, the Kizil Caves have suffered numerous periods of religious vandalism and decay [254]\n\n\nMajor Kizil caves\nThe caves were first named in German by Albert Grünwedel based on various individual characteristics Many of these names have remained in English More recently, a numbering system was adopted by the Chinese, generally based on the geographical position of the caves from West to East.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born in Queens, New York City, Headley has had a diverse and accomplished career, with a range of film and television credits to her name.\n\n# Early Life\n\nHeadley is the youngest of four children, born to a family of part Trinidadian descent. Her father worked as a dental technician, and had aspirations for his daughter to become a doctor. In college, Headley pursued a premedical course of study, minoring in drama and participating in school plays. This early exposure to acting would later serve as a foundation for her future career.\n\n# Career\n\nHeadley made her acting debut in 1985, appearing in an episode of the popular NBC sitcom The Cosby Show. She would go on to appear in a number of other television shows, including Miami Vice, Quantum Leap, and Matlock. Her breakthrough film role came in 1988, when she played Lisa McDowell in the romantic comedy Coming to America. In the film, Headley stars alongside Eddie Murphy, who plays her love interest. The film was a box-office success, grossing over $288 million worldwide.\n\nComing to America was directed by John Landis, who has spoken highly of Headley's performance in the film. At the time, Headley was relatively unknown, and Landis chose her for the role precisely because of that. He has stated that he wanted to give a new actress a chance to shine in the film, and Headley's chemistry with Murphy was a key factor in the film's success.\n\nDespite the film's commercial success, Headley's performance in Coming to America was not without its critics. Some reviewers found her acting to be \"bland,\" although others praised her chemistry with Murphy. Regardless, the film cemented Headley's status as a rising star in Hollywood.\n\n# Personal Life\n\nIn 1993, Headley married actor and entertainer Christopher Martin, better known as \"Play\" from the hip-hop duo Kid N' Play. The couple had one son together, and were married for two years before divorcing in 1995. Headley has kept a relatively low profile in recent years, focusing on her family and personal life.\n\n# Filmography\n\n## Film\n\n* Coming to America (1988)\n* Johnny Be Good (1988)\n* The Wedding (1998)\n\n## Television\n\n* The Cosby Show (1985)\n* Miami Vice (1985)\n* Quantum Leap (1989)\n* Matlock (1990)\n* The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (1991)\n\n## Documentary\n\n* The Making of Coming to America (2008)\n\n## Music Videos\n\n* Kid 'n Play - \"Fun Factory\" (1991)\n* Kid 'n Play - \"I'm a Player\" (1992)\n\n# External Links\n\n* Shari Headley at IMDb\n* Shari Headley on Facebook\n* Shari Headley on Twitter", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Shari_Headley\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nBorn in Queens, New York City, Headley is the youngest of four children [2] She is of part Trinidadian descent [3] Headley's father worked as a dental technician, and had wanted his daughter to be a doctor [4] In college, she was a premedical student, minoring in drama and performing in school plays [4]\n\n\nCareer\nHeadley made her acting debut appearing in an episode of NBC sitcom The Cosby Show in 1985 [4] Headley later appeared on Miami Vice, [4] Quantum Leap, [7] and Matlock [1] In 1988, she portrayed Lisa McDowell, an heiress to a fast food restaurant, in romantic comedy Coming to America [8] Eddie Murphy appears as her love interest in the film [9] Being relatively unknown at the time, the film's director John Landis stated she was chosen in the role for that reason [10] One reviewer opined she and Murphy \"shined\" together, [11] though another critic found Headley's performance \"bland.\" [12] The film was a box-office success grossing a worldwide total of $288,752,301 [13]\n\n\nPersonal life\nHeadley was married to actor/entertainer Christopher Martin, better known as \"Play\" from the hip-hop duo Kid N' Play, from May 1993 until they divorced in June 1995 [32] [33] Martin and Headley have one son together [34]\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nDocumentary\n\n\nMusic videos\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

she told MTV that her then-untitled third studio album would incorporate multiple music genres and that each song had its own \"personality\" [3] [4] Later in September 2020, Doja Cat revealed that her third studio album was complete and \"all ready\" for release [5] [6] She also told iHeartRadio in December that it has a number of features and collaborations, and that each song has a \"different kind of vibe\" to one another [7]\n\nConcept and title\nDoja Cat has explained that Planet Her is \"the center of the universe\" where \"all races of space exist and its where all species can kind of be in harmony there\" [22] She noted that by naming the album Planet Her, she was \"just trying to be cute\" and clarified that it is not a planet for women nor a \"feminist thing\" [22] The music videos for the singles from the album all occur on different locations on the planet, [22] [23] and aim to explore the respective aspects of these locations and what they mean [24] In an interview with iHeartRadio, she described the album as the most visually captivating project she has ever done, and noted that, because the album focuses on relationships, \"it's not a huge statement, not a political statement It's just Planet Her, for girls\" [25]\n\n\nCover artwork\nThe album cover was shot by American commercial photographer David LaChapelle [26] It finds Doja Cat \"floating in a sea of outer space\" Her body is covered with sparkles [27] There were a number of different photographs taken amongst different sets, yet Doja Cat chose the final shot as it was her initial idea and felt set on it from the start [28]: 00:23  Although it appears as if she is flying in the image, Doja Cat claims that she is submerged in rock after having fell from space, but said that it is \"left for your interpretation\" [28]: 00:48 \n\n\nReception\nInsider interpreted through the album's music and lyrics that \"Planet Her\" is a place where \"midday skies are streaked with pink and orange\" and where \"following your sexual urges is uncomplicated and morally good, where the feminine is divine and it's summer year-round.\" [29] Rolling Stone described the planet as an \"exquisitely strange and spectacularly camp world\" and noted that \"there's a bit of cheeky, sci-fi B movie references in the presentation but the content  [of the album] itself is pristine pop fun.\" [30]\n\n\nComposition\nPlanet Her is primarily a pop, [31] hip hop, and R&B record [32] [33] It incorporates musical elements from a wide range of genres, such as afrobeat, [34] reggaeton, [35] hyperpop, [36] and pop-rap [37] The album opens with a string of \"funky,\" \"fun\" and \"upbeat\" tracks and towards the second half, the tempo mostly slows down for the more \"introspective\" tracks and Doja Cat \"drifts from her usual raunchy lyricism to try out lovesick lullabies and heartbreak ballads, allowing the music to slow and a newfound vulnerability to emerge.\" [38] [21] [39]\n\n\nRelease and promotion\nDoja Cat first introduced the term \"Planet Her\" in August 2020 during the opening sequence of her performance at the 2020 MTV Video Music Awards, where she impersonated a television commentator and stated \"Performing live on Planet Her is Doja Cat Enjoy!\" [54] [55] In late December 2020, she began subliminally teasing the album on Twitter by repeatedly

album by American rapper and singer Doja Cat, released on June 25, 2021, through Kemosabe Records and RCA Records. The album marks a new direction in Doja Cat's music, incorporating a wide range of genres, including pop, hip-hop, R&B, afrobeat, reggaeton, hyperpop, and pop-rap.\n\n**Background and recording**\n\nDoja Cat released her second studio album Hot Pink in November 2019, and spent most of 2020 promoting its singles. In August 2020, she told MTV that her then-untitled third studio album would incorporate multiple music genres and that each song had its own \"personality.\" Later in September 2020, Doja Cat revealed that her third studio album was complete and \"all ready\" for release. She also told iHeartRadio in December that it has a number of features and collaborations, and that each song has a \"different kind of vibe\" to one another.\n\n**Concept and title**\n\nDoja Cat has explained that Planet Her is \"the center of the universe\" where \"all races of space exist and its where all species can kind of be in harmony there.\" She noted that by naming the album Planet Her, she was \"just trying to be cute\" and clarified that it is not a planet for women nor a \"feminist thing.\" The music videos for the singles from the album all occur on different locations on the planet, and aim to explore the respective aspects of these locations and what they mean. In an interview with iHeartRadio, she described the album as the most visually captivating project she has ever done, and noted that, because the album focuses on relationships, \"it's not a huge statement, not a political statement It's just Planet Her, for girls.\"\n\n**Cover artwork**\n\nThe album cover was shot by American commercial photographer David LaChapelle. It finds Doja Cat \"floating in a sea of outer space\" Her body is covered with sparkles. There were a number of different photographs taken amongst different sets, yet Doja Cat chose the final shot as it was her initial idea and felt set on it from the start. Although it appears as if she is flying in the image, Doja Cat claims that she is submerged in rock after having fallen from space, but said that it is \"left for your interpretation.\"\n\n**Reception**\n\nInsider interpreted through the album's music and lyrics that \"Planet Her\" is a place where \"midday skies are streaked with pink and orange\" and where \"following your sexual urges is uncomplicated and morally good, where the feminine is divine and it's summer year-round.\" Rolling Stone described the planet as an \"exquisitely strange and spectacularly camp world\" and noted that \"there's a bit of cheeky, sci-fi B movie references in the presentation but the content of the album itself is pristine pop fun.\"\n\n**Composition**\n\nPlanet Her is primarily a pop, hip-hop, and R&B record. It incorporates musical elements from a wide range of genres, such as afrobeat, reggaeton, hyperpop, and pop-rap. The album opens with a string of \"funky,\" \"fun\" and \"upbeat\" tracks and towards the second half, the tempo mostly slows down for the more \"introspective\" tracks and Doja Cat \"drifts from her usual raunchy lyricism to try out lovesick lullabies and heartbreak ballads, allowing the music to slow and a newfound vulnerability to emerge.\"\n\n**Release and promotion**\n\nDoja Cat first introduced the term \"Planet Her\" in August 2020 during the opening sequence of her performance at the 2020 MTV Video Music Awards, where she impersonated a television commentator and stated \"Performing live on Planet Her is Doja Cat Enjoy!\" In late December 2020, she began subliminally teasing the album on Twitter by repeatedly tweeting the phrase \"Planet Her 2021\" over the course of a few weeks. On January 5, 2021, Doja Cat followed eight musicians on the platform and subsequently tweeted \"Following them for a reason Guess why.\", alluding to imminent collaborations with the followed artists.\n\n**Singles**\n\n\"Kiss Me More\" with SZA, was released as the lead single off the album on April 9, 2021.

It is part of the Federal Correctional Complex, Florence, which is run by the Federal Bureau of Prisons under the United States Department of Justice. The complex also includes a minimum-security camp, which, as of 2019, held more prisoners than the supermax unit.\n\n## Function\n\nThe supermax unit at ADX Florence is designed to house inmates who require close supervision and segregation from the general prison population. The prison is secure and highly restrictive, with a focus on safety and control. The number of inmates has declined in recent years, and as of 2021, two housing units had closed due to low population.\n\n## History\n\nThe history of ADX Florence dates back to 1983, when two correctional officers, Merle Clutts and Robert Hoffman, were fatally stabbed by inmates at the United States Penitentiary, Marion. The incident highlighted the need for a more secure and controlled prison environment. As a result, the Federal Bureau of Prisons began planning for a new supermax facility.\n\n## Inmate Population\n\nThe supermax unit at ADX Florence is designed to house up to 474 inmates. However, it has never been at full capacity. As of 2024, the unit housed 344 male inmates, each assigned to one of six security levels. The inmates are carefully monitored and controlled, with a focus on safety and security.\n\n## Prison Facility\n\nADX Florence is a 37-acre complex located in an unincorporated area of Colorado. The prison is approximately 100 miles south of Denver and 40 miles south of Colorado Springs. The complex is part of the Federal Correctional Complex, Florence, which includes three correctional facilities, each with a different security rating. The prison is designed to be secure and highly restrictive, with a focus on safety and control.\n\n## Controversies\n\nADX Florence has been the subject of controversy and criticism over the years. In 2012, eleven inmates filed a federal class-action suit against the Bureau of Prisons, alleging chronic abuse and failure to properly diagnose prisoners who are seriously mentally ill. The suit highlighted the need for improved mental health services and more humane treatment of inmates.\n\n## Suicides at the Prison\n\nAt least eight inmates have died, or are suspected of having died, by suicide at the facility. The high number of suicides has raised concerns about the mental health services and the treatment of inmates at ADX Florence.\n\n## Notable Inmates\n\nADX Florence has housed a number of notable inmates over the years, including Thomas Silverstein, who was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of a fellow inmate. Other notable inmates have included Clayton Fountain, who was also sentenced to life in prison for the murder of a fellow inmate.\n\n## In Popular Culture\n\nADX Florence has been featured in popular culture, including in the 2023 fiction thriller novel \"Only the Dead\" by author and retired US Navy SEAL Jack Carr. The protagonist, James Reece, is housed in Range 13 after being suspected of an assassination attempt on a fictitious characterization of the President of the United States.\n\n## See Also\n\n* Federal Bureau of Prisons\n* United States Department of Justice\n* Supermax prison\n* Mental health services in prisons\n\n## Further Reading\n\n* \"The Alcatraz of the Rockies: A History of ADX Florence\" by Robert F.

Her first appearance was in the season 3 finale as a potential love interest for the character of Sheldon Cooper (Jim Parsons). In season 4, she began as a recurring character playing Sheldon's \"friend that's a girl, but not a girlfriend.\" Beginning with the 8th episode of season 4, she became part of the main cast. Amy is a neurobiologist, a field that is related to Bialik's real-life doctorate in neuroscience. Bialik's performance in The Big Bang Theory earned her Emmy Award nominations in 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series.\n\n**2021–2023: Jeopardy! Host and Directorial Debut**\n\nFrom May 31 to June 11, 2021, Bialik was a guest host of Jeopardy!. On August 11, 2021, it was announced that she would host the series' future primetime specials and spinoffs. When executive producer Mike Richards resigned as host after one week, it was announced that Bialik would guest-host the show for three weeks. Her contract was extended to seven weeks; she would then alternate with Ken Jennings for the rest of the calendar year. On December 8, 2021, it was announced that Bialik and Jennings would continue to host the show for the rest of the 2021–22 season. On July 27, 2022, it was announced that Bialik and Jennings would be the show's permanent hosts in a job-sharing arrangement.\n\nAdvocacy and Activism\n\nBialik founded Grok Nation (originally styled \"GrokNation\") in August 2015 to facilitate conversations among people of different ages and backgrounds about issues. It aimed to engage readers in online conversations that lead to offline action, mobilizing them to change the world as a community. To grok means to understand in a profound manner (The term comes from the 1961 science fiction novel Stranger in a Strange Land by Robert A Heinlein.)\n\nSupport of Israel\n\nDuring the 2014 Gaza Conflict, she donated money to the Israel Defense Forces for armored vests. She has been vocal since the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel saying she was \"speechless\" amid the \"exceptionally painful\" conflict between Israel and Hamas. She has also spoken up against antisemitism on college campuses in the United States. On November 6, 2023, Bialik and Noa Tishby stated that they were against calls for a ceasefire in the war between Israel and Palestine saying, \"No country in the world would be asked to stop protecting itself under attack from all of its borders.\"\n\nThe New York Times Op-Ed\n\nAfter the Harvey Weinstein sexual misconduct allegations surfaced, Bialik wrote a New York Times op-ed in 2017 in which she described the entertainment industry as one \"that profits on the exploitation of women...[and] the objectification of women.\" With regard to protecting herself from sexual harassment, Bialik wrote that she dressed modestly and did not act flirtatiously with men, adding, \"In a perfect world, women should be free to act however they want But our world isn't perfect Nothing—absolutely nothing—excuses men for assaulting or abusing women But we can't be naïve about the culture we live in.\" Bialik's article drew backlash from critics who said she was insinuating that modesty and a conservative wardrobe can guard one against sexual assault. Patricia Arquette tweeted, \"I have to say I was dressed non-provocatively at 12 walking home from school when men masturbated at me It's not the clothes.\" In response, Bialik said she regretted that the piece \"became what it became\" and participated in a Facebook Live event hosted by The New York Times to answer questions about it.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nIn 2014, Bialik was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from Boston University.\n\nMarriage and Family\n\nBialik married Michael Stone on August 31, 2003, in a Victorian-themed ceremony that included traditional Jewish wedding customs. Stone, who was raised Mormon but left the church as an adolescent, converted to Judaism to marry Bialik. They have two sons together. Bialik returned to television in 2010, as opposed to continuing her scientific career, so she could spend more time with her children.\n\nReligious Beliefs\n\nIn a 2012 interview, Bialik called herself an \"aspiring Modern Orthodox.\" She has also appeared in several YouTube cameos as Blossom and Amy Farrah Fowler, asking questions about Jewish beliefs. The videos are produced by Allison Josephs, Bialik's Judaism study partner, whom she met with the help of Partners in Torah. Bialik is a frequent contributor to the Jewish parenting website, Kveller.\n\nVeganism\n\nBialik is a vegan and a founding member of the Shamayim V'Aretz Institute, a Jewish organization that advocates the ethical treatment of animals. In 2017, she announced that she and vegan chef Ali Cruddas had opened Bodhi Bowl, a vegan restaurant in Los Angeles. It closed permanently in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nVaccination Beliefs\n\nIn a 2009 interview, Bialik said of her family: \"We are a non-vaccinating family, but I make no claims about people's individual decisions. We based ours on research and discussions with our pediatrician, and we've been happy with that decision, but obviously there's a lot of controversy about it.\" In October 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, she said that though she had not received a vaccination in 30 years, she planned to be vaccinated against both the flu and the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and that \"As of today, my children may not

married her high school boyfriend, but the marriage ended in divorce shortly afterwards [47] In October 1995, Lori married again [48] and had a son named Colby in 1996, before divorcing in 1998 [36] She worked for some time as a hairdresser [30] In 2004, she was a contestant in the Mrs Texas beauty pageant [49]\n\n\nLori Vallow and Chad Daybell meet\nAround 2015, Lori became interested in Chad Daybell's Standing in Holy Places series of books [59] In 2017–2018, she became increasingly invested in radical religious beliefs, reading books about near-death experiences and listening to podcasts by excommunicated Mormons [60]\n\n\nLori and Chad's beliefs\nReincarnation – which is not accepted by the LDS Church – played a key part in Chad's religious views [2] He claimed to have lived 31 previous lives [62] on different planets [2] and that Lori had lived 21 separate lives, five of which coincided with his own experiences on Earth Lori eventually told Melanie Gibb that she and Chad were sealed due to their previous marriages in their past lives, despite their respective spouses being still alive When Gibb suggested that Chad and Lori should divorce their spouses, Lori told her they were \"not allowed to\" because of information they were receiving \"from the other side of the veil\" [62]\n\n\nKilling of Charles Vallow\nBy February 2019, Lori reportedly informed Charles that \"she no longer cared about him or J.J.\" She then vanished for 58 days [54] The same month, Charles filed for divorce, citing threats to his life, as well as the theft of his truck and US$35,000 from their joint bank accounts [87] According to Charles' filing, Lori had told him that he was possessed by a \"dark spirit\" called \"Ned Schneider\", [88] that she was \"a God assigned to carry out the work of the 144,000 at Christ's Second Coming\" which would happen in July 2020, and that she would murder him if he got in the way of her mission [83]\n\n\nDisappearances of Tylee and J.J.\nBy the

death, he also told Todd and Alice Gilbert that he had found the woman he would marry Days later, Chad brought Lori to meet the Gilberts Alice Gilbert described the situation as \"awkward\", with Chad and Lori laughing and giggling, and being very affectionate to each other, more than Gilbert had seen Chad be with Tammy Chad also mentioned that Lori \"recently had a daughter who had passed away\" [113]\n\n\nInvestigations\nProsecutors in Idaho became involved in the case when police requested a warrant for locating the Jeep from which Brandon Boudreaux had been shot at in Arizona [132] On December 6, 2019, Melanie Gibb contacted the police, revealing that both Lori and Chad had called her separately on November 26 and had asked her to tell police that J.J was with her [128] Police efforts to locate J.J led to the discovery that Tylee was also missing [133] A connection was made between the investigations in Idaho and those in Arizona [132] Law enforcement agencies intensified their inquiries about the children's whereabouts, as well as Chad and Lori's departure from Idaho It was also decided to further investigate Tammy's death: her body was exhumed for an autopsy on December 11 [9] [36]\n\n\nDeath of Alex Cox\nOn November 24, 2019, Chad Daybell gave Alex Cox a \"patriarchal blessing\", which he had no standing to give in the LDS Church, [136] saying that Alex had assisted him and Lori \"in ways that can never be repaid\" Chad called Alex a prophet and a hero [137] and predicted he would have a future as a \"messenger of the Lord\" The recording of this \"blessing\" was later found by investigators on Lori's iCloud account [136]\n\n\nArrests and criminal charges\nOn February 20, 2020, Lori was arrested in Hawaii by the Kauai Police Department [142]

[146] The bodies were located in an area the Daybell family called the pet cemetery, as it had been used to bury their cats and dogs [147] As the property was being searched, Chad phoned Lori in jail to warn her about the situation After police found and began to unearth the bodies, he tried to drive off from the scene, but was chased down and apprehended [148] He was arrested for obstruction or concealment of evidence The next day, his bail was set at $1 million [12] [13]\n\n\nCharges\nOn July 2, 2020, prosecutors dropped two charges against Lori related to desertion and nonsupport of dependent children, and instead charged her with obstruction or concealment of evidence regarding her children's remains [161]\n\n\nTrials\nA jury trial for the Madison County charges against Lori was initially set for January 25–29, 2021 [161] On May 27, 2021, Lori was found incompetent and unfit to stand trial, and her case was stayed [167] On April 11, 2022, she was deemed competent to stand trial after mental health treatment [168] On October 6, 2022, after Lori's attorney filed several motions, Judge Steven W Boyce issued an order indicating the case was suspended until her competency to stand trial could be determined [169] On November 16, she was once again found competent [170]\n\n\nLori\nOn March 21, 2023, the judge removed the death penalty from Lori Vallow Daybell due to newly uncovered DNA evidence, discovered too close to the trial to be tested and admitted into court [174]\n\n\nChad\nOn November 9, 2023, Chad Daybell's legal team filed three motions to remove the death penalty in his murder trial The final motion stated that Lori had \"manipulated\" Chad \"through emotional and sexual control\" and that Chad had \"lesser culpability than his co-defendant, who did not face the death penalty\" [186] The motions were denied in December [187]\n\n\nDepictions in the media\nIn 2020, Investigation Discovery released the three-episode documentary series entitled Doomsday: The Missing Children, which contained first-hand accounts of JJ's grandparents Larry and Kay Woodcock, Lori's brother Adam Cox, and former KPHO-TV reporter Kim Powell [199]\n\n\nSee

disappearances of several individuals, including Charles Vallow, Lori Vallow's ex-husband, their children JJ and Tylee Ryan, and Tammy Daybell, Lori's new husband Chad Daybell's previous wife.

She grew up in a Mormon family and was raised with strong religious values. In 1992, at the age of 19, Lori married her high school boyfriend, but the marriage ended in divorce shortly afterwards.

Chad claimed to have lived 31 previous lives on different planets and that Lori had lived 21 separate lives, five of which coincided with his own experiences on Earth. Lori eventually told Melanie Gibb that she and Chad were sealed due to their previous marriages in their past lives, despite their respective spouses being still alive.\n\n## Killing of Charles Vallow\n\nBy February 2019, Lori reportedly informed Charles that \"she no longer cared about him or J.J.\" She then vanished for 58 days. The same month, Charles filed for divorce, citing threats to his life, as well as the theft of his truck and $35,000 from their joint bank accounts. According to Charles' filing, Lori had told him that he was possessed by a \"dark spirit\" called \"Ned Schneider,\" that she was \"a God assigned to carry out the work of the 144,000 at Christ's

[3] He then resumed his studies and graduated from BYU with a B.A in journalism [22] He married Tamara \"Tammy\" Douglas [3] on March 9, 1990 They had five children [22]\n\n\nLori Vallow Daybell\nLori Ryan Daybell, [b] also referred to as Lori Vallow Daybell, was born Lori Norene Cox on June 26, 1973, in Loma Linda, California [45] She grew up in a Mormon family [46] In 1992, at the age of 19, Lori married her high school boyfriend, but the marriage ended in divorce shortly afterwards [47] In October 1995, Lori married again [48] and had a son named Colby in 1996, before divorcing in 1998 [36] She worked for some time as a hairdresser [30] In 2004, she was a contestant in the Mrs Texas beauty pageant [49]\n\n\nLori Vallow and Chad Daybell meet\nAround 2015, Lori became interested in Chad Daybell's Standing in Holy Places series of books [59] In 2017–2018, she became increasingly invested in radical religious beliefs, reading books about near-death experiences and listening to podcasts by excommunicated Mormons [60]\n\n\nLori and Chad's beliefs\nReincarnation – which is not accepted by the LDS Church – played a key part in Chad's religious views [2] He claimed to have lived 31 previous lives [62] on different planets [2] and that Lori had lived 21 separate lives, five of which coincided with his own experiences on Earth Lori eventually told Melanie Gibb that she and Chad were sealed due to their previous marriages in their past lives, despite their respective spouses being still alive When Gibb suggested that Chad and Lori should divorce their spouses, Lori told her they were \"not allowed to\" because of information they were receiving \"from the other side of the veil\" [62]\n\n\nKilling of Charles Vallow\nBy February 2019, Lori reportedly informed Charles that \"she no longer cared about him or J.J.\" She then vanished for 58 days [54] The same month, Charles filed for divorce, citing threats to his life, as well as the theft of his truck and US$35,000 from their joint bank accounts [87] According to Charles' filing, Lori had told him that he was possessed by a \"dark spirit\" called \"Ned Schneider\", [88] that she was \"a God assigned to carry out the work of the 144,000 at Christ's Second Coming\" which would happen in July 2020, and that she would murder him if he got in the way of her mission [83]\n\n\nDisappearances of Tylee and J.J.\nBy the end of August, Lori relocated to Rexburg, Idaho, with her children Alex Cox also moved there [97] Just before moving to Idaho, Lori sold J.J.'s service dog [100]\n\n\nShooting of Brandon Boudreaux\nOn October 2, 2019, Brandon Boudreaux, the estranged husband of Lori's niece Melani, was shot at from a Jeep while driving home in Gilbert, Arizona The bullet missed Boudreaux's head by inches Boudreaux, who had been close to Charles and Lori Vallow's family, recognized the Jeep as a vehicle used by Tylee Ryan The Jeep drove away, but Boudreaux could give its license plate number to the police who identified it as being registered to Charles Vallow [58] [110]\n\n\nMurder of Tammy Daybell\nIn February 2019, Chad told his neighbors, Todd and Alice Gilbert, that he had had a vision that Tammy would pass away before her 50th birthday [113]\n\n\nChad Daybell and Lori Vallow's marriage and flight\nChad introduced Lori to his children the day after Tammy's funeral [122] One week after Tammy's death, he also told Todd and Alice Gilbert that he had found the woman he would marry Days later, Chad brought Lori to meet the Gilberts Alice Gilbert described the situation as \"awkward\", with Chad and Lori laughing and giggling, and being very affectionate to each other, more than Gilbert had seen Chad be with Tammy Chad also mentioned that Lori \"recently had a daughter who had passed away\" [113]\n\n\nInvestigations\nProsecutors in Idaho became involved in the case when police requested a warrant for locating the Jeep from which Brandon Boudreaux had been shot at in Arizona [132] On December 6, 2019, Melanie Gibb contacted the police, revealing that both Lori and Chad had called her separately on November 26 and had asked her to tell police that J.J was with her [128] Police efforts to locate J.J led to the discovery that Tylee was also missing [133] A connection was made between the investigations in Idaho and those in Arizona [132] Law enforcement agencies intensified their inquiries about the children's whereabouts, as well as Chad and Lori's departure from Idaho It was also decided to further investigate Tammy's death: her body was exhumed for an autopsy on December 11 [9] [36]\n\n\nDeath of Alex Cox\nOn November 24, 2019, Chad Daybell gave Alex Cox a \"patriarchal blessing\", which he had no standing to give in the LDS Church, [136] saying that Alex had assisted him and Lori \"in ways that can never be repaid\" Chad called Alex a prophet and a hero [137] and predicted he would have a future as a \"messenger of the Lord\" The recording of this \"blessing\" was later found by investigators on Lori's iCloud account [136]\n\n\nArrests and criminal charges\nOn February 20, 2020, Lori was arrested in Hawaii by the Kauai Police Department [142] On March 5, she was extradited back to Idaho [143]\n\n\nLori's arrest\nOn February 20, 2020, Lori was arrested in Hawaii by the Kauai Police Department [142] On March 5, she was extradited back to Idaho [143]\n\n\nDiscovery of the children's remains and Chad's arrest\nOn June 9, police found human remains buried in unmarked graves in the backyard of Chad's home during a search of the premises [146] The bodies were located in an area the Daybell family called the pet cemetery, as it had been used to bury their cats and dogs [147] As the property was being searched, Chad phoned Lori in jail to warn her about the situation After police found and began to unearth the bodies, he tried to drive off from the scene, but was chased down and apprehended [148] He was arrested for obstruction or concealment of evidence The next day, his bail was set at $1 million [12] [13]\n\n\nCharges\nOn July 2, 2020, prosecutors dropped two charges against Lori related to desertion and nonsupport of dependent children, and instead charged her with obstruction or concealment of evidence regarding her children's remains [161]\n\n\nTrials\nA jury trial for the Madison County charges against Lori was initially set for January 25–29, 2021 [161] On May 27, 2021, Lori was found incompetent and unfit to stand trial, and her case was stayed [167] On April 11, 2022, she was deemed competent to stand trial after mental health treatment [168] On October 6, 2022, after Lori's attorney filed several motions, Judge Steven W Boyce issued an order indicating the case was suspended until her competency to stand trial could be determined [169] On November 16, she was once again found competent [170]\n\n\nLori\nOn March 21, 2023, the judge removed the death penalty from Lori Vallow Daybell due to newly uncovered DNA evidence, discovered too close to the trial to be tested and admitted into court [174]\n\n\nChad\nOn November 9, 2023, Chad Daybell's legal team filed three motions to remove the death penalty in his murder trial The final motion stated that Lori had \"manipulated\" Chad \"through emotional and sexual control\" and that Chad had \"lesser culpability than his co-defendant, who did not face the death penalty\" [186] The motions were denied in December [187]\n\n\nDepictions in the media\nIn 2020, Investigation Discovery released the three-episode documentary series entitled Doomsday: The Missing Children, which contained first-hand accounts of JJ's grandparents Larry and Kay Woodcock, Lori's brother Adam Cox, and former KPHO-TV reporter Kim Powell [199]\n\n\nSee

{"title": "Harry_Potter_(film_series)", "content": "\nOrigins\nIn late 1997, film producer David Heyman's London offices received a copy of the first book in what would become Rowling's series of seven Harry Potter novels The book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was relegated to a low-priority bookshelf, where it was discovered by a secretary who read it and gave it to Heyman with a positive review Consequently, Heyman, who had originally disliked \"the rubbish title\", read the book himself Highly impressed by Rowling's work, he began the process that led to one of the most successful cinematic franchises of all time [10]\n\n\nCasting the roles of Harry, Ron, and Hermione\nIn 2000, after a seven-month search, lead actor Daniel Radcliffe was discovered by producer David Heyman and writer Steve Kloves seated just behind them in a theatre In Heyman's own words, \"There sitting behind me was this boy with these big blue eyes It was Dan Radcliffe I remember my first impressions: He was curious and funny and so energetic There was real generosity too, and sweetness But at the same time he was really voracious and with hunger for knowledge of whatever kind.\" [10]\n\n\nProduction\nFilming for the series began at Leavesden Studios, Hertfordshire, England, in September 2000 and ended in December 2010, with post-production on the final film lasting until summer 2011 [6] Leavesden Studios was the main base for filming Harry Potter, and it opened to the public as a studio tour in 2012 (renamed as Warner Bros Studios, Leavesden) [28]\n\n\nDirectors\nAfter Chris Columbus had finished working on Philosopher's Stone, he was hired to direct Chamber of Secrets The production started within a week after the release of the first film Columbus was set to direct all entries in the series, [34] but he did not want to return for Prisoner of Azkaban, claiming he was \"burned out\" [35] He moved to the position of producer, while Alfonso Cuarón was approached for the role of director He was initially nervous about directing the instalment since he had not read any of the books or seen the films After reading the series, he changed his mind and signed on to direct since he had immediately connected to the story [36]\n\n\nScripts\nSteve Kloves wrote the screenplays for all but the fifth film, which was penned by Michael Goldenberg Kloves had direct assistance from J.K Rowling, though she allowed him what he described as \"tremendous elbow room\" Rowling asked Kloves to remain faithful to the spirit of the books; thus, the plot and tone of each film and its corresponding book are virtually the same, albeit with some changes and omissions for purposes of cinematic style, time, and budget constraints Michael Goldenberg also received input from Rowling during his adaptation of the fifth novel; Goldenberg was originally considered to adapt the first novel before the studio chose Kloves [43]\n\n\nCast and crew\nAside from the three lead actors, other notable cast members include Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid, Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy, Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, and Dame Maggie Smith as Minerva McGonagall Richard Harris, who played the role of Professor Albus Dumbledore, died on 25 October 2002, causing the role to be re-cast to Michael Gambon for Prisoner of Azkaban Heyman and Cuarón chose Gambon to portray Dumbledore, which he did for all succeeding films Notable recurring cast members include Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange, Warwick Davis as Filius Flitwick, Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort, Brendan Gleeson as Alastor Moody, Richard Griffiths as Vernon Dursley, Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy, Gary Oldman as Sirius Black, Fiona Shaw as Petunia Dursley, Timothy Spall as Peter Pettigrew, David Thewlis as Remus Lupin, Emma Thompson as Sybill Trelawney, Mark Williams as Arthur Weasley, and Julie Walters as Molly Weasley.\n\n\nSet design\nThe production designer for all eight films is Stuart Craig Assisted by Stephenie McMillan, Craig has created iconic sets pieces including the Ministry of Magic, the Chamber of Secrets, Malfoy Manor, and the layout for the CGI Horcrux Cave Because the novels were being published as the films were being made, Craig was required to rebuild some sets for future films and alter the design of Hogwarts [48]\n\n\nCinematography\nSix directors of photography worked on the series: John Seale on the first film, Roger Pratt on the second and fourth, Michael Seresin on the third, Sławomir Idziak on the fifth, Bruno Delbonnel on the sixth, and Eduardo Serra on the seventh and eighth Delbonnel was considered to return for both parts of Deathly Hallows, but he declined, stating that he was \"scared of repeating\" himself [55] Delbonnel's cinematography in Half-Blood Prince gained the series its only Academy Award nomination for Best Cinematography As the series progressed, each cinematographer faced the challenge of shooting and lighting older sets (which had been around since the first few films) in unique and different ways [56] Chris Columbus said the series' vivid colouring decreased as each film was made [32] [57]\n\n\nEditing\nAlong with continuous changes in cinematographers, there have been five film editors to work in post-production on the series: Richard Francis-Bruce edited the first instalment, Peter Honess the second, Steven Weisberg the third, Mick Audsley the fourth, and Mark Day films five through eight.\n\n\nMusic\nThe Harry Potter series has had four composers John Williams scored the first three films: Philosopher's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, and Prisoner of Azkaban Due to a busy 2002 schedule, Williams brought in William Ross to adapt and conduct the score for Chamber of Secrets Williams also composed \"Hedwig's Theme\", the series' leitmotif which appears in all eight films [62]\n\n\nVisual effects\nThere have been many visual effects companies that work on the Harry Potter series Some of these include Rising Sun Pictures, Sony Pictures Imageworks, Double Negative, Cinesite, Framestore, and Industrial Light & Magic The latter three have worked on all the films in the series, while Double Negative and Rising Sun Pictures began their commitments with Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire, respectively Framestore contributed by developing many memorable creatures and sequences to the series [68] Cinesite was involved in producing both miniature and digital effects for the films [69] Producer David Barron said that \"Harry Potter created the UK effects industry as we know it On the first film, all the complicated visual effects were done on the  [US] west coast But on the second, we took a leap of faith and gave much of what would normally be given to Californian vendors to UK ones They came up trumps.\" Tim Burke, the visual effects supervisor, said many studios \"are bringing their work to UK effects companies Every facility is fully booked, and that wasn't the case before Harry Potter That's really significant.\" [31]\n\n\nFinal filming\nOn 12 June 2010, filming of the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 and Part 2 was completed with actor Warwick Davis stating on his Twitter account, \"The end of an Era – today is officially the last day of principal photography on 'Harry Potter' – ever I feel honoured to be here as the director shouts cut for the very last time Farewell Harry & Hogwarts, it's been magic!\" [70] However, reshoots of the epilogue scene were confirmed to begin in the winter of 2010 The reshoots were completed on 21 December 2010, marking the official closure of filming for the Harry Potter franchise [71] Exactly four years earlier on that day, Rowling's official website revealed the title of the final novel in the book series – Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows [72]\n\n\nFilms\nHarry Potter is an orphaned boy brought up by his unkind Muggle (non-magical) aunt and uncle At the

After the release of the fourth book in July 2000, the first film, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was released on 16 November 2001 In its opening weekend, the film grossed $90 million in the United States alone, which set a record opening worldwide The succeeding three motion picture adaptations followed suit in financial success, while garnering positive reviews from fans and critics The fifth film, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, was released by Warner Bros on 11 July 2007 in English-speaking countries, except for the UK and Ireland, which released the movie on 12 July

Harry Potter film up until the release of the final instalment of the series, Deathly Hallows Part 2, while Prisoner of Azkaban grossed the least [82] As well as being a financial success, the film series has also been a success among film critics [83] [84] Opinions of the films are generally divided among fans, with one group preferring the more faithful approach of the first two films, and another group preferring the more stylised character-driven approach of the later films [85] Rowling has been consistently supportive of all the films and evaluated Deathly Hallows as her \"favourite one\" in the series [86] [87] [88]\n\n\nCritical response\nAll the films have been a success financially and critically, making the franchise one of the major Hollywood \"tent-poles\" akin to James Bond, Star Wars, Indiana Jones and Pirates of the Caribbean The series is noted by audiences for growing visually darker and more mature as each film was released [32] [89] However, the films have generally divided fans of the books, with some preferring the more faithful approach of the first two films and others preferring the more stylised character-driven approach of the later films.\n\n\nAccolades\nAt the 64th British Academy Film Awards in February 2011, J K Rowling, David Heyman, David Barron, David Yates, Alfonso Cuarón, Mike Newell, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson

Awards.\n\n\nBox office performance\nAs of 2022 [update], the Harry Potter film series is the fourth highest-grossing film franchise of all time, with the eight films released grossing over $7.7 billion worldwide Without adjusting for inflation, this is higher than the first 22 James Bond films and the six films in the Star Wars original and prequel trilogies [132] Chris Columbus's Philosopher's Stone became the highest-grossing Harry Potter film worldwide upon completing its theatrical run in 2002, but it was eventually topped by David Yates's Deathly Hallows – Part 2, while Alfonso Cuarón's Prisoner of Azkaban grossed the least [133] [134] [135] [136]\n\n\nAll-time rankings\nHarry Potter was in the vanguard of a new approach to big-budget film-making Most modern

series is a collection of eight fantasy adventure films based on the novels by J.K. Rowling. The films were produced by Warner Bros. and distributed worldwide. The series follows the adventures of a young wizard named Harry Potter and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger as they attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\n\n**Origins**\n\nIn late 1997, film producer David Heyman's London offices received a copy of the first book in what would become Rowling's series of seven Harry Potter novels. The book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was relegated to a low-priority bookshelf, where it was discovered by a secretary who read it and gave it to Heyman with a positive review. Consequently, Heyman, who had originally disliked \"the rubbish title\", read the book himself. Highly impressed by Rowling's work, he began the process that led to one of the most successful cinematic franchises of all time.\n\n**Casting the roles of Harry, Ron, and Hermione**\n\nIn 2000, after a seven-month search, lead actor Daniel Radcliffe was discovered by producer David Heyman and writer Steve Kloves seated just behind them in a theatre. Heyman's own words recall, \"There sitting behind me was this boy with these big blue eyes. It was Dan Radcliffe. I remember my first impressions: He was curious and funny and so energetic. There was real generosity too, and sweetness. But at the same time he was really voracious and with hunger for knowledge of whatever kind.\"\n\n**Production**\n\nFilming for the series began at Leavesden Studios, Hertfordshire, England, in September 2000 and ended in December 2010, with post-production on the final film lasting until summer 2011. Leavesden Studios was the main base for filming Harry Potter, and it opened to the public as a studio tour in 2012 (renamed as Warner Bros Studios, Leavesden).\n\n**Directors**\n\nAfter Chris Columbus had finished working on Philosopher's Stone, he was hired to direct Chamber of Secrets. The production started within a week after the release of the first film. Columbus was set to direct all entries in the series, but he did not want to return for Prisoner of Azkaban, claiming he was \"burned out\". He moved to the position of producer, while Alfonso Cuarón was approached for the role of director. He was initially nervous about directing the instalment since he had not read any of the books or seen the films. After reading the series, he changed his mind and signed on to direct since he had immediately connected to the story.\n\n**Scripts**\n\nSteve Kloves wrote the screenplays for all but the fifth film, which was penned by Michael Goldenberg. Kloves had direct assistance from J.K. Rowling, though she allowed him what he described as \"tremendous elbow room\". Rowling asked Kloves to remain faithful to the spirit of the books; thus, the plot and tone of each film and its corresponding book are virtually the same, albeit with some changes and omissions for purposes of cinematic style, time, and budget constraints. Michael Goldenberg also received input from Rowling during his adaptation of the fifth novel. Goldenberg was originally considered to adapt the first novel before the studio chose Kloves.\n\n**Cast and crew**\n\nAside from the three lead actors, other notable cast members include Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid, Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy, Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, and Dame Maggie Smith as Minerva McGonagall. Richard Harris, who played the role of Professor Albus Dumbledore, died on 25 October 2002, causing the role to be re-cast to Michael Gambon for Prisoner of Azkaban. Heyman and Cuarón chose Gambon to portray Dumbledore, which he did for all succeeding films. Notable recurring cast members include Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange, Warwick Davis as Filius Flitwick, Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort, Brendan Gleeson as Alastor Moody, Richard Griffiths as Vernon Dursley, Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy, Gary Oldman as Sirius Black, Fiona Shaw as Petunia Dursley, Timothy Spall as Peter Pettigrew, David Thewlis as Remus Lupin, Emma Thompson as Sybill Trelawney, Mark Williams as Arthur Weasley, and Julie Walters as Molly Weasley.\n\n**Set design**\n\nThe production designer for all eight films is Stuart Craig. Assisted by Stephenie McMillan, Craig has created iconic sets pieces including the Ministry of Magic, the Chamber of Secrets, Malfoy Manor, and the layout for the CGI Horcrux Cave. Because the novels were being published as the films were being made, Craig was required to rebuild some sets for future films and alter the design of Hogwarts.\n\n**Cinematography**\n\nSix directors of photography worked on the series: John Seale on the first film, Roger Pratt on the second and fourth, Michael Seresin on the third, Sławomir Idziak on the fifth, Bruno Delbonnel on the sixth, and Eduardo Serra on the seventh and eighth. Delbonnel's cinematography in Half-Blood Prince gained the series its only Academy Award nomination for Best Cinematography. As the series progressed, each cinematographer faced the challenge of shooting and lighting older sets (which had been around since the first few films) in unique and different ways. Chris Columbus said the series' vivid colouring decreased as each film was made.\n\n**Editing**\n\nAlong with continuous changes in cinematographers, there have been five film editors to work in post-production on the series: Richard Francis-Bruce edited the first instalment, Peter Honess the second, Steven Weisberg the third, Mick Audsley the fourth, and Mark Day films five through eight.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe Harry Potter series has had four composers. John Williams scored the first three films: Philosopher's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, and Prisoner of Azkaban. Due to a busy 2002 schedule, Williams brought in William Ross to adapt and conduct the score for Chamber of Secrets. Williams also composed \"Hedwig's Theme\", the series' leitmotif which appears in all eight films.\n\n**Visual effects**\n\nThere have been many visual effects companies that work on the Harry Potter series. Some of these include Rising Sun Pictures, Sony Pictures Imageworks, Double Negative, Cinesite, Framestore, and Industrial Light & Magic. The latter three have worked on all the films in the series, while Double Negative and Rising Sun Pictures began their commitments with Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire, respectively. Framestore contributed by developing many memorable creatures and sequences to the series. Cinesite was involved in producing both miniature and digital effects for the films.\n\n**Films**\n\nThe Harry Potter series consists of eight films, each based on one of J.K. Rowling's novels. The first film, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was released in 2001. The subsequent films are:\n\n1. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002)\n2. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)\n3. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005)\n4. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007)\n5. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009)\n6. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 (2010)\n7. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 (2011)\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe Harry Potter films have been top-rank box office hits, with all eight releases on the list of highest-grossing films worldwide. Philosopher's Stone was the highest-grossing Harry Potter film up until the release of the final instalment of the series, Deathly Hallows Part 2, while Prisoner of Azkaban grossed the least. As well as being a financial success, the film series has also been a success among film critics. Opinions of the films are generally divided among fans, with one group preferring the more faithful approach of the first two films, and another group preferring the more stylised character-driven approach of the later films. Rowling has been consistently supportive of all the films and evaluated Deathly Hallows as her \"favourite one\" in the series.\n\n**Critical response**\n\nAll the films have been a success financially and critically, making the franchise one of the major Hollywood \"tent-poles\" akin to James Bond, Star Wars, Indiana Jones and Pirates of the Caribbean. The series is noted by audiences for growing visually darker and more mature as each film was released. However, the films have generally divided fans of the books, with some preferring the more faithful approach of the first two films and others preferring the more stylised character-driven approach of the later films.\n\n**Accolades**\n\nAt the 64th British Academy Film Awards in February 2011, J K Rowling, David Heyman, David Barron, David Yates, Alfonso Cuarón, Mike Newell, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson collected the Michael Balcon Award for Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema for the series.\n\n**Academy Awards**\n\nSix of the eight films were nominated for a total of 12 Academy Awards. The series has won several awards, including three BAFTA Awards and two National Movie Awards.\n\n**Box office performance**\n\nAs of 2022, the Harry Potter film series is the fourth highest-grossing film franchise of all time, with the eight films released grossing over $7.7 billion worldwide. Without adjusting for inflation, this is higher than the first 22 James Bond films and the six films in the Star Wars original and prequel trilogies. Chris Columbus's Philosopher's Stone became the highest-grossing Harry Potter film worldwide upon completing its theatrical run in 2002, but it was eventually topped by David Yates's Deathly Hallows – Part 2, while Alfonso Cuarón's Prisoner of Azkaban grossed the least.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nHarry Potter was in the vanguard of a new approach to big-budget film-making. Most modern blockbuster franchises have two things in common: they are based on known properties such as books and comics, and they are steered by respected but little-known directors. The series has had a significant impact on popular culture and has inspired numerous books, video games, and other forms of media.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English

what would normally be given to Californian vendors to UK ones They came up trumps.\" Tim Burke, the visual effects supervisor, said many studios \"are bringing their work to UK effects companies Every facility is fully booked, and that wasn't the case before Harry Potter That's really significant.\" [31]\n\n\nFinal filming\nOn 12 June 2010, filming of the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 and Part 2

governed by metropolitan municipalities, while the rest of the country is divided into district municipalities, each of which consists of several local municipalities After the 2016 elections, there were eight metropolitan municipalities, 44 district municipalities and 205 local municipalities [7]\n\n\nTimeline\n8:00 – Special voting begins for the over 1.1 million individuals registered [11]\n\n\n31 October 2021\n8:00 – Special voting begins for the over 1.1 million individuals registered [11]\n\n\n1 November 2021\n8:00 – Elections begin nationwide.\n\n\nPolitical parties\nThere are 325 parties contesting the election [19]\n\n\nPre-election coalition governments\nThe 2016 municipal elections resulted in many hung councils across South Africa The ANC lost its council majority in four metropolitan municipalities – Tshwane, Johannesburg, Nelson Mandela Bay, City of Ekurhuleni This consequently created an opportunity for opposition parties to form coalitions to achieve the mayoralties of these key municipalities The EFF was essentially seen as the kingmaker and voted with the DA to install DA mayors in three out of the four metros and also in smaller local municipalities [51] [52] [53] The ANC managed to hold on to the City of Ekurhuleni through a coalition with smaller parties, and later won back the City of Johannesburg [54] [55]\n\n\nCampaign issues\nCorruption and basic municipal management were significant campaign issues in the run up to the election The ANC lead their election campaign with the slogan \"We will do and be better\" in recognition of the governing party's weak record in municipal governance whilst committing to improve [62] The DA campaigned on \"get the basics right\" and \"getting things done\" also in reference to the ANC's weak record in municipal government whilst the EFF used the slogan \"Jobs and Land, Now!\" in a continuation of its 2016 election slogan [62]\n\n\nMunicipal governance\nThe ANC pledged select and appoint better local representatives who are \"committed to service delivery\" and to \"deliver services promptly and consistently.\" [63] This included a commitment to implement lifestyle audits and signed performance contracts [62] The party also promised to minimize the impact of the South African energy crisis by stabilising the state energy provider's, Eskom, financial stability and increase the use of renewable energy [62]\n\n\nCorruption\nThe ANC stated that they would \"spare no effort in rooting out corruption\" and committed to implement the Anti-corruption Strategy under the Justice and Crime Prevention Cluster, SARS Anti-Corruption Unit [63] The DA promised to eliminate corruption by adopting and applying \"best practice in good governance,\" [65] end the practice of cadre deployment, and appoint professional government officials; the party also highlighted the relatively high number of clean audits DA-run municipalities have received in the Western Cape [65] The EFF has proposed setting up corruption hotlines and compensating whistleblowers [62] The IFP promised to reduce corruption by establishing a specialised corruption court [66] GOOD party also promised to end cadre deployment and prosecute corrupt politicians [62] ActionSA promised to appoint ethical public officials, introduce lifestyle audits and minimum turnaround times on service delivery issues [62]\n\n\nDecentralisation\nPolitical parties debated and campaigned on the issue of decentralising power away from the national government towards local authorities, this is most pronounced in the Western Cape province [70] The DA wants policing, electricity generation, [71] taxation [72] and rail control [73] decentralised to the province, on the other hand the ANC wants to centralise what control local authorities have over policing to national government [74] Other parties such as the FF+, [75] Cape Coloured Congress and Cape Independence Party (CIP) explicitly campaigned on a tickets of outright independence for the Western Cape province [76] The DA has stated it supports the right to hold a referendum to Western Cape independence but does not support independence itself [77] Parties opposed to this call include the ANC, EFF, [78] Al-Jam-ah [79] and GOOD [77]\n\n\nEconomy\nThe ANC promised to reduce youth unemployment and increase educational opportunities [63] whilst strengthening social security for vulnerable groups and expanding mass employment programs [62] The DA stated that they would encourage economic growth in DA run municipalities by increasing the ease of doing business in them and reducing excessive bureaucracy [65] The EFF pledged to set up municipal level special economic zones to encourage economic growth, support street vendors and black-owned farms [62] The IFP committed to delivering jobs and enhance food security [66] GOOD promised to provide policy certainty for investors whilst reducing excessive bureaucracy for businesses [62] ActionSA promised to repeal restrictive legislation, support youth employment, and implement a property audit to identify and reuse abandoned or stolen buildings [62] The FF Plus promised to provide land in industrial areas to people who want to start businesses, free of charge and that local businesses must be preferred when it came to tenders [68]\n\n\nCrime\nThe

The elections were conducted by the Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) to elect representatives to local government councils across the country.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nLocal government in South Africa consists of municipalities of various types. The largest metropolitan areas are governed by metropolitan municipalities, while the rest of the country is divided into district municipalities, each of which consists of several local municipalities. After the 2016 elections, there were eight metropolitan municipalities, 44 district municipalities, and 205 local municipalities.\n\n**Timeline**\n\nThe elections were held on 1 November 2021. Special voting began on 31 October 2021 for individuals who were unable to vote on the main election day. A total of 1.1 million individuals were registered for special voting.\n\n**Political parties**\n\nA total of 325 parties contested the election. The main parties contesting the election were the African National Congress (ANC), the Democratic Alliance (DA), the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), and the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP).\n\n**Pre-election coalition governments**\n\nThe 2016 municipal elections resulted in many hung councils across South Africa. The ANC lost its council majority in four metropolitan municipalities – Tshwane, Johannesburg, Nelson Mandela Bay, and City of Ekurhuleni. This created an opportunity for opposition parties to form coalitions to achieve the mayoralties of these key municipalities. The EFF was essentially seen as the kingmaker and voted with the DA to install DA mayors in three out of the four metros and also in smaller local municipalities. The ANC managed to hold on to the City of Ekurhuleni through a coalition with smaller parties, and later won back the City of Johannesburg.\n\n**Campaign issues**\n\nCorruption and basic municipal management were significant campaign issues in the run-up to the election. The ANC led their election campaign with the slogan \"We will do and be better\" in recognition of the governing party's weak record in municipal governance while committing to improve. The DA campaigned on \"get the basics right\" and \"getting things done\" also in reference to the ANC's weak record in municipal government while the EFF used the slogan \"Jobs and Land, Now!\" in a continuation of its 2016 election slogan.\n\n**Municipal governance**\n\nThe ANC pledged to select and appoint better local representatives who are \"committed to service delivery\" and to \"deliver services promptly and consistently.\" This included a commitment to implement lifestyle audits and signed performance contracts. The party also promised to minimize the impact of the South African energy crisis by stabilizing the state energy provider's, Eskom, financial stability and increasing the use of renewable energy.\n\n**Corruption**\n\nThe ANC stated that they would \"spare no effort in rooting out corruption\" and committed to implement the Anti-corruption Strategy under the Justice and Crime Prevention Cluster, SARS Anti-Corruption Unit. The DA promised to eliminate corruption by adopting and applying \"best practice in good governance,\" end the practice of cadre deployment, and appoint professional government officials; the party also highlighted the relatively high number of clean audits DA-run municipalities have received in the Western Cape. The EFF has proposed setting up corruption hotlines and compensating whistleblowers. The IFP promised to reduce corruption by establishing a specialized corruption court. GOOD party also promised to end cadre deployment and prosecute corrupt politicians. ActionSA promised to appoint ethical public officials, introduce lifestyle audits, and minimum turnaround times on service delivery issues.\n\n**Decentralisation**\n\nPolitical parties debated and campaigned on the issue of decentralizing power away from the national government towards local authorities, which is most pronounced in the Western Cape province. The DA wants policing, electricity generation, taxation, and rail control decentralized to the province. On the other hand, the ANC wants to centralize what control local authorities have over policing to national government. Other parties such as the FF+, Cape Coloured Congress, and Cape Independence Party (CIP) explicitly campaigned on a ticket of outright independence for the Western Cape province. The DA has stated it supports the right to hold a referendum to Western Cape independence but does not support independence itself. Parties opposed to this call include the ANC, EFF, Al-Jam-ah, and GOOD.\n\n**Economy**\n\nThe ANC promised to reduce youth unemployment and increase educational opportunities while strengthening social security for vulnerable groups and expanding mass employment programs. The DA stated that they would encourage economic growth in DA-run municipalities by increasing the ease of doing business in them and reducing excessive bureaucracy. The EFF pledged to set up municipal level special economic zones to encourage economic growth, support street vendors, and black-owned farms. The IFP committed to delivering jobs and enhance food security. GOOD promised to provide policy certainty for investors while reducing excessive bureaucracy for businesses. ActionSA promised to repeal restrictive legislation, support youth employment, and implement a property audit to identify and reuse abandoned or stolen buildings. The FF Plus promised to provide land in industrial areas to people who want to start businesses, free of charge, and that local businesses must be preferred when it came to tenders.\n\n**Crime**\n\nThe ANC repeated previous election commitments to fight gender-based violence, reduce drug abuse, and focus on crime reduction in high crime urban areas. The DA promised to reduce crime by expanding investment in localized law enforcement in DA-run municipalities while focusing on the causes of crime. The IFP committed to working with traditional leaders to provide better security to communities.\n\n**Target municipalities**\n\nFollowing the 2019 general elections, political parties started to strategize and plan their 2021 municipal elections campaigns.

{"title": "Assassin's_Creed", "content": "\nDevelopment history\nWhile the games in the series have had several narrative arcs, Ubisoft views the series as currently having three periods of development and design philosophy Until 2015's Assassin's Creed Syndicate, the franchise was structured around single-player content, and while centering on open world spaces and incorporating several role-playing elements, were more action-adventure and stealth-oriented Period two, covering from Assassin's Creed Origins to Assassin's Creed Mirage, brought in more role-playing elements and live-service features to increase player engagement \n\n\nPeriod one\nThe first Assassin's Creed game originated out of ideas for a sequel for Ubisoft's video game Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, aiming for the seventh generation of video game consoles The Ubisoft Montreal team decided to take the gameplay from The Sands of Time into an open-world approach, taking advantage of the improved processing power to render larger spaces and crowds Narratively, the team wanted to move away from the Prince being someone next in line for the throne but to have to work for it; combined with research into secret societies led them to focus on the Order of Assassins, based upon the historical Hashashin sect of Ismaili, who were followers of Shia Islam, heavily borrowing from the novel Alamut [2] [3] Ubisoft developed a narrative where the player would control an Assassin escorting a non-playable Prince, leading them to call this game Prince of Persia: Assassin, [4] or Prince of Persia: Assassins [5] Ubisoft was apprehensive to a Prince of Persia game without the Prince as the playable character, but this led the marketing division to suggest the name Assassin's Creed, playing off the creed of the Assassins, \"nothing is true; everything is permitted\" Ubisoft Montreal ran with this in creating a new intellectual property, eliminating the Prince, and basing it around the Assassins and the Knights Templar in the Holy Land during the 12th century Additionally, in postulating what other assassinations they could account for throughout history, they came onto the idea of genetic memory and created the Animus device and modern storyline elements This further allowed them to explain certain facets of gameplay, such as accounting for when the player character is killed, similar to The Sands of Time [5]\n\n\nPeriod two\nAfter Syndicate, Ubisoft decided that the series needed a major reinvention across both gameplay and narrative It was decided to make the next game, Assassin's Creed Origins, closer to a role-playing video game than a stealth-action game, which would also bring a game with many more hours of play than previous titles Some long-standing features of the series were eliminated for this purpose, such as the social stealth mechanic This changed how missions were presented — rather than being linearly directed through the Animus, the player character could meet various quest givers in the game's world to receive missions [6] From the narrative side, Ubisoft placed the game before the formation of the Assassin Brotherhood in Ancient Egypt to make the player character, Bayek of Siwa, a medjay that people would respect and seek the help of [6] The modern-day storyline also shifted back to a single character, Layla Hassan The developers limited the number of playable sequences for her character compared to previous games but gave them more meaning, such as allowing the player to explore Layla's laptop with background information on the game's universe [6]\n\n\nFuture\nIn 2022, Ubisoft announced several additional games for the series Assassin's Creed Infinity has been described by its executive producer, Marc-Alexis Côté, as a \"new design philosophy\" for the series, [1] [11] as well as a hub that will provide the releases of future games [12]  According to Coté in 2024, the modern-day narrative of the series had become haphazard after the death of Miles in Assassin's Creed III through the introduction of Hassan in Assassin's Creed Origins due to the lack of main character and the number of studios involved, and Infinity is aimed to reestablish the modern-day side of the series [13]\n\n\nGameplay\nThe Assassin's Creed games are centered around one or more fictional members of the Order of the Assassins Their memories are experienced by an in-game character in the modern-day period through a device called the Animus and its derivations The Animus allows the user to explore these memories passed down via genetics Within the context of the game, this provides a diegetic interface to the real-world player of the game, showing them elements like health bars, a mini-map, and target objectives as if presented by the Animus Additionally, should the player cause the historical character to die or fail a mission, this is rectified as desynchronization of the genetic memory, allowing the player to try the mission again Through the Animus interface, the player can retry any past mission already completed; for example, in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, the player achieves better synchronization results by performing the mission in a specific manner, such as by only killing the mission's target The Animus also imparts special abilities to the modern-day character that helps them to see their target in a crowd or other unique points of interest [15] [16]\n\n\nStoryline\nThe Assassin's Creed games primarily revolve around the rivalry and conflict between two ancient secret societies: the Order of Assassins, who represent freedom, and the Knights Templar, who represent order Versions of these societies have existed for centuries, with the Assassins seeking to stop the Templars from gaining control of the Pieces of Eden, artifacts that can override free will to control people's minds [20]\n\n\nPremise\nThe Assassin's Creed games primarily revolve around the

centuries, with the Assassins seeking to stop the Templars from gaining control of the Pieces of Eden, artifacts that can override free will to control people's minds [20]\n\n\nStory arcs\nThe first five main games in the series focus on Desmond Miles, a bartender and former Assassin who learns he is a descendant of several important Assassins throughout history, including Altaïr Ibn-LaʼAhad from the Middle East during the Third Crusade; Ezio Auditore da Firenze from the Italian Renaissance; and Ratonhnhaké:ton (commonly known as Connor), a half-Mohawk, half-British Assassin during the American Revolution Desmond is used by Abstergo to find Pieces of Eden but is rescued by Lucy Stillman, an undercover agent for the Assassins With the help of two other Assassins, Shaun Hastings and Rebecca Crane, and later William Miles, Desmond's father and the leader of the modern-day Assassins, the group continue to explore Desmond's memories in the hopes of locating the Pieces of Eden before Abstergo In the process, they learn about the Isu and come into contact with Juno, who kills Lucy, revealed to be a double agent for the Templars The group ultimately finds the Grand Temple, and Desmond activates the global aurora borealis device in time to block the solar flare, at the cost of his own life [20]\n\n\nRelease history\nThe following table lists the main and spin-off games of the franchise, along with their release years and the respective platform(s) they released on:\n\n\nMain series\nThe first game in the series was released in November 2007 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and in April 2008 for Microsoft Windows It features a historical recreation of the Holy Land (primarily the cities of Masyaf, Jerusalem, Acre, and Damascus) in the late 12th century Its narrative includes real historical figures and events from that time period The storyline consists of two portions: one set during the modern-day, which follows Desmond Miles; and one set in 1191, which follows Desmond's ancestor, Altaïr Ibn-LaʼAhad, a member of the Assassin Order during the time of the Third Crusade Desmond's story begins with his abduction by pharmaceutical company Abstergo Industries, whose lead scientist, Dr Warren Vidic, forces him to explore Altaïr's memories through a machine called the Animus that allows him to connect with his ancestors' DNA In doing so, Abstergo

Assassin's Creed series is a popular video game franchise created by Ubisoft, a French multinational video game developer and publisher. The series is set in a fictional universe that spans multiple centuries, with a focus on historical and cultural events. The games typically follow a protagonist who is a member of the Assassin Brotherhood, a secret society that fights against the Templars, a opposing organization that seeks to control humanity.\n\nIntroduction\nThe Assassin's Creed series has a rich history, with the first game released in 2007. Since then, the series has grown to include numerous mainline games, spin-offs, and adaptations. The series has been praised for its engaging storylines, immersive gameplay, and detailed historical settings. However, the series has also faced criticism for its annual release schedule, technical issues, and shift towards role-playing mechanics.\n\nDevelopment History\nThe Assassin's Creed series has undergone significant changes over the years, with various development teams and design philosophies. The first Assassin's Creed game originated out of ideas for a sequel to Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, aiming for the seventh generation of video game consoles. The Ubisoft Montreal team decided to take the gameplay from The Sands of Time into an open-world approach, taking advantage of the improved processing power to render larger spaces and crowds. Narratively, the team wanted to move away from the Prince being next in line for the throne but to have to work for it; combined with research into secret societies led them to focus on the Order of Assassins, based upon the historical Hashashin sect of Ismaili, who were followers of Shia Islam, heavily borrowing from the novel Alamut.\n\nPeriod One\nThe first Assassin's Creed game was released in November 2007 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and in April 2008 for Microsoft Windows. It features a historical recreation of the Holy Land (primarily the cities of Masyaf, Jerusalem, Acre, and Damascus) in the late 12th century. Its narrative includes real historical figures and events from that time period. The storyline consists of two portions: one set during the modern-day, which follows Desmond Miles; and one set in 1191, which follows Desmond's ancestor, Altaïr Ibn-LaʼAhad, a member of the Assassin Order during the time of the Third Crusade. Desmond's story begins with his abduction by pharmaceutical company Abstergo Industries, whose lead scientist, Dr Warren Vidic, forces him to explore Altaïr's memories through a machine called the Animus that allows him to connect with his ancestors' DNA. In doing so, Abstergo hopes to find powerful artifacts called Pieces of Eden, which the Assassins and their rivals, the Knights Templar, have fought over for centuries.\n\nAssassin's Creed II\nAssassin's Creed II is a direct sequel to the first game and was released in November 2009 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, in March 2010 for Windows, and in October 2010 for OS X. The modern-day narrative again follows Desmond, who escapes from Abstergo (revealed at the end of the previous game as a front for the modern-day Templars) with the aid of Assassin mole Lucy Stillman and is taken to her team's hideout. Hoping to train Desmond as an Assassin, they put him in the Animus 2.0, where he begins to suffer from the bleeding effect; this allows Desmond to gain his ancestors' skills, but it also damages his mind, as he begins to involuntarily experience flashes of his ancestors' memories outside of the Animus. Meanwhile, the main narrative takes place at the height of the Italian Renaissance in the late 15th century and follows Desmond's Italian ancestor Ezio Auditore da Firenze, a young nobleman from Florence who is forced to become an Assassin after his father and brothers are killed by the Templars.\n\nAssassin's Creed: Brotherhood\nAssassin's Creed: Brotherhood is the sequel to Assassin's Creed II, and was released in November 2010 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, in March 2011 for Windows, and in May 2011 for OS X. The game begins immediately after the events of its predecessor, at the end of which Desmond was warned by Minerva, a member of the First Civilization, about a solar flare that will hit the Earth in a few months' time. Desmond and his friends travel to Monteriggioni, where they set up a new base and use the Animus to find the Temple of Juno, another First Civilization member, which houses Ezio's own Apple of Eden and the key to stopping the solar flare.\n\nAssassin's Creed: Revelations\nAssassin's Creed: Revelations is the final installment of the Ezio Trilogy and was released in November 2011 for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Windows. Following the events of Brotherhood, where he was possessed by Juno and forced to kill Lucy (who, unbeknownst to him, was a Templar double agent), Desmond has fallen into a coma and was put back into the Animus to save his mind. Within the computerized core of the Animus, Desmond meets the preserved consciousness of Abstergo's previous Animus test subject, Clay Kaczmarek, who explains that Desmond's mind must achieve full synchronization with Altaïr and Ezio, or else he will fall into dementia. Desmond continues exploring the memories of Ezio, who, a few years after the events of Brotherhood, travels to Constantinople to find five keys needed to open a library built by Altaïr, which is said to contain the power to end the Assassin–Templar conflict.\n\nAssassin's Creed III\nAssassin's Creed III was released in October 2012 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and in November 2012 for Wii U and Windows. A remastered version of the game with enhanced visuals was released for Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in March 2019 and for Nintendo Switch in May 2019. This is the final game in the series to follow Desmond, who travels to the First Civilization's Grand Temple in New York with his friends and father to use the technology inside to prevent the solar flare set to hit the Earth in several weeks' time. To access this technology, Desmond must undertake missions across the globe to retrieve 'batteries' to power the Temple, as well as an ancient key to the Temple's inner chambers. To find the latter, Desmond uses the Animus to relive the memories of two of his ancestors who were in possession of the key at various points in time: Haytham Kenway, a British Templar from the 18th century who travels to the American colonies to establish a strong Templar presence on the continent and find the Grand Temple; and Ratonhnhaké:ton (later known as Connor), Haytham's half-Mohawk son, who becomes an Assassin to exact revenge on the Templars, whom he blames for the destruction of his village and the death of his mother in his youth.\n\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag was released in October 2013 for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Wii U and in November 2013 for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Windows. Following the events of Assassin's Creed III, at the end of which Desmond sacrificed himself to save the Earth, Abstergo retrieved samples from his body to continue exploring the memories of his ancestors. The player character is an unnamed Abstergo employee tasked with analyzing the memories of Edward Kenway, a famous 18th-century pirate and Connor's grandfather, ostensibly to gather material for an Animus-powered interactive feature film; in reality, Abstergo are searching for the Observatory, a First Civilization structure that allows the user to see through the eyes of a subject to find them anywhere on the planet.

During their investigation, the player accidentally trips a hidden memory file that infects the Animus servers. They must complete Shay's memories to clean the servers while Abstergo is put under lockdown. The main narrative takes place during the Seven Years' War, and follows Shay, who starts out as a talented, but insubordinate Assassin trainee. After witnessing the Assassins' hypocrisy and willingness to sacrifice civilians in their blind pursuit of the Pieces of Eden, Shay betrays them and joins the Templars, helping his newfound allies hunt down members of his former Brotherhood to prevent them from endangering more innocent lives.\n\nAssassin's Creed: Unity\nAssassin's Creed: Unity was released concurrently with Rogue in November 2014 for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows, and Google Stadia.

\"Assassin's_Creed\" following this outline:\n\n\nDevelopment history\nWhile the games in the series have had several narrative arcs, Ubisoft views the series as currently having three periods of development and design philosophy Until 2015's Assassin's Creed Syndicate, the franchise was structured around single-player content, and while centering on open world spaces and incorporating several role-playing elements, were more action-adventure and stealth-oriented Period two, covering from Assassin's Creed Origins to Assassin's Creed Mirage, brought in more role-playing elements and live-service features to increase player engagement \n\n\nPeriod one\nThe first Assassin's Creed game originated out of ideas for a sequel for Ubisoft's video game Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, aiming for the seventh generation of video game consoles The Ubisoft Montreal team decided to take the gameplay from The Sands of Time into an open-world approach, taking advantage of the improved processing power to render larger spaces and crowds Narratively, the team wanted to move away from the Prince being someone next in line for the throne but to have to work for it; combined with research into secret societies led them to focus on the Order of Assassins, based upon the historical Hashashin sect of Ismaili, who were followers of Shia Islam, heavily borrowing from the novel Alamut [2] [3] Ubisoft developed a narrative where the player would control an Assassin escorting a non-playable Prince, leading them to call this game Prince of Persia: Assassin, [4] or Prince of Persia: Assassins [5] Ubisoft was apprehensive to a Prince of Persia game without the Prince as the playable character, but this led the marketing division to suggest the name Assassin's Creed, playing off the creed of the Assassins, \"nothing is true; everything is permitted\" Ubisoft Montreal ran with this in creating a new intellectual property, eliminating the Prince, and basing it around the Assassins and the Knights Templar in the Holy Land during the 12th century Additionally, in postulating what other assassinations they could account for throughout history, they came onto the idea of genetic memory and created the Animus device and modern storyline elements This further allowed them to explain certain facets of gameplay, such as accounting for when the player character is killed, similar to The Sands of Time [5]\n\n\nPeriod two\nAfter Syndicate, Ubisoft decided that the series needed a major reinvention across both gameplay and narrative It was decided to make the next game, Assassin's Creed Origins, closer to a role-playing video game than a stealth-action game, which would also bring a game with many more hours of play than previous titles Some long-standing features of the series were eliminated for this purpose, such as the social stealth mechanic This changed how missions were presented — rather than being linearly directed through the Animus, the player character could meet various quest givers in the game's world to receive missions [6] From the narrative side, Ubisoft placed the game before the formation of the Assassin Brotherhood in Ancient Egypt to make the player character, Bayek of Siwa, a medjay that people would respect and seek the help of [6] The modern-day storyline also shifted back to a single character, Layla Hassan The developers limited the number of playable sequences for her character compared to previous games but gave them more meaning, such as allowing the player to explore Layla's laptop with background information on the game's universe [6]\n\n\nFuture\nIn 2022, Ubisoft announced several additional games for the series Assassin's Creed Infinity has been described by its executive producer, Marc-Alexis Côté, as a \"new design philosophy\" for the series, [1] [11] as well as a hub that will provide the releases of future games [12]  According to Coté in 2024, the modern-day narrative of the series had become haphazard after the death of Miles in Assassin's Creed III through the introduction of Hassan in Assassin's Creed Origins due to the lack of main character and the number of studios involved, and Infinity is aimed to reestablish the modern-day side of the series [13]\n\n\nGameplay\nThe Assassin's Creed games are centered around one or more fictional members of the Order of the Assassins Their memories are experienced by an in-game character in the modern-day period through a device called the Animus and its derivations The Animus allows the user to explore these memories passed down via genetics Within the context of the game, this provides a diegetic interface to the real-world player of the game, showing them elements like health bars, a mini-map, and target objectives as if presented by the Animus Additionally, should the player cause the historical character to die or fail a mission, this is rectified as desynchronization of the genetic memory, allowing the player to try the mission again Through the Animus interface, the player can retry any past mission already completed; for example, in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, the player achieves better synchronization results by performing the mission in a specific manner, such as by only killing the mission's target The Animus also imparts special abilities to the modern-day character that helps them to see their target in a crowd or other unique points of interest [15] [16]\n\n\nStoryline\nThe Assassin's Creed games primarily revolve around the rivalry and conflict between two ancient secret societies: the Order of Assassins, who represent freedom, and the Knights Templar, who represent order Versions of these societies have existed for centuries, with the Assassins seeking to stop the Templars from gaining control of the Pieces of Eden, artifacts that can override free will to control people's minds [20]\n\n\nPremise\nThe Assassin's Creed games primarily revolve around the

Rebecca Crane, and later William Miles, Desmond's father and the leader of the modern-day Assassins, the group continue to explore Desmond's memories in the hopes of locating the Pieces of Eden before Abstergo In the process, they learn about the Isu and come into contact with Juno, who kills Lucy, revealed to be a double agent for the Templars The group ultimately finds the Grand Temple, and Desmond activates the global aurora borealis device in time to block the solar flare, at the cost of his own life [20]\n\n\nRelease history\nThe following table lists the main and spin-off games of

and at the beginning of high school, another of his qualities became evident: his leadership over his classmates Escobar and his cousin Gustavo Gaviria Rivero did small \"businesses\" at the Lucrecio Jaramillo Vélez high school, where they both studied They held raffles, exchanged comics, sold exams and lent money at low interest In this way, Pablo Escobar began to develop his \"ability\" for business and commerce.\n\n\nCriminal career\nEscobar started his criminal career with his gang by with small scams, thefts, and after stealing tombstones, sandblasting their inscriptions, and reselling them After dropping out of college, Escobar began to join gangs to steal cars [48] Escobar soon became involved in violent crime, employing criminals to kidnap people who owed him money and demand ransoms, sometimes tearing up ransom notes even when Escobar had received the ransom It is speculated that businessman Diego Echavarria Misas was kidnapped and eventually killed in the summer of 1971 with the participation of Escobar, who supposedly received a $50,000 ransom from the Echavarria family [49] [50] Escobar would repeat the same process with drug lord Fabio Restrepo, kidnapping and murdering him in 1975 [51] [52]\n\n\nEarly\nEscobar started his criminal career with his gang by with small scams, thefts, and after stealing tombstones, sandblasting their inscriptions, and reselling them After dropping out of college, Escobar began to join gangs to steal cars [48] Escobar soon became involved in violent crime, employing criminals to kidnap people who owed him money and demand ransoms, sometimes tearing up ransom notes even when Escobar had received the ransom It is speculated that businessman Diego Echavarria Misas was kidnapped and eventually killed in the summer of 1971 with the participation of Escobar, who supposedly received a $50,000 ransom from the Echavarria family [49] [50] Escobar would repeat the same process with drug lord Fabio Restrepo, kidnapping and murdering him in 1975 [51] [52]\n\n\nMedellín Cartel\nEscobar had been involved in organized crime for a decade when the cocaine trade began to spread in Colombia in the mid-1970s Escobar's meteoric rise caught the attention of the Colombian Security Service (DAS), who arrested him in May 1976 on his return from drug trafficking in Ecuador DAS agents found 39 kg of cocaine in the spare tire of Escobar's car Escobar managed to change the first judge in the lawsuit and the process expired, apparently by bribed the second judge, so he was released along with other prisoners Despite this, the case was reopened by Judge Mariela Espinosa, who also dropped the investigation due to threats against her life [54] The following year, the agents who arrested Escobar were assassinated Escobar continued to bribe and intimidate Colombian law enforcement agencies in the same fashion His carrot-and-stick strategy of bribing public officials and political candidates in Colombia, in addition to sending hitmen to murder the ones who rejected his bribes, came to be known as \"silver or lead\", meaning \"money or death\" [55] [46] [56] The Medellín Cartel and the Cali Cartel both managed to bribe Colombian politicians, and campaigned for both the Conservative and Liberal parties Although the difference between the two cartels was that the Medellín Cartel used its \"money or death\" law through a huge army of hitmen, the Cali Cartel preferred to use bribes by having politicians, journalists, police officers, army officers, judges, etc on its payroll [57] [58] Hence, Escobar and many other Colombian drug lords were pulling strings in every level of the Colombian government because many of the political candidates whom they backed financially were eventually elected [57] Although the Medellín Cartel was only established in the early 1970s, it expanded after Escobar met several drug lords on a farm in April 1978, and by the end of 1978 they had transported some 19,000 kilograms of cocaine to the United States [59]\n\n\nRise to prominence\nSoon, the demand for cocaine greatly increased in the United States, which led to Escobar organizing more smuggling shipments, routes, and distribution networks in South Florida, California, Puerto Rico, and other parts of the country He and cartel co-founder Carlos Lehder worked together to develop a new trans-shipment point in the Bahamas, an island called Norman's Cay about 350 km (220 mi) southeast of the Florida coast Escobar and Robert Vesco purchased most of the land on the island, which included a 1-kilometre (3,300 ft) airstrip, a harbor, a hotel, houses, boats, and aircraft, and they built a refrigerated warehouse to store the cocaine According to his brother, Escobar did not purchase Norman's Cay; it was instead a sole venture of Lehder's From 1978 to 1982, this was used as a central smuggling route for the Medellín Cartel With the enormous profits generated by this route, Escobar was soon able to purchase 20 square kilometres (7.7 sq mi) of land in Antioquia for several million dollars, on which he built the Hacienda Nápoles The luxury house he created contained a zoo, with more than two hundred species of exotic animals for the region, such as hippos, giraffes, elephants, zebras and ostriches, all introduced into the country as a result of bribes to the government entity INDERENA and the customs authorities; a lake, a sculpture garden; a private bullring; and other amenities for his family and the cartel Escobar made a show of this by producing a propaganda report about his Hacienda [61]\n\n\nEscobar's political career\nAt the height of his power, Escobar was involved in philanthropy in Colombia and paid handsomely for the staff of his cocaine lab Escobar spent millions developing some of Medellín's poorest neighborhoods He built housing complexes, parks, football stadiums, hospitals, schools, and churches [64] [65] His most famous charity work was the 'Medellín without slums' neighbourhood, aimed at people living in slums at the Medellín municipal dump [66] [67] Shortly before the presidential and regional elections of 1982 began, Escobar realized that he had to create a \"cover\" to protect his lucrative drug trade He began to cultivate an image of a respectable man, making contacts with politicians, financiers, lawyers, etc Considered until then a 'Robin Hood paisa' due to his help to the poor of Medellín, Escobar would enter politics with the help of Jairo Ortega Ramírez as a congressman representing Antioquia through the Liberal Renewal movement, [68] [69] although his godfather in politics was the liberal chieftain from Tolima Department Alberto Santofimio Botero This triumvirate initially supported the candidacy of Luis Carlos Galán, a dissident of the Liberal Party for his New Liberalism movement While campaigning politically in Medellín, Galán learned through his assistant Iván Marulanda that people whose fortunes were of dubious origin had joined the Liberal Renovation movement In Medellín's Berrío Park, Galán, without mentioning Escobar's name, publicly expelled him, rejecting the support of Escobar and others similar to him involved in shady business dealings [70] [71]\nDespite the opposition and warnings of his partners, in 1982, he successfully entered the Colombian Congress Although only an alternate, he was automatically granted parliamentary immunity and the right to a diplomatic passport under Colombian law At the same time, Escobar was gradually becoming a public figure, and because of his charitable work, he was known as \"Robin Hood Paisa\" He alleged once in an interview that his fortune came from a bicycle rental company he founded when he was 16 years old [72]\n\n\nWar against drugs and narcoterrorism\n Colombia will hand over criminals requested by the Crime Commission in other countries; so that they are punished in an exemplary manner, in this universal operation against an attack that is also universal.\n\nWar between drug cartels\nAlthough both cartels maintained a cordial relationship, the origin of the war between the Medellin and Cali cartels has varied origins One version suggests disagreement with the violent methods used by Escobar Added to this, the Cali Cartel opposed a \"war quota\" against the government by refusing to pay for it Another version suggests the Cali Cartel's zeal to take control of the drug market in Los Angeles and Miami since it currently monopolized drug trafficking in New York City, according to a DEA analysis [146] another version suggests that the Cali Cartel informed on Jorge Luis Ochoa, Escobar's partner, while Ochoa was in Buga, Valle del Cauca This has been denied since Ochoa and Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela had shared a cell in Spain where they were to be extradited to the United States, but both were repatriated to Colombia where they served ridiculous prison sentences [147] [148] [149] [150] [151] According to Jhon Jairo Velásquez 'Popeye', a hitman for the Medellín Cartel, the dispute between the two sides began due to disputes between employees of Pablo Escobar and Hélmer Herrera:\n\n\n1989 offensive and failed negotiations\nMinister of Justice Enrique Low Murtra signed the extradition orders for Escobar and his cartel associates [170] A few days later, the politician and candidate for mayor of Medellín, Juan Gómez Martínez, [171] [172] was saved from an attempted kidnapping claimed by Los Extraditables, while Jorge Luis Ochoa was released with impunity under the right of habeas corpus a month later.\n\n\nWave of kidnappings and failed negotiations\nOn December 15, 1989, Barco's government managed to kill the second leader of the Medellín cartel and its military leader, El Mexicano (Rodríguez Gacha) He was located by an informant working for the Cali Cartel on the northern coast of the country, where he was seeking refuge from the authorities' persecution Responsible for more than 2,000 homicides and claiming responsibility for the attack on the DAS tower, he was killed after a tough chase between the municipalities of Tolú and Coveñas in the Sucre Department, along with his son Freddy Rodríguez Celades, his main lieutenant Gilberto Rendón Hurtado and four hitmen from his security force Most of the terrorist attacks of the last few months were attributed to 'El Mexicano' [223] [224]\n\n\nNew kidnappings and attacks\nApart from an unfinished peace process, President César Gaviria inherited the \"war on drugs\" with which his predecessor had sought to reduce the Medellín Cartel and its network of hitmen, declared enemies of the State [252] Although during his presidential campaign he had shown total support for both the offensive and the measures taken by Barco, including the most feared by narco-terrorists; which was extradition by administrative means; once in office he hinted that the high economic and human cost of this war deserved the search for an alternative solution in which the strengthening of justice would be a key element On August 12, in any case, in a coup, men from the Elite Group of the police killed Gustavo Gaviria Rivero, Escobar's cousin and right-hand man [253] [254]\n\n\nSurrender and submission to justice\nTurbay's death motivated the families of the other hostages to seek their release on their own With only Francisco Santos, Beatriz Villamizar and Maruja Pachón remaining kidnapped, Villamizar was released on February 6, 1991, thanks to the efforts of her husband, Congressman Luis Guerrero At the same time, the Eudist priest Rafael García-Herreros who had been contacted by an emissary of Escobar, under his orders, saying that he was tired of his war and trusted him for an eventual surrender On his daily TV show 'El Minuto de Dios', García-Herreros had expressed Escobar's apparent interest in surrendering, but at the same time his doubts [284]\n\n\nLa Catedral prison\nBetween June 1991 and July 1992, Colombia experienced a period of relative peace, except for the government's war against the guerrillas, but such peace was superficial It is said that shortly before his surrender, Escobar had met with his remaining associates Gerardo Moncada and Federico 'Kiko' Galeano, the Castaño Gil brothers and other mid- and low-level gangsters Escobar, at that meeting, reaffirmed himself as the leader of the Medellin Cartel, and proclaimed himself the creator of the drug trafficking business, which is why he demanded that he be paid high sums of money for each shipment of drugs to the United States; going from being a drug lord to being an extortionist According to 'Popeye', the apparent surrender at La Catedral would be nothing more than a vacation due to the war that Escobar was waging against the government Escobar was confined in La Catedral with his older brother Roberto and several of his men; Otoniel González 'Otto', Carlos Aguilar 'Mugre' (The filth), John Jairo Velásquez 'Popeye', Valentín Taborda, Gustavo González 'Tavo', Jorge Eduardo Avendaño 'Tato' y Johnny Rivera 'El Palomo' (The pidgeon), José Fernando Ospina 'El Mago' (The Wizard), John Jairo Betancur 'Icopor' (Polystyrene), Carlos Díaz 'La Garra' (The Claw) y Alfonso León Puerta 'El Angelito' Except for a few who still had influence in Medellín; Mario Castaño 'Chopo', Brances Muñoz 'Tyson' and John Jairo Posada 'Titi'; as well as his partners Moncada and Galeano who were in charge of shipping the cocaine [307]\n\n\nEscape and final stage\nEscobar's escape represented the biggest mockery of the Gaviria government in the eyes of the public, and Colombian justice would end up being discredited internationally [353] The government reactivated the Elite Group, renaming it the Search Bloc, a body made up of the National Police and the National Army with the collaboration of the DEA to hunt down the fugitives and dismantle their criminal empire once and for all The leaders of the Cali Cartel were responsible for unleashing the war again, by activating a car bomb in Medellín that they attributed to their enemies from Antioquia, at the same time that they decided to finance Los Pepes [354] [355] [356]\n\n\nDeath\nThat they will never catch me in the great fucking life, and that from the jungle I will order them all to be killed and in the long run the ones who will lose will be them.\n\nAftermath of his death\nSoon after Escobar's death and the subsequent fragmentation of the Medellín Cartel, the cocaine market became dominated by the rival Cali Cartel until the mid-1990s when its leaders were either killed or captured by the Colombian government The Robin Hood image that Escobar had cultivated maintained a lasting influence in Medellín Many there, especially many of the city's poor whom Escobar had aided while he was alive, mourned his death, and over 25,000 people attended his funeral Some of them consider him a saint and pray to him for receiving divine help Escobar was buried at the Monte Sacro Cemetery [437]\n\n\nVirginia Vallejo's testimony\nOn 4 July 2006, Virginia Vallejo, a television anchorwoman romantically involved with Escobar from 1983 to 1987, offered Attorney General Mario Iguarán her testimony in the trial against former Senator Alberto Santofimio, who was accused of conspiracy in the 1989 assassination of presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galán Iguarán acknowledged that, although Vallejo had contacted his office on 4 July, the judge had decided to close the trial on 9 July, several weeks before the prospective closing date The action was seen as too late [438] [439]\n\n\nRole in the Palace of Justice siege\nAmong Escobar's biographers, only Vallejo has given a detailed explanation of his role in the 1985 Palace of Justice siege She stated that Escobar had financed the operation, which was committed by M-19; she blamed the army for the killings of more than 100 people, including 11 Supreme Court magistrates, M-19 members, and employees of the cafeteria Her statements prompted the reopening of the case in 2008; Vallejo was asked to testify, and many of the events she had described in her book and testimonial were confirmed by Colombia's Commission of Truth [444] [445] These events led to further investigation into the siege that resulted with the conviction of a high-ranking former colonel and a former general, later sentenced to 30 and 35 years in prison, respectively, for the forced disappearance of the detained after the siege [446] [447] Vallejo would subsequently testify in Galán's assassination [448] In her book, Amando a Pablo, odiando a Escobar (Loving Pablo, Hating Escobar), she had accused several politicians, including Colombian presidents Alfonso López Michelsen, Ernesto Samper, and Álvaro Uribe of having links to drug cartels [449]\n\n\nRelatives\nEscobar's widow (María Henao, now María Isabel Santos Caballero), son (Juan Pablo, now Sebastián Marroquín Santos) and daughter (Manuela) fled Colombia in 1995 after failing to find a country that would grant them asylum [453] Despite Escobar's numerous and continual infidelities, Maria remained supportive of her husband Members of the Cali Cartel even replayed their recordings of her conversations with Pablo for their wives to demonstrate how a woman should behave [454] This attitude proved to be the reason the cartel did not kill her and her children after Pablo's death, although the group demanded and received millions of dollars in reparations for Escobar's war against them Henao even successfully negotiated for her son's life by personally guaranteeing he would not seek revenge against the cartel or participate in the drug trade [455]\n\n\nHacienda Nápoles\nAfter Escobar's death, the ranch, zoo and citadel at Hacienda Nápoles were given by the government to low-income families under a law called Extinción de Dominio (Domain Extinction) The property has been converted into a theme park surrounded by four luxury hotels overlooking the zoo [476]\n\n\nEscobar Inc\nIn 2014, Roberto Escobar founded Escobar Inc with Olof K Gustafsson and registered Successor-In-Interest rights for his brother Pablo Escobar in California, United States [477]\n\n\nHippos\nEscobar kept four hippos in a private menagerie at Hacienda Nápoles They were deemed too difficult to seize and move after Escobar's death, and hence left on the untended estate By 2007, the animals had multiplied to 16 and had taken to roaming the area for food in the nearby Magdalena River [478] [479] In 2009, two adults and one calf escaped the herd and, after attacking humans and killing cattle, one of the adults (called \"Pepe\") was killed by hunters under authorization of the local authorities [479] As of early 2014, 40 hippos have been reported to exist in Puerto Triunfo, Antioquia Department, from the original four belonging to Escobar [480] As of 2016, without management, the population size is likely to more than double in the next decade [481]\n\n\nApartment demolition\nOn 22 February 2019, at 11:53 AM local time, Medellín authorities demolished the six-story Edificio Mónaco apartment complex in the El Poblado neighborhood where, according to retired Colombian general Rosso José Serrano, Escobar planned some of his most brazen attacks The building was initially built for Escobar's wife but was gutted by a Cali Cartel car bomb in 1988 and had remained unoccupied ever since, becoming an attraction to foreign tourists seeking out Escobar's physical legacy Mayor Federico Gutierrez had been pushing to raze the building and erect in its place a park honoring the thousands of cartel victims, including four presidential candidates and some 500 police officers Colombian President Ivan Duque said the demolition \"means that history is not going to be written in terms of the perpetrators, but by recognizing the victims\", hoping the demolition would showcase that the city had evolved significantly and had more to offer than the legacy left by the cartels [486]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn March 1976, the 26-year-old Escobar married María Victoria Henao Vallejo, who was 15 The relationship was discouraged by the Henao Vallejo family, who considered Escobar socially inferior; the pair eloped, despite being a close friend of Mario Henao Vallejo, who would become his brother-in-law [487] They had two children: Juan Pablo (now Sebastián Marroquín) and Manuela In 2007, the journalist Virginia Vallejo published her memoir Amando a Pablo, odiando a Escobar (Loving Pablo, Hating Escobar), in which she describes her romantic relationship with Escobar and the links of her lover with several presidents, Caribbean dictators, and high-profile politicians [488] Her book inspired the movie Loving Pablo (2017) [489] A drug distributor, Griselda Blanco, is also reported to have conducted a clandestine but passionate relationship with Escobar;

Born on December 1, 1949, in the small village of El Tablazo near Rionegro, Antioquia Department, Escobar belonged to the Paisa ethnic subgroup. His family was of Spanish origin, specifically from the Basque Country, and also had Italian roots.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nEscobar was the second of seven children, and his family lived in poverty. His father was a small farmer, and his mother was a teacher. Escobar's siblings in order of birth were Roberto de Jesus 'El Osito', Gloria Inés, Argemiro, Alba Marina, Luz María, and Luis Fernando. Luis Fernando was born in 1958 and murdered at the age of 19 in 1977. Escobar's early life was marked by hardship and struggle, which would later shape his future as a criminal.\n\n**Childhood and Youth**\n\nAccording to his mother, Escobar began to show insight and cunning as early as elementary school. At the beginning of high school, another of his qualities became evident: his leadership over his classmates. Escobar and his cousin Gustavo Gaviria Rivero did small \"businesses\" at the Lucrecio Jaramillo Vélez high school, where they both studied. They held raffles, exchanged comics, sold exams, and lent money at low interest. In this way, Pablo Escobar began to develop his \"ability\" for business and commerce.\n\n**Criminal Career**\n\nEscobar started his criminal career with small scams, thefts, and after stealing tombstones, sandblasting their inscriptions, and reselling them. After dropping out of college, Escobar began to join gangs to steal cars. Escobar soon became involved in violent crime, employing criminals to kidnap people who owed him money and demand ransoms, sometimes tearing up ransom notes even when Escobar had received the ransom. It is speculated that businessman Diego Echavarria Misas was kidnapped and eventually killed in the summer of 1971 with the participation of Escobar, who supposedly received a $50,000 ransom from the Echavarria family.\n\n**Medellín Cartel**\n\nEscobar had been involved in organized crime for a decade when the cocaine trade began to spread in Colombia in the mid-1970s. Escobar's meteoric rise caught the attention of the Colombian Security Service (DAS), who arrested him in May 1976 on his return from drug trafficking in Ecuador. DAS agents found 39 kg of cocaine in the spare tire of Escobar's car. Escobar managed to change the first judge in the lawsuit and the process expired, apparently by bribed the second judge, so he was released along with other prisoners.\n\n**Rise to Prominence**\n\nThe demand for cocaine greatly increased in the United States, which led to Escobar organizing more smuggling shipments, routes, and distribution networks in South Florida, California, Puerto Rico, and other parts of the country. He and cartel co-founder Carlos Lehder worked together to develop a new trans-shipment point in the Bahamas, an island called Norman's Cay. Escobar and Robert Vesco purchased most of the land on the island, which included a 1-kilometre airstrip, a harbor, a hotel, houses, boats, and aircraft, and they built a refrigerated warehouse to store the cocaine.\n\n**Escobar's Political Career**\n\nAt the height of his power, Escobar was involved in philanthropy in Colombia and paid handsomely for the staff of his cocaine lab. Escobar spent millions developing some of Medellín's poorest neighborhoods. He built housing complexes, parks, football stadiums, hospitals, schools, and churches. His most famous charity work was the 'Medellín without slums' neighbourhood, aimed at people living in slums at the Medellín municipal dump. Shortly before the presidential and regional elections of 1982 began, Escobar realized that he had to create a \"cover\" to protect his lucrative drug trade. He began to cultivate an image of a respectable man, making contacts with politicians, financiers, lawyers, etc.\n\n**War Against Drugs and Narcoterrorism**\n\nColombia will hand over criminals requested by the Crime Commission in other countries; so that they are punished in an exemplary manner, in this universal operation against an attack that is also universal. The war between drug cartels was a major challenge for the Colombian government. The Medellín Cartel and the Cali Cartel both maintained a cordial relationship, but the origin of the war between the two cartels has varied origins. One version suggests disagreement with the violent methods used by Escobar, added to this, the Cali Cartel opposed a \"war quota\" against the government by refusing to pay for it. Another version suggests the Cali Cartel's zeal to take control of the drug market in Los Angeles and Miami since it currently monopolized drug trafficking in New York City.\n\n**Surrender and Submission to Justice**\n\nTurbay's death motivated the families of the other hostages to seek their release on their own. With only Francisco Santos, Beatriz Villamizar, and Maruja Pachón remaining kidnapped, Villamizar was released on February 6, 1991, thanks to the efforts of her husband, Congressman Luis Guerrero.

and at the beginning of high school, another of his qualities became evident: his leadership over his classmates Escobar and his cousin Gustavo Gaviria Rivero did small \"businesses\" at the Lucrecio Jaramillo Vélez high school, where they both studied They held raffles, exchanged comics, sold exams and lent money at low interest In this way, Pablo Escobar began to develop his \"ability\" for business and commerce.\n\n\nCriminal career\nEscobar started his criminal career with his gang by with small scams, thefts, and after stealing tombstones, sandblasting their inscriptions, and reselling them After dropping out of college, Escobar began to join gangs to steal cars [48] Escobar soon became involved in violent crime, employing criminals to kidnap people who owed him money and demand ransoms, sometimes tearing up ransom notes even when Escobar had received the ransom It is speculated that businessman Diego Echavarria Misas was kidnapped and eventually killed in the summer of 1971 with the participation of Escobar, who supposedly received a $50,000 ransom from the Echavarria family [49] [50] Escobar would repeat the same process with drug lord Fabio Restrepo, kidnapping and murdering him in 1975 [51] [52]\n\n\nEarly\nEscobar started his criminal career with his gang by with small scams, thefts, and after stealing tombstones, sandblasting their inscriptions, and reselling them After dropping out of college, Escobar began to join gangs to steal cars [48] Escobar soon became involved in violent crime, employing criminals to kidnap people who owed him money and demand ransoms, sometimes tearing up ransom notes even when Escobar had received the ransom It is speculated that businessman Diego Echavarria Misas was kidnapped and eventually killed in the summer of 1971 with the participation of Escobar, who supposedly received a $50,000 ransom from the Echavarria family [49] [50] Escobar would repeat the same process with drug lord Fabio Restrepo, kidnapping and murdering him in 1975 [51] [52]\n\n\nMedellín Cartel\nEscobar had been involved in organized crime for a decade when the cocaine trade began to spread in Colombia in the mid-1970s Escobar's meteoric rise caught the attention of the Colombian Security Service (DAS), who arrested him in May 1976 on his return from drug trafficking in Ecuador DAS agents found 39 kg of cocaine in the spare tire of Escobar's car Escobar managed to change the first judge in the lawsuit and the process expired, apparently by bribed the second judge, so he was released along with other prisoners Despite this, the case was reopened by Judge Mariela Espinosa, who also dropped the investigation due to threats against her life [54] The following year, the agents who arrested Escobar were assassinated Escobar continued to bribe and intimidate Colombian law enforcement agencies in the same fashion His carrot-and-stick strategy of bribing public officials and political candidates in Colombia, in addition to sending hitmen to murder the ones who rejected his bribes, came to be known as \"silver or lead\", meaning \"money or death\" [55] [46] [56] The Medellín Cartel and the Cali Cartel both managed to bribe Colombian politicians, and campaigned for both the Conservative and Liberal parties Although the difference between the two cartels was that the Medellín Cartel used its \"money or death\" law through a huge army of hitmen, the Cali Cartel preferred to use bribes by having politicians, journalists, police officers, army officers, judges, etc on its payroll [57] [58] Hence, Escobar and many other Colombian drug lords were pulling strings in every level of the Colombian government because many of the political candidates whom they backed financially were eventually elected [57] Although the Medellín Cartel was only established in the early 1970s, it expanded after Escobar met several drug lords on a farm in April 1978, and by the end of 1978 they had transported some 19,000 kilograms of cocaine to the United States [59]\n\n\nRise to prominence\nSoon, the demand for cocaine greatly increased in the United States, which led to Escobar organizing more smuggling shipments, routes, and distribution networks in South Florida, California, Puerto Rico, and other parts of the country He and cartel co-founder Carlos Lehder worked together to develop a new trans-shipment point in the Bahamas, an island called Norman's Cay about 350 km (220 mi) southeast of the Florida coast Escobar and Robert Vesco purchased most of the land on the island, which included a 1-kilometre (3,300 ft) airstrip, a harbor, a hotel, houses, boats, and aircraft, and they built a refrigerated warehouse to store the cocaine According to his brother, Escobar did not purchase Norman's Cay; it was instead a sole venture of Lehder's From 1978 to 1982, this was used as a central smuggling route for the Medellín Cartel With the enormous profits generated by this route, Escobar was soon able to purchase 20 square kilometres (7.7 sq mi) of land in Antioquia for several million dollars, on which he built the Hacienda Nápoles The luxury house he created contained a zoo, with more than two hundred species of exotic animals for the region, such as hippos, giraffes, elephants, zebras and ostriches, all introduced into the country as a result of bribes to the government entity INDERENA and the customs authorities; a lake, a sculpture garden; a private bullring; and other amenities for his family and the cartel Escobar made a show of this by producing a propaganda report about his Hacienda [61]\n\n\nEscobar's political career\nAt the height of his power, Escobar was involved in philanthropy in Colombia and paid handsomely for the staff of his cocaine lab Escobar spent millions developing some of Medellín's poorest neighborhoods He built housing complexes, parks, football stadiums, hospitals, schools, and churches [64] [65] His most famous charity work was the 'Medellín without slums' neighbourhood, aimed at people living in slums at the Medellín municipal dump [66] [67] Shortly before the presidential and regional elections of 1982 began, Escobar realized that he had to create a \"cover\" to protect his lucrative drug trade He began to cultivate an image of a respectable man, making contacts with politicians, financiers, lawyers, etc Considered until then a 'Robin Hood paisa' due to his help to the poor of Medellín, Escobar would enter politics with the help of Jairo Ortega Ramírez as a congressman representing Antioquia through the Liberal Renewal movement, [68] [69] although his godfather in politics was the liberal chieftain from Tolima Department Alberto Santofimio Botero This triumvirate initially supported the candidacy of Luis Carlos Galán, a dissident of the Liberal Party for his New Liberalism movement While campaigning politically in Medellín, Galán learned through his assistant Iván Marulanda that people whose fortunes were of dubious origin had joined the Liberal Renovation movement In Medellín's Berrío Park, Galán, without mentioning Escobar's name, publicly expelled him, rejecting the support of Escobar and others similar to him involved in shady business dealings [70] [71]\nDespite the opposition and warnings of his partners, in 1982, he successfully entered the Colombian Congress Although only an alternate, he was automatically granted parliamentary immunity and the right to a diplomatic passport under Colombian law At the same time, Escobar was gradually becoming a public figure, and because of his charitable work, he was known as \"Robin Hood Paisa\" He alleged once in an interview that his fortune came from a bicycle rental company he founded when he was 16 years old [72]\n\n\nWar against drugs and narcoterrorism\n Colombia will hand over criminals requested by the Crime Commission in other countries; so that they are punished in an exemplary manner, in this universal operation against an attack that is also universal.\n\nWar between drug cartels\nAlthough both cartels maintained a cordial relationship, the origin of the war between the Medellin and Cali cartels has varied origins One version suggests disagreement with the violent methods used by Escobar Added to this, the Cali Cartel opposed a \"war quota\" against the government by refusing to pay for it Another version suggests the Cali Cartel's zeal to take control of the drug market in Los Angeles and Miami since it currently monopolized drug trafficking in New York City, according to a DEA analysis [146] another version suggests that the Cali Cartel informed on Jorge Luis Ochoa, Escobar's partner, while Ochoa was in Buga, Valle del Cauca This has been denied since Ochoa and Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela had shared a cell in Spain where they were to be extradited to the United States, but both were repatriated to Colombia where they served ridiculous prison sentences [147] [148] [149] [150] [151] According to Jhon Jairo Velásquez 'Popeye', a hitman for the Medellín Cartel, the dispute between the two sides began due to disputes between employees of Pablo Escobar and Hélmer Herrera:\n\n\n1989 offensive and failed negotiations\nMinister of Justice Enrique Low Murtra signed the extradition orders for Escobar and his cartel associates [170] A few days later, the politician and candidate for mayor of Medellín, Juan Gómez Martínez, [171] [172] was saved from an attempted kidnapping claimed by Los Extraditables, while Jorge Luis Ochoa was released with impunity under the right of habeas corpus a month later.\n\n\nWave of kidnappings and failed negotiations\nOn December 15, 1989, Barco's government managed to kill the second leader of the Medellín cartel and its military leader, El Mexicano (Rodríguez Gacha) He was located by an informant working for the Cali Cartel on the northern coast of the country, where he was seeking refuge from the authorities' persecution Responsible for more than 2,000 homicides and claiming responsibility for the attack on the DAS tower, he was killed after a tough chase between the municipalities of Tolú and Coveñas in the Sucre Department, along with his son Freddy Rodríguez Celades, his main lieutenant Gilberto Rendón Hurtado and four hitmen from his security force Most of the terrorist attacks of the last few months were attributed to 'El Mexicano' [223] [224]\n\n\nNew kidnappings and attacks\nApart from an unfinished peace process, President César Gaviria inherited the \"war on drugs\" with which his predecessor had sought to reduce the Medellín Cartel and its network of hitmen, declared enemies of the State [252] Although during his presidential campaign he had shown total support for both the offensive and the measures taken by Barco, including the most feared by narco-terrorists; which was extradition by administrative means; once in office he hinted that the high economic and human cost of this war deserved the search for an alternative solution in which the strengthening of justice would be a key element On August 12, in any case, in a coup, men from the Elite Group of the police killed Gustavo Gaviria Rivero, Escobar's cousin and right-hand man [253] [254]\n\n\nSurrender and submission to justice\nTurbay's death motivated the families of the other hostages to seek their release on their own With only Francisco Santos, Beatriz Villamizar and Maruja Pachón remaining kidnapped, Villamizar was released on February 6, 1991, thanks to the efforts of her husband, Congressman Luis Guerrero At the same time, the Eudist priest Rafael García-Herreros who had been contacted by an emissary of Escobar, under his orders, saying that he was tired of his war and trusted him for an eventual surrender On his daily TV show 'El Minuto de Dios', García-Herreros had expressed Escobar's apparent interest in surrendering, but at the same time his doubts [284]\n\n\nLa Catedral prison\nBetween June 1991 and July 1992, Colombia experienced a period of relative peace, except for the government's war against the guerrillas, but such peace was superficial It is said that shortly before his surrender, Escobar had met with his remaining associates Gerardo Moncada and Federico 'Kiko' Galeano, the Castaño Gil brothers and other mid- and low-level gangsters Escobar, at that meeting, reaffirmed himself as the leader of the Medellin Cartel, and proclaimed himself the creator of the drug trafficking business, which is why he demanded that he be paid high sums of money for each shipment of drugs to the United States; going from being a drug lord to being an extortionist According to 'Popeye', the apparent surrender at La Catedral would be nothing more than a vacation due to the war that Escobar was waging against the government Escobar was confined in La Catedral with his older brother Roberto and several of his men; Otoniel González 'Otto', Carlos Aguilar 'Mugre' (The filth), John Jairo Velásquez 'Popeye', Valentín Taborda, Gustavo González 'Tavo', Jorge Eduardo Avendaño 'Tato' y Johnny Rivera 'El Palomo' (The pidgeon), José Fernando Ospina 'El Mago' (The Wizard), John Jairo Betancur 'Icopor' (Polystyrene), Carlos Díaz 'La Garra' (The Claw) y Alfonso León Puerta 'El Angelito' Except for a few who still had influence in Medellín; Mario Castaño 'Chopo', Brances Muñoz 'Tyson' and John Jairo Posada 'Titi'; as well as his partners Moncada and Galeano who were in charge of shipping the cocaine [307]\n\n\nEscape and final stage\nEscobar's escape represented the biggest mockery of the Gaviria government in the eyes of the public, and Colombian justice would end up being discredited internationally [353] The government reactivated the Elite Group, renaming it the Search Bloc, a body made up of the National Police and the National Army with the collaboration of the DEA to hunt down the fugitives and dismantle their criminal empire once and for all The leaders of the Cali Cartel were responsible for unleashing the war again, by activating a car bomb in Medellín that they attributed to their enemies from Antioquia, at the same time that they decided to finance Los Pepes [354] [355] [356]\n\n\nDeath\nThat they will never catch me in the great fucking life, and that from the jungle I will order them all to be killed and in the long run the ones who will lose will be them.\n\nAftermath of his death\nSoon after Escobar's death and the subsequent fragmentation of the Medellín Cartel, the cocaine market became dominated by the rival Cali Cartel until the mid-1990s when its leaders were either killed or captured by the Colombian government The Robin Hood image that Escobar had cultivated maintained a lasting influence in Medellín Many there, especially many of the city's poor whom Escobar had aided while he was alive, mourned his death, and over 25,000 people attended his funeral Some of them consider him a saint and pray to him for receiving divine help Escobar was buried at the Monte Sacro Cemetery [437]\n\n\nVirginia Vallejo's testimony\nOn 4 July 2006, Virginia Vallejo, a television anchorwoman romantically involved with Escobar from 1983 to 1987, offered Attorney General Mario Iguarán her testimony in the trial against former Senator Alberto Santofimio, who was accused of conspiracy in the 1989 assassination of presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galán Iguarán acknowledged that, although Vallejo had contacted his office on 4 July, the judge had decided to close the trial on 9 July, several weeks before the prospective closing date The action was seen as too late [438] [439]\n\n\nRole in the Palace of Justice siege\nAmong Escobar's biographers, only Vallejo has given a detailed explanation of his role in the 1985 Palace of Justice siege She stated that Escobar had financed the operation, which was committed by M-19; she blamed the army for the killings of more than 100 people, including 11 Supreme Court magistrates, M-19 members, and employees of the cafeteria Her statements prompted the reopening of the case in 2008; Vallejo was asked to testify, and many of the events she had described in her book and testimonial were confirmed by Colombia's Commission of Truth [444] [445] These events led to further investigation into the siege that resulted with the conviction of a high-ranking former colonel and a former general, later sentenced to 30 and 35 years in prison, respectively, for the forced disappearance of the detained after the siege [446] [447] Vallejo would subsequently testify in Galán's assassination [448] In her book, Amando a Pablo, odiando a Escobar (Loving Pablo, Hating Escobar), she had accused several politicians, including Colombian presidents Alfonso López Michelsen, Ernesto Samper, and Álvaro Uribe of having links to drug cartels [449]\n\n\nRelatives\nEscobar's widow (María Henao, now María Isabel Santos Caballero), son (Juan Pablo, now Sebastián Marroquín Santos) and daughter (Manuela) fled Colombia in 1995 after failing to find a country that would grant them asylum [453] Despite Escobar's numerous and continual infidelities, Maria remained supportive of her husband Members of the Cali Cartel even replayed their recordings of her conversations with Pablo for their wives to demonstrate how a woman should behave [454] This attitude proved to be the reason the cartel did not kill her and her children after Pablo's death, although the group demanded and received millions of dollars in reparations for Escobar's war against them Henao even successfully negotiated for her son's life by personally guaranteeing he would not seek revenge against the cartel or participate in the drug trade [455]\n\n\nHacienda Nápoles\nAfter Escobar's death, the ranch, zoo and citadel at Hacienda Nápoles were given by the government to low-income families under a law called Extinción de Dominio (Domain Extinction) The property has been converted into a theme park surrounded by four luxury hotels overlooking the zoo [476]\n\n\nEscobar Inc\nIn 2014, Roberto Escobar founded Escobar Inc with Olof K Gustafsson and registered Successor-In-Interest rights for his brother Pablo Escobar in California, United States [477]\n\n\nHippos\nEscobar kept four hippos in a private menagerie at Hacienda Nápoles They were deemed too difficult to seize and move after Escobar's death, and hence left on the untended estate By 2007, the animals had multiplied to 16 and had taken to roaming the area for food in the nearby Magdalena River [478] [479] In 2009, two adults and one calf escaped the herd and, after attacking humans and killing cattle, one of the adults (called \"Pepe\") was killed by hunters under authorization of the local authorities [479] As of early 2014, 40 hippos have been reported to exist in Puerto Triunfo, Antioquia Department, from the original four belonging to Escobar [480] As of 2016, without management, the population size is likely to more than double in the next decade [481]\n\n\nApartment demolition\nOn 22 February 2019, at 11:53 AM local time, Medellín authorities demolished the six-story Edificio Mónaco apartment complex in the El Poblado neighborhood where, according to retired Colombian general Rosso José Serrano, Escobar planned some of his most brazen attacks The building was initially built for Escobar's wife but was gutted by a Cali Cartel car bomb in 1988 and had remained unoccupied ever since, becoming an attraction to foreign tourists seeking out Escobar's physical legacy Mayor Federico Gutierrez had been pushing to raze the building and erect in its place a park honoring the thousands of cartel victims, including four presidential candidates and some 500 police officers Colombian President Ivan Duque said the demolition \"means that history is not going to be written in terms of the perpetrators, but by recognizing the victims\", hoping the demolition would showcase that the city had evolved significantly and had more to offer than the legacy left by the cartels [486]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn March 1976, the 26-year-old Escobar married María Victoria Henao Vallejo, who was 15 The relationship was discouraged by the Henao Vallejo family, who considered Escobar socially inferior; the pair eloped, despite being a close friend of Mario Henao Vallejo, who would become his brother-in-law [487] They had two children: Juan Pablo (now Sebastián Marroquín) and Manuela In 2007, the journalist Virginia Vallejo published her memoir Amando a Pablo, odiando a Escobar (Loving Pablo, Hating Escobar), in which she describes her romantic relationship with Escobar and the links of her lover with several presidents, Caribbean dictators, and high-profile politicians [488] Her book inspired the movie Loving Pablo (2017) [489] A drug distributor, Griselda Blanco, is also reported to have conducted a clandestine but passionate relationship with Escobar; several items in her diary link him with the nicknames \"Coque de Mi Rey\" (My Coke King) and \"Polla Blanca\" (White Cock) [490]\n\n\nFamily and relationships\nIn March 1976, the 26-year-old Escobar married María Victoria Henao Vallejo, who was 15 The relationship was discouraged by the Henao Vallejo family, who considered Escobar socially inferior;

Miller's influence can be seen in many aspects of internet culture, from music and comedy to fashion and art.\n\n**Discography**\n\n* **Studio albums**\n\t+ In Tongues (2017)\n\t+ Ballads 1 (2018)\n\t+ Nectar (2020)\n* **Tours**\n\t+ Joji World Tour (2019)\n\t+ Nectar World Tour (2020)\n\n**Awards and nominations**\n\n* **MTV Video Music Awards**\n\t+ Best Alternative Video for \"Slow Dancing in the Dark\" (2019)\n* **Billboard Music Awards**\n\t+ Top Alternative Song for \"Slow Dancing in the Dark\" (2019)\n* **Brit Awards**\n\t+ International Song of the Year for \"Slow Dancing in the Dark\" (2020)\n\n**See also**\n\n* Filthy Frank\n* Pink Guy\n* Internet culture\n* Trip-hop\n\n**References**\n\nNone\n\n**External links**\n\n* Official website\n* Instagram\n* Twitter\n* YouTube", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Joji_(musician)\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nGeorge Kusunoki Miller [1] was born in Osaka, Japan [3] to an Australian father and a Japanese mother [18] He attended Canadian Academy, an international school in Kobe, Japan, where he graduated in 2012 [5] At age 18, he left Japan and travelled to the United States [19]\n\n\nYouTube career\nOn 23 September, 2006, Miller would create his first YouTube channel called \"2cool4u92\" The channel's only video, which shared a name with the channel, was uploaded on 17 October 2006 In the video, which was recorded by someone who is presumably a schoolmate of his, a 13-year-old Miller breakdances in what is seemingly a school hallway This is the earliest known video of Miller on YouTube [20] On 16 June, 2008, Miller created the DizastaMusic channel, on which he generally uploaded sketch comedy-based videos The earliest known video on the channel was uploaded on 19 June 2008, titled \"Lil Jon falls off a table\" [21]\n\n\nMusic career\nMiller always had a passion for music composition He has expressed that even before his YouTube career, he had an interest in creating music and created his YouTube channel as a means of promoting it In an interview with Pigeons and Planes, he said, \"I've always wanted to make normal music I just started the YouTube channel to kind of bump my music But then Filthy Frank and the Pink Guy stuff ended up getting way bigger than I thought so I had to kind of roll with it.\" [15]\n\n\nPink Guy (2012–2017)\nMiller always had a passion for music composition He has expressed that even before his YouTube career, he had an interest in creating music and created his YouTube channel as a means of promoting it In an interview with Pigeons and Planes, he said, \"I've always wanted to make normal music I just started the YouTube channel to kind of bump my music But then Filthy Frank and the Pink Guy stuff ended up getting way bigger than I thought so I had to kind of roll with it.\" [15]\n\n\nJoji (2015–present)\nAside from the comedic and often rap-based music he created under the Pink Guy alias, Miller also created more serious and traditional music under another stage name, Joji, which became his primary focus in late 2017 Speaking on his transition from his YouTube career to his music career as Joji, Miller said to Billboard \"now I get to do stuff that I want to hear.\" [34] In the article by Billboard, he specified that 'Joji' isn't a character like Filthy Frank and Pink Guy \"I guess that's the difference,\" he continues \"Joji's just me.\" [35]\n\n\nArtistry\nJoji's music has been described as trip hop and lo-fi [7] that blends elements of trap, folk, electronic, and R&B [66] His songs have been characterised as having \"down tempo, melancholic themes and soulful vocals\" [3] with \"minimalistic production\" [67] Joji himself classifies his work as dark love songs, with his 2020 album, Nectar, dissecting cliché tropes and topics [68]\n\n\nImpact\nMiller's web-show has had a significant impact on internet culture and is responsible for creating many internet memes [70] Most prominently, a video from 2013 ended up starting the Harlem Shake meme, leading to Baauer's eponymous song debuting atop the Billboard Hot 100 [71]\n\n\nDiscography\nAs Joji\n\n\nStudio albums\nAs Joji\n\n\nTours\n\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is a relatively large aircraft, designed to undertake reconnaissance missions within a 1,000-kilometer radius, flying at transonic speeds. The Tu-141 was initially used by the Soviet military from 1979 to 1989, primarily along the western borders of the Soviet Union. In recent years, the Tu-141 has seen a resurgence in service, particularly in Ukraine, where it has been used in various conflicts.\n\n**Development**\n\nThe Tu-141 was designed as a follow-on to the Tupolev Tu-123, a reconnaissance drone that was used by the Soviet military in the 1960s and 1970s. The Tu-141 is a more advanced aircraft, with a larger payload capacity and improved sensors. It was designed to undertake reconnaissance missions in a variety of environments, including urban and rural areas, as well as in adverse weather conditions.\n\nThe Tu-141 is powered by a single turbojet engine, which provides a significant amount of thrust for its size. The aircraft has a wingspan of approximately 12 meters, and a length of around 10 meters. It has a maximum takeoff weight of around 4,000 kilograms, and a maximum speed of around 1,000 kilometers per hour.\n\nThe Tu-141 can carry a range of payloads, including film cameras, infrared imagers, electro-optical (EO) imagers, and imaging radar. These payloads are designed to provide high-resolution images and data, which can be used for a variety of military and intelligence purposes.\n\n**Operation and Incidents**\n\nThe Tu-141 was used by the Soviet military from 1979 to 1989, primarily along the western borders of the Soviet Union. The aircraft was used for reconnaissance missions, as well as for target practice by Soviet air defenses. During this time, the Tu-141 saw limited combat, but was not widely used in operational roles.\n\nIn the 1990s, the Tu-141 was largely retired from service, as the Soviet Union dissolved and Russia and Ukraine became independent countries. However, in recent years, the Tu-141 has seen a resurgence in service, particularly in Ukraine.\n\nIn 2014, Ukraine's Air Force pressed the Tu-141 back into service, using it for reconnaissance and surveillance missions in the Donbas region. The aircraft was used to gather intelligence on Russian-backed separatist forces, as well as to monitor their movements and activities.\n\nIn 2022, the Tu-141 was reported to have been used by Ukraine's Air Force during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. On March 8, 2022, a Tu-141 reconnaissance drone was reported to have been crashed in Ukraine, although the circumstances of the crash were not immediately clear.\n\n**Russo-Ukrainian War**\n\nThe Tu-141 has played a significant role in the conflict in Ukraine, particularly in the Donbas region. In 2014, Ukraine's Air Force began using the Tu-141 for reconnaissance and surveillance missions, gathering intelligence on Russian-backed separatist forces and monitoring their movements and activities.\n\nThe Tu-141 was used to support Ukrainian ground forces, providing them with critical intelligence and data that helped them to make informed decisions on the battlefield. The aircraft was also used to identify and track targets, allowing Ukrainian forces to launch precision strikes against enemy positions.\n\nThe use of the Tu-141 in the conflict in Ukraine has been widely reported, with the aircraft being seen as a key component of Ukraine's military strategy. However, the exact details of its operations and the extent to which it has been used are not publicly known.\n\n**2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine**\n\nOn March 8, 2022, a Tu-141 reconnaissance drone was reported to have been crashed in Ukraine, although the circumstances of the crash were not immediately clear. The incident occurred during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which began on February 24, 2022.\n\nThe use of the Tu-141 in the conflict in Ukraine highlights the importance of reconnaissance and surveillance assets in modern warfare. The aircraft's ability to gather critical intelligence and data has been widely recognized, and its use in the conflict has been seen as a key factor in Ukraine's military strategy.\n\n**Specifications**\n\nThe Tu-141 has a number of key specifications that make it a versatile and effective reconnaissance drone. These include:\n\n* **Length:** 10 meters\n* **Wingspan:** 12 meters\n* **Maximum takeoff weight:** 4,000 kilograms\n* **Maximum speed:** 1,000 kilometers per hour\n* **Payload capacity:** Up to 200 kilograms\n* **Range:** Up to 1,000 kilometers\n\nThe Tu-141 is powered by a single turbojet engine, which provides a significant amount of thrust for its size. The aircraft has a high-speed capability, allowing it to operate at transonic speeds and gather critical intelligence and data in a variety of environments.\n\n**Operators**\n\nThe Tu-141 has been operated by a number of countries, including:\n\n* **Soviet Union:** The Tu-141 was used by the Soviet military from 1979 to 1989, primarily along the western borders of the Soviet Union.\n* **Ukraine:** In 2014, Ukraine's Air Force pressed the Tu-141 back into service, using it for reconnaissance and surveillance missions in the Donbas region.\n* **Russia:** It is not clear whether Russia has operated the Tu-141 in recent years, although the aircraft has been seen in use by Russian-backed separatist forces in Ukraine.\n\n**Current and Former Operators**\n\nThe Tu-141 is currently in service with the Ukrainian Air Force, although its exact status and the extent to which it is being used are not publicly known. The aircraft has been pressed back into service in recent years, and has played a significant role in the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nIn the past, the Tu-141 was operated by the Soviet military, and was used for reconnaissance and surveillance missions along the western borders of the Soviet Union. The aircraft was also used for target practice by Soviet air defenses.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article contains material that originally came from the web article Unmanned Aerial Vehicles by Greg Goebel, which exists in the Public Domain.\n\n**External Links**\n\nThis article contains external links to the following websites:\n\n* **Unmanned Aerial Vehicles** by Greg Goebel\n* **Tupolev Tu-141** on Wikipedia", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tupolev_Tu-141\" following this outline:\n\n\nDevelopment\nThe Tu-141 was a follow-on to the Tupolev Tu-123 and is a relatively large, medium-range reconnaissance drone It is designed to undertake reconnaissance missions within a 1,000 kilometres (620 mi) radius, flying at transonic speeds It can carry a range of payloads, including film cameras, infrared imagers, EO imagers, and imaging radar [citation needed]    \n\n\nOperation and incidents\nThe Tu-141 was in Soviet service from 1979 to 1989, mostly on the western borders of the Soviet Union [citation needed]\n\n\nRusso-Ukrainian War\nIt was pressed back into service by the Ukrainian Air Force after 2014 for the war in Donbas [1] [2]\n\n\n2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\nOn 8 March 2022, a Tu-141 reconnaissance drone was reported crashed in Ukraine [5]\n\n\nSpecifications\nData from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Directory: Part 2 [22]\n\nOperators\nThis article contains material that originally came from the web article Unmanned Aerial Vehicles by Greg Goebel, which exists in the Public Domain.\n\n\nCurrent\nThis article contains material that originally came from the web article Unmanned Aerial Vehicles by Greg Goebel, which exists in the Public Domain.\n\n\nFormer\nThis article contains material that originally came from the web article Unmanned Aerial Vehicles by Greg Goebel, which exists in the Public Domain.\n\n\nReferences\nThis article contains material that originally came from the web article Unmanned Aerial Vehicles by Greg Goebel, which exists in the Public Domain.\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Mel_Brooks", "content": "\nEarly life and education\nBrooks was born on a tenement kitchen table [4] on June 28, 1926, in Brownsville, Brooklyn, [4] to Kate (née Brookman) and Max Kaminsky, [5] and grew up in Williamsburg His father's family were German Jews from Danzig (Gdańsk, Poland); his mother was from Kyiv, in the Pale of Settlement of the Russian Empire (present-day Ukraine) [6] [7] [8] [9] He had three older brothers: Irving, Lenny, and Bernie [10] [11] His father died of tuberculosis of the kidney [6] at 34 when Brooks was two years old [12] He has said of his father's death, \"There's an outrage there I may be angry at God, or at the world, for that And I'm sure a lot of my comedy is based on anger and hostility Growing up in Williamsburg, I learned to clothe it in comedy to spare myself problems—like a punch in the face.\" [10] [11]\n\n\n1944–1946: World War II service\nIn early 1944, in his senior year in high school, Brooks was recruited to take the Army General Classification Test, a Stanford-Binet-type IQ test [23]\nHe made high scores and was sent to the Army Specialized Training Program at the Virginia Military Institute to be taught electrical engineering, horse riding, and saber fighting [23] [24] [25] In 1944, Brooks was drafted into the Army [24] Twelve weeks later, when he turned 18, he officially joined the United States Army [17] at the Fort Dix, [23] New Jersey, induction center, and was sent to the Field Artillery Replacement Training Center at Fort Sill, Oklahoma for basic training and radio operator training [23] [26] [27] [25] Brooks was then sent back to Fort Dix for overseas assignment [23] Brooks says he boarded SS Sea Owl at the Brooklyn Navy Yard around February 15, 1945 [23] A reporter for the United States Department of Defense writes that Brooks arrived in France in November 1944, and later in Belgium, serving with the 78th Infantry Division as a forward artillery observer [24] In December 1944, a short while later, Brooks was transferred to the 1104th Engineer Combat Battalion as a combat engineer, participating in the Battle of the Bulge [25] [24] [28] [29] Of his experience there, Brooks noted:\n\n\nCareer\nAfter the war, Brooks's mother had secured him a job as a clerk at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, but Brooks \"got into a taxi and ordered the driver to take him to the Catskills\", [37] where he started working in various Borscht Belt resorts and nightclubs in the Catskill Mountains as a drummer and pianist When a regular comic at one of the clubs was too sick to perform, Brooks started working as a stand-up comic, telling jokes and doing movie-star impressions He also began acting in summer stock in Red Bank, New Jersey, and did some radio work [17] He eventually worked his way up to the comically aggressive job of tummler at Grossinger's, one of the Borscht Belt's most famous resorts [17] [38]\n\n\n1949–1959: Early work and breakthrough\nAfter the war, Brooks's mother had secured him a job as a clerk at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, but Brooks \"got into a taxi and ordered the driver to take him to the Catskills\", [37] where he started working in various Borscht Belt resorts and nightclubs in the Catskill Mountains as a drummer and pianist When a regular comic at one of the clubs was too sick to perform, Brooks started working as a stand-up comic, telling jokes and doing movie-star impressions He also began acting in summer stock in Red Bank, New Jersey, and did some radio work [17] He eventually worked his way up to the comically aggressive job of tummler at Grossinger's, one of the Borscht Belt's most famous resorts [17] [38]\n\n\n1958–1969: Rise to prominence\nBrooks and co-writer Reiner had become close friends and began to casually improvise comedy routines when they were not working In October 1959, for a Random House book launch of Moss Hart's autobiography, Act One, at Mamma Leone's, Mel Tolkin (standing in for Carl Reiner) and Mel Brooks performed, and it was later recalled by Kenneth Tynan [51] Reiner played the straight-man interviewer and set Brooks up as anything from a Tibetan monk to an astronaut As Reiner explained: \"In the evening, we'd go to a party and I'd pick a character for him to play I never told him what it was going to be.\" [17] On one of these occasions, Reiner's suggestion concerned a 2000-year-old man who had witnessed the crucifixion of Jesus Christ (who \"came in the store but never bought anything\"), had been married several hundred times and had \"over forty-two thousand children, and not one comes to visit me\" At first Brooks and Reiner only performed the routine for friends but, by the late 1950s, it gained a reputation in New York City Kenneth Tynan saw the comedy duo perform at a party in 1959 and wrote that Brooks \"was the most original comic improvisor I had ever seen\" [17]\n\n\n1970–1979: Career stardom\nWith the moderate financial success of the film The Producers, Glazier financed Brooks's next film, The Twelve Chairs (1970) Loosely based on Ilf and Petrov's 1928 Russian novel of the same name about greedy materialism in post-revolutionary Russia, it stars Ron Moody, Frank Langella and Dom DeLuise as three men individually searching for a fortune in diamonds hidden in a set of 12 antique chairs Brooks makes a cameo appearance as an alcoholic ex-serf who \"yearns for the regular beatings of yesteryear\" The film was shot in Yugoslavia with a budget of $1.5 million It received poor reviews and was not financially successful [17]\n\n\n1980–2001:

He is one of the most successful comedy directors of all time, known for his work in film, television, and theater. Brooks has won numerous awards, including an Academy Award, an Emmy Award, a Tony Award, and a Grammy Award.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nMel Brooks was born on June 28, 1926, in Brownsville, Brooklyn, to Kate (née Brookman) and Max Kaminsky. His father's family were German Jews from Danzig (present-day Gdańsk, Poland), and his mother was from Kyiv, in the Pale of Settlement of the Russian Empire (present-day Ukraine). Brooks grew up in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and had three older brothers: Irving, Lenny, and Bernie. His father died of tuberculosis of the kidney at the age of 34 when Brooks was two years old. Brooks has said that his father's death had a profound impact on his life and comedy.\n\nBrooks's early life was marked by a strong sense of humor, which he developed as a way to cope with the difficulties of growing up in a poor family. He has said that he learned to \"clothe\" his anger and hostility in comedy to spare himself problems, such as physical altercations. Brooks's mother encouraged his love of comedy and supported his early career in the entertainment industry.\n\n**1944-1946: World War II Service**\n\nIn 1944, Brooks was drafted into the Army and served in the United States Army Specialized Training Program at the Virginia Military Institute. He was trained in electrical engineering, horse riding, and saber fighting. Brooks was then sent to the Field Artillery Replacement Training Center at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, for basic training and radio operator training. After completing his training, Brooks was sent back to Fort Dix for overseas assignment.\n\nBrooks served in the 78th Infantry Division as a forward artillery observer and later in the 1104th Engineer Combat Battalion as a combat engineer. He participated in the Battle of the Bulge, a pivotal battle in World War II.

When a regular comic at one of the clubs was too sick to perform, Brooks started working as a stand-up comic, telling jokes and doing movie-star impressions. He also began acting in summer stock in Red Bank, New Jersey, and did some radio work.\n\nBrooks eventually worked his way up to the comically aggressive job of tummler at Grossinger's, one of the Borscht Belt's most famous resorts. As a tummler, Brooks was responsible for entertaining the guests, and he developed his skills as a comedian and performer.\n\n**1949-1959: Early Work and Breakthrough**\n\nBrooks's early work in the entertainment industry was marked by his success as a comedian and performer.

In October 1959, for a Random House book launch of Moss Hart's autobiography, Act One, at Mamma Leone's, Brooks and Reiner performed, and it was later recalled by Kenneth Tynan.\n\nReiner played the straight-man interviewer, and Brooks was set up as anything from a Tibetan monk to an astronaut. Brooks's routine was a hit, and he began to gain recognition as a talented comedian and performer.\n\n**1970-1979: Career Stardom**\n\nWith the moderate financial success of the film \"The Producers,\" Brooks's career took off. He was approached by the producers of the film to create a new project, and he chose to adapt his film \"The Twelve Chairs\" for the screen.\n\n\"The Twelve Chairs\" was a loosely based on Ilf and Petrov's 1928 Russian novel of the same name about greedy materialism in post-revolutionary Russia. The film starred Ron Moody, Frank Langella, and Dom DeLuise as three men individually searching for a fortune in diamonds hidden in a set of 12 antique chairs.\n\nBrooks made a cameo appearance as an alcoholic ex-serf who \"yearns for the regular beatings of yesteryear.\" The film was shot in Yugoslavia with a budget of $1.5 million and received poor reviews and was not financially successful.\n\n**1980-2001: Established Career**\n\nBy 1980, Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert had referred to Mel Brooks and Woody Allen as \"the two most successful comedy directors in the world today...

an astronaut As Reiner explained: \"In the evening, we'd go to a party and I'd pick a character for him to play I never told him what it was going to be.\" [17] On one of these occasions, Reiner's suggestion concerned a 2000-year-old man who had witnessed the crucifixion of Jesus Christ (who \"came in the store but never bought anything\"), had been married several hundred times and had \"over forty-two thousand children, and not one comes to visit me\" At first Brooks and Reiner only performed the routine for friends but, by the late 1950s, it gained a reputation in New York City Kenneth

Television's Netflix series, [41] and Tom Hardy reprises his roles as Eddie Brock / Venom from Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU) in an uncredited cameo appearance in the mid-credits scene

film would take place during a different year of high school for Peter Parker / Spider-Man, with the third being set during the character's senior year [54] Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige noted in July 2019 that the third film would feature \"a Peter Parker story that has never been done before on film\" due to the ending of the second film, Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019), which publicly

featuring Kraven the Hunter as the film's main antagonist, [31] an idea that Watts had expressed interest in and pitched to Holland, [66] [67] but was abandoned because Sony wanted to first feature the character in a solo film before any other projects [68] The plot subsequently gravitated towards a story idea similar to It's a Wonderful Life (1946) in which Parker makes a wish regarding his now public identity That idea introduced Dr Stephen Strange to the story, and the duo began exploring the idea of the multiverse and potentially revisiting characters from past Spider-Man films Initially they thought this would just be a tease for fans, but they ultimately decided to fully integrate the past characters into the plot Sommers said, \"Once it was collectively decided that we were going to take this swing, we had to commit and we had to do what was right for the story.\" They optimistically wrote for all the characters they wanted in the film before those actors were confirmed to be returning [31] Initial drafts of the film included every major character from past Spider-Man films returning, but this was narrowed down because the pair felt they had \"bit [ten] off more than  [they] could chew\" The duo worked hard to prevent the film from just being \"a bunch of fan service\" by using the returning characters to help tell Peter Parker's story instead of just creating \"curtain calls for everybody\" [16] Norman Osborn / Green Goblin from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy was not the main villain of the film in the first version of the script, despite still appearing as an antagonist; after the film lost \"other characters\", McKenna and Sommers concluded that the Green Goblin \"had to be\" the main villain and rewrote the script to give him a second chance to replicate his actions in Spider-Man (2002), but in a darker way related to Holland's version of Spider-Man [69] America Chavez had been considered to appear in the film at one point to serve in the sorcerer's apprentice-type role that eventually became part of Ned Leeds's role in the film; she would go on to appear in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022) [70]\n\n\nFilming\nSecond unit filming occurred from October 14 to 16, 2020, in New York City, [79] [80] [81] under the working title Serenity Now, [82] [80] to capture visual effects plates and establishing shots [79] Filming occurred in the Astoria, Sunnyside, and Long Island City neighborhoods in Queens [83] [81] On October 23, filming occurred in Greenwich Village in Manhattan [84]\n\n\nPost-production\nIn April 2021, Molina confirmed that he was appearing in the film, explaining that he had been told not to talk about his role in the film during production but he realized that his appearance had been widely rumored and reported on [26] Later that month, J B Smoove revealed that he was returning as Julius Dell from Far From Home, [46] while Cox stated that he was not involved with the film [118] In early May, Garfield denied that he had been asked to appear in the film, but later said \"never say never\", [119] [120] while Angourie Rice was revealed to be returning as Betty Brant in the film, reprising her role from previous MCU media [43] Later that month, Stone denied her involvement in the film [121]\n\n\nMusic\nIn November 2020, Homecoming and Far From Home composer Michael Giacchino was confirmed to be returning for No Way Home [148] [149] The film's score album was released digitally on December 17, 2021, with a track titled \"Arachnoverture\" released as a single on December 9 and another titled \"Exit Through the Lobby\" released the following day [150] Giacchino references themes from previous Spider-Man films by Hans Zimmer, James Horner, Christopher Young, [151] and Danny Elfman, as well as his own themes from Doctor Strange (2016) [152] Regarding the use of these other themes, Giacchino did not want their use to be fan service and finding ways to include them in a \"very targeted\" way He and Watts were \"very much in alignment in terms of when to use them and when not to use them for their maximum effect\" [153]\n\n\nMarketing\nIn May 2020, Sony entered a promotional partnership with Hyundai Motor Group to showcase their new models and technologies in the film; [154] Hyundai later released a commercial, titled \"Only Way Home\", that was directed by Watts to promote the film and the Ioniq 5 electric-powered SUV (which appears in the film along with the Hyundai Tucson), with Holland and Batalon starring [155] In late February 2021, Holland, Batalon, and Zendaya released three stills featuring their characters from the film alongside fake logos with the titles Spider-Man: Phone Home, Spider-Man: Home-Wrecker, and Spider-Man: Home Slice, respectively [156] The film's official title was announced the next day with a video showing Holland, Batalon, and Zendaya leaving Watts's office (where they supposedly received the fake titles) Batalon and Zendaya note that Holland could not be trusted with the actual title since he had \"accidentally\" revealed the second film's title The video ends on a whiteboard showing the film's true title, among various other titles featuring the word \"home\" that were apparently considered [114] Jennifer Bisset of CNET suggested the fake titles and logos could represent the villains in the film, including Foxx's Electro and Molina's Doctor Octopus, [156] while TheWrap's Umberto Gonzalez called them funny \"bait-and-switch fakes\", and noted the Phone Home title referenced a line from E.T the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) [157] Gregory Lawrence of Collider felt the Home-Wrecker title could point to the film feeling like a 1990s thriller film, and said the fake titles were a \"solid goof\" to excite fans He also compared the stills to the \"terrifying/awe-inspiring wonder\" of Steven Spielberg films and The Goonies (1985), [158] while Germain Lussier from io9 said they gave off \"subtle National Treasure, Indiana Jones vibes\" [159] In July 2021, Marvel revealed various toys and figurines for the film, including Funko Pops, Marvel Legends figures, and Lego sets

5 electric-powered SUV (which appears in the film along with the Hyundai Tucson), with Holland and Batalon starring [155] In late February 2021, Holland, Batalon, and Zendaya released three stills featuring their characters from the film alongside fake logos with the titles Spider-Man: Phone Home, Spider-Man: Home-Wrecker, and Spider-Man: Home Slice, respectively [156] The film's official title was announced the next day with a video showing Holland, Batalon, and Zendaya leaving Watts's office (where they supposedly received the fake titles) Batalon and Zendaya note that Holland could not be trusted with the actual title since he had \"accidentally\" revealed the second film's title The video ends on a whiteboard showing the film's true title, among various other titles featuring the word \"home\" that were apparently considered [114] Jennifer Bisset of CNET suggested the fake titles and logos could represent the villains in the film, including Foxx's Electro and Molina's Doctor Octopus, [156] while TheWrap's Umberto Gonzalez called them funny \"bait-and-switch fakes\", and noted the Phone Home title referenced a line from E.T the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) [157] Gregory Lawrence of Collider felt the Home-Wrecker title could point to the film feeling like a 1990s thriller film, and said the fake titles were a \"solid goof\" to excite fans He also compared the stills to the \"terrifying/awe-inspiring wonder\" of Steven Spielberg films and The Goonies (1985), [158] while Germain Lussier from io9 said they gave off \"subtle National Treasure, Indiana Jones vibes\" [159] In July 2021, Marvel revealed various toys and figurines for the film, including Funko Pops, Marvel Legends figures, and Lego sets [160]\n\n\nRelease\nSpider-Man: No Way Home had its world

[269]\n\n\nFuture\nBy August 2019, a fourth film in the franchise was in development alongside No Way Home [56] In February 2021, Holland said No Way Home was the final film under his contract but he hoped to continue playing Spider-Man in the future if asked [270] That October, Holland said No Way Home was being treated as \"the end of a franchise\" that began with Homecoming, with any additional solo films featuring the MCU Spider-Man characters to be different from the first trilogy of films and feature a tonal change [27] A month later, Holland said he was unsure if he should continue making Spider-Man films and felt he would have \"done something wrong\" if he was still portraying the character in his thirties He expressed interest in a film focusing on the Miles Morales version of Spider-Man instead Despite this, Pascal hoped to continue working with Holland on future Spider-Man films [73] Later in November, Pascal said there were plans for another trilogy of Spider-Man films starring Holland, with work on the first of those about to begin, [138] though Sony did not yet have official plans for further MCU Spider-Man films

{"title": "Tokugawa_Ieyasu", "content": "\nEarly life (1543–1562)\nTokugawa Ieyasu was born in Okazaki Castle on the 26th day of the twelfth month of the eleventh year of Tenbun, according to the Japanese calendar, January 31, 1543 according to the Western calendar Originally named Matsudaira Takechiyo (松平 竹千代), he was the son of Matsudaira Hirotada (松平 広忠), the daimyo of Mikawa of the Matsudaira clan, and Odai no Kata (於大の方, Lady Odai), the daughter of a neighbouring samurai lord, Mizuno Tadamasa (水野 忠政) His mother and father were step-siblings They were 17 and 15 years old, respectively, when Takechiyo was born [5]\n\n\nHostage life\nAs Oda Nobuhide continued to attack Okazaki, Hirotada turned to his powerful eastern neighbor, Imagawa Yoshimoto for assistance Yoshimoto agreed to an alliance under the condition that Hirotada send his young heir to Sunpu Domain as a hostage [6] Oda Nobuhide learned of this arrangement and had Takechiyo abducted [7] Takechiyo was five years old at the time [8] Nobuhide threatened to execute Takechiyo unless his father severed all ties with the Imagawa clan However, Hirotada refused, stating that sacrificing his own son would show his seriousness in his pact with the Imagawa Despite this refusal, Nobuhide chose not to kill Takechiyo, but instead held him hostage for the next three years at the Honshōji Temple in Nagoya It was said [by whom?] that Oda Nobunaga met Takechiyo at the temple, when Takechiyo was 6 years old, and Nobunaga was 14 However, Katsuhiro Taniguchi reported there is no concrete historical records about this story of first meeting between Ieyasu with Nobunaga [9]\n\n\nService under Imagawa clan\nIn 1556, Takechiyo officially came of age, with Imagawa Yoshimoto presiding over his genpuku ceremony Following tradition, he changed his name from Matsudaira Takechiyo to Matsudaira Jirōsaburō Motonobu (松平 次郎三郎 元信) He was also briefly allowed to visit Okazaki to pay his respects to the tomb of his father, and receive the homage of his nominal retainers, led by the karō Torii Tadayoshi [6]\n\n\nIeyasu-Nobunaga Alliance (1562–1582)\nSometime in the aftermath of the Okehazama battle where Imagawa Yoshimoto was slain, Ieyasu formed the Kiyosu Alliance  [jp] with Oda Nobunaga, daimyo lord of Owari Province and the head of Oda clan [22] [23] [e]\n\n\nUnification of Mikawa\nDuring this period, the Matsudaira clan faced a threat from the Ikkō-ikki movement, where peasants banded together with militant monks under the Jōdo Shinshū sect, and rejected the traditional feudal social order Ieyasu undertook several battles to suppress this movement in his territories, including the Battle of Azukizaka (1564) Some of Ieyasu's vassals were in the Ikkō-ikki ranks, like Honda Masanobu and Natsume Yoshinobu, who had deserted him for the Ikkō-ikki rebellion out of religious sympathy [21] However, many of Ieyasu's core vassals who were also followers of the sect such as Ishikawa Ienari [30] and Honda Tadakatsu quickly abandoned the Ikkō faith of Jōdo Shinshū and stayed loyal to Ieyasu to strike the rebels [31] [32] On January 15, 1564, Ieyasu decided to concentrate his forces to attack and eliminate the Ikkō-ikki from Mikawa In the Battle of Azukizaka, Ieyasu was fighting on the front lines and was nearly killed when he was struck by several bullets however they did not penetrate his armor [31] Both sides were using new gunpowder weapons which the Portuguese had introduced to Japan just 20 years earlier At the end of battle, the Ikkō-ikki were defeated By 1565, Ieyasu had become the master of all of Mikawa Province [citation needed]\n\n\nTokugawa clan\nIn 1567, Ieyasu started the family name \"Tokugawa\", finally changing his name to the well-known Tokugawa Ieyasu As he was a member of the Matsudaira clan, he claimed descent from the Seiwa Genji branch of the Minamoto clan However, as there was no proof that the Matsudaira clan were descendants of Emperor Seiwa, [37] the Emperor initially did not approve the appointment, citing the lack of a precedent for the Serada clan of the Seiwa Genji clan to be appointed as Mikawa no Kami [38] Ieyasu then consulted with imperial noble Konoe Motohisa through the mediation of a Mikawa native and the abbot of the Kyo Seiganji Temple [39] Due to Motohisa's efforts, Yoshida Kaneyoshi discovered a genealogical document in the Manri-koji family that was precedent, saying, \"Tokugawa (belongs) to Minamoto clan, as another offshoot of the Fujiwara clan,\" and a copy was transferred to him and used for the application [38] Then after passing several steps, Ieyasu gained the permission of the Imperial Court and he was bestowed the courtesy title Mikawa-no-kami (Lord of Mikawa) and the court rank of Junior 5th Rank, Lower Grade (從五位下, ju go-i no ge) Though the Tokugawa clan could claim some modicum of freedom, they were very much subject to the requests of Oda Nobunaga Ieyasu remained an ally of Nobunaga and his Mikawa soldiers were part of Nobunaga's army which captured Kyoto in 1568.\n\n\nTōtōmi campaign\nIn 1568, Ieyasu besieged the Horikawa Castle in Tōtōmi [42] However, the castle wasn't captured until 1569 After it was captured, Ieyasu ordered Ishikawa Hanzaburo to massacre the castle prisoners and castle residents, including women and children It was recorded that around 700 people were beheaded on the banks of the Miyakoda River [43] Ōkubo Tadachika, who witnessed this massacre testified in his personal journal, Mikawa Monogatari, that \".. both mens and womens can be cut into pieces  [sic]...\" [44]\n\n\nCampaign against Asakura-Azai clan\nAsakura Yoshikage, the head of the Asakura clan and regent of Ashikaga Yoshiaki, refused to come to Kyōto This caused Nobunaga to declare both of them rebels [49] Several reports from Mikawa Monogatari, Nobunaga Koki, Tokugawa Jikki, and a supplement from Ietada Nikki recorded that Ieyasu and his forces also participated in Oda's punitive campaign against Asakura where they fought and captured the Mount Tenzutsu castle The Oda-Tokugawa forces managed to kill 1,370 enemies on April 25 They continued the next day where they besieged the Kanegasaki castle [50] However, the Azai clan sent reinforcements to relieve the siege and Nobunaga retreated without contacting Ieyasu After dawn, Ieyasu was guided by Kinoshita Tokichi (later named Toyotomi Hideyoshi), an Oda vassal, to withdraw from the battle [51]\n\n\nSuruga campaign against Takeda clan\nIn October 1571, Takeda Shingen broke the alliance with the Oda-Tokugawa forces and allied with the Odawara Hōjō clan He decided to make a drive for Kyoto at the urging of the shōgun Ashikaga Yoshiaki, starting with invading Tokugawa lands in Tōtōmi Takeda Shingen's first objectives in his campaign against Ieyasu were Nishikawa Castle, Yoshida Castle and Futamata Castle In 1572, after besieging Futamata, Shingen would press on past Futamata towards the major Tokugawa home castle at Hamamatsu Ieyasu asked for help from Nobunaga, who sent him some 3,000 troops Early in 1573 the two armies met at the Battle of Mikatagahara, north Hamamatsu The considerably larger Takeda army, under the expert direction of Shingen, overwhelmed Ieyasu's troops and caused heavy casualties Despite his initial reluctance, Ieyasu was convinced by his generals to retreat [54] [47] The battle was a major defeat, but in the interest of maintaining the appearance of a dignified withdrawal, Ieyasu brazenly ordered the men in his castle to light torches, sound drums, and leave the gates open, to properly receive the returning warriors To the surprise and relief of the Tokugawa army, this spectacle made the Takeda generals suspicious that they were being led into a trap, so they did not besiege the castle and instead made camp for the night [54] This error allowed a band of Tokugawa soldiers to raid the camp in the ensuing hours, further upsetting the already disoriented Takeda army, and ultimately resulting in Shingen's decision to call off the offensive altogether Takeda Shingen would not get another chance to advance on Hamamatsu, much less Kyoto, since he died from unknown causes shortly after the siege of Noda Castle later that same year [19]: 153–156 \n\n\nNobuyasu Incident\nIn 1579, Lady Tsukiyama, Ieyasu's wife, and his heir Nobuyasu were accused by Nobunaga of conspiring with Takeda Katsuyori to assassinate Nobunaga, whose daughter Tokuhime was married to Nobuyasu Ieyasu ordered his wife to be executed and forced his son to commit seppuku because of these accusations [63] [64]\n\n\nTakeda clan annihilation\nIn 1580, Ieyasu built five fortresses in order to isolate Takatenjin Castle from external supplies and reinforcements [66] [67] [68] In addition to those 5 new fortresses, Ieyasu renovated an old castle named Ogasayama fort, which had originally been built by Ieyasu far before the conquest of Tōtōmi Province against Imagawa clan to capture Kakegawa Castle [68] With the six fortresses, which were referred to as the \"six fortresses of Takatenjin\", completed, Ieyasu assigned Ishikawa Yasumichi to the Ogasayama fort, Honda Yasushige to the Nogasaka fort, Osuga Yasutaka to the Higamine, [66] Shishigahana, [69] and Nakamura forts, [66] while Sakai Ietada was appointed to garrison the Mitsuiyama fort [67] [66] The Takatenjin castle which was defended by Okabe Motonobu, immediately suffered from a period of starvation as they were deprived of any resources or supplies to sustain the population inside the castle, while the siege outside the castle by Oda-Tokugawa forces intensified [66] In response, Motonobu tried to negotiate a truce with Ieyasu by offering Takisakai Castle and Koyama Castle in exchange for Takatenjin castle being spared from the siege [70] However, after Ieyasu consulted with Nobunaga on this matter he refused Motonobu's plea Nobunaga stated his reason in a letter saying that if Takeda Katsuyori sent his forces to assist Motonobu, then there would be an opportunity to bait the Takeda army out and annihilate them on the field Meanwhile, Nobunaga also stated that if Katsuyori neglected helping Motonobu at all, it would damage the Takeda clan's credibility because they could not save their own vassals [71]\n\n\nTokugawa expansions (1582–1584)\nIn late June 1582, before the incident at Honnō-ji temple, Oda Nobunaga invited Ieyasu to tour the Kansai region in celebration of the demise of the Takeda clan When he learned that Nobunaga had been killed at the Honnō-ji temple by Akechi Mitsuhide\n\n\n\"Shinkun Iga-goe\" journey\nTokugawa Ieyasu heard the news that Nobunaga had been killed at the Honnō-ji temple by Akechi Mitsuhide while in Hirakata, Osaka, but at the time, he had only few companions with him, [79] notably Sakai Tadatsugu, Ii Naomasa, and Honda Tadakatsu, Sakakibara Yasumasa and some others [40]: 314–315  [80] [81] The Iga provincial route was dangerous because of the Ochimusha-gari, or \"Samurai hunters\" gangs [h] Ieyasu and his party, therefore, chose the shortest route back to the Mikawa Province by crossing the Iga Province, but the exact route differs in many versions according to primary sources such as the records of Tokugawa Nikki or Mikawa Todai-Hon:\n\n\nTenshō-Jingo war\nAfter Ieyasu reached Mikawa, he immediately moved to shift his focus on the large former Takeda clan territory as he expected unrest there So as a preemptive measure, Ieyasu dispatched Honda Nobutoshi to contact Kawajiri Hidetaka, who ruled Suwa District as a vassal of the Oda clan, to request cooperation [92]\n\n\nPreliminary movements\nAt first the Hōjō clan who ruled Kantō region led an army of 55,000 men to invade the Shinano Province through Usui, [94] as they aimed to prevent a Tokugawa incursion of Kai [101] By June 13, the Hōjō clan had captured Iwadono Castle in Tsuru District, and instructed Watanabe Shozaemon, a local magistrate from the Tsuru District to assist them in their conquest [102] Subsequently, Sanada Masayuki led his army and captured the Numata Castle for the Uesugi clan [103] On June 14 however, Kawajiri Hidetaka killed Honda Nobutoshi This was followed by an uprising from many  of the clans in the Kai province against Hidetaka the following day, which resulted in Hidetaka being killed on June 18 [104] The Hōjō also gained support from a former Takeda vassal in the form of the Hoshina clan which was led by Hoshina Masatoshi and his sons Hoshina Masanao and Naitō Masaaki [105] By the end of June, they had secured all of the territory except for the areas controlled by the Sanada in Numata and Agatsuma [106]\n\n\nConflict chronology\nIeyasu deployed his forces to various fortresses in the Kōfu Basin to oppose Ujinao, who had camped his army in the area of present-day Hokuto City Hattori Hanzō led Iga clan warriors to Katsuyama Castle (Kamisone-cho, Kofu City), Minakuchi Castle, and Kotohirayama Castle (Misakuchi-cho, Kofu City), where he monitored the Nakamichi road connecting Kai and Suruga [119] Ieyasu managed to recruit more samurai clans who had formerly served under various Takeda generals such as Ichijō Nobutatsu, Yamagata Masakage, and Hara Masatane with the assistance of Ii Naomasa Naomasa dealt with around 41 letters of submission to the Tokugawa clan [120] [121] Furthermore, Naomasa also received another letter of submission from Obata Nobusada, the leader of the Takeda clan red armored cavalry troops [m]\n\n\nAftermath of Tenshō-Jingo war\nThe problems for the Hōjō clan increased by the day as Ieyasu established contact with daimyo lords from north-east Japan such as the Satake, Yuki, and Utsunomiya clans, who threatened to invade the Hōjō from behind while the Hōjō were still engaging Ieyasu in battle [101] As the war turned in favor of Ieyasu, combined with the defection of Sanada Masayuki to the Tokugawa side, the Hōjō negotiated a truce with Ieyasu [146]\n\n\nIeyasu and Hideyoshi (1584–1598)\nAs the Tokugawa clan's territory expanded, many of their regions were hit by earthquakes and heavy rains from 1583 to 1584 In particular, from May to July, heavy rains fell constantly from the Kantō region to the Tōkai region, in what was dubbed the \"heaviest flood in 50 years\" in the historical record of Ietada-nikki [172] It was under these circumstances that the Tokugawa clan was forced to fight against the Hōjō clan and the Toyotomi government, because in 1584 Ieyasu had decided to support Oda Nobukatsu, the eldest surviving son and heir of Oda Nobunaga, against Toyotomi Hideyoshi The Ryumonji Kojiki, written by successive chief priests at Ryumonji Temple in Tahara, Mikawa Province, records that in 1582, many people were mobilized in the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute, which led to the devastation of farmland and famine The devastation of the Tokugawa clan's territory made it difficult to continue fighting against the Toyotomi government, and they were forced to rebuild their country [173] This was a dangerous situation for the Tokugawa clan which could have resulted in their annihilation due to the Oda clan collapsing after Nobunaga's death [174]\n\n\nEarthquakes and conflict with Hideyoshi\nAs the Tokugawa clan's territory expanded, many of their regions were hit by earthquakes and heavy rains from 1583 to 1584 In particular, from May to July, heavy rains fell constantly from the Kantō region to the Tōkai region, in what was dubbed the \"heaviest flood in 50 years\" in the historical record of Ietada-nikki [172] It was under these circumstances that the Tokugawa clan was forced to fight against the Hōjō clan and the Toyotomi government, because in 1584 Ieyasu had decided to support Oda Nobukatsu, the eldest surviving son and heir of Oda Nobunaga, against Toyotomi Hideyoshi The Ryumonji Kojiki, written by successive chief priests at Ryumonji Temple in Tahara, Mikawa Province, records that in 1582, many people were mobilized in the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute, which led to the devastation of farmland and famine The devastation of the Tokugawa clan's territory made it difficult to continue fighting against the Toyotomi government, and they were forced to rebuild their country [173] This was a dangerous situation for the Tokugawa clan which could have resulted in their annihilation due to the Oda clan collapsing after Nobunaga's death [174]\n\n\nBecoming a vassal of Toyotomi Regency\nThe conflict with Hideyoshi became dragged down, until Nobukatsu decided to surrender to Hideyoshi With this, Ieyasu lost his motivation to further oppose Hideyoshi, and decided to also submit to Hideyoshi [190] [191] After the peace negotiations between Tokugawa Ieyasu and Toyotomi Hideyoshi in the aftermath of the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute, Naomasa, Tadakatsu, and Yasumasa gained fame in Kyoto The following month, the three of them joined were by Tadatsugu Sakai in accompanying Ieyasu on his personal trip to Kyoto, where the four of them became famous [192]\n\n\nRuling Kanto and supressing rebellions\nin 1590 May, Ieyasu participated in the campaign against the Hōjō clan The siege of Odawara, which was the last Hōjō clan stronghold, saw almost no significant military action, with the exception of Ii Naomasa's night raid attack This happened after a group of miners from Kai Province dug under the castle walls, allowing troops under Naomasa to enter and engage the enemy [200] After the surrender of the Hōjō clan, Ieyasu sent Naomasa and Sakakibara Yasumasa with 1,500 soldiers to witness the seppuku of the defeated enemy generals, Hōjō Ujimasa and Hōjō Ujiteru [201] As result of his meritorious service during this campaign, Naomasa was awarded with increase in his domain to 120,000 koku [202] Daidōji Masashige, a senior Hōjō clan retainer, was also forced to commit seppuku by Hideyoshi, however, his children were spared from execution at the behest of Ieyasu, and the eldest son, Daidōji Naoshige, became a vassal of Ieyasu after the death of Ujinao until his death [203]\n\n\nRuler of Japan (1598–1603)\nIn 1598, with his health clearly failing, Hideyoshi called a meeting that would determine the Council of Five Elders, who would be responsible for ruling on behalf of his son after his death The five that were chosen as tairō (regents) for Hideyori were Maeda Toshiie, Mōri Terumoto, Ukita Hideie, Uesugi Kagekatsu, and Ieyasu, who was the most powerful of the five This change in the pre-Sekigahara power structure, became pivotal as Ieyasu turned his attention towards Kansai; and at the same time, other ambitious (albeit ultimately unrealized) plans, such as the Tokugawa initiative establishing official relations with New Spain (modern-day Mexico), continued to unfold and advance [223] [224]\n\n\nDeath of Hideyoshi and Toshiie\nToyotomi Hideyoshi, after three more months of deteriorating health, died on September 18, 1598 He was nominally succeeded by his young son Hideyori but as he was just five years old, the real power was in the hands of the regents [citation needed] There were several incidents involving Ieyasu after the death of Hideyoshi:\n\n\nConflict with Mitsunari\nMeanwhile, opposition to Ieyasu centered around Ishida Mitsunari, one of Hideyoshi's Go-Bugyō, or top administrators of Hideyoshi's government, and a powerful daimyo who was not one of the regents Mitsunari plotted Ieyasu's death and news of this plot reached some of Ieyasu's generals They attempted to kill Mitsunari but he fled and gained protection from none other than Ieyasu It is not clear why Ieyasu protected a powerful enemy from his own men but Ieyasu was a master strategist and he may have concluded that he would be better off with Mitsunari leading the enemy army rather than one of the regents, who would have more legitimacy [243]\n\n\nBattle of Sekigahara\nThe Battle of Sekigahara was the biggest battle as well as one of the most important in Japanese feudal history It began on October 21, 1600 The Eastern Army led by Tokugawa Ieyasu initially numbered 75,000 men, with the Western Army at a strength of 120,000 men under Ishida Mitsunari Ieyasu had also secretly acquired a supply of arquebuses.\n\n\nAftermath of Sekigahara battle\nIeyasu redistributed the domain fiefs of all the daimyo lords who supported him during the war, such as increasing Ii Naomasa domain to 180,000 koku [249] Ikeda Terumasa's to 520,000 Koku [250] Tōdō Takatora got a new domain which was assessed at total of 200,000 koku, [76] Yuki Hideyasu went from 101,000 to 569,000 koku, Matsudaira Tadayoshi went from 100,000 to 520,000 koku, Gamō Hideyuki increased from 180,000 to 600,000 koku, Maeda Toshinaga went from 835,000 to 1,100,000 koku, Katō Kiyomasa's domain grew from 195,000 to 515,000 koku, and Kuroda Nagamasa's grew from 180,000 to 523,000 koku Meanwhile, Fukushima Masanori had his 200,000 domain increased to 498,000 in Aki, Hiroshima, while Ieyasu also promoted many of his own hereditary vassals to domains of at least 10,000 koku for their stipends [251] After the battle Ieyasu left some Western Army daimyo unharmed, such as the Shimazu clan, but others were completely destroyed Toyotomi Hideyori (the son of Hideyoshi) lost most of his territory which were under management of western daimyo, and he was degraded to an ordinary daimyo, rather than a Sesshō or Kampaku (regent) of the Japanese empire In later years the vassals who had pledged allegiance to Ieyasu before Sekigahara became known as the fudai daimyō, while those who pledged allegiance to him after the battle (after his power was unquestioned) were known as tozama daimyō Tozama daimyō were considered inferior to fudai daimyō [citation needed] This redistribution of domains was done verbally, instead of formal letter of intent, historian Watanabe Daimon suspected this was because Ieyasu was still wary of the existence of Toyotomi clan which had been inherited by Toyotomi Hideyori [251]\n\n\nEstablishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate (1603–1616)\nOn March 24, 1603, Tokugawa Ieyasu received the title of shōgun from Emperor Go-Yōzei [260] Ieyasu was 60 years old He had outlasted all the other great men of his times: Oda Nobunaga, Takeda Shingen, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and Uesugi Kenshin As shōgun, he used his remaining years to create and solidify the Tokugawa shogunate, which ushered in the Edo period, and was the third shogunal government (after the Kamakura and the Ashikaga) He claimed descent from the Minamoto clan who had founded the Kamakura shogunate, by way of the Nitta clan His descendants would marry into the Taira clan and the Fujiwara clan [3]\n\n\nŌgosho (1605–1616)\nFrom 1605 onwards, Ieyasu, who had retired from the official position of shogun and became a retired shōgun (大御所, ōgosho), remained the effective ruler of Japan until his death Ieyasu retired to Sunpu Castle in Sunpu, but he also supervised the building of Edo Castle, a massive construction project which lasted for the rest of Ieyasu's life The result was the largest castle in all of Japan, the cost of building the castle was borne by all the other daimyo, while Ieyasu reaped the benefits The central donjon, or tenshu, burned in the 1657 Meireki fire Today, the Imperial Palace stands on the site of the castle [263] Edo became the center of political power and the de facto capital of Japan, although the historic capital of Kyoto remained the de jure capital as the seat of the emperor [190] [264] Furthermore, Ieyasu had the Imperial Court appoint his eldest remaining son, Hidetada, as Shogun, announcing to the world that the position of shogun would be hereditary to the Tokugawa clan from then on At the same time, he requested Toyotomi Hideyori meet the new shogun, but Hideyori refused In the end, the matter was resolved by sending his sixth son, Matsudaira Tadateru to Osaka Castle At the same time, the next generation of Tokugawa clan vassals such Ii Naotaka and Itakura Shigemasa, were also appointed [265]\n\n\nRelations with Catholics\nAs Ōgosho, Ieyasu also supervised diplomatic affairs with the Netherlands, Spain, and England Ieyasu chose to distance Japan from European influence starting in 1609, although the shogunate did still grant preferential trading rights to the Dutch East India Company and permitted them to maintain a \"factory\" for trading purposes [citation needed]\n\n\nConflict with Hideyori\nThe last remaining threat to Ieyasu's rule was Toyotomi Hideyori, the son and rightful heir to Hideyoshi [3] He was now a young daimyo living in Osaka Castle Many samurai who opposed Ieyasu rallied around Hideyori, claiming that he was the rightful ruler of Japan Ieyasu found fault with the opening ceremony of a temple (Great Buddha of Kyoto) built by Hideyori; it was as if he prayed for Ieyasu's death and the ruin of the Tokugawa clan Ieyasu ordered Hideyori to leave Osaka Castle, but those in the castle refused and summoned samurai to gather within the castle Then in 1614, Tokugawa put Osaka Castle to siege against Hideyori.\n\n\nFinal year & death\nAfter the conflict with Toyotomi Hideyori, Ieyasu implemented the Buke shohatto code, which stated that each daimyo lord was only allowed to possess one castle [289]\n\n\nPersonal information\nA historical evaluation of Ieyasu by Junji Mitsunari, a historian on faculty at Kyushu University, has compared Ieyasu's upbringing to that of another Sengoku era leader, Mōri Terumoto Mitsunari viewed Terumoto, who had been raised in the comfortable and stable domains of the Mōri clan as contrasting with the hardships Ieyasu faced during his childhood, who experienced the unstable region in Mikawa province, where he spend much his youth as hostage of other warlords, thus forming each leader's character into different ways Mitsunari viewed this contrast of leadership style as being reflected in the Sekigahara battle, where the indecisiveness of Terumoto cost the Western army greatly during the crucial moment, while Ieyasu's bold decision and his willingness to take risks gave him the edge during the war [294] John T Kuehn saw Ieyasu as being capable of complex long game strategies both politically and militarily as he shown during his conflict against Ishida Mitsunari Kuehn saw the Siege of Fushimi Castle as Ieyasu's deliberate strategy to sacrifice the castle and to bait Mitsunari into a set-piece battle, where his battle hardened forces had an advantage over Mitsunari's forces [295]\n\n\nArmors & weapons\nMany sets of armors are said to have been used by Ieyasu, and at least 10 pieces of armor were used by Ieyasu during his life and recorded in history.\n\n\nQuotes\nLife is like unto a long journey with a heavy burden Let thy step be slow and steady, that thou stumble not Persuade thyself that imperfection and inconvenience are the lot of natural mortals, and there will be no room for discontent, neither for despair When ambitious desires arise in thy heart, recall the days of extremity thou hast passed through Forbearance is the root of all quietness and assurance forever Look upon the wrath of thy enemy If thou only knowest what it is to conquer, and knowest not what it is to be defeated; woe unto thee, it will fare ill with thee Find fault with thyself rather than with others [309]\n\nReligion\nTokugawa Ieyasu was known for his devotion to the Jōdo-shū school of Buddhism throughout his life, having been born into the Matsudaira clan which followed Jōdō Buddhism As a way of demonstrating his constant favor towards the sect, he moved his familial temple to the Zōjō-ji Temple in Edo and funded massive renovations to older Jōdo temples, including the head temple of Chion-in in Kyoto, while also financing the creation of several new temples After confiding in the abbot of Zōjō-ji temple about wanting to become a deity to protect his country, he was given the advice to regularly recite the nembutsu for the purpose of being born into Amida Buddha's Pure Land of Sukhavati, where he would be able to easily attain Buddhahood and protect his descendants and the entire nation of Japan Ieyasu readily accepted this advice, and constantly repeated the nembutsu until the day he died Despite his personal devotion to Jōdo-shū, Ieyasu was not a strict sectarian, placing his secretary Denchōrō, a Rinzai Zen monk, in charge of all religious affairs in Japan, Buddhist and Shinto alike [312]

daimyo, or feudal lord, who played a crucial role in the unification of Japan and the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate. He was the founder of the Tokugawa dynasty, which ruled Japan from 1603 to 1867. Ieyasu was a skilled military leader and a shrewd politician who was able to navigate the complex web of alliances and rivalries among the daimyos of Japan.\n\n**Early Life (1542-1560)**\n\nTokugawa Ieyasu was born in Okazaki Castle on the 26th day of the 12th month of the eleventh year of Tenbun, according to the Japanese calendar, January 31, 1543, according to the Western calendar. He was the son of Matsudaira Hirotada, the daimyo of Mikawa Province, and Odai no Kata, the daughter of a neighboring samurai lord, Mizuno Tadamasa. His mother and father were step-siblings.\n\n## Hostage Life\n\nAs Oda Nobuhide continued to attack Okazaki, Hirotada turned to his powerful eastern neighbor, Imagawa Yoshimoto, for assistance. Yoshimoto agreed to an alliance under the condition that Hirotada send his young heir to Sunpu Domain as a hostage. Oda Nobuhide learned of this arrangement and had Takechiyo, Ieyasu's younger name, abducted. Takechiyo was five years old at the time. Nobuhide threatened to execute Takechiyo unless his father severed all ties with the Imagawa clan. However, Hirotada refused, stating that sacrificing his own son would show his seriousness in his pact with the Imagawa.\n\n## Service under Imagawa clan\n\nIn 1556, Takechiyo officially came of age, with Imagawa Yoshimoto presiding over his genpuku ceremony. Following tradition, he changed his name from Matsudaira Takechiyo to Matsudaira Jirōsaburō Motonobu. He was also briefly allowed to visit Okazaki to pay his respects to the tomb of his father and receive the homage of his nominal retainers.\n\n**Ieyasu-Nobunaga Alliance (1562-1582)**\n\nSometime in the aftermath of the Okehazama battle, where Imagawa Yoshimoto was slain, Ieyasu formed the Kiyosu Alliance with Oda Nobunaga, daimyo lord of Owari Province and the head of the Oda clan. Ieyasu's territory, Mikawa Province, had been in conflict with the Oda clan for some time. However, the two daimyos eventually formed an alliance, with Ieyasu becoming a vassal of Nobunaga.\n\n**Unification of Mikawa**\n\nDuring this period, the Matsudaira clan faced a threat from the Ikkō-ikki movement, where peasants banded together with militant monks under the Jōdo Shinshū sect, and rejected the traditional feudal social order. Ieyasu undertook several battles to suppress this movement in his territories, including the Battle of Azukizaka (1564).\n\n## Ieyasu's role in the Battle of Azukizaka\n\nIn the Battle of Azukizaka, Ieyasu was fighting on the front lines and was nearly killed when he was struck by several bullets, however, they did not penetrate his armor. Both sides were using new gunpowder weapons, which the Portuguese had introduced to Japan just 20 years earlier. At the end of the battle, the Ikkō-ikki were defeated.\n\n**Tōtōmi campaign against Takeda clan**\n\nIn October 1571, Takeda Shingen broke the alliance with the Oda-Tokugawa forces and allied with the Odawara Hōjō clan. He decided to make a drive for Kyoto at the urging of the shōgun Ashikaga Yoshiaki, starting with invading Tokugawa lands in Tōtōmi. Ieyasu asked for help from Nobunaga, who sent him some 3,000 troops.\n\n## The Battle of Mikatagahara\n\nEarly in 1573, the two armies met at the Battle of Mikatagahara, north Hamamatsu. The considerably larger Takeda army, under the expert direction of Shingen, overwhelmed Ieyasu's troops and caused heavy casualties. Ieyasu ordered his men in his castle to light torches, sound drums, and leave the gates open, to properly receive the returning warriors. This made the Takeda generals suspicious that they were being led into a trap, and so they did not besiege the castle.\n\n**Later life (1582-1616)**\n\nIn 1582, Ieyasu participated in the campaign against the Hōjō clan. The siege of Odawara, which was the last Hōjō clan stronghold, saw almost no significant military action. After the surrender of the Hōjō clan, Ieyasu sent Ii Naomasa and Sakakibara Yasumasa to witness the seppuku of the defeated enemy generals, Hōjō Ujimasa and Hōjō Ujiteru.\n\n**Establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate**\n\nOn March 24, 1603, Ieyasu received the title of shōgun from Emperor Go-Yōzei. He was 60 years old. As shōgun, he used his remaining years to create and solidify the Tokugawa shogunate, which ushered in the Edo period, and was the third shogunal government (after the Kamakura and the Ashikaga).\n\n**Ōgosho (1605-1616)**\n\nFrom 1605 onwards, Ieyasu, who had retired from the official position of shōgun and became a retired shōgun (大御所, ōgosho), remained the effective ruler of Japan until his death. He retired to Sunpu Castle, but he also supervised the building of Edo Castle, a massive construction project which lasted for the rest of Ieyasu's life.\n\n**Conflict with Hideyori**\n\nThe last remaining threat to Ieyasu's rule was Toyotomi Hideyori, the son and rightful heir to Hideyoshi. He was now a young daimyo living in Osaka Castle. Ieyasu found fault with the opening ceremony of a temple (Great Buddha of Kyoto) built by Hideyori; it was as if he prayed for Ieyasu's death and the ruin of the Tokugawa clan. Ieyasu ordered Hideyori to leave Osaka Castle, but those in the castle refused and summoned samurai to gather within the castle.\n\n**Final year and death**\n\nAfter the conflict with Toyotomi Hideyori, Ieyasu implemented the Buke shohatto code, which stated that each daimyo lord was only allowed to possess one castle. Ieyasu died on June 1, 1600 according to the Gregorian calendar, and on the 17th day of the 4th month of Genna 2, according to the Japanese calendar. He was 75 years old.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nIeyasu's life and accomplishments were used as a model for the Japanese statesman, Lord Yoshi Toranaga, portrayed in James Clavell's historical novel Shōgun. The 1980 television miniseries adaptation of the novel, starring Toshiro Mifune as the Shōgun, and the 2024 miniseries, starring Hiroyuki Sanada as the Shōgun, both used Ieyasu as a key reference.\n\n**Personal life**\n\nIeyasu was known for his devotion to the Jōdo-shū school of Buddhism throughout his life. He moved his familial temple to the Zōjō-ji Temple in Edo and funded massive renovations to older Jōdo temples, including the head temple of Chion-in in Kyoto. He also financed the creation of several new temples. Ieyasu had several wives and concubines, including Odai no Kata, Lady Tsukiyama, and Lady Inabahime. He had several children, including Matsudaira Yorizumi, Matsuhime, and Nabeshima Naohiro.\n\n**Adopted children**\n\nIeyasu also adopted several children, including Nabeshima Naotomo and Kakomi Naonaga.\n\n**Ancestry**\n\nIeyasu's ancestry is not well-documented, but it is believed that he was a descendant of the Minamoto clan.\n\n**References**\n\nThere are no references provided for this

However, Hirotada refused, stating that sacrificing his own son would show his seriousness in his pact with the Imagawa Despite this refusal, Nobuhide chose not to kill Takechiyo, but instead held him hostage for the next three years at the Honshōji Temple in Nagoya It was said [by whom?] that Oda Nobunaga met Takechiyo at the temple, when Takechiyo was 6 years old, and Nobunaga was 14 However, Katsuhiro Taniguchi reported there is no concrete historical records about this story of first meeting between Ieyasu with Nobunaga [9]\n\n\nService under Imagawa clan\nIn 1556, Takechiyo officially

of Oda clan [22] [23] [e]\n\n\nUnification of Mikawa\nDuring this period, the Matsudaira clan faced a threat from the Ikkō-ikki movement, where peasants banded together with militant monks under the Jōdo Shinshū sect, and rejected the traditional feudal social order Ieyasu undertook several battles to suppress this movement in his territories, including the Battle of Azukizaka (1564) Some of Ieyasu's vassals were in the Ikkō-ikki ranks, like Honda Masanobu and Natsume Yoshinobu, who had deserted him for the Ikkō-ikki rebellion out of religious sympathy [21] However, many of Ieyasu's core vassals who were also followers of the sect such as Ishikawa Ienari [30] and Honda Tadakatsu quickly abandoned the Ikkō faith of Jōdo Shinshū and stayed loyal to Ieyasu to strike the rebels [31] [32] On January 15, 1564, Ieyasu decided to concentrate his forces to attack and eliminate the Ikkō-ikki from Mikawa In the Battle of Azukizaka, Ieyasu was fighting on the front lines and was nearly killed when he was struck by several bullets however they did not penetrate his armor [31] Both sides were using new gunpowder weapons which the Portuguese had introduced to Japan just 20 years earlier At the end of battle, the Ikkō-ikki were defeated By 1565, Ieyasu had become the master of all of Mikawa Province [citation needed]\n\n\nTokugawa clan\nIn 1567, Ieyasu started the family name \"Tokugawa\", finally changing his name to the well-known Tokugawa Ieyasu As he was a member of the Matsudaira clan, he claimed descent from the Seiwa Genji branch of the Minamoto clan However, as there was no proof that the Matsudaira clan were descendants of Emperor Seiwa, [37] the Emperor initially did not approve the appointment, citing the lack of a precedent for the Serada clan of the Seiwa Genji clan to be appointed as Mikawa no Kami [38] Ieyasu then consulted with imperial noble Konoe Motohisa through the mediation of a Mikawa native and the abbot of the Kyo Seiganji Temple [39] Due to Motohisa's efforts, Yoshida Kaneyoshi discovered a genealogical document in the Manri-koji family that was precedent, saying, \"Tokugawa (belongs) to Minamoto clan, as another offshoot of the Fujiwara clan,\" and a copy was transferred to him and used for the application [38] Then after passing several steps, Ieyasu gained the permission of the Imperial Court and he was bestowed the courtesy title Mikawa-no-kami (Lord of Mikawa) and the court rank of Junior 5th Rank, Lower Grade (從五位下, ju go-i no ge) Though the Tokugawa clan could claim some modicum of freedom, they were very much subject to the requests of Oda Nobunaga Ieyasu remained an ally of Nobunaga and his Mikawa soldiers were part of Nobunaga's army which captured Kyoto in 1568.\n\n\nTōtōmi campaign\nIn 1568, Ieyasu besieged the Horikawa Castle in Tōtōmi [42] However, the castle wasn't captured until 1569 After it was captured, Ieyasu ordered Ishikawa Hanzaburo to massacre the castle prisoners and castle residents, including women and children It was recorded that around 700 people were beheaded on the banks of the Miyakoda River [43] Ōkubo Tadachika, who witnessed this massacre testified in his personal journal, Mikawa Monogatari, that \".. both mens and womens can be cut into pieces  [sic]...\" [44]\n\n\nCampaign against Asakura-Azai clan\nAsakura Yoshikage, the head of the Asakura clan and regent of Ashikaga Yoshiaki, refused to come to Kyōto This caused Nobunaga to declare both of them rebels [49] Several reports from Mikawa Monogatari, Nobunaga Koki, Tokugawa Jikki, and a supplement from Ietada Nikki recorded that Ieyasu and his forces also participated in Oda's punitive campaign against Asakura where they fought and captured the Mount Tenzutsu castle The Oda-Tokugawa forces managed to kill 1,370 enemies on April 25 They continued the next day where they besieged the Kanegasaki castle [50] However, the Azai clan sent reinforcements to relieve the siege and Nobunaga retreated without contacting Ieyasu After dawn, Ieyasu was guided by Kinoshita Tokichi (later named Toyotomi Hideyoshi), an Oda vassal, to withdraw from the battle [51]\n\n\nSuruga campaign against Takeda clan\nIn October 1571, Takeda Shingen broke the alliance with the Oda-Tokugawa forces and allied with the Odawara Hōjō clan He decided to make a drive for Kyoto at the urging of the shōgun Ashikaga Yoshiaki, starting with invading Tokugawa lands in Tōtōmi Takeda Shingen's first objectives in his campaign against Ieyasu were Nishikawa Castle, Yoshida Castle and Futamata Castle In 1572, after besieging Futamata, Shingen would press on past Futamata towards the major Tokugawa home castle at Hamamatsu Ieyasu asked for help from Nobunaga, who sent him some 3,000 troops Early in 1573 the two armies met at the Battle of Mikatagahara, north Hamamatsu The considerably larger Takeda army, under the expert direction of Shingen, overwhelmed Ieyasu's troops and caused heavy casualties Despite his initial reluctance, Ieyasu was convinced by his generals to retreat [54] [47] The battle was a major defeat, but in the interest of maintaining the appearance of a dignified withdrawal, Ieyasu brazenly ordered the men in his castle to light torches, sound drums, and leave the gates open, to properly receive the returning warriors To the surprise and relief of the Tokugawa army, this spectacle made the Takeda generals suspicious that they were being led into a trap, so they did not besiege the castle and instead made camp for the night [54] This error allowed a band of Tokugawa soldiers to raid the camp in the ensuing hours, further upsetting the already disoriented Takeda army, and ultimately resulting in Shingen's decision to call off the offensive altogether Takeda Shingen would not get another chance to advance on Hamamatsu, much less Kyoto, since he died from unknown causes shortly after the siege of Noda Castle later that same year [19]: 153–156 \n\n\nNobuyasu Incident\nIn 1579, Lady Tsukiyama, Ieyasu's wife, and his heir Nobuyasu were accused by Nobunaga of conspiring with Takeda Katsuyori to assassinate Nobunaga, whose daughter Tokuhime was married to Nobuyasu Ieyasu ordered his wife to be executed and forced his son to commit seppuku because of these accusations [63] [64]\n\n\nTakeda clan annihilation\nIn 1580, Ieyasu built five fortresses in order to isolate Takatenjin Castle from external supplies and reinforcements [66] [67] [68] In addition to those 5 new fortresses, Ieyasu renovated an old castle named Ogasayama fort, which had originally been built by Ieyasu far before the conquest of Tōtōmi Province against Imagawa clan to capture Kakegawa Castle [68] With the six fortresses, which were referred to as the \"six fortresses of Takatenjin\", completed, Ieyasu assigned Ishikawa Yasumichi to the Ogasayama fort, Honda Yasushige to the Nogasaka fort, Osuga Yasutaka to the Higamine, [66] Shishigahana, [69] and Nakamura forts, [66] while Sakai Ietada was appointed to garrison the Mitsuiyama fort [67] [66] The Takatenjin castle which was defended by Okabe Motonobu, immediately suffered from a period of starvation as they were deprived of any resources or supplies to sustain the population inside the castle, while the siege outside the castle by Oda-Tokugawa forces intensified [66] In response, Motonobu tried to negotiate a truce with Ieyasu by offering Takisakai Castle and Koyama Castle in exchange for Takatenjin castle being spared from the siege [70] However, after Ieyasu consulted with Nobunaga on this matter he refused Motonobu's plea Nobunaga stated his reason in a letter saying that if Takeda Katsuyori sent his forces to assist Motonobu, then there would be an opportunity to bait the Takeda army out and annihilate them on the field Meanwhile, Nobunaga also stated that if Katsuyori neglected helping Motonobu at all, it would damage the Takeda clan's credibility because they could not save their own vassals [71]\n\n\nTokugawa expansions (1582–1584)\nIn late June 1582, before the incident at Honnō-ji temple, Oda Nobunaga invited Ieyasu to tour the Kansai region in celebration of the demise of the Takeda clan When he learned that Nobunaga had been killed at the Honnō-ji temple by Akechi Mitsuhide\n\n\n\"Shinkun Iga-goe\" journey\nTokugawa Ieyasu heard the news that Nobunaga had been killed at the Honnō-ji temple by Akechi Mitsuhide while in Hirakata, Osaka, but at the time, he had only few companions with him, [79] notably Sakai Tadatsugu, Ii Naomasa, and Honda Tadakatsu, Sakakibara Yasumasa and some others [40]: 314–315  [80] [81] The Iga provincial route was dangerous because of the Ochimusha-gari, or \"Samurai hunters\" gangs [h] Ieyasu and his party, therefore, chose the shortest route back to the Mikawa Province by crossing the Iga Province, but the exact route differs in many versions according to primary sources such as the records of Tokugawa Nikki or Mikawa Todai-Hon:\n\n\nTenshō-Jingo war\nAfter Ieyasu reached Mikawa, he immediately moved to shift his focus on the large former Takeda clan territory as he expected unrest there So as a preemptive measure, Ieyasu dispatched Honda Nobutoshi to contact Kawajiri Hidetaka, who ruled Suwa District as a vassal of the Oda clan, to request cooperation [92]\n\n\nPreliminary movements\nAt first the Hōjō clan who ruled Kantō region led an army of 55,000 men to invade the Shinano Province through Usui, [94] as they aimed to prevent a Tokugawa incursion of Kai [101] By June 13, the Hōjō clan had captured Iwadono Castle in Tsuru District, and instructed Watanabe Shozaemon, a local magistrate from the Tsuru District to assist them in their conquest [102] Subsequently, Sanada Masayuki led his army and captured the Numata Castle for the Uesugi clan [103] On June 14 however, Kawajiri Hidetaka killed Honda Nobutoshi This was followed by an uprising from many  of the clans in the Kai province against Hidetaka the following day, which resulted in Hidetaka being killed on June 18 [104] The Hōjō also gained support from a former Takeda vassal in the form of the Hoshina clan which was led by Hoshina Masatoshi and his sons Hoshina Masanao and Naitō Masaaki [105] By the end of June, they had secured all of the territory except for the areas controlled by the Sanada in Numata and Agatsuma [106]\n\n\nConflict chronology\nIeyasu deployed his forces to various fortresses in the Kōfu Basin to oppose Ujinao, who had camped his army in the area of present-day Hokuto City Hattori Hanzō led Iga clan warriors to Katsuyama Castle (Kamisone-cho, Kofu City), Minakuchi Castle, and Kotohirayama Castle (Misakuchi-cho, Kofu City), where he monitored the Nakamichi road connecting Kai and Suruga [119] Ieyasu managed to recruit more samurai clans who had formerly served under various Takeda generals such as Ichijō Nobutatsu, Yamagata Masakage, and Hara Masatane with the assistance of Ii Naomasa Naomasa dealt with around 41 letters of submission to the Tokugawa clan [120] [121] Furthermore, Naomasa also received another letter of submission from Obata Nobusada, the leader of the Takeda clan red armored cavalry troops [m]\n\n\nAftermath of Tenshō-Jingo war\nThe problems for the Hōjō clan increased by the day as Ieyasu established contact with daimyo lords from north-east Japan such as the Satake, Yuki, and Utsunomiya clans, who threatened to invade the Hōjō from behind while the Hōjō were still engaging Ieyasu in battle [101] As the war turned in favor of Ieyasu, combined with the defection of Sanada Masayuki to the Tokugawa side, the Hōjō negotiated a truce with Ieyasu [146]\n\n\nIeyasu and Hideyoshi (1584–1598)\nAs the Tokugawa clan's territory expanded, many of their regions were hit by earthquakes and heavy rains from 1583 to 1584 In particular, from May to July, heavy rains fell constantly from the Kantō region to the Tōkai region, in what was dubbed the \"heaviest flood in 50 years\" in the historical record of Ietada-nikki [172] It was under these circumstances that the Tokugawa clan was forced to fight against the Hōjō clan and the Toyotomi government, because in 1584 Ieyasu had decided to support Oda Nobukatsu, the eldest surviving son and heir of Oda Nobunaga, against Toyotomi Hideyoshi The Ryumonji Kojiki, written by successive chief priests at Ryumonji Temple in Tahara, Mikawa Province, records that in 1582, many people were mobilized in the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute, which led to the devastation of farmland and famine The devastation of the Tokugawa clan's territory made it difficult to continue fighting against the Toyotomi government, and they were forced to rebuild their country [173] This was a dangerous situation for the Tokugawa clan which could have resulted in their annihilation due to the Oda clan collapsing after Nobunaga's death [174]\n\n\nEarthquakes and conflict with Hideyoshi\nAs the Tokugawa clan's territory expanded, many of their regions were hit by earthquakes and heavy rains from 1583 to 1584 In particular, from May to July, heavy rains fell constantly from the Kantō region to the Tōkai region, in what was dubbed the \"heaviest flood in 50 years\" in the historical record of Ietada-nikki [172] It was under these circumstances that the Tokugawa clan was forced to fight against the Hōjō clan and the Toyotomi government, because in 1584 Ieyasu had decided to support Oda Nobukatsu, the eldest surviving son and heir of Oda Nobunaga, against Toyotomi Hideyoshi The Ryumonji Kojiki, written by successive chief priests at Ryumonji Temple in Tahara, Mikawa Province, records that in 1582, many people were mobilized in the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute, which led to the devastation of farmland and famine The devastation of the Tokugawa clan's territory made it difficult to continue fighting against the Toyotomi government, and they were forced to rebuild their country [173] This was a dangerous situation for the Tokugawa clan which could have resulted in their annihilation due to the Oda clan collapsing after Nobunaga's death [174]\n\n\nBecoming a vassal of Toyotomi Regency\nThe conflict with Hideyoshi became dragged down, until Nobukatsu decided to surrender to Hideyoshi With this, Ieyasu lost his motivation to further oppose Hideyoshi, and decided to also submit to Hideyoshi [190] [191] After the peace negotiations between Tokugawa Ieyasu and Toyotomi Hideyoshi in the aftermath of the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute, Naomasa, Tadakatsu, and Yasumasa gained fame in Kyoto The following month, the three of them joined were by Tadatsugu Sakai in accompanying Ieyasu on his personal trip to Kyoto, where the four of them became famous [192]\n\n\nRuling Kanto and supressing rebellions\nin 1590 May, Ieyasu participated in the campaign against the Hōjō clan The siege of Odawara, which was the last Hōjō clan stronghold, saw almost no significant military action, with the exception of Ii Naomasa's night raid attack This happened after a group of miners from Kai Province dug under the castle walls, allowing troops under Naomasa to enter and engage the enemy [200] After the surrender of the Hōjō clan, Ieyasu sent Naomasa and Sakakibara Yasumasa with 1,500 soldiers to witness the seppuku of the defeated enemy generals, Hōjō Ujimasa and Hōjō Ujiteru [201] As result of his meritorious service during this campaign, Naomasa was awarded with increase in his domain to 120,000 koku [202] Daidōji Masashige, a senior Hōjō clan retainer, was also forced to commit seppuku by Hideyoshi, however, his children were spared from execution at the behest of Ieyasu, and the eldest son, Daidōji Naoshige, became a vassal of Ieyasu after the death of Ujinao until his death [203]\n\n\nRuler of Japan (1598–1603)\nIn 1598, with his health clearly failing, Hideyoshi called a meeting that would determine the Council of Five Elders, who would be responsible for ruling on behalf of his son after his death The five that were chosen as tairō (regents) for Hideyori were Maeda Toshiie, Mōri Terumoto, Ukita Hideie, Uesugi Kagekatsu, and Ieyasu, who was the most powerful of the five This change in the pre-Sekigahara power structure, became pivotal as Ieyasu turned his attention towards Kansai; and at the same time, other ambitious (albeit ultimately unrealized) plans, such as the Tokugawa initiative establishing official relations with New Spain (modern-day Mexico), continued to unfold and advance [223] [224]\n\n\nDeath of Hideyoshi and Toshiie\nToyotomi Hideyoshi, after three more months of deteriorating health, died on September 18, 1598 He was nominally succeeded by his young son Hideyori but as he was just five years old, the real power was in the hands of the regents [citation needed] There were several incidents involving Ieyasu after the death of Hideyoshi:\n\n\nConflict with Mitsunari\nMeanwhile, opposition to Ieyasu centered around Ishida Mitsunari, one of Hideyoshi's Go-Bugyō, or top administrators of Hideyoshi's government, and a powerful daimyo who was not one of the regents Mitsunari plotted Ieyasu's death and news of this plot reached some of Ieyasu's generals They attempted to kill Mitsunari but he fled and gained protection from none other than Ieyasu It is not clear why Ieyasu protected a powerful enemy from his own men but Ieyasu was a master strategist and he may have concluded that he would be better off with Mitsunari leading the enemy army rather than one of the regents, who would have more legitimacy [243]\n\n\nBattle of Sekigahara\nThe Battle of Sekigahara was the biggest battle as well as one of the most important in Japanese feudal history It began on October 21, 1600 The Eastern Army led by Tokugawa Ieyasu initially numbered 75,000 men, with the Western Army at a strength of 120,000 men under Ishida Mitsunari Ieyasu had also secretly acquired a supply of arquebuses.\n\n\nAftermath of Sekigahara battle\nIeyasu redistributed the domain fiefs of all the daimyo lords who supported him during the war, such as increasing Ii Naomasa domain to 180,000 koku [249] Ikeda Terumasa's to 520,000 Koku [250] Tōdō Takatora got a new domain which was assessed at total of 200,000 koku, [76] Yuki Hideyasu went from 101,000 to 569,000 koku, Matsudaira Tadayoshi went from 100,000 to 520,000 koku, Gamō Hideyuki increased from 180,000 to 600,000 koku, Maeda Toshinaga went from 835,000 to 1,100,000 koku, Katō Kiyomasa's domain grew from 195,000 to 515,000 koku, and Kuroda Nagamasa's grew from 180,000 to 523,000 koku Meanwhile, Fukushima Masanori had his 200,000 domain increased to 498,000 in Aki, Hiroshima, while Ieyasu also promoted many of his own hereditary vassals to domains of at least 10,000 koku for their stipends [251] After the battle Ieyasu left some Western Army daimyo unharmed, such as the Shimazu clan, but others were completely destroyed Toyotomi Hideyori (the son of Hideyoshi) lost most of his territory which were under management of western daimyo, and he was degraded to an ordinary daimyo, rather than a Sesshō or Kampaku (regent) of the Japanese empire In later years the vassals who had pledged allegiance to Ieyasu before Sekigahara became known as the fudai daimyō, while those who pledged allegiance to him after the battle (after his power was unquestioned) were known as tozama daimyō Tozama daimyō were considered inferior to fudai daimyō [citation needed] This redistribution of domains was done verbally, instead of formal letter of intent, historian Watanabe Daimon suspected this was because Ieyasu was still wary of the existence of Toyotomi clan which had been inherited by Toyotomi Hideyori [251]\n\n\nEstablishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate (1603–1616)\nOn March 24, 1603, Tokugawa Ieyasu received the title of shōgun from Emperor Go-Yōzei [260] Ieyasu was 60 years old He had outlasted all the other great men of his times: Oda Nobunaga, Takeda Shingen, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and Uesugi Kenshin As shōgun, he used his remaining years to create and solidify the Tokugawa shogunate, which ushered in the Edo period, and was the third shogunal government (after the Kamakura and the Ashikaga) He claimed descent from the Minamoto clan who had founded the Kamakura shogunate, by way of the Nitta clan His descendants would marry into the Taira clan and the Fujiwara clan [3]\n\n\nŌgosho (1605–1616)\nFrom 1605 onwards, Ieyasu, who had retired from the official position of shogun and became a retired shōgun (大御所, ōgosho), remained the effective ruler of Japan until his death Ieyasu retired to Sunpu Castle in Sunpu, but he also supervised the building of Edo Castle, a massive construction project which lasted for the rest of Ieyasu's life The result was the largest castle in all of Japan, the cost of building the castle was borne by all the other daimyo, while Ieyasu reaped the benefits The central donjon, or tenshu, burned in the 1657 Meireki fire Today, the Imperial Palace stands on the site of the castle [263] Edo became the center of political power and the de facto capital of Japan, although the historic capital of Kyoto remained the de jure capital as the seat of the emperor [190] [264] Furthermore, Ieyasu had the Imperial Court appoint his eldest remaining son, Hidetada, as Shogun, announcing to the world that the position of shogun would be hereditary to the Tokugawa clan from then on At the same time, he requested Toyotomi Hideyori meet the new shogun, but Hideyori refused In the end, the matter was resolved by sending his sixth son, Matsudaira Tadateru to Osaka Castle At the same time, the next generation of Tokugawa clan vassals such Ii Naotaka and Itakura Shigemasa, were also appointed [265]\n\n\nRelations with Catholics\nAs Ōgosho, Ieyasu also supervised diplomatic affairs with the Netherlands, Spain, and England Ieyasu chose to distance Japan from European influence starting in 1609, although the shogunate did still grant preferential trading rights to the Dutch East India Company and permitted them to maintain a \"factory\" for trading purposes [citation needed]\n\n\nConflict with Hideyori\nThe last remaining threat to Ieyasu's rule was Toyotomi Hideyori, the son and rightful heir to Hideyoshi [3] He was now a young daimyo living in Osaka Castle Many samurai who opposed Ieyasu rallied around Hideyori, claiming that he was the rightful ruler of Japan Ieyasu found fault with the opening ceremony of a temple (Great Buddha of Kyoto) built by Hideyori; it was as if he prayed for Ieyasu's death and the ruin of the Tokugawa clan Ieyasu ordered Hideyori to leave Osaka Castle, but those in the castle refused and summoned samurai to gather within the castle Then in 1614, Tokugawa put Osaka Castle to siege against Hideyori.\n\n\nFinal year & death\nAfter the conflict with Toyotomi Hideyori, Ieyasu implemented the Buke shohatto code, which stated that each daimyo lord was only allowed to possess one castle [289]\n\n\nPersonal information\nA historical evaluation of Ieyasu by Junji Mitsunari, a historian on faculty at Kyushu University, has compared Ieyasu's upbringing to that of another Sengoku era leader, Mōri Terumoto Mitsunari viewed Terumoto, who had been raised in the comfortable and stable domains of the Mōri clan as contrasting with the hardships Ieyasu faced during his childhood, who experienced the unstable region in Mikawa province, where he spend much his youth as hostage of other warlords, thus forming each leader's character into different ways Mitsunari viewed this contrast of leadership style as being reflected in the Sekigahara battle, where the indecisiveness of Terumoto cost the Western army greatly during the crucial moment, while Ieyasu's bold decision and his willingness to take risks gave him the edge during the war [294] John T Kuehn saw Ieyasu as being capable of complex long game strategies both politically and militarily as he shown during his conflict against Ishida Mitsunari Kuehn saw the Siege of Fushimi Castle as Ieyasu's deliberate strategy to sacrifice the castle and to bait Mitsunari into a set-piece battle, where his battle hardened forces had an advantage over Mitsunari's forces [295]\n\n\nArmors & weapons\nMany sets of armors are said to have been used by Ieyasu, and at least 10 pieces of armor were used by Ieyasu during his life and recorded in history.\n\n\nQuotes\nLife is like unto a long journey with a heavy burden Let thy step be slow and steady, that thou stumble not Persuade thyself that imperfection and inconvenience are the lot of natural mortals, and there will be no room for discontent, neither for despair When ambitious desires arise in thy heart, recall the days of extremity thou hast passed through Forbearance is the root of all quietness and assurance forever Look upon the wrath of thy enemy If thou only knowest what it is to conquer, and knowest not what it is to be defeated; woe unto thee, it will fare ill with thee Find fault with thyself rather than with others [309]\n\nReligion\nTokugawa Ieyasu was known for his devotion to the Jōdo-shū school of Buddhism throughout his life, having been born into the Matsudaira clan which followed Jōdō Buddhism As a way of demonstrating his constant favor towards the sect, he moved his familial temple to the Zōjō-ji Temple in Edo and funded massive renovations to older Jōdo temples, including the head temple of Chion-in in Kyoto, while also financing the creation of several new temples After confiding in the abbot of Zōjō-ji temple about wanting to become a deity to protect his country, he was given the advice to regularly recite the nembutsu for the purpose of being born into Amida Buddha's Pure Land of Sukhavati, where he would be able to easily attain Buddhahood and protect his descendants and the entire nation of Japan Ieyasu readily accepted this advice, and constantly repeated the nembutsu until the day he died Despite his personal devotion to Jōdo-shū, Ieyasu was not a strict sectarian, placing his secretary Denchōrō, a Rinzai Zen monk, in charge of all religious affairs in Japan, Buddhist and Shinto alike [312] [313]\n\n\nHonours\nMatsudaira Yorizumi (1641–1711) of Saijō DomainInabahime (1631–1709) married Ikeda Mitsunaka

It is used by the French Army for reconnaissance and infantry support roles.\n\n**Design and Development**\n\nInitial work on the AMX-10 RC began in 1970, with prototypes testing starting in 1976. The first production vehicle was delivered in 1981 to the 2nd Regiment de Hussards in Sourdun, France. The vehicle features a powerful GIAT 105 mm gun mounted in a welded aluminum turret, which houses three crew members. The driver sits in the front of the hull, and a COTAC fire control system is provided for gun aiming.\n\n## Suspension and Running Gear\n\nThe 6x6 AMX-10 RC is fitted with a hydropneumatic suspension system with variable ground clearance and tilt, provided by Messier Auto-Industry. A centralized lubrication and tire inflation system is fitted, and a shock damper is mounted at each wheel station.\n\n## Armament\n\nThe AMX-10 RC is fitted with a 105/47 F2 MECA 105 mm medium-pressure gun, mounted in a GIAT Industries TK 105 three-man turret.

The fund is known for its focus on short selling and has been involved in several high-profile trades, including the GameStop short squeeze in 2021. This article provides an overview of the fund's history, performance, and recent developments.\n\n**History**\n\nMelvin Capital was founded by Gabriel Plotkin, a former trader at SAC Capital, in 2014. Prior to starting Melvin Capital, Plotkin had a successful career in finance, including stints at Citadel LLC and North Sound Capital. Plotkin's experience and expertise in trading and investing have been instrumental in shaping the fund's strategy and performance.\n\n**Background**\n\nBefore founding Melvin Capital, Plotkin had a degree in economics from Northwestern University, which he earned in 2001. After graduating, he joined Ken Griffin's hedge fund Citadel LLC, where he worked for several years. Plotkin later moved to Connecticut-based hedge fund North Sound Capital, where he continued to hone his skills as a trader. In 2014, he left SAC Capital, where he managed a portfolio of mostly consumer stocks valued at about $1.3 billion, to start Melvin Capital.\n\n**Foundation and Performance Before 2021**\n\nMelvin Capital was founded with a focus on short selling, which involves betting against the performance of a particular stock or market. Plotkin described the fund to Bloomberg as \"a very human-intensive place,\" where a team of analysts is required to generate ideas and execute trades. The fund has an intense focus on the short side, which has been successful in generating returns in the past. In its early years, Melvin Capital raised nearly $1 billion and has been known for its aggressive trading approach.\n\n**2021 Losses**\n\nIn early 2021, Melvin Capital suffered significant losses due to a series of short bets that went awry. The fund's losses were exacerbated by the GameStop short squeeze, a phenomenon in which a group of investors on the subreddit r/WallStreetBets made widespread bets on the stock's price, causing a rapid increase in its value. Melvin Capital, along with other hedge funds, was caught off guard by the sudden surge in GameStop's stock price and lost millions of dollars as a result.\n\nIn January 2021, Citadel and Point72 invested $2.75 billion in Melvin Capital in exchange for non-controlling revenue shares of the fund. The investment was seen as a lifeline for the fund, which was struggling to recover from its losses. However, the fund's losses continued to mount, with reports suggesting that Melvin Capital was losing more than a billion dollars a day at the height of the squeeze.\n\n**2022**\n\nIn May 2022, Bloomberg News reported that Melvin Capital planned to close its funds and return the cash to its investors by June 30. The move was seen as a response to the fund's ongoing struggles and the changing market conditions. The closure of the fund marked the end of an era for Melvin Capital, which had been one of the most prominent hedge funds in the industry.\n\n**Executives**\n\nGabriel Plotkin is the founder and chief investment officer (CIO) of Melvin Capital. Plotkin is a well-known figure in the hedge fund industry and has been recognized for his expertise and success as a trader. In 2017, Plotkin earned about $300 million in compensation, making him the 20th-highest-paid hedge fund manager that year.\n\nPlotkin has also been involved in various other business ventures, including a minority interest in the Charlotte Hornets, a professional basketball team. In 2019, Plotkin purchased a minority stake in the team from Michael Jordan, and in June 2023, he led a group of investors who bought Jordan's majority stake in the Hornets.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMelvin Capital was a prominent hedge fund that was known for its focus on short selling and aggressive trading approach. The fund's history and performance were marked by significant ups and downs, including the GameStop short squeeze in 2021, which resulted in significant losses for the fund. The closure of the fund in 2022 marked the end of an era for Melvin Capital, but the legacy of the fund and its founder, Gabriel Plotkin, will continue to be felt in the hedge fund industry.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Melvin_Capital\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nAfter graduating from Northwestern University with a degree in economics in 2001, Gabriel Plotkin joined Ken Griffin's hedge fund Citadel LLC, and later Connecticut-based hedge fund North Sound Capital [9] Prior to starting Melvin Capital, Plotkin was a trader at Steve Cohen's SAC Capital, where he managed a portfolio of mostly consumer stocks valued at about $1.3 billion [1]\n\n\nBackground\nAfter graduating from Northwestern University with a degree in economics in 2001, Gabriel Plotkin joined Ken Griffin's hedge fund Citadel LLC, and later Connecticut-based hedge fund North Sound Capital [9] Prior to starting Melvin Capital, Plotkin was a trader at Steve Cohen's SAC Capital, where he managed a portfolio of mostly consumer stocks valued at about $1.3 billion [1]\n\n\nFoundation and performance before 2021\nPlotkin founded Melvin Capital, after leaving SAC in late 2014, naming the fund after his late grandfather who was a small-business owner [1] He raised nearly $1 billion [12] [13] Plotkin described the fund to Bloomberg as \"a very human-intensive place We have a lot of analysts, we require a lot out of them.\" [14] He also said that the fund has an \"intense focus\" on the short side (i.e short selling) [14]\n\n\n2021 losses\nIn early 2021 the fund lost over 30% due to numerous short bets that went awry, including GameStop [23] Users of the subreddit r/WallStreetBets made widespread bets believing that GameStop's stock would increase in value [24] In January, Citadel and Point72 invested $2.75 billion in Melvin in exchange for non-controlling revenue shares of the fund [23] [25] [26] [27] CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin reported that Melvin Capital had closed (i.e covered) its short position in GameStop on January 26 in the afternoon, although CNBC could not confirm the amount that Melvin Capital lost Melvin Capital also refuted rumors that the fund intended to file for bankruptcy [28] [29] On January 27 Bloomberg News reported that losses had continued past the 30% reported on January 24 by The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) [30] The fund had also repositioned its portfolio according to the source [30] During the height of the squeeze, Melvin was reportedly losing more than a billion dollars a day [6]\n\n\n2022\nIn May 2022, Bloomberg News reported that Melvin Capital planned to close its funds and return the cash to its investors by June 30 [37] [38]\n\n\nExecutives\nThe fund was led by Founder & CIO Gabriel \"Gabe\" Plotkin According to Forbes, Plotkin earned about $300 million in compensation in 2017, making him the 20th-highest-paid hedge fund manager that year [39] In December 2020, Plotkin purchased two adjacent houses in Florida for $44 million [40] Plotkin purchased a minority interest in the Charlotte Hornets in 2019 from Michael Jordan [41] Plotkin led a group of investors who bought Jordan's majority stake in the Hornets in June 2023 [42]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The use of national flags is a widespread practice among sovereign states, and they play a significant role in international relations, diplomatic communication, and national pride.\n\n**Background and Definitions**\n\nA national flag is defined as a flag that represents or is an emblem of a country. The word country can be used to refer to a sovereign state, which is a state that has full independence and is recognized by the international community. The concept of a sovereign state is a fundamental principle of international law, and it is customary for states to adopt a flag to distinguish themselves from other states.\n\nThe adoption of national flags is a long-standing tradition that dates back to ancient times. The use of flags as symbols of identity and affiliation has been documented in various civilizations, including the ancient Greeks, Romans, and Chinese. In modern times, the use of national flags has become a standardized practice among sovereign states, with each country having its unique flag design, colors, and symbolism.\n\n**Flags of UN Member States and Observer States**\n\nThe United Nations (UN) is an international organization that brings together sovereign states to promote peace, security, and cooperation among nations. The UN has 193 member states and 2 observer states.

The flags are used in various international forums, including the UN General Assembly, the UN Security Council, and other international conferences.\n\nThe flags of UN member states and observer states are also an important aspect of national pride, as they represent a country's history, culture, and values. The flags are often displayed in government buildings, embassies, and cultural institutions, and they are used in various national celebrations and events.\n\n**Flags of De facto States**\n\nA de facto state is a state that exists in reality, but is not recognized by the international community as a sovereign state. De facto states often have a declared independence, but they may not have control over their territory, economy, or international relations.\n\nThere are several de facto states around the world, including the Palestinian Authority, the Kosovo Republic, and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Each of these de facto states has its own national flag, which serves as a symbol of its identity and sovereignty.\n\nThe flags of de facto states are often not recognized by the international community, and they may not be used in official international forums. However, they are still an important aspect of national identity and pride, as they represent a country's history, culture, and values.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* List of sovereign states by population\n* List of sovereign states by land area\n* List of sovereign states by continent\n* List of sovereign states by region\n* National emblems of sovereign states\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The list of national flags in this article is not exhaustive, and it only includes a selection of flags from around the world.\n* The design and symbolism of national flags can vary widely, and they may reflect a country's history, culture, and values.\n* National flags are an important aspect of national identity and pride, and they serve as a visual representation of a country's sovereignty and independence.\n\n**References**\n\n* [Insert references here]\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* [Insert bibliography here]\n\n**Further Reading**\n\n* [Insert further reading here]\n\nThe adoption of national flags is a long-standing tradition that dates back to ancient times.

[27] as he saw Russell's raw athletic potential, coach George Powles encouraged him to work on his fundamentals [21] After Russell was cut from the junior varsity basketball team as a junior in high school, Powles gave him a spot on the varsity team and bought him a yearlong community center membership [28] Since Russell's previous experiences with white authority figures were often negative, warm words from Powles reassured him Frank Robinson, a future member of the Baseball Hall of Fame, was one of Russell's high school basketball teammates [29]\n\n\nCollege career\nRussell started college at USF in 1952 [34] He averaged 20 points per game on the Dons’ freshman basketball team, [35] and made his varsity debut on December 1, 1953 [36] He became the starting center for coach Phil Woolpert, who  emphasized defense and deliberate half-court play, which favored Russell's exceptional defensive skills [37] Woolpert's choice of how to deploy his players was unaffected by their skin color In 1954, he became the first coach of a major college basketball program to start three African-American players: K C Jones, Hal Perry, and Russell [5] In his USF years, Russell took advantage of his relative lack of bulk to guard other players than the opposing center: using his quickness and speed, he would double-up on forwards and aggressively challenge their shots [37] Russell played on USF's varsity team from 1953 to 1956 [38]\n\n\nUniversity of San Francisco\nRussell started college at USF in 1952 [34] He averaged 20 points per game on the Dons’ freshman basketball team, [35] and made his varsity debut on December 1, 1953 [36] He became the starting center for coach Phil Woolpert, who  emphasized defense and deliberate half-court play, which favored Russell's exceptional defensive skills [37] Woolpert's choice of how to deploy his players was unaffected by their skin color In 1954, he became the first coach of a major college basketball program to start three African-American players: K C Jones, Hal Perry, and Russell [5] In his USF years, Russell took advantage of his relative lack of bulk to guard other players than the opposing center: using his quickness and speed, he would double-up on forwards and aggressively challenge their shots [37] Russell played on USF's varsity team from 1953 to 1956 [38]\n\n\nBasketball\nRussell started college at USF in 1952 [34] He averaged 20 points per game on the Dons’ freshman basketball team, [35] and made his varsity debut on December 1, 1953 [36] He became the starting center for coach Phil Woolpert, who  emphasized defense and deliberate half-court play, which favored Russell's exceptional defensive skills [37] Woolpert's choice of how to deploy his players was unaffected by their skin color In 1954, he became the first coach of a major college basketball program to start three African-American players: K C Jones, Hal Perry, and Russell [5] In his USF years, Russell took advantage of his relative lack of bulk to guard other players than the opposing center: using his quickness and speed, he would double-up on forwards and aggressively challenge their shots [37] Russell played on USF's varsity team from 1953 to 1956 [38]\n\n\nTrack and field\nBesides basketball, Russell represented USF in track and field events He was a standout in the high jump and according to Track & Field News was ranked the seventh-best high-jumper in the world in 1956, his graduation year, despite not competing in Olympic high-jump competition [22] [50] That year, Russell won high jump titles at the Central California Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) meet, the Pacific AAU meet, and the West Coast Relays (WCR) One of his highest jumps occurred at the WCR, where he achieved a mark of 6 feet 9+1⁄4 inches (2.06 m); [51] at the meet, Russell tied Charlie Dumas, who would later in the year win gold in the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia for the United States and become the first person to high-jump 7 feet (2.13 m) [52] this was all before the Fosbury Flop was introduced, with which all high jump world records after 1978 have been set [53] [54] [55] He also competed in the 440 yards (402.3 m) race, which he could complete in 49.6 seconds [56]\n\n\n1956 Summer Olympics\nBefore his NBA rookie year, Russell was the captain of the 1956 U.S men's Olympic basketball team that competed at the 1956 Summer Olympics, [57] which was held in November and December in Melbourne, Australia Avery Brundage, head of the International Olympic Committee, argued that Russell had already signed a professional contract and was no longer an amateur (as nominally required at the time), but Russell prevailed [58] He had the option to skip the tournament and play a full season for the Celtics, but he was determined to play in the Olympics He later commented that he would have participated in the high jump if he had been snubbed by the basketball team [22]\n\n\nProfessional career\nThe Harlem Globetrotters invited Russell to join their exhibition basketball squad, but Russell, who was sensitive to racial prejudice, was enraged by the fact that Globetrotters owner Abe Saperstein would only discuss the matter with USF Coach Woolpert, and not Russell While Saperstein spoke to Woolpert in a meeting, Globetrotters assistant coach Harry Hanna tried to entertain Russell with jokes, but he was livid after this snub and declined the offer He reasoned that if Saperstein was too smart to speak with him, then he was too smart to play for Saperstein Russell made himself eligible for the 1956 NBA draft [62]\n\n\nBoston Celtics (1956–1969)\nDue to his Olympic commitment, Russell could not join the Celtics for the 1956–57 NBA season until December [65] The 1956–57 Boston Celtics season saw the debut of a starting lineup made up of five future Hall-of-Famers: center Russell, forwards Heinsohn and Frank Ramsey, and guards Bill Sharman and Bob Cousy [66] Russell's first Celtics game came on December 22, 1956, against the St Louis Hawks [67] Auerbach assigned him to shut down the Hawks' main scorer, Bob Pettit, and Russell impressed the Boston crowd with his man-to-man defense and shot-blocking [67] In previous years, the Celtics had been a high-scoring team but lacked the defensive presence needed to close out tight games With the added defensive presence of Russell, the Celtics had laid the foundation for a dynasty, as the team utilized a strong defensive approach to the game, forcing opposing teams to commit many turnovers, which led to many easy points on fast breaks [67]\n\n\n1956–1958: Rookie champion and early years\nDue to his Olympic commitment, Russell could not join the Celtics for the 1956–57 NBA season until December [65] The 1956–57 Boston Celtics season saw the debut of a starting lineup made up of five future Hall-of-Famers: center Russell, forwards Heinsohn and Frank Ramsey, and guards Bill Sharman and Bob Cousy [66] Russell's first Celtics game came on December 22, 1956, against the St Louis Hawks [67] Auerbach assigned him to shut down the Hawks' main scorer, Bob Pettit, and Russell impressed the Boston crowd with his man-to-man defense and shot-blocking [67] In previous years, the Celtics had been a high-scoring team but lacked the defensive presence needed to close out tight games With the added defensive presence of Russell, the Celtics had laid the foundation for a dynasty, as the team utilized a strong defensive approach to the game, forcing opposing teams to commit many turnovers, which led to many easy points on fast breaks [67]\n\n\n1958–1966: Eight straight NBA championships\nIn the 1958–59 NBA season, Russell averaged 16.7 points per game and 23.0 rebounds per game [1] The Celtics broke a league record by winning 52 games and Russell's strong performance once again helped lead the Celtics through the 1959 NBA playoffs, as they returned to the NBA Finals In the 1959 NBA Finals, the Celtics recaptured the NBA title, sweeping the Minneapolis Lakers 4–0 [77] Lakers head coach John Kundla praised Russell, stating: \"We don't fear the Celtics without Bill Russell Take him out and we can beat them .. He's the guy who whipped us psychologically.\" [63]\n\n\n1966–1969: Player-coach champion and final seasons\nCeltics coach Red Auerbach retired before the 1966–67 NBA season To coach the Celtics, he had initially wanted his old player Frank Ramsey, who was too occupied running his three lucrative nursing homes [110] His second choice was Cousy, who declined the invitation, stating that he did not want to coach his former teammates [110] Third choice Tom Heinsohn also said no because he did not think he could handle the often surly Russell, [110] whom he proposed as a player-coach [110] On April 16, 1966, Russell agreed to become head coach of the Celtics, and a public announcement was made two days later [111] Russell became the first black head coach in NBA history, [6] and he commented to journalists: \"I wasn't offered the job because I am a Negro, I was offered it because Red figured I could do it.\" [110]\n\n\nEarnings\nDuring his playing career, Russell was one of the first big earners in NBA basketball His 1956 rookie contract was worth $24,000 (equivalent to $268,965 in 2023), only fractionally smaller than the $25,000 of top earner and teammate Bob Cousy [67] Russell never had to work part-time This was in contrast to other Celtics who had to work during the offseason to maintain their standard of living; Tom Heinsohn sold insurance, Gene Guarilia was a professional guitar player, Cousy ran a basketball camp, and Red Auerbach invested in plastics and a Chinese restaurant [126] When Wilt Chamberlain became the first NBA player to earn $100,000 in salary in 1965 (equivalent to $966,843 in 2023), Russell went to Auerbach and demanded a $100,001 salary, which he promptly received [127] [128] For his promotion to coach, the Celtics paid Russell an annual salary of $25,000 which was in addition to his salary as a player Although the salary was touted in the press as a record for an NBA coach, it is unclear whether Russell's continued $100,001 salary as a player was included in the calculation [129] Russell also had a shoe designed by Bristol Manufacturing Corporation in 1966, the Bill Russell Professional Basketball Shoe [130]\n\n\nRussell–Chamberlain relations\nFor most of his career, Russell and his perennial opponent Wilt Chamberlain were close friends Chamberlain often invited Russell over for Thanksgiving dinner; at Russell's place, conversation mostly concerned Russell's electric trains [131] The close relationship ended after Game 7 of the 1969 NBA Finals, when Chamberlain injured his knee with six minutes left and was forced to leave the game During a conversation with students, a reporter—unknown to Russell—heard Russell describe Chamberlain as a malingerer and accused him of \"copping out\" of the game when it seemed that the Lakers would lose [132] He was livid with Russell and saw him as a backstabber [132]\n\n\nRacist abuse, controversy, and relationship with Boston fans\nRussell's life was marked by an uphill battle against racism and controversial actions and statements in response to racism As a child, he witnessed how his parents were victims of racial abuse, and the family eventually moved into government housing projects to escape the daily torrent of bigotry [20] When he later became a standout college player at USF, Russell recalled how he and his few fellow black teammates were jeered by white students [42]\n\n\nPost-playing career and endeavors\nIn 1971, Russell joined NBA on ABC to do commentary on the Game of the Week [152] His No 6 jersey was retired by the Celtics on March 12, 1972, [153] Russell had worn the same number 6 at the USF and for the 1956 U.S Olympic team [154] He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1975 Russell, who had a difficult relationship with the media, did not attend either ceremony [135] He attended his 2021 induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach [155]\n\n\nAccomplishments and legacy\nRussell is one of the most successful and decorated athletes in North American sports history [9] [46] His awards and achievements include eleven NBA championships with the Boston Celtics in thirteen seasons, [59] two of which were won as player-coach, [182] and he is credited with having raised defensive play in the NBA to a new level [183] By winning the 1956 NCAA championship with USF and the 1957 NBA title with the Celtics, [184] Russell became the first of only five players in basketball history to win an NCAA championship and an NBA championship in back-to-back seasons, the others being Henry Bibby, Magic Johnson, Billy Thompson, and Christian Braun [185] He also won two state championships in high school In the interim, Russell won an Olympic gold medal in 1956 [6] [49] His stint as coach of the Celtics was also of historical significance, [186] [187] as he became the first black head coach in the NBA, [14] when he succeeded Red Auerbach [188] [189]\n\n\nStatue\nIn 2013, Boston honored Russell by erecting a statue of him on City Hall Plaza He is depicted in-game, surrounded by 11 plinths representing the 11 championships he helped the Celtics win [215] Each plinth features a key word and related quote to illustrate Russell's multiple accomplishments The Bill Russell Legacy Foundation, established by the Boston Celtics Shamrock Foundation, funded the project [216] The art is by Ann Hirsch of Somerville, Massachusetts, in collaboration with Pressley Associates Landscape Architects of Boston [217] The statue was unveiled on November 1, 2013, with Russell in attendance [218] [219] [220] During the spring of 2015, two statues of children were added, honoring Russell's commitment to working with children These statues were modeled by a local boy from Somerville and multiple girls from the surrounding area [221]\n\n\nWest Coast Conference's Russell Rule\nOn August 2, 2020, the West Coast Conference (WCC), which has been home to Russell's alma mater of USF since the league's formation in 1952, [222] [c] became the first NCAA Division I conference to adopt a conference-wide diversity hiring commitment, announcing the Russell Rule, named after Russell and based on the National Football League's Rooney Rule In its announcement, the WCC stated: \"The 'Russell Rule' requires each member institution to include a member of a traditionally underrepresented community in the pool of final candidates for every athletic director, senior administrator, head coach and full-time assistant coach position in the athletic department.\" [223]\n\n\nNBA career statistics\nRussell was a resident of Mercer Island, Washington, for nearly five decades [224]\n\n\nRegular season\nRussell was a resident of Mercer Island, Washington, for

marriage lasted until her death in January 2009 [231] Russell was married to Jeannine Russell at the time of his death [232] [233]\n\n\nPersonality\nIn 1966, The New York Times wrote that \"Russell's main characteristics are pride, intelligence, an active and appreciative sense of humor, a preoccupation with dignity, a capacity for consideration once his friendship or sympathy has been aroused, and an unwillingness to compromise whatever truths he has accepted.\" [234] In 2009, Russell wrote his paternal grandfather's motto, passed down to his father and then to him: \"A man has to draw a line inside himself that he won't allow any man to cross.\" Russell said he was \"proud of my grandfather's heroic dignity against forces more powerful than him .. he would not allow himself to be oppressed or intimidated by anyone.\" He wrote these words after recounting how grandfather Jake Russell had stood up to the Ku Klux Klan and other whites who attempted to thwart his efforts to build a schoolhouse for black children; his grandfather was the first person in Russell's patrilineal line born free in North America and was himself illiterate [235] [236] Russell's motto became: \"If you disrespect that line, you disrespect me.\" [237]\n\n\nDeath\nRussell died at his Mercer Island, Washington, home on July 31, 2022, at the age of 88 [14] [238] The news was announced in a Twitter post

Since Russell's previous experiences with white authority figures were often negative, warm words from Powles reassured him. Frank Robinson, a future member of the Baseball Hall of Fame, was one of Russell's high school basketball teammates.\n\n**College Career**\n\nRussell started college at USF in 1952. He averaged 20 points per game on the Dons' freshman basketball team and made his varsity debut on December 1, 1953. He became the starting center for coach Phil Woolpert, who emphasized defense and deliberate half-court play, which favored Russell's exceptional defensive skills. Woolpert's choice of how to deploy his players was unaffected by their skin color. In 1954, Russell became the first coach of a major college basketball program to start three African-American players: K.C. Jones, Hal Perry, and Russell.\n\n**University of San Francisco**\n\nRussell started college at USF in 1952.

Jones, Hal Perry, and Russell.\n\n**Track and Field**\n\nBesides basketball, Russell represented USF in track and field events. He was a standout in the high jump and, according to Track & Field News, was ranked the seventh-best high-jumper in the world in 1956, his graduation year, despite not competing in Olympic high-jump competition. That year, Russell won high jump titles at the Central California Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) meet, the Pacific AAU meet, and the West Coast Relays (WCR). One of his highest jumps occurred at the WCR, where he achieved a mark of 6 feet 9 1/4 inches (2.06 m); at the meet, Russell tied Charlie Dumas, who would later in the year win gold in the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia for the United States and become the first person to high-jump 7 feet (2.13 m).\n\n**1956 Summer Olympics**\n\nBefore his NBA rookie year, Russell was the captain of the 1956 U.S. men's Olympic basketball team that competed at the 1956 Summer Olympics, which was held in November and December in Melbourne, Australia. Avery Brundage, head of the International Olympic Committee, argued that Russell had already signed a professional contract and was no longer an amateur (as nominally required at the time), but Russell prevailed. He had the option to skip the tournament and play a full season for the Celtics, but he was determined to play in the Olympics. He later commented that he would have participated in the high jump if he had been snubbed by the basketball team.\n\n**Professional Career**\n\nThe Harlem Globetrotters invited Russell to join their exhibition basketball squad, but Russell, who was sensitive to racial prejudice, was enraged by the fact that Globetrotters owner Abe Saperstein would only discuss the matter with USF Coach Woolpert, and not Russell. While Saperstein spoke to Woolpert in a meeting, Globetrotters assistant coach Harry Hanna tried to entertain Russell with jokes, but he was livid after this snub and declined the offer. He reasoned that if Saperstein was too smart to speak with him, then he was too smart to play for Saperstein. Russell made himself eligible for the 1956 NBA draft.\n\n**Boston Celtics (1956-1969)**\n\nDue to his Olympic commitment, Russell could not join the Celtics for the 1956-57 NBA season until December. The 1956-57 Boston Celtics season saw the debut of a starting lineup made up of five future Hall-of-Famers: center Russell, forwards Heinsohn and Frank Ramsey, and guards Bill Sharman and Bob Cousy. Russell's first Celtics game came on December 22, 1956, against the St. Louis Hawks. Auerbach assigned him to shut down the Hawks' main scorer, Bob Pettit, and Russell impressed the Boston crowd with his man-to-man defense and shot-blocking.\n\n**1958-1966: Eight straight NBA championships**\n\nIn the 1958-59 NBA season, Russell averaged 16.7 points per game and 23.0 rebounds per game. The Celtics broke a league record by winning 52 games and Russell's strong performance once again helped lead the Celtics through the 1959 NBA playoffs, as they returned to the NBA Finals. In the 1959 NBA Finals, the Celtics recaptured the NBA title, sweeping the Minneapolis Lakers 4-0. Lakers head coach John Kundla praised Russell, stating: \"We don't fear the Celtics without Bill Russell. Take him out and we can beat them... He's the guy who whipped us psychologically.\"\n\n**1966-1969: Player-coach champion and final seasons**\n\nCeltics coach Red Auerbach retired before the 1966-67 NBA season. To coach the Celtics, he had initially wanted his old player Frank Ramsey, who was too occupied running his three lucrative nursing homes. His second choice was Cousy, who declined the invitation, stating that he did not want to coach his former teammates.

This was in contrast to other Celtics who had to work during the offseason to maintain their standard of living; Tom Heinsohn sold insurance, Gene Guarilia was a professional guitar player, Cousy ran a basketball camp, and Red Auerbach invested in plastics and a Chinese restaurant.

The art is by Ann Hirsch of Somerville, Massachusetts, in collaboration with Pressley Associates Landscape Architects of Boston. The statue was unveiled on November 1, 2013, with Russell in attendance.\n\n**West Coast Conference's Russell Rule**\n\nOn August 2, 2020, the West Coast Conference (WCC), which has been home to Russell's alma mater of USF since the league's formation in 1952, became the first NCAA Division I conference to adopt a conference-wide diversity hiring commitment, announcing the Russell Rule, named after Russell and based on the National Football League's Rooney Rule. In its announcement, the WCC stated: \"The 'Russell Rule' requires each member institution to include a member of a traditionally underrepresented community in the pool of final candidates for every athletic director, senior administrator, head coach and full-time assistant coach position in the athletic department.\"\n\n**NBA career statistics**\n\nRussell's NBA career statistics are as follows:\n\n* Regular season:\n\t+ Games: 1,044\n\t+ Points: 14,522 (14.0 points per game)\n\t+ Rebounds: 21,620 (20.7 rebounds per game)\n\t+ Assists: 4,563 (4.4 assists per game)\n\t+ Steals: 2,513 (2.4 steals per game)\n\t+ Blocks: 3,356 (3.2 blocks per game)\n* Playoffs:\n\t+ Games: 164\n\t+ Points: 2,215 (13.5 points per game)\n\t+ Rebounds: 3,572 (21.8 rebounds per game)\n\t+ Assists: 1,045 (6.4 assists per game)\n\t+ Steals: 808 (4.9 steals per game)\n\t+ Blocks: 1,064 (6.5 blocks per game)\n\n**Head coaching record**\n\nRussell's head coaching record is as follows:\n\n* Games: 58\n* Wins: 40\n* Losses: 18\n* Winning percentage: .690\n\n**Personal life and death**\n\nRussell was married three times. His first wife was Rose Swisher, whom he married in 1956 and divorced in 1973. They had three children: Karen, William, and Jacob. Russell's second wife was Dorothy Anstett, whom he married in 1977 and divorced in 1980. His third wife was Marilyn Nault, whom he married in 1996 and remained married to until her death in January 2009.\n\nRussell died on July 31, 2022, at the age of 88.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Bill_Russell\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nWilliam Felton Russell was born on February 12, 1934, to Charles Russell and Katie Russell in West Monroe, Louisiana Like many Southern towns and cities of that time, Monroe was segregated and the Russells often struggled with racism in their daily lives [20] Russell's father was once refused service at a gas station until the staff had taken care of all the white customers first When he attempted to leave and find a different station, the attendant stuck a shotgun in his face and threatened to kill him if he did not stay and wait his turn [20] In another incident, Russell's mother was walking outside in a fancy dress when a white policeman accosted her He told her to go home and remove the dress, which he described as \"white woman's clothing\" [20]\n\n\nFamily\nWilliam Felton Russell was born on February 12, 1934, to Charles Russell and Katie Russell in West Monroe, Louisiana Like many Southern towns and cities of that time, Monroe was segregated and the Russells often struggled with racism in their daily lives [20] Russell's father was once refused service at a gas station until the staff had taken care of all the white customers first When he attempted to leave and find a different station, the attendant stuck a shotgun in his face and threatened to kill him if he did not stay and wait his turn [20] In another incident, Russell's mother was walking outside in a fancy dress when a white policeman accosted her He told her to go home and remove the dress, which he described as \"white woman's clothing\" [20]\n\n\nInitial exposure to basketball\nDuring his early years Russell struggled to develop his skills as a basketball player Although he was a good runner and jumper and had large hands, [21] he did not understand the game and was cut from the team at Herbert Hoover Junior High School As a freshman at McClymonds High School in Oakland, [25] [26] Russell was almost cut again; [27] as he saw Russell's raw athletic potential, coach George Powles encouraged him to work on his fundamentals [21] After Russell was cut from the junior varsity basketball team as a junior in high school, Powles gave him a spot on the varsity team and bought him a yearlong community center membership [28] Since Russell's previous experiences with white authority figures were often negative, warm words from Powles reassured him Frank Robinson, a future member of the Baseball Hall of Fame, was one of Russell's high school basketball teammates [29]\n\n\nCollege career\nRussell started college at USF in 1952 [34] He averaged 20 points per game on the Dons’ freshman basketball team, [35] and made his varsity debut on December 1, 1953 [36] He became the starting center for coach Phil Woolpert, who  emphasized defense and deliberate half-court play, which favored Russell's exceptional defensive skills [37] Woolpert's choice of how to deploy his players was unaffected by their skin color In 1954, he became the first coach of a major college basketball program to start three African-American players: K C Jones, Hal Perry, and Russell [5] In his USF years, Russell took advantage of his relative lack of bulk to guard other players than the opposing center: using his quickness and speed, he would double-up on forwards and aggressively challenge their shots [37] Russell played on USF's varsity team from 1953 to 1956 [38]\n\n\nUniversity of San Francisco\nRussell started college at USF in 1952 [34] He averaged 20 points per game on the Dons’ freshman basketball team, [35] and made his varsity debut on December 1, 1953 [36] He became the starting center for coach Phil Woolpert, who  emphasized defense and deliberate half-court play, which favored Russell's exceptional defensive skills [37] Woolpert's choice of how to deploy his players was unaffected by their skin color In 1954, he became the first coach of a major college basketball program to start three African-American players: K C Jones, Hal Perry, and Russell [5] In his USF years, Russell took advantage of his relative lack of bulk to guard other players than the opposing center: using his quickness and speed, he would double-up on forwards and aggressively challenge their shots [37] Russell played on USF's varsity team from 1953 to 1956 [38]\n\n\nBasketball\nRussell started college at USF in 1952 [34] He averaged 20 points per game on the Dons’ freshman basketball team, [35] and made his varsity debut on December 1, 1953 [36] He became the starting center for coach Phil Woolpert, who  emphasized defense and deliberate half-court play, which favored Russell's exceptional defensive skills [37] Woolpert's choice of how to deploy his players was unaffected by their skin color In 1954, he became the first coach of a major college basketball program to start three African-American players: K C Jones, Hal Perry, and Russell [5] In his USF years, Russell took advantage of his relative lack of bulk to guard other players than the opposing center: using his quickness and speed, he would double-up on forwards and aggressively challenge their shots [37] Russell played on USF's varsity team from 1953 to 1956 [38]\n\n\nTrack and field\nBesides basketball, Russell represented USF in track and field events He was a standout in the high jump and according to Track & Field News was ranked the seventh-best high-jumper in the world in 1956, his graduation year, despite not competing in Olympic high-jump competition [22] [50] That year, Russell won high jump titles at the Central California Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) meet, the Pacific AAU meet, and the West Coast Relays (WCR) One of his highest jumps occurred at the WCR, where he achieved a mark of 6 feet 9+1⁄4 inches (2.06 m); [51] at the meet, Russell tied Charlie Dumas, who would later in the year win gold in the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia for the United States and become the first person to high-jump 7 feet (2.13 m) [52] this was all before the Fosbury Flop was introduced, with which all high jump world records after 1978 have been set [53] [54] [55] He also competed in the 440 yards (402.3 m) race, which he could complete in 49.6 seconds [56]\n\n\n1956 Summer Olympics\nBefore his NBA rookie year, Russell was the captain of the 1956 U.S men's Olympic basketball team that competed at the 1956 Summer Olympics, [57] which was held in November and December in Melbourne, Australia Avery Brundage, head of the International Olympic Committee, argued that Russell had already signed a professional contract and was no longer an amateur (as nominally required at the time), but Russell prevailed [58] He had the option to skip the tournament and play a full season for the Celtics, but he was determined to play in the Olympics He later commented that he would have participated in the high jump if he had been snubbed by the basketball team [22]\n\n\nProfessional career\nThe Harlem Globetrotters invited Russell to join their exhibition basketball squad, but Russell, who was sensitive to racial prejudice, was enraged by the fact that Globetrotters owner Abe Saperstein would only discuss the matter with USF Coach Woolpert, and not Russell While Saperstein spoke to Woolpert in a meeting, Globetrotters assistant coach Harry Hanna tried to entertain Russell with jokes, but he was livid after this snub and declined the offer He reasoned that if Saperstein was too smart to speak with him, then he was too smart to play for Saperstein Russell made himself eligible for the 1956 NBA draft [62]\n\n\nBoston Celtics (1956–1969)\nDue to his Olympic commitment, Russell could not join the Celtics for the 1956–57 NBA season until December [65] The 1956–57 Boston Celtics season saw the debut of a starting lineup made up of five future Hall-of-Famers: center Russell, forwards Heinsohn and Frank Ramsey, and guards Bill Sharman and Bob Cousy [66] Russell's first Celtics game came on December 22, 1956, against the St Louis Hawks [67] Auerbach assigned him to shut down the Hawks' main scorer, Bob Pettit, and Russell impressed the Boston crowd with his man-to-man defense and shot-blocking [67] In previous years, the Celtics had been a high-scoring team but lacked the defensive presence needed to close out tight games With the added defensive presence of Russell, the Celtics had laid the foundation for a dynasty, as the team utilized a strong defensive approach to the game, forcing opposing teams to commit many turnovers, which led to many easy points on fast breaks [67]\n\n\n1956–1958: Rookie champion and early years\nDue to his Olympic commitment, Russell could not join the Celtics for the 1956–57 NBA season until December [65] The 1956–57 Boston Celtics season saw the debut of a starting lineup made up of five future Hall-of-Famers: center Russell, forwards Heinsohn and Frank Ramsey, and guards Bill Sharman and Bob Cousy [66] Russell's first Celtics game came on December 22, 1956, against the St Louis Hawks [67] Auerbach assigned him to shut down the Hawks' main scorer, Bob Pettit, and Russell impressed the Boston crowd with his man-to-man defense and shot-blocking [67] In previous years, the Celtics had been a high-scoring team but lacked the defensive presence needed to close out tight games With the added defensive presence of Russell, the Celtics had laid the foundation for a dynasty, as the team utilized a strong defensive approach to the game, forcing opposing teams to commit many turnovers, which led to many easy points on fast breaks [67]\n\n\n1958–1966: Eight straight NBA championships\nIn the 1958–59 NBA season, Russell averaged 16.7 points per game and 23.0 rebounds per game [1] The Celtics broke a league record by winning 52 games and Russell's strong performance once again helped lead the Celtics through the 1959 NBA playoffs, as they returned to the NBA Finals In the 1959 NBA Finals, the Celtics recaptured the NBA title, sweeping the Minneapolis Lakers 4–0 [77] Lakers head coach John Kundla praised Russell, stating: \"We don't fear the Celtics without Bill Russell Take him out and we can beat them .. He's the guy who whipped us psychologically.\" [63]\n\n\n1966–1969: Player-coach champion and final seasons\nCeltics coach Red Auerbach retired before the 1966–67 NBA season To coach the Celtics, he had initially wanted his old player Frank Ramsey, who was too occupied running his three lucrative nursing homes [110] His second choice was Cousy, who declined the invitation, stating that he did not want to coach his former teammates [110] Third choice Tom Heinsohn also said no because he did not think he could handle the often surly Russell, [110] whom he proposed as a player-coach [110] On April 16, 1966, Russell agreed to become head coach of the Celtics, and a public announcement was made two days later [111] Russell became the first black head coach in NBA history, [6] and he commented to journalists: \"I wasn't offered the job because I am a Negro, I was offered it because Red figured I could do it.\" [110]\n\n\nEarnings\nDuring his playing career, Russell was one of the first big earners in NBA basketball His 1956 rookie contract was worth $24,000 (equivalent to $268,965 in 2023), only fractionally smaller than the $25,000 of top earner and teammate Bob Cousy [67] Russell never had to work part-time This was in contrast to other Celtics who had to work during the offseason to maintain their standard of living; Tom Heinsohn sold insurance, Gene Guarilia was a professional guitar player, Cousy ran a basketball camp, and Red Auerbach invested in plastics and a Chinese restaurant [126] When Wilt Chamberlain became the first NBA player to earn $100,000 in salary in 1965 (equivalent to $966,843 in 2023), Russell went to Auerbach and demanded a $100,001 salary, which he promptly received [127] [128] For his promotion to coach, the Celtics paid Russell an annual salary of $25,000 which was in addition to his salary as a player Although the salary was touted in the press as a record for an NBA coach, it is unclear whether Russell's continued $100,001 salary as a player was included in the calculation [129] Russell also had a shoe designed by Bristol Manufacturing Corporation in 1966, the Bill Russell Professional Basketball Shoe [130]\n\n\nRussell–Chamberlain relations\nFor most of his career, Russell and his perennial opponent Wilt Chamberlain were close friends Chamberlain often invited Russell over for Thanksgiving dinner; at Russell's place, conversation mostly concerned Russell's electric trains [131] The close relationship ended after Game 7 of the 1969 NBA Finals, when Chamberlain injured his knee with six minutes left and was forced to leave the game During a conversation with students, a reporter—unknown to Russell—heard Russell describe Chamberlain as a malingerer and accused him of \"copping out\" of the game when it seemed that the Lakers would lose [132] He was livid with Russell and saw him as a backstabber [132]\n\n\nRacist abuse, controversy, and relationship with Boston fans\nRussell's life was marked by an uphill battle against racism and controversial actions and statements in response to racism As a child, he witnessed how his parents were victims of racial abuse, and the family eventually moved into government housing projects to escape the daily torrent of bigotry [20] When he later became a standout college player at USF, Russell recalled how he and his few fellow black teammates were jeered by white students [42]\n\n\nPost-playing career and endeavors\nIn 1971, Russell joined NBA on ABC to do commentary on the Game of the Week [152] His No 6 jersey was retired by the Celtics on March 12, 1972, [153] Russell had worn the same number 6 at the USF and for the 1956 U.S Olympic team [154] He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1975 Russell, who had a difficult relationship with the media, did not attend either ceremony [135] He attended his 2021 induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach [155]\n\n\nAccomplishments and legacy\nRussell is one of the most successful and decorated athletes in North American sports history [9] [46] His awards and achievements include eleven NBA championships with the Boston Celtics in thirteen seasons, [59] two of which were won as player-coach, [182] and he is credited with having raised defensive play in the NBA to a new level [183] By winning the 1956 NCAA championship with USF and the 1957 NBA title with the Celtics, [184] Russell became the first of only five players in basketball history to win an NCAA championship and an NBA championship in back-to-back seasons, the others being Henry Bibby, Magic Johnson, Billy Thompson, and Christian Braun [185] He also won two state championships in high school In the interim, Russell won an Olympic gold medal in 1956 [6] [49] His stint as coach of the Celtics was also of historical significance, [186] [187] as he became the first black head coach in the NBA, [14] when he succeeded Red Auerbach [188] [189]\n\n\nStatue\nIn 2013, Boston honored Russell by erecting a statue of him on City Hall Plaza He is depicted in-game, surrounded by 11 plinths representing the 11 championships he helped the Celtics win [215] Each plinth features a key word and related quote to illustrate Russell's multiple accomplishments The Bill Russell Legacy Foundation, established by the Boston Celtics Shamrock Foundation, funded the project [216] The art is by Ann Hirsch of Somerville, Massachusetts, in collaboration with Pressley Associates Landscape Architects of Boston [217] The statue was unveiled on November 1, 2013, with Russell in attendance [218] [219] [220] During the spring of 2015, two statues of children were added, honoring Russell's commitment to working with children These statues were modeled by a local boy from Somerville and multiple girls from the surrounding area [221]\n\n\nWest Coast Conference's Russell Rule\nOn August 2, 2020, the West Coast Conference (WCC), which has been home to Russell's alma mater of USF since the league's formation in 1952, [222] [c] became the first NCAA Division I conference to adopt a conference-wide diversity hiring commitment, announcing the Russell Rule, named after Russell and based on the National Football League's Rooney Rule In its announcement, the WCC stated: \"The 'Russell Rule' requires each member institution to include a member of a traditionally underrepresented community in the pool of final candidates for every athletic director, senior administrator, head coach and full-time assistant coach position in the athletic department.\"

married to his college sweetheart Rose Swisher from 1956 to 1973 They had three children: daughter Karen Russell, a television pundit and lawyer, and sons William Jr and Jacob The couple grew emotionally distant and divorced [228] In 1977, he married Dorothy Anstett, Miss USA of 1968; [228] they divorced in 1980 [229] In 1996, Russell married his third wife, Marilyn Nault; [230] their marriage lasted until her death in January 2009 [231] Russell was married to Jeannine Russell at the time of his death [232] [233]\n\n\nPersonality\nIn 1966, The New York Times wrote that \"Russell's main characteristics are pride, intelligence, an active and appreciative sense of humor, a preoccupation with dignity, a capacity for consideration once his friendship or sympathy has been aroused, and an unwillingness to compromise whatever truths he has accepted.\" [234] In 2009, Russell wrote his paternal grandfather's motto, passed down to his father and then to him: \"A man has to draw a line inside himself that he won't allow any man to cross.\" Russell said he was \"proud of my grandfather's heroic dignity against forces more powerful than him .. he would not allow himself to be oppressed or intimidated by anyone.\" He wrote these words after recounting how grandfather Jake Russell had stood up to the Ku Klux Klan and other whites who attempted to thwart his efforts to build a schoolhouse for black children; his grandfather was the first person in Russell's patrilineal line born free in North America and was himself illiterate [235] [236] Russell's motto became: \"If you disrespect that line, you disrespect me.\" [237]\n\n\nDeath\nRussell died at his Mercer Island, Washington, home on July 31, 2022, at the age of 88 [14] [238] The news was announced in a Twitter post by his family In a statement, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said that Russell was \"the greatest champion in all of team sports\" [239]\n\n\nSelected publications\n# denotes interim head

Hollywood [14] Jones and his father did not get to know each other until the 1950s, when they reconciled He said in interviews that his parents were both of mixed African-American, Irish, and Native

the risk of pregnancy can also occur without the penis being near the vagina because sperm may be transported to the vaginal opening by the vagina coming in contact with fingers or other non-genital body parts that have come in contact with semen [86] [87]\n\n\nPrevalence\nPenile–vaginal penetration is the most common form of sexual intercourse [2] [20] Studies indicate that most heterosexual couples engage in vaginal intercourse nearly every sexual encounter [20] The National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior (NSSHB) reported in 2010 that vaginal intercourse is \"the most prevalent sexual behavior among men and women of all ages and ethnicities\" [20] Clint E Bruess et al stated that it \"is the most frequently studied behavior\" and is \"often the focus of sexuality education programming for youth.\" [95] Weiten et al said that it \"is the most widely endorsed and practiced sexual act in our society.\" [40]\n\n\nAge at first intercourse\nThe prevalence of sexual intercourse has been compared cross-culturally In 2003, Michael Bozon of the French Institut national d'études démographiques conducted a cross-cultural study titled \"At what age do women and men have their first sexual intercourse?\" In the first group of the contemporary cultures he studied, which included sub-Saharan Africa (listing Mali, Senegal and Ethiopia), the data indicated that the age of men at sexual initiation in these societies is at later ages than that of women, but is often extra-marital; the study considered the Indian subcontinent to also fall into this group, though data was only available from Nepal [96] [97]\n\n\nHealth effects\nIn humans, sexual intercourse and sexual activity in general have been reported as having health benefits as varied as increased immunity by increasing the body's production of antibodies and subsequent lower blood pressure, [101] [102] and decreased risk of prostate cancer [101] Sexual intimacy and orgasms increase levels of the hormone oxytocin (also known as \"the love hormone\"), which can help people bond and build trust [102] [103] Oxytocin is believed to have a more significant impact on women than on men, which may be why women associate sexual attraction or sexual activity with romance and love more than men do [6] A long-term study of 3,500 people between ages 18 and 102 by clinical neuropsychologist David Weeks indicated that, based on impartial ratings of the subjects' photographs, sex on a regular basis is associated with people looking significantly chronologically younger However this does not imply causality [104]\n\n\nBenefits\nIn humans, sexual intercourse and sexual activity in general have been reported as having health benefits as varied as increased immunity by increasing the body's production of antibodies and subsequent lower blood pressure, [101] [102] and decreased risk of prostate cancer [101] Sexual intimacy and orgasms increase levels of the hormone oxytocin (also known as \"the love hormone\"), which can help people bond and build trust [102] [103] Oxytocin is believed to have a more significant impact on women than on men, which may be why women associate sexual attraction or sexual activity with romance and love more than men do [6] A long-term study of 3,500 people between ages 18 and 102 by clinical neuropsychologist David Weeks indicated that, based on impartial ratings of the subjects' photographs, sex on a regular basis is associated with people looking significantly chronologically younger However this does not imply causality [104]\n\n\nRisks\nSexually transmitted infections (STIs) are bacteria, viruses or parasites that are spread by sexual contact, especially vaginal, anal, or oral intercourse, or unprotected sex [106] [107] Oral sex is less risky than vaginal or anal intercourse [108] Many times, STIs initially do not cause symptoms, increasing the risk of unknowingly passing the infection on to a sex partner or others [109] [110]\n\n\nDuration and genital complications\nSexual intercourse, when involving a male participant, often ends when the male has ejaculated, and thus the partner might not have time to reach orgasm [127] In addition, premature ejaculation (PE) is common, and women often require a substantially longer duration of stimulation with a sexual partner than men do before reaching an orgasm [52] [128] [129] Scholars, such as Weiten et al., state that \"many couples are locked into the idea that orgasms should be achieved only through intercourse  [penile-vaginal sex],\" that \"the word foreplay suggests that any other form of sexual stimulation is merely preparation for the 'main event'\" and that \"because women reach orgasm through intercourse less consistently than men,\" they are likelier than men to fake an orgasm to satisfy their sexual partners [52]\n\n\nDisabilities and other complications\nObstacles that those with disabilities face with regard to engaging in sexual intercourse include pain, depression, fatigue, negative body image, stiffness, functional impairment, anxiety, reduced libido, hormonal imbalance, and drug treatment or side effects Sexual functioning has been regularly identified as a neglected area of the quality of life in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [150] For those that must take opioids for pain control, sexual intercourse can become more difficult [151] Having a stroke can also largely impact on the ability to engage in sexual intercourse [152] Although disability-related pain, including as a result of cancer, and mobility impairment can hamper sexual intercourse, in many cases, the most significant impediments to sexual intercourse for individuals with a disability are psychological [153] In particular, people who have a disability can find sexual intercourse daunting due to issues involving their self-concept as a sexual being, or a partner's discomfort or perceived discomfort [153] Temporary difficulties can arise with alcohol and sex, as alcohol can initially increase interest through disinhibition but decrease capacity with greater intake; however, disinhibition can vary depending on the culture [154] [155]\n\n\nSocial effects\nSexual intercourse may be for reproductive, relational, or recreational purposes [158] It often plays a strong role in human bonding [6] In many societies, it is normal for couples to have sexual intercourse while using some method of birth control, sharing pleasure and strengthening their emotional bond through sexual activity even though they are deliberately avoiding pregnancy [6]\n\n\nAdults\nSexual intercourse may be for reproductive, relational, or recreational purposes [158] It often plays a strong role in human bonding [6] In many societies, it is normal for couples to have sexual intercourse while using some method of birth control, sharing pleasure and strengthening their emotional bond through sexual activity even though they are deliberately avoiding pregnancy [6]\n\n\nAdolescents\nAdolescents commonly use sexual intercourse for relational and recreational purposes, which may negatively or positively impact their lives For example, while teenage pregnancy may be welcomed in some cultures, it is also commonly disparaged, and research suggests that the earlier onset of puberty for children puts pressure on children and teenagers to act like adults before they are emotionally or cognitively ready [168] Some studies have concluded that engaging in sexual intercourse leaves adolescents, especially girls, with higher levels of stress and depression, and that girls may be likelier to engage in sexual risk (such as sexual intercourse without the use of a condom), [169] [170] but it may be that further research is needed in these areas [170] In some countries, such as the United States, sex education and abstinence-only sex education curricula are available to educate adolescents about sexual activity; these programs are controversial, as debate exists as to whether teaching children and adolescents about sexual intercourse or other sexual activity should only be left up to parents or other caregivers [171]\n\n\nEthical, religious, and legal views\nWhile sexual intercourse, as coitus, is the natural mode of reproduction for the human species, humans have intricate moral and ethical guidelines which regulate the practice of sexual intercourse and vary according to religious and governmental laws Some governments and religions also have strict designations of what they consider appropriate and inappropriate sexual behavior, which include restrictions on the types of sex acts which are permissible A historically prohibited or regulated sex act is anal sex [180] [181]\n\n\nGeneral\nWhile sexual intercourse, as coitus, is the natural mode of reproduction for the human species, humans have intricate moral and ethical guidelines which regulate the practice of sexual intercourse and vary according to religious and governmental laws Some governments and religions also have strict designations of what they consider appropriate and inappropriate sexual behavior, which include restrictions on the types of sex acts which are permissible A historically prohibited or regulated sex act is anal sex [180] [181]\n\n\nSexual offenses\nSexual intercourse with a person against their will, or without their consent, is rape, but may also be called sexual assault; it is considered a serious crime in most countries [182] [183] More than 90% of rape victims are female, 99% of rapists male, and only about 5% of rapists are strangers to the victims [183]\n\n\nRomantic relationships\nSexual intercourse has traditionally been considered an essential part of a marriage, with many religious customs requiring consummation of the marriage and citing marriage as the most appropriate union for sexual reproduction (procreation) [197] In such cases, a failure for any reason to consummate the marriage would be considered a ground for annulment (which does not require a divorce process) Sexual relations between marriage partners have been a \"marital right\" in various societies and religions, both historically and in modern times, especially with regard to a husband's rights to his wife [198] [199] [200] Until the late 20th century, there was usually a marital exemption in rape laws which precluded a husband from being prosecuted under the rape law for forced sex with his wife [201] Author Oshisanya, 'lai Oshitokunbo stated, \"As the legal status of women has changed, the concept of a married man's or woman's marital right to sexual intercourse has become less widely held.\" [202]\n\n\nMarriage and relationships\nSexual intercourse has traditionally been considered an essential part of a marriage, with many religious customs requiring consummation of the marriage and citing marriage as the most appropriate union for sexual reproduction (procreation) [197] In such cases, a failure for any reason to consummate the marriage would be considered a ground for annulment (which does not require a divorce process) Sexual relations between marriage partners have been a \"marital right\" in various societies and religions, both historically and in modern times, especially with regard to a husband's rights to his wife [198] [199] [200] Until the late 20th century, there was usually a marital exemption in rape laws which precluded a husband from being prosecuted under the rape law for forced sex with his wife [201] Author Oshisanya, 'lai Oshitokunbo stated, \"As the legal status of women has changed, the concept of a married man's or woman's marital right to sexual intercourse has become less widely held.\" [202]\n\n\nReligious views\nThere are wide differences in religious views with regard to sexual intercourse in or outside of marriage:\n\n\nOther animals\nIn zoology, copulation often means the process in which a male introduces sperm into the female's body, especially directly into her reproductive tract [15] [24] Spiders have separate male and female sexes Before mating and copulation, the male spider spins a small web and ejaculates on it He then stores the sperm in reservoirs on his large pedipalps, from which he transfers sperm to the female's genitals The females can store sperm indefinitely [244]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Sexual Intercourse**\n\nSexual intercourse, also known as coitus, copulation, or intercourse, is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that plays a vital role in human reproduction, relationships, and overall well-being. It is a universal aspect of human experience, yet its meanings, purposes, and practices vary greatly across cultures, societies, and individuals.\n\n**Behaviors**\n\nSexual intercourse may be called coitus, copulation, coition, or intercourse. Coitus is derived from the Latin word coitio or coire, meaning \"a coming together or joining together\" or \"to go together,\" and is known under different ancient Latin names for a variety of sexual activities, but usually denotes penile-vaginal penetration. This is often called vaginal intercourse or vaginal sex. Vaginal sex, and less often vaginal intercourse, may also denote any vaginal sexual activity, particularly if penetrative, including sexual activity between lesbian couples. Copulation, by contrast, more often denotes the mating process, especially for non-human animals; it can mean a variety of sexual activities between opposite-sex or same-sex pairings, but generally means the sexually reproductive act of transferring sperm from a male to a female or sexual procreation between a man and a woman.\n\n**Definitions**\n\nSexual intercourse may be called coitus, copulation, coition, or intercourse.

Foreplay may precede some sexual activities, often leading to sexual arousal of the partners and resulting in the erection of the penis or natural lubrication of the vagina. It is also common for people to be as sexually satisfied by being kissed, touched erotically, or held as they are during sexual intercourse.\n\n**Reproduction**\n\nNatural human reproduction involves penile-vaginal penetration, during which semen, containing male gametes known as sperm cells or spermatozoa, is ejaculated through the penis into the vagina. The sperm passes through the vaginal vault, cervix, and into the uterus, and then into the fallopian tubes. Millions of sperm are ejaculated to increase the chances of fertilization (see sperm competition), but only one is sufficient to fertilize an egg or ovum. When a fertile ovum from the female is present in the fallopian tubes, the male gamete fertilizes the ovum, forming a new embryo. Pregnancy begins after the fertilized ovum is implanted in the lining of the uterus (the endometrium).\n\n**Safe Sex and Birth Control**\n\nThere are a variety of safe sex methods that are practiced by heterosexual and same-sex couples, including non-penetrative sex acts. Heterosexual couples may use oral or anal sex (or both) as a means of birth control. However, pregnancy can still occur with anal sex or other forms of sexual activity if the penis is near the vagina (such as during intercrural sex or other genital-genital rubbing) and its sperm is deposited near the vagina's entrance and travels along the vagina's lubricating fluids. The risk of pregnancy can also occur without the penis being near the vagina because sperm may be transported to the vaginal opening by the vagina coming in contact with fingers or other non-genital body parts that have come in contact with semen.\n\n**Prevalence**\n\nPenile-vaginal penetration is the most common form of sexual intercourse. Studies indicate that most heterosexual couples engage in vaginal intercourse nearly every sexual encounter. The National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior (NSSHB) reported in 2010 that vaginal intercourse is \"the most prevalent sexual behavior among men and women of all ages and ethnicities.\" Clint E. Bruess et al stated that it \"is the most frequently studied behavior\" and is \"often the focus of sexuality education programming for youth.\" Weiten et al said that it \"is the most widely endorsed and practiced sexual act in our society.\"\n\n**Age at First Intercourse**\n\nThe prevalence of sexual intercourse has been compared cross-culturally. In 2003, Michael Bozon of the French Institut national d'études démographiques conducted a cross-cultural study titled \"At what age do women and men have their first sexual intercourse?\" In the first group of the contemporary cultures he studied, which included sub-Saharan Africa (listing Mali, Senegal, and Ethiopia), the data indicated that the age of men at sexual initiation in these societies is at later ages than that of women, but is often extra-marital. The study considered the Indian subcontinent to also fall into this group, though data was only available from Nepal.\n\n**Health Effects**\n\nIn humans, sexual intercourse and sexual activity in general have been reported as having health benefits as varied as increased immunity by increasing the body's production of antibodies and subsequent lower blood pressure, and decreased risk of prostate cancer. Sexual intimacy and orgasms increase levels of the hormone oxytocin (also known as \"the love hormone\"), which can help people bond and build trust. Oxytocin is believed to have a more significant impact on women than on men, which may be why women associate sexual attraction or sexual activity with romance and love more than men do. A long-term study of 3,500 people between ages 18 and 102 by clinical neuropsychologist David Weeks indicated that, based on impartial ratings of the subjects' photographs, sex on a regular basis is associated with people looking significantly chronologically younger. However, this does not imply causality.\n\n**Benefits**\n\nIn humans, sexual intercourse and sexual activity in general have been reported as having health benefits as varied as increased immunity by increasing the body's production of antibodies and subsequent lower blood pressure, and decreased risk of prostate cancer.

However, this does not imply causality.\n\n**Risks**\n\nSexually transmitted infections (STIs) are bacteria, viruses, or parasites that are spread by sexual contact, especially vaginal, anal, or oral intercourse, or unprotected sex. Oral sex is less risky than vaginal or anal intercourse. Many times, STIs initially do not cause symptoms, increasing the risk of unknowingly passing the infection on to a sex partner or others.\n\n**Duration and Genital Complications**\n\nSexual intercourse, when involving a male participant, often ends when the male has ejaculated, and thus the partner might not have time to reach orgasm. In addition, premature ejaculation (PE) is common, and women often require a substantially longer duration of stimulation with a sexual partner than men do before reaching an orgasm. Scholars, such as Weiten et al., state that \"many couples are locked into the idea that orgasms should be achieved only through intercourse (penile-vaginal sex),\" that \"the word foreplay suggests that any other form of sexual stimulation is merely preparation for the 'main event'\" and that \"because women reach orgasm through intercourse less consistently than men,\" they are likelier than men to fake an orgasm to satisfy their sexual partners.\n\n**Disabilities and Other Complications**\n\nObstacles that those with disabilities face with regard to engaging in sexual intercourse include pain, depression, fatigue, negative body image, stiffness, functional impairment, anxiety, reduced libido, hormonal imbalance, and drug treatment or side effects. Sexual functioning has been regularly identified as a neglected area of the quality of life in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. For those that must take opioids for pain control, sexual intercourse can become more difficult. Having a stroke can also largely impact on the ability to engage in sexual intercourse. Although disability-related pain, including as a result of cancer, and mobility impairment can hamper sexual intercourse, in many cases, the most significant impediments to sexual intercourse for individuals with a disability are psychological. In particular, people who have a disability can find sexual intercourse daunting due to issues involving their self-concept as a sexual being, or a partner's discomfort or perceived discomfort. Temporary difficulties can arise with alcohol and sex, as alcohol can initially increase interest through disinhibition but decrease capacity with greater intake; however, disinhibition can vary depending on the culture.\n\n**Social Effects**\n\nSexual intercourse may be for reproductive, relational, or recreational purposes. It often plays a strong role in human bonding. In many societies, it is normal for couples to have sexual intercourse while using some method of birth control, sharing pleasure and strengthening their emotional bond through sexual activity even though they are deliberately avoiding pregnancy.\n\n**Adults**\n\nSexual intercourse may be for reproductive, relational, or recreational purposes. It often plays a strong role in human bonding. In many societies, it is normal for couples to have sexual intercourse while using some method of birth control, sharing pleasure and strengthening their emotional bond through sexual activity even though they are deliberately avoiding pregnancy.\n\n**Adolescents**\n\nAdolescents commonly use sexual intercourse for relational and recreational purposes, which may negatively or positively impact their lives. For example, while teenage pregnancy may be welcomed in some cultures, it is also commonly disparaged, and research suggests that the earlier onset of puberty for children puts pressure on children and teenagers to act like adults before they are emotionally or cognitively ready. Some studies have concluded that engaging in sexual intercourse leaves adolescents, especially girls, with higher levels of stress and depression, and that girls may be likelier to engage in sexual risk (such as sexual intercourse without the use of a condom).

Some governments and religions also have strict designations of what they consider appropriate and inappropriate sexual behavior, which include restrictions on the types of sex acts which are permissible. A historically prohibited or regulated sex act is anal sex.\n\n**Other Animals**\n\nIn zoology, copulation often means the process in which a male introduces sperm into the female's body, especially directly into her reproductive tract. Spiders have separate male and female sexes. Before mating and copulation, the male spider spins a small web and ejaculates on it. He then stores the sperm in reservoirs on his large pedipalps, from which he transfers sperm to the female's genitals. The females can store sperm indefinitely.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Sexual_intercourse\" following this outline:\n\n\nBehaviors\nSexual intercourse may be called coitus, copulation, coition, or intercourse Coitus is derived from the Latin word coitio or coire, meaning \"a coming together or joining together\" or \"to go together\", and is known under different ancient Latin names for a variety of sexual activities, but usually denotes penile–vaginal penetration [19] This is often called vaginal intercourse or vaginal sex [2] [20] Vaginal sex, and less often vaginal intercourse, may also denote any vaginal sexual activity, particularly if penetrative, including sexual activity between lesbian couples [21] [22] Copulation, by contrast, more often denotes the mating process, especially for non-human animals;

the study considered the Indian subcontinent to also fall into this group, though data was only available from Nepal [96] [97]\n\n\nHealth effects\nIn humans, sexual intercourse and sexual activity in general have been reported as having health benefits as varied as increased immunity by increasing the body's production of antibodies and subsequent lower blood pressure, [101] [102] and decreased risk of prostate cancer [101] Sexual intimacy and orgasms increase levels of the hormone oxytocin (also known as \"the love hormone\"), which can help people bond and build trust [102] [103] Oxytocin is believed to have a more significant impact on women than on men, which may be why women associate sexual attraction or sexual activity with romance and love more than men do [6] A long-term study of 3,500 people between ages 18 and 102 by clinical neuropsychologist David Weeks indicated that, based on impartial ratings of the subjects' photographs, sex on a regular basis is associated with people looking significantly chronologically younger However this does not imply causality [104]\n\n\nBenefits\nIn humans, sexual intercourse and sexual activity in general have been reported as having health benefits as varied as increased immunity by increasing the body's production of antibodies and subsequent lower blood pressure, [101] [102] and decreased risk of prostate cancer [101] Sexual intimacy and orgasms increase levels of the hormone oxytocin (also known as \"the love hormone\"), which can help people bond and build trust [102] [103] Oxytocin is believed to have a more significant impact on women than on men, which may be why women associate sexual attraction or sexual activity with romance and love more than men do [6] A long-term study of 3,500 people between ages 18 and 102 by clinical neuropsychologist David Weeks indicated that, based on impartial ratings of the subjects' photographs, sex on a regular basis is associated with people looking significantly chronologically younger However this does not imply causality [104]\n\n\nRisks\nSexually transmitted infections (STIs) are bacteria, viruses or parasites that are spread by sexual contact, especially vaginal, anal, or oral intercourse, or unprotected sex [106] [107] Oral sex is less risky than vaginal or anal intercourse [108] Many times, STIs initially do not cause symptoms, increasing the risk of unknowingly passing the infection on to a sex partner or others [109] [110]\n\n\nDuration and genital complications\nSexual intercourse, when involving a male participant, often ends when the male has ejaculated, and thus the partner might not have time to reach orgasm [127] In addition, premature ejaculation (PE) is common, and women often require a substantially longer duration of stimulation with a sexual partner than men do before reaching an orgasm [52] [128] [129] Scholars, such as Weiten et al., state that \"many couples are locked into the idea that orgasms should be achieved only through intercourse  [penile-vaginal sex],\" that \"the word foreplay suggests that any other form of sexual stimulation is merely preparation for the 'main event'\" and that \"because women reach orgasm through intercourse less consistently than men,\" they are likelier than men to fake an orgasm to satisfy their sexual partners [52]\n\n\nDisabilities and other complications\nObstacles that those with disabilities face with regard to engaging in sexual intercourse include pain, depression, fatigue, negative body image, stiffness, functional impairment, anxiety, reduced libido, hormonal imbalance, and drug treatment or side effects Sexual functioning has been regularly identified as a neglected area of the quality of life in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [150] For those that must take opioids for pain control, sexual intercourse can become more difficult [151] Having a stroke can also largely impact on the ability to engage in sexual intercourse [152] Although disability-related pain, including as a result of cancer, and mobility impairment can hamper sexual intercourse, in many cases, the most significant impediments to sexual intercourse for individuals with a disability are psychological [153] In particular, people who have a disability can find sexual intercourse daunting due to issues involving their self-concept as a sexual being, or a partner's discomfort or perceived discomfort [153] Temporary difficulties can arise with alcohol and sex, as alcohol can initially increase interest through disinhibition but decrease capacity with greater intake; however, disinhibition can vary depending on the culture [154] [155]\n\n\nSocial effects\nSexual intercourse may be for reproductive, relational, or recreational purposes [158] It often plays a strong role in human bonding [6] In many societies, it is normal for couples to have sexual intercourse while using some method of birth control, sharing pleasure and strengthening their emotional bond through sexual activity even though they are deliberately avoiding pregnancy [6]\n\n\nAdults\nSexual intercourse may be for reproductive, relational, or recreational purposes [158] It often plays a strong role in human bonding [6] In many societies, it is normal for couples to have sexual intercourse while using some method of birth control, sharing pleasure and strengthening their emotional bond through sexual activity even though they are deliberately avoiding pregnancy [6]\n\n\nAdolescents\nAdolescents commonly use sexual intercourse for relational and recreational purposes, which may negatively or positively impact their lives For example, while teenage pregnancy may be welcomed in some cultures, it is also commonly disparaged, and research suggests that the earlier onset of puberty for children puts pressure on children and teenagers to act like adults before they are emotionally or cognitively ready [168] Some studies have concluded that engaging in sexual intercourse leaves adolescents, especially girls, with higher levels of stress and depression, and that girls may be likelier to engage in sexual risk (such as sexual intercourse without the use of a condom), [169] [170] but it may be that further research is needed in these areas [170] In some countries, such as the United States, sex education and abstinence-only sex education curricula are available to educate adolescents about sexual activity; these programs are controversial, as debate exists as to whether teaching children and adolescents about sexual intercourse or other sexual activity should only be left up to parents or other caregivers [171]\n\n\nEthical, religious, and legal views\nWhile sexual intercourse, as coitus, is the natural mode of reproduction for the human species, humans have intricate moral and ethical guidelines which regulate the practice of sexual intercourse and vary according to religious and governmental laws Some governments and religions also have strict designations of what they consider appropriate and inappropriate sexual behavior, which include restrictions on the types of sex acts which are permissible A historically prohibited or regulated sex act is anal sex [180] [181]\n\n\nGeneral\nWhile sexual intercourse, as coitus, is the natural mode of reproduction for the human species, humans have intricate moral and ethical guidelines which regulate the practice of sexual intercourse and vary according to religious and governmental laws Some governments and religions also have strict designations of what they consider appropriate and inappropriate sexual behavior, which include restrictions on the types of sex acts which are permissible A historically prohibited or regulated sex act is anal sex [180] [181]\n\n\nSexual offenses\nSexual intercourse with a person against their will, or without their consent, is rape, but may also be called sexual assault; it is considered a serious crime in most countries [182] [183] More than 90% of rape victims are female, 99% of rapists male, and only about 5% of rapists are strangers to the victims [183]\n\n\nRomantic relationships\nSexual intercourse has traditionally been considered an essential part of a marriage, with many religious customs requiring consummation of the marriage and citing marriage as the most appropriate union for sexual reproduction (procreation) [197] In such cases, a failure for any reason to consummate the marriage would be considered a ground for annulment (which does not require a divorce process) Sexual relations between marriage partners have been a \"marital right\" in various societies and religions, both historically and in modern times, especially with regard to a husband's rights to his wife [198] [199] [200] Until the late 20th century, there was usually a marital exemption in rape laws which precluded a husband from being prosecuted under the rape law for forced sex with his wife [201] Author Oshisanya, 'lai Oshitokunbo stated, \"As the legal status of women has changed, the concept of a married man's or woman's marital right to sexual intercourse has become less widely held.\" [202]\n\n\nMarriage and relationships\nSexual intercourse has traditionally been considered an essential part of a marriage, with many religious customs requiring consummation of the marriage and citing marriage as the most appropriate union for sexual reproduction (procreation) [197] In such cases, a failure for any reason to consummate the marriage would be considered a ground for annulment (which does not require a divorce process) Sexual relations between marriage partners have been a \"marital right\" in various societies and religions, both historically and in modern times, especially with regard to a husband's rights to his wife [198] [199] [200] Until the late 20th century, there was usually a marital exemption in rape laws which precluded a husband from being prosecuted under the rape law for forced sex with his wife [201] Author Oshisanya, 'lai Oshitokunbo stated, \"As the legal status of women has changed, the concept of a married man's or woman's marital right to sexual intercourse has become less widely held.\" [202]\n\n\nReligious views\nThere are wide differences in religious views with regard to sexual intercourse in or outside of marriage:\n\n\nOther animals\nIn zoology, copulation often means the process in which a male introduces sperm into the female's body, especially directly into her reproductive tract [15] [24] Spiders have separate male and female sexes Before mating and copulation, the male spider spins a small web and ejaculates on it He then stores the sperm in reservoirs on his large pedipalps, from which he transfers sperm to the female's genitals The females can store sperm indefinitely [244]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Zandt**\n\nSteven Van Zandt is a American musician, singer, songwriter, record producer, and actor, best known as the guitarist and backing vocalist for Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nBorn Steven Lento on November 22, 1950, in Winthrop, Massachusetts, Van Zandt was raised in Watertown, Massachusetts. He has Italian ancestry, with one grandfather from Calabria and one grandmother's parents from Naples.\n\n**Career**\n\nVan Zandt grew up in the Jersey Shore music scene, where he met Bruce Springsteen at the Hullabaloo club in Middletown, New Jersey. The two first met when Springsteen was performing and heard Van Zandt was playing \"Happy Together\" with the Shadows. They later performed together in bands such as Steel Mill and the Bruce Springsteen Band.\n\n**Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes**\n\nVan Zandt co-founded Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes, along with the Miami Horns, who got their name from Van Zandt's nickname. He helped establish the rhythm and blues-oriented style of music that the band performed. Van Zandt also produced Southside Johnny's first three albums, writing the bulk of the group's music and contributing substantially to its success.\n\n**E Street Band**\n\nVan Zandt started to switch between writing for Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes and touring with the E Street Band. He confirmed in an interview on The Howard Stern Show that he arranged the horns on \"Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out\" in 1975 when Springsteen was at a loss, earning him a spot in the E Street Band shortly thereafter. In the Wings For Wheels documentary, Springsteen revealed that Van Zandt was partially responsible for the signature guitar line in \"Born to Run,\" described as \"Arguably Steve's greatest contribution to my music.\" Ultimately, Van Zandt officially joined the E Street Band on July 20, 1975, during the first show of the Born to Run Tour.\n\n**Songwriter, Arranger, Producer**\n\nVan Zandt became a songwriter and producer for fellow Jersey shore act Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes in 1974, penning their signature song \"I Don't Want to Go Home,\" co-writing other songs for them with Springsteen, and producing their most-acclaimed record, Hearts of Stone. As such, Van Zandt became a key contributor to the Jersey Shore sound. He also produced two Gary U.S Bonds albums. Van Zandt then went on to share production credits on the classic Springsteen albums The River and Born in the U.S.A. The first Springsteen song he co-produced was \"Hungry Heart.\" In 1989, Jackson Browne covered the 1983 Van Zandt composition \"I Am A Patriot\" on his World in Motion album.\n\n**Solo Artist**\n\nDuring the summer of 1981, EMI-America approached Van Zandt with a record deal due to his success with the E Street Band, Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes, and Gary U.S Bonds. He began fronting an on-and-off group known as Little Steven and the Disciples of Soul, while Springsteen was working on Nebraska. The band included Dino Danelli on drums, Jean Beauvoir on bass, and the Miami Horns. They made their live debut at the Peppermint Lounge on July 18, 1982. In October 1982, Van Zandt's debut album, Men Without Women, was released. This album earned the most critical praise and Jay Cocks of TIME magazine dubbed it one of the ten best albums of the year. Van Zandt released four more solo albums, and has written that these albums are each elements in a five-part political concept cycle: the individual, the family, the state, the economy, and religion.\n\n**Actor**\n\nUntil 1999, Van Zandt had no professional acting experience. His main focus had been music, whether it was the multiple bands he participated in, groups he composed pieces for, or music he wrote on his own. Then, he was asked to play a part in The Sopranos, and from there on, acting became part of Van Zandt's career.\n\n**The Sopranos**\n\nIn 1999, Van Zandt took one of the lead roles in The Sopranos, playing level-headed but deadly mob consigliere and strip club owner Silvio Dante. The casting choice was made by series creator David Chase, who invited Van Zandt to audition after seeing him induct The Rascals at the 1997 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and being impressed with his humorous appearance and presence. Though Van Zandt had never acted before, he auditioned for the role of Tony Soprano HBO felt that the role should go to an experienced actor, however, so Chase wrote a part especially for Van Zandt. Van Zandt eventually agreed to star on the show as Silvio Dante, and his real-life spouse Maureen (née Santoro) was cast as his on-screen wife Gabriella.\n\n**Tussles in Brussels**\n\nVan Zandt recorded the narration for The Hives biography on their concert DVD Tussles in Brussels (2004).\n\n**Hotel Cæsar**\n\nIn 2010, Van Zandt appeared as himself in the Norwegian soap opera Hotel Cæsar, broadcast on Norway's biggest commercial channel TV2 Norway. He also appeared on Scandinavia's largest talkshow Skavlan.\n\n**Lilyhammer**\n\nIn 2011, he starred in, co-wrote, and was the executive producer for an English and Norwegian language series entitled Lilyhammer, the first original Netflix series that was produced in collaboration with Norwegian broadcaster NRK. The name recalls the city of Lillehammer, which hosted the 1994 Winter Olympics. On the show, Van Zandt portrays a Sopranos-like role of an ex-mafioso who enters the witness protection program and flees to Norway to escape a colleague against whom he testified. The show premiered on NRK television on January 25, 2012, with an audience of 998,000 viewers (one fifth of Norway's population), and ran for three seasons before being cancelled in 2015.\n\n**The Irishman**\n\nVan Zandt appears in the Martin Scorsese-produced gangster epic The Irishman as singer Jerry Vale, lip-syncing Vale's Al Di La.\n\n**Radio Host and Entrepreneur**\n\nSince 2002, Van Zandt has hosted Little Steven's Underground Garage, a weekly syndicated radio show that celebrates garage rock and similar rock subgenres from the 1950s to the present day. As of December 2006, the show is heard on over 200 US radio stations and in some international markets.

Additionally, the founding clubs would collectively receive €3.5 billion to support infrastructure investments and offset the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic [38]\n\n\nReception\nThe formation of the ESL led to widespread condemnation from UEFA, The Football Association and Premier League of England, the Italian Football Federation and Lega Serie A of Italy, and the Royal Spanish Football Federation and La Liga of Spain All governing bodies issued a joint statement declaring their intention to prevent the new competition from proceeding any further, with UEFA warning that any clubs involved in the Super League would be banned from all other domestic, European and world football competitions, [63] and that players from the clubs involved would also be banned from representing their national teams in international matches [63] [64] In addition, the French Football Federation and Ligue de Football Professionnel of France, the German Football Association and Deutsche Fußball Liga of Germany, as well as the Russian Premier League and Russian Football Union released similar statements opposing the proposal [65] [66] [67] [68]\n\n\nFootball governing bodies\nThe formation of the ESL led to widespread condemnation from UEFA, The Football Association and Premier League of England, the Italian Football Federation and Lega Serie A of Italy, and the Royal Spanish Football Federation and La Liga of Spain All governing bodies issued a joint statement declaring their intention to prevent the new competition from proceeding any further, with UEFA warning that any clubs involved in the Super League would be banned from all other domestic, European and world football competitions, [63] and that players from the clubs involved would also be banned from representing their national teams in international matches [63] [64] In addition, the French Football Federation and Ligue de Football Professionnel of France, the German Football Association and Deutsche Fußball Liga of Germany, as well as the Russian Premier League and Russian Football Union released similar statements opposing the proposal [65] [66] [67] [68]\n\n\nUninvolved clubs\nBayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, and Paris Saint-Germain were sought out by the ESL to join; Bayern and Borussia were given 30 days, and PSG 14 days, to sign up to the Super League, [78] [79] but all three rejected involvement in the competition, publicly condemning the concept [80] [81] Pérez alleged that the three clubs had not been invited [40] Other French, [82] German, [82] [83] [77] Portuguese, [84] Italian, [85] and Dutch clubs were reported to have declined to join the competition [77] West Ham United said on their website that they were strongly opposed to the Super League, emphasising their working-class roots and the 150 academy players who had developed to play for the first team [86] In a statement, Everton criticised the Big Six English clubs joining the Super League and accused them of \"betraying\" British football supporters [87] Leeds United also referred to Liverpool on social media as \"Merseyside Reds\", referencing the unlicenced name used for the club in the Pro Evolution Soccer video game series [88] Before a game between the clubs on 19 April, Leeds players warmed up in t-shirts condemning the competition, featuring the UEFA Champions League logo alongside the caption 'earn it' on the front, and 'football is for the fans' on the back [89] The shirts had been left on the benches inside the Liverpool changing room, but the players did not wear them [90] Atalanta, Cagliari, and Hellas Verona reportedly called for the Italian Super League teams to be banned from Serie A; Hellas Verona denied in a statement having requested such a ban alongside Atalanta and Cagliari [91]\n\n\nPoliticians and governments\nNumerous politicians expressed their opposition to the proposals across Europe, the most prominent coming from the British government, with the objections to the ESL uniting political parties completely behind its prevention British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the proposals \"very damaging for football\" and vowed to ensure that it \"doesn't go ahead in the way that it's currently being proposed\", [94] a position which was supported by Leader of the Opposition Keir Starmer [95] In addition, the Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said in a statement to the House of Commons that \"this move goes against the very spirit of the game\", and pledged to do \"whatever it takes\" to stop English clubs from joining [96]\n\n\nIndividual commentary\nDespite claims that the ESL would be the \"most significant restructuring of elite European football since the creation of the European Cup\" and that claims of negative impacts from it were similar to the founding of the Premier League in 1992, [100] [101] [102] commentators had contrasting opinions Although they noted that the new competition would eliminate financial risk for its founding members by operating on a semi-closed league setup similar to basketball's EuroLeague, which would also eliminate the risk of clubs failing to qualify or being relegated and give these clubs a stable source of revenue and increased value, they also noted it had serious issues [103] [104]\n\n\nMedia companies\nUK broadcaster BT Sport, one of the networks that hold the rights to the Champions League and the Premier League, condemned the European Super League and said that it \"could have a damaging effect on the long-term health of football in the United Kingdom\", [129] whilst its competitor Sky reiterated that it has not held talks to broadcast the league [130] Amazon Prime Video, which owns streaming rights to the Premier League in the UK, stated they had no involvement [131] DAZN confirmed they were not \"in any way involved or interested in entering into discussions regarding the establishment of a Super League and no conversations have taken place.\" [132] [133] Facebook, Inc also denied involvement in broadcasting discussions [134]\n\n\nFan feedback\nFootball Supporters Europe (FSE), a body representing supporters in 45 UEFA countries, issued a statement opposing the creation of the Super League [119] A snap YouGov poll conducted shortly after the league's announcement found that 79% of British football fans oppose the Super League with only 14% expressing support; 76% of fans of the British teams joining the Super League also expressed disapproval, with 20% expressing support [136] International fans of the clubs involved as well as international football fans who did not support a particular club were largely supportive of the Super League [137] Many football fans criticised Tottenham Hotspur's inclusion, as the team has not won a trophy since the 2008 Football League Cup Final [138] Barcelona fans hung a banner over Camp Nou which read \"Barcelona is our life, not your toy No to playing in the Super League.\" [139]\n\n\nAftermath\nOn 19 April 2021, Aleksander Čeferin stated that UEFA would begin making \"legal assessments\" on the following day, and that the organisation would look to ban the twelve Super League clubs \"as soon as possible.\" However, the Super League informed UEFA and FIFA that they had begun legal action to prevent the competition from being thwarted [146] Jesper Møller, chairman of the Danish Football Association and UEFA Executive Committee member, stated that he expected the three Super League clubs in the semi-finals of the 2020–21 UEFA Champions League (Chelsea, Manchester City, and Real Madrid) to be expelled from the competition by 23 April In addition, he also expected Arsenal and Manchester United to be expelled from the semi-finals of the 2020–21 UEFA Europa League [147] In response, Super League chairman Florentino Pérez said that this would be \"impossible\" and that the law protects them [148] [149] On 20 April, ESPN reported that UEFA decided to not ban the Super League teams from the Champions League and Europa League, and the matches would proceed as scheduled [150]\n\n\nLegal issues\nOn 19 April 2021, Aleksander Čeferin stated that UEFA would begin making \"legal assessments\" on the following day, and that the organisation would look to ban the twelve Super League clubs \"as soon as possible.\" However, the Super League informed UEFA and FIFA that they had begun legal action to prevent the competition from being thwarted [146] Jesper Møller, chairman of the Danish Football Association and UEFA Executive Committee member, stated that he expected the three Super League clubs in the semi-finals of the 2020–21 UEFA Champions League (Chelsea, Manchester City, and Real Madrid) to be expelled from the competition by 23 April In addition, he also expected Arsenal and Manchester United to be expelled from the semi-finals of the 2020–21 UEFA Europa League [147] In response, Super League chairman Florentino Pérez said that this would be \"impossible\" and that the law protects them [148] [149] On 20 April, ESPN reported that UEFA decided to not ban the Super League teams from the Champions League and Europa League, and the matches would proceed as scheduled [150]\n\n\nMajor changes\nSpearheaded by Florentino Pérez of Real Madrid and Andrea Agnelli of Juventus, the Super League was in the works for three years; however, the final phases were rushed, and allegiance among the twelve clubs, instead of the fifteen as originally planned, seemed to have been forged under pressure The announcement was unexpectedly poorly planned, devoid of real content, and the coalition, liable to break under pressure, came apart quickly [170]\n\n\nClub responses\nAfter the English clubs withdrew on 21 April, the Super League stated: \"Given the current circumstances, we shall reconsider the most appropriate steps to reshape the project, always having in mind our goals of offering fans the best experience possible while enhancing solidarity payments for the entire football community.\" [183] Andrea Agnelli blamed the failure on Brexit, [184] and stated that it was unlikely the Super League project would proceed in its current form, although he remained convinced of the \"beauty of the project.\" [174] [185] Pérez reiterated that none of the founding clubs had officially left the association, [186] as they were tied to binding contracts, [187] and vowed to work with the governing bodies to make some form of the Super League work Whilst blaming the English clubs for losing their nerve in the face of opposition and the footballing authorities for acting unjustifiably aggressively, [188] Pérez insisted that the Super League project was merely on standby and not over [189] Barcelona president Joan Laporta echoed Pérez's sentiments that a Super League remains \"absolutely necessary\" for clubs to survive [190]\n\n\nConsequences\nWhilst the opposition from fans in Spain remained subdued, [170] the supporters of the Premier League clubs, Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United, and Tottenham Hotspur, called on their owners to divest their investments Supporters of Manchester City were the first to withdraw from the ESL, thus gaining, according to reports, [203] \"brownie points\" among their supporters [197] A few observers, such as Emlyon Business School professor of Eurasian Sport Simon Chadwick, deemed fan opposition of their respective clubs, which acted in self-preservation and with intentions to grow their investments, as naïve, simplistic, and misplaced [204]\n\n\nFan protests\nFollowing the collapse of the European Super League, many fan groups in England continued protesting against the ownership of certain clubs and for the introduction of the 50+1 rule seen in German football The first of these protests occurred on 19 April when fans of Manchester City and Manchester United held protests at the City of Manchester Stadium and Old Trafford, with both sets of fans unveiling banners and flags [234] On 22 April, a day after the Super League's suspension; a group of around twenty Manchester United fans gained access to the club's Trafford Training Centre in Carrington for over two hours demanding the Glazers sell the club [235]\n\n\nRevival project\nOn 19 October 2022, A22 Sports Management, the Spain-based company that \"sponsor [s]\" and \"assist [s]\" in \"the creation of the European Super League,\" [251] appointed as chief executive officer Bernd Reichart, formerly the CEO of German broadcaster RTL [252] The same day, Reichart claimed the European Super League \"would be relaunched within three years.\" [253] He added that European football is \"becoming unsustainable\" under the \"current system.\" [254] After claiming that \"European club-football is not living up to its potential\", he stated that \"permanent membership is off the table\" and, instead, the \"stakeholders\" should discuss \"an open competition based on sporting merit.\" [255] [256] UEFA responded that they had received a letter from A22 and \"will consider the request for a meeting in due course,\" while the management of the Premier League directed interested parties to its 9 June 2021 statement, jointly signed with the FA, in which it was acknowledged that their member-clubs' actions to participate in a Super League were a \"mistake\" and, therefore, \"the matter\" has been brought \"to a conclusion.\" [256] [257]\n\n\nEuropean Court of Justice decision\nOn 21 December 2023, the European Court of Justice issued decision C-333/21 according to which FIFA and UEFA rules on prior approval of interclub football competitions, such as the Super League, are contrary to European Union law [17] [264] A report released in December 2022 by the ECJ found that the rules of football's European and world governing bodies were \"compatible with EU competition law\" [265]\n\n\nFootball Governance Bill\nIn the King's speech on 17 July 2024, the British government announced plans for a \"Football Governance Bill\", which will, amongst other things, prevent English and Welsh clubs from \"joining closed-shop, breakaway or unlicensed\nleagues, such as the European Super League\" [266]\n\n\nClub-by-club chronology\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**European Super League (association football)**\n\nThe European Super League (ESL) is a proposed professional association football competition that would have featured a permanent membership system, where a select group of top European clubs would compete against each other in a regular season, with the top teams qualifying for the Champions League and the Europa League. The ESL was announced on April 18, 2021, but its plans were met with widespread opposition from UEFA, the Premier League, and other governing bodies, leading to its eventual collapse.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe idea of a pan-European club competition has been discussed for decades, with the first proposal dating back to 1968. However, it wasn't until the 1970s and 1980s that the concept gained more traction. In the 1990s, the UEFA Champions League was rebranded as the top-tier competition, and the ESL's proposal was seen as an attempt to create a more exclusive and lucrative tournament.\n\n**Concept**\n\nThe ESL would have featured a permanent membership system, where 15 top European clubs would compete against each other in a regular season. The top teams would qualify for the Champions League and the Europa League, while the bottom teams would be relegated to lower divisions. The ESL would have also introduced a new format for the Champions League and the Europa League, with the top teams from each league competing in a separate tournament.\n\n**Leadership**\n\nThe ESL was led by Florentino Pérez, the president of Real Madrid, and Andrea Agnelli, the president of Juventus.

however, the final phases were rushed, and allegiance among the twelve clubs, instead of the fifteen as originally planned, seemed to have been forged under pressure The announcement was unexpectedly poorly planned, devoid of real content, and the coalition, liable to break under pressure, came apart quickly [170]\n\n\nClub responses\nAfter the English clubs withdrew on 21 April, the Super League stated: \"Given the current circumstances, we shall reconsider the most appropriate steps to reshape the project, always having in mind our goals of offering fans the best experience possible while enhancing solidarity payments for the entire football community.\" [183] Andrea Agnelli blamed the failure on Brexit, [184] and stated that it was unlikely the Super League project would proceed in its current form, although he remained convinced of the \"beauty of the project.\" [174] [185] Pérez reiterated that none of the founding clubs had officially left the association, [186] as they were tied to binding contracts, [187] and vowed to work with the governing bodies to make some form of the Super League work Whilst blaming the English clubs for losing their nerve in the face of opposition and the footballing authorities for acting unjustifiably aggressively, [188] Pérez insisted that the Super League project was merely on standby and not over [189] Barcelona president Joan Laporta echoed Pérez's sentiments that a Super League remains \"absolutely necessary\" for clubs to survive [190]\n\n\nConsequences\nWhilst the opposition from fans in Spain remained subdued, [170] the supporters of the Premier League clubs, Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United, and Tottenham Hotspur, called on their owners to divest their investments Supporters of Manchester City were the first to withdraw from the ESL, thus gaining, according to reports, [203] \"brownie points\" among their supporters [197] A few observers, such as Emlyon Business School professor of Eurasian Sport Simon Chadwick, deemed fan opposition of their respective clubs, which acted in self-preservation and with intentions to grow their investments, as naïve, simplistic, and misplaced [204]\n\n\nFan protests\nFollowing the collapse of the European Super League, many fan groups in England continued protesting against the ownership of certain clubs and for the introduction of the 50+1 rule seen in German football The first of these protests occurred on 19 April when fans of Manchester City and Manchester United held protests at the City of Manchester Stadium and Old Trafford, with both sets of fans unveiling banners and flags [234] On 22 April, a day after the Super League's suspension; a group of around twenty Manchester United fans gained access to the club's Trafford Training Centre in Carrington for over two hours demanding the Glazers sell the club [235]\n\n\nRevival project\nOn 19 October 2022, A22 Sports Management, the Spain-based company that \"sponsor [s]\" and \"assist [s]\" in \"the creation of the European Super League,\" [251] appointed as chief executive officer Bernd Reichart, formerly the CEO of German broadcaster RTL [252] The same day, Reichart claimed the European Super League \"would be relaunched within three years.\" [253] He added that European football is \"becoming unsustainable\" under the \"current system.\" [254] After claiming that \"European club-football is not living up to its potential\", he stated that \"permanent membership is off the table\" and, instead, the \"stakeholders\" should discuss \"an open competition based on sporting merit.\" [255] [256] UEFA responded that they had received a letter from A22 and \"will consider the request for a meeting in due course,\" while the management of the Premier League directed interested parties to its 9 June 2021 statement, jointly signed with the FA, in which it was acknowledged that their member-clubs' actions to participate in a Super League were a \"mistake\" and, therefore, \"the matter\" has been brought \"to a conclusion.\" [256] [257]\n\n\nEuropean Court of Justice decision\nOn 21 December 2023, the European Court of Justice issued decision C-333/21 according to which FIFA and UEFA rules on prior approval of interclub football competitions, such as the Super League, are contrary to European Union law [17] [264] A report released in December 2022 by the ECJ found that the rules of football's European and world governing bodies were \"compatible with EU competition law\" [265]\n\n\nFootball Governance Bill\nIn the King's speech on 17 July 2024, the British government announced plans for a \"Football Governance Bill\", which will, amongst other things, prevent English and Welsh clubs from \"joining closed-shop, breakaway or unlicensed\nleagues, such as the European Super League\" [266]\n\n\nClub-by-club chronology\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

as part of The New York Times's online endeavors, editors now write their content in Scoop and send their work to CCI for print publication Since its introduction, Scoop has superseded several processes within the Times, including print edition planning and collaboration, and features tools such as multimedia integration, notifications, content tagging, and drafts The New York Times uses private articles for high-profile opinion pieces, such as those written by Russian president Vladimir Putin and actress Angelina Jolie, and for high-level investigations [240] In January 2012, the Times released Integrated Content Editor (ICE), a revision tracking tool for WordPress and TinyMCE ICE is integrated within the Times's workflow by providing a unified text editor for print and online editors, reducing the divide between print and online operations [241]\n\n\nStyle and design\nSince 1895, The New York Times has maintained a manual of style in several forms The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage was published on the Times's intranet in 1999 [246]\n\n\nStyle guide\nSince 1895, The New York Times has maintained a manual of style in several forms The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage was published on the Times's intranet in 1999 [246]\n\n\nHeadlines\nJournalists for The New York Times do not write their own headlines, but rather copy editors who specifically write headlines The Times's guidelines insist headline editors get to the main point of an article but avoid giving away endings, if present Other guidelines include using slang \"sparingly\", avoiding tabloid headlines, not ending a line on a preposition, article, or adjective, and chiefly, not to pun The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage states that wordplay, such as \"Rubber Industry Bounces Back\", is to be tested on a colleague as a canary is to be tested in a coal mine; \"when no song bursts forth, start rewriting\" [261] The New York Times has amended headlines due to controversy In 2019, following two back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, the Times used the headline, \"Trump Urges Unity vs Racism\", to describe then-president Donald Trump's words after the shootings After criticism from FiveThirtyEight founder Nate Silver, the headline was changed to, \"Assailing Hate But Not Guns\" [262]\n\n\nNameplate\nThe nameplate of The New York Times has been unaltered since 1967 In creating the initial nameplate, Henry Jarvis Raymond sought to model The London Times, which used a Blackletter style called Textura, popularized following the fall of the Western Roman Empire and regional variations of Alcuin's script, as well as a period With the change to The New-York Times on September 14, 1857, the nameplate followed Under George Jones, the terminals of the \"N\", \"r\", and \"s\" were intentionally exaggerated into swashes The nameplate in the January 15, 1894, issue trimmed the terminals once more, smoothed the edges, and turned the stem supporting the \"T\" into an ornament The hyphen was dropped on December 1, 1896, after Adolph Ochs purchased the paper The descender of the \"h\" was shortened on December 30, 1914 The largest change to the nameplate was introduced on February 21, 1967, when type designer Ed Benguiat redesigned the logo, most prominently turning the arrow ornament into a diamond Notoriously, the new logo dropped the period that remained with the Times up until that point; one reader compared the omission of the period to \"performing plastic surgery on Helen of Troy.\" Picture editor John Radosta worked with a New York University professor to determine that dropping the period saved the paper US$41.28 (equivalent to $377.21 in 2023) [265]\n\n\nPrint edition\nAs of December 2023, The New York Times has printed sixty thousand issues, a statistic represented in the paper's masthead to the right of the volume number, the Times's years in publication written in Roman numerals [266] The volume and issues are separated by four dots representing the edition number of that issue;

\"when no song bursts forth, start rewriting\" [261] The New York Times has amended headlines due to controversy In 2019, following two back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, the Times used the headline, \"Trump Urges Unity vs Racism\", to describe then-president Donald Trump's words after the shootings After criticism from FiveThirtyEight founder Nate Silver, the headline was changed to, \"Assailing Hate But Not Guns\" [262]\n\n\nNameplate\nThe nameplate of The New York Times has been unaltered since 1967 In creating the initial nameplate, Henry Jarvis Raymond sought to model The London Times, which used a Blackletter style called Textura, popularized following the fall of the Western Roman Empire and regional variations of Alcuin's script, as well as a period With the change to The New-York Times on September 14, 1857, the nameplate followed Under George Jones, the terminals of the \"N\", \"r\", and \"s\" were intentionally exaggerated into swashes The nameplate in the January 15, 1894, issue trimmed the terminals once more, smoothed the edges, and turned the stem supporting the \"T\" into an ornament The hyphen was dropped on December 1, 1896, after Adolph Ochs purchased the paper The descender of the \"h\" was shortened on December 30, 1914 The largest change to the nameplate was introduced on February 21, 1967, when type designer Ed Benguiat redesigned the logo, most prominently turning the arrow ornament into a diamond Notoriously, the new logo dropped the period that remained with the Times up until that point; one reader compared the omission of the period to \"performing plastic surgery on Helen of Troy.\" Picture editor John Radosta worked with a New York University professor to determine that dropping the period saved the paper US$41.28 (equivalent to $377.21 in 2023) [265]\n\n\nPrint edition\nAs of December 2023, The New York Times has printed sixty thousand issues, a statistic represented in the paper's masthead to the right of the volume number, the Times's years in publication written in Roman numerals [266] The volume and issues are separated by four dots representing the edition number of that issue;

{"title": "Wales", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe English words \"Wales\" and \"Welsh\" derive from the same Old English root (singular Wealh, plural Wēalas), a descendant of Proto-Germanic *Walhaz, which was itself derived from the name of the Gauls known to the Romans as Volcae This term was later used to refer indiscriminately to inhabitants of the Western Roman Empire [14] Anglo-Saxons came to use the term to refer to the Britons in particular; the plural form Wēalas evolved into the name for their territory, Wales [15] [16] Historically in Britain, the words were not restricted to modern Wales or to the Welsh but were used to refer to anything that Anglo-Saxons associated with Britons, including other non-Germanic territories in Britain (e.g Cornwall) and places in Anglo-Saxon territory associated with Britons (e.g Walworth in County Durham and Walton in West Yorkshire) [17]\n\n\nHistory\nWales has been inhabited by modern humans for at least 29,000 years [22] Continuous human habitation dates from the end of the last ice age, between 12,000 and 10,000 years before present (BP), when Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from Central Europe began to migrate to Great Britain At that time, sea levels were much lower than today Wales was free of glaciers by about 10,250 BP, the warmer climate allowing the area to become heavily wooded The post-glacial rise in sea level separated Wales and Ireland, forming the Irish Sea By 8,000 BP the British Peninsula had become an island [23] By the beginning of the Neolithic (c. 6,000 BP) sea levels in the Bristol Channel were still about 33 feet (10 metres) lower than today [24] The historian John Davies theorised that the story of Cantre'r Gwaelod's drowning and tales in the Mabinogion, of the waters between Wales and Ireland being narrower and shallower, may be distant folk memories of this time [25]\n\n\nPrehistoric origins\nWales has been inhabited by modern humans for at least 29,000 years [22] Continuous human habitation dates from the end of the last ice age, between 12,000 and 10,000 years before present (BP), when Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from Central Europe began to migrate to Great Britain At that time, sea levels were much lower than today Wales was free of glaciers by about 10,250 BP, the warmer climate allowing the area to become heavily wooded The post-glacial rise in sea level separated Wales and Ireland, forming the Irish Sea By 8,000 BP the British Peninsula had become an island [23] By the beginning of the Neolithic (c. 6,000 BP) sea levels in the Bristol Channel were still about 33 feet (10 metres) lower than today [24] The historian John Davies theorised that the story of Cantre'r Gwaelod's drowning and tales in the Mabinogion, of the waters between Wales and Ireland being narrower and shallower, may be distant folk memories of this time [25]\n\n\nRoman era\nThe Roman conquest of Wales began in AD 48 and took 30 years to complete; the occupation lasted over 300 years The campaigns of conquest were opposed by two native tribes: the Silures and the Ordovices Caractacus or Caradog, leader of the Ordovices, had initial success in resisting Roman invasions of north Wales but was eventually defeated [31] [32] Roman rule in Wales was a military occupation, save for the southern coastal region of south Wales, where there is a legacy of Romanisation [33] The only town in Wales founded by the Romans, Caerwent, is in south east Wales [34] Both Caerwent and Carmarthen, also in southern Wales, became Roman civitates [35] Wales had a rich mineral wealth The Romans used their engineering technology to extract large amounts of gold, copper, and lead, as well as lesser amounts of zinc and silver [36] No significant industries were located in Wales in this time; [36] this was largely a matter of circumstance as Wales had none of the necessary materials in suitable combination, and the forested, mountainous countryside was not amenable to industrialisation Latin became the official language of Wales, though the people continued to speak in Brythonic While Romanisation was far from complete, the upper classes came to consider themselves Roman, particularly after the ruling of 212 that granted Roman citizenship to all free men throughout the Empire [37] Further Roman influence came through the spread of Christianity, which gained many followers when Christians were allowed to worship freely; state persecution ceased in the 4th century, as a result of Constantine the Great issuing an edict of toleration in 313 [37]\n\n\nPost-Roman era\nThe 400-year period following the collapse of Roman rule is the most difficult to interpret in the history of Wales [37] After the Roman departure in AD 410, much of the lowlands of Britain to the east and south-east was overrun by various Germanic peoples, commonly known as Anglo-Saxons Some have theorized that the cultural dominance of the Anglo-Saxons was due to apartheid-like social conditions in which the Britons were at a disadvantage [42]\nBy AD 500 the land that would become Wales had divided into a number of kingdoms free from Anglo-Saxon rule [37] The kingdoms of Gwynedd, Powys, Dyfed, Caredigion, Morgannwg, the Ystrad Tywi, and Gwent emerged as independent Welsh successor states [37] Archaeological evidence, in the Low Countries and what was to become England, shows early Anglo-Saxon migration to Great Britain reversed between 500 and 550, which concurs with Frankish chronicles [43] John Davies notes this as consistent with a victory for the Celtic Britons at Badon Hill against the Saxons, which was attributed to Arthur by Nennius [43]\n\n\nHigh to late middle ages\nGruffydd ap Llywelyn was the only ruler to unite all of Wales under his rule, described by one chronicler after his death as king of Wales In 1055 Gruffydd ap Llywelyn killed his rival Gruffydd ap Rhydderch in battle and recaptured Deheubarth [54] Originally king of Gwynedd, by 1057 he was ruler of Wales and had annexed parts of England around the border He ruled Wales with no internal battles [55] His territories were again divided into the traditional kingdoms [56] John Davies states that Gruffydd was \"the only Welsh king ever to rule over the entire territory of Wales.. Thus, from about 1057 until his death in 1063, the whole of Wales recognised the kingship of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn For about seven brief years, Wales was one, under one ruler, a feat with neither precedent nor successor.\" [3] Owain Gwynedd (1100–1170) of the Aberffraw line was the first Welsh ruler to use the title princeps Wallensium (prince of the Welsh), a title of substance given his victory on the Berwyn range, according to Davies [57] During this time, between 1053 and 1063, Wales lacked any internal strife and was at peace [58]\n\n\nEarly modern period\nIn 1536 Wales had around 278,000 inhabitants, which increased to around 360,000 by 1620 This was primarily due to rural settlement, where animal farming was central to the Welsh economy Increase in trade and increased economic stability occurred due to the increased diversity of the Welsh economy Population growth however outpaced economic growth and the standard of living dropped [77]\n\n\nModern period\nHistorian Kenneth Morgan described Wales on the eve of the First World War as a \"relatively placid, self-confident and successful nation\" The output from the coalfields continued to increase, with the Rhondda Valley recording a peak of 9.6 million tons of coal extracted in 1913 [83] The First World War (1914–1918) saw a total of 272,924 Welshmen under arms, representing 21.5 per cent of the male population Of these, roughly 35,000 were killed, [84] with particularly heavy losses of Welsh forces at Mametz Wood on the Somme and the Battle of Passchendaele [85]\n\n\nDevolution\nThe Welsh Language Act 1967 repealed a section of the Wales and Berwick Act and thus \"Wales\" was no longer part of the legal definition of England This essentially defined Wales as a separate entity legally (but within the UK), for the first time since before the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 which defined Wales as a part of the Kingdom of England The Welsh Language Act 1967 also expanded areas where use of Welsh was permitted, including in some legal situations [102] [103]\n\n\nWelsh language\nThe Welsh language (Welsh: Cymraeg) is an Indo-European language of the Celtic family; [108] the most closely related languages are Cornish and Breton Most linguists believe that the Celtic languages arrived in Britain around 600 BCE [109] The Brythonic languages ceased to be spoken in England and were replaced by the English language, a Germanic language which arrived in Wales around the end of the eighth century due to the defeat of the Kingdom of Powys [110]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nWales is a country that is part of the sovereign state of the United Kingdom [13] ISO 3166-2:GB formerly defined Wales as a principality, with England and Scotland defined as countries and Northern Ireland as a province [117] However, this definition was raised in the Welsh Assembly in 2010 and the then Counsel General for Wales, John Griffiths, stated, 'Principality is a misnomer and that Wales should properly be referred to as a country.' [118] In 2011, ISO 3166-2:GB was updated and the term 'principality' was replaced with 'country' [117] UK Government toponymic guidelines state that, 'though there is a Prince of Wales, this role is deemed to be titular rather than exerting executive authority, and therefore Wales is described as a country rather than a principality.' [119]\n\n\nDevolved Government\nFollowing devolution in 1997, the Government of Wales Act 1998 created a Welsh devolved assembly, the National Assembly for Wales, with the power to determine how Wales's central government budget is spent and administered [126] Eight years later, the Government of Wales Act 2006 reformed the National Assembly for Wales and allowed further powers to be granted to it more easily The Act also created a system of government with a separate executive, the Welsh Government, drawn from and accountable to the legislature, the National Assembly Following a successful referendum in 2011, the National Assembly was empowered to make laws, known as Acts of the Assembly, on all matters in devolved subject areas, without requiring the UK Parliament's approval of legislative competence It also gained powers to raise taxes [127]: 33–34  In May 2020, the National Assembly was renamed \"Senedd Cymru\" or \"the Welsh Parliament\", commonly known as the Senedd in both English and Welsh [107]\n\n\nLaw\nBy tradition, Welsh Law was compiled during an assembly held at Whitland around 930 by Hywel Dda, king of most of Wales between 942 and his death in 950 The 'law of Hywel Dda' (Welsh: Cyfraith Hywel), as it became known, codified the previously existing folk laws and legal customs that had evolved in Wales over centuries Welsh Law emphasised the payment of compensation for a crime to the victim, or the victim's kin, rather than punishment by the ruler [130] Other than in the Marches, where March law was imposed by the Marcher Lords, Welsh Law remained in force in Wales until the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284 Edward I of England annexed the Principality of Wales following the death of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, and Welsh Law was replaced for criminal cases under the Statute Marcher Law and Welsh Law (for civil cases) remained in force until Henry VIII of England annexed the whole of Wales under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 (often referred to as the Acts of Union of 1536 and 1543), after which English law applied to the whole of Wales [131] [132] The Wales and Berwick Act 1746 provided that all laws that applied to England would automatically apply to Wales (and the Anglo-Scottish border town of Berwick) unless the law explicitly stated otherwise; this Act was repealed with regard to Wales in 1967 English law has been the legal system of England and Wales since 1536 [133]\n\n\nGeography and natural history\nWales is a generally mountainous country on the western side of central southern Great Britain [138] It is about 170 miles (270 km) north to south [139] The oft-quoted \"size of Wales\" is about 20,779 km2 (8,023 sq mi) [140] Wales is bordered by England to the east and by sea in all other directions: the Irish Sea to the north and west, St George's Channel and the Celtic Sea to the southwest and the Bristol Channel to the south [141] [142] Wales has about 1,680 miles (2,700 km) of coastline (along the mean high water mark), including the mainland, Anglesey, and Holyhead [143] Over 50 islands lie off the Welsh mainland, the largest being Anglesey, in the north-west [144]\n\n\nGeology\nThe earliest geological period of the Palaeozoic era, the Cambrian, takes its name from the Cambrian Mountains, where geologists first identified Cambrian remnants [158] [159] In the mid-19th century, Roderick Murchison and Adam Sedgwick used their studies of Welsh geology to establish certain principles of stratigraphy and palaeontology The next two periods of the Palaeozoic era, the Ordovician and Silurian, were named after ancient Celtic tribes from this area [160] [161]\n\n\nClimate\nWales lies within the north temperate zone It has a changeable, maritime climate and is one of the wettest countries in Europe [163] [164] Welsh weather is often cloudy, wet and windy, with warm summers and mild winters [163] [165]\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nWales's wildlife is typical of Britain with several distinctions Because of its long coastline, Wales hosts a variety of seabirds The coasts and surrounding islands are home to colonies of gannets, Manx shearwater, puffins, kittiwakes, shags and razorbills In comparison, with 60 per cent of Wales above the 150m contour, the country also supports a variety of upland-habitat birds, including raven and ring ouzel [171] [172] Birds of prey include the merlin, hen harrier and the red kite, a national symbol of Welsh wildlife [173] In total, more than 200 different species of bird have been seen at the RSPB reserve at Conwy, including seasonal visitors [174] Larger mammals, including brown bears, wolves and wildcats, died out during the Norman period Today, mammals include shrews, voles, badgers, otters, stoats, weasels, hedgehogs and fifteen species of bat Two species of small rodent, the yellow-necked mouse and the dormouse, are of special Welsh note being found at the historically undisturbed border area [175] The pine marten, which has been sighted occasionally, has been reintroduced in parts of Wales since 2015, having previously not been officially recorded since the 1950s [176] The polecat was nearly driven to extinction in Britain, but hung on in Wales and is now rapidly spreading Feral goats can be found in Snowdonia [177] In March 2021, Natural Resources Wales (NRW) granted a licence to release up to six beavers in the Dyfi Valley, the first official beaver release in Wales [178]\n\n\nEconomy\nOver the last 250 years, Wales has been transformed from a predominantly agricultural country to an industrial, and then to a post-industrial economy [182] In the 1950s, Wales's GDP was twice as big as Ireland's; by the 2020s, Ireland's economy was four times that of Wales Since the Second World War, the service sector has come to account for the majority of jobs, a feature typifying most advanced economies [183] in 2018, according to OECD and Eurostat data, gross domestic product (GDP) in Wales was £75 billion, an increase of 3.3 per cent from 2017 GDP per head in Wales in 2018 was £23,866, an increase of 2.9 per cent on 2017 This compares to Italy's GDP/capita of £25,000, Spain £22,000, Slovenia £20,000 and New Zealand £30,000 [184] [185] In the three months to December 2017, 72.7 per cent of working-age adults were employed, compared to 75.2 per cent across the UK as a whole [186] For the 2018–19 fiscal year, the Welsh fiscal deficit accounts for 19.4 per cent of Wales's estimated GDP [187]\n\n\nTransport\nRail transport in Wales includes the Wales & Borders franchise, which is overseen by the Welsh Government with most passenger services operated by Transport for Wales Rail [211] The Cardiff region has its own urban rail network Beeching cuts in the 1960s mean that most of the remaining network is geared toward east-west travel connecting with the Irish Sea ports for ferries to Ireland [212] Services between north and south Wales operate through the English cities of Chester and Hereford and towns of Shrewsbury, Gobowen for Oswestry and along the Welsh Marches Line, with trains on the Heart of Wales Line from Swansea to Llandovery, Llandrindod and Knighton, connecting with the Welsh Marches line at Craven Arms Trains in Wales are mainly diesel-powered but the South Wales Main Line branch of the Great Western Main Line used by services from London Paddington to Cardiff is undergoing electrification, although the programme has experienced significant delays and cost overruns [213] A North-South railway has been suggested to better link North and South Wales [214] [215] [216]\n\n\nMain roads\nRail transport in Wales includes the Wales & Borders franchise, which is overseen by the Welsh Government with most passenger

African and North American destinations, it is about 12 miles (19 km) southwest of Cardiff city centre, in the Vale of Glamorgan Intra-Wales flights used to run between Anglesey (Valley) and Cardiff, and were operated since 2017 by Eastern Airways; [217] as of 2022, those flights are no longer available Other internal flights operate to northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland [218] Wales has four commercial ferry ports Regular ferry services to Ireland operate from Holyhead, Pembroke Dock and Fishguard The Swansea to Cork service was cancelled in 2006, reinstated in March 2010, and withdrawn again in 2012 [219]\n\n\nEducation\n A distinct education system has developed in Wales [221] Formal education before the 18th century was the preserve of the elite The first grammar schools were established in Welsh towns such as Ruthin, Brecon and Cowbridge [221] One of the first successful schooling systems was started by Griffith Jones, who introduced the circulating schools in the 1730s; these are believed to have taught half the country's population to read [222] In the early 19th century, English became the usual language of instruction at schools in Wales While the country's working class was largely Welsh-speaking at the time, Welsh public opinion wished for children to learn English [223] [224] Many schools used corporal punishment to stop children from speaking Welsh in the first half of the 19th century; [225] the practice declined in the second half of the century [226] [227] The British government never prohibited the use of Welsh at schools but it treated English as the assumed language of instruction [228] More Welsh was gradually used at schools in Welsh-speaking areas in the mid to late 19th century [229] [230] and teaching of the language began to receive moderate government support from the late 19th century [231]\n\n\nHealthcare\nPublic healthcare in Wales is provided by NHS Wales (GIG Cymru), through seven local health boards and three all-Wales trusts It was originally formed as part of the NHS structure for England and Wales by the National Health Service Act 1946, but with powers over the NHS in Wales coming under the Secretary of State for Wales in 1969 [237] Responsibility for NHS Wales passed to the Welsh Assembly under devolution in 1999, and is now the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Social Services [238] Historically, Wales was served by smaller 'cottage' hospitals, built as voluntary institutions [239] As newer, more expensive, diagnostic techniques and treatments became available, clinical work has been concentrated in newer, larger district hospitals [239] In 2006, there were seventeen district hospitals in Wales [239] NHS Wales directly employs over 90,000 staff, making it Wales's biggest employer [240] The National Survey for Wales in 2021–22 reported that 72 per cent of adults surveyed had good or very good general health, 19 per cent had fair general health and 8 had bad or very bad general health [241] The survey recorded that 46 per cent of Welsh adults had a long-standing illness, such as arthritis, asthma, diabetes or heart disease [242] The survey also reported that 13 per cent of the adult population were smokers, 16 per cent admitted drinking alcohol above weekly recommended guidelines, while 56 per cent undertook the recommended 150 minutes of physical activity each week [243] According to the survey, 30 per cent of adults in Wales reported to have eaten at least 5 portions of fruit or vegetables the previous day and 36 per cent reported a healthy weight [244]\n\n\nDemography\nThe population of Wales doubled from 587,000 in 1801 to 1,163,000 in 1851 and had reached 2,421,000 by 1911 Most of the increase came in the coal mining districts, especially Glamorganshire, which grew from 71,000 in 1801 to 232,000 in 1851 and 1,122,000 in 1911 [248] Part of this increase can be attributed to the demographic transition seen in most industrialising countries during the Industrial Revolution, as death rates dropped and birth rates remained steady However, there was also large-scale migration into Wales during the Industrial Revolution The English were the most numerous group, but there were also considerable numbers of Irish and smaller numbers of other ethnic groups, [249] including Italians, who migrated to South Wales [250] Wales also received immigration from various parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations in the 20th century, and African-Caribbean and Asian communities add to the ethnocultural mix, particularly in urban Wales Many of these self-identify as Welsh [251]\n\n\nPopulation history\nThe population of Wales doubled from 587,000 in 1801 to 1,163,000 in 1851 and had reached 2,421,000 by 1911 Most of the

add to the ethnocultural mix, particularly in urban Wales Many of these self-identify as Welsh [251]\n\n\nLanguage\nWelsh is an official language in Wales as legislated by the Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011 [257] Both Welsh and English are also official languages of the Senedd [258] The proportion of the Welsh population able to speak the Welsh language fell from just under 50 per cent in 1901 to 43.5 per cent in 1911, and continued to fall to a low of 18.9 per cent in 1981 [259] The results of the 2001 Census showed an increase in the number of Welsh speakers to 21 per cent of the population aged 3 and older, compared with 18.7 per cent in 1991 and 19 per cent in 1981 This compares with a pattern of steady decline indicated by census results during the 20th century [260] In the 2011 census it was recorded that the proportion of people able to speak Welsh had dropped from 20.8 per cent to 19 per cent (still higher than 1991) Despite an increase in the overall size of the Welsh population this still meant that the number of Welsh speakers in Wales dropped from 582,000 in 2001 to 562,000 in 2011 However this figure was still much higher than 508,000 or 18.7 per cent of people who said they could speak Welsh in the 1991 census [261]\n\n\nReligion\nForms of Christianity have dominated religious life in what is now Wales for more than 1,400 years [268] [269]\nThe 2021 census recorded that 46.5 per cent had \"No religion\", more than any single religious affiliation and up from 32.1 per cent in 2011 [270] The largest religion in Wales is Christianity, with 43.6 per cent of the population describing themselves as Christian in the 2021 census [270] The patron saint of Wales is Saint David (Dewi Sant), with Saint David's Day (Dydd Gŵyl Dewi Sant) celebrated annually on 1 March [271] The early 20th century saw a religious revival, the 1904–1905 Welsh Revival, which started through the evangelism of Evan Roberts and brought large numbers of converts, sometimes whole communities, to non-Anglican Christianity [272]\n\n\nEthnicity\nThe 2021 census showed that 93.8 per cent of the population of Wales identified as \"White\", compared to 95.6 per cent in 2011 90.6 per cent of the population identified as \"White: Welsh, English, Scottish, Northern Irish or British\" in 2021 The second-highest ethnicity in 2021 was \"Asian, Asian Welsh or Asian British\" at 2.9 per cent of the population, compared to 2.3 per cent in 2011 1.6 per cent of the population identified as \"Mixed or multiple ethnic groups\", compared to 1.0 per cent in 2011; 0.9 per cent of the population identified as \"Black, Black Welsh, Black British, Caribbean or African\", compared to 0.6 per cent in 2011; and 0.9 per cent identified as \"Other ethnic group\" compared to 0.5 per cent in 2011 The local authorities with the highest proportions of \"high-level\" ethnic groups other than \"White\" were mainly urban areas including Cardiff, Newport and Swansea 5.3 per cent of households in Wales were multiple ethnic group households, up from 4.2 per cent in 2011 [279]\n\n\nNational identity\nThe 2021 census showed that 55.2 per cent identified as \"Welsh only\" and 8.1 per cent identified as \"Welsh and British\", giving the combined proportion of 63.3 per cent for people identifying as Welsh [281] The Welsh Annual Population Survey showed that the proportion of people who identified as Welsh versus another identity was 62.3 per cent in 2022, compared to 69.2 per cent in 2001 [282] A 2022 YouGov poll found that 21 per cent considered themselves Welsh not British, 15 per cent more Welsh than British, 24 per cent equally Welsh and British, 7 per cent more British than Welsh, 20 per cent British and not Welsh, and 8 per cent other; a total of 67 per cent thus considered themselves Welsh to some degree [283]\n\n\nCulture\nWales has a distinctive culture including its own language, customs, holidays and music There are four UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Wales: The Castles and Town Walls of King Edward I in Gwynedd; Pontcysyllte Aqueduct and Canal; the Blaenavon Industrial Landscape; and The Slate Landscape of Northwest Wales [284]\n\n\nMythology\nRemnants of native Celtic mythology of the pre-Christian Britons was passed down orally by the cynfeirdd (the early poets) [285] Some of their work survives in later medieval Welsh manuscripts: the Black Book of Carmarthen and the Book of Aneirin (both 13th-century); the Book of Taliesin and the White Book of Rhydderch (both 14th-century); and the Red Book of Hergest (c. 1400) [285] The prose stories from the White and Red Books are known as the Mabinogion [286] Poems such as Cad Goddeu (The Battle of the Trees) and mnemonic list-texts like the Welsh Triads and the Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain, also contain mythological material [287] These texts include the earliest forms of the Arthurian legend and the traditional history of post-Roman Britain [285] Other sources of Welsh folklore include the 9th-century Latin historical compilation Historia Britonum (the History of the Britons) and Geoffrey of Monmouth's 12th-century Latin chronicle Historia Regum Britanniae (the History of the Kings of Britain), and later folklore, such as The Welsh Fairy Book by W Jenkyn Thomas [288]\n\n\nLiterature\nWales has one of the oldest unbroken literary traditions in Europe [289] going back to the sixth century and including Geoffrey of Monmouth and Gerald of Wales, regarded as among the finest Latin authors of the Middle Ages [289] The earliest body of Welsh verse, by poets Taliesin and Aneirin, survive not in their original form, but in much-changed, medieval versions [289] Welsh poetry and native lore and learning survived through the era of the Poets of the Princes (c. 1100–1280) and then the Poets of the Gentry (c. 1350–1650) The former were professional poets who composed eulogies and elegies to their patrons while the latter favoured the cywydd metre [290] The period produced one of Wales's greatest poets, Dafydd ap Gwilym [291] After the Anglicisation of the gentry the tradition declined [290]\n\n\nMuseums and libraries\nAmgueddfa Cymru – Museum Wales was founded by royal charter in 1907 as the National Museum of Wales It operates at seven sites: National Museum Cardiff, St Fagans National History Museum, Big Pit National Coal Museum, National Wool Museum, National Slate Museum, National Roman Legion Museum, and the National Waterfront Museum Entry to all sites is free [300] The National Library of Wales, based in Aberystwyth, houses important collections of printed works, including the Sir John Williams Collection and the Shirburn Castle collection, [301] as well as art collections including portraits and photographs, ephemera and Ordnance Survey maps [301]\n\n\nVisual arts\nWorks of Celtic art have been found in Wales [302] In the Early Medieval period, the Celtic Christianity of Wales was part of the Insular art of the British Isles A number of illuminated manuscripts from Wales survive, including the 8th-century Hereford Gospels and Lichfield Gospels The 11th-century Ricemarch Psalter (now in Dublin) is certainly Welsh, made in St David's, and shows a late Insular style with unusual Viking influence [303]\n\n\nNational symbols and identity\nWales is regarded as a modern Celtic nation which contributes to its national identity, [30] [311] with Welsh artists regularly appearing at Celtic festivals [312] The red dragon is the principal symbol of national identity and pride, personifying the fearlessness of the Welsh nation [313] The dragon is first referenced in literature as a symbol of the people in the Historia Brittonum Vortigern (Welsh: Gwrtheyrn), King of the Celtic Britons, is interrupted while attempting to build a fort at Dinas Emrys He is told by Ambrosius [f] to dig up two dragons beneath the castle He discovers a red dragon representing the Celtic Britons, and a white dragon representing Anglo-Saxons Ambrosius prophesies that the Celtic Britons will reclaim the island and push the Anglo-Saxons back to the sea [315]\n\n\nSport\nMore than 50 national governing bodies regulate and organise their sports in Wales [335] Most of those involved in competitive sports select, organise and manage individuals or teams to represent their country at international events or fixtures against other countries Wales is represented at major world sporting events such as the FIFA World Cup, Rugby World Cup, Rugby League World Cup and the Commonwealth Games At the Olympic Games, Welsh athletes compete alongside those of Scotland, England and Northern Ireland as part of a Great Britain team Wales has hosted several international sporting events [336] These include the 1958 Commonwealth Games, [337] the 1999 Rugby World Cup, the 2010 Ryder Cup and the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final [336] [338]\n\n\nMedia\nWales became the UK's first digital television nation in 2010 [357] BBC Cymru Wales is the national broadcaster, [358] producing both television and radio programmes in Welsh and English [359] It has also produced programmes such as Life on Mars, Doctor Who and Torchwood for BBC's network audience across the United Kingdom [358] [360] ITV, the UK's main commercial broadcaster, has a Welsh-orientated service branded ITV Cymru Wales [361] S4C began broadcasting in 1982 Its output was mostly in Welsh at peak hours, but shared English-language content with Channel 4 at other times Since the digital switchover the channel has broadcast exclusively in Welsh [362] BBC Radio Cymru is the BBC's Welsh-language radio service, which broadcasts throughout Wales [358] A number of independent radio stations broadcast in the Welsh regions, predominantly in English In 2006, several regional radio stations broadcast in Welsh: output ranged from two two-minute news bulletins each weekday (Radio Maldwyn) to over 14 hours of Welsh-language programmes weekly (Swansea Sound) to essentially bilingual stations such as Heart Cymru and Radio Ceredigion [363]\n\n\nCuisine\nTraditional Welsh dishes include laverbread (made from Porphyra umbilicalis, an edible seaweed), bara brith (fruit bread), cawl (a lamb stew), cawl cennin (leek soup), and Welsh cakes [373] Cockles are sometimes served as a traditional breakfast with bacon and laverbread [374] Although Wales has its own traditional food and has absorbed much of the cuisine of England, Welsh diets now owe more to the countries of India, China and the United States Chicken tikka masala is the country's favourite dish, while hamburgers and Chinese food outsell fish and chips as takeaways [375]\n\n\nPerforming arts\nWales, \"the land of song\", is notable for its solo artists, its male voice choirs and its harpists [376] The annual National Eisteddfod is the country's main performance festival The Llangollen International Eisteddfod provides an opportunity for the singers and musicians of the world to perform The Welsh Folk Song Society publishes collections of historical songs and tunes [377] Traditional instruments of Wales include the telyn deires (triple harp), fiddle, crwth (bowed lyre) and the pibgorn (hornpipe) [378] Male voice choirs emerged in the 19th century, formed as the tenor and bass sections of chapel choirs, and embraced the popular secular hymns of the day [379] Welsh congregations and choirs were known for singing in a rousing four-voice style, becoming characteristic of the country [380] Many of the historic choirs survive in modern Wales, singing a mixture of traditional and popular songs [379]\n\n\nMusic and festivals\nWales, \"the land of song\", is notable for its solo artists, its male voice choirs and its harpists [376] The annual National Eisteddfod is the country's main performance festival The Llangollen International Eisteddfod provides an opportunity for the singers and musicians of the world to

congregations and choirs were known for singing in a rousing four-voice style, becoming characteristic of the country [380] Many of the historic choirs survive in modern Wales, singing a mixture of traditional and popular songs [379]\n\n\nDrama\nThe earliest surviving Welsh plays are two medieval miracle plays, Y Tri Brenin o Gwlen (\"The three Kings from Cologne\") and Y Dioddefaint a'r Atgyfodiad (\"The Passion and the Resurrection\") [387] A recognised Welsh tradition of theatre emerged during the 18th century, in the form of an interlude, a metrical play performed at fairs and markets [388] Drama in the early 20th century thrived, but the country established neither a Welsh National Theatre nor a national ballet company [389] After the Second World War, the substantial number of amateur theatre companies reduced by two-thirds [390] Competition from television in the mid-20th century led to greater professionalism in the theatre [390] Plays by Emlyn Williams and Alun Owen and others were staged, while Welsh actors, including Richard Burton and Anthony Hopkins, were establishing international reputations [390] [391] [392] Wales has also produced some well-known comedians [393]\n\n\nDance\nTraditional dances include Welsh folk dancing and clog dancing The first mention of dancing in Wales is in a 12th-century account by Giraldus Cambrensis, but by the 19th century traditional dance had all but died out due to religious opposition [389] In the 20th century a revival was led by Lois Blake (1890–1974) [389] Clog dancing was preserved and developed by Hywel Wood (1882–1967) and others who perpetuated the art on local and national stages [394] The Welsh Folk Dance Society was founded in 1949 [394] Contemporary dance grew out of Cardiff in the 1970s [394] The National Dance Company Wales, formed in 1983, is now resident at the Wales Millennium Centre [395]\n\n\nSee also\nCitations\n\n\nNotes\nCitations\n\n\nReferences\nCitations\n\n\nExternal

England to the east and by sea in all other directions. It is a predominantly mountainous country with a rich history, culture, and language. Wales is home to a diverse population of around 3.2 million people, with the majority speaking the Welsh language, which is an official language of the country.\n\nEtymology\nThe English words \"Wales\" and \"Welsh\" derive from the same Old English root (singular Wealh, plural Wēalas), a descendant of Proto-Germanic *Walhaz, which was itself derived from the name of the Gauls known to the Romans as Volcae. This term was later used to refer indiscriminately to inhabitants of the Western Roman Empire. Anglo-Saxons came to use the term to refer to the Britons in particular; the plural form Wēalas evolved into the name for their territory, Wales.\n\nHistory\nWales has been inhabited by modern humans for at least 29,000 years. Continuous human habitation dates from the end of the last ice age, between 12,000 and 10,000 years before present (BP), when Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from Central Europe began to migrate to Great Britain. The post-glacial rise in sea level separated Wales and Ireland, forming the Irish Sea. By 8,000 BP the British Peninsula had become an island.\n\nRoman Era\nThe Roman conquest of Wales began in AD 48 and took 30 years to complete; the occupation lasted over 300 years. The campaigns of conquest were opposed by two native tribes: the Silures and the Ordovices. Caractacus or Caradog, leader of the Ordovices, had initial success in resisting Roman invasions of north Wales but was eventually defeated.\n\nPost-Roman Era\nThe 400-year period following the collapse of Roman rule is the most difficult to interpret in the history of Wales. After the Roman departure in AD 410, much of the lowlands of Britain to the east and south-east was overrun by various Germanic peoples, commonly known as Anglo-Saxons. Some have theorized that the cultural dominance of the Anglo-Saxons was due to apartheid-like social conditions in which the Britons were at a disadvantage.\n\nHigh to Late Middle Ages\nGruffydd ap Llywelyn was the only ruler to unite all of Wales under his rule, described by one chronicler after his death as king of Wales. In 1055 Gruffydd ap Llywelyn killed his rival Gruffydd ap Rhydderch in battle and recaptured Deheubarth. Originally king of Gwynedd, by 1057 he was ruler of Wales and had annexed parts of England around the border.\n\nEarly Modern Period\nIn 1536 Wales had around 278,000 inhabitants, which increased to around 360,000 by 1620. This was primarily due to rural settlement, where animal farming was central to the Welsh economy.\n\nModern Period\nWales has been transformed from a predominantly agricultural country to an industrial, and then to a post-industrial economy. Over the last 250 years, the country has undergone significant changes, including the development of its industrial sector and the decline of its agricultural sector.\n\nDevolution\nThe Welsh Language Act 1967 repealed a section of the Wales and Berwick Act and thus \"Wales\" was no longer part of the legal definition of England. This essentially defined Wales as a separate entity legally (but within the UK), for the first time since before the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 which defined Wales as a part of the Kingdom of England.\n\nGovernment and Politics\nWales is a country that is part of the sovereign state of the United Kingdom. It has a devolved government, with its own assembly and executive, known as the Welsh Government. The Welsh Government is responsible for a range of areas, including education, health, and the economy.\n\nLaw\nBy tradition, Welsh Law was compiled during an assembly held at Whitland around 930 by Hywel Dda, king of most of Wales between 942 and his death in 950. The 'law of Hywel Dda' (Welsh: Cyfraith Hywel), as it became known, codified the previously existing folk laws and legal customs that had evolved in Wales over centuries.\n\nGeography and Natural History\nWales is a generally mountainous country on the western side of central southern Great Britain. It is about 170 miles (270 km) north to south. Wales has a varied landscape, with mountains, valleys, and coastline. The country is home to a diverse range of flora and fauna.\n\nEconomy\nOver the last 250 years, Wales has been transformed from a predominantly agricultural country to an industrial, and then to a post-industrial economy. The service sector now accounts for the majority of jobs in the country.\n\nTransport\nWales has a well-developed transport network, including roads, railways, and airports. The country is connected to the rest of the UK by the M4 motorway, which passes through the south of the country.\n\nEducation\nA distinct education system has developed in Wales. Formal education before the 18th century was the preserve of the elite. The first grammar schools were established in Welsh towns such as Ruthin, Brecon, and Cowbridge.\n\nHealthcare\nPublic healthcare in Wales is provided by NHS Wales (GIG Cymru), through seven local health boards and three all-Wales trusts. The National Library of Wales, based in Aberystwyth, houses important collections of printed works, including the Sir John Williams Collection and the Shirburn Castle collection.\n\nDemography\nThe population of Wales doubled from 587,000 in 1801 to 1,163,000 in 1851 and had reached 2,421,000 by 1911. The country has a diverse population, with around 3.2 million people living in Wales.\n\nLanguage\nWelsh is an official language in Wales, spoken by around 700,000 people. The language is part of the Celtic language family and is closely related to Breton and Cornish.\n\nCulture\nWales has a rich cultural heritage, with a strong tradition of music, dance, and literature. The country is home to a number of famous cultural institutions, including the National Museum of Wales and the Wales Millennium Centre.\n\nNational Identity\nWales is regarded as a modern Celtic nation, which contributes to its national identity. The country is proud of its history, culture, and language, and has a strong sense of national identity.\n\nMythology and Folklore\nWales has a rich mythology and folklore, with many stories and legends passed down through the centuries. The country is home to a number of famous mythical creatures, including the Red Dragon, which is a symbol of Welsh identity.\n\nMusic and Dance\nWales has a rich tradition of music and dance, with many famous musicians and dancers hailing from the country. The country is home to a number of famous music festivals, including the National Eisteddfod.\n\nDrama and Theatre\nWales has a rich tradition of drama and theatre, with many famous playwrights and actors hailing from the country. The country is home to a number of famous theatres, including the Wales Millennium Centre.\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Wales\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe English words \"Wales\" and \"Welsh\" derive from the same Old English root (singular Wealh, plural Wēalas), a descendant of Proto-Germanic *Walhaz, which was itself derived from the name of the Gauls known to the Romans as Volcae This term was later used to refer indiscriminately to inhabitants of the Western Roman Empire [14] Anglo-Saxons came to use the term to refer to the Britons in particular; the plural form Wēalas evolved into the name for their territory, Wales [15] [16] Historically in Britain, the words were not restricted to modern Wales or to the Welsh but were used to refer to anything that Anglo-Saxons associated with Britons, including other non-Germanic territories in Britain (e.g Cornwall) and places in Anglo-Saxon territory associated with Britons (e.g Walworth in County Durham and Walton in West Yorkshire) [17]\n\n\nHistory\nWales has been inhabited by modern humans for at least 29,000 years [22] Continuous human habitation dates from the end of the last ice age, between 12,000 and 10,000 years before present (BP), when Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from Central Europe began to migrate to Great Britain At that time, sea levels were much lower than today Wales was free of glaciers by about 10,250 BP, the warmer climate allowing the area to become heavily wooded The post-glacial rise in sea level separated Wales and Ireland, forming the Irish Sea By 8,000 BP the British Peninsula had become an island [23] By the beginning of the Neolithic (c. 6,000 BP) sea levels in the Bristol Channel were still about 33 feet (10 metres) lower than today [24] The historian John Davies theorised that the story of Cantre'r Gwaelod's drowning and tales in the Mabinogion, of the waters between Wales and Ireland being narrower and shallower, may be distant folk memories of this time [25]\n\n\nPrehistoric origins\nWales has been inhabited by modern humans for at least 29,000 years [22] Continuous human habitation dates from the end of the last ice age, between 12,000 and 10,000 years before present (BP), when Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from Central Europe began to migrate to Great Britain At that time, sea levels were much lower than today Wales was free of glaciers by about 10,250 BP, the warmer climate allowing the area to become heavily wooded The post-glacial rise in sea level separated Wales and Ireland, forming the Irish Sea By 8,000 BP the British Peninsula had become an island [23] By the beginning of the Neolithic (c. 6,000 BP) sea levels in the Bristol Channel were still about 33 feet (10 metres) lower than today [24] The historian John Davies theorised that the story of Cantre'r Gwaelod's drowning and tales in the Mabinogion, of the waters between Wales and Ireland being narrower and shallower, may be distant folk memories of this time [25]\n\n\nRoman era\nThe Roman conquest of Wales began in AD 48 and took 30 years to complete; the occupation lasted over 300 years The campaigns of conquest were opposed by two native tribes: the Silures and the Ordovices Caractacus or Caradog, leader of the Ordovices, had initial success in resisting Roman invasions of north Wales but was eventually defeated [31] [32] Roman rule in Wales was a military occupation, save for the southern coastal region of south Wales, where there is a legacy of Romanisation [33] The only town in Wales founded by the Romans, Caerwent, is in south east Wales [34] Both Caerwent and Carmarthen, also in southern Wales, became Roman civitates [35] Wales had a rich mineral wealth The Romans used their engineering technology to extract large amounts of gold, copper, and lead, as well as lesser amounts of zinc and silver [36] No significant industries were located in Wales in this time; [36] this was largely a matter of circumstance as Wales had none of the necessary materials in suitable combination, and the forested, mountainous countryside was not amenable to industrialisation Latin became the official language of Wales, though the people continued to speak in Brythonic While Romanisation was far from complete, the upper classes came to consider themselves Roman, particularly after the ruling of 212 that granted Roman citizenship to all free men throughout the Empire [37] Further Roman influence came through the spread of Christianity, which gained many followers when Christians were allowed to worship freely; state persecution ceased in the 4th century, as a result of Constantine the Great issuing an edict of toleration in 313 [37]\n\n\nPost-Roman era\nThe 400-year period following the collapse of Roman rule is the most difficult to interpret in the history of Wales [37] After the Roman departure in AD 410, much of the lowlands of Britain to the east and south-east was overrun by various Germanic peoples, commonly known as Anglo-Saxons Some have theorized that the cultural dominance of the Anglo-Saxons was due to apartheid-like social conditions in which the Britons were at a disadvantage [42]\nBy AD 500 the land that would become Wales had divided into a number of kingdoms free from Anglo-Saxon rule [37] The kingdoms of Gwynedd, Powys, Dyfed, Caredigion, Morgannwg, the Ystrad Tywi, and Gwent emerged as independent Welsh successor states [37] Archaeological evidence, in the Low Countries and what was to become England, shows early Anglo-Saxon migration to Great Britain reversed between 500 and 550, which concurs with Frankish chronicles [43] John Davies notes this as consistent with a victory for the Celtic Britons at Badon Hill against the Saxons, which was attributed to Arthur by Nennius [43]\n\n\nHigh to late middle ages\nGruffydd ap Llywelyn was the only ruler to unite all of Wales under his rule, described by one chronicler after his death as king of Wales In 1055 Gruffydd ap Llywelyn killed his rival Gruffydd ap Rhydderch in battle and recaptured Deheubarth [54] Originally king of Gwynedd, by 1057 he was ruler of Wales and had annexed parts of England around the border He ruled Wales with no internal battles [55] His territories were again divided into the traditional kingdoms [56] John Davies states that Gruffydd was \"the only Welsh king ever to rule over the entire territory of Wales.. Thus, from about 1057 until his death in 1063, the whole of Wales recognised the kingship of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn For about seven brief years, Wales was one, under one ruler, a feat with neither precedent nor successor.\" [3] Owain Gwynedd (1100–1170) of the Aberffraw line was the first Welsh ruler to use the title princeps Wallensium (prince of the Welsh), a title of substance given his victory on the Berwyn range, according to Davies [57] During this time, between 1053 and 1063, Wales lacked any internal strife and was at peace [58]\n\n\nEarly modern period\nIn 1536 Wales had around 278,000 inhabitants, which increased to around 360,000 by 1620 This was primarily due to rural settlement, where animal farming was central to the Welsh economy Increase in trade and increased economic stability occurred due to the increased diversity of the Welsh economy Population growth however outpaced economic growth and the standard of living dropped [77]\n\n\nModern period\nHistorian Kenneth Morgan described Wales on the eve of the First World War as a \"relatively placid, self-confident and successful nation\" The output from the coalfields continued to increase, with the Rhondda Valley recording a peak of 9.6 million tons of coal extracted in 1913 [83] The First World War (1914–1918) saw a total of 272,924 Welshmen under arms, representing 21.5 per cent of the male population Of these, roughly 35,000 were killed, [84] with particularly heavy losses of Welsh forces at Mametz Wood on the Somme and the Battle of Passchendaele [85]\n\n\nDevolution\nThe Welsh Language Act 1967 repealed a section of the Wales and Berwick Act and thus \"Wales\" was no longer part of the legal definition of England This essentially defined Wales as a separate entity legally (but within the UK), for the first time since before the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 which defined Wales as a part of the Kingdom of England The Welsh Language Act 1967 also expanded areas where use of Welsh was permitted, including in some legal situations [102] [103]\n\n\nWelsh language\nThe Welsh language (Welsh: Cymraeg) is an Indo-European language of the Celtic family; [108] the most closely related languages are Cornish and Breton Most linguists believe that the Celtic languages arrived in Britain around 600 BCE [109] The Brythonic languages ceased to be spoken in England and were replaced by the English language, a Germanic language which arrived in Wales around the end of the eighth century due to the defeat of the Kingdom of Powys [110]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nWales is a country that is part of the sovereign state of the United Kingdom [13] ISO 3166-2:GB formerly defined Wales as a principality, with England and Scotland defined as countries and Northern Ireland as a province [117] However, this definition was raised in the Welsh Assembly in 2010 and the then Counsel General for Wales, John Griffiths, stated, 'Principality is a misnomer and that Wales should properly be referred to as a country.' [118] In 2011, ISO 3166-2:GB was updated and the term 'principality' was replaced with 'country' [117] UK Government toponymic guidelines state that, 'though there is a Prince of Wales, this role is deemed to be titular rather than exerting executive authority, and therefore Wales is described as a country rather than a principality.' [119]\n\n\nDevolved Government\nFollowing devolution in 1997, the Government of Wales Act 1998 created a Welsh devolved assembly, the National Assembly for Wales, with the power to determine how Wales's central government budget is spent and administered [126] Eight years later, the Government of Wales Act 2006 reformed the National Assembly for Wales and allowed further powers to be granted to it more easily The Act also created a system of government with a separate executive, the Welsh Government, drawn from and accountable to the legislature, the National Assembly Following a successful referendum in 2011, the National Assembly was empowered to make laws, known as Acts of the Assembly, on all matters in devolved subject areas, without requiring the UK Parliament's approval of legislative competence It also gained powers to raise taxes [127]: 33–34  In May 2020, the National Assembly was renamed \"Senedd Cymru\" or \"the Welsh Parliament\", commonly known as the Senedd in both English and Welsh [107]\n\n\nLaw\nBy tradition, Welsh Law was compiled during an assembly held at Whitland around 930 by Hywel Dda, king of most of Wales between 942 and his death in 950 The 'law of Hywel Dda' (Welsh: Cyfraith Hywel), as it became known, codified the previously existing folk laws and legal customs that had evolved in Wales over centuries Welsh Law emphasised the payment of compensation for a crime to the victim, or the victim's kin, rather than punishment by the ruler [130] Other than in the Marches, where March law was imposed by the Marcher Lords, Welsh Law remained in force in Wales until the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284 Edward I of England annexed the Principality of Wales following the death of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, and Welsh Law was replaced for criminal cases under the Statute Marcher Law and Welsh Law (for civil cases) remained in force until Henry VIII of England annexed the whole of Wales under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 (often referred to as the Acts of Union of 1536 and 1543), after which English law applied to the whole of Wales [131] [132] The Wales and Berwick Act 1746 provided that all laws that applied to England would automatically apply to Wales (and the Anglo-Scottish border town of Berwick) unless the law explicitly stated otherwise; this Act was repealed with regard to Wales in 1967 English law has been the legal system of England and Wales since 1536 [133]\n\n\nGeography and natural history\nWales is a generally mountainous country on the western side of central southern Great Britain [138] It is about 170 miles (270 km) north to south [139] The oft-quoted \"size of Wales\" is about 20,779 km2 (8,023 sq mi) [140] Wales is bordered by England to the east and by sea in all other directions: the Irish Sea to the north and west, St George's Channel and the Celtic Sea to the southwest and the Bristol Channel to the south [141] [142] Wales has about 1,680 miles (2,700 km) of coastline (along the mean high water mark), including the mainland, Anglesey, and Holyhead [143] Over 50 islands lie off the Welsh mainland, the largest being Anglesey, in the north-west [144]\n\n\nGeology\nThe earliest geological period of the Palaeozoic era, the Cambrian, takes its name from the Cambrian Mountains, where geologists first identified Cambrian remnants [158] [159] In the mid-19th century, Roderick Murchison and Adam Sedgwick used their studies of Welsh geology to establish certain principles of stratigraphy and palaeontology The next two periods of the Palaeozoic era, the Ordovician and Silurian, were named after ancient Celtic tribes from this area [160] [161]\n\n\nClimate\nWales lies within the north temperate zone It has a changeable, maritime climate and is one of the wettest countries in Europe [163] [164] Welsh weather is often cloudy, wet and windy, with warm summers and mild winters [163] [165]\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nWales's wildlife is typical of Britain with several distinctions Because of its long coastline, Wales hosts a variety of seabirds The coasts and surrounding islands are home to colonies of gannets, Manx shearwater, puffins, kittiwakes, shags and razorbills In comparison, with 60 per cent of Wales above the 150m contour, the country also supports a variety of upland-habitat birds, including raven and ring ouzel [171] [172] Birds of prey include the merlin, hen harrier and the red kite, a national symbol of Welsh wildlife [173] In total, more than 200 different species of bird have been seen at the RSPB reserve at Conwy, including seasonal visitors [174] Larger mammals, including brown bears, wolves and wildcats, died out during the Norman period Today, mammals include shrews, voles, badgers, otters, stoats, weasels, hedgehogs and fifteen species of bat Two species of small rodent, the yellow-necked mouse and the dormouse, are of special Welsh note being found at the historically undisturbed border area [175] The pine marten, which has been sighted occasionally, has been reintroduced in parts of Wales since 2015, having previously not been officially recorded since the 1950s [176] The polecat was nearly driven to extinction in Britain, but hung on in Wales and is now rapidly spreading Feral goats can be found in Snowdonia [177] In March 2021, Natural Resources Wales (NRW) granted a licence to release up to six beavers in the Dyfi Valley, the first official beaver release in Wales [178]\n\n\nEconomy\nOver the last 250 years, Wales has been transformed from a predominantly agricultural country to an industrial, and then to a post-industrial economy [182] In the 1950s, Wales's GDP was twice as big as Ireland's; by the 2020s, Ireland's economy was four times that of Wales Since the Second World War, the service sector has come to account for the majority of jobs, a feature typifying most advanced economies [183] in 2018, according to OECD and Eurostat data, gross domestic product (GDP) in Wales was £75 billion, an increase of 3.3 per cent from 2017 GDP per head in Wales in 2018 was £23,866, an increase of 2.9 per cent on 2017 This compares to Italy's GDP/capita of £25,000, Spain £22,000, Slovenia £20,000 and New Zealand £30,000 [184] [185] In the three months to December 2017, 72.7 per cent of working-age adults were employed, compared to 75.2 per cent across the UK as a whole [186] For the 2018–19 fiscal year, the Welsh fiscal deficit accounts for 19.4 per cent of Wales's estimated GDP [187]\n\n\nTransport\nRail transport in Wales includes the Wales & Borders franchise, which is overseen by the Welsh Government with most passenger services operated by Transport for Wales Rail [211] The Cardiff region has its own urban rail network Beeching cuts in the 1960s mean that most of the remaining network is geared toward east-west travel connecting with the Irish Sea ports for ferries to Ireland [212] Services between north and south Wales operate through the English cities of Chester and Hereford and towns of Shrewsbury, Gobowen for Oswestry and along the Welsh Marches Line, with trains on the Heart of Wales Line from Swansea to Llandovery, Llandrindod and Knighton, connecting with the Welsh Marches line at Craven Arms Trains in Wales are mainly diesel-powered but the South Wales Main Line branch of the Great Western Main Line used by services from London Paddington to Cardiff is undergoing electrification, although the programme has experienced significant delays and cost overruns [213] A North-South railway has been suggested to better link North and South Wales [214] [215] [216]\n\n\nMain roads\nRail transport in Wales includes the Wales & Borders franchise, which is overseen by the Welsh Government with most passenger

African and North American destinations, it is about 12 miles (19 km) southwest of Cardiff city centre, in the Vale of Glamorgan Intra-Wales flights used to run between Anglesey (Valley) and Cardiff, and were operated since 2017 by Eastern Airways; [217] as of 2022, those flights are no longer available Other internal flights operate to northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland [218] Wales has four commercial ferry ports Regular ferry services to Ireland operate from Holyhead, Pembroke Dock and Fishguard The Swansea to Cork service was cancelled in 2006, reinstated in March 2010, and withdrawn again in 2012 [219]\n\n\nEducation\n A distinct education system has developed in Wales [221] Formal education before the 18th century was the preserve of the elite The first grammar schools were established in Welsh towns such as Ruthin, Brecon and Cowbridge [221] One of the first successful schooling systems was started by Griffith Jones, who introduced the circulating schools in the 1730s; these are believed to have taught half the country's population to read [222] In the early 19th century, English became the usual language of instruction at schools in Wales While the country's working class was largely Welsh-speaking at the time, Welsh public opinion wished for children to learn English [223] [224] Many schools used corporal punishment to stop children from speaking Welsh in the first half of the 19th century; [225] the practice declined in the second half of the century [226] [227] The British government never prohibited the use of Welsh at schools but it treated English as the assumed language of instruction [228] More Welsh was gradually used at schools in Welsh-speaking areas in the mid to late 19th century [229] [230] and teaching of the language began to receive moderate government support from the late 19th century [231]\n\n\nHealthcare\nPublic healthcare in Wales is provided by NHS Wales (GIG Cymru), through seven local health boards and three all-Wales trusts It was originally formed as part of the NHS structure for England and Wales by the National Health Service Act 1946, but with powers over the NHS in Wales coming under the Secretary of State for Wales in 1969 [237] Responsibility for NHS Wales passed to the Welsh Assembly under devolution in 1999, and is now the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Social Services [238] Historically, Wales was served by smaller 'cottage' hospitals, built as voluntary institutions [239] As newer, more expensive, diagnostic techniques and treatments became available, clinical work has been concentrated in newer, larger district hospitals [239] In 2006, there were seventeen district hospitals in Wales [239] NHS Wales directly employs over 90,000 staff, making it Wales's biggest employer [240] The National Survey for Wales in 2021–22 reported that 72 per cent of adults surveyed had good or very good general health, 19 per cent had fair general health and 8 had bad or very bad general health [241] The survey recorded that 46 per cent of Welsh adults had a long-standing illness, such as arthritis, asthma, diabetes or heart disease [242] The survey also reported that 13 per cent of the adult population were smokers, 16 per cent admitted drinking alcohol above weekly recommended guidelines, while 56 per cent undertook the recommended 150 minutes of physical activity each week [243] According to the survey, 30 per cent of adults in Wales reported to have eaten at least 5 portions of fruit or vegetables the previous day and 36 per cent reported a healthy weight [244]\n\n\nDemography\nThe population of Wales doubled from 587,000 in 1801 to 1,163,000 in 1851 and had reached 2,421,000 by 1911 Most of the increase came in the coal mining districts, especially Glamorganshire, which grew from 71,000 in 1801 to 232,000 in 1851 and 1,122,000 in 1911 [248] Part of this increase can be attributed to the demographic transition seen in most industrialising countries during the Industrial Revolution, as death rates dropped and birth rates remained steady However, there was also large-scale migration into Wales during the Industrial Revolution The English were the most numerous group, but there were also considerable numbers of Irish and smaller numbers of other ethnic groups, [249] including Italians, who migrated to South Wales [250] Wales also received immigration from various parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations in the 20th century, and African-Caribbean and Asian communities add to the ethnocultural mix, particularly in urban Wales Many of these self-identify as Welsh [251]\n\n\nPopulation history\nThe population of Wales doubled from 587,000 in 1801 to 1,163,000 in 1851 and had reached 2,421,000 by 1911 Most of the increase came in the coal mining districts, especially Glamorganshire, which grew from 71,000 in 1801 to 232,000 in 1851 and 1,122,000 in 1911 [248] Part of this increase can be attributed to the

add to the ethnocultural mix, particularly in urban Wales Many of these self-identify as Welsh [251]\n\n\nLanguage\nWelsh is an official language in Wales as legislated by the Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011 [257] Both Welsh and English are also official languages of the Senedd [258] The proportion of the Welsh population able to speak the Welsh language fell from just under 50 per cent in 1901 to 43.5 per cent in 1911, and continued to fall to a low of 18.9 per cent in 1981 [259] The results of the 2001 Census showed an increase in the number of Welsh speakers to 21 per cent of the population aged 3 and older, compared with 18.7 per cent in 1991 and 19 per cent in 1981 This compares with a pattern of steady decline indicated by census results during the 20th century [260] In the 2011 census it was recorded that the proportion of people able to speak Welsh had dropped from 20.8 per cent to 19 per cent (still higher than 1991) Despite an increase in the overall size of the Welsh population this still meant that the number of Welsh speakers in Wales dropped from 582,000 in 2001 to 562,000 in 2011 However this figure was still much higher than 508,000 or 18.7 per cent of people who said they could speak Welsh in the 1991 census [261]\n\n\nReligion\nForms of Christianity have dominated religious life in what is now Wales for more than 1,400 years [268] [269]\nThe 2021 census recorded that 46.5 per cent had \"No religion\", more than any single religious affiliation and up from 32.1 per cent in 2011 [270] The largest religion in Wales is Christianity, with 43.6 per cent of the population describing themselves as Christian in the 2021 census [270] The patron saint of Wales is Saint David (Dewi Sant), with Saint David's Day (Dydd Gŵyl Dewi Sant) celebrated annually on 1 March [271] The early 20th century saw a religious revival, the 1904–1905 Welsh Revival, which started through the evangelism of Evan Roberts and brought large numbers of converts, sometimes whole communities, to non-Anglican Christianity [272]\n\n\nEthnicity\nThe 2021 census showed that 93.8 per cent of the population of Wales identified as \"White\", compared to 95.6 per cent in 2011 90.6 per cent of the population identified as \"White: Welsh, English, Scottish, Northern Irish or British\" in 2021 The second-highest ethnicity in 2021 was \"Asian, Asian Welsh or Asian British\" at 2.9 per cent of the population, compared to 2.3 per cent in 2011 1.6 per cent of the population identified as \"Mixed or multiple ethnic groups\", compared to 1.0 per cent in 2011; 0.9 per cent of the population identified as \"Black, Black Welsh, Black British, Caribbean or African\", compared to 0.6 per cent in 2011; and 0.9 per cent identified as \"Other ethnic group\" compared to 0.5 per cent in 2011 The local authorities with the highest proportions of \"high-level\" ethnic groups other than \"White\" were mainly urban areas including Cardiff, Newport and Swansea 5.3 per cent of households in Wales were multiple ethnic group households, up from 4.2 per cent in 2011 [279]\n\n\nNational identity\nThe 2021 census showed that 55.2 per cent identified as \"Welsh only\" and 8.1 per cent identified as \"Welsh and British\", giving the combined proportion of 63.3 per cent for people identifying as Welsh [281] The Welsh Annual Population Survey showed that the proportion of people who identified as Welsh versus another identity was 62.3 per cent in 2022, compared to 69.2 per cent in 2001 [282] A 2022 YouGov poll found that 21 per cent considered themselves Welsh not British, 15 per cent more Welsh than British, 24 per cent equally Welsh and British, 7 per cent more British than Welsh, 20 per cent British and not Welsh, and 8 per cent other; a total of 67 per cent thus considered themselves Welsh to some degree [283]\n\n\nCulture\nWales has a distinctive culture including its own language, customs, holidays and music There are four UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Wales: The Castles and Town Walls of King Edward I in Gwynedd; Pontcysyllte Aqueduct and Canal; the Blaenavon Industrial Landscape; and The Slate Landscape of Northwest Wales [284]\n\n\nMythology\nRemnants of native Celtic mythology of the pre-Christian Britons was passed down orally by the cynfeirdd (the early poets) [285] Some of their work survives in later medieval Welsh manuscripts: the Black Book of Carmarthen and the Book of Aneirin (both 13th-century); the Book of Taliesin and the White Book of Rhydderch (both 14th-century); and the Red Book of Hergest (c. 1400) [285] The prose stories from the White and Red Books are known as the Mabinogion [286] Poems such as Cad Goddeu (The Battle of the Trees) and mnemonic list-texts like the Welsh Triads and the Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain, also contain mythological material [287] These texts include the earliest forms of the Arthurian legend and the traditional history of post-Roman Britain [285] Other sources of Welsh folklore include the 9th-century Latin historical compilation Historia Britonum (the History of the Britons) and Geoffrey of Monmouth's 12th-century Latin chronicle Historia Regum Britanniae (the History of the Kings of Britain), and later folklore, such as The Welsh Fairy Book by W Jenkyn Thomas [288]\n\n\nLiterature\nWales has one of the oldest unbroken literary traditions in Europe [289] going back to the sixth century and including Geoffrey of Monmouth and Gerald of Wales, regarded as among the finest Latin authors of the Middle Ages [289] The earliest body of Welsh verse, by poets Taliesin and Aneirin, survive not in their original form, but in much-changed, medieval versions [289] Welsh poetry and native lore and learning survived through the era of the Poets of the Princes (c. 1100–1280) and then the Poets of the Gentry (c. 1350–1650) The former were professional poets who composed eulogies and elegies to their patrons while the latter favoured the cywydd metre [290] The period produced one of Wales's greatest poets, Dafydd ap Gwilym [291] After the Anglicisation of the gentry the tradition declined [290]\n\n\nMuseums and libraries\nAmgueddfa Cymru – Museum Wales was founded by royal charter in 1907 as the National Museum of Wales It operates at seven sites: National Museum Cardiff, St Fagans National History Museum, Big Pit National Coal Museum, National Wool Museum, National Slate Museum, National Roman Legion Museum, and the National Waterfront Museum Entry to all sites is free [300] The National Library of Wales, based in Aberystwyth, houses important collections of printed works, including the Sir John Williams Collection and the Shirburn Castle collection, [301] as well as art collections including portraits and photographs, ephemera and Ordnance Survey maps [301]\n\n\nVisual arts\nWorks of Celtic art have been found in Wales [302] In the Early Medieval period, the Celtic Christianity of Wales was part of the Insular art of the British Isles A number of illuminated manuscripts from Wales survive, including the 8th-century Hereford Gospels and Lichfield Gospels The 11th-century Ricemarch Psalter (now in Dublin) is certainly Welsh, made in St David's, and shows a late Insular style with unusual Viking influence [303]\n\n\nNational symbols and identity\nWales is regarded as a modern Celtic nation which contributes to its national identity, [30] [311] with Welsh artists regularly appearing at Celtic festivals [312] The red dragon is the principal symbol of national identity and pride, personifying the fearlessness of the Welsh nation [313] The dragon is first referenced in literature as a symbol of the people in the Historia Brittonum Vortigern (Welsh: Gwrtheyrn), King of the Celtic Britons, is interrupted while attempting to build a fort at Dinas Emrys He is told by Ambrosius [f] to dig up two dragons beneath the castle He discovers a red dragon representing the Celtic Britons, and a white dragon representing Anglo-Saxons Ambrosius prophesies that the Celtic Britons will reclaim the island and push the Anglo-Saxons back to the sea [315]\n\n\nSport\nMore than 50 national governing bodies regulate and organise their sports in Wales [335] Most of those involved in competitive sports select, organise and manage individuals or teams to represent their country at international events or fixtures against other countries Wales is represented at major world sporting events such as the FIFA World Cup, Rugby World Cup, Rugby League World Cup and the Commonwealth Games At the Olympic Games, Welsh athletes compete alongside those of Scotland, England and Northern Ireland as part of a Great Britain team Wales has hosted several international sporting events [336] These include the 1958 Commonwealth Games, [337] the 1999 Rugby World Cup, the 2010 Ryder Cup and the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final [336] [338]\n\n\nMedia\nWales became the UK's first digital television nation in 2010 [357] BBC Cymru Wales is the national broadcaster, [358] producing both television and radio programmes in Welsh and English [359] It has also produced programmes such as Life on Mars, Doctor Who and Torchwood for BBC's network audience across the United Kingdom [358] [360] ITV, the UK's main commercial broadcaster, has a Welsh-orientated service branded ITV Cymru Wales [361] S4C began broadcasting in 1982 Its output was mostly in Welsh at peak hours, but shared English-language content with Channel 4 at other times Since the digital switchover the channel has broadcast exclusively in Welsh [362] BBC Radio Cymru is the BBC's Welsh-language radio service, which broadcasts throughout Wales [358] A number of independent radio stations broadcast in the Welsh regions, predominantly in English In 2006, several regional radio stations broadcast in Welsh: output ranged from two two-minute news bulletins each weekday (Radio Maldwyn) to over 14 hours of Welsh-language programmes weekly (Swansea Sound) to essentially bilingual stations such as Heart Cymru and Radio Ceredigion [363]\n\n\nCuisine\nTraditional Welsh dishes include laverbread (made from Porphyra umbilicalis, an edible seaweed), bara brith (fruit bread), cawl (a lamb stew), cawl cennin (leek soup), and Welsh cakes [373] Cockles are sometimes served as a traditional breakfast with bacon and laverbread [374] Although Wales has its own traditional food and has absorbed much of the cuisine of England, Welsh diets now owe more to the countries of India, China and the United States Chicken tikka masala is the country's favourite dish, while hamburgers and Chinese food outsell fish and chips as takeaways [375]\n\n\nPerforming arts\nWales, \"the land of song\", is notable for its solo artists, its male voice choirs and its harpists [376] The annual National Eisteddfod is the country's main performance festival The Llangollen International Eisteddfod provides an opportunity for the singers and musicians of the world to perform The Welsh Folk Song Society publishes collections of historical songs and tunes [377] Traditional instruments of Wales include the telyn deires (triple harp), fiddle, crwth (bowed lyre) and the pibgorn (hornpipe) [378] Male voice choirs emerged in the 19th century, formed as the tenor and bass sections of chapel choirs, and embraced the popular secular hymns of the day [379] Welsh congregations and choirs were known for singing in a rousing four-voice style, becoming characteristic of the country [380] Many of the historic choirs survive in modern Wales, singing a mixture of traditional and popular songs [379]\n\n\nMusic and festivals\nWales, \"the land of song\", is notable for its solo artists, its male voice choirs and its harpists [376] The annual National Eisteddfod is the country's main performance festival The Llangollen International Eisteddfod provides an opportunity for the singers and musicians of the world to

congregations and choirs were known for singing in a rousing four-voice style, becoming characteristic of the country [380] Many of the historic choirs survive in modern Wales, singing a mixture of traditional and popular songs [379]\n\n\nDrama\nThe earliest surviving Welsh plays are two medieval miracle plays, Y Tri Brenin o Gwlen (\"The three Kings from Cologne\") and Y Dioddefaint a'r Atgyfodiad (\"The Passion and the Resurrection\") [387] A recognised Welsh tradition of theatre emerged during the 18th century, in the form of an interlude, a metrical play performed at fairs and markets [388] Drama in the early 20th century thrived, but the country established neither a Welsh National Theatre nor a national ballet company [389] After the Second World War, the substantial number of amateur theatre companies reduced by two-thirds [390] Competition from television in the mid-20th century led to greater professionalism in the theatre [390] Plays by Emlyn Williams and Alun Owen and others were staged, while Welsh actors, including Richard Burton and Anthony Hopkins, were establishing international reputations [390] [391] [392] Wales has also produced some well-known comedians [393]\n\n\nDance\nTraditional dances include Welsh folk dancing and clog dancing The first mention of dancing in Wales is in a 12th-century account by Giraldus Cambrensis, but by the 19th century traditional dance had all but died out due to religious opposition [389] In the 20th century a revival was led by Lois Blake (1890–1974) [389] Clog dancing was preserved and developed by Hywel Wood (1882–1967) and others who perpetuated the art on local and national stages [394] The Welsh Folk Dance Society was founded in 1949 [394] Contemporary dance grew out of Cardiff in the 1970s [394] The National Dance Company Wales, formed in 1983, is now resident at the Wales Millennium Centre [395]\n\n\nSee also\nCitations\n\n\nNotes\nCitations\n\n\nReferences\nCitations\n\n\nExternal

sister and two younger brothers [2] [3] [4] His father was of Italian descent and played semi-professional baseball before becoming a lawyer [2] His mother was a singer prior to meeting Scolari's father and later worked with the Alcohol Rehabilitation arm of the Tidewater Psychiatric Institute in Virginia Beach, Virginia [2] [4] In an interview with the Toronto Star Scolari said that his father was a psychologically abusive, \"rageful man\", and that his mother struggled with alcoholism [5] Scolari added that his parents \"stayed together for the kids and also because they were hopelessly in love with each other, but they were totally incompatible.\" [5]\n\n\nCareer\nCredited under pseudonym Barney Tramble, Scolari's first film role was in the 1978 X rated film Take Off [9]

called the Susan B Anthony Hotel [1] A different actor had initially been cast alongside Hanks, but things didn't work out [6] Scolari happened to be playing a guest role on an adjacent sound stage and was auditioned for the role [6] The show's pilot was shot a few days later [6] Scolari played Henry Desmond, whose female pseudonym was Hildegard, and Hanks played Kip Wilson, who went by the name Buffy [10] Bosom Buddies started out with good ratings, but failed to hold the public's interest and was canceled after two seasons and 37 episodes His next starring role was in the 1983 sitcom Baby

on 10 December, he ordered that any plague fatalities be dragged out with hooks and buried in a mass grave He also ordered Bucharest's health inspector, Archisatras, to give him routine reports on any signs of disease [63] The country's economic decline, worsened by months of Russian military occupation, [64] did not prevent Caradja from instituting new fiscal policies which the population at large perceived as absurdly harsh According to reports left by Caradja's enemy Manuc Bei, fiscal innovations were inaugurated by Caimacam Argyropoulos, who pressured Wallachian citizens into paying an additional contribution of 2.1 million piasters, claiming that these were upkeep they still owed to the Russian troops Manuc also claims that Caradja and Argyropoulos never paid their dues in this respect, keeping the money for themselves while also trading away the cattle and grain that had been nominally requisitioned by Russia [65] The policies were not fully endorsed by the Wallachian Vistier (treasurer) Grigore Brâncoveanu; within six months of office, Caradja had him replaced with a more compliant Constantin Filipescu [66] Brâncoveanu's ouster was in itself a highly unpopular gesture [67]\n\n\nPlague and aftermath\nBy mid-1813, Mahmud was focused on quashing the First Serbian Uprising, which was raging immediately to the west and south of Oltenia Caradja sent in some hundreds of his Wallachian militiamen, assisting the Ottoman army as it advanced down the Timok Valley, toward Negotin; together, these forces managed to defeat Hajduk Veljko in July 1813 [99] This campaign ran concurrently with the French invasion of Russia and the War of the Sixth Coalition, which drew Russia's attention away from the Ottoman Empire Enjoying his freedom to act, Mahmud ordered his troops to \"destroy all the inhabitants fit to carry arms\" Reportedly, Caradja intervened to warn the Porte that Russia was not yet defeated: \"Mahmoud caught the hint, his ferocious orders were countermanded, and the Servians   [sic] were spared.\" [100] His contribution to rescuing Serb civilians is \"attested by several sources.\" [14] Also in July 1813, the Prince began persecuting more Wallachian dissenters, including Grigore D Ghica and Constantin Bălăceanu, by having them sent into exile—the former internally, the latter to the more remote Kastoria [101] A Brâncoveanu associate, Iancu Cocorăscu, was sentenced to have his arms chopped off [102]\n\n\nLegiuirea lui Caragea\nAccording to historian Ioan C Filitti, Caradja's overall effort should be regarded as part of a Phanariote drive to affirm equality before the law and individualism [130] The Prince's views on law and taxation were codified into the updated version of Wallachia's statutory law, published in 1818 and known thereafter as Legiuirea lui Caragea (\"Caradja's Law\") The work was primarily an attempt at synthesizing Byzantine law and local customs, defining the relations between these two sources According to Dăscălescu, the result was mediocre, though not entirely pointless \"had here been someone to apply them properly\" [131] Historian Constantin Iordachi proposes that, in its function as a compilation of private law, Caradja's text was mainly based on the modernizing Napoleonic Code, though still maintaining \"an uneven combination on enlightened principles and medieval privileges.\" [132] Literary scholar Nicolae Liu similarly notes that Caradja shared the Enlightenment's ambition \"of achieving the 'common good' or 'general welfare' by legislative means\"; he underscores that Legiuirea, along with other codes of the era, \"intended to impose the image of certain Phanariote princes as 'trustees of the country' with a paternalistic regard for the people\" [133]\n\n\nBoyar nationalism\nDuring the secondary plague outbreaks, Caradja and his court left Bucharest for the nearby village of Ciorogârla, which consequently became known as Ciorogârla Domnească or Domnești (from domn, \"prince\"; see Domnitor); he was often described as a likely ktitor of the local Paraschiva Church, though this was more likely built decades before his reign [152] Also in 1815, there was an attempted revolt by the Pandurs of Oltenia [153] During November of that year, Prussian diplomat Ludwig Senfft von Pilsach noted Caradja's optimism, which contrasted the \"restless and skittish passion\" of his supervisors at the Porte This referred to Caradja's belief that European peace would be secured by the Treaty of Paris [154] Ledoulx writes that Caradja was enthusiastic about Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo, and celebrated it by dressing up a mannequin in Grande Armée uniform, which his servants used as a football [155]\n\n\nAppeasement versus opulence\nThe court itself continued to parade its opulence—in late 1817, Caradja's first-born son, Beizadea Konstantinos, created a stir by driving around in a deer-drawn sled which was decorated to resemble Apollo's fiery chariot [176] In late 1813, John had made him administrator of Ploiești city and its Romani encampments, which provided him with an annual income of over 200 thousand piasters [177] All men of the princely family became known for their decadent morals: Konstantinos was a serial seducer, forcing his wife Raluca Moruzzi to file for divorce; John himself would send his court dignitaries on \"faraway missions\", then forced himself on their wives [178] Such behavior scandalized an English physician, William Mac Michael In January 1818, he reported that the Prince's second son, Beizadea Georgios, introduced his mother and sisters to his Wallachian mistress, who had deserted her husband and six children to obtain that position [179] Georgios was married to Smaragda, a member of the Rosetti Phanariotes (daughter of Dragoman Nicholas), having spent over 8,000 silver francs as alms during their wedding ceremony [180] Merișescu reports that another one of Caradja's young relatives, Dimitri, married a promiscuous boyaress, Zoe Băleanu, whom he took to his villa in Therapia—where he was serving as Wallachia's emissary, or Kapucu [181]\n\n\nBetween Karađorđe and Kapodistrias\nCiting earlier pronouncements made by Andrei Oțetea, Ionașcu argues that Caradja's slashing of tax bills was duplicitous, \"meant to encumber his successor on the throne with a heavy burden and to leave the somewhat relieved popular masses with the memory of a reign that had been good for the country's finances.\" [203] Documents from 1818–1819 provide a unique record of Wallachia's budgetary expenditures, which were driven up by the haraç and other Ottoman fiscal instruments, totaling 2 million thalers, alongside undisclosed sums in presents and bribes; the national revenue, meanwhile, was 5.9 million thalers [204] In documenting the Prince's rapacity for Manuc, Filipescu contended that Caradja had taken almost 10 million piasters in bribes These included 25,000 from Hagi Stănuță, who wanted to preserve his lease on the textile mill of Mărcuța (though Caradja still sold off the rights to other bidders, in August 1817) [205] Langeron claims that, overall, Caradja had \"squeezed that unfortunate province  [of Wallachia]\" of 93 million piasters, or 50 million rubles, of which he kept 18 million; 70 million \"went over to the sultan, to his ministers, and to the Phanariotes\" [206] Manuc argued that the sum was much much smaller, though still surpassing the 14 million piasters that were accounted for with receipts [207]\n\n\nLater life\nOn the evening of 29 September (11 October) 1818, after having attended the funeral ceremony of Ban Radu Golescu, [225] Caradja took his family on a what appeared to be a leisurely carriage trip outside Bucharest Instead, they fled for the Transylvanian city of Kronstadt, alongside 300 of their Arnaut guard [226] According to a period testimony by the Russian agent Pavel Liprandi, they narrowly escaped Pandur retribution: Vladimirescu wanted to ambush the princely caravan as it entered Transylvania; however, his plan was foiled by Olympios, who, instead of helping with the ambush, escorted Caradja to safety [227] Pini also allegedly played a part, having \"received great sums of money to facilitate this escape.\" [228] The Caradjas' drive into Austria required tacit consent from Metternich, who granted them asylum, [229] as well as the use of forged papers [230] The Prince allegedly asked both Austria and Russia for a resident's permit Metternich refused to \"compromise  [Austria] in front of the Sublime Porte\", while Emperor Alexander only responded that he needed time to reflect on the issue [231]\n\n\nEscape from Wallachia\nOn the evening of 29 September (11 October) 1818, after having attended the funeral ceremony of Ban Radu Golescu, [225] Caradja took his family on a what appeared to be a leisurely carriage trip outside Bucharest Instead, they fled for the Transylvanian city of Kronstadt, alongside 300 of their Arnaut guard [226] According to a period testimony by the Russian agent Pavel Liprandi, they narrowly escaped Pandur retribution: Vladimirescu wanted to ambush the princely caravan as it entered Transylvania;

[258] he probably never intended to follow up on this invitation, but in any case he would have been prevented to do so by the Austrian authorities, who issued orders to stop him at the border [259] Instead, he financed the nationalist and Philhellene movement, forming a war aid society in Tuscany, funding Jean-Gabriel Eynard's similar venture in Geneva, and sending regular gifts to fighters such as Georgios Karaiskakis, Theodoros Kolokotronis, and Andreas Miaoulis [260] On 14 March 1821, Beizadea Georgios took his family out of Istanbul, narrowly escaping the anti-Greek massacre [261] and reaching the Russian port of Odessa in April [262] His brother Konstantinos was one of the few Wallachian Phanariotes to join in the fighting, sailing to Morea Eyalet alongside the Moldavian Teodor Negri Once there, he united his efforts with his Mavrokordatos cousin, who also represented Prince John and the Pisans [263]\n\n\nLegacy\nHistorian Paul Cernovodeanu provides an overview of Caradja's political legacy: he notes that, unlike his uncle Nicholas, who enjoyed a sound reputation in Wallachian literary sources, John was vilified and cursed as the \"great predator\" This image was codified first by Dionisie Eclesiarhul, and later by Ion Ghica [287] Romanian folklore had coined the saying \"thefts as in Karadzas' time\" (Patrinelis' rendition) [288] This depiction is also found in pamphlets put out by several Wallachian boyars, including an 1818 piece by Iordache Golescu, advertised as \"published at the expense of those who are still left with some money\" [289] In 1959, critic Radu Albala revisited Golescu's account, noting: \"its details on the savage taxation and exploitation  [by Caradja] are funny in that bitter way, their humor thick as well as irresistible.\" [290] A similar work, tentatively attributed to Naum Râmniceanu, inflamed passions by suggesting that Caradja and Ștefan Bellu wanted to set up a \"New Greece\" in Wallachia, which required them to decimate the boyar population [291] Unusually, a hill called Karadjaua or Carageaua is found outside Sănduleni in Western Moldavia The claim that it commemorates Prince John was seen as baseless by Constantin Jean Karadja [292]\n\n\n\"Great predator\" and cultural patron\nHistorian Paul Cernovodeanu provides an overview of Caradja's political legacy: he notes that, unlike his uncle Nicholas, who enjoyed a sound reputation in Wallachian literary sources, John was vilified and cursed as the \"great predator\" This image was codified first by Dionisie Eclesiarhul, and later by Ion Ghica [287] Romanian folklore had coined the saying \"thefts as in Karadzas' time\" (Patrinelis' rendition) [288] This depiction is also found in pamphlets put out by several Wallachian boyars, including an 1818 piece by Iordache Golescu, advertised as \"published at the expense of those who are still left with some money\" [289] In 1959, critic Radu Albala revisited Golescu's account, noting: \"its details on the savage taxation and exploitation  [by Caradja] are funny in that bitter way, their humor thick as well as irresistible.\" [290] A similar work, tentatively attributed to Naum Râmniceanu, inflamed passions by suggesting that Caradja and Ștefan Bellu wanted to set up a \"New Greece\" in Wallachia, which required them to decimate the boyar population [291] Unusually, a hill called Karadjaua or Carageaua is found outside Sănduleni in Western Moldavia The claim that it commemorates Prince John was seen as baseless by Constantin Jean Karadja [292]\n\n\nPosterity\nAthens' National Historical Museum preserves an anonymous drawing showing Caradja, in his Pisan period, with Eleni Argyropoulos, his young granddaughter [311] Her mother Rallou died in 1870 at Thonberg, in the Kingdom of Saxony, [312] two years after her sister Roxani;

His reign was marked by significant events, including the First Serbian Uprising and the Greek War of Independence. This article provides an overview of his life, rule, and legacy.\n\n**Biography**\n\nAccording to various accounts, the Caradja family originated in the Republic of Ragusa, the Beylik of Karaman, or the Despotate of Epirus. The name is Turkic and means \"roe,\" indicating the family's possible Asiatic origin. John's great-grandson, Constantin Jean Karadja, proposed that the first family was first attested in the 11th century when an Argyros Karatzas served the Byzantine Empire as Duke of Dyrrhachium. He sees him and other early Karatzas as Hellenized Pechenegs. Another historian, C G Patrinelis, sees the clan as probably Karamanlid. Supporting the Epirote or generically Greek hypothesis, authors such as Panagiotis Soutsos and Epaminonda Stamatiade believe that they acquired their aristocratic rank and surname while serving in the Crimean Khanate.\n\n**Early Life and Career**\n\nJohn Caradja was born in 1773 in the Phanariote community, a group of Greek aristocrats who served as rulers in the Danubian Principalities. His family was known for their influence and power in the region. John's early life and career are not well documented, but it is known that he was educated in the traditions of the Phanariotes and was trained in the art of governance.\n\n**Rule**\n\nJohn Caradja's rule was marked by significant events, including the First Serbian Uprising and the Greek War of Independence. In 1812, he was appointed to rule Wallachia, a position he held until 1818. His rule was marked by a series of reforms aimed at modernizing the country and improving its economy. He also implemented a new fiscal regime, which was perceived as harsh by the population.\n\n**Fiscal Regime and State Terror**\n\nInitially, Caradja was successful in blocking out the Eastern plague, which during 1812 only touched Teleorman County. However, the country's economic decline, worsened by months of Russian military occupation, did not prevent Caradja from instituting new fiscal policies that were perceived as absurdly harsh.

This depiction is also found in pamphlets put out by several Wallachian boyars, including an 1818 piece by Iordache Golescu, advertised as \"published at the expense of those who are still left with some money.\"\n\n**Posterity**\n\nAthens' National Historical Museum preserves an anonymous drawing showing Caradja, in his Pisan period, with Eleni Argyropoulos, his young granddaughter.

on 10 December, he ordered that any plague fatalities be dragged out with hooks and buried in a mass grave He also ordered Bucharest's health inspector, Archisatras, to give him routine reports on any signs of disease [63] The country's economic decline, worsened by months of Russian military occupation, [64] did not prevent Caradja from instituting new fiscal policies which the population at large perceived as absurdly harsh According to reports left by Caradja's enemy Manuc Bei, fiscal innovations were inaugurated by Caimacam Argyropoulos, who pressured Wallachian citizens into paying an additional contribution of 2.1 million piasters, claiming that these were upkeep they still owed to the Russian troops Manuc also claims that Caradja and Argyropoulos never paid their dues in this respect, keeping the money for themselves while also trading away the cattle and grain that had been nominally requisitioned by Russia [65] The policies were not fully endorsed by the Wallachian Vistier (treasurer) Grigore Brâncoveanu; within six months of office, Caradja had him replaced with a more compliant Constantin Filipescu [66] Brâncoveanu's ouster was in itself a highly unpopular gesture [67]\n\n\nPlague and aftermath\nBy mid-1813, Mahmud was focused on quashing the First Serbian Uprising, which was raging immediately to the west and south of Oltenia Caradja sent in some hundreds of his Wallachian militiamen, assisting the Ottoman army as it advanced down the Timok Valley, toward Negotin; together, these forces managed to defeat Hajduk Veljko in July 1813 [99] This campaign ran concurrently with the French invasion of Russia and the War of the Sixth Coalition, which drew Russia's attention away from the Ottoman Empire Enjoying his freedom to act, Mahmud ordered his troops to \"destroy all the inhabitants fit to carry arms\" Reportedly, Caradja intervened to warn the Porte that Russia was not yet defeated: \"Mahmoud caught the hint, his ferocious orders were countermanded, and the Servians   [sic] were spared.\" [100] His contribution to rescuing Serb civilians is \"attested by several sources.\" [14] Also in July 1813, the Prince began persecuting more Wallachian dissenters, including Grigore D Ghica and Constantin Bălăceanu, by having them sent into exile—the former internally, the latter to the more remote Kastoria [101] A Brâncoveanu associate, Iancu Cocorăscu, was sentenced to have his arms chopped off [102]\n\n\nLegiuirea lui Caragea\nAccording to historian Ioan C Filitti, Caradja's overall effort should be regarded as part of a Phanariote drive to affirm equality before the law and individualism [130] The Prince's views on law and taxation were codified into the updated version of Wallachia's statutory law, published in 1818 and known thereafter as Legiuirea lui Caragea (\"Caradja's Law\") The work was primarily an attempt at synthesizing Byzantine law and local customs, defining the relations between these two sources According to Dăscălescu, the result was mediocre, though not entirely pointless \"had here been someone to apply them properly\" [131] Historian Constantin Iordachi proposes that, in its function as a compilation of private law, Caradja's text was mainly based on the modernizing Napoleonic Code, though still maintaining \"an uneven combination on enlightened principles and medieval privileges.\" [132] Literary scholar Nicolae Liu similarly notes that Caradja shared the Enlightenment's ambition \"of achieving the 'common good' or 'general welfare' by legislative means\"; he underscores that Legiuirea, along with other codes of the era, \"intended to impose the image of certain Phanariote princes as 'trustees of the country' with a paternalistic regard for the people\" [133]\n\n\nBoyar nationalism\nDuring the secondary plague outbreaks, Caradja and his court left Bucharest for the nearby village of Ciorogârla, which consequently became known as Ciorogârla Domnească or Domnești (from domn, \"prince\"; see Domnitor); he was often described as a likely ktitor of the local Paraschiva Church, though this was more likely built decades before his reign [152] Also in 1815, there was an attempted revolt by the Pandurs of Oltenia [153] During November of that year, Prussian diplomat Ludwig Senfft von Pilsach noted Caradja's optimism, which contrasted the \"restless and skittish passion\" of his supervisors at the Porte This referred to Caradja's belief that European peace would be secured by the Treaty of Paris [154] Ledoulx writes that Caradja was enthusiastic about Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo, and celebrated it by dressing up a mannequin in Grande Armée uniform, which his servants used as a football [155]\n\n\nAppeasement versus opulence\nThe court itself continued to parade its opulence—in late 1817, Caradja's first-born son, Beizadea Konstantinos, created a stir by driving around in a deer-drawn sled which was decorated to resemble Apollo's fiery chariot [176] In late 1813, John had made him administrator of Ploiești city and its Romani encampments, which provided him with an annual income of over 200 thousand piasters [177] All men of the princely family became known for their decadent morals: Konstantinos was a serial seducer, forcing his wife Raluca Moruzzi to file for divorce; John himself would send his court dignitaries on \"faraway missions\", then forced himself on their wives [178] Such behavior scandalized an English physician, William Mac Michael In January 1818, he reported that the Prince's second son, Beizadea Georgios, introduced his mother and sisters to his Wallachian mistress, who had deserted her husband and six children to obtain that position [179] Georgios was married to Smaragda, a member of the Rosetti Phanariotes (daughter of Dragoman Nicholas), having spent over 8,000 silver francs as alms during their wedding ceremony [180] Merișescu reports that another one of Caradja's young relatives, Dimitri, married a promiscuous boyaress, Zoe Băleanu, whom he took to his villa in Therapia—where he was serving as Wallachia's emissary, or Kapucu [181]\n\n\nBetween Karađorđe and Kapodistrias\nCiting earlier pronouncements made by Andrei Oțetea, Ionașcu argues that Caradja's slashing of tax bills was duplicitous, \"meant to encumber his successor on the throne with a heavy burden and to leave the somewhat relieved popular masses with the memory of a reign that had been good for the country's finances.\" [203] Documents from 1818–1819 provide a unique record of Wallachia's budgetary expenditures, which were driven up by the haraç and other Ottoman fiscal instruments, totaling 2 million thalers, alongside undisclosed sums in presents and bribes; the national revenue, meanwhile, was 5.9 million thalers [204] In documenting the Prince's rapacity for Manuc, Filipescu contended that Caradja had taken almost 10 million piasters in bribes These included 25,000 from Hagi Stănuță, who wanted to preserve his lease on the textile mill of Mărcuța (though Caradja still sold off the rights to other bidders, in August 1817) [205] Langeron claims that, overall, Caradja had \"squeezed that unfortunate province  [of Wallachia]\" of 93 million piasters, or 50 million rubles, of which he kept 18 million; 70 million \"went over to the sultan, to his ministers, and to the Phanariotes\" [206] Manuc argued that the sum was much much smaller, though still surpassing the 14 million piasters that were accounted for with receipts [207]\n\n\nLater life\nOn the evening of 29 September (11 October) 1818, after having attended the funeral ceremony of Ban Radu Golescu, [225] Caradja took his family on a what appeared to be a leisurely carriage trip outside Bucharest Instead, they fled for the Transylvanian city of Kronstadt, alongside 300 of their Arnaut guard [226] According to a period testimony by the Russian agent Pavel Liprandi, they narrowly escaped Pandur retribution: Vladimirescu wanted to ambush the princely caravan as it entered Transylvania; however, his plan was foiled by Olympios, who, instead of helping with the ambush, escorted Caradja to safety [227] Pini also allegedly played a part, having \"received great sums of money to facilitate this escape.\" [228] The Caradjas' drive into Austria required tacit consent from Metternich, who granted them asylum, [229] as well as the use of forged papers [230] The Prince allegedly asked both Austria and Russia for a resident's permit Metternich refused to \"compromise  [Austria] in front of the Sublime Porte\", while Emperor Alexander only responded that he needed time to reflect on the issue [231]\n\n\nEscape from Wallachia\nOn the evening of 29 September (11 October) 1818, after having attended the funeral ceremony of Ban Radu Golescu, [225] Caradja took his family on a what appeared to be a leisurely carriage trip outside Bucharest Instead, they fled for the Transylvanian city of Kronstadt, alongside 300 of their Arnaut guard [226] According to a period testimony by the Russian agent Pavel Liprandi, they narrowly escaped Pandur retribution: Vladimirescu wanted to ambush the princely caravan as it entered Transylvania;

[258] he probably never intended to follow up on this invitation, but in any case he would have been prevented to do so by the Austrian authorities, who issued orders to stop him at the border [259] Instead, he financed the nationalist and Philhellene movement, forming a war aid society in Tuscany, funding Jean-Gabriel Eynard's similar venture in Geneva, and sending regular gifts to fighters such as Georgios Karaiskakis, Theodoros Kolokotronis, and Andreas Miaoulis [260] On 14 March 1821, Beizadea Georgios took his family out of Istanbul, narrowly escaping the anti-Greek massacre [261] and reaching the Russian port of Odessa in April [262] His brother Konstantinos was one of the few Wallachian Phanariotes to join in the fighting, sailing to Morea Eyalet alongside the Moldavian Teodor Negri Once there, he united his efforts with his Mavrokordatos cousin, who also represented Prince John and the Pisans [263]\n\n\nLegacy\nHistorian Paul Cernovodeanu provides an overview of Caradja's political legacy: he notes that, unlike his uncle Nicholas, who enjoyed a sound reputation in Wallachian literary sources, John was vilified and cursed as the \"great predator\" This image was codified first by Dionisie Eclesiarhul, and later by Ion Ghica [287] Romanian folklore had coined the saying \"thefts as in Karadzas' time\" (Patrinelis' rendition) [288] This depiction is also found in pamphlets put out by several Wallachian boyars, including an 1818 piece by Iordache Golescu, advertised as \"published at the expense of those who are still left with some money\" [289] In 1959, critic Radu Albala revisited Golescu's account, noting: \"its details on the savage taxation and exploitation  [by Caradja] are funny in that bitter way, their humor thick as well as irresistible.\" [290] A similar work, tentatively attributed to Naum Râmniceanu, inflamed passions by suggesting that Caradja and Ștefan Bellu wanted to set up a \"New Greece\" in Wallachia, which required them to decimate the boyar population [291] Unusually, a hill called Karadjaua or Carageaua is found outside Sănduleni in Western Moldavia The claim that it commemorates Prince John was seen as baseless by Constantin Jean Karadja [292]\n\n\n\"Great predator\" and cultural patron\nHistorian Paul Cernovodeanu provides an overview of Caradja's political legacy: he notes that, unlike his uncle Nicholas, who enjoyed a sound reputation in Wallachian literary sources, John was vilified and cursed as the \"great predator\" This image was codified first by Dionisie Eclesiarhul, and later by Ion Ghica [287] Romanian folklore had coined the saying \"thefts as in Karadzas' time\" (Patrinelis' rendition) [288] This depiction is also found in pamphlets put out by several Wallachian boyars, including an 1818 piece by Iordache Golescu, advertised as \"published at the expense of those who are still left with some money\" [289] In 1959, critic Radu Albala revisited Golescu's account, noting: \"its details on the savage taxation and exploitation  [by Caradja] are funny in that bitter way, their humor thick as well as irresistible.\" [290] A similar work, tentatively attributed to Naum Râmniceanu, inflamed passions by suggesting that Caradja and Ștefan Bellu wanted to set up a \"New Greece\" in Wallachia, which required them to decimate the boyar population [291] Unusually, a hill called Karadjaua or Carageaua is found outside Sănduleni in Western Moldavia The claim that it commemorates Prince John was seen as baseless by Constantin Jean Karadja [292]\n\n\nPosterity\nAthens' National Historical Museum preserves an anonymous drawing showing Caradja, in his Pisan period, with Eleni Argyropoulos, his young granddaughter [311] Her mother Rallou died in 1870 at Thonberg, in the Kingdom of Saxony, [312] two years after her sister Roxani; [23] by then, Eleni had married Baron de Rouen, who served as France's Ambassador in Greece [313] Two Caradja or Karatzas branches have emerged from John's two sons Konstantinos turned to support the Ottoman Empire, serving as its Ambassador to Holland, where he died in 1860; the same position was later filled by his son, Jean Karadja Pasha [314] His descendants continued to reside in Wallachia and the successor Kingdom of Romania They produced Jean Pasha's half-Swedish son, Constantin Jean, [315] who, in his parallel work as a historian, published and prefaced the Caradja–Kapodistrias correspondence in 1921 [316] He also argued for using \"Karadja\" as the family surname, noting that the Romanianized \"Caragea\" no longer showed its origins [317] Georgios' line was continued by his son Aristides (1830–1890), who served on the Supreme Court of Greece [318] It includes another Georgios Karatzas, who was the Greek Ambassador to Switzerland [319] Through his daughter Smaragda, the Prince had grandson Spyridon Mavrogenis, the medical scholar, and great-grandson Alexandros Mavrogenis, who was Ottoman Ambassador to the United States [320]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
