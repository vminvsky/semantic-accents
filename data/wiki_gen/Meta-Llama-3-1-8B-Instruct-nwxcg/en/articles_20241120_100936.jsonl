safely [2] Artifacts called angreal amplify the One Power, with sa'angreal being the most potent, and ter'angreal limited to specific functions [3]\n\n\nGeography and cultures\nThe primary continent depicted in the series consists of three regions: the Westlands, Shara far to the east, and the Aiel Waste in between Connecting these three areas in the north is the eastern part of the Great Blight, a once-verdant land mass that has been corrupted by the Dark One's influence It stretches far west across the Aryth Ocean and borders the north of the continent of Seanchan South of the Westlands is the Sea of Storms, and the small continent known as the Land of the Madmen [7] The Westlands contain 14 nations, including Andor, Cairhien, Illian, Shienar and Tear, [8] [9] [10] as well as four major city-states: Falme, Far Madding, Mayene and Tar Valon [8] [11] Other notable cities include Caemlyn, the capital of Andor, [8] and Fal Dara, the northernmost city in Shienar [10] Two Rivers is a region in Andor which includes the village Emond's Field, home of five of the series' main characters [7] Shara, which extends much further south than either the Westlands or the Aiel Waste, is separated from the rest of the continent by the Cliffs of the Dawn and the Great Rift Shara remains mysterious to outsiders, who are only allowed to enter walled-off towns to trade [7] The world in which the series is set is sometimes called \"Randland\" by fans, referring to lead character Rand al'Thor [12]\n\n\nThe Dark One\nHumans seduced by promises of power and immortality to serve the Dark One are known as Darkfriends [21] The increasing influence of the Dark One has also introduced an array of creatures called Shadowspawn Trollocs are brutal, humanoid monsters with animal senses who kill with pleasure and eat all meat, including humans They are led by the Myrddraal, or Fades, terrifying and deadly creatures without eyes who can disappear in shadow but will not cross running water Appearing human and designed to target channelers, gholam are constructs which possess superhuman strength, are impervious to harm and immune to the One Power, and feed on blood Grey Men, or the Soulless, are humans who have sacrificed their souls to become drab assassins with the ability to pass completely unnoticed Draghkar are flying, vampiric creatures that devour the souls of their prey Darkhounds are otherworldly, doglike beasts the size of small horses, with acidic, poison saliva They regenerate when wounded or dismembered, and can only be destroyed by balefire, a weapon of the One Power which erases the target from existence, retroactively through time [22]\n\n\nBackstory\nIn the backstory of the series, the Wheel of Time and the universe were forged at the dawn of time by a deity known as the Creator, simultaneously imprisoning its antithesis, the Dark One The One Power itself is divided into both male (saidin) and female (saidar) halves, and originally both genders could wield it In the Age of Legends, the Aes Sedai was made up of both men and women who could channel An Aes Sedai experiment inadvertently drilled what would become known as the Bore into the Dark One's prison, and his influence began to seep out into the world In response to the threat of his eventual release, the Wheel produced the Dragon, Lews Therin Telamon, a channeler of immense power Lews eventually rose to command the Aes Sedai and their allies in the struggle against the Dark One's forces Seven Seals were created, made of an unbreakable substance called cuendillar, to be used as focus points to reseal the Dark One's prison for good Lews and a host of 99 male channelers managed to imprison the Forsaken with their master, but at the moment of victory, the Dark One was able to taint saidin, driving male channelers insane Lews killed his friends and family, and then himself Other male channelers devastated the world with earthquakes and tidal waves, an event called the Breaking of the World, before destroying themselves The female Aes Sedai guided humanity out of this dark time, living in the shadow of a prophecy that the Dark One would break free from his prison and the Dragon would be reborn to fight him once more And though the Dragon Reborn is humanity's only hope against the Dark One, he would break the world a second time in the process [2] [4] [26]\n\n\nPlot\nIn The Eye of the World (1990), the arrival of a mysterious noblewoman to the remote village of Emond's Field in the Two Rivers precedes an attack on the town by a force of humanoid monsters called Trollocs The woman reveals herself to be Moiraine Damodred, one of the Aes Sedai, and warns that the servants of the Dark One are seeking one of three young men from the village: Rand al'Thor, Perrin Aybara and Matrim Cauthon They leave with Moiraine and her companion, the Warder Lan Mandragoran, and are joined by Egwene al'Vere, in whom Moiraine sees a potential Aes Sedai; the gleeman Thom Merrilin; and later the Wisdom Nynaeve al'Meara, a healer who learns she can also channel the One Power They are pursued by increasing numbers of Trollocs, led by deadly, eyeless Fades,

written by American author Robert Jordan, which has become one of the best-selling epic fantasy series of all time. The series is set in a sprawling, detailed world where magic, politics, and mythology are deeply intertwined. The story follows a diverse cast of characters as they navigate a complex web of fate, destiny, and the struggle between good and evil.\n\n**Setting**\n\nThe series is set in the Third Age of a fantasy world, where the pattern of human existence is determined and maintained by the Wheel of Time, a cosmic embodiment of eternal return. The Wheel spins the Pattern of the Ages, manifest in both the physical world and human destiny, using the lives of men and women as its threads, and individuals with the power to influence and change the Pattern are called ta'veren. The Wheel is rotated by a magical force called the One Power, which can be accessed and wielded by women, known as channelers. Artifacts called angreal amplify the One Power, with sa'angreal being the most potent, and ter'angreal limited to specific functions.\n\n**Geography and Cultures**\n\nThe primary continent depicted in the series consists of three regions: the Westlands, Shara far to the east, and the Aiel Waste in between. Connecting these three areas in the north is the eastern part of the Great Blight, a once-verdant land mass that has been corrupted by the Dark One's influence. It stretches far west across the Aryth Ocean and borders the north of the continent of Seanchan. South of the Westlands is the Sea of Storms, and the small continent known as the Land of the Madmen.\n\nThe Westlands contain 14 nations, including Andor, Cairhien, Illian, Shienar, and Tear, as well as four major city-states: Falme, Far Madding, Mayene, and Tar Valon. Other notable cities include Caemlyn, the capital of Andor, and Fal Dara, the northernmost city in Shienar. Two Rivers is a region in Andor which includes the village Emond's Field, home of five of the series' main characters. Shara, which extends much further south than either the Westlands or the Aiel Waste, is separated from the rest of the continent by the Cliffs of the Dawn and the Great Rift. Shara remains mysterious to outsiders, who are only allowed to enter walled-off towns to trade.\n\n**The Dark One**\n\nHumans seduced by promises of power and immortality to serve the Dark One are known as Darkfriends. The increasing influence of the Dark One has also introduced an array of creatures called Shadowspawn. Trollocs are brutal, humanoid monsters with animal senses who kill with pleasure and eat all meat, including humans. They are led by the Myrddraal, or Fades, terrifying and deadly creatures without eyes who can disappear in shadow but will not cross running water. Appearing human and designed to target channelers, gholam are constructs which possess superhuman strength, are impervious to harm and immune to the One Power, and feed on blood. Grey Men, or the Soulless, are humans who have sacrificed their souls to become drab assassins with the ability to pass completely unnoticed. Draghkar are flying, vampiric creatures that devour the souls of their prey. Darkhounds are otherworldly, doglike beasts the size of small horses, with acidic, poison saliva. They regenerate when wounded or dismembered, and can only be destroyed by balefire, a weapon of the One Power which erases the target from existence, retroactively through time.\n\n**Backstory**\n\nIn the backstory of the series, the Wheel of Time and the universe were forged at the dawn of time by a deity known as the Creator, simultaneously imprisoning its antithesis, the Dark One. The One Power itself is divided into both male (saidin) and female (saidar) halves, and originally both genders could wield it. In the Age of Legends, the Aes Sedai was made up of both men and women who could channel. An Aes Sedai experiment inadvertently drilled what would become known as the Bore into the Dark One's prison, and his influence began to seep out into the world. In response to the threat of his eventual release, the Wheel produced the Dragon, Lews Therin Telamon, a channeler of immense power. Lews eventually rose to command the Aes Sedai and their allies in the struggle against the Dark One's forces. Seven Seals were created, made of an unbreakable substance called cuendillar, to be used as focus points to reseal the Dark One's prison for good. Lews and a host of 99 male channelers managed to imprison the Forsaken with their master, but at the moment of victory, the Dark One was able to taint saidin, driving male channelers insane. Lews killed his friends and family, and then himself. Other male channelers devastated the world with earthquakes and tidal waves, an event called the Breaking of the World, before destroying themselves. The female Aes Sedai guided humanity out of this dark time, living in the shadow of a prophecy that the Dark One would break free from his prison and the Dragon would be reborn to fight him once more.\n\n**Plot**\n\nIn The Eye of the World (1990), the arrival of a mysterious noblewoman to the remote village of Emond's Field in the Two Rivers precedes an attack on the town by a force of humanoid monsters called Trollocs. The woman reveals herself to be Moiraine Damodred, one of the Aes Sedai, and warns that the servants of the Dark One are seeking one of three young men from the village: Rand al'Thor, Perrin Aybara, and Matrim Cauthon. They leave with Moiraine and her companion, the Warder Lan Mandragoran, and are joined by Egwene al'Vere, in whom Moiraine sees a potential Aes Sedai; the gleeman Thom Merrilin; and later the Wisdom Nynaeve al'Meara, a healer who learns she can also channel the One Power. They are pursued by increasing numbers of Trollocs, led by deadly, eyeless Fades, and are separated fleeing the cursed, abandoned city of Shadar Logoth. At the Eye of the World, a sacred pool of untainted saidin, Rand's defeat of the Forsaken Aginor and Ba'alzamon convinces Moiraine that he is the prophesied Dragon Reborn.\n\n**Novels**\n\nThe series consists of 14 main novels, which were published between 1990 and 2013. The novels are: The Eye of the World (1990), The Great Hunt (1990), The Dragon Reborn (1991), The Shadow Rising (1992), The Fires of Heaven (1993), Lord of Chaos (1994), A Crown of Swords (1996), The Path of Daggers (1998), Winter's Heart (2000), Crossroads of Twilight (2002), Knife of Dreams (2003), The Gathering Storm (2009), Towers of Midnight (2010), and A Memory of Light (2013).\n\n**Development**\n\nRobert Jordan began writing The Eye of the World in 1984 and did not finish it until late 1988 or early 1989, with characters and storylines changing considerably during the writing process. Initially, the story was going to be centered on an older man who discovered relatively late in life that he was the 'chosen one' who had to save the world. However, Jordan decided to move closer to the tone and style of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Fellowship of the Ring, and made the characters younger and less experienced.\n\n**Writing and Conception**\n\nJordan started writing The Eye of the World in 1984 and did not finish it until late 1988 or early 1989, with characters and storylines changing considerably during the writing process.

As the Wheel of Time turned, the past, the present, and the future all existed at the same time. One moment in time, one moment in the past or one moment in the future, could be any point in the circular pattern of the Wheel of Time.\"\n\n**Derivative Works**\n\nRobert Jordan wrote two short stories within the franchise in the late 1990s. The first, \"The Strike at Shayol Ghul\", predates the main series by several thousand years.

in December 2005, [79] and while he intended to finish at least A Memory of Light even if the \"worse comes to worst,\" [80] he made preparations in case he was not able to complete the book: \"I'm getting out notes, so if the worst actually happens, someone could finish A Memory of Light and have it end the way I want it to end.\" [78]\n\n\nAfter A Memory of Light\nPrior to his death, Jordan had often discussed adding an additional two prequels and an 'outrigger' sequel trilogy In a Q&A following the release of A Memory of Light, Sanderson ruled out the completion of these works; Jordan had left very little in the way of notes for these additional novels – only two sentences in the case of the sequel trilogy [90] Sanderson addressed the subject again in a 2023 blog post, and stated that writing additional Wheel of Time works would have gone against the wishes of Robert Jordan [91]\n\n\nThemes and influences\nThe Wheel of Time is a novel from the modern fantasy genre, specifically high fantasy The book is set in a world that is simultaneously the distant past and distant future of the real world, as a result of time being cyclical rather than linear The opening of the first book establishes the concept:\n\n\nDerivative works\nJordan wrote two short stories within the franchise in the late 1990s The first, \"The Strike at Shayol Ghul\", predates the main series by several thousand years It was made available on the Internet and was later published in The World of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time [102] Jordan also wrote a short story entitled \"New Spring\", for the 1998 anthology Legends edited by Robert Silverberg Jordan later expanded this into the stand-alone novel New Spring that was published in January 2004.\n\n\nShort stories\nJordan wrote two

to errors of bias and guesswork [105]\n\n\nComic books\nIn 2004, Jordan sold the film, television, video game, and comic rights to the series to production company Red Eagle Entertainment [109] Dabel

[118]\n\n\nTelevision and film\nIn a 2000 chat on CNN.com, Robert Jordan mentioned that NBC had purchased an option to do a miniseries of The Eye of the World [123] But he expressed doubts that the series would be made stating \"key people involved in getting that contract together have left NBC.\" [124] The series was optioned by Universal Pictures in 2008 for film adaptations, with plans to

regarding the same and said: \"In the wake of the ongoing reports of a legal case filed against the makers of the upcoming film 83, on behalf of Vibri Media, we would like to deny the claims of the complainant and clarify the makers of 83 are in no way concerned with the case The complaint of Future Resources FZE against the producers of the film 83 is false, baseless and motivated.\" [168] A scene in which the Pakistan Army stopped border firing to let the Indian Army listen to the score of the final match, received criticism from fans, whom accused Khan for his propaganda towards Pakistan, [169] though Singh claimed that the scene is \"one of the special moments that Pakistanis would love\" in his interview to the journalists in Dubai [169]\n\n\nWorldwide distribution\nThe

announced that the film will be streamed on the digital platforms only after eight weeks of its theatrical run [180] [181] But, it was later called off as the production team decided to broadcast the film first over streaming release in order to connect with the \"nostalgic factor of an entire generation – an audience group which primarily is found on the medium of television\" [182] [183] As a result, the film was premiered first on Star Gold on 20 March 2022, [184] [185] and later released through digital platforms, the following day [186]\n\n\nReception\nOn the review aggregator website

saying that \"83 is a winner on pitch and on-screen too\" He further wrote \"Those who witnessed the victory would be glad to relive the experience, while those who didn't, will get a chance to witness how things unfolded during one of the greatest episodes of Indian sports history\" [190] Rachana Dubey of The Times of India too gave four out of five stars, stating that \"You realise this film is not about winning on a world stage, it's about earning respect and director Kabir Khan does set a high benchmark for himself, once again\" She also praised Ranveer Singh's performance for enacting Kapil Dev, and further concluded \"83 does play on the nationalism rhetoric, way more than was required At the surface, '83' is about an underdog team's win As you go deeper, with each actor effortlessly presenting himself as an iconic cricketer from the 1983 team, you tend to feel that this picture has been crafted with a skillfully written narrative, supported by nuanced and internalised performances, and each department lending its technical brilliance to it.\" [191] Anuj Kumar of The Hindu reviewed that \"The film not only captures the emotional heft of the success story of the underdogs, but also delivers a well-researched document in the popular idiom\" [192]\n\n\nCritical response\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 80% of 15 critics' reviews

document in the popular idiom\" [192]\n\n\nBox office\nAccording to Box Office India, the film is the second-highest grossing Hindi opener of 2021, collecting about ₹12.64 crore (US$1.5 million), [215] the first being Sooryavanshi, which collected ₹26.29 crore (US$3.2 million) [216] By the second day of the release, the film had earned ₹25.73 crore (US$3.1 million), [217] and had earned about ₹30.91 crore (US$3.7 million) in the third day of its release, thereby earning about ₹83 crore (US$9.9 million) in the opening weekend [218] Its collections, however saw a downward trend after first three days of its release, due to the heavy competition with Pushpa: The Rise and Spider-Man: No Way Home, the rise of COVID-19 cases due to the Omicron variant, and the sudden restrictions imposed by the state governments, which included night curfew in Maharashtra and the closure of theatres in Delhi from 28 December 2021, as per the orders of Delhi government to control the pandemic [219] This had impacted the collections of the film, as these territories significantly contribute to the Hindi film box office [220] Experts further analysed that the postponement of other films which included Jersey, RRR, Radhe Shyam and Samrat Prithviraj, is a minimal hope for the film, so that the film might have a good run at the box-office [221] [222]\n\n\nPre sale records\nThe advance bookings of the

Way Home released in theatres, a week prior, also followed by the threat of Omicron variant, and the occupancy restrictions prevailing in Maharashtra, might affect the collections However, the film

[256]\n\n\nCommercial analysis\nIn its article about Bollywood Hungama, Fenil Seta stated about the significant reasons, that led to its box-office decline, with problems regarding the technical aspects, casting and the storyline which did not connect with the youngsters apart from the aforementioned factors [219] [220] Trade analyst Komal Nahta too considered that \"One whole chunk of the audience — the 15 to 35 age group — didn't see the film You can't ignore them if you make a film on such a huge budget But, the youth doesn't believe in the past, and are not interested in historical facts Their cricketing heroes are MS Dhoni and Virat Kohli They couldn't identify with Kapil Dev and his team 83 did not have much for the youth  [...] If the film had a personalised and emotional storyline about the characters, it would have been successful in drawing the youth, like Sushant Singh Rajput's M.S Dhoni: The Untold Story managed to do.\" [263] Taran Adarsh also stated that \"83 gives a feeling of a docu-drama People who are looking for a masala entertainer will not find it there Of course, looking at the subject, you can't have an item song or commercial ingredients, but that is one of the deterrents But there are certain films that go down in history as wonderful ones, which might not have worked when they had been released.\" [263] Analysts further believed that, the film was targeted towards the older audiences (the 35 to 50 age group), who were likely reluctant to go theatres, particularly with the rise in the Omicron variant, citing as the reason for the film's underpeformance [264]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Introduction\n\n83 is a 2021 Indian sports drama film directed by Kabir Khan, based on

been crafted with a skillfully written narrative, supported by nuanced and internalised performances, and each department lending its technical brilliance to it.\" [191] Anuj Kumar of The Hindu reviewed that \"The film not only captures the emotional heft of the success story of the underdogs, but also delivers a well-researched document in the popular idiom\" [192]\n\n\nBox office\nAccording to Box Office India, the film is the second-highest grossing Hindi opener of 2021, collecting about ₹12.64 crore (US$1.5 million), [215] the first being Sooryavanshi, which collected ₹26.29 crore (US$3.2 million) [216] By the second day of the release, the film had earned ₹25.73 crore (US$3.1 million), [217] and had earned about ₹30.91 crore (US$3.7 million) in the third day of its release, thereby earning about ₹83 crore (US$9.9 million) in the opening weekend [218] Its collections, however saw a downward trend after first three days of its release, due to the heavy competition with Pushpa: The Rise and Spider-Man: No Way Home, the rise of COVID-19 cases due to the Omicron variant, and the sudden restrictions imposed by the state governments, which included night curfew in Maharashtra and the closure of theatres in Delhi from 28 December 2021, as per the orders of Delhi government to control the pandemic [219] This had impacted the collections of the film, as these territories significantly contribute to the Hindi film box office [220] Experts further analysed that the postponement of other films which included Jersey, RRR, Radhe Shyam and Samrat Prithviraj, is a minimal hope for the film, so that the film might have a good run at the box-office [221] [222]\n\n\nPre sale records\nThe advance bookings of the film began on 19 December 2021, five days prior to the release [226] Despite a middling response, national multiplex chains reported that the film sold nearly 1 lakh tickets with a gross of ₹3.5 crore (US$420,000) [226] PVR reported that 46,000 tickets have sold for the opening day, while INOX and Cinépolis had sold 54,000 tickets [227] The film's cumulative advance ticket sales were reportedly less than that of Gully Boy (2019) which sold 2.12 lakh tickets in advance for the first day of the release [226] Trade analysts Taran Adarsh and Girish Johar predicted that \"the film's opening day collections will be in the range of ₹12–15 crore (US$1.6–2.0 million), if the film gets positive word-of-mouth\" [228] [227] They also opined that \"The success of Pushpa: The Rise and Spider-Man: No Way Home released in theatres, a week prior, also followed by the threat of Omicron variant, and the occupancy restrictions prevailing in Maharashtra, might affect the collections However, the film has generated positive buzz among the audience, with its trailer and people will come to watch the film, if it is worth their while.\" [229]\n\n\nIndia\nIn its opening day, the film earned ₹12.64 crore (US$1.5 million) at the box-office, [215] [a] while trade analyst Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama had estimated that it collected ₹15.25 crore (US$1.8 million) [233] The film had an excellent opening at metropolitan cities including Delhi and Mumbai, with a strong hold in multiplexes, but saw a below average performance in single screens [232] The dubbed versions of the film (Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada) had collected ₹1.5 crore (US$180,000) approximately [233] On the second day of its release (25 December 2021), the film saw an increase of 30% compared to the first-day collection (owing to the Christmas holidays), as the film had earned ₹16 crore (US$1.9 million) worldwide The two-day collections were reported to be around ₹29.59 crore (US$3.5 million), [234] [235] It further saw an increase on the third day (26 December), where the film had earned ₹17.41 crore (US$2.1 million) The collections in the first weekend were reported to be around ₹47 crore (US$5.6 million) [236] The Tamil-dubbed version of the film had earned about ₹3 crore (US$360,000) in the opening weekend at Tamil Nadu [237]\n\n\nOther territories\nOn the overseas circuits, the film earned about US$1.57 million (₹11.79 crore), in the first day of its release [251] It surpassed the opening day collections of Sooryavanshi, which earned US$1.08 million (₹8.02 crore) [252] The film also earned US$391,651 United Arab Emirates and US$90,843 from G.C.C territories, thereby collecting AED 1.77 million (US$482,494) from the regions [253] In the second day of its release, the film had collected US$1.01 million (₹7.6 crore), [251] whereas in the third day, the film had collected US$900,000 (₹6.72 crore) [254] By the fourth day of its release, the film collected US$680,000 (₹5.07 crore), totalling its estimated revenue about US$4.17 million (₹31.14 crore) [254] It was considered to be the Singh's seventh highest-grosser at opening weekend in the overseas box-office, behind Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela (2013), Dil Dhadakne Do, Bajirao Mastani (2015), Padmaavat, Simmba (2018) and Gully Boy (2019) [255] It further grossed AED 3.46 million (US$941,983) in UAE and GCC [256]\n\n\nCommercial analysis\nIn its article about Bollywood Hungama, Fenil Seta stated about the significant reasons, that led to its box-office decline, with problems regarding the technical aspects, casting and the storyline which did not connect with the youngsters apart from the aforementioned factors [219] [220] Trade analyst Komal Nahta too considered that \"One whole chunk of the audience — the 15 to 35 age group — didn't see the film You can't ignore them if you make a film on such a huge budget But, the youth doesn't believe in the past, and are not interested in historical facts Their cricketing heroes are MS Dhoni and Virat Kohli They couldn't identify with Kapil Dev and his team 83 did not have much for the youth  [...] If the film had a personalised and emotional storyline about the characters, it would have been successful in drawing the youth, like Sushant Singh Rajput's M.S Dhoni: The Untold Story managed to do.\" [263] Taran Adarsh also stated that \"83 gives a feeling of a docu-drama People who are looking for a masala entertainer will not find it there Of course, looking at the subject, you can't have an item song or commercial ingredients, but that is one of the deterrents But there are certain films that go down in history as wonderful ones, which might not have worked when they had been released.\" [263] Analysts further believed that, the film was targeted towards the older audiences (the 35 to 50 age group), who were likely reluctant to go theatres, particularly with the rise in the Omicron variant, citing as the reason for the film's underpeformance

to give these creators a wide creative berth to explore all the imaginative potential of the Star Wars galaxy through the unique lens of anime We realized we wanted these to be as authentic as

Visions**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nStar Wars: Visions is a collection of animated short films that offer a unique and diverse perspective on the Star Wars universe. Created in collaboration with some of the world's best anime creators, the films are a departure from the traditional Star Wars canon, while maintaining the emotional identity of the saga. This article provides an overview of the project, its development, the making of the films, and the reception of the series.\n\n**Premise**\n\nStar Wars: Visions is a collection of animated short films presented \"through the lens of the world's best anime creators\" in the first volume. The series offers a new, diverse perspective on Star Wars, created outside of the constraints of the franchise's traditional canon. The films provide creative freedom to each director and production studio, while maintaining fidelity to the themes and emotional identity of the Star Wars saga. Additional volumes feature animation styles from various companies around the world.\n\n**Episodes**\n\nThe episodes of Star Wars: Visions are set in an alternate history, 20 years after a war between the Feudal-Jedi Empire and a renegade Jedi sect called the Sith. A lone wanderer known only as the \"Ronin\" witnesses a legion of former bandit stormtroopers attempt to extort a small village. The villagers fight back, but the leader of the bandits, a self-declared Dark Lord of the Sith armed with a heavily modified lightsaber, turns the tide. While his droid saves the villagers, the Ronin, a former Sith himself, lures the bandit leader into a trap and kills her. The Ronin is shown to be collecting red kyber crystals from each Sith he has killed and decides to give the bandit leader's crystal to the young village chief, citing that it can ward off evil.\n\n**Volume 1 (2021)**\n\nThe first volume of Star Wars: Visions consists of nine episodes, each with its own unique animation style and storyline. The episodes include \"The Duel,\" \"The Village Bride,\" \"The Ninth Jedi,\" \"Tatooine Rhapsody,\" \"Akakiri,\" \"Lop and Ochō,\" \"The Elder,\" \"Screecher's Reach,\" and \"T0-B1.\" All music was composed by Keiji Inai for the first volume.\n\n**Volume 2 (2023)**\n\nThe second volume of Star Wars: Visions consists of nine episodes, each with its own unique animation style and storyline.

To facilitate the international production, Lucasfilm collaborated with independent producer Justin Leach and his company Qubic Pictures, which helped facilitate the discussions between the US-based executives and Japanese studios. Production of the shorts took place in Japan throughout 2020 and 2021.\n\n**Writing**\n\nThe writers of Star Wars: Visions were given a wide creative berth to explore all the imaginative potential of the Star Wars galaxy through the unique lens of anime.

{"title": "Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant", "content": "\nName\nThe Islamic State, abbreviated IS, [178] is also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL /ˈaɪsɪl/), the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS /ˈaɪsɪs/), [179] [180] and by its Arabic acronym Da'ish [181] [182] or Daesh (داعش, Dāʿish, IPA:  [ˈdaːʕɪʃ]), [183] and also as Dawlat al-Islam (Arabic: دولة الإسلام) [184] In April 2013, having expanded into Syria, the group adopted the name ad-Dawlah al-Islāmiyah fī 'l-ʿIrāq wa-sh-Shām (الدولة الإسلامية في العراق والشام) As al-Shām is a region often compared with the Levant or the region of Syria, the group's name has been variously translated as \"Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham\", [185] \"Islamic State of Iraq and Syria\" (both abbreviated as ISIS), [186] or \"Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\" (abbreviated as ISIL) [180] In 2014, Dar al-Ifta al-Misriyyah dubbed ISIS as QSIS for \"al-Qaeda Separatists in Iraq and Syria\", arguing that ISIL does not represent the vast majority of Muslims [187]\n\n\nPurpose and strategy\nThe ideology of the Islamic State, or Islamic Statism has been described as being a hybrid of Salafism, [52] [56] Salafi jihadism, [52] [51] [53] [56] Islamic fundamentalism, [58] Wahhabism, [51] [52] [53] [54] and Qutbism, [46] [47] [202] as well as other doctrines [203] [204]\n\n\nIdeology\nThe ideology of the Islamic State, or Islamic Statism has been described as being a hybrid of Salafism, [52] [56] Salafi jihadism, [52] [51] [53] [56] Islamic fundamentalism, [58] Wahhabism, [51] [52] [53] [54] and Qutbism, [46] [47] [202] as well as other doctrines [203] [204]\n\n\nIslamic eschatology\nOne difference between IS and other Islamist and jihadist movements, including al-Qaeda, is the group's emphasis on eschatology and apocalypticism – that is, a belief in a final Day of Judgment by God IS believes that it will defeat the army of \"Rome\" at the town of Dabiq [53]\n\n\nGoals\nSince at latest 2004, a significant goal of the group has been the foundation of a Sunni Islamic state [238] Specifically, ISIL has sought to establish itself as a caliphate, an Islamic state led by a group of religious authorities under a supreme leader – the caliph – who is believed to be the successor to Muhammad [239] In June 2014, ISIL published a document in which it claimed to have traced the lineage of its leader al-Baghdadi back to Muhammad, [239] and upon proclaiming a new caliphate on 29 June, the group appointed al-Baghdadi as its caliph As caliph, he demanded the allegiance of all devout Muslims worldwide according to Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) [240]\n\n\nStrategy\nDocuments found after the death of Samir Abd Muhammad al-Khlifawi, a former colonel in the intelligence service of the Iraqi Air Force before the US invasion who had been described as \"the strategic head\" of ISIL, detailed planning for the ISIL takeover of northern Syria which made possible \"the group's later advances into Iraq\" Al-Khlifawi called for the infiltration of areas to be conquered with spies who would find out \"as much as possible about the target towns: Who lived there, who was in charge, which families were religious, which Islamic school of religious jurisprudence they belonged to, how many mosques there were, who the imam was, how many wives and children he had and how old they were\" Following this surveillance and espionage would come murder and kidnapping – \"the elimination of every person who might have been a potential leader or opponent\" In Raqqa, after rebel forces drove out the Bashar al-Assad regime and ISIL infiltrated the town, \"first dozens and then hundreds of people disappeared\" [246]\n\n\nOrganisation\nIS has been described as a terrorist group adhering to Salafi jihadism [52] [51] [53] [54] [56] [256] Raqqa in Syria was under IS control from 2013 and in 2014 it became the group's de facto capital city [257] On 17 October 2017, following a lengthy battle that saw massive destruction to the city, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) announced the full capture of Raqqa from IS \n\n\nLeadership and governance\nFrom 2013 to 2019, IS was headed and run by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Islamic State's self-styled Caliph Before their deaths, he had two deputy leaders, Abu Muslim al-Turkmani for Iraq and Abu Ali al-Anbari (also known as Abu Ala al-Afri) [258] for Syria, both ethnic Turkmen Advising al-Baghdadi were a cabinet of senior leaders, while its operations in Iraq and Syria are controlled by local 'emirs,' who head semi-autonomous groups which the Islamic State refers to as its provinces [259] Beneath the leaders are councils on finance, leadership, military matters, legal matters (including decisions on executions) foreign fighters' assistance, security, intelligence and media In addition, a shura council has the task of ensuring that all decisions made by the governors and councils comply with the group's interpretation of sharia [260] While al-Baghdadi had told followers to \"advise me when I err\" in sermons, according to observers \"any threat, opposition, or even contradiction is instantly eradicated\" [261]\n\n\nCivilians in Islamic State-controlled areas\nIn 2014, The Wall Street Journal estimated that eight million people lived in the Islamic State [286] The United Nations Commission on Human Rights has stated that IS \"seeks to subjugate civilians under its control and dominate every aspect of their lives through terror, indoctrination, and the provision of services to those who obey\" [287] Civilians, as well as the Islamic State itself, have released footage of some of the human rights abuses [288]\n\n\nMilitary\nEstimates of the size of IS's military have varied widely, from tens of thousands [293] up to 200,000 [112]\nIn early 2015, journalist Mary Anne Weaver estimated that half of IS fighters were foreigners [294] A UN report estimated a total of 15,000 fighters from over 80 countries were in IS's ranks in November 2014 [295] [296] US intelligence estimated an increase to around 20,000 foreign fighters in February 2015, including 3,400 from the Western world [297] In September 2015, the CIA estimated that 30,000 foreign fighters had joined IS [298]\n\n\nNumber of combatants\nEstimates of the size of IS's military have varied widely, from tens of thousands [293] up to 200,000 [112]\nIn early 2015, journalist Mary Anne Weaver estimated that half of IS fighters were foreigners [294] A UN report estimated a total of 15,000 fighters from over 80 countries were in IS's ranks in November 2014 [295] [296] US intelligence estimated an increase to around 20,000 foreign fighters in February 2015, including 3,400 from the Western world [297] In September 2015, the CIA estimated that 30,000 foreign fighters had joined IS [298]\n\n\nConventional weapons\nIS relies mostly on captured weapons with major sources including Saddam Hussein's Iraqi stockpiles from the 2003–11 Iraq insurgency [301] and weapons from government and opposition forces fighting in the Syrian Civil War and during the post-US withdrawal Iraqi insurgency The captured weapons, including armour, guns, surface-to-air missiles, and even some aircraft, enabled rapid territorial growth and facilitated the capture of additional equipment [302] For example, IS captured US-made TOW anti-tank missiles supplied by the United States and Saudi Arabia to the Free Syrian Army in Syria [303] Ninety percent of the group's weapons ultimately originated in China, Russia or Eastern Europe according to Conflict Armament Research [304]\n\n\nNon-conventional weapons\nThe group uses truck and car bombs, suicide bombers and IEDs, and has used chemical weapons in Iraq and Syria [305] IS captured nuclear materials from Mosul University in July 2014, but is unlikely to be able to convert them into weapons [306] In September 2015 a US official stated that IS was manufacturing and using mustard agent in Syria and Iraq, and had an active chemical weapons research team [307] IS has also used water as a weapon of war The group closed the gates of the smaller Nuaimiyah dam in Fallujah in April 2014, flooding the surrounding regions, while cutting the water supply to the Shia-dominated south Around 12,000 families lost their homes and 200 square kilometres (77 sq mi) of villages and fields were either flooded or dried up The economy of the region also suffered with destruction of cropland and electricity shortages [308]\nDuring the Battle of Mosul, commercially available quadcopters and drones were being used by IS as surveillance and weapons delivery platforms using improvised cradles to drop grenades and other explosives [309] One IS drone base was struck and destroyed by two Royal Air Force Tornado using two Paveway IV guided bombs [310]\n\n\nWomen\nIS publishes material directed at women, with media groups encouraging them to play supportive roles within IS, such as providing first aid, cooking, nursing and sewing skills, in order to become \"good wives of jihad\" [311] In 2015, it was estimated that western women made up over 550, or 10%, of IS's western foreign fighters [312]\n\n\nCommunications\nAccording to a 2015 study by the Financial Action Task Force, IS's five primary sources of revenue are as follows (listed in order of significance):\n\n\nFinances\nAccording to a 2015 study by the Financial Action Task Force, IS's five primary sources of revenue are as follows (listed in order of significance):\n\n\nMonetary system\nIS attempted to create a modern gold dinar by minting gold, silver, and copper coins, based on the coinage used by the Umayyad Caliphate in the seventh century [329] Despite a propaganda push for the currency, adoption appeared to have been minimal and its internal economy was effectively dollarised, even with regards to its own fines [330]\n\n\nEducation\nThe education in IS held territory was organised by the Diwan of Education [331] [332] IS introduced its own curriculum which did not include lessons in history, music, geography or art, but included lectures in Islamic Law, Sharia, and Jihad [332] The Diwan of Education was often in competition with the Diwan of Outreach and Mosques which organised educational centres focused on the sharia [331]\n\n\nHistory\nJama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad (1999‑2004)\n\n\nTerritorial control and claims\nAs a self-proclaimed worldwide caliphate, IS claims religious, political and military authority over all Muslims worldwide, [173] and that \"the legality of all emirates, groups, states, and organisations, becomes null by the expansion of the khilāfah's  [caliphate's] authority and arrival of its troops to their areas\" [239]\n\n\nInternational reaction\nThe group has attracted widespread criticism internationally for its extremism, from governments and international bodies such as the United Nations and Amnesty International On 24 September 2014, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated: \"As Muslim leaders around the world have said, groups like ISIL – or Da'ish – have nothing to do with Islam, and they certainly do not represent a state They should more fittingly be called the 'Un-Islamic Non-State'.\" [356] ISIL has been classified a terrorist organisation by the United Nations, the European Union and its member states, the United States, Russia, India, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and many other countries Over 60 countries are directly or indirectly waging war against ISIL (see § Countries and groups at war with IS) The group was described as a cult in a Huffington Post column by notable cult authority Steven Hassan [357]\n\n\nInternational criticism\nThe group has attracted

described as a cult in a Huffington Post column by notable cult authority Steven Hassan [357]\n\n\nIslamic criticism\nThe group's declaration of a caliphate has been criticised and its legitimacy has been disputed by Middle Eastern governments, by Sunni Muslim theologians and historians as well as other jihadist groups [359]\n\n\nReligious leaders and organisations\nAround the world, Islamic religious leaders have overwhelmingly condemned ISIL's ideology and actions, arguing that the group has strayed from the path of true Islam and that its actions do not reflect the religion's real teachings or virtues [360]\n\n\nOther jihadist groups\nAccording to The New York Times, \"All of the most influential jihadist theorists are criticising the Islamic State as deviant, calling its self-proclaimed caliphate null and void\" and they have denounced it for its beheadings of journalists [384] and aid workers [228] ISIL is widely denounced by a broad range of Islamic clerics, including Saudi and al-Qaeda-oriented clerics [54] [228] Muhammad al-Yaqoubi states, \"It is enough of a proof of the extreme ideology of ISIS that the top leaders of Salafi-Jihadism have disclaimed it.\" [385] Other critics of ISIL's brand of Sunni Islam include Salafists who previously publicly supported jihadist groups such as al-Qaeda: for example, the Saudi government official Saleh Al-Fawzan, known for his extremist views, who claims that ISIL is a creation of \"Zionists, Crusaders and Safavids\", and the Jordanian-Palestinian writer Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi, the former spiritual mentor to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who was released from prison in Jordan in June 2014 and accused ISIL of driving a wedge between Muslims [364]\n\n\nOther commentaries\nScholar Ian Almond criticised the media commentators, the lack of balance in reporting, and the \"way we are learning to talk about ISIS.\" While there was talk about 'radical evil' and 'radical Islam', Almond found it striking because \"some of the most revered and oft-quoted figures in our Western political tradition have been capable of the most vicious acts of savagery – and yet all we ever hear about is how much the Middle East has to learn from us.\" Almond goes on to cite how Winston Churchill \"wanted to gas women and children\", how Ronald Reagan's Central American policies \"disembowelled more children than ISIS,\" how President Barack Obama's \"planes and drones have dropped bombs on as many schoolchildren as ISIS,\" how former secretary of state Madeleine Albright commented on the deaths of Iraqi children killed by sanctions, how Henry Kissinger and Margaret Thatcher \"assisted in the torture and disappearance of thousands of Chilean students and labour activists.. For anyone familiar with the history of both U.S and European torture and murder over the past 150 years, it might not be all that hyperbolic to say that in ISIS, what we see more than anything else is a more expansive, explicit version of our own cruelties In bombing ISIS and its would-be imperialism, we are really bombing a version of ourselves.\" [396]\n\n\nDesignation as a terrorist organisation\nThe United Nations Security Council in its Resolution 1267 (1999) described Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaeda associates as operators of a network of terrorist training camps [435] The UN's Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee first listed ISIL in its Sanctions List under the name \"Al-Qaida in Iraq\" on 18 October 2004, as an entity/group associated with al-Qaeda On 2 June 2014, the group was added to its listing under the name \"Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant\" The European Union adopted the UN Sanctions List in 2002 [400]\n\n\nMilitia, cult, territorial authority, and other classifications\nBy 2014, ISIL was increasingly being viewed as a militia in addition to a terrorist group and a cult [443] As major Iraqi cities fell to ISIL in June 2014, Jessica Lewis, a former US Army intelligence officer at the Institute for the Study of War, described ISIL at that time as\n\n\nSupporters\nA United Nations report from May 2015 [update] showed that 25,000 \"foreign terrorist fighters\" from 100 countries had joined \"Islamist\" groups, many of them working for IS or al-Qaeda [447]\n\n\nCountries and groups at war with IS\nIS's claims to territory have brought it into armed conflict with many governments, militias and other armed groups International rejection of IS as a terrorist entity and rejection of its claim to even exist have placed it in conflict with countries around the world.\n\n\nGlobal Coalition to Counter the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\nThe Global Coalition to Counter the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), also referred to as the Counter-ISIL Coalition or Counter-DAESH Coalition, [451] is a US-led group of nations and non-state actors that have committed to \"work together under a common, multifaceted, and long-term strategy to degrade and defeat ISIL/Daesh\" According to a joint statement issued by 59 national governments and the European Union on 3 December 2014, participants in the Counter-ISIL Coalition are focused on multiple lines of effort: [452]\n\n\nOther state opponents not part of the Counter-ISIL Coalition\n Iran [458] – military advisors, training, ground troops in Iraq and Syria, and air power in Syria, beside Iranian borders (see Iranian intervention in Iraq)\n\n\nOther non-state opponents\nAl-Nusra Front is a branch of al-Qaeda operating in Syria Al-Nusra has launched many attacks and bombings, mostly against targets affiliated with or supportive of the Syrian government [488] There have been media reports that many of al-Nusra's foreign fighters have left to join al-Baghdadi's ISIL [489]\n\n\nAl-Qaeda\nAl-Nusra Front is a branch of al-Qaeda operating in Syria Al-Nusra has launched many attacks and bombings, mostly against targets affiliated with or supportive of the Syrian government [488] There have been media reports that many of al-Nusra's foreign fighters have left to join al-Baghdadi's ISIL [489]\n\n\nHuman rights abuse and war crime findings\nThe Islamic State has been widely condemned for crimes against humanity [495] [496] In July 2014, the BBC reported the United Nations' chief investigator as stating: \"Fighters from the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) may be added to a list of war crimes suspects in Syria.\" [497] By June 2014, according to United Nations reports, ISIL had killed hundreds of prisoners of war [498]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nGeneral and cited references\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\n\nThe Islamic State, abbreviated IS, is also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL /ˈaɪsɪl/), the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS /ˈaɪsɪs/), and by its Arabic acronym Da'ish or Daesh (داعش, Dāʿish).

jurisprudence (fiqh) [240]\n\n\nStrategy\nDocuments found after the death of Samir Abd Muhammad al-Khlifawi, a former colonel in the intelligence service of the Iraqi Air Force before the US invasion who had been described as \"the strategic head\" of ISIL, detailed planning for the ISIL takeover of northern Syria which made possible \"the group's later advances into Iraq\" Al-Khlifawi called for the infiltration of areas to be conquered with spies who would find out \"as much as possible about the target towns: Who lived there, who was in charge, which families were religious, which Islamic school of religious jurisprudence they belonged to, how many mosques there were, who the imam was, how many wives and children he had and how old they were\" Following this surveillance and espionage would come murder and kidnapping – \"the elimination of every person who might have been a potential leader or opponent\" In Raqqa, after rebel forces drove out the Bashar al-Assad regime and ISIL infiltrated the town, \"first dozens and then hundreds of people disappeared\" [246]\n\n\nOrganisation\nIS has been described as a terrorist group adhering to Salafi jihadism [52] [51] [53] [54] [56] [256] Raqqa in Syria was under IS control from 2013 and in 2014 it became the group's de facto capital city [257] On 17 October 2017, following a lengthy battle that saw massive destruction to the city, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) announced the full capture of Raqqa from IS \n\n\nLeadership and governance\nFrom 2013 to 2019, IS was headed and run by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Islamic State's self-styled Caliph Before their deaths, he had two deputy leaders, Abu Muslim al-Turkmani for Iraq and Abu Ali al-Anbari (also known as Abu Ala al-Afri) [258] for Syria, both ethnic Turkmen Advising al-Baghdadi were a cabinet of senior leaders, while its operations in Iraq and Syria are controlled by local 'emirs,' who head semi-autonomous groups which the Islamic State refers to as its provinces [259] Beneath the leaders are councils on finance, leadership, military matters, legal matters (including decisions on executions) foreign fighters' assistance, security, intelligence and media In addition, a shura council has the task of ensuring that all decisions made by the governors and councils comply with the group's interpretation of sharia [260] While al-Baghdadi had told followers to \"advise me when I err\" in sermons, according to observers \"any threat, opposition, or even contradiction is instantly eradicated\" [261]\n\n\nCivilians in Islamic State-controlled areas\nIn 2014, The Wall Street Journal estimated that eight million people lived in the Islamic State [286] The United Nations Commission on Human Rights has stated that IS \"seeks to subjugate civilians under its control and dominate every aspect of their lives through terror, indoctrination, and the provision of services to those who obey\" [287] Civilians, as well as the Islamic State itself, have released footage of some of the human rights abuses [288]\n\n\nMilitary\nEstimates of the size of IS's military have varied widely, from tens of thousands [293] up to 200,000 [112]\nIn early 2015, journalist Mary Anne Weaver estimated that half of IS fighters were foreigners [294] A UN report estimated a total of 15,000 fighters from over 80 countries were in IS's ranks in November 2014 [295] [296] US intelligence estimated an increase to around 20,000 foreign fighters in February 2015, including 3,400 from the Western world [297] In September 2015, the CIA estimated that 30,000 foreign fighters had joined IS [298]\n\n\nNumber of combatants\nEstimates of the size of IS's military have varied widely, from tens of thousands [293] up to 200,000 [112]\nIn early 2015, journalist Mary Anne Weaver estimated that half of IS fighters were foreigners [294] A UN report estimated a total of 15,000 fighters from over 80 countries were in IS's ranks in November 2014 [295] [296] US intelligence estimated an increase to around 20,000 foreign fighters in February 2015, including 3,400 from the Western world [297] In September 2015, the CIA estimated that 30,000 foreign fighters had joined IS [298]\n\n\nConventional weapons\nIS relies mostly on captured weapons with major sources including Saddam Hussein's Iraqi stockpiles from the 2003–11 Iraq insurgency [301] and weapons from government and opposition forces fighting in the Syrian Civil War and during the post-US withdrawal Iraqi insurgency The captured weapons, including armour, guns, surface-to-air missiles, and even some aircraft, enabled rapid territorial growth and facilitated the capture of additional equipment [302] For example, IS captured US-made TOW anti-tank missiles supplied by the United States and Saudi Arabia to the Free Syrian Army in Syria [303] Ninety percent of the group's weapons ultimately originated in China, Russia or Eastern Europe according to Conflict Armament Research [304]\n\n\nNon-conventional weapons\nThe group uses truck and car bombs, suicide bombers and IEDs, and has used chemical weapons in Iraq and Syria [305] IS captured nuclear materials from Mosul University in July 2014, but is unlikely to be able to convert them into weapons [306] In September 2015 a US official stated that IS was manufacturing and using mustard agent in Syria and Iraq, and had an active chemical weapons research team [307] IS has also used water as a weapon of war The group closed the gates of the smaller Nuaimiyah dam in Fallujah in April 2014, flooding the surrounding regions, while cutting the water supply to the Shia-dominated south Around 12,000 families lost their homes and 200 square kilometres (77 sq mi) of villages and fields were either flooded or dried up The economy of the region also suffered with destruction of cropland and electricity shortages [308]\nDuring the Battle of Mosul, commercially available quadcopters and drones were being used by IS as surveillance and weapons delivery platforms using improvised cradles to drop grenades and other explosives [309] One IS drone base was struck and destroyed by two Royal Air Force Tornado using two Paveway IV guided bombs [310]\n\n\nWomen\nIS publishes material directed at women, with media groups encouraging them to play supportive roles within IS, such as providing first aid, cooking, nursing and sewing skills, in order to become \"good wives of jihad\" [311] In 2015, it was estimated that western women made up over 550, or 10%, of IS's western foreign fighters [312]\n\n\nCommunications\nAccording to a 2015 study by the Financial Action Task Force, IS's five primary sources of revenue are as follows (listed in order of significance):\n\n\nFinances\nAccording to a 2015 study by the Financial Action Task Force, IS's five primary sources of revenue are as follows (listed in order of significance):\n\n\nMonetary system\nIS attempted to create a modern gold dinar by minting gold, silver, and copper coins, based on the coinage used by the Umayyad Caliphate in the seventh century [329] Despite a propaganda push for the currency, adoption appeared to have been minimal and its internal economy was effectively dollarised, even with regards to its own fines [330]\n\n\nEducation\nThe education in IS held territory was organised by the Diwan of Education [331] [332] IS introduced its own curriculum which did not include lessons in history, music, geography or art, but included lectures in Islamic Law, Sharia, and Jihad [332] The Diwan of Education was often in competition with the Diwan of Outreach and Mosques which organised educational centres focused on the sharia [331]\n\n\nHistory\nJama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad (1999‑2004)\n\n\nTerritorial control and claims\nAs a self-proclaimed worldwide caliphate, IS claims religious, political and military authority over all Muslims worldwide, [173] and that \"the legality of all emirates, groups, states, and organisations, becomes null by the expansion of the khilāfah's  [caliphate's] authority and arrival of its troops to their areas\" [239]\n\n\nInternational reaction\nThe group has attracted widespread criticism internationally for its extremism, from governments and international bodies such as the United Nations and Amnesty International On 24 September 2014, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated: \"As Muslim leaders around the world have said, groups like ISIL – or Da'ish – have nothing to do with Islam, and they certainly do not represent a state They should more fittingly be called the 'Un-Islamic Non-State'.\" [356] ISIL has been classified a terrorist organisation by the United Nations, the European Union and its member states, the United States, Russia, India, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and many other countries Over 60 countries are directly or indirectly waging war against ISIL (see § Countries and groups at war with IS) The group was described as a cult in a Huffington Post column by notable cult authority Steven Hassan [357]\n\n\nInternational criticism\nThe group has attracted widespread criticism internationally for its

Over 60 countries are directly or indirectly waging war against ISIL (see § Countries and groups at war with IS) The group was described as a cult in a Huffington Post column by notable cult authority Steven Hassan [357]\n\n\nIslamic criticism\nThe group's declaration of a caliphate has been criticised and its legitimacy has been disputed by Middle Eastern governments, by Sunni Muslim theologians and historians as well as other jihadist groups [359]\n\n\nReligious leaders and organisations\nAround the world, Islamic religious leaders have overwhelmingly condemned ISIL's ideology and actions, arguing that the group has strayed from the path of true Islam and that its actions do not reflect the religion's real teachings or virtues [360]\n\n\nOther jihadist groups\nAccording to The New York Times, \"All of the most influential jihadist theorists are criticising the Islamic State as deviant, calling its self-proclaimed caliphate null and void\" and they have denounced it for its beheadings of journalists [384] and aid workers [228] ISIL is widely denounced by a broad range of Islamic clerics, including Saudi and al-Qaeda-oriented clerics [54] [228] Muhammad al-Yaqoubi states, \"It is enough of a proof of the extreme ideology of ISIS that the top leaders of Salafi-Jihadism have disclaimed it.\" [385] Other critics of ISIL's brand of Sunni Islam include Salafists who previously publicly supported jihadist groups such as al-Qaeda: for example, the Saudi government official Saleh Al-Fawzan, known for his extremist views, who claims that ISIL is a creation of \"Zionists, Crusaders and Safavids\", and the Jordanian-Palestinian writer Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi, the former spiritual mentor to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who was released from prison in Jordan in June 2014 and accused ISIL of driving a wedge between Muslims [364]\n\n\nOther commentaries\nScholar Ian Almond criticised the media commentators, the lack of balance in reporting, and the \"way we are learning to talk about ISIS.\" While there was talk about 'radical evil' and 'radical Islam', Almond found it striking because \"some of the most revered and oft-quoted figures in our Western political tradition have been capable of the most vicious acts of savagery – and yet all we ever hear about is how much the Middle East has to learn from us.\" Almond goes on to cite how Winston Churchill \"wanted to gas women and children\", how Ronald Reagan's Central American policies \"disembowelled more children than ISIS,\" how President Barack Obama's \"planes and drones have dropped bombs on as many schoolchildren as ISIS,\" how former secretary of state Madeleine Albright commented on the deaths of Iraqi children killed by sanctions, how Henry Kissinger and Margaret Thatcher \"assisted in the torture and disappearance of thousands of Chilean students and labour activists.. For anyone familiar with the history of both U.S and European torture and murder over the past 150 years, it might not be all that hyperbolic to say that in ISIS, what we see more than anything else is a more expansive, explicit version of our own cruelties In bombing ISIS and its would-be imperialism, we are really bombing a version of ourselves.\" [396]\n\n\nDesignation as a terrorist organisation\nThe United Nations Security Council in its Resolution 1267 (1999) described Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaeda associates as operators of a network of terrorist training camps [435] The UN's Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee first listed ISIL in its Sanctions List under the name \"Al-Qaida in Iraq\" on 18 October 2004, as an entity/group associated with al-Qaeda On 2 June 2014, the group was added to its listing under the name \"Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant\" The European Union adopted the UN Sanctions List in 2002 [400]\n\n\nMilitia, cult, territorial authority, and other classifications\nBy 2014, ISIL was increasingly being viewed as a militia in addition to a terrorist group and a cult [443] As major Iraqi cities fell to ISIL in June 2014, Jessica Lewis, a former US Army intelligence officer at the Institute for the Study of War, described ISIL at that time as\n\n\nSupporters\nA United Nations report from May 2015 [update] showed that 25,000 \"foreign terrorist fighters\" from 100 countries had joined \"Islamist\" groups, many of them working for IS or al-Qaeda [447]\n\n\nCountries and groups at war with IS\nIS's claims to territory have brought it into armed conflict with many governments, militias and other armed groups International rejection of IS as a terrorist entity and rejection of its claim to even exist have placed it in conflict with countries around the world.\n\n\nGlobal Coalition to Counter the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\nThe Global Coalition to Counter the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), also referred to as the Counter-ISIL Coalition or Counter-DAESH Coalition, [451] is a US-led group of nations and non-state actors that have committed to \"work together under a common, multifaceted, and long-term strategy to degrade and defeat ISIL/Daesh\" According to a joint statement issued by 59 national governments and the European Union on 3 December 2014, participants in the Counter-ISIL Coalition are focused on multiple lines of effort: [452]\n\n\nOther state opponents not part of the Counter-ISIL Coalition\n Iran [458] – military advisors, training, ground troops in Iraq and Syria, and air power in Syria, beside Iranian borders (see Iranian intervention in Iraq)\n\n\nOther non-state opponents\nAl-Nusra Front is a branch of al-Qaeda operating in Syria Al-Nusra has launched many attacks and bombings, mostly against targets affiliated with or supportive of the Syrian government [488] There have been media reports that many of al-Nusra's foreign fighters have left to join al-Baghdadi's ISIL [489]\n\n\nAl-Qaeda\nAl-Nusra Front is a branch of al-Qaeda operating in Syria Al-Nusra has launched many attacks and bombings, mostly against targets affiliated with or supportive of the Syrian government [488] There have been media reports that many of al-Nusra's foreign fighters have left to join al-Baghdadi's ISIL [489]\n\n\nHuman rights abuse and war crime findings\nThe Islamic State has been widely condemned for crimes against humanity [495] [496] In July 2014, the BBC reported the United Nations' chief investigator as stating: \"Fighters from the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) may be added to a list of war crimes suspects in Syria.\" [497] By June 2014, according to United Nations reports, ISIL had killed hundreds of prisoners of war [498]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nGeneral and cited references\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Islamic_Republic_of_Afghanistan", "content": "\nHistory\nIn December 2001, after the Taliban government was overthrown, the Afghan Interim Administration under Hamid Karzai was formed The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) was established by the UN Security Council to help assist the Karzai administration and provide basic security [18] [19] By this time, after two decades of war as well as an acute famine at the time, Afghanistan had one of the highest infant and child mortality rates in the world, the lowest life expectancy, much of the population were hungry, [20] [21] [22] and infrastructure was in ruins [23] Many foreign donors started providing aid and assistance to rebuild the war-torn country [24] [25]\n\n\nCollapse\nOn 14 April 2021, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance had agreed to start withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan by 1 May [47] Soon after the withdrawal of NATO troops started, the Taliban launched an offensive against the Afghan government, quickly advancing in front of collapsing Afghan government forces [48] [49] In June 2021, a US intelligence report predicted that the Afghan government would likely collapse within six months after NATO completed its withdrawal from the country [50] The report proved overly optimistic: by the second week of August, most Afghan provincial capitals had fallen into the hands of the Taliban and the Afghan National Army was in complete disarray, losing ground on all fronts The falls of Mazar-i-Sharif and Jalalabad on 14 and 15 August respectively removed any possibility for the Afghan government to halt Taliban advance [51]\n\n\n2021 Taliban resurgence\nOn 14 April 2021, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance had agreed to start withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan by 1 May [47] Soon after the withdrawal of NATO troops started, the Taliban launched an offensive against the Afghan government, quickly advancing in front of

complete disarray, losing ground on all fronts The falls of Mazar-i-Sharif and Jalalabad on 14 and 15 August respectively removed any possibility for the Afghan government to halt Taliban advance [51]\n\n\nFall of Kabul\nOn 15 August 2021, Taliban forces entered the capital city of Kabul, meeting only limited resistance [52] In the afternoon, it was reported that Afghan President Ashraf Ghani had left the country, fleeing into either Tajikistan or Uzbekistan; Chairman of the House of the People Mir Rahman Rahmani was also reported to have fled into Pakistan [53] Following Ghani's escape, the remaining loyalist forces abandoned their posts and the Afghan Armed Forces de facto ceased to exist [54]\n\n\nNational Resistance Front\nOn 17 August, the former First Vice President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, Amrullah Saleh, tweeted that he had remained in the country and had assumed the role of Caretaker President in the absence of Ghani citing the Afghan Constitution as his basis [13] Saleh's government includes Bismillah Khan Mohammadi as Minister of Defense and Ahmad Massoud, son of Ahmad Shah Massoud and leader of the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan It was based in the Panjshir Valley, and used the city of Bazarak as a temporary capital, as it was one of the few areas of Afghanistan that was still under control of the Islamic Republic [60] [61] On 6 September, after heavy fighting resulting in high losses on both sides, the Taliban claimed to have captured all of Panjshir, with the Taliban flag being hoisted at the governor's office in Bazarak [62] The remaining NRF troops had reportedly retreated into the mountains, [63] [64] while Saleh and Massoud fled to Tajikistan [65] [66]\n\n\nAdditional resistance\nAs of 2022, scattered fighting between opposition groups and the Taliban continue to occur On 13 March 2022, the Afghanistan Freedom Front, an ethnically diverse anti-Taliban military group formed, [67] and has since conducted several attacks on the Taliban, [68] including a missile attack on Bagram Airfield, in which six Taliban soldiers were killed and two were wounded [69]\n\n\nGovernance\nThe Islamic Republic of Afghanistan was an Islamic republic with its government consisting of three branches, the executive, legislative, and judicial The head of state and government was the President of Afghanistan The National Assembly was the legislature, a bicameral body having two chambers, the House of the People and the House of Elders The Supreme Court was led by Chief Justice Said Yusuf Halem, the former Deputy Minister of Justice for Legal Affairs [79]\n\n\nElections and parties\nUnder the 2004 constitution, both presidential and parliamentary elections were to be held every five years However, due to the disputed 2014 presidential election, the scheduled 2015 parliamentary elections were delayed until 2018 [87] Presidential elections used the two-round system; if no candidate received a majority of the vote in the first round, a second round would be held featuring the top two candidates Parliamentary elections had only one round and were based on the single non-transferable vote system, which allows some candidates to be elected with as little as one percent of the vote [88]\n\n\nMilitary\nBefore the fall of Kabul, the Afghan Armed Forces were under the Ministry of Defense, which included the Afghan Air Force (AAF) and the Afghan National Army (ANA) The Afghan Defense University housed various educational establishments for the Afghan Armed Forces, including the National Military Academy of Afghanistan [98]\n\n\nLaw enforcement\nLaw enforcement was the responsibility of the Afghan National Police (ANP), which was part of the Ministry of Interior Affairs The ANP consisted of two primary branches, the Afghan Uniformed Police and the Afghan Border Police The mission of the Uniformed Police was to ensure security within Afghanistan, prevent crime, and protect property The Border Police was responsible for securing and maintaining the nation's borders with neighboring states as well as all international airports within the country [100] Afghanistan's intelligence agency, the National Directorate of Security (NDS), assisted the ANP with security matters [101] Despite that, all parts of Afghanistan were considered dangerous due to militant activities and terrorism-related incidents Kidnapping for ransom and robberies were common in major cities Every year hundreds of Afghan police were killed in the line of duty [102] Afghanistan was also the world's leading producer of opium [103] Afghanistan's opium poppy harvest produces more than 90% of illicit heroin globally, and more than 95% of the European supply [104] [105] The Afghan Ministry of Counter Narcotics was responsible for the monitoring and eradication of the illegal drug business.\n\n\nForeign relations\nAfghanistan became a member of the United Nations in 1946 [106] Under the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, it enjoyed cordial relations with a number of NATO and allied nations, particularly the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, and Turkey In 2012, the United States and Afghanistan signed their Strategic Partnership Agreement in which Afghanistan became a major non-NATO ally [107] Relations with Pakistan were often tense for various reasons such as the Durand Line border issue and alleged Pakistani involvement in Afghan insurgent groups Afghanistan also had diplomatic relations with neighboring China, Iran, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, as well as with regional states such as Bangladesh, Japan, Kazakhstan, Nepal, Russia, South Korea, and the UAE.\n\n\nHuman rights\nFreedom of expression and the press were permitted and promoted in the 2004 constitution, so long as it did not threaten national or religious integrity or did not defame individuals In 2019, Reporters Without Borders listed the media environment of Afghanistan as 121st out of 179 on its Press Freedom Index, with 1st being most free [112] [113] However many issues regarding human rights existed contrary to the law, often committed by local tribes, lawmakers and hardline clerics Journalists in Afghanistan faced threat from both the security forces and insurgents [114] The Afghan Journalists Safety Committee (AJSC) claimed in 2017 that the Afghan government accounted for 46% of the attacks on Afghan journalists, while insurgents were responsible for rest of the attacks [115]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nIn spite of the turbulent political situation and military conflict which defined the years of the republic an expansion in access to certain utilities and services also took place during this era.\n\n\nHealth and education\nBetween 2001 and 2021, Afghanistan experienced improvements in health, education and women's rights [130] [131] Life expectancy increased from 56 to 64 years and the maternal mortality rate was reduced by half 89% of residents living in cities have access to clean water, up from 16% in 2001 The rate of child marriage has been reduced by 17% [130] [132] The population of Afghanistan increased by more than 50% between 2001 and 2014, while its GDP grew eightfold [133]\n\n\nTechnology\nAccording to the World Bank, 98% of the rural population had access to electricity by 2018, up from 28% in 2008 [142] Overall the figure stood at 98.7% [143] As of 2016, Afghanistan produced 1,400 megawatts of power, but still imported the majority of the electricity it consumed via transmission lines from Iran and the Central Asian states [144]\n\n\nCulture\nPress restrictions were gradually relaxed and private media diversified after 2002, following more than two decades of tight controls The Afghan media experienced rapid growth during the Karzai administration, with dozens of TV stations being established around the country Afghanistan had 203 television stations, 284 radio stations and nearly 1,500 print media outlets in 2019.\n\n\nSee also\nRelated articles\n\n\nNotes\nRelated articles\n\n\nReferences\nRelated articles\n\n\nBibliography\nRelated

The Supreme Court was led by Chief Justice Said Yusuf Halem, the former Deputy Minister of Justice for Legal Affairs.\n\n**Elections and Parties**\n\nUnder the 2004 constitution, both presidential and parliamentary elections were to be held every five years. However, due to the disputed 2014 presidential election, the scheduled 2015 parliamentary elections were delayed until 2018. Presidential elections used the two-round system; if no candidate received a majority of the vote in the first round, a second round would be held featuring the top two candidates. Parliamentary elections had only one round and were based on the single non-transferable vote system, which allows some candidates to be elected with as little as one percent of the vote.\n\n**Military**\n\nBefore the fall of Kabul, the Afghan Armed Forces were under the Ministry of Defense, which included the Afghan Air Force (AAF) and the Afghan National Army (ANA). The Afghan Defense University housed various educational establishments for the Afghan Armed Forces, including the National Military Academy of Afghanistan.\n\n**Law Enforcement**\n\nLaw enforcement was the responsibility of the Afghan National Police (ANP), which was part of the Ministry of Interior Affairs. The ANP consisted of two primary branches, the Afghan Uniformed Police and the Afghan Border Police. The mission of the Uniformed Police was to ensure security within Afghanistan, prevent crime, and protect property. The Border Police was responsible for securing and maintaining the nation's borders with neighboring states as well as all international airports within the country.\n\n**Foreign Relations**\n\nAfghanistan became a member of the United Nations in 1946. Under the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, it enjoyed cordial relations with a number of NATO and allied nations, particularly the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, and Turkey. In 2012, the United States and Afghanistan signed their Strategic Partnership Agreement in which Afghanistan became a major non-NATO ally.\n\n**Human Rights**\n\nFreedom of expression and the press were permitted and promoted in the 2004 constitution, so long as it did not threaten national or religious integrity or did not defame individuals. In 2019, Reporters Without Borders listed the media environment of Afghanistan as 121st out of 179 on its Press Freedom Index, with 1st being most free.\n\nHowever, many issues regarding human rights existed contrary to the law, often committed by local tribes, lawmakers and hardline clerics. Journalists in Afghanistan faced threat from both the security forces and insurgents. The Afghan Journalists Safety Committee (AJSC) claimed in 2017 that the Afghan government accounted for 46% of the attacks on Afghan journalists, while insurgents were responsible for rest of the attacks.\n\n**Infrastructure**\n\nIn spite of the turbulent political situation and military conflict which defined the years of the republic an expansion in access to certain utilities and services also took place during this era.\n\n**Health and Education**\n\nBetween 2001 and 2021, Afghanistan experienced improvements in health, education and women's rights. Life expectancy increased from 56 to 64 years and the maternal mortality rate was reduced by half. 89% of residents living in cities have access to clean water, up from 16% in 2001. The rate of child marriage has been reduced by 17%.\n\n**Technology**\n\nAccording to the World Bank, 98% of the rural population had access to electricity by 2018, up from 28% in 2008. Overall the figure stood at 98.7%. As of 2016, Afghanistan produced 1,400 megawatts of power, but still imported the majority of the electricity it consumed via transmission lines from Iran and the Central Asian states.\n\n**Culture**\n\nPress restrictions were gradually relaxed and private media diversified after 2002, following more than two decades of tight controls. The Afghan media experienced rapid growth during the Karzai administration, with dozens of TV stations being established around the country. Afghanistan had 203 television stations, 284 radio stations and nearly 1,500 print media outlets in 2019.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Islamic_Republic_of_Afghanistan\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nIn December 2001, after the Taliban government was overthrown, the Afghan Interim Administration under Hamid Karzai was formed The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) was established by the UN Security Council to help assist the Karzai administration and provide basic security [18] [19] By this time, after two decades of war as well as an acute famine at the time, Afghanistan had one of the highest infant and child mortality rates in the world, the lowest life expectancy, much of the population were hungry, [20] [21] [22] and infrastructure was in ruins [23] Many foreign donors started providing aid and assistance to rebuild the war-torn country [24] [25]\n\n\nCollapse\nOn 14 April 2021, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance had agreed to start withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan by 1 May [47] Soon after the withdrawal of NATO troops started, the Taliban launched an offensive against the Afghan government, quickly advancing in front of collapsing Afghan government forces [48] [49] In June 2021, a US intelligence report predicted that the Afghan government would likely collapse within six months after NATO completed its withdrawal from the country [50] The report proved overly optimistic: by the second week of August, most Afghan provincial capitals had fallen into the hands of the Taliban and the Afghan National Army was in complete disarray, losing ground on all fronts The falls of Mazar-i-Sharif and Jalalabad on 14 and 15 August respectively removed any possibility for the Afghan government to halt Taliban advance [51]\n\n\n2021 Taliban resurgence\nOn 14 April 2021, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance had agreed to start

[51]\n\n\nFall of Kabul\nOn 15 August 2021, Taliban forces entered the capital city of Kabul, meeting only limited resistance [52] In the afternoon, it was reported that Afghan President Ashraf Ghani had left the country, fleeing into either Tajikistan or Uzbekistan; Chairman of the House of the People Mir Rahman Rahmani was also reported to have fled into Pakistan [53] Following Ghani's escape, the remaining loyalist forces abandoned their posts and the Afghan Armed Forces de facto ceased to exist [54]\n\n\nNational Resistance Front\nOn 17 August, the former First Vice President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, Amrullah Saleh, tweeted that he had remained in the country and had assumed the role of Caretaker President in the absence of Ghani citing the Afghan Constitution as his basis [13] Saleh's government includes Bismillah Khan Mohammadi as Minister of Defense and Ahmad Massoud, son of Ahmad Shah Massoud and leader of the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan It was based in the Panjshir Valley, and used the city of Bazarak as a temporary capital, as it was one of the few areas of Afghanistan that was still under control of the Islamic Republic [60] [61] On 6 September, after heavy fighting resulting in high losses on both sides, the Taliban claimed to have captured all of Panjshir, with the Taliban flag being hoisted at the governor's office in Bazarak [62] The remaining NRF troops had reportedly retreated into the mountains, [63] [64] while Saleh and Massoud fled to Tajikistan [65] [66]\n\n\nAdditional resistance\nAs of 2022, scattered fighting between opposition groups and the Taliban continue to occur On 13 March 2022, the Afghanistan Freedom Front, an ethnically diverse anti-Taliban military group formed, [67] and has since conducted

intelligence agency, the National Directorate of Security (NDS), assisted the ANP with security matters [101] Despite that, all parts of Afghanistan were considered dangerous due to militant activities and terrorism-related incidents Kidnapping for ransom and robberies were common in major cities Every year hundreds of Afghan police were killed in the line of duty [102] Afghanistan was also the world's leading producer of opium [103] Afghanistan's opium poppy harvest produces more than 90% of illicit heroin globally, and more than 95% of the European supply [104] [105] The Afghan Ministry of Counter Narcotics was responsible for the monitoring and eradication of the illegal drug business.\n\n\nForeign relations\nAfghanistan became a member of the United Nations in 1946 [106]

reasons such as the Durand Line border issue and alleged Pakistani involvement in Afghan insurgent groups Afghanistan also had diplomatic relations with neighboring China, Iran, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, as well as with regional states such as Bangladesh, Japan, Kazakhstan, Nepal, Russia, South Korea, and the UAE.\n\n\nHuman rights\nFreedom of expression and the press

Mar-a-Lago club Elon Musk, Robert F Kennedy Jr., Dana White and Vivek Ramaswamy were all at the Mar-a-Lago events, as well as foreign political figures such as Nigel Farage and Eduardo Bolsonaro [105] [106]\nFollowing his election to a second term as President of the United States, Mar-a-Lago became the base for the second presidential transition of Donald Trump as the president-elect made decisions on the nomination of people for his upcoming administration [107]\n\n\nArchitectural style, layout, and materials\nArchitecturally, the resort is in Spanish Revival style The house is a mediterranean-style villa, an adaptation of Hispano-Moresque which was popular in Palm Beach at the time It has a two-story central block with family quarters and service areas in lower subsidiary wings and buildings This arrangement was chosen by Mrs Post to keep the main house from appearing too massive and to separate the family and service areas from those used for entertaining The house is topped by a seventy-five foot, tile-roofed tower containing bedrooms, baths, and an observation deck commanding an extensive view of Palm Beach [13]\n\n\nThe Mar-a-Lago Club\nThe primary business occupying the estate is the Mar-a-Lago Club, which opened in 1994 and operates as resort and hotel for dues-paying members, and rents out estate venues for private events Operating the mansion as a club in this way, while continuing to live on the premises, allows Trump to significantly reduce his tax bill, by identifying a range of items used to maintain the mansion and his lifestyle as being legitimate business expenses [109]\n\n\nLegal issues\nTrump received a $17 million insurance payment for hurricane damage to Mar-a-Lago after the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, for damage to the \"landscaping, roofing, walls, painting, leaks, artwork in the tapestries, tiles, Spanish tiles, the beach, the erosion\", as he described Anthony Senecal, a former mayor and [123] Trump's former butler at the resort and later its \"in-house historian\" said some trees behind the resort had been flattened and some roof tiles were lost, but \"That house has never been seriously damaged I was there for all  [the hurricanes].\" [124]\n\n\nHurricane insurance claim\nTrump received a $17 million insurance payment for hurricane damage to Mar-a-Lago after the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, for

damaged I was there for all  [the hurricanes].\" [124]\n\n\nAmerican flag litigation\nOn October 3, 2006, Trump raised a 20-by-30-foot (6.1 by 9.1 m) American flag on an 80-foot (24 m) flagpole at Mar-a-Lago Town zoning officials asked Trump to adhere to town zoning codes that limit flagpoles to a height of 42 feet (13 m) [125] This dispute led the town council of Palm Beach to charge Trump $1,250 for every day the flag stayed up Trump filed a lawsuit against the Town of Palm Beach He eventually dropped his lawsuit over the flag, and in exchange the town waived its fines [126] As part of a court-ordered mediation, Trump was allowed to file for a permit and keep a pole that was both 10 feet (3.0 m) shorter than the original pole and located on a different spot on his lawn The agreement also required him to donate $100,000 to veterans' charities, and resulted in a change to town ordinances allowing out-of-town club members [127]\n\n\nDiscrimination lawsuit\nIn 1993, Trump and the city of Palm Beach signed an agreement that allowed Trump to turn the residence into a private club [128] In November 1996, Trump asked the Palm Beach council to lift the restrictions contained in the agreement that limited media photography, filmmaking, land sales, membership, and traffic at the club, and prevented him from applying for tax exemptions on the property for three years The council denied the request According to Vanity Fair, before the meeting \"Trump and his attorney had already implied that he and his club had been discriminated against because many of its members were Jewish, and, worse, that the council members who had placed the conditions on him had not placed those restrictions on their own clubs.\" [19] In December 1997, Trump filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida alleging that the town discriminated against him and his club because the club accepted Jewish and African-American members [129] and because town officials had financial stakes in competing clubs [130]\n\n\nAviation litigation\nTrump has repeatedly filed lawsuits against Palm Beach County over aircraft going to and from Palm Beach International Airport (PBI) allegedly affecting Mar-a-Lago [131]\n\n\nUse as a Trump residence\nIn September 2019, Mar-a-Lago became the primary residence for Donald and Melania Trump, who previously held primary residence in New York City [136] [137] The legality of this was disputed because, in 1993, Trump signed a \"use agreement\" with the town of Palm Beach, Florida, that changed Mar-a-Lago's designation from a single-family residence to a private club and specified that guests, including Trump, could not stay there more than three non-consecutive weeks per year [138] [139]\n\n\nAppraisal discrepancy\nPalm Beach county assessors appraise the value of the property \"based on Mar-a-Lago's annual net operating income as a club, not on its resale value as a home or on its reconstruction cost.\" [142] As part of the New York civil investigation of the Trump Organization, a New York court found that from 2011 to 2021 Mar-a-Lago was assessed by Palm Beach County as having a value from $18 million to $27.6 million, while at the same time Trump's financial statements valued it from $427 million to $627 million as part of an alleged scheme to both lower insurance premiums and to get favorable loan terms [143] Various real estate brokers suggested that the property was worth anywhere from $300 million to $1 billion [144] [145]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther

to its ownership by former President Donald Trump. The resort has a rich history dating back to the 1920s, and its design and layout reflect the architectural style of the time.\n\n## History\n\nMar-a-Lago was built in the 1920s as a winter residence for Marjorie Merriweather Post, the heiress to the Post Cereals business. Post paid for the house to be built with her husband Edward F Hutton, and she hired Marion Sims Wyeth as designer and Joseph Urban for interior design and exterior decorations. The construction of the house was completed in 1927, and it was the most expensive non-royal residence built in history at the time.\n\n## Design\n\nThe resort is designed in the Spanish Revival style, and its layout reflects the architectural style of the time. The house is a mediterranean-style villa, an adaptation of Hispano-Moresque, which was popular in Palm Beach at the time. The resort has a two-story central block with family quarters and service areas in lower subsidiary wings and buildings. This arrangement was chosen by Mrs Post to keep the main house from appearing too massive and to separate the family and service areas from those used for entertaining.\n\n## Winter Residence of Marjorie Merriweather Post\n\nHutton and Post regularly used Mar-a-Lago as their winter residence, typically staying from mid January to late March. During this time, they hosted dinner parties, charity events, concerts, costume balls, and a circus.\n\n## Federal Government and Foundation\n\nBy the 1950s and 1960s, social tastes had changed, and many mansions constructed in the 1920s were demolished. However, in 1969 Mar-a-Lago was designated a national historic site. A contemporary report prepared by the Department of the Interior attributed its significance to providing \"an excellent picture of winter resort life in Palm Beach prior to the Depression.\"\n\n## Trump Ownership\n\nDonald Trump initially offered the Post family $15 million, which was rejected. Trump then purchased land between Mar-a-Lago and the ocean from Jack C Massey, the former owner of KFC, for $2 million. Trump stated he intended to build a home that would block Mar-a-Lago's beach view. This threat caused competing interest in Mar-a-Lago to decline. Trump purchased the property for $7 million in 1985. Different sources have put the combined total cost of the purchase at around $10 million.\n\n## First Trump Presidency\n\nPresident Trump referred to Mar-a-Lago as his \"Winter White House,\" and on occasion his \"Southern White House.\" On occasion, he held meetings and events at the resort, including a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\n\n## Notable Presidential Visits\n\nDonald Trump's first visit to Mar-a-Lago as president of the United States took place on the weekend of February 3–6, 2017. On Saturday, he hosted the Diamond Red Cross Ball at the Mar-a-Lago Club. On Sunday, he watched Super Bowl LI at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach.\n\n## Security Zone\n\nWhen President Trump was in residence as president, the Palm Beach region became a zone of temporary flight restrictions. This affected flights and air operations severely within a 30 nautical mile radius. Coast Guard and Secret Service secured the two waterway approaches, ocean and lake, and Secret Service cordoned off streets to Mar-a-Lago during the president's visits.\n\n## Between Trump Presidencies\n\nAt the end of his term, Trump went to live at Mar-a-Lago and established an office as provided for by the Former Presidents Act. Following the end of his term, Trump and other Republican candidates continued to hold fundraisers at Mar-a-Lago, and Trump continued to hold significant influence over the Republican party.\n\n## Storage of Classified Records\n\nUpon departing the White House in January 2021, Trump transported a large volume of presidential records to Mar-a-Lago, despite storage of such materials being subject to the Presidential Records Act. The National Archives and Records Administration arranged to retrieve 15 boxes of material from Mar-a-Lago in January 2022. These included documents clearly marked as classified, prompting the Department of Justice to restrict any details regarding the contents of the 15 boxes.\n\n## Second Trump Presidency\n\nTrump was at Mar-a-Lago on the night of the 2024 United States presidential election. Trump hosted a more exclusive watch party and several private dinners at Mar-a-Lago during election night. Attendees at the event included his extended family, close friends and members of the Mar-a-Lago club.\n\n## The Mar-a-Lago Club\n\nThe primary business occupying the estate is the Mar-a-Lago Club, which opened in 1994 and operates as resort and hotel for dues-paying members, and rents out estate venues for private events.

Trump filed a lawsuit against the Town of Palm Beach over a dispute involving a large American flag on the estate. The lawsuit was eventually dropped, and a new agreement was reached regarding the flag.\n\n## Discrimination Lawsuit\n\nIn 1993, Trump and the city of Palm Beach signed an agreement that allowed Trump to turn the residence into a private club. In 1997, Trump filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida alleging that the town discriminated against him and his club because the club accepted Jewish and African-American members.\n\n## Aviation Litigation\n\nTrump has repeatedly filed lawsuits against Palm Beach County over aircraft going to and from Palm Beach International Airport allegedly affecting Mar-a-Lago.\n\n## Use as a Trump Residence\n\nIn September 2019, Mar-a-Lago became the primary residence for Donald and Melania Trump, who previously held primary residence in New York City.

{"title": "Edward_VIII", "content": "\nEarly life\nEdward was born on 23 June 1894 at White Lodge, Richmond Park, on the outskirts of London during the reign of his great-grandmother Queen Victoria [2] He was the eldest son of the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George V and Queen Mary) His father was the son of the Prince and Princess of Wales (later King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra) His mother was the eldest daughter of Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge and Francis, Duke of Teck At the time of his birth, he was third in the line of succession to the throne, behind his grandfather and father.\n\n\nEducation\nInitially, Edward was tutored at home by Hélène Bricka When his parents travelled the British Empire for almost nine months following the death of Queen Victoria in 1901, young Edward and his siblings stayed in Britain with their grandparents, Queen Alexandra and King Edward VII, who showered their grandchildren with affection Upon his parents' return, Edward was placed under the care of two men, Frederick Finch and Henry Hansell, who virtually brought up Edward and his siblings for their remaining nursery years [12]\n\n\nPrince of Wales\nEdward was officially invested as Prince of Wales in a special ceremony at Caernarfon Castle on 13 July 1911 [18] The investiture took place in Wales, at the instigation of the Welsh politician David Lloyd George, Constable of the Castle and Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Liberal government [19] Lloyd George invented a rather fanciful ceremony in the style of a Welsh pageant, and coached Edward to speak a few words in Welsh [20]\n\n\nRomances\nBefore the First World War, a royal match with Edward's second cousin, Princess Victoria Louise of Prussia, was suggested [41] Nothing came of it, and Victoria Louise married Edward's first cousin once removed, Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick, instead In 1934, Adolf Hitler, in his ambition to link the British and German royal houses, asked Victoria Louise to arrange a marriage between the 40-year-old Edward and her 17-year-old daughter, Frederica of Hanover, who was at boarding school in England Her parents refused, due to the age gap, and Frederica instead married Paul of Greece [41] [42]\n\n\nReign\nGeorge V died on 20 January 1936, and Edward ascended the throne as Edward VIII The next day, accompanied by Simpson, he broke with custom by watching the proclamation of his own accession from a window of St James's Palace [54] He became the first monarch of the British Empire to fly in an aircraft when he flew from Sandringham to London for his Accession Council [13]\n\n\nAbdication\nOn 16 November 1936, Edward invited Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin to Buckingham Palace and expressed his desire to marry Simpson when she became free to remarry Baldwin informed him that his subjects would deem the marriage morally unacceptable, largely because remarriage after divorce was opposed by the Church of England, and the people would not tolerate Simpson as queen [64] As king, Edward was the titular head of the Church, and the clergy expected him to support the Church's teachings The Archbishop of Canterbury, Cosmo Gordon Lang, was vocal in insisting that Edward must go [65]\n\n\nDuke of Windsor\nOn 12 December 1936, at the accession meeting of the British Privy Council, George VI announced his intention to make his brother the \"Duke of Windsor\" with the style of Royal Highness [80] He wanted this to be the first act of his reign, although the formal documents were not signed until 8 March the following year During the interim, Edward was known as the Duke of Windsor George VI's decision to create Edward a royal duke ensured that he could neither stand for election to the British House of Commons nor speak on political subjects in the House of Lords [81]\n\n\nWedding\nThe Duke married Simpson, who had changed her name by deed poll to Wallis Warfield (her birth surname), in a private ceremony on 3 June 1937, at Château de Candé, near Tours, France When the Church of England refused to sanction the union, a County Durham clergyman, Robert Anderson Jardine (Vicar of St Paul's, Darlington), offered to perform the ceremony, and Edward accepted George VI forbade members of the royal family to attend, [83] to the lasting resentment of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor Edward had particularly wanted his brothers the Dukes of Gloucester and Kent and his second cousin Lord Louis Mountbatten to attend the ceremony [84] The French virtuoso organist and composer Marcel Dupré played at the wedding [85]\n\n\n1937 Tour of Germany\nIn October 1937, the Duke and Duchess visited Nazi Germany, against the advice of the British government, and met Adolf Hitler at his Berghof retreat in Bavaria The visit was much publicised by the German media During the visit, Edward gave full Nazi salutes [90] In Germany, \"they were treated like royalty .. members of the aristocracy would bow and curtsy towards her, and she was treated with all the dignity and status that the duke always wanted\", according to royal biographer Andrew Morton in a 2016 BBC interview [91]\n\n\nSecond World War\nIn May 1939, Edward was commissioned by NBC to give a radio broadcast [96] (his first since abdicating) during a visit to the First World War battlefields of Verdun In it he appealed for peace,

Dominions of the British Empire from 20 January 1936 until his abdication on 11 December 1936. He was the eldest son of King George V and Queen Mary, and he became king following the death of his father. Edward's reign was marked by controversy, particularly surrounding his decision to marry Wallis Simpson, an American divorcee.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nEdward was born on 23 June 1894 at White Lodge, Richmond Park, on the outskirts of London during the reign of his great-grandmother Queen Victoria. He was the eldest son of the Duke and Duchess of York, who would later become King George V and Queen Mary. Edward's father was the son of the Prince and Princess of Wales, who would later become King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra. His mother was the eldest daughter of Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge and Francis, Duke of Teck. At the time of his birth, Edward was third in the line of succession to the throne, behind his grandfather and father.\n\n**Education**\n\nInitially, Edward was tutored at home by Hélène Bricka. When his parents traveled the British Empire for almost nine months following the death of Queen Victoria in 1901, young Edward and his siblings stayed in Britain with their grandparents, Queen Alexandra and King Edward VII, who showered their grandchildren with affection. Upon his parents' return, Edward was placed under the care of two men, Frederick Finch and Henry Hansell, who virtually brought up Edward and his siblings for their remaining nursery years.\n\n**Prince of Wales**\n\nEdward was officially invested as Prince of Wales in a special ceremony at Caernarfon Castle on 13 July 1911. The investiture took place in Wales, at the instigation of the Welsh politician David Lloyd George, Constable of the Castle and Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Liberal government. Lloyd George invented a rather fanciful ceremony in the style of a Welsh pageant, and coached Edward to speak a few words in Welsh.\n\n**Romances**\n\nBefore the First World War, a royal match with Edward's second cousin, Princess Victoria Louise of Prussia, was suggested. Nothing came of it, and Victoria Louise married Edward's first cousin once removed, Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick, instead. In 1934, Adolf Hitler, in his ambition to link the British and German royal houses, asked Victoria Louise to arrange a marriage between the 40-year-old Edward and her 17-year-old daughter, Frederica of Hanover, who was at boarding school in England. Her parents refused, due to the age gap, and Frederica instead married Paul of Greece.\n\n**Reign**\n\nGeorge V died on 20 January 1936, and Edward ascended the throne as Edward VIII. The next day, accompanied by Simpson, he broke with custom by watching the proclamation of his own accession from a window of St James's Palace. He became the first monarch of the British Empire to fly in an aircraft when he flew from Sandringham to London for his Accession Council.\n\n**Abdication**\n\nOn 16 November 1936, Edward invited Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin to Buckingham Palace and expressed his desire to marry Simpson when she became free to remarry. Baldwin informed him that his subjects would deem the marriage morally unacceptable, largely because remarriage after divorce was opposed by the Church of England, and the people would not tolerate Simpson as queen. As king, Edward was the titular head of the Church, and the clergy expected him to support the Church's teachings. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Cosmo Gordon Lang, was vocal in insisting that Edward must go.\n\n**Duke of Windsor**\n\nOn 12 December 1936, at the accession meeting of the British Privy Council, George VI announced his intention to make his brother the \"Duke of Windsor\" with the style of Royal Highness. He wanted this to be the first act of his reign, although the formal documents were not signed until 8 March the following year. During the interim, Edward was known as the Duke of Windsor. George VI's decision to create Edward a royal duke ensured that he could neither stand for election to the British House of Commons nor speak on political subjects in the House of Lords.\n\n**Wedding**\n\nThe Duke married Simpson, who had changed her name by deed poll to Wallis Warfield (her birth surname), in a private ceremony on 3 June 1937, at Château de Candé, near Tours, France. When the Church of England refused to sanction the union, a County Durham clergyman, Robert Anderson Jardine (Vicar of St Paul's, Darlington), offered to perform the ceremony, and Edward accepted. George VI forbade members of the royal family to attend, to the lasting resentment of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. Edward had particularly wanted his brothers the Dukes of Gloucester and Kent and his second cousin Lord Louis Mountbatten to attend the ceremony. The French virtuoso organist and composer Marcel Dupré played at the wedding.\n\n**1937 Tour of Germany**\n\nIn October 1937, the Duke and Duchess visited Nazi Germany, against the advice of the British government, and met Adolf Hitler at his Berghof retreat in Bavaria. The visit was much publicized by the German media. During the visit, Edward gave full Nazi salutes. In Germany, \"they were treated like royalty... members of the aristocracy would bow and curtsy towards her, and she was treated with all the dignity and status that the duke always wanted\", according to royal biographer Andrew Morton in a 2016 BBC interview.\n\n**Second World War**\n\nIn May 1939, Edward was commissioned by NBC to give a radio broadcast (his first since abdicating) during a visit to the First World War battlefields of Verdun. In it he appealed for peace, saying \"I am deeply conscious of the presence of the great company of the dead, and I am convinced that could they make their voices heard they would be with me in what I am about to say. I speak simply as a soldier of the Last War whose most earnest prayer it is that such cruel and destructive madness shall never again overtake mankind.

The war, fought between Israel and Egypt, resulted in the closure of the canal, leaving the ships anchored in the Great Bitter Lake. Over the course of eight years, the ships' crews formed a strong bond, organizing social events, sports competitions, and other activities to pass the time. In 1975, the canal was reopened, and the ships were finally able to continue their journeys.\n\n# History\n\nThe 15 ships were sailing northward through the Suez Canal when the war broke out in June 1967. The sudden closure of the canal left the ships anchored in the Great Bitter Lake, the widest part of the canal. Some of the scuttled ships cut off the SS Observer from the other ships, forcing it to anchor in Lake Timsah.\n\n## Closing of the Canal\n\nThe Six-Day War, fought between Israel and Egypt, resulted in the closure of the Suez Canal. The canal was blocked for an extended period, causing the ships to be anchored in the Great Bitter Lake. The crews of the ships were stranded, with no clear end in sight to their ordeal.\n\n## Eight Years of War\n\nIn October 1967, the officers and crews of the 14 ships met on the Melampus to form the Great Bitter Lake Association. The association provided mutual support and organized various activities to pass the time. The crews continued to regularly meet on board their ships, organizing social events, founding a yachting club, and holding the \"Bitter Lake Olympic Games\" to complement the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City.\n\n## Life on Board\n\nLife on board the ships was not without its challenges. The crews had to rely on each other for support and entertainment. Church services were held on the West German motorship Nordwind, while movies were shown on the Bulgarian freighter Vasil Levsky. The Swedish Killara even had a pool, providing a rare luxury for the stranded sailors.\n\n## Reopening of the Canal\n\nIn early 1975, the Suez Canal was once again opened for international transport. The crews of the ships were overjoyed at the prospect of finally continuing their journeys. On 24 May 1975, the German ships Münsterland and Nordwind finally reached Hamburg port, cheered by more than 30,000 spectators.\n\n## Legacy\n\nThe story of the Yellow Fleet has left a lasting legacy. In the 2010s, there was renewed interest in this incident, with two books published that chronicle the eight-year sojourn of the ships in the Great Bitter Lake. The books, Acht Jahre gefangen im Großen Bittersee (in German) by Hans Jürgen Witthöft and Stranded in the Six-Day War (in English) by Cath Senker, provide a detailed account of the experiences of the ships' crews.\n\n# Stranded Ships\n\nThe 15 ships that made up the Yellow Fleet were a diverse group of vessels. They included the MS Port Invercargill, a passenger ship, and the Vasil Levsky, a Bulgarian freighter. The Münsterland and Nordwind, two German motorships, were among the ships that reached Hamburg port in 1975.\n\n## List of Ships\n\nThe following is a list of the 15 ships that made up the Yellow Fleet:\n\n* MS Port Invercargill\n* Vasil Levsky\n* Münsterland\n* Nordwind\n* Melampus\n* Killara\n* SS Observer\n* West German motorship\n* Bulgarian freighter\n* Swedish Killara\n* SS Melampus\n* SS Observer\n* West German motorship\n\n# See Also\n\n* Six-Day War\n* Suez Canal\n* Great Bitter Lake\n* Hamburg port\n* Münsterland\n* Nordwind\n\n# External Links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Yellow_Fleet\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nIn June 1967, the fifteen ships were sailing northward through the Suez Canal as a war broke out between Israel and Egypt in what was to become known as the Six-Day War Both ends of the canal were closed, and after three days it became apparent that the canal would remain blocked for some time as a result of the scuttling of ships to block passage Fourteen ships were forced to anchor in the widest part of the Suez Canal, the Great Bitter Lake Some of the scuttled ships cut off the SS Observer from the other ships and it had to anchor in Lake Timsah [1]\n\n\nClosing of the canal\nIn June 1967, the fifteen ships were sailing northward through the Suez Canal as a war broke out between Israel and Egypt in what was to become known as the Six-Day War Both ends of the canal were closed, and after three days it became apparent that the canal would remain blocked for some time as a result of the scuttling of ships to block passage Fourteen ships were forced to anchor in the widest part of the Suez Canal, the Great Bitter Lake Some of the scuttled ships cut off the SS Observer from the other ships and it had to anchor in Lake Timsah [1]\n\n\nEight years of war\nIn October 1967, the officers and crews of all fourteen ships met on the Melampus to found the \"Great Bitter Lake Association\" which provided mutual support Crew members continued to regularly meet on board their ships, organized social events, founded a yachting club and held the \"Bitter Lake Olympic Games\" to complement the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City Life boat races were arranged and soccer games were played on the largest ship, the MS Port Invercargill, while church services were held on the West German motorship Nordwind and movies were shown on the Bulgarian freighter Vasil Levsky [1] The Swedish Killara had a pool [3]\n\n\nRe-opening of the canal\nIn early 1975, the Suez Canal was once again opened for international transport, and on 24 May 1975, the German ships Münsterland and Nordwind finally reached Hamburg port, cheered by more than 30,000 spectators They were reportedly the only ships to have returned to their home port under their own power For the Münsterland, this was the end of a voyage to Australia which had lasted eight years, three months, and five days [4]\n\n\nLegacy\nIn the 2010s, there was renewed interest in this incident Two books have been published that chronicle the eight-year sojourn of the ships in the Great Bitter Lake, Acht Jahre gefangen im Großen Bittersee (in German) by Hans Jürgen Witthöft (2015), [5] and Stranded in the Six-Day War (in English) by Cath Senker (2017) [6] [7]\n\n\nStranded ships\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born to an American father of Dutch descent and a Japanese mother, Nootbaar has a fascinating story that has taken him from his childhood in California to representing Japan in the World Baseball Classic.\n\n## Early life and amateur career\n\nLars Nootbaar was born on October 31, 1997, to an American father, Charlie Nootbaar, and a Japanese mother, Kumiko Enokida. The family settled in El Segundo, California, where Nootbaar grew up with a passion for baseball. His parents met while they were students at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, and their cultural backgrounds had a significant influence on their son's upbringing.\n\nNootbaar's older brother, Nigel, was a pitcher at the University of Southern California (USC) and played professionally in the Baltimore Orioles system. This exposure to baseball at a young age and the influence of his family's sports background likely contributed to Nootbaar's early interest in the sport.\n\nAs a child, Nootbaar was fascinated by Japanese baseball culture, particularly after a Japan national youth team toured the United States in 2006. Nootbaar served as a batboy for the team and interacted with players, including future MLB player Masahiro Tanaka and Japanese high school pitching phenom Yuki Saito. The experience had a lasting impact on Nootbaar, who would later accept an offer to join the Japan national team for the 2023 World Baseball Classic.\n\n## Professional career\n\nThe St. Louis Cardinals selected Nootbaar in the eighth round of the 2018 Major League Baseball draft. After signing with the team, he was assigned to the State College Spikes of the Class A Short Season New York-Penn League. In his first season, Nootbaar set a team record with seven RBIs in one game and hit .227 with two home runs and 26 RBIs over 56 games.\n\nThe following season, Nootbaar began with the Class A Peoria Chiefs of the Midwest League before being promoted to the Class A-Advanced Palm Beach Cardinals of the Florida State League. He was promoted a second time to the Springfield Cardinals of the Class AA Texas League, where he batted .264 with seven home runs and 38 RBIs over 101 games between the three clubs.\n\nThe 2020 minor league season was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced Nootbaar and other players to adapt to a new reality. However, this setback did not deter Nootbaar, who continued to work on his skills and prepare for the next opportunity to play professionally.\n\n## International career\n\nIn 2023, Nootbaar accepted an offer to join the Japan national team for the World Baseball Classic. The team, featuring players from around the world, including the United States, South Korea, and Cuba, was a unique opportunity for Nootbaar to represent Japan and compete against the best players in the world.\n\nAs the leadoff hitter for the Japanese team, Nootbaar played a crucial role in the team's success, recording an RBI in the gold-medal match against the United States national team. The team went on to win the tournament, marking a historic victory for Japanese baseball.\n\nNootbaar's selection to the Japan national team was a significant achievement, as he became the first player not born in Japan to represent the country in a World Baseball Classic. This distinction highlights his unique background and the diverse cultural influences that have shaped his career.\n\n## Personal life\n\nNootbaar's parents met while they were students at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, and their cultural backgrounds have had a lasting impact on their son's life. His older brother, Nigel, was a pitcher at USC and played professionally in the Baltimore Orioles system, providing Nootbaar with a valuable insight into the world of professional baseball.\n\nNootbaar's experiences playing for the Japan national team and competing in the World Baseball Classic have given him a unique perspective on the game and its cultural significance. As a player with a diverse background, Nootbaar has become a role model for young athletes from different cultural backgrounds, demonstrating the importance of hard work, dedication, and perseverance in achieving success.\n\nIn conclusion, Lars Nootbaar's journey from his childhood in California to representing Japan in the World Baseball Classic is a testament to his determination and passion for the sport. His unique background and cultural influences have shaped his career, making him a valuable asset to the Japanese national team. As a player and a role model, Nootbaar continues to inspire young athletes around the world, demonstrating the power of diversity and the importance of following one's dreams.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Lars_Nootbaar\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and amateur career\nNootbaar was born to an American father of Dutch descent, Charlie Nootbaar, and a Japanese mother, Kumiko Enokida [1] Nootbaar grew up in El Segundo, California \n\n\nProfessional career\nThe St Louis Cardinals selected Nootbaar in the eighth round of the 2018 Major League Baseball draft [8] After signing with the team, he was assigned to the State College Spikes of the Class A Short Season New York–Penn League, where he set a team record with seven RBIs in one game [9] For the season, he hit .227 with two home runs and 26 RBIs over 56 games Nootbaar began the 2019 season with the Class A Peoria Chiefs of the Midwest League before being promoted to the Class A-Advanced Palm Beach Cardinals of the Florida State League [4] [10] He was promoted a second time to the Springfield Cardinals of the Class AA Texas League Over 101 games between the three clubs, he batted .264 with seven home runs and 38 RBIs [11] In 2020, the minor league season was canceled by the COVID-19 pandemic [12]\n\n\nInternational career\nIn 2006, a Japan national youth team toured the US, including future MLB player Masahiro Tanaka and Japanese high school pitching phenom Yuki Saito [26] Nootbaar served as a batboy and interacted with the team, including stretching and playing catch, and some of the players stayed at his house and shared meals with the family [26] According to his mother, this experience was later influential to Nootbaar accepting an offer to join the Japan national team for the 2023 World Baseball Classic The team went on to win the tournament, with Nootbaar batting leadoff and recording an RBI in the gold-medal match against the United States national team [27] [28] Nootbaar was the first player not born in Japan to represent the country in a World Baseball Classic [29]\n\n\nPersonal life\nNootbaar's parents met while they were students at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo [16] Nootbaar's older brother, Nigel, was a pitcher at USC and played professionally in the Baltimore Orioles system [30] [31]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

were members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, [9] and Gosling has said that the religion influenced every aspect of their lives [10] Because of his father's work, they \"moved around a lot\" [4] and Gosling lived in both Cornwall, Ontario [11] and Burlington, Ontario [12] His parents divorced when he was 13, [13] and he and his older sister Mandi lived with their mother,

considered more talented [30] Nonetheless, he has described the job as the greatest two years of his life [29] Fellow cast members included Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Justin Timberlake, Keri Russell, and JC Chasez from NSYNC Gosling has credited the experience with instilling in him \"this great sense of focus.\" [31] He became particularly close friends with Timberlake and they lived together for six months during the second year of the show Timberlake's mother became Gosling's legal guardian after his mother returned to Canada for work reasons [32] Gosling has said that even though he and Timberlake talk infrequently, they are still supportive of each other [31]\n\n\n1993–1999: Child actor\nIn 1993, 12-year-old Gosling attended an open audition in Montreal for a revival of Disney Channel's The Mickey Mouse Club [25] He was given a two-year contract as a Mouseketeer and moved to Orlando, Florida [29] He has said he appeared on-screen infrequently because other

that even though he and Timberlake talk infrequently, they are still supportive of each other [31]\n\n\n2000–2003: Independent films\nAged 19, Gosling decided to move into \"serious acting\" He was dropped by his agent and initially found it difficult to secure work because of the \"stigma\" attached to children's television [34] After a supporting role in the football drama Remember the Titans, he secured a lead role as a young Jewish neo-Nazi in 2001's The Believer Director Henry Bean said he cast Gosling because his Mormon upbringing helped him understand the isolation of Judaism [35] Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times praised an \"electrifying and terrifyingly convincing\" performance [36] while Todd McCarthy of Variety felt his \"dynamite performance\" could \"scarcely have been better\" [37] The film won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival [38] and Gosling has described it as \"the film that kind of gift-wrapped for me the career that I have now.\" [26] Because of the controversial nature of the film, it was difficult to secure financial backing for a full theatrical release, [39] and the film was instead broadcast on Showtime [39] The film was a commercial failure, grossing $416,925 worldwide from a production budget of $1.5 million [40]\n\n\n2004–2009: The Notebook and Half Nelson\nGosling gained mainstream attention in 2004 after starring opposite fellow Canadian Rachel McAdams in the romantic drama film The Notebook, a film adaptation of Nicholas Sparks' novel of the same name, directed by Nick Cassavetes [54] Gosling played Noah Calhoun and commented on the role: \"It gave me an opportunity to play a character over a period of time – from 1940 to 1946 – that was quite profound and formative.\" [55] He sought to imbue his

grandparents were all of Italian descent [9] His parents divorced when he was five, [10] and he has not been in contact with his father, an architect, since he was seven He recalled, \"All I remember of my dad are these brief, violent flashes of domestic violence But I don't want to complain about my childhood Nothing bad ever really happened to me I don't hate the guy.\" [10] At the age of seven, he moved with his mother to San Francisco, California, [10] and when he was 11 they moved to Gainesville, Florida [11] They later settled in Newton Upper Falls, Massachusetts He graduated from Newton South High School in 1985 [12] [13] [14]\n\n\nCareer\nI didn't have a direction until I became a stand-up comedian I was pretty nervous about my future I couldn't imagine myself working a 9-to-5 job.\n\n\n1988–1994: Early stand-up career\nI didn't have a direction until I became a stand-up comedian I was pretty nervous about my future I couldn't imagine myself working a 9-to-5 job.\n\n\n1994–1999: Hardball and NewsRadio\nIn 1994, Rogan relocated to Los Angeles, [10] where his first national television spot followed on the MTV comedy show Half-Hour Comedy Hour [8] The appearance led to the network offering him a three-year exclusive contract and a role in a pilot episode of a \"dopey game show\" for $500 Rogan declined, but it prompted Sussman to send tapes of Rogan's performances to several networks, which sparked a bidding war [20] After a period of negotiation, Rogan accepted a development deal with the Disney network He secured his first major acting role in the 1994 nine-episode Fox sitcom Hardball as Frank Valente, a young, egocentric star player on a professional baseball team [20] Rogan called the hiring process \"weird\", as the network had no idea if he could act until he was asked by Dean Valentine, then-president of Walt Disney Television, to whom he replied: \"If you can lie, you can act, and if you can lie to crazy girlfriends, you can act under pressure.\" [20] The filming schedule was a new experience for Rogan, who started to work 12-hour days [15] Rogan later said: \"It was a great show on paper until a horrible executive producer with a big ego was hired by Fox to run the show and he rewrote it.\" [20] Around this time, Rogan began performing at The Comedy Store in Hollywood and was hired as a paid regular by owner Mitzi Shore According to Rogan, he performed at the club for the next 13 years for free and paid for the venue's new sound system [27]\n\n\n1997–2006: UFC commentator and Fear Factor\nRogan began working for the mixed martial arts promotion Ultimate Fighting Championship as a backstage and post-fight interviewer His first show took place at UFC 12: Judgement Day in Dothan, Alabama, on February 7, 1997 [35] He became interested in Brazilian jiu-jitsu in 1994 after watching Royce Gracie fight at UFC 2: No Way Out, and landed the position at the organization as Sussman was friends with its co-creator and original producer, Campbell McLaren [36] He quit after two years as his salary could not cover the cost of traveling to the events, which were often held in rural locations [37]\n\n\n2005–2009: Comedy specials\nIn 2005, actor Wesley Snipes challenged Rogan to a cage fight Rogan trained for the event for five months before Snipes backed out following an investigation by the IRS for alleged tax evasion Rogan believed Snipes needed a quick payout to alleviate his debt [49]\n\n\n2009–present: Latest endeavors and podcast\nRogan hosted the short-lived CBS show Game Show

He is responsible for shaping the dreams of mortals, and is often called upon to intervene in the dreams of others. Dream is a complex and multifaceted character, with a deep understanding of the nature of reality and the power of the human imagination.\n\n**Daniel Hall**\n\nDaniel's father, Hector Hall, was a ghost revived by the two nightmares, Brute and Glob, in Morpheus's absence. Whereafter Hippolyta \"Lyta\" Hall and Hector's ghost lived in the dreams of a child named Jed Walker for two years. Upon Dream's return to the Dreaming, he destroyed the barrier that the two had created around the child's mind from the real Dreaming; imprisoned the two nightmares; released Hector's ghost; and restored Lyta to the waking world. Upon leaving Lyta, Dream revealed that he would someday claim their unborn son because her unborn son had spent much of his gestation in the Dreaming.

He appears to be light-skinned when interacting with similar characters, but the people of Tales in the Sand's primordial African city see him as dark. He appears as a huge black cat when speaking to the lonely Siamese cat-pilgrim of Dream of a Thousand Cats and as a cat-headed god when addressing the Egyptian feline goddess Bast.

There is a long-standing enmity between Dream and Desire, stemming from Desire's possible involvement in the failure of one of Dream's amours (seen in Endless Nights). It is implied that before his imprisonment he was crueler and more blind to his flaws, and much of The Sandman is focused on his desire to atone for his past behavior (e.g., helping past lovers Calliope and Nada). Dream reacts strongly to perceived insult; he banishes Nada to Hell for rejecting him and expresses outrage when Hob Gadling suggests that he seeks companionship.\n\n**The Dreaming**\n\nDream lives in a castle at the heart of his realm called \"The Dreaming\". Both the castle and the rest of his realm are mutable and change often, often at his will, although his resistance to change (and difficulty changing) is a theme throughout the series. Dream maintains both the castle and the realm, as with all aspects of his appearance, in a half-accommodating, half-terrifying state, simultaneously acknowledging both the courtesy due to others and the attention due him as the realm's master, and indeed the pleasantness and terror of dreams themselves. On top of his castle are the Gate Keepers consisting of a wyvern, a griffin, and a hippogriff who intercept any dreamers that want to enter Dream's castle.\n\n**In Other Media**\n\nIn the Audible Originals adaptation \"The Sandman\" written by Gaiman and Dirk Maggs, James McAvoy voices the character of Dream.\n\nIn the television series adaptation of \"The Sandman\" developed by Allan Heinberg and executive produced by Neil Gaiman, Dream is played by Tom Sturridge.\n\n**Television**\n\nIn June 2019, Netflix signed a deal with Warner Bros to produce the series and gave it an order of eleven episodes. Warner Bros pitched the series to multiple networks—including HBO, which declined to move ahead with it due to its massive budget. Netflix got opportunity to obtain intellectual properties and attract subscribers. The series was developed by Allan Heinberg, who will executive produce alongside Gaiman and Goyer. Gaiman said he would be more involved than he was with the television adaptation of his American Gods (2001), but less than he was with the adaptation of Good Omens (1990).\n\n**See Also**\n\nReferences\n\nExternal Links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Dream_(character)\" following this outline:\n\n\nPublication history\nDream is the protagonist and title character of the comic book The Sandman The comic book grew out of a proposal by Neil Gaiman to revive DC's 1974–1976 series The Sandman, written by Joe Simon and Michael Fleisher and illustrated by Jack Kirby and Ernie Chua Gaiman soon began constructing a treatment for a new series Gaiman mentioned his treatment in passing to DC editor Karen Berger [4] When months later Berger offered Gaiman a comic title to work on, he was unsure his Sandman pitch would be accepted Weeks later, Berger asked Gaiman if he was interested in doing a Sandman series Gaiman recalled: \"I said, 'Um .. yes Yes, definitely What's the catch?'

He was also married to the late American actress Brittany Murphy, who tragically passed away in 2009.\n\n## Early Life\n\nSimon Monjack was born on March 9, 1970, in Hillingdon, Middlesex, to a Jewish family. Growing up, he spent much of his childhood in Bourne End, Buckinghamshire, where he attended Juniper Hill School and later the Royal Grammar School in High Wycombe. When Monjack was just 16 years old, his father, William, passed away due to a brain tumor. This event had a profound impact on Monjack and his family, and it is likely that it contributed to his struggles with his own health later in life.\n\nMonjack's mother, Linda, is a hypnotherapist, and she has been quoted as saying that her son had a \"slight heart attack\" just a week after Brittany Murphy's death in 2009. This suggests that Monjack may have had underlying health issues for some time.\n\n## Career\n\nMonjack began his career in the film industry in the late 1990s, working on several low-budget projects. In 2000, he directed, produced, and wrote the B-movie \"Two Days, Nine Lives.\" This film was a critical and commercial failure, but it marked the beginning of Monjack's career as a filmmaker. In 2006, Monjack received story credit for the biographical film \"Factory Girl,\" which was about the life of actress and model Edie Sedgwick. However, Monjack later claimed that he had been unfairly credited for the film and that the director, George Hickenlooper, had stolen his script.\n\nThe controversy surrounding \"Factory Girl\" was just one of many challenges that Monjack faced in his career. In 2007, it was reported that Monjack was set to direct a film adaptation of D.M. Thomas's novel \"The White Hotel,\" starring Brittany Murphy in the lead role. However, the project was never completed, and Monjack's career continued to stagnate.\n\n## Personal Life\n\nMonjack met his first wife, Simone Bienne, in 2001, and the couple married in Las Vegas later that year. However, the marriage was short-lived, and the couple divorced in 2006. It was during this time that Monjack met Brittany Murphy, and the two began a romantic relationship. They married in a private Jewish ceremony in their Los Angeles home in April 2007.\n\nMonjack and Murphy's relationship was marked by secrecy and exclusivity. The couple rarely made public appearances together, and they did not announce their engagement beforehand. However, their love for each other was evident, and they were often seen together on romantic dates and outings.\n\nTragically, Murphy passed away on December 20, 2009, after collapsing in the couple's bathroom. The cause of her death was later revealed to be pneumonia, with secondary factors of iron-deficiency anemia and drug intoxication from prescription and over-the-counter medications.\n\n## Marriages\n\nMonjack was married twice in his life. His first marriage was to Simone Bienne in 2001, and the couple divorced in 2006. His second marriage was to Brittany Murphy in 2007, and the couple remained together until Murphy's passing in 2009.\n\n## Legal Issues\n\nIn 2005, warrants were issued for Monjack's arrest in Virginia on charges of credit card fraud. However, the charges were later dropped, and Monjack was not prosecuted.\n\n## Death\n\nSimon Monjack passed away on May 10, 2010, at the age of 40, due to a pulmonary embolism. His death was a shock to his family and friends, and it was a tragic end to a life marked by struggles and challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, Simon Monjack was a complex and multifaceted individual who struggled with his career and his personal life. Despite his many challenges, he was a talented filmmaker and a devoted husband and partner. His legacy will be remembered by those who knew him, and his story will serve as a reminder of the fragility of life and the importance of seeking help when needed.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Simon_Monjack\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nMonjack was born on 9 March 1970 in Hillingdon, Middlesex, to a Jewish family [3] He grew up in Bourne End, Buckinghamshire [4] He attended Juniper Hill School, Flackwell Heath, then Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe [4] When he was 16, his father, William (1949–1986), died of a brain tumour [4] [5] [6] His mother Linda (née Hall) is a hypnotherapist [7]\n\n\nCareer\nMonjack directed, produced, and wrote the B movie Two Days, Nine Lives in 2000 [8] He received story credit for the 2006 biographical film Factory Girl about Warhol actress/model Edie Sedgwick [9] Director George Hickenlooper contended that \"Monjack had nothing to do with Factory Girl\" and that \"he filed a frivolous lawsuit against us  [...] making bogus claims that we had stolen his script He held us literally hostage and we were forced to settle with him as he held our production over a barrel.\" Monjack denied these claims [10] In 2007, E!

"article": "# The Voice (American Season 22)\n\nThe Voice is a singing competition television series that premiered on April 26, 2011, on NBC. The show's 22nd season premiered on September 19, 2022, with a new panel of coaches and a revised format.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Voice has been a popular show on NBC for over a decade, attracting a large and dedicated audience. The show's format, which features a panel of coaches who mentor and compete against each other to find the best singer, has been successful in identifying and launching the careers of many talented artists. The 22nd season of The Voice promises to deliver more of the same excitement and competition, with a new panel of coaches and a revised format.\n\n## Coaches and Host\n\nThe 22nd season of The Voice features a new panel of coaches, including Blake Shelton, John Legend, Gwen Stefani, and Camila Cabello. Blake Shelton returns for his 22nd season as a coach, while John Legend returns for his 7th season. Gwen Stefani returns for her 6th season, and Camila Cabello joins the show as a first-time coach. Carson Daly returns as the host of the show for his 22nd season.\n\n## Battle Advisors\n\nThe teams' battle advisors were revealed on August 17, 2022. Jazmine Sullivan will serve as the battle advisor for Team Legend, Sean Paul will serve as the battle advisor for Team Gwen, Charlie Puth will serve as the battle advisor for Team Camila, and Jimmie Allen will serve as the battle advisor for Team Blake.\n\n## Teams\n\nThe show began with the Blind Auditions on September 19, 2022. Each audition featured an artist singing their piece in front of the coaches whose chairs are facing the audience. If a coach is interested in working with the artist, they will press their button to face the artist. If a singular coach presses the button, the artist automatically becomes a member of their team. If multiple coaches turn, the artist will compete for the team of their choice. Each coach has one \"block\" to prevent another coach from getting an artist. This season, each coach ended up with 14 artists by the end of the blind auditions, creating a total of 56 artists advancing to the battles.\n\n## Blind Auditions\n\nThe Blind Auditions aired on September 19, 2022, and featured artists such as Peyton Aldridge, who previously competed on the 18th season of American Idol, and Ansley Burns, who previously competed on the 14th season of America's Got Talent.\n\n## Battles\n\nThe battles aired on Monday, October 10, 2022, through Tuesday, October 25, 2022, comprising episodes 7 through 12. In this round, the coaches pit two of their artists in a singing match and then select one of them to advance to the next round. Losing artists may be \"stolen\" by another coach, becoming new members of their team, or can be saved by their coach, remaining a part of their original team. Multiple coaches can attempt to steal an artist, resulting in a competition for the artist, who will ultimately decide which team they will join. At the end of this round, nine artists will remain on each team; seven will be the battle winners, and one from a steal and a save, respectively. In total, 36 artists advance to the knockouts.\n\n## Knockouts\n\nThe knockouts aired on October 31, 2022, through November 7, 2022, comprising episodes 13 to 15. In this round, each coach groups three of their artists in a singing match. The artists themselves will select the song they will sing in the round. The coach will then select one of the three artists to advance to the Live Playoffs. Each coach can steal one losing artist from another team, but the coaches do not have the ability to save their artists. At the end of this round, three artists will remain on each team while four artists will be stolen, creating a total of 16 artists advancing to the Live Playoffs.\n\n## Live Shows\n\nThe Live Playoffs comprised episodes 16 and 17. The Top 16 artists, four from each team, performed on Monday, November 14. This is the third time in the series' history, former two occasions in season 1 and season 4, in which only 16 contestants competed in the Live Playoffs.\n\n## Elimination Chart\n\n| Week | Episode | Airdate | Coach | Artist | Song | Result |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | 16 | Nov 14 | Blake |  |  |  |\n| 1 | 16 | Nov 14 | Blake |  |  |  |\n| 1 | 16 | Nov 14 | Blake |  |  |  |\n| 1 | 16 | Nov 14 | Camila |  |  |  |\n| 1 | 16 | Nov 14 | Camila |  |  |  |\n| 1 | 16 | Nov 14 | Camila |  |  |  |\n| 1 | 16 | Nov 14 | Gwen |  |  |  |\n| 1 | 16 | Nov 14 | Gwen |  |  |  |\n| 1 | 16 | Nov 14 | Gwen |  |  |  |\n| 1 | 16 | Nov 14 | John |  |  |  |\n| 1 | 16 | Nov 14 | John |  |  |  |\n| 1 | 16 | Nov 14 | John |  |  |  |\n| 2 | 17 | Nov 15 | Blake |  |  |  |\n| 2 | 17 | Nov 15 | Blake |  |  |  |\n| 2 | 17 | Nov 15 | Blake |  |  |  |\n| 2 | 17 | Nov 15 | Camila |  |  |  |\n| 2 | 17 | Nov 15 | Camila |  |  |  |\n| 2 | 17 | Nov 15 | Camila |  |  |  |\n| 2 | 17 | Nov 15 | Gwen |  |  |  |\n| 2 | 17 | Nov 15 | Gwen |  |  |  |\n| 2 | 17 | Nov 15 | Gwen |  |  |  |\n| 2 | 17 | Nov 15 | John |  |  |  |\n| 2 | 17 | Nov 15 | John |  |  |  |\n| 2 | 17 | Nov 15 | John |  |  |  |\n\n## Week 1: Top 16 – Playoffs\n\nThe Live Playoffs comprised episodes 16 and 17.

all the laws needed to fulfill the EU's criteria since, except for the Communist Party of Ukraine, \" [t]he Verkhovna Rada has united around these bills.\" [130] According to Pavlo Klimkin, one of the Ukrainian negotiators of the Association Agreement, initially \"the Russians simply did not believe  [the association agreement with the EU] could come true They didn't believe in our ability to

On 13 December 2013 the President Viktor Yanukovych and government officials announced that three high-ranking officials will be brought to justice. The General Prosecutor's Office of Ukraine questioned a chairman of the Kyiv City State Administration Oleksandr Popov on 13 December and a Security Council secretary Andriy Klyuev on 16 December. The announcement about ongoing investigation became public at the so-called \"round table\" negotiations initiated by former Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk.

about \"Euromaidan\" following this outline:\n\n\nOverview\nThe demonstrations began on the night of 21 November 2013, when protests erupted in the capital Kyiv The protests were launched following the Ukrainian government's suspension of preparations for signing the Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement in favour of closer economic relations with Russia and rejection of draft laws which would have allowed the release of jailed opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko [100] The shift away from the European Union (EU) was preceded by a campaign of threats, insults and preemptive trade restrictions from Russia [101] [102] [103] [104]\n\n\nBackground\nThe term \"Euromaidan\" was initially used as a hashtag on Twitter after a Twitter account named Euromaidan was created on the first

Union (EU) and Ukraine initiated an Association Agreement; [125] however, EU leaders later stated that the agreement would not be ratified unless Ukraine addressed concerns over a \"stark deterioration of democracy and the rule of law\", including the imprisonment of Yulia Tymoshenko and Yuriy Lutsenko in 2011 and 2012 [126] [nb 7] In the months leading up to the protests, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych urged the parliament to adopt laws so that Ukraine would meet the EU's criteria [128] [129] On 25 September 2013, Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada Volodymyr Rybak expressed confidence that parliament would pass all the laws needed to fulfill the EU's criteria since, except for the Communist Party of Ukraine, \" [t]he Verkhovna Rada has united around these bills.\" [130] According to Pavlo Klimkin, one of the Ukrainian negotiators of the Association Agreement, initially \"the Russians simply did not believe  [the association agreement with the EU] could come true They didn't believe in our ability to negotiate a good agreement and didn't believe in our commitment to implement a good agreement.\" [131]\n\n\nDemands\nOn 29 November, a formal resolution by protest organisers declared three demands: [107]\n\n\nTimeline of the events\nThe Euromaidan protest movement began late at night on 21 November 2013 as a peaceful protest [165] The 1,500 protesters were

severe violence in Ukraine since it regained independence [175] Thousands of protesters advanced towards parliament, led by activists with shields and helmets, and were fired on by the Berkut and

building [211] No classes were held in the universities of western Ukrainian cities such as Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Uzhhorod [212] Protests also took place in other large Ukrainian cities, such as Kharkiv, Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk (now Dnipro), and Luhansk The rally in Lviv in support of the integration of Ukraine into the EU was initiated by the students of local universities This rally saw

Regions in their oblast [17] In the cities of Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Odesa, protesters also tried to take over their local RSAs [16]\n\n\nProtests outside Ukraine\nSmaller protests or

border were illuminated in blue and yellow as a symbol of solidarity with Ukraine [266]\n\n\nAntimaidan and pro-government rallies\nPro-government rallies during Euromaidan were largely credited as funded by the government [267] [268] Several news outlets investigated the claims to confirm that by and large, attendees at pro-government rallies did so for financial compensation and not for political reasons, and were not an organic response to the Euromaidan \"People stand at Euromaidan protesting against the violation of human rights in the state, and they are ready to make sacrifices,\" said Oleksiy Haran, a political scientist at Kyiv Mohyla Academy in Kyiv \"People at Antimaidan stand for money only The government uses these hirelings to provoke resistance They won't be sacrificing anything.\" [269]\n\n\nEuromaidan groups\nAutomaidan [270] was a movement within Euromaidan that sought the resignation of Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych It was made up mainly of

Brooklyn, New York City, and the egg hatches into a baby girl.\n\n\nCast\nBeginning in the 1980s, numerous producers attempted to purchase the rights to make a Super Mario Bros film In 1989, Nintendo gave DIC Entertainment the right to make a film out of The Super Mario Bros Super Show!, but it was never produced In 1990, Dustin Hoffman attempted to purchase the rights to produce a film with himself as Mario, Danny DeVito as Luigi, and Barry Levinson directing However, this was not made because of scheduling conflicts for DeVito Jake Eberts then purchased the film rights and started developing an adaptation to be directed by Penny Marshall [12]\n\n\nProduction\nBeginning in the 1980s, numerous producers attempted to purchase the rights to make a Super Mario Bros film In 1989,

with himself as Mario, Danny DeVito as Luigi, and Barry Levinson directing However, this was not made because of scheduling conflicts for DeVito Jake Eberts then purchased the film rights and started developing an adaptation to be directed by Penny Marshall [12]\n\n\nWriting\nThe first screenplay was written by Oscar-winning screenwriter Barry Morrow His story followed brothers Mario and Luigi on an existential road trip so similar to Morrow's prior Rain Man that production titled the script \"Drain Man\" [13] [15] Morrow described his screenplay as \"a study in contrast, like Laurel and Hardy or Abbott and Costello\", that would have \"an odyssey and a quest\" like the game itself [16] Co-producer Fred Caruso later said that Morrow's story was \"more of a serious drama piece as opposed to a fun comedy\" [13]\n\n\nCasting\nAfter securing the rights to the film, Lightmotive began the casting for the characters Hoffman continued to express interest in portraying Mario However, Arakawa did not believe that he was right for the role [28] DeVito was offered both the role of Mario and director [13] [29] Arnold Schwarzenegger and Michael Keaton were approached to play Koopa, but both turned down the role [13] The studio considered Tom Hanks for the role of Luigi, but a string of recent box-office failures dropped him from consideration [30] [31] Actors Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo were ultimately cast as Mario and Luigi.\n\n\nFilming\nSeveral weeks before shooting was to begin, Disney purchased the distribution rights to the film and demanded significant rewrites Morton said the final result was a script that was not at all like the script that he, Jankel, and the cast had signed on to film, and that the tone of the new script was not at all compatible with the sets, which had already been built Solomon recalled that he \"felt like  [his draft of the screenplay] was at least coherent,\" but upon visiting the set,   [Morton] had cut it up with a bunch of other stuff he liked from other drafts and a bunch of new stuff  […] There was no through line.\" [34] Leguizamo said, \"It's eight-year-olds who play the game and that's where the movie needed to be aimed  [...] But  [the directors] kept trying to insert new material They shot scenes with strippers and with other sexually-explicit content, which all got edited out anyway.\" [35] Richard Edson claimed that he and co-star Fisher Stevens were permitted to contribute their own dialogue at the writers’ approval: \"If we could improve the script, they were more than happy So we did our own  [dialogue] and they loved it  […] that made it a lot more fun for us.\" [30]\n\n\nProduction design\nProduction Designer David Snyder approached turning the Mushroom Kingdom into the live-action setting of Dinohattan (also known as DinoYawk or Koopaville) by \" [taking] all the elements that are in the video game\" and \" [turning] them into a metaphor and  [combining] them with 3-D and real characters\" [37] Art Director Walter P Martishius said, \"Koopa gets a single glimpse of Manhattan at the beginning of the movie\" This inspires Koopa to recreate Dinohattan, but \"he didn't get it quite right The place is twisted, off balance, different And he doesn't even know it.\" [22]\n\n\nCreature effects\nLead creatures designer and supervisor Patrick Tatopoulos was aware of the concurrent Jurassic Park production, so he consciously designed the dinosaurs for Super Mario Bros to be more cute and cartoon-like with inspiration from Beetlejuice [19] Tatopoulos described Yoshi as \"an abstract, fantasy T rex\", [24] and designed the baby dinosaur with large eyes to evoke a softer and less menacing quality [19] Lead SFX sculptor Mark Maitre compared Yoshi to a cross between \"a Tyrannosaurus rex and an iguana\" [24] Four versions of the Yoshi puppet were built: a stand-in, a wireless model, a half-puppet for the tongue, and a fully functional model The fully functional puppet utilized 70 cables and nine operators, costing $500,000 (equivalent to $1,086,000 in 2023) [24] [19] Producers from Jurassic Park visited the set and were so impressed with the Yoshi puppet they briefly considered hiring its engineers for a second Jurassic Park creatures shop [38] Originally, the Goombas were only background characters, but their final designs were so impressive that directors Morton and Jankel promoted them to main characters with major stunts [24] [19]\n\n\nVisual effects\nSuper Mario Bros introduced many techniques considered innovative in the transition from practical to digital visual effects It is the first film to have used the compositing software Flame before it was acquired by Autodesk, now an industry standard [30] [39] It is also the first film scanned with the Kodak Cineon film scanner to create a digital intermediate, allowing for the compositing of more than 700 visual effects shots [40] [39]\n\n\nReception\nIn the United States and Canada, Super Mario Bros only

(film)**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nSuper Mario Bros. is a 1993 American live-action fantasy comedy film directed by Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel. The film stars Bob Hoskins as Mario, a plumber who teams up with his brother Luigi (John Leguizamo) to rescue a princess named Daisy (Samantha Mathis) from the clutches of the evil King Koopa (Dennis Hopper). The film is based on the popular video game series of the same name developed by Nintendo.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film begins with a meteorite crashing into the Earth 65 million years ago, causing a split in the universe. Surviving dinosaurs escape into a new dimension, evolving into a humanoid race and founding the city of Dinohattan. In 1973, a mysterious woman leaves a large egg and a rock at a Catholic orphanage in Brooklyn, New York City, and the egg hatches into a baby girl.

The film was a commercial success, grossing over $100 million at the box office. However, it failed to live up to the expectations of its producers, and it has since become a cult classic.\n\n**Home media**\n\nThe film was first released on LaserDisc in the United States in 1993, and it was later released on VHS and DVD. The film's home media releases have been well-received by fans, who have praised its special effects and nostalgic value.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nThe film has had a lasting impact on popular culture, and it has inspired numerous imitators and sequels.

to purchase the rights to make a Super Mario Bros film In 1989, Nintendo gave DIC Entertainment the right to make a film out of The Super Mario Bros Super Show!, but it was never produced In 1990, Dustin Hoffman attempted to purchase the rights to produce a film with himself as Mario, Danny DeVito as Luigi, and Barry Levinson directing However, this was not made because of scheduling conflicts for DeVito Jake Eberts then purchased the film rights and started developing an adaptation to be directed by Penny Marshall [12]\n\n\nProduction\nBeginning in the 1980s, numerous producers attempted

for DeVito Jake Eberts then purchased the film rights and started developing an adaptation to be directed by Penny Marshall [12]\n\n\nWriting\nThe first screenplay was written by Oscar-winning screenwriter Barry Morrow His story followed brothers Mario and Luigi on an existential road trip so similar to Morrow's prior Rain Man that production titled the script \"Drain Man\" [13] [15] Morrow described his screenplay as \"a study in contrast, like Laurel and Hardy or Abbott and Costello\", that would have \"an odyssey and a quest\" like the game itself [16] Co-producer Fred Caruso later said that Morrow's story was \"more of a serious drama piece as opposed to a fun comedy\" [13]\n\n\nCasting\nAfter securing the rights to the film, Lightmotive began the casting for the characters Hoffman continued to express interest in portraying Mario However, Arakawa did not believe that he was right for the role [28] DeVito was offered both the role of Mario and director [13] [29] Arnold Schwarzenegger and Michael Keaton were approached to play Koopa, but both turned down the role [13] The studio considered Tom Hanks for the role of Luigi, but a string of recent box-office failures dropped him from consideration [30] [31] Actors Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo were ultimately cast as Mario and Luigi.\n\n\nFilming\nSeveral weeks before shooting was to begin, Disney purchased the distribution rights to the film and demanded significant rewrites Morton said the final result was a script that was not at all like the script that he, Jankel, and the cast had signed on to film, and that the tone of the new script was not at all compatible with the sets, which had already been built Solomon recalled that he \"felt like  [his draft of the screenplay] was at least coherent,\" but upon visiting the set,   [Morton] had cut it up with a bunch of other stuff he liked from other drafts and a bunch of new stuff  […] There was no through line.\" [34] Leguizamo said, \"It's eight-year-olds who play the game and that's where the movie needed to be aimed  [...] But  [the directors] kept trying to insert new material They shot scenes with strippers and with other sexually-explicit content, which all got edited out anyway.\" [35] Richard Edson claimed that he and co-star Fisher Stevens were permitted to contribute their own dialogue at the writers’ approval: \"If we could improve the script, they were more than happy So we did our own  [dialogue] and they loved it  […] that made it a lot more fun for us.\" [30]\n\n\nProduction design\nProduction Designer David Snyder approached turning the Mushroom Kingdom into the live-action setting of Dinohattan (also known as DinoYawk or Koopaville) by \" [taking] all the elements that are in the video game\" and \" [turning] them into a metaphor and  [combining] them with 3-D and real characters\" [37] Art Director Walter P Martishius said, \"Koopa gets a single glimpse of Manhattan at the beginning of the movie\" This inspires Koopa to recreate Dinohattan, but \"he didn't get it quite right The place is twisted, off balance, different And he doesn't even know it.\" [22]\n\n\nCreature effects\nLead creatures designer and supervisor Patrick Tatopoulos was aware of the concurrent Jurassic Park production, so he consciously designed the dinosaurs for Super Mario Bros to be more cute and cartoon-like with inspiration from Beetlejuice [19] Tatopoulos described Yoshi as \"an abstract, fantasy T rex\", [24] and designed the baby dinosaur with large eyes to evoke a softer and less menacing quality [19] Lead SFX sculptor Mark Maitre compared Yoshi to a cross between \"a Tyrannosaurus rex and an iguana\" [24] Four versions of the Yoshi puppet were built: a stand-in, a wireless model, a half-puppet for the tongue, and a fully functional model The fully functional puppet utilized 70 cables and nine operators, costing $500,000 (equivalent to $1,086,000 in 2023) [24] [19] Producers from Jurassic Park visited the set and were so impressed with the Yoshi puppet they briefly considered hiring its engineers for a second Jurassic Park creatures shop [38] Originally, the Goombas were only background characters, but their final designs were so impressive that directors Morton and Jankel promoted them to main characters with major stunts [24] [19]\n\n\nVisual effects\nSuper Mario Bros introduced many techniques considered innovative in the transition from practical to digital visual effects It is the first film to have used the compositing software Flame before it was acquired by Autodesk, now an industry standard [30] [39] It is also the first film scanned with the Kodak Cineon film scanner to create a digital intermediate, allowing for the compositing of more than 700 visual effects shots [40] [39]\n\n\nReception\nIn the United States and Canada, Super Mario Bros only collected $8.5 million during its opening weekend, ranking in fourth

{"title": "History_of_Tokyo", "content": "\nPre-Tokugawa period\nThe site of Tokyo has been inhabited since ancient times [1] The original inhabitants might have been the indigenous Ainu people, who theoretically conquered all of modern Japan before the Japanese subsumed them The theory they were in Kanto is based on Ainu place names found in and near Tokyo [2] At the Ōmori Shell Midden site in modern-day Ōmori, a collection of pottery, worked bones, and a clay tablet were dated to be 5,000 years old, in the Bronze Age At Yayoi-zaka near modern Nezu Station, Yayoi period grains of charred rice and chaff were found, making it the oldest agricultural site in Tokyo The 4th century Horaisan Kofun in Tanagawa is Tokyo's oldest tomb The 5th century Noge Otsuka in Todoroki is a 5th century tomb from the Middle Kofun culture Around the tomb's hill, various objects from that time imply the location was the resting place of a powerful chieftain of the southern Musashino area [3] [4] Early pots were used to store nuts, scavenged from early inhabitants' hunter-gatherer lifestyles Hunting and gathering decreased over time as the Tokyo peoples started growing food in areas closer to home [5]\n\n\nHeian period\nTokyo's nature is described in Heian writings, including the Manyoshu, and in 880 Ariwara no Narihira, who describes using a ferry to cross the Sumida Narihira's poem about seagulls over the Sumida is likely the origin of the bird as one of Tokyo's symbols [8]\n\n\nKamakura and Muromachi periods\nAfter 1185, a Minamoto branch that settled in Kozuke would eventually become the Tokugawa clan, who ruled Edo from the 17th to the 19th centuries [2]\n\n\nLater history\nThe plains were not safe for travelers The bandit Owada Dogen gained a dangerous reputation there However, villagers in Shibuya likely had sympathy for him, as he was a fugitive from a 1526 battle that ended the Shibuya clan A hill was named Dōgenzaka after him, which is now a street in Shibuya [13] [21]\n\n\nAzuchi-Momoyama period\nFrom 1560 to 1582, Oda Nobunaga's army overthrew the Ashikaga Shogunate, and unified half of the country [22] He did not seem to have interest in Edo Nobunaga's successor, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, continued Nobunaga's conquests Hideyoshi and his army's commander, the Tokugawa Ieyasu, took control of the Hojo in 1589 [23] Hideyoshi unexpectedly gave Ieyasu the gift of Hojo territories in Kanto as a fief, if Ieyasu gave him his territories in the south This was an attempt to neutralize Ieyasu as a potential threat by moving him away from Kyoto In 1590, [24] [25] [26] Ieyasu visiting Edo was considered crucial to the city's legitimacy [26] In 1598, after Hideyoshi died, there was struggle to be shogun between Ieyasu and Hideyoshi's vassals Ieyasu won at the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600 Ieyasu started building a new government's capital in Edo He dictated the social structure Mansfield calls \"the most well-managed feudal society the world has ever known\" [23] [25] [27]\n\n\nTokugawa period (17th century)\n\nThe Tokugawa period began when the Imperial Court appointed Ieyasu shōgun in 1603, starting the Tokugawa shogunate [23] Japan's imperial seat and official capital remained in Kyoto, but the Emperor was virtually powerless; Ieyasu was the effective ruler of Japan, and Edo became powerful as the capital [20] [28] [29]\n\nEarly century development\n\nThe 176 fudai daimyō (inside lords) that supported Ieyasu in his campaign were allocated land near Edo castle to build estates on The 68 tozama daimyō (other lords), nobleman who were not associates, lived in \"peripheral zones\", where they formed allegiances to survive [40] [26] Around 70% of Edo's land was devoted to the residencies of daimyo and samurai Temples and shrines accounted for 14%, leaving 16% for the commoners, a much larger class than the others The merchants grew in wealth by building shops [41] The service class rented homes in the back streets and alleys Their homes, ura nagaya (rear long-houses), were made up of units Each unit's living area was not much larger than 3 square meters An entire family might live there, and single men often lived there to be closer to their countryside family Those men worked lower-class jobs Some of them were struggling ronin (masterless samurai) [41] [42] Ronin were cast out of service for misdemeanors, or their masters were disgraced and stripped of privileges [43] Lower-class areas had communal facilities contained dumps, toilets, and wells, and had problems with heat and rats [41] [42] The homes of wealthy merchants, shopkeepers, and temple lottery winners were superior, located on wider streets, and their roofs were somewhat fire-resistant [44] \n\nCity planning\n\nBoth the fudai and tozama daimyo had to supply \"labor, funds, and materials\" for construction projects, which altogether were tenka-fushin (construction of the realm) The construction of water systems and roads around the city eased the movement of \"officials, merchants, and goods\", and allowed more people to take pilgrimages to holy sites [41]\n\nReligion and development\nThe city plan resembled the Taoist yin-yang, which was also in Shinto Chinese geomancy determined various city features; the east, home of the Cyan Dragon, required a waterway that used the Sumida The White Tiger's west needed a major highway, but this was already the Tokaido road The Vermillion Bird's south needed a pond, which became a surrogate of the Edo Bay The Dark Warrior and Gembu's north needed a mountain; Mount Fuji was used, but was located to the west The whole city was built with a rotation of 90 degrees counter-clockwise, and later, the Ote-mon main gate of the castle was moved south to east Other notable roads were the west Koshu-kaido, which ran from Edo to Nagano (its first stop was Shinjuku), [47] the southwest Daisendo, and the northeast Nakasendo [41]\n\n\nWater systems\nThe eastern Hibiya inlet was filled in using dirt from the northern hill Surugadai Landfills were created with dirt from the northern and western Yamanote hills, and the Dosanbori Canal was created to move construction materials The canal's construction was used by Ieyasu to test his supporters' loyalty, and to deplete the resources of his suspected rivals [41] Early attempts to bore wells only drew salt water, so the Kanda Josui was built It was a 17-kilometer water system, made up of over 3,600 sub-aqueducts The subterranean sections used hollowed-out timber to bring water to each well This first became operational during the Kanei era, and was more advanced than the  European water systems The Kanda Josui later reached capacity, so the Tamagawa Josui was built in Tama from 1652 to 1654 It was 80 kilometers long and transported water from every part of the city To improve water quality by stopping waste disposal in rivers, huts and latrines near the rivers were removed [41]\n\n\nHealth and food\nIn a regular year, the Sumida River flooded twice, creating mud in nearby districts The water systems created mosquitoes that infested Edo in the summer [44] A large fish market operated at Shiba Just outside of the castle, the Yokkaichi (Fourth-day market) sold fish from Kamakura [50] At fish markets, insects and rodents were common This contributed to measles, smallpox, and beriberi Beriberi was caused by nutritional deficiencies in the common diet, which consisted of only white rice It was called the \"Edo disease\" [44] The city's largest rice granaries were at Kuramae, where rice from the domains stayed before going to the shogun Rice merchants became wealthy Meat was not usually eaten due to Buddhist beliefs, but was used as a supposed elixir, and could be bought at the Yotsuya hunter's market, or at butcher's shops near \"Komadome Bridge\" [50]\n\n\nDeath and crime\nHonorable citizens were buried in family graves at temples, but criminals were executed Generally, executions were performed at the city prison in Kodenmacho, but crucifixions and burnings at the stake were done at Shinagawa's Suzugamori execution grounds, where 150,000 died before the practice stopped in the mid-19th century Some execution grounds were by the Tokaido road, warning the travelers Another location was the northeast Kotsukappara execution grounds, opened in 1651 near Minami Senju 200,000 heads were displayed on stakes there The groups who disposed of bodies, honorable or dishonorable, were the hinin and eta Their descendants were burakumin [37]\n\n\nDisasters\nThe 2020 COVID-19 pandemic affected Tokyo [301] There was large jump in cases in July Japan warned that citizens have risk of infection in \"3C\" settings: \"close spaces with poor ventilation, crowded areas, and close conservation areas\" Offices, public transit, and shops were considered to be low-risk For the month of August, bars, restaurants, and karaoke parlors were asked to close at 10 p.m Those that complied with the request were eligible for compensation of $1,900 The city announced a local version of the American Center for Disease Control, which coordinated a citywide pandemic response [302]\n\n\nLate century development\nYotsuya was renamed Shinjuku (new lodge) after the fire, because it was a \"new lodge\" for many people who had their homes destroyed in the fire and needed to move to Yotsuya, which remained unharmed [48]\n\n\nRed light districts\nAfter the Meireki Fire, the city attempted to dissolve theaters and the Yoshiwara red light district (\"venues of moral degeneration\") by moving them from Asakusa, east of the castle, to the northeast However, they could be reached via chokibune boat rides from Yanagibashi, and through the Kanda River and Sanya Canal For ease and economic purposes, entrepreneurs turned Yoshiwara into an unlicensed city district The area was open at night, which benefited brothel owners Officials did not like how the district became a social leveler, as the class-based social codes of the time did not apply there for men The only requirement for entry was an admission fee, and amagasa hats were sold to hide people's identities [47] [62]\n\n\nArt and entertainment\nAs Japan's manufactured exports declined post-bubble-collapse, it has focused more on its popular culture exports, like movies, literature, and video games, which is the impetus of the \"Cool Japan\" marketing strategy that advertises places like Akihabara [257] In the 1990s, Shibuya was the origin of the Shibuya-kei music genre, which combined pop, electronic, and hip-hop [258]\n\n\nLive entertainment\nKabuki theater became popular Initially performed by women, associated with prostitution, and transgressive, authorities despised kabuki [68] The first kabuki theater opened in Nakabashi in 1624, but was close to the castle, so it had to be moved to Negicho (modern Ningyocho), and then Sakaicho [65] Authorities could not get rid of kabuki [69] By 1714, there were three major theaters around Sakaicho, Ichimura-za, Morita-za, and Nakamura-za As it became mainstream by the early 17th century, for various reasons, men started playing every role in kabuki Kabukimono were men who stayed in theater outfits outside the theater, which delighted commoners and offended officials [65] One of the major actors was Ichikawa Danjuro I, who played heroic and masculine characters, and is still praised by modern actors [65]\n\n\nTokugawa period (18th century)\nBy 1720, Edo became the world's largest city, with an estimated 1.3 million people The yamanote and shitamachi both had around 650,000; this highlights the disparity between the two groups, as the shitamachi had 16% of Edo's area [71] Edo's lead in social change and economic growth impacted all of Japan during the Tokugawa era, attracted immigrants, and created new markets and a higher standard of living [34] [72]\n\n\nDaimyo and warriors in the 17th and 18th centuries\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, ronin roamed the city streets They were involved in riots and brawls, and became a problem for the shogunate In the 1790s, the shogun's councilor, Matsudaira Sadanobu, created a detention center for ronin and general vagrants on the Sumida's artificial island of Tsukudajima Losing money due to sankin-kōtai, warriors devoted less time to martial arts and more to time to relaxation Low-ranking hatamoto (bannermen) were troublesome as groups in their free time One group was the Shiratsuka-Gumi (White Hilt Gang), who formed in the 1640s and were eliminated by authorities by the end of the 17th century [43]\n\n\nForty-seven ronin incident\nIn the early 1700s, Lord Kira Yoshinaka, who lived in Ryogoku next to the Sumida River, was appointed to teach Lord Asano Naganori about court ritual Yoshinaka disliked this appointment, and did not receive some entitled gifts from the government He provoked Naganori until he pulled out his dagger and struck Yoshinaka This was punishable by death, and Naganori had to commit seppuku (ritual self-disembowelment) His family was disinherited, becoming ronin, and their estates were divided up His elder councilor, Oishi Koranosuke, planned his revenge on Yoshinaka with 46 other former Asano retainers On January 30, 1703, the 47 ronin stormed Yoshinaka's mansion They gave him the chance to commit seppuku He refused, so Koranosuke beheaded him with Naganori's sword The head was then brought to the Sengaku-ji temple and placed before Naganori's grave The government ordered the ronin to commit seppuku, which they did on February 4 The incident became an element of popular culture [74]\n\n\nLaws\nEdo Neo-Confucianism was a popular philosophy, which partially came from the theory of Hayashi Razan, a lecturer at Yushima's Shoheizaka Institute of Learning It focused less on Confucianism's metaphysical aspects, and more of how people should obey the state It dictated many aspects of how people lived, moreso the lower-class For example, higher-class people were allowed to wear colorful clothes, while lower-class people wore muted tones, to \"promote their invisibility\" [64] Merchants were banned from living in two-story homes, and were moved to newly constructed mezzanine units The lower-class were banned from owning certain luxury items The ruling class pretended to have merchant-class wealth to suppress dissent, the merchant class pretended to have lower-class wealth to avoid punishment, and the lower classes ignored their restrictions as rebellion [75]\n\n\nDisasters\nThe 2020 COVID-19 pandemic affected Tokyo [301] There was large jump in cases in July Japan warned that citizens have risk of infection in \"3C\" settings: \"close spaces with poor ventilation, crowded areas, and close conservation areas\" Offices, public transit, and shops were considered to be low-risk For the month of August, bars, restaurants, and karaoke parlors were asked to close at 10 p.m Those that complied with the request were eligible for compensation of $1,900 The city announced a local version of the American Center for Disease Control, which coordinated a citywide pandemic response [302]\n\n\nArt and entertainment\nAs Japan's manufactured exports declined post-bubble-collapse, it has focused more on its popular culture exports, like movies, literature, and video games, which is the impetus of the \"Cool Japan\" marketing strategy that advertises places like Akihabara [257] In the 1990s, Shibuya was the origin of the Shibuya-kei music genre, which combined pop, electronic, and hip-hop [258]\n\n\nTokugawa period (19th century)\nAt Mukojima, on the Sumida's east bank, \"private gardens, teahouses and temples\" were visited by the era's leading artists, including Kameda Hosai, Sakai Hoitsu, and Tani Buncho They also visited Sahara Kiky's Mukojima's Hyakka-en garden Kiku and his artist friends, made a garden that associated itself with Japanese and Chinese literature They enscribed stones that can still be read By the end of the century, Mukojima would be packed with factories which ruined the local plants and water [84]\n\n\nPerry Expedition and the opening of Japan\nOn July 8, 1853, American Commodore Matthew C Perry and his four steam-powered metal ships sailed into Edo Bay, and demanded Japan open their port for trade Japan responded with fear In Ukiyo-e portraits, Americans were karasu-tengu (crow goblins) Nonetheless, Perry convinced them by presenting American goods like the telegraph and sewing machines, and the Japanese responded by showed the Americans good like lacquer boxes and teapots After Perry visited again in 1854, the shogun opened Japan to foreigners, and give American control of Japanese tariffs to Western countries [86]\n\n\nDisasters\nThe 2020 COVID-19 pandemic affected Tokyo [301] There was large jump in cases in July Japan warned that citizens have risk of infection in \"3C\" settings: \"close spaces with poor ventilation, crowded areas, and close conservation areas\" Offices, public transit, and shops were considered to be low-risk For the month of August, bars, restaurants, and karaoke parlors were asked to close at 10 p.m Those that complied with the request were eligible for compensation of $1,900 The city announced a local version of the American Center for Disease Control, which coordinated a citywide pandemic response [302]\n\n\nFall of the Tokugawa Shogunate\nOn March 24, 1860, rōnin samurai of Mito and Satsuma assassinated Ii Naosuke, Tairō (Chief Minister) of the shogunate He was beheaded outside the Sakurada Gate of Edo Castle [92] Ii had favored the opening of Japan, and signed the Unequal Treaties This outraged many daimyo, and Ii silencing them caused the assassination His death led to instability in the shogunate [87] [92] [93]\n\n\nMeiji era\nEmperor Meiji was brought from Kyoto to lead the Meiji Restoration, which formed a new imperial government [97] In practice, he answered to reformist politicians like Ito Hirobumi and Okubo Toshimichi Japan had to decide how much tradition would carry over to a modernizing country [98] Edo was renamed Tokyo in July 1868, and Edo Castle became Tokyo Castle The emperor moved there in 1869 Samurai were abolished, and they became servants Meiji made government officials wear Western-style clothing in public Buddhist ceremonies were removed from the palace [99] In 1874, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department was established [100] The poor played little role in the upheaval, but their cynical commentary on the transition appeared in writing [97] \n\nMeiji development\nIn the 1870s, the Meiji reformers dissolved the bukechi system, putting bukechi land under the chochi rules and thereby ending a large class division [77]\n\n\nUrban planning\nIn the 1870s, the Meiji reformers dissolved the bukechi system, putting bukechi land under the chochi rules and thereby ending a large class division [77]\n\n\nWesternization\n\nElements of Western architecture were inserted into most Meiji architecture, first at the Tsukiji foreign settlement It was the designated living space for foreigners in Edo, and contained Keio University, a school for Western studies created by Fukuzawa Yukichi Yukichi would influence the Japanese government to become an \"imperial power exercising regional hegemony at the expense of its subject peoples\" The Edo Hotel opened there in 1868 It was mostly Japanese-style, but had European and British Raj architectural influence Many buildings of the time were shrunken to fit limited spaces, which gave them a \"toy model appearance\" Many foreigners left Tsukiji for Yokohama after the Ginza fire of 1872, leaving mostly Japanese consulate employees After 1899, foreigners could live wherever they wanted The foreigners at Tsukiji helped construct multiple universities in the area: Aoyama, Joshi, Meiji Gakuin, and Rikkyo, among others

that spans over 1,400 years. From its humble beginnings as a small fishing village to its current status as a global city, Tokyo has undergone numerous transformations, shaped by its strategic location, cultural traditions, and historical events.\n\n**Pre-Tokugawa period**\n\nThe site of Tokyo has been inhabited since ancient times. The original inhabitants might have been the indigenous Ainu people, who theoretically conquered all of modern Japan before the Japanese subsumed them. The theory they were in Kanto is based on Ainu place names found in and near Tokyo. At the Ōmori Shell Midden site in modern-day Ōmori, a collection of pottery, worked bones, and a clay tablet were dated to be 5,000 years old, in the Bronze Age. Yayoi-zaka near modern Nezu Station, Yayoi period grains of charred rice and chaff were found, making it the oldest agricultural site in Tokyo. The 4th century Horaisan Kofun in Tanagawa is Tokyo's oldest tomb. The 5th century Noge Otsuka in Todoroki is a 5th century tomb from the Middle Kofun culture. Around the tomb's hill, various objects from that time imply the location was the resting place of a powerful chieftain of the southern Musashino area.\n\n**Heian period**\n\nTokyo's nature is described in Heian writings, including the Manyoshu, and in 880 Ariwara no Narihira, who describes using a ferry to cross the Sumida Narihira's poem about seagulls over the Sumida is likely the origin of the bird as one of Tokyo's symbols.\n\n**Kamakura and Muromachi periods**\n\nAfter 1185, a Minamoto branch that settled in Kozuke would eventually become the Tokugawa clan, who ruled Edo from the 17th to the 19th centuries.\n\n**Later history**\n\nThe plains were not safe for travelers. Bandit Owada Dogen gained a dangerous reputation there. However, villagers in Shibuya likely had sympathy for him, as he was a fugitive from a 1526 battle that ended the Shibuya clan. A hill was named Dōgenzaka after him, which is now a street in Shibuya.\n\n**Azuchi-Momoyama period**\n\nFrom 1560 to 1582, Oda Nobunaga's army overthrew the Ashikaga Shogunate, and unified half of the country. He did not seem to have interest in Edo. Nobunaga's successor, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, continued Nobunaga's conquests. Hideyoshi and his army's commander, the Tokugawa Ieyasu, took control of the Hojo in 1589. Hideyoshi unexpectedly gave Ieyasu the gift of Hojo territories in Kanto as a fief, if Ieyasu gave him his territories in the south. This was an attempt to neutralize Ieyasu as a potential threat by moving him away from Kyoto. In 1590, Ieyasu visiting Edo was considered crucial to the city's legitimacy. In 1598, after Hideyoshi died, there was struggle to be shogun between Ieyasu and Hideyoshi's vassals. Ieyasu won at the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. Ieyasu started building a new government's capital in Edo. He dictated the social structure, which was \"the most well-managed feudal society the world has ever known.\"\n\n**Tokugawa period (17th century)**\n\nThe Tokugawa period began when the Imperial Court appointed Ieyasu shōgun in 1603, starting the Tokugawa shogunate. Japan's imperial seat and official capital remained in Kyoto, but the Emperor was virtually powerless; Ieyasu was the effective ruler of Japan, and Edo became powerful as the capital. The 176 fudai daimyō (inside lords) that supported Ieyasu in his campaign were allocated land near Edo castle to build estates on. The 68 tozama daimyō (other lords) lived in \"peripheral zones\", where they formed allegiances to survive. Around 70% of Edo's land was devoted to the residencies of daimyo and samurai. Temples and shrines accounted for 14%, leaving 16% for the commoners, a much larger class than the others. The merchants grew in wealth by building shops. The service class rented homes in the back streets and alleys. Their homes, ura nagaya (rear long-houses), were made up of units. An entire family might live there, and single men often lived there to be closer to their countryside family. Those men worked lower-class jobs. Some of them were struggling ronin (masterless samurai).\n\n**Water systems**\n\nThe eastern Hibiya inlet was filled in using dirt from the northern hill. Surugadai Landfills were created with dirt from the northern and western Yamanote hills, and the Dosanbori Canal was created to move construction materials. The canal's construction was used by Ieyasu to test his supporters' loyalty, and to deplete the resources of his suspected rivals. Early attempts to bore wells only drew salt water, so the Kanda Josui was built. It was a 17-kilometer water system, made up of over 3,600 sub-aqueducts. The subterranean sections used hollowed-out timber to bring water to each well. This first became operational during the Kanei era, and was more advanced than the European water systems. The Kanda Josui later reached capacity, so the Tamagawa Josui was built in Tama from 1652 to 1654. It was 80 kilometers long and transported water from every part of the city. To improve water quality by stopping waste disposal in rivers, huts and latrines near the rivers were removed.\n\n**Health and food**\n\nIn a regular year, the Sumida River flooded twice, creating mud in nearby districts. The water systems created mosquitoes that infested Edo in the summer. A large fish market operated at Shiba. Just outside of the castle, the Yokkaichi (Fourth-day market) sold fish from Kamakura. At fish markets, insects and rodents were common. This contributed to measles, smallpox, and beriberi. Beriberi was caused by nutritional deficiencies in the common diet, which consisted of only white rice. It was called the \"Edo disease\". The city's largest rice granaries were at Kuramae, where rice from the domains stayed before going to the shogun. Rice merchants became wealthy.\n\n**Death and crime**\n\nHonorable citizens were buried in family graves at temples, but criminals were executed. Generally, executions were performed at the city prison in Kodenmacho, but crucifixions and burnings at the stake were done at Shinagawa's Suzugamori execution grounds, where 150,000 died before the practice stopped in the mid-19th century. Some execution grounds were by the Tokaido road, warning the travelers. Another location was the northeast Kotsukappara execution grounds, opened in 1651 near Minami Senju 200,000 heads were displayed on stakes there.\n\n**Disasters**\n\nThe 2020 COVID-19 pandemic affected Tokyo. There was a large jump in cases in July. Japan warned that citizens had a risk of infection in \"3C\" settings: \"close spaces with poor ventilation, crowded areas, and close conservation areas\". Offices, public transit, and shops were considered to be low-risk. For the month of August, bars, restaurants, and karaoke parlors were asked to close at 10 p.m. Those that complied with the request were eligible for compensation of $1,900. The city announced a local version of the American Center for Disease Control, which coordinated a citywide pandemic response.\n\n**Post-earthquake history**\n\nOn December 27, 1923, in the Toranomon incident, there was an attempted assassination of Crown Prince Hirohito, when shots were fired at his car.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"History_of_Tokyo\" following this outline:\n\n\nPre-Tokugawa period\nThe site of Tokyo has been inhabited since ancient times [1] The original inhabitants might have been the indigenous Ainu people, who theoretically conquered all of modern Japan before the Japanese subsumed them The theory they were in Kanto is based on Ainu place names found in and near Tokyo [2] At the Ōmori Shell Midden site in modern-day Ōmori, a collection of pottery, worked bones, and a clay tablet were dated to be 5,000 years old, in the Bronze Age At Yayoi-zaka near modern Nezu Station, Yayoi period grains of charred rice and chaff were found, making it the oldest agricultural site in Tokyo The 4th century Horaisan Kofun in Tanagawa is Tokyo's oldest tomb The 5th century Noge Otsuka in Todoroki is a 5th century tomb from the Middle Kofun culture Around the tomb's hill, various objects from that time imply the location was the resting place of a powerful chieftain of the southern Musashino area [3] [4] Early pots were used to store nuts, scavenged from early inhabitants' hunter-gatherer lifestyles Hunting and gathering decreased over time as the Tokyo peoples started growing food in areas closer to home [5]\n\n\nHeian period\nTokyo's nature is described in Heian writings, including the Manyoshu, and in 880 Ariwara no Narihira, who describes using a ferry to cross the Sumida Narihira's poem about seagulls over the Sumida is likely the origin of the bird as one of Tokyo's symbols [8]\n\n\nKamakura and Muromachi periods\nAfter 1185, a Minamoto branch that settled in Kozuke would eventually become the Tokugawa clan, who ruled Edo from the 17th to the 19th centuries [2]\n\n\nLater history\nThe plains were not safe for travelers The bandit Owada Dogen gained a dangerous reputation there However, villagers in Shibuya likely had sympathy for him, as he was a fugitive from a 1526 battle that ended the Shibuya clan A hill was named Dōgenzaka after him, which is now a street in Shibuya [13] [21]\n\n\nAzuchi-Momoyama period\nFrom 1560 to 1582, Oda Nobunaga's army overthrew the Ashikaga Shogunate, and unified half of the country [22] He did not seem to have interest in Edo Nobunaga's successor, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, continued Nobunaga's conquests Hideyoshi and his army's commander, the Tokugawa Ieyasu, took control of the Hojo in 1589 [23] Hideyoshi unexpectedly gave Ieyasu the gift of Hojo territories in Kanto as a fief, if Ieyasu gave him his territories in the south This was an attempt to neutralize Ieyasu as a potential threat by moving him away from Kyoto In 1590, [24] [25] [26] Ieyasu visiting Edo was considered crucial to the city's legitimacy [26] In 1598, after Hideyoshi died, there was struggle to be shogun between Ieyasu and Hideyoshi's vassals Ieyasu won at the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600 Ieyasu started building a new government's capital in Edo He dictated the social structure Mansfield calls \"the most well-managed feudal society the world has ever known\" [23] [25] [27]\n\n\nTokugawa period (17th century)\n\nThe Tokugawa period began when the Imperial Court appointed Ieyasu shōgun in 1603, starting the Tokugawa shogunate [23] Japan's imperial seat and official capital remained in Kyoto, but the Emperor was virtually powerless; Ieyasu was the effective ruler of Japan, and Edo became powerful as the capital [20] [28] [29]\n\nEarly century development\n\nThe 176 fudai daimyō (inside lords) that supported Ieyasu in his campaign were allocated land near Edo castle to build estates on The 68 tozama daimyō (other lords), nobleman who were not associates, lived in \"peripheral zones\", where they formed allegiances to survive [40] [26] Around 70% of Edo's land was devoted to the residencies of daimyo and samurai Temples and shrines accounted for 14%, leaving 16% for the commoners, a much larger class than the others The merchants grew in wealth by building shops [41] The service class rented homes in the back streets and alleys Their homes, ura nagaya (rear long-houses), were made up of units Each unit's living area was not much larger than 3 square meters An entire family might live there, and single men often lived there to be closer to their countryside family Those men worked lower-class jobs Some of them were struggling ronin (masterless samurai) [41] [42] Ronin were cast out of service for misdemeanors, or their masters were disgraced and stripped of privileges [43] Lower-class areas had communal facilities contained dumps, toilets, and wells, and had problems with heat and rats [41] [42] The homes of wealthy merchants, shopkeepers, and temple lottery winners were superior, located on wider streets, and their roofs were somewhat fire-resistant [44] \n\nCity planning\n\nBoth the fudai and tozama daimyo had to supply \"labor, funds, and materials\" for construction projects, which altogether were tenka-fushin (construction of the realm) The construction of water systems and roads around the city eased the movement of \"officials, merchants, and goods\", and allowed more people to take pilgrimages to holy sites [41]\n\nReligion and development\nThe city plan resembled the Taoist yin-yang, which was also in Shinto Chinese geomancy determined various city features; the east, home of the Cyan Dragon, required a waterway that used the Sumida The White Tiger's west needed a major highway, but this was already the Tokaido road The Vermillion Bird's south needed a pond, which became a surrogate of the Edo Bay The Dark Warrior and Gembu's north needed a mountain; Mount Fuji was used, but was located to the west The whole city was built with a rotation of 90 degrees counter-clockwise, and later, the Ote-mon main gate of the castle was moved south to east Other notable roads were the west Koshu-kaido, which ran from Edo to Nagano (its first stop was Shinjuku), [47] the southwest Daisendo, and the northeast Nakasendo [41]\n\n\nWater systems\nThe eastern Hibiya inlet was filled in using dirt from the northern hill Surugadai Landfills were created with dirt from the northern and western Yamanote hills, and the Dosanbori Canal was created to move construction materials The canal's construction was used by Ieyasu to test his supporters' loyalty, and to deplete the resources of his suspected rivals [41] Early attempts to bore wells only drew salt water, so the Kanda Josui was built It was a 17-kilometer water system, made up of over 3,600 sub-aqueducts The subterranean sections used hollowed-out timber to bring water to each well This first became operational during the Kanei era, and was more advanced than the  European water systems The Kanda Josui later reached capacity, so the Tamagawa Josui was built in Tama from 1652 to 1654 It was 80 kilometers long and transported water from every part of the city To improve water quality by stopping waste disposal in rivers, huts and latrines near the rivers were removed [41]\n\n\nHealth and food\nIn a regular year, the Sumida River flooded twice, creating mud in nearby districts The water systems created mosquitoes that infested Edo in the summer [44] A large fish market operated at Shiba Just outside of the castle, the Yokkaichi (Fourth-day market) sold fish from Kamakura [50] At fish markets, insects and rodents were common This contributed to measles, smallpox, and beriberi Beriberi was caused by nutritional deficiencies in the common diet, which consisted of only white rice It was called the \"Edo disease\" [44] The city's largest rice granaries were at Kuramae, where rice from the domains stayed before going to the shogun Rice merchants became wealthy Meat was not usually eaten due to Buddhist beliefs, but was used as a supposed elixir, and could be bought at the Yotsuya hunter's market, or at butcher's shops near \"Komadome Bridge\" [50]\n\n\nDeath and crime\nHonorable citizens were buried in family graves at temples, but criminals were executed Generally, executions were performed at the city prison in Kodenmacho, but crucifixions and burnings at the stake were done at Shinagawa's Suzugamori execution grounds, where 150,000 died before the practice stopped in the mid-19th century Some execution grounds were by the Tokaido road, warning the travelers Another location was the northeast Kotsukappara execution grounds, opened in 1651 near Minami Senju 200,000 heads were displayed on stakes there The groups who disposed of bodies, honorable or dishonorable, were the hinin and eta Their descendants were burakumin [37]\n\n\nDisasters\nThe 2020 COVID-19 pandemic affected Tokyo [301] There was large jump in cases in July Japan warned that citizens have risk of infection in \"3C\" settings: \"close spaces with poor ventilation, crowded areas, and close conservation areas\" Offices, public transit, and shops were considered to be low-risk For the month of August, bars, restaurants, and karaoke parlors were asked to close at 10 p.m Those that complied with the request were eligible for compensation of $1,900 The city announced a local version of the American Center for Disease Control, which coordinated a citywide pandemic response [302]\n\n\nLate century development\nYotsuya was renamed Shinjuku (new lodge) after the fire, because it was a \"new lodge\" for many people who had their homes destroyed in the fire and needed to move to Yotsuya, which remained unharmed [48]\n\n\nRed light districts\nAfter the Meireki Fire, the city attempted to dissolve theaters and the Yoshiwara red light district (\"venues of moral degeneration\") by moving them from Asakusa, east of the castle, to the northeast However, they could be reached via chokibune boat rides from Yanagibashi, and through the Kanda River and Sanya Canal For ease and economic purposes, entrepreneurs turned Yoshiwara into an unlicensed city district The area was open at night, which benefited brothel owners Officials did not like how the district became a social leveler, as the class-based social codes of the time did not apply there for men The only requirement for entry was an admission fee, and amagasa hats were sold to hide people's identities [47] [62]\n\n\nArt and entertainment\nAs Japan's manufactured exports declined post-bubble-collapse, it has focused more on its popular culture exports, like movies, literature, and video games, which is the impetus of the \"Cool Japan\" marketing strategy that advertises places like Akihabara [257] In the 1990s, Shibuya was the origin of the Shibuya-kei music genre, which combined pop, electronic, and hip-hop [258]\n\n\nLive entertainment\nKabuki theater became popular Initially performed by women, associated with prostitution, and transgressive, authorities despised kabuki [68] The first kabuki theater opened in Nakabashi in 1624, but was close to the castle, so it had to be moved to Negicho (modern Ningyocho), and then Sakaicho [65] Authorities could not get rid of kabuki [69] By 1714, there were three major theaters around Sakaicho, Ichimura-za, Morita-za, and Nakamura-za As it became mainstream by the early 17th century, for various reasons, men started playing every role in kabuki Kabukimono were men who stayed in theater outfits outside the theater, which delighted commoners and offended officials [65] One of the major actors was Ichikawa Danjuro I, who played heroic and masculine characters, and is still praised by modern actors [65]\n\n\nTokugawa period (18th century)\nBy 1720, Edo became the world's largest city, with an estimated 1.3 million people The yamanote and shitamachi both had around 650,000; this highlights the disparity between the two groups, as the shitamachi had 16% of Edo's area [71] Edo's lead in social change and economic growth impacted all of Japan during the Tokugawa era, attracted immigrants, and created new markets and a higher standard of living [34] [72]\n\n\nDaimyo and warriors in the 17th and 18th centuries\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, ronin roamed the city streets They were involved in riots and brawls, and became a problem for the shogunate In the 1790s, the shogun's councilor, Matsudaira Sadanobu, created a detention center for ronin and general vagrants on the Sumida's artificial island of Tsukudajima Losing money due to sankin-kōtai, warriors devoted less time to martial arts and more to time to relaxation Low-ranking hatamoto (bannermen) were troublesome as groups in their free time One group was the Shiratsuka-Gumi (White Hilt Gang), who formed in the 1640s and were eliminated by authorities by the end of the 17th century [43]\n\n\nForty-seven ronin incident\nIn the early 1700s, Lord Kira Yoshinaka, who lived in Ryogoku next to the Sumida River, was appointed to teach Lord Asano Naganori about court ritual Yoshinaka disliked this appointment, and did not receive some entitled gifts from the government He provoked Naganori until he pulled out his dagger and struck Yoshinaka This was punishable by death, and Naganori had to commit seppuku (ritual self-disembowelment) His family was disinherited, becoming ronin, and their estates were divided up His elder councilor, Oishi Koranosuke, planned his revenge on Yoshinaka with 46 other former Asano retainers On January 30, 1703, the 47 ronin stormed Yoshinaka's mansion They gave him the chance to commit seppuku He refused, so Koranosuke beheaded him with Naganori's sword The head was then brought to the Sengaku-ji temple and placed before Naganori's grave The government ordered the ronin to commit seppuku, which they did on February 4 The incident became an element of popular culture [74]\n\n\nLaws\nEdo Neo-Confucianism was a popular philosophy, which partially came from the theory of Hayashi Razan, a lecturer at Yushima's Shoheizaka Institute of Learning It focused less on Confucianism's metaphysical aspects, and more of how people should obey the state It dictated many aspects of how people lived, moreso the lower-class For example, higher-class people were allowed to wear colorful clothes, while lower-class people wore muted tones, to \"promote their invisibility\" [64] Merchants were banned from living in two-story homes, and were moved to newly constructed mezzanine units The lower-class were banned from owning certain luxury items The ruling class pretended to have merchant-class wealth to suppress dissent, the merchant class pretended to have lower-class wealth to avoid punishment, and the lower classes ignored their restrictions as rebellion [75]\n\n\nDisasters\nThe 2020 COVID-19 pandemic affected Tokyo [301] There was large jump in cases in July Japan warned that citizens have risk of infection in \"3C\" settings: \"close spaces with poor ventilation, crowded areas, and close conservation areas\" Offices, public transit, and shops were considered to be low-risk For the month of August, bars, restaurants, and karaoke parlors were asked to close at 10 p.m Those that complied

the \"Cool Japan\" marketing strategy that advertises places like Akihabara [257] In the 1990s, Shibuya was the origin of the Shibuya-kei music genre, which combined pop, electronic, and hip-hop [258]\n\n\nTokugawa period (19th century)\nAt Mukojima, on the Sumida's east bank, \"private gardens, teahouses and temples\" were visited by the era's leading artists, including Kameda Hosai, Sakai Hoitsu, and Tani Buncho They also visited Sahara Kiky's Mukojima's Hyakka-en garden Kiku and his artist friends, made a garden that associated itself with Japanese and Chinese literature They enscribed stones that can still be read By the end of the century, Mukojima would be packed with factories which ruined the local plants and water [84]\n\n\nPerry Expedition and the opening of Japan\nOn July 8, 1853, American Commodore Matthew C Perry and his four steam-powered metal ships sailed into Edo Bay, and demanded Japan open their port for trade Japan responded with fear In Ukiyo-e portraits, Americans were karasu-tengu (crow goblins) Nonetheless, Perry convinced them by presenting American goods like the telegraph and sewing machines, and the Japanese responded by showed the Americans good like lacquer boxes and teapots After Perry visited again in 1854, the shogun opened Japan to foreigners, and give American control of Japanese tariffs to Western countries [86]\n\n\nDisasters\nThe 2020 COVID-19 pandemic affected Tokyo [301] There was large jump in cases in July Japan warned that citizens have risk of infection in \"3C\" settings: \"close spaces with poor ventilation, crowded areas, and close conservation areas\" Offices, public transit, and shops were considered to be low-risk For the month of August, bars, restaurants, and karaoke parlors were asked to close at 10 p.m Those that complied with the request were eligible for compensation of $1,900 The city announced a local version of the American Center for Disease Control, which coordinated a citywide pandemic response [302]\n\n\nFall of the Tokugawa Shogunate\nOn March 24, 1860, rōnin samurai of Mito and Satsuma assassinated Ii Naosuke, Tairō (Chief Minister) of the shogunate He was beheaded outside the Sakurada Gate of Edo Castle [92] Ii had favored the opening of Japan, and signed the Unequal Treaties This outraged many daimyo, and Ii silencing them caused the assassination His death led to instability in the shogunate [87] [92] [93]\n\n\nMeiji era\nEmperor Meiji was brought from Kyoto to lead the Meiji Restoration, which formed a new imperial government [97] In practice, he answered to reformist politicians like Ito Hirobumi and Okubo Toshimichi Japan had to decide how much tradition would carry over to a modernizing country [98] Edo was renamed Tokyo in July 1868, and Edo Castle became Tokyo Castle The emperor moved there in 1869 Samurai were abolished, and they became servants Meiji made government officials wear Western-style clothing in public Buddhist ceremonies were removed from the palace [99] In 1874, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department was established [100] The poor played little role in the upheaval, but their cynical commentary on the transition appeared in writing [97] \n\nMeiji development\nIn the 1870s, the Meiji reformers dissolved the bukechi system, putting bukechi land under the chochi rules and thereby ending a large class division [77]\n\n\nUrban planning\nIn the 1870s, the Meiji reformers dissolved the bukechi system, putting bukechi land under the chochi rules and thereby ending a large class division [77]\n\n\nWesternization\n\nElements of Western architecture were inserted into most Meiji architecture, first at the Tsukiji foreign settlement It was the designated living space for foreigners in Edo, and contained Keio University, a school for Western studies created by Fukuzawa Yukichi Yukichi would influence the Japanese government to become an \"imperial power exercising regional hegemony at the expense of its subject peoples\" The Edo Hotel opened there in 1868 It was mostly Japanese-style, but had European and British Raj architectural influence Many buildings of the time were shrunken to fit limited spaces, which gave them a \"toy model appearance\" Many foreigners left Tsukiji for Yokohama after the Ginza fire of 1872, leaving mostly Japanese consulate employees After 1899, foreigners could live wherever they wanted The foreigners at Tsukiji helped construct multiple universities in the area: Aoyama, Joshi, Meiji Gakuin, and Rikkyo, among others [110]\n\nModernization\nIn 1869, telegraph lines between Shinbashi and Yokohama started operating [98] A telephone service started in 1877, and telephone-exchange operators were the first working women in the country [98] The Tokyo Stock Exchange opened in Kabutocho in 1878 [119] A new port was constructed in 1880 [98]\n\n\nEducation\nTight control over education was exercised by the Ministry

Western-style study of science and technology Consultants were brought in from Europe and the United States Kikuchi Dairoku, a mathematician educated in Britain, became president By the 1880s, the university became a political instrument of the government bureaucracy Japanese nationalism became the centerpiece its education, and its scholars began to enter public debate as experts in many areas Study of law developed rapidly at the school, and many of its alumni became bureaucrats [128] The Tokyo Institute of Technology opened in 1881 [129]\n\n\nArt and entertainment\nAs Japan's manufactured exports declined post-bubble-collapse, it has focused more on its popular culture exports, like movies, literature, and video games, which is the impetus of the \"Cool Japan\" marketing strategy that

incendiary incident of 1905 started in response to Japan's negotiations with Russia after Japan won the Russo-Japanese War Concessions were made to Russia, including giving them control of Sakhalin, the island Japan had taken during the war Some Japanese people interpreted the negotiations as meaning Japanese people had died in the war for nothing On September 5, 30,000 protesters in Hibiya Park held a short rally, and nearby, 2,000 marched towards the Imperial Palace, causing damage and committing violence Police were limited in their ability to control the riot, so the military had to stop it, after it had gone on for three days By the end, 14 had died, 311 were arrested, and 70% of Tokyo's police boxes were destroyed It intensified social unrest for the next decade [133]\n\n\nHibiya

American James H Doolittle and 16 B-25 bombers from the U.S aircraft carrier Hornet made a surprise attack on Tokyo that boosted Allied morale At the time, the Americans had been losing the Pacific War The bombing did little physical damage, but it had an enormous psychological effect in America and Japan Japan had considered potential strikes on mainland Japan, but this new reality forced them to grow their defenses The raid led to the Battle of Midway and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign [163]\n\n\nGreater East Asia Conference\nIn November 1943, Tokyo hosted the Greater East Asia Conference,

spaces with parking spaces [186]\n\n\nArt and entertainment\nAs Japan's manufactured exports declined post-bubble-collapse, it has focused more on its popular culture exports, like movies, literature,

world, including Communist states Enormous expense was devoted to upgrading the city's physical infrastructure and making new businesses A new satellite facilitated live international broadcasts The Tokyo National Museum's coinciding ancient art exhibition promoted Japan's traditional culture to foreigners and the Japanese themselves Two buildings made for the games were the Yoyogi National Gymnasium and National Olympic Stadium The event proved a great success for the city and for Japan Japan's foreign policy expanded to include sports diplomacy, as Japanese teams visited international competitions [194] [209] [210] Harujuku grew after being adjacent to the Olympic Village [211] The Encyclopædia Britannica states that while the games had positive effects on the city, their effort in the rebuilding is exaggerated, using  America's funds from the Korean War as an example of other avenues of rebuilding [148]\n\n\n1964 Summer Olympics\nTokyo's population reached ten million as the

descended onto a garbage fill, Dream Island, east of the Sumida The army removed them by lighting Dream Island on fire, leading to garbage disposal issues This led to socialist and communists

of the internet that exists as a fully immersive and interactive virtual world. It is a collective term for a shared, interactive, and immersive virtual reality that is created by the convergence of physical and virtual objects, including augmented reality, virtual reality, and the internet.\n\n**History and Implementations**\n\nThe concept of the Metaverse has been around for several decades, with early projects including Active Worlds and The Palace. These virtual world platforms allowed users to interact with each other in a shared, three-dimensional environment. However, the first metaverse, as described by many, was Second Life, a virtual world platform launched in 2003. Second Life was a persistent, three-dimensional world that allowed users to create their own avatars and interact with each other in real-time.\n\n**Technology**\n\nThe Metaverse is a complex and multifaceted technology that requires the convergence of several different systems and technologies. Access points for the Metaverse include general-purpose computers and smartphones, augmented reality, mixed reality, and virtual reality. These technologies allow users to interact with the Metaverse in a variety of ways, from using a keyboard and mouse to using a headset and controllers.\n\n**Hardware**\n\nThe hardware requirements for the Metaverse are significant, and include high-performance computers, high-resolution displays, and advanced input devices. These devices must be able to process and render complex graphics and simulations in real-time, and provide a high level of immersion and interactivity for the user.\n\n**Software**\n\nThere has been no wide-scale adoption of a standardized technical specification for Metaverse implementations, and existing implementations rely primarily on proprietary technology. This has led to concerns about interoperability, transparency, and privacy. Interoperability is a major concern in Metaverse development, as it affects the ability of different systems and applications to work together seamlessly.\n\n**Criticism and Concerns**\n\nThe Metaverse has been criticized for a variety of reasons, including concerns about user safety, addiction, and social impact. User addiction and problematic social media use is a concern, as it can have mental and physical repercussions over a prolonged period of time. Experts are also concerned that the Metaverse could be used as an 'escape' from reality in a similar fashion to existing internet technologies.\n\n**Feasibility**\n\nThe feasibility of the Metaverse is a topic of ongoing debate, with some arguing that it is still in its infancy and requires significant investment and development. Others argue that the Metaverse is a fad that is \"dead\", having been displaced by artificial intelligence as the current hot new trend in computing.\n\n**Privacy**\n\nInformation privacy is an area of concern for the Metaverse, as related companies will likely collect users' personal information through interactions and biometric data from wearable virtual and augmented reality devices. This raises concerns about targeted advertising, the spread of misinformation, and the loss of personal privacy.\n\n**User Safety**\n\nUser safety is a concern in the Metaverse, as users may be vulnerable to exploitation, harassment, and other forms of abuse. The Metaverse also raises concerns about user addiction, as it can be designed to be highly engaging and addictive.\n\n**Regulation**\n\nWith the emergence of the Metaverse, many are calling for new regulations to protect users when they interact in the virtual world and to ensure that intellectual property (IP) laws are extended to both physical and virtual objects, respecting the rights of inventors, designers, and owners of trademarks, just as they would in the real world.\n\n**Social Issues**\n\nMetaverse development may magnify the social impacts of online echo chambers and digitally alienating spaces. The Metaverse also raises concerns about the spread of misinformation, as it can be used to manipulate users with biased content.\n\n**Lack of Adoption**\n\nAs of 2023, there has been little adoption of Metaverse technology, with Decentraland, a platform claiming to be the Metaverse, reporting that it had 8,000 daily users or fewer. Some experts have declared the Metaverse a fad that is \"dead\", having been displaced by artificial intelligence as the current hot new trend in computing.\n\n**Fiction**\n\nThe concept of the Metaverse has been explored in fiction, including in the novels \"Snow Crash\" and \"Ready Player One\". These works depict a shared VR landscape that is used to escape the problems of the real world, and raise concerns about the potential social and psychological impacts of such a technology.\n\n**See Also**\n\nFor further information on the Metaverse, see:\n\n* \"Snow Crash\" by Neal Stephenson\n* \"Ready Player One\" by Ernest Cline\n* \"The Metaverse: A New Frontier for Human Experience\" by Tom Boellstorff\n\n**References**\n\nThis article is a general overview of the Metaverse and is not a comprehensive or definitive treatment of the subject.

throughout her career. Born on 24 May 1994 in Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia, McKeon comes from a family of swimmers, with her brother David and uncle Rob Woodhouse also being notable swimmers. McKeon's career highlights include a record 11 Olympic medals, making her one of the most decorated Australian swimmers in history.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nEmma McKeon was born on 24 May 1994 in Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia. She is the sister of Kaitlin, Olympian David McKeon, and the daughter of four-time Commonwealth gold medalist and two-time Olympian Ron McKeon, both of whom are also swimmers. Her mother, Susie, was also a swimmer who competed in the Commonwealth Games, and her uncle, Rob Woodhouse, was a two-time Olympian. McKeon completed her secondary education in 2012 from The Illawarra Grammar School. Following graduation, at the age of 18, McKeon relocated to Brisbane to train under Vince Raleigh at the Chandler Aquatic Centre in 2014. In 2015, McKeon switched coaches again and began training under Michael Bohl, initially at Brisbane's St Peters Western Swimming Club before the pair relocated to Griffith University on the Gold Coast in 2017. McKeon studied a bachelor's degree in public health and health promotion with a major in nutrition.\n\n**Swimming career**\n\nMcKeon competed at the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics held in Singapore. She won a gold medal in the girls' 4 × 100 metre medley relay, silver medals in the 100 metre freestyle and the mixed 4 × 100 metre freestyle relay, and bronze medals in the 50 metre freestyle, 200 metre freestyle, and mixed 4 × 100 metre medley relay.\n\n**Olympic Games**\n\nMcKeon missed out on being selected for the London 2012 Summer Olympics after failing to place in her freestyle and butterfly events at the 2012 Olympic Trials. The then 17-year-old agonisingly finished seventh in the 100 metres freestyle, one spot away from qualifying for her first Olympics in the 400 metres freestyle relay. As a result, she took a break from swimming to help rejuvenate her drive and love of the sport.\n\n**2016 Summer Olympics**\n\nMcKeon was selected as part of the Australian team for the 2016 Summer Olympics, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Her brother David was also selected, meaning the pair were the first brother and sister to swim at an Olympic Games for Australia since John and Ilsa Konrads in 1960.

McKeon broke the record for the most Olympic medals ever received by an Australian, a title previously held by Ian Thorpe and Leisel Jones, after winning four gold and three bronze medals, and bringing her total medal count to 11.\n\n**World Championships**\n\nIn 2013, McKeon won a silver medal in the 4 × 100 metre freestyle relay at the 15th FINA World Championships held in Barcelona, Spain.

reviewing a series of cold cases from the 1960s and 1970s Anzilotti believed that Cottingham, \"between his history and the suspicions of detectives that came before me,\" could be responsible for one or more of those crimes and so began to interview Cottingham from 2003 In 2010, Cottingham pleaded guilty to a 1967 murder Then in exchange for immunity from prosecution, starting in 2014, Cottingham confessed to murdering three teenage girls [17]\n\n\n2022 developments\nOn August 26, 2022, with a non-prosecution agreement, officials in Rockland County, New York, corroborated and accepted

evidence [22] [23] [24] He pleaded guilty in a court appearance on December 5, and also officially admitted killing four other women during 1972 and 1973 in Long Island, New York: Mary Beth Heinz,

He is a member of the eccentric and macabre Addams Family, known for his quirky and often unsettling personality.\n\n**Character**\n\nUncle Fester is incorrigible and, except for the good nature of the family and the ignorance of the police, would ordinarily be under lock and key. His complexion is dead white, with pig-like eyes deeply imbedded and circled unhealthily in black. He has no teeth and is absolutely hairless. Despite his somewhat unpleasant appearance, Fester is a charming and charismatic character who has a special place in the hearts of the Addams Family.\n\nFester is a skilled fisherman, but he often employs dynamite or other unfair means to catch his prey. He also keeps falcons on the roof, which he uses for hunting. His one notable costume is a black greatcoat with an enormous collar, which he wears both in summer and winter. Fester is overweight, with pudgy little hands and feet.\n\n**Live Action TV Series**\n\nIn the 1960s television series, Fester (portrayed by Jackie Coogan) is an uncle to Morticia Addams. In one episode, he becomes perplexed when asked his last name, suggesting that he has somehow forgotten it. In several episodes, Fester refers to the Addams lineage as if it were his own, possibly implying some degree of intertwined consanguinity in both their family lines. However, the flashbacks in the episodes \"Morticia's Romance, Parts 1 and 2,\" clearly establish him as Morticia's uncle, brother of her mother, Hester Frump, a.k.a. Granny Frump (portrayed by Margaret Hamilton).\n\nIn various episodes, Fester is a partner in typical sitcom schemes with Gomez, Morticia, or Grandmama Addams, indicating no real preference for any family member over others. Fester's role in the TV series is that of a lovable but slightly eccentric uncle, who often gets himself and others into trouble with his harebrained schemes.\n\n**Animated TV Series**\n\nIn the first animated series by Hanna-Barbera, Jackie Coogan reprised his role as Fester. He also voiced that same character on an episode of The New Scooby-Doo Movies. In the animated series, Fester is a more cartoonish and exaggerated version of the character, with a greater emphasis on his eccentricities and quirks.\n\n**Films**\n\nIn the 1991 film The Addams Family, Fester (played by Christopher Lloyd) is the long-lost older brother of Gomez Addams. He was believed to have been lost in the Bermuda Triangle for 25 years. A loan shark named Abigail Craven (portrayed by Elizabeth Wilson) conspires to steal the Addams fortune using her son Gordon, who displays an eerie resemblance to the missing Fester.\n\nOn the night that the Addamses hold an annual séance to contact Fester's spirit, Gordon shows up at their door, posing as Fester. Although he is baffled and horrified by the Addamses at first, Gordon begins to take a liking to the family and their strange ways, feeling more at home with them and increasingly conflicted over Abigail's manipulations.\n\nHe ultimately rebels against her and saves the family, but sustains a lightning strike while doing so. It is revealed that he actually is Fester; his disappearance left him suffering from amnesia, and Abigail duped him into believing he was her son until the lightning restored his memories. The strike also gives Fester the ability to conduct electricity and make a light bulb glow by putting it in his mouth.\n\nIn Gomez's childhood home movies, Fester is shown to be hairless as a child (although, as Gordon, he first appears with brown, curly hair, and is later shown shaving his head).\n\n**Musical**\n\nIn the musical, Uncle Fester was played by Kevin Chamberlin in the original Broadway cast. Chamberlin received a Tony nomination for the role. He was later played by Brad Oscar, Blake Hammond, Russell Dykstra, and Shaun Rice. This incarnation of Fester serves as the musical's narrator and is in love with the moon. The subject of love is apparently his \"specialty,\" and he is able to play the ukulele when he sings a love song to the moon.\n\nHe also seems to communicate with the ancestors throughout the show more than the other characters. Fester's role in the musical is that of a romantic and quirky character, who often steals the show with his charming performances.\n\n**Video Games**\n\nUncle Fester has appeared in several Addams Family video games as a playable character. He is the protagonist of Fester's Quest, a NES game, and the main playable character in the Addams Family Values SNES game. He is also the main character in \"Electrifying\" arcade machine, where simulated \"electrical shocks\" are passed through the player as they hold on to two handles.\n\nIn these games, Fester is often depicted as a lovable but mischievous character, who uses his wits and cunning to outsmart his enemies and solve puzzles. Fester's role in the video games is that of a quirky and entertaining character, who adds a unique flavor to the gameplay experience.\n\n**Relationships**\n\nFester's relationships with the other characters in the Addams Family are complex and multifaceted. He is a loving and eccentric uncle to Morticia, and a partner in crime to Gomez. He is also a confidant and friend to Grandmama, who often relies on him for advice and support.\n\nFester's relationships with the other characters are built on a foundation of love, trust, and mutual respect.

They defeated Morocco by 12 votes to 7 [1] [2] Switzerland withdrew, due to being unable to meet FIFA's requirements This made France the third country to host two World Cups, after Mexico and Italy in 1986 and 1990 respectively France previously hosted the third edition of the World Cup in 1938 England, who hosted the competition in 1966 and won it, were among the original applicants, but later withdrew their application in favour of an ultimately successful bid to host UEFA Euro 1996.\n\n\nBribery and corruption investigations\nOn 4 June 2015, while co-operating with the FBI and the Swiss authorities, Chuck Blazer confirmed that he and other members of FIFA's executive committee were bribed during the 1998 and 2010 World Cups host selection process Blazer stated that \"we facilitated

able to safely seat 40,000 [12] The proposed national stadium, colloquially referred to as the 'Grand stade', met with controversy at every stage of planning; the stadium's location was determined by

quadrennial international football tournament contested by the men's national teams of the member associations of FIFA. The tournament was held in France from 10 June to 12 July 1998.\n\n# Host selection\n\nFrance was awarded the 1998 World Cup on 2 July 1992 by the executive committee of FIFA during a general meeting in Zürich, Switzerland. They defeated Morocco by 12 votes to 7. Switzerland withdrew, due to being unable to meet FIFA's requirements. This made France the third country to host two World Cups, after Mexico and Italy in 1986 and 1990 respectively. France previously hosted the third edition of the World Cup in 1938. England, who hosted the competition in 1966 and won it, were among the original applicants, but later withdrew their application in favour of an ultimately successful bid to host UEFA Euro 1996.\n\n# Bribery and corruption investigations\n\nOn 4 June 2015, while co-operating with the FBI and the Swiss authorities, Chuck Blazer confirmed that he and other members of FIFA's executive committee were bribed during the 1998 and 2010 World Cups host selection process. Blazer stated that \"we facilitated bribes in conjunction with the selection of the host nation for the 1998 World Cup\". Since France won the selection process it was initially thought the bribery came from its bid committee. It eventually transpired that the bribe payment was from the failed Moroccan bid.\n\n# Qualification\n\nThe qualification draw for the 1998 World Cup finals took place in the Musée du Louvre, Paris on 12 December 1995. As tournament hosts, France was exempt from the draw as was defending champion Brazil, but it was also France's first World Cup since 1986. 174 teams from six confederations participated, 24 more than in the previous round. Fourteen countries qualified from the European zone (in addition to hosts France) Ten were determined after group play – nine group winners and the best second-placed team; the other eight group runners-up were drawn into pairs of four play-off matches with the winners qualifying for the finals as well. CONMEBOL (South America) and CAF (Africa) were each given five spots in the final tournament, while three spots were contested between 30 CONCACAF members in the North and Central America and the Caribbean zone. The winner of the Oceanian zone advanced to an intercontinental play-off against the runner-up of the Asian play-off, determined by the two best second-placed teams.\n\n# List of qualified teams\n\nThe following 32 teams, shown with final pre-tournament rankings, qualified for the final tournament.\n\n# Venues\n\nFrance's bid to host the World Cup centered on a national stadium with 80,000 seats and nine other stadiums located across the country. When the finals were originally awarded in July 1992, none of the regional club grounds were of a capacity meeting FIFA's requirements – namely being able to safely seat 40,000. The proposed national stadium, colloquially referred to as the 'Grand stade', met with controversy at every stage of planning; the stadium's location was determined by politics, finance and national symbolism. As Mayor of Paris, Jacques Chirac successfully negotiated a deal with Prime Minister Édouard Balladur to bring the Stade de France, as it was now called, to the commune of Saint-Denis just north of the capital city. Construction on the stadium started in December 1995 and was completed after 26 months of work in November 1997 at a cost of ₣2.67 billion.\n\n# Innovations\n\nThis was the first FIFA World Cup where fourth officials used electronic boards, instead of cardboard.\n\n# Technologies\n\nThis was the first FIFA World Cup where fourth officials used electronic boards, instead of cardboard.\n\n# Rule changes\n\nThis was the first World Cup since the introduction of golden goals, banning of tackles from behind that endanger the safety of an opponent, and allowance of three substitutions per game.\n\n# Match officials\n\n34 referees and 33 assistants officiated in the 1998 World Cup.

Kerr attended Cairo American College in Egypt, the American Community School in Beirut, Lebanon, and Palisades High School (now Palisades Charter High School) in Los Angeles, graduating in 1983.\n\n**College Career**\n\nMinimally recruited out of high school, Kerr played basketball at the University of Arizona from 1983 to 1988. Kerr injured his knee playing in the 1986 FIBA World Championship, forcing him to miss the Wildcats' entire 1986-87 season.\n\n**Professional Career**\n\nKerr was selected by the Phoenix Suns in the second round of the 1988 NBA draft as the 50th overall pick.

He played five seasons for the Bulls and typically came off of the bench, playing the role of three-point shooting specialist. The Bulls made the playoffs in the 1993-94 and 1994-95 seasons, but without Michael Jordan's presence for all of 1994 and much of 1995, the team was unable to advance to the Finals. However, with Jordan back full-time for the 1995-96 season, the Bulls set a then-NBA record of 72-10 and defeated the Seattle SuperSonics in the 1996 NBA Finals in six games.\n\n**San Antonio Spurs (1999-2001)**\n\nIn January 1999, Kerr was acquired by the San Antonio Spurs in a sign-and-trade deal with the Bulls, whereby Chuck Person and a first-round pick in the 2000 NBA draft was sent to Chicago.

In return, the Trail Blazers received Charles Smith, Amal McCaskill, and Antonio Daniels. Kerr played in nearly every game (75) the following year, which was his final season in the league. In Game 6 of the 2003 Western Conference Finals against the Dallas Mavericks, Kerr made four second-half three-pointers that helped the Spurs win the game and eliminate Dallas from the playoffs. The Spurs eventually won the NBA championship by beating the New Jersey Nets during the 2003 NBA Finals in six games.\n\n**Retirement**\n\nKerr announced his retirement after the 2003 NBA Finals. During his NBA career, Kerr won five NBA championships. He retired as the league's all-time leader in single-season three-point shooting percentage (.524 in 1994-95) and career three-point shooting percentage (.454).\n\n**Broadcaster and Commentator**\n\nIn 2003, Kerr became a broadcast analyst for Turner Network Television (TNT), offering commentary alongside analyst Marv Albert.

Kerr coached in the 2014 Summer League for the Warriors. During the 2014-15 season, the team's offense employed elements of the triangle offense from his playing days in Chicago under Phil Jackson, the spacing and pace of Gregg Popovich in San Antonio, and the uptempo principles Mike D'Antoni and later Alvin Gentry used in Phoenix when Kerr was the general manager.\n\n**2014-15 Season: Emergence of Stephen Curry and the Beginning of a Dynasty**\n\nOn May 14, 2014, Kerr reached an agreement to become the head coach for the Golden State Warriors, succeeding Mark Jackson in a five-year, $25 million deal. Kerr coached in the 2014 Summer League for the Warriors. During the 2014-15 season, the team's offense employed elements of the triangle offense from his playing days in Chicago under Phil Jackson, the spacing and pace of Gregg Popovich in San Antonio, and the uptempo principles Mike D'Antoni and later Alvin Gentry used in Phoenix when Kerr was the general manager.\n\n**2015-16: Several-Month Absence Amid Historic Season**\n\nAfter the first two days of the defending champion Warriors' training camp, Kerr took an indefinite leave of absence to rehabilitate his back, which had caused problems since the 2015 NBA Finals. Around this time, assistant coach Luke Walton assumed Kerr's coaching duties. Kerr missed all of 2015 and most of January 2016, although technically the NBA credited Walton's win-loss record to Kerr. Kerr said \"I think it's ridiculous,\" when asked about getting all of Walton's wins. On January 22, 2016, Kerr returned to coaching after missing 43 games, but warned he might need to miss games occasionally if there was a recurrence of the headaches and pain related to the spinal fluid leak that sidelined him. The Warriors went 39-4 with interim coach Luke Walton. The Warriors went 34-5 after Kerr returned to coaching, and the team broke the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls 72-10 record by winning 73 games. For his record-breaking season, Stephen Curry was named the league's first ever unanimous MVP in history, becoming the 11th player in history to win the award in consecutive seasons and the first guard to do so since Steve Nash in 2004-05 and 2005-06. His scoring average increase of 6.3 is the largest ever by a reigning MVP. Kerr became the first person in NBA history to be a part of 70-win teams as a player and head coach and was named 2015-16 NBA Coach of the Year. Kerr led the Warriors to the 2016 NBA Finals, where they would again face the Cleveland Cavaliers, but the Warriors lost in seven games despite a 3-1 lead.\n\n**2016-19: Arrival of Kevin Durant, Back to Back Championships**\n\nOn July 4, 2016, Golden State had made a landmark acquisition, signing free agent and 7-time NBA All-Star Kevin Durant and the Warriors were immediately hailed as a \"superteam\" by the media and fans, forming a new All-Star \"Fantastic Four\" of Durant, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green. On November 20, 2016, the NBA announced that Kerr had been fined $25,000 for public criticism of officiating during a radio interview with KNBR 680 three days prior. The Warriors broke over 20 NBA records on their way to equaling their 2014-15 regular-season record of 67-15, their second most wins in franchise history.\n\n**2019-20: Injury-Plagued Season Before a Return to the Promise Land**\n\nDuring the 2019-20 season, with Thompson out for the year and franchise point guard Stephen Curry only playing five games due to a hand injury, the Warriors finished with the worst record (15-50) in the league. It marked the first time in Kerr's coaching career that he had missed the playoffs.\n\n**2020-21: Return to the Playoffs**\n\nIn 2020-21, with Thompson still out due to an Achilles tear but Curry healthy, the Warriors qualified for the newly implemented play-in tournament, but ultimately did not qualify for the playoffs for the second straight season.\n\n**2021-22: Return to the Finals**\n\nThe Warriors returned to the playoffs in 2021-22 and reached the 2022 NBA Finals. They defeated the Boston Celtics in six games, giving Kerr his fourth championship as a head coach and his ninth championship overall.\n\n**United States National Team**\n\nKerr was an assistant coach on the gold medal-winning 2020 United States men's Olympic basketball team. In December 2021, he was named head coach of the U.S men's basketball team. In 2023, Kerr led the United States team to a disappointing fourth place finish at the FIBA World Cup as the U.S failed to win a medal for the second consecutive tournament after an overtime loss to Canada in the bronze medal game, 127-118.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nKerr is the first head coach in NBA history to lead his team to 67 or more wins in three consecutive seasons. Kerr was named one of the Top 15 Coaches in NBA History in 2022, when the league commemorated its 75th anniversary.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nKerr married Margot Brennan, his college sweetheart, in 1990. They have three children. He is a keen soccer fan and an avid supporter of Liverpool. In 2023, Kerr bought a minority stake in La Liga club Mallorca.\n\n**Political Views and Activism**\n\nPrior to and following the 2016 United States presidential election, Kerr has been publicly critical of Donald Trump. In an interview following that election, he voiced the opinion that Trump's rise to power was based on insults against women and minorities. He compared Trump's campaign performances and the crude responses of his supporters to the sensationalism of The Jerry Springer Show. Kerr made clear his \"disgust\" with Trump's disrespectful public discourse and disappointment with Trump's leadership of the country. On October 27, 2020, an ad created by the anti-Trump Republican Lincoln Project Super PAC was first broadcast. In it, along with Philadelphia 76ers coach Doc Rivers, Kerr endorsed Joe Biden for President in the November presidential election. In the advertisement, he said, \"I stand for truth over lies,\" \"categorically reject white supremacy,\" and \"believe a presidency should be transparent.\"\n\n**Career Statistics**\n\nNBA\n\nRegular

{"title": "Anne_Boleyn", "content": "\nEarly years\nAnne was the daughter of Thomas Boleyn, later Earl of Wiltshire and Earl of Ormond, and his wife, Elizabeth Howard, who was the eldest daughter of Thomas Howard, then Earl of Surrey and future 2nd Duke of Norfolk, and his first wife Elizabeth Tilney Anne's date of birth is unknown.\n\n\nThe Netherlands and France\nAnne's father, Thomas, continued his diplomatic career under Henry VIII In Europe, his charm won many admirers, including Margaret of Austria, daughter of Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor During this period, Margaret ruled the Netherlands on her nephew Charles's behalf and was so impressed with Thomas Boleyn that she offered his daughter Anne a place in her household [31] Ordinarily, a girl had to be 12 years old to have such an honour, but Anne may have been younger, as Margaret affectionately called her la petite Boulin   [sic] [32] Anne made a good impression in the Netherlands with her manners and studiousness; Margaret reported that she was well spoken and pleasant for her young age, [33] and told Thomas that his daughter was \"so presentable and so pleasant, considering her youthful age, that I am more beholden to you for sending her to me, than you to me\" [34] Anne stayed at the Court of Savoy in Mechelen from spring 1513 until her father arranged for her to attend Henry VIII's sister Mary, who was about to marry Louis XII of France in October 1514.\n\n\nAt the court of Henry VIII: 1522–1533\nAnne was recalled to marry her Irish cousin, James Butler, a man several years older than her, who was living at the English court [40] The marriage was intended to settle a dispute over the title and estates of the Earldom of Ormond The 7th Earl of Ormond died in 1515, leaving his daughters, Margaret Boleyn and Anne St Leger, as co-heiresses In Ireland, the great-great-grandson of the third earl, Sir Piers Butler, contested the will and claimed the earldom himself He was already in possession of Kilkenny Castle, the earls' ancestral seat Sir Thomas Boleyn, being the son of the eldest daughter, believed the title properly belonged to him and protested to his brother-in-law, the Duke of Norfolk, who spoke to the king about the matter Henry, fearful the dispute could ignite civil war in Ireland, sought to resolve the matter by arranging an alliance between Piers's son, James and Anne Boleyn She would bring her Ormond inheritance as dowry and thus end the dispute The plan ended in failure, perhaps because Sir Thomas hoped for a grander marriage for his daughter or because he himself coveted the titles Whatever the reason, the marriage negotiations came to a complete halt [41] James Butler later married Lady Joan Fitzgerald, daughter and heiress of James FitzGerald, 10th Earl of Desmond and Amy O'Brien.\n\n\nHenry's annulment\nIt is probable that Henry had thought of the idea of annulment (not divorce as commonly assumed) much earlier than this as he strongly desired a male heir to secure the Tudor claim to the crown [57] Before Henry VII ascended the throne, England was beset by civil warfare over rival claims to the crown, and Henry VIII wanted to avoid similar uncertainty over the succession He and Catherine had no living sons: all Catherine's children except Mary died in infancy [58] Catherine had first come to England to be bride to Henry's brother Arthur, who died soon after their marriage Since Spain and England still wanted an alliance, Pope Julius II granted a dispensation for their marriage on the grounds that Catherine was \"perchance\" (forsum) still a virgin [59]\n\n\nPremarital role and marriage\nEven before her marriage, Anne Boleyn was able to grant petitions, receive diplomats and give patronage, and had an influence over Henry to plead the cause of foreign diplomats [79]\n\n\nQueen of England: 1533–1536\nCatherine was formally stripped of her title as queen and Anne was consequently crowned queen consort on 1 June 1533 in a magnificent ceremony at Westminster Abbey with a banquet afterwards [94] She was the last queen consort of England to be crowned separately from her husband [95] Unlike any other queen consort, Anne was crowned with St Edward's Crown, which had previously been used to crown only monarchs [96] Historian Alice Hunt suggests that this was done because Anne's pregnancy was visible by then and the child was presumed to be male [97] On the previous day, Anne had taken part in an elaborate procession through the streets of London seated in a litter of \"white cloth of gold\" that rested on two palfreys clothed to the ground in white damask, while the barons of the Cinque Ports held a canopy of cloth of gold over her head In accordance with tradition, she wore white, and on her head, a gold coronet beneath which her long dark hair hung down freely [98] The public's response to her appearance was lukewarm [99]\n\n\nStruggle for a son\nAfter her coronation, Anne settled into a quiet routine at the king's favourite residence, Greenwich Palace, to prepare for the birth of her baby The child was a girl, born slightly prematurely on 7 September 1533 [106] She was christened Elizabeth, probably in honour of either Anne's mother Elizabeth Howard or Henry's mother Elizabeth of York, or both [107] The birth of a girl was a heavy blow to her parents, who had confidently expected a boy All but one of the royal physicians and astrologers had predicted a son and the French king had been asked to stand as his godfather Now the prepared letters announcing the birth of a prince had an s hastily added to them to read princes [s] and the traditional jousting tournament for the birth of an heir was cancelled [108] [109]\n\n\nStrife with the king\nThe king and his new queen enjoyed a reasonably happy accord with periods of calm and affection Anne's sharp intelligence, political acumen and forward manner, although desirable in a mistress, were at the time unacceptable in a wife She was once reported to have spoken to her uncle in words that \"shouldn't be used to a dog\" [113] After a stillbirth or miscarriage as early as Christmas 1534, Henry was discussing with Cranmer and Cromwell the possibility of divorcing her without having to return to Catherine [114] Nothing came of the matter as the royal couple reconciled and spent the summer of 1535 on progress, visiting Gloucester and hunting in the local countryside [115] By October, she was again pregnant.\n\n\nDownfall and execution: 1536\nOn 8 January 1536, news of Catherine of Aragon's death reached Anne and the king, who was overjoyed The following day, Henry wore yellow, a symbol of joy and celebration in England but of mourning in Spain, from head to toe, and celebrated Catherine's death with festivities [119] [120] With Catherine dead, Anne attempted to make peace with Mary [121] Mary rebuffed Anne's overtures, perhaps because of rumours circulating that Catherine had been poisoned by Anne or Henry [122] These began after the discovery during her embalming that Catherine's heart was blackened Modern medical experts are in agreement that this was not the result of poisoning, but from heart cancer, the cause of her death and an extremely rare condition that was not understood at the time [113]\n\n\nCharges of adultery, incest and treason\nAnne's biographer Eric Ives believes that her fall and execution were primarily engineered by her former ally Thomas Cromwell [135] The conversations between Chapuys and Cromwell indicate Cromwell as the instigator of the plot to remove Anne; evidence of this is seen through letters written from Chapuys to Charles V [136] Anne argued with Cromwell over the redistribution of Church revenues and over foreign policy She advocated that revenues be distributed to charitable and educational institutions; and she favoured a French alliance Cromwell preferred an imperial alliance and insisted on filling the king's depleted coffers For these reasons, Ives suggests, \"Anne Boleyn had become a major threat to Thomas Cromwell.\" [137] Cromwell's biographer John Schofield, on the other hand, contends that no power struggle existed between Anne and Cromwell and that \"not a trace can be found of a Cromwellian conspiracy against Anne .. Cromwell became involved in the royal marital drama only when Henry ordered him onto the case.\" Schofield claims that evidence for the power struggle between Anne and Cromwell comprises no more than \"fly-by-night stories from Alesius and the Spanish Chronicle, [d] words of Chapuys taken out of context, and an untrustworthy translation of the Calendar of State Papers.\" [141] Cromwell did not manufacture the accusations of adultery, though he and other officials used them to bolster Henry's case against Anne [142] Warnicke questions whether Cromwell could have or wished to manipulate the king in such a matter Such a bold attempt by Cromwell, given the limited evidence, could have risked his office, even his life [143] Henry himself issued the crucial instructions: his officials, including Cromwell, carried them out [144] The result was by modern standards a legal travesty; [145] however, the rules of the time were not bent in order to assure a conviction; there was no need to tamper with rules that guaranteed the desired result since law at the time was an engine of state, not a mechanism for justice [146]\n\n\nFinal hours\nThe accused were found guilty and condemned to death George Boleyn and the other accused men were executed on 17 May 1536 William Kingston, the Constable of the Tower, reported that Anne seemed very happy and ready to be done with life [159] Henry commuted Anne's sentence from burning to beheading, and rather than have a queen beheaded with the common axe, he brought an expert swordsman from Saint-Omer in France to perform the execution.\n\n\nDeath and burial\nThe ermine mantle was removed, and Anne lifted off her headdress and tucked her hair under a coif [179] After a brief farewell to her weeping ladies and a request for prayers, she knelt down; one of the ladies tied a blindfold over Anne's eyes [179] She knelt upright, in the French style of beheadings [180] Her final prayer consisted of her continually repeating, \"Jesu receive my soul; O Lord God have pity on my soul.\" [181]\n\n\nRecognition and legacy\nNicholas Sander, a Catholic recusant born c. 1530, was committed to deposing Elizabeth I and re-establishing Catholicism in England In his De Origine ac Progressu schismatis Anglicani (The Rise and Growth of the Anglican Schism), published in 1585, he was the first to write that Anne had six fingers on her right hand [191] Since physical deformities were generally interpreted as a sign of evil, it is unlikely that Anne Boleyn would have gained Henry's romantic attention had she had any [192] Upon exhumation in 1876, no abnormalities were discovered Her frame was described as delicate, approximately 5 feet 3 inches (1.60 m), \"the hand and feet bones indicated delicate and well-shaped hands and feet, with tapering fingers and a narrow foot\" [193]\n\n\nAppearance and portraits\nAnne's appearance has been much discussed by historians, as all of her portraits were destroyed following an order by Henry VIII, who wanted to erase her from history [197] Many surviving depictions of her may be copies of a lost original that apparently existed as late as 1773 One of the only contemporary likenesses of Anne was captured on a medal referred to as \"The Moost Happi Medal\" which was struck in 1536, probably to celebrate her pregnancy which occurred around that time [198] The other possible portrait of Anne was a secret locket ring that her daughter Elizabeth I possessed and was taken from one of her fingers at her death in 1603 [199]\n\n\nHolbein sketches\nHans Holbein originally painted Anne's portrait and also sketched her during her lifetime There are two surviving sketches that have been identified to be of Anne, by historians and people who knew her Most scholars believe that Anne cannot be one of the two, as the portrayals do not look similar to each other, whilst others think that they do show the same woman but in one sketch she is pregnant, whilst in the other she is not [200] [201]\n\n\nFaith and spirituality\nBecause of Anne's early exposure to court life, she had powerful influences around her for most of her life These early influences were mostly women who were engaged with art, history and religion Eric Ives described the women around Anne as \"aristocratic women seeking spiritual fulfillment\" [209] They included Queen Claude, of whose court Anne was a member, and Marguerite of Angoulême, who was a well-known figure during the Renaissance and held strong religious views that she expressed through poetry These women along with Anne's immediate family members, such as her father, may have had a large influence on Anne's personal faith.\n\n\nLegends\nMany legends and stories about Anne Boleyn have existed over the centuries One is that she was secretly buried in Salle Church in Norfolk under a black slab near the tombs of her ancestors [217] Her body was said to have rested in an Essex church on its journey to Norfolk Another is that her heart, at her request, [218] was buried in Erwarton (Arwarton) Church, Suffolk by her uncle Sir Philip Parker [219]\n\n\nIssue\n\n\nAncestry\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Anne Boleyn**\n\nAnne Boleyn (c. 1501 – 19 May 1536) was the second wife of Henry VIII of England, the mother of Queen Elizabeth I, and the second queen to marry Henry after the death of his first wife, Catherine of Aragon. She played a significant role in the English Reformation and was a central figure in the tumultuous politics of the Tudor court.\n\n**Early years**\n\nAnne was the daughter of Thomas Boleyn, later Earl of Wiltshire and Earl of Ormond, and his wife, Elizabeth Howard, who was the eldest daughter of Thomas Howard, then Earl of Surrey and future 2nd Duke of Norfolk, and his first wife Elizabeth Tilney. Anne's date of birth is unknown.\n\n**The Netherlands and France**\n\nAnne's father, Thomas, continued his diplomatic career under Henry VIII In Europe, his charm won many admirers, including Margaret of Austria, daughter of Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor. During this period, Margaret ruled the Netherlands on her nephew Charles's behalf and was so impressed with Thomas Boleyn that she offered his daughter Anne a place in her household. Ordinarily, a girl had to be 12 years old to have such an honour, but Anne may have been younger, as Margaret affectionately called her la petite Boulin. Anne made a good impression in the Netherlands with her manners and studiousness; Margaret reported that she was well spoken and pleasant for her young age, and told Thomas that his daughter was \"so presentable and so pleasant, considering her youthful age, that I am more beholden to you for sending her to me, than you to me\". Anne stayed at the Court of Savoy in Mechelen from spring 1513 until her father arranged for her to attend Henry VIII's sister Mary, who was about to marry Louis XII of France in October 1514.\n\n**At the court of Henry VIII: 1522–1533**\n\nAnne was recalled to marry her Irish cousin, James Butler, a man several years older than her, who was living at the English court. The marriage was intended to settle a dispute over the title and estates of the Earldom of Ormond. The 7th Earl of Ormond died in 1515, leaving his daughters, Margaret Boleyn and Anne St Leger, as co-heiresses. In Ireland, the great-great-grandson of the third earl, Sir Piers Butler, contested the will and claimed the earldom himself. He was already in possession of Kilkenny Castle, the earls' ancestral seat. Sir Thomas Boleyn, being the son of the eldest daughter, believed the title properly belonged to him and protested to his brother-in-law, the Duke of Norfolk, who spoke to the king about the matter. Henry, fearful the dispute could ignite civil war in Ireland, sought to resolve the matter by arranging an alliance between Piers's son, James and Anne Boleyn. She would bring her Ormond inheritance as dowry and thus end the dispute. The plan ended in failure, perhaps because Sir Thomas hoped for a grander marriage for his daughter or because he himself coveted the titles. Whatever the reason, the marriage negotiations came to a complete halt. James Butler later married Lady Joan Fitzgerald, daughter and heiress of James FitzGerald, 10th Earl of Desmond and Amy O'Brien.\n\n**Henry's annulment**\n\nIt is probable that Henry had thought of the idea of annulment (not divorce as commonly assumed) much earlier than this as he strongly desired a male heir to secure the Tudor claim to the crown. Before Henry VII ascended the throne, England was beset by civil warfare over rival claims to the crown, and Henry VIII wanted to avoid similar uncertainty over the succession. He and Catherine had no living sons: all Catherine's children except Mary died in infancy. Catherine had first come to England to be bride to Henry's brother Arthur, who died soon after their marriage. Since Spain and England still wanted an alliance, Pope Julius II granted a dispensation for their marriage on the grounds that Catherine was \"perchance\" (forsum) still a virgin.\n\n**Premarital role and marriage**\n\nEven before her marriage, Anne Boleyn was able to grant petitions, receive diplomats and give patronage, and had an influence over Henry to plead the cause of foreign diplomats.\n\n**Queen of England: 1533–1536**\n\nCatherine was formally stripped of her title as queen and Anne was consequently crowned queen consort on 1 June 1533 in a magnificent ceremony at Westminster Abbey with a banquet afterwards. She was the last queen consort of England to be crowned separately from her husband. Unlike any other queen consort, Anne was crowned with St Edward's Crown, which had previously been used to crown only monarchs. Historian Alice Hunt suggests that this was done because Anne's pregnancy was visible by then and the child was presumed to be male. On the previous day, Anne had taken part in an elaborate procession through the streets of London seated in a litter of \"white cloth of gold\" that rested on two palfreys clothed to the ground in white damask, while the barons of the Cinque Ports held a canopy of cloth of gold over her head. In accordance with tradition, she wore white, and on her head, a gold coronet beneath which her long dark hair hung down freely. The public's response to her appearance was lukewarm.\n\n**Struggle for a son**\n\nAfter her coronation, Anne settled into a quiet routine at the king's favourite residence, Greenwich Palace, to prepare for the birth of her baby. The child was a girl, born slightly prematurely on 7 September 1533. She was christened Elizabeth, probably in honour of either Anne's mother Elizabeth Howard or Henry's mother Elizabeth of York, or both. The birth of a girl was a heavy blow to her parents, who had confidently expected a boy. All but one of the royal physicians and astrologers had predicted a son and the French king had been asked to stand as his godfather. Now the prepared letters announcing the birth of a prince had an s hastily added to them to read princes [s] and the traditional jousting tournament for the birth of an heir was cancelled.\n\n**Strife with the king**\n\nThe king and his new queen enjoyed a reasonably happy accord with periods of calm and affection. Anne's sharp intelligence, political acumen and forward manner, although desirable in a mistress, were at the time unacceptable in a wife. She was once reported to have spoken to her uncle in words that \"shouldn't be used to a dog\". After a stillbirth or miscarriage as early as Christmas 1534, Henry was discussing with Cranmer and Cromwell the possibility of divorcing her without having to return to Catherine. Nothing came of the matter as the royal couple reconciled and spent the summer of 1535 on progress, visiting Gloucester and hunting in the local countryside. By October, she was again pregnant.\n\n**Downfall and execution: 1536**\n\nOn 8 January 1536, news of Catherine of Aragon's death reached Anne and the king, who was overjoyed. The following day, Henry wore yellow, a symbol of joy and celebration in England but of mourning in Spain, from head to toe, and celebrated Catherine's death with festivities. With Catherine dead, Anne attempted to make peace with Mary. Mary rebuffed Anne's overtures, perhaps because of rumours circulating that Catherine had been poisoned by Anne or Henry. These began after the discovery during her embalming that Catherine's heart was blackened. Modern medical experts are in agreement that this was not the result of poisoning, but from heart cancer, the cause of her death and an extremely rare condition that was not understood at the time.\n\n**Charges of adultery, incest and treason**\n\nAnne's biographer Eric Ives believes that her fall and execution were primarily engineered by her former ally Thomas Cromwell. The conversations between Chapuys and Cromwell indicate Cromwell as the instigator of the plot to remove Anne; evidence of this is seen through letters written from Chapuys to Charles V. Anne argued with Cromwell over the redistribution of Church revenues and over foreign policy. She advocated that revenues be distributed to charitable and educational institutions; and she favoured a French alliance. Cromwell preferred an imperial alliance and insisted on filling the king's depleted coffers. For these reasons, Ives suggests, \"Anne Boleyn had become a major threat to Thomas Cromwell.\" Cromwell's biographer John Schofield, on the other hand, contends that no power struggle existed between Anne and Cromwell and that \"not a trace can be found of a Cromwellian conspiracy against Anne... Cromwell became involved in the royal marital drama only when Henry ordered him onto the case.\" Schofield claims that evidence for the power struggle between Anne and Cromwell comprises no more than \"fly-by-night stories from Alesius and the Spanish Chronicle, [d] words of Chapuys taken out of context, and an untrustworthy translation of the Calendar of State Papers.\" Cromwell did not manufacture the accusations of adultery, though he and other officials used them to bolster Henry's case against Anne. Warnicke questions whether Cromwell could have or wished to manipulate the king in such a matter. Such a bold attempt by Cromwell, given the limited evidence, could have risked his office, even his life. Henry himself issued the crucial instructions: his officials, including Cromwell, carried them out. The result was by modern standards a legal travesty; however, the rules of the time were not bent in order to assure a conviction; there was no need to tamper with rules that guaranteed the desired result since law at the time was an engine of state, not a mechanism for justice.\n\n**Final hours**\n\nThe accused were found guilty and condemned to death. George Boleyn and the other accused men were executed on 17 May 1536. William Kingston, the Constable of the Tower, reported that Anne seemed very happy and ready to be done with life. Henry commuted Anne's sentence from burning to beheading, and rather than have a queen beheaded with the common axe, he brought an expert swordsman from Saint-Omer in France to perform the execution.\n\n**Death and burial**\n\nThe ermine mantle was removed, and Anne lifted off her headdress and tucked her hair under a coif. After a brief farewell to her weeping ladies and a request for prayers, she knelt down; one of the ladies tied a blindfold over Anne's eyes. She knelt upright, in the French style of beheadings. Her final prayer consisted of her continually repeating, \"Jesu receive my soul; O Lord God have pity on my soul.\"\n\n**Recognition and legacy**\n\nNicholas Sander, a Catholic recusant born c. 1530, was committed to deposing Elizabeth I and re-establishing Catholicism in England. In his De Origine ac Progressu schismatis Anglicani (The Rise and Growth of the Anglican Schism), published in 1585, he was the first to write that Anne had six fingers on her right hand. Since physical deformities were generally interpreted as a sign of evil, it is unlikely that Anne Boleyn would have gained Henry's romantic attention had she had any. Upon exhumation in 1876, no abnormalities were discovered. Her frame was described as delicate, approximately 5 feet 3 inches (1.60 m), \"the hand and feet bones indicated delicate and well-shaped hands and feet, with tapering fingers and a narrow foot.\"\n\n**Appearance and portraits**\n\nAnne's appearance has been much discussed by historians, as all of her portraits were destroyed following an order by Henry VIII, who wanted to erase her from history. Many surviving depictions of her may be copies of a lost original that apparently existed as late as 1773. One of the only contemporary likenesses of Anne was captured on a medal referred to as \"The Moost Happi Medal\" which was struck in 1536, probably to celebrate her pregnancy which occurred around that time. The other possible portrait of Anne was a secret locket ring that her daughter Elizabeth I possessed and was taken from one of her fingers at her death in 1603.\n\n**Holbein sketches**\n\nHans Holbein originally painted Anne's portrait and also sketched her during her lifetime. There are two surviving sketches that have been identified to be of Anne, by historians and people who knew her. Most scholars believe that Anne cannot be one of the two, as the portrayals do not look similar to each other, whilst others think that they do show the same woman but in one sketch she is pregnant, whilst in the other she is not.\n\n**Faith and spirituality**\n\nBecause of Anne's early exposure to court life, she had powerful influences around her for most of her life. These early influences were mostly women who were engaged with art, history and religion. Eric Ives described the women around Anne as \"aristocratic women seeking spiritual fulfillment\". They included Queen Claude, of whose court Anne was a member, and Marguerite of Angoulême, who was a well-known figure during the Renaissance and held strong religious views that she expressed through poetry. These women along with Anne's immediate family members, such as her father, may have had a large influence on Anne's personal faith.\n\n**Legends**\n\nMany legends and stories about Anne Boleyn have existed over the centuries. One is that she was secretly buried in Salle Church in Norfolk under a black slab near the tombs of her ancestors. Her body was said to have rested in an Essex church on its journey to Norfolk. Another is that her heart, at her request, was buried in Erwarton (Arwarton) Church, Suffolk by her uncle Sir Philip Parker.\n\n**Issue**\n\nElizabeth I of England (7 September 1533 – 24 March 1587) was the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. She became Queen of England and Ireland and is remembered as one of the most successful and influential monarchs in English history.\n\n**Ancestry**\n\nAnne Boleyn was a member of the Boleyn family, a minor aristocratic family of Norman descent. Her ancestors included the Earls of Ormond, the Earls of Wiltshire, and the Viscounts Rochford.\n\n**See also**\n\n* The Tudors\n* The Six Wives of Henry VIII\n* Henry VIII\n* Elizabeth I of England\n* Thomas Boleyn\n* George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford\n* Jane Rochford\n* Anne of Cleves\n* Catherine Howard\n* Catherine Parr\n* Edward VI of England\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on information from various sources, including historical accounts, biographies, and scholarly articles.\n* The information in this article is subject to change as new research and discoveries are made.\n* The article is written in a neutral and objective tone, without any personal opinions or biases.\n* The article includes a comprehensive bibliography and list of references for further reading.\n\n**References**\n\n* Ives, E.

one of the ladies tied a blindfold over Anne's eyes [179] She knelt upright, in the French style of beheadings [180] Her final prayer consisted of her continually repeating, \"Jesu receive my soul; O Lord God have pity on my soul.\" [181]\n\n\nRecognition and legacy\nNicholas Sander, a Catholic recusant born c. 1530, was committed to deposing Elizabeth I and re-establishing Catholicism in England In his De Origine ac Progressu schismatis Anglicani (The Rise and Growth of the Anglican Schism), published in 1585, he was the first to write that Anne had six fingers on her right hand [191] Since physical deformities were generally interpreted as a sign of evil, it is unlikely that Anne Boleyn would have gained Henry's romantic attention had she had any [192] Upon exhumation in 1876, no abnormalities were discovered Her frame was described as delicate, approximately 5 feet 3 inches (1.60 m), \"the hand and feet bones indicated delicate and well-shaped hands and feet, with tapering fingers and a narrow foot\" [193]\n\n\nAppearance and portraits\nAnne's appearance has been much discussed by historians, as all of her portraits were destroyed following an order by Henry VIII, who wanted to erase her from history [197] Many surviving depictions of her may be copies of a lost original that apparently existed as late as 1773 One of the only contemporary likenesses of Anne was captured on a medal referred to as \"The Moost Happi Medal\" which was struck in 1536, probably to celebrate her pregnancy which occurred around that time [198] The other possible portrait of Anne was a secret locket ring that her daughter Elizabeth I possessed and was taken from one of her fingers at her death in 1603 [199]\n\n\nHolbein sketches\nHans Holbein originally painted Anne's portrait and also sketched her during her lifetime There are two surviving sketches that have been identified to be of Anne, by historians and people who knew her Most scholars believe that Anne cannot be one of the two, as the portrayals do not look similar to each other, whilst others think that they do show the same woman but in one sketch she is pregnant, whilst in the other she is not [200] [201]\n\n\nFaith and spirituality\nBecause of Anne's early exposure to court life, she had powerful influences around her for most of her life These early influences were mostly women who were engaged with art, history and religion Eric Ives described the women around Anne as \"aristocratic women seeking spiritual fulfillment\" [209] They included Queen Claude, of whose court Anne was a member, and Marguerite of Angoulême, who was a well-known figure during the Renaissance and held strong religious views that she expressed through poetry These women along with Anne's immediate family members, such as her father, may have had a large influence on Anne's personal faith.\n\n\nLegends\nMany legends and stories about Anne Boleyn have existed over the centuries One is that she was secretly buried in Salle Church in Norfolk under a black slab near the tombs of her ancestors [217] Her body was said to have rested in an Essex church on its journey to Norfolk Another is that her heart, at her request, [218] was buried in Erwarton (Arwarton) Church, Suffolk by her uncle Sir Philip Parker [219]\n\n\nIssue\n\n\nAncestry\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Piero from Vinci\"), [9] [10] [c] was born on 15 April 1452 in, or close to, the Tuscan hill town of Vinci, 20 miles from Florence [11] [12] [d] He was born out of wedlock to Piero da Vinci (Ser Piero

last was born when Leonardo was 46 years old) [24] and with whom he had very little contact [g]\n\n\nVerrocchio's workshop\nIn the mid-1460s, Leonardo's family moved to Florence, which at the time was the centre of Christian Humanist thought and culture [33] Around the age of 14, [25] he became a garzone (studio boy) in the workshop of Andrea del Verrocchio, who was the leading Florentine painter and sculptor of his time [33] This was about the time of the death of Verrocchio's master, the great sculptor Donatello [h] Leonardo became an apprentice by the age of 17 and remained in training for seven years [35] Other famous painters apprenticed in the workshop or associated with it include Ghirlandaio, Perugino, Botticelli, and Lorenzo di Credi [36] [37] Leonardo was exposed to both theoretical training and a wide range of technical skills, [38] including drafting, chemistry, metallurgy, metal working, plaster casting, leather working, mechanics, and woodwork, as well as the artistic skills of drawing, painting, sculpting, and modelling [39] [i]\n\n\nFirst Florentine period (1472–c. 1482)\nBy 1472, at the age of 20, Leonardo qualified as a master in the Guild of Saint Luke, the guild of artists and doctors of medicine, [j] but even after his father set him up in his own workshop, his attachment to Verrocchio was such that he continued to collaborate and live with him [36] [44] Leonardo's earliest known dated work is a 1473 pen-and-ink drawing of the Arno valley (see below) [37] [45] [k] According to Vasari, the young Leonardo was the first to suggest making the Arno river a navigable channel between Florence and Pisa [46]\n\n\nFirst Milanese period (c. 1482–1499)\nLeonardo worked in Milan from 1482 until 1499 He was commissioned to paint the Virgin of the Rocks for the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception and The Last Supper for the monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie [51] In the spring of 1485, Leonardo travelled to Hungary (on behalf of Sforza) to meet king Matthias Corvinus, and was commissioned by him to paint a Madonna [52] In 1490 he was called as a consultant, together with Francesco di Giorgio Martini, for the building site of the cathedral of Pavia [53] [54] and was struck by the equestrian statue of Regisole, of which he left a sketch [55] Leonardo was employed on many other projects for Sforza, such as preparation of floats and pageants for special occasions; a drawing of, and wooden model for, a competition to design the cupola for Milan Cathedral; [56] and a model for a huge equestrian monument to Ludovico's predecessor Francesco Sforza This would have surpassed in size the only two large equestrian statues of the Renaissance, Donatello's Gattamelata in Padua and Verrocchio's Bartolomeo Colleoni in Venice, and became known as the Gran Cavallo [37] Leonardo completed a model for the horse and made detailed plans for its casting, [37] but in November 1494, Ludovico gave the metal to his brother-in-law to be used for a cannon to defend the city from Charles VIII of France [37]\n\n\nSecond Florentine period (1500–1508)\nWhen Ludovico Sforza was overthrown by France in 1500, Leonardo fled Milan for Venice, accompanied by his assistant Salaì and friend, the mathematician Luca Pacioli [61] In Venice, Leonardo was employed as a military architect and engineer, devising methods to defend the city from naval attack [36] On his return to Florence in 1500, he and his household were guests of the Servite monks at the monastery of Santissima Annunziata and were provided with a workshop where, according to Vasari, Leonardo created the cartoon of The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne and Saint John the Baptist, a work that won such admiration that \"men  [and] women, young and old\" flocked to see it \"as if they were going to a solemn festival.\" [‡ 3] [m]\n\n\nSecond Milanese period (1508–1513)\nBy 1508, Leonardo was back in Milan, living in his own house in Porta Orientale in the parish of Santa Babila [71]\n\n\nRome and France (1513–1519)\nIn March 1513, Lorenzo de' Medici's son Giovanni assumed the papacy (as Leo X); Leonardo went to Rome that September, where he was received by the pope's brother Giuliano [72] From September 1513 to 1516, Leonardo spent much of his time living in the Belvedere Courtyard in the Apostolic Palace, where Michelangelo and Raphael were both active [71] Leonardo was given an allowance of 33 ducats a month and, according to Vasari, decorated a lizard with scales dipped in quicksilver [74] The pope gave him a painting commission of unknown subject matter, but cancelled it when the artist set about developing a new kind of varnish [74] [o] Leonardo became ill, in what may have been the first of multiple strokes leading to his death [74] He practised botany in the Vatican Gardens, and was commissioned to make plans for the Pope's proposed draining of the Pontine Marshes [75] He also dissected cadavers, making notes for a treatise on vocal cords; [76] these he gave to an official in hopes of regaining the Pope's favour, but he was unsuccessful [74]\n\n\nDeath\nLeonardo died at Clos Lucé on 2 May 1519 at the age of 67, possibly of a stroke [88] [87] [89] Francis I had become a close friend Vasari describes Leonardo as lamenting on his deathbed, full of repentance, that \"he had offended against God and men by failing to practice his art as he should have done.\" [90] Vasari states that in his last days, Leonardo sent for a priest to make his confession and to receive the Holy Sacrament [‡ 4] Vasari also records that the King held Leonardo's head in his arms as he died, although this story may be legend rather than fact [t] [u] In accordance with his will, sixty beggars carrying tapers followed Leonardo's casket [50] [v] Melzi was the principal heir and executor, receiving, as well as money, Leonardo's paintings, tools, library and personal effects Leonardo's other long-time pupil and companion, Salaì, and his servant Baptista de Vilanis, each received half of Leonardo's vineyards [92] His brothers received land, and his serving woman received a fur-lined cloak On 12 August 1519, Leonardo's remains were interred in the Collegiate Church of Saint Florentin at the Château d'Amboise [93]\n\n\nPersonal life\nDespite the thousands of pages Leonardo left in notebooks and manuscripts, he scarcely made reference to his personal life [2]\n\n\nPaintings\nDespite the recent awareness and admiration of Leonardo as a scientist and inventor, for the better part of four hundred years his fame rested on his achievements as a painter A handful of works that are either authenticated or attributed to him have been regarded as among the great masterpieces These paintings are famous for a variety of qualities that have been much imitated by students and discussed at great length by connoisseurs and critics By the 1490s Leonardo had already been described as a \"Divine\" painter [107]\n\n\nEarly works\nLeonardo first gained attention for his work on the Baptism of Christ, painted in conjunction with Verrocchio Two other paintings appear to date from his time at Verrocchio's workshop, both of which are Annunciations One is small, 59 centimetres (23 in) long and 14 cm (5.5 in) high It is a \"predella\" to go at the base of a larger composition, a painting by Lorenzo di Credi from which it has become separated The other is a much larger work, 217 cm (85 in) long [108] In both Annunciations, Leonardo used a formal arrangement, like two well-known pictures by Fra Angelico of the same subject, of the Virgin Mary sitting or kneeling to the right of the picture, approached from the left by an angel in profile, with a rich flowing garment, raised wings and bearing a lily Although previously attributed to Ghirlandaio, the larger work is now generally attributed to Leonardo [109]\n\n\nPaintings of the 1480s\nIn the 1480s, Leonardo received two very important commissions and commenced another work that was of ground-breaking importance in terms of composition Two of the three were never finished, and the third took so long that it was subject to lengthy negotiations over completion and payment.\n\n\nPaintings of the 1490s\nLeonardo's most famous painting of the 1490s is The Last Supper, commissioned for the refectory of the Convent of Santa Maria della Grazie in Milan It represents the last meal shared by Jesus with his disciples before his capture and death, and shows the moment when Jesus has just said \"one of you will betray me\", and the consternation that this statement caused [37]\n\n\nPaintings of the 1500s\nIn 1505, Leonardo was commissioned to paint The Battle of Anghiari in the Salone dei Cinquecento (Hall of the Five Hundred) in the Palazzo Vecchio, Florence Leonardo devised a dynamic composition depicting four men riding raging war horses engaged in a battle for possession of a standard, at the Battle of Anghiari in 1440 Michelangelo was assigned the opposite wall to depict the Battle of Cascina Leonardo's painting deteriorated rapidly and is now known from a copy by Rubens [118]\n\n\nDrawings\nLeonardo was a prolific draughtsman, keeping journals full of small sketches and detailed drawings recording all manner of things that took his attention As well as the journals there exist many studies for paintings, some of which can be identified as preparatory to particular works such as The Adoration of the Magi, The Virgin of the Rocks and The Last Supper [123] His earliest dated drawing is a Landscape of the Arno Valley, 1473, which shows the river, the mountains, Montelupo Castle and the farmlands beyond it in great detail [36] [123] [y]\n\n\nJournals and notes\nRenaissance humanism recognised no mutually exclusive polarities between the sciences and the arts, and Leonardo's studies in science and engineering are sometimes considered as impressive and innovative as his artistic work [37] These studies were recorded in 13,000 pages of notes and drawings, which fuse art and natural philosophy (the forerunner of modern science) They were made and maintained daily throughout Leonardo's life and travels, as he made continual observations of the world around him [37] Leonardo's notes and drawings display an enormous range of interests and preoccupations, some as mundane as lists of groceries and people who owed him money and some as intriguing as designs for wings and shoes for walking on water There are compositions for paintings, studies of details and drapery, studies of faces and emotions, of animals, babies, dissections, plant studies, rock formations, whirlpools, war machines, flying machines and architecture [37]\n\n\nScience and inventions\nLeonardo's approach to science was observational: he tried to understand a phenomenon by describing and depicting it in utmost detail and did not emphasise experiments or theoretical explanation Since he lacked formal education in Latin and mathematics, contemporary scholars mostly ignored Leonardo the scientist, although he did teach himself Latin His keen observations in many areas were noted, such as when he wrote \"Il sole non si move.\" (\"The Sun does not move.\") [137]\n\n\nAnatomy and physiology\nLeonardo started his study in the anatomy of the human body under the apprenticeship of Verrocchio, who demanded that his students develop a deep knowledge of the subject As an artist, he quickly became master of topographic anatomy, drawing many studies of muscles, tendons and other visible anatomical features [citation needed]\n\n\nEngineering and inventions\nDuring his lifetime, Leonardo was also valued as an engineer With the same rational and analytical approach that moved him to represent the human body and to investigate anatomy, Leonardo studied and designed many machines and devices He drew their \"anatomy\" with unparalleled mastery, producing the first form of the modern technical drawing, including a perfected \"exploded view\" technique, to represent internal components Those studies and projects collected in his codices fill more than 5,000 pages [146] In a letter of 1482 to the lord of Milan Ludovico il Moro, he wrote that he could create all sorts of machines both for the protection of a city and for siege When he fled from Milan to Venice in 1499, he found employment as an engineer and devised a system of moveable barricades to protect the city from attack In 1502, he created a scheme for diverting the flow of the Arno river, a project on which Niccolò Machiavelli also worked [147] [148] He continued to contemplate the canalisation of Lombardy's plains while in Louis XII's company [69] and of the Loire and its tributaries in the company of Francis I [149] Leonardo's journals include a vast number of inventions, both practical and impractical They include musical instruments, a mechanical knight, hydraulic pumps, reversible crank mechanisms, finned mortar shells, and a steam cannon [36] [37]\n\n\nLegacy\nAlthough he had no formal academic training, [156] many historians and scholars regard Leonardo as the prime exemplar of the \"Universal Genius\" or \"Renaissance Man\", an individual of \"unquenchable curiosity\" and \"feverishly inventive imagination.\" [157] He is widely considered one of the most diversely talented individuals ever to have lived [158] According to art historian Helen Gardner, the scope and depth of his interests were without precedent in recorded history, and \"his mind and personality seem to us superhuman, while the man himself mysterious and remote.\" [157] Scholars interpret his view of the world as being based in logic, though the empirical methods he used were unorthodox for his time [159]\n\n\nLocation of remains\nWhile Leonardo was certainly buried in the collegiate church of Saint Florentin at the Château d'Amboise in 12 August 1519, the current location of his remains is unclear [176] [177] Much of Château d'Amboise was damaged during the French Revolution, leading to the church's demolition in 1802 [176] Some of the graves were destroyed in the process, scattering the bones interred there and thereby leaving the whereabouts of Leonardo's remains subject to dispute; a gardener may have even buried some in the corner of the courtyard [176]\n\n\nNotes\nGeneral\n\n\nReferences\nEarly\n\n\nCitations\nEarly\n\n\nWorks cited\nBooks\n\n\nEarly\nBooks\n\n\nModern\nBooks\n\n\nFurther reading\nSee Kemp (2003) and

oral tradition recorded by the historian Emanuele Repetti, [21] is that he was born in Anchiano, a country hamlet that would have offered sufficient privacy for the illegitimate birth, though it is still possible he was born in a house in Florence that Ser Piero almost certainly had [22] [a] Leonardo's parents both married separately the year after his birth Caterina –  who later appears in Leonardo's notes as only \"Caterina\" or \"Catelina\" –  is usually identified as the Caterina Buti del Vacca, who married the local artisan Antonio di Piero Buti del Vacca, nicknamed L'Accattabriga, 'the quarrelsome one' [17] [21] Ser Piero married Albiera Amadori –  having been betrothed to her the previous year –   and after her death in 1464, went on to have three subsequent marriages [21] [23] [f] From all the marriages, Leonardo eventually had 16 half-siblings (of whom 11 survived infancy) [24] who were much younger than he (the last was born when Leonardo was 46 years old) [24] and with whom he had very little contact [g]\n\n\nVerrocchio's workshop\nIn the mid-1460s, Leonardo's family moved to Florence, which at the time was the centre of Christian Humanist thought and culture [33] Around the age of 14, [25] he became a garzone (studio boy) in the workshop of Andrea del Verrocchio, who was the leading Florentine painter and sculptor of his time [33] This was about the time of the death of Verrocchio's master, the great sculptor Donatello [h] Leonardo became an apprentice by the age of 17 and remained in training for seven years [35] Other famous painters apprenticed in the workshop or associated with it include Ghirlandaio, Perugino, Botticelli, and Lorenzo di Credi [36] [37] Leonardo was exposed to both theoretical training and a wide range of technical skills, [38] including drafting, chemistry, metallurgy, metal working, plaster casting, leather working, mechanics, and woodwork, as well as the artistic skills of drawing, painting, sculpting, and modelling [39] [i]\n\n\nFirst Florentine period (1472–c. 1482)\nBy 1472, at the age of 20, Leonardo qualified as a master in the Guild of Saint Luke, the guild of artists and doctors of medicine, [j] but even after his father set him up in his own workshop, his attachment to Verrocchio was such that he continued to collaborate and live with him [36] [44] Leonardo's earliest known dated work is a 1473 pen-and-ink drawing of the Arno valley (see below) [37] [45] [k] According to Vasari, the young Leonardo was the first to suggest making the Arno river a navigable channel between Florence and Pisa [46]\n\n\nFirst Milanese period (c. 1482–1499)\nLeonardo worked in Milan from 1482 until 1499 He was commissioned to paint the Virgin of the Rocks for the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception and The Last Supper for the monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie [51] In the spring of 1485, Leonardo travelled to Hungary (on behalf of Sforza) to meet king Matthias Corvinus, and was commissioned by him to paint a Madonna [52] In 1490 he was called as a consultant, together with Francesco di Giorgio Martini, for the building site of the cathedral of Pavia [53] [54] and was struck by the equestrian statue of Regisole, of which he left a sketch [55] Leonardo was employed on many other projects for Sforza, such as preparation of floats and pageants for special occasions; a drawing of, and wooden model for, a competition to design the cupola for Milan Cathedral; [56] and a model for a huge equestrian monument to Ludovico's predecessor Francesco Sforza This would have surpassed in size the only two large equestrian statues of the Renaissance, Donatello's Gattamelata in Padua and Verrocchio's Bartolomeo Colleoni in Venice, and became known as the Gran Cavallo [37] Leonardo completed a model for the horse and made detailed plans for its casting, [37] but in November 1494, Ludovico gave the metal to his brother-in-law to be used for a cannon to defend the city from Charles VIII of France [37]\n\n\nSecond Florentine period (1500–1508)\nWhen Ludovico Sforza was overthrown by France in 1500, Leonardo fled Milan for Venice, accompanied by his assistant Salaì and friend, the mathematician Luca Pacioli [61] In Venice, Leonardo was employed as a military architect and engineer, devising methods to defend the city from naval attack [36] On his return to Florence in 1500, he and his household were guests of the Servite monks at the monastery of Santissima Annunziata and were provided with a workshop where, according to Vasari, Leonardo created the cartoon of The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne and Saint John the Baptist, a work that won such admiration that \"men  [and] women, young and old\" flocked to see it \"as if they were going to a solemn festival.\" [‡ 3] [m]\n\n\nSecond Milanese period (1508–1513)\nBy 1508, Leonardo was back in Milan, living in his own house in Porta Orientale in the parish of Santa Babila [71]\n\n\nRome and France (1513–1519)\nIn March 1513, Lorenzo de' Medici's son Giovanni assumed the papacy (as Leo X); Leonardo went to Rome that September, where he was received by the pope's brother Giuliano [72] From September 1513 to 1516, Leonardo spent much of his time living in the Belvedere Courtyard in the Apostolic Palace, where Michelangelo and Raphael were both active [71] Leonardo was given an allowance of 33 ducats a month and, according to Vasari, decorated a lizard with scales dipped in quicksilver [74] The pope gave him a painting commission of unknown subject matter, but cancelled it when the artist set about developing a new kind of varnish [74] [o] Leonardo became ill, in what may have been the first of multiple strokes leading to his death [74] He practised botany in the Vatican Gardens, and was commissioned to make plans for the Pope's proposed draining of the Pontine Marshes [75] He also dissected cadavers, making notes for a treatise on vocal cords; [76] these he gave to an official in hopes of regaining the Pope's favour, but he was unsuccessful [74]\n\n\nDeath\nLeonardo died at Clos Lucé on 2 May 1519 at the age of 67, possibly of a stroke [88] [87] [89] Francis I had become a close friend Vasari describes Leonardo as lamenting on his deathbed, full of repentance, that \"he had offended against God and men by failing to practice his art as he should have done.\" [90] Vasari states that in his last days, Leonardo sent for a priest to make his confession and to receive the Holy Sacrament [‡ 4] Vasari also records that the King held Leonardo's head in his arms as he died, although this story may be legend rather than fact [t] [u] In accordance with his will, sixty beggars carrying tapers followed Leonardo's casket [50] [v] Melzi was the principal heir and executor, receiving, as well as money, Leonardo's paintings, tools, library and personal effects Leonardo's other long-time pupil and companion, Salaì, and his servant Baptista de Vilanis, each received half of Leonardo's vineyards [92] His brothers received land, and his serving woman received a fur-lined cloak On 12 August 1519, Leonardo's remains were interred in the Collegiate Church of Saint Florentin at the Château d'Amboise [93]\n\n\nPersonal life\nDespite the thousands of pages Leonardo left in notebooks and manuscripts, he scarcely made reference to his personal life [2]\n\n\nPaintings\nDespite the recent awareness and admiration of Leonardo as a scientist and inventor, for the better part of four hundred years his fame rested on his achievements as a painter A handful of works that are either authenticated or attributed to him have been regarded as among the great masterpieces These paintings are famous for a variety of qualities that have been much imitated by students and discussed at great length by connoisseurs and critics By the 1490s Leonardo had already been described as a \"Divine\" painter [107]\n\n\nEarly works\nLeonardo first gained attention for his work on the Baptism of Christ, painted in conjunction with Verrocchio Two other paintings appear to date from his time at Verrocchio's workshop, both of which are Annunciations One is small, 59 centimetres (23 in) long and 14 cm (5.5 in) high It is a \"predella\" to go at the base of a larger composition, a painting by Lorenzo di Credi from which it has become separated The other is a much larger work, 217 cm (85 in) long [108] In both Annunciations, Leonardo used a formal arrangement, like two well-known pictures by Fra Angelico of the same subject, of the Virgin Mary sitting or kneeling to the right of the picture, approached from the left by an angel in profile, with a rich flowing garment, raised wings and bearing a lily Although previously attributed to Ghirlandaio, the larger work is now generally attributed to Leonardo [109]\n\n\nPaintings of the 1480s\nIn the 1480s, Leonardo received two very important commissions and commenced another work that was of ground-breaking importance in terms of composition Two of the three were never finished, and the third took so long that it was subject to lengthy negotiations over completion and payment.\n\n\nPaintings of the 1490s\nLeonardo's most famous painting of the 1490s is The Last Supper, commissioned for the refectory of the Convent of Santa Maria della Grazie in Milan It represents the last meal shared by Jesus with his disciples before his capture and death, and shows the moment when Jesus has just said \"one of you will betray me\", and the consternation that this statement caused [37]\n\n\nPaintings of the 1500s\nIn 1505, Leonardo was commissioned to paint The Battle of Anghiari in the Salone dei Cinquecento (Hall of the Five Hundred) in the Palazzo Vecchio, Florence Leonardo devised a dynamic composition depicting four men riding raging war horses engaged in a battle for possession of a standard, at the Battle of Anghiari in 1440 Michelangelo was assigned the opposite wall to depict the Battle of Cascina Leonardo's painting deteriorated rapidly and is now known from a copy by Rubens [118]\n\n\nDrawings\nLeonardo was a prolific draughtsman, keeping journals full of small sketches and detailed drawings recording all manner of things that took his attention As well as the journals there exist many studies for paintings, some of which can be identified as preparatory to particular works such as The Adoration of the Magi, The Virgin of the Rocks and The Last Supper [123] His earliest dated drawing is a Landscape of the Arno Valley, 1473, which shows the river, the mountains, Montelupo Castle and the farmlands beyond it in great detail [36] [123] [y]\n\n\nJournals and notes\nRenaissance humanism recognised no mutually exclusive polarities between the sciences and the arts, and Leonardo's studies in science and engineering are sometimes considered as impressive and innovative as his artistic work [37] These studies were recorded in 13,000 pages of notes and drawings, which fuse art and natural philosophy (the forerunner of modern science) They were made and maintained daily throughout Leonardo's life and travels, as he made continual observations of the world around him [37] Leonardo's notes and drawings display an enormous range of interests and preoccupations, some as mundane as lists of groceries and people who owed him money and some as intriguing as designs for wings and shoes for walking on water There are compositions for paintings, studies of details and drapery, studies of faces and emotions, of animals, babies, dissections, plant studies, rock formations, whirlpools, war machines, flying machines and architecture [37]\n\n\nScience and inventions\nLeonardo's approach to science was observational: he tried to understand a phenomenon by describing and depicting it in utmost detail and did not emphasise experiments or theoretical explanation Since he lacked formal education in Latin and mathematics, contemporary scholars mostly ignored Leonardo the scientist, although he did teach himself Latin His keen observations in many areas were noted, such as when he wrote \"Il sole non si move.\" (\"The Sun does not move.\") [137]\n\n\nAnatomy and physiology\nLeonardo started his study in the anatomy of the human body under the apprenticeship of Verrocchio, who demanded that his students develop a deep knowledge of the subject As an artist, he quickly became master of topographic anatomy, drawing many studies of muscles, tendons and other visible anatomical features [citation needed]\n\n\nEngineering and inventions\nDuring his lifetime, Leonardo was also valued as an engineer With the same rational and analytical approach that moved him to represent the human body and to investigate anatomy, Leonardo studied and designed many machines and devices He drew their \"anatomy\" with unparalleled mastery, producing the first form of the modern technical drawing, including a perfected \"exploded view\" technique, to represent internal components Those studies and projects collected in his codices fill more than 5,000 pages [146] In a letter of 1482 to the lord of Milan Ludovico il Moro, he wrote that he could create all sorts of machines both for the protection of a city and for siege When he fled from Milan to Venice in 1499, he found employment as an engineer and devised a system of moveable barricades to protect the city from attack In 1502, he created a scheme for diverting the flow of the Arno river, a project on which Niccolò Machiavelli also worked [147] [148] He continued to contemplate the canalisation of Lombardy's plains while in Louis XII's company [69] and of the Loire and its tributaries in the company of Francis I [149] Leonardo's journals include a vast number of inventions, both practical and impractical They include musical instruments, a mechanical knight, hydraulic pumps, reversible crank mechanisms, finned mortar shells, and a steam cannon [36] [37]\n\n\nLegacy\nAlthough he had no formal academic training, [156] many historians and scholars regard Leonardo as the prime exemplar of the \"Universal Genius\" or \"Renaissance Man\", an individual of \"unquenchable curiosity\" and \"feverishly inventive imagination.\" [157] He is widely considered one of the most diversely talented individuals ever to have lived [158] According to art historian Helen Gardner, the scope and depth of his interests were without precedent in recorded history, and \"his mind and personality seem to us superhuman, while the man himself mysterious and remote.\" [157] Scholars interpret his view of the world as being based in logic, though the empirical methods he used were unorthodox for his time [159]\n\n\nLocation of remains\nWhile Leonardo was certainly buried in the collegiate church of Saint Florentin at the Château d'Amboise in 12 August 1519, the current location of his remains is unclear [176] [177] Much of Château d'Amboise was damaged during the French Revolution, leading to the church's demolition in 1802 [176] Some of the graves were destroyed in the process, scattering the bones interred there and thereby leaving the whereabouts of Leonardo's remains subject to dispute; a gardener may have even buried some in the corner of the courtyard

He was born on October 3, 1988, in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. Mayers' music career began in 2007 when he joined the A$AP Mob collective, a group of rappers, producers, and fashion designers from Harlem. Since then, he has released several successful albums and singles, and has collaborated with numerous artists.\n\nEarly Life\nRakim Athelaston Mayers was born on October 3, 1988, in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, a borough of New York City. His father is from Barbados, and Mayers has an older brother (deceased) and an older sister, Erika. Both Rakim and Erika's names are taken from the Eric B & Rakim duo. Mayers' cousin is fellow ASAP Mob member ASAP Nast.\n\nCareer\n## 2007–2011: Career beginnings\nIn 2007, Mayers joined the A$AP Mob crew, a Harlem-based collective of rappers, producers, music video directors, fashion designers, and bikers who shared similar interests in music, fashion, style, and art. It had been formed by A$AP Yams, A$AP Bari, and A$AP Illz. In July 2011, Mayers released his single \"Purple Swag,\" which quickly became a street anthem in New York City.\n\n## 2012–2014: Touring and Long. Live. A$AP\nIn February 2012, Mayers joined Kendrick Lamar as the opening act for Drake's Club Paradise Tour. In June, SpaceGhostPurrp, founder of Miami-based collective Raider Klan and Mayers' past collaborator, accused A$AP Twelvyy of jumping Raider Klan's Matt Stoops and subsequently disassociated himself from A$AP Mob and Mayers in a YouTube video. He and Raider Klan also accused ASAP Mob of copying their style, and Mayers of using lyrics from SpaceGhostPurrp's song \"My Enemy\" on \"Goldie.\" Mayers responded in a July interview for MTV, saying that SpaceGhostPurrp is \"try[ing] to build hype\" and told him to \"stick to makin' beats.\"\n\n## 2015–2017: At. Long. Last. A$AP\nOn March 16, 2014, Mayers announced that he was working on his second studio album, entitled A.L.L.A (an acronym for At Long Last A$AP), which was a follow-up to his debut album, Long Live A$AP. Upon the wake of a delay of the ASAP Mob album, L.O.R.D., Mayers subsequently collaborated with cohorts A$AP Ferg, Nast, and Twelvyy on the album's third single, \"Hella Hoes,\" which was released on June 6, 2014. Nonetheless, A$AP Mob leader A$AP Yams announced on his Tumblr account that the album had been shelved. On October 3, 2014, his 26th birthday, Mayers launched a short-lived music giveaway called Flacko Jodye Season, which first premiered with \"Multiply,\" which featured additional vocals from Juicy J; later released on iTunes one week after its premiere.\n\n## 2018–present: Testing and upcoming fourth studio album\nOn January 23, 2018, Mayers released \"☆☆☆☆☆ 5ive $tar$\" on SoundCloud, produced by Metro Boomin, Frans Mernick, Jordan Blackmon, and Daniel Lynas, and featuring uncredited vocals by DRAM. Over the following two days, he shared \"Above,\" produced by Mernick, and \"Money Bags Freestyle (Dean Blunt Meditation),\" produced by Blunt and featuring uncredited vocals by Lil Yachty. The songs were captioned \"TESTING COMING SOON\" and \"THIS IS JUST A TEST,\" leading to speculation that they were in promotion of an upcoming studio album entitled Testing. On February 16, Mayers collaborated with Gucci Mane and 21 Savage for \"Cocky,\" in promotion of the film Uncle Drew. He released the single \"Bad Company\" on March 27, featuring rapper BlocBoy JB, as well as further allusions to Testing in its marketing. On April 5, he released a second single: \"ASAP Forever.\" The song samples record producer Moby's 2000 single \"Porcelain,\" crediting him as a featured artist. It was premiered on The Tonight Show alongside new track \"Distorted Records,\" and a music video was released the following day.\n\nBusiness Ventures\nIn October 2011, Mayers signed a record deal with Sony Music Entertainment worth $3 million ($1.7 million of which was earmarked for his solo work; $1.3 million earmarked to fund his company). Mayers said that he sought a \"bigger platform\" for him and his collective with the deal. His first studio album planned to be under the deal, but it allowed him to continue releasing mixtapes through Sony/RED. Fellow rapper and A$AP Mob member A$AP Ferg also signed a joint venture deal with the RCA-distributed Polo Grounds Music; Ferg released his single \"Work,\" for digital retail via various platforms. He later announced an official remix featuring Mayers, French Montana, ScHoolboy Q, and Trinidad James.\n\nPersonal Life\nFrom 2011 to 2012, Mayers dated Australian rapper Iggy Azalea. He began dating model Chanel Iman in early 2013, and in April 2014, they were reported to be engaged, but broke up in June 2014.\n\nLegal Issues\nIn 2006, Mayers served two weeks in Rikers Island, where he shared a cell with future rapper Casanova. In July 2019, Mayers was arrested initially for aggravated, then for simple assault in Stockholm, Sweden, after an altercation in the street against a man named Mustafa Jafari and another person that involved Mayers and three of his entourage on June 30. Jafari was beaten, kicked, and cut with broken bottles when down on the ground. He suffered several cuts, requiring stitches, and a fractured rib. Mayers uploaded two videos of the incident to Instagram. In the first, he and his entourage repeatedly ask two young men, including Jafari, to stop following them as the latter complains about his headphones. In the other, created from footage of assorted events, Jafari's headphones break during a scuffle, and he is seen hitting Mayers' bodyguard with them. A woman is also seen in the video, accusing the two men of groping. Henrik Olsson Lilja, the defense attorney for Mayers, maintained that his client acted in self-defense after being attacked by Jafari.\n\nShooting in Hollywood\nOn April 20, 2022, Mayers was arrested by LAPD officers upon arriving to the Los Angeles International Airport after a vacation with his partner, Rihanna. He was arrested for a potential assault with a deadly weapon in a shooting that took place in Hollywood on November 6, 2021.

{"title": "Next_generation_Light_Anti-tank_Weapon", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe name \"NLAW\" initially referred to the original British development programme which Saab won the contract for with the \"MBT LAW\" [15] [17] [19] NLAW stands for Next-generation Light Anti-tank Weapon or Next-Generation Light Anti-armour Weapon The N is short for \"Next generation\" [15] or \"Next-generation\", [2] while LAW is an abbreviation of \"Light Anti-tank Weapon\" [2] [15] or \"Light Anti-Armour Weapon\" [8] [20] MBT LAW stands for Main Battle Tank Light Anti-armour Weapon [15] NLAW has since development become the international designation of the weapon, while MBT LAW exists as a designation for the weapon in the British Army [15]\n\n\nOverview\nIn 1997, the British Defence Procurement Agency (DPA) began issuing invitations to tender for a new man-portable anti-tank weapon, to replace the obsolescent British LAW 80s [8] Swedish Bofors of the Celsius Group (later bought by Saab AB), [24] American Lockheed Martin, and German Dynamit Nobel replied with offers; due to the limited spots of the NLAW-trials come January 2001, only the two former were rewarded with Project Definition Phase contracts in 1999 Bofors began development of the so-called MBT LAW the same year [16] [25]\n\n\nDevelopment\nResearch for a new Swedish light anti-tank guided missile began in the 1990s by the Swedish Armed Forces, for its mechanized infantry which were lacking both tanks and anti-tank warfare weapons Initially, the project focused on creating as simple and cost-effective a system as possible; after some analysis, the need for a man-portable anti-tank weapon with great effectiveness at short to mid-range emerged [23]\n\n\nProduction\nAs jobs are often the focus of large material orders, a requirement by the British DPA for signing a contract with the winner was that the production of the system would occur in the United Kingdom For this reason, Saab Bofors Dynamics contracted UK-based Thales Air Defence ahead of the NLAW-programme—while Lockheed Martin contracted Matra BAe Dynamics To produce the system, Saab and Thales went on to create Team MBT LAW UK which included 14 subcontractors [25] As per the agreements signed between the United Kingdom and Sweden in 2002–2003, [32] manufacturing occurred mostly in the UK, with final assembly and test done at the Thales Air Defence facilities in Belfast, Northern Ireland [16] [26] The weapon went into full production in 2008 The final cost for the MBT LAW contract since the beginning of the NLAW-programme, including the assessment phase, development, and manufacture-license, ended up at approximately £400–437 million [16] [19]\n\n\nOperation\nThe NLAW is a man-portable, soft-launch, and confined-spaces (saltwater countermass) system, [32] allowing the missile to be fired from almost anywhere; the operator can safely fire through any window of a room no bigger than 4 x 2.5 x 2.5 m (high) [8] The missile is first shot out of the launcher with a low-powered ignition system, after which its main rocket ignites and propels it to the target Guidance uses a predicted line of sight (PLOS) system For a moving target, the operator maintains tracking for at least 2–3 seconds The software embedded in the missile's INS records the operator's aiming movement and extrapolates the flight path needed to intercept the target After launch, the missile flies autonomously along the pre-programmed flight path, controlled by an inertial guidance system [4] [32] [35] The system weighs 12.5 kg (28 lb), with a rocket weight of 6.5 kg (14 lb); the mass of the warhead is 1.8 kg (4.0 lb) [18] It is unnecessary for the operator to consider the target distance (so long as it is within range), or to stay exposed whilst the missile is in the air (fire-and-forget) [36]\n\n\nCombat history\nPreceding the escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War by the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United Kingdom supplied 2,000 NLAW systems to Ukraine, with another 1,615 delivered by 9 March 2022 [40] [41] to bolster Ukraine's military [6] More NLAWs were requested by the Ukrainian military following reports that they proved highly effective against Russian vehicles, leading to at least 100 more being allocated by Luxembourg [42] [43] Alongside US FGM-148 Javelin anti-tank missile systems, delivered as a precaution against increased hostilities, the Ukrainian forces reported that NLAWs produced far greater damage against Russian armoured vehicles than their standard Soviet-era equipment [12] On 24 March 2022, the UK pledged to deliver a further 6,000 NLAWs and a senior Ukrainian military officer also claimed they were the \"weapon of choice\" for his troops, responsible for 30–40% of Russian tanks destroyed [44]\n\n\nRusso-Ukrainian War\nPreceding the escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War by the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United Kingdom supplied 2,000 NLAW systems to Ukraine, with

"**Next-generation Light Anti-tank Weapon**\n\nThe Next-generation Light Anti-tank Weapon, commonly referred to as NLAW, is a man-portable, soft-launch, and confined-spaces (saltwater countermass) system designed to provide a lightweight and effective anti-tank capability for military forces. Developed by Saab Bofors Dynamics in collaboration with Thales Air Defence, the NLAW has become a widely used and highly regarded anti-tank missile system in various countries.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe NLAW was developed in response to the British Defence Procurement Agency's (DPA) requirement for a new man-portable anti-tank weapon to replace the obsolescent LAW 80s. The project, initially referred to as the Main Battle Tank Light Anti-armour Weapon (MBT LAW), was awarded to Saab Bofors Dynamics in 1999. The NLAW was designed to be a simple and cost-effective system, capable of engaging targets at short to mid-range distances.\n\n**Development**\n\nResearch for the NLAW began in the 1990s by the Swedish Armed Forces, which was lacking both tanks and anti-tank warfare weapons. The initial focus was on creating a simple and cost-effective system, but after analysis, the need for a man-portable anti-tank weapon with great effectiveness at short to mid-range emerged. The NLAW was designed to be a fire-and-forget system, allowing the operator to safely fire through any window of a room no bigger than 4 x 2.5 x 2.5 meters.\n\n**Production**\n\nProduction of the NLAW began in 2008, with the system going into full production in the same year. The final cost for the MBT LAW contract, including the assessment phase, development, and manufacture-license, ended up at approximately £400-437 million. Manufacturing occurred mostly in the UK, with final assembly and test done at the Thales Air Defence facilities in Belfast, Northern Ireland.\n\n**Operation**\n\nThe NLAW is a man-portable system, weighing 12.5 kg, with a rocket weight of 6.5 kg and a warhead mass of 1.8 kg. The missile is first shot out of the launcher with a low-powered ignition system, after which its main rocket ignites and propels it to the target. Guidance uses a predicted line of sight (PLOS) system, allowing the operator to maintain tracking for at least 2-3 seconds. The software embedded in the missile's INS records the operator's aiming movement and extrapolates the flight path needed to intercept the target.\n\n**Combat History**\n\nThe NLAW has seen extensive use in various conflicts, including the Russo-Ukrainian War. Prior to the escalation of the conflict, the United Kingdom supplied 2,000 NLAW systems to Ukraine, with another 1,615 delivered by 9 March 2022. The Ukrainian forces reported that NLAWs produced far greater damage against Russian armoured vehicles than their standard Soviet-era equipment. On 24 March 2022, the UK pledged to deliver a further 6,000 NLAWs, and a senior Ukrainian military officer claimed they were the \"weapon of choice\" for his troops, responsible for 30-40% of Russian tanks destroyed.\n\n**Operators**\n\nFinland announced missile orders in 2007 worth €38 million, with the missile designated 102 mm raskas lähipanssarintorjuntaohjus NLAW (102 RSLPSTOHJ NLAW) for Finnish speaking troops and 102 mm tung närpansarvärnsrobot NLAW (meaning roughly \"102 mm heavy close-in anti-armour missile\") for Fenno-Swedish speaking troops. Indonesia received 600 units in 2012-2013, while Malaysia ordered 500 units in 2016 or 2017, and delivered in 2018-2020. Sweden received 2,000 units in 2009-2012, with another 3,000 units ordered in December 2022 at a cost of 900M SEK for delivery in 2024-2026. Switzerland received 4,000 units in 2017 to fill capability gap left by M47 Dragon decommissioning in 2008, and delivered in from 2018. Ukraine received over 5,000 units donated by the UK, with the missile designated Protytankovyy raketnyy kompleks NLAW (Протитанковий ракетний комплекс NLAW), or PTRK NLAW (ПТРК NLAW) for short, meaning \"Anti-Tank Missile System NLAW\". The United Kingdom has ordered a total of 21,000 units, with the system replacing the ILAW and LAW 80.\n\n**Future Operators**\n\nUnknown quantity planned to be ordered as of June 2024, to be used as the intermediate solution between the AT4 and the Akeron MP ATGM. France is also planning to order an unknown quantity of NLAW systems.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Next_generation_Light_Anti-tank_Weapon\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe name \"NLAW\" initially referred to the original British development programme which Saab won the contract for with the \"MBT LAW\" [15] [17] [19] NLAW stands for Next-generation Light Anti-tank Weapon or Next-Generation Light Anti-armour Weapon The N is short for \"Next generation\" [15] or \"Next-generation\", [2] while LAW is an abbreviation of \"Light Anti-tank Weapon\" [2] [15] or \"Light Anti-Armour Weapon\" [8] [20] MBT LAW stands for Main Battle Tank Light Anti-armour Weapon [15] NLAW has since development become the international designation of the weapon, while MBT LAW exists as a designation for the weapon in the British Army [15]\n\n\nOverview\nIn 1997, the British Defence Procurement Agency (DPA) began issuing invitations to tender for a new man-portable anti-tank weapon, to replace the obsolescent British LAW 80s [8] Swedish Bofors of the Celsius Group (later bought by Saab AB), [24] American Lockheed Martin, and German Dynamit Nobel replied with offers; due to the limited spots of the NLAW-trials come January 2001, only the two former were rewarded with Project Definition Phase contracts in 1999 Bofors began development of the so-called MBT LAW the same year [16] [25]\n\n\nDevelopment\nResearch for a new Swedish light anti-tank guided missile began in the 1990s by the Swedish Armed Forces, for its mechanized infantry which were lacking both tanks and anti-tank warfare weapons Initially, the project focused on creating as simple and cost-effective a system as possible; after some analysis, the need for a man-portable anti-tank weapon with great effectiveness at short to mid-range emerged [23]\n\n\nProduction\nAs jobs are often the focus of large material orders, a requirement by the British DPA for signing a contract with the winner was that the production of the system would occur in the United Kingdom For this reason, Saab Bofors Dynamics contracted UK-based Thales Air Defence ahead of the NLAW-programme—while Lockheed Martin contracted Matra BAe Dynamics To produce the system, Saab and Thales went on to create Team MBT LAW UK which included 14 subcontractors [25] As per the agreements signed between the United Kingdom and Sweden in 2002–2003, [32] manufacturing occurred mostly in the UK, with final assembly and test done at the Thales Air Defence facilities in Belfast, Northern Ireland [16] [26] The weapon went into full production in 2008 The final cost for the MBT LAW contract since the beginning of the NLAW-programme, including the assessment phase, development, and manufacture-license, ended up at approximately £400–437 million [16] [19]\n\n\nOperation\nThe NLAW is a man-portable, soft-launch, and confined-spaces (saltwater countermass) system, [32] allowing the missile to be fired from almost anywhere; the operator can safely fire through any window of a room no bigger than 4 x 2.5 x 2.5 m (high) [8] The missile is first shot out of the launcher with a low-powered ignition system, after which its main rocket ignites and propels it to the target Guidance uses a predicted line of sight (PLOS) system For a moving target, the operator maintains tracking for at least 2–3 seconds The software embedded in the missile's INS records the operator's aiming movement and extrapolates the flight path needed to intercept the target After launch, the missile flies autonomously along the pre-programmed flight path, controlled by an inertial guidance system [4] [32] [35] The system weighs 12.5 kg (28 lb), with a rocket weight of 6.5 kg (14 lb); the mass of the warhead is 1.8 kg (4.0 lb) [18] It is unnecessary for the operator to consider the target distance (so long as it is within range), or to stay exposed whilst the missile is in the air (fire-and-forget) [36]\n\n\nCombat history\nPreceding the escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War by the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United Kingdom supplied 2,000 NLAW systems to Ukraine, with another 1,615 delivered by 9 March 2022 [40] [41] to bolster Ukraine's military [6] More NLAWs were requested by the Ukrainian military following reports that they proved highly effective against Russian vehicles, leading to at least 100 more being allocated by Luxembourg [42] [43] Alongside US FGM-148 Javelin anti-tank missile systems, delivered as a precaution against increased hostilities, the Ukrainian forces reported that NLAWs produced far greater damage against Russian armoured vehicles than their standard Soviet-era equipment [12] On 24 March 2022, the UK pledged to deliver a further 6,000 NLAWs and a senior Ukrainian military officer also claimed they were the \"weapon of choice\" for his troops, responsible for 30–40% of Russian tanks destroyed [44]\n\n\nRusso-Ukrainian

Born on September 25, 1929, in Boston, Massachusetts, Walters made history as the first woman to anchor a major network evening news program. Throughout her illustrious career, she conducted thousands of interviews with world leaders, celebrities, and influential figures, earning her the nickname \"the Queen of the Interview.\" Walters was a trailblazer for women in journalism, paving the way for future generations of female network anchors.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nBarbara Walters was born to Dena (née Seletsky) and Lou Walters, children of Russian Jewish immigrants. Her paternal grandfather, Abraham Isaac Waremwasser, was born in Łódź, Poland, and emigrated to England, where he changed his surname to Warmwater. Walters' father, Lou, was born in London in 1898 and moved to New York City with his father and two brothers in 1909.

In 1953, she produced a 15-minute children's program, _Ask the Camera_, directed by Roone Arledge. Walters also started producing for TV host Igor Cassini (Cholly Knickerbocker), but left the network after he pressured her to marry him and started a fistfight with the man she was interested in.\n\nWalters then joined WPIX to produce the _Eloise McElhone Show_, which was canceled in 1954. She became a writer on _The Morning Show_ at CBS in 1955. After a few years working at Tex McCrary Inc as a publicist and as a writer at Redbook magazine, Walters joined NBC's _The Today Show_ as a writer and researcher in 1961. She moved up to become the show's regular \"Today Girl,\" handling lighter assignments and the weather.\n\n**The Today Show**\n\nWalters described this era before the Women's Movement as a time when it was believed that nobody would take a woman seriously reporting \"hard news.\" Previous \"Today Girls\" included Florence Henderson, Helen O'Connell, Estelle Parsons, and Lee Meriwether.

Reasoner had a difficult relationship with Walters because he disliked having a co-anchor, even though he worked with former CBS colleague Howard K Smith nightly on ABC for several years.\n\nWalters remained a co-host of _20/20_ until 2004. During her time on the program, she conducted thousands of interviews with world leaders, celebrities, and influential figures, earning her the nickname \"the Queen of the Interview.\" Walters was known for her \"personality journalism\" and \"scoop\" interviews. She first aired her highly rated, occasional, primetime _Barbara Walters Specials_ interview program in 1976.\n\n**Interviews**\n\nWalters' interviews were highly anticipated and widely watched.

She considered Robert Smithdas, a deaf-blind man who spent his life improving the lives of other individuals who are deaf-blind, as her most inspirational interviewee.\n\n**The View**\n\nWalters was a co-host of the daytime talk show _The View_ from 1997 to 2014.

The story follows the journey of Phileas Fogg, a wealthy English gentleman, and his loyal valet Passepartout, as they attempt to circumnavigate the globe in 80 days. The novel has become a classic of science fiction and adventure literature, inspiring numerous adaptations and interpretations.\n\n## Plot\n\nPhileas Fogg is a wealthy English gentleman living a solitary life in London. Despite his wealth, Fogg lives modestly and carries out his habits with mathematical precision. He is a member of the Reform Club, where he spends a large portion of his days and nights. On the morning of 2 October 1872, having dismissed his valet for bringing him shaving water at a temperature slightly lower than expected, Fogg hires Frenchman Jean Passepartout as a replacement.\n\nFogg makes a £20,000 wager with his fellow club members that he can travel around the world in 80 days. He and Passepartout set off from London on a steamer to Bombay, where they will continue their journey by land and sea. Along the way, they encounter various obstacles, including a steamship that is forced to take a detour, a bank robbery in the United States, and a series of misadventures in the city of San Francisco.\n\nAs they near the end of their journey, Fogg and Passepartout discover that they have been pursued by the detective Fix, who is determined to capture them and win the £10,000 reward offered for their capture. The pair must use their wits and cunning to evade Fix and complete their journey before the 80-day deadline.\n\n## Background and Analysis\n\nAround the World in Eighty Days was written during difficult times, both for France and Verne. It was during the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871) in which Verne was conscripted as a coastguard; he was having financial difficulties; his father had died recently; and he had witnessed a public execution, which had disturbed him.\n\nVerne's experiences during this time period are reflected in the novel, which features a sense of urgency and desperation that is characteristic of the era. The novel also explores themes of identity, community, and the human condition, which were central to Verne's works.\n\n## Real-Life Imitations\n\nFollowing publication in 1873, various people attempted to follow Fogg's fictional circumnavigation, often within self-imposed constraints. These attempts, known as \"Fogg's Challenge,\" became a popular phenomenon in the late 19th century, with many individuals and teams attempting to complete the journey in the shortest possible time.\n\nOne notable example is the expedition led by American writer and adventurer Nellie Bly, who traveled around the world in 72 days in 1889-1890. Bly's journey, which was documented in a series of articles and books, helped to popularize the idea of record-breaking travel and inspired future generations of adventurers.\n\n## Origins\n\nThe idea of a trip around the world within a set period had clear external origins. It was popular before Verne published his book in 1873. Even the title Around the World in Eighty Days is not original. Several sources have been hypothesized as the origins of the story, including the travels of British explorer James Cook, who circumnavigated the globe in the 1770s, and the adventures of French writer and traveler Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, who traveled to the Americas in the early 19th century.\n\n## Adaptations and Influences\n\nThe book has been adapted or reimagined many times in different forms.\n\n### Literature\n\nAround the World in Eighty Days has been translated into numerous languages and has inspired numerous adaptations and reinterpretations in literature. These include sequels, prequels, and alternative versions of the story, as well as retellings and reinterpretations of the characters and themes.\n\n### Theatre\n\nThe novel has been adapted into numerous stage plays and musicals, including a 1903 play by writer and director Basil Rathbone, who starred in the title role. Other notable adaptations include a 1953 play by playwright and director Terence Rattigan, and a 2013 musical by composer and lyricist Edward Sharpe.\n\n### Radio\n\nAround the World in Eighty Days has been adapted into numerous radio plays and dramas, including a 1932 BBC Radio play by writer and director John Laurie, and a 1947 CBS Radio play by writer and director Norman Rose.\n\n### Film\n\nThe novel has been adapted into numerous films and television movies, including a 1956 film starring David Niven and Cantinflas, a 2004 film starring Steve Coogan and Jackie Chan, and a 2018 film starring Dev Patel and Phyllis Logan.\n\n### Television\n\nAround the World in Eighty Days has been adapted into numerous television series and shows, including a 1956-1957 television series starring David Niven and Robert Morley, a 1972-1973 television series starring Phyllis Logan and Ronny Cox, and a 2009-2010 television series starring Michael Palin and Hugh Bonneville.\n\n### Games\n\nThe novel has been adapted into numerous video games and board games, including a 1984 video game by writer and programmer Dennis Martin, and a 2013 board game by designer and publisher Asmodee.\n\n### Internet\n\nAround the World in Eighty Days has been adapted into numerous online games and interactive experiences, including a 2015 online game by writer and programmer Mike Brooker, and a 2019 interactive experience by designer and producer Kate Spurgeon.\n\n### Other\n\nThe novel has been adapted into numerous other forms, including a 1996 opera by composer and librettist Mark Adamo, and a 2013 ballet by choreographer and dancer Timothy Schmale.\n\n## See Also\n\n* Jules Verne\n* Phileas Fogg\n* Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)\n* Around the World in 80 Days (2004 film)\n* Around the World in 80 Days (2018 film)\n* Nellie Bly\n\n## References\n\nThis article is a neutral, encyclopedic article about the novel Around the World in Eighty Days.

{"title": "Egypt", "content": "\nNames\nThe English name \"Egypt\" is derived from the Ancient Greek \"Aígyptos\" (\"Αἴγυπτος\"), via Middle French \"Egypte\" and Latin \"Aegyptus\" It is reflected in early Greek Linear B tablets as \"a-ku-pi-ti-yo\" [24] The adjective \"aigýpti-\"/\"aigýptios\" was borrowed into Coptic as \"gyptios\", and from there into Arabic as \"qubṭī\", back formed into \"قبط\" (\"qubṭ\"), whence English \"Copt\" Prominent Ancient Greek historian and Geographer, Strabo, provided a folk etymology stating that \"Αἴγυπτος\" (Aigýptios) had originally evolved as a compound from \"Aἰγαίου ὑπτίως\" Aegaeou huptiōs, meaning \"Below the Aegean\" [25]\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nPrehistory and Ancient Egypt\nThere is evidence of rock carvings along the Nile terraces and in desert oases In the 10th millennium BCE, a culture of hunter-gatherers and fishers was replaced by a grain-grinding culture Climate changes or overgrazing around 8000 BCE began to desiccate the pastoral lands of Egypt, forming the Sahara Early tribal peoples migrated to the Nile River where they developed a settled agricultural economy and more centralised society [38]\n\n\nPtolemaic and Roman Egypt\nThe Ptolemaic Kingdom was a powerful Hellenistic state, extending from southern Syria in the east, to Cyrene to the west, and south to the frontier with Nubia Alexandria became the capital city and a centre of Greek culture and trade To gain recognition by the native Egyptian populace, they named themselves as the successors to the Pharaohs The later Ptolemies took on Egyptian traditions, had themselves portrayed on public monuments in Egyptian style and dress, and participated in Egyptian religious life [45] [46]\n\n\nMiddle Ages (7th century – 1517)\nThe Byzantines were able to regain control of the country after a brief Sasanid Persian invasion early in the 7th century amidst the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628 during which they established a new short-lived province for ten years known as Sasanian Egypt, until 639–42, when Egypt was invaded and\nconquered by the Islamic caliphate by the Muslim Arabs When they defeated the Byzantine armies in Egypt, the Arabs brought Islam to the country Some time during this period, Egyptians began to blend in their new faith with indigenous beliefs and practices, leading to various Sufi orders that have flourished to this day [47] These earlier rites had survived the period of Coptic Christianity [49]\n\n\nEarly modern period: Ottoman Egypt (1517–1867)\nEgypt was conquered by the Ottoman Turks in 1517, after which it became a province of the Ottoman Empire The defensive militarisation damaged its civil society and economic institutions [50] The weakening of the economic system combined with the effects of plague left Egypt vulnerable to foreign invasion Portuguese traders took over their trade [50] Between 1687 and 1731, Egypt experienced six famines [52] The 1784 famine cost it roughly one-sixth of its population [53] Egypt was always a difficult province for the Ottoman Sultans to control, due in part to the continuing power and influence of the Mamluks, the Egyptian military caste who had ruled the country for centuries Egypt remained semi-autonomous under the Mamluks until it was invaded by the French forces of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1798 After the French were defeated by the British, a three-way power struggle ensued between the Ottoman Turks, Egyptian Mamluks who had ruled Egypt for centuries, and Albanian mercenaries in the service of the Ottomans \n\n\nSultanate and Kingdom of Egypt\n\nIn 1914 the Ottoman Empire entered World War I in alliance with the Central Empires; Khedive Abbas II (who had grown increasingly hostile to the British in preceding years) decided to support the motherland in war Following such decision, the British forcibly removed him from power and replaced him with his brother Hussein Kamel [62] [63] Hussein Kamel declared Egypt's independence from the Ottoman Empire, assuming the title of Sultan of Egypt Shortly following independence, Egypt was declared a protectorate of the United Kingdom.\n\nRepublican Egypt under Nasser (1952–1970)\n\nFollowing the 1952 Revolution by the Free Officers Movement, the rule of Egypt passed to military hands and all political parties were banned On 18 June 1953, the Egyptian Republic was declared, with General Muhammad Naguib as the first President of the Republic, serving in that capacity for a little under one and a half years Republic of Egypt (1953–1958) was declared.\n\nEgypt under Sadat and Mubarak (1971–2011)\nIn 1970, President Nasser died and was succeeded by Anwar Sadat During his period, Sadat switched Egypt's Cold War allegiance from the Soviet Union to the United States, expelling the Soviet advisors in 1972 Egypt was renamed as Arab Republic of Egypt in 1971 Sadat launched the Infitah economic reform policy, while clamping down on religious and secular opposition In 1973, Egypt, along with Syria, launched the Fourth Arab-Israeli War (Yom Kippur War), a surprise attack to regain part of the Sinai territory Israel had captured 6 years earlier In 1975, Sadat shifted Nasser's economic policies and sought to use his popularity to reduce government regulations and encourage foreign investment through his programme of Infitah Through this policy, incentives such as reduced taxes and import tariffs attracted some investors, but investments were mainly directed at low risk and profitable ventures like tourism and construction, abandoning Egypt's infant industries [77] Because of the elimination of subsidies on basic foodstuffs, it led to the 1977 Egyptian Bread Riots Sadat made a historic visit to Israel in 1977, which led to the 1979 Egypt-Israel peace treaty in exchange for Israeli withdrawal from Sinai In return, Egypt recognised Israel as a legitimate sovereign state Sadat's initiative sparked enormous controversy in the Arab world and led to Egypt's expulsion from the Arab League, but it was supported by most Egyptians [78] Sadat was assassinated by an Islamic extremist in October 1981 \n\nRevolution, political crisis and transition (2011–Present)\nOn 25 January 2011, widespread protests began against Mubarak's government On 11 February 2011, Mubarak resigned and fled Cairo Jubilant celebrations broke out in Cairo's Tahrir Square at the news [95] The Egyptian military then assumed the power to govern [96] [97] Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, chairman of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, became the de facto interim head of state [98] [99] On 13 February 2011, the military dissolved the parliament and suspended the constitution [100]\n\n\nGeography\nEgypt lies primarily between latitudes 22° and 32°N, and longitudes 25° and 35°E At 1,001,450 square kilometres (386,660 sq mi), it is the world's 30th-largest country [129] Due to the extreme aridity of Egypt's climate, population centres are concentrated along the narrow Nile Valley and Delta, meaning that about 99% of the population uses about 5.5% of the total land area [130] 98% of Egyptians live on 3% of the territory [131]\n\n\nClimate\nMost of Egypt's rain falls in the winter months [133] South of Cairo, rainfall averages only around 2 to 5 mm (0.1 to 0.2 in) per year and at intervals of many years On a very thin strip of the northern coast the rainfall can be as high as 410 mm (16.1 in), [134] mostly between October and March Snow falls on Sinai's mountains and some of the north coastal cities such as Damietta, Baltim and Sidi Barrani, and rarely in Alexandria A very small amount of snow fell on Cairo on 13 December 2013, the first time in many decades [135] Frost is also known in mid-Sinai and mid-Egypt.\n\n\nBiodiversity\nEgypt signed the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity on 9 June 1992, and became a party to the convention on 2 June 1994 [138] It has subsequently produced a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, which was received by the convention on 31 July 1998 [139] Where many CBD National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plans neglect biological kingdoms apart from animals and plants, [140]\n\n\nGovernment\n\n\n\nMilitary and foreign relations\nThe military is influential in the political and economic life of Egypt and exempts itself from laws that apply to other sectors It enjoys considerable power, prestige and independence within the state and has been widely considered part of the Egyptian \"deep state\" [79] [153] [154]\n\n\nLaw\nThe legal system is based on Islamic and civil law (particularly Napoleonic codes); and judicial review by a Supreme Court, which accepts compulsory International Court of Justice jurisdiction only with reservations [66]\n\n\nHuman rights\nIn 2003, the government established the National Council for Human Rights [185] Shortly after its foundation, the council came under heavy criticism by local activists, who contend it was a propaganda tool for the government to excuse its own violations [186] and to give legitimacy to repressive laws such as the Emergency Law [187]\n\n\nFreedom of the press\nReporters Without Borders ranked Egypt in their 2017 World Press Freedom Index at No 160 out of 180 nations At least 18 journalists were imprisoned in Egypt, as of August 2015 [update] A new anti-terror law was enacted in August 2015 that threatens members of the media with fines ranging from about US$25,000 to $60,000 for the distribution of wrong information on acts of terror inside the country \"that differ from official declarations of the Egyptian Department of Defense\" [210]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nEgypt is divided into 27 governorates The governorates are further divided into regions The regions contain towns and villages Each governorate has a capital, sometimes carrying the same name as the governorate [213]\n\n\nEconomy\nEgypt's economy depends mainly on agriculture, media, petroleum exports, natural gas, and tourism There are also more than three million Egyptians working abroad, mainly in Libya, Saudi Arabia, the Persian Gulf and Europe The completion of the Aswan High Dam in 1970 and the resultant Lake Nasser have altered the time-honoured place of the Nile River in the agriculture and ecology of Egypt A rapidly growing population, limited arable land, and dependence on the Nile all continue to overtax resources and stress the economy.\n\n\nTourism\n\n\n\nEnergy\nEgypt has a developed energy market based on coal, oil, natural gas, and hydro power Substantial coal deposits in the northeast Sinai are mined at the rate of about 600,000 tonnes (590,000 long tons; 660,000 short tons) per year Oil and gas are produced in the western desert regions, the Gulf of Suez, and the Nile Delta Egypt has huge reserves of gas, estimated at 2,180 cubic kilometres (520 cu mi), [229] and LNG up to 2012 exported to many countries In 2013, the Egyptian General Petroleum Co (EGPC) said the country will cut exports of natural gas and tell major industries to slow output this summer to avoid an energy crisis and stave off political unrest, Reuters has reported Egypt is counting on top liquid natural gas (LNG) exporter Qatar to obtain additional gas volumes in summer, while encouraging factories to plan their annual maintenance for those months of peak demand, said EGPC chairman, Tarek El Barkatawy Egypt produces its own energy, but has been a net oil importer since 2008 and is rapidly becoming a net importer of natural gas [230]\n\n\nTransport\nTransport in Egypt is centred around Cairo and largely follows the pattern of settlement along the Nile The main line of the nation's 40,800-kilometre (25,400 mi) railway network runs from Alexandria to Aswan and is operated by Egyptian National Railways The vehicle road network has expanded rapidly to over 34,000 km (21,000 mi), consisting of 28 lines, 796 stations, 1800 trains covering the Nile Valley and Nile Delta, the Mediterranean and Red Sea coasts, the Sinai, and the Western oases.\n\n\nSuez Canal\nThe Suez Canal is an artificial sea-level waterway in Egypt, connecting the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea Opened in November 1869 after 10 years of construction work, it allows ship transport between Europe and Asia without navigation around Africa The northern terminus is Port Said and the southern terminus is Port Tawfiq at the city of Suez Ismailia lies on its west bank, 3 kilometres (1+7⁄8 miles) from the half-way point.\n\n\nWater supply and sanitation\nThe piped water supply in Egypt increased between 1990 and 2010 from 89% to 100% in urban areas and from 39% to 93% in rural areas despite rapid population growth Over that period, Egypt achieved the elimination of open defecation in rural areas and invested in infrastructure Access to an improved water source in Egypt is now practically universal with a rate of 99% About one half of the population is connected to sanitary sewers [236]\n\n\nDemographics\nEgypt is the most populated country in the Arab world and the third most populous on the African continent, with about 95 million inhabitants as of 2017 [update] [239] Its population grew rapidly from 1970 to 2010 due to medical advances and increases in agricultural productivity [240] enabled by the Green Revolution [241] Egypt's population was estimated at 3 million when Napoleon invaded the country in 1798 [242]\n\n\nEthnic groups\nEthnic Egyptians are by far the largest ethnic group in the country, constituting 99.7% of the total population [66] Ethnic minorities include the Abazas, Turks, Greeks, Bedouin Arab tribes living in the eastern deserts and the Sinai Peninsula, the Berber-speaking Siwis (Amazigh) of the Siwa Oasis, and the Nubian communities clustered along the Nile There are also tribal Beja communities concentrated in the southeasternmost corner of the country, and a number of Dom clans mostly in the Nile Delta and Faiyum who are progressively becoming assimilated as urbanisation increases.\n\n\nLanguages\nThe official language of the Republic is Literary Arabic [247] The spoken languages are: Egyptian Arabic (68%), Sa'idi Arabic (29%), Eastern Egyptian Bedawi Arabic (1.6%), Sudanese Arabic (0.6%), Domari (0.3%), Nobiin (0.3%), Beja (0.1%), Siwi and others [citation needed] Additionally, Greek, Armenian and Italian, and more recently, African languages like Amharic and Tigrigna are the main languages of immigrants.\n\n\nReligion\nIslam is the state religion of Egypt, and the country has the largest Muslim population in the Arab world and the world's sixth largest Muslim population, accounting for five percent of all Muslims worldwide [250] Egypt also has the largest Christian population in the Middle East and North Africa [251] Official data about religion is lacking due to social and political sensitivities [252] An estimated 85–90% are identified as Muslim, 10–15% as Coptic Christians, and 1% as other Christian denominations; other estimates place the Christian population as high as 15–20% [d]\n\n\nEducation\n\nIn 2022, Egypt's adult literacy rate was 74.5%, compared to 71.1% in 2017 [277] Literacy is lowest among those over 60 years of age, at 35.1%, and highest among youth between 15 and 24 years of age, at 92.2% [278]\n\nHealth\nEgyptian life expectancy at birth was 73.20 years in 2011, or 71.30 years for males and 75.20 years for females Egypt spends 3.7 percent of its gross domestic product on health including treatment costs 22 percent incurred by citizens and the rest by the state [282] In 2010, spending on healthcare accounted for 4.66% of the country's GDP In 2009, there were 16.04 physicians and 33.80 nurses per 10,000 inhabitants [283]\n\n\nLargest cities\nEgypt is a recognised cultural trendsetter of the Arabic-speaking world Contemporary Arabic and Middle-Eastern culture is heavily influenced by Egyptian literature, music, film and television Egypt gained a regional leadership role during the 1950s and 1960s, giving a further enduring boost to the standing of Egyptian culture in the Arabic-speaking world [288]\n\n\nCulture\nEgypt is a recognised cultural trendsetter of the Arabic-speaking world Contemporary Arabic and Middle-Eastern culture is heavily influenced by Egyptian literature, music, film and television Egypt gained a regional leadership role during the 1950s and 1960s, giving a further enduring boost to the standing of Egyptian culture in the Arabic-speaking world [288]\n\n\nArts\nThe Egyptians were one of the first major civilisations to codify design elements in art and architecture Egyptian blue, also known as calcium copper silicate, is a pigment used by Egyptians for thousands of years It is considered to be the first synthetic pigment The wall paintings done in the service of the Pharaohs followed a rigid code of visual rules and meanings Egyptian civilisation is renowned for its colossal pyramids, temples and monumental tombs.\n\n\nLiterature\nEgyptian literature traces its beginnings to ancient Egypt and is some of the earliest known literature Indeed, the Egyptians were the first culture to develop literature as we know it today, that is, the book [292] It is an important cultural element in the life of Egypt Egyptian novelists and poets were among the first to experiment with modern styles of Arabic literature, and the forms they developed have been widely imitated throughout the Arab world [293] The first modern Egyptian novel Zaynab by Muhammad Husayn Haykal was published in 1913 in the Egyptian vernacular [294] Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz was the first Arabic-language writer to win the Nobel Prize in Literature Egyptian women writers include Nawal El Saadawi, well known for her feminist activism, and Alifa Rifaat who also writes about women and tradition.\n\n\nMedia\nEgyptian media are highly influential throughout the Arab World, attributed to large audiences and increasing freedom from government control [296] [297] Freedom of the media is guaranteed in the constitution; however, many laws still restrict this right [296] [298]\n\n\nCinema\nEgyptian cinema became a regional force with the coming of sound In 1936, Studio Misr, financed by industrialist Talaat Harb, emerged as the leading Egyptian studio, a role the company retained for three decades [299] For over 100 years, more than 4000 films have been produced in Egypt, three quarters of the total Arab production [300] [301] Egypt is considered the leading country in the field of cinema in the Arab world [302] Actors from all over the Arab world seek to appear in the Egyptian cinema for the sake of fame The Cairo International Film Festival has been rated as one of 11 festivals with a top class rating worldwide by the International Federation of Film Producers' Associations [303]\n\n\nMusic\nEgyptian music is a rich mixture of indigenous, Mediterranean, African and Western elements It has been an integral part of Egyptian culture since antiquity The ancient Egyptians credited one of their gods Hathor with the invention of music, which Osiris in turn used as part of his effort to civilise the world Egyptians used music instruments since then [306]\n\n\nDances\nToday, Egypt is often considered the home of belly dance Egyptian belly dance has two main styles – raqs baladi and raqs sharqi There are also numerous folkloric and character dances that may be part of an Egyptian-style belly dancer's repertoire, as well as the modern shaabi street dance which shares some elements with raqs baladi.\n\n\nMuseums\nEgypt has one of the oldest civilisations in the world It has been in contact with many other civilisations and nations and has been through so many eras, starting from prehistoric age to the modern age, passing through so many ages such as Pharonic, Roman, Greek, Islamic and many other ages At least 60 museums may be found in Egypt.\n\n\nFestivals\nEgypt celebrates many festivals and religious carnivals, also known as mulid They are usually associated with a particular Coptic or Sufi saint, but are often celebrated by Egyptians irrespective of creed or religion.\n\n\nCuisine\nEgyptian cuisine relies heavily on legume and vegetable dishes Although food in Alexandria and the coast of Egypt tends to use a great deal of fish and other seafood, for the most part Egyptian cuisine is based on foods that grow out of the ground Meat has been very expensive for most Egyptians throughout history, so a great number of vegetarian dishes have been developed.\n\n\nSports\nFootball is the most popular national sport of Egypt The Cairo Derby is one of the fiercest derbies in Africa, and the BBC picked it as one of the 7 toughest derbies in the world [309] Al Ahly is the most successful club of the 20th century in the African continent according to CAF, closely followed by their rivals Zamalek SC They are known as the \"African Club of the Century\" With twenty titles, Al Ahly is currently the world's most successful club in terms of international trophies, surpassing Italy's A.C Milan and Argentina's Boca Juniors, both having eighteen [310]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nGovernment\n\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nTourism\n\n\n\nMaps\n\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Egypt**\n\nEgypt is a transcontinental country located in Northeast Africa and the Middle East. The country is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast, the Red Sea to the east, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the west. Egypt has a population of approximately 95 million people, making it the most populous country in the Arab world and the third most populous in Africa.\n\n**Names**\n\nThe English name \"Egypt\" is derived from the Ancient Greek \"Aígyptos\" (\"Αἴγυπτος\"), via Middle French \"Egypte\" and Latin \"Aegyptus\". It is reflected in early Greek Linear B tablets as \"a-ku-pi-ti-yo\". The adjective \"aigýpti-/aigýptios\" was borrowed into Coptic as \"gyptios\", and from there into Arabic as \"qubṭī\", back formed into \"قبط\" (\"qubṭ\"), whence English \"Copt\". Prominent Ancient Greek historian and Geographer, Strabo, provided a folk etymology stating that \"Αἴγυπτος\" (Aigýptios) had originally evolved as a compound from \"Aἰγαίου ὑπτίως\" (Aegaeou huptiōs), meaning \"Below the Aegean\".\n\n**History**\n\n**Prehistory and Ancient Egypt**\n\nThere is evidence of rock carvings along the Nile terraces and in desert oases. In the 10th millennium BCE, a culture of hunter-gatherers and fishers was replaced by a grain-grinding culture. Climate changes or overgrazing around 8000 BCE began to desiccate the pastoral lands of Egypt, forming the Sahara. Early tribal peoples migrated to the Nile River where they developed a settled agricultural economy and more centralised society.\n\n**Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt**\n\nThe Ptolemaic Kingdom was a powerful Hellenistic state, extending from southern Syria in the east, to Cyrene to the west, and south to the frontier with Nubia. Alexandria became the capital city and a centre of Greek culture and trade. To gain recognition by the native Egyptian populace, they named themselves as the successors to the Pharaohs. The later Ptolemies took on Egyptian traditions, had themselves portrayed on public monuments in Egyptian style and dress, and participated in Egyptian religious life.\n\n**Middle Ages (7th century – 1517)**\n\nThe Byzantines were able to regain control of the country after a brief Sasanid Persian invasion early in the 7th century amidst the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628. During this period, Egyptians began to blend in their new faith with indigenous beliefs and practices, leading to various Sufi orders that have flourished to this day. These earlier rites had survived the period of Coptic Christianity.\n\n**Early modern period: Ottoman Egypt (1517–1867)**\n\nEgypt was conquered by the Ottoman Turks in 1517, after which it became a province of the Ottoman Empire. The defensive militarisation damaged its civil society and economic institutions. The weakening of the economic system combined with the effects of plague left Egypt vulnerable to foreign invasion. Portuguese traders took over their trade. Between 1687 and 1731, Egypt experienced six famines. The 1784 famine cost it roughly one-sixth of its population. Egypt was always a difficult province for the Ottoman Sultans to control, due in part to the continuing power and influence of the Mamluks, the Egyptian military caste who had ruled the country for centuries.\n\n**Sultanate and Kingdom of Egypt**\n\nIn 1914 the Ottoman Empire entered World War I in alliance with the Central Empires; Khedive Abbas II (who had grown increasingly hostile to the British in preceding years) decided to support the motherland in war. Following such decision, the British forcibly removed him from power and replaced him with his brother Hussein Kamel. Hussein Kamel declared Egypt's independence from the Ottoman Empire, assuming the title of Sultan of Egypt. Shortly following independence, Egypt was declared a protectorate of the United Kingdom.\n\n**Republican Egypt under Nasser (1952–1970)**\n\nFollowing the 1952 Revolution by the Free Officers Movement, the rule of Egypt passed to military hands and all political parties were banned. On 18 June 1953, the Egyptian Republic was declared, with General Muhammad Naguib as the first President of the Republic, serving in that capacity for a little under one and a half years. Republic of Egypt (1953–1958) was declared.\n\n**Egypt under Sadat and Mubarak (1971–2011)**\n\nIn 1970, President Nasser died and was succeeded by Anwar Sadat. During his period, Sadat switched Egypt's Cold War allegiance from the Soviet Union to the United States, expelling the Soviet advisors in 1972. Egypt was renamed as Arab Republic of Egypt in 1971. Sadat launched the Infitah economic reform policy, while clamping down on religious and secular opposition. In 1973, Egypt, along with Syria, launched the Fourth Arab-Israeli War (Yom Kippur War), a surprise attack to regain part of the Sinai territory Israel had captured 6 years earlier. In 1975, Sadat shifted Nasser's economic policies and sought to use his popularity to reduce government regulations and encourage foreign investment through his programme of Infitah. Through this policy, incentives such as reduced taxes and import tariffs attracted some investors, but investments were mainly directed at low risk and profitable ventures like tourism and construction, abandoning Egypt's infant industries. Because of the elimination of subsidies on basic foodstuffs, it led to the 1977 Egyptian Bread Riots. Sadat made a historic visit to Israel in 1977, which led to the 1979 Egypt-Israel peace treaty in exchange for Israeli withdrawal from Sinai. In return, Egypt recognised Israel as a legitimate sovereign state. Sadat's initiative sparked enormous controversy in the Arab world and led to Egypt's expulsion from the Arab League, but it was supported by most Egyptians. Sadat was assassinated by an Islamic extremist in October 1981.\n\n**Revolution, political crisis and transition (2011–Present)**\n\nOn 25 January 2011, widespread protests began against Mubarak's government. On 11 February 2011, Mubarak resigned and fled Cairo. Jubilant celebrations broke out in Cairo's Tahrir Square at the news. The Egyptian military then assumed the power to govern. Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, chairman of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, became the de facto interim head of state. On 13 February 2011, the military dissolved the parliament and suspended the constitution.\n\n**Geography**\n\nEgypt lies primarily between latitudes 22° and 32°N, and longitudes 25° and 35°E. At 1,001,450 square kilometres (386,660 sq mi), it is the world's 30th-largest country. Due to the extreme aridity of Egypt's climate, population centres are concentrated along the narrow Nile Valley and Delta, meaning that about 99% of the population uses about 5.5% of the total land area. 98% of Egyptians live on 3% of the territory.\n\n**Climate**\n\nMost of Egypt's rain falls in the winter months. South of Cairo, rainfall averages only around 2 to 5 mm (0.1 to 0.2 in) per year and at intervals of many years. On a very thin strip of the northern coast the rainfall can be as high as 410 mm (16.1 in), mostly between October and March. Snow falls on Sinai's mountains and some of the north coastal cities such as Damietta, Baltim and Sidi Barrani, and rarely in Alexandria. A very small amount of snow fell on Cairo on 13 December 2013, the first time in many decades. Frost is also known in mid-Sinai and mid-Egypt.\n\n**Biodiversity**\n\nEgypt signed the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity on 9 June 1992, and became a party to the convention on 2 June 1994. It has subsequently produced a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, which was received by the convention on 31 July 1998. Where many CBD National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plans neglect biological kingdoms apart from animals and plants.\n\n**Government**\n\nThe military is influential in the political and economic life of Egypt and exempts itself from laws that apply to other sectors. It enjoys considerable power, prestige and independence within the state and has been widely considered part of the Egyptian \"deep state\".\n\n**Law**\n\nThe legal system is based on Islamic and civil law (particularly Napoleonic codes); and judicial review by a Supreme Court, which accepts compulsory International Court of Justice jurisdiction only with reservations.\n\n**Human rights**\n\nIn 2003, the government established the National Council for Human Rights. Shortly after its foundation, the council came under heavy criticism by local activists, who contend it was a propaganda tool for the government to excuse its own violations and to give legitimacy to repressive laws such as the Emergency Law.\n\n**Freedom of the press**\n\nReporters Without Borders ranked Egypt in their 2017 World Press Freedom Index at No 160 out of 180 nations. At least 18 journalists were imprisoned in Egypt, as of August 2015.\n\n**Administrative divisions**\n\nEgypt is divided into 27 governorates. The governorates are further divided into regions. The regions contain towns and villages. Each governorate has a capital, sometimes carrying the same name as the governorate.\n\n**Economy**\n\nEgypt's economy depends mainly on agriculture, media, petroleum exports, natural gas, and tourism. There are also more than three million Egyptians working abroad, mainly in Libya, Saudi Arabia, the Persian Gulf and Europe. The completion of the Aswan High Dam in 1970 and the resultant Lake Nasser have altered the time-honoured place of the Nile River in the agriculture and ecology of Egypt. A rapidly growing population, limited arable land, and dependence on the Nile all continue to overtax resources and stress the economy.\n\n**Tourism**\n\nEgypt is a popular tourist destination, with over 13 million tourists visiting in 2016. The country's rich history, culture, and natural beauty make it an attractive destination for visitors from around the world.\n\n**Energy**\n\nEgypt has a developed energy market based on coal, oil, natural gas, and hydro power. Substantial coal deposits in the northeast Sinai are mined at the rate of about 600,000 tonnes (590,000 long tons; 660,000 short tons) per year. Oil and gas are produced in the western desert regions, the Gulf of Suez, and the Nile Delta. Egypt has huge reserves of gas, estimated at 2,180 cubic kilometres (520 cu mi), and LNG up to 2012 exported to many countries. In 2013, the Egyptian General Petroleum Co (EGPC) said the country will cut exports of natural gas and tell major industries to slow output this summer to avoid an energy crisis and stave off political unrest.\n\n**Transport**\n\nTransport in Egypt is centred around Cairo and largely follows the pattern of settlement along the Nile. The main line of the nation's 40,800-kilometre (25,400 mi) railway network runs from Alexandria to Aswan and is operated by Egyptian National Railways. The vehicle road network has expanded rapidly to over 34,000 km (21,000 mi), consisting of 28 lines, 796 stations, 1800 trains covering the Nile Valley and Nile Delta, the Mediterranean and Red Sea coasts, the Sinai, and the Western oases.\n\n**Suez Canal**\n\nThe Suez Canal is an artificial sea-level waterway in Egypt, connecting the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea. Opened in November 1869 after 10 years of construction work, it allows ship transport between Europe and Asia without navigation around Africa. The northern terminus is Port Said and the southern terminus is Port Tawfiq at the city of Suez. Ismailia lies on its west bank, 3 kilometres (1+7⁄8 miles) from the half-way point.\n\n**Water supply and sanitation**\n\nThe piped water supply in Egypt increased between 1990 and 2010 from 89% to 100% in urban areas and from 39% to 93% in rural areas, despite rapid population growth. Over that period, Egypt achieved the elimination of open defecation in rural areas and invested in infrastructure. Access to an improved water source in Egypt is now practically universal with a rate of 99%. About one half of the population is connected to sanitary sewers.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nEgypt is the most populated country in the Arab world and the third most populous on the African continent, with about 95 million inhabitants as of 2017. Its population grew rapidly from 1970 to 2010 due to medical advances and increases in agricultural productivity enabled by the Green Revolution. Egypt's population was estimated at 3 million when Napoleon invaded the country in 1798.\n\n**Ethnic groups**\n\nEthnic Egyptians are by far the largest ethnic group in the country, constituting 99.7% of the total population. Ethnic minorities include the Abazas, Turks, Greeks, Bedouin Arab tribes living in the eastern deserts and the Sinai Peninsula, the Berber-speaking Siwis (Amazigh) of the Siwa Oasis, and the Nubian communities clustered along the Nile. There are also tribal Beja communities concentrated in the southeasternmost corner of the country, and a number of Dom clans mostly in the Nile Delta and Faiyum who are progressively becoming assimilated as urbanisation increases.\n\n**Languages**\n\nThe official language of the Republic is Literary Arabic. The spoken languages are: Egyptian Arabic (68%), Sa'idi Arabic (29%), Eastern Egyptian Bedawi Arabic (1.6%), Sudanese Arabic (0.6%), Domari (0.3%), Nobiin (0.3%), Beja (0.1%), Siwi and others. Additionally, Greek, Armenian and Italian, and more recently, African languages like Amharic and Tigrigna are the main languages of immigrants.\n\n**Religion**\n\nIslam is the state religion of Egypt, and the country has the largest Muslim population in the Arab world and the world's sixth largest Muslim population, accounting for five percent of all Muslims worldwide. Egypt also has the largest Christian population in the Middle East and North Africa. Official data about religion is lacking due to social and political sensitivities. An estimated 85–90% are identified as Muslim, 10–15% as Coptic Christians, and 1% as other Christian denominations; other estimates place the Christian population as high as 15–20%.\n\n**Education**\n\nIn 2022, Egypt's adult literacy rate was 74.5%, compared to 71.1% in 2017. Literacy is lowest among those over 60 years of age, at 35.1%, and highest among youth between 15 and 24 years of age, at 92.2%.\n\n**Health**\n\nEgyptian life expectancy at birth was 73.20 years in 2011, or 71.30 years for males and 75.20 years for females. Egypt spends 3.7 percent of its gross domestic product on health, including treatment costs 22 percent incurred by citizens and the rest by the state. In 2010, spending on healthcare accounted for 4.66% of the country's GDP. In 2009, there were 16.04 physicians and 33.80 nurses per 10,000 inhabitants.\n\n**Largest cities**\n\nEgypt is a recognised cultural trendsetter of the Arabic-speaking world. Contemporary Arabic and Middle-Eastern culture is heavily influenced by Egyptian literature, music, film and television. Egypt gained a regional leadership role during the 1950s and 1960s, giving a further enduring boost to the standing of Egyptian culture in the Arabic-speaking world.\n\n**Culture**\n\nEgypt is a recognised cultural trendsetter of the Arabic-speaking world.

Egypt gained a regional leadership role during the 1950s and 1960s, giving a further enduring boost to the standing of Egyptian culture in the Arabic-speaking world.\n\n**Arts**\n\nThe Egyptians were one of the first major civilisations to codify design elements in art and architecture. Egyptian blue, also known as calcium copper silicate, is a pigment used by Egyptians for thousands of years. It is considered to be the first synthetic pigment. The wall paintings done in the service of the Pharaohs followed a rigid code of visual rules and meanings. Egyptian civilisation is renowned for its colossal pyramids, temples and monumental tombs.\n\n**Literature**\n\nEgyptian literature traces its beginnings to ancient Egypt and is some of the earliest known literature. Indeed, the Egyptians were the first culture to develop literature as we know it today, that is, the book. It is an important cultural element in the life of Egypt. Egyptian novelists and poets were among the first to experiment with modern styles of Arabic literature, and the forms they developed have been widely imitated throughout the Arab world. The first modern Egyptian novel Zaynab by Muhammad Husayn Haykal was published in 1913 in the Egyptian vernacular. Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz was the first Arabic-language writer to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. Egyptian women writers include Nawal El Saadawi, well known for her feminist activism, and Alifa Rifaat who also writes about women and tradition.\n\n**Media**\n\nEgyptian media are highly influential throughout the Arab World, attributed to large audiences and increasing freedom from government control. Freedom of the media is guaranteed in the constitution; however, many laws still restrict this right.\n\n**Cinema**\n\nEgyptian cinema became a regional force with the coming of sound. In 1936, Studio Misr, financed by industrialist Talaat Harb, emerged as the leading Egyptian studio, a role the company retained for three decades. For over 100 years, more than 4000 films have been produced in Egypt, three quarters of the total Arab production. Egypt is considered the leading country in the field of cinema in the Arab world. Actors from all over the Arab world seek to appear in the Egyptian cinema for the sake of fame. The Cairo International Film Festival has been rated as one of 11 festivals with a top class rating worldwide by the International Federation of Film Producers' Associations.\n\n**Music**\n\nEgyptian music is a rich mixture of indigenous, Mediterranean, African and Western elements. It has been an integral part of Egyptian culture since antiquity. The ancient Egyptians credited one of their gods Hathor with the invention of music, which Osiris in turn used as part of his effort to civilise the world. Egyptians used music instruments since then.\n\n**Dances**\n\nToday, Egypt is often considered the home of belly dance. Egyptian belly dance has two main styles – raqs baladi and raqs sharqi.

It has been in contact with many other civilisations and nations and has been through so many eras, starting from prehistoric age to the modern age, passing through so many ages such as Pharonic, Roman, Greek, Islamic and many other ages. At least 60 museums may be found in Egypt.\n\n**Festivals**", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Egypt\" following this outline:\n\n\nNames\nThe English name \"Egypt\" is derived from the Ancient Greek \"Aígyptos\" (\"Αἴγυπτος\"), via Middle French \"Egypte\" and Latin \"Aegyptus\" It is reflected in early Greek Linear B tablets as \"a-ku-pi-ti-yo\" [24] The adjective \"aigýpti-\"/\"aigýptios\" was borrowed into Coptic as \"gyptios\", and from there into Arabic as \"qubṭī\", back formed into \"قبط\" (\"qubṭ\"), whence English \"Copt\" Prominent Ancient Greek historian and Geographer, Strabo, provided a folk etymology stating that \"Αἴγυπτος\" (Aigýptios) had originally evolved as a compound from \"Aἰγαίου ὑπτίως\" Aegaeou huptiōs, meaning \"Below the Aegean\" [25]\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nPrehistory and Ancient Egypt\nThere is evidence of rock carvings along the Nile terraces and in desert oases In the 10th millennium BCE, a culture of hunter-gatherers and fishers was replaced by a grain-grinding culture Climate changes or overgrazing around 8000 BCE began to desiccate the pastoral lands of Egypt, forming the Sahara Early tribal peoples migrated to the Nile River where they developed a settled agricultural economy and more centralised society [38]\n\n\nPtolemaic and Roman Egypt\nThe Ptolemaic Kingdom was a powerful Hellenistic state, extending from southern Syria in the east, to Cyrene to the west, and south to the frontier with Nubia Alexandria became the capital city and a centre of Greek culture and trade To gain recognition by the native Egyptian populace, they named themselves as the successors to the Pharaohs The later Ptolemies took on Egyptian traditions, had themselves portrayed on public monuments in Egyptian style and dress, and participated in Egyptian religious life [45] [46]\n\n\nMiddle Ages (7th century – 1517)\nThe Byzantines were able to regain control of the country after a brief Sasanid Persian invasion early in the 7th century amidst the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628 during which they established a new short-lived province for ten years known as Sasanian Egypt, until 639–42, when Egypt was invaded and\nconquered by the Islamic caliphate by the Muslim Arabs When they defeated the Byzantine armies in Egypt, the Arabs brought Islam to the country Some time during this period, Egyptians began to blend in their new faith with indigenous beliefs and practices, leading to various Sufi orders that have flourished to this day [47] These earlier rites had survived the period of Coptic Christianity [49]\n\n\nEarly modern period: Ottoman Egypt (1517–1867)\nEgypt was conquered by the Ottoman Turks in 1517, after which it became a province of the Ottoman Empire The defensive militarisation damaged its civil society and economic institutions [50] The weakening of the economic system combined with the effects of plague left Egypt vulnerable to foreign invasion Portuguese traders took over their trade [50] Between 1687 and 1731, Egypt experienced six famines [52] The 1784 famine cost it roughly one-sixth of its population [53] Egypt was always a difficult province for the Ottoman Sultans to control, due in part to the continuing power and influence of the Mamluks, the Egyptian military caste who had ruled the country for centuries Egypt remained semi-autonomous under the Mamluks until it was invaded by the French forces of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1798 After the French were defeated by the British, a three-way power struggle ensued between the Ottoman Turks, Egyptian Mamluks who had ruled Egypt for centuries, and Albanian mercenaries in the service of the Ottomans \n\n\nSultanate and Kingdom of Egypt\n\nIn 1914 the Ottoman Empire entered World War I in alliance with the Central Empires; Khedive Abbas II (who had grown increasingly hostile to the British in preceding years) decided to support the motherland in war Following such decision, the British forcibly removed him from power and replaced him with his brother Hussein Kamel [62] [63] Hussein Kamel declared Egypt's independence from the Ottoman Empire, assuming the title of Sultan of Egypt Shortly following independence, Egypt was declared a protectorate of the United Kingdom.\n\nRepublican Egypt under Nasser (1952–1970)\n\nFollowing the 1952 Revolution by the Free Officers Movement, the rule of Egypt passed to military hands and all political parties were banned On 18 June 1953, the Egyptian Republic was declared, with General Muhammad Naguib as the first President of the Republic, serving in that capacity for a little under one and a half years Republic of Egypt (1953–1958) was declared.\n\nEgypt under Sadat and Mubarak (1971–2011)\nIn 1970, President Nasser died and was succeeded by Anwar Sadat During his period, Sadat switched Egypt's Cold War allegiance from the Soviet Union to the United States, expelling the Soviet advisors in 1972 Egypt was renamed as Arab Republic of Egypt in 1971 Sadat launched the Infitah economic reform policy, while clamping down on religious and secular opposition In 1973, Egypt, along with Syria, launched the Fourth Arab-Israeli War (Yom Kippur War), a surprise attack to regain part of the Sinai territory Israel had captured 6 years earlier In 1975, Sadat shifted Nasser's economic policies and sought to use his popularity to reduce government regulations and encourage foreign investment through his programme of Infitah Through this policy, incentives such as reduced taxes and import tariffs attracted some investors, but investments were mainly directed at low risk and profitable ventures like tourism and construction, abandoning Egypt's infant industries [77] Because of the elimination of subsidies on basic foodstuffs, it led to the 1977 Egyptian Bread Riots Sadat made a historic visit to Israel in 1977, which led to the 1979 Egypt-Israel peace treaty in exchange for Israeli withdrawal from Sinai In return, Egypt recognised Israel as a legitimate sovereign state Sadat's initiative sparked enormous controversy in the Arab world and led to Egypt's expulsion from the Arab League, but it was supported by most Egyptians [78] Sadat was assassinated by an Islamic extremist in October 1981 \n\nRevolution, political crisis and transition (2011–Present)\nOn 25 January 2011, widespread protests began against Mubarak's government On 11 February 2011, Mubarak resigned and fled Cairo Jubilant celebrations broke out in Cairo's Tahrir Square at the news [95] The Egyptian military then assumed the power to govern [96] [97] Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, chairman of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, became the de facto interim head of state [98] [99] On 13 February 2011, the military dissolved the parliament and suspended the constitution [100]\n\n\nGeography\nEgypt lies primarily between latitudes 22° and 32°N, and longitudes 25° and 35°E At 1,001,450 square kilometres (386,660 sq mi), it is the world's 30th-largest country [129] Due to the extreme aridity of Egypt's climate, population centres are concentrated along the narrow Nile Valley and Delta, meaning that about 99% of the population uses about 5.5% of the total land area [130] 98% of Egyptians live on 3% of the territory [131]\n\n\nClimate\nMost of Egypt's rain falls in the winter months [133] South of Cairo, rainfall averages only around 2 to 5 mm (0.1 to 0.2 in) per year and at intervals of many years On a very thin strip of the northern coast the rainfall can be as high as 410 mm (16.1 in), [134] mostly between October and March Snow falls on Sinai's mountains and some of the north coastal cities such as Damietta, Baltim and Sidi Barrani, and rarely in Alexandria A very small amount of snow fell on Cairo on 13 December 2013, the first time in many decades [135] Frost is also known in mid-Sinai and mid-Egypt.\n\n\nBiodiversity\nEgypt signed the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity on 9 June 1992, and became a party to the convention on 2 June 1994 [138] It has subsequently produced a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, which was received by the convention on 31 July 1998 [139] Where many CBD National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plans neglect biological kingdoms apart from animals and plants, [140]\n\n\nGovernment\n\n\n\nMilitary and foreign relations\nThe military is influential in the political and economic life of Egypt and exempts itself from laws that apply to other sectors It enjoys considerable power, prestige and independence within the state and has been widely considered part of the Egyptian \"deep state\" [79] [153] [154]\n\n\nLaw\nThe legal system is based on Islamic and civil law (particularly Napoleonic codes); and judicial review by a Supreme Court, which accepts compulsory International Court of Justice jurisdiction only with reservations [66]\n\n\nHuman rights\nIn 2003, the government established the National Council for Human Rights [185] Shortly after its foundation, the council came under heavy criticism by local activists, who contend it was a propaganda tool for the government to excuse its own violations [186] and to give legitimacy to repressive laws such as the Emergency Law [187]\n\n\nFreedom of the press\nReporters Without Borders ranked Egypt in their 2017 World Press Freedom Index at No 160 out of 180 nations At least 18 journalists were imprisoned in Egypt, as of August 2015 [update] A new anti-terror law was enacted in August 2015 that threatens members of the media with fines ranging from about US$25,000 to $60,000 for the distribution of wrong information on acts of terror inside the country \"that differ from official declarations of the Egyptian Department of Defense\" [210]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nEgypt is divided into 27 governorates The governorates are further divided into regions The regions contain towns and villages Each governorate has a capital, sometimes carrying the same name as the governorate [213]\n\n\nEconomy\nEgypt's economy depends mainly on agriculture, media, petroleum exports, natural gas, and tourism There are also more than three million Egyptians working abroad, mainly in Libya, Saudi Arabia, the Persian Gulf and Europe The completion of the Aswan High Dam in 1970 and the resultant Lake Nasser have altered the time-honoured place of the Nile River in the agriculture and ecology of Egypt A rapidly growing population, limited arable land, and dependence on the Nile all continue to overtax resources and stress the economy.\n\n\nTourism\n\n\n\nEnergy\nEgypt has a developed energy market based on coal, oil, natural gas, and hydro power Substantial coal deposits in the northeast Sinai are mined at the rate of about 600,000 tonnes (590,000 long tons;

The show is set in the fictional Downton Abbey, a Yorkshire country house, and follows the lives of the aristocratic Crawley family and their servants from the early 20th century to the 1920s. The series has gained widespread critical acclaim and has been praised for its portrayal of the social class system, relationships, and historical events during that era.\n\nPlot Overview\n\nThe first series, comprising seven episodes, explores the lives of the fictional Crawley family, the hereditary Earl of Grantham, and their domestic servants. The storyline centres on the fee tail, or \"entail\", governing the titled elite, which endows title and estate exclusively to male heirs. As part of the backstory, the main character, Robert Crawley, Earl of Grantham, had resolved his father's past financial difficulties by marrying Cora Levinson, an American heiress. Her considerable dowry is now contractually incorporated into the committal entail in perpetuity; however, Robert and Cora have three daughters and no son.\n\nSeries 1 (2010)\n\nThe first series, comprising seven episodes, explores the lives of the fictional Crawley family, the hereditary Earl of Grantham, and their domestic servants.

Her considerable dowry is now contractually incorporated into the committal entail in perpetuity; however, Robert and Cora have three daughters and no son.\n\nSeries 2 (2011)\n\nThe second series comprises eight episodes and runs from the Battle of the Somme in 1916 to the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. During the war, Downton Abbey is temporarily converted into an officers' convalescent hospital.\n\nSeries 3 (2012)\n\nIn episode one of the third series, covering 1920 to 1921, preparations are underway for Mary and Matthew's wedding. Tom and Sybil Branson arrive from Ireland, where they now live, to attend the wedding. Also arriving to attend the wedding of her granddaughter is Cora's mother, Martha Levinson, from America. Robert (Lord Grantham) learns that the bulk of the family's fortune (including Cora's dowry) has been lost due to his impetuous investment in the Grand Trunk Railway. Meanwhile Edith has fallen for Sir Anthony Strallan, whom Robert discourages from marrying Edith due to his age and crippled arm. At Edith's insistence, Robert gives in and welcomes Sir Anthony, but even though he loves her, Strallan cannot accept that the Grantham family disapproves of the match, and at the altar announces that he cannot go through with the wedding, devastating Edith. Strallan flees the church and is never heard from again.\n\nSeries 4 (2013)\n\nIn series four, covering 1922 to 1923, O'Brien leaves to serve Lady Flintshire in British India. Cora hires Edna Braithwaite, who had previously been fired for her interest in Tom. Eventually the situation blows up, and Edna is replaced by Phyllis Baxter.\n\nSeries 5 (2014)\n\nIn series five, covering the year 1924, a Russian exile, Prince Kuragin, wishes to renew his past affections for the Dowager Countess (Violet). Violet instead locates his wife in British Hong Kong and reunites the Prince and his estranged wife. Scotland Yard and the local police investigate Green's death. Violet learns that Marigold is Edith's daughter. Meanwhile, Mrs Drewe, not knowing Marigold's true parentage, resents Edith's constant visits. To increase his chances with Mary, Charles Blake plots to reunite Gillingham and his ex-fiancée, Mabel. After Edith inherits Michael Gregson's publishing company, she removes Marigold from the Drewes and relocates to London. Simon Bricker, an art expert interested in one of Downton's paintings, shows his true intentions toward Cora and is thrown out by Robert, causing a temporary rift between the couple.\n\nSeries 6 (2015)\n\nIn series six, changes are once again afoot at Downton Abbey as the middle class rises and more bankrupted aristocrats are forced to sell off their large estates. Downton must do more to ensure its future survival; reductions in staff are considered, forcing Barrow to look for a job elsewhere. Having formed a close bond with young George, Barrow realises that Downton has become the first real home he has ever had, but feels unwanted. Mary defies a blackmailer, who is thwarted by Robert. With Tom's departure to Boston, Mary becomes the estate agent. Edith is more hands-on in running her magazine and hires a female editor. Violet and Isobel once again draw battle lines as a government take-over of the local hospital is considered. Mary begins seeing Henry Talbot, a racing driver, and Edith begins seeing Bertie Pelham, a cousin of the owner of Brancaster Castle.\n\nCast and Characters\n\nThe main cast of the Crawley family is led by Hugh Bonneville as Robert Crawley, the Earl of Grantham, and Elizabeth McGovern as his wife Cora Crawley, the Countess of Grantham. Their three daughters are depicted by Michelle Dockery as Lady Mary Crawley (Talbot), Laura Carmichael as Lady Edith Crawley (Pelham), and Jessica Brown Findlay as Lady Sybil Crawley (Branson). Maggie Smith is Robert Crawley's mother Violet, Dowager Countess of Grantham. Samantha Bond portrays Lady Rosamund Painswick, Robert's sister who resides in Belgrave Square, London. Dan Stevens portrays Matthew Crawley, the new heir, along with Penelope Wilton as his mother, Isobel Crawley, who are brought to Downton. Allen Leech as Tom Branson begins the series as the family chauffeur, but falls in love with Lady Sybil, marries her, and later becomes the agent for the estate. David Robb portrays Dr Richard Clarkson, the local town doctor.\n\nCrawley Family\n\nThe series is set in Downton Abbey, a Yorkshire country house, which is the home and seat of the Earl and Countess of Grantham, along with their three daughters and other family members. Each series follows the lives of the aristocratic Crawley family, their friends, and their servants during the reign of King George V.\n\nProduction\n\nGareth Neame of Carnival Films conceived the idea of an Edwardian-era TV drama set in a country house and approached Fellowes, who had won an Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay) for Gosford Park. The TV series Downton Abbey—written and created by Fellowes—was originally planned as a spin-off of Gosford Park, but instead was developed as a stand-alone property inspired by the film, set decades earlier. Although Fellowes was reluctant to work on another project resembling Gosford Park, within a few weeks he returned to Neame with an outline of the first series. Influenced by Edith Wharton's The Custom of the Country, Fellowes wrote the scripts; and his wife, Emma, acted as an informal story editor.\n\nFilming Locations\n\nHighclere Castle in north Hampshire is used for exterior shots of Downton Abbey and most of the interior filming. The kitchen, servants' quarters, and working areas, and some of the \"upstairs\" bedrooms were constructed and filmed at Ealing Studios. Bridgewater House in the St James area of London served as the family's London home.\n\nOpening Theme Music\n\nThe opening music of Downton Abbey, titled \"Did I Make the Most of Loving You?\", was composed by John Lunn.\n\nBroadcasts\n\nThe rights to broadcast Downton Abbey have been acquired in over 220 countries and territories, and the series has been viewed by a global audience of an estimated 120 million people.\n\nCritical Response\n\nAt Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the first series received an average score of 91, based on 16 reviews, which indicates \"universal acclaim\". This result earned the show a Guinness World Record in 2011 for \"Highest critical review ratings for a TV show\", making Downton Abbey the critically best received TV show in the world.\n\nRatings\n\nThe first episode of Downton Abbey had a consolidated British audience of 9.2 million viewers, a 32% audience share—making it the most successful new drama on any channel since Whitechapel was launched on ITV in February 2009. The total audience for the first episode, including repeats and ITV Player viewings, exceeded 11.6 million viewers. This was beaten by the next episode, with a total audience of 11.8 million viewers—including repeats and ITV Player views. Downton Abbey broke the record for a single episode viewing on ITV Player.\n\nAwards and Nominations\n\nAlthough Julian Fellowes supports a united Ireland, there has been criticism of the stereotypical Irish characters used in the show, specifically the character of Tom Branson's brother, Kieran, portrayed as a rude and boorish drunk. Allen Leech, who plays Tom Branson, defended the series, stating that the show did not portray Irish characters in a pejorative fashion. Branson's character took some criticism in Ireland from The Irish Times, which described the character as \"an Irish republican turned Downtonian toff.\"\n\nCultural Reaction\n\nAlthough Julian Fellowes supports a united Ireland, there has been criticism of the stereotypical Irish characters used in the show, specifically the character of Tom Branson's brother, Kieran, portrayed as a rude and boorish drunk.

Pearson\n\nJustin J. Pearson is an American politician and environmental activist who has served as a member of the Tennessee House of Representatives since 2023. He was born in Memphis, Tennessee, and grew up in a family that valued education and community service. Pearson has been a vocal advocate for environmental justice and has worked to address issues such as pollution and climate change in his community.\n\n## Early Life and Education\n\nJustin J. Pearson was born in Memphis, Tennessee, to a family of educators. His father was a preacher and his mother a teacher, and they instilled in him a strong sense of social responsibility from a young age. When Pearson was 11 years old, his family moved to the Washington, D.C. area, where his father pursued a master's degree at Howard University. Four years later, the family returned to Memphis, where Pearson attended Mitchell High School in inner-city Memphis.\n\nPearson's experience in high school was marked by a stark contrast between his previous education in Centreville, Virginia, and his new school in Memphis. The school in Memphis was underfunded and lacked resources, which motivated Pearson to become involved in student government and to lobby for textbooks and Advanced Placement classes. He also joined the debate team and became a strong advocate for his community.\n\nPearson graduated as valedictorian of his high school class, a testament to his hard work and dedication to his studies. His experiences in high school prepared him for a career in public service, where he could use his skills and knowledge to make a positive impact in his community.\n\n## Environmental Activism\n\nIn 2020, Pearson co-founded the environmental advocacy group Memphis Community Against Pollution (originally Memphis Community Against the Pipeline), one of two local groups that joined in a successful effort to cancel construction of the Byhalia Pipeline. A portion of the 49-mile-long pipeline would have passed through poor black neighborhoods in south Memphis, as well as over the Memphis sand aquifer, which provides water to residents in the Memphis area.\n\nThe proposed pipeline was met with fierce opposition from local residents, who were concerned about the potential environmental and health impacts of the project. Pearson and his group worked tirelessly to raise awareness about the issue and to build a coalition of local organizations and community leaders who shared their concerns.\n\nThrough their efforts, Pearson and his group were able to mobilize public support against the pipeline, which ultimately led to its cancellation. This victory was a significant achievement for Pearson and his community, and it demonstrated the power of grassroots activism in shaping public policy.\n\n## Political Career\n\nIn 2023, Pearson ran in the Democratic primary for a special election to succeed Barbara Cooper in the Tennessee House of Representatives. Cooper had passed away in October 2022, and her seat was left vacant. Despite the fact that no Republicans or independents filed to run for the seat, the primary was still hotly contested, with ten candidates vying for the nomination.\n\nPearson won the primary with 52.3% of the vote, earning him the right to run in the special general election. Because the seat was unopposed, Pearson was virtually guaranteed victory, and he was sworn into office on January 25, 2023.\n\nAs a member of the Tennessee House of Representatives, Pearson has been a vocal advocate for environmental justice and has worked to address issues such as pollution and climate change in his community. He has also been a strong supporter of education and has worked to increase funding for public schools.\n\n## Protest and Expulsion\n\nOn March 30, 2023, Pearson joined a protest for gun control reform at the state capitol alongside Gloria Johnson and Justin Jones. The protest was in response to the 2023 Covenant School shooting in Nashville, which killed three nine-year-olds and three employees.\n\nPearson, Johnson, and Jones were dubbed by their supporters as \"The Tennessee Three,\" and their participation in the protest was seen as a bold move to push for change in the state. The Tennessee House of Representatives voted on whether to expel the three members, which requires a two-thirds majority or 66 votes.\n\nPearson was expelled by a vote of 69-26, Jones was expelled by 72-25, and Johnson was spared her ouster by just one vote, 65-30. In his final address to the House before his expulsion, Pearson compared his removal from the chamber to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.\n\nThe expulsion of Pearson and his colleagues was widely criticized by politicians and activists, who saw it as a move to silence dissenting voices and to stifle public debate. Vice President Kamala Harris visited with the trio on April 7, 2023, echoing President Joe Biden who had called them earlier, saying, \"Punishing lawmakers who joined thousands of peaceful protesters calling for action\" is \"shocking, undemocratic, and without precedent.\"\n\n## Electoral History\n\nJustin J. Pearson's electoral history is marked by his successful bid for the Tennessee House of Representatives in 2023. He won the Democratic primary with 52.3% of the vote and went on to win the special general election unopposed.\n\nPearson's election to the Tennessee House of Representatives was seen as a significant achievement for environmental activists and progressive groups in the state.

In addition to his individual success, Norrie was ranked All-American three times.\n\n2014-17\n---------\n\nDuring his time at TCU, Norrie continued to excel on the court, winning several titles and becoming a leader on the team.

She had a brother named Jordan Foster, and the family lived in Austin, Texas. Powell's early life and education laid the groundwork for her future endeavors. She was an inquisitive and creative child who developed a strong interest in the arts and writing. Her parents encouraged her creative pursuits, and she began to explore her passion for theater and creative writing.\n\nPowell's academic journey took her to Amherst College, where she graduated in 1995 with a double major in theater and creative writing. Her time at Amherst College was instrumental in shaping her writing skills and her passion for the arts. The college's rigorous academic environment and diverse student body exposed Powell to a wide range of perspectives and ideas, which would later influence her writing and culinary pursuits.\n\n## Career\n\nAfter graduating from Amherst College, Powell began her career in the arts and writing. She worked in various roles, including as a technical writer and a marketing specialist. However, it was her blog, the Julie/Julia Project, that brought her international recognition and acclaim. Launched in 2002, the blog chronicled Powell's attempt to cook all the recipes in Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking. The project was a massive undertaking that required Powell to spend hours in the kitchen, experimenting with new recipes and techniques.\n\nThe Julie/Julia Project quickly gained a large following, and Powell's writing was praised for its wit, humor, and vulnerability. Her blog posts were a reflection of her passion for food, her love of learning, and her struggles with her own identity and relationships. The project's success led to a book deal with Little, Brown and Company, and Powell's book, Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen, was published in 2005.\n\n## Julie & Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen\n\nJulie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen is a memoir that chronicles Powell's experience cooking her way through Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking.

It is a story of self-discovery, love, and loss, as well as a testament to the power of food to bring people together.\n\nThe book was a critical and commercial success, and it introduced Powell to a wider audience. The paperback edition, retitled Julie and Julia: My Year of Cooking Dangerously, became a bestseller, and the book's success paved the way for Powell's future writing endeavors.\n\n## Film\n\nThe success of Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen caught the attention of film director Nora Ephron, who optioned the rights to Powell's book. The resulting film, Julie & Julia, was released in 2009 and starred Amy Adams as Julie Powell and Meryl Streep as Julia Child. The film was a critical and commercial success, and it cemented Powell's status as a culinary icon.\n\n## Cleaving: a Story of Marriage, Meat, and Obsession\n\nPowell's second book, Cleaving: a Story of Marriage, Meat, and Obsession, was published in 2009. The book is a memoir that explores Powell's experiences learning to butcher at Fleisher's butcher shop in Kingston, New York. It is also a deeply personal story that examines the effects of affairs on Powell's marriage.\n\nCleaving received mixed reviews, with some critics praising Powell's writing and others criticizing her openness about her personal life. However, the book remains a significant work in Powell's oeuvre, as it showcases her ability to write about complex and vulnerable topics with humor and wit.\n\n## Return to Salon\n\nIn 2022, Powell returned to writing for Salon, where she began a series of commentary pieces about The Julia Child Challenge, a Food Network reality television show. The show featured a group of chefs competing to recreate Julia Child's recipes, and Powell's commentary pieces offered a unique perspective on the show and its contestants.\n\n## Personal Life and Death\n\nPowell married Eric Powell, an editor for the magazine Archaeology, in 1998. The couple had a long and happy marriage, and Powell's writing often reflected her love and appreciation for her husband.\n\nIn 2022, Powell contracted COVID-19, and she died of cardiac arrest at her home in Olivebridge, New York, on October 26, 2022, at the age of 49. Powell's death was a shock to her fans and fellow writers, and it highlighted the importance of her work and her contributions to the culinary world.\n\nIn addition to her husband, Powell was survived by her brother, Jordan, and her parents, John and Kay.

He grew up in Oxford, Mississippi, where he played basketball for Lafayette High School. Wright's father, Herb, was a professional basketball player who competed in Finland and had a tryout with the Utah Jazz. When Wright was seven years old, his father was working for the Memphis Police Department when he was paralyzed by a gunshot to the back. This incident had a profound impact on Wright's life and motivated him to succeed in basketball.\n\nWright's family moved to Memphis, where he spent his senior year playing basketball for Booker T. Washington High School. He played all levels of basketball in Memphis, including high school, collegiate, and professional levels. Wright's hard work and dedication paid off when he was selected to play for the University of Memphis, where he played college basketball.\n\n**Professional career**\n\nWright was selected seventh overall by the Los Angeles Clippers in the 1996 NBA draft out of the University of Memphis.

shortly after.\n\n\nCast\nThe new film's cast was announced in July 2019, with the cast of the original film signing on two months later:\n\n\nProduction\nIn the early 1990s, following the release of Ghostbusters II, Dan Aykroyd wrote a script for a third film tentatively titled Ghostbusters III: Hellbent [22] In the script, the Ghostbusters are transported to a parallel-universe version of Manhattan called Manhellton, where the people and places are \"hellish\" versions of Earth, and the characters meet and confront the Devil [23] [24] At the time, Aykroyd stated that Columbia Pictures

(2009), which Aykroyd considered to be \"essentially the third movie\" [25] At various stages of its development, Chris Farley, Chris Rock, and Ben Stiller were reported as potential stars of a new Ghostbusters film [26]\n\n\nDevelopment as Ghostbusters: Afterlife\nA new film connected to the original two films was revealed in January 2019 Ivan Reitman's son Jason was confirmed to direct from a script he co-wrote with Gil Kenan while Ivan would serve as a producer [51] The film would feature teenagers—two males and two females—as the recruits for the Ghostbusters team [52]\n\n\nCasting\nThe castings of Mckenna Grace as the young female protagonist, Finn Wolfhard as her brother, and Carrie Coon as their single mother were revealed in March 2019 [5] [9] Reitman described Grace as an avid fan of the series and a perfect fit for his concept of a teenage female Ghostbuster [55] Wolfhard, who had dressed as a Ghostbuster during the second season of Stranger Things, was unsure he would get the role, saying that \"Jason Reitman is probably not even going to look at my tape\" because of that [60] Paul Rudd was cast in the film in June, later confirming his role of Mr Grooberson, the children's new teacher who knows of the Ghostbusters' legacy [10] [61] [6] Rudd himself had worked with Harold Ramis in an uncredited role for his final film Year One.\n\n\nDesign\nReitman shot on location and relied on practical effect as much as possible to maintain stylistic continuity with the original films The Spengler farmhouse was a practical set built on a ridge that recalled the Psycho house An old barn was relocated and reconstructed piece-by-piece on location for the unveiling of Ecto-1 Two Ectomobiles were used during filming While the vehicles were vintage 1959 Cadillac Miller-Meteor Sentinels, modern performance engines and suspension upgrades were required to complete the stunt sequences which were filmed on real city streets [65]\n\n\nCreature effects\nReitman and the production crew reviewed the designs of the original film's ghosts and other supernatural creatures for use in Afterlife, observing the designs looked different from each other and were distinct [56] The creature known as \"Muncher\", co-created by creature designer Brynn Metheney, is similar to Slimer; Reitman explained: \"Something happened to Slimer over the years that people started thinking of him as the dalmatian of the firehouse The original Slimer was an angry dude and very scary and we wanted to get back to that\", [56] and Metheney wanted to make Muncher whom \"the audience can latch on to\" easily, giving him a universal appeal of him being \"funny and cool and cute and weird in every way\" like Slimer yet completely new and different from his green predecessor Though the film did not reveal Muncher's origin, Metheney's character personality reveals that the ghost in life was a miner \"conjured into existence by a séance gone wrong in the 1940s\" at Summerville Foundry's supervisor's office and he has haunted the plant ever since then, \"after terrorizing the group that contacted him\" Her most ambitious design was the Mini-Pufts; she wanted to give them a realistic look on scale and texture of authentic marshmallows than the colossal Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, even bought packages of them to make tiny marshmallow men for visual references and inspirations For the scenes of Summerville Crossrip, Metheney created the \"flaming phantasms\" that chase a firetruck and pedestrians outside the Spinners Roller Hop and included the animated series The Real Ghostbusters' popular three-eye ghost Bug-Eye in homage to the show Other apparition concepts that did not make the final cut include a rancher ghost, Louise the crossing guard ghost of Summerville Middle School, possessed balloons and sandwiches, and more miner ghosts (Dynamite, Pick Axe, Lunchbox, Coats, and Shovel) after Muncher Creature effects designer Arjen Tuiten, who is a fan of the first film's special effects artist Steve Johnson, personally created the \"Old Miner Ghost\" in resemblance to his idol's \"Zombie Taxi Ghost\" without Metheney's involvement [18]\n\n\nFilming\nUnder the working title \"Rust City\", principal photography began on July 12, 2019, in and around Calgary, Alberta, and lasted until October Location filming occurred in surrounding communities such as Crossfield, Beiseker, [67] Drumheller and Fort Macleod (Muncher chase scene) during July and August [68] Other locations around Alberta were also used [68] [69] [70] Filming was wrapped after sixty-eight days on October 18 [71]\n\n\nMusic\nThe score for Ghostbusters: Afterlife was composed by Rob Simonsen and conducted by William Ross and Anthony Parnther Simonsen studied Elmer Bernstein's score for the first Ghostbusters film and recruited Bernstein's son Peter, who guided the orchestration of Simonsen's score and the use of material from Ghostbusters (1984), as a score consultant [citation needed] Simonsen used the ondes martenot throughout the score, which was played by Cynthia Millar, who played the same instrument on Bernstein's 1984 Ghostbusters score The soundtrack was released on  Compact Disc on November 19, 2021.\n\n\nRelease\nGhostbusters: Afterlife was originally scheduled to be released in the United States on July 10, 2020, by Sony Pictures

attack, dying shortly after.\n\n\nCast\nThe new film's cast was announced in July 2019, with the cast of the original film signing on two months later:\n\n\nProduction\nIn the early 1990s, following the release of Ghostbusters II, Dan Aykroyd wrote a script for a third film tentatively titled Ghostbusters III: Hellbent [22] In the script, the Ghostbusters are transported to a parallel-universe version of Manhattan called Manhellton, where the people and places are \"hellish\" versions of Earth, and the characters meet and confront the Devil [23] [24] At the time, Aykroyd stated that

stars of a new Ghostbusters film [26]\n\n\nDevelopment as Ghostbusters: Afterlife\nA new film connected to the original two films was revealed in January 2019 Ivan Reitman's son Jason was confirmed to direct from a script he co-wrote with Gil Kenan while Ivan would serve as a producer [51] The film would feature teenagers—two males and two females—as the recruits for the Ghostbusters team [52]\n\n\nCasting\nThe castings of Mckenna Grace as the young female protagonist, Finn Wolfhard as her brother, and Carrie Coon as their single mother were revealed in March 2019 [5] [9] Reitman described Grace as an avid fan of the series and a perfect fit for his concept of a teenage female Ghostbuster [55] Wolfhard, who had dressed as a Ghostbuster during the second season of Stranger Things, was unsure he would get the role, saying that \"Jason Reitman is probably not even going to look at my tape\" because of that [60] Paul Rudd was cast in the film in June, later confirming his role of Mr Grooberson, the children's new teacher who knows of the Ghostbusters' legacy [10] [61] [6] Rudd himself had worked with Harold Ramis in an uncredited role for his final film Year One.\n\n\nDesign\nReitman shot on location and relied on practical effect as much as possible to maintain stylistic continuity with the original films The Spengler farmhouse was a practical set built on a ridge that recalled the Psycho house An old barn was relocated and reconstructed piece-by-piece on location for the unveiling of Ecto-1 Two Ectomobiles were used during filming While the vehicles were vintage 1959 Cadillac Miller-Meteor Sentinels, modern performance engines and suspension upgrades were required to complete the stunt sequences which were filmed on real city streets [65]\n\n\nCreature effects\nReitman and the production crew reviewed the designs of the original film's ghosts and other supernatural creatures for use in Afterlife, observing the designs looked different from each other and were distinct [56] The creature known as \"Muncher\", co-created by creature designer Brynn Metheney, is similar to Slimer; Reitman explained: \"Something happened to Slimer over the years that people started thinking of him as the dalmatian of the firehouse The original Slimer was an angry dude and very scary and we wanted to get back to that\", [56] and Metheney wanted to make Muncher whom \"the audience can latch on to\" easily, giving him a universal appeal of him being \"funny and cool and cute and weird in every way\" like Slimer yet completely new and different from his green predecessor Though the film did not reveal Muncher's origin, Metheney's character personality reveals that the ghost in life was a miner \"conjured into existence by a séance gone wrong in the 1940s\" at Summerville Foundry's supervisor's office and he has haunted the plant ever since then, \"after terrorizing the group that contacted him\" Her most ambitious design was the Mini-Pufts; she wanted to give them a realistic look on scale and texture of authentic marshmallows than the colossal Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, even bought packages of them to make tiny marshmallow men for visual references and inspirations For the scenes of Summerville Crossrip, Metheney created the \"flaming phantasms\" that chase a firetruck and pedestrians outside the Spinners Roller Hop and included the animated series The Real Ghostbusters' popular three-eye ghost Bug-Eye in homage to the show Other apparition concepts that did not make the final cut include a rancher ghost, Louise the crossing guard ghost of Summerville Middle School, possessed balloons and sandwiches, and more miner ghosts (Dynamite, Pick Axe, Lunchbox, Coats, and Shovel) after Muncher Creature effects designer Arjen Tuiten, who is a fan of the first film's special effects artist Steve Johnson, personally created the \"Old Miner Ghost\" in resemblance to his idol's \"Zombie Taxi Ghost\" without Metheney's involvement [18]\n\n\nFilming\nUnder the working title \"Rust City\", principal photography began on July 12, 2019, in and around Calgary, Alberta, and lasted until October Location filming occurred in surrounding communities such as Crossfield, Beiseker, [67] Drumheller and Fort Macleod (Muncher chase scene) during July and August [68] Other locations around Alberta were also used [68] [69] [70] Filming was wrapped after sixty-eight days on October 18 [71]\n\n\nMusic\nThe score for Ghostbusters: Afterlife was composed by Rob Simonsen and conducted by William Ross and Anthony Parnther Simonsen studied Elmer Bernstein's score for the first Ghostbusters film and recruited Bernstein's son Peter, who guided the orchestration of Simonsen's score and the use of material from Ghostbusters (1984), as a score consultant [citation needed] Simonsen used the ondes martenot throughout the score, which was played by Cynthia Millar, who played the same instrument on Bernstein's 1984 Ghostbusters score The soundtrack was released on  Compact Disc on November 19, 2021.\n\n\nRelease\nGhostbusters: Afterlife was originally scheduled to be released in the United States on July 10, 2020, by Sony Pictures Releasing [74] but its release was postponed to March 5, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic [75] Sony pushed the film to June 11, 2021, [76] then later

before its completion), [18] and the former is commemorated before its closing credits.\n\n\nTheatrical\nGhostbusters: Afterlife was originally scheduled to be released in the United States on July

franchise, with the new products (including action figures and role-play items) originally scheduled to be released in stores in April 2020 [82] Because of the pandemic delays to the film's release date, the introduction of Ghostbusters: Afterlife toys to market was also delayed Target received exclusive versions of some toys ahead of the projected June 2021 release date, but further rollouts

It was one of the strongest typhoons to affect the region in recent years, bringing heavy rainfall, strong winds, and coastal flooding to several islands and coastal communities.\n\n**Meteorological History**\n\nDuring mid-April 2021, an area of atmospheric convection associated with a weak area of low pressure developed roughly 1,150 km (710 mi) south of Guam. By April 10, the disturbance had acquired nascent rainbands within an environment exhibiting low wind shear, warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs) between 28-29°C (82-84°F), and a well-established outflow, which was conducive for further tropical cyclogenesis. Showers and thunderstorms continued to emerge around the circulation embedded within the disturbance.\n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) assessed the formation of a tropical depression near 5°N 143°E on April 12. Due to its anticipated track into Philippine waters, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also began issuing advisories on the tropical depression on April 12. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) later that day, projecting a high likelihood of a significant tropical cyclone developing.\n\nBy April 13, the agency assessed the disturbance as a tropical depression. The tropical depression continued to intensify, and on April 14, it was upgraded to a tropical storm by the JMA. The storm was named Surigae, which is the name given to the storm by the PAGASA.\n\n**Preparations**\n\nDue to the threat of the storm, a Tropical Storm Watch was issued for the island of Yap and Ngulu Atoll as well as for Koror and Kayangel in Palau on April 14. The watch was upgraded to a Tropical Storm Warning for Ngulu Atoll later that day. Residents in the affected areas were advised to take necessary precautions and to stay informed about the latest weather updates.\n\n**Impact**\n\nLocally heavy rainfall occurred in parts of Palau and Yap for several days. Surigae brought sustained winds of up to 80 km/h (50 mph) and gusts up to 135 km/h (84 mph) to Palau, causing power outages across the island. Large swells from the developing storm brought coastal flooding to Koror and Yap. Residents in those areas were advised to avoid reef lines in the north and west, and to take caution on beaches due to rip currents and large waves.\n\nSurigae was the closest typhoon to pass near the island of Palau since Typhoon Haiyan. Restaurants, sporting events, and other services were closed in Palau as Surigae approached closer– yet schools remained open. Schools were not suspended until power had been cut off across much of the entire country. Water and cellular services were also downed. There was criticism for the lack of news coverage on the typhoon in Palau.\n\n125 homes across the country were destroyed, while at least 1,500 sustained minor damage. The entire population of Palau, consisting of approximately 18,008 people, was impacted by the typhoon. At least US$2 million worth of infrastructure alone was damaged in Palau. The total amount of damage across health, infrastructure, education, food, communication, utilities, and other sectors was assessed at US$4.8 million. President of Palau Surangel Whipps Jr issued a national state of emergency on April 18. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) provided US$100,000 for immediate assistance to support those affected.\n\n**Micronesia and Palau**\n\nLocally heavy rainfall occurred in parts of Palau and Yap for several days.

Another boat with two fishermen aboard capsized during midnight on its way to Bantayan Island, with both of two fishermen having to swim back to shore. On April 19, Surigae forced the cargo ship LCU Cebu Great Ocean, carrying twenty crew members and nickel ore, to run aground on the coast of the Province of Surigao del Norte, in the southern Philippines.\n\nAt least six of the crew members were found dead, while seven were rescued; the search continues for another missing seven crew members. Heavy rain from the outer bands of Surigae battered Eastern Visayas and the Bicol Region as it passed around 345 km (214 mi) to the east of Catanduanes. Widespread rainfall totals of up to 8-12 inches (200-300 mm) occurred in the eastern Philippines, while 20.13 inches (511 mm) of rain fell in Virac, Catanduanes, and surrounding areas.\n\nA funnel cloud was also briefly reported in Camarines Sur. Twenty-two barangays were flooded in Eastern Visayas, and in the municipality of Jipapad, flooding reached 4 meters (13 ft). Power interruptions were experienced in Central Visayas, Eastern Visayas, and in Eastern Samar, power was interrupted for the whole province. 109,815 people were displaced by flooding and landslides in the Bicol Region.\n\n**Elsewhere**\n\nThe influence of Surigae caused gusts in North Sulawesi that reached 23 mph (37 km/h). Large waves of 13.1-19.8 feet (4.0-6.0 m) affected the coastal waters of the Sitaro Islands Regency, Sangihe Islands Regency, the Talaud Islands, and the northern Molucca Sea.\n\nSurigae made its closest approach to Taiwan on April 22. The typhoon's outer bands brought much-needed rainfall to central Taiwan, which was going through its worst drought in 56 years. There were also reports of hail. Large waves up to 4.2 m (14 ft) tall generated by Surigae were recorded along Taiwan's east coast on April 21.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of typhoons in 2021\n* List of most intense tropical cyclones by central pressure\n\n**Notes**\n\nThis article is based on information from various sources, including the Japan Meteorological Agency, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any references as it is based on publicly available information.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Japan Meteorological Agency\n* Philippine Atmospheric, Geographical and Astronomical Services Administration\n* Joint Typhoon Warning Center", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Typhoon_Surigae\" following this outline:\n\n\nMeteorological history\n\nDuring mid-April 2021, an area of atmospheric convection associated with a weak area of low pressure developed roughly 1,150 km (710 mi) south of Guam By April 10, the disturbance had acquired nascent rainbands within an environment exhibiting low wind shear, warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs) between 28–29 °C (82–84 °F), and a well-established outflow, which was conducive for further tropical cyclogenesis [4] Showers and thunderstorms continued to emerge around the circulation embedded within the disturbance [5] The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) [nb 3] assessed the formation of a tropical depression near 5°N 143°E﻿ / ﻿5°N 143°E﻿ / 5;
