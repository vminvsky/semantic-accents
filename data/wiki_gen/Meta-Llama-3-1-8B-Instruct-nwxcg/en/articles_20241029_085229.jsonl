The film stars Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie, Diego Calva, Jovan Adepo, Li Jun Li, Jean Smart, and Tobey Maguire. It is a fictionalized account of the 1920s Hollywood film industry and the transition from silent films to the talkies.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film is set in 1927 and follows a group of young and ambitious filmmakers as they navigate the cutthroat world of Hollywood. The story centers around Manny Torres (Diego Calva), a young Mexican-American man who becomes embroiled in a complex web of relationships with the film industry's elite. Manny is a driver and mechanic for one of the film's biggest stars, Jack Conrad (Brad Pitt), who is struggling to adapt to the new sound technology. As Manny becomes more involved in the film industry, he finds himself caught between his loyalty to Jack and his growing feelings for a young actress, Nellie LaRoy (Margot Robbie).\n\nMeanwhile, the film's director, Irving Thalberg (Li Jun Li), is struggling to balance his own creative vision with the commercial demands of the studio system. As the film's production becomes increasingly chaotic, the characters' personal lives begin to unravel, leading to a series of tragic and devastating consequences.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Brad Pitt as Jack Conrad\n* Margot Robbie as Nellie LaRoy\n* Diego Calva as Manny Torres\n* Jovan Adepo as Will Daniels\n* Li Jun Li as Irving Thalberg\n* Jean Smart as Elinor St. John\n* Tobey Maguire as Father James\n* Olivia Wilde as Lady Fayruz\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nBabylon was first announced in 2019, with Damien Chazelle set to write and direct the film. Chazelle has stated that he was inspired by the excesses of the 1920s Hollywood film industry, which he sees as a symbol of the American Dream gone wrong. The film's script was reportedly written in just a few weeks, with Chazelle drawing on a wide range of sources, including the memoirs of film industry veterans and the history of the sound film.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography on Babylon began in November 2020 and wrapped in April 2021. The film was shot on location in Los Angeles, with many of the scenes filmed in the city's historic neighborhoods. The production also made use of a number of elaborate sets and costumes, which were designed to evoke the glamour and excess of the 1920s Hollywood film industry.\n\n### Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Justin Hurwitz, who has collaborated with Chazelle on several previous projects. The score features a mix of jazz and classical music, with a number of references to the work of composers such as Igor Stravinsky and Maurice Ravel.\n\n**Themes**\n\nBabylon explores a number of themes, including the corrupting influence of power, the dangers of ambition, and the fragility of the human psyche. The film also examines the changing nature of the film industry in the 1920s, as it transitioned from silent films to the talkies. Through its characters and storylines, the film raises questions about the value and meaning of art in the face of commercial and social pressures.\n\n**Release**\n\n### Theatrical\n\nBabylon was released in the United States on December 23, 2022, by Paramount Pictures. The film was released in a number of international markets in early 2023, including the United Kingdom, Australia, and Japan.\n\n### Home media\n\nBabylon was released on digital platforms in January 2023, followed by a Blu-ray and DVD release in February 2023. The home media release includes a number of bonus features, including deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes footage, and a commentary track by Chazelle and the cast.\n\n### Marketing\n\nThe marketing campaign for Babylon was launched in September 2022, with a number of promotional posters and trailers released online. The campaign emphasized the film's themes of excess and decadence, with a number of social media ads featuring images of the film's characters in elaborate costumes and settings.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Box office\n\nBabylon was a commercial success, grossing over $220 million worldwide on a budget of $80 million. The film opened at number one at the domestic box office, with a opening weekend gross of over $25 million. The film received a number of positive reviews from critics, with many praising its visuals, performances, and themes.\n\n### Critical response\n\nBabylon received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising its visuals, performances, and themes. The film holds a 92% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 8.5/10. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 82 out of 100, based on 45 reviews.\n\n**Accolades**\n\nBabylon received a number of awards and nominations, including several Academy Award nominations. The film was nominated for Best Director, Best Actor for Brad Pitt, and Best Supporting Actress for Margot Robbie. The film also received several Golden Globe nominations, including Best Director, Best Actor for Brad Pitt, and Best Supporting Actress for Margot Robbie.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of films about the film industry\n* List of American epic films\n* List of films set in Los Angeles\n\n**References**\n\nNone\n\n**External links**\n\n* Official website\n* Babylon at IMDb\n* Babylon at Rotten Tomatoes\n* Babylon at Metacritic", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Babylon_(2022_film)\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Filming\n##Music\n#Themes\n#Release\n##Theatrical\n##Home media\n##Marketing\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n#Accolades\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Fuzzball_(string_theory)", "content": "#Physical properties\n##String theory and composition\n##Densities\n##Neutron star collapse\n#Information paradox\n#Testability of the theory\n#References\n#External links\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Fuzzball (string theory)\n\nIn string theory, a fuzzball is a hypothetical object that is proposed to be the fundamental unit of matter, replacing the concept of a point-like particle. This idea is part of the theory of black holes, which suggests that the traditional view of a black hole as a singularity is incorrect, and that the information contained in matter that falls into a black hole is not lost, but rather preserved in a more complex form.\n\n# Physical properties\n\n## String theory and composition\n\nString theory proposes that the fundamental building blocks of the universe are not point-like particles, but rather tiny, vibrating strings. These strings are thought to be the source of all matter and energy in the universe, and they are the fundamental units of matter. In the context of black holes, the strings that make up the matter that falls into a black hole are thought to be \"fuzzed up\" into a more complex object, which is known as a fuzzball.\n\nThe fuzzball is thought to be a highly entangled system of strings, with a large number of degrees of freedom. This means that the fuzzball has a large number of possible states, and it is able to store a large amount of information. In fact, the amount of information that a fuzzball can store is thought to be infinite, which is a key aspect of the holographic principle.\n\n## Densities\n\nThe density of a fuzzball is thought to be extremely high, with estimates suggesting that it is comparable to or even greater than the density of a neutron star. This is because the strings that make up the fuzzball are thought to be packed very tightly together, with a large amount of energy density.\n\nThe density of a fuzzball is also thought to be highly variable, depending on the specific configuration of the strings that make it up. This is because the strings are thought to be highly entangled, with a large number of possible states. As a result, the density of a fuzzball can vary widely, depending on the specific conditions that it is in.\n\n## Neutron star collapse\n\nOne of the key ways in which fuzzballs are thought to form is through the collapse of neutron stars. When a neutron star collapses, the density of the star increases, and the strings that make it up become more tightly packed. This causes the strings to become \"fuzzed up\" into a more complex object, which is known as a fuzzball.\n\nThe collapse of a neutron star is thought to occur when the star runs out of fuel and is unable to support its own weight. As the star collapses, the density of the star increases, and the strings that make it up become more tightly packed. This causes the strings to become \"fuzzed up\" into a more complex object, which is known as a fuzzball.\n\n# Information paradox\n\nOne of the key problems with the traditional view of black holes is the information paradox. This paradox suggests that when matter falls into a black hole, the information contained in that matter is lost forever. However, this is in direct conflict with the principles of quantum mechanics, which suggest that information cannot be lost.\n\nThe information paradox was first proposed by Stephen Hawking, who suggested that the information contained in matter that falls into a black hole is lost forever. However, this idea has been challenged by other physicists, who suggest that the information contained in matter that falls into a black hole is preserved in a more complex form.\n\nFuzzballs offer a possible solution to the information paradox. This is because fuzzballs are thought to be highly entangled systems, with a large number of degrees of freedom. This means that the fuzzball is able to store a large amount of information, and it is possible that this information is preserved even after the fuzzball has formed.\n\n# Testability of the theory\n\nOne of the key challenges with the theory of fuzzballs is that it is highly speculative, and it is difficult to test. The theory is based on a number of assumptions, including the idea that the universe is made up of tiny, vibrating strings, and that these strings are the fundamental units of matter.\n\nHowever, there are a number of ways in which the theory of fuzzballs can be tested. For example, it is possible to use observational evidence from the universe to test the predictions of the theory. Additionally, it is possible to use computational simulations to test the predictions of the theory.\n\nOne of the key areas of research in the study of fuzzballs is the development of new computational tools and techniques. This is because the study of fuzzballs requires the use of highly complex computational models, and it is often difficult to simulate the behavior of these models.\n\n# References\n\nThere are no references for this article.\n\n# External links\n\nThere are no external links for this article.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Fuzzball_(string_theory)\" following this outline:\n\n#Physical properties\n##String theory and composition\n##Densities\n##Neutron star collapse\n#Information paradox\n#Testability of the theory\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The season began on December 13, 2022, and concluded on February 4, 2023.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Big Bash League has undergone significant changes since its inception in 2011, with the introduction of new teams, rule changes, and an expanded schedule. The league has become one of the most popular domestic T20 competitions in the world, attracting some of the biggest names in international cricket. The 2022–23 season was expected to be highly competitive, with many teams looking to improve on their previous seasons' performances.\n\n**Teams**\n\n**Personnel and stadiums**\n\nThe 2022–23 Big Bash League season featured eight teams, each representing a different Australian city or region.\n\n| Team | City/Region | Stadium |\n| Sydney Sixers | Sydney, New South Wales | Sydney Cricket Ground |\n| Sydney Thunder | Sydney, New South Wales | Sydney Showground Stadium |\n| Melbourne Stars | Melbourne, Victoria | Melbourne Cricket Ground |\n| Melbourne Renegades | Melbourne, Victoria | Kardinia Park |\n| Perth Scorchers | Perth, Western Australia | Perth Stadium |\n| Hobart Hurricanes | Hobart, Tasmania | Blundstone Arena |\n| Adelaide Strikers | Adelaide, South Australia | Adelaide Oval |\n| Brisbane Heat | Brisbane, Queensland | The Gabba |\n\n**Squads**\n\nEach team had a 25-player squad, with a mix of domestic and international players. The squads were announced in November 2022, with some teams making changes during the season.\n\n**Visa-contracted players**\n\nAs part of the Big Bash League's agreement with Cricket Australia, each team was allowed to sign up to three visa-contracted players.

Born on April 16, 1974, in Santa Cruz, California, Sharma has spent most of his life pursuing his passion for climbing.\n\n**Early Life**\nChris Sharma's interest in climbing began at a young age. As a child, he would often accompany his father, a skilled climber, on ascents in the Santa Cruz Mountains. This early exposure to climbing sparked Sharma's enthusiasm, and by the time he was six years old, he was already climbing independently.\n\n**Climbing Career**\nSharma's climbing career can be divided into distinct periods, each marked by significant achievements and contributions to the sport.\n\n### 1996–2002 (to Realization)\nSharma's early competitive career was characterized by his participation in various national and international climbing competitions. In 1998, he won the first-ever Lead Climbing World Cup, held in Munich, Germany. This victory marked the beginning of his dominance in the sport. During this period, Sharma also made several significant ascents, including the first free ascent of the route \"Perfecto Mundo\" in the Sierra de Tozal, Spain.\n\n### 2002–2008 (to Jumbo Love)\nThe early 2000s saw Sharma's focus shift from competitive climbing to pushing the limits of free climbing. In 2002, he made the first free ascent of the route \"The Game\" in the Sierra de Tozal, a climb that would later be considered one of the most iconic ascents in rock climbing history. Sharma's innovative approach to climbing, which emphasized the use of the body's natural movements to ascend routes, began to gain recognition during this period.\n\n### 2008–2013 (to La Dura Dura)\nIn the late 2000s and early 2010s, Sharma continued to push the boundaries of free climbing, making several notable ascents in the United States, Europe, and Asia. The 2008 ascent of \"Jumbo Love\" in Yosemite National Park, California, marked a significant milestone in Sharma's career. This route, which involved a 30-meter overhang and required Sharma to use his full body strength and flexibility, was considered one of the most challenging ascents in the world at the time.\n\n### Post 2013\nSince 2013, Sharma has continued to climb and explore new destinations. In 2015, he made the first free ascent of the route \"La Dura Dura\" in Oliana, Spain, which involved a 5.15c (9a+) grade and 40-meter overhang. This ascent solidified Sharma's position as one of the world's leading climbers.\n\n**Legacy**\nChris Sharma's impact on rock climbing is multifaceted. His innovative approach to climbing has inspired a new generation of climbers to push the limits of what is possible. His ascents, many of which were considered impossible at the time, have expanded the boundaries of the sport and continue to influence the development of new climbing techniques and equipment.\n\n**Personal Life**\nIn addition to his climbing career, Sharma is known for his interest in spirituality and personal growth. He has been a student of Zen Buddhism for many years and has incorporated meditation and mindfulness into his daily routine.\n\n**Zen**\nSharma's connection to Zen has had a significant impact on his climbing philosophy. He believes that the principles of Zen, such as non-attachment and being present in the moment, have helped him to approach climbing with a clearer mind and a greater sense of awareness.\n\n**Notable Ascents**\n\n### Redpointed Routes\nDuring his career, Sharma has redpointed numerous iconic routes, including:\n\n* The Game (Sierra de Tozal, Spain)\n* Jumbo Love (Yosemite National Park, California)\n* La Dura Dura (Oliana, Spain)\n\n### Onsighted Routes\nSharma has also made several notable onsight ascents, including:\n\n* Perfecto Mundo (Sierra de Tozal, Spain)\n* The Sunspot (Yosemite National Park, California)\n\n### Deep-water Solo Routes\nSharma has explored deep-water solo routes in various locations, including:\n\n* The Ice Box (Tenerife, Canary Islands)\n* The Cave (Gibraltar)\n\n### Boulder Problems\nSharma has solved numerous boulder problems, including:\n\n* The Problem (Sierra de Tozal, Spain)\n* The Boulder Box (Yosemite National Park, California)\n\n**Bibliography**\nSharma has written articles and contributed to climbing publications, including:\n\n* Climbing Magazine\n* Rock and Ice\n* Vertical Magazine\n\n**Filmography**\nSharma has appeared in several climbing films, including:\n\n* The Game (2002)\n* Jumbo Love (2008)\n* La Dura Dura (2015)\n\n**Competitions**\nSharma has participated in numerous climbing competitions, including:\n\n* Lead Climbing World Cup (1998)\n* Bouldering World Cup (2000)\n* Climbing Masters (2005)\n\n**See also**\n* Climbing\n* Rock climbing\n* Free climbing\n* Bouldering\n* Deep-water solo\n\n**Notes**\nThis article is a comprehensive overview of Chris Sharma's life and career.

It is characterized by a specific weave and design, which has been used to create a wide range of fabrics, from clothing to home decor items. Tartan is often associated with Scottish culture and heritage, but it has been used in other cultures and regions as well.\n\n**Etymology and Terminology**\n\nThe word \"tartan\" is derived from the French word \"tartane,\" which refers to a type of striped fabric. In Scotland, the term \"tartan\" is used to describe a specific type of woven fabric that features a specific pattern of stripes and colors. In Scottish culture, tartan is an important part of the country's heritage and is often used to identify specific clans, families, or regions.\n\n**Weaving and Design**\n\n**Weaving Construction**\n\nTartan fabric is woven using a specific type of loom that allows for the creation of a complex pattern of stripes and colors. The fabric is typically woven using a combination of wool and other fibers, such as cotton or silk. The warp threads are typically made of wool, while the weft threads are made of cotton or other fibers. The specific weaving technique used to create tartan fabric is known as \"twill weaving,\" which involves weaving the warp threads at an angle to create a diagonal pattern.\n\n**Styles and Design Principles**\n\nTartan designs can vary widely, but they are typically characterized by a specific pattern of stripes and colors. The most common type of tartan is known as a \"sett,\" which features a specific number of threads of different colors woven together to create a specific pattern. The sett can be as simple as a single stripe or as complex as a multi-colored pattern featuring multiple stripes and colors. In addition to the sett, tartan designs can also feature other elements, such as borders, motifs, and other decorative elements.\n\n**Colour, Palettes, and Meaning**\n\nTartan colors can vary widely, but they are typically associated with specific meanings and symbolism. In Scottish culture, tartan colors are often associated with specific clans, families, or regions, and are used to identify the wearer or the fabric. The most common tartan colors are red, blue, green, yellow, and black, although other colors such as purple and silver are also used. The specific meaning of tartan colors can vary depending on the context and the specific design.\n\n**Early History**\n\n**Pre-medieval Origins**\n\nThe origins of tartan are unclear, but it is believed to have originated in the pre-medieval period in Scotland. The earliest known examples of tartan fabric date back to the 7th century, when the Picts, a Celtic tribe that inhabited Scotland, used a type of woven fabric featuring a complex pattern of stripes and colors. This early tartan fabric was likely used for clothing and other textiles.\n\n**Medieval**\n\nDuring the medieval period, tartan fabric became more widespread in Scotland, and was used by the nobility and the clergy. The most common type of tartan fabric during this period was known as the \"Gordon tartan,\" which featured a specific pattern of stripes and colors that was associated with the Gordon clan. This tartan fabric was used for clothing, upholstery, and other textiles.\n\n**16th century**\n\nIn the 16th century, tartan fabric became more widespread in Scotland, and was used by a wider range of people. The most common type of tartan fabric during this period was known as the \"Stewart tartan,\" which featured a specific pattern of stripes and colors that was associated with the Stewart clan. This tartan fabric was used for clothing, upholstery, and other textiles.\n\n**17th century**\n\nDuring the 17th century, tartan fabric became an important part of Scottish culture, and was used by a wide range of people, including the nobility, the clergy, and the common people. The most common type of tartan fabric during this period was known as the \"Mackenzie tartan,\" which featured a specific pattern of stripes and colors that was associated with the Mackenzie clan.\n\n**18th century**\n\nIn the 18th century, tartan fabric became an important part of Scottish culture, and was used by a wide range of people, including the nobility, the clergy, and the common people. The most common type of tartan fabric during this period was known as the \"Cameron tartan,\" which featured a specific pattern of stripes and colors that was associated with the Cameron clan.\n\n**Union Protest and Jacobite Rebellion**\n\nIn the late 18th century, the Act of Union between Scotland and England sparked a wave of protests and rebellions, including the Jacobite Rebellion of 1745. During this period, tartan fabric became a symbol of Scottish identity and resistance, and was used by the Jacobite rebels to identify themselves. The most common type of tartan fabric during this period was known as the \"Black Watch tartan,\" which featured a specific pattern of stripes and colors that was associated with the Black Watch regiment.\n\n**Proscription and its Aftermath**\n\nIn 1746, the British government banned the wearing of tartan fabric as a way of suppressing the Jacobite rebellion. This ban, known as the \"Act of Proscription,\" was designed to limit the use of tartan fabric and to prevent its use as a symbol of Scottish identity. The ban was enforced for over 40 years, during which time the use of tartan fabric was limited to specific contexts, such as the military and the clergy.\n\n**Regimental Tartans**\n\nIn the 19th century, tartan fabric became an important part of military tradition, and was used by a wide range of regiments, including the Black Watch, the Gordon Highlanders, and the Scots Guards. Each regiment had its own unique tartan pattern, which was used to identify the regiment and its soldiers.\n\n**Clan Tartans**\n\n**Long-running Debate**\n\nThe use of clan tartans has been the subject of a long-running debate, with some arguing that the use of clan tartans is a way of promoting Scottish identity and heritage, while others argue that it is a way of promoting exclusivity and elitism.\n\n**Earliest Evidence**\n\nThe earliest evidence of clan tartans dates back to the 16th century, when the Stewart clan used a specific tartan pattern that was associated with their clan. However, it is unclear whether this tartan pattern was used exclusively by the Stewart clan, or whether it was used by other clans as well.\n\n**Lack of Further Evidence of Early Adoption**\n\nThere is limited evidence of the use of clan tartans during the 17th and 18th centuries, which suggests that the use of clan tartans may have been limited during this period.\n\n**19th century Broad Adoption**\n\nIn the 19th century, the use of clan tartans became more widespread, and was used by a wide range of clans and families. This was partly due to the publication of \"The Vestiarium Scoticum,\" a book that documented the use of clan tartans and provided a guide to their use.\n\n**20th century Consolidation**\n\nIn the 20th century, the use of clan tartans became more consolidated, and was used by a wide range of clans and families. This was partly due to the recognition of clan chiefs, who were responsible for identifying and authenticating clan tartans.\n\n**Recognition by Clan Chiefs**\n\nThe recognition of clan chiefs has played an important role in the authentication and identification of clan tartans. Clan chiefs are responsible for identifying and authenticating clan tartans, and for ensuring that they are used in accordance with traditional practices.\n\n**Modern General Use**\n\n**Late Georgian**\n\nIn the late Georgian period, tartan fabric became more widely available, and was used by a wide range of people, including the nobility, the clergy, and the common people.

This marked the beginning of a trend towards the use of tartan fabric in civilian contexts.\n\n**Civilian Spread**\n\nIn the mid-19th century, the use of tartan fabric spread beyond the military and the nobility, and was used by a wide range of people, including the clergy, the merchant class, and the common people.\n\n**Victorian**\n\nDuring the Victorian period, tartan fabric became an important part of Scottish culture, and was used by a wide range of people, including the nobility, the clergy, and the common people. The most common type of tartan fabric during this period was known as the \"Black Watch tartan,\" which featured a specific pattern of stripes and colors that was associated with the Black Watch regiment.\n\n**Vestiarium Scoticum**\n\nIn 1842, Captain Charles Ruthven, a Scottish military officer, published \"The Vestiarium Scoticum,\" a book that documented the use of clan tartans and provided a guide to their use. This book helped to popularize the use of clan tartans and to establish their place in Scottish culture.\n\n**The Queen and \"Balmorality\"**\n\nIn the 19th century, Queen Victoria became associated with the tartan fabric, and was often depicted wearing tartan clothing and accessories. This marked the beginning of a trend towards the use of tartan fabric in civilian contexts, and helped to popularize the use of tartan fabric in Scotland and beyond.\n\n**Ripple Effects**\n\nThe popularity of tartan fabric in Scotland and beyond had a number of ripple effects, including the establishment of the tartan industry, the creation of new tartan patterns, and the popularization of tartan fabric in other cultures.\n\n**20th century to present**\n\n**Diaspora and Globalisation**\n\nIn the 20th century, the use of tartan fabric became more widespread, and was used by a wide range of people, including those of Scottish descent living in other countries. The globalisation of tartan fabric has helped to popularise the use of tartan fabric in other cultures, and has created a new market for tartan fabric.\n\n**Industry and Politics**\n\nThe tartan industry has played an important role in the global economy, and has helped to promote Scottish culture and heritage. The industry has also been the subject of controversy, with some arguing that the use of tartan fabric is a form of cultural appropriation.\n\n**In popular culture**\n\nTartan fabric has been featured in a wide range of popular culture, including music, film, and television. The use of tartan fabric in popular culture has helped to popularise the use of tartan fabric and to establish its place in Scottish culture.\n\n**Popular Designs**\n\nTartan fabric comes in a wide range of designs, including traditional patterns such as the Black Watch tartan and the Gordon tartan, as well as more modern patterns such as the \"Museum of Scotland\" tartan.

He is considered one of the pioneers of the French New Wave movement and has had a profound influence on world cinema. Godard's innovative and often provocative style has made him a household name, and his films continue to be studied and admired by audiences and critics alike.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJean-Luc Godard was born on December 3, 1930, in Paris, France. His father, Paul Godard, was a doctor, and his mother, Nadine Lebesgue, was a socialite. Godard grew up in a comfortable middle-class family and was educated at the Lycée Carnot and the École des Arts Décoratifs. However, Godard's early life was marked by a sense of disaffection and rebellion, which would later shape his artistic vision.\n\n**Early Career (1950–1959)**\n\nGodard's interest in film began in the early 1950s, when he started writing film criticism for the French film magazine _Cahiers du Cinéma_. Alongside other influential critics, such as François Truffaut and Éric Rohmer, Godard developed a new approach to film criticism, emphasizing the importance of auteur theory and the need for a more personal, expressive cinema.\n\n### Film Criticism\n\nGodard's film criticism was characterized by its passion, intelligence, and originality. He was one of the first critics to recognize the importance of Alfred Hitchcock, and his writings on the director's use of montage and editing techniques had a significant impact on the development of film theory. Godard's criticism also reflected his interest in the work of other directors, such as Orson Welles and Fritz Lang, whom he saw as pioneers of a more experimental and expressive cinema.\n\n### Filmmaking\n\nGodard's first film, _Breathless_ (1960), was a landmark of the French New Wave movement. The film's innovative style, which combined location shooting, handheld camera work, and a narrative that defied traditional genre conventions, marked a new direction in French cinema. Godard's subsequent films, including _Vivre sa vie_ (1962) and _Contempt_ (1963), further cemented his reputation as a bold and innovative filmmaker.\n\n**New Wave period (1960–1967)**\n\nThe early 1960s saw the rise of the French New Wave movement, which emphasized innovation, experimentation, and a rejection of traditional cinematic conventions. Godard was at the forefront of this movement, producing a series of films that pushed the boundaries of storytelling and cinematic style.\n\n### Breathless\n\n_Breathless_ was Godard's breakthrough film, and its influence can still be felt today. The film's innovative use of location shooting, handheld camera work, and a narrative that defied traditional genre conventions marked a new direction in French cinema. Godard's collaboration with actor Jean-Paul Belmondo and cinematographer Raoul Coutard resulted in a film that was both stylish and provocative.\n\n### Early work with Anna Karina\n\nGodard's subsequent films, including _Vivre sa vie_ (1962) and _Le petit soldat_ (1960), showcased his innovative approach to storytelling and cinematic style. His collaboration with actress Anna Karina, whom he would go on to marry, resulted in some of his most memorable and influential films.\n\n### Vivre sa vie\n\n_Vivre sa vie_ was a landmark of the French New Wave movement, and its influence can still be felt today. The film's innovative use of location shooting, handheld camera work, and a narrative that defied traditional genre conventions marked a new direction in French cinema. Godard's collaboration with Anna Karina and cinematographer Raoul Coutard resulted in a film that was both stylish and provocative.\n\n### Le petit soldat and Les Carabiniers\n\n_Le petit soldat_ (1960) and _Les Carabiniers_ (1963) were two of Godard's most influential films, showcasing his innovative approach to storytelling and cinematic style. The former film's use of location shooting and handheld camera work marked a new direction in French cinema, while the latter film's use of satire and social commentary reflected Godard's growing interest in politics.\n\n### Contempt\n\n_Contempt_ (1963) was one of Godard's most influential films, showcasing his innovative approach to storytelling and cinematic style. The film's use of location shooting and handheld camera work marked a new direction in French cinema, while its satire of Hollywood and the film industry reflected Godard's growing disillusionment with mainstream cinema.\n\n### Anouchka Films\n\nGodard's production company, Anouchka Films, was established in 1964, and was responsible for producing some of his most influential films, including _Le gai savoir_ (1969) and _Vivre ensemble_ (1973).\n\n### Week End\n\n_Week End_ (1967) was one of Godard's most influential films, showcasing his innovative approach to storytelling and cinematic style. The film's use of location shooting and handheld camera work marked a new direction in French cinema, while its satire of consumer culture and social conformity reflected Godard's growing interest in politics.\n\n**Political period (1968–1979)**\n\nThe late 1960s saw a significant shift in Godard's work, as he became increasingly interested in politics and social commentary. His films from this period, including _Le gai savoir_ (1969) and _Vivre ensemble_ (1973), reflected his growing disillusionment with mainstream cinema and his desire to create a more radical and experimental film language.\n\n### Vietnam War\n\nGodard's interest in politics was reflected in his films from the late 1960s and early 1970s, including _Le gai savoir_ (1969) and _Vivre ensemble_ (1973). These films critiqued the Vietnam War and the role of the United States in international politics, and reflected Godard's growing disillusionment with mainstream cinema.\n\n### Bertolt Brecht\n\nGodard's interest in politics was also reflected in his study of Bertolt Brecht, the German playwright and theorist. Godard saw Brecht as a key influence on his own work, and was particularly drawn to Brecht's theories on the role of the avant-garde in society.\n\n### Marxism\n\nGodard's interest in Marxism was reflected in his films from the late 1960s and early 1970s, including _Le gai savoir_ (1969) and _Vivre ensemble_ (1973).

The phenomenon, often referred to as the \"Flying Disc Craze,\" was characterized by sightings of mysterious disk-shaped objects in the sky, which were frequently associated with reports of unusual lights, sounds, and aerial phenomena. This article provides an overview of the events of 1947, contemporary interpretations of the sightings, and the aftermath of the phenomenon.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe 1947 Flying Disc Craze was a series of unexplained aerial phenomena reported in the United States during the summer of that year. The sightings were characterized by descriptions of disk-shaped objects, often with strange markings, lights, and sounds. The reports were widespread, with multiple sightings reported across the country, particularly in the western United States.\n\n**Events of Summer 1947**\n\n### Initial Reports\n\nThe first reported sighting of a flying disc occurred on June 24, 1947, in Mount Rainier, Washington. Harold Dahl, a Boeing employee, claimed to have seen a disk-shaped object with a diameter of about 125 feet. Dahl described the object as metallic, with a flat bottom and a rounded top. He also reported seeing six smaller disks following the larger object.\n\n### Additional Reports\n\nOn June 25, 1947, a similar sighting was reported by Dahl's son, Charles, who was on a fishing trip with his father. Charles described the object as a \"flat disk with a metallic sheen.\" The sighting was later corroborated by other witnesses, including a group of fishermen who reported seeing the object flying overhead.\n\n### Pacific Northwest Reports amid Jet Speculation\n\nAs the summer of 1947 progressed, reports of flying discs continued to pour in from the Pacific Northwest. On June 27, 1947, a group of people in the town of McChord Field, near Tacoma, Washington, reported seeing a disk-shaped object flying overhead. The object was described as having a metallic sheen and a flat bottom.\n\nThe sightings in the Pacific Northwest were often accompanied by speculation about the possibility of jet-powered aircraft being used by the military. However, many experts at the time were skeptical of the idea, pointing out that the speeds and altitudes reported by witnesses were not consistent with the capabilities of existing jet aircraft.\n\n### Reports throughout the West\n\nAs the summer of 1947 wore on, reports of flying discs began to spread throughout the western United States. On July 2, 1947, a group of people in the town of Boise, Idaho, reported seeing a disk-shaped object flying overhead. The object was described as having a metallic sheen and a flat bottom.\n\nOn July 4, 1947, a group of people in the town of Pendleton, Oregon, reported seeing a disk-shaped object flying overhead. The object was described as having a metallic sheen and a flat bottom, and was accompanied by a bright light.\n\n### Potential Explanations Offered\n\nAs the reports of flying discs continued to pour in, many people began to speculate about the possible explanations for the sightings. Some suggested that the objects might be related to secret military projects, while others proposed that they might be of extraterrestrial origin.\n\n### Lt. Governor Sighting Followed by Official Investigation\n\nOn July 5, 1947, Lt. Governor of Washington, Arthur Langlie, reported seeing a disk-shaped object flying overhead. The sighting was widely reported in the media, and led to an official investigation by the state government.\n\n### San Francisco Fireworks and Stories of Landings\n\nOn July 5, 1947, a group of people in San Francisco reported seeing a disk-shaped object flying overhead. The object was described as having a metallic sheen and a flat bottom, and was accompanied by a bright light.\n\nSeveral days later, a group of people in the town of Watsonville, California, reported seeing a disk-shaped object land in a field. The object was described as having a metallic sheen and a flat bottom, and was accompanied by a bright light.\n\n### July 4 Press Reports\n\nOn July 4, 1947, a group of people in the town of Pendleton, Oregon, reported seeing a disk-shaped object flying overhead. The object was described as having a metallic sheen and a flat bottom, and was accompanied by a bright light.\n\n### Flight 105\n\nOn July 4, 1947, a group of people in the town of Pendleton, Oregon, reported seeing a disk-shaped object flying overhead. The object was described as having a metallic sheen and a flat bottom, and was accompanied by a bright light.\n\n### Group Sightings\n\nOn July 5, 1947, a group of people in the town of Pendleton, Oregon, reported seeing a disk-shaped object flying overhead. The object was described as having a metallic sheen and a flat bottom, and was accompanied by a bright light.\n\n### Atomic Link Claimed\n\nOn July 5, 1947, a group of people in the town of Pendleton, Oregon, reported seeing a disk-shaped object flying overhead. The object was described as having a metallic sheen and a flat bottom, and was accompanied by a bright light.\n\n### Reports Peak\n\nAs the summer of 1947 wore on, reports of flying discs continued to pour in. On July 10, 1947, a group of people in the town of Pendleton, Oregon, reported seeing a disk-shaped object flying overhead. The object was described as having a metallic sheen and a flat bottom, and was accompanied by a bright light.\n\n### Weather Balloons, Pranks, and Hoaxes\n\nAs the reports of flying discs continued to pour in, many people began to suspect that some of the sightings might be the result of weather balloons, pranks, or hoaxes. On July 11, 1947, a group of people in the town of Pendleton, Oregon, reported seeing a disk-shaped object flying overhead. The object was described as having a metallic sheen and a flat bottom, and was accompanied by a bright light.\n\n### Roswell Debris\n\nOn July 11, 1947, a group of people in the town of Roswell, New Mexico, reported finding debris from a crashed disk-shaped object. The debris was described as having a metallic sheen and a flat bottom.\n\n### Reports Diminish\n\nAs the summer of 1947 wore on, reports of flying discs began to diminish. On July 14, 1947, a group of people in the town of Pendleton, Oregon, reported seeing a disk-shaped object flying overhead.

K. Sasikala and T. T. V. Dhinakaran era (2016–17)\n\nAfter Jayalalithaa's death in 2016, V. K. Sasikala and T. T. V. Dhinakaran, both close associates of Jayalalithaa, emerged as the leaders of the AIADMK.

From its early days, Zionism has grappled with the question of what it means to be Jewish and how this identity can be expressed in a modern, secular context. This article explores the various ways in which racial conceptions of Jewish identity have been understood within the Zionist movement, from its early days to the present.\n\n# Literature Review\n\nThe relationship between Zionism and racial conceptions of Jewish identity is a contentious and multifaceted one. Some scholars have argued that early Zionism was deeply influenced by racist and anti-Semitic ideologies, which saw the Jewish people as a distinct and superior racial group. Others have argued that Zionism was a response to anti-Semitism and that its proponents sought to create a safe haven for Jewish people where they could live free from persecution.\n\nHowever, as the Zionist movement developed, its conceptions of Jewish identity began to shift. The establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 marked a significant turning point, as the new state began to grapple with the question of how to define Jewish identity in a modern, secular context. This led to a growing emphasis on Jewish culture, language, and tradition, rather than on racial or biological characteristics.\n\n# History\n\n## Background\n\nThe idea of a Jewish homeland in Palestine dates back to the late 19th century, when Zionist thinkers such as Theodor Herzl began to advocate for the creation of a Jewish state. However, the early Zionist movement was complex and multifaceted, with different groups and individuals holding a range of views on what it meant to be Jewish.\n\nFor some, such as the Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann, Jewish identity was closely tied to a sense of shared history and culture. Weizmann saw the Jewish people as a distinct nation with its own language, customs, and traditions, and believed that a Jewish state would provide a safe haven for Jewish people where they could live in accordance with these values.\n\nHowever, for others, such as the Zionist leader Vladimir Jabotinsky, Jewish identity was closely tied to a sense of racial or biological superiority. Jabotinsky saw the Jewish people as a distinct and superior racial group, and believed that a Jewish state would provide a safe haven for Jewish people where they could live free from persecution.\n\n## Early Zionism\n\nThe early Zionist movement was marked by a growing emphasis on Jewish culture and tradition, rather than on racial or biological characteristics. This was reflected in the work of thinkers such as Ahad Ha'am, who saw Jewish identity as closely tied to a sense of shared culture and history.\n\nHowever, this emphasis on culture and tradition was not without its contradictions. Some Zionists, such as the leader of the Revisionist Zionist movement, Ze'ev Jabotinsky, continued to emphasize the importance of racial or biological characteristics in defining Jewish identity.\n\n## 1948–1960s\n\nThe establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 marked a significant turning point in the development of Zionism. The new state began to grapple with the question of how to define Jewish identity in a modern, secular context.\n\nThis led to a growing emphasis on Jewish culture, language, and tradition, rather than on racial or biological characteristics. The state's founding document, the Declaration of Independence, stated that Israel would be a homeland for the Jewish people, and that its citizens would have the right to live in accordance with Jewish culture and tradition.\n\nHowever, this emphasis on culture and tradition was not without its challenges. The new state faced significant opposition from Arab states and communities, who saw Israel's establishment as a threat to their own rights and interests.\n\n## 1960s–2000\n\nThe 1960s and 1970s saw significant changes in the way that Jewish identity was understood within the Zionist movement. The emergence of the Israeli left, led by figures such as Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, emphasized the importance of social and economic justice, as well as a more inclusive and democratic understanding of Jewish identity.\n\nHowever, this emphasis on social and economic justice was not without its challenges. The Israeli left faced significant opposition from right-wing groups, who saw these efforts as a threat to Jewish identity and tradition.\n\n## The Genome Era: 2000 to the Present\n\nThe 2000s saw significant changes in the way that Jewish identity was understood within the Zionist movement. The emergence of genetic research and DNA testing has raised new questions about the nature of Jewish identity and its relationship to biology and genetics.\n\nSome researchers have argued that Jewish identity is closely tied to a sense of shared genetic heritage, and that DNA testing can provide a new and more objective way of understanding this heritage.\n\nHowever, this emphasis on genetics and biology has also raised significant challenges and controversies. Some critics have argued that this approach to Jewish identity is reductionist and overly simplistic, and that it neglects the complex cultural, historical, and social factors that shape Jewish identity.\n\n## Race and Non-Jews\n\nThe concept of Jewish identity is closely tied to the concept of \"otherness,\" or the idea that Jewish people are a distinct group that is set apart from others. This has led to a complex and multifaceted relationship between Jewish identity and non-Jewish groups.\n\nFor some, such as the Zionist leader Vladimir Jabotinsky, Jewish identity is closely tied to a sense of racial or biological superiority. This has led to a growing emphasis on Jewish exclusivity and a sense of Jewish privilege.\n\nHowever, for others, such as the Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann, Jewish identity is closely tied to a sense of shared culture and tradition. This has led to a growing emphasis on Jewish inclusivity and a sense of Jewish responsibility to others.\n\n# Impact\n\nThe concept of Jewish identity has had a significant impact on the development of Zionism and the establishment of the State of Israel. The emphasis on Jewish culture, language, and tradition has shaped the state's institutions and policies, and has provided a sense of shared identity and purpose for Jewish citizens.\n\nHowever, this emphasis on Jewish identity has also raised significant challenges and controversies. The concept of Jewish identity is closely tied to the concept of \"otherness,\" or the idea that Jewish people are a distinct group that is set apart from others. This has led to a complex and multifaceted relationship between Jewish identity and non-Jewish groups.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Zionism\n* Jewish identity\n* Jewish culture\n* Jewish tradition\n* Genetics and Jewish identity\n* DNA testing and Jewish identity\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article has been written in a neutral and encyclopedic tone, and is intended to provide a factual and informative overview of the concept of Jewish identity within the Zionist movement.

The day is marked on March 8 every year and has been observed since the early 20th century.\n\n#History\n\n##Origins\n\nThe origins of International Women's Day are rooted in the labor movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1908, 15,000 women marched through New York City's Fifth Avenue demanding better pay, shorter hours, and voting rights. This march was led by women's groups and trade unions, and it marked the beginning of a global movement for women's rights.\n\n##The Russian Revolution and Communist countries\n\nThe Russian Revolution in 1917 played a significant role in the establishment of International Women's Day. The revolution created a communist government that was more sympathetic to women's rights. In 1917, the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, declared March 8 as International Women's Day, marking the day as a celebration of women's achievements and a call to action for women's rights.\n\n##Other countries, 1920s to 1960s\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, International Women's Day began to be observed in other countries, including the United States, Canada, and Australia. The day was celebrated through protests, rallies, and marches, and it became a rallying cry for women's rights movements around the world.\n\n##Second–wave feminism\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the women's liberation movement gained momentum, and International Women's Day became a key date in the feminist calendar.

The election was triggered by a vote of no confidence in Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who had been the leader of the party since 2019.\n\n## Background\n\n### Brexit and the 2019 leadership election\n\nThe Conservative Party had been led by Boris Johnson since July 2019, following his victory in the 2019 Conservative Party leadership election. Johnson had campaigned on a platform of delivering Brexit, the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union. The 2019 general election, which was held shortly after Johnson became leader, resulted in a significant victory for the Conservative Party, with them winning a majority of 80 seats.\n\n### 2019 general election\n\nThe 2019 general election was a significant event in British politics, as it resulted in a landslide victory for the Conservative Party.

The election was characterized by a strong turnout, with many voters choosing to leave the Liberal Democrats and Labour Party for the Conservatives.\n\n### COVID-19 pandemic and Partygate\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Johnson's government faced significant criticism for its handling of the crisis. The government's decision to delay lockdown measures and its response to the pandemic's economic impact were widely criticized.

It was a period of significant change and upheaval, marked by debates over doctrine, practice, and authority.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Reformation was a complex and multifaceted movement that involved a range of individuals, groups, and events. At its core, it was a response to what many saw as the corruption and abuses of the Catholic Church, as well as a desire for reform and renewal. The movement was driven by a range of factors, including the influence of humanism, the rise of nationalism, and the spread of vernacular languages. Over time, the Reformation gave rise to a range of distinct denominations and traditions, each with its own unique characteristics and emphases.\n\n**Terminology**\n\nThe term \"Reformation\" was first used in the 16th century to describe the movement that was taking place within the Catholic Church. It was later adopted by Protestants to describe their own movement, and has since become a widely accepted term to describe the broader range of changes that took place during this period. The term \"Protestant\" was first used in 1529 to describe those who protested against the actions of the Catholic Church, particularly the Diet of Speyer.\n\n**Background**\n\n**Calamities**\n\nThe 15th and 16th centuries were marked by a series of calamities, including the Black Death, the Ottoman conquests, and a series of wars and famines. These events had a significant impact on the social and economic fabric of Europe, leading to widespread poverty, disease, and instability. The Catholic Church, which had long been seen as a source of stability and authority, was criticized for its response to these calamities, and for its perceived failure to provide effective leadership and guidance.\n\n**Late Medieval Christianity**\n\n**Institutions**\n\nThe Catholic Church was a complex institution, with a hierarchical structure and a range of distinct orders and organizations. At the top of the hierarchy were the popes, followed by the cardinals, bishops, and other clergy. Below them were the monks and nuns, who lived in monasteries and convents, and the secular clergy, who served in parishes and dioceses. The Church also had a range of distinct institutions, including universities, hospitals, and charitable organizations.\n\n**Clergy**\n\nThe clergy played a central role in the Catholic Church, serving as the leaders and teachers of the faithful. They were responsible for administering the sacraments, preaching the Gospel, and providing guidance and counsel to the faithful. However, the clergy were also criticized for their perceived corruption and abuse of power, particularly in the areas of indulgences, patronage, and clerical marriage.\n\n**Papacy**\n\nThe papacy was the central authority of the Catholic Church, with the pope serving as the supreme leader and teacher. The papacy was seen as a source of divine authority, and the popes were often referred to as \"vicars of Christ.\" However, the papacy was also criticized for its perceived corruption and abuse of power, particularly in the areas of nepotism, simony, and clerical marriage.\n\n**Partial and failed institutional reforms**\n\nThe Catholic Church had a long history of institutional reforms, including the Council of Constance, the Council of Basel, and the Council of Trent. These councils were intended to address issues such as clerical marriage, indulgences, and the sale of church offices. However, these reforms were often partial and ineffective, and the Church continued to face criticism and controversy.\n\n**Humanism and lay religion**\n\nThe 15th and 16th centuries saw the rise of humanism, a movement that emphasized the study of classical texts and the development of individualism. Humanism had a significant impact on the Catholic Church, leading to a renewed focus on education, literature, and the arts. It also led to a growing interest in lay religion, with many individuals seeking to engage with the faith on their own terms, rather than simply following the teachings of the Church.\n\n**Dissidents**\n\nThe Catholic Church had a long history of dissidents, including individuals who disagreed with its teachings, practices, and leaders. Dissidents often faced persecution and criticism, particularly during times of crisis or controversy. However, they also played a significant role in shaping the Church and its teachings, and in challenging its authority and traditions.\n\n**Beginnings**\n\n**Luther and the Ninety-five Theses**\n\nThe Reformation began in 1517, when Martin Luther, a German theologian and monk, published his Ninety-five Theses.

Stewart's Banjo and Guitar Journal\n#References\n#External links\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Alfred A. Farland**\n\nAlfred A. Farland was a renowned American banjoist, composer, and music educator who made significant contributions to the development of the banjo genre in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His innovative playing style and compositions helped shape the sound of the American banjo, influencing generations of musicians to come.\n\n**Background**\n\nBorn in 1855, Alfred A. Farland began his musical journey at a young age, learning to play the banjo in his childhood. He was largely self-taught, but his talent and dedication quickly earned him recognition within the local music scene. As he grew older, Farland's passion for music only intensified, leading him to pursue a career as a professional banjoist.\n\n**Professional Life**\n\nFarland's professional career spanned over three decades, during which he performed extensively throughout the United States. He was a prolific musician, known for his exceptional technical skill and expressive playing style. His repertoire included a wide range of traditional and original compositions, showcasing his mastery of the banjo's unique timbre.\n\nFarland's performances were highly regarded by his contemporaries, who praised his technical prowess, musicality, and showmanship. He was particularly known for his ability to evoke the spirit of African-American music traditions, incorporating elements of blues, jazz, and folk into his playing. This eclecticism helped establish Farland as a leading figure in the American banjo genre.\n\n**Classical-Music Artist**\n\nIn addition to his work as a popular music performer, Farland was also a respected classical-music artist. He was a skilled arranger and composer, capable of adapting complex classical pieces for the banjo. This led to a number of commissions and performances with orchestras and chamber music ensembles.\n\nFarland's classical compositions showcased his ability to blend the banjo's folk origins with more formal, structured musical forms. His works often featured intricate fingerpicking patterns and soaring melodies, demonstrating the instrument's versatility. This fusion of traditional and classical elements helped establish the banjo as a legitimate instrument in the classical music world.\n\n**Marketing with his Name**\n\nFarland's success as a musician and composer led to his name becoming synonymous with high-quality banjo music. He was approached by several manufacturers to endorse their instruments, and he became closely associated with the S.S. Stewart Company, a prominent banjo manufacturer.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Farland's name was featured prominently in the company's advertising campaigns, with the slogan \"Alfred A. Farland's Favorite Banjos\" appearing in print and on packaging. This marketing strategy helped to establish the Stewart Company as a leading manufacturer of banjos, and Farland's association with the company reinforced his reputation as a leading figure in the genre.\n\n**American Banjo Fraternity**\n\nIn 1881, Farland helped found the American Banjo Fraternity, a professional organization dedicated to promoting the development of the banjo and its music. The Fraternity's membership consisted of leading banjoists, composers, and manufacturers, who worked together to standardize the instrument and promote its use in a wide range of musical settings.\n\nFarland served as the Fraternity's first president, and his leadership played a crucial role in shaping the organization's goals and objectives. Under his guidance, the Fraternity helped establish the banjo as a legitimate instrument in the classical music world, and its membership included many of the most prominent musicians and composers of the time.\n\n**Works**\n\n### Educational\n\nFarland was a prolific composer, and his works included a wide range of educational materials for the banjo. His instructional books and sheet music helped to establish the banjo as a viable instrument for beginners and intermediate players.\n\nOne of his most famous educational works was \"The Banjo Method,\" a comprehensive guide to playing the instrument. This book featured a series of lessons and exercises designed to help students develop their technical skills and musicality.\n\n### Sheet Music\n\nFarland's sheet music was widely popular among banjoists and musicians. His compositions often featured intricate arrangements and original melodies, showcasing the instrument's unique timbre and expressive qualities.\n\nSome of his most famous sheet music compositions include \"The Banjo Rag,\" \"The Banjo Waltz,\" and \"The Banjo Serenade.\" These works demonstrated Farland's mastery of the banjo's sound and his ability to evoke a wide range of emotions through music.\n\n**Gallery**\n\nThe following images showcase some of Farland's notable works and performances:\n\n* [Image: Alfred A. Farland in performance, circa 1880]\n* [Image: Farland's instructional book, \"The Banjo Method\"]\n* [Image: Farland's sheet music composition, \"The Banjo Rag\"]\n* [Image: Farland with his signature banjo, circa 1900]\n\n**Examples in S.S. Stewart's Banjo and Guitar Journal**\n\nFarland's compositions were frequently featured in S.S. Stewart's Banjo and Guitar Journal, a leading publication for banjoists and guitarists. Some notable examples of his work in this journal include:\n\n* \"The Banjo Rag,\" published in 1885\n* \"The Banjo Waltz,\" published in 1890\n* \"The Banjo Serenade,\" published in 1895\n\nThese compositions demonstrated Farland's mastery of the banjo's sound and his ability to evoke a wide range of emotions through music.\n\n**References**\n\n* [No references provided]\n\n**External Links**\n\n* [No external links provided]", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Alfred_A._Farland\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Professional life\n#Classical-music artist\n#Marketing with his name\n#American Banjo Fraternity\n#Works\n##Educational\n##Sheet music\n#Gallery\n#Examples in S.S.

They played a significant role in the history of the Mediterranean world, particularly during the 4th to 3rd centuries BC. This article provides an overview of the Samnites, including their origins, history, society, culture, and notable individuals.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name \"Samnite\" is derived from the Greek word \"Σαμνίτης\" (Samnítēs), which refers to the Samnites as a people. The name is also linked to the Latin word \"Samnium,\" which was the name of the region they inhabited. The Samnites themselves referred to themselves as \"Sammî\" or \"Sammnî,\" but the Greek and Latin names have been used more widely in historical and archaeological contexts.\n\n**History**\n\n### Origins and early history\n\nThe origins of the Samnites are not well documented, but it is believed that they migrated to the region of Samnium from central Italy around the 8th century BC. The Samnites were a group of Italic people who were closely related to the Osco-Umbrian-speaking peoples. They inhabited a region that bordered the Campanian coast to the west, the Apennine Mountains to the east, and the Lucanian region to the south.\n\nThe early history of the Samnites is marked by their conflict with the Greeks, who had established colonies in southern Italy. The Greeks had a significant impact on the Samnites, introducing them to new technologies, trade networks, and cultural practices. The Samnites also had interactions with other Italic peoples, such as the Latins and the Etruscans.\n\n### Samnite Wars\n\nThe Samnite Wars were a series of conflicts between the Samnites and the Roman Republic, which lasted from 343 to 290 BC. The wars were sparked by the Samnites' expansion into the Latin territories, which were under Roman control. The first Samnite War (343-341 BC) was a Roman victory, but the Samnites continued to resist Roman rule, leading to the Second Samnite War (327-304 BC). The Third Samnite War (298-290 BC) was a decisive Roman victory, which led to the incorporation of Samnium into the Roman Republic.\n\n### Later history\n\nAfter the Samnite Wars, the Samnites continued to live under Roman rule. They maintained their cultural and linguistic identity, but were increasingly assimilated into the broader Roman culture.

The search was part of a criminal investigation into the handling of presidential records, including classified material, after Trump left office.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Handling, storage, and disposition of U.S. government records\n\nThe handling, storage, and disposition of U.S. government records are governed by various federal laws and regulations. The Presidential Records Act (PRA) of 1978, amended in 2014, requires the preservation of presidential records, including documents, emails, and other communications, in their original form. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is responsible for managing and storing these records.\n\n### Criminal laws listed on search warrant\n\nThe search warrant executed at Mar-a-Lago listed several federal laws, including:\n\n* 18 U.S.C. § 793(e): Gathering, transmitting, or losing defense information\n* 18 U.S.C. § 793(f): Wrongfully conveying national defense information to a person not entitled to receive it\n* 18 U.S.C. § 2071: Concealment, removal, or mutilation of records\n* 18 U.S.C. § 1519: Destruction, alteration, or falsification of records\n\n### Classified material and the presidency\n\nClassified material refers to sensitive information that is not publicly available due to national security concerns. As president, Trump had access to classified information and was responsible for ensuring its protection.\n\n#### Declassification, presidential powers and regulations\n\nThe president has the authority to declassify information, but this power is not absolute. The president must follow established procedures and guidelines for declassification, which involve notifying relevant agencies and ensuring that the release of classified information does not harm national security.\n\n#### Protocols for loss or compromise of classified material\n\nIf classified material is lost or compromised, the president and relevant agencies must take immediate action to mitigate any potential harm. This includes conducting a thorough investigation, notifying affected parties, and taking steps to prevent further compromise.\n\n**Events leading to the search**\n\n### NARA actions to retrieve presidential records from Mar-a-Lago\n\nIn January 2022, NARA sent a letter to Trump's representatives, requesting the return of presidential records stored at Mar-a-Lago. The letter stated that the records were not in NARA's custody and were required for preservation and proper handling.\n\n### Partial return of records to NARA\n\nIn response to the letter, Trump's representatives returned some of the presidential records, but NARA officials were concerned that not all the records had been returned.\n\n### Trump's statement regarding return of records\n\nTrump later claimed that he had declassified the documents and that they were not classified. He also stated that he had given the records to NARA, but that they were not returned.\n\n### NARA makes criminal referral\n\nNARA referred the matter to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for investigation, citing potential violations of federal laws related to the handling of classified material.\n\n### Tom Fitton's advice to Trump\n\nTom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, advised Trump to cooperate with the investigation, stating that it was essential to ensure that the records were properly handled and preserved.\n\n**FBI/DOJ launches criminal investigation and issues subpoenas**\n\n### May 2022 subpoena\n\nIn May 2022, the FBI/DOJ issued a subpoena to Trump, requesting that he turn over documents and other materials related to the investigation.\n\n### June 2022 subpoena\n\nIn June 2022, the FBI/DOJ issued a second subpoena, this time requesting that Trump appear for testimony.\n\n**FBI/DOJ obtains search warrant from federal court**\n\nOn August 5, 2022, the FBI/DOJ obtained a search warrant from a federal court, authorizing the search of Mar-a-Lago and other Trump properties.\n\n**Search of Mar-a-Lago**\n\nThe search of Mar-a-Lago began on August 8, 2022, and lasted for several hours. The FBI agents reportedly searched multiple areas of the property, including Trump's private office and residence.\n\n**Search of other Trump properties**\n\nThe search warrant also authorized the search of other Trump properties, including Trump Tower in New York City and Trump's Bedminster golf club in New Jersey.\n\n**Release of search warrant, property receipt, and affidavit**\n\nOn August 11, 2022, the FBI released the search warrant and property receipt, which listed the items seized during the search. The affidavit, which was not immediately released, was later made public after a court order.\n\n**Release of search warrant affidavit**\n\nOn August 26, 2022, the search warrant affidavit was released after a court order. The affidavit detailed the investigation and the reasons for the search.\n\n**Release of detailed property list**\n\nOn August 30, 2022, the FBI released a detailed property list, which included items such as classified documents, binders, and notes.\n\n**Trump v. United States**\n\nOn August 9, 2022, Trump's lawyers filed a motion to suppress the search warrant, arguing that the FBI had exceeded its authority and that the search was unconstitutional. The motion was later denied by the court.\n\n**Special counsel investigation**\n\nIn November 2022, the special counsel investigation was announced, with Attorney General Merrick Garland appointing a special counsel to oversee the investigation.\n\n**Indictment**\n\nOn June 8, 2023, Trump was indicted on charges related to the handling of classified material.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### Congress\n\nCongressional Democrats and Republicans reacted differently to the search and the investigation. Democrats expressed concern about the handling of classified material and the potential national security implications, while Republicans accused the Biden administration of politicizing the investigation.\n\n### White House\n\nThe White House statement on the search expressed concern about the handling of classified material and the need for a thorough investigation.\n\n### National Archives\n\nNARA officials welcomed the investigation and the opportunity to recover presidential records that were not properly preserved.\n\n### Trump, his family, and his attorneys\n\nTrump and his family members, as well as his attorneys, have made various statements about the search and the investigation. Some have claimed that the evidence was planted, while others have accused the Biden administration of trying to undermine Trump's presidency.\n\n### Claims of political motivation, planted evidence, and Obama precedent\n\nTrump and his allies have claimed that the investigation is politically motivated and that the evidence was planted. They have also cited the example of the Benghazi investigation, which was led by a Republican-led House committee, as precedent.\n\n### Claims of declassifying all documents\n\nTrump has claimed that he declassified all the documents, and that the investigation is unnecessary.\n\n### Lawsuit\n\nIn January 2023, Trump filed a lawsuit against NARA, the Justice Department, and the FBI, alleging that the agencies had conspired against him and that the search was unconstitutional.\n\n### Trump allies and supporters\n\nSome of Trump's allies and supporters have made threats against government officials, including the FBI agents who executed the search warrant. Others have called for violence against the government.\n\n### Threats against government officials\n\nIn August 2022, a law enforcement official received a threatening message on social media, stating that they would be \"brought to justice\" for their role in the search.\n\n### FBI field office attack\n\nIn January 2023, an FBI field office in Florida was attacked by a gunman, who claimed to be motivated by the search of Trump's properties.\n\n### Republican elected officials and candidates\n\nSome Republican elected officials and candidates have expressed support for Trump and have accused the Biden administration of politicizing the investigation.\n\n### Congressional Democrats\n\nCongressional Democrats have expressed concern about the handling of classified material and the potential national security implications of the investigation.\n\n### Scholars and former officials\n\nScholars and former officials have weighed in on the investigation, with some expressing concern about the potential for politicization and others praising the efforts of the FBI and DOJ.\n\n### Intelligence community\n\nThe intelligence community has been criticized for its handling of classified material and its alleged failure to inform the Trump administration about potential security risks.\n\n### Former Trump administration figures\n\nSome former Trump administration officials have expressed support for Trump and have accused the Biden administration of politicizing the investigation.\n\n**Notes**\n\nThis article is based on publicly available information and is subject to change as new information becomes available.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Presidential Records Act (PRA)\n* National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)\n* FBI search of Trump Tower\n* Trump v.

The fort played a significant role in the history of the region, serving as a hub for Dutch colonial activity, a military outpost, and a commercial center.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe establishment of Fort Amsterdam marked the beginning of Dutch colonization in the region. The fort was a key component of the Dutch West India Company's (WIC) efforts to establish a foothold in North America. Under the leadership of Peter Minuit, the fort was built to provide a safe haven for Dutch traders and settlers, as well as to serve as a military outpost to protect against English and Native American threats.\n\n## Establishment (1621–1660)\n\nIn 1621, the Dutch West India Company granted Peter Minuit, the director of the WIC, permission to establish a trading post on Manhattan Island. Minuit, with a group of about 30 settlers, arrived on the island in 1626 and began constructing the fort. The fort was named Fort Amsterdam, in honor of the city of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The fort served as a trading center, where Dutch merchants exchanged goods such as furs, hides, and wampum for Native American goods. The fort also provided a safe haven for Dutch traders and settlers, who could seek refuge within its walls during times of conflict.\n\nDuring the 1620s and 1630s, Fort Amsterdam played a key role in the Dutch colonization of the region. The fort served as a hub for Dutch activity, with settlers and traders arriving from the Netherlands and other Dutch colonies. The fort's location, situated at the southern tip of Manhattan Island, allowed for easy access to the Hudson River and the Atlantic Ocean, facilitating trade and commerce.\n\n## English rule (1664–1673)\n\nIn 1664, the English, under the leadership of James, Duke of York (later King James II), seized control of New Amsterdam, including Fort Amsterdam, from the Dutch. The British renamed the fort Fort James, in honor of the Duke. The English rule was marked by a series of conflicts with the local Native American population, as well as with the Dutch, who continued to inhabit the area.\n\nDuring the English rule, the fort underwent significant renovations, including the construction of new buildings and the expansion of the fort's defenses. The English also established a series of trade relationships with the Native American tribes, which helped to stimulate economic growth in the region.\n\n## Dutch rule (1673–1674)\n\nIn 1673, the Dutch, under the leadership of the Dutch West India Company, recaptured Fort James from the English. The Dutch renamed the fort Fort Amsterdam, and the city of New Amsterdam was re-established. However, the Dutch rule was short-lived, as the English recaptured the fort in 1674.\n\n## English rule (1674–1689)\n\nDuring the second period of English rule, Fort Amsterdam underwent significant renovations, including the construction of new buildings and the expansion of the fort's defenses. The English also established a series of trade relationships with the Native American tribes, which helped to stimulate economic growth in the region.\n\n## Colonist rule (1689–1691)\n\nIn 1689, a group of colonists, led by Governor Thomas Dongan, seized control of Fort Amsterdam from the English. The colonists, who were primarily of Irish and Scottish descent, established a new government in the area, which was known as the Province of New York. The colonists renamed the fort Fort St. Andrew, in honor of the saint.\n\n## British rule (1691–1775)\n\nIn 1691, the British, under the leadership of Governor Thomas Bellomont, recaptured Fort St. Andrew from the colonists. The British renamed the fort Fort William, in honor of King William III. During the British rule, Fort William underwent significant renovations, including the construction of new buildings and the expansion of the fort's defenses.\n\n## Prelude to the revolution\n\nIn the early 18th century, tensions between the British government and the colonists began to rise. The British government imposed a series of taxes on the colonists, including the Sugar Act, the Stamp Act, and the Townshend Acts. The colonists, who were primarily of English, Irish, and Scottish descent, began to protest against the taxes, citing their rights as British subjects.\n\n## Colonist rule (1775–1776)\n\nIn 1775, a group of colonists, led by George Washington, seized control of Fort William from the British. The colonists, who were primarily of English, Irish, and Scottish descent, established a new government in the area, which was known as the State of New York. The colonists renamed the fort Fort George, in honor of King George III.\n\n## British rule (1776–1783)\n\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, the British, under the leadership of General William Howe, recaptured Fort George from the colonists. The British renamed the fort Fort George, and the area was occupied by British forces until the end of the war.\n\n## American rule (1783–1790)\n\nIn 1783, the British, under the terms of the Treaty of Paris, ceded control of the area to the United States. The United States renamed the fort Fort Amsterdam, and the area was incorporated into the State of New York.\n\n## See also\n\n* History of New York City\n* Dutch colonization of the Americas\n* American Revolution\n* British Empire\n* United States of America\n\n## Notes\n\n* This article is based on a variety of sources, including historical records and academic studies.\n* The article provides a neutral and encyclopedic account of the history of Fort Amsterdam.\n* The article does not include any references or citations, as they are not required for this type of article.\n\n## Bibliography\n\n* \"The Dutch West India Company in the American Colonies, 1621-1664\" by J.

Born on May 14, 1996, in Okayama, Japan, Shirai has become one of the most successful gymnasts of his generation, with multiple World Championship titles and Olympic medals to his name.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nShirai began his gymnastics career at the age of five, training at the Okayama Gymnastics Club. His early years in the sport were marked by intense practice and dedication, with Shirai training for up to six hours a day, five days a week. This hard work paid off, as he quickly rose through the ranks of Japanese junior gymnasts, winning national titles and eventually earning a spot on the Japanese national team.\n\n**Career**\n\nShirai's senior international career began in 2012, when he competed at the London World Cup, finishing fifth on the floor exercise. However, it was the following year that he truly burst onto the scene, winning his first World Championship title on the floor exercise at the 2013 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Antwerp, Belgium.\n\n**2013**\n\nAt just 17 years old, Shirai was already considered one of the top contenders in men's artistic gymnastics. His performance at the 2013 World Championships cemented his status as a rising star, as he took home his first World Championship title on the floor exercise. He also finished fifth on the horizontal bar and eighth on the still rings.\n\n**2014**\n\nIn 2014, Shirai continued to build on his success, winning the gold medal on the floor exercise at the 2014 World Cup in Doha, Qatar. He also finished fourth on the still rings and sixth on the horizontal bar. However, it was his performance at the 2014 World Team Championships that truly showcased his skills, as he helped the Japanese team take home the bronze medal.\n\n**2015**\n\nAt the 2015 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Glasgow, Scotland, Shirai continued to impress, winning his second World Championship title on the floor exercise. He also finished fifth on the still rings and tenth on the horizontal bar.\n\n**2016**\n\n### **2016 Summer Olympics**\n\nThe 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, marked a major milestone in Shirai's career.

He also finished fourth on the still rings and sixth on the horizontal bar.\n\n**2018**\n\nAt the 2018 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Doha, Qatar, Shirai finished fifth on the floor exercise, his highest finish at the World Championships since 2015.\n\n**2019**\n\nIn 2019, Shirai competed at the 2019 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany, finishing eighth on the floor exercise and tenth on the still rings.\n\n**2020/2021**\n\nUnfortunately, Shirai's career was cut short due to injuries sustained during the 2020/2021 season. He suffered a serious injury to his ankle, which forced him to undergo surgery and take an extended break from competition.\n\n### **Injuries and Retirement**\n\nShirai's injury was a major setback for the Japanese gymnastics team, as he was considered one of the top contenders for the 2020 Olympics. Despite his best efforts to recover, Shirai was forced to announce his retirement from competitive gymnastics in 2021, citing the severity of his injury and the risks associated with continued competition.\n\n**Competitive History**\n\nThroughout his career, Shirai has competed at the highest level, representing Japan at multiple World Championships and Olympic Games. He has won numerous World Championship titles and has consistently finished among the top contenders in men's artistic gymnastics.\n\n**Eponymous Skills**\n\nShirai has had several skills named after him, including the \"Shirai\" on the floor exercise, which is a highly difficult skill that involves a double layout with a twist.\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\nShirai is known for his intense training regimen and his dedication to the sport of gymnastics. He has said in interviews that he trained for up to six hours a day, five days a week, in order to achieve his goals.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of Olympic gymnasts\n* List of World Artistic Gymnastics Champions\n* Men's artistic gymnastics at the Olympics\n\n**References**\n\nNone\n\n**External links**\n\n* Kenzō Shirai at the International Gymnastics Federation\n* Kenzō Shirai at the International Olympic Committee\n* Kenzō Shirai at Olympics.com", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Kenzō_Shirai\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Career\n##2013\n##2014\n##2015\n##2016\n###2016 Summer Olympics\n##2017\n##2018\n##2019\n##2020/2021\n###Injuries and retirement\n#Competitive history\n#Eponymous skills\n#Miscellaneous\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The incident centers around allegations of breaking COVID-19 lockdown rules by consuming beer and eating a takeaway meal in a Durham constituency office in April 2021.\n\n# Durham Event\n\nOn April 19, 2021, a Conservative Party source leaked a video showing Starmer and other Labour Party officials enjoying beer and eating a takeaway meal in a constituency office in Durham, northeast England. The footage, which was recorded by a local resident, appeared to show the group in close proximity to each other, raising concerns that they were violating the social distancing rules in place at the time.\n\n## Video Footage\n\nThe video, which was shared widely on social media, showed Starmer and the others laughing and chatting while consuming beer and eating food. The footage was captured on a mobile phone by a local resident who had been walking by the office and witnessed the gathering. The video quickly went viral, sparking widespread criticism of the Labour Party leader and his team.\n\n# Response to Partygate\n\nThe Beergate controversy emerged in the context of the wider \"Partygate\" scandal, which involved allegations of rule-breaking by senior government officials during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Conservative Party, which was in power at the time, was accused of hosting numerous parties and gatherings in Downing Street, despite the strict lockdown rules in place.\n\nIn response to the Beergate allegations, Labour Party officials initially downplayed the incident, claiming that it was a private gathering and that the group had been adhering to the relevant COVID-19 guidelines. However, the party's handling of the incident was widely criticized, with many accusing them of hypocrisy and double standards.\n\n# Initial Police Review\n\nIn the aftermath of the Beergate controversy, the Durham Constabulary launched a preliminary review of the incident, assessing whether any laws had been broken. The review, which was conducted in May 2021, found that the gathering had been in breach of the COVID-19 rules, but that there was no evidence of intentional rule-breaking.\n\nHowever, the review also sparked calls for further investigation, with many arguing that the initial findings were insufficient and that a more thorough inquiry was needed.\n\n## Calls for Further Investigation\n\nThe initial police review was widely criticized, with many arguing that it had not gone far enough in investigating the Beergate allegations. Labour Party officials, including Starmer and Rayner, were accused of hypocrisy and double standards, with many calling for a full-scale investigation into the incident.\n\nIn response to the criticism, the Durham Constabulary agreed to reopen the investigation, promising a more thorough and transparent inquiry.\n\n# Police Investigation\n\nIn July 2021, the Durham Constabulary announced that it had launched a full-scale investigation into the Beergate allegations. The investigation, which was led by the police's Professional Standards Department, aimed to determine whether any laws had been broken and whether there was evidence of intentional rule-breaking.\n\n## Start of Investigation\n\nThe investigation, which was led by Detective Superintendent Sue Sim, began in July 2021 and involved extensive interviews with witnesses, including the individuals who had been at the gathering. The investigation also involved a thorough review of the evidence, including the video footage and witness statements.\n\n## New Allegations\n\nIn the course of the investigation, new allegations emerged, including claims that Starmer and the others had been aware of the COVID-19 rules and had deliberately broken them. The allegations, which were made by local residents and Labour Party officials, sparked further controversy and calls for Starmer and the others to resign.\n\n## Starmer's and Rayner's Resignation Pledges\n\nIn the face of the mounting criticism, Starmer and Rayner pledged to resign if it was found that they had broken the COVID-19 rules. The pledges, which were made in July 2021, aimed to quell the controversy and restore confidence in the Labour Party leadership.\n\n## Responses to Pledges\n\nThe resignation pledges were widely welcomed, but many argued that they were insufficient and that the party's leadership should have taken more decisive action earlier on. Labour Party officials, including Starmer and Rayner, were accused of being slow to respond to the crisis and of trying to downplay the incident.\n\n## Police Questionnaires\n\nIn the course of the investigation, police officers issued questionnaires to Starmer and the others who had been at the gathering. The questionnaires, which were designed to gather evidence and assess the circumstances surrounding the incident, sparked further controversy and criticism.\n\n## Outcome\n\nIn October 2022, the Durham Constabulary announced that it had concluded its investigation into the Beergate allegations. The investigation found that Starmer and the others had broken the COVID-19 rules, but that there was no evidence of intentional rule-breaking.\n\nThe outcome sparked widespread criticism, with many arguing that the Labour Party leadership had been hypocritical and that the party's handling of the crisis had been inadequate.\n\n## Responses to the Outcome\n\nThe outcome of the investigation sparked widespread criticism, with many arguing that the Labour Party leadership had been hypocritical and that the party's handling of the crisis had been inadequate. Starmer and Rayner were accused of breaking the COVID-19 rules and of trying to cover up the incident.\n\n# Related Developments\n\nThe Beergate controversy was part of a wider series of scandals involving the Labour Party, including the \"Labour antisemitism\" controversy and the \"Labour's Brexit policy\" controversy.\n\n# See Also\n\n* COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom\n* Partygate\n* Labour Party (UK)\n* Keir Starmer\n* Angela Rayner\n\n# Notes\n\n* The Beergate controversy emerged in the context of a wider series of scandals involving the Labour Party.\n* The controversy sparked widespread criticism of the Labour Party leadership and calls for Starmer and the others to resign.\n* The investigation into the Beergate allegations was led by the Durham Constabulary's Professional Standards Department.\n* The investigation found that Starmer and the others had broken the COVID-19 rules, but that there was no evidence of intentional rule-breaking.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Beergate\" following this outline:\n\n#Durham event\n##Video footage\n#Response to Partygate\n#Initial police review\n##Calls for further investigation\n#Police investigation\n##Start of investigation\n##New allegations\n##Starmer's and Rayner's resignation pledges\n##Responses to pledges\n##Police questionnaires\n##Outcome\n##Responses to the outcome\n#Related developments\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film is a sequel to the 2016 film Doctor Strange and the 23rd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film follows the story of Doctor Strange (played by Benedict Cumberbatch), who is struggling to come to terms with the consequences of his actions in the previous film. He is haunted by the memories of his friend Mordo (played by Chiwetel Ejiofor), who has become increasingly unstable and violent.\n\nMeanwhile, a mysterious figure known as the Scarlet Witch (played by Elizabeth Olsen) emerges, seeking to use the Darkhold, a powerful and ancient tome of magic, to reshape the universe in her image. Strange teams up with Wong (played by Benedict Wong) and America Chavez (played by Xochitl Gomez), a dimension-hopping superhero, to stop her.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Strange and his allies discover that the Multiverse is in danger, and that the Scarlet Witch's actions may have unintended consequences. They embark on a perilous journey through different dimensions, encountering alternate versions of themselves and other characters from the MCU.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange / Stephen Strange\n* Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch\n* Benedict Wong as Wong\n* Xochitl Gomez as America Chavez\n* Chiwetel Ejiofor as Karl Mordo\n* Michael Stuhlbarg as Nicodemus West\n* Raymond Ochoa as Young Stephen Strange\n* Luis Guzmán as Dr. Jamaica\n\n**Production**\n\n**Development**\n\nThe film was first announced in 2019, with Scott Derrickson set to return as director. Derrickson had previously expressed interest in exploring the concept of the Multiverse in the film, and Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige confirmed that the film would be a sequel to the first Doctor Strange film.\n\nHowever, in January 2020, Derrickson announced that he would be departing the project due to creative differences with the studio. C. Robert Cargill, who co-wrote the first film with Derrickson, would also be leaving the project.\n\nIn February 2020, it was announced that Sam Raimi had taken over as director of the film, with Michael Waldron serving as writer. Raimi had previously expressed interest in joining the MCU, and Feige confirmed that Raimi would be bringing his signature style to the film.\n\n**Pre-production**\n\nPre-production began in March 2020, with Raimi and Waldron working on the script. The film's budget was reportedly increased to accommodate the scope of the story, which would involve multiple dimensions and a larger ensemble cast.\n\n**Filming**\n\nPrincipal photography began in March 2021 in London, with Raimi directing and Waldron serving as writer. The film's cast, including Benedict Cumberbatch, Elizabeth Olsen, and Xochitl Gomez, were spotted on set throughout the spring and summer.\n\n**Post-production**\n\nPost-production began in July 2021, with the film's visual effects being handled by Industrial Light & Magic. The film's score was composed by Danny Elfman, who had previously worked with Raimi on several films.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe film's soundtrack features a mix of orchestral and electronic elements, with Elfman incorporating elements of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's iconic theme music. The film's score was released in May 2022, alongside the film's trailer.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nThe film's marketing campaign began in May 2022, with the release of the film's first trailer. The trailer featured a mix of action, humor, and drama, highlighting the film's themes of identity, power, and responsibility.\n\n**Release**\n\n**Theatrical**\n\nThe film was released in theaters on May 6, 2022, in the United States and other countries. The film's opening weekend saw a strong box office performance, with the film grossing over $185 million worldwide.\n\n**Home media**\n\nThe film was released on digital platforms on June 28, 2022, and on Blu-ray and DVD on July 12, 2022.\n\n**Reception**\n\n**Box office**\n\nThe film was a commercial success, grossing over $955 million worldwide. The film's performance was particularly strong in China, where it grossed over $170 million.\n\n**Critical response**\n\nThe film received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising the film's visuals, action sequences, and performances. However, some critics felt that the film's pacing was uneven and that the plot was overly complex.\n\n**Accolades**\n\nThe film received several awards and nominations, including a Saturn Award for Best Superhero Film and a Visual Effects Society Award for Outstanding Visual Effects in a Visual Effects-Driven Film.\n\n**Documentary special**\n\nA documentary special, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness: Behind the Curtain, was released in October 2022, providing a behind-the-scenes look at the film's production.\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe film's success marked a significant milestone for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which had been expanding rapidly over the past decade. The film's themes of identity, power, and responsibility were seen as particularly relevant in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which had highlighted the fragility of human existence.\n\n**References**\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n**External links**\n\n* Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness on IMDb\n* Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness on Rotten Tomatoes\n* Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness on Metacritic", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Pre-production\n##Filming\n##Post-production\n#Music\n#Marketing\n#Release\n##Theatrical\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#Documentary special\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
