The effects of climate change are multifaceted and vary from region to region, but they can be broadly categorized into changes in temperature, weather patterns, land use, oceans, ice and snow, wildlife and nature, tipping points, and human settlements.\n\n**Changes in Temperature**\n\nThe most apparent effect of climate change is the increase in global average temperature. Since the late 19th century, the Earth's temperature has risen by about 1°C, with the last decade being the warmest on record. This rise in temperature is primarily due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, which release large amounts of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, into the atmosphere.\n\n**Weather**\n\nChanges in temperature lead to changes in weather patterns, resulting in more frequent and severe heat waves, droughts, and extreme storms.\n\n### Heat waves and temperature extremes\n\nHeat waves are prolonged periods of abnormally hot weather, often resulting in heat-related illnesses and deaths. The 2003 European heat wave, for example, caused an estimated 70,000 deaths. Rising temperatures also lead to an increase in temperature extremes, such as record-breaking heat waves and cold snaps.\n\n### Rain\n\nChanges in temperature and precipitation patterns lead to more frequent and severe floods and droughts. Heavy rainfall events, such as those that occurred in the 2010 Pakistan floods, can cause widespread destruction and displacement.\n\n### Extreme storms\n\nRising sea levels and warmer ocean temperatures lead to more frequent and intense tropical cyclones, such as hurricanes and typhoons. The 2013 Typhoon Haiyan, for example, caused widespread destruction and loss of life in the Philippines.\n\n**Land**\n\nChanges in temperature and precipitation patterns also affect land use, leading to more frequent and severe floods, droughts, and wildfires.\n\n### Floods\n\nFloods are one of the most common and devastating natural disasters, causing widespread destruction and displacement. The 2011 Thailand floods, for example, caused an estimated $45 billion in damages.\n\n### Droughts\n\nDroughts, on the other hand, can have devastating effects on agriculture and ecosystems, leading to crop failures and water shortages. The 2012 United States drought, for example, caused an estimated $30 billion in damages.\n\n### Wildfires\n\nChanges in temperature and precipitation patterns lead to an increase in wildfires, particularly in areas with dry fuel loads. The 2019-2020 Australian bushfires, for example, caused widespread destruction and loss of life.\n\n**Oceans**\n\nChanges in temperature and ocean currents also affect the world's oceans, leading to sea level rise, ocean acidification, and changes in marine ecosystems.\n\n### Sea level rise\n\nSea level rise is a direct consequence of melting glaciers and ice sheets, as well as the thermal expansion of seawater. The 2019 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that sea levels will rise by up to 1 meter by 2100.\n\n**Ice and Snow**\n\nChanges in temperature and precipitation patterns also affect ice and snow cover, leading to a decline in glacier and ice sheet mass, as well as changes in sea ice coverage.\n\n### Glaciers decline\n\nGlacier decline is a significant consequence of climate change, with many glaciers around the world shrinking at an alarming rate. The 2019 report by the IPCC estimates that glaciers will lose up to 85% of their mass by 2100.\n\n### Ice sheets decline\n\nIce sheet decline is also a pressing concern, with the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets showing signs of rapid melting. The 2019 report by the IPCC estimates that the Antarctic ice sheet will lose up to 10% of its mass by 2100.\n\n### Sea ice decline\n\nSea ice decline is a significant consequence of climate change, with the Arctic ice cap shrinking at an alarming rate. The 2019 report by the IPCC estimates that the Arctic ice cap will disappear by 2050.\n\n### Permafrost thawing\n\nPermafrost thawing is also a pressing concern, with the potential to release large amounts of methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\n\n**Wildlife and Nature**\n\nChanges in temperature and precipitation patterns also affect wildlife and nature, leading to changes in ecosystems, biodiversity loss, and extinctions.\n\n### Ecosystems on land\n\nEcosystems on land are vulnerable to changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, leading to changes in species composition, population dynamics, and ecosystem function. The 2019 report by the IPCC estimates that up to 30% of species will face extinction by 2100.\n\n### Marine ecosystems\n\nMarine ecosystems are also vulnerable to changes in temperature and ocean chemistry, leading to changes in species composition, population dynamics, and ecosystem function. The 2019 report by the IPCC estimates that up to 40% of marine species will face extinction by 2100.\n\n**Tipping points and irreversible impacts**\n\nClimate change can lead to tipping points, where small changes have large and irreversible consequences. The melting of glaciers and ice sheets, for example, can lead to sea level rise, while the collapse of coral reefs can lead to the loss of marine biodiversity.\n\n**Health, Food Security, and Water Security**\n\nChanges in temperature and precipitation patterns also affect human health, food security, and water security.\n\n### Health\n\nClimate change can lead to an increase in heat-related illnesses, respiratory problems, and waterborne diseases. The 2019 report by the IPCC estimates that climate change will lead to up to 250,000 deaths by 2050.\n\n### Food security\n\nClimate change can lead to crop failures, reduced yields, and changes in food availability, leading to food insecurity. The 2019 report by the IPCC estimates that climate change will lead to up to 500 million people facing food insecurity by 2050.\n\n### Water security\n\nClimate change can lead to changes in water availability, quality, and access, leading to water insecurity. The 2019 report by the IPCC estimates that climate change will lead to up to 2 billion people facing water insecurity by 2050.\n\n**Human Settlements**\n\nChanges in temperature and precipitation patterns also affect human settlements, leading to displacement, migration, and social and economic impacts.\n\n### Impacts from heat\n\nHeat-related illnesses and deaths can occur in urban areas, particularly in areas with poor infrastructure and limited access to cooling. The 2019 report by the IPCC estimates that climate change will lead to up to 150,000 heat-related deaths by 2050.\n\n### Low-lying coastal regions\n\nLow-lying coastal regions are vulnerable to sea level rise, flooding, and storm surges, leading to displacement and migration. The 2019 report by the IPCC estimates that up to 143 million people will be displaced by 2050.\n\n**Impacts on Societies**\n\nChanges in temperature and precipitation patterns also affect societies, leading to displacement, migration, conflict, and social impacts on vulnerable groups.\n\n### Displacement and migration\n\nClimate change can lead to displacement and migration, particularly in areas with limited resources and infrastructure. The 2019 report by the IPCC estimates that up to 143 million people will be displaced by 2050.\n\n### Conflict\n\nClimate change can lead to conflict over resources, particularly in areas with limited resources and infrastructure. The 2019 report by the IPCC estimates that climate change will lead to up to 20% increase in conflict by 2050.\n\n### Social impacts on vulnerable groups\n\nClimate change can have disproportionate impacts on vulnerable groups, including the poor, women, and children. The 2019 report by the IPCC estimates that climate change will lead to up to 50% increase in poverty by 2050.\n\n### Possibility of societal collapse\n\nClimate change can lead to societal collapse, particularly in areas with limited resources and infrastructure. The 2019 report by the IPCC estimates that climate change will lead to up to 10% increase in societal collapse by 2050.\n\n**Economic Impacts**\n\nChanges in temperature and precipitation patterns also affect the economy, leading to economic inequality, and impacts on highly affected sectors.\n\n### Economic inequality\n\nClimate change can lead to economic inequality, particularly in areas with limited resources and infrastructure. The 2019 report by the IPCC estimates that climate change will lead to up to 50% increase in economic inequality by 2050.\n\n### Highly affected sectors\n\nClimate change can have significant impacts on highly affected sectors, including agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and tourism. The 2019 report by the IPCC estimates that climate change will lead to up to 30% decrease in GDP by 2050.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Climate crisis\n* Global warming\n* Greenhouse gases\n* Carbon footprint\n* Climate change mitigation\n* Climate change adaptation\n\n**References**\n\n* IPCC (2019).

The villa, where the majority of the story takes place, was built on a large estate in the Italian countryside. The production team also made use of various locations in Venice, including the famous St. Mark's Square and the Rialto Bridge. The film's sets were designed to reflect the era in which the story takes place, with a focus on opulent interiors and ornate furnishings.\n\n## Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Patrick Doyle, who has previously worked with Branagh on several projects. The score features a combination of orchestral and choral elements, with a focus on creating a sense of tension and foreboding.

She was the longest-reigning British monarch in history, serving for 70 years and 214 days.\n\nEarly life\n\nElizabeth was born at 17 Bruton Street, Mayfair, London, to Prince Albert, Duke of York (later King George VI), and his wife, Elizabeth, Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother). She was the first child of the couple and the second granddaughter of King George V. Elizabeth's early life was marked by the death of her grandfather, King George V, and the subsequent accession of her uncle, Edward VIII, to the throne. However, Edward's decision to abdicate in favor of Elizabeth's father led to the latter's accession as King George VI, and Elizabeth became the heir presumptive at the age of 10.\n\nHeir presumptive\n\nAs the daughter of the monarch, Elizabeth was second in line to the throne behind her father. However, this changed in 1936 when her uncle, Edward VIII, announced his intention to marry Wallis Simpson, an American divorcee. This led to a constitutional crisis, and Edward VIII eventually abdicated in favor of his brother, King George VI. Elizabeth thus became the heir apparent, and her father began to take steps to prepare her for her future role as monarch.\n\nSecond World War\n\nDuring the Second World War, Elizabeth's life was significantly impacted by the conflict. She and her sister, Princess Margaret, were evacuated to the countryside for their safety, while their parents remained in London to carry out their royal duties. Elizabeth's experiences during this period had a lasting impact on her, and she would later describe the war as a \"somber and serious\" time.\n\nMarriage\n\nOn 20 November 1947, Elizabeth married Philip Mountbatten, a naval officer of Greek and Danish descent. The couple had met in 1939, and Philip had been a keen supporter of Elizabeth during her time in the Royal Navy. The marriage was a happy one, and the couple had four children together: Charles, Anne, Andrew, and Edward.\n\nReign\n\nAccession and coronation\n\nOn 6 February 1952, King George VI died, and Elizabeth succeeded to the throne at the age of 25. She was crowned Queen Elizabeth II on 2 June 1953, in a ceremony held at Westminster Abbey. The coronation was a grand affair, with dignitaries from around the world in attendance.\n\nEarly reign\n\nElizabeth's early reign was marked by a period of significant change and modernization in the United Kingdom. She played a key role in promoting the decolonization of Africa and Asia, and her government worked to establish the United Kingdom as a major player on the world stage. Elizabeth also took steps to modernize the monarchy, introducing television broadcasts and other innovations to reach a wider audience.\n\nPolitical reforms and crises\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Elizabeth faced several significant challenges to her authority. The Suez Crisis of 1956 saw her government's military intervention in Egypt, which was widely criticized around the world. The crisis led to a significant decline in the popularity of the monarchy, and Elizabeth was forced to confront the reality of her role as a symbol of national unity.\n\nPerils and dissent\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Elizabeth faced a series of challenges to her authority, including the Troubles in Northern Ireland and the Falklands War. She also faced criticism for her decision to host the 1977 Silver Jubilee celebrations, which were seen as overly festive and extravagant.\n\nTurbulent years\n\nThe 1990s and early 2000s were marked by significant challenges to Elizabeth's authority, including the death of her sister, Princess Margaret, in 2002. The period was also marked by significant controversy over the royal family's finances, including the publication of the infamous \"Queen's Speech\" in which Elizabeth's private finances were laid bare.\n\nDawn of the new millennium\n\nIn the early 21st century, Elizabeth faced a new set of challenges as the United Kingdom entered the digital age. She took steps to modernize the monarchy, embracing new technologies and reaching out to a wider audience. The death of her husband, Prince Philip, in 2021 marked a significant turning point in her life, and Elizabeth was seen to be more vulnerable and frail in the months that followed.\n\nDiamond Jubilee and milestones\n\nIn 2012, Elizabeth celebrated her Diamond Jubilee, marking 60 years on the throne. The celebrations were a significant success, with events held around the world to mark the occasion. The Queen also marked other significant milestones, including the 2012 London Olympics and the 2015 Scottish independence referendum.\n\nPandemic and widowhood\n\nIn 2020, Elizabeth faced significant challenges as the COVID-19 pandemic swept the world. She took steps to reach out to her people, using the monarch's traditional Christmas broadcast to offer words of comfort and support. The Queen also faced the loss of her husband, Prince Philip, in 2021, marking a significant turning point in her life.\n\nPlatinum Jubilee and beyond\n\nIn 2022, Elizabeth celebrated her Platinum Jubilee, marking 70 years on the throne. The celebrations were a significant success, with events held around the world to mark the occasion. The Queen's reign had come to an end, but her legacy would live on for generations to come.\n\nDeath\n\nElizabeth II died on 8 September 2022, at the age of 96, at Balmoral Castle in Scotland. Her death marked the end of an era, and she was succeeded by her son, Charles, as King Charles III.\n\nLegacy\n\nElizabeth II's legacy is complex and multifaceted. She was a symbol of national unity and stability, and her reign saw significant changes and modernization in the United Kingdom. She also played a key role in promoting the decolonization of Africa and Asia, and her government worked to establish the United Kingdom as a major player on the world stage.\n\nBeliefs, activities, and interests\n\nElizabeth was a devout Christian and a strong supporter of the Church of England. She also had a deep love of animals, and her family's pets were often featured in the media. The Queen was also a keen supporter of the arts, and her patronage of the arts was seen as a significant factor in the development of British culture.\n\nMedia depiction and public opinion\n\nElizabeth was portrayed in numerous films and television shows, including the popular series \"The Crown.\" Her public image was often seen as a symbol of the monarchy, and her popularity waxed and waned over the years. However, her legacy as a symbol of national unity and stability remained strong, and she was widely respected and admired around the world.\n\nTitles, styles, honours, and arms\n\nElizabeth was known by several titles and styles during her reign, including:\n\n* Elizabeth Alexandra Mary (her birth name)\n* Her Royal Highness (HRH) Princess Elizabeth of York (her title as a princess)\n* Her Majesty (HM) Elizabeth II (her title as Queen)\n* Elizabeth R (her personal motto)\n\nArms\n\nElizabeth's personal arms featured a red lion rampant on a gold field, with a blue chief bearing three gold fleurs-de-lis. The arms were often used in heraldic contexts, including on official documents and in coats of arms.\n\nIssue\n\nElizabeth had four children with her husband, Prince Philip:\n\n* Charles, Prince of Wales (born 1948)\n* Anne, Princess Royal (born 1950)\n* Andrew, Duke of York (born 1960)\n* Edward, Earl of Wessex (born 1964)\n\nAncestry\n\nElizabeth's ancestry was complex and multifaceted, with her family tracing back to the Norman Conquest of England in 1066.

The scheme aims to provide a four-year career for selected candidates, who will be known as \"Agniveers,\" with the option to continue serving in the forces or return to civilian life after completion of their tenure.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Indian Armed Forces have been facing challenges in attracting and retaining personnel, particularly in the wake of recent conflicts and operational deployments. The forces have also been grappling with issues related to manpower management, including the aging profile of personnel and the increasing number of retirements. In response to these challenges, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) undertook a comprehensive review of the recruitment process and manpower management policies.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme is designed to provide a novel approach to recruitment and manpower management in the Indian Armed Forces. The scheme aims to create a more agile, flexible, and professional force structure, while also addressing issues related to manpower management. Under the scheme, candidates will be recruited for a period of four years, with the option to continue serving in the forces or return to civilian life after completion of their tenure.\n\nThe scheme has several key features, including:\n\n*   **Agniveers**: Candidates recruited under the scheme will be known as \"Agniveers.\"\n*   **Four-year tenure**: Agniveers will serve for a period of four years, with the option to continue serving in the forces or return to civilian life after completion of their tenure.\n*   **Training and deployment**: Agniveers will undergo rigorous training and deployment in various operational and non-operational roles.\n*   **Benefits and allowances**: Agniveers will be eligible for various benefits and allowances, including a monthly stipend, food and accommodation, and medical facilities.\n*   **Exit and re-enlistment**: Agniveers who choose to leave the forces after completion of their tenure will be eligible for re-enlistment, subject to certain conditions.\n\n**Reservation and welfare benefits**\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme provides for reservation and welfare benefits for Agniveers, similar to those available to regular personnel. The scheme includes provisions for:\n\n*   **Reservation for economically weaker sections**: Agniveers from economically weaker sections will be eligible for reservation, subject to certain conditions.\n*   **Welfare benefits**: Agniveers will be eligible for various welfare benefits, including medical facilities, leave, and other allowances.\n*   **Education benefits**: Agniveers will be eligible for education benefits, including scholarships and leave for education.\n\n**Criticism**\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme has received criticism from various quarters, including political parties, activists, retired defence personnel, and state governments.\n\n### By political parties and activists\n\nThe scheme has been criticized by several political parties, including the Congress, the Trinamool Congress, and the Left parties. The criticism has centered on the perceived lack of transparency and consultation in the introduction of the scheme, as well as concerns related to the impact on manpower management and operational readiness.\n\n### By retired defence personnel\n\nRetired defence personnel have also expressed criticism of the scheme, citing concerns related to the potential impact on manpower management and operational readiness. Some have also expressed concerns about the potential for Agniveers to be used as a stop-gap measure to fill gaps in manpower, rather than as a long-term solution.\n\n### By state governments\n\nSeveral state governments have also expressed criticism of the scheme, citing concerns related to the potential impact on manpower management and operational readiness. Some have also expressed concerns about the potential for Agniveers to be used as a stop-gap measure to fill gaps in manpower, rather than as a long-term solution.\n\n### Data on employment of veterans\n\nData on the employment of veterans in the Indian Armed Forces is not comprehensive, and there is no publicly available data on the number of Agniveers employed in the forces. However, according to reports, the MoD has stated that the scheme aims to provide employment opportunities to a significant number of Agniveers.\n\n**Protests**\n\nThe introduction of the Agnipath Scheme has led to widespread protests across the country, with various groups and individuals expressing opposition to the scheme. The protests have centered on concerns related to the perceived lack of transparency and consultation in the introduction of the scheme, as well as concerns related to the impact on manpower management and operational readiness.\n\n### Bharat Bandh (All India Strike)\n\nThe protests have led to a nationwide strike, known as the Bharat Bandh, which is being observed by various groups and individuals across the country. The strike aims to draw attention to the concerns related to the scheme and to pressure the government to reconsider its implementation.\n\n### 21 June onwards\n\nThe protests have continued since 21 June, with various groups and individuals expressing opposition to the scheme. The protests have centered on concerns related to the perceived lack of transparency and consultation in the introduction of the scheme, as well as concerns related to the impact on manpower management and operational readiness.\n\n**Response by the Government**\n\nThe government has stated that the Agnipath Scheme is a necessary step to address the challenges facing the Indian Armed Forces. The government has also stated that the scheme aims to provide employment opportunities to a significant number of Agniveers and to create a more agile, flexible, and professional force structure.\n\n**Plea in the Supreme Court against the scheme**\n\nA petition has been filed in the Supreme Court challenging the validity of the Agnipath Scheme. The petition argues that the scheme is unconstitutional and that it violates the rights of Agniveers.\n\n**First Agniveer batch (2023)**\n\nThe first batch of Agniveers is expected to be recruited in 2023. The recruitment process is expected to begin in June 2023, with the first batch of Agniveers expected to join the forces in August 2023.\n\n### Hyderabad\n\nThe recruitment process for the first batch of Agniveers is expected to begin in Hyderabad, with a number of centers across the city being set up to facilitate the process.\n\n### Nashik\n\nThe recruitment process for the first batch of Agniveers is also expected to begin in Nashik, with a number of centers across the city being set up to facilitate the process.\n\n### Ranikhet\n\nThe recruitment process for the first batch of Agniveers is also expected to begin in Ranikhet, with a number of centers across the city being set up to facilitate the process.\n\n**Amendment in recruitment procedure**\n\nThe government has announced an amendment to the recruitment procedure for the Agnipath Scheme, with the aim of making the process more transparent and inclusive. The amendment includes provisions for greater representation of women and other marginalized groups in the forces.\n\n**See also**\n\n*   **Indian Armed Forces**\n*   **Recruitment in the Indian Armed Forces**\n*   **Military service in India**\n*   **Defence policy of India**\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any references.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Agnipath_Scheme\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Overview\n#Reservation and welfare benefits\n#Criticism\n##By political parties and activists\n##By retired defence personnel\n##By state governments\n##Data on employment of veterans\n#Protests\n##Bharat Bandh (All India Strike)\n##21 June onwards\n#Response by the Government\n#Plea in the Supreme Court against the scheme\n#First Agniveer batch (2023)\n##Hyderabad\n##Nashik\n##Ranikhet\n#Amendment in recruitment procedure\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Fenwick_tree", "content": "#Motivation\n#Description\n##The interrogation tree\n##The update tree\n##The search tree\n#Pseudocode\n##Construction\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Fenwick Tree\n\nThe Fenwick tree, also known as a binary indexed tree, is a data structure that allows for efficient calculation of cumulative prefix sums and range sums in an array. It is a tree-like data structure that is often used in algorithms for counting and searching in arrays.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe Fenwick tree was first introduced by Peter Fenwick in the 1990s as a way to efficiently calculate prefix sums in an array. Prior to the development of the Fenwick tree, algorithms for calculating prefix sums typically had a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the array. The Fenwick tree, on the other hand, allows for prefix sum calculation in O(log n) time.\n\nThe Fenwick tree is particularly useful in applications where prefix sums are needed frequently, such as in algorithms for counting and searching in arrays. It is also used in various other fields, including data compression, cryptography, and computer graphics.\n\n# Description\n\n## The Interrogation Tree\n\nThe interrogation tree is the core data structure of the Fenwick tree. It is a binary tree where each node represents a prefix sum of a subset of the original array. The tree is constructed by recursively dividing the array into two halves and calculating the prefix sum of each half.\n\nThe interrogation tree has two types of nodes: internal nodes and leaf nodes. Internal nodes represent the prefix sums of the subsets of the array, while leaf nodes represent the individual elements of the array.\n\n## The Update Tree\n\nThe update tree is a data structure that is used to keep track of the updates made to the Fenwick tree. It is a binary tree where each node represents an update made to the Fenwick tree. The update tree is constructed by recursively dividing the array into two halves and creating a new node for each update.\n\nThe update tree has two types of nodes: internal nodes and leaf nodes. Internal nodes represent the updates made to the subsets of the array, while leaf nodes represent the individual updates made to the array.\n\n## The Search Tree\n\nThe search tree is a data structure that is used to efficiently search for a specific element in the Fenwick tree. It is a binary tree where each node represents a search query made to the Fenwick tree. The search tree is constructed by recursively dividing the array into two halves and creating a new node for each search query.\n\nThe search tree has two types of nodes: internal nodes and leaf nodes. Internal nodes represent the search queries made to the subsets of the array, while leaf nodes represent the individual search queries made to the array.\n\n# Pseudocode\n\n## Construction\n\nThe following is a pseudocode for constructing a Fenwick tree from an array:\n\n```\n  Function ConstructFenwickTree(A):\n    n = Length(A)\n    Create an array C of size n+1\n    For i = 1 to n:\n      C[i] = A[i]\n      While i <= n:\n        C[i] += C[i-1]\n        i = i * 2\n    Return C\n```\n\nThe function ConstructFenwickTree takes an array A as input and returns a new array C that represents the Fenwick tree. The function first creates an array C of size n+1 and initializes it with the elements of A. Then, it iterates over the array C and calculates the prefix sum of each subset of A by adding the elements of the subset to the corresponding element in C.\n\n# See also\n\n* Binary Indexed Tree\n* Segment Tree\n* Range Tree\n* Prefix Sum\n* Range Sum\n\n# References\n\nThis article does not include any references.\n\n# External links\n\n* Fenwick Tree on Wikipedia\n* Fenwick Tree on GeeksforGeeks\n* Fenwick Tree on LeetCode", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Fenwick_tree\" following this outline:\n\n#Motivation\n#Description\n##The interrogation tree\n##The update tree\n##The search tree\n#Pseudocode\n##Construction\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film stars Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan, Jenny Slate, Harry Shum Jr., and Stephanie Hsu. It premiered at the South by Southwest film festival in March 2022 and was released in theaters in May 2022. The film has received widespread critical acclaim for its unique storytelling, visuals, and performances.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film follows the story of Evelyn Wang, a middle-aged Chinese-American woman who is struggling to balance her life. She is being audited by the IRS, her laundromat business is in financial trouble, and she is dealing with the pressure of her family's expectations. Evelyn's life is turned upside down when she is suddenly transported to different parallel universes, where she encounters alternate versions of herself and her family.\n\nAs Evelyn navigates through these different universes, she begins to realize that her existence is not limited to just one reality. She must confront her past mistakes and choices, and learn to appreciate the complexities of her life. Along the way, she discovers a new sense of purpose and meaning, and learns to love herself and her family.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Michelle Yeoh as Evelyn Wang\n* Ke Huy Quan as Waymond Wang\n* Jenny Slate as Jamie\n* Harry Shum Jr. as Chad\n* Stephanie Hsu as Joy Wang\n* James Hong as Gong Gong\n* Jamie Lee Curtis as Deirdre Beaubeirdre\n* Tallie Medel as Becky\n* Biff Wiff as Chad's friend\n* Sunito Datu as IRS Agent\n* Tsai Chin as Joy's grandmother\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe idea for the film was conceived by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, who are both fans of science fiction and comedy. They began writing the script in 2015, and spent several years developing the story and characters. The film was initially pitched as a more traditional comedy, but the directors eventually decided to take a more absurdist and experimental approach.\n\n### Casting\n\nThe casting process for the film was extensive, with the directors holding auditions for several months. Michelle Yeoh was the first actor to be cast, and she was followed by Ke Huy Quan, who was brought on board after a personal recommendation from Daniel Kwan. The rest of the cast was assembled over the next several months, with the directors seeking out actors who could bring a unique sense of energy and humor to the film.\n\n### Filming\n\nFilming for the film took place over several months, with the directors using a combination of practical and visual effects to create the film's diverse and fantastical worlds. The film was shot on location in Los Angeles and New York City, with the directors working closely with the cast and crew to bring the story to life.\n\n### Visual effects\n\nThe visual effects for the film were created by a team of artists at the studio Spin VFX, who used a combination of CGI and practical effects to create the film's elaborate and imaginative worlds. The visual effects were designed to be practical and grounded, with the aim of creating a sense of realism and immersion.\n\n**Themes**\n\nThe film explores a range of themes, including identity, family, love, and the search for meaning and purpose. It also touches on issues of cultural identity and the experiences of Asian Americans. The film's use of science fiction and fantasy elements allows it to explore these themes in a unique and imaginative way.\n\nOne of the key themes of the film is the idea of the multiverse, which serves as a metaphor for the infinite possibilities and choices that we face in life. The film suggests that every decision we make creates a new reality, and that we are constantly living in multiple parallel universes. This idea is both exciting and terrifying, and it serves as a powerful commentary on the complexities of human existence.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe film's soundtrack was composed by Son Lux, with additional music by Arcade Fire and Reggie Watts. The soundtrack is a key element of the film, with each song carefully chosen to reflect the mood and atmosphere of the scenes in which they appear.\n\n**Release**\n\n### Theatrical\n\nThe film premiered at the South by Southwest film festival in March 2022, where it received a standing ovation. It was released in theaters in the United States on May 13, 2022, by A24. The film opened in limited release, but it quickly expanded to wider release as word of its critical acclaim spread.\n\n### Home media\n\nThe film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on October 11, 2022, by A24. The home media release includes a range of special features, including deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes footage, and a making-of documentary.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Box office\n\nThe film was a commercial success, grossing over $100 million at the domestic box office and over $200 million worldwide. It was one of the top-grossing independent films of 2022, and it helped to establish the Daniels as two of the most exciting and innovative filmmakers working today.\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe film received widespread critical acclaim, with many critics praising its unique storytelling, visuals, and performances. It holds a 95% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 9.1/10. The film was also a critical and commercial hit, with many critics praising its originality and creativity.\n\n### Legacy\n\nThe film has had a significant impact on the film industry, with many critics and filmmakers praising its originality and creativity.

Robert Oppenheimer**\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer was a German-American theoretical physicist and director of the Manhattan Project, the research and development project that produced the atomic bomb during World War II. He is considered one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century.\n\n**Early life**\n\n### Childhood and education\n\nJulius Robert Oppenheimer was born on April 22, 1904, in New York City to Ella and Julius Oppenheimer. His father was a textile importer, and the family was part of the German-American community. Oppenheimer's early education took place at the Ethical Culture School in New York, where he developed a strong interest in mathematics and science. He then attended Harvard University, where he studied chemistry and physics. However, he soon became fascinated with theoretical physics and transferred to the University of Göttingen in Germany to study under the guidance of Max Born.\n\n### Studies in Europe\n\nOppenheimer spent several years in Europe, studying and working with some of the most prominent physicists of the time. He obtained his Ph.D. from the University of Göttingen in 1927 and then worked with Niels Bohr in Copenhagen. During this period, he became deeply involved in the development of quantum mechanics and made significant contributions to the field. However, his experiences during the rise of Nazi Germany led him to eventually return to the United States.\n\n**Early career**\n\n### Teaching\n\nIn 1929, Oppenheimer returned to the United States and became a lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley. He quickly gained a reputation as a brilliant teacher and researcher, and his lectures were often attended by students from the surrounding universities. In 1935, he was appointed as a professor of theoretical physics at the University of California, Berkeley, where he continued to teach and conduct research until 1942.\n\n### Scientific work\n\nOppenheimer's scientific work during the 1930s focused on the development of quantum mechanics and its applications to atomic physics. He made significant contributions to the understanding of black holes, neutron stars, and the behavior of electrons in atoms. His work in the field of theoretical physics earned him international recognition, and he became one of the leading figures in the development of modern physics.\n\n**Private and political life**\n\n### Politics\n\nOppenheimer was deeply involved in politics and became an outspoken advocate for social justice and human rights. He was a strong supporter of the New Deal and worked closely with the Roosevelt administration on various projects. However, his involvement in politics also made him a target for McCarthyism, and he faced intense scrutiny and criticism during the Red Scare of the 1950s.\n\n### Relationships and children\n\nOppenheimer married Katherine \"Kitty\" Posen in 1940, and the couple had two children, Toni and Peter. However, the relationship was marked by infidelity and domestic violence, and the couple eventually divorced in 1967.\n\n### Mysticism\n\nOppenheimer was deeply interested in mysticism and spirituality, and he often sought guidance from various spiritual leaders and teachers. He was particularly drawn to the teachings of Hinduism and Buddhism, and he saw himself as a spiritual seeker. His fascination with mysticism often led him to question the nature of reality and the human condition.\n\n**Manhattan Project**\n\n### Los Alamos\n\nIn 1942, Oppenheimer was appointed as the director of the Manhattan Project, a research and development project that aimed to produce an atomic bomb during World War II. He was tasked with assembling a team of scientists and engineers at Los Alamos, New Mexico, to work on the development of the bomb. The team, known as the \"Los Alamos Laboratory,\" included some of the most brilliant scientists of the time, including Enrico Fermi, Ernest Lawrence, and Richard Feynman.\n\n### Bomb design\n\nOppenheimer and his team worked tirelessly to develop the design of the atomic bomb. They faced numerous challenges and setbacks, including the lack of resources, the complexity of the design, and the risk of nuclear accidents. However, through their dedication and ingenuity, they eventually developed a working design for the bomb, which was tested at the Trinity Site in New Mexico.\n\n### Trinity\n\nThe Trinity test, held on July 16, 1945, was a pivotal moment in the development of the atomic bomb. Oppenheimer and his team watched as the bomb exploded, releasing an enormous amount of energy and destroying everything in its vicinity. The test was a success, and the bomb was deemed ready for use in combat.\n\n**Postwar activities**\n\n### Institute for Advanced Study\n\nAfter the end of World War II, Oppenheimer returned to the United States and became the director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He continued to work on various projects, including the development of quantum field theory and the study of black holes.\n\n### Atomic Energy Commission\n\nIn 1947, Oppenheimer was appointed as the chairman of the General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). He played a key role in shaping the commission's policies and guidelines for the development and use of nuclear energy.\n\n### Panels and study groups\n\nOppenheimer served on various panels and study groups, including the President's Science Advisory Committee and the National Academy of Sciences. He was a strong advocate for the responsible use of nuclear energy and the development of international agreements to regulate the use of nuclear weapons.\n\n### Security hearing\n\nIn 1954, Oppenheimer was called to testify before the Atomic Energy Commission's Personnel Security Board, which was investigating his loyalty and security clearance. The hearing was marked by intense scrutiny and criticism, and Oppenheimer was eventually stripped of his security clearance.\n\n**Final years**\n\n### Enrico Fermi Award\n\nIn 1963, Oppenheimer was awarded the Enrico Fermi Award, which is the highest honor awarded by the Department of Energy for contributions to nuclear energy. The award recognized Oppenheimer's contributions to the development of nuclear energy and his leadership in the field.\n\n**Death**\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer died on February 18, 1967, at the age of 62, due to complications from throat cancer. His legacy as a scientist, educator, and leader continues to be celebrated and studied by scholars and scientists around the world.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nOppenheimer's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is remembered as a brilliant scientist who made significant contributions to the development of modern physics. He is also remembered as a leader who played a key role in the development of the atomic bomb and the Manhattan Project. However, his legacy is also marked by controversy and criticism, particularly with regards to his involvement in the development of nuclear weapons and his role in the Red Scare.\n\n**Publications**\n\nOppenheimer published numerous papers and articles on various topics, including quantum mechanics, atomic physics, and nuclear energy. Some of his notable publications include:\n\n* \"On the Theory of Quantum Mechanics\" (1927)\n* \"The Behavior of Electrons in Atoms\" (1930)\n* \"The Development of Quantum Mechanics\" (1932)\n* \"The Role of the Scientist in Modern Society\" (1954)\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is a summary of J.

While Finland has traditionally maintained a policy of neutrality, the country's security environment has undergone significant changes over the years, influencing its relationship with NATO.\n\nHistory\n\nBackground: Finnish Neutrality at the End of World War II\n\nFollowing World War II, Finland found itself in a delicate security situation. The country's geographical location, bordering the Soviet Union, made it vulnerable to Soviet influence. In 1947, Finland signed the Paris Peace Treaty, which ended the Continuation War between Finland and the Soviet Union. The treaty recognized Finland's sovereignty but also imposed significant security obligations on the country. Finland's neutrality was a cornerstone of its foreign policy, with the goal of maintaining good relations with both the Western and Eastern blocs.\n\n1949–2023: Pre-Membership Relations\n\n### 1949–1991: Finnish Neutrality During the Cold War\n\nDuring the Cold War, Finland maintained its neutrality, avoiding membership in NATO and the Warsaw Pact. This policy was driven by a desire to avoid drawing the attention of the Soviet Union, which had significant influence over Finland's security environment. Finland's military doctrine, known as the \"Winter War\" strategy, emphasized defense and cooperation with other Nordic countries. Finland's defense cooperation with other countries was largely limited to bilateral agreements, such as the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance with the Soviet Union in 1948.\n\n### 1991–1995: Immediate Aftermath of the Cold War\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked a significant change in Finland's security environment. Finland's foreign policy shifted from neutrality to non-alignment, with a focus on cooperation with other European countries. Finland joined the European Union (EU) in 1995, which further altered its security landscape. Finland's defense cooperation with other countries expanded, with the establishment of the Nordic Battlegroup, a military cooperation initiative between Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark.\n\n### 1995–2022: Shift from Non-Alignment within the European Union\n\nFinland's EU membership led to increased cooperation with other European countries on security issues. Finland participated in EU-led military operations, such as the European Union Force Althea in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Finland also strengthened its relationships with other NATO member states, particularly in the context of the Partnership for Peace program, which aimed to promote cooperation between NATO member states and partner countries.\n\n### 2022–2023: Accession Process Following the Russian Invasion of Ukraine\n\n#### February – May 2022: Initial Response to the Invasion\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 marked a significant turning point in Finland's security environment. Finland's government responded quickly, announcing a significant increase in military spending and a commitment to strengthening its defense capabilities. Finland also increased its cooperation with other NATO member states, participating in joint military exercises and operations.\n\n#### May – June 2022: Declaration of Intent, Application\n\nIn May 2022, Finland's government announced its intention to join NATO, citing the Russian invasion of Ukraine as a major factor in its decision. Finland's parliament voted overwhelmingly in favor of the accession, paving the way for Finland's formal application to join NATO. The application was submitted in June 2022, marking a significant step towards Finland's membership in the alliance.\n\n#### June 2022 – April 2023: Ratification\n\nFinland's accession process was subject to ratification by all NATO member states. The process was expedited due to the urgency of the security situation in Europe. Finland's parliament voted in favor of the accession treaty, and the treaty was ratified by the Finnish parliament in April 2023. Finland's membership in NATO was formally confirmed on April 4, 2023, marking a significant milestone in the country's security policy.\n\nFinland's Foreign Relations with Other NATO Member States\n\nFinland's membership in NATO has strengthened its relationships with other NATO member states. Finland participates in NATO's military planning and operations, and the country has increased its defense cooperation with other NATO member states. Finland's membership in the European Union has also facilitated cooperation with other EU member states on security issues.\n\nSee Also\n\n* Finland and the European Union\n* Finland and the Soviet Union\n* Finland and the Cold War\n* Finnish military history\n* Nordic security policy\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal Links\n\n* Ministry of Defence of Finland: NATO\n* Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland: NATO\n* NATO: Finland", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Finland–NATO_relations\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Background: Finnish neutrality at the end of World War II\n##1949–2023: Pre-membership relations\n###1949–1991: Finnish neutrality during the Cold War\n###1991–1995: Immediate aftermath of the Cold War\n###1995–2022: Shift from non-alignment within the European Union\n###2022–2023: Accession process following the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n####February – May 2022: Initial response to the invasion\n####May – June 2022: Declaration of intent, application\n####June 2022 – April 2023: Ratification\n##2023–present: Finnish membership in NATO\n#Finland's foreign relations with other NATO member states\n#See also\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Illegal_operation_(euphemism)", "content": "#History\n##Background\n##\"The thing that had no name\"\n##Abortion euphemism elsewhere in print\n#Law\n#Art\n##Film\n##Television\n##Sculpture\n##Fiction\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Illegal Operation (Euphemism)**\n\nAn illegal operation is a euphemistic term used to refer to a medical procedure that is performed without the proper authorization, licensure, or in a manner that is contrary to the laws and regulations of a particular jurisdiction. This term is often used in the context of abortion, but can also refer to other medical procedures that are performed in secret or in contravention of the law.\n\n**History**\n\n### Background\n\nThe use of euphemisms to refer to medical procedures that are considered taboo or controversial has a long history. In many cultures, medical procedures that were considered morally or socially unacceptable were often referred to using indirect or veiled language in order to avoid offending or upsetting individuals. This practice continues to the present day, with many medical procedures being referred to using euphemistic language in order to avoid controversy or to protect the privacy of individuals.\n\n### \"The thing that had no name\"\n\nOne of the earliest recorded uses of a euphemistic term to refer to a medical procedure is the phrase \"the thing that had no name\" which was used by the Greek philosopher Aristotle to refer to the female reproductive system. This phrase was used in order to avoid offending or embarrassing individuals who may have been knowledgeable about the subject matter. This practice of using indirect language to refer to sensitive topics continued throughout the centuries and is still used today.\n\n### Abortion euphemism elsewhere in print\n\nThe use of euphemisms to refer to abortion has a long history. In the 19th century, the term \"therapeutic abortion\" was used to refer to the practice of terminating a pregnancy in order to save the life of the mother. This term was used in order to avoid controversy and to emphasize the medical necessity of the procedure. Today, the term \"elective abortion\" is often used to refer to the termination of a pregnancy for non-medical reasons.\n\n**Law**\n\nThe legality of medical procedures, including abortion, varies widely from country to country and even within countries. In many jurisdictions, medical procedures that are considered to be in contravention of the law are referred to using euphemistic language in order to avoid controversy or to protect the privacy of individuals. For example, in some countries, the term \"treatment\" may be used to refer to abortion in order to avoid offending or upsetting individuals.\n\nIn other cases, medical procedures that are considered to be in contravention of the law may be referred to using indirect language in order to avoid detection or prosecution. For example, in some countries, the term \"medical tourism\" may be used to refer to the practice of traveling to another country in order to undergo a medical procedure that is not available or is prohibited in one's own country.\n\n**Art**\n\nThe use of euphemistic language in art is a common practice that has been used by artists throughout history to avoid controversy or to protect the privacy of individuals. In the context of medical procedures, the use of euphemistic language in art can take many forms, including the use of indirect language, metaphor, and symbolism.\n\n### Film\n\nIn film, the use of euphemistic language to refer to medical procedures is often used to avoid controversy or to protect the privacy of individuals. For example, in the film \"The Handmaid's Tale\", the term \"the Ceremony\" is used to refer to the practice of forced pregnancy in a dystopian society. This term is used in order to avoid offending or upsetting individuals who may be familiar with the concept of rape.\n\n### Television\n\nIn television, the use of euphemistic language to refer to medical procedures is often used to avoid controversy or to protect the privacy of individuals. For example, in the television show \"The Good Wife\", the term \"the procedure\" is used to refer to the practice of abortion. This term is used in order to avoid offending or upsetting individuals who may be familiar with the concept of abortion.\n\n### Sculpture\n\nIn sculpture, the use of euphemistic language to refer to medical procedures is often used to avoid controversy or to protect the privacy of individuals. For example, in the sculpture \"The Birth of Venus\", the term \"the birth of Venus\" is used to refer to the process of giving birth. This term is used in order to avoid offending or upsetting individuals who may be familiar with the concept of childbirth.\n\n### Fiction\n\nIn fiction, the use of euphemistic language to refer to medical procedures is often used to avoid controversy or to protect the privacy of individuals.

She is best known for her iconic roles in several popular television shows, including _Cheers_, _Veronica's Closet_, and _Fat Actress_. Throughout her career, Alley has demonstrated her versatility as a performer, effortlessly transitioning between comedic and dramatic roles.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nKirstie Louise Alley was born on January 12, 1951, in Wichita, Kansas, to Robert John Alley and Lillian (née Heitmeyer) Alley. Her father was a U.S. Army sergeant, and the family moved frequently during Alley's childhood, with stops in Kansas, Missouri, and Texas. Alley has described her childhood as \" nomadic\" and has credited her experiences as a military brat with teaching her the importance of adaptability and resilience.\n\nAlley attended Southbridge High School in Massachusetts, where she was an active member of the school's theater department. After graduating in 1969, she enrolled at the University of Kansas, where she studied speech and drama. However, Alley dropped out of college after her first year to pursue a career in acting.\n\n**Career**\n\nAlley's early career was marked by small roles in film and television. Her breakthrough came in 1987, when she was cast as Rebecca Howe on the popular sitcom _Cheers_. Alley's performance as the lovable but awkward bar manager earned her a Golden Globe nomination and helped establish her as a household name.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, Alley continued to appear in a variety of television shows and films, including _Veronica's Closet_, _Suddenly Susan_, and _Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo_. Her portrayal of Veronica Chase, the titular character in _Veronica's Closet_, earned her multiple Emmy nominations and a Golden Globe win.\n\nIn 2005, Alley starred in the Showtime series _Fat Actress_, a comedy-drama that explored themes of body image and self-acceptance. The show was praised for its honest portrayal of weight issues and Alley's unflinching performance.\n\nIn addition to her work in television, Alley has appeared in a number of films, including _Look Who's Talking_ and _Drop Dead Gorgeous_. Her performances have been characterized by her signature blend of wit, charm, and vulnerability.\n\n**Personal life**\n\nAlley has been open about her struggles with weight and body image throughout her career. In 2005, she appeared on the cover of _Playboy_ at the age of 53, a move that was seen as a bold statement of self-acceptance.\n\nIn 2013, Alley announced that she had been diagnosed with colon cancer. She underwent surgery and chemotherapy, and has since become an advocate for colon cancer awareness.\n\nAlley has been a member of the Church of Scientology since the 1970s, and has credited the organization with helping her to overcome addiction and find personal growth. However, her involvement with Scientology has also been the subject of controversy, with some critics accusing the organization of being a cult.\n\nIn 2016, Alley announced that she was running for president of the United States as a member of the Reform Party. Her campaign was short-lived, but she has remained an outspoken advocate for social justice and women's rights.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n### Film\n\n* _The Last Dinosaur_ (1977)\n* _Looking for Kitty_ (1984)\n* _Summer School_ (1987)\n* _Drop Dead Gorgeous_ (1999)\n* _Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo_ (1999)\n* _Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit_ (1993)\n* _Look Who's Talking_ (1989)\n* _It Takes Two_ (1995)\n* _Drive Me Crazy_ (1999)\n\n### Television\n\n* _Cheers_ (1987-1993)\n* _Veronica's Closet_ (1997-2000)\n* _Suddenly Susan_ (1996-2000)\n* _Fat Actress_ (2005)\n* _Kirstie_ (2013-2014)\n* _The Mummy: The Animated Series_ (1997-1998)\n\n**Awards and nominations**\n\n* Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Television Series - Musical or Comedy (1998)\n* Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series (1997, 1998)\n* Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series (1997, 1998)\n* People's Choice Award for Favorite Female Television Performer (1998, 1999)\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of American film actresses\n* List of American television actresses\n* Scientology and the media\n* Body image in the media\n\n**References**\n\n**External links**\n\n* Kirstie Alley at IMDb\n* Kirstie Alley at AllMovie\n* Kirstie Alley on Twitter", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Kirstie_Alley\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#Career\n#Personal life\n##Body image\n##Scientology\n##Politics\n#Death\n#Filmography\n##Film\n##Television\n#Awards and nominations\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The album marked Beyoncé's first solo project in six years, following her 2016 album Lemonade, and her second solo album since the birth of her twins in 2017.\n\n**Background and conception**\n\nBeyoncé began working on Renaissance in 2017, around the same time she was preparing for her Coachella 2018 performance. The album was initially planned as a visual album, with Beyoncé aiming to create a film to accompany the music. However, the project evolved over time, and the album became a more traditional studio effort.\n\nThroughout the creation of Renaissance, Beyoncé drew inspiration from various sources, including her love of disco, funk, and house music. The album's sound was influenced by the 1970s and 1980s, with Beyoncé incorporating elements of classic disco and funk into her production.\n\n**Cover artwork**\n\nThe cover art for Renaissance features a black and white photograph of Beyoncé posing in a glamorous, high-fashion style. The image is taken from behind, with Beyoncé's face obscured by a veil of hair. The cover art was designed by her longtime collaborator, artist and director, Jonathan Mannion.\n\n**Composition**\n\nRenaissance is a 16-track album that explores themes of love, empowerment, and self-discovery. The album features a mix of genres, including disco, funk, house, and R&B.

Tracks like \"Alien Superstar\" and \"Church Girl\" feature more subdued, atmospheric arrangements and lyrics that are both personal and universal.\n\n**Promotion and release**\n\nBeyoncé announced the release of Renaissance on July 22, 2022, with a series of cryptic posts on her social media accounts. The album was released on July 29, 2022, to critical acclaim and commercial success.\n\n### Singles\n\nThe album's lead single, \"Break My Soul,\" was released on May 20, 2022. The song features a driving beat and a catchy, sing-along chorus. The song's music video, directed by Beyoncé and artist Blu, features Beyoncé performing a series of dance routines in a variety of settings.\n\nThe album's second single, \"Cuff It,\" was released on July 15, 2022. The song features a more laid-back, funk-influenced arrangement and lyrics that explore themes of love and relationships.\n\n### Tour\n\nBeyoncé did not embark on a traditional tour to support Renaissance. However, she did perform a series of one-off shows and appearances, including a headlining set at the 2022 Global Citizen Festival.\n\n### Visuals\n\nBeyoncé released a series of music videos to accompany the release of Renaissance. These videos feature a mix of live footage, dance routines, and visual effects. The videos were shot in a variety of locations, including Paris, France, and New York City.\n\n### Renaissance Couture\n\nTo celebrate the release of Renaissance, Beyoncé partnered with fashion designer Virgil Abloh to create a line of Renaissance-themed clothing and accessories. The line, known as Renaissance Couture, features a mix of high-fashion and streetwear-inspired designs.\n\n**Reception**\n\nRenaissance received widespread critical acclaim upon its release. The album was praised for its innovative production, memorable melodies, and Beyoncé's vocal performances.\n\n### Critical response\n\nRolling Stone called Renaissance \"a triumph of disco-infused pop\" and praised Beyoncé's vocal range and agility. The New York Times described the album as \"a masterclass in production\" and noted the album's \"funky, danceable beats.\" Pitchfork praised the album's \"sensual, playful\" production and noted the album's \"universal\" themes.\n\n### Featured, sampled and interpolated artists\n\nRenaissance features a mix of featured, sampled, and interpolated artists. These artists include Kendrick Lamar, Jay-Z, and Sam Cooke.\n\n**Accolades**\n\nRenaissance was a commercial and critical success, earning a number of awards and accolades.

Mitigation measures aim to reduce the amount of GHGs released into the atmosphere, slow down climate change, and adapt to its impacts.\n\n**Definitions and scope**\n\nClimate change mitigation encompasses a wide range of activities, including reducing energy consumption, increasing energy efficiency, transitioning to low-carbon energy sources, and preserving and enhancing natural carbon sinks such as forests and soils. Mitigation efforts can be undertaken by individuals, communities, organizations, and governments.\n\n**Relationship with solar radiation modification (SRM)**\n\nSolar radiation modification (SRM) is a technique that aims to reduce the amount of solar radiation that reaches the Earth's surface, thereby cooling the planet. While SRM is not a primary mitigation strategy, it can be used in combination with other mitigation measures to achieve more ambitious climate goals. However, SRM is still a developing field with significant uncertainties and challenges.\n\n**Emission trends and pledges**\n\nGlobal GHG emissions have increased significantly over the past century, primarily due to fossil fuel combustion and land-use changes. To limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, the Paris Agreement sets a target of reducing global CO2 emissions by 45% by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. However, current emission trends and country pledges fall short of this goal.\n\n**Needed emissions cuts**\n\nTo achieve the Paris Agreement's 1.5°C target, global CO2 emissions need to decline by 1.5-2.5% per year from 2020 to 2030. This requires a significant reduction in fossil fuel use, especially coal, and an increase in low-carbon energy sources, such as renewable energy and nuclear power.\n\n**Pledges**\n\nCountries have made various pledges to reduce their GHG emissions, including the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. However, these pledges are not yet sufficient to meet the 1.5°C target, and many countries need to increase their ambition.\n\n**Low-carbon energy**\n\nLow-carbon energy sources, including solar, wind, hydro, and nuclear power, are essential for reducing GHG emissions and mitigating climate change.\n\n**Solar and wind energy**\n\nSolar and wind energy have become increasingly cost-competitive with fossil fuels, making them attractive options for power generation. Solar energy has grown rapidly, with solar PV capacity increasing by 20% annually from 2010 to 2020.\n\n**Other renewables**\n\nHydroelectric power is a significant source of renewable energy, particularly in regions with abundant water resources. Other renewable energy sources, such as geothermal and biomass, also play important roles in reducing GHG emissions.\n\n**Integrating variable renewable energy**\n\nVariable renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, require integration with other energy sources to ensure reliable power supply. This can be achieved through energy storage, demand response, and grid management.\n\n**Nuclear power**\n\nNuclear power can play a significant role in reducing GHG emissions, particularly in countries with significant nuclear capacity. However, nuclear power also has its own set of challenges and risks, including nuclear waste disposal and safety concerns.\n\n**Replacing coal with natural gas**\n\nReplacing coal with natural gas can reduce GHG emissions, particularly in the power sector. However, natural gas combustion also releases methane, a potent GHG, which must be accounted for in emissions calculations.\n\n**Demand reduction**\n\nReducing energy demand through conservation and efficiency measures can also contribute to GHG emission reductions.\n\n**Energy conservation and efficiency**\n\nEnergy efficiency measures, such as improving building insulation and using energy-efficient appliances, can reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions.\n\n**Lifestyle changes**\n\nIndividual lifestyle changes, such as reducing air travel, using public transport, and adopting a plant-based diet, can also contribute to GHG emission reductions.\n\n**Dietary change**\n\nA plant-based diet can reduce GHG emissions from agriculture, particularly beef and lamb production.\n\n**Family size**\n\nReducing family size can also contribute to GHG emission reductions, particularly in regions with high population growth rates.\n\n**Preserving and enhancing carbon sinks**\n\nPreserving and enhancing natural carbon sinks, such as forests, soils, and wetlands, can also contribute to GHG emission reductions.\n\n**Forests**\n\nForests absorb CO2 through photosynthesis and store it in biomass and soils. Forest conservation and reforestation efforts are essential for maintaining forest carbon stocks.\n\n### Conservation\n\nForest conservation involves protecting existing forests from deforestation and degradation. This can be achieved through protected areas, sustainable forest management, and community-led forest conservation.\n\n### Afforestation and reforestation\n\nAfforestation and reforestation involve planting new trees in areas where forests have been degraded or cleared. This can help restore ecosystem services and sequester CO2.\n\n**Soils**\n\nSoils store significant amounts of carbon in the form of organic matter and soil minerals. Soil conservation and restoration efforts can help maintain soil carbon stocks.\n\n**Wetlands**\n\nWetlands, such as mangroves and salt marshes, are important carbon sinks that can absorb and store CO2. Protecting and restoring wetlands is essential for maintaining their carbon sequestration potential.\n\n**Deep ocean**\n\nThe deep ocean is a significant carbon sink that can absorb and store CO2. However, the ocean's carbon sequestration potential is limited by the rate of ocean acidification and the impacts of warming on marine ecosystems.\n\n**Enhanced weathering**\n\nEnhanced weathering involves accelerating the natural weathering process to convert CO2 into stable solid minerals. This can be achieved through geological carbonation, where CO2 is injected into basaltic rocks to form stable carbonates.\n\n**Other methods to capture and store CO2**\n\nOther methods to capture and store CO2 include carbon capture and storage (CCS), bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), and direct air capture (DAC).\n\n**Mitigation by sector**\n\nMitigation efforts can be implemented across various sectors, including buildings, transportation, industry, and agriculture.\n\n**Buildings**\n\nBuildings can reduce energy consumption through energy-efficient design, insulation, and lighting. Building codes and standards can be implemented to promote energy-efficient construction.\n\n**Urban planning**\n\nUrban planning can promote compact, walkable, and mixed-use development, reducing the need for personal vehicles and promoting active transportation.\n\n**Transport**\n\nTransportation is a significant source of GHG emissions, particularly from road transport. Mitigation efforts in the transport sector can be achieved through electrification, biofuels, and alternative modes of transport.\n\n### Shipping\n\nShipping is a significant source of GHG emissions, particularly from international trade. Mitigation efforts in the shipping sector can be achieved through efficiency measures, alternative fuels, and reduced cargo capacity.\n\n### Air transport\n\nAir transport is a significant source of GHG emissions, particularly from long-haul flights. Mitigation efforts in the air transport sector can be achieved through fuel efficiency, alternative fuels, and reduced passenger capacity.\n\n**Agriculture, forestry and land use**\n\nAgriculture, forestry, and land use (AFOLU) are significant sources of GHG emissions, particularly from deforestation, land degradation, and livestock production. Mitigation efforts in the AFOLU sector can be achieved through sustainable agriculture practices, reforestation, and conservation.\n\n**Industry**\n\nIndustry is a significant source of GHG emissions, particularly from fossil fuel combustion and process emissions. Mitigation efforts in the industry sector can be achieved through energy efficiency, electrification, and alternative fuels.\n\n**Co-benefits**\n\nMitigation efforts can also provide co-benefits, including employment and economic development, energy security, health and well-being, and climate change adaptation.\n\n**Employment and economic development**\n\nMitigation efforts can create new job opportunities and stimulate economic growth, particularly in the clean energy and sustainability sectors.\n\n**Energy security**\n\nMitigation efforts can improve energy security by reducing dependence on fossil fuels and promoting renewable energy sources.\n\n**Health and well-being**\n\nMitigation efforts can improve health and well-being by reducing air pollution and promoting healthy lifestyles.\n\n**Climate change adaptation**\n\nMitigation efforts can also contribute to climate change adaptation by building resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate-related impacts.\n\n**Negative side effects**\n\nMitigation efforts can also have negative side effects, such as increased energy costs, reduced economic competitiveness, and social impacts on communities.\n\n**Costs and funding**\n\nMitigation efforts can have significant costs, particularly for developing countries. Funding for mitigation efforts can come from various sources, including government budgets, international aid, and private sector investments.\n\n### Avoided costs of climate change effects\n\nAvoided costs of climate change effects can also provide a source of funding for mitigation efforts, as reducing GHG emissions can prevent costly climate-related impacts such as sea-level rise and extreme weather events.\n\n### Distributing emissions abatement costs\n\nDistributing emissions abatement costs can also provide a source of funding for mitigation efforts, as the costs of reducing GHG emissions can be distributed across various sectors and stakeholders.\n\n### Funding\n\nFunding for mitigation efforts can come from various sources, including government budgets, international aid, and private sector investments.\n\n**Policies**\n\nPolicies are essential for promoting mitigation efforts and achieving climate goals. National policies, international agreements, and market mechanisms can all play important roles in promoting mitigation efforts.\n\n**National policies**\n\nNational policies can promote mitigation efforts through regulations, incentives, and taxes. Carbon pricing, for example, can provide a financial incentive for reducing GHG emissions.\n\n### Carbon pricing\n\nCarbon pricing involves setting a price on GHG emissions to provide a financial incentive for reducing emissions. Carbon pricing can be implemented through taxes, trading systems, or a combination of both.\n\n**International agreements**\n\nInternational agreements can promote mitigation efforts by setting global climate goals and providing a framework for cooperation. The Paris Agreement, for example, sets a global goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.\n\n### Paris Agreement\n\nThe Paris Agreement is an international agreement that sets a global goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The agreement also provides a framework for cooperation and support for developing countries.\n\n**History**\n\nThe history of climate change mitigation efforts dates back to the 1960s, when the first international agreements were signed. Since then, there have been significant advancements in mitigation technologies and policies.\n\n**Society and culture**\n\nSociety and culture play important roles in shaping attitudes and behaviors related to climate change mitigation. Commitments to divest from fossil fuels, for example, are becoming increasingly common.\n\n### Commitments to divest\n\nCommitments to divest from fossil fuels are becoming increasingly common, as investors and institutions seek to reduce their exposure to climate-related risks.\n\n### Barriers\n\nBarriers to mitigation efforts include lack of awareness, lack of funding, and lack of policy support. Addressing these barriers is essential for achieving climate goals.\n\n### Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had significant impacts on mitigation efforts, including reduced economic activity and increased greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n**Examples by country**\n\nExamples of mitigation efforts can be seen in various countries around the world. The United States, China, and the European Union are all implementing significant mitigation efforts.\n\n### United States\n\nThe United States has implemented various mitigation efforts, including the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement.\n\n### China\n\nChina has implemented significant mitigation efforts, including the National Plan for Climate Change and the Paris Agreement.\n\n### European Union\n\nThe European Union has implemented various mitigation efforts, including the EU Emissions Trading System and the Paris Agreement.\n\n**See also**\n\nClimate change, greenhouse gas emissions, carbon capture and storage, renewable energy, energy efficiency, sustainable development, and climate change adaptation.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Climate_change_mitigation\" following this outline:\n\n#Definitions and scope\n##Relationship with solar radiation modification (SRM)\n#Emission trends and pledges\n##Needed emissions cuts\n##Pledges\n#Low-carbon energy\n##Solar and wind energy\n##Other renewables\n##Integrating variable renewable energy\n##Nuclear power\n##Replacing coal with natural gas\n#Demand reduction\n##Energy conservation and efficiency\n##Lifestyle changes\n##Dietary change\n##Family size\n#Preserving and enhancing carbon sinks\n##Forests\n###Conservation\n###Afforestation and reforestation\n##Soils\n##Wetlands\n##Deep ocean\n##Enhanced weathering\n#Other methods to capture and store CO2\n#Mitigation by sector\n##Buildings\n##Urban planning\n##Transport\n###Shipping\n###Air transport\n##Agriculture, forestry and land use\n##Industry\n#Co-benefits\n##Employment and economic development\n##Energy security\n##Health and well-being\n##Climate change adaptation\n#Negative side effects\n#Costs and funding\n##Avoided costs of climate change effects\n##Distributing emissions abatement costs\n##Funding\n#Policies\n##National policies\n###Carbon pricing\n##International agreements\n###Paris Agreement\n#History\n#Society and culture\n##Commitments to divest\n##Barriers\n##Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic\n#Examples by country\n##United States\n##China\n##European Union\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

These ratings provide a standardized way for climbers to gauge the level of difficulty and risk associated with a particular climb. The various grading systems used in different regions and climbing styles have distinct characteristics, reflecting the unique challenges and requirements of each discipline.\n\n**History**\n\nThe concept of grading climbing routes dates back to the early days of rock climbing, when climbers used descriptive terms such as \"easy\" or \"difficult\" to describe a route's difficulty. Over time, more formal grading systems emerged, often based on the climbers' perception of a route's technical and physical demands.\n\nIn the 19th century, the French Alpinist Édouard Martel introduced a system of grading Alpine climbs, which used a combination of numerical and descriptive terms. This system was later refined and expanded by other French climbers, leading to the development of the French numerical grade system.\n\n**Free Climbing**\n\nFree climbing is a style of climbing that involves ascending a route without the use of artificial aids, such as ladders, ropes, or pitons. The grading of free climbing routes is typically based on the physical and technical demands of the climb.\n\n### French Numerical Grade\n\nThe French numerical grade system is one of the most widely used grading systems in the world. It uses a six-point scale, ranging from 1 to 9, with additional letters (a, b, c, etc.) used to indicate the level of difficulty. The system is based on the physical and technical demands of the climb, with higher grades indicating more difficult routes.\n\n* Grade 1: Easy routes, often with large holds and minimal technical difficulty.\n* Grade 2: Routes with moderate physical and technical demands.\n* Grade 3: More challenging routes with smaller holds and greater technical difficulty.\n* Grade 4: Routes with significant physical and technical demands, often requiring precise footwork and body positioning.\n* Grade 5: Very difficult routes with small holds and high technical demands.\n* Grade 6: Extremely challenging routes with minimal holds and high risk of injury.\n* Grade 7: Routes with extreme physical and technical demands, often requiring advanced climbing techniques.\n* Grade 8: Extremely difficult routes with minimal holds and high technical demands.\n* Grade 9: The most difficult routes, often requiring advanced climbing techniques and a high level of physical fitness.\n\n### American YDS Grade\n\nThe American YDS (Yosemite Decimal System) is a grading system used primarily in the United States. It uses a seven-point scale, ranging from Class 1 to Class 5, with additional letters (a, b, c, etc.) used to indicate the level of difficulty.\n\n* Class 1: Easy routes, often with large holds and minimal technical difficulty.\n* Class 2: Routes with moderate physical and technical demands.\n* Class 3: More challenging routes with smaller holds and greater technical difficulty.\n* Class 4: Routes with significant physical and technical demands, often requiring precise footwork and body positioning.\n* Class 5: Very difficult routes with small holds and high technical demands.\n* Class 6: Extremely challenging routes with minimal holds and high risk of injury.\n* Class 7: Routes with extreme physical and technical demands, often requiring advanced climbing techniques.\n\n### UIAA Scale\n\nThe UIAA (Union of International Alpine Associations) scale is a grading system used worldwide, particularly in Europe. It uses a seven-point scale, ranging from I to VIII, with additional letters (a, b, c, etc.) used to indicate the level of difficulty.\n\n* Grade I: Easy routes, often with large holds and minimal technical difficulty.\n* Grade II: Routes with moderate physical and technical demands.\n* Grade III: More challenging routes with smaller holds and greater technical difficulty.\n* Grade IV: Routes with significant physical and technical demands, often requiring precise footwork and body positioning.\n* Grade V: Very difficult routes with small holds and high technical demands.\n* Grade VI: Extremely challenging routes with minimal holds and high risk of injury.\n* Grade VII: Routes with extreme physical and technical demands, often requiring advanced climbing techniques.\n* Grade VIII: The most difficult routes, often requiring advanced climbing techniques and a high level of physical fitness.\n\n### British E-Grade\n\nThe British E-Grade system is used primarily in the United Kingdom. It uses a five-point scale, ranging from E1 to E9, with additional numbers used to indicate the level of difficulty.\n\n* E1: Easy routes, often with large holds and minimal technical difficulty.\n* E2: Routes with moderate physical and technical demands.\n* E3: More challenging routes with smaller holds and greater technical difficulty.\n* E4: Routes with significant physical and technical demands, often requiring precise footwork and body positioning.\n* E5: Very difficult routes with small holds and high technical demands.\n* E6: Extremely challenging routes with minimal holds and high risk of injury.\n* E7: Routes with extreme physical and technical demands, often requiring advanced climbing techniques.\n* E8: The most difficult routes, often requiring advanced climbing techniques and a high level of physical fitness.\n* E9: The most extreme routes, often requiring advanced climbing techniques and a very high level of physical fitness.\n\n### Other Notable Systems\n\nOther notable grading systems include:\n\n* The Swiss Alpine Club (SAC) system, which uses a five-point scale, ranging from I to V.\n* The German Alpine Club (DAV) system, which uses a five-point scale, ranging from I to V.\n* The Austrian Alpine Club (ÖAV) system, which uses a five-point scale, ranging from I to V.\n\n**Bouldering**\n\nBouldering is a style of climbing that involves ascending a short, lower-level route, often without the use of ropes or harnesses. The grading of bouldering routes is typically based on the physical and technical demands of the climb.\n\n### Comparison with Free Climbing\n\nBouldering routes are often considered easier than free climbing routes, as they typically involve shorter and more straightforward climbs.

He was a key figure in the development of the Australian Museum and played a crucial role in promoting Darwinian doctrine in the country.\n\n**Family**\n\nGerard Krefft was born in 1830 in the Kingdom of Prussia (now part of modern-day Germany). Little is known about his early life and family. However, it is believed that he was raised in a family of modest means and developed an interest in natural history from a young age.\n\n**Education**\n\nKrefft's formal education is not well-documented, but it is believed that he attended a local gymnasium in Germany before emigrating to Australia in the 1850s. His early education laid the foundation for his future career as a natural historian.\n\n**Marriage**\n\nKrefft married a woman named Elisa Borger in 1853 in Melbourne, Australia. The couple had several children together, but little is known about their personal lives beyond their professional achievements.\n\n**German heritage**\n\nKrefft's German heritage played a significant role in shaping his worldview and approach to natural history. As a German immigrant in Australia, he brought with him a strong emphasis on scientific inquiry and a passion for the natural world.\n\n**\"Natural history\"**\n\nKrefft's work in natural history spanned a wide range of fields, including botany, zoology, and geology. He was particularly interested in the fauna of Australia and made significant contributions to the study of the country's unique and endemic species.\n\n**\"Darwinian doctrine\" and the consequent \"Darwinian controversy\"**\n\nKrefft was a strong supporter of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution through natural selection. He became one of the first Australians to promote Darwinian doctrine and faced considerable opposition from those who rejected the idea of evolution. The controversy surrounding Darwinism in Australia was intense, with many scientists and theologians questioning the validity of the theory.\n\n**Evolution**\n\nKrefft saw evolution as a fundamental principle of natural history, and he believed that it explained many of the complex relationships between species. He was particularly interested in the study of fossil records and used them to support the theory of evolution.\n\n**Natural selection**\n\nKrefft was a strong advocate for the concept of natural selection, which he saw as a key mechanism driving the process of evolution. He believed that natural selection was responsible for the adaptation of species to their environments and the emergence of new species over time.\n\n**Ellegård's five \"positions\" held by scientists in the Darwinian controversy**\n\nKrefft's views on Darwinism can be categorized into one of five positions outlined by the Swedish historian Alvar Ellegård: (1) the \"Darwinian\", who accepts the theory of evolution; (2) the \"Darwinian-skeptical\", who questions certain aspects of the theory but accepts its core principles; (3) the \"anti-Darwinian\", who rejects the theory of evolution; (4) the \"pre-Darwinian\", who accepts the idea of evolution but rejects the concept of natural selection; and (5) the \"anti-evolutionist\", who rejects the idea of evolution altogether. Krefft held a \"Darwinian\" position, accepting the theory of evolution and natural selection as fundamental principles of natural history.\n\n**Artist**\n\nKrefft was not only a natural historian but also an artist. He was skilled in drawing and painting, and his artistic talents were evident in his illustrations of Australian fauna. His artwork was used to accompany his scientific writings and publications.\n\n**Victoria (1852 – 1858)**\n\nKrefft's early years in Australia were marked by his work in the Victorian era. He was appointed as the curator of the Museum of Natural History in Melbourne and worked closely with Professor William McCoy, a prominent Australian natural historian. During this period, Krefft became involved in the development of the Australian Museum and played a key role in promoting Darwinian doctrine in the country.\n\n**Melbourne**\n\nKrefft's work in Melbourne was marked by his efforts to establish the Australian Museum as a center of scientific inquiry and education. He was instrumental in promoting the museum's collections and exhibitions, which focused on the natural history of Australia.\n\n**Blandowski, the Museum of Natural History, and Professor McCoy**\n\nKrefft's work in Melbourne was also marked by his collaboration with the Polish-born naturalist Eduard Blandowski, who was a prominent figure in the field of Australian natural history. Krefft worked closely with Blandowski and Professor McCoy to promote the study of Australian fauna and to establish the Australian Museum as a center of scientific inquiry.\n\n**Germany**\n\nKrefft's German heritage played a significant role in shaping his worldview and approach to natural history. As a German immigrant in Australia, he brought with him a strong emphasis on scientific inquiry and a passion for the natural world.\n\n**Natural historian, museum curator and administrator**\n\nKrefft's work as a natural historian, museum curator, and administrator spanned a wide range of fields, including botany, zoology, and geology. He was particularly interested in the fauna of Australia and made significant contributions to the study of the country's unique and endemic species.\n\n**Darwinism**\n\nKrefft was a strong supporter of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution through natural selection. He became one of the first Australians to promote Darwinian doctrine and faced considerable opposition from those who rejected the idea of evolution.\n\n**\"The New Museum Idea\"**\n\nKrefft's work in promoting Darwinian doctrine was closely tied to his efforts to establish the Australian Museum as a center of scientific inquiry and education.

He was instrumental in promoting the Australian Museum and other public museums in Australia.\n\n**The \"new museum\"**\n\nKrefft's work in the Australian Museum was marked by his efforts to establish the institution as a center of scientific inquiry and education. He was instrumental in promoting the museum's collections and exhibitions, which focused on the natural history of Australia.\n\n**Krefft's curatorial rationale**\n\nKrefft's work as a curator was guided by a strong emphasis on scientific inquiry and a passion for the natural world. He believed that museums should serve as centers of education and scientific inquiry, and that their collections and exhibitions should reflect the natural history of the country.\n\n**Lack of funding**\n\nKrefft's work in the Australian Museum was often hindered by a lack of funding. The institution struggled to secure sufficient resources to support its collections and exhibitions, and Krefft was forced to rely on private donations and grants to support his work.\n\n**Photography**\n\nKrefft was an early adopter of photography in Australia. He used photography to document the country's unique and endemic species and to promote the study of Australian natural history.\n\n**Queensland lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri)**\n\nKrefft's work on the Queensland lungfish was marked by his efforts to document and promote the study of this unique species. He was instrumental in collecting and preserving specimens of the lungfish and in promoting its study through his publications and lectures.\n\n**Louis Agassiz and the Chimaera**\n\nKrefft's work on the Queensland lungfish was also marked by his collaboration with the Swiss-born naturalist Louis Agassiz. Krefft worked closely with Agassiz to study the lungfish and to promote its study through his publications and lectures.\n\n**Gerard Krefft, William Forster, and the cartilaginous Burnett Salmon or barramunda**\n\nKrefft's work on the Queensland lungfish was also marked by his collaboration with the Australian naturalist William Forster. Krefft and Forster worked together to study the lungfish and to promote its study through their publications and lectures.\n\n**January 1870**\n\nKrefft's work on the Queensland lungfish was marked by his efforts to collect and preserve specimens of the species. In January 1870, Krefft traveled to the Burnett River in Queensland to collect specimens of the lungfish and to study its habitat.\n\n**Krefft's \"Natural History\" articles in The Sydney Mail**\n\nKrefft's work in promoting Darwinian doctrine was closely tied to his efforts to establish himself as a respected natural historian. In 1872, he began writing a series of articles on natural history for The Sydney Mail, a prominent newspaper in Australia. His articles, which were titled \"Natural History\", were widely read and helped to promote the study of Australian natural history.\n\n**George B. Mason and The Australian Home Companion and Band of Hope Journal**\n\nKrefft's work in promoting Darwinian doctrine was also marked by his collaboration with the Australian naturalist George B. Mason. Krefft and Mason worked together to promote the study of natural history and to establish the Australian Museum as a center of scientific inquiry.\n\n**Krefft and The Sydney Mail**\n\nKrefft's work in writing for The Sydney Mail was marked by his efforts to promote Darwinian doctrine and to establish himself as a respected natural historian.

The test aimed to validate the performance and capabilities of the Starship vehicle in a real-world environment.\n\n**Background**\n\n**Starship**\n\nThe Starship is a reusable spacecraft under development by SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk, with the primary objective of establishing a permanent, self-sustaining human presence on the Moon and Mars. The Starship is designed to be a versatile, multi-purpose spacecraft, capable of carrying both people and cargo to various destinations in the solar system.\n\n**Development**\n\nThe development of the Starship began in 2012, with the first prototype, called the Starship Mark I, being built in 2016. Since then, numerous iterations and improvements have been made to the design, with the Starship SN8 being the first to feature a stainless steel structure. The SN8 was followed by the SN9, SN10, and SN11, which underwent various test flights, including a successful 10-kilometer (6.2-mile) high altitude flight in May 2020.\n\n**Opinions before launch**\n\nIn the months leading up to the Starship Flight Test 1, there was significant interest and scrutiny surrounding the test. Many experts and enthusiasts expressed optimism about the potential of the Starship, while others raised concerns about the risks and challenges associated with the test.\n\n**Test objectives**\n\nThe primary objectives of the Starship Flight Test 1 were:\n\n1. To validate the performance of the Starship in a real-world environment\n2. To test the vehicle's ability to reach a high altitude and return safely\n3. To assess the vehicle's control systems and navigation capabilities\n4. To gather data on the vehicle's aerodynamics and thermal performance\n\n**Launch**\n\n**Flight profile**\n\nOn April 20, 2023, at 7:00 AM EDT (11:00 UTC), the Starship Flight Test 1 was launched from the SpaceX Launch Pad at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The vehicle, which weighed approximately 100 tons, lifted off vertically and reached a maximum altitude of 35 kilometers (22 miles).\n\n**Flight timeline**\n\nThe flight timeline was as follows:\n\n* Liftoff: 7:00 AM EDT (11:00 UTC)\n* Maximum dynamic pressure (Max Q): 8:00 AM EDT (12:00 UTC)\n* Maximum altitude: 35 kilometers (22 miles) at 8:30 AM EDT (12:30 UTC)\n* Return to Earth: 9:00 AM EDT (13:00 UTC)\n\n**April 17, 2023 attempt**\n\nPrior to the successful launch on April 20, 2023, SpaceX attempted to launch the Starship Flight Test 1 on April 17, 2023. However, the launch was scrubbed due to technical issues with the vehicle's propulsion system.\n\n**April 20, 2023, 2nd attempt**\n\nThe second attempt on April 20, 2023, was successful, and the Starship Flight Test 1 reached a maximum altitude of 35 kilometers (22 miles) before returning to Earth safely.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n**Technical assessments**\n\nFollowing the successful completion of the Starship Flight Test 1, SpaceX conducted a thorough technical assessment of the vehicle's performance. The assessment revealed that the vehicle had performed as expected, with the propulsion system and control systems functioning nominally.\n\n**Launch site**\n\nThe launch site, the SpaceX Launch Pad at the Kennedy Space Center, was found to be in good condition, with no significant damage or issues reported.\n\n**Effects on environment**\n\nThe launch of the Starship Flight Test 1 had a minimal impact on the environment, with no reports of significant noise pollution or other disturbances.\n\n**FAA investigation**\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) conducted an investigation into the launch, which found that the flight test had been conducted safely and in accordance with all relevant regulations.\n\n**See also**\n\n* SpaceX Starship\n* SpaceX Launch Pad\n* Kennedy Space Center\n* Federal Aviation Administration\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The Starship Flight Test 1 was a significant milestone in the development of the SpaceX Starship program, demonstrating the vehicle's ability to reach a high altitude and return safely.\n* The test marked a major step forward for the program, paving the way for future crewed missions to the Moon and Mars.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Starship_flight_test_1\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Starship\n##Development\n##Opinions before launch\n##Test objectives\n#Launch\n##Flight profile\n##Flight timeline\n##April 17 2023 attempt\n##April 20, 2023, 2nd attempt\n#Aftermath\n##Technical assessments\n##Launch site\n##Effects on environment\n##FAA investigation\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The dynasty's power and influence spanned several centuries, with its members serving as rulers, princes, and leaders of the Welsh people.\n\n**Aberffraw hundred (cantref)**\n\nThe Aberffraw hundred, also known as the cantref of Aberffraw, was a territorial unit in northwest Wales that served as the base of the Aberffraw dynasty. The cantref was a self-governing area that was divided into smaller units, known as commotes, and was responsible for collecting taxes, maintaining law and order, and providing military personnel for the kingdom. The Aberffraw hundred was an important center of power and influence, and the dynasty's rulers were known for their military prowess and administrative skills.\n\n**Welsh dynasties**\n\nThe Aberffraw dynasty was one of several powerful Welsh dynasties that emerged during the medieval period. These dynasties were often related by blood or marriage, and alliances were frequently formed and broken between them. The Aberffraw dynasty was particularly close to the Rhys dynasty, with whom they shared a common ancestor. The Aberffraw dynasty also had close ties with the English monarchy, particularly during the Norman Conquest of England.\n\n**Succession**\n\nThe Aberffraw dynasty followed a system of succession that was based on the principles of primogeniture andagnatic seniority. The eldest son of the ruling prince was the heir apparent, while younger sons and daughters were often granted lands and titles. The system of succession was not always straightforward, and disputes often arose between rival claimants. The Aberffraw dynasty was particularly prone to succession crises, particularly during the 13th and 14th centuries.\n\n**Cambro-Norse era**\n\nDuring the 11th and 12th centuries, the Aberffraw dynasty faced significant challenges from the Cambro-Norse invaders, who had arrived in Wales from England and Ireland. The Aberffraw dynasty was forced to adapt to the new circumstances, and many of its members were incorporated into the Cambro-Norse nobility. The Aberffraw dynasty's power and influence were significantly reduced during this period, but they continued to play a role in Welsh politics.\n\n**Power base (Norman invasion)**\n\nFollowing the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, the Aberffraw dynasty was forced to establish a new power base in northwest Wales. The Aberffraw hundred remained a key center of power, but the dynasty's influence was now more closely tied to the English monarchy. Many of the Aberffraw dynasty's members were granted lands and titles by the English king, and they became important allies of the English crown.\n\n**Aberffraw senior line**\n\nThe Aberffraw senior line was a branch of the Aberffraw dynasty that emerged during the 12th century. This line was characterized by its close ties to the English monarchy and its role as a major power in northwest Wales. The Aberffraw senior line was particularly prominent during the 13th and 14th centuries, when its members served as princes of Wales and played a significant role in the country's politics.\n\n**Llys**\n\nThe Llys was the traditional seat of power of the Aberffraw dynasty. Located in the heart of the Aberffraw hundred, the Llys was a fortified manor house that served as the center of government, administration, and power. The Llys was often the residence of the ruling prince and his family, and it was here that important decisions were made and alliances were formed.\n\n**Rhosyr**\n\nRhosyr was a commote within the Aberffraw hundred that played an important role in the dynasty's history. The commote was known for its rich agricultural land and its strategic location on the coast. Many of the Aberffraw dynasty's members were granted lands and titles within Rhosyr, and it remained an important center of power and influence throughout the medieval period.\n\n**Aberffraw**\n\nAberffraw was the capital of the Aberffraw hundred and the traditional seat of power of the Aberffraw dynasty. The town was strategically located on the coast, and it played an important role in the country's trade and commerce. Many of the Aberffraw dynasty's members were born and raised in Aberffraw, and it remained an important center of power and influence throughout the medieval period.\n\n**Princes of Wales (de facto)**\n\nDuring the 13th and 14th centuries, the Aberffraw dynasty's members served as princes of Wales in all but name. While the English king held the title of prince of Wales, it was often the Aberffraw dynasty's members who exercised the power and influence. Llywelyn the Great, a member of the Aberffraw dynasty, was one of the most prominent princes of Wales during this period and played a significant role in the country's politics.\n\n**Llywelyn the Great**\n\nLlywelyn the Great was a member of the Aberffraw dynasty who served as prince of Wales during the 13th century. He was a prominent leader who played a significant role in the country's politics and was known for his military prowess and diplomatic skills. Llywelyn the Great was a key figure in the Aberffraw dynasty's history and remained a powerful force in Welsh politics until his death in 1240.\n\n**1200s- 1400s**\n\nDuring the 13th and 14th centuries, the Aberffraw dynasty continued to play a significant role in Welsh politics. The dynasty's members served as princes of Wales, and many of its members were granted lands and titles by the English king. The Aberffraw dynasty's power and influence were significant, but they were often challenged by rival dynasties and the English crown.\n\n**Succession after the dynasty**\n\nFollowing the decline of the Aberffraw dynasty, its members continued to play a role in Welsh politics. However, the dynasty's power and influence were significantly reduced, and it was often overshadowed by other dynasties and the English crown.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Aberffraw hundred\n* Welsh dynasties\n* Llywelyn the Great\n* Princes of Wales\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n* \n\n**References**\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n**Sources**\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n**Further reading**\n\n* \n* \n*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"House_of_Aberffraw\" following this outline:\n\n#Aberffraw hundred (cantref)\n#Welsh dynasties\n##Succession\n#Cambro-Norse era\n#Power base (Norman invasion)\n##Aberffraw senior line\n#Llys\n##Rhosyr\n##Aberffraw\n#Princes of Wales (de facto)\n##Llywelyn the Great\n##1200s- 1400s\n#Succession after the dynasty\n#See also\n#Footnotes\n#References\n#Sources\n#Further reading\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The scandal began in December 2021 and continued to unfold throughout 2022 and 2023.\n\nBackground\n\n### COVID-19 lockdowns in the United Kingdom\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the United Kingdom introduced a series of lockdowns to slow the spread of the virus. These lockdowns were enforced through various measures, including the closure of non-essential businesses, restrictions on travel, and limits on social gatherings. The UK government's response to the pandemic was overseen by the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak.\n\n### Westminster\n\nWestminster is the location of the UK government's headquarters, including 10 Downing Street, where the Prime Minister resides. The area is also home to many other government buildings, including the Houses of Parliament. During the pandemic, these buildings were subject to the same lockdown rules as the rest of the country, with restrictions on social gatherings and other measures in place to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nTimeline of reporting and reaction\n\n### 2021\n\n#### Up to 6 December\n\nIn the early stages of the pandemic, the UK government's response was widely praised for its swift and decisive action. However, as the pandemic wore on, concerns began to grow about the government's handling of the crisis. On December 6, 2021, it was reported that the Prime Minister had attended a Christmas party at 10 Downing Street in December 2020, despite the lockdown rules in place at the time.\n\n#### Stratton video (7–8 December)\n\nOn December 7, 2021, a video emerged showing Dominic Cummings, a senior aide to the Prime Minister, attending a meeting at 10 Downing Street in May 2020. The video, which was leaked to the press, showed Cummings arguing with the Prime Minister's chief advisor, Martin Reynolds, about the propriety of attending a meeting while in self-isolation. The video sparked widespread outrage and calls for the Prime Minister's resignation.\n\n#### 9 December onwards\n\nIn the days following the leak of the Stratton video, the Prime Minister faced intense scrutiny over his handling of the pandemic. On December 9, 2021, it was reported that the Prime Minister had attended yet another social gathering at 10 Downing Street in May 2020, despite the lockdown rules in place at the time. The scandal continued to grow, with many MPs calling for the Prime Minister's resignation.\n\n### 2022\n\n#### Up to 19 January\n\nIn the early stages of 2022, the Prime Minister faced continued pressure over the Partygate scandal. On January 19, 2022, it was reported that the police were investigating the Prime Minister's attendance at the social gathering in May 2020.\n\n#### From 24 January\n\nIn the days following the report of the police investigation, the Prime Minister's position became increasingly precarious. On January 24, 2022, it was reported that the Prime Minister had apologized for attending the social gathering in May 2020, but many MPs remained critical of his handling of the crisis.\n\n#### After the conclusion of the police investigation\n\nOn February 17, 2022, the police concluded their investigation into the Prime Minister's attendance at the social gathering in May 2020. The Prime Minister was fined £50 for breaking the lockdown rules, but many MPs remained critical of his handling of the crisis.\n\n#### After the publication of Gray's report\n\nOn May 25, 2022, the report of Sue Gray, the Cabinet Office's senior civil servant, was published. The report found that the Prime Minister had attended multiple social gatherings at 10 Downing Street in breach of the lockdown rules. The report sparked widespread outrage and calls for the Prime Minister's resignation.\n\n### 2023\n\n#### COVID-19 Inquiry evidence\n\nIn 2023, the UK government's COVID-19 Inquiry began to gather evidence from senior government officials, including the Prime Minister. The inquiry's findings are expected to be critical of the government's handling of the pandemic.\n\n#### June–October 2023\n\nThroughout the summer of 2023, the Prime Minister faced continued pressure over the Partygate scandal. On June 15, 2023, it was reported that the Prime Minister had attended yet another social gathering at 10 Downing Street in breach of the lockdown rules. The scandal continued to grow, with many MPs calling for the Prime Minister's resignation.\n\nEvents\n\n### During first national lockdown\n\nIn March 2020, the UK government imposed a national lockdown to slow the spread of the virus.

However, the Prime Minister and his staff continued to attend social gatherings at 10 Downing Street in breach of the lockdown rules.\n\n### During second lockdown in England\n\nIn November 2020, the UK government imposed a second national lockdown in England to slow the spread of the virus.

The inquiry's findings are expected to be critical of the government's handling of the crisis.\n\n#### Alleged lobbying before the final report was published\n\nIn April 2022, it was reported that the Prime Minister's aides had been involved in lobbying the Cabinet Office to delay the publication of Sue Gray's report. The report was eventually published in May 2022, but many MPs remained critical of the Prime Minister's handling of the crisis.\n\n#### Final report\n\nIn May 2022, Sue Gray's report was published.

The investigation was led by the Committee's Chair, Dame Eleanor Laing.\n\nReactions\n\n### Within the Conservative Party\n\n#### Initial responses\n\nIn December 2021, the Conservative Party's initial response to the Partygate scandal was one of denial and deflection. Many MPs defended the Prime Minister's actions and claimed that he had done nothing wrong.\n\n#### Alleged intimidation of MPs opposed to Johnson\n\nIn January 2022, it was reported that the Prime Minister's aides had been involved in intimidating MPs who opposed him.

The film stars Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer as a brother and sister who try to capture footage of a UFO that is terrorizing their rural California town. The film is Peele's third feature film as a director and writer, following \"Get Out\" (2017) and \"Us\" (2019).\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place in the fictional town of Hawthorne, California, where Emancipation Day is celebrated. The story follows OJ Haywood (Daniel Kaluuya), a young man who lives on a horse farm with his sister Emerald (Keke Palmer). The siblings are struggling to keep the farm afloat, but their lives are disrupted by a mysterious and unexplained phenomenon that appears in the sky.\n\nAs the events unfold, OJ and Emerald try to capture footage of the phenomenon, which they initially believe to be a UFO. However, as the days pass, they begin to realize that the object is not a conventional spacecraft, but rather a creature that is terrorizing their town.\n\nThe film follows the Haywood siblings as they try to uncover the truth behind the creature and the sinister forces that are behind its existence. Along the way, they encounter a range of characters, including a UFO enthusiast (Brandon Perea) and a rancher (Michael Wincott) who may hold the key to the mystery.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Daniel Kaluuya as OJ Haywood\n* Keke Palmer as Emerald Haywood\n* Brandon Perea as Angel Torres\n* Wrenn Schmidt as Antlers Holst\n* Steven Yeun as Ricky \"King\" Perkins\n* Michael Wincott as Ruslan\n* Barbie Ferreira as Alex\n* Keith David as Otis Haywood Sr.\n\n**Themes and interpretations**\n\n\"Nope\" is a complex and multifaceted film that explores a range of themes and ideas. At its core, the film is a commentary on the exploitation of Native American land and culture, as well as the ways in which the natural world is often misunderstood and feared.\n\nThe film also explores the idea of the \"monstrous other,\" as embodied by the creature that appears in the sky. The creature is a symbol of the unknown and the unknowable, and the film raises questions about the nature of reality and the ways in which we attempt to understand it.\n\nIn addition, the film is a commentary on the ways in which Hollywood and the media often exploit and sensationalize real-world events and phenomena. The film's portrayal of the media's obsession with the UFO phenomenon is a commentary on the ways in which the media can distort and manipulate public perception.\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\n\"Nope\" was first announced in 2019, with Jordan Peele set to write and direct the film. The project was initially reported to be a horror film, but Peele has since said that the film is more of a science fiction horror film.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography on \"Nope\" began in February 2021 in the San Joaquin Valley of California. The film was shot on 35mm film, with Peele working closely with the cinematographer, Hoyte van Hoytema, to create a distinctive and atmospheric visual style.\n\n### Creature design\n\nThe creature that appears in the sky is a key element of the film's design. The creature was created by a team of visual effects artists, who used a combination of practical and digital effects to bring the creature to life.\n\n### Costumes\n\nThe costumes in \"Nope\" are designed to be functional and practical, rather than elaborate or showy. The characters' clothing is often simple and understated, reflecting their rural and working-class backgrounds.\n\n### Sound design\n\nThe sound design in \"Nope\" is a key element of the film's atmospheric and immersive soundscapes. The film's sound engineer, Alan Robert Murray, worked closely with Peele to create a distinctive and unsettling sound design that complements the film's visuals.\n\n### Music\n\nThe music in \"Nope\" is a key element of the film's atmosphere and mood. The film's score was composed by Michael Abels, who worked closely with Peele to create a distinctive and unsettling soundtrack that complements the film's visuals.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nThe marketing campaign for \"Nope\" began in April 2022, with the release of a series of cryptic and unsettling teasers that hinted at the film's mysterious and unsettling themes. The campaign continued with the release of a series of character posters and trailers, which provided more insight into the film's complex and multifaceted narrative.\n\n**Release**\n\n\"Nope\" was released in the United States on July 22, 2022, in a limited release before expanding to a wider release in August.

With a career spanning over six decades, Turner is one of the most successful musicians of all time, known for her powerful and distinctive voice, energetic live performances, and iconic style. Born Anna Mae Bullock on November 26, 1939, in Nutbush, Tennessee, Turner rose to fame in the 1960s as the lead singer of the Ike & Tina Turner Revue, and later achieved solo superstardom in the 1980s.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nTurner grew up in a poor African American family in Nutbush, a small town in Tennessee. Her parents, Floyd and Zelma Bullock, were sharecroppers who struggled to make ends meet. Turner's early life was marked by hardship and isolation, with the family often relying on the charity of neighbors to get by. Despite these challenges, Turner's parents encouraged her love of music, and she began singing in church choirs and local talent shows from an early age.\n\n**Ike and Tina Turner**\n\n### Origins: 1956–1960\n\nTurner's music career began in 1956, when she met Ike Turner, a musician and bandleader from Mississippi. Turner was just 17 years old at the time, and Ike was 25. The two began performing together in local bars and clubs, singing a mix of blues, rock, and roll, and R&B music. Ike Turner's stage name was a pseudonym, and he adopted it to hide his true identity and to avoid being associated with the music of his estranged wife.\n\n### Early Success: 1960–1965\n\nIn 1960, Ike Turner formed the Kings of Rhythm, a band that would eventually become the Ike & Tina Turner Revue. Turner's powerful voice and energetic stage presence quickly made her a star, and the band began to attract attention from local promoters and record labels. In 1962, the band signed with Sue Records, a small label in St. Louis, Missouri, and their first single, \"A Fool in Love,\" became a regional hit.\n\n### Mainstream Success: 1966–1975\n\nIn 1966, the Ike & Tina Turner Revue signed with A&M Records, and their popularity began to soar. The band's music was a unique blend of rock, blues, and R&B, and Turner's voice was a key factor in their success. The band toured extensively, performing in clubs, theaters, and concert halls across the United States and Europe. During this period, they released several hit singles, including \"River Deep – Mountain High,\" \"Proud Mary,\" and \"Nutbush City Limits.\"\n\n### Split: 1976\n\nDespite their success, Turner's marriage to Ike Turner was troubled, and the couple's relationship began to deteriorate in the early 1970s. Turner filed for divorce in 1976, and the Ike & Tina Turner Revue disbanded shortly thereafter. Turner took time to focus on her solo career, and Ike Turner went on to pursue a career in music production.\n\n**Solo Career**\n\n### Early Solo Career: 1976–1982\n\nTurner's solo career began in 1976, when she released her debut album, \"Tina Turns the Country On!\" The album was a commercial success, and Turner began to establish herself as a solo artist. Over the next few years, she released several more albums, including \"Rough\" and \"Love Explosion,\" but it was her 1979 album, \"Private Dancer,\" that brought her to international attention.\n\n### Career Resurgence and Superstardom: 1983–2000\n\nIn 1983, Turner released her breakthrough album, \"Break Every Rule,\" which featured the hit singles \"What's Love Got to Do with It\" and \"Typical Male.\" The album was a massive commercial success, and Turner became a global superstar. Over the next few years, she released several more albums, including \"Foreign Affair\" and \"The Best,\" and she continued to tour and perform to sold-out crowds.\n\n### Later Career: 2001–2021\n\nIn 2001, Turner released her album \"Twenty Four Seven,\" which featured the hit singles \"Whatever You Need\" and \"Complicated Disaster.\" The album was a commercial success, and Turner continued to tour and perform throughout the 2000s and 2010s. In 2013, she announced her retirement from touring, but she continued to perform occasional live shows and release new music.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\n### Relationships and Marriages\n\nTurner was married twice, first to Ike Turner, with whom she had a daughter, Tina Turner Jr. (born 1960), and then to Erwin Bach, a German music executive, with whom she had a son, Raymond Craig Turner (born 2015).\n\n### Early Relationships\n\nTurner's early relationships were marked by hardship and abuse, including a violent relationship with her first husband, Raymond Hill. She later described her relationship with Ike Turner as \"a nightmare,\" and she eventually escaped from the relationship with the help of her friends and family.\n\n### Ike Turner\n\nTurner's marriage to Ike Turner was a key factor in her early success, but it was also a source of ongoing abuse and violence. Ike Turner was known to be physically and emotionally abusive, and Turner eventually filed for divorce in 1976.\n\n### Erwin Bach\n\nTurner met Erwin Bach in 1986, and the two began a romantic relationship. Bach is a German music executive, and he has been a key supporter of Turner's career. The couple married in 2013, and they have a son together.\n\n**Children**\n\nTurner has four children, including her daughter, Tina Turner Jr., and her son, Raymond Craig Turner.\n\n**Religious Beliefs**\n\nTurner was raised in a Christian household, and she has spoken publicly about the importance of her faith in her life. She has also been open about her struggles with spirituality and her desire to find a deeper connection with God.\n\n**Residences, Citizenship, and Wealth**\n\nTurner has lived in several countries throughout her career, including the United States, Germany, and Switzerland. She became a Swiss citizen in 2013, and she currently resides in Küsnacht, Switzerland.\n\n**Illness and Death**\n\nTurner has been open about her struggles with health issues, including kidney disease and heart problems. In 2016, she underwent a kidney transplant, and she has since spoken publicly about the importance of organ donation.\n\n**Musical Legacy and Accolades**\n\nTurner is widely regarded as one of the greatest musicians of all time, with a career spanning over six decades.

It is characterized by a strong emphasis on the authority and inerrancy of the Bible, as well as a commitment to traditional Christian doctrine and practices. Reformed fundamentalism is distinct from other evangelical movements, such as conservative evangelicalism, and has its own unique theological and historical context.\n\n**History and Main Leaders**\n\nReformed fundamentalism has its roots in the Calvinist and Reformed tradition of Protestantism, which dates back to the 16th century. However, the modern movement as we know it today began to take shape in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Key figures in the development of Reformed fundamentalism include:\n\n* J. Gresham Machen (1881-1937), a Presbyterian theologian and pastor who was a leading figure in the fundamentalist movement\n* Carl McIntire (1906-2002), a Presbyterian minister and leader of the Bible Presbyterian Church, which was a key denomination in the fundamentalist movement\n* Bob Jones Sr. (1883-1968), a Baptist minister and founder of Bob Jones University, which became a major center for Reformed fundamentalism\n* Billy James Hargis (1925-2004), a Baptist minister and founder of the Christian Crusade, a fundamentalist organization that advocated for conservative Christian values\n\n**Theological Distinctives**\n\nReformed fundamentalism has several distinct theological emphases:\n\n### **Broader Conservative Evangelicalism**\n\nWhile Reformed fundamentalism shares many similarities with broader conservative evangelicalism, there are key differences in their approach to theology and practice. Conservative evangelicals often emphasize the importance of personal conversion and a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, while Reformed fundamentalists tend to focus more on the authority and inerrancy of the Bible.\n\n### **Pertaining to Salvation and the Gospel**\n\nReformed fundamentalists tend to emphasize the importance of a correct understanding of the gospel and the means of salvation. They often emphasize the importance of faith alone in Jesus Christ for salvation, and reject any notion of salvation by works or sacraments.\n\n### **Other Fundamental Protestant and Biblical Theology**\n\nReformed fundamentalists also emphasize the importance of traditional Protestant and biblical theology, including the doctrines of justification by faith, the priesthood of all believers, and the authority of the Bible.\n\n### **The Inspiration and Preservation of the Scriptures**\n\nReformed fundamentalists believe in the verbal plenary inspiration of the Scriptures, which holds that the Bible is the inspired, inerrant, and authoritative word of God. They also emphasize the importance of the preservation of the texts of scripture, and often emphasize the importance of using the Authorized Version (KJV) of the Bible.\n\n### **Verbal Plenary Inspiration**\n\nVerbal plenary inspiration is the doctrine that the Bible is the inspired, inerrant, and authoritative word of God. This doctrine holds that every word of the Bible, including the original manuscripts, is the exact word of God.\n\n### **Preservation of the Texts of Scripture**\n\nReformed fundamentalists believe that the texts of scripture have been preserved by God throughout history, and that the Authorized Version (KJV) of the Bible is a reliable representation of the original manuscripts.\n\n## **Common Principles of Reformation Evangelical Interpretation and Private Reading**\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of interpretation and private reading of the Bible. They emphasize the importance of using the literal, historical-grammatical approach to interpretation, and reject any notion of allegorical or mystical interpretation.\n\n## **The Classical Creeds and Reformational Confessions**\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of the classical creeds and reformational confessions, including the Apostles' Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Westminster Confession of Faith.\n\n**Congregational Practices**\n\nReformed fundamentalists tend to emphasize the importance of traditional congregational practices, including:\n\n* **Baptism**: Reformed fundamentalists typically practice believer's baptism by immersion.\n* **Communion**: Reformed fundamentalists typically practice communion according to the traditional Protestant understanding, with an emphasis on the literal presence of Christ in the elements.\n* **Worship**: Reformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of traditional worship, including the use of hymns, psalms, and prayer.\n* **Discipline**: Reformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of church discipline, including the discipline of sinners and the protection of the church from false doctrine.\n\n**Bible Translation and Usage**\n\nReformed fundamentalists have a strong emphasis on the importance of using the Authorized Version (KJV) of the Bible, which they believe is a reliable representation of the original manuscripts. However, they also recognize the importance of using modern translations for their accuracy and clarity.\n\n### **The Authorized Version Tradition, the Byzantine Received Text, and Eastern (Greek) and Western (Greco-Latin) Ecclesiastical Translation Traditions**\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of the Authorized Version (KJV) tradition, which is based on the Byzantine Received Text.

Griffith's writing career spanned over two decades, during which he produced a significant body of work that captivated readers with its imaginative and often prophetic vision of the future.\n\n## Biography\n\n### Early life\n\nGeorge Griffith was born in 1857 in the city of London, England. Little is known about Griffith's early life, and it is not until he began his writing career that we have any concrete evidence of his personal history. Griffith's background and family circumstances are somewhat shrouded in mystery, and it is only through his writing that we can glimpse the contours of his life.\n\n### Teaching career\n\nPrior to embarking on a career in writing, Griffith worked as a teacher. He taught at a variety of schools in England, including a stint at a boys' school in Kent. Griffith's experiences as a teacher would later influence his writing, particularly in his depiction of the relationships between authority figures and their pupils.\n\n### Writing career\n\nGriffith's writing career began in the late 1880s, when he started contributing short stories to various magazines and journals. His early work was largely influenced by the science fiction and utopian fiction of the time, and he was particularly drawn to the ideas of Edward Bulwer-Lytton and Jules Verne.\n\n### Early career\n\nGriffith's early stories were often characterized by their emphasis on scientific and technological innovation. His characters were frequently scientists, inventors, or engineers, who used their skills to solve complex problems and improve the human condition. Griffith's early work was also notable for its focus on the relationships between science and society, as he explored the implications of scientific progress for human culture and values.\n\n### Breakthrough\n\nGriffith's breakthrough came with the publication of his novel \"A Honeymoon in Space\" in 1901. This novel told the story of a couple who travel to the moon for their honeymoon, and it marked a significant shift in Griffith's work towards a more utopian and optimistic vision of the future. \"A Honeymoon in Space\" was a critical and commercial success, and it established Griffith as a major figure in the science fiction genre.\n\n### Mid-1890s\n\nThe mid-1890s saw Griffith's work take on a more overtly utopian tone. His stories and novels began to emphasize the potential for human progress and improvement, as he explored the implications of scientific and technological innovation for human society. Griffith's work during this period was characterized by its emphasis on the power of human ingenuity and the importance of cooperation and collaboration in achieving social and technological progress.\n\n### Decline\n\nGriffith's work declined in popularity during the early 1900s, as he struggled to adapt to changing literary and cultural trends. His writing became more conservative and less innovative, and he was criticized for his perceived lack of creativity and originality. Griffith's personal life also suffered during this period, as he struggled with financial difficulties and personal relationships.\n\n### Final years\n\nGriffith's final years were marked by declining health and increasing financial difficulties. He continued to write, but his output was significantly reduced, and his work was no longer widely read or appreciated. Griffith died in 1906, at the age of 49, and his legacy as a science fiction writer was largely forgotten until the mid-20th century.\n\n## Death\n\nGeorge Griffith died on April 28, 1906, at the age of 49. The circumstances of his death are not well-documented, but it is known that he was in poor health for many years before his passing. Griffith's death marked the end of an era in science fiction, as he was one of the last of the great Victorian science fiction writers.\n\n## Legacy\n\n### Place in science fiction history\n\nGeorge Griffith is widely regarded as one of the pioneers of science fiction. His work was influential in shaping the genre and inspiring future writers. Griffith's emphasis on scientific and technological innovation, as well as his focus on the relationships between science and society, helped to lay the groundwork for the development of science fiction as a distinct literary genre.\n\n### Literary proficiency\n\nGriffith's literary proficiency is often overlooked in favor of his scientific and technological themes. However, his writing is characterized by its clarity, simplicity, and accessibility. Griffith's use of language is direct and concise, making his stories and novels easy to follow and understand. His writing is also notable for its emphasis on character development and relationships, as he explores the complexities of human nature and the implications of scientific and technological progress for human culture and values.\n\n### In relation to H. G. Wells\n\nGriffith's work had a significant influence on H. G. Wells, who was a major figure in the science fiction genre. Wells was heavily influenced by Griffith's emphasis on scientific and technological innovation, as well as his focus on the relationships between science and society. Wells's work, particularly his early novels such as \"The Time Machine\" and \"The War of the Worlds,\" reflects Griffith's influence and explores similar themes and ideas.\n\n## Personal views\n\n### Religion\n\nLittle is known about Griffith's personal views on religion. As a writer, Griffith was often drawn to the scientific and philosophical implications of his characters' actions and decisions, rather than their personal beliefs or values. However, it is possible to infer that Griffith was agnostic or atheist, given his emphasis on scientific and technological progress and his critique of traditional social and cultural institutions.\n\n### Politics\n\nGriffith's politics were largely socialistic, as he advocated for the importance of cooperation and collaboration in achieving social and technological progress. His work often emphasized the need for collective action and the importance of addressing social and economic inequalities. Griffith's politics were also influenced by his emphasis on scientific and technological innovation, as he saw the potential for science and technology to solve complex social and economic problems.\n\n### Social matters\n\nGriffith's views on social matters were often critical of traditional social and cultural institutions. He was particularly concerned with issues such as poverty, inequality, and social justice, and his work often explored the implications of scientific and technological progress for human culture and values. Griffith's views on social matters were also influenced by his emphasis on the importance of cooperation and collaboration, as he saw the potential for collective action to address complex social and economic problems.\n\n## Publications\n\n### Poetry collections\n\nGriffith published two poetry collections during his lifetime: \"Poems\" (1880) and \"Poems, Second Series\" (1884). These collections contain a selection of Griffith's earlier work, including poems on themes such as nature, love, and social justice.\n\n### Novels\n\nGriffith published eight novels during his lifetime: \"A Honeymoon in Space\" (1901), \"Olga Romanoff\" (1905), \"The Angel of the Revolution\" (1893), \"The Outlaws of the Air\" (1895), \"The Angel of the Revolution\" (1893), \"The Outlaws of the Air\" (1895), \"The Angel of the Revolution\" (1893), and \"The Outlaws of the Air\" (1895). These novels explore themes such as scientific and technological innovation, social justice, and the relationships between science and society.\n\n### Short stories\n\nGriffith published numerous short stories during his lifetime, many of which were collected in volumes such as \"The Angel of the Revolution\" (1893) and \"The Outlaws of the Air\" (1895). These stories often explore themes such as science and technology, social justice, and the relationships between science and society.\n\n### Short story collections\n\nGriffith published two short story collections during his lifetime: \"The Angel of the Revolution\" (1893) and \"The Outlaws of the Air\" (1895).

This book contains biographical sketches of notable historical figures, including scientists, inventors, and politicians.\n\n## Explanatory notes\n\nThis article is based on available information about George Griffith's life and work.

With a rich history dating back to ancient times, Turkey has been a hub of cultural, economic, and political influence in the region for centuries. The country has a diverse population of over 84 million people, speaking a unique blend of languages, including Turkish, Kurdish, and others.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name \"Turkey\" is derived from the Middle English term \"Turke,\" which referred to the Turkic peoples who migrated from Central Asia to Anatolia in the 11th century. The name \"Türkiye\" is the Turkish form of the name, which has been officially used since 1923, when the modern Republic of Turkey was founded.\n\n**History**\n\n### Prehistory and ancient history\n\nTurkey's earliest human habitation dates back to the Paleolithic era, around 700,000 years ago. The ancient civilizations of Anatolia, including the Hittites, Lydians, and Phrygians, flourished in the region between 2300 BCE and 546 BCE. The Greeks and Romans later conquered Anatolia, leaving a lasting legacy in the region's language, culture, and architecture.\n\n### Early classical antiquity\n\nIn the 1st century BCE, the Romans conquered Anatolia, which became a major center of trade and commerce. The region's strategic location at the crossroads of Europe and Asia made it an important hub for the Roman Empire's eastern trade routes.\n\n### Rome and Byzantine Empire\n\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire in the 4th century CE, Anatolia was conquered by the Byzantine Empire, which ruled the region for over a thousand years. During this period, the city of Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul) became the capital of the Byzantine Empire and a major center of Christianity.\n\n### Seljuks and Anatolian beyliks\n\nIn the 11th century, the Seljuk Turks, a Turkic people from Central Asia, conquered Anatolia and established the Seljuk Empire. The Seljuks were followed by the Anatolian beyliks, a collection of Turkish principalities that ruled the region until the 14th century.\n\n### Ottoman Empire\n\nIn 1299, the Ottoman Empire was founded by Osman I, a Turkish tribal leader. The Ottoman Empire grew rapidly, conquering much of the Middle East, North Africa, and Eastern Europe. At its peak, the Ottoman Empire was one of the largest and most powerful empires in history.\n\n### Republic of Türkiye\n\nIn 1923, the modern Republic of Turkey was founded by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, a Turkish nationalist leader.
