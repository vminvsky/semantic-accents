The primary goal of climate change mitigation is to slow down the rate of global warming and minimize its effects on the environment, human health, and the economy.\n\n**Definitions and scope**\n\nClimate change mitigation encompasses a wide range of strategies and techniques to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. It involves reducing emissions from various sectors, such as energy production, transportation, industry, and agriculture, as well as enhancing natural carbon sinks like forests, soils, and oceans.\n\n**Relationship with solar radiation modification (SRM)**\n\nSolar radiation modification (SRM) is a technique aimed at reducing the amount of solar radiation that enters the Earth's atmosphere, thereby cooling the planet. While SRM is still in its infancy, some researchers suggest that it could be a potential complement to climate change mitigation efforts. However, the relationship between SRM and climate change mitigation is complex, and more research is needed to understand its potential impacts and effectiveness.\n\n**Emission trends and pledges**\n\nGlobal greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise, despite the growing awareness of climate change. According to recent estimates, emissions need to be reduced by 45% by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050 to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. To achieve this, countries have made various pledges to reduce their emissions, including the Paris Agreement, which sets a global goal to limit warming to well below 2°C and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5°C.\n\n**Needed emissions cuts**\n\nTo limit global warming to 1.5°C, the world needs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 45% by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050. This requires a significant transformation of the energy sector, with a shift from fossil fuels to low-carbon sources, as well as improvements in energy efficiency and demand reduction.\n\n**Pledges**\n\nCountries have made various pledges to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, including:\n\n* The Paris Agreement, which sets a global goal to limit warming to well below 2°C and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5°C.\n* The European Union's commitment to reduce emissions by 55% by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050.\n* China's pledge to reach peak emissions by 2030 and become carbon neutral by 2060.\n\n**Low-carbon energy**\n\nLow-carbon energy sources, such as solar and wind power, are increasingly becoming cost-competitive with fossil fuels. Governments and companies are investing heavily in renewable energy technologies, which are expected to play a major role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n**Solar and wind energy**\n\nSolar and wind energy are becoming increasingly cost-competitive with fossil fuels.

Preserving and enhancing these sinks is essential for mitigating climate change.\n\n**Forests**\n\nForests are a critical carbon sink, with trees absorbing and storing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Deforestation and forest degradation can release stored carbon, exacerbating climate change.\n\n**Conservation**\n\nConservation efforts, such as reforestation and afforestation, can restore and expand forests, enhancing their carbon sink capacity.\n\n**Afforestation and reforestation**\n\nAfforestation and reforestation efforts can restore and expand forests, enhancing their carbon sink capacity.\n\n**Soils**\n\nSoils can also store carbon, and agricultural practices that promote soil health and carbon storage can help mitigate climate change.\n\n**Wetlands**\n\nWetlands, such as mangroves and salt marshes, can also store carbon and provide other ecosystem services.\n\n**Deep ocean**\n\nThe deep ocean can also store carbon, and some researchers suggest that it may be possible to enhance its carbon sink capacity through technologies such as ocean fertilization.\n\n**Enhanced weathering**\n\nEnhanced weathering involves accelerating the natural process of rock weathering to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This can be done through various technologies, including mineral carbonation and geoengineering.\n\n**Other methods to capture and store CO2**\n\nOther methods to capture and store CO2 include bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), carbon capture and storage (CCS), and direct air capture (DAC).\n\n**Mitigation by sector**\n\nClimate change mitigation efforts can be implemented in various sectors, including buildings, transportation, industry, and agriculture.\n\n**Buildings**\n\nBuildings can be designed and constructed to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions through strategies such as passive design, insulation, and efficient appliances.\n\n**Urban planning**\n\nUrban planning can also reduce greenhouse gas emissions by promoting compact, walkable, and bikeable communities that reduce the need for fossil fuels.\n\n**Transport**\n\nTransportation is a significant sector for greenhouse gas emissions, and efforts to reduce emissions include promoting electric vehicles, improving public transportation, and reducing air travel.\n\n**Shipping**\n\nShipping is a significant sector for greenhouse gas emissions, and efforts to reduce emissions include promoting more efficient ships and cleaner fuels.\n\n**Air transport**\n\nAir transport is also a significant sector for greenhouse gas emissions, and efforts to reduce emissions

This system is essential in climbing as it enables climbers to gauge their skills, assess the risks associated with a climb, and compare their abilities with others. The grade system has evolved over time and has been developed by various climbing organizations and countries.\n\n**History**\n\nThe first grading system in climbing was developed in the late 19th century by the Alpine Club of Great Britain. However, it was not until the 1950s and 1960s that more comprehensive grading systems were introduced. The French numerical grade system, also known as the \"Voie\" system, was developed in the 1950s and was based on the difficulty of the climb. The American YDS ( Yosemite Decimal System) was introduced in the 1950s and was used in the United States. Other grading systems, such as the UIAA scale, British E-grade, and Font grade, were also developed during this period.\n\n**Free climbing**\n\nFree climbing is a type of climbing where the climber uses their own strength and technique to ascend a route without any external aid. The grade of a free climb is typically indicated by a numerical or letter-based system.\n\n**French numerical grade**\n\nThe French numerical grade system, also known as the \"Voie\" system, is widely used in Europe and is based on a scale of 1 to 9, with additional letters (a, b, c, etc.) indicating the level of difficulty. The system is as follows:\n\n* 1: Easy climb with minimal difficulty\n* 2: Easy to moderate climb with some difficulty\n* 3: Moderate climb with some technical difficulty\n* 4: Difficult climb with complex moves and technical difficulties\n* 5: Very difficult climb with high risk and technical difficulties\n* 6: Extremely difficult climb with high risk and complex moves\n* 7: Extremely difficult climb with high risk and technical difficulties\n* 8: Extremely difficult climb with high risk and complex moves\n* 9: Extremely difficult climb with high risk and technical difficulties\n\n**American YDS grade**\n\nThe American YDS (Yosemite Decimal System) is used in the United States and is based on a scale of 1 to 5, with additional letters (e.g., 5.10, 5.12) indicating the level of difficulty. The system is as follows:\n\n* 1: Easy climb with minimal difficulty\n* 2: Easy to moderate climb with some difficulty\n* 3: Moderate climb with some technical difficulty\n* 4: Difficult climb with complex moves and technical difficulties\n* 5: Very difficult climb with high risk and technical difficulties\n\n**UIAA scale**\n\nThe UIAA (Union of International Alpine Associations) scale is used in Europe and is based on a scale of A to E, with additional letters (e.g., A2, C1) indicating the level of difficulty. The system is as follows:\n\n* A: Easy climb with minimal difficulty\n* B: Easy to moderate climb with some difficulty\n* C: Moderate climb with some technical difficulty\n* D: Difficult climb with complex moves and technical difficulties\n* E: Extremely difficult climb with high risk and technical difficulties\n\n**British E-grade**\n\nThe British E-grade system is used in the United Kingdom and is based on a scale of E1 to E8, with additional letters (e.g., E1 5a, E8 7a) indicating the level of difficulty. The system is as follows:\n\n* E1: Easy climb with minimal difficulty\n* E2: Easy to moderate climb with some difficulty\n* E3: Moderate climb with some technical difficulty\n* E4: Difficult climb with complex moves and technical difficulties\n* E5: Very difficult climb with high risk and technical difficulties\n* E6: Extremely difficult climb with high risk and complex moves\n* E7: Extremely difficult climb with high risk and technical difficulties\n* E8: Extremely difficult climb with high risk and complex moves\n\n**Other notable systems**\n\nOther notable grading systems include the Font grade, V-grade, and WI-grade.\n\n* Font grade: A system used in France and Italy, which is based on a scale of 4 to 9, with additional letters (e.g., 4+, 5) indicating the level of difficulty.\n* V-grade: A system used in the United States, which is based on a scale of 1 to 5, with additional letters (e.g., V1, V5) indicating the level of difficulty.\n* WI-grade: A system used in ice climbing, which is based on a scale of I to VI, with additional letters (e.g., WI3, WI5) indicating the level of difficulty.\n\n**Bouldering**\n\nBouldering is a type of climbing that involves short, low-level climbs, typically without the use of ropes or harnesses. The grade of a boulder problem is typically indicated by a numerical or letter-based system.\n\n**Comparison with free climbing**\n\nBoulder problems are typically graded using a different system than free climbs. The Font grade system is commonly used for boulder problems, while the American YDS grade system is often used for free climbs.\n\n**Font grade**\n\nThe Font grade system is used for boulder problems and is based on a scale of 4 to 9, with additional letters (e.g., 4+, 5) indicating the level of difficulty.\n\n**V-grade**\n\nThe V-grade system is used for boulder problems and is based on a scale of 1 to 5, with additional letters (e.g., V1, V5) indicating the level of difficulty.\n\n**Other notable systems**\n\nOther notable grading systems for bouldering include the UIAA scale and the British E-grade system.\n\n**Aid climbing**\n\nAid climbing is a type of climbing that involves using equipment such as ladders, ropes, and harnesses to ascend a route. The grade of an aid climb is typically indicated by a numerical or letter-based system.\n\n**Instability of aid grades**\n\nAid grades are often unstable and can be subject to significant variability, as the difficulty of an aid climb can depend on a variety of factors, including the type of equipment used and the climber's experience.\n\n**Original A-grade**\n\nThe original A-grade system was developed in the 1960s and was based on a scale of A1 to A5, with additional letters (e.g., A1 5.10, A5 5.12) indicating the level of difficulty.\n\n**New wave A-grade**\n\nThe new wave A-grade system was developed in the 1980s and was based on a scale of A0 to A5, with additional letters (e.g., A0 5.10, A5 5.12) indicating the level of difficulty.\n\n**Clean C-grade**\n\nThe clean C-grade system was developed in the 1990s and was based on a scale of C1 to C5, with additional letters (e.g., C1 5.10, C5 5.12) indicating the level of difficulty.\n\n**Ice and mixed climbing**\n\nIce and mixed climbing involve climbing on ice and mixed terrain, using specialized equipment and techniques. The grade of an ice or mixed climb is typically indicated by a numerical or letter-based system.\n\n**WI-grade**\n\nThe WI-grade system is used for ice climbing and is based on a scale of I to VI, with additional letters (e.g., WI3, WI5) indicating the level of difficulty.\n\n**M-grade**\n\nThe M-grade system is used for mixed climbing and is based on a scale of 1 to 5, with additional letters (e.g., M1, M5) indicating the level of difficulty.\n\n**D-grade**\n\nThe D-grade system is used for ice climbing and is based on a scale of D1 to D6, with additional letters (e.g., D1, D6) indicating the level of difficulty.\n\n**Scottish winter grade**\n\nThe Scottish winter grade system is used for ice climbing in Scotland and is based on a scale of Grade I to Grade VI, with additional letters (e.g., Grade I, Grade VI) indicating the level of difficulty.\n\n**Other notable systems**\n\nOther notable grading systems for ice and mixed climbing include the UIAA scale and the British E-grade system.\n\n**Mountaineering**\n\nMountaineering involves climbing to the summit of a mountain using a variety of techniques, including free climbing, aid climbing, and glacier travel. The grade of a mountaineering route is typically indicated by a numerical or letter-based system.\n\n**International French Adjectival System**\n\nThe International French Adjectival System is used for mountaineering and is based on a scale of AD to TD, with additional letters (e.g., AD+, TD-) indicating the level of difficulty.\n\n**American NCCS**\n\nThe American NCCS (North American Climbing Classification System) is used for mountaineering and is based on a scale of 1 to 5, with additional letters (e.g., 5.10, 5.12) indicating the level of difficulty.\n\n**Russian**\n\nThe Russian grading system is used for mountaineering and is based on a scale of I to V, with additional letters (e.g., I, V) indicating the level of difficulty.\n\n**Alaskan**\n\nThe Alaskan grading system is used for mountaineering and is based on a scale of I to V, with additional letters (e.g., I, V) indicating the level of difficulty.\n\n**Other notable systems**\n\nOther notable grading systems for mountaineering include the UIAA scale and the British E-grade system.\n\n**Comparison tables**\n\nThe following comparison tables can be used to compare the different grading systems for climbing, bouldering, and mountaineering.\n\n**Comparison free climbing**\n\n| System | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| French | 1a | 1b | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |\n| American | 1 | 1+ | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 5+ | 6 | 6+ |\n| UIAA | A | A+ | B | C | D | E | E+ | E++ | E+++ |\n\n**Comparison bouldering**\n\n| System | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Font | 4 | 4+ | 5 | 5+ | 6 | 6+ |\n| V-grade | V1 | V2 | V3 | V4 | V5 | V6 |\n| UIAA | A | A+ | B | C | D | E |\n| British E-grade | E1 | E2 | E3 | E4 | E5 | E6 |\n\n**Comparison mountaineering**\n\n| System | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| International French Adjectival System | AD | AD+ | D | TD | TD- |\n| American NCCS | 1 | 1+ | 2 | 3 | 4 |\n| Russian | I | II | III | IV | V |\n| Alaskan | I | II | III | IV | V |\n| UIAA | A | A+ | B | C | D |\n| British E-grade | E1 | E2 | E3 | E4 | E5 |\n\n**See also**\n\n* Climbing\n* Mountaineering\n* Bouldering\n* Ice climbing\n* Mixed climbing\n* Grade system\n* Climbing classification\n* Mountaineering classification\n\n**References**\n\n* See the references for the individual grading systems for climbing, bouldering, and mountaineering.\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* Check the further reading for the individual grading systems for climbing, bouldering, and mountaineering.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Climbing grades on Wikipedia\n* Mountaineering grades on Wikipedia\n* Bouldering grades on Wikipedia\n* Ice climbing grades on Wikipedia\n* Mixed climbing grades on Wikipedia", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Grade_(climbing)\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#Free climbing\n##French numerical grade\n##American YDS grade\n##UIAA scale\n##British E-grade\n##Other notable systems\n#Bouldering\n##Comparison with free climbing\n##Font grade\n##V-grade\n##Other notable systems\n#Aid climbing\n##Instability of aid grades\n##Original A-grade\n##New wave A-grade\n##Clean C-grade\n#Ice and mixed climbing\n##WI-grade\n##M-grade\n##D-grade\n##Scottish winter grade\n##Other notable systems\n#Mountaineering\n##International French Adjectival System\n##American NCCS\n##Russian\n##Alaskan\n##Other notable systems\n#Comparison tables\n##Comparison free climbing\n##Comparison bouldering\n##Comparison mountaineering\n#See also\n#References\n##Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The Starship is designed to be powered by a reusable rocket booster called the Super Heavy, which will provide the necessary thrust to propel the spacecraft into orbit.\n\n### **Development**\n\nThe development of the Starship spacecraft began in 2019, with SpaceX announcing plans to create a reusable spacecraft capable of taking humans to the Moon, Mars, and other destinations in the solar system. The company has since made significant progress in developing the spacecraft, including the construction of a prototype called SN8, which was used for the flight test.\n\n### **Opinions before launch**\n\nBefore the flight test, opinions about the Starship spacecraft and its capabilities were mixed. Some experts expressed concerns about the vehicle's design and potential for failure, while others were more optimistic about its potential to revolutionize space travel. Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, was confident in the spacecraft's design and capabilities, stating that it had the potential to take humans to Mars and other destinations in the solar system.\n\n### **Test objectives**\n\nThe primary objective of the Starship Flight Test 1 was to demonstrate the vehicle's capabilities and gather data on its performance. The test was designed to evaluate the spacecraft's ability to propel itself to high altitudes, gather data on its aerodynamics, and test its steering system. The test also aimed to gather data on the spacecraft's re-entry capabilities and its ability to survive the intense heat generated during re-entry.\n\n**Launch**\n\n### **Flight profile**\n\nThe Starship Flight Test 1 took place on December 9, 2020, at 10:30 AM EST from the SpaceX testing facility in Boca Chica, Texas. The spacecraft was propelled to an altitude of 48,000 feet (14,600 meters) before experiencing a rapid loss of control and crashing to the ground.\n\n### **Flight timeline**\n\nThe flight timeline was as follows:\n\n* 0:00 - Liftoff from the launch pad\n* 0:30 - Reaching an altitude of 10,000 feet (3,048 meters)\n* 1:00 - Reaching an altitude of 20,000 feet (6,096 meters)\n* 2:00 - Reaching an altitude of 48,000 feet (14,600 meters)\n* 2:30 - Loss of control and crash\n\n### **April 17, 2023 attempt**\n\nHowever, on April 17, 2023, SpaceX attempted another flight test of the Starship spacecraft, this time using a new prototype called SN20. The test aimed to demonstrate the vehicle's capabilities and gather data on its performance. Unfortunately, the test was aborted due to a technical issue with the spacecraft's fuel system.\n\n### **April 20, 2023, 2nd attempt**\n\nOn April 20, 2023, SpaceX made another attempt to launch the Starship spacecraft, this time using the SN20 prototype. The test was successful, with the spacecraft reaching an altitude of 65,000 feet (19,685 meters) and demonstrating its ability to steer and control its flight.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n### **Technical assessments**\n\nThe technical assessments of the Starship Flight Test 1 revealed several areas of improvement for the spacecraft. The test highlighted the need for more robust control systems, improved navigation, and enhanced communication systems. The test also highlighted the importance of testing and validation procedures to ensure the spacecraft's safety and reliability.\n\n### **Launch site**\n\nThe launch site for the Starship Flight Test 1 was the SpaceX testing facility in Boca Chica, Texas. The facility has been used for several other SpaceX launches and tests, including the launch of the Starship prototype SN8.\n\n### **Effects on environment**\n\nThe launch and flight test of the Starship spacecraft had a significant impact on the environment, including noise pollution and disruption to local wildlife. The launch site has been equipped with noise-reducing measures and environmental mitigation strategies to minimize the impact on the local ecosystem.\n\n### **FAA investigation**\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has launched an investigation into the Starship Flight Test 1, focusing on the safety and reliability of the spacecraft. The investigation aims to determine the causes of the loss of control and crash, as well as to identify areas for improvement to ensure the safety and reliability of future spacecraft flights.\n\n**See also**\n\n* SpaceX\n* Starship\n* Super Heavy\n* Reusable spacecraft\n* Mars exploration\n* Space travel\n* Private aerospace industry\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe Starship Flight Test 1 was a significant milestone in the development of the SpaceX Starship spacecraft, demonstrating its capabilities and gathering data on its performance.

The election was originally scheduled for 2022, but was delayed several times due to the ongoing political and economic crisis in the country.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2022 election was held in a tumultuous environment, with the country facing a severe economic crisis, a political vacuum, and a rise in sectarian tensions. The COVID-19 pandemic had also taken a toll on the country, exacerbating the economic challenges and leading to widespread disillusionment with the government.\n\n### 2019-21 protests\n\nIn 2019, a wave of protests swept across Lebanon, sparked by a proposed tax on WhatsApp calls and later fueled by demands for economic reform, accountability, and an end to corruption. The protests, which became known as the \"October Revolution,\" brought millions of people onto the streets, calling for change. However, the government's response was slow and inadequate, and the protests eventually dissipated without significant reforms.\n\n### Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, which reached Lebanon in February 2020, further exacerbated the economic crisis and worsened living conditions for many citizens. The government implemented a series of lockdowns, curfews, and travel restrictions, which had a devastating impact on the economy and the already-suffering population.\n\n### Beirut explosion\n\nOn August 4, 2020, a massive explosion rocked the Port of Beirut, killing over 200 people, injuring thousands, and causing widespread destruction. The disaster highlighted the country's corruption, incompetence, and lack of accountability, and further eroded trust in the government.\n\n**Electorate**\n\nThe 2022 election was held under Lebanon's proportional representation system, where voters elect candidates based on a party list. The electorate consisted of approximately 3.5 million eligible voters, including Lebanese citizens living in Lebanon and abroad.\n\n### Electoral system\n\nLebanon's electoral system is divided into 15 electoral districts, with each district electing between 3 to 36 members to the parliament, depending on its population. The system is designed to ensure a balance between Christian and Muslim representation, with a quota system to guarantee proportional representation.\n\n### Registered voters\n\nAccording to official figures, over 3.3 million voters were registered to cast their ballots in the 2022 election, representing around 94% of the eligible electorate. The remaining 6% were either deceased, removed from the voter rolls, or failed to register.\n\n**Lebanese living abroad**\n\nLebanese citizens living abroad were also eligible to vote in the 2022 election. However, the voting process was marred by controversy, with allegations of irregularities and voter suppression.\n\n**Candidates**\n\nA total of 985 candidates vied for a seat in the parliament, with many running as independents or on lists affiliated with specific parties or coalitions.\n\n### Withdrawals\n\nSeveral high-profile candidates, including some prominent politicians, withdrew from the election due to various reasons, including health issues, family circumstances, or disagreements with their parties.\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nPre-election opinion polls suggested a mixed picture, with some surveys indicating a strong showing for the Future Movement and the Kataeb Party, while others pointed to a potential rise in support for the Shamalouna coalition.\n\n**Political parties and coalitions**\n\nSeveral parties and coalitions participated in the 2022 election, including:\n\n### Future Movement\n\nThe Future Movement, led by former Prime Minister Saad Hariri, was one of the largest and most influential parties in the election.\n\n### Kataeb Party\n\nThe Kataeb Party, a conservative Christian party, was another prominent force in the election.\n\n### Shamalouna\n\nShamalouna, a coalition of liberal and secular parties, emerged as a significant player in the election.\n\n### Taqaddom\n\nTaqaddom, a coalition of progressive and socialist parties, also participated in the election.\n\n### Mada Network and the Secular Clubs\n\nMada Network and the Secular Clubs, a coalition of liberal and secular parties, ran on a joint list in the election.\n\n### Independence Movement\n\nThe Independence Movement, a nationalist party, also participated in the election.\n\n### MMFD and Qadreen lists\n\nThe MMFD and Qadreen lists, two separate lists affiliated with the Marada Movement, ran in the election.\n\n### Popular Bloc\n\nThe Popular Bloc, a coalition of secular and liberal parties, also participated in the election.\n\n### Rifi Bloc\n\nThe Rifi Bloc, a coalition of Sunni and nationalist parties, ran in the election.\n\n### Lebanese Forces\n\nThe Lebanese Forces, a conservative Christian party, also participated in the election.\n\n### National Liberal Party\n\nThe National Liberal Party, a liberal party, ran in the election.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe results of the 2022 election were announced on May 16, 2022. According to official figures, the Future Movement emerged as the largest party, with 32 seats in the parliament. The Kataeb Party secured 12 seats, while the Shamalouna coalition won 12 seats.\n\n### Results by alliance and parties\n\nThe results by alliance and parties were as follows:\n\n* Future Movement: 32 seats\n* Kataeb Party: 12 seats\n* Shamalouna: 12 seats\n* Taqaddom: 9 seats\n* Mada Network and the Secular Clubs: 7 seats\n* Independence Movement: 6 seats\n* MMFD and Qadreen lists: 5 seats\n* Popular Bloc: 4 seats\n* Rifi Bloc: 3 seats\n* Lebanese Forces: 3 seats\n* National Liberal Party: 2 seats\n\n### Results by lists\n\nThe results by lists were as follows:\n\n* Future Movement list: 32 seats\n* Kataeb Party list: 12 seats\n* Shamalouna list: 12 seats\n* Taqaddom list: 9 seats\n* Mada Network and the Secular Clubs list: 7 seats\n* Independence Movement list: 6 seats\n* MMFD list: 4 seats\n* Qadreen list: 1 seat\n* Popular Bloc list: 4 seats\n* Rifi Bloc list: 3 seats\n* Lebanese Forces list: 3 seats\n* National Liberal Party list: 2 seats\n\n### Results by constituency\n\nThe results by constituency were as follows:\n\n* Beirut I: Future Movement list: 5 seats\n* Beirut II: Kataeb Party list: 4 seats\n* Beirut III: Shamalouna list: 4 seats\n* Mount Lebanon: Taqaddom list: 5 seats\n* North: Mada Network and the Secular Clubs list: 4 seats\n* Baalbek-Hermel: Independence Movement list: 4 seats\n* South: MMFD list: 3 seats\n* Bekaa: Qadreen list: 2 seats\n* Nabatieh: Popular Bloc list: 3 seats\n* North Lebanon: Rifi Bloc list: 2 seats\n* Mount Lebanon: Lebanese Forces list: 2 seats\n\n**International reactions**\n\nThe international community welcomed the 2022 election as a step towards stability and democracy in Lebanon.

The dynasty's origins are shrouded in myth and legend, but they are believed to have emerged in the 9th century, during the reign of Rhodri Mawr, a king of Gwynedd who unified the Welsh kingdoms.\n\nThe Aberffraw dynasty's power base was centered in the cantref of Aberffraw, a region that encompassed much of present-day Anglesey and the surrounding areas. The cantref was a territorial division of the kingdom of Gwynedd, and its name is derived from the Old Welsh word \"ab erllys,\" meaning \"son of the lord\" or \"noble son.\"\n\n**Aberffraw hundred (cantref)**\n\nThe Aberffraw hundred, also known as the cantref of Aberffraw, was a territorial division of the kingdom of Gwynedd. The cantref was a self-contained unit, governed by a local prince or lord who was responsible for the administration of justice and taxation within the region. The Aberffraw hundred was a fertile and densely populated area, with a strong tradition of agriculture and trade.\n\nThe cantref was divided into smaller units, known as commotes, which were governed by local lords who were responsible for the administration of justice and taxation within their respective areas. The Aberffraw hundred was a major center of power and influence in medieval Wales, and its rulers played a significant role in shaping the country's history.\n\n**Welsh dynasties**\n\nThe Aberffraw dynasty was one of several powerful Welsh dynasties that emerged during the Middle Ages. Other notable Welsh dynasties included the House of Dinefwr, the House of Deheubarth, and the House of Powys. These dynasties often vied for power and influence with one another, resulting in a complex web of alliances and rivalries that shaped the course of Welsh history.\n\nThe Aberffraw dynasty was notable for its strong tradition of leadership and its commitment to the preservation of Welsh culture and identity. Its rulers were often patrons of the arts and literature, and they played a significant role in promoting the Welsh language and traditions.\n\n**Succession**\n\nThe succession of the Aberffraw dynasty was often marked by conflict and power struggles. The dynasty's rulers were frequently at odds with one another, and the throne was often contested by rival claimants. This led to a series of bloody conflicts and power struggles, which weakened the dynasty and ultimately contributed to its downfall.\n\nDespite these challenges, the Aberffraw dynasty continued to thrive for centuries, producing a succession of strong and capable leaders who played a significant role in shaping the course of Welsh history.\n\n**Cambro-Norse era**\n\nThe Cambro-Norse era was a period of significant cultural and economic change in Wales, marked by the arrival of the Normans and the introduction of feudalism. The Aberffraw dynasty was one of the few Welsh dynasties to survive this period intact, and its rulers played a significant role in resisting the Norman invasion.\n\nThe Cambro-Norse era saw the emergence of a new class of English-speaking landowners, who introduced new agricultural practices and economic systems to Wales. The Aberffraw dynasty was forced to adapt to these changes, and its rulers worked to preserve their power and influence in the face of the Norman threat.\n\n**Power base (Norman invasion)**\n\nThe Aberffraw dynasty's power base was severely disrupted by the Norman invasion of Wales, which began in the 12th century. The Normans introduced a new system of government and land tenure, which challenged the traditional authority of the Welsh princes.\n\nDespite these challenges, the Aberffraw dynasty managed to maintain its power and influence, thanks in part to the leadership of Llywelyn the Great, who ruled from 1194 to 1240. Llywelyn was a skilled politician and military leader who worked to preserve the independence of Wales and protect the rights of the Welsh people.\n\n**Aberffraw senior line**\n\nThe Aberffraw senior line was a branch of the Aberffraw dynasty that emerged in the 13th century. This line was descended from Llywelyn the Great and produced a succession of strong and capable leaders who played a significant role in shaping the course of Welsh history.\n\nThe Aberffraw senior line was notable for its commitment to the preservation of Welsh culture and identity. Its rulers were often patrons of the arts and literature, and they worked to promote the Welsh language and traditions.\n\n**Llys**\n\nThe llys was a type of medieval Welsh court that was used for administrative and judicial purposes. The llys was typically presided over by a local lord or prince, who was responsible for the administration of justice and taxation within the region.\n\nThe llys was an important institution in medieval Wales, and it played a significant role in the administration of justice and the collection of taxes. The Aberffraw dynasty's rulers often held llysoedd, which were used to administer justice and collect taxes within their respective regions.\n\n**Rhosyr**\n\nRhosyr was a commote in the cantref of Aberffraw, and it was an important center of power and influence in medieval Wales. The commote was governed by a local lord who was responsible for the administration of justice and taxation within the region.\n\nRhosyr was a fertile and densely populated area, and it was an important center of agriculture and trade. The commote was also home to a number of important monasteries and churches, which played a significant role in the preservation of Welsh culture and identity.\n\n**Aberffraw**\n\nAberffraw was the capital of the cantref of Aberffraw, and it was an important center of power and influence in medieval Wales. The town was governed by a local prince or lord who was responsible for the administration of justice and taxation within the region.\n\nAberffraw was a major center of trade and commerce, and it was an important hub of activity in the medieval Welsh economy. The town was also home to a number of important monasteries and churches, which played a significant role in the preservation of Welsh culture and identity.\n\n**Princes of Wales (de facto)**\n\nThe Aberffraw dynasty's rulers often served as de facto princes of Wales, exercising significant power and influence over the country's affairs. The dynasty's leaders were often patrons of the arts and literature, and they worked to promote the Welsh language and traditions.\n\nThe Aberffraw dynasty's rulers also played a significant role in shaping the course of Welsh history, often working to preserve the independence of Wales and protect the rights of the Welsh people.\n\n**Llywelyn the Great**\n\nLlywelyn the Great was a member of the Aberffraw dynasty who ruled from 1194 to 1240. He was a skilled politician and military leader who worked to preserve the independence of Wales and protect the rights of the Welsh people.\n\nLlywelyn was a significant figure in Welsh history, and his reign marked a high point in the power and influence of the Aberffraw dynasty.

The scandal, which began in 2021, involves allegations of repeated breaches of COVID-19 lockdown rules by senior government officials, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\n**Background**\n\n### COVID-19 lockdowns in the United Kingdom\n\nIn March 2020, the UK government implemented a series of lockdowns to slow the spread of COVID-19. The first lockdown, which began on 23 March 2020, prohibited gatherings of more than two people in public spaces and required people to stay at home unless absolutely necessary. The lockdown was later tightened in England, with the introduction of stricter rules on social gatherings and the closure of non-essential businesses.\n\n### Westminster\n\nThe UK's capital city, London, was particularly hard hit by the pandemic, with high rates of infection and death. The city's residents were subject to a series of lockdowns and restrictions, including the closure of pubs, restaurants, and other non-essential businesses.\n\n**Timeline of reporting and reaction**\n\n### 2021\n\n#### Up to 6 December\n\nIn the early stages of the pandemic, the UK government was criticized for its handling of the crisis, including the delayed implementation of lockdown measures and the lack of clear guidance on social distancing and mask-wearing. However, there were few allegations of breaches of lockdown rules at 10 Downing Street.\n\n#### Stratton video (7–8 December)\n\nOn 7 December 2021, a video emerged of senior government officials, including the Prime Minister, laughing and joking in a crowded room at 10 Downing Street, despite the ongoing lockdown. The video, which was captured by a Downing Street staffer, showed the officials celebrating with champagne and cake on a night when they were supposed to be working.\n\n#### 9 December onwards\n\nFollowing the release of the Stratton video, allegations of breaches of lockdown rules at 10 Downing Street began to mount. It was reported that the Prime Minister and other senior officials had attended a series of gatherings, including a lockdown-busting party on 20 May 2020, which was held to celebrate the Prime Minister's 56th birthday.\n\n### 2022\n\n#### Up to 19 January\n\nIn January 2022, the Daily Mirror newspaper reported that the Prime Minister had attended a series of lockdown-busting parties at 10 Downing Street, including a Christmas party in December 2020. The report sparked a wave of criticism from opposition politicians and the public, who accused the Prime Minister of breaching lockdown rules and hypocrisy.\n\n#### From 24 January\n\nFollowing the release of the Daily Mirror report, the Prime Minister was forced to apologize for attending the Christmas party, which he claimed he had not known was a party at the time. However, the apology did little to stem the criticism, with many calling for the Prime Minister to resign.\n\n#### After the conclusion of the police investigation\n\nIn July 2022, the Metropolitan Police announced that it had concluded its investigation into the Partygate scandal, issuing 126 fines to individuals, including the Prime Minister. The police also found that there had been a series of breaches of lockdown rules at 10 Downing Street, including the Christmas party in December 2020 and other gatherings in 2021.\n\n#### After the publication of Gray's report\n\nIn January 2023, the UK's Cabinet Office published a report into the Partygate scandal, written by senior civil servant Sue Gray. The report found that there had been a series of \"serious failures of leadership and judgment\" at the heart of the Prime Minister's office, including the failure to follow lockdown rules and the culture of \"excessive drinking\" and \"excessive staff socializing\" that pervaded the office.\n\n### 2023\n\n#### COVID-19 Inquiry evidence\n\nIn March 2023, the COVID-19 Inquiry, an independent inquiry into the UK government's response to the pandemic, published its first report. The report found that the government had been aware of the risks of COVID-19 and had failed to take adequate steps to prepare for the pandemic. The report also criticized the government's handling of the pandemic, including the delayed implementation of lockdown measures and the lack of clear guidance on social distancing and mask-wearing.\n\n#### June–October 2023\n\nIn the latter half of 2023, the Partygate scandal continued to dominate the headlines, with new allegations of breaches of lockdown rules emerging and the

The film tells the story of the United States space program and the astronauts who risked their lives to explore space. With unprecedented access to NASA archives and exclusive interviews with astronauts, \"To Fly!\" offers a unique perspective on the history of space exploration and the brave men and women who made it possible.\n\n**Summary**\n------------\n\n\"To Fly!\" is a comprehensive and visually stunning documentary that explores the early years of the United States space program. The film takes viewers on a journey through the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo missions, highlighting the challenges, triumphs, and sacrifices of the astronauts who dared to venture into space. From the pioneering efforts of Alan Shepard and John Glenn to the historic moon landing of Apollo 11, \"To Fly!\" is a tribute to the courage and ingenuity of those who pushed the boundaries of human knowledge and exploration.\n\n**Production**\n--------------\n\n### Background\n\nThe idea for \"To Fly!\" was born out of a collaboration between NASA and the Smithsonian Institution. In the mid-1990s, NASA began to digitize its extensive archives of footage and photographs from the early years of the space program.

The film stars Daniel Kaluuya, Keke Palmer, and Brandon Pinder, and follows a group of horse owners who try to capture evidence of a mysterious alien presence in the sky. Nope is the third film directed by Peele, after Get Out (2017) and Us (2019). The film premiered at the 2022 South by Southwest festival and was released in theaters on July 22, 2022.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place in the fictional town of Hawthorne, California, where a mysterious event is occurring in the sky. The event is described as a glowing, disk-shaped object that appears in the sky and seems to be watching the townspeople. The story follows a group of horse owners who are trying to capture evidence of the object, led by Otis \"OJ\" Haywood Jr. (Daniel Kaluuya) and Emerald Haywood (Keke Palmer), OJ's sister.\n\nAs the group tries to capture evidence of the object, they begin to experience strange and terrifying events, including a series of mysterious and gruesome deaths. The group soon realizes that the object is not just a curiosity, but a harbinger of a much larger and more sinister phenomenon.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features a talented cast, including:\n\n* Daniel Kaluuya as Otis \"OJ\" Haywood Jr.\n* Keke Palmer as Emerald Haywood\n* Brandon Pinder as Angel Torres\n* Steven Yeun as Ricky \"Jupe\" Park\n* Michael Wincott as Martin\n* Wrenn Schmidt as Amber\n* Keith David as Antlers Holst\n* Terry Notary as KRL-22 (voice)\n\n**Themes and interpretations**\n\nNope explores several themes, including the nature of reality, the power of technology, and the consequences of playing with forces beyond human control. The film also touches on issues of class, privilege, and the exploitation of marginalized communities.\n\nOne of the main interpretations of the film is that it is a commentary on the dangers of nostalgia and the fetishization of the past. The film's use of retrofuturistic imagery and 1970s-era sci-fi tropes serves as a commentary on the way that we often romanticize the past and fail to learn from its mistakes.\n\nAnother interpretation of the film is that it is a commentary on the ways in which technology can be used to control and manipulate people. The film's use of surveillance technology and data collection serves as a warning about the dangers of a society in which technology is used to monitor and control every aspect of our lives.\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nPeele began working on Nope in 2017, shortly after the release of Get Out. He spent several years developing the script and assembling a team of collaborators, including cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema and production designer Jean Rabasse.\n\n### Filming\n\nFilming on Nope began in August 2021 and took place over a period of several months. The film was shot on location in California and Nevada, using a combination of practical and digital effects.\n\n### Creature design\n\nThe creature design for Nope was created by legendary special effects artist Stan Winston's protégé, Todd Masters. The creature is a hybrid of different species, including a horse and a bird, and is designed to be a symbol of the unknown and the unknowable.\n\n### Costumes\n\nThe costumes for Nope were designed by Ruth E. Carter, who also designed the costumes for Get Out and Us. The costumes are a key element of the film's aesthetic, and are designed to reflect the characters' personalities and backgrounds.\n\n### Sound design\n\nThe sound design for Nope was created by Mary Ellen Matthews, who also worked on the sound design for Get Out and Us. The sound design is a key element of the film's tension and suspense, and is used to create a sense of unease and uncertainty.\n\n### Music\n\nThe music for Nope was composed by Michael Abels, who also composed the music for Get Out and Us. The score is a key element of the film's emotional impact, and is used to create a sense of tension and suspense.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nThe marketing campaign for Nope was launched in April 2022, with the release of a series of trailers and promotional materials. The campaign focused on building anticipation and excitement for the film, and used a combination of social media and online advertising to reach a wide audience.\n\n**Release**\n\nNope was released in theaters on July 22, 2022, in a limited release. The film was later expanded to a wider release in August 2022.\n\n**Reception**\n\nNope received widespread critical acclaim upon its release, with many critics praising its originality, suspense, and social commentary. The film holds a 91% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 422 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10.\n\nThe film was also a commercial success, grossing over $170 million worldwide on a budget of $68 million.\n\n**Accolades**\n\nNope won several awards and nominations, including:\n\n* Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay (Jordan Peele)\n* Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama (Daniel Kaluuya)\n* BAFTA nomination for Best Original Screenplay (Jordan Peele)\n* Critics' Choice Movie Award nomination for Best Sci-Fi/Fantasy Movie (Nope)\n\n**Possible sequels**\n\nThere have been rumblings of a potential sequel to Nope, although nothing has been officially announced by Jordan Peele or the film's producers. The film's ending sets up the possibility for a sequel, and many fans have speculated about the potential for a follow-up film.\n\n**Notes**\n\nNope is a thought-provoking and suspenseful film that explores themes of reality, technology, and the human condition. The film features a talented cast, stunning visuals, and a score that is both haunting and beautiful. With its originality, suspense, and social commentary, Nope is a must-see film for fans of science fiction, horror, and drama.\n\n**References**\n\n* (none)\n\n**External links**\n\n* Nope at IMDb\n* Nope at Rotten Tomatoes\n* Nope at Metacritic", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Nope_(film)\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Themes and interpretations\n#Production\n##Development\n##Filming\n##Creature design\n##Costumes\n##Sound design\n##Music\n#Marketing\n#Release\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#Possible sequels\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

His work spanned multiple institutions and fields, leaving a lasting impact on American historical scholarship.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\n### Upbringing\n\nDumas Malone was born on June 20, 1892, in Richmond, Virginia, to a family of modest means. His father, Henry Malone, was a civil engineer, and his mother, Mary Dumas Malone, was a homemaker. Malone's early life in Richmond had a profound influence on his later work, as he developed a deep appreciation for the history and culture of the American South.\n\n### Ministry and Yale\n\nMalone's family moved to Baltimore, Maryland, when he was a young boy. He attended Frederick Douglass High School and later enrolled at Yale University, where he studied history and literature. During his time at Yale, Malone became interested in the field of American history, particularly the colonial and revolutionary periods. After graduating in 1914, Malone decided to pursue a career in the ministry, but eventually returned to academia.\n\n**Career**\n\n### Virginia and the DAB\n\nIn 1915, Malone joined the faculty of the University of Virginia, where he taught history and worked on various projects, including the Dictionary of American Biography (DAB). As a member of the DAB's editorial board, Malone was responsible for writing and editing entries on a wide range of American historical figures. His work on the DAB helped establish him as a leading authority on American biography.\n\n### Harvard University Press\n\nIn 1920, Malone received a two-year fellowship from Harvard University, which allowed him to conduct research in the library's collections. During this time, he began working on a biography of Thomas Jefferson, which would become the focus of his career. Malone's work at Harvard also led to a close relationship with the press, which would eventually publish his biography of Jefferson.\n\n### Return to Virginia\n\nMalone returned to the University of Virginia in 1922, where he continued to teach and work on his biography of Jefferson. Over the next several decades, he became one of the most prominent historians in the country, known for his meticulous research and engaging writing style.\n\n**Legacy and Honors**\n\nMalone's biography of Thomas Jefferson, published in 1948, was a critical and commercial success, establishing him as one of the leading historians of his generation. The six-volume work, titled \"Jefferson and His Time,\" won numerous awards, including the Pulitzer Prize in 1950. Malone's other notable works include \"The Public Life of Thomas Jefferson\" and \"Thomas Jefferson: The Man and the Times.\"\n\nMalone's legacy extends beyond his own work.

The floods caused widespread damage and disruption, affecting thousands of people and resulting in significant economic losses.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Emilia-Romagna region is located in northern Italy, and it is known for its rich agricultural land and dense population. The region is also prone to flooding due to its proximity to the Adriatic Sea and the Po River, which flows through the region before emptying into the sea.\n\nThe flooding events of 2023 began on April 10, when heavy rainfall caused the rivers and streams in the region to overflow. The rain was part of a larger weather system that had been affecting the entire country, and it was particularly intense in the Emilia-Romagna region.\n\nOver the next few days, the flooding worsened, with many towns and cities in the region experiencing severe flooding. The towns of Ferrara, Ravenna, and Forlì were particularly affected, with water levels reaching as high as 3 meters in some areas.\n\n**Effects**\n\nThe flooding had a significant impact on the region, causing widespread damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure. Many people were forced to evacuate their homes, and some were left stranded due to the flooding.\n\nThe economic impact of the flooding was also significant, with estimates suggesting that the damage could exceed €1 billion. The region's agricultural industry was particularly affected, with many farms and fields flooded, resulting in significant losses for farmers.\n\n**Emilia Romagna Grand Prix**\n\nThe Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, a Formula One racing event, was scheduled to take place in Imola, a town in the region, on April 16. However, due to the flooding, the event was postponed and eventually rescheduled for May 21.\n\nThe postponement of the Grand Prix had a significant impact on the local economy, with many businesses and hotels affected by the loss of the event. However, the rescheduling of the event helped to boost the local economy in the following weeks.\n\n**Bruce Springsteen concert controversy**\n\nBruce Springsteen, a American musician, was scheduled to perform in Bologna, a city in the region, on April 18. However, due to the flooding, the concert was postponed and eventually rescheduled for June 10.\n\nHowever, some controversy arose when it was announced that Springsteen would be paid a significant fee for the rescheduled concert, despite the fact that many people in the region were still struggling to recover from the flooding.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe Italian government and local authorities responded quickly to the flooding, with emergency services and aid teams deployed to affected areas. The government also announced plans to provide financial assistance to those affected by the flooding.\n\nThe European Union also offered support to Italy, with the European Commission announcing a €100 million aid package to help with the relief efforts.\n\n**Humanitarian efforts**\n\nMany humanitarian organizations, including the Red Cross and the Italian Red Cross, responded to the flooding by providing aid and support to those affected. The organizations provided food, shelter, and medical care to those in need, as well as helped to distribute aid to affected communities.\n\n**See also**\n\n* 2023 European floods\n* Emilia-Romagna\n* Italy\n* European Union\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The article is based on information from various sources, including news reports and official statements.\n* The article does not include any information on the causes of the flooding, as the causes are still being investigated by authorities.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not include any references, as they are not required for a Wikipedia-style article.\n\n**External links**\n\n* European Commission: Italy floods 2023\n* Italian Red Cross: Emilia-Romagna floods\n* Red Cross: Emilia-Romagna floods", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Emilia-Romagna_floods\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#Effects\n##Emilia Romagna Grand Prix\n##Bruce Springsteen concert controversy\n#Reactions\n#Humanitarian efforts\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This movement is distinct from other Christian denominations and theological traditions, and its adherents often emphasize the need for a return to the original teachings and practices of the early Christian church.\n\n# History and Main Leaders\n\nReformed fundamentalism has its roots in the early 20th-century fundamentalist movement, which sought to preserve traditional Protestant and biblical theology in the face of modernist and liberal challenges. Key leaders of this movement included J. Gresham Machen, who advocated for a return to the authority of the Bible and the importance of orthodoxy in the Christian faith.\n\nThe modern Reformed fundamentalist movement can be traced to the 1950s and 1960s, when leaders such as Carl McIntire and R.J. Rushdoony began to articulate a distinctive theological vision that emphasized the importance of Reformed doctrine, biblical inerrancy, and the need for a return to the early Christian church. McIntire's Christian Anti-Communism Crusade and Rushdoony's Presbyterian Christian Education Fellowship were influential organizations that helped to shape the movement.\n\n# Theological Distinctives\n\n## Broader Conservative Evangelicalism\n\nReformed fundamentalism is a subset of conservative evangelicalism, which emphasizes the importance of personal conversion, biblical authority, and evangelism. However, Reformed fundamentalism has a distinct theology and practice that sets it apart from other conservative evangelical denominations.\n\n### Pertaining to Salvation and the Gospel\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of justification by faith alone, the sovereignty of God in salvation, and the centrality of the atonement in the gospel. They also stress the importance of regeneration and the necessity of a personal, conscious decision to accept Christ as Lord and Savior.\n\n### Other Fundamental Protestant and Biblical Theology\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of the authority of Scripture, the doctrine of the Trinity, and the importance of the Reformed confessions, such as the Westminster Confession of Faith. They also stress the importance of the sacraments, the Lord's Supper, and baptism.\n\n## The Inspiration and Preservation of the Scriptures\n\n### Verbal Plenary Inspiration\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the doctrine of verbal plenary inspiration, which holds that the Bible is the inspired, inerrant, and authoritative Word of God. They believe that the Bible is the complete and final revelation of God to humanity.\n\n### Preservation of the Texts of Scripture\n\nReformed fundamentalists also emphasize the importance of preserving the original texts of Scripture, as well as the importance of accurate translation and transmission of the Bible.\n\n## Common Principles of Reformation Evangelical Interpretation and Private Reading\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of private reading and interpretation of the Bible, as well as the importance of using the Reformed confessions and catechisms as guides for understanding the Bible.\n\n## The Classical Creeds and Reformational Confessions\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of the classical creeds, such as the Apostles' Creed and the Nicene Creed, as well as the Reformed confessions, such as the Westminster Confession of Faith.\n\n# Congregational Practices\n\nReformed fundamentalists often emphasize the importance of congregational worship, including the use of hymns, psalms, and the reading of Scripture. They also stress the importance of discipline and order in the church, as well as the importance of the local church as the primary institution for evangelism and discipleship.\n\n# Bible Translation and Usage\n\n## The Authorised Version Tradition, the Byzantine Received Text, and Eastern (Greek) and Western (Greco-Latin) Ecclesiastical Translation Traditions\n\nReformed fundamentalists often emphasize the importance of the Authorised Version (KJV) of the Bible, which is based on the Byzantine Received Text. They also stress the importance of the Eastern and Western ecclesiastical translation traditions, which emphasize the importance of accepting the Bible as the inspired, authoritative Word of God.\n\n## Modern Versions, Denominational Preferences and Translation Controversies\n\nReformed fundamentalists often emphasize the importance of using translations that are based on the original languages of the Bible, such as the Greek and Hebrew texts. They also stress the importance of avoiding translations that are based on modernist or liberal interpretations of the Bible.\n\n# Evangelical and Missional Apologetics\n\n## Bible Apologetics\n\nReformed fundamentalists often emphasize the importance of using the Bible as a tool for apologetics and evangelism. They emphasize the importance of using the Bible to defend the Christian faith and to present the gospel to non-Christians.\n\n# Liberal-Modernist Challenge to Verbal Inspiration and Truthfulness of Scripture\n\nReformed fundamentalists often emphasize the importance of maintaining the doctrine of verbal plenary inspiration and the authority of Scripture in the face of liberal-modernist challenges.\n\n# Modern Biblical Criticism\n\nReformed fundamentalists often emphasize the importance of using the historical-grammatical method of interpretation, which emphasizes the importance of understanding the original languages and cultural context of the Bible.\n\n# Modern Western Society and Intellectual Unbelief\n\n## Criticism of New-Neo Evangelicalism and the 'Present Downgrade'\n\nReformed fundamentalists often criticize new-Neo evangelicalism and the 'Present Downgrade', which emphasizes a more relaxed and modernized approach to the Christian faith.\n\n## Materialist and Naturalist Unbelief, and Historic Adamism and Creationism\n\nReformed fundamentalists often emphasize the importance of maintaining a historical Adam and a literal creation account in the face of modernist and naturalist unbelief.\n\n# See also\n\n* Conservative Christianity\n* Fundamentalism\n* Protestantism\n* Reformed theology\n\n# Resources\n\n* McIntire, C.

Griffith's writing career spanned several decades, during which he produced a significant body of work that captivated readers with its blend of science, adventure, and social commentary.\n\nEarly life\n\nGeorge Griffith was born on April 2, 1857, in Rockhampton, Queensland, Australia. His family moved to England when he was a child, and he spent his early years in the countryside. Griffith's education began at a local school and later continued at the University of London, where he developed a strong interest in science and literature.\n\nTeaching career\n\nGriffith's early career was marked by a period of teaching. He worked as a tutor and later as a lecturer at various institutions, including the University of London. During this time, Griffith developed a reputation as a skilled educator and writer. His teaching career provided him with a stable income and allowed him to pursue his writing interests in his free time.\n\nWriting career\n\nGriffith's writing career can be divided into several distinct periods.\n\nEarly career\n\nGriffith's early writing career was marked by a series of poetry collections and short stories. His first published work, a collection of poems titled \"Songs of the Army of the Night,\" appeared in 1888. Griffith's poetry was characterized by its focus on social commentary and its use of vivid imagery.\n\nBreakthrough\n\nGriffith's breakthrough as a novelist came with the publication of \"Olga Romanoff\" in 1894. This science fiction novel tells the story of a young woman who becomes embroiled in a plot to overthrow the Russian government. \"Olga Romanoff\" was a commercial success and helped establish Griffith as a major figure in the science fiction genre.\n\nMid-1890s\n\nThe mid-1890s saw Griffith produce a series of novels and short stories that built on the success of \"Olga Romanoff.\" Works such as \"The Angel of the Revolution\" and \"A Honeymoon in Space\" showcased Griffith's ability to craft engaging stories that combined science fiction with social commentary.\n\nDecline\n\nGriffith's writing output declined significantly in the early 20th century. Several factors contributed to this decline, including the rise of more popular science fiction writers and Griffith's own health problems. Despite this, Griffith continued to write and publish until his death in 1906.\n\nFinal years\n\nGriffith's final years were marked by a period of relative quiet. He continued to write and publish, but at a slower pace than in the past. Griffith's health problems had taken a significant toll, and he was forced to rely on the support of friends and family.\n\nDeath\n\nGeorge Griffith died on April 11, 1906, at the age of 49. His death was met with an outpouring of tributes from fans and fellow writers. Griffith's legacy as a pioneering science fiction writer continues to be celebrated today.\n\nLegacy\n\nGriffith's legacy can be seen in several areas.\n\nPlace in science fiction history\n\nGriffith is widely regarded as one of the pioneers of the science fiction genre. His works, such as \"Olga Romanoff\" and \"The Angel of the Revolution,\" helped establish science fiction as a major force in literature. Griffith's influence can be seen in the work of later science fiction writers, including H.G.

It is bordered by eight countries, including Greece and Bulgaria to the west, Georgia to the northeast, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran to the east, Iraq and Syria to the southeast, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. With a rich history dating back to ancient times, Turkey is a culturally and geographically unique country that straddles the Bosphorus Strait, which separates Europe and Asia.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name \"Turkey\" is derived from the Middle English term \"Turke,\" which was used to refer to the Turkic peoples who migrated from Central Asia to Anatolia in the 11th century. The Modern Turkish language, spoken by the vast majority of the population, is a member of the Oghuz branch of the Turkic languages. The name \"Türkiye\" was officially adopted in 1923, after the establishment of the Republic of Turkey.\n\n**History**\n\n### Prehistory and ancient history\n\nThe earliest human habitation in Turkey dates back to the Paleolithic era, with archaeological evidence showing the presence of various cultures, including the Neolithic and the Chalcolithic. The Hittite civilization, which flourished in central Anatolia between 1600 and 1178 BCE, is considered one of the most important ancient civilizations in Turkey. The Hittites developed a sophisticated culture, with a written language, a system of governance, and a complex pantheon of gods.\n\n### Early classical antiquity\n\nFollowing the decline of the Hittites, various ancient civilizations, including the Lydians, Phrygians, and Carians, emerged in western Anatolia. The Lydians, who ruled from 1200 to 546 BCE, were known for their wealth and their invention of coinage. The Phrygians, who ruled from 1200 to 346 BCE, developed a distinctive culture, with a strong emphasis on fertility goddesses and a complex system of governance.\n\n### Rome and Byzantine Empire\n\nIn the 3rd century BCE, Turkey came under the control of the Roman Empire, which ruled for several centuries. The Romans developed a sophisticated infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and aqueducts, and introduced Christianity to the region. The Byzantine Empire, which emerged in the 4th century CE, ruled over Turkey for over a thousand years, developing a distinctive culture, with a strong emphasis on Orthodox Christianity and a complex system of governance.\n\n### Seljuks and Anatolian beyliks\n\nIn the 11th century, the Seljuk Turks, who had migrated from Central Asia, established a series of beyliks in Anatolia. The Seljuks developed a strong military state, with a complex system of governance and a rich cultural heritage. The Anatolian beyliks, which emerged in the 12th century, were a series of Turkish principalities that emerged in western Anatolia.\n\n### Ottoman Empire\n\nIn the 13th century, the Ottoman Empire emerged in northwestern Anatolia, under the leadership of Osman Bey. The Ottomans developed a vast empire, which stretched from the Balkans to the Middle East, and became a major center of culture, trade, and learning. The Ottomans introduced various innovations, including the Turkish bath, the tulip, and the coffeehouse, and developed a distinctive art and architecture, including the iconic Süleymaniye Mosque.\n\n### Republic of Türkiye\n\nIn 1923, the Ottoman Empire was dissolved, and the Republic of Turkey was established, with Mustafa Kemal Atatürk as its first president. Atatürk introduced various reforms, including the adoption of the Latin alphabet, the separation of church and state, and the promotion of women's rights. The Republic of Turkey has since developed into a modern, secular state, with a strong economy and a rich cultural heritage.\n\n**Administrative divisions**\n\nTurkey is divided into 81 provinces, which are further divided into districts and municipalities. The provinces are grouped into seven regions, including the Marmara, Aegean, Mediterranean, Central Anatolia, Eastern Anatolia, Black Sea, and Southeastern Anatolia regions.\n\n**Government and politics**\n\n### Parties and elections\n\nTurkey has a multi-party system, with several major parties, including the Justice and Development Party (AKP), the Republican People's Party (CHP), and the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP). Elections are held regularly, with the president and the parliament being elected by popular vote.\n\n### Law\n\nThe Turkish legal system is based on the principle of the rule of law, with a written constitution and a complex system of laws and regulations. The Turkish penal code, which was introduced in 2004, has been criticized for its treatment of human rights and its emphasis on punishment.\n\n### Foreign relations\n\nTurkey has a complex system of foreign relations, with a strong emphasis on its membership in NATO and the European Union. Turkey has also developed strong relations with countries in the Middle East and Central Asia, including Iran, Russia, and Azerbaijan.\n\n### Military\n\nThe Turkish military is a major force in the country, with a strong emphasis on defense and security. The Turkish military has been involved in several conflicts, including the Cyprus dispute and the Syrian civil war.\n\n### Human rights\n\nTurkey has been criticized for its human rights record, particularly in the areas of freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and treatment of minorities. The Turkish government has also been accused of suppressing dissent and opposition.\n\n### LGBTQ rights\n\nTurkey has a complex and sometimes contradictory record on LGBTQ rights. While the Turkish government has taken steps to improve the rights of LGBTQ individuals, the country remains one of the most conservative in Europe, with a strong emphasis on traditional values.\n\n**Geography**\n\n### Biodiversity\n\nTurkey has a rich biodiversity, with a wide range of flora and fauna.

The protests were sparked by a combination of factors, including frustration with the lockdowns, economic hardship, and the perceived lack of transparency and accountability from the government.\n\n**Background**\n\n### COVID-19 Lockdowns in China\n\nChina's COVID-19 lockdown policies have been some of the strictest in the world, with widespread lockdowns, travel restrictions, and mass testing. The government's zero-COVID strategy aims to eradicate the virus entirely, but has resulted in significant economic and social costs. Many cities have been under lockdown for months, with residents facing food shortages, economic hardship, and isolation.\n\n### Democracy Movements in China\n\nChina has a long history of democracy movements, dating back to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. Since then, there have been numerous protests and movements calling for greater freedoms and human rights. However, the government has consistently suppressed these movements, often using force and violence to maintain control.\n\n### Sitong Bridge Protest\n\nThe Sitong Bridge protest in 2021 was a key event that sparked the 2022 protests. On May 26, 2021, a group of residents in the city of Wuhan staged a protest on Sitong Bridge, calling for greater freedoms and an end to the government's zero-COVID strategy.

The protest was focused on the company's treatment of workers, who had been subject to strict lockdown measures and poor working conditions.\n\n### Chongqing\n\nOn November 29, a group of residents in Chongqing staged a protest in the city's central square, calling for greater freedoms and an end to the government's zero-COVID strategy.\n\n**Escalation: Ürümqi Fire and Reaction**\n\n### 26 November\n\nThe situation escalated on November 26, when a fire broke out at an apartment complex in Ürümqi, the capital of Xinjiang province. The fire killed 10 people, and sparked widespread outrage and anger. Residents took to the streets, calling for greater accountability and an end to the government's zero-COVID strategy.\n\n#### Nanjing\n\nIn Nanjing, a group of residents staged a protest outside the city's government headquarters, calling for greater freedoms and an end to the lockdown.\n\n#### Lanzhou\n\nIn Lanzhou, residents staged a protest in the city's central square, calling for an end to the lockdown and greater freedoms.\n\n#### Shanghai\n\nIn Shanghai, residents staged a protest in the city's central business district, calling for an end to the lockdown and greater freedoms.\n\n#### Chengdu\n\nIn Chengdu, residents staged a protest in the city's central square, calling for an end to the lockdown and greater freedoms.\n\n#### Xi'an\n\nIn Xi'an, residents staged a protest in the city's central square, calling for an end to the lockdown and greater freedoms.\n\n#### Korla\n\nIn Korla, a group of residents staged a protest outside the city's government headquarters, calling for greater accountability and an end to the government's zero-COVID strategy.\n\n### 27 November\n\n#### Shanghai\n\nIn Shanghai, residents staged a protest in the city's central business district, calling for an end to the lockdown and greater freedoms.\n\n#### Beijing\n\nIn Beijing, residents staged a protest in the city's central square, calling for greater freedoms and an end to the government's zero-COVID strategy.\n\n#### Wuhan\n\nIn Wuhan, residents staged a protest in the city's central square, calling for an end to the lockdown and greater freedoms.\n\n#### Hong Kong\n\nIn Hong Kong, residents staged a protest in the city's central business district, calling for greater freedoms and an end to the government's zero-COVID strategy.\n\n### 28 November\n\n#### Shanghai\n\nIn Shanghai, residents staged a protest in the city's central business district, calling for an end to the lockdown and greater freedoms.\n\n#### Hong Kong\n\nIn Hong Kong, residents staged a protest in the city's central business district, calling for greater freedoms and an end to the government's zero-COVID strategy.\n\n#### Hangzhou\n\nIn Hangzhou, residents staged a protest in the city's central square, calling for an end to the lockdown and greater freedoms.\n\n#### Beijing\n\nIn Beijing, residents staged a protest in the city's central square, calling for greater freedoms and an end to the government's zero-COVID strategy.\n\n### 29 November\n\n#### Jinan\n\nIn Jinan, residents staged a protest in the city's central square, calling for an end to the lockdown and greater freedoms.\n\n#### Guangzhou\n\nIn Guangzhou, residents staged a protest in the city's central business district, calling for an end to the lockdown and greater freedoms.\n\n### 30 November\n\nOn November 30, the government announced that it would relax some of the lockdown measures, allowing residents to leave their homes and engage in economic activities.

The European Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom were among the countries that expressed concern over the government's handling of the situation.\n\n**Censorship and Resistance**\n\n### Pro-government responses\n\nThe government responded to the protests by increasing censorship and cracking down on dissent.

The storm formed in the Atlantic Ocean and strengthened into a hurricane before making landfall in Cuba. Idalia's impact was significant, causing widespread damage and disruption to communities in its path.\n\n# Meteorological history\nHurricane Idalia formed on August 10, 2023, in the central tropical Atlantic Ocean, approximately 1,000 miles (1,600 km) east-southeast of the Lesser Antilles. The system was a tropical disturbance that had been monitored by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) for several days prior to its development. At 11:00 AM AST (15:00 UTC), the disturbance had organized into a tropical depression, with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph (45 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 1006 mbar (29.71 inHg).\n\nAs the tropical depression moved west-northwestward, it encountered favorable conditions for intensification, including warm ocean waters and low wind shear. On August 12, the system strengthened into a tropical storm, with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 994 mbar (29.36 inHg). The storm was named Idalia by the NHC, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season.\n\nIdalia continued to strengthen over the next 24 hours, with the storm's maximum sustained winds reaching 120 mph (195 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 960 mbar (28.35 inHg). At this point, Idalia was classified as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.\n\n## Cuba\nAs Idalia approached Cuba, the government issued a hurricane warning for the island's eastern provinces, including Santiago de Cuba and Granma. Residents were advised to take necessary precautions, including boarding up windows and stocking up on food and water.\n\nOn August 14, Idalia made landfall in southeastern Cuba, near the town of Baracoa, with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (225 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 950 mbar (28.05 inHg). The storm caused widespread damage and flooding in the region, with reports of roofs torn off buildings and power lines downed.\n\n## United States\n### Florida\nAs Idalia moved northward, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane warning for the southeastern coast of Florida, including the Florida Keys and parts of Miami-Dade County. Residents were advised to evacuate low-lying areas and seek higher ground.\n\nOn August 16, Idalia made landfall in southwestern Florida, near the town of Everglades City, with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 970 mbar (28.64 inHg). The storm caused significant damage and flooding in the region, with reports of widespread power outages and property damage.\n\n### Elsewhere\nIdalia's outer rain bands extended into Georgia, where the storm caused significant rainfall and coastal flooding. The National Weather Service issued flash flood warnings for several counties in the state, with reports of isolated tornadoes also possible.\n\n## Bermuda\nAs Idalia moved northward, the Bermuda Weather Service issued a tropical storm warning for the island, with residents advised to take necessary precautions. On August 17, Idalia passed within 200 miles (320 km) of Bermuda, causing strong winds and heavy rainfall. The storm caused some damage and disruption to the island, but no major injuries or fatalities were reported.\n\n# Impact\n## Caribbean\nIdalia's impact was significant in the Caribbean, particularly in Cuba, where the storm caused widespread damage and flooding. The storm's effects were also felt in the Bahamas, where the outer rain bands caused significant rainfall and coastal flooding.\n\n## United States\n### Florida\nIdalia's impact in Florida was significant, with the storm causing widespread damage and flooding in the southwestern part of the state. The storm's effects were also felt in other parts of the state, including Miami-Dade County, where the outer rain bands caused significant rainfall and coastal flooding.\n\n### Georgia\nIdalia's outer rain bands extended into Georgia, causing significant rainfall and coastal flooding. The National Weather Service issued flash flood warnings for several counties in the state, with reports of isolated tornadoes also possible.\n\n### South Carolina\nIdalia's effects were also felt in South Carolina, where the storm caused significant rainfall and coastal flooding. The National Weather Service issued flash flood warnings for several counties in the state.\n\n### North Carolina\nIdalia's outer rain bands extended into North Carolina, causing significant rainfall and coastal flooding. The National Weather Service issued flash flood warnings for several counties in the state.\n\n### Elsewhere\nIdalia's impact was also felt in other parts of the country, including the Carolinas and Virginia, where the storm caused significant rainfall and coastal flooding.\n\n## Bermuda\nIdalia's impact in Bermuda was relatively minor, with the storm causing some damage and disruption to the island. However, the storm's effects were felt in other parts of the country, including the southeastern United States.\n\n# Aftermath\n## United States\n### Florida\nIn the aftermath of Idalia, the state of Florida declared a state of emergency, with the governor activating the National Guard to assist with relief efforts. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) also deployed personnel to the state to assist with response and recovery efforts.\n\n### Georgia\nIn the aftermath of Idalia, the state of Georgia also declared a state of emergency, with the governor activating the National Guard to assist with relief efforts.

The group has undergone several iterations and changes over the years, but its core focus has remained on the familial relationships and dynamics between its members.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Bloodline's concept is heavily rooted in Polynesian culture and the idea of a close-knit family unit. The group's storylines often revolve around themes of loyalty, respect, and the bonds of family, drawing heavily from Samoan and Tongan traditions. This cultural emphasis has been a key aspect of the group's identity and has helped to set it apart from other professional wrestling stables.\n\n**History**\n\n### The Usos' feud with The Shield (2013–2014)\n\nThe Bloodline's roots can be traced back to the early days of The Usos, a tag team consisting of brothers Jimmy and Jey Uso. The Usos began feuding with The Shield, a dominant faction in WWE at the time, in 2013. The Usos' storyline with The Shield was marked by a significant increase in their popularity and exposure, as they began to establish themselves as a force to be reckoned with in the WWE.\n\n### Occasional team-ups (2015–2020)\n\nFollowing their feud with The Shield, The Usos continued to compete as a tag team, occasionally teaming up with other wrestlers in the WWE. During this period, they also began to establish a rivalry with other factions, including The Wyatt Family and The New Day.\n\n### Roman Reigns' leadership (2020–2024)\n\nIn 2020, Roman Reigns, a WWE superstar of Samoan descent, began to play a significant role in the storyline of The Bloodline. Reigns, who had previously competed as a solo performer, began to build a family unit around himself, incorporating The Usos and other wrestlers into his storyline.\n\n#### Official Formation of The Bloodline (2020–2021)\n\nThe Bloodline officially formed in 2020, with Roman Reigns at the helm. The group's early days were marked by a series of promotional events and storyline matches, as Reigns and The Usos began to establish themselves as a dominant force in the WWE.\n\n#### All champions, rivalry with The New Day (2021–2022)\n\nIn 2021, The Bloodline achieved a significant milestone when all three members of the group (Reigns, The Usos, and Paul Heyman) held a championship title in the WWE. This led to a rivalry with The New Day, a faction that had also achieved similar success. The rivalry between The Bloodline and The New Day was marked by a series of intense matches and storyline developments.\n\n#### Induction of Sami Zayn and Solo Sikoa (2022–2023)\n\nIn 2022, Sami Zayn and Solo Sikoa, a young wrestler of Samoan descent, were inducted into The Bloodline. Zayn's addition to the group marked a significant shift in the storyline, as he began to play a key role in the group's dynamics.\n\n#### Bloodline Civil War (2023)\n\nIn 2023, The Bloodline was rocked by a civil war, as internal tensions and conflicts began to arise within the group. The storyline was marked by a series of intense matches and dramatic developments, as the group struggled to maintain its unity.\n\n#### Addition of The Rock and feud with Cody Rhodes (2023–2024)\n\nIn 2023, Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, a WWE superstar and cousin of Roman Reigns, made a surprise return to the WWE. Johnson's return was marked by a significant increase in popularity and attention, as he began to play a key role in The Bloodline's storyline. The group's feud with Cody Rhodes, a WWE superstar and member of the Rhodes family, was a significant aspect of the storyline, marked by a series of intense matches and dramatic developments.\n\n## Solo Sikoa's leadership (2024–present)\n\nIn 2024, Solo Sikoa, a young wrestler of Samoan descent, took over as leader of The Bloodline. Sikoa's leadership marked a significant shift in the group's dynamics, as he began to establish a new direction for the group.\n\n#### Additions of The Tongans and Jacob Fatu (2024)\n\nIn 2024, The Tongans, a group of wrestlers from Tonga, were added to The Bloodline. Jacob Fatu, a wrestler of Tongan descent, also joined the group, marking a significant increase in the group's Polynesian representation.\n\n#### Bloodline Civil War II (2024–present)\n\nIn 2024, The Bloodline was once again rocked by a civil war, as internal tensions and conflicts began to arise within the group. The storyline is ongoing, marked by a series of intense matches and dramatic developments, as the group struggles to maintain its unity.\n\n**Members**\n\n### Current\n\n* Roman Reigns\n* The Usos (Jimmy Uso and Jey Uso)\n* Sami Zayn\n* Solo Sikoa\n* The Tongans (various members)\n* Jacob Fatu\n\n### Former\n\n* Paul Heyman\n* The New Day (various members)\n\n**Timeline**\n\n* 2013: The Usos begin feuding with The Shield\n* 2015: The Usos team up with other wrestlers in the WWE\n* 2020: Roman Reigns begins to build a family unit around himself\n* 2021: The Bloodline officially forms, with Roman Reigns at the helm\n* 2022: Sami Zayn and Solo Sikoa are inducted into The Bloodline\n* 2023: The Bloodline is rocked by a civil war\n* 2023: Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson returns to the WWE and joins The Bloodline\n* 2024: Solo Sikoa takes over as leader of The Bloodline\n* 2024: The Tongans and Jacob Fatu join The Bloodline\n* 2024: The Bloodline is once again rocked by a civil war\n\n**Sub-groups**\n\n### Current\n\n* The Tongans\n* The Usos\n\n### Former\n\n* The Shield\n* The Wyatt Family\n* The New Day\n\n**Championships and accomplishments**\n\n* WWE Universal Championship\n* WWE Championship\n* WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship\n* WWE Raw Tag Team Championship\n\n**Other media**\n\n* The Bloodline has been featured in various WWE digital media, including WWE Network exclusive content and social media promotions.\n\n**See also**\n\n* WWE\n* Professional wrestling\n* Samoan wrestling\n* Tongan wrestling\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The Bloodline's storyline is heavily influenced by Samoan and Tongan culture and traditions.\n* The group's concept is centered around the idea of a close-knit family unit.\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: This article does not include any citations or references, as the information is based on publicly available data and WWE storyline developments.)\n\n**External links**\n\n* WWE Website\n* WWE Network\n* WWE Social Media", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"The_Bloodline_(professional_wrestling)\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#History\n##The Usos' feud with The Shield (2013–2014)\n##Occasional team-ups (2015–2020)\n##Roman Reigns' leadership (2020–2024)\n###Official Formation of The Bloodline (2020–2021)\n###All champions, rivalry with The New Day (2021–2022)\n###Induction of Sami Zayn and Solo Sikoa (2022–2023)\n###Bloodline Civil War (2023)\n###Addition of The Rock and feud with Cody Rhodes (2023–2024)\n##Solo Sikoa's leadership (2024–present)\n###Additions of The Tongans and Jacob Fatu (2024)\n###Bloodline Civil War II (2024–present)\n#Members\n##Current\n##Former\n#Timeline\n#Sub-groups\n##Current\n##Former\n#Championships and accomplishments\n#Other media\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The incident resulted in the loss of all five lives on board, sparking widespread shock and outrage in the scientific community, the public, and the media.\n\n**Background**\n\n### OceanGate\n\nOceanGate Expeditions is a private company based in the United States that specializes in underwater exploration and tourism. The company offers luxury expeditions to explore historic shipwrecks, including the Titanic. OceanGate's vessels are designed to accommodate paying customers, as well as scientists and researchers, on deep-sea dives.\n\n### Titanic\n\nThe RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the early morning of April 15, 1912, after colliding with an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. The Titanic sank in the North Atlantic Ocean, resulting in the loss of more than 1,500 lives. The wreck of the Titanic was discovered in 1985 by a French-American expedition led by Dr. Robert Ballard. Since then, several expeditions have visited the wreck site, but the site has also been the subject of controversy, with concerns raised about the impact of tourism on the wreck.\n\n**Submersible Titan**\n\nThe Titan was a deep-sea submersible vessel designed and manufactured by Triton Submarines, a company based in Florida. The vessel was commissioned by OceanGate Expeditions for use on its luxury expeditions to the Titanic wreck site. The Titan was capable of diving to depths of up to 12,500 meters (41,000 feet) and was equipped with state-of-the-art life support systems, navigation, and communication equipment.\n\n### Dives to wreck of Titanic\n\nThe Titan had made several successful dives to the Titanic wreck site prior to the incident, ferrying passengers and crew to the wreck for observation and exploration. The vessel had become a popular choice for tourists and researchers seeking to experience the Titanic wreck site firsthand.\n\n### Safety\n\nOceanGate Expeditions and Triton Submarines had implemented numerous safety protocols and procedures to ensure the safe operation of the Titan. The vessel was equipped with emergency beacons, emergency oxygen supplies, and communication equipment. The crew and passengers were also trained in emergency procedures and protocols.\n\n### Prior concerns\n\nIn the months leading up to the incident, there were several concerns raised about the safety of the Titan and OceanGate Expeditions' operations. Some experts questioned the company's ability to manage the risks associated with deep-sea diving and the impact of tourism on the Titanic wreck site.\n\n### Previous incidents\n\nIn the years prior to the incident, there were several reported incidents involving the Titan and OceanGate Expeditions. These incidents included equipment failures, communication malfunctions, and near-miss accidents.\n\n**Incident**\n\n### Expedition arrangements\n\nOn June 16, 2023, the Titan embarked on a luxury expedition to the Titanic wreck site, carrying five passengers, including a filmmaker, a historian, and three paying customers. The expedition was scheduled to last several days, with multiple dives planned to the wreck site.\n\n### 16–17 June preparations\n\nOn the evening of June 16, the Titan's crew completed final preparations for the dive, including checking the vessel's systems, loading supplies, and conducting safety drills.\n\n### 18 June, dive, disappearance, and implosion\n\nOn June 18, the Titan descended to the Titanic wreck site, but contact with the vessel was lost shortly after arrival. Despite extensive search efforts, the Titan was never recovered, and all on board were presumed dead. An investigation later revealed that the vessel had imploded, causing the loss of all lives on board.\n\n### 18–22 June, search and rescue efforts\n\nFollowing the loss of contact with the Titan, a massive search and rescue effort was launched by the United States Coast Guard, the Canadian Coast Guard, and other agencies. The search operation involved multiple vessels, aircraft, and submersibles, but no signs of the Titan or its crew were found.\n\n### 22 June, discovery of debris\n\nOn June 22, debris from the Titan was discovered on the seafloor, including the vessel's wreckage and personal effects of the crew and passengers.\n\n### Fatalities\n\nThe five passengers on board the Titan were all pronounced dead, with the cause of death attributed to the implosion of the vessel.\n\n**Recovery operations**\n\nThe recovery of the Titan's wreckage and personal effects from the seafloor was a complex and challenging operation, involving multiple agencies and vessels. The recovery operation was carried out over several weeks, with the wreckage finally recovered on July 15, 2023.\n\n**Investigations**\n\n### United States\n\nThe United States National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) led the investigation into the incident, with support from the United States Coast Guard, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and other agencies. The investigation was focused on determining the cause of the implosion and the failure of the Titan's safety systems.\n\n### Canada\n\nThe Canadian Transportation Safety Board (TSB) also conducted an investigation into the incident, with a focus on the safety implications for the tourism industry and the Titanic wreck site.\n\n**Lawsuit**\n\nIn the aftermath of the incident, a lawsuit was filed by the families of the passengers on board the Titan, seeking compensation for their loss.\n\n**Financial costs of operations**\n\nThe financial costs of the incident were significant, with estimates suggesting that the recovery operation alone cost over $100 million. The incident also had a significant impact on the tourism industry, with many expeditions to the Titanic wreck site canceled or postponed.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe incident sparked widespread shock and outrage in the scientific community, the public, and the media. The incident raised questions about the safety of deep-sea diving and the impact of tourism on historic sites.\n\n**In social and mass media**\n\nThe incident was widely covered in social and mass media, with many outlets providing real-time updates and analysis. The incident also sparked a global conversation about the risks and benefits of deep-sea diving and the tourism industry.\n\n**See also**\n\n* RMS Titanic\n* OceanGate Expeditions\n* Triton Submarines\n* Deep-sea diving\n* Underwater tourism\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on publicly available information and may not reflect the full extent of the incident or the investigations that followed.\n\n**References**\n\nNone.\n\n**External links**\n\n* National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)\n* Canadian Transportation Safety Board (TSB)\n* OceanGate Expeditions\n* Triton Submarines", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Titan_submersible_implosion\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##OceanGate\n##Titanic\n#Submersible Titan\n##Dives to wreck of Titanic\n##Safety\n##Prior concerns\n##Previous incidents\n#Incident\n##Expedition arrangements\n##16–17 June preparations\n##18 June, dive, disappearance, and implosion\n##18–22 June, search and rescue efforts\n##22 June, discovery of debris\n##Fatalities\n#Recovery operations\n#Investigations\n##United States\n##Canada\n#Lawsuit\n#Financial costs of operations\n#Reactions\n#In social and mass media\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The earthquake was a significant seismic event that caused widespread damage and disruption to the region.\n\n**Tectonic Setting**\n\nThe 2022 Fukushima earthquake occurred in a region of high seismic activity, where the Pacific plate is being subducted beneath the North American plate. This process, known as subduction, is responsible for the formation of the Japanese island arc and the creation of deep-sea trenches. The region is characterized by a complex system of faults, including the Fukushima-Nanokaichi fault, which runs along the coast of Fukushima Prefecture.\n\nThe Japanese island arc is a region of high volcanic and seismic activity, with numerous earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occurring throughout the country's history. The Fukushima earthquake was a significant event in this region, highlighting the ongoing tectonic processes that shape Japan's geology.\n\n**Earthquake**\n\nThe 2022 Fukushima earthquake was a magnitude 6.2 earthquake that occurred at 22:03 local time on August 19, 2022. The epicenter of the earthquake was located in the Fukushima Prefecture, approximately 50 kilometers east of the city of Fukushima. The earthquake was a shallow event, with a depth of approximately 10 kilometers.\n\nThe earthquake was characterized by a series of strong tremors, with reports of buildings shaking violently and objects falling from shelves. The earthquake was also accompanied by a series of aftershocks, which continued to occur in the days and weeks following the initial event.\n\n**Intensity**\n\nThe intensity of the earthquake was measured in various locations throughout the Fukushima Prefecture. In the city of Fukushima, the intensity was reported to be as high as 4 on the JMA seismic intensity scale, which is equivalent to a Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) of VI. In other locations, the intensity was reported to be as low as 1 on the JMA scale, with no damage or injuries reported.\n\nThe earthquake was also felt in other parts of Japan, including the Tokyo metropolitan area, where the intensity was reported to be as low as 1 on the JMA scale.\n\n**Long Period Ground Motion**\n\nThe 2022 Fukushima earthquake was characterized by a long period ground motion, which is a type of seismic motion that occurs at frequencies of less than 0.05 Hz. This type of motion is often associated with earthquakes that occur in sedimentary basins, where the soil and sediment can amplify the seismic motion.\n\nThe long period ground motion in the 2022 Fukushima earthquake was reported to be as high as 10 seconds, which is significantly longer than the typical short period ground motion that occurs in earthquakes. This type of motion can cause significant damage to buildings and infrastructure, particularly those that are not designed to withstand such long period motions.\n\n**Tsunami**\n\nA tsunami warning was issued for the Fukushima Prefecture following the earthquake, as there were concerns that a tsunami could occur due to the earthquake's magnitude and location. However, the tsunami warning was later downgraded to a tsunami advisory, as the tsunami waves that did occur were not as large as predicted.\n\nThe tsunami waves that did occur were reported to be as high as 1 meter in some locations, with reports of coastal flooding and damage to coastal infrastructure. However, the tsunami waves were not as severe as predicted, and the damage was relatively limited.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe 2022 Fukushima earthquake had a significant impact on the region, with reports of widespread damage to buildings, infrastructure, and the environment. In the city of Fukushima, the earthquake caused significant damage to buildings, including schools, hospitals, and commercial buildings.\n\n**Schools**\n\nThe earthquake caused significant damage to schools in the Fukushima Prefecture, including the Fukushima Prefectural High School, which was severely damaged and had to be evacuated. Other schools in the region also reported damage, including broken windows, damaged roofs, and cracked walls.\n\n**Commercial Business and Industrial Sector**\n\nThe earthquake had a significant impact on the commercial business and industrial sector in the Fukushima Prefecture, with reports of damage to factories, warehouses, and other industrial facilities. The earthquake also caused disruptions to the supply chain, with reports of delayed shipments and cancelled orders.\n\n**Power Outages**\n\nThe earthquake caused widespread power outages in the Fukushima Prefecture, with reports of over 100,000 households losing electricity. The power outages were caused by damage to power lines and substations, as well as a loss of generation capacity.\n\n**Transportation**\n\nThe earthquake caused disruptions to transportation in the Fukushima Prefecture, with reports of delayed trains and buses. The earthquake also caused damage to roads and highways, with reports of landslides and debris blocking roads.\n\n**Casualties**\n\nFortunately, there were no reported fatalities or serious injuries in the 2022 Fukushima earthquake. However, the earthquake did cause significant disruption and damage to the region, with reports of over $100 million in damages.\n\n**Response**\n\nThe response to the 2022 Fukushima earthquake was led by the Japanese government, with support from local authorities and emergency responders. The Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA) issued a tsunami warning for the Fukushima Prefecture, which was later downgraded to a tsunami advisory.\n\n**Earthquake and Tsunami Advisory**\n\nThe JMA issued a tsunami advisory for the Fukushima Prefecture, which warned of the potential for a tsunami to occur due to the earthquake's magnitude and location. The advisory was issued to inform the public of the potential risk and to encourage evacuation of coastal areas.\n\n**Domestic**\n\nThe Japanese government quickly responded to the earthquake, with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida declaring a state of emergency in the Fukushima Prefecture. The government also deployed emergency responders, including firefighters and rescue teams, to assist in the response efforts.\n\n**International**\n\nThe international community also responded to the earthquake, with the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) and other international organizations offering support and assistance. The Japanese government also received offers of support from other countries, including the United States, China, and South Korea.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of earthquakes in Japan\n* List of tsunamis\n* Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: This article does not include any citations or references, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Fukushima_earthquake\" following this outline:\n\n#Tectonic setting\n#Earthquake\n##Intensity\n##Long period ground motion\n#Tsunami\n#Impact\n##Schools\n##Commercial business and industrial sector\n##Power outages\n##Transportation\n#Casualties\n#Response\n##Earthquake and tsunami advisory\n##Domestic\n##International\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is characterized by low-budget, often art-house films that often focus on social commentary, character studies, and experimental storytelling. Indiewood films often have a unique tone and style, blending elements of art-house, drama, and comedy.\n\nIndiewood films often have a lower production budget than major Hollywood productions, which allows for greater creative freedom and experimentation. This has led to the development of a distinct aesthetic and style, often characterized by a more nuanced and character-driven approach to storytelling.\n\n**Divisions**\n\nIndiewood can be further divided into several subgenres and styles, including:\n\n* **Pre-Indiewood**: Films produced before the 1970s that share similar characteristics with Indiewood films, such as low budgets and experimental storytelling.\n* **Low-budget Indies**: Films produced on extremely low budgets, often with limited resources and a DIY approach.\n* **Indiewood Blockbusters**: Films that achieve mainstream success and higher budgets, often blurring the lines between Indiewood and mainstream cinema.\n* **Indie Drama**: Films that focus on character studies and social commentary, often with a more serious tone.\n* **Indie Comedies**: Films that use humor to explore social issues and character relationships.\n\n**Other \"mini-major\" subdivisions/indie distributors**\n\nSeveral other companies and distributors have emerged to support the production and distribution of Indiewood films, including:\n\n* **Miramax**: Founded in 1979, Miramax became one of the most prominent distributors of Indiewood films, releasing titles such as _Sex, Lies, and Videotape_ and _Pulp Fiction_.\n* **New Line Cinema**: Founded in 1967, New Line Cinema has released a number of Indiewood titles, including _The Blair Witch Project_ and _Donnie Darko_.\n* **Lionsgate**: Founded in 1997, Lionsgate has become a leading distributor of Indiewood films, releasing titles such as _Crash_ and _Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan_.\n* **IFC**: Founded in 1994, IFC (Independent Film Channel) has become a leading distributor of Indiewood films, releasing titles such as _The Station Agent_ and _The Trip_.\n\n**Differences from Hollywood**\n\nIndiewood films often differ from mainstream Hollywood productions in several key ways:\n\n* **Budget**: Indiewood films are often produced on lower budgets, which allows for greater creative freedom and experimentation.\n* **Tone**: Indiewood films often have a more nuanced and character-driven approach to storytelling, which can be more subtle and less bombastic than mainstream Hollywood films.\n* **Style**: Indiewood films often blend elements of art-house, drama, and comedy, which can create a unique and distinctive aesthetic.\n* **Distribution**: Indiewood films are often released in limited release, which can make them harder to find and access.\n\n**List of selected Indiewood/Pre-Indiewood filmmakers**\n\n* **John Cassavetes**: Known for his low-budget, character-driven films such as _Shadows_ and _A Woman Under the Influence_.\n* **John Sayles**: Known for his socially conscious films such as _The Brother from Another Planet_ and _Eight Men Out_.\n* **Jim Jarmusch**: Known for his experimental and offbeat films such as _Stranger Than Paradise_ and _Down by Law_.\n* **Richard Linklater**: Known for his innovative and experimental films such as _Slacker_ and _Dazed and Confused_.\n* **Spike Jonze**: Known for his innovative and quirky films such as _Being John Malkovich_ and _Her_.\n\n**List of selected notable and important Pre-Indiewood films**\n\n### Pre-1950s\n\n* **The Gold Rush** (1925) -

This conflict is a manifestation of Russia's broader information operations, which have been ongoing since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The war has been characterized by a range of tactics, including censorship, control of news outlets, disinformation, and the use of social media to shape public opinion.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Doctrine\n\nThe Russian information war against Ukraine is rooted in the country's doctrine of \"information warfare.\" This doctrine views information as a key component of military power, and seeks to use it to achieve strategic goals. The Russian military has developed a range of tactics and techniques to achieve these goals, including the use of disinformation, propaganda, and cyber warfare.\n\n### Reasons for the conflict\n\n#### Revanchism\n\nOne of the primary drivers of the Russian information war against Ukraine is revanchism – the desire to restore Russia's influence and power in the region. This desire is rooted in a sense of historical grievance, and a belief that Ukraine is a core part of Russia's cultural and geographical identity.\n\n#### History of the war\n\nThe Russian information war against Ukraine has a long history, dating back to the early 1990s. However, it has intensified since the Maidan Revolution in 2014, which saw Ukraine's pro-Russian government overthrown and replaced by a pro-European government.

This has included the use of friendly journalists and public relations experts to promote its narrative, as well as the use of social media to shape public opinion.\n\n#### Ukraine\n\nThe Ukrainian government has been the primary target of Russia's information war. The Russian government has sought to undermine Ukraine's sovereignty and independence through a range of information operations, including censorship, disinformation, and propaganda.\n\n#### Russia\n\nThe Russian government has also used information operations to promote its own narrative and undermine criticism of its actions. This has included the use of state-controlled media, social media, and disinformation.\n\n#### RT\n\nThe Russian government has also used its state-controlled media outlet, RT, to promote its narrative and undermine criticism of its actions. RT has been a key component of Russia's information war against Ukraine, and has been used to promote a range of disinformation narratives.\n\n### Russian interference with Ukrainian media\n\nThe Russian government has also sought to interfere with Ukraine's media landscape.

From ancient mythologies to modern-day novels and films, fantasy has evolved over time, influenced by various cultural, social, and literary movements. This article will explore the differences between fantasy and earlier fantastic works, the development of the genre, and its modern evolution.\n\n**Differences between fantasy and earlier fantastic works**\n\nWhile fantasy is often associated with magical or supernatural elements, it is distinct from earlier fantastic works that often featured mythological or supernatural themes. In ancient mythologies, such as Greek and Roman mythology, fantastical creatures and events were used to explain natural phenomena or to provide moral lessons. These works were not necessarily fictional in the modern sense, but rather a way to understand the world and the human condition.\n\nIn contrast, fantasy as a genre emerged in the Middle Ages with the development of chivalric romances, which featured magical and supernatural elements in a narrative framework. These works were often set in a fictional world, such as the kingdom of Arthurian legend, and featured magical creatures, quests, and battles.\n\n**Development of fantasy**\n\nThe development of fantasy as a genre can be broadly divided into several periods, including the romances, the Enlightenment, and Romanticism.\n\n### **Romances**\n\nThe romances, which emerged in the 12th century, were a type of narrative poetry that told the story of a heroic quest or a romantic love affair. These works often featured magical and supernatural elements, such as dragons, knights, and castles. The romances were influenced by the oral traditions of the Middle Ages, where stories were passed down through generations by word of mouth.\n\nOne of the most famous romances is Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur, which tells the story of King Arthur and his knights. This work features many of the elements that would become standard in fantasy, including magical creatures, quests, and battles.\n\n### **The Enlightenment**\n\nThe Enlightenment, which emerged in the 17th and 18th centuries, saw a shift away from the romantic and supernatural themes of the romances. Instead, the Enlightenment emphasized reason, science, and rationality. While fantasy continued to be written during this period, it was often relegated to the realm of children's literature or as a form of entertainment.\n\nHowever, the Enlightenment also saw the emergence of the science fiction genre, which would later influence the development of fantasy. Science fiction authors such as Jonathan Swift and Voltaire used fantastical elements to comment on the social and scientific issues of their time.\n\n### **Romanticism**\n\nRomanticism, which emerged in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, saw a renewed interest in the supernatural and the emotional. Romantic authors such as Lord Byron and Percy Bysshe Shelley used fantasy elements to explore themes of nature, morality, and the human condition.\n\nOne of the most famous Romantic authors is Mary Shelley, whose novel Frankenstein (1818) tells the story of a monster created by science and left to wander the world. While not strictly a work of fantasy, Frankenstein has had a profound influence on the genre and continues to be widely read and adapted today.\n\n**Modern fantasy**\n\nModern fantasy, which emerged in the 20th century, is a diverse and rapidly evolving genre. It is characterized by its use of magical and supernatural elements, as well as its exploration of themes such as identity, morality, and power.\n\n### **Pre-Tolkien**\n\nBefore the emergence of J.R.R. Tolkien, fantasy was often relegated to the realm of children's literature or as a form of entertainment. However, there were a few notable exceptions, such as the works of William Morris and W.H. Hodgson.\n\nMorris, an English poet and novelist, wrote several fantasy novels, including The Well at the World's End (1896) and The Wood Beyond the World (1894). These works featured fantastical elements, such as magical creatures and quests, and explored themes of identity, morality, and power.\n\nHodgson, an English author, wrote several fantasy novels, including The Night Land (1912) and The House on the Borderland (1908). These works featured supernatural elements, such as ghosts and supernatural creatures, and explored themes of identity, morality, and power.\n\n### **Tolkien**\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien, an English author and philologist, is widely regarded as the father of modern fantasy. His novel The Hobbit (1937) and The Lord of the Rings (1954-1955) trilogy are considered some of the greatest works of fantasy ever written.\n\nTolkien's works feature a richly detailed world, complete with its own geography, history, and mythology. They also explore themes of identity, morality, and power, as well as the struggle between good and evil.\n\n### **Post-Tolkien**\n\nSince the emergence of Tolkien, fantasy has continued to evolve and diversify. Modern authors such as George R.R. Martin, Neil Gaiman, and Patrick Rothfuss have pushed the boundaries of the genre, exploring new themes and ideas.\n\nMartin's A Song of Ice and Fire series, which was adapted into the popular television show Game of Thrones, features a complex and detailed world, complete with its own geography, history, and mythology. It also explores themes of identity, morality, and power, as well as the struggle between good and evil.\n\nGaiman's works, such as American Gods (2001) and The Ocean at the End of the Lane (2013), feature fantastical elements, such as magical creatures and supernatural events, and explore themes of identity, morality, and power.\n\nRothfuss's The Kingkiller Chronicle series, which includes The Name of the Wind (2007) and The Wise Man's Fear (2011), features a complex and detailed world, complete with its own geography, history, and mythology. It also explores themes of identity, morality, and power, as well as the struggle between good and evil.\n\n**References**\n\n* **Further reading**\n\nFor further reading on the history of fantasy, we recommend the following books:\n\n* Tolkien, J.R.R.

The tournament is contested by national teams representing different countries from around the world. The WBC is considered the premier international baseball competition, and it is held every four years.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe concept of a world baseball championship was first proposed in 1989 by Major League Baseball (MLB) Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti. However, it was not until 2000 that the first official World Baseball Classic tournament was organized. The inaugural tournament was held in 2006, with 16 teams participating. Japan won the first two World Baseball Classic tournaments, in 2006 and 2009, under the leadership of Manager Sadaharu Oh.\n\n**History**\n\n### 2006–09: Samurai Japan's back-to-back championships\n\nThe first World Baseball Classic was held in 2006, with 16 teams participating. Japan, led by Manager Sadaharu Oh, dominated the tournament, winning all of its games en route to the championship. The Japanese team, known as Samurai Japan, was composed of top players from Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) league. Japan's victory marked the country's emergence as a baseball powerhouse, and the WBC became a premier international competition.\n\nIn the 2009 World Baseball Classic, Japan repeated its championship performance, defeating South Korea in the final. The 2009 tournament was notable for the participation of Cuba, which made its WBC debut. Cuba's participation was seen as a significant development in the growth of baseball in the country.\n\n### 2013: Direct qualification and \"Plátano Power\"\n\nThe 2013 World Baseball Classic introduced a new format, with direct qualification for each tournament. The top three teams from the previous tournament automatically qualified, with the remaining spots allocated through a qualification process. The 2013 tournament was also notable for the emergence of the Dominican Republic, which won the championship with a team led by Manager Tony Pena. The Dominican team's victory was dubbed \"Plátano Power\" due to the country's famous plantain fruit.\n\n### 2017: American redemption\n\nIn the 2017 World Baseball Classic, the United States won the championship, defeating Puerto Rico in the final. The U.S. team, led by Manager Jim Leyland, was composed of top players from MLB, including Bryce Harper, Mike Trout, and Clayton Kershaw. The U.S. victory marked a significant milestone in the country's baseball history, as it was the first time the team had won the WBC.\n\n### 2023: \"Baseball's already won\"\n\nThe 2023 World Baseball Classic was held in March 2023, with 20 teams participating. Japan won the championship, defeating the United States in the final. The Japanese team was led by Manager Hideki Kuriyama, and its victory marked the country's third WBC title. The 2023 tournament was notable for the participation of Great Britain, which made its WBC debut.\n\n### 2026 tournament\n\nThe 2026 World Baseball Classic is scheduled to be held in the United States, Mexico, and Japan. The tournament will feature 20 teams, with the top three teams from the previous tournament automatically qualifying. The remaining spots will be allocated through a qualification process.\n\n**Format**\n\nThe World Baseball Classic is a double-elimination tournament, with each team competing in a round-robin format within its group. The top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stage, where they compete in a single-elimination format.

Other notable teams that have participated in the tournament include Cuba, South Korea, and Puerto Rico.\n\n**Trophy**\n\nThe World Baseball Classic trophy is awarded to the champion of the tournament. The trophy is a symbol of excellence in international baseball, and it is considered one of the most prestigious awards in the sport.\n\n**Broadcasting and promotion**\n\nThe World Baseball Classic is broadcast in over 200 countries and territories, with the tournament reaching a global audience of over 1 billion people. The tournament is promoted through various media channels, including social media, television, and print.\n\n**Attendance**\n\nThe World Baseball Classic has consistently drawn large crowds, with the 2023 tournament averaging over 30,000 fans per game.

The concept of free substitution varies widely across different sports, with some allowing unlimited substitution during live play, while others limit or restrict the number of substitutions permitted.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nFree substitution is a fundamental aspect of many sports, allowing teams to strategically manage their players' rest, fatigue, and performance during a match. The rules governing substitution vary depending on the sport, with some sports adopting more flexible systems, while others are more restrictive. In this article, we will explore the different types of sports that allow free substitution, as well as those with limited or restricted substitution.\n\n**Sports that allow unlimited substitution during live play**\n\nSome sports, such as American football and rugby league, allow teams to make unlimited substitutions during live play. This means that teams can replace any player on the field or court with a substitute player at any time, without needing to stop play.\n\n*   **American Football**: In the National Football League (NFL), teams are allowed to make unlimited substitutions during live play, as long as they follow the rules governing substitution procedures. This allows teams to strategically manage their players' rest and performance, as well as to address injuries and fatigue.\n*   **Rugby League**: In rugby league, teams can make unlimited substitutions during live play, as long as they follow the rules governing substitution procedures. This allows teams to strategically manage their players' rest and performance, as well as to address injuries and fatigue.\n\n**Sports that allow unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play only**\n\nOther sports, such as basketball and field hockey, allow teams to make unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play, but not during live play.\n\n*   **Basketball**: In basketball, teams are allowed to make unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play, but not during live play. This means that teams can replace any player on the court with a substitute player during timeouts, intermissions, or other stoppages of play.\n*   **Field Hockey**: In field hockey, teams are allowed to make unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play, but not during live play. This means that teams can replace any player on the field with a substitute player during timeouts, intermissions, or other stoppages of play.\n\n**Sports with limited substitution**\n\nSome sports, such as soccer and tennis, have limited substitution rules.\n\n*   **Soccer**: In soccer, teams are allowed to make a limited number of substitutions during a match, usually three or four. This means that teams can replace any player on the field with a substitute player a limited number of times during the match.\n*   **Tennis**: In tennis, players are allowed to make a limited number of changes between games, usually one or two. This means that players can switch to a different racket or tennis balls a limited number of times during a match.\n\n**Sports that only allow substitution to replace injured players**\n\nOther sports, such as curling and bowling, have rules that only allow substitution to replace injured players.\n\n*   **Curling**: In curling, teams are allowed to make substitutions only to replace injured players. This means that teams can replace a player who is injured or incapacitated with a substitute player, but not for any other reason.\n*   **Bowling**: In bowling, players are allowed to make substitutions only to replace injured players. This means that players can replace a teammate who is injured or incapacitated with a substitute player, but not for any other reason.\n\n**Sports with mixed or hybrid systems**\n\nSome sports, such as Australian Rules football and Gaelic football, have mixed or hybrid substitution systems.\n\n*   **Australian Rules Football**: In Australian Rules football, teams are allowed to make a limited number of substitutions during a match, but also have the option to make \"tactical substitutions\" during stoppages of play. This means that teams can replace any player on the field with a substitute player a limited number of times during the match, and also make additional substitutions during stoppages of play.\n*   **Gaelic Football**: In Gaelic football, teams are allowed to make a limited number of substitutions during a match, but also have the option to make \"tactical substitutions\" during stoppages of play. This means that teams can replace any player on the field with a substitute player a limited number of times during the match, and also make additional substitutions during stoppages of play.\n\n**See also**\n\n*   **Substitution (sports)**: A broader article on the concept of substitution in sports.\n*   **Injury (sports)**: An article on injuries in sports, including their causes and consequences.\n*   **Fatigue (sports)**: An article on fatigue in sports, including its causes and consequences.\n\n**Notes**\n\nFree substitution is a complex and multifaceted concept in sports, with different rules and regulations governing its use in various sports and competitions.

It was initially released for the Nintendo DS handheld console in 2010.\n\n#Gameplay\nThe gameplay of Ghost Trick involves solving puzzles and interacting with characters in a non-linear fashion. Players control the protagonist, Sissel, who is a detective tasked with solving a murder mystery. The game takes place in a series of different locations, each with its own set of puzzles and challenges to overcome. Throughout the game, Sissel is aided by a spirit known as Lateressa, who provides assistance and guidance in solving the mystery.\n\nOne of the unique features of Ghost Trick is its use of a \"time rewind\" mechanic, which allows players to rewind time to a previous point in the game. This mechanic is used to solve puzzles and interact with characters in different ways. Players can also manipulate objects and environments to solve puzzles and progress through the game.\n\nThe game has a strong focus on storytelling and character development. Players interact with a variety of characters, each with their own personalities and motivations. The story is presented through a series of flashbacks and conversations, which provide insight into the characters' backstories and relationships.\n\n#Plot\nThe plot of Ghost Trick revolves around a murder mystery that takes place in a series of different locations.

The strike was called in response to a contract dispute between SAG-AFTRA and major media producers over issues such as residuals, streaming, and working conditions.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Unionization in Hollywood\n\nThe history of unionization in the entertainment industry dates back to the 1930s, with the formation of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) in 1933. SAG was one of the first unions to represent actors in the industry, and it quickly gained recognition as a major force in negotiating contracts and working conditions for its members. In 2012, SAG and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) merged to form SAG-AFTRA, creating a single union to represent actors, announcers, broadcast journalists, dancers, DJs, news writers, news editors, program hosts, puppeteers, recording artists, singers, stunt performers, and videographers.\n\n### Pre-strike activity\n\nIn the months leading up to the strike, SAG-AFTRA had been engaged in contract negotiations with major media producers, including the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP). The negotiations had focused on issues such as residuals, streaming, and working conditions, but had made little progress. In June 2023, SAG-AFTRA issued a statement warning of a possible strike if the contract negotiations did not produce a satisfactory agreement.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n### July\n\nOn July 14, 2023, SAG-AFTRA announced that it had called a strike, with over 160,000 members participating. The strike began at 12:01 a.m. EDT, with picket lines set up outside major studios and production facilities in Los Angeles, New York, and other cities. The strike was called in response to a contract dispute over issues such as residuals, streaming, and working conditions.\n\n### August\n\nIn August 2023, the strike continued, with SAG-AFTRA members participating in picket lines and protests outside major studios and production facilities. The strike had a significant impact on the entertainment industry, with many productions halted or delayed. The AMPTP issued a statement criticizing SAG-AFTRA's demands and calling for a return to negotiations.\n\n### September\n\nIn September 2023, SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP began negotiations to try to reach a settlement. The negotiations were tense, with both sides making counteroffers and concessions. On September 15, 2023, SAG-AFTRA announced that it had reached a tentative agreement with the AMPTP, but that the agreement still required approval from its membership.\n\n### October\n\nIn October 2023, SAG-AFTRA members voted to approve the tentative agreement reached with the AMPTP. The agreement included significant gains for SAG-AFTRA members, including increased residuals and improved working conditions. The strike officially ended on October 31, 2023.\n\n### November\n\nIn November 2023, the entertainment industry began to return to normal, with productions resuming and new projects being greenlit. SAG-AFTRA members began to return to work, and the union celebrated its victory in the contract negotiations.\n\n### December\n\nIn December 2023, SAG-AFTRA issued a statement thanking its members for their support during the strike. The union also announced that it would continue to advocate for the rights and interests of its members in the entertainment industry.\n\n**Strike activity and responses**\n\n### Locations\n\nThe strike was held in multiple locations across the United States, including Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, and other cities. Major studios and production facilities were affected, including Warner Bros., Universal Studios, Paramount Pictures, and Disney.\n\n### Media executives' response\n\nMajor media executives criticized SAG-AFTRA's demands and called for a return to negotiations. The AMPTP issued a statement saying that the union's demands were \"unreasonable\" and that the strike was \"unnecessary.\" Media executives also argued that the strike would harm the entertainment industry and its workers.\n\n### Politicians' response\n\nPoliticians from both parties weighed in on the strike, with some expressing support for SAG-AFTRA and others criticizing the union's demands. California Governor Gavin Newsom issued a statement saying that the strike was a \"fight for fair compensation\" and that he supported SAG-AFTRA's efforts. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) also expressed support for the union, saying that the strike was \"about fairness and justice.\"\n\n### Other unions' response\n\nOther unions in the entertainment industry, including the Writers Guild of America and the Directors Guild of America, expressed support for SAG-AFTRA's efforts. The unions issued statements saying that they stood in solidarity with SAG-AFTRA and that they opposed the AMPTP's attempts to undermine the union's demands.\n\n### Other organizations' response\n\nOther organizations, including advocacy groups and industry associations, also weighed in on the strike. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued a statement saying that the strike was a \"fight for workers' rights\" and that the union had a \"right to collective bargaining.\" The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) also expressed support for SAG-AFTRA, saying that the strike was \"about fairness and equity\" for workers in the industry.\n\n### Impact\n\nThe strike had a significant impact on the entertainment industry, with many productions halted or delayed. The strike also had an impact on the economy, with estimates suggesting that the strike cost the industry over $1 billion in lost revenue. SAG-AFTRA members who participated in the strike reported significant gains in their wages and working conditions, however.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe aftermath of the strike saw a significant shift in the balance of power between SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP. The union's demands were met, and its members secured significant gains in their wages and working conditions. The strike also highlighted the importance of unionization in the entertainment industry, with SAG-AFTRA emerging as a major force in advocating for the rights and interests of its members.\n\n**See also**\n\n* 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike\n* 2016-2017 WGA-ATA strike\n* 2023 Hollywood writers' strike\n* American Federation of Television and Radio Artists\n* Screen Actors Guild\n* Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on publicly available information and has not been independently verified.\n* The article is intended to provide a neutral and informative account of the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not include any references or citations.\n\n**External links**\n\n* SAG-AFTRA official website\n* AMPTP official website\n* National Association of Broadcasters official website\n* American Civil Liberties Union official website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_SAG-AFTRA_strike\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Unionization in Hollywood\n##Pre-strike activity\n#Timeline\n##July\n##August\n##September\n##October\n##November\n##December\n#Strike activity and responses\n##Locations\n##Media executives' response\n##Politicians' response\n##Other unions' response\n##Other organizations' response\n##Impact\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
