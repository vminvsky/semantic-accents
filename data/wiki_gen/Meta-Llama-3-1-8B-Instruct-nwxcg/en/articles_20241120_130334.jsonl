heavyweight would not be as appealing as he would not gain much with a win Bellew also stated it would be his last fight as a professional [88] [89] By the end of July, it was said the fight would likely take place in November 2018 in London [90] After positive meetings between Bellew's promoter Eddie Hearn and K2's Alexander Krassyuk, on 20 August, Boxing Scene reported the fight was likely to

by Anthony Joshua [117] As part of his preparation for his bouts, Usyk sparred occasionally with former unified heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko [118] The fight was pushed back to 31 October 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the venue was moved to The SSE Arena [119] On the night, Usyk used his superior footwork and stamina to wear down his opponent and win a unanimous decision

desire to fight Joshua, saying \"Anthony, how are you? I'm coming for you, Anthony.\" [121]\n\n\nUnified heavyweight champion\nUnified heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua, for whom Usyk was the WBO mandatory challenger, had been in negotiations to fight undefeated WBC and The Ring champion Tyson Fury [122] However, when it appeared that Fury would instead be forced to face former WBC champion Deontay Wilder in a trilogy bout due to an arbitration ruling, [123] the WBO gave Joshua's camp 48 hours to come to an agreement for the fight with Fury on 21 May 2021, or they would instead order Joshua to face Usyk Joshua and Fury's camps could not reach an agreement, and thus on 22 May the WBO issued the instruction that Joshua would have to fight Usyk, with an agreement for the bout to be in place by 31 May [124] Usyk reacted to these

Krassyuk that a one-sided rematch clause which had been specified in the fight contract had \"already been activated in principle, from the side of Joshua.\" Krassyuk noted that Usyk relished the prospect of squaring off against Joshua twice: \"So I remember when we discussed with Oleksandr the issue of rematch, he was delighted and said 'Wow, cool, I will beat Antokha  [sic] twice.'\" [129] Regarding the venue of the rematch, Usyk made it known that he hoped it would take place in his native country of Ukraine, saying, \"I would love to have the rematch at Olimpiyskiy Stadium in Kyiv.\" However, Joshua's promoter, Eddie Hearn, stated that Ukraine was a \"very unlikely\" venue, as he wanted to maximise income: \"I think it will be international or the UK, I would think it would be in the UK.\" [130]\n\n\nUsyk vs. Dubois\nUsyk defended his unified heavyweight titles against WBA (Regular) champion Daniel Dubois on 26 August 2023, in Wrocław, Poland [143] While Usyk retained his titles via ninth-round stoppage, there was controversy surrounding the events of the fifth round, when Usyk dropped to the canvas following a punch from Dubois that was controversially ruled a low blow by referee Luis Pabon Accordingly, Usyk was given a maximum of five minutes to recover, but despite declaring he was ready to continue, Pabon urged Usyk to take more time out Usyk ultimately used three minutes and forty-five seconds before the fight resumed Usyk forced Dubois to take a knee in the eighth round and again in the ninth round, where he was counted out [144] [145] According to CompuBox stats, Usyk had outlanded Dubois in every round of the fight, landing 88 of 359 punches thrown (24.5%) to Dubois' 47 of 290 (16.2%) Dubois failed to land double digits in any round of the

the UK.\" [130]\n\n\nUsyk vs. Dubois\nUsyk defended his unified heavyweight titles against WBA (Regular) champion Daniel Dubois on 26 August 2023, in Wrocław, Poland [143] While Usyk retained his

2024, spreading in the United States and other countries, as part of wider Israel–Hamas war protests The escalation began after mass arrests at the Columbia University campus occupation, led by anti-Zionist groups, in which protesters demanded the university's disinvestment from Israel over its alleged genocide of Palestinians [10] In the U.S over 3,100 protesters have been arrested, [11] including faculty members and professors, [12] [13] on over 60 campuses [14] On May 7, protests spread across Europe with mass arrests in the Netherlands [15] [16] By May 12, twenty encampments had

of whom was pushed to the ground by a bodyguard An executive of the Melbourne University Jewish Students' Society, which helped organise the rally, said that they were disappointed with Yemini

The accident was one of the deadliest in Taiwan's rail history, resulting in the loss of 49 lives and injuring over 200 people.\n\n## Background\n\nThe accident occurred on the first day of a four-day Qingming Festival holiday, which is typically a period of high traffic with people visiting the graves of deceased family members. Many passengers had been standing at the time of the accident, which may have contributed to the severity of the injuries and fatalities.\n\n## Derailment\n\nOn 2 April 2021, a southbound Taroko Express train numbered 408 left Shulin in New Taipei at 07:16 NST heading for Taitung. The train was scheduled to arrive at Hualien at 09:39 NST. At approximately 09:28 NST, the train derailed on a slope near milepost 23.5, near the town of Su'ao, Hualien County. The derailment occurred when a construction truck was parked on a slope, which rolled down the slope and collided with the train.\n\n## Casualties\n\nForty-nine people were confirmed killed in the accident, including 47 passengers, the train driver, and the assistant train driver. Another 202 people were injured, with several in critical condition. The majority of the deceased were in carriages 7 and 8. Seventy-two people were temporarily trapped in the wreckage of the train.\n\n## Aftermath\n\nMore than 150 emergency personnel, including search and rescue workers and members of the military, were dispatched to the derailment site. Over 80 people were evacuated from the train's rear four carriages, while the remaining four carriages were described as \"deformed\" and harder to access. The rescue efforts were hampered by the remote location of the derailment and the difficulty of accessing the wreckage.\n\n## Investigation\n\nThe Taiwan Transportation Safety Board (TTSB) conducted an investigation into the derailment. The driver of the construction truck, Lee Yi-hsiang, was taken into police custody and is being investigated to ascertain the cause of the disaster. Lee was released on bail on 4 April 2021, before a court, on appeal, found that he might be a flight risk, and could collude with others and may destroy incriminating evidence on 5 April 2021. He is suspected of parking the vehicle without properly engaging the parking brake, causing the truck to roll down the slope and collide with the train. Prosecutors have requested an arrest warrant for the manager of the construction site, who may be accused of causing death due to negligence and of forging documents.\n\n## Reactions\n\nAmong those who first surveyed the crash site was Premier Su Tseng-chang. The government has set up a task force to investigate the cause of the derailment and to provide assistance to the victims and their families.\n\n## See also\n\n* Rail transport in Taiwan\n* Taiwan Transportation Safety Board\n* Taroko Express\n\n## Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2021_Hualien_train_derailment\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nThe accident occurred on the first day of a four-day Qingming Festival holiday, which is typically a period of high traffic with people visiting the graves of deceased family members [14] [15]  Many passengers had been standing at the time of the accident [16]\n\n\nDerailment\nOn 2 April 2021, a southbound Taroko Express train numbered 408 left Shulin in New Taipei at 07:16 NST heading for Taitung [25] [26]  The train was scheduled to arrive at Hualien at 09:39 NST [26]\n\n\nCasualties\nForty-nine people [5] were confirmed killed in the accident, including 47 passengers, the train driver and the assistant train driver, [40] [5] while another 202 were injured, several in critical condition [5] [41] The majority of the deceased were in carriages 7 and 8 Seventy-two people were temporarily trapped in the wreckage of the train [8]\n\n\nAftermath\nMore than 150 emergency personnel, including search and rescue workers and members of the military, were dispatched to the derailment site [15]  Over 80 people were evacuated from the train's rear four carriages, while the remaining four carriages were described as \"deformed\" and harder to access [16]\n\n\nInvestigation\nThe Taiwan Transportation Safety Board (TTSB) conducted an investigation [55] The driver of the construction truck, Lee Yi-hsiang (Chinese: 李義祥; pinyin: Lǐ Yìxiáng; aged 45), was taken into police custody and being investigated to ascertain the cause of the disaster [27] [56] Lee was released on bail on 4 April 2021, before a court, on appeal, found that he might be a flight risk, and could collude with others and may destroy incriminating evidence on 5 April 2021 [57] [58] [59] He is suspected of parking the vehicle without properly engaging the parking brake, causing the truck to roll down the slope and collide with the train [60] Prosecutors have requested an arrest warrant for the manager of the construction site, who may be accused of causing death due to negligence and of forging documents [61] [62]\n\n\nReactions\nAmong those who first surveyed the crash site was Premier Su Tseng-chang [72]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

one of The Challenge's related TV programs and, in a few seasons, previously unknown contestants The cast usually contains both \"veterans\" (or vets) and \"rookies\" Veterans are thought of as players that have won at least one Challenge season or have appeared on several seasons of the show; Rookies refer to newer players Many recent alumni come from various reality shows including Survivor, The Amazing Race, Are You the One?, Big Brother, Ex on the Beach, Vanderpump Rules and Love Island.\n\n\nHosts\nThe series initially used no hosts but instead a former cast member who had been kicked off his or her season, providing assignments as \"Mr.\" or \"Ms Big\" (David \"Puck\" Rainey, David Edwards, and Gladys Sanabria served this role) After one season without anyone in this role, the series began using hosts: Eric Nies and Mark Long co-hosted a season, and Jonny Moseley and Dave Mirra hosted various seasons before T J Lavin became the show's regular host by the 11th season [5]\n\n\nHistory\nOver time, a playful rivalry developed between the cast of Road Rules and The Real World, with the former occasionally attempting to prank the latter while it was in production [6] During the filming of The Real World: Boston and Road Rules: Islands, the two casts met while the Real World cast was vacationing in San Juan, Puerto Rico Producers set up a face-off where both teams would compete for a cash prize The episode brought in high ratings and this set ideas in motion to produce the spin-off series [7] The series started airing in April 1998 as Road Rules: All Stars, and featured cast members from five seasons of The Real World Another face-off called AquaGames, hosted by Kit Hoover and Mark Long, was between The Real World: Seattle and Road Rules: Down Under and aired as part of those shows later in 1998.\n\n\nCast members\nContestants are various reality television cast members from different television shows Originally the cast consisted of The Real World and Road Rules alumni, and cast who debuted directly on The Challenge, but eventually MTV expanded it to other alumni from other reality shows and networks [10] [11]

television game show that originated from a series of spin-offs from MTV's reality shows The Real World and Road Rules. The show features alumni from various reality TV shows competing against each other in physical and mental challenges, with the goal of winning cash prizes.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe Challenge casts are season-specific as the cast varies from season to season. The casts are made up of contestants originating from one of The Challenge's related TV programs, and, in a few seasons, previously unknown contestants. The cast usually contains both \"veterans\" (or vets) and \"rookies.\" Veterans are thought of as players that have won at least one Challenge season or have appeared on several seasons of the show; Rookies refer to newer players. Many recent alumni come from various reality shows, including Survivor, The Amazing Race, Are You the One?, Big Brother, Ex on the Beach, Vanderpump Rules, and Love Island.\n\n**Hosts**\n\nThe series initially used no hosts but instead a former cast member who had been kicked off his or her season, providing assignments as \"Mr.\" or \"Ms Big.\" David \"Puck\" Rainey, David Edwards, and Gladys Sanabria served this role. After one season without anyone in this role, the series began using hosts: Eric Nies and Mark Long co-hosted a season, and Jonny Moseley and Dave Mirra hosted various seasons before T J Lavin became the show's regular host by the 11th season.\n\n**History**\n\nOver time, a playful rivalry developed between the cast of Road Rules and The Real World, with the former occasionally attempting to prank the latter while it was in production. During the filming of The Real World: Boston and Road Rules: Islands, the two casts met while the Real World cast was vacationing in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Producers set up a face-off where both teams would compete for a cash prize. The episode brought in high ratings and this set ideas in motion to produce the spin-off series. The series started airing in April 1998 as Road Rules: All Stars, and featured cast members from five seasons of The Real World. Another face-off called AquaGames, hosted by Kit Hoover and Mark Long, was between The Real World: Seattle and Road Rules: Down Under and aired as part of those shows later in 1998.\n\n**Cast members**\n\nContestants are various reality television cast members from different television shows. Originally, the cast consisted of The Real World and Road Rules alumni, and cast who debuted directly on The Challenge, but eventually MTV expanded it to other alumni from other reality shows and networks.\n\n**Seasons**\n\nThe Challenge: Champs vs Stars (originally known as The Challenge: Champs vs Pros) is a special recurring mini-series of The Challenge. In each multi-week event, alumni from The Challenge compete against celebrities to win money for charity.\n\n**Spin-offs**\n\nThe Challenge has spawned several spin-offs, including:\n\n* **The Challenge: Champs vs Stars**: A special recurring mini-series of The Challenge, where alumni from The Challenge compete against celebrities to win money for charity.\n* **The Challenge: All Stars**: A spin-off series that features alumni from previous seasons of The Challenge competing against each other.\n* **The Challenge: World Championship**: A global competition that features winners and

I never wish to hear money, jewels or sables mentioned again.\" [82] [83] When she became co-owner of the Todhunter school in New York City, a limited number of Jews were admitted Most students were upper-class Protestants, and Roosevelt said that the spirit of the school \"would be different if we had too large a proportion of Jewish children.\" She said the problem was that \"the country is still full of immigrant Jews, very unlike ourselves.\" [84]\n\n\nPublic life before the White House\nIn the 1920 presidential election, Franklin was nominated as the running mate of Democratic presidential candidate James M Cox Roosevelt joined Franklin in touring the country, making her first campaign appearances [88] Cox was defeated by Republican Warren G Harding, who won with 404 electoral votes to 127 [89]\n\n\nFirst Lady of the United States (1933–1945)\nRoosevelt became First Lady of the United States when Franklin was inaugurated on March 4, 1933 Having known all of the twentieth century's previous first ladies, she was seriously depressed at having to assume the role, which had traditionally been restricted to domesticity and hostessing [97] Her immediate predecessor, Lou Henry Hoover, had ended her feminist activism on becoming first lady, stating her intention to be only a \"backdrop for Bertie.\" [98] Eleanor's distress at these precedents was severe enough that Hickok subtitled her biography of Roosevelt \"Reluctant First Lady\" [99]\n\n\nAmerican Youth Congress and National Youth Administration\nThe American Youth Congress (AYC) was formed in 1935 to advocate for youth rights in U.S politics, and it was responsible for introducing the American Youth Bill of Rights to the U.S Congress Roosevelt's relationship with the AYC eventually led to the formation of the National Youth Administration, a New Deal agency in the United States, founded in 1935, that focused on providing work and education for Americans between the ages of 16 and 25 [113] [114] [115] The NYA was headed by Aubrey Willis Williams, a prominent liberal from Alabama who was close to Roosevelt and Harry Hopkins Speaking of the NYA in the 1930s, Roosevelt expressed her concern about ageism, stating that \"I live in real terror when I think we may be losing this generation We have got to bring these young people into the active life of the community and make them feel that they are necessary.\" [116] In 1939 the Dies Committee subpoenaed leaders of the AYC, who, in addition to serving the AYC, also were members of the Young Communist League Roosevelt was in attendance at the hearings and afterward invited the subpoenaed witnesses to board at the White House during their stay in Washington D.C Joseph P Lash was one of her boarders On February 10, 1940, members of the AYC, as guests of Roosevelt in her capacity as first lady, attended a picnic on the White House lawn where they were addressed by Franklin from the South Portico The President admonished them to condemn not merely the Nazi regime but all dictatorships [117] The President was reportedly booed by the group Afterwards, many of the same youth picketed the White House as representatives of the American Peace Mobilization Among them was Joseph Cadden, one of Roosevelt's overnight boarders Later in 1940, despite Roosevelt's publication of her reasons \"Why I still believe in the Youth Congress,\" the American Youth Congress was disbanded [118] The NYA was shut down in 1943 [119]\n\n\nArthurdale\nRoosevelt's chief project during her husband's first two terms was the establishment of a planned community in Arthurdale, West Virginia [120] [121] On August 18, 1933, at Hickok's urging, Roosevelt visited the families of homeless miners in Morgantown, West Virginia, who had been blacklisted following union activities [122] Deeply affected by the visit, Roosevelt proposed a resettlement community for the miners at Arthurdale, where they could make a living by subsistence farming, handicrafts, and a local manufacturing plant [121] She hoped the project could become a model for \"a new kind of community\" in the U.S., in which workers would be better cared for [123] Her husband enthusiastically supported the project [121]\n\n\nCivil rights activism\nRoosevelt is seen by historians as having been significantly more advanced than her husband on civil rights [133] During Franklin's administration, Roosevelt became an important connection to the African-American population in the era of segregation [133] [134] Despite the President's desire to placate Southern sentiment, Roosevelt was vocal in her support of the civil rights movement After her experience with Arthurdale and her inspections of New Deal programs in Southern states, she concluded that New Deal programs were discriminating against African-Americans, who received a disproportionately small share of relief money Roosevelt became one of the only voices in her husband's administration insisting that benefits be equally extended to Americans of all races [134]\n\n\nNorvelt\nOn May 21, 1937, Roosevelt visited Westmoreland Homesteads to mark the arrival of the community's final homesteader Accompanying her on the trip was Elinor Morgenthau, the wife of Henry Morgenthau Jr., [157] the president's Secretary of the Treasury [158] \"I am no believer in paternalism I do not like charities,\" Eleanor Roosevelt had said earlier But cooperative communities such as Westmoreland Homesteads, she went on, offered an alternative to \"our rather settled ideas\" that could \"provide equality of opportunity for all and prevent the recurrence of a similar disaster  [depression] in the future.\" Residents were so taken by her personal expression of interest in the program that they promptly agreed to rename the community in her honor (The new town name, Norvelt, was a combination of the last syllables in her names: EleaNOR RooseVELT.) [159] The Norvelt firefighter's hall is named Roosevelt Hall in her honor [158]\n\n\nUse of media\nRoosevelt was an unprecedentedly outspoken First Lady who made far more use of the media than her predecessors; she held 348 press conferences over the span of her husband's 12-year presidency [160] Inspired by her relationship with Hickok, Roosevelt placed a ban on male reporters attending the press conferences, effectively forcing newspapers to keep female reporters on staff in order to cover them She relaxed the rule only once, on her return from her 1943 Pacific trip [161] Because the Gridiron Club banned women from its annual Gridiron Dinner for journalists, Roosevelt hosted a competing event for female reporters at the White House, which she called \"Gridiron Widows\" [162] She was interviewed by many newspapers; the New Orleans journalist Iris Kelso described Roosevelt as her most interesting interviewee ever [163] In the early days of her all-female press conferences, she said they would not address \"politics, legislation, or executive decision\", [164] since the role of the First Lady was expected to be non-political at that time She also agreed at first that she would avoid discussing her views on pending congressional measures Still, the press conferences provided a welcome opportunity for the women reporters to speak directly with the first lady, access that had been unavailable in previous administrations [165]\n\n\nWorld War II\nOn May 10, 1940, Germany invaded Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, marking the end of the relatively conflict-free \"Phoney War\" phase of World War II As the U.S began to move toward war footing, Roosevelt found herself again depressed, fearing that her role in fighting for domestic justice would become extraneous in a nation focused on foreign affairs She briefly considered traveling to Europe to work with the Red Cross, but was dissuaded by presidential advisers who pointed out the consequences should the president's wife be captured as a prisoner of war [183] She soon found other wartime causes to work on, however, beginning with a popular movement to allow the immigration of European refugee children [184] She also lobbied her husband to allow greater immigration of groups persecuted by the Nazis, including Jews, but fears of fifth columnists caused Franklin to restrict immigration rather than expanding it [185] Roosevelt successfully secured political refugee status for eighty-three Jewish refugees from the S.S Quanza in August 1940, but was refused on many other occasions [186] Her son James later wrote that \"her deepest regret at the end of her life\" was that she had not forced Franklin to accept more refugees from Nazism during the war [187]\n\n\nYears after the White House\nFranklin died on April 12, 1945, after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage at the Little White House in Warm Springs, Georgia Roosevelt later learned that her husband's mistress Lucy Mercer (now named Rutherfurd) had been with him when he died, [203] a discovery made more bitter by learning that her daughter Anna had also been aware of the ongoing relationship between the President and Rutherfurd [204] It was Anna who told her that Franklin had been with Rutherfurd when he died; in addition, she told her that Franklin had continued the relationship for decades, and people surrounding him had hidden the information from his wife After the funeral, Roosevelt temporarily returned to Val-Kill [205] Franklin left instructions for her in the event of his death; he proposed turning over Hyde Park to the federal government as a museum, and she spent the following months cataloging the estate and arranging for the transfer After Franklin's death, she moved into an apartment at 29 Washington Square West in Greenwich Village In 1950, she rented suites at the Park Sheraton Hotel (202 West 56th Street) She lived here until 1953 when she moved to 211 East 62nd Street When that lease expired in 1958, she returned to the Park Sheraton as she waited for the house she purchased with Edna and David Gurewitsch at 55 East 74th Street to be renovated [206] The Franklin D Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum opened on April 12, 1946, setting a precedent for future presidential libraries [207]\n\n\nUnited Nations\nIn December 1945, President Harry S Truman appointed Roosevelt as a delegate to the United Nations General Assembly [7] In April 1946, she became the first chairperson of the preliminary United Nations Commission on Human Rights [208] Roosevelt remained chairperson when the commission was established on a permanent basis in January 1947 [209] Along with René Cassin, John Peters Humphrey and others, she played an instrumental role in drafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).\n\n\nOther postwar activities and honors\nIn the late 1940s, Democrats in New York and throughout the country courted Roosevelt for political office [217]\n\n\nDeath\nIn April 1960, Roosevelt was diagnosed with aplastic anemia soon after being struck by a car in New York City In 1962, she was given steroids, which activated a dormant case of tuberculosis in her bone marrow, [231] and she died, aged 78, of resulting cardiac failure at her Manhattan home at 55 East 74th Street on the Upper East Side [232] on November 7, 1962, cared for by her daughter, Anna [231] [233] President John F Kennedy ordered all United States flags lowered to half-staff throughout the world on November 8 in tribute to Roosevelt [233]\n\n\nPublished books\n1n 1941, Freedom House was founded;

She was a leading voice for human rights and women's empowerment, and her legacy continues to inspire people around the world.\n\n## Personal Life\n\nAnna Eleanor Roosevelt was born on October 11, 1884, in Manhattan, New York City, to socialites Anna Rebecca Hall and Elliott Roosevelt. She was the niece of President Theodore Roosevelt and a cousin of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who would later become her husband. Eleanor's early life was marked by a serious demeanor, earning her the nickname \"Granny\" from her mother. Her relationship with her mother was strained, as her mother was emotionally distant and ashamed of Eleanor's \"plainness.\"\n\n## Early Life\n\nEleanor Roosevelt was born in Manhattan, New York City, to socialites Anna Rebecca Hall and Elliott Roosevelt. Her early life was marked by a serious demeanor, earning her the nickname \"Granny\" from her mother. Her relationship with her mother was strained, as her mother was emotionally distant and ashamed of Eleanor's \"plainness.\" Eleanor's father was a distant figure, and she was largely raised by her mother and her mother's family.\n\n## Marriage and Family Life\n\nIn the summer of 1902, Eleanor met her future husband, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, on a train to Tivoli, New York. The two began a secret correspondence and romance, and became engaged on November 22, 1903. Franklin's mother, Sara Ann Delano, opposed the union and made him promise that the engagement would not be officially announced for a year. Eleanor's husband, Franklin, was a charming and charismatic figure, but he was also known for his womanizing and infidelity. The couple had six children together, including Anna, Elliott, Franklin Jr., John, Curtis, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr.\n\n## Other Relationships\n\nEleanor had a close relationship with her aunt, Maude Livingston Hall. Maude was only six years older than Eleanor and the two grew up together in the home of Maude's mother, Eleanor's grandmother. Their relationship was more like sisters than aunt and niece. After Maude divorced her first husband, the champion polo player Lawrence Waterbury, in 1912, she married the playwright and novelist David Gray in 1914 in a small ceremony attended only by Eleanor and the Roosevelt family lawyer, John M Hackett. The couple maintained a close relationship with Eleanor and F.D.R, and Eleanor was instrumental in successfully advocating for David Gray's appointment as United States minister to Ireland; a post he held during World War II from 1940 to 1947.\n\n## Attitudes toward Jewish People\n\nUntil middle age, Eleanor Roosevelt exhibited antisemitic tendencies. In a 1918 letter to her mother-in-law, she declared, the \"Jew party  [was] appalling... I never wish to hear money, jewels or sables mentioned again.\" When she became co-owner of the Todhunter school in New York City, a limited number of Jews were admitted. Most students were upper-class Protestants, and Roosevelt said that the spirit of the school \"would be different if we had too large a proportion of Jewish children.\" She said the problem was that \"the country is still full of immigrant Jews, very unlike ourselves.\"\n\n## Public Life before the White House\n\nIn the 1920 presidential election, Franklin was nominated as the running mate of Democratic presidential candidate James M Cox. Eleanor joined Franklin in touring the country, making her first campaign appearances. Cox was defeated by Republican Warren G Harding, who won with 404 electoral votes to 127.\n\n## First Lady of the United States (1933-1945)\n\nEleanor Roosevelt became First Lady of the United States when Franklin was inaugurated on March 4, 1933. She was seriously depressed at having to assume the role, which had traditionally been restricted to domesticity and hostessing. Her immediate predecessor, Lou Henry Hoover, had ended her feminist activism on becoming first lady, stating her intention to be only a \"backdrop for Bertie.\" Eleanor's distress at these precedents was severe enough that Hickok subtitled her biography of Roosevelt \"Reluctant First Lady.\"\n\n## American Youth Congress and National Youth Administration\n\nThe American Youth Congress (AYC) was formed in 1935 to advocate for youth rights in U.S politics, and it was responsible for introducing the American Youth Bill of Rights to the U.S Congress. Roosevelt's relationship with the AYC eventually led to the formation of the National Youth Administration, a New Deal agency in the United States, founded in 1935, that focused on providing work and education for Americans between the ages of 16 and 25. The NYA was headed by Aubrey Willis Williams, a prominent liberal from Alabama who was close to Roosevelt and Harry Hopkins. Speaking of the NYA in the 1930s, Roosevelt expressed her concern about ageism, stating that \"I live in real terror when I think we may be losing this generation We have got to bring these young people into the active life of the community and make them feel that they are necessary.\"\n\n## Arthurdale\n\nEleanor Roosevelt's chief project during her husband's first two terms was the establishment of a planned community in Arthurdale, West Virginia. On August 18, 1933, at Hickok's urging, Roosevelt visited the families of homeless miners in Morgantown, West Virginia, who had been blacklisted following union activities. Deeply affected by the visit, Roosevelt proposed a resettlement community for the miners at Arthurdale, where they could make a living by subsistence farming, handicrafts, and a local manufacturing plant. She hoped the project could become a model for \"a new kind of community\" in the U.S., in which workers would be better cared for.\n\n## Civil Rights Activism\n\nEleanor Roosevelt is seen by historians as having been significantly more advanced than her husband on civil rights. During Franklin's administration, Roosevelt became an important connection to the African-American population in the era of segregation. Despite the President's desire to placate Southern sentiment, Roosevelt was vocal in her support of the civil rights movement. After her experience with Arthurdale and her inspections of New Deal programs in Southern states, she concluded that New Deal programs were discriminating against African-Americans, who received a disproportionately small share of relief money. Roosevelt became one of the only voices in her husband's administration insisting that benefits be equally extended to Americans of all races.\n\n## Norvelt\n\nOn May 21, 1937, Roosevelt visited Westmoreland Homesteads to mark the arrival of the community's final homesteader. Accompanying her on the trip was Elinor Morgenthau, the wife of Henry Morgenthau Jr., the president's Secretary of the Treasury. \"I am no believer in paternalism I do not like charities,\" Eleanor Roosevelt had said earlier. But cooperative communities such as Westmoreland Homesteads, she went on, offered an alternative to \"our rather settled ideas\" that could \"provide equality of opportunity for all and prevent the recurrence of a similar disaster  [depression] in the future.\" Residents were so taken by her personal expression of interest in the program that they promptly agreed to rename the community in her honor (The new town name, Norvelt, was a combination of the last syllables in her names: EleaNOR RooseVELT.)\n\n## Use of Media\n\nRoosevelt was an unprecedentedly outspoken First Lady who made far more use of the media than her predecessors. She held 348 press conferences over the span of her husband's 12-year presidency. Inspired by her relationship with Hickok, Roosevelt placed a ban on male reporters attending the press conferences, effectively forcing newspapers to keep female reporters on staff in order to cover them. She was interviewed by many newspapers; the New Orleans journalist Iris Kelso described Roosevelt as her most interesting interviewee ever.\n\n## World War II\n\nOn May 10, 1940, Germany invaded Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, marking the end of the relatively conflict-free \"Phoney War\" phase of World War II. As the U.S began to move toward war footing, Roosevelt found herself again depressed, fearing that her role in fighting for domestic justice would become extraneous in a nation focused on foreign affairs. She soon found other wartime causes to work on, however, beginning with a popular movement to allow the immigration of European refugee children. She also lobbied her husband to allow greater immigration of groups persecuted by the Nazis, including Jews, but fears of fifth columnists caused Franklin to restrict immigration rather than expanding it.\n\n## Years After the White House\n\nFranklin died on April 12, 1945, after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage at the Little White House in Warm Springs, Georgia. Roosevelt later learned that her husband's mistress Lucy Mercer (now named Rutherfurd) had been with him when he died, a discovery made more bitter by learning that her daughter Anna had also been aware of the ongoing relationship between the President and Rutherfurd. It was Anna who told her that Franklin had been with Rutherfurd when he died; in addition, she told her that Franklin had continued the relationship for decades, and people surrounding him had hidden the information from his wife. After the funeral, Roosevelt temporarily returned to Val-Kill. Franklin left instructions for her in the event of his death; he proposed turning over Hyde Park to the federal government as a museum, and she spent the following months cataloging the estate and arranging for the transfer.\n\n## United Nations\n\nIn December 1945, President Harry S Truman appointed Roosevelt as a delegate to the United Nations General Assembly. In April 1946, she became the first chairperson of the preliminary United Nations Commission on Human Rights. Roosevelt remained chairperson when the commission was established on a permanent basis in January 1947. Along with René Cassin, John Peters Humphrey and others, she played an instrumental role in drafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).\n\n## Other Postwar Activities and Honors\n\nIn the late 1940s, Democrats in New York and throughout the country courted Roosevelt for political office. She was considered a strong candidate for the U.S. Senate in 1949, but ultimately declined to run.\n\n## Death\n\nIn April 1960, Roosevelt was diagnosed with aplastic anemia soon after being struck by a car in New York City. In 1962, she was given steroids, which activated a dormant case of tuberculosis in her bone marrow, and she died, aged 78, of resulting cardiac failure at her Manhattan home at 55 East 74th Street on the Upper East Side on November 7, 1962, cared for by her daughter, Anna.\n\n## Posthumous Recognition\n\nIn 1941, Freedom House was founded; Eleanor Roosevelt was its first honorary co-chair. Freedom House is a non-profit organization based in Washington, D.C., best known for political advocacy surrounding issues of democracy, political freedom, and human rights.\n\n## Places Named for Roosevelt\n\nEleanor Roosevelt School, also known as the Eleanor Roosevelt Vocational School for Colored Youth, Warm Springs Negro School, and the Eleanor Roosevelt Rosenwald School, which operated as a school from March 18, 1937, until 1972, was a historical Black community school located at 350 Parham Street at Leverette Hill Road in Warm Springs, Georgia. As of May 3, 2010, the school is listed on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Meriwether County, Georgia.\n\n## Historical Assessments\n\nSince 1982, the Siena College Research Institute has periodically conducted surveys asking historians to assess American first ladies according to a cumulative score on the independent criteria of their background, intelligence, value to the country, being their \"own women\", integrity, accomplishments, courage, leadership, public image, and value to the president. Roosevelt has been ranked by participating historians as the best-regarded first lady in each of the five such surveys to be conducted.\n\n## Cultural References\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, female impersonator Arthur Blake drew acclaim for his impersonations of Eleanor Roosevelt in his nightclub act.

twentieth century's previous first ladies, she was seriously depressed at having to assume the role, which had traditionally been restricted to domesticity and hostessing [97] Her immediate predecessor, Lou Henry Hoover, had ended her feminist activism on becoming first lady, stating her intention to be only a \"backdrop for Bertie.\" [98] Eleanor's distress at these precedents was

formed in 1935 to advocate for youth rights in U.S politics, and it was responsible for introducing the American Youth Bill of Rights to the U.S Congress Roosevelt's relationship with the AYC eventually led to the formation of the National Youth Administration, a New Deal agency in the United States, founded in 1935, that focused on providing work and education for Americans between the

Roosevelt expressed her concern about ageism, stating that \"I live in real terror when I think we may be losing this generation We have got to bring these young people into the active life of the community and make them feel that they are necessary.\" [116] In 1939 the Dies Committee subpoenaed leaders of the AYC, who, in addition to serving the AYC, also were members of the Young Communist League Roosevelt was in attendance at the hearings and afterward invited the subpoenaed witnesses to board at the White House during their stay in Washington D.C Joseph P Lash was one of her boarders On February 10, 1940, members of the AYC, as guests of Roosevelt in her capacity as first lady, attended a picnic on the White House lawn where they were addressed by Franklin from the South Portico The President admonished them to condemn not merely the Nazi regime but all dictatorships [117] The President was reportedly booed by the group Afterwards, many of the same youth picketed the White House as representatives of the American Peace Mobilization Among them was Joseph Cadden, one of Roosevelt's overnight boarders Later in 1940, despite Roosevelt's publication of her reasons \"Why I still believe in the Youth Congress,\" the American Youth Congress was disbanded [118] The NYA was shut down in 1943 [119]\n\n\nArthurdale\nRoosevelt's chief project during her husband's first two terms was the establishment of a planned community in Arthurdale, West Virginia [120] [121] On August 18, 1933, at Hickok's urging, Roosevelt visited the families of homeless miners in Morgantown,

she held 348 press conferences over the span of her husband's 12-year presidency [160] Inspired by her relationship with Hickok, Roosevelt placed a ban on male reporters attending the press conferences, effectively forcing newspapers to keep female reporters on staff in order to cover them She relaxed the rule only once, on her return from her 1943 Pacific trip [161] Because the Gridiron Club banned women from its annual Gridiron Dinner for journalists, Roosevelt hosted a competing event for female reporters at the White House, which she called \"Gridiron Widows\" [162] She was interviewed by many newspapers; the New Orleans journalist Iris Kelso described Roosevelt as her most interesting interviewee ever [163] In the early days of her all-female press conferences, she said they would not address \"politics, legislation, or executive decision\", [164] since the role of the First Lady was expected to be non-political at that time She also agreed at first that she would avoid discussing her views on pending congressional measures Still, the press conferences provided a welcome opportunity for the women reporters to speak directly with the first lady, access that had been unavailable in previous administrations [165]\n\n\nWorld War II\nOn May 10, 1940, Germany invaded Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, marking the end of the relatively conflict-free \"Phoney War\" phase of World War II As the U.S began to move toward war footing, Roosevelt found herself again depressed, fearing that her role in fighting for domestic justice would become extraneous in a nation focused on foreign affairs She briefly considered traveling to Europe to work with the Red Cross, but was dissuaded by presidential advisers who pointed out the consequences should the president's wife be captured as a prisoner of war [183] She soon found other wartime causes to work on, however, beginning with a popular movement to allow the immigration of European refugee children [184] She also lobbied her husband to allow greater immigration of groups persecuted by the Nazis, including Jews, but fears of fifth columnists caused Franklin to restrict immigration rather than expanding it [185] Roosevelt successfully secured political refugee status for eighty-three Jewish refugees from the S.S Quanza in August 1940, but was refused on many other occasions [186] Her son James later wrote that \"her deepest regret at the end of her life\" was that she had not forced Franklin to accept more refugees from Nazism during the war [187]\n\n\nYears after the White House\nFranklin died on April 12, 1945, after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage at the Little White House in Warm Springs, Georgia Roosevelt later learned that her husband's mistress Lucy Mercer (now named Rutherfurd) had been with him when he died, [203] a discovery made more bitter by learning that her daughter Anna had also been aware of the ongoing relationship between the President and Rutherfurd [204] It was Anna who told her that Franklin had been with Rutherfurd when he died;

Developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in the early 20th century, the code has since been adopted by various national and international organizations, including the United States Federal Government, the United States Department of Defense, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and many military organizations.\n\n**International Adoption**\n\nSoon after the code words were developed, they were adopted by other national and international organizations, including the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and the International Amateur Radio Union (IARU). The code has also been used by the American Radio Relay League (ARRL) and the Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials-International (APCO).\n\nThe code was adopted by the United States Federal Government as Federal Standard 1037C: Glossary of Telecommunications Terms, which was later succeeded by ANSI T1.523-2001 and ATIS Telecom Glossary (ATIS-0100523.2019). The code has also been adopted by many military organizations, including NATO and the now-defunct Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO).\n\n**Usage**\n\nA spelling alphabet is used to disambiguate those parts of a message that contain letters and digits, because the names of many letters sound similar. For instance, \"bee\" and \"pee\" sound the same, as do \"en\" and \"em\" or \"ef\" and \"ess.\" The potential for confusion increases if static or other interference is present, as is commonly the case with radio and telephonic communication.\n\nFor example, the target message \"proceed to map grid DH98\" would be transmitted as \"proceed to map grid Delta-Hotel-Niner-Ait.\" The use of a spelling alphabet ensures that the message is clearly understood, even in the presence of interference or noise.\n\n**Pronunciation of Code Words**\n\nThe final choice of code words for the letters of the alphabet and for the digits was made after hundreds of thousands of comprehension tests involving 31 nationalities. The qualifying feature was the likelihood of a code word being understood in the context of others. For example, \"Football\" has a higher chance of being understood than \"Foxtrot\" in isolation, but \"Foxtrot\" is superior in extended communication.\n\nThe code words were chosen to be easy to understand and to minimize confusion. The code words are not meant to be phonetic or to closely resemble the actual sound of the letter or number.

{"title": "Lennox_Lewis", "content": "\nEarly life\nLewis was born on 2 September 1965 in West Ham, London, to Jamaican parents and according to his mother, he would often fight with other children growing up [5] At birth he weighed 4.8 kg (10 lb 10 oz), and was given the name Lennox by the doctor, who said \"he looked like a Lennox.\" [6] Lewis moved to Kitchener, Ontario, Canada with his mother in 1977 at the age of 12 He attended Cameron Heights Collegiate Institute for high school, where he excelled in Canadian football, soccer, and basketball [7] In the 1982–83 school year, he helped the school's AAA basketball team win the Ontario provincial championship [8] [9]\n\n\nAmateur career\nLewis eventually decided that his favourite sport was boxing He took up boxing circa 1978 [10] He became a dominant amateur boxer and won the gold medal at the Junior World Championships in 1983 [11] At age 18, Lewis represented Canada in the super-heavyweight division at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles By that time he was ranked #6 in the world by the AIBA [12] He advanced to the quarter-finals, where he lost by decision to Tyrell Biggs of the US, who went on to win the gold medal Despite being 6'5\" tall, and having a very strong punch, his coaches admitted they had to pressure him to convert size and raw talent into aggression [13] His amateur boxing coaches were Arnie Boehm and Adrian Teodorescu, who guided Lewis to the Olympic title in 1988 [14] [15]\n\n\nProfessional career\nHaving achieved his goal, Lewis declared himself a professional and moved back to his native England He claimed he had always considered himself British, [25] [26] [27] but one article reported that many British fans regarded him as \"a Canadian at heart and a Briton for convenience.\" [28] In 2015 Lewis explained \"When I turned pro, I had to go to the United Kingdom in order to pursue my career The infrastructure to develop boxers wasn't in Canada then.\" [29]\n\n\nEarly

pursue my career The infrastructure to develop boxers wasn't in Canada then.\" [29]\n\n\nBritish, Commonwealth and European champion\nAfter he signed with American promoter Main Events, [citation needed] he won the European heavyweight title in 1990 against Frenchman Jean Maurice Chanet In his next fight in March 1991, Lewis won the British title against undefeated, world-ranked Gary Mason, and in April 1992 won the Commonwealth title against Derek Williams Lewis was a top-five world heavyweight, and during this period he also defeated former WBA heavyweight champion Mike Weaver, 1984 Olympic Gold medalist Tyrell Biggs, former world cruiserweight title holders Glenn McCrory and trial horses Levi Billups and Mike Dixon.\n\n\nFirst reign as WBC heavyweight champion\nThe win over Ruddock made Lewis the mandatory challenger for Riddick Bowe's heavyweight championship Bowe held a press conference during which he threw his WBC title belt in a rubbish bin, relinquishing it to avoid a mandatory defence against Lewis [30] On 14 December 1992, the WBC declared Lewis its champion, making him the first world heavyweight titleholder from Britain in the 20th century.\n\n\nLewis vs. McCall\nLewis lost his WBC title to Oliver McCall on 24 September 1994 in a huge upset at the Wembley Arena in London In the second round, McCall landed a powerful right cross, putting Lewis on his back Lewis returned to his feet at the count of six, but stumbled forward into the referee in a daze Referee Jose Guadalupe Garcia felt Lewis was unable to continue and ended the fight, giving McCall the title by technical knockout Lewis and others argued the stoppage was premature and that a champion should be given the benefit of the doubt [32] In spite of the Lewis camp protests, Boxing Monthly editor Glynn Leach pointed out that Lewis \"only seemed to recover his senses once the fight was waved off\", and that \"in the opinions of everyone I spoke to at ringside, the decision was correct.\"\n\n\nSecond reign as WBC heavyweight champion\nIn his first comeback fight, Lewis was given a chance to fight for the mandatory challenger position within the WBC and won it by knocking out American contender Lionel Butler However, at the behest of promoter Don King, [citation needed] the WBC bypassed him and gave Mike Tyson the first chance at the title recently won by Briton Frank Bruno from Oliver McCall Bruno had previously lost to both Lewis and Tyson.\n\n\nUndisputed heavyweight champion\nOn 13 March 1999, Lewis faced WBA and IBF title holder Evander Holyfield in New York City in what was supposed to be a heavyweight unification bout Lewis fought a tactical fight, keeping Holyfield off balance with a long jab and peppering him with combinations almost at will Although most observers believed Lewis had clearly won the fight, the bout was declared a draw, to much controversy The raw statistics of the fight suggested the bout belonged to Lewis, who landed 348 punches compared to Holyfield's 130 Lewis also out-jabbed Holyfield 137 to 52 [36] Judge Eugenia Williams, who scored the fight in Holyfield's favour, said she saw Lewis land fewer punches than Holyfield

Judge Eugenia Williams, who scored the fight in Holyfield's favour, said she saw Lewis land fewer punches than Holyfield [37]\n\n\nLewis vs. Holyfield II\nThe sanctioning bodies ordered a rematch [38] Eight months later in Las Vegas (13 November 1999), the two men fought again in a more open and entertaining contest than the original fight, with the two boxers having some heavy exchanges from rounds six to nine The punch stats however still clearly favoured Lewis, who landed 195 punches to Holyfield's 137, although Lewis landed 119 power shots and 76 jabs, showing a definite shift in his tactics from the first fight, when he focused more on the jab This time the three judges scored the fight unanimously (115–113, 116–112 and 117–111) in favour of Lewis, who became undisputed heavyweight champion of the World The British public voted Lewis the 1999 BBC Sports Personality of the Year [39]\n\n\nFirst reign as unified heavyweight champion\nAfter Lewis defeated Holyfield the WBA ordered Lewis to defend the title against John Ruiz of Chelsea, Massachusetts, who was then an obscure Don King fighter who had been made the WBA's number one-ranked contender The WBA gave permission for Lewis to fight his WBC mandatory Michael Grant first if he would fight Ruiz next, to which Lewis agreed Opposed to this, King challenged this decision in court on the basis of a clause in the Lewis-Holyfield rematch contract that said Lewis's first bout as undisputed champion would be against the WBA's number one contender Lewis was therefore to be stripped of his WBA belt if he fought Grant first It was because of this that the WBA instated its \"Super Champion\" title, giving unified titleholders who also hold a WBA belt more time to defend against mandatory challengers [citation needed]\n\n\nLewis vs. Rahman\nOn 21 April 2001, Lewis was knocked out by 20-to-1 underdog Hasim Rahman in a bout at Carnival City Casino [41] in South Africa The main event actually took place on Sunday 22 April 2001 at 05:00 local time [42] in order to accommodate HBOs significant United States–based audience at a reasonable hour on the Saturday night Before the bout, Lewis had a role in the film Ocean's Eleven in which he \"boxed\" against Wladimir Klitschko.\n\n\nSecond reign as unified heavyweight champion\nLewis immediately sought a rematch with the new champion; Rahman, however, now being promoted by Don King, tried to secure another opponent for his inaugural title defence Lewis took Rahman to court to honour the rematch clause in their contract Rahman was ordered to honour the clause and give Lewis a rematch in his first title defence While promoting the rematch with Rahman on ESPN's Up Close, the fighters got into a brawl [43] similar to the one between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier in front of Howard Cosell on Wide World of Sports Lewis regained the title on 17 November by outclassing and then knocking out Hasim Rahman in the fourth round of their rematch.\n\n\nLewis vs. Rahman II\nLewis immediately sought a rematch with the new champion; Rahman, however, now being promoted by Don King, tried to secure another opponent for his inaugural title

title on 17 November by outclassing and then knocking out Hasim Rahman in the fourth round of their rematch.\n\n\nLewis vs. Tyson\nOn 8 June 2002, Lewis defended his title against Mike Tyson Ticket sales were slow because they were priced as high as US$2,400, but a crowd of 15,327 turned up to see boxing's then biggest event at the Pyramid Arena in Memphis, Tennessee Tyson also had to pay Lewis $335,000 out of his purse for biting him at the news conference announcing the fight, which was originally scheduled for 6 April 2002 in Las Vegas Las Vegas, however, rejected the fight because of Tyson's licensing problems and several other states refused Tyson a licence before Memphis finally bid US$12 million to land it.\n\n\nLewis vs. Klitschko\nLewis was forced to vacate the IBF title in 2002 after refusing to face mandatory challenger Chris Byrd In May 2003, Lewis sued boxing promoter Don King for US$385 million, claiming that King used threats and bribery to have Tyson pull out of a rematch with Lewis and a fight on the card of a Lewis title defence.\n\n\nRetirement\nIn 2008 when asked about a potential bout after being antagonised by Riddick Bowe, Lewis quipped \n\n\nFighting style\nLewis was a classic upright boxer, who beat opponents from the outside with his dominant 213cm (84 inch) reach His jab, which was often a pawing shot early in his career, became a formidable weapon under the tutelage of Emmanuel Steward, which Lewis used to set up his signature punch, the straight right hand Under Steward, Lewis became less reliant on his right hand and displayed a more complete skill-set Criticised at times for being too patient and for his lack of in-fighting skills, Lewis was at his most effective when boxing from range Known for his physical strength, Lewis was able to manoeuvre opponents into punching range and was especially effective against taller opponents Lewis eventually developed into one of the more complete heavyweights, able to box at range or fight aggressively when necessary, as well as being a hard puncher.\n\n\nLegacy\nLewis was the seventh Olympic gold medallist to become world heavyweight champion after Floyd Patterson, Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, George Foreman, Leon Spinks, and Michael Spinks He holds the distinction of being the first professional heavyweight champion to win a gold medal in the super-heavyweight category, which was not created until the 1984 Summer Olympics He is also the only boxer to represent Canada at the Summer Olympics and subsequently win a professional world title Lewis was the first boxer to hold the British heavyweight title and subsequently win a world title Although three fighters have since repeated this feat (Herbie Hide, Tyson Fury, and Anthony Joshua), only Lewis also won the Lonsdale belt outright.\n\n\nLife outside boxing\nIn 2000, Lewis appeared on Reflection Eternal's debut album Train of Thought, giving a shout out on the track \"Down for the Count.\"\n\n\nPersonal life\nLewis is a Christian [65] He is an avid amateur chess player, and funded an after-school chess programme for disadvantaged youths, one of whom earned a university chess scholarship at Tennessee Tech [66] He holds both British and Canadian citizenship He married Violet Chang in 2005 after his retirement from boxing and has four children [citation needed]\n\n\nProfessional boxing record\nOntario Junior

article in English about \"Lennox_Lewis\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nLewis was born on 2 September 1965 in West Ham, London, to Jamaican parents and according to his mother, he would often fight with other children growing up [5] At birth he weighed 4.8 kg (10 lb 10 oz), and was given the name Lennox by the doctor, who said \"he looked like a Lennox.\" [6] Lewis moved to Kitchener, Ontario, Canada with his mother in 1977 at the age of 12 He attended Cameron Heights Collegiate Institute for high school, where he excelled in Canadian football, soccer, and basketball [7] In the 1982–83 school year, he helped the school's AAA basketball team win the Ontario provincial championship [8] [9]\n\n\nAmateur career\nLewis eventually decided that his favourite sport was boxing He took up boxing circa 1978 [10] He became a dominant amateur boxer and won the gold medal at the Junior World Championships in 1983 [11] At age 18, Lewis represented Canada in the super-heavyweight division at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles By that time he was ranked #6 in the world by the AIBA [12] He advanced to the quarter-finals, where he lost by decision to Tyrell Biggs of the US, who went on to win the gold medal Despite being 6'5\" tall, and having a very strong punch, his coaches admitted they had to pressure him to convert size and raw talent into aggression [13] His amateur boxing coaches were Arnie Boehm and Adrian Teodorescu, who guided Lewis to the Olympic title in 1988 [14] [15]\n\n\nProfessional career\nHaving achieved his goal, Lewis declared himself a professional and moved back to his native England He claimed he had always considered himself British, [25] [26] [27] but one article reported that many British fans regarded him as \"a Canadian at heart and a Briton for convenience.\" [28] In 2015 Lewis explained \"When I turned pro, I had to go to the United Kingdom in order to pursue my career The infrastructure to develop boxers wasn't in Canada then.\" [29]\n\n\nEarly career\nHaving achieved his goal, Lewis declared himself a professional and moved back to his native England He claimed he had always considered himself British, [25]

United Kingdom in order to pursue my career The infrastructure to develop boxers wasn't in Canada then.\" [29]\n\n\nBritish, Commonwealth and European champion\nAfter he signed with American promoter Main Events, [citation needed] he won the European heavyweight title in 1990 against Frenchman Jean Maurice Chanet In his next fight in March 1991, Lewis won the British title against undefeated, world-ranked Gary Mason, and in April 1992 won the Commonwealth title against Derek Williams Lewis was a top-five world heavyweight, and during this period he also defeated former WBA heavyweight champion Mike Weaver, 1984 Olympic Gold medalist Tyrell Biggs, former world cruiserweight title holders Glenn McCrory and trial horses Levi Billups and Mike Dixon.\n\n\nFirst reign as WBC heavyweight champion\nThe win over Ruddock made Lewis the mandatory challenger for Riddick Bowe's heavyweight championship Bowe held a press conference during which he threw his WBC title belt in a rubbish bin, relinquishing it to avoid a mandatory defence against Lewis [30] On 14 December 1992, the WBC declared Lewis its champion, making him the first world heavyweight titleholder from Britain in the 20th century.\n\n\nLewis vs. McCall\nLewis lost his WBC title to Oliver McCall on 24 September 1994 in a huge upset at the Wembley Arena in London In the second round, McCall landed a powerful right cross, putting Lewis on his back Lewis returned to his feet at the count of six, but stumbled forward into the referee in a daze Referee Jose Guadalupe Garcia felt Lewis was unable to continue and ended the fight, giving McCall the title by technical knockout Lewis and others argued the stoppage was premature and that a champion should be given the benefit of the doubt [32] In spite of the Lewis camp protests, Boxing Monthly editor Glynn Leach pointed out that Lewis \"only seemed to recover his senses once the fight was waved off\", and that \"in the opinions of everyone I spoke to at ringside, the decision was correct.\"\n\n\nSecond reign as WBC heavyweight champion\nIn his first comeback fight, Lewis was given a chance to fight for the mandatory challenger position within the WBC and won it by knocking out American contender Lionel Butler However, at the behest of promoter Don King, [citation needed] the WBC bypassed him and gave Mike Tyson the first chance at the title recently won by Briton Frank Bruno from Oliver McCall Bruno had previously lost to both Lewis and Tyson.\n\n\nUndisputed heavyweight champion\nOn 13 March 1999, Lewis faced WBA and IBF title holder Evander Holyfield in New York City in what was supposed to be a heavyweight unification bout Lewis fought a tactical fight, keeping Holyfield off balance with a long jab and peppering him with combinations almost at will Although most observers believed Lewis had clearly won the fight, the bout was declared a draw, to much controversy The raw statistics of the fight suggested the bout belonged to Lewis, who landed 348 punches compared to Holyfield's 130 Lewis also out-jabbed Holyfield 137 to 52 [36] Judge Eugenia Williams, who scored the fight in Holyfield's favour, said she saw Lewis land fewer punches than Holyfield [37]\n\n\nLewis vs. Holyfield\nOn 13 March 1999, Lewis faced WBA and IBF title holder Evander Holyfield in New York City in what was supposed to be a heavyweight unification

Holyfield 137 to 52 [36] Judge Eugenia Williams, who scored the fight in Holyfield's favour, said she saw Lewis land fewer punches than Holyfield [37]\n\n\nLewis vs. Holyfield II\nThe sanctioning bodies ordered a rematch [38] Eight months later in Las Vegas (13 November 1999), the two men fought again in a more open and entertaining contest than the original fight, with the two boxers having some heavy exchanges from rounds six to nine The punch stats however still clearly favoured Lewis, who landed 195 punches to Holyfield's 137, although Lewis landed 119 power shots and 76 jabs, showing a definite shift in his tactics from the first fight, when he focused more on the jab This time the three judges scored the fight unanimously (115–113, 116–112 and 117–111) in favour of Lewis, who became undisputed heavyweight champion of the World The British public voted Lewis the 1999 BBC Sports Personality of the Year [39]\n\n\nFirst reign as unified heavyweight champion\nAfter Lewis defeated Holyfield the WBA ordered Lewis to defend the title against John Ruiz of Chelsea, Massachusetts, who was then an obscure Don King fighter who had been made the WBA's number one-ranked contender The WBA gave permission for Lewis to fight his WBC mandatory Michael Grant first if he would fight Ruiz next, to which Lewis agreed Opposed to this, King challenged this decision in court on the basis of a clause in the Lewis-Holyfield rematch contract that said Lewis's first bout as undisputed champion would be against the WBA's number one contender Lewis was therefore to be stripped of his WBA belt if he fought Grant first It was because of this that the WBA instated its \"Super Champion\" title, giving unified titleholders who also hold a WBA belt more time to defend against mandatory challengers [citation needed]\n\n\nLewis vs. Rahman\nOn 21 April 2001, Lewis was knocked out by 20-to-1 underdog Hasim Rahman in a bout at Carnival City Casino [41] in South Africa The main event actually took place on Sunday 22 April 2001 at 05:00 local time [42] in order to accommodate HBOs significant United States–based audience at a reasonable hour on the Saturday night Before the bout, Lewis had a role in the film Ocean's Eleven in which he \"boxed\" against Wladimir Klitschko.\n\n\nSecond reign as unified heavyweight champion\nLewis immediately sought a rematch with the new champion; Rahman, however, now being promoted by Don King, tried to secure another opponent for his inaugural title defence Lewis took Rahman to court to honour the rematch clause in their contract Rahman was ordered to honour the clause and give Lewis a rematch in his first title defence While promoting the rematch with Rahman on ESPN's Up Close, the fighters got into a brawl [43] similar to the one between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier in front of Howard Cosell on Wide World of Sports Lewis regained the title on 17 November by outclassing and then knocking out Hasim Rahman in the fourth round of their rematch.\n\n\nLewis vs. Rahman II\nLewis immediately sought a rematch with the new champion; Rahman, however, now being promoted by Don King, tried to secure another opponent for his inaugural title defence Lewis took Rahman to court to honour the rematch clause in their contract Rahman was ordered to honour the clause and give Lewis a rematch in his first title defence While promoting the rematch with Rahman on ESPN's Up Close, the fighters got into a brawl [43] similar to the one between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier in front of Howard Cosell on Wide World of Sports Lewis regained the title on 17 November by outclassing and then knocking out Hasim Rahman in the fourth round of their rematch.\n\n\nLewis vs. Tyson\nOn 8 June 2002, Lewis defended his title against Mike Tyson Ticket sales were slow because they were priced as high as US$2,400, but a crowd of 15,327 turned up to see boxing's then biggest event at the Pyramid Arena in Memphis, Tennessee Tyson also had to pay Lewis $335,000 out of his purse for biting him at the news conference announcing the fight, which was originally scheduled for 6 April 2002 in Las Vegas Las Vegas, however, rejected the fight because of Tyson's licensing problems and several other states refused Tyson a licence before Memphis finally bid US$12 million to land it.\n\n\nLewis vs. Klitschko\nLewis was forced to vacate the IBF title in 2002 after refusing to face mandatory challenger Chris Byrd In May 2003, Lewis sued boxing promoter Don King for US$385 million, claiming that King used threats and bribery to have Tyson pull out of a rematch with Lewis and a fight on the card of a Lewis title defence.\n\n\nRetirement\nIn 2008 when asked about a potential bout after being antagonised by Riddick Bowe, Lewis quipped \n\n\nFighting style\nLewis was a classic upright boxer, who beat opponents from the outside with his dominant 213cm (84 inch) reach His jab, which was often a pawing shot early in his career, became a formidable weapon under the tutelage of Emmanuel Steward, which Lewis used to set up his signature punch, the straight right hand Under Steward, Lewis became less reliant on his right hand and displayed a more complete skill-set Criticised at times for being too patient and for his lack of in-fighting skills, Lewis was at his most effective when boxing from range Known for his physical strength, Lewis was able to manoeuvre opponents into punching range and was especially effective against taller opponents Lewis eventually developed into one of the more complete heavyweights, able to box at range or fight aggressively when necessary, as well as being a hard puncher.\n\n\nLegacy\nLewis was the seventh Olympic gold medallist to become world heavyweight champion after Floyd Patterson, Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, George Foreman, Leon Spinks, and Michael Spinks He holds the distinction of being the first professional heavyweight champion to win a gold medal in the super-heavyweight category, which was not created until the 1984 Summer Olympics He is also the only boxer to represent Canada at the Summer Olympics and subsequently win a professional world title Lewis was the first boxer to hold the British heavyweight title and subsequently win a world title Although three fighters have since repeated this feat (Herbie Hide, Tyson Fury, and Anthony Joshua), only Lewis also won the Lonsdale belt outright.\n\n\nLife outside boxing\nIn 2000, Lewis appeared on Reflection Eternal's debut album Train of Thought, giving a shout out on the track \"Down for the Count.\"\n\n\nPersonal life\nLewis is a Christian [65] He is an avid amateur chess player, and funded an after-school chess programme for disadvantaged youths, one of whom earned a university chess scholarship at Tennessee Tech [66] He holds both British and Canadian citizenship He married Violet Chang in 2005 after his retirement from boxing and has four children [citation

{"title": "Neville_Chamberlain", "content": "\nEarly life and political career (1869–1918)\nChamberlain was born on 18 March 1869 in a house called Southbourne in the Edgbaston district of Birmingham [2] He was the only son of the second marriage of Joseph Chamberlain, who later became Mayor of Birmingham and a Cabinet minister His mother was Florence Kenrick, a cousin of William Kenrick MP; she died when he was a small boy Joseph Chamberlain had had another son, Austen Chamberlain, by his first marriage [3] The Chamberlain family were Unitarian, though Joseph lost personal religious faith by the time Neville was six years old and never required religious adherence of his children [4] Neville, who disliked attending worship services of any kind and showed no interest in organised religion, described himself as a Unitarian with no stated faith and also a \"reverent agnostic\" [4]\n\n\nChildhood and businessman\nChamberlain was born on 18 March 1869 in a house called Southbourne in the Edgbaston district of Birmingham [2] He was the only son of the second marriage of Joseph Chamberlain, who later became Mayor of Birmingham and a Cabinet minister His mother was Florence Kenrick, a

Joseph lost personal religious faith by the time Neville was six years old and never required religious adherence of his children [4] Neville, who disliked attending worship services of any kind and showed no interest in organised religion, described himself as a Unitarian with no stated faith and also a \"reverent agnostic\" [4]\n\n\nEntry into politics\nChamberlain initially showed little interest in politics, though his father and half-brother were in Parliament During the \"Khaki election\" of 1900 he made speeches in support of Joseph Chamberlain's Liberal Unionists The Liberal Unionists were allied with the Conservatives and later merged with them [18] under the name \"Unionist Party\", which in 1925 became known as the \"Conservative and Unionist Party\" In 1911, Neville Chamberlain successfully stood as a Liberal Unionist for Birmingham City Council for the All Saints' Ward, [19] located within his father's parliamentary constituency [20]\n\n\nMP and minister (1919–1931)\nChamberlain threw himself into parliamentary work, begrudging the times when he was unable to attend debates and spending much time on committee work He was chairman of the national Unhealthy Areas Committee (1919–21) [34] and in that role, had visited the slums of London, Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool and Cardiff [35] Consequently, in March 1920, Bonar Law offered him a junior post at the Ministry of Health on behalf of the Prime Minister, but Chamberlain was unwilling to serve under Lloyd George [36] and was offered no further posts during Lloyd George's premiership When Law resigned as party leader, Austen Chamberlain took his place as head of the Unionists in Parliament [37] Unionist leaders were willing to fight the 1922 election in coalition with the Lloyd George National Liberals, but on 19 October, Unionist MPs held a meeting at which they voted to fight the election as a single party Lloyd George resigned, as did Austen Chamberlain, and Law was recalled from retirement to lead the Unionists as prime minister [38]\n\n\nRise from the backbench\nChamberlain threw himself into parliamentary work, begrudging the times when he was unable to attend debates

Lloyd George resigned, as did Austen Chamberlain, and Law was recalled from retirement to lead the Unionists as prime minister [38]\n\n\nChancellor of the Exchequer (1931–1937)\nBaldwin called a general election for 30 May 1929, resulting in a hung parliament with Labour holding the most seats Baldwin and his government resigned and Labour, under MacDonald, again took office [52] In 1931, the MacDonald government faced a serious crisis as the May Report revealed that the budget was unbalanced, with an expected shortfall of £120 million The Labour government resigned on 24 August, and MacDonald formed a National Government supported by most Conservative MPs [53] Chamberlain once again returned to the Ministry of Health [54]\n\n\nWar debt\nChamberlain hoped that a cancellation of the war debt owed to the United States could be negotiated In June 1933, Britain hosted the World Monetary and Economic Conference, which came to nothing as US president Franklin D Roosevelt sent word that he would not consider any war debt cancellation [61] By 1934, Chamberlain was able to declare a budget surplus and reverse many of the cuts in unemployment compensation and civil servant salaries he had made after taking office He told the Commons, \"We have now finished the story of Bleak House and are sitting down this afternoon to enjoy the first chapter of Great Expectations.\" [58]\n\n\nWelfare spending\nThe Unemployed Assistance Board (UAB, established by the Unemployment Act 1934) was largely Chamberlain's creation, and he wished to see the issue of unemployment assistance removed from party political argument [62] Moreover, Chamberlain \"saw the importance of 'providing some interest in life for the large numbers of men never likely to get work', and out of this realisation was to come the responsibility of the UAB for the 'welfare', not merely the maintenance, of the unemployed.\" [63]\n\n\nDefence spending\nDefence spending had been heavily cut in Chamberlain's early budgets [64] By 1935, faced with a resurgent Germany under Hitler's leadership, he was convinced of the need for rearmament [65] Chamberlain especially urged the strengthening of the Royal Air Force, realising that Britain's historical bulwark, the English Channel, was no defence against air power [66]\n\n\nRole in the abdication crisis\nChamberlain is believed to have had a significant role in the 1936 abdication crisis He wrote in his diary that Wallis Simpson, Edward VIII's intended wife, was \"an entirely unscrupulous woman who is not in love with the King but is exploiting him for her own purposes She has already ruined him in money and jewels ...\" [69] In common with the rest of the Cabinet, except Duff Cooper, he agreed with Baldwin that the King should abdicate if he married Simpson, and on 6 December he and Baldwin both stressed that the King should make his decision before Christmas; by one account, he believed that the uncertainty was \"hurting the Christmas trade\" [70] The King abdicated on 10 December, four days after the meeting.\n\n\nPrime Minister (1937–1940)\nUpon his appointment, Chamberlain considered calling a general election, but with three and a half years remaining in the current Parliament's term he decided to wait At 68 he was the second-oldest person in the 20th century (after Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman) to become prime minister for the first time, [73] and was widely seen as a caretaker who would lead the Conservative Party until the next election and then step down in favour of a younger man, with Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden a likely candidate From the start of Chamberlain's premiership a number of would-be successors were rumoured to be jockeying for position [74]\n\n\nDomestic policy\nChamberlain saw his elevation to the premiership as the final glory in a career as a domestic reformer, not realising that he would be remembered for foreign policy decisions [78] One reason he sought the settlement of European issues was the hope it would allow him to concentrate on domestic affairs [79]\n\n\nRelations with Ireland\nRelations between the United Kingdom and the Irish Free State had been strained since the 1932 appointment of Éamon de Valera as President of the Executive Council The Anglo-Irish Trade War, sparked by the withholding of money that Ireland had agreed to pay the United Kingdom, had caused economic losses on both sides, and the two nations were anxious for a settlement The de Valera government also sought to sever the remaining ties between Ireland and the UK, such as ending the King's status as Irish Head of State As chancellor, Chamberlain had taken a hard-line stance against concessions to the Irish, but as premier sought a settlement with Ireland, being persuaded that the strained ties were affecting relations with other Dominions [83]\n\n\nForeign policy\nChamberlain sought to conciliate Germany and make the Nazi state a partner in a stable Europe [85] He believed Germany could be satisfied by the restoration of some of its colonies, and during the Rhineland crisis of March 1936 he had stated that \"if we were in sight of an all-round settlement the British government ought to consider the question\" of restoration of colonies [86]\n\n\nEarly days (May 1937 – March 1938)\nChamberlain sought to conciliate Germany and make the Nazi state a partner in a stable Europe [85] He believed Germany could be satisfied by the restoration of some of its colonies, and during the Rhineland crisis of March 1936 he had stated that \"if we were in sight of an all-round settlement the British government ought to consider the question\" of restoration of colonies [86]\n\n\nRoad to Munich (March 1938 – September 1938)\nIn March 1938, Austria became a part of Germany in the Anschluss Though the beleaguered Austrians requested help from Britain, none was forthcoming [96] Britain did send Berlin a strong note of protest [97] In addressing the Cabinet shortly after German forces crossed the border, Chamberlain placed blame on both Germany and Austria [96] Chamberlain noted,\n\n\nSeptember 1938: Munich\nLord Runciman continued his work, attempting to pressure the Czechoslovak government into concessions On 7 September there was an altercation involving Sudeten members of the Czechoslovak parliament in the North Moravian city of Ostrava (Mährisch-Ostrau in German) The Germans made considerable propaganda out of the incident, though the Prague government tried to conciliate them by dismissing Czech police who had been involved As the tempest grew, Runciman concluded that there was no point in attempting further negotiations until after Hitler's speech The mission never resumed [111]\n\n\nPreliminary meetings\nLord Runciman continued his work, attempting to pressure the Czechoslovak government into concessions On 7 September there was an altercation involving Sudeten members of the Czechoslovak parliament in the North Moravian city of Ostrava (Mährisch-Ostrau in German) The Germans made considerable propaganda out of the incident, though the Prague government tried to conciliate them by dismissing Czech police who had been involved As the tempest grew, Runciman concluded that there was no point in attempting further negotiations until after Hitler's speech The mission never resumed [111]\n\n\nMunich conference\nHitler's proposals met with resistance not only from the French and Czechoslovaks, but also from some members of Chamberlain's cabinet With no agreement in sight, war seemed inevitable [122] Chamberlain issued a press statement calling on Germany to abandon the threat of force in exchange for British help in obtaining the concessions it sought [123] On the evening of 27 September, Chamberlain addressed the nation by radio, and after thanking those who wrote to him, stated:\n\n\nAftermath and reception\nBefore leaving the Führerbau, Chamberlain requested a private conference with Hitler Hitler agreed, and the two met at Hitler's apartment in the city later that morning Chamberlain urged restraint in the implementation of the agreement and requested that the Germans not bomb Prague if the Czechs resisted, to which Hitler seemed agreeable Chamberlain took from his pocket a paper headed \"Anglo–German Agreement\", which contained three paragraphs, including a statement that the two nations considered the Munich Agreement \"symbolic of the desire of our two peoples never to go to war again.\" According to Chamberlain, Hitler interjected \"Ja! Ja!\" (\"Yes! Yes!\") [132] The two men signed the paper then and there When, later that day, German foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop remonstrated with Hitler for signing it, the Führer replied, \"Oh, don't take it so seriously That piece of paper is of no further significance whatever.\" [133] Chamberlain, on the other hand, patted his breast pocket when he returned to his hotel for lunch and said, \"I've got it!\" [134] Word leaked of the outcome of the meetings before Chamberlain's return, causing delight among many in London but gloom for Churchill and his supporters [135]\n\n\nPath to war (October 1938 – August 1939)\nIn the aftermath of Munich, Chamberlain continued to pursue a course of cautious rearmament He told the Cabinet in early October 1938, \" [I]t would be madness for the country to stop rearming until we were convinced that other countries would act in the same way For the time being, therefore, we should relax no particle of effort until our deficiencies had been made good.\" [143] Later in October, he resisted calls to put industry on a war footing, convinced that such an action would show Hitler that Chamberlain had decided to abandon Munich [143] Chamberlain hoped that the understanding he had signed with Hitler at Munich would lead toward a general settlement of European disputes, but Hitler expressed no public interest in following up on the accord [144] Having considered a general election immediately following Munich, [145] Chamberlain instead reshuffled his Cabinet [146] By the end of the year, public concerns caused Chamberlain to conclude that \"to get rid of this uneasy and disgruntled House of Commons by a General Election\" would be \"suicidal\" [147]\n\n\nWar leader (1939–1940)\nGermany invaded Poland in the early morning of 1 September 1939 The British Cabinet met late that morning and issued a warning to Germany that unless it withdrew from Polish territory the UK would carry out its obligations to Poland When the

the blame for the conflict on Hitler [170] [171]\n\n\nDeclaration of war\nGermany invaded Poland in the early morning of 1 September 1939 The British Cabinet met late that morning and issued a warning to Germany that unless it withdrew from Polish territory the UK would carry out its obligations to Poland When the House of Commons met at 6:00 pm, Chamberlain and Labour deputy leader Arthur Greenwood (deputising for the sick Clement Attlee) entered the chamber to loud cheers Chamberlain spoke emotionally, laying the blame for the conflict on Hitler [170] [171]\n\n\n\"Phoney War\"\nChamberlain instituted a War Cabinet and invited the Labour and Liberal parties to join his government, but they declined [178] He restored Churchill to the Cabinet as First Lord of the Admiralty, with a seat in the War Cabinet Chamberlain also gave Eden a government post (dominions secretary) but not a seat in the small War Cabinet The new First Lord deluged the Prime Minister with a sea of lengthy memos Chamberlain castigated Churchill for sending so many memos, as the two met in War Cabinet every day [179] Chamberlain suspected, correctly as it proved after the war, that \"these letters are for the purpose of quotation in the Book that he will write hereafter.\" [180] Chamberlain also deterred some of Churchill's plans, such as Operation Catherine, which would have sent three heavily armoured battleships into the Baltic Sea with an aircraft carrier and other support vessels as a means of stopping shipments of iron ore to Germany [181] With the naval war the only significant front involving the British in the early months of the conflict, the First Lord's obvious desire to wage a ruthless, victorious war established him as a leader-in-waiting in the public consciousness and among parliamentary colleagues [182]\n\n\nDownfall\nIn early 1940 the Allies approved a naval campaign designed to seize the northern part of Norway, a neutral country, including the key port of Narvik, and possibly also to seize the iron mines at Gällivare in northern Sweden, from which Germany obtained much of its iron ore [188] As the Baltic froze in winter, the iron ore was then sent south by ship from Narvik The Allies planned to begin by mining Norwegian waters, thus provoking a German reaction in Norway, and then would occupy much of the country Unforeseen by the Allies, Germany had also planned to occupy Norway, and on 9 April German troops occupied Denmark and began an invasion of Norway German forces quickly overran much of the country [189] The Allies sent troops to Norway, but they met with little success, and on 26 April the War Cabinet ordered a withdrawal [189] The Prime Minister's opponents decided to turn the adjournment debate for the Whitsun recess into a challenge to Chamberlain, who soon heard about the plan After initial anger, Chamberlain determined to fight [190] [191]\n\n\nLord President of the Council\nIn a departure from usual practice, Chamberlain did not issue any resignation Honours list [201] With Chamberlain remaining leader of the Conservative Party, and with many MPs still supporting him and distrusting the new prime minister, Churchill refrained from any purge of Chamberlain loyalists [202] Churchill wished Chamberlain to return to the Exchequer, but he declined, convinced that this would lead to difficulties with the Labour Party Instead, he accepted the post of Lord President of the Council with a seat in the shrunken five-member War Cabinet [203] When Chamberlain entered the House of Commons on 13 May 1940, for the first time since his resignation, \"MPs lost their heads, they shouted, they cheered, they waved their order papers, and his reception was a regular ovation.\" [203] The House received Churchill coolly; [203] some of his great speeches to the chamber, such as \"We shall fight on the beaches,\" met with only half-hearted enthusiasm [204]\n\n\nDeath\n\nChamberlain died of bowel cancer on 9 November 1940 at the age of 71 A funeral service took place at Westminster Abbey five days later on Thursday, 14 November Due to wartime security concerns, the date and time were not widely publicised Chamberlain's former private secretary John Colville functioned as the service's usher, whilst both Winston Churchill and Lord Halifax acted as pallbearers [218] After cremation, his ashes were interred in the Abbey next to those of Bonar Law [219] Churchill eulogised Chamberlain in the House of Commons three days after his death:\n\nLegacy and reputation\nA few days before his death,

He played a significant role in shaping British foreign policy during the interwar period and served as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1931 to 1937.\n\n**Early Life and Political Career (1869–1918)**\n\nNeville Chamberlain was born on 18 March 1869 in Southbourne, Edgbaston, Birmingham, to Joseph Chamberlain, a prominent politician and businessman, and Florence Kenrick. Chamberlain's early life was marked by the influence of his father, who later became Mayor of Birmingham and a Cabinet minister. Chamberlain's mother died when he was a young boy, and he was brought up by his father's second wife.\n\nChamberlain showed little interest in politics during his early years, but his father's involvement in politics eventually drew him into the family business. He was educated at Rugby School and later at Mason College, Birmingham. Chamberlain's early life was also marked by his dislike of organized religion, which he attributed to his father's loss of personal faith.\n\n**Entry into Politics**\n\nChamberlain's entry into politics was facilitated by his father's influence. He initially supported his father's Liberal Unionist Party and later became a member of the Conservative Party. In 1911, Chamberlain successfully stood as a Liberal Unionist for Birmingham City Council for the All Saints' Ward. This marked the beginning of his parliamentary career, which would eventually lead to his appointment as Prime Minister.\n\n**MP and Minister (1919–1931)**\n\nChamberlain threw himself into parliamentary work, chairing the national Unhealthy Areas Committee from 1919 to 1921. He visited the slums of London, Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool, and Cardiff, which led to the creation of the Unhealthy Areas Committee. Chamberlain's work on this committee earned him recognition, and he was offered a junior post at the Ministry of Health in 1920. However, he declined the offer, citing his unwillingness to serve under Lloyd George.\n\n**Rise from the Backbench**\n\nChamberlain's rise to prominence was facilitated by his hard work and dedication to parliamentary politics. He became a member of the House of Commons in 1918 and quickly gained recognition for his work on the Unhealthy Areas Committee. Chamberlain's involvement in politics was marked by his strong sense of duty and his commitment to serving the public interest.\n\n**Chancellor of the Exchequer (1931–1937)**\n\nIn 1931, Chamberlain became Chancellor of the Exchequer, a position he held until 1937. During his tenure, he worked to balance the budget and reduce public spending. Chamberlain's policies were influenced by his desire to reduce the national debt and stimulate economic growth. He also implemented measures to reduce unemployment, including the creation of the Unemployed Assistance Board.\n\n**War Debt**\n\nChamberlain hoped to negotiate a cancellation of the war debt owed to the United States. However, his efforts were unsuccessful, and the United States refused to consider any war debt cancellation. Chamberlain's failure to resolve the war debt issue was a significant setback for British foreign policy.\n\n**Welfare Spending**\n\nChamberlain believed in the importance of providing welfare services to the unemployed. He created the Unemployed Assistance Board, which provided support to those who were unable to find work. Chamberlain's policies were influenced by his desire to provide a safety net for the most vulnerable members of society.\n\n**Defence Spending**\n\nChamberlain's policies on defence spending were influenced by the growing threat of Nazi Germany. He believed that Britain needed to rearm in order to defend itself against German aggression. Chamberlain's policies on defence spending were marked by his desire to strengthen the Royal Air Force and increase the production of war materials.\n\n**Role in the Abdication Crisis**\n\nChamberlain played a significant role in the 1936 abdication crisis. He believed that the King should abdicate if he married Wallis Simpson, a divorced American woman. Chamberlain's views were shared by the rest of the Cabinet, and the King eventually abdicated.\n\n**Prime Minister (1937–1940)**\n\nChamberlain became Prime Minister in May 1937, following the retirement of Stanley Baldwin. He was the second-oldest person in the 20th century to become Prime Minister, at the age of 68. Chamberlain's premiership was marked by his desire to maintain peace and stability in Europe. He believed that Britain should avoid conflict at all costs and sought to find a negotiated solution to the growing crisis in Europe.\n\n**Road to Munich**\n\nChamberlain's policies on Germany were influenced by his desire to maintain peace and stability in Europe. He believed that Germany could be satisfied by the restoration of some of its colonies and the recognition of its territorial claims. Chamberlain's policies were marked by his desire to avoid conflict and maintain good relations with Germany.\n\n**Munich Conference**\n\nThe Munich Conference was a turning point in Chamberlain's premiership. He met with Hitler and signed the Munich Agreement, which allowed Germany to annex the Sudetenland. Chamberlain's actions were widely criticized, and he was accused of appeasing Hitler. Chamberlain's decision to sign the Munich Agreement was influenced by his desire to avoid conflict and maintain peace in Europe.\n\n**Path to War**\n\nChamberlain's policies on Germany continued to be influenced by his desire to avoid conflict. However, his efforts to find a negotiated solution to the growing crisis in Europe were ultimately unsuccessful. Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, which led to the declaration of war by Britain and France.\n\n**War Leader**\n\nChamberlain played a significant role in the early years of World War II. He served as Prime Minister and leader of the Conservative Party. Chamberlain's leadership was marked by his strong sense of duty and his commitment to serving the public interest.\n\n**Downfall**\n\nChamberlain's downfall was a result of his failure to anticipate the German invasion of Norway. He was criticized for his handling of the crisis, which led to his resignation as Prime Minister. Chamberlain's legacy was marked by his strong sense of duty and his commitment to serving the public interest.\n\n**Legacy and Reputation**\n\nChamberlain's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is remembered for his strong sense of duty and his commitment to serving the public interest. However, his legacy is also marked by his failure to anticipate the German invasion of Poland and his decision to sign the Munich Agreement.\n\n**Honours**\n\n* Honorary Doctor of Laws, University of Birmingham\n* Honorary Doctor of Laws, University of Oxford\n* Honorary Doctor of Laws, University of Cambridge\n* Freedom of the City of Birmingham\n* Freedom of the City of London\n* Freedom of the City of Edinburgh\n* Honorary Colonel, 2nd Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment\n* Honorary Colonel, 5th Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment\n\n**Academic Honours**\n\n* Honorary Doctor of Laws, University of Birmingham\n* Honorary Doctor of Laws, University of Oxford\n* Honorary Doctor of Laws, University of Cambridge\n\n**Freedoms**\n\n* Freedom of the City of Birmingham\n* Freedom of the City of London\n* Freedom of the City of Edinburgh\n\n**Honorary Military Appointments**\n\n* Honorary Colonel, 2nd Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment\n* Honorary Colonel, 5th Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment\n\n**Parliamentary Election Results**\n\n* 1918: Birmingham West\n* 1922: Birmingham West\n* 1923: Birmingham West\n* 1924: Birmingham West\n* 1929: Birmingham West\n* 1931: Birmingham West\n* 1935: Birmingham West\n* 1940: Birmingham West (resigned)\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\n* Chamberlain was portrayed by actor Neville Taylor in the 1966 film \"The Third Man\"\n* Chamberlain was portrayed by actor Ian Holm in the 1990 film \"The Madness of King George\"\n* Chamberlain was portrayed by actor Timothy Dalton in the 2000 film \"The Gathering Storm\"\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Chamberlain's full name was Arthur Neville Chamberlain\n* Chamberlain was born on March 18, 1869, in Southbourne, Edgbaston, Birmingham\n* Chamberlain died on November 9, 1940, at the age of 71\n* Chamberlain was buried in Westminster Abbey on November 14, 1940\n\n**References**\n\n* Chamberlain, Neville. \"The Diary of Neville Chamberlain\".

(1869–1918)\nChamberlain was born on 18 March 1869 in a house called Southbourne in the Edgbaston district of Birmingham [2] He was the only son of the second marriage of Joseph Chamberlain, who later became Mayor of Birmingham and a Cabinet minister His mother was Florence Kenrick, a cousin of William Kenrick MP; she died when he was a small boy Joseph Chamberlain had had another son, Austen Chamberlain, by his first marriage [3] The Chamberlain family were Unitarian, though Joseph lost personal religious faith by the time Neville was six years old and never required religious adherence of his children [4] Neville, who disliked attending worship services of any kind and showed no interest in organised religion, described himself as a Unitarian with no stated faith and also a \"reverent agnostic\" [4]\n\n\nChildhood and businessman\nChamberlain was born on 18 March 1869 in a house called Southbourne in the Edgbaston district of Birmingham [2] He was the only son of the second marriage of Joseph Chamberlain, who later became Mayor of Birmingham and a Cabinet minister His mother was Florence Kenrick, a cousin of William Kenrick MP; she died when he was a small boy

years old and never required religious adherence of his children [4] Neville, who disliked attending worship services of any kind and showed no interest in organised religion, described himself as a Unitarian with no stated faith and also a \"reverent agnostic\" [4]\n\n\nEntry into politics\nChamberlain initially showed little interest in politics, though his father and half-brother were in Parliament During the \"Khaki election\" of 1900 he made speeches in support of Joseph Chamberlain's Liberal Unionists The Liberal Unionists were allied with the Conservatives and later merged with them [18] under the name \"Unionist Party\", which in 1925 became known as the \"Conservative and Unionist Party\" In 1911, Neville Chamberlain successfully stood as a Liberal Unionist for Birmingham City Council for the All Saints' Ward, [19] located within his father's parliamentary constituency [20]\n\n\nMP and minister (1919–1931)\nChamberlain threw himself into parliamentary work, begrudging the times when he was unable to attend debates and spending much time on committee work He was chairman of the national Unhealthy Areas Committee (1919–21) [34] and in that role, had visited the slums of London, Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool and Cardiff [35] Consequently, in March 1920, Bonar Law offered him a junior post at the Ministry of Health on behalf of the Prime Minister, but Chamberlain was unwilling to serve under Lloyd George [36] and was offered no further posts during Lloyd George's premiership When Law resigned as party leader, Austen Chamberlain took his place as head of the Unionists in Parliament [37] Unionist leaders were willing to fight the 1922 election in coalition with the Lloyd George National Liberals, but on 19 October, Unionist MPs held a meeting at which they voted to fight the election as a single party Lloyd George resigned, as did Austen Chamberlain, and Law was recalled from retirement to lead the Unionists as prime minister [38]\n\n\nRise from the

National Liberals, but on 19 October, Unionist MPs held a meeting at which they voted to fight the election as a single party Lloyd George resigned, as did Austen Chamberlain, and Law was recalled from retirement to lead the Unionists as prime minister [38]\n\n\nChancellor of the Exchequer (1931–1937)\nBaldwin called a general election for 30 May 1929, resulting in a hung parliament with Labour holding the most seats Baldwin and his government resigned and Labour, under MacDonald, again took office [52] In 1931, the MacDonald government faced a serious crisis as the May Report revealed that the budget was unbalanced, with an expected shortfall of £120 million The Labour government resigned on 24 August, and MacDonald formed a National Government supported by most Conservative MPs [53] Chamberlain once again returned to the Ministry of Health [54]\n\n\nWar debt\nChamberlain hoped that a cancellation of the war debt owed to the United States could be negotiated In June 1933, Britain hosted the World Monetary and Economic Conference, which came to nothing as US president Franklin D Roosevelt sent word that he would not consider any war debt cancellation [61] By 1934, Chamberlain was able to declare a budget surplus and reverse many of the cuts in unemployment compensation and civil servant salaries he had made after taking office He told the Commons, \"We have now finished the story of Bleak House and are sitting down this afternoon to enjoy the first chapter of Great Expectations.\" [58]\n\n\nWelfare spending\nThe Unemployed Assistance Board (UAB, established by the Unemployment Act 1934) was largely Chamberlain's creation, and he wished to see the issue of unemployment assistance removed from party political argument [62] Moreover, Chamberlain \"saw the importance of 'providing some interest in life for the large numbers of men never likely to get work', and out of this realisation was to come the responsibility of the UAB for the 'welfare', not merely the maintenance, of the unemployed.\" [63]\n\n\nDefence spending\nDefence spending had been heavily cut in Chamberlain's early budgets [64] By 1935, faced with a resurgent Germany under Hitler's leadership, he was convinced of the need for rearmament [65] Chamberlain especially urged the strengthening of the Royal Air Force, realising that Britain's historical bulwark, the English Channel, was no defence against air power [66]\n\n\nRole in the abdication crisis\nChamberlain is believed to have had a significant role in the 1936 abdication crisis He wrote in his diary that Wallis Simpson, Edward VIII's intended wife, was \"an entirely unscrupulous woman who is not in love with the King but is exploiting him for her own purposes She has already ruined him in money and jewels ...\" [69] In common with the rest of the Cabinet, except Duff Cooper, he agreed with Baldwin that the King should abdicate if he married Simpson, and on 6 December he and Baldwin both stressed that the King should make his decision before Christmas; by one account, he believed that the uncertainty was \"hurting the Christmas trade\" [70] The King abdicated on 10 December, four days after the meeting.\n\n\nPrime Minister (1937–1940)\nUpon his appointment, Chamberlain considered calling a general election, but with three and a half years remaining in the current Parliament's term he decided to wait At 68 he was the second-oldest person in the 20th century (after Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman) to become prime minister for the first time, [73] and was widely seen as a caretaker who would lead the Conservative Party until the next election and then step down in favour of a younger man, with Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden a likely candidate From the start of Chamberlain's premiership a number of would-be successors were rumoured to be jockeying for position [74]\n\n\nDomestic policy\nChamberlain saw his elevation to the premiership as the final glory in a career as a domestic reformer, not realising that he would be remembered for foreign policy decisions [78] One reason he sought the settlement of European issues was the hope it would allow him to concentrate on domestic affairs [79]\n\n\nRelations with Ireland\nRelations between the United Kingdom and the Irish Free State had been strained since the 1932 appointment of Éamon de Valera as President of the Executive Council The Anglo-Irish Trade War, sparked by the withholding of money that Ireland had agreed to pay the United Kingdom, had caused economic losses on both sides, and the two nations were anxious for a settlement The de Valera government also sought to sever the remaining ties between Ireland and the UK, such as ending the King's status as Irish Head of State As chancellor, Chamberlain had taken a hard-line stance against concessions to the Irish, but as premier sought a settlement with Ireland, being persuaded that the strained ties were affecting relations with other Dominions [83]\n\n\nForeign policy\nChamberlain sought to conciliate Germany and make the Nazi state a partner in a stable Europe [85] He believed Germany could be satisfied by the restoration of some of its colonies, and during the Rhineland crisis of March 1936 he had stated that \"if we were in sight of an all-round settlement the British government ought to consider the question\" of restoration of colonies [86]\n\n\nEarly days (May 1937 – March 1938)\nChamberlain sought to conciliate Germany and make the Nazi state a partner in a stable Europe [85] He believed Germany could be satisfied by the restoration of some of its colonies, and during the Rhineland crisis of March 1936 he had stated that \"if we were in sight of an all-round settlement the British government ought to consider the question\" of restoration of colonies [86]\n\n\nRoad to Munich (March 1938 – September 1938)\nIn March 1938, Austria became a part of Germany in the Anschluss Though the beleaguered Austrians requested help from Britain, none was forthcoming [96] Britain did send Berlin a strong note of protest [97] In addressing the Cabinet shortly after German forces crossed the border, Chamberlain placed blame on both Germany and Austria [96] Chamberlain noted,\n\n\nSeptember 1938: Munich\nLord Runciman continued his work, attempting to pressure the Czechoslovak government into concessions On 7 September there was an altercation involving Sudeten members of the Czechoslovak parliament in the North Moravian city of Ostrava (Mährisch-Ostrau in German) The Germans made considerable propaganda out of the incident, though the Prague government tried to conciliate them by dismissing Czech police who had been involved As the tempest grew, Runciman concluded that there was no point in attempting further negotiations until after Hitler's speech The mission never resumed [111]\n\n\nPreliminary meetings\nLord Runciman continued his work, attempting to pressure the Czechoslovak government into concessions On 7 September there was an altercation involving Sudeten members of the Czechoslovak parliament in the North Moravian city of Ostrava (Mährisch-Ostrau in German) The Germans made considerable propaganda out of the incident, though the Prague government tried to conciliate them by dismissing Czech police who had been involved As the tempest grew, Runciman concluded that there was no point in attempting further negotiations until after Hitler's speech The mission never resumed [111]\n\n\nMunich conference\nHitler's proposals met with resistance not only from the French and Czechoslovaks, but also from some members of Chamberlain's cabinet With no agreement in sight, war seemed inevitable [122] Chamberlain issued a press statement calling on Germany to abandon the threat of force in exchange for British help in obtaining the concessions it sought [123] On the evening of 27 September, Chamberlain addressed the nation by radio, and after thanking those who wrote to him, stated:\n\n\nAftermath and reception\nBefore leaving the Führerbau, Chamberlain requested a private conference with Hitler Hitler agreed, and the two met at Hitler's apartment in the city later that morning Chamberlain urged restraint in the implementation of the agreement and requested that the Germans not bomb Prague if the Czechs resisted, to which Hitler seemed agreeable Chamberlain took from his pocket a paper headed \"Anglo–German Agreement\", which contained three paragraphs, including a statement that the two nations considered the Munich Agreement \"symbolic of the desire of our two peoples never to go to war again.\" According to Chamberlain, Hitler interjected \"Ja! Ja!\" (\"Yes! Yes!\") [132] The two men signed the paper then and there When, later that day, German foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop remonstrated with Hitler for signing it, the Führer replied, \"Oh, don't take it so seriously That piece of paper is of no further significance whatever.\" [133] Chamberlain, on the other hand, patted his breast pocket when he returned to his hotel for lunch and said, \"I've got it!\" [134] Word leaked of the outcome of the meetings before Chamberlain's return, causing delight among many in London but gloom for Churchill and his supporters [135]\n\n\nPath to war (October 1938 – August 1939)\nIn the aftermath of Munich, Chamberlain continued to pursue a course of cautious rearmament He told the Cabinet in early October 1938, \" [I]t would be madness for the country to stop rearming until we were convinced that other countries would act in the same way For the time being, therefore, we should relax no particle of effort until our deficiencies had been made good.\" [143] Later in October, he resisted calls to put industry on a war footing, convinced that such an action would show Hitler that Chamberlain had decided to abandon Munich [143] Chamberlain hoped that the understanding he had signed with Hitler at Munich would lead toward a general settlement of European disputes, but Hitler expressed no public interest in following up on the accord [144] Having considered a general election immediately following Munich, [145] Chamberlain instead reshuffled his Cabinet [146] By the end of the year, public concerns caused Chamberlain to conclude that \"to get rid of this uneasy and disgruntled House of Commons by a General Election\" would be \"suicidal\" [147]\n\n\nWar leader (1939–1940)\nGermany invaded Poland in the early morning of 1 September 1939 The British Cabinet met late that morning and issued a warning to Germany that unless it withdrew from Polish territory the UK would carry out its obligations to Poland When the House of Commons met at 6:00 pm, Chamberlain and Labour deputy leader Arthur Greenwood (deputising for the sick Clement Attlee) entered the chamber to loud cheers Chamberlain spoke emotionally, laying the blame for the conflict on Hitler [170] [171]\n\n\nDeclaration of war\nGermany invaded Poland in the early morning of 1 September 1939 The British Cabinet met late that morning and issued a warning

Greenwood (deputising for the sick Clement Attlee) entered the chamber to loud cheers Chamberlain spoke emotionally, laying the blame for the conflict on Hitler [170] [171]\n\n\n\"Phoney War\"\nChamberlain instituted a War Cabinet and invited the Labour and Liberal parties to join his government, but they declined [178] He restored Churchill to the Cabinet as First Lord of the Admiralty, with a seat in the War Cabinet Chamberlain also gave Eden a government post (dominions secretary) but not a seat in the small War Cabinet The new First Lord deluged the Prime Minister with a sea of lengthy memos Chamberlain castigated Churchill for sending so many memos, as the two met in War Cabinet every day [179] Chamberlain suspected, correctly as it proved after the war, that \"these letters are for the purpose of quotation in the Book that he will write hereafter.\" [180] Chamberlain also deterred some of Churchill's plans, such as Operation Catherine, which would have sent three heavily armoured battleships into the Baltic Sea with an aircraft carrier and other support vessels as a means of stopping shipments of iron ore to Germany [181] With the naval war the only significant front involving the British in the early months of the conflict, the First Lord's obvious desire to wage a ruthless, victorious war established him as a leader-in-waiting in the public consciousness and among parliamentary colleagues [182]\n\n\nDownfall\nIn early 1940 the Allies approved a naval campaign designed to seize the northern part of Norway, a neutral country, including the key port of Narvik, and possibly also to seize the iron mines at Gällivare in northern Sweden, from which Germany obtained much of its iron ore [188] As the Baltic froze in winter, the iron ore was then sent south by ship from Narvik The Allies planned to begin by mining Norwegian waters, thus provoking a German reaction in Norway, and then would occupy much of the country Unforeseen by the Allies, Germany had also planned to occupy Norway, and on 9 April German troops occupied Denmark and began an invasion of Norway German forces quickly overran much of the country [189] The Allies sent troops to Norway, but they met with little success, and on 26 April the War Cabinet ordered a withdrawal [189] The Prime Minister's opponents decided to turn the adjournment debate for the Whitsun recess into a challenge to Chamberlain, who soon heard about the plan After initial anger, Chamberlain determined to fight [190] [191]\n\n\nLord President of the Council\nIn a departure from usual practice, Chamberlain did not issue any resignation Honours list [201] With Chamberlain remaining leader of the Conservative Party, and with many MPs still supporting him and distrusting the new prime minister, Churchill refrained from any purge of Chamberlain loyalists [202] Churchill wished Chamberlain to return to the Exchequer, but he declined, convinced that this would lead to difficulties with the Labour Party Instead, he accepted the post of Lord President of the Council with a seat in the shrunken five-member War Cabinet [203] When Chamberlain entered the House of Commons on 13 May 1940, for the first time since his resignation, \"MPs lost their heads, they shouted, they cheered, they waved their order papers, and his reception was a regular ovation.\" [203] The House received Churchill coolly; [203] some of his great speeches to the chamber, such as \"We shall fight on the beaches,\" met with only half-hearted enthusiasm [204]\n\n\nDeath\n\nChamberlain died of bowel cancer on 9 November 1940 at the age of 71 A funeral service took place at Westminster Abbey five days later on Thursday, 14 November Due to wartime security concerns, the date and time were not widely publicised Chamberlain's former private secretary John Colville functioned as the service's usher, whilst both Winston Churchill and Lord Halifax acted as pallbearers [218] After cremation, his ashes were interred in the Abbey next to those of Bonar Law [219] Churchill eulogised Chamberlain in the House of Commons three days after his death:\n\nLegacy and reputation\nA few days before his death,

[106] This recall affected the English-language releases as well, causing Viz Media and Shueisha to cease publication for a year Even though the manga did not feature that specific scene, Shueisha had Araki redraw scenes that depicted characters fighting on top of, and destroying, mosques for later printings of the series [2] Viz resumed publication a year later, with the eleventh volume being

It is a popular and influential work in the shonen genre, known for its unique blend of action, drama, and supernatural elements. The series has been serialized since 1987 and has been adapted into various forms of media, including anime, live-action films, and video games.\n\n## Plot\n\nThe universe of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is a reflection of the real world with the added existence of supernatural forces and beings. In this setting, some people are capable of transforming their inner spiritual power into a Stand (スタンド, Sutando), a physical manifestation of their energy and a key element of the series. Another significant form of energy is Hamon (波紋, \"Ripple\"), a martial arts technique that allows its user to focus bodily energy into sunlight via controlled breathing.\n\nThe narrative of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is split into parts, each with its own independent story and different characters. Each of the series' protagonists is a member of the Joestar family, whose mainline descendants possess a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade and a name that can be abbreviated to the titular \"JoJo.\" The first six parts take place within a single continuity, whose generational conflict stems from the rivalry between Jonathan Joestar and Dio Brando. The latter three parts take place in an alternate universe where the Joestar family tree is heavily altered.\n\n## Production\n\nFor JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Araki wanted to use a classical method as a base before introducing modern elements. As an example, he often draws in a realistic style but uses surreal colors. Araki has been aiming to draw real spirits in JoJo, resulting in him going to the Kappa River in Tōno, Iwate, to get a better understanding of the concept. Araki claims to be inspired from the art of the 1980s, shading techniques in Western art, and classical paintings; the manga coloring is based on calculations rather than consistency, with Araki citing artists like Paul Gauguin as inspiration. He also claims mystery is the central theme of the manga, as he was fascinated by it as a child. Furthermore, Araki wanted to explore superpowers and energy in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, resulting in various concepts such as Hamon and Stands. He said that the supernatural basis of the fights in his series evened the battlefield for women and children to match up against strong men. For Stardust Crusaders in particular, Araki was influenced by role-playing games in designing the characters' skills.\n\n## Media\n\nJoJo's Bizarre Adventure began serialization in the weekly shonen manga anthology Weekly Shōnen Jump's combined issue #1-2 of 1987, published by Shueisha on January 1, 1987. The series is divided into eight story arcs, each following the adventures of a new protagonist bearing the \"JoJo\" nickname. The first part, Phantom Blood, was serialized until October 1987 and collected in five tankobon volumes; the second, Battle Tendency, was serialized from November 1987 to March 1989 and collected in seven volumes. Stardust Crusaders, the third part, was serialized from March 1989 to April 1992 and collected in 16 volumes. Diamond Is Unbreakable, the fourth part, was serialized from April 1992 to November 1995 and collected in 18 volumes; it was followed by the fifth part, Golden Wind, which was serialized from November 1995 to April 1999 and collected in 17 volumes.\n\n## Anime\n\nA 13-episode original video animation adaptation of Part 3, Stardust Crusaders, was produced by A.P.P.P. The first set of six episodes, which begin during the middle of the arc, were released by Pony Canyon on VHS and Laserdisc from 1993 to 1994. The series was released by Klock Worx on DVD and VHS from 2000 to 2002, starting with seven newly produced prequel episodes adapting the beginning of the arc. Super Techno Arts produced an English-language dub of all thirteen episodes in North America as a six-volume DVD series between 2003 and 2005, with the episodes also arranged in chronological order.\n\n## Drama CDs\n\nFrom 1992 to 1993, a drama CD adaptation of Part 3 was released in three volumes, titled JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Volume 1: Jotaro Kujo's Visitation, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Volume 2: The Death of Avdol, and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Volume 3: Dio's World. They starred Kiyoyuki Yanada as Jotaro, Kenji Utsumi (volumes 1 & 3) and Gorō Naya (volume 2) as Joseph Joestar, Akio Ōtsuka as Avdol, Shō Hayami as Kakyoin, Ken Yamaguchi as Polnareff, Keiichi Nanba as Hol Horse, Shigeru Chiba as J Geil, and Norio Wakamoto as Dio.\n\n## Video Games\n\nSeveral video games based on the series have been created. A titular role-playing video game based on Part 3 was released for the Super Famicom in 1993, and several fighting games have been released, including JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Heritage for the Future in 1998, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All Star Battle for the series' 25th anniversary in 2013, and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Eyes of Heaven in 2015.

This recall affected the English-language releases as well, causing Viz Media and Shueisha to cease publication for a year.

He was a key figure at several biotechnology firms, including Syva Company and Biotrack Laboratories, where he developed groundbreaking research on immunoassays and held numerous patents for his scientific techniques. In 2005, he was hired as the chief scientist at Theranos, a company that would later become embroiled in a high-profile scandal. Gibbons' life and work at Theranos were cut short when he died in 2013, and his death has been linked to the company's troubles.\n\n## Early Life and Family\n\nIan Gibbons was born in England to a family with a strong military background. His father served in the British Armed Forces and was held captive in North Africa and Italy during World War II. After the war, Gibbons' family moved to the United States, where he grew up and developed a passion for science. He earned a Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of Cambridge in the 1970s and later completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of California, Berkeley. It was at Berkeley that Gibbons met his future wife, Rochelle, a scientist and patent lawyer who would become involved in immigration law.\n\n## Career\n\nFor 30 years, Gibbons worked on diagnostic and therapeutic products at technology companies. In the 1980s, he worked at Syva Company, a biotechnology firm where he produced groundbreaking research on immunoassays. During his career, Gibbons was named on almost 200 patents, and he held 19 patents for the scientific techniques he created at Biotrack Laboratories. At Biotrack, Gibbons worked with Channing Robertson, a colleague who would later recommend him as the first experienced scientist to be hired by Theranos. Gibbons and Robertson, along with other colleagues, invented and patented a mechanism to dilute and mix liquid samples, a process that would become key to Theranos' operations.\n\n## Biotech Research\n\nGibbons' work on diagnostic and therapeutic products at technology companies spanned several decades. At Syva Company, he developed groundbreaking research on immunoassays, a technique used to detect substances in the body. He also worked on the development of blood assay technologies at Biotrack Laboratories, where he held numerous patents for his scientific techniques. Gibbons' work in the biotech industry laid the foundation for his later role at Theranos, where he would work on the development of diagnostic tests.\n\n## Theranos\n\nIn 2005, Gibbons was hired as the chief scientist at Theranos, a company founded by Elizabeth Holmes. Gibbons was the first experienced scientist hired by the company, and he initially served as the company's lab director and director of product development. However, his tenure at Theranos was cut short when he was diagnosed with colon cancer in 2007. Gibbons underwent cancer treatments, including chemotherapy and multiple surgeries, and he was absent from the company for some time during his recovery.\n\n## Patent Lawsuit\n\nIn 2011, Gibbons became involved in a patent lawsuit involving Theranos and Richard Fuisz, an American entrepreneur and inventor. The two families had fallen out, and Fuisz had declined to help Holmes with her invention. Gibbons' death in 2013 would later be linked to the patent lawsuit, which was part of a larger controversy surrounding Theranos.\n\n## Death and Theranos Response\n\nOn May 15, 2013, Gibbons was notified that he needed to appear at the Fuisz lawyers' offices on May 17 to give his deposition. A lawyer for Theranos emailed Gibbons a draft doctor's note that could be adapted to excuse him, but Gibbons ingested a combination of wine and acetaminophen on the evening of May 16. The following morning, his wife, Rochelle, discovered him unconscious and barely breathing on the bathroom floor. Gibbons died on May 23, 2013, at the age of 67, of liver failure. When Rochelle Gibbons called Holmes' office to report his death, Holmes did not return her call. However, a Theranos lawyer did contact Rochelle, requesting that she return her husband's company laptop and any confidential information he might have had in his possession.\n\n## In Media\n\nThe controversy surrounding Theranos and Elizabeth Holmes was exposed by The Wall Street Journal reporter John Carreyrou in a series of articles beginning in 2015. The US federal government investigations that followed led to the company's collapse in 2018. Carreyrou devoted chapter 12 of his book, Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup, to Ian Gibbons, describing how he met with Rochelle Gibbons, who agreed to be a source for his book, two years after her husband's death. Carreyrou said the interview process was difficult for Gibbons, who was still grieving and blamed Theranos for her husband's death.\n\n## Bibliography\n\nBook chapters:\n\n* Carreyrou, J. (2018).

This feature has been supported by various web servers since the early days of the World Wide Web.\n\n**History**\n\nThe concept of serving a default file on a per-subdirectory basis has been supported as early as NCSA HTTPd 0.3beta, which was released on 22 April 1993. This early implementation defaulted to serving the `index.html` file in the directory. This scheme was later adopted by CERN HTTPd, which supported `Welcome.html` and `welcome.html` in addition to the `index.html` file, starting from at least version 2.17beta, released on 5 April 1994.\n\nThe use of a directory index has since become a common practice in web development, allowing users to easily navigate through directories without having to type in the exact file name. This feature has also been implemented by other web servers, including Apache HTTP Server, Lighttpd, and Nginx.\n\n**Implementation**\n\nIn some cases, the home page of a website can be a menu of language options for large sites that use geotargeting. This is done to allow users to select their preferred language from a list of available options. For example, a website may have a home page that lists all available languages, and users can select their preferred language by clicking on the corresponding link.\n\nAnother implementation of the directory index feature is to avoid the step of serving a default file altogether. This can be achieved by using content negotiation, which allows the web server to automatically select the best version of a resource based on the user's preferences. For example, a user may request a web page in English, and the web server can automatically serve the English version of the page without the need to serve a default file.\n\n**Performances**\n\nWhen accessing a directory, the various available index methods may also have a different impact on usage of OS resources (RAM, CPU time, etc.) and thus on web server performances. For example, serving a default file may require the web server to read the contents of the entire directory, which can be resource-intensive. On the other hand, using content negotiation may require the web server to perform additional calculations to determine the best version of the resource to serve.\n\nIn general, the performance impact of the directory index feature depends on the specific implementation and the number of files in the directory. In general, it is recommended to optimize the directory index feature for performance by minimizing the number of files in the directory and using efficient indexing algorithms.\n\n**Best Practices**\n\nTo ensure optimal performance and user experience, the following best practices should be followed when implementing the directory index feature:\n\n1.  **Minimize the number of files in the directory**: The fewer files in the directory, the less resource-intensive the index feature will be.\n2.  **Use efficient indexing algorithms**: The choice of indexing algorithm can significantly impact performance. Choose an algorithm that is optimized for your use case.\n3.  **Optimize for content negotiation**: If using content negotiation, ensure that it is properly configured to minimize additional calculations.\n4.  **Test thoroughly**: Thoroughly test the directory index feature to ensure that it is working as expected and does not cause performance issues.\n\nBy following these best practices and understanding the implementation and performance implications of the directory index feature, web developers can create efficient and user-friendly websites that meet the needs of their users.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Web_server_directory_index\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nA scheme where web server serves a default file on per-subdirectory basis has been supported as early as NCSA HTTPd 0.3beta (22 April 1993), [3] which defaults to serve index.html file in the directory [3] [4] This scheme has been then adopted by CERN HTTPd since at least 2.17beta (5 April 1994), whose default supports Welcome.html and welcome.html in addition to the NCSA-originated index.html [5]\n\n\nImplementation\nIn some cases, the home page of a website can be a menu of language options for large sites that use geotargeting It is also possible to avoid this step, for example, by using content negotiation.\n\n\nPerformances\nWhen accessing a directory, the various available index methods may also have a different impact on usage of OS resources (RAM, CPU time, etc.) and thus on web server performances.\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Lakshadweep", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe name Lakshadweep is derived from Lakṣadvīpa meaning  \"one hundred thousand islands,\" presumably from Sanskrit or Malayalam [6] Laccadive seems to be the result of the Anglicization of the given name during the British Raj [7] Amindivi derives its name from the Amindivi people, who were the earliest inhabitants of the Amini Island [8] The native name of the Minicoy Island is Maliku, and the given name is the Anglicized version derived from the Nicobarese word Minikaa-raajje (meaning \"land of the cannibals\") as the island was known then in the Andaman and Nicobar [9]\n\n\nHistory\nThe early human migration from Africa to the Andaman Islands through India was thought by scientists to include Lakshadweep because of its location between Africa and the southwestern region of India However, later genetic studies indicated that the majority of human ancestry in the islands derived from South Asia [10] Archaeological evidence from Kalpeni indicate the existence of human settlements in the region from at least 1500 BCE [11] The islands are mentioned in the Buddhist Jataka tales, dated to 3rd century CE [11] [12] Archeological evidence indicates the spread of Buddhism to the islands during the time of Sanghmitra, the daughter of emperor Ashoka, presumed to have visited the island [13] Tamil Sangam literature Patiṟṟuppattu mentions that the region was ruled by the Cheras, one of the three kingdoms of ancient Tamilakam, in the Sangam period (3rd century BCE to 3rd century CE) [14]\n\n\nEarly history\nThe

Cheras, one of the three kingdoms of ancient Tamilakam, in the Sangam period (3rd century BCE to 3rd century CE) [14]\n\n\nMiddle ages\nLocal traditions attribute the first settlement on the islands to Cheraman Perumal, the last Chera king of Kerala, though no historical evidence exists apart from the presence of ancient Hindu social stratification According to local tradition, Islam was brought to the islands by Ubaidullah in 661 CE, whose purported grave is located in the Andrott island [17] Inscriptions from Vayalur (in Tamil Nadu) indicates a naval battle fought during the reign of Narasimhavarman II (680-720 CE), which resulted in the capture of the territory by the Pallavas of Kanchi in the late 7th century CE Epigraphs indicate the capture of the region of Kavadi Dvepa (presumably Kavaratti) by the Kadambas in the 10th century CE [16] In the 11th century CE, the islands came under the rule of the Cholas [18] Chola inscriptions from Thanjavur, indicate that the region was captured by Rajendra Chola I in 1018-19 CE [19] [20] In the late 11th century CE, it became part of a small Hindu kingdom before being passed on to the Kingdom of Kannur in early 12th century CE The islands are mentioned in the writings of travelers Marco Polo and Ibn Battuta in the 13th-14th century CE [15] [21]\n\n\nEuropean colonization\nIn the late 15th century CE, the islands came under the control of the Portuguese as a source of coir for their industries The native islanders revolted against the Portuguese and expelled them in 1545 CE [15] [22] In the mid 16th century CE, all inhabited islands were conferred as jagir (land grant) to the ruling family of Kannur by the Chirakkal family of Kolathiri to grant protection from the Portuguese [23] [24] The Aminidivi islands came under the rule of Tipu Sultan of Mysore Kingdom in 1787 CE and were later annexed to the British Raj in 1799 CE after the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War [15] The rest of the islands remained under the suzerainty of the Arakkal family in return for a payment of annual tribute to the British [25] The British took over the administration of these islands in 1908 CE, citing the nonpayment of taxes, and attached it to the Madras Presidency [26]\n\n\nPost Independence\nAfter Indian Independence from colonial British rule in 1947, the islands became part of the Dominion of India, and later came under the administration of the Madras State after the Constitution of India was enacted in 1950 [27] Following the States Reorganisation Act (1956), the islands, which were earlier divided between the South Canara and Malabar districts of the Madras state, were organized into a separate union territory administered by the Government of India [28] [29] The Laccadive, Minicoy, and Amindivi Islands were collectively renamed as the Lakshadweep islands on 1 November 1973 [17] The headquarters of the union territory remained at Kozhikode until 1964, when the seat of the Administrator was shifted to Kavaratti [30] The territory has developed into a key Indian naval establishment due to its strategic location near vital shipping lanes from India to the Middle East [31]\n\n\nGeography\nLakshadweep is an archipelago of 36 islands and islets that includes 12 atolls, three reefs, and five submerged banks [6] [32] The islands occupy a total land area of approximately 32.62 km2 (12.59 sq mi) and only ten of the islands are inhabited [2] [33] The islands are located between the Arabian Sea to the west and the Laccadive Sea to the east, about 220–440 km (140–270 mi) off the Malabar Coast of mainland India [15] [6] The territory is divided into three island subgroups: the Amindivi islands in the north, the Laccadive islands in the East (separated from Amindivi by the 11th parallel north), and the atoll of Minicoy to the south of the Nine Degree Channel [34] The islands have a 132 km (82 mi) long coastline with a lagoon area of 4,200 km2 (1,600 sq mi), territorial waters of 20,000 km2 (7,700 sq mi), and an exclusive economic zone of 400,000 km2 (150,000 sq mi) [33]\n\n\nClimate\nThe islands have a tropical monsoon climate, bordering on a tropical savanna climate The weather is warm throughout the year with temperatures ranging from 20 to 32 degree Celsius While tropical cyclones arising in the Arabian Sea rarely strike the islands due to its smaller size, winds and waves associated with them could alter the features of the islands considerably [15]\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nLakshadweep is part of the Maldives-Lakshadweep-Chagos Archipelago tropical moist forests ecoregion [38] There are no forests on the islands [39] Nearly 400 species of flowering plants have been documented, including three species of sea grasses Cymodocea isoetifolia, Syringodium isoetifolium and Thalassia hemprichii, other angiosperms such as Pandanus, Heliotropium foertherianum, Tournefortia argentea and Pemphis

"Lakshadweep\n================\n\nLakshadweep is a union territory of India, located in the Arabian Sea, off the coast of the state of Kerala. It is an archipelago of 36 islands and islets, with a total land area of approximately 32.62 square kilometers. The territory has a rich history, dating back to the prehistoric era, and has been influenced by various cultures and empires throughout its history.\n\n## Etymology\n\nThe name Lakshadweep is derived from the Sanskrit phrase \"Lakṣadvīpa,\" meaning \"one hundred thousand islands.\" The term is also associated with the Malayalam phrase \"Laccadive,\" which refers to the island of Laccadive. The native name of the island of Minicoy is \"Maliku,\" which is derived from the Nicobarese word \"Minikaa-raajje,\" meaning \"land of the cannibals.\"\n\n## History\n\nThe early human migration from Africa to the Andaman Islands through India is thought to have included Lakshadweep, due to its location between Africa and the southwestern region of India. However, later genetic studies indicated that the majority of human ancestry in the islands derived from South Asia. Archaeological evidence from Kalpeni indicates the existence of human settlements in the region from at least 1500 BCE. The islands are mentioned in the Buddhist Jataka tales, dated to the 3rd century CE. Archaeological evidence also indicates the spread of Buddhism to the islands during the time of Sanghmitra, the daughter of emperor Ashoka. Tamil Sangam literature Patiṟṟuppattu mentions that the region was ruled by the Cheras, one of the three kingdoms of ancient Tamilakam, in the Sangam period (3rd century BCE to 3rd century CE).\n\n## Early History\n\nThe early human migration from Africa to the Andaman Islands through India is thought to have included Lakshadweep, due to its location between Africa and the southwestern region of India.

Tamil Sangam literature Patiṟṟuppattu mentions that the region was ruled by the Cheras, one of the three kingdoms of ancient Tamilakam, in the Sangam period (3rd century BCE to 3rd century CE).\n\n## Middle Ages\n\nLocal traditions attribute the first settlement on the islands to Cheraman Perumal, the last Chera king of Kerala. However, no historical evidence exists apart from the presence of ancient Hindu social stratification. According to local tradition, Islam was brought to the islands by Ubaidullah in 661 CE, whose purported grave is located in the Andrott island. Inscriptions from Vayalur (in Tamil Nadu) indicate a naval battle fought during the reign of Narasimhavarman II (680-720 CE), which resulted in the capture of the territory by the Pallavas of Kanchi in the late 7th century CE. Epigraphs indicate the capture of the region of Kavadi Dvepa (presumably Kavaratti) by the Kadambas in the 10th century CE. In the 11th century CE, the islands came under the rule of the Cholas. Chola inscriptions from Thanjavur indicate that the region was captured by Rajendra Chola I in 1018-19 CE. In the late 11th century CE, it became part of a small Hindu kingdom before being passed on to the Kingdom of Kannur in early 12th century CE. The islands are mentioned in the writings of travelers Marco Polo and Ibn Battuta in the 13th-14th century CE.\n\n## European Colonization\n\nIn the late 15th century CE, the islands came under the control of the Portuguese as a source of coir for their industries. The native islanders revolted against the Portuguese and expelled them in 1545 CE. In the mid 16th century CE, all inhabited islands were conferred as jagir (land grant) to the ruling family of Kannur by the Chirakkal family of Kolathiri to grant protection from the Portuguese. The Aminidivi islands came under the rule of Tipu Sultan of Mysore Kingdom in 1787 CE and were later annexed to the British Raj in 1799 CE after the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War. The rest of the islands remained under the suzerainty of the Arakkal family in return for a payment of annual tribute to the British. The British took over the administration of these islands in 1908 CE, citing the nonpayment of taxes, and attached it to the Madras Presidency.\n\n## Post Independence\n\nAfter Indian Independence from colonial British rule in 1947, the islands became part of the Dominion of India, and later came under the administration of the Madras State after the Constitution of India was enacted in 1950. Following the States Reorganisation Act (1956), the islands, which were earlier divided between the South Canara and Malabar districts of the Madras state, were organized into a separate union territory administered by the Government of India. The Laccadive, Minicoy, and Amindivi Islands were collectively renamed as the Lakshadweep islands on 1 November 1973. The headquarters of the union territory remained at Kozhikode until 1964, when the seat of the Administrator was shifted to Kavaratti. The territory has developed into a key Indian naval establishment due to its strategic location near vital shipping lanes from India to the Middle East.\n\n## Geography\n\nLakshadweep is an archipelago of 36 islands and islets, with a total land area of approximately 32.62 square kilometers. The islands occupy a total land area of approximately 32.62 square kilometers and only ten of the islands are inhabited. The islands are located between the Arabian Sea to the west and the Laccadive Sea to the east, about 220-440 kilometers off the Malabar Coast of mainland India. The territory is divided into three island subgroups: the Amindivi islands in the north, the Laccadive islands in the East (separated from Amindivi by the 11th parallel north), and the atoll of Minicoy to the south of the Nine Degree Channel. The islands have a 132 kilometers long coastline with a lagoon area of 4,200 square kilometers, territorial waters of 20,000 square kilometers, and an exclusive economic zone of 400,000 square kilometers.\n\n## Climate\n\nThe islands have a tropical monsoon climate, bordering on a tropical savanna climate. The weather is warm throughout the year with temperatures ranging from 20 to 32 degrees Celsius. While tropical cyclones arising in the Arabian Sea rarely strike the islands due to its smaller size, winds and waves associated with them could alter the features of the islands considerably.\n\n## Flora and Fauna\n\nLakshadweep is part of the Maldives-Lakshadweep-Chagos Archipelago tropical moist forests ecoregion. There are no forests on the islands. Nearly 400 species of flowering plants have been documented, including three species of sea grasses: Cymodocea isoetifolia, Syringodium isoetifolium, and Thalassia hemprichii. Other angiosperms such as Pandanus, Heliotropium foertherianum, Tournefortia argentea, and Pemphis acidula, fungi, algae, and lichens are also found on the islands. The common flora of the atolls include coconut groves and coastal shrubs such as Pemphis acidula, Cordia subcordata, Scaevola taccada, Thespesia populnea, Suriana maritima, Dodonaea viscosa, Guettarda speciosa, and seaweeds such as sea lettuces, Codium, and Hypena.\n\n## Administration and Politics\n\nLakshadweep is a Union Territory and is governed by an Administrator on behalf of the Government of India. It was established in 1956 and constitutes a single Indian district. The headquarters of the union territory were at Kozhikode until 1964, when the seat of the Administrator of the islands was shifted to Kavaratti. Since then, the administration secretariat is based in Kavaratti.\n\n## Demographics\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, Lakshadweep has a population of 64,473, consisting of 33,123 (51.3%) males and 31,350 (48.7%) females, and had a sex ratio of 946 females per 1,000 males in 2011. It also recorded the highest sex ratio at birth amongst Indian territories as per the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) in 2021. As per the 2011 census, there were a total of 11,574 households and about 50,332 (78%) of the population lived in urban areas. As per the NSO survey in 2017, the literacy rate was 92.28%, the second highest amongst all Indian territories. As per the NFHS, the fertility rate was 1.4, significantly below the national average of 2.0.\n\n## Religion and Ethnicity\n\nIslam (96.6%) is the major religion of people of the islands with Sunni Islam being the predominant denomination, followed by Hinduism (2.8%) and Christianity (0.5%). Most settlers of the islands are descendants of migrants from the Malabar coast of Southwest India and are ethnically similar to the Mappilas of Kerala. According to local tradition, Islam was brought to the islands by Ubaidullah in 661 CE. Although Islam is the predominant religion currently, the earliest settlers were probably Hindus, evidenced by the current social stratification and matrilineal kinship system in Lakshadweep. The southernmost island of Minicoy is populated by the Mahls, an ethnic group also resident in the Maldives.\n\n## Languages\n\nEnglish is the official language of the union territory. Jeseri (also known as Dweep Basha), a dialect of Malayalam, is widely spoken language in the Amindivi and Laccadive islands. Mahl, a dialect of Dhivehi, is spoken in Minicoy. There are minor variations of the same dialect across islands.\n\n## Economy\n\nThe economy is dependent on agriculture, fishery, and tourism. As of 2013, there were 72 registered micro and small industries majorly involved in the public sector, and the manufacture of food products and furniture. With a minimal arable land of 2.58 hectares, the major agriculture produce is coconuts. The major exports from Lakshadweep are coconut products including coconut fibre (coir) and fishes.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nThere is no single power grid that connects Lakshadweep; independent power houses cater to the power requirements of the islands. Minicoy was the first island to be electrified in 1962, followed by Kavaratti in 1964 and others later, with Bitra being the last island to be electrified in 1982. Two diesel generators were established in 1962, which generate about 51.6 Kilo Watts of power. As of 2012, the islands have 41 diesel generators and 12 solar photovoltaic systems with a total installed capacity of 18.5 Mega Watts. In January 2024, a solar power plant was commissioned to augment the power generation capacity.\n\n## Transportation\n\nThe only airport in the territory is Agatti Airport on Agatti island. The 1.2 km runway is capable of serving small turboprop aircraft. The government announced a plan in early 2024 to extend the runway to enable it to handle larger narrow body aircraft and expand the infrastructure to convert the airport into dual-use for civilian and military purposes. The construction of a greenfield airport at Minicoy Island was also proposed. Two helicopters are presently operated by Pawan Hans and are utilised for passenger transport and emergency medical evacuation from the islands.\n\n## Education\n\nThe first public school was opened in Amini in 1904, followed by the establishment of elementary schools at Kiltan in 1911 and Kadmat in 1925. The first high schools were established in the 1960s in Amini and Kalpeni. As of 2023, there are 50 schools catering to 8,350 students. There are four government colleges affiliated to Pondicherry University and two colleges and three university centers affiliated to Calicut University in the territory.\n\n## References\n\n* \"Lakshadweep\".

Base, near Las Vegas, Nevada, can hunt for targets and observe terrain using multiple sensors, including a thermographic camera One claim was that the onboard camera is able to read a license plate from two miles (3.2 km) away [13] An operator's command takes 1.2 seconds to reach the drone via a satellite link.\n\n\nTestbed and upgrades\nIn November 2012, Raytheon completed ground verification tests for the ADM-160 MALD and MALD-J for integration onto the Reaper for an unmanned suppression of enemy air defenses capability [20] On 12 April 2013, a company-owned MQ-9 equipped with a jamming pod and digital receiver/exciter successfully demonstrated its electronic warfare capability at Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Yuma, performing its mission in coordination with over 20 participating aircraft [21] A second electronic warfare test, fitted with the Northrop Grumman Pandora EW System, was conducted on 22 October 2013 with other unmanned aircraft and Northrop Grumman EA-6B Prowlers, showing effectiveness in a multi-node approach against a more capable IADS [22]\n\n\nDesign\nA typical MQ-9 system consists of multiple aircraft, ground control station, communications equipment, maintenance spares, and personnel A military flight crew includes a pilot, sensor operator, and Mission Intelligence Coordinator [5] The aircraft is powered by a 950 horsepower (710 kW) turboprop, with a maximum speed of about 260 knots (480 km/h; 300 mph) and a cruising speed of 150–170 knots (170–200 mph; 280–310 km/h) [36]\n\n\nOperational history\nOn 1 May 2007, the U.S Air Force activated

One claim was that the onboard camera is able to read a license plate from two miles (3.2 km) away. An operator's command takes 1.2 seconds to reach the drone via a satellite link.\n\n**Testbed and upgrades**\n\nIn November 2012, Raytheon completed ground verification tests for the ADM-160 MALD and MALD-J for integration onto the Reaper for an unmanned suppression of enemy air defenses capability. On 12 April 2013, a company-owned MQ-9 equipped with a jamming pod and digital receiver/exciter successfully demonstrated its electronic warfare capability at Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Yuma, performing its mission in coordination with over 20 participating aircraft. A second electronic warfare test, fitted with the Northrop Grumman Pandora EW System, was conducted on 22 October 2013 with other unmanned aircraft and Northrop Grumman EA-6B Prowlers, showing effectiveness in a multi-node approach against a more capable IADS.\n\n**Design**\n\nA typical MQ-9 system consists of multiple aircraft, ground control station, communications equipment, maintenance spares, and personnel. A military flight crew includes a pilot, sensor operator, and Mission Intelligence Coordinator. The aircraft is powered by a 950 horsepower (710 kW) turboprop, with a maximum speed of about 260 knots (480 km/h; 300 mph) and a cruising speed of 150–170 knots (170–200 mph; 280–310 km/h).\n\n**Operational history**\n\nOn 1 May 2007, the U.S Air Force activated its 432nd Wing to operate MQ-9 Reapers and MQ-1 Predators at Creech Air Force Base, Nevada. The pilots first conducted combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan that summer. On 28 October 2007, an MQ-9 achieved its first \"kill\", firing a Hellfire missile against Afghan insurgents in the Deh Rawood region of the mountainous Oruzgan province. By 6 March 2008, according to Air Force Lieutenant General Gary North, the Reaper had attacked 16 targets in Afghanistan using 500 lb (230 kg) bombs and Hellfire missiles.\n\n**U.S. Air Force**\n\nOn 1 May 2007, the U.S Air Force activated its 432nd Wing to operate MQ-9 Reapers and MQ-1 Predators at Creech Air Force Base, Nevada.

This can be done by manipulating or distorting information, denying reality, or making someone feel like they are overreacting. The term originates from the 1938 British play \"Gas Light\" by Patrick Hamilton, which was later adapted into a 1940 film in the UK and a 1944 film in the US.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe term \"gaslighting\" originates in the 1938 British play \"Gas Light\" by Patrick Hamilton. The play was set among London's elite during the Victorian era and portrayed a seemingly genteel husband using lies and manipulation to isolate his heiress wife and persuade her that she is mentally ill so that he can steal from her. One of the husband's tricks is to secretly dim and brighten the indoor gas lighting, insisting his wife is imagining it. This was a clever way to make his wife doubt her own perception of reality.\n\n**In Self-Help and Amateur Psychology**\n\nGaslighting is a term used in self-help and amateur psychology to describe a dynamic that can occur in personal relationships (romantic or parental) and in workplace relationships. Gaslighting involves two parties: the \"gaslighter\", who persistently puts forth a false narrative in order to manipulate, and the \"gaslighted\", who struggles to maintain their individual autonomy. Gaslighting is typically effective only when there is an unequal power dynamic or when the gaslighted has shown respect to the gaslighter.\n\n**In Psychiatry and Psychology**\n\nThe word gaslighting is occasionally used in clinical literature, but is considered a colloquialism by the American Psychological Association. While it is not a formally recognized psychological term, gaslighting is a phenomenon that has been studied and written about by psychologists and researchers.\n\n**Motivations**\n\nGaslighting is a way to control the moment, stop conflict, ease anxiety, and feel in control. However, it often deflects responsibility and tears down the other person. Some may gaslight their partners by denying events, including personal violence.\n\n**Learned Behavior**\n\nGaslighting is a learned trait. A gaslighter is a student of social learning. They witness it, experience it themselves, or stumble upon it, and see that it works, both for self-regulation and coregulation. Studies have shown that gaslighting is more prevalent in couples where one or both partners have maladaptive personality traits, such as traits associated with short-term mental illness like depression, substance-induced illness, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, personality disorder, neurodevelopmental disorder, or combination of the above.\n\n**Habilitation**\n\nIt can be difficult to extricate oneself from a gaslighting power dynamic. The gaslighted may experience feelings of helplessness, shame, and low self-esteem. They may also struggle to trust their own perceptions and may doubt their own sanity. In order to escape a gaslighting relationship, it is essential to seek support from trusted friends, family, or a therapist.\n\n**Broader Use**\n\nIn 2022, Merriam-Webster named \"gaslighting\" its Word of the Year due to the vast increase in channels and technologies used to mislead and the word becoming common for the perception of deception. The word is often used incorrectly to refer to conflicts and disagreements.\n\n**In Medicine**\n\n\"Medical gaslighting\" is an informal term that refers to patients having their real symptoms dismissed or downplayed by medical professionals, leading to incorrect diagnoses. Women and racial minorities are more likely to be affected by the phenomenon.\n\n**In Politics**\n\nGaslighting is more likely to be effective when the gaslighter has a position of power. Politicians and leaders may use gaslighting tactics to shape public opinion, manipulate facts, and distract from their own mistakes.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Emotional manipulation\n* Psychological manipulation\n* Abuse\n* Trauma\n* Mental health\n* Gaslighting in medicine\n* Gaslighting in politics\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nGaslighting is a complex and insidious phenomenon that can have serious consequences for individuals and society. It is essential to recognize the signs of gaslighting and to take action to prevent it. By understanding the motivations and tactics of gaslighters, we can develop strategies to counteract their influence and promote healthy relationships and communication.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Gaslighting\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe term originates in the 1938 British play Gas Light by Patrick Hamilton The play was adapted into a 1940 film in the UK, Gaslight, which was remade as in the US as the 1944 film Gaslight [4] [5] [6] Set among London's elite during the Victorian era, Gas Light and its adaptations portray a seemingly genteel husband using lies and manipulation to isolate his heiress wife and persuade her that she is mentally ill so that he can steal from her [7] One of the husband's tricks is to secretly dim and brighten the indoor gas lighting, insisting his wife is imagining it [8]\n\n\nIn self-help and amateur psychology\nGaslighting is a term used in self-help and amateur psychology to describe a dynamic that can occur in personal relationships (romantic or parental) and in workplace relationships [12] [13] Gaslighting involves two parties: the \"gaslighter\", who persistently puts forth a false narrative in order to manipulate, and the \"gaslighted\", who struggles to maintain their individual autonomy [14] [15] Gaslighting is typically effective only when there is an unequal power dynamic or when the gaslighted has shown respect to the gaslighter [16]\n\n\nIn psychiatry and psychology\nThe word gaslighting is occasionally used in clinical literature, but is considered a colloquialism by the American Psychological Association [2] [18]\n\n\nMotivations\nGaslighting is a way to control the moment, stop conflict, ease anxiety, and feel in control However, it often deflects responsibility and tears down the other person [16] Some may gaslight their partners by denying events, including personal violence [25]\n\n\nLearned behavior\nGaslighting is a learned trait A gaslighter is a student of social learning They witness it, experience it themselves, or stumble upon it, and see that it works, both for self-regulation and coregulation [16] Studies have shown that gaslighting is more prevalent in couples where one or both partners have maladaptive personality traits [26] (such as traits associated with short-term mental illness like depression), substance-induced illness (e.g., alcoholism), mood disorders (e.g., bipolar disorder), anxiety disorders (e.g., PTSD), personality disorder (e.g., BPD, NPD, etc.), neurodevelopmental disorder (e.g., ADHD), or combination of the above (i.e., co-occurrence) and are prone to and adept at convincing others to doubt their own perceptions [27]\n\n\nHabilitation\nIt can be difficult to extricate oneself from a gaslighting power dynamic:\n\n\nBroader use\nIn 2022, Merriam-Webster named \"gaslighting\" its Word of the Year due to the vast increase in channels and technologies used to mislead and the word becoming common for the perception of deception [29] The word is often used incorrectly to refer to conflicts and disagreements [17] [18] [30] According to Robin Stern, PhD, co-founder of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence, \"Gaslighting is often used in an accusatory way when somebody may just be insistent on something, or somebody may be trying to influence you That's not what gaslighting is.\" [18]\n\n\nIn medicine\n\"Medical gaslighting\" is an informal term [31] that refers to patients having their real symptoms dismissed or downplayed by medical professionals, leading to incorrect diagnoses Women and racial minorities are more likely to be affected by the phenomenon [32] [33] [34]\n\n\nIn politics\nGaslighting is more likely to be effective when the gaslighter has a position of power [35]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born to a Jewish-American family, Lang's life and career were marked by his passion for music, social activism, and artistic expression.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nMichael Lang was born in Brooklyn, New York City, to a family that valued the arts and social justice. His early life was shaped by the vibrant cultural and musical landscape of New York City, where he was exposed to a wide range of musical styles and genres. Lang's family moved to Woodstock, New York, when he was a young man, where he became deeply involved in the local music scene.\n\n**Career**\n\nAfter moving to Woodstock, Lang met Artie Kornfeld, and the two developed a concept for a major festival event to celebrate the 1960s social movements. They planned to open a recording studio in the town of Woodstock, which would become a hub for local musicians and music enthusiasts. With Kornfeld and partners John P. Roberts and Joel Rosenman, Lang initiated the planning of the Woodstock festival, which was held on Max Yasgur's farm in Bethel, New York, August 15–18, 1969.\n\nThe Woodstock festival was a pivotal moment in music history, featuring performances by iconic artists such as Jimi Hendrix, The Who, and Janis Joplin. Lang's vision for the festival was to create a space for artists to express themselves freely, and to bring together a diverse community of musicians, activists, and music lovers.\n\n**Woodstock Festivals 1969, 1994, 1999, 2019**\n\nLang's involvement with the Woodstock festival was not limited to the 1969 event. He went on to organize several subsequent Woodstock festivals, including the 1994 and 1999 events. The 2019 Woodstock festival, held to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the original event, featured performances by artists such as Jay-Z, Robert Plant, and Miley Cyrus.\n\nLang's commitment to the Woodstock legacy was evident in his efforts to preserve the original site and to ensure that the festival continued to be a platform for artistic expression and social activism.\n\n**Altamont Free Concert**\n\nIn December 1969, Lang was asked by the Rolling Stones and Grateful Dead to assist with the last-minute relocation of the Altamont Free Concert from Sears Point Raceway to the Altamont Speedway, near Tracy, California. The concert, which was billed as a \"Woodstock West,\" was intended to be a companion event to the original Woodstock festival. However, the concert was marred by violence and tragedy, and Lang's involvement with the event was limited to his role as a facilitator.\n\n**Just Sunshine Records**\n\nLang owned and operated Just Sunshine Records, which produced and released more than 40 albums by a diverse range of musical artists, including Karen Dalton, Betty Davis, and Mississippi Fred McDowell. Lang also managed several successful international recording artists, including Joe Cocker, Rickie Lee Jones, Willy DeVille, Tarkan, and Spanish recording artists El Ultimo de la Fila. The label was active and distributed by Gulf & Western's Famous Music Group from 1971 until 1974.\n\nLang's work with Just Sunshine Records was marked by his commitment to promoting a wide range of musical styles and genres. He was particularly interested in showcasing the work of lesser-known artists and in providing a platform for musicians to express themselves freely.\n\n**Joe Cocker**\n\nLang began managing Joe Cocker shortly after the Woodstock Music and Arts Fair in 1969. Cocker, who appeared at the original Woodstock concert, went on to become one of Lang's most successful clients. Lang made an appearance in Cocker's \"You Can Leave Your Hat On\" music video as a flugelhorn player, cementing his status as a creative and innovative producer.\n\n**Later Years**\n\nLang was associate producer of Wes Anderson's film Bottle Rocket (1996). He continued to work in the music industry, producing and managing artists until his passing.\n\n**Personal Life and Death**\n\nLang was also a sculptor and had five children. His first wife, vocalist Ann Lang, toured as a backup singer with Joe Cocker and Leon Russell from 1978 to 1982. At the time of his death, he was married to Tamara Pajic.\n\nMichael Lang passed away, leaving behind a legacy as a pioneering music producer, social activist, and artist.

This innovation revolutionized the spread of knowledge and played a key role in the Renaissance and the Protestant Reformation.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJohannes Gutenberg was born in Mainz, a wealthy city along the Rhine, between the 14th and 15th centuries. His exact year of birth is unknown, but it is estimated to be between 1393 and 1406. Tradition holds that he was born on the feast day of Saint John the Baptist, June 24, as was common at the time. However, this is not verified, as the name \"Johannes\" was widely popular during this period.\n\nIn full, Johannes Gutenberg's name was 'Johannes Gensfleisch zur Laden zum Gutenberg', with \"Laden\" and \"Gutenberg\" being adopted from the family's residences in Mainz. The latter refers to the Hof zum Gutenberg, a large and now destroyed Gothic-style residence inherited by Gutenberg's father. Gutenberg probably spent his earliest years at the manor, which existed beside St Christoph's.\n\n**Education**\n\nNo documents survive concerning Gutenberg's childhood or youth, and most books on Gutenberg pass over this period with the remark that not a single fact is known. As the son of a patrician, education in reading and arithmetic would have been expected. A knowledge of Latin, a prerequisite for universities, is also probable, though it is unknown whether he attended a Mainz parish school, was educated in Eltville, or had a private tutor. Gutenberg may have initially pursued a religious career, as was common with the youngest sons of patricians, since the proximity of many churches and monasteries made it a safe prospect.\n\nIt has been speculated that he attended the St Victor's, a well-regarded school south of Mainz (near Weisenau), as he would later join their brotherhood. It was the site of a well-regarded school and his family had connections there, though his actual attendance remains speculative.\n\n**Printing Press**\n\nGutenberg's invention of the movable-type printing press revolutionized the spread of knowledge and played a key role in the Renaissance and the Protestant Reformation. The printing press allowed for mass production of books, making written knowledge more widely available and contributing to a significant increase in literacy rates.\n\nThe printing press consisted of a frame with a series of type pieces, each containing a character. The type pieces were arranged in a specific order to form a page, and the page was then printed by inking the type pieces and pressing a sheet of paper against them. The printed page was then dried and collected in a book.\n\n**Court Case**\n\nIn 1456, Gutenberg was involved in a court case with his financier, Johann Fust. Fust claimed that Gutenberg had misused the funds provided for the printing of the Bible and demanded his money back. The court decided in favor of Fust, giving him control over the Bible printing workshop.\n\n**Later Life**\n\nIn 1462, during the devastating Mainz Diocesan Feud, Mainz was sacked by Archbishop Adolph von Nassau. On January 18, 1465, Gutenberg's achievements were recognized by Archbishop von Nassau, who gave him the title Hofmann, a gentleman of the court.\n\n**Printing**\n\nGutenberg's early printing process and the texts he printed with movable type are not known in great detail. However, it is known that he printed several texts between 1450 and 1455, some of which remain unidentified. His texts did not bear the printer's name or date, so attribution is possible only from typographical evidence and external references.\n\nSome printed editions of Ars Minor, a schoolbook on Latin grammar by Aelius Donatus, may have been printed by Gutenberg. Every copy of printed books was identical, a significant departure from handwritten manuscripts, which left room for possible human error.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nGutenberg's invention of the movable-type printing press had a profound impact on society. It allowed for the mass production of books, making written knowledge more widely available and contributing to a significant increase in literacy rates. It also played a key role in the Renaissance and the Protestant Reformation.\n\nGutenberg's legacy extends beyond his invention. He is remembered as a pioneer in the field of printing and a key figure in the spread of knowledge. He has been the subject of numerous books, plays, and films, and his image has been used in various contexts, including as a symbol of innovation and progress.\n\n**Influence**\n\nGutenberg's invention of the movable-type printing press had a significant influence on society.

The latter publishes the Gutenberg-Jahrbuch, the leading periodical in the history of printing, and the book.\n\nGutenberg's legacy continues to be celebrated in various ways. His image and name have become synonymous with innovation and progress, and his invention of the movable-type printing press remains one of the most significant achievements in human history.\n\n**References**\n\nChinese paper was suitable only for calligraphy or block-printing; there were no screw-based presses in the east, because they were not wine-drinkers, didn't have olives, and used other means to dry their paper.\n\n**Sources**\n\n* _The Gutenberg Bible_ by John L.

mawr-ial) [7] Alternatively, the second part could be a saint's name [8]\n\n\nHistory\nKing Robert II of Scotland (1316–1390) had a hunting lodge in the area Historical records also indicate that a house at Balmoral was built by Sir William Drummond in 1390 [9] The estate was later tenanted by Alexander Gordon, second son of the 1st Earl of Huntly A tower house was built on the estate by the Gordons [2]\n\n\nRoyal acquisition\nQueen Victoria and Prince Albert first visited Scotland in 1842, five years after she acceded to the throne and two years after their marriage During this first visit they stayed at Edinburgh, and at Taymouth Castle in Perthshire, the home of John Campbell, 2nd Marquess of Breadalbane [2] They returned in 1844 to stay at Blair Castle, and in 1847, when they rented Ardverikie House by Loch Laggan [11] Frequent rain during the last trip led Sir James Clark, the queen's doctor, to recommend Deeside instead, for its healthier climate [12]\n\n\nConstruction of the new house\nSpace was needed for the growing family of Victoria and Albert, for additional staff, and for accommodation for visiting friends and official visitors such as cabinet members Thus extension of the existing structure would not provide enough space, and a larger house needed to be built In early 1852, this was commissioned from William Smith [19] The son of John Smith (who designed the 1830 alterations of the original castle), William Smith, was the city architect of Aberdeen from 1852 On learning of the commission, William Burn sought an interview with the prince, apparently to complain that Smith previously had plagiarised his work, however, Burn was unsuccessful in depriving Smith of the appointment [21] William Smith's designs were amended by Prince Albert, who took a close interest in details such as turrets and windows [22]\n\n\nVictoria and Albert at Balmoral\nEven before the completion of the new house, the pattern of the life of the royal couple in the Highlands was soon established Victoria took long walks of up to four hours daily and Albert spent many days hunting deer and game In 1849, diarist Charles Greville described their life at Balmoral as resembling that of gentry rather than royalty [30] Victoria began a policy of commissioning artists to record Balmoral, its surroundings, and its staff Over the years, numerous painters were employed at Balmoral, including Edwin and Charles Landseer, and Carl Haag [citation needed]\n\n\nAfter Victoria\nAfter Victoria's death, the royal family continued to use Balmoral during annual autumn visits George V had substantial improvements made during the 1910s and 1920s, including formal gardens to the south of the castle [2]\n\n\nDeath of Queen Elizabeth II\nQueen Elizabeth II had been at the castle since July 2022 for her annual summer holiday and had been receiving medical care there [35] In a break with tradition, Balmoral Castle, rather than Buckingham Palace, was the location of the appointment of British Prime Minister Liz Truss on 6 September 2022, due to concerns regarding the Queen's mobility issues [36] [37] [38] Elizabeth died at Balmoral at 15:10 BST on 8 September 2022 at the age of 96 She was the first monarch to die at Balmoral, and this was the first time a monarch had died in Scotland since James V died in 1542 at Falkland Palace [39] The Queen's coffin lay in repose in the ballroom of the castle for three days, to allow the Royal Family, estate staff and neighbours to pay their respects On 11 September, the coffin was transported to the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh for the start of the state funeral proceedings [40] [41]\n\n\nArchitecture\nThough called a castle, Balmoral's primary function is that of a country house [42] It is a \"typical and rather ordinary\" country house from the Victorian period The tower and \"pepper pot turrets\" are characteristic features of the residence's Scottish baronial style The seven-storey tower is an architectural feature borrowed from medieval defensive tower houses The \"pepper pot\" turrets were influenced by the style of 16th-century French châteaux Other features of the Scottish baronial style are the crow-stepped gables, dormer windows, and battlemented porte-cochère [43]\n\n\nOwnership\nBalmoral is private property and, unlike the monarch's official residences, is not the property of the Crown It was originally purchased privately by Prince Albert, for Queen Victoria, meaning that no revenues from the estate go to Parliament or the public purse, as would otherwise be the case for property owned outright by the monarch by the Civil List Act 1760 [44] Along with Sandringham House in Norfolk, ownership of Balmoral was inherited by Edward VIII on his accession in 1936 When he abdicated later the same year, however, he retained ownership of them A financial settlement was devised, under which Balmoral and Sandringham were purchased by Edward's brother and successor to the Crown, George VI [45]\n\n\nEstate\nBalmoral Estate is within the Cairngorms National Park and is partly within the Deeside and Lochnagar National Scenic Area [46] The

Castle is a private residence of the British royal family, located in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. The estate has been a favorite retreat for the royal family for over a century and a half, and has played host to numerous historical events and ceremonies. This article will explore the history, architecture, and significance of Balmoral Castle, as well as its current use and operation.\n\nEtymology\nThe name \"Balmoral\" is derived from the Scottish Gaelic \"Bouchmorale\", which was first recorded in 1451. The name is thought to be a combination of the Gaelic words \"both\" meaning \"a hut\" and \"morale\" meaning \"big spot\" or \"clearing\". However, the exact meaning and origin of the name are still debated among scholars.\n\nHistory\nBalmoral Castle has a long and storied history dating back to the 13th century. The first recorded owner of the estate was King Robert II of Scotland, who had a hunting lodge built in the area in the 14th century. The estate was later tenanted by Alexander Gordon, second son of the 1st Earl of Huntly, who built a tower house on the estate.\n\nRoyal Acquisition\nIn 1842, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert first visited Scotland, and it was during this trip that they began to take an interest in Balmoral Castle. They returned to Scotland in 1844 and stayed at Blair Castle, and in 1847 they rented Ardverikie House by Loch Laggan. However, it was not until 1852 that they purchased Balmoral Castle, which was then still in a somewhat dilapidated state.\n\nConstruction of the New House\nBalmoral Castle underwent extensive renovations and expansions in the mid-19th century, with the addition of a new wing and the construction of a seven-storey tower. The original castle was designed by William Smith, who was commissioned by Prince Albert to create a new and larger residence that would be suitable for the growing royal family. The new wing was added in the 1860s, and the castle was further expanded in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nVictoria and Albert at Balmoral\nQueen Victoria and Prince Albert spent many happy years at Balmoral Castle, and it was during this time that they developed a strong affection for the Scottish Highlands. They would often take long walks together, and Albert would spend many days hunting deer and game. Victoria would also commission artists to record Balmoral and its surroundings, and numerous painters were employed at the castle over the years.\n\nAfter Victoria\nAfter Queen Victoria's death in 1901, Balmoral Castle continued to be used by the royal family during their annual autumn visits. In the 1910s and 1920s, King George V had substantial improvements made to the castle, including the creation of formal gardens to the south of the castle.\n\nDeath of Queen Elizabeth II\nIn 2022, Queen Elizabeth II was at Balmoral Castle for her annual summer holiday, and it was at the castle that she passed away on September 8th, 2022, at the age of 96. The Queen's coffin lay in repose in the ballroom of the castle for three days, allowing the royal family, estate staff, and neighbors to pay their respects. On September 11th, the coffin was transported to the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh for the start of the state funeral proceedings.\n\nArchitecture\nBalmoral Castle is a country house in the Scottish baronial style, characterized by its seven-storey tower and \"pepper pot\" turrets. The castle is surrounded by beautiful gardens and grounds, which are open to the public during the summer months. The castle's architecture is influenced by the style of 16th-century French châteaux, and it features crow-stepped gables, dormer windows, and a battlemented porte-cochère.\n\nOwnership\nBalmoral Castle is private property, and it is not owned by the Crown. It was originally purchased privately by Prince Albert for Queen Victoria, and it has remained in the royal family ever since. The estate is managed by the Balmoral Estate Trust, which is responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of the castle and its grounds.\n\nEstate\nThe Balmoral Estate is a 50,000-acre estate that is located within the Cairngorms National Park and the Deeside and Lochnagar National Scenic Area. The estate features a wide variety of landscapes, from the Dee river valley to open mountains. There are seven Munros (hills in Scotland over 3,000ft) within the estate, including Lochnagar, which is the highest point in the estate at 3,789ft.\n\nPublic Access to Gardens and Castle Grounds\nThe gardens and castle grounds at Balmoral Castle are open to the public during the summer months. Visitors can walk through the beautiful gardens and explore the castle's grounds, which offer stunning views of the surrounding countryside. In 2024, it was announced that the public would be able to view the interior of the castle during a month-long summer tour program.\n\nCraigowan Lodge\nCraigowan Lodge is a seven-bedroom stone house that is located approximately 1 mile from the main castle. The lodge was often used by Prince Charles and Princess Diana when they visited Balmoral Castle. In 1981, Charles and Diana posed for a photo at the lodge before their wedding.\n\nIn Popular Culture\nBalmoral Castle has been featured in several films and television shows, including \"Mrs. Brown,\" \"The Queen,\" and \"The Crown.\" In the Netflix series \"The Crown,\" Ardverikie House was used as a stand-in for Balmoral Castle.

2024 Republican National Convention is a major event in the United States, scheduled to take place in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July 2024. The convention will be the culmination of the Republican Party's presidential nomination process, where delegates will gather to select the party's nominee for the 2024 presidential election.\n\n## Logistics\n\nThe selection of Milwaukee as the host city for the 2024 Republican National Convention was announced in January 2022, after a competitive bidding process between several cities, including Nashville, Pittsburgh, and Salt Lake City. Milwaukee, which hosted the 2020 Democratic National Convention, was chosen due to its central location and convention facilities. The city has a smaller number of hotel rooms than can be needed for a major party presidential nominating convention, which may lead to arrangements for delegates to stay in nearby cities, such as Madison, Wisconsin.\n\n## Host Committee\n\nThe MKE 2024 Host Committee is responsible for organizing the convention, working closely with the Republican National Committee. Reince Priebus serves as the chairman of the Host Committee, with Stephen B. King as the chief executive officer (CEO) until May 2023, when he was replaced by Milwaukee businessman Ted Kellner. The Host Committee's primary goal is to ensure the convention's success, with a focus on logistics, security, and hospitality.\n\n## Committee on Arrangements\n\nThe Committee on Arrangements is a key group within the Republican National Committee, responsible for coordinating the convention's program, logistics, and operations. Anne Hathaway was appointed chairwoman of the committee in March 2023, with Ron Kaufman as general chairman. Elise Dickens was named chief executive officer in June 2023, and further committee members were announced, including KC Crosbie as treasurer, Vicki Drummond as secretary, and David Bossie as co-chair.\n\n## Hotels and Other Accommodations\n\nDue to Milwaukee's limited number of hotel rooms, delegates and attendees may be accommodated in nearby cities, such as Madison, Wisconsin. The 2020 Democratic National Convention initially planned to house a large share of convention delegates in hotel rooms located in Illinois, but this plan was downscaled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, the 2024 Republican Convention does not anticipate such far-flung accommodations for delegates.\n\n## Security\n\nThe convention will be a National Special Security Event, requiring significant security measures to ensure the safety of attendees, delegates, and the general public. The Republican National Committee has allocated funds for security costs, with the Wisconsin members of the United States House of Representatives urging an increase in the allocated amount to $75 million for the 2024 election.\n\n## Schedule\n\nThe convention's schedule is expected to follow a traditional format, with motivational speakers and program events held over the course of four days. The theme for each day is focused on the Republican Party's key issues, including the economy and national security. The agenda for the convention includes:\n\n### Day One: Monday, July 15\n\n* Theme: Make America Wealthy Once Again\n* Afternoon business session\n* Evening session\n\n### Day Two: Tuesday, July 16\n\n* Theme: Make America Safe Once Again\n\n### Day Three: Wednesday, July 17\n\n* Theme: Make America Strong Once Again\n\n### Day Four: Thursday, July 18\n\n* Theme: Make America Great Once Again\n\n## Platform\n\nThe 2024 Republican National Convention is expected to adopt a platform that reflects the party's stance on key issues, including the economy, national security, and social policies. The platform is expected to be significantly shorter than the 2016 platform, with a focus on key initiatives and policies.\n\n## Nominating and Balloting\n\nThe convention's nominating and balloting process is expected to follow established rules, with delegates selecting the party's nominee for the 2024 presidential election. The rules for nominating and seconding speeches were changed in 2016 to require a candidate to have a majority in at least 7 states to have their names placed in nomination.\n\n## Trump's Nomination and Seconding Speeches\n\nFormer President Trump's name was placed into nomination by Jeff Kaufmann, chairman of the Iowa Republican Party.\n\n## Delegate Count\n\nThe table below reflects the presumed delegate count as per the end selection process and the final tally at the convention.\n\n| Candidate | Delegate Count |\n| --- | --- |\n| Donald Trump | 1,543 |\n| Other Candidates | 0 |\n\n## Results by State or Territory\n\nThe results of the convention's delegate count by state or territory are as follows:\n\n### Results by State or Territory\n\n| State or Territory | Delegate Count |\n| --- | --- |\n| Alabama | 50 |\n| Alaska | 14 |\n| Arizona | 58 |\n| Arkansas | 37 |\n| California | 173 |\n| Colorado | 40 |\n| Connecticut | 28 |\n| Delaware | 17 |\n| Florida | 245 |\n| Georgia | 105 |\n| Hawaii | 14 |\n| Idaho | 21 |\n| Illinois | 75 |\n| Indiana | 68 |\n| Iowa | 40 |\n| Kansas | 39 |\n| Kentucky | 57 |\n| Louisiana | 47 |\n| Maine | 23 |\n| Maryland | 38 |\n| Massachusetts | 42 |\n| Michigan | 86 |\n| Minnesota | 56 |\n| Mississippi | 40 |\n| Missouri | 51 |\n| Montana | 27 |\n| Nebraska | 36 |\n| Nevada | 33 |\n| New Hampshire | 22 |\n| New Jersey | 52 |\n| New Mexico | 23 |\n| New York | 99 |\n| North Carolina | 105 |\n| North Dakota | 28 |\n| Ohio | 104 |\n| Oklahoma | 43 |\n| Oregon | 28 |\n| Pennsylvania | 136 |\n| Rhode Island | 20 |\n| South Carolina | 50 |\n| South Dakota | 29 |\n| Tennessee | 58 |\n| Texas | 155 |\n| Utah | 40 |\n| Vermont | 16 |\n| Virginia | 49 |\n| Washington | 79 |\n| West Virginia | 34 |\n| Wisconsin | 56 |\n| Wyoming | 29 |\n\n## Vice Presidential Nomination\n\nOn July 15, the first day of the Republican National Convention, Trump announced JD Vance as his nominee for vice president.\n\n## Featured Speakers\n\nThe convention's featured speakers are expected to include:\n\n* Tim Scott\n* Nikki Haley\n* Mike Pompeo\n* Ted Cruz\n* Josh Hawley\n* Pam Bondi\n* Mike Lindell\n* Lara Trump\n\nThe 2024 Republican National Convention is expected to be a significant event in the United States, with a focus on the Republican Party's key issues and policies.

{"title": "Khalid_Sheikh_Mohammed", "content": "\nEarly life and education\nMohammed was born on 14 April 1965, [19] in Balochistan, West Pakistan or Kuwait [1] [20] [21] [22] His father, Shaikh Muhammad Ali Dustin al-Baluchi, [23] [24] was a Deobandi imam in Al Ahmadi, who moved with his family from Balochistan to Kuwait in the 1950s [25] [26] His mother was Halema Mohammed [24] Mohammed was raised in Badawiya, a neighborhood of the Fahaheel suburb of Kuwait City [26] Mohammed is the uncle of Ramzi Yousef, who was convicted on terrorism charges for his part in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, and Ammar Al Baluchi, who is accused of involvement in multiple terror plots.\n\n\nPhilippines 1994–1995\nMohammed was in the Philippines in late 1994 and early 1995; he then identified as a Saudi or a Qatari plywood exporter and used the aliases \"Abdul Majid\" and \"Salem Ali.\" [31] [32]\n\n\nQatar, avoiding arrest\nIn early 1996, Mohammed returned to Afghanistan to avoid capture by U.S authorities [33] In his flight from Qatar, he was sheltered by Sheikh Abdullah Al Thani, who was the Qatari Minister of Religious Affairs in 1996 [34] [35] [36] [37] [38]\n\n\nAlleged terrorist activities\nMohammed traveled to the Philippines in 1994 to work with his nephew Ramzi Yousef on the Bojinka plot, a Manila-based plot to destroy 12 commercial airliners flying routes between the United States, East Asia, and Southeast Asia The 9/11 Commission Report says that \"this marked the first time KSM took part in the actual planning of a terrorist operation.\" [39]\n\n\nOperation Bojinka\nMohammed traveled to the Philippines in 1994 to work with his nephew Ramzi Yousef on the Bojinka plot, a Manila-based plot to destroy 12 commercial airliners flying routes between the United States, East Asia, and Southeast Asia The 9/11 Commission Report says that \"this marked the first time KSM took part in the actual planning of a terrorist operation.\" [39]\n\n\nRelationship with Osama bin Laden\nBy the time the Bojinka plot was discovered, Mohammed had returned to Qatar and his job as a project engineer at the country's Ministry of Electricity and Water He traveled in 1995 to Sudan, Yemen, Malaysia, and Brazil to visit elements of the worldwide jihadist community, although no evidence connects him to specific terrorist actions in any of those locations On his trip to Sudan, he attempted to meet with Osama bin Laden, who was at the time living there, aided by Sudanese political leader Hassan al-Turabi After the U.S asked the Qatari government to arrest Mohammed in January 1996, he fled to Afghanistan, where he renewed his alliance with Abdul Rasul Sayyaf Later that year, he formed a working relationship with Bin Laden, who had settled there.\n\n\nPlan for 11 September 2001 attacks\nThe first hijack plan that Mohammed presented to the leadership of al-Qaeda called for several airplanes on both US east and west coasts to be hijacked and flown into targets His plan evolved from an earlier foiled plot known as the Bojinka plot (see above) Bin Laden rejected some potential targets suggested by Mohammed, such as the U.S Bank Tower in Los Angeles, [46] as he wished to simplify the attacks [47]\n\n\nDaniel Pearl murder\nAccording to a CNN interview with intelligence expert Rohan Gunaratna, \"Daniel Pearl was going in search of the al-Qaeda network that was operational in Karachi, and it was at the instruction of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed that Daniel Pearl was killed.\" [56] On 12 October 2006, Time magazine reported that \"KSM confessed under CIA interrogation that he personally committed the murder.\" [57] On 15 March 2007, the Pentagon stated that Mohammed had confessed to the murder [58] The statement quoted Mohammed as saying, \"I decapitated with my blessed right hand the head of the American Jew, Daniel Pearl, in the city of Karachi, Pakistan For those who would like to confirm, there are pictures of me on the Internet holding his head.\" [59] This confession was gained under torture, and Mohammed listed many other crimes at the same time [8] [7]\n\n\nCapture, interrogation, and torture\nOn 11 September 2002, members of Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) claimed to have killed or captured Sheikh Mohammed during a raid in Karachi that resulted in bin al-Shibh's capture This claim was then subsequently proven as baseless [62]\n\n\nReport that interrogators abused his children\nAli Khan, the father of Majid Khan, another one of the 14 \"high-value detainees,\" released an unsubstantiated affidavit on 16 April 2006, that reported that interrogators subjected Khalid Sheikh Mohammed's children, aged 6 and 8 years old, to abusive interrogation [95] [96] [97]\n\n\nTransfer to Guantanamo and hearing before his Combatant Status Review Tribunal\nOn 6 September 2006, American President George W Bush confirmed, for the first time, that the CIA had held \"high-value detainees\" for interrogation in secret prisons around the world [99] He also announced that fourteen senior captives, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, were being transferred from CIA custody, to military custody, at Guantanamo Bay detention camp and that these fourteen captives could now expect to face charges before Guantanamo military commissions [100]\n\n\nList of confessions\nMohammed has made at least 31 confessions: [110]\n\n\nConfession used in Sheikh Omar's defense\nOn 19 March 2007, Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh's lawyers cited Mohammed's confession in defense of their client [115] [116]\n\n\nProsecution in France\nIn 2009, the French government decided to try Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in absentia on terrorism charges with respect to the Ghriba synagogue bombing on the Tunisian island of Djerba in 2002, which killed 14 German tourists, five Tunisians and two French nationals They intended to charge him along with the captured German national Christian Ganczarski and Tunisian Walid Nawar [117] French judges later decided to separate Khalid Sheikh Mohammed's case from those of Ganczarski and Nawar and try him separately at a later date [118]\n\n\nTrial for role in 9/11 attacks\nOn 11 February 2008, the United States Department of Defense charged Mohammed, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, Mustafa Ahmad al-Hawsawi, Ali Abd al-Aziz Ali and Walid Bin Attash for the 11 September 2001 attacks under the military commission system, as established under the Military Commissions Act of 2006 They have reportedly been charged with the murder of almost 3,000 people, terrorism and providing material support for terrorism and plane hijacking; as well as attacking civilian objects, intentionally causing serious bodily injury and destruction of property in violation of the law of war The charges against them list 169 overt acts allegedly committed by the defendants in furtherance of the 11 September events [119]\n\n\nLegal rulings affecting him\nIn Boumediene v Bush (2008), the United States Supreme Court ruled that detainees had the right of access to US federal courts to petition under habeas corpus to challenge their detentions, and that the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 and the Military Commissions Act of 2006 were flawed A revised Military Commissions Act was passed by Congress in 2009 to address court concerns.\n\n\nRelease of new images\nOn 9 September 2009, photographs of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Ammar al Baluchi were published on the Internet and widely in US and international media [131] [132] [133] Camp authorities have strict controls over the

Kuwait City [26] Mohammed is the uncle of Ramzi Yousef, who was convicted on terrorism charges for his part in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, and Ammar Al Baluchi, who is accused of involvement in multiple terror plots.\n\n\nPhilippines 1994–1995\nMohammed was in the Philippines in late 1994 and early 1995; he then identified as a Saudi or a Qatari plywood exporter and used the aliases \"Abdul Majid\" and \"Salem Ali.\" [31] [32]\n\n\nQatar, avoiding arrest\nIn early 1996, Mohammed returned to Afghanistan to avoid capture by U.S authorities [33] In his flight from Qatar, he was sheltered by Sheikh Abdullah Al Thani, who was the Qatari Minister of Religious Affairs in 1996 [34] [35] [36] [37] [38]\n\n\nAlleged terrorist activities\nMohammed traveled to the Philippines in 1994 to work with his nephew Ramzi Yousef on the Bojinka plot, a Manila-based plot to destroy 12 commercial airliners flying routes between the United States, East Asia, and Southeast Asia The 9/11 Commission Report says that \"this marked the first time KSM took part in the actual planning of a terrorist operation.\" [39]\n\n\nOperation Bojinka\nMohammed traveled to the Philippines in 1994 to work with his nephew Ramzi Yousef on the Bojinka plot, a Manila-based plot to destroy 12 commercial airliners flying routes between the United States, East Asia, and Southeast Asia The 9/11 Commission Report says that \"this marked the first time KSM took part in the actual planning of a terrorist operation.\" [39]\n\n\nRelationship with Osama bin Laden\nBy the time the Bojinka plot was discovered, Mohammed had returned to Qatar and his job as a project engineer at the country's Ministry of Electricity and Water He traveled in 1995 to Sudan, Yemen, Malaysia, and Brazil to visit elements of the worldwide jihadist community, although no evidence connects him to specific terrorist actions in any of those locations On his trip to Sudan, he attempted to meet with Osama bin Laden, who was at the time living there, aided by Sudanese political leader Hassan al-Turabi After the U.S asked the Qatari government to arrest Mohammed in January 1996, he fled to Afghanistan, where he renewed his alliance with Abdul Rasul Sayyaf Later that year, he formed a working relationship with Bin Laden, who had settled there.\n\n\nPlan for 11 September 2001 attacks\nThe first hijack plan that Mohammed presented to the leadership of al-Qaeda called for several airplanes on both US east and west coasts to be hijacked and flown into targets His plan evolved from an earlier foiled plot known as the Bojinka plot (see above) Bin Laden rejected some potential targets suggested by Mohammed, such as the U.S Bank Tower in Los Angeles, [46] as he wished to simplify the attacks [47]\n\n\nDaniel Pearl murder\nAccording to a CNN interview with intelligence expert Rohan Gunaratna, \"Daniel Pearl was going in search of the al-Qaeda network that was operational in Karachi, and it was at the instruction of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed that Daniel Pearl was killed.\" [56] On 12 October 2006, Time magazine reported that \"KSM confessed under CIA interrogation that he personally committed the murder.\" [57] On 15 March 2007, the Pentagon stated that Mohammed had confessed to the murder [58] The statement quoted Mohammed as saying, \"I decapitated with my blessed right hand the head of the American Jew, Daniel Pearl, in the city of Karachi, Pakistan For those who would like to confirm, there are pictures of me on the Internet holding his head.\" [59] This confession was gained under torture, and Mohammed listed many other crimes at the same time [8] [7]\n\n\nCapture, interrogation, and torture\nOn 11 September 2002, members of Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) claimed to have killed or captured Sheikh Mohammed during a raid in Karachi that resulted in bin al-Shibh's capture This claim was then subsequently proven as baseless [62]\n\n\nReport that interrogators abused his children\nAli Khan, the father of Majid Khan, another one of the 14 \"high-value detainees,\" released an unsubstantiated affidavit on 16 April 2006, that reported that interrogators subjected Khalid Sheikh Mohammed's children, aged 6 and 8 years old, to abusive interrogation [95] [96] [97]\n\n\nTransfer to Guantanamo and hearing before his Combatant Status Review Tribunal\nOn 6 September 2006, American President George W Bush confirmed, for the first time, that the CIA had held \"high-value detainees\" for interrogation in secret prisons around the world [99] He also announced that fourteen senior captives, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, were being transferred from CIA custody, to military custody, at Guantanamo Bay detention camp and that these fourteen captives could now expect to face charges before Guantanamo military commissions [100]\n\n\nList of confessions\nMohammed has made at least 31 confessions: [110]\n\n\nConfession used in Sheikh Omar's defense\nOn 19 March 2007, Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh's lawyers cited Mohammed's confession in defense of their client [115] [116]\n\n\nProsecution in France\nIn 2009, the French government decided to try Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in absentia on terrorism charges with respect to the Ghriba synagogue bombing on the Tunisian island of Djerba in 2002, which killed 14 German tourists, five Tunisians and two French nationals They intended to charge him along with the captured German national Christian Ganczarski and Tunisian Walid Nawar [117] French judges later decided to separate Khalid Sheikh Mohammed's case from those of Ganczarski and Nawar and try him separately at a later date [118]\n\n\nTrial for role in 9/11 attacks\nOn 11 February 2008, the United States Department of Defense charged Mohammed, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, Mustafa Ahmad al-Hawsawi, Ali Abd al-Aziz Ali and Walid Bin Attash for the 11 September 2001 attacks under the military commission system, as established under the Military Commissions Act of 2006 They have reportedly been charged with the murder of almost 3,000 people, terrorism and providing material support for terrorism and plane hijacking; as well as attacking civilian objects, intentionally causing serious bodily injury and destruction of property in violation of the law of war The charges against them list 169 overt acts allegedly committed by the defendants in furtherance of the 11 September events [119]\n\n\nLegal rulings affecting him\nIn Boumediene v Bush (2008), the United States Supreme Court ruled that detainees had the right of access to US federal courts to petition under habeas corpus to challenge their detentions, and that the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 and the Military Commissions Act of 2006 were flawed A revised Military Commissions Act was passed by Congress in 2009 to address court concerns.\n\n\nRelease of new images\nOn 9 September 2009, photographs of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Ammar al Baluchi were published on the Internet and widely in US and international media [131] [132] [133] Camp authorities have strict controls over the taking and distribution of images of the Guantanamo captives Journalists and VIPs visiting

He is best known for his humorous and poignant accounts of his experiences as a junior doctor, which have been published in his bestselling book, \"This Is Going to Hurt\".\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nAdam Kay was born in Brighton, England, to Stewart and Naomi Kay, and grew up in a Jewish household with three siblings. His father, a doctor, instilled in him a sense of duty and compassion that would shape Kay's future career choices. The Kay family was originally from Poland, with the family name being Strykowski. Kay's upbringing and family background played a significant role in shaping his values and worldview.\n\nKay's decision to become a doctor was influenced by his father's profession, and he initially trained in obstetrics and gynaecology. However, his experiences as a junior doctor would eventually lead him to leave the profession and pursue a career in writing.\n\n**Career**\n\nAfter completing his medical training, Kay worked as a doctor between 2004 and 2010. During this time, he gained a deep understanding of the medical profession and the complexities of human relationships. However, his experiences were often fraught with challenges, including long hours, high pressure, and the emotional toll of dealing with critically ill patients.\n\nKay's experiences as a doctor would later inform his writing and comedy, as he sought to make sense of the highs and lows of his career. His decision to leave the medical profession was influenced by a particularly traumatic event, in which a patient's caesarean section was complicated by an undiagnosed placenta praevia. The expectant mother was subsequently taken to the intensive care unit, while the baby was delivered stillborn. The incident left Kay with symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which would take him years to recover from.\n\n**Music**\n\nIn addition to his work as a doctor and writer, Kay is also a talented musician. In 2005, he founded the Amateur Transplants, a comedy music group that gained significant popularity on the internet in the UK. The group's song \"London Underground\", set to the tune of \"Going Underground\" by the Jam, became a viral hit and cemented Kay's reputation as a talented comedic musician.\n\n**Writing**\n\nKay's first book, \"This Is Going to Hurt\", was published by Picador in September 2017. The book is a collection of diary entries and stories from his time as a junior doctor, and it offers a humorous and poignant account of the challenges and triumphs of working in the medical profession. The book became a Sunday Times bestseller, and it has sold over 2.5 million copies worldwide.\n\nKay's writing style is characterized by his wit, humor, and sensitivity. He has a unique ability to balance the dark and the light, making his writing both entertaining and thought-provoking. His book has been widely praised by critics and readers alike, and it has won several awards, including the UK's National Book Award for Book of the Year in 2018.\n\n**Performing**\n\nIn addition to his writing, Kay is also a talented performer. He has sold out shows for six years at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, and he has also had sell-out nationwide UK tours. His 2018 tour of \"This Is Going to Hurt\" sold out a season at the Edinburgh International Conference Centre, the largest venue of the Edinburgh Fringe, and a week at the Garrick Theatre, before culminating in two shows at the Hammersmith Apollo.\n\nKay regularly performs at cultural events, including the Latitude Festival and the Cheltenham Literature Festival. He has won several awards for his performances, including the Best Musical Variety Act at the 2014 London Cabaret Awards. He has also been named by the Evening Standard as one of London's most influential people.\n\n**Books**\n\nKay is gay, and he has been an outspoken advocate for LGBTQ+ rights. He was voted in Pink News' top 50 most influential LGBT Twitter users, and he has used his platform to raise awareness and funds for various LGBTQ+ charities.\n\nIn 2018, Kay married James Farrell, and together they have two children through surrogacy, which they announced in June 2023. Kay and his family live in Oxfordshire, England.\n\n**Personal life**\n\nKay is a private person, but he has been open about his struggles with mental health and his experiences as a gay man. He has used his platform to raise awareness and funds for various charities, including those that support LGBTQ+ individuals and mental health services.\n\nKay's love of writing and performance has taken him on a journey of self-discovery and growth. He continues to write, perform, and advocate for causes that he is passionate about, and his unique voice and perspective have made him a beloved figure in the world of comedy and literature.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Adam_Kay_(writer)\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nAdam Kay was born in Brighton, England, to Stewart and Naomi Kay, and grew up in a Jewish household with three siblings [4] His father being a doctor, Kay describes becoming a doctor as being a default decision [5] The Kay family was from Poland, the original family name being Strykowski [5]\n\n\nCareer\nKay initially trained in obstetrics and gynaecology before turning to writing.\n\n\nMedicine\nKay worked as a doctor between 2004 and 2010, leaving the profession after a patient's caesarean section was complicated by an undiagnosed placenta praevia; [1] the expectant mother was subsequently taken to the intensive care unit, while the baby was delivered stillborn, which left him with symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder [5]\n\n\nMusic\nKay founded the Amateur Transplants Their song \"London Underground\", which was set to the tune of \"Going Underground\" by the Jam, gained significant popularity on the internet in the UK in 2005 [8] [9]\n\n\nWriting\nKay's first book, This Is Going to Hurt, based on diaries from his former career as a doctor, was published by Picador in September 2017 [10] and became a Sunday Times bestseller [11] The paperback edition was also a Sunday Times number one bestseller, [12] a position it held for over a year [13] and selling more than 2.5 million copies [14] It was chosen as Book of the Year in the UK's 2018 National Book Awards [15] The book was well received by critics, including in the literary pages of The Times, [16] Financial Times, [17] Guardian, [18] and The Scotsman [19]\n\n\nPerforming\nKay has sold out shows for six years at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe [41] and has also had sell-out nationwide UK tours [42] His 2018 tour of This Is Going to Hurt sold out a season at the Edinburgh International Conference Centre (EICC), the largest venue of the Edinburgh Fringe, [43] and a week at the Garrick Theatre, before culminating in two shows at the Hammersmith Apollo [44] He performs regularly at cultural events including the Latitude Festival, [45] and the Cheltenham Literature Festival [46] Kay won Best Musical Variety Act at the 2014 London Cabaret Awards [47] and has been named by the Evening Standard as one of London's most influential people [48]\n\n\nBooks\nKay is gay, [58] and was voted in Pink News' top 50 most influential LGBT Twitter users [59] Kay married James Farrell in 2018, and together they have two children through surrogacy which he announced in June 2023 [60] [61] Kay and his family live in Oxfordshire, England [62]\n\n\nPersonal life\nKay is gay, [58] and was voted in Pink News' top 50 most influential LGBT Twitter users [59] Kay married James Farrell in 2018, and together they have two children through surrogacy which he announced in June 2023 [60] [61] Kay and his family live in Oxfordshire, England [62]\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is the younger half-brother of the late Dodi Fayed, a well-known Egyptian film producer who tragically died in a car crash in Paris in August 1997.\n\nEarly Life\n-----------\n\nOmar Fayed was born in London, England, to Finnish model Heini Wathén and Egyptian businessman Mohamed Al-Fayed. His half-brother, Dodi Fayed, was also born to the same parents, but from a different mother. Dodi's mother was Egyptian socialite Safia Gallani. Growing up, Omar was exposed to the world of business and entrepreneurship, thanks to his father's vast business empire.\n\nOmar's early life was marked by a privileged upbringing, with access to the best education and opportunities. His father's business success and wealth provided him with a comfortable life, allowing him to pursue his interests and passions without financial constraints. However, this privileged upbringing also had its challenges, particularly when it came to maintaining a sense of normalcy and humility.\n\nCareer\n-------\n\nOmar Fayed entered the world of business at a relatively young age, starting as a teenager trading commodities. He quickly demonstrated his business acumen and entrepreneurial spirit, which caught the attention of his father. In 2006, at the age of 19, Omar was appointed to the Harrods board and became involved in several subsidiary companies owned by his father. These companies included Fulham F.C, a professional football club, and the Ritz Hotel in Paris, a luxury hotel chain.\n\nAs a member of the Harrods board, Omar was expected to take over as chairman of the company. However, in 2009, he decided to resign from his position to pursue his studies for an MBA. During this time, Omar expressed a desire to focus on environmental entrepreneurship, commenting in an interview that consumerist culture \"wasn’t doing anything positive for the future of humanity.\" This marked a significant shift in Omar's career goals, as he began to explore more sustainable and socially responsible business ventures.\n\nFamily Feud\n------------\n\nIn 2023, Omar Fayed's father, Mohamed Al-Fayed, passed away, leaving behind a vast fortune estimated to be worth £1.7 billion ($2 billion). Omar was fifth in line of succession to inherit his father's estate, after his mother, Heini Wathén, and two elder sisters and one older brother. However, at the time of his father's death, Omar was engulfed in a high-profile power struggle against his mother and siblings, in an attempt to take control of his deceased father's estate.\n\nThe power struggle was marked by a series of public disputes and accusations, with Omar accusing his family members of trying to manipulate him and exclude him from the inheritance process. The situation was further complicated by the fact that Omar's mother and siblings had already begun to divide up their father's assets among themselves, leaving Omar feeling excluded and marginalized.\n\nThe power struggle between Omar and his family members has been a subject of much media attention, with many questioning Omar's motives and actions. While some have sympathy for Omar's plight, others have criticized him for his perceived selfishness and lack of humility. As the situation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how Omar will ultimately navigate the complex web of family dynamics and emerge victorious.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nOmar Fayed's life has been marked by a complex mix of privilege and adversity. From his early days as a commodities trader to his current role as a business entrepreneur, Omar has demonstrated a keen sense of business acumen and a passion for innovation. However, his recent involvement in a high-profile family feud has raised questions about his character and motivations.\n\nAs Omar continues to navigate the challenges of his family's inheritance and his own career goals, it remains to be seen how he will emerge from this difficult situation. Will he be able to overcome the obstacles and achieve success, or will he succumb to the pressures and conflicts that surround him?

780,000 years ago, [6] to the beginning of the Mesolithic, approximately 10,000 years ago [5] The Palaeolithic archaeological period falls within the Pleistocene geological epoch, which has a complex

Britain, from at least 780,000 years ago, [6] to the beginning of the Mesolithic, approximately 10,000 years ago [5] The Palaeolithic archaeological period falls within the Pleistocene geological epoch, which has a complex history of changing climatic conditions and fluctuating sea levels over an extensive period [5]\n\n\nChronology and overview\nThe Iron Age in Britain is usually dated from c 800 BCE until the Roman invasion, c 43 CE [282] [283] This period marked a significant transition from bronze to iron for tool and weapon production, [284] and coincided with widespread climatic deterioration across Europe that resulted in colder and wetter conditions throughout much of the Iron Age [204]\n\n\nMesolithic (c. 9660–4000 BCE)\nThe Mesolithic, which follows the Upper Palaeolithic and ends with the introduction of farming, had a warmer climate that resulted in rising sea and river levels and the expansion of woodland, as well as significant changes in stone tool technology [21] [22] In contrast with the preceding Palaeolithic period, there is credible evidence for a permanent human presence in Cornwall during the Mesolithic [23] Semi-nomadic hunter gatherers, who crafted tools from stone and probably other organic materials, sustained themselves through seasonal hunting, fishing and gathering [24] There is an apparent preference for coastal areas, [25] which were exploited for their plentiful food resources [26]\n\n\nChronology and overview\nThe Iron Age in Britain is usually dated from c 800 BCE until the Roman invasion, c 43 CE [282] [283] This period marked a significant transition from bronze to iron for tool and weapon production, [284] and coincided with widespread climatic deterioration across Europe that resulted in colder and wetter conditions throughout much of the Iron Age [204]\n\n\nEnvironment\nDuring the transition to the Iron Age, between c 800 and 750 BCE, an abrupt climatic shift known as the 2.7 (or 2.8) Ka event occurred across Europe, resulting in colder and wetter conditions in Britain that lasted between c 200 and 400 years This period was followed by a return to drier conditions that lasted until c 400 BCE when another shift towards wetter conditions occurred [204] However there is only limited evidence for climatic deterioration on Bodmin Moor around the onset of the Iron Age [297] Between 550–380 BCE, some sites on Bodmin Moor experienced increasingly wetter conditions, which may be attributable to either climate deterioration or deforestation [298] Pollen analysis suggests major woodland clearance on Roughtor c 760–390 BCE, [299] and at Higher Moors, Scilly, c 820–410 BCE [300] In the Late Iron Age there was an increase in heather cover on Bodmin Moor, which could be attributed to factors such as acidification of the soil, reduced grazing activity, or deliberate burning [297]\n\n\nMaterial culture\nIron Age settlements in Cornwall include enclosed settlements such as rounds, cliff castles, and hillforts, as well as large numbers of unenclosed settlements of single or multiple roundhouses [288] [301] [302] There is some overlap in the definitions of the various enclosed settlement types [303] In some cases open settlements were later fully or partially enclosed, and earlier enclosed settlements were occasionally expanded with additional fortifications [304] At the beginning of the Iron Age, settlements shift from higher ground on moors to lowlands, perhaps as a result of deteriorating climatic conditions and overgrazing [305] [306] There is an apparent decline in the number of open settlements in the Later Iron Age, with a corresponding increase in the number of enclosed settlements [307] Iron Age settlements in Cornwall were often built within extensive field systems [308]\n\n\nSites\nFindspots and sites are particularly concentrated in coastal areas, which attracted Mesolithic people due to the abundant marine food resources There is an apparent preference for occupation of the north coast, which may be the result of the differential effects of erosion making these sites more archaeologically visible Large lithic assemblages have also been found at some lowland sites on the south coast [35] [36] [37] [26] Temporary camps and sites are also found along rivers, on moorland, and around the moorland-lowland ecotone [35] [38] During the later Mesolithic period sites were located on terraces or low ridges, possibly to provide protection from humans or animals [39] Late Mesolithic sites are typically larger than earlier Mesolithic sites, suggesting that they were occupied by larger populations One explanation for this trend may be the rising sea levels, which reduced the available land area, and may have led to a concentration of resources [29]\n\n\nTools\nThe Mesolithic is characterized by significant changes in stone tool technology [55] Tools were manufactured by the prepared-core technique, breaking flint or chert beach pebbles with hammerstones to produce bladelets [56] A wide variety of tools were made and used at Cornish Mesolithic sites, including hammerstones, stone anvils, scrapers, choppers, bevelled pebble tools, arrow tip microliths, awls, burins, axes, pickaxes, and backed blades [57] [3] [58] [59]\n\n\nRitual\nThe deceased were typically interred in oval or rectangular graves, either individually or more commonly as part of small cemeteries [287] [365] [366] Distinctive burial traditions ('South Western Cist Burials') are found in Cornwall and Scilly [365] from the Middle Iron Age This tradition involves placing the dead in a flexed or crouched position, with the head towards the north [365] [366] While grave goods are uncommon, decorated metal items sometimes accompany burials [365] [366] Examples include the cist burial at Bryher, Scilly, where grave goods included a sword, shield, and a decorated mirror [287] In another example, at the Late Iron Age cemetery at Trethellan (c 200 BCE – 100 CE), the dead were interred wearing clothing and jewellery, including bronze brooches [287]\n\n\nSubsistence\nThe Iron Age economy was predominantly pastoral, based on cattle and especially sheep, with wool production as a significant sector [162] Additionally, evidence is found for arable farming, including the cultivation of barley, oats, rye, emmer, and spelt, [289] supported by the finds of quern stones for grain grinding [364] Some sites feature extensive field systems indicating mixed farming incorporating both crop cultivation and pastoralism [364]\n\n\nTrade and cultural links\nIn Britain the inhabitants of the promontory called Belerion are particularly friendly to strangers and have become civilized through contacts with merchants from foreign parts ...They prepare the tin, working the ground in which it is produced very carefully ...They beat the metal into masses shaped like astragali and carry it to a certain island lying off Britain called Ictis.\n\nGenetics\nBy the Iron Age, Early European Farmer ancestry in Southern Britain had increased to c 36%–38.8% as populations with comparatively higher levels of this component migrated from Europe during the Middle to Late Bronze Age [188]\n\n\nNeolithic (c. 4000–2400 BCE)\nThe Neolithic revolution was a major turning point in human prehistory, when societies transitioned from hunter-gatherer societies to settled farming communities Originating in the Middle East, the Neolithic cultural package, which included domesticated plants and animals, pottery, and other technologies, spread to the Aegean and Eastern Marmara regions and then to Europe via the Mediterranean Sea and the Danube river [86] [87] [88] The Neolithic reached Britain c 4000 BCE, probably spreading from the Thames Estuary to the South West Peninsula within around 100 years [87] [89] [90] Ancient DNA studies suggest that agriculture was introduced to Britain by migrating Early European Farmer groups bringing their Neolithic lifestyle from the European mainland, and argue against the competing hypothesis that indigenous British hunter-gatherers became farmers [91] [87] [92] [93]\n\n\nChronology\nThe Neolithic revolution was a major

construction in the later Neolithic, there is a resurgence in the Early Bronze Age, and numerous barrows, cairns and megalithic structures were constructed in the first half of the second millennium BCE [221] [222] Monuments were often placed near, in sight of, aligned with, or on top of significant natural features such as hills, rivers, and particularly rocky outcrops [72] [221] [223]\n\n\nPottery\nThe earliest Iron Age pottery in Cornwall (c 800–600 BCE), including shouldered jars and carinated jars and bowls, is found at Trevelgue Head [349] This is followed by Plain Jar Group that dates to the Early Iron Age, c 6th to 4th century BCE [350] The Plain Jar pottery shows a shift towards a more extensive use of granitic fabrics compared with the preceding period, although gabbroic clay continued to be the primary fabric for pottery production as in the Final Bronze Age period [350] Around 300 BCE, in the Middle Iron Age, South West Decorated Ware, also known as Glastonbury Ware, emerged as a regional pottery style from Cornwall to the Mendips This style made less use of granitic fabrics, and by the late Iron Age pottery in Cornwall is almost entirely made from gabbroic clay [351] [352]\n\n\nStone and organic tools\nDuring the later Iron Age, rotary querns were introduced alongside the continued use of saddle querns for grain processing [363] Evidence of textile production includes loom weights and spindle whorls which are found at sites such as Castle Gotha [364]\n\n\nRitual\nThe deceased were typically interred in oval or rectangular graves,

[364]\n\n\nSocial organization\nAt least in the Early to Middle Iron Age, hillforts and cliff castles have been interpreted as the dwellings of a dominant cattle-owning elite class who controlled long-distance trade routes and access to land including rights to sheep grazing It has been suggested that they engaged in patron-client relationships with the lower strata of society, who occupied the smaller enclosed settlements [290] [319] [162]\n\n\nTrade and cultural links\nIn Britain the inhabitants of the promontory called Belerion are particularly friendly to strangers and have become civilized through contacts with merchants from foreign parts ...They prepare the tin, working the ground in which it is produced very carefully ...They beat the metal into masses shaped like astragali and carry it to a certain island lying off Britain called Ictis.\n\nEthnicity and genetics\nThere is no evidence that the current boundaries of Cornwall held any significance for the Bronze Age inhabitants of this region, [279] and the Bronze Age inhabitants of present-day Cornwall likely had complex identities that were linked to family, obligation, and regional geography [279] [189] [280]\n\n\nBronze Age (c. 2400–800 BCE)\nThe Bronze Age in Britain is dated to the arrival of the Bell Beaker culture, which is initially a Copper Age, followed by the adoption of tin and copper alloying techniques to manufacture bronze tools and weapons a few hundred years later [182] Bell Beaker culture was probably introduced to Cornwall via Southern Britain, rather than directly from the European mainland [183] [184] [185] Ancient DNA studies have revealed significant human migrations into Britain during the Beaker to Early Bronze Age period, with groups carrying high levels of Yamnaya-related ancestry arriving from the European mainland [186] [187] Ancient DNA studies also show that a second migration of groups from Europe, who carried Yamnaya-related ancestry with comparatively high levels of Early European Farmer ancestry, occurred c 1300–800 BCE [188]\n\n\nChronology and overview\nThe Iron Age in Britain is usually dated from c 800 BCE until the Roman

Early Iron Age iron production Evidence for industrial-scale iron working is found at Trevelgue, and to a lesser extent at the Early Iron Age site at Chûn and the Late Iron Age site at Chysauster [358] [335] [337] [359] Iron artefacts are rarely preserved due to Cornwall's acidic soils, with the few examples dating to the Late Iron Age [328]\n\n\nStone and organic tools\nDuring the later Iron

that has been inhabited for thousands of years. The prehistoric period in Cornwall spans from the earliest human presence in the region, which dates back to at least 780,000 years ago, to the beginning of the Mesolithic period, approximately 10,000 years ago. This article will provide an overview of the prehistory of Cornwall, covering the Palaeolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic, Bronze Age, and Iron Age periods.\n\n**Palaeolithic (c. 700,000–10,000 BCE)**\n\nThe Palaeolithic in Britain spans the period from the earliest archaic human presence in Britain, from at least 780,000 years ago, to the beginning of the Mesolithic, approximately 10,000 years ago. This period falls within the Pleistocene geological epoch, which has a complex history of changing climatic conditions and fluctuating sea levels over an extensive period. During the Palaeolithic, human populations in Britain were likely small and nomadic, living off the land and using basic stone tools.\n\n**Mesolithic (c. 10,000–4,000 BCE)**\n\nThe Mesolithic period in Britain begins around 10,000 years ago and lasts until the introduction of farming, approximately 4,000 BCE. This period is characterized by a warmer climate, rising sea and river levels, and significant changes in stone tool technology. In contrast to the preceding Palaeolithic period, there is credible evidence for a permanent human presence in Cornwall during the Mesolithic. Semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers, who crafted tools from stone and probably other organic materials, sustained themselves through seasonal hunting, fishing, and gathering.\n\n**Chronology and Overview**\n\nThe Neolithic revolution was a major turning point in human prehistory, when societies transitioned from hunter-gatherer societies to settled farming communities. The Neolithic cultural package, which included domesticated plants and animals, pottery, and other technologies, spread to the Aegean and Eastern Marmara regions and then to Europe via the Mediterranean Sea and the Danube river. The Neolithic reached Britain around 4,000 BCE, probably spreading from the Thames Estuary to the South West Peninsula within around 100 years.\n\n**Environment**\n\nDuring the transition to the Iron Age, between c. 800 and 750 BCE, an abrupt climatic shift known as the 2.7 (or 2.8) Ka event occurred across Europe, resulting in colder and wetter conditions in Britain that lasted between c. 200 and 400 years. This period was followed by a return to drier conditions that lasted until c. 400 BCE when another shift towards wetter conditions occurred.\n\n**Material Culture**\n\nIron Age settlements in Cornwall include enclosed settlements such as rounds, cliff castles, and hillforts, as well as large numbers of unenclosed settlements of single or multiple roundhouses. There is some overlap in the definitions of the various enclosed settlement types. In some cases, open settlements were later fully or partially enclosed, and earlier enclosed settlements were occasionally expanded with additional fortifications. At the beginning of the Iron Age, settlements shifted from higher ground on moors to lowlands, perhaps as a result of deteriorating climatic conditions and overgrazing.\n\n**Settlements**\n\nIron Age settlements in Cornwall include enclosed settlements such as rounds, cliff castles, and hillforts, as well as large numbers of unenclosed settlements of single or multiple roundhouses.

At the beginning of the Iron Age, settlements shifted from higher ground on moors to lowlands, perhaps as a result of deteriorating climatic conditions and overgrazing.\n\n**Pottery**\n\nThe earliest Iron Age pottery in Cornwall, dating to around 800-600 BCE, includes shouldered jars and carinated jars and bowls. This is followed by Plain Jar Group pottery, which dates to the Early Iron Age, c. 6th to 4th century BCE. The Plain Jar pottery shows a shift towards a more extensive use of granitic fabrics compared with the preceding period, although gabbroic clay continued to be the primary fabric for pottery production as in the Final Bronze Age period.\n\n**Metal**\n\nHaematite (iron ore) is found in Cornwall near St Austell, Launceston, and especially the Great Perran Lode near Trevelgue Head, which was a major source for Early Iron Age iron production. Evidence for industrial-scale iron working is found at Trevelgue, and to a lesser extent at the Early Iron Age site at Chûn and the Late Iron Age site at Chysauster.\n\n**Stone and Organic Tools**\n\nDuring the later Iron Age, rotary querns were introduced alongside the continued use of saddle querns for grain processing. Evidence of textile production includes loom weights and spindle whorls, which are found at sites such as Castle Gotha.\n\n**Ritual**\n\nThe deceased were typically interred in oval or rectangular graves, either individually or more commonly as part of small cemeteries.

period, there is credible evidence for a permanent human presence in Cornwall during the Mesolithic [23] Semi-nomadic hunter gatherers, who crafted tools from stone and probably other organic materials, sustained themselves through seasonal hunting, fishing and gathering [24] There is an apparent preference for coastal areas, [25] which were exploited for their plentiful food resources

wetter conditions in Britain that lasted between c 200 and 400 years This period was followed by a return to drier conditions that lasted until c 400 BCE when another shift towards wetter conditions occurred [204] However there is only limited evidence for climatic deterioration on Bodmin Moor around the onset of the Iron Age [297] Between 550–380 BCE, some sites on Bodmin Moor experienced increasingly wetter conditions, which may be attributable to either climate deterioration or deforestation [298] Pollen analysis suggests major woodland clearance on Roughtor c 760–390 BCE, [299] and at Higher Moors, Scilly, c 820–410 BCE [300] In the Late Iron Age there was an increase in heather cover on Bodmin Moor, which could be attributed to factors such as acidification of the soil, reduced grazing activity, or deliberate burning [297]\n\n\nMaterial culture\nIron Age settlements in Cornwall include enclosed settlements such as rounds, cliff castles, and hillforts, as well as large numbers of unenclosed settlements of single or multiple roundhouses [288] [301] [302] There is some overlap in the definitions of the various enclosed settlement types [303] In some cases open settlements were later fully or partially enclosed, and earlier enclosed settlements were occasionally expanded with additional fortifications [304] At the beginning of the Iron Age, settlements shift from higher ground on moors to lowlands, perhaps as a result of deteriorating climatic conditions and overgrazing [305] [306] There is an apparent decline in the number of open settlements in the Later Iron Age, with a corresponding increase in the number of enclosed settlements [307] Iron Age settlements in Cornwall were often built within extensive field systems [308]\n\n\nSites\nFindspots and sites are particularly concentrated in coastal areas, which attracted Mesolithic people due to the abundant marine food resources There is an apparent preference for occupation of the north coast, which may be the result of the differential effects of erosion making these sites more archaeologically visible Large lithic assemblages have also been found at some lowland sites on the south coast [35] [36] [37] [26] Temporary camps and sites are also found along rivers, on moorland, and around the moorland-lowland ecotone [35] [38] During the later Mesolithic period sites were located on terraces or low ridges, possibly to provide protection from humans or animals [39] Late Mesolithic sites are typically larger than earlier Mesolithic sites, suggesting that they were occupied by larger populations One explanation for this trend may be the rising sea levels, which reduced the available land area, and may have led to a concentration of resources [29]\n\n\nTools\nThe Mesolithic is characterized by significant changes in stone tool technology [55] Tools were manufactured by the prepared-core technique, breaking flint or chert beach pebbles with hammerstones to produce bladelets [56] A wide variety of tools were made and used at Cornish Mesolithic sites, including hammerstones, stone anvils, scrapers, choppers, bevelled pebble tools, arrow tip microliths, awls, burins, axes, pickaxes, and backed blades [57] [3] [58] [59]\n\n\nRitual\nThe deceased were typically interred in oval or rectangular graves, either individually or more commonly as part of small

gabbroic clay continued to be the primary fabric for pottery production as in the Final Bronze Age period [350] Around 300 BCE, in the Middle Iron Age, South West Decorated Ware, also known as Glastonbury Ware, emerged as a regional pottery style from Cornwall to the Mendips This style made less use of granitic fabrics, and by the late Iron Age pottery in Cornwall is almost entirely made from gabbroic clay [351] [352]\n\n\nStone and organic tools\nDuring the later Iron Age, rotary querns were introduced alongside the continued use of saddle querns for grain processing [363] Evidence

inhabitants of this region, [279] and the Bronze Age inhabitants of present-day Cornwall likely had complex identities that were linked to family, obligation, and regional geography [279] [189] [280]\n\n\nBronze Age (c. 2400–800 BCE)\nThe Bronze Age in Britain is dated to the arrival of the Bell Beaker culture, which is initially a Copper Age, followed by the adoption of tin and copper alloying techniques to manufacture bronze tools and weapons a few hundred years later [182] Bell Beaker culture was probably introduced to Cornwall via Southern Britain, rather than directly from the European mainland [183] [184] [185] Ancient DNA studies have revealed significant human migrations into Britain during the Beaker to Early Bronze Age period, with groups carrying high levels of Yamnaya-related ancestry arriving from the European mainland [186] [187] Ancient DNA studies also show that a second migration of groups from Europe, who carried Yamnaya-related ancestry with comparatively high levels of Early European Farmer ancestry, occurred c 1300–800 BCE [188]\n\n\nChronology and overview\nThe Iron Age in Britain is usually dated from c 800 BCE until the Roman

feature extensive field systems indicating mixed farming incorporating both crop cultivation and pastoralism [364]\n\n\nSocial organization\nAt least in the Early to Middle Iron Age, hillforts and cliff castles have been interpreted as the dwellings of a dominant cattle-owning elite class who controlled long-distance trade routes and access to land including rights to sheep grazing It has been suggested that they engaged in patron-client relationships with the lower strata of society, who occupied the smaller enclosed settlements [290] [319] [162]\n\n\nTrade and cultural links\nIn Britain the inhabitants of the promontory called Belerion are particularly friendly to strangers and have become civilized through contacts with merchants from foreign parts ...They prepare the tin, working the ground in which it is produced very carefully ...They beat the metal into masses shaped like astragali and carry it to a certain island lying off Britain called Ictis.\n\nEthnicity and genetics\nThere is no evidence that the current boundaries of Cornwall held any significance for the Bronze Age inhabitants of this region, [279] and the Bronze Age inhabitants of present-day Cornwall likely had complex identities that were linked to family, obligation, and regional geography [279] [189] [280]\n\n\nIron Age (c. 800 BCE – 43 CE)\nThe Iron Age in Britain is usually dated from c 800 BCE until the Roman invasion, c 43 CE [282] [283] This period marked a significant transition from bronze to iron for tool and weapon production, [284] and coincided with widespread climatic deterioration across Europe that resulted in colder and wetter conditions throughout much of the Iron Age [204]\n\n\nChronology and overview\nThe Iron Age in Britain is usually dated from c 800 BCE until the Roman invasion, c 43 CE [282] [283] This period marked a significant transition from bronze to iron for tool and weapon production, [284] and coincided with widespread climatic deterioration across Europe that resulted in colder and wetter conditions throughout much of the Iron Age [204]\n\n\nEnvironment\nDuring the transition to the Iron Age, between c 800 and 750 BCE, an abrupt climatic shift known as the 2.7 (or 2.8) Ka event occurred across Europe, resulting in colder and wetter conditions in Britain that lasted between c 200 and 400 years This period was followed by a return to drier conditions that lasted until c 400 BCE when another shift towards wetter conditions occurred [204] However there is only limited evidence for climatic deterioration on Bodmin Moor around the onset of the Iron Age [297] Between 550–380 BCE, some sites on Bodmin Moor experienced increasingly wetter conditions, which may be attributable to either climate deterioration or deforestation [298] Pollen analysis suggests major woodland clearance on Roughtor c 760–390 BCE, [299] and at Higher Moors, Scilly, c 820–410 BCE [300] In the Late Iron Age there was an increase in heather cover on Bodmin Moor, which could be attributed to factors such as acidification of the soil, reduced grazing activity, or deliberate burning [297]\n\n\nMaterial culture\nIron Age settlements in Cornwall include enclosed settlements such as rounds, cliff castles, and hillforts, as well as large numbers of unenclosed settlements of single or multiple roundhouses [288] [301] [302] There is some overlap in the definitions of the various enclosed settlement types [303] In some cases open settlements were later fully or partially enclosed, and earlier enclosed settlements were occasionally expanded with additional fortifications [304] At the beginning of the Iron Age, settlements shift from higher ground on moors to lowlands, perhaps as a result of deteriorating climatic conditions and overgrazing [305] [306] There is an apparent decline in the number of open settlements in the Later Iron Age, with a corresponding increase in the number of enclosed settlements [307] Iron Age settlements in Cornwall were often built within extensive field systems [308]\n\n\nSettlements\nIron Age settlements in Cornwall include enclosed settlements such as rounds, cliff castles, and

open settlements in the Later Iron Age, with a corresponding increase in the number of enclosed settlements [307] Iron Age settlements in Cornwall were often built within extensive field systems [308]\n\n\nPottery\nThe earliest Iron Age pottery in Cornwall (c 800–600 BCE), including shouldered jars and carinated jars and bowls, is found at Trevelgue Head [349] This is followed by Plain Jar Group that dates to the Early Iron Age, c 6th to 4th century BCE [350] The Plain Jar pottery shows a shift towards a more extensive use of granitic fabrics compared with the preceding period, although gabbroic clay continued to be the primary fabric for pottery production as in the Final Bronze Age period [350] Around 300 BCE, in the Middle Iron Age, South West Decorated Ware, also known as Glastonbury Ware, emerged as a regional pottery style from Cornwall to the Mendips This style made less use of granitic fabrics, and by the late Iron Age pottery in Cornwall is almost entirely made from gabbroic clay [351] [352]\n\n\nMetal\nHaematite (iron ore) is found in Cornwall near St Austell, Launceston, and especially the Great Perran Lode near Trevelgue Head, which was a major source for Early Iron Age iron production Evidence for industrial-scale iron working is found at Trevelgue, and to a lesser extent at the Early Iron Age site at Chûn and the Late Iron Age site at Chysauster [358] [335] [337] [359] Iron artefacts are rarely preserved due to Cornwall's acidic soils, with the few examples dating to the Late Iron Age [328]\n\n\nStone and organic tools\nDuring the later Iron Age, rotary querns were introduced alongside the continued use of saddle querns for grain processing [363] Evidence of textile production includes loom weights and spindle whorls which are found at sites such as Castle Gotha [364]\n\n\nRitual\nThe deceased were typically interred in oval or rectangular graves, either individually or more commonly as part of small cemeteries [287] [365] [366] Distinctive burial traditions ('South Western Cist Burials') are found in Cornwall and Scilly [365] from the Middle Iron Age This tradition involves placing the dead in a flexed or crouched position, with the head towards the north [365] [366] While grave goods are uncommon, decorated metal items sometimes accompany burials [365] [366] Examples include the cist burial at Bryher, Scilly, where grave goods included a sword, shield, and a decorated mirror [287] In another example, at the Late Iron Age cemetery at Trethellan (c 200 BCE – 100 CE), the dead were interred wearing clothing and jewellery, including bronze brooches [287]\n\n\nSubsistence\nThe Iron Age economy was predominantly pastoral, based on cattle and especially sheep, with wool production as a significant sector [162] Additionally, evidence is found for arable farming, including the cultivation of barley, oats, rye, emmer, and spelt, [289] supported by the finds of quern stones for grain grinding [364] Some sites

the ground in which it is produced very carefully ...They beat the metal into masses shaped like astragali and carry it to a certain island lying off Britain called Ictis.\n\nEthnicity\nThe name Cornwall is believed to derive from the Cornovii (Common Brittonic: *kornou̯(i̯)ī) tribe who are generally thought to have inhabited this region during the Iron Age The tribal name of the Cornovii ultimately derives from Common Brittonic *korn, meaning horn, which may be interpreted either as 'peninsula', or as a reference to a horned animal or the Celtic deity Cernunnos [296] [382] [383]\n\n\nGenetics\nBy the Iron Age, Early European Farmer ancestry in Southern Britain had increased to c 36%–38.8% as populations with comparatively higher levels of this component migrated from Europe during the Middle to Late Bronze Age [188]\n\n\nCitations\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

I have never believed that transformation  [should] be demanded to gain love.\n\n\nCasting\nIn assembling the film's voice cast, del Toro and Gustafson selected multiple Academy Award winners and gifted performers with past creative ties with the former [15] Daniel Radcliffe, Tom Waits and Christopher Walken were originally considered to star in the film Waits was reportedly considered to voice Geppetto and del Toro was reported by /Film to be floating up casting Walken as the Fox, though he was also considering Donald Sutherland for that part Radcliffe would later instead remain as executive producer of the film [31] Early on during the film's development, del Toro first approached John Hurt, with whom he had worked on Hellboy (2004) and Hellboy II: The Golden Army, to voice Geppetto, but Hurt eventually died in 2017 long before any recordings for the film could begin [32]\n\n\nFilming\nFilming commenced at the Portland, Oregon offices of ShadowMachine by January 31, 2020 [15] [33] Production continued through early summer 2022, with some select sequences being handled by del Toro's own Centro Internacional de Animación (CIA) local studio, settled on Guadalajara, Mexico since 2019 to foster local talent from Mexico All sets, props and character costumes were crafted to the same historical and realistic standards del Toro's live-action work has often contained, hence the production's decision to not overly stylize buildings through methods like stylizing them in a curvy, stretched and leaning way, leading to a mix of stop-motion and live-action styles that support the film's themes Animators were also encouraged to achieve naturalistic performances from the puppets by making them \"commit mistakes\" like itching, sneezing or looking away if embarrassed or scared in order to shoot the characters thinking and listening, traits not usually shot in animation [15] For Count Volpe's carnival, Davis and Enderle drew from the reference material library collected for del Toro's previous film Nightmare Alley, which prominently starred a 1930s carnival and in which Davis had previously worked as a concept artist, even though that film's carnival was one settled in the American Midwest rather than in Europe, so despite the great overlap between American and European carnivals, the filmmakers developed looks for both carnivals that were similarly downtrodden and threadbare Some Nightmare Alley early shots featuring Bradley Cooper's Stanton Carlisle arriving at the carnival inspired the sequence that establishes Volpe's carnival [37] The afterlife sequences and the end credits scene were animated by studio El Taller de Chucho in Guadalajara, Mexico [38]\n\n\nVisual effects\nThe film's production quality was formed through the ornate detail of the sets and characters with their own textures in order to reinterpret Collodi's work in a way that differed from the Disney animated version Del Toro told Vanity Fair: \"I have been very vocal about my admiration and my great, great love for Disney all my life, but that is an impulse that actually makes me move away from that version I think it is a pinnacle of Disney animation It's done in the most beautiful, hand-drawn 2D animation\" [10] He saw as \"beautiful\" the idea of using puppets to create a movie about a puppet, while pushing the boundaries of stop-motion as much as possible to create a \"heartfelt\" movie any audience could watch [15] Moving Picture Company worked on the visual effects, with Bot VFX and Mist VFX.\n\n\nMusic\nOn January 8, 2020, Alexandre Desplat started composing the film's score and original songs [1] It is Desplat's and del Toro's second collaboration, after The Shape of Water [1] Roeban Katz was the lyricist [15] On August 23, 2012, Nick Cave was attached to compose the score, but he was replaced by Desplat eight years later [39]\n\n\nRelease\nIn November 2018, Netflix set the film's release date for 2021 [40] In January 2021, Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos revealed that the release could be moved to 2022 or later, with Netflix's notion of releasing six animated films a year [41] In December 2021, del Toro stated it will be released in the last quarter of 2022 [42] In January and July 2022, with the release of the film's first teaser, it was announced for a December release [43] Over its first seven days of digital release, the film

Geppetto, but Hurt eventually died in 2017 long before any recordings for the film could begin [32]\n\n\nFilming\nFilming commenced at the Portland, Oregon offices of ShadowMachine by January 31, 2020 [15] [33] Production continued through early summer 2022, with some select sequences being handled by del Toro's own Centro Internacional de Animación (CIA) local studio, settled on Guadalajara, Mexico since 2019 to foster local talent from Mexico All sets, props and character costumes were crafted to the same historical and realistic standards del Toro's live-action work has often contained, hence the production's decision to not overly stylize buildings through methods like stylizing them in a curvy, stretched and leaning way, leading to a mix of stop-motion and live-action styles that support the film's themes Animators were also encouraged to achieve naturalistic performances from the puppets by making them \"commit mistakes\" like itching, sneezing or looking away if embarrassed or scared in order to shoot the characters thinking and listening, traits not usually shot in animation [15] For Count Volpe's carnival, Davis and Enderle drew from the reference material library collected for del Toro's previous film Nightmare Alley, which prominently starred a 1930s carnival and in which Davis had previously worked as a concept artist, even though that film's carnival was one settled in the American Midwest rather than in Europe, so despite the great overlap between American and European carnivals, the filmmakers developed looks for both carnivals that were similarly downtrodden and threadbare Some Nightmare Alley early shots featuring Bradley Cooper's Stanton Carlisle arriving at the carnival inspired the sequence that establishes Volpe's carnival [37] The afterlife sequences and the end credits scene were animated by studio El Taller de Chucho in Guadalajara, Mexico [38]\n\n\nVisual effects\nThe film's production quality was formed through the ornate detail of the sets and characters with their own textures in order to reinterpret Collodi's work in a way that differed from the Disney animated version Del Toro told Vanity Fair: \"I have been very vocal about my admiration and my great, great love for Disney all my life, but that is an impulse that actually makes me move away from that version I think it is a pinnacle of Disney animation It's done in the most beautiful, hand-drawn 2D animation\" [10] He saw as \"beautiful\" the idea of using puppets to create a movie about a puppet, while pushing the boundaries of stop-motion as much as possible to create a \"heartfelt\" movie any audience could watch [15] Moving Picture Company worked on the visual effects, with Bot VFX and Mist VFX.\n\n\nMusic\nOn January 8, 2020, Alexandre Desplat started composing the film's score and original songs [1] It is Desplat's and del Toro's second collaboration, after The Shape of Water [1] Roeban Katz was the lyricist [15] On August 23, 2012, Nick Cave was attached to compose the score, but he was replaced by Desplat eight years later [39]\n\n\nRelease\nIn November 2018, Netflix set the film's release date for 2021 [40] In January 2021, Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos revealed that the release could be moved to 2022 or later, with Netflix's notion of releasing six animated films a year [41] In December 2021, del Toro stated it will be released in the last quarter of 2022 [42] In January and July 2022, with the release of the film's first teaser, it was announced for a December release [43] Over its first seven days of digital release, the film logged over 10.91 million hours viewed worldwide [44]\n\n\nReception\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 96% of 290 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.3/10 The website's consensus reads: \"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio delivers fully on its title – which is to say it's a visually stunning adaptation that embraces its source material's darkness.\" [57] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 79 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews [58]\n\n\nCritical response\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 96% of 290 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.3/10 The website's consensus reads: \"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio delivers fully on its

streaming service under the animation studio Netflix Animation, who have also competed with three previous nominations for the same category, as well as the seventh non-Disney/Pixar film to win and the first non-Disney/Pixar film since Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, the second stop-motion animated film after Aardman's Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, and The Adventures of

She is best known for her work as a model in the 1960s and 1970s, particularly with designer Halston, and for her distinctive jewelry designs that have been worn by celebrities and exhibited in museums.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nElsa Peretti was born in Florence, Italy, as the youngest daughter of Ferdinando Peretti (1896–1977) and Maria Luisa Pighini. Her father founded Anonima Petroli Italiana (API), a large Italian oil company, in 1933. Peretti was estranged from her conservative family for much of her life, although she reconciled with her father shortly before he died.\n\nPeretti's early life was marked by a sense of disconnection from her family and cultural heritage. Her parents were from a wealthy and influential family in Florence, but Peretti's relationship with them was strained. She has spoken about feeling like an outsider within her own family, and about the difficulties she faced in navigating her own identity and sense of belonging.\n\n**Career**\n\nIn 1964, Peretti became a fashion model, working in Barcelona, Spain. She was discovered by a modeling agency and quickly gained recognition for her unique look and style. In 1968, she moved to New York City on the advice of Wilhelmina Modeling Agency, where she continued to work as a model and began to establish herself as a fixture in the city's fashion scene.\n\nPeretti's career as a model was marked by her association with designer Halston, who became a mentor and friend to her. She was one of a group of models known as the Halstonettes, who worked closely with Halston to showcase his designs on the runway and in editorials. Peretti's association with Halston helped to establish her as a leading model of the time, and her work with him continues to be celebrated for its innovative and influential style.\n\n**Modeling**\n\nPeretti's work as a model was marked by her unique look and style, which was characterized by her striking features and her ability to convey a sense of elegance and sophistication. She was known for her ability to wear a wide range of styles and designs, from haute couture to more casual and everyday wear.\n\nPeretti's association with Halston was a key factor in her success as a model. Halston's designs were known for their innovative use of materials and their emphasis on clean lines and simple shapes. Peretti's ability to wear these designs with ease and confidence helped to establish her as a leading model of the time.\n\n**Jewelry Design**\n\nIn 1969, Peretti began creating new jewelry styles for a handful of fashion designers in Manhattan. Her first design, working with a silversmith in Spain, was a two-inch bud vase made of sterling-silver as a pendant on a leather thong necklace. This design was inspired by a find at a flea market, and it was worn in a runway show by one of Giorgio di Sant' Angelo's models. The design was a hit, and it marked the beginning of Peretti's career as a jewelry designer.\n\nPeretti's jewelry designs were known for their use of simple shapes and clean lines, as well as their emphasis on natural materials and organic forms. She was particularly fond of using silver, which she helped to shift from a \"common\" material to a popular choice for celebrities and style leaders. Her designs were worn by Liza Minnelli and other celebrities, and they continue to be celebrated for their innovative and influential style.\n\n**Catalonia, Spain**\n\nIn 1968, Peretti bought a house in the largely decrepit village of Sant Martí Vell in Catalonia, Spain. Over the next ten years, she had the house restored, often living in rough conditions during the process. By the 1980s, the mustard-yellow house was her preferred home.\n\nPeretti's association with Catalonia and its culture had a profound impact on her work as a jewelry designer. She was inspired by the flora and fauna of Sant Martí Vell, and she incorporated elements of Catalan folk art and design into her work. Her scorpion necklace, for example, is now in the British Museum, and it is considered one of her most iconic designs.\n\n**Philanthropy**\n\nIn 2000, Peretti created a charity in honor of her father, called the Nando Peretti Foundation (NPF). The foundation is reported to have given approximately 42 million euros to 852 projects worldwide over 15 years.

men were jailed at Chelmsford Crown Court in February 2023 for their involvement in the robbery [294]\n\n\nMemoirs\nIn June 2009, his autobiography Boy Racer, which covered his career up to that year, was published by Ebury Press [16] [299] At a press conference in London ahead of the 2009 Tour de France, Cavendish explained the book was \"more a biography of last year's Tour stage wins\" than an autobiography [300] His \"biggest motivation for writing it had been to explain himself better\", to counter the way he came across during interviews immediately after races [300] In an interview with Cyclingnews.com, Cavendish said the book would \"cause some controversy\" before stating it is positive in respect to others [299] The book addresses many events including an offer of more money from elsewhere to leave Team Columbia–High Road in 2008, which Cavendish declined; relationships with teams and riders; and significant moments for him of some races [301] [302] Each chapter describes a

de France, Cavendish explained the book was \"more a biography of last year's Tour stage wins\" than an autobiography [300] His \"biggest motivation for writing it had been to explain himself better\", to counter the way he came across during interviews immediately after races [300] In an interview with Cyclingnews.com, Cavendish said the book would \"cause some controversy\" before stating it is positive in respect to others [299] The book addresses many events including an offer of more money from elsewhere to leave Team Columbia–High Road in 2008, which Cavendish declined;

In Autumn 2016, Harding appeared alongside Andy Moss in a UK tour of Ghost: The Musical. However, she was replaced mid-tour by Carolyn Maitland after pulling out due to the subsequent pain from her injury after The Jump. In August 2017, Harding won the twentieth series of Celebrity Big Brother.\n\n## Personal Life\n\nHarding was in an on-and-off relationship with Calum Best from 2005 to 2006. They remained friends until her death. Harding was engaged to DJ Tom Crane during 2011. She was also in a two-year relationship with DJ Mark Foster from late 2012 to late 2014. She also began a relationship with Celebrity Big Brother co-star Chad Johnson during their series of the programme. After the pair had finished the series, they had a brief long-distance relationship but ended it, remaining friends until her death. Following her death, Johnson said that he felt sad that Harding had never been able to fulfil her dream of becoming a mother.\n\n## Illness and Death\n\nOn 26 August 2020, Harding announced that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer that had advanced to \"other parts\" of her body. In October 2020, it was reported that she was living with her mother in Manchester upon undergoing treatment. In March 2021, she stated that the disease was terminal and that she did not expect to \"see another Christmas.\"\n\n## Discography\n\n* Sarah Harding (2011)\n\n### Extended Plays\n\n* Orchestral Songs (2014)\n\n### Singles\n\n* \"Touch\" (2008)\n* \"Cry Too Hard\" (2011)\n* \"Mummy\" (2011)\n* \"Just Imagine\" (2018)\n\n### Other Appearances\n\n* Girls Aloud - Sound of the Underground (2002)\n* Girls Aloud - Love Machine (2002)\n* Girls Aloud - The Sound of Girls Aloud (2003)\n* Girls Aloud - Chemistry (2005)\n* Girls Aloud - Tangled Up (2007)\n* Girls Aloud - The Sound of Girls Aloud: Out of Control (2008)\n* Girls Aloud - Ten (2012)\n\n## Filmography\n\n* Run for Your Wife (2013)\n* Ghost: The Musical (2016)\n\n## See Also\n\n* Girls Aloud\n* Popstars: The Rivals\n* Celebrity Big Brother\n* Cancer Awareness\n\n## External Links\n\n* Sarah Harding on Twitter\n* Sarah Harding on Instagram\n* Sarah Harding on Facebook", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Sarah_Harding\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nHarding was born Sarah Nicole Hardman on 17 November 1981 in Ascot, Berkshire [2] [3] [4] [5] She attended St Cuthbert's Primary School in Egham until 1993 [6] She was raised with two half brothers and moved to Stockport when she was 14 after her parents' separation Harding's father had begun dating a younger woman, she therefore disowned her father and changed her surname to Harding [7] She attended Hazel Grove High School from 1993 to 1998 and later attended Stockport College where she studied hair and beauty [8] She then worked as part of the promotions team for two nightclubs in The Grand Central Leisure Park in Stockport, as a waitress at Pizza Hut, a van driver, debt collector and as a BT telephone operator She also toured North West England performing at pubs, social clubs and caravan parks to support herself In 2002, she was recording dance tracks when she decided to audition for UK talent-search shows She auditioned for Fame Academy and Popstars: The Rivals [9] It was in the latter on which she found fame, pulling out of Fame Academy after being accepted into the first round of Popstars Harding also entered FHM's High Street Honeys 2002, the magazine's national beauty contest Her pictures appeared in the top 100, but Harding withdrew upon achieving success on Popstars [10]\n\n\nCareer\nIn 2002, Harding auditioned for the reality television show Popstars: The Rivals [11] The programme, the second British series of the international Popstars franchise, would see the creation of two rival groups – a boy band and a girl group each consisting of five members, which would then compete against each other for the 2002 Christmas Number One spot on the UK Singles Chart Several thousand applicants attended auditions across the UK in hope of being selected Ten girls and ten boys were chosen as finalists by judges Pete Waterman, Louis Walsh and Geri Halliwell These finalists then took to the stage participating in weekly Saturday night live performances (alternating weekly between the girls and boys) Each week the contestant polling the fewest phone votes was eliminated, until the final line-ups of the groups emerged Harding joined Nadine Coyle, Cheryl Tweedy, Nicola Roberts and Kimberley Walsh to comprise the new girl group Girls Aloud, formed through the show by a public vote on 30 November 2002 [1]\n\n\n2002–2009: Popstars: The Rivals and Girls Aloud\nIn 2002, Harding auditioned for the reality television show Popstars: The Rivals [11] The programme, the second British series of the international Popstars franchise, would see the creation of two rival groups – a boy band and a girl group each consisting of five members, which would then compete against each other for the 2002 Christmas Number One spot on the UK Singles Chart Several thousand applicants attended auditions across the UK in hope of being selected Ten girls and ten boys were chosen as finalists by judges Pete Waterman, Louis Walsh and Geri Halliwell These finalists then took to the stage participating in weekly Saturday night live performances (alternating weekly between the girls and boys) Each week the contestant polling the fewest phone votes was eliminated, until the final line-ups of the groups emerged Harding joined Nadine Coyle, Cheryl Tweedy, Nicola Roberts and Kimberley Walsh to comprise the new girl group Girls Aloud, formed through the show by a public vote on 30 November 2002 [1]\n\n\n2009–2014: Reunion with Girls Aloud, disbandment and acting\nIn December 2009, Harding appeared on MTV's Sarah Harding in 24 Hours Harding and her then-boyfriend, DJ Tom Crayne, also launched a new nightclub named Kanaloa Harding's guest vocals appear alongside Kanobby on the Roger Sanchez and Far East Movement track \"2Gether\";

conventional business deal that places commercial obligation .. over the unspoken contract of compassion and empathy that he seems to have neglected to sign with his family.\" [17]\n\n\nNative Americans\nAmong interpreters who see the film reflecting more subtly the social concerns that animate other Kubrick films, one of the early viewpoints was discussed in an essay by ABC reporter Bill Blakemore titled \"Kubrick's 'Shining' Secret: Film's Hidden Horror Is The Murder of the Indian\", first published in The Washington Post on July 12, 1987 [18] [a] He believes that indirect references to American killings of Native Americans pervade the film, as exemplified by the Amerindian logos on the baking powder in the kitchen and the Amerindian artwork that appears throughout the hotel, though no Native Americans are seen Stuart Ullman tells Wendy that when building the hotel, a few Indian attacks had to be fended off since it was constructed on an Indian burial ground [18]\n\n\nGeoffrey Cocks and Kubrick's concern with the Holocaust\nFilm historian Geoffrey Cocks has extended Blakemore's idea that the film has a subtext about Native Americans by arguing that the film indirectly reflects Stanley Kubrick's concerns about the Holocaust (both Cocks's book and Michael Herr's memoir of Kubrick discuss how he wanted his entire life to make a film dealing directly with the Holocaust but could never quite make up his mind) Cocks, writing in his book The Wolf at the Door: Stanley Kubrick, History and the Holocaust, proposed a controversial theory that all of Kubrick's work is informed by the Holocaust; there is, he says, a holocaust subtext in The Shining This, Cocks believes, is why Kubrick's screenplay goes to emotional extremes, omitting much of the novel's supernaturalism and making the character of Wendy much more hysteria-prone [22] Cocks places Kubrick's vision of a haunted hotel in line with a long literary tradition of hotels in which sinister events occur, from Stephen Crane's short story \"The Blue Hotel\" (which Kubrick admired) to the Swiss Berghof in Thomas Mann's novel The Magic Mountain, about a snowbound sanatorium high in the Swiss Alps in which the protagonist witnesses a series of events which are a microcosm of the decline of Western culture [23]\n\n\nLiterary allusions\nGeoffrey Cocks notes that the film contains many allusions to fairy-tales, both Hansel and Gretel and the Three Little Pigs, [22] with Jack Torrance identified as the Big Bad Wolf, which Bruno Bettelheim interprets as standing for \"all the asocial unconscious devouring powers\" that must be overcome by a child's ego.\n\n\nArtworks in the film\nNumerous paintings and sculptures appear throughout the film Several paintings by Group of Seven artists appear including The Solemn Land (1921) by J E H MacDonald, Northern River (1914) by Tom Thomson, Stormy Weather, Georgian Bay (1921) by Frederick Varley, Red Maple (1914) by A Y Jackson, Mist Fantasy, Sand River, Algoma (1920) by J.E.H MacDonald, Maligne Lake, Jasper Park (1924) by Lawren Harris, Beaver Swamp (1920) by Lawren Harris, and Arpeggio (1932) by Frederick Varley [28] Two paintings by Indigenous Canadian artist Norval Morrisseau can be seen in the film including The Great Earth Mother (1976), and Flock of Loons (1975)––Morriseau was part of the Professional Native Indian Artists Inc (PNIAI) which came to be informally known as the \"Indian Group of Seven\" [29] [21] [30]\n\n\nAmbiguities in the film\nRoger Ebert notes that the film does not really have a \"reliable observer\", with the possible exception of Dick Hallorann Ebert believes various events call into question the reliability of Jack, Wendy and Danny [40] This leads Ebert to conclude that:\n\n\nGhosts versus cabin fever\nIn some sequences, there is a question of whether or not there are ghosts present In the scenes where Jack sees ghosts, he is always facing a mirror or, in the case of his storeroom conversation with Grady, a reflective, highly polished door Film reviewer James Berardinelli notes \"It has been pointed out that there's a mirror in every scene in which Jack sees a ghost, causing us to wonder whether the spirits are reflections of a tortured psyche.\" [42]\nIn Hollywood's Stephen King, Tony Magistrale wrote,\n\n\nTwo Gradys and other doubles\nEarly in the film, Stuart Ullman tells Jack of a previous caretaker, Charles Grady, who, in 1970, succumbed to cabin fever, murdered his family and then killed himself Later, Jack meets a ghostly butler named Grady Jack says that he knows about the murders, claiming to recognize Grady from pictures, but the butler introduces himself as Delbert Grady.\n\n\nPhotograph\nAt the end of the film, the camera moves slowly toward a wall in the Overlook and a 1921 photograph, revealed to include Jack seen at the middle of a July 4, 1921, party In an interview with Michel Ciment, Kubrick said that the photograph suggests that Jack was a reincarnation of an earlier official at the hotel [47] This has not stopped alternative readings, such as that Jack has been \"absorbed\" into the Overlook Hotel Film critic Jonathan Romney, while acknowledging the absorption theory, wrote:\n\n\nSpatial layout of the Overlook Hotel\nScreenwriter Todd Alcott has noted:\n\n\nProduction\nBefore making The Shining, Kubrick directed the film Barry Lyndon (1975), a highly visual period film about an Irishman who attempts to make his way into the British aristocracy Despite its technical achievements, the film was not a box-office success in the United States and was derided by critics for being too long and too slow Kubrick, disappointed with Barry Lyndon's lack of success, realized he needed to make a film that would be commercially viable as well as artistically fulfilling Stephen King was told that Kubrick had his staff bring him stacks of horror books as he planted himself in his office to read them all: \"Kubrick's secretary heard the sound of each book hitting the wall as the director flung it into a reject pile after reading the first few pages Finally, one day the secretary noticed it had been a while since she had heard the thud of another writer's work biting the dust She walked in to check on her boss and found Kubrick deeply engrossed in reading a copy of the manuscript of The Shining\" [55]\n\n\nGenesis\nBefore making The Shining, Kubrick directed the film Barry Lyndon (1975), a highly visual period film about an Irishman who attempts to make his way into the British aristocracy Despite its technical achievements, the film was not a box-office success in the United States and was derided by critics for being too long and too slow Kubrick, disappointed with Barry

first few pages Finally, one day the secretary noticed it had been a while since she had heard the thud of another writer's work biting the dust She walked in to check on her boss and found Kubrick deeply engrossed in reading a copy of the manuscript of The Shining\" [55]\n\n\nCasting\nNicholson was Kubrick's first choice for the role of Jack Torrance; other actors considered included Robert De Niro (who said the film gave him nightmares for a month), [57] Robin Williams, and Harrison Ford, all of whom met with Stephen King's disapproval [58] Kris Kristofferson was Kubrick's backup choice if Nicholson had declined [59] King, for his part, disavowed Nicholson because he thought that, since his part in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, the viewer would tend to consider him an unstable individual from the beginning For this reason, King preferred Jon Voight, Michael Moriarty, or Martin Sheen for the role, who would more faithfully represent the profile of the ordinary individual who is gradually driven to madness [60] [61] In any case, from the beginning the writer was told that the actor for the lead role \"was not negotiable.\" [62] [63]\n\n\nFilming\nMain photography began in May 1978 and wrapped in July 1979, it took place mainly in Elstree Studios, in southern England.\n\n\nInterior sets\nHaving chosen King's novel as a basis for his next project, and after a pre-production phase, Kubrick had sets constructed on soundstages at EMI Elstree Studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, England Some of the interior designs of the Overlook Hotel set were based on those of the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National Park To enable him to shoot the scenes in loose chronological order, he used several stages at EMI Elstree Studios in order to make all sets available during the complete duration of production The set for the Overlook Hotel was at the time the largest ever built at Elstree, including a life-size re-creation of the exterior of the hotel [70] In February 1979, the Colorado Lounge set at Elstree was badly damaged in a fire, causing a delay in the production [71] [72] [73]\n\n\nExterior locations\nWhile most of the film was shot on interior sets and the full-scale exterior facade replica at Elstree Studios, a second-unit crew headed by Jan Harlan shot some sequences on location in the American West Saint Mary Lake and its Wild Goose Island in Glacier National Park, Montana were featured in the aerial shots of the opening scenes, with the Volkswagen Beetle driving along Going-to-the-Sun Road The Timberline Lodge on Mount Hood in Oregon was filmed for a few of the establishing shots of the fictional Overlook Hotel; absent in these shots is the hedge maze, which the real Timberline Lodge does not have The Ahwahnee Hotel (the Overlook Hotel's main interior reference) and the Timberline Lodge (the hotel's main exterior) were both designed by architect Gilbert Stanley Underwood, in the 1920s and 1930s respectively [74]\n\n\nWriting\nIn 1977, a Warner Bros executive, John Calley, sent Kubrick the proofs of what would become the novel [76] Its author, Stephen King, was already at that time a best-selling author who, after the blockbuster of Carrie, could boast of successes in adaptations for the big screen For his part, Kubrick had been considering directing a horror film for some time; a few years before, while Barry Lyndon disappointed at the box office, [77] another Warner film he had refused to direct, The Exorcist, [78] directed by William Friedkin, was breaking box office records around the world.\n\n\nPhotography\nThe Shining had a very prolonged and arduous production period, often with very long workdays Principal photography took over a year to complete, due to Kubrick's highly methodical nature Actress Shelley Duvall frequently argued with Kubrick on set about lines in the script and her acting techniques [65] Nicholson was living in London with his then-girlfriend Anjelica Huston and her younger sister, Allegra, who testified to his long shooting days [85] Joe Turkel stated in a 2014 interview that they rehearsed the \"bar scene\" for six weeks and that the shoot day lasted from 9 a.m to 10:30 p.m., with Turkel recollecting that his clothes were soaked in perspiration by the end of the day's shoot He also described it as his favorite scene in the film [86]\n\n\nSteadicam\nThe Shining was among the early half-dozen films (after the films Bound for Glory, Marathon Man, and Rocky, all released in 1976), to use the newly developed Steadicam, [96] [97] a stabilizing mount for a motion picture camera, which mechanically separates the operator's movement from the camera's, allowing smooth tracking shots while the operator is moving over an uneven surface It essentially combines the stabilized steady footage of a regular mount with the fluidity and flexibility of a handheld camera The inventor of the Steadicam, Garrett Brown, was heavily involved with the production of The Shining Brown has described his excitement taking his first tour of the sets, which offered \"further possibilities for the Steadicam\" This tour convinced Brown to become personally involved with the production Kubrick was not \"just talking of stunt shots and staircases\" Rather he would use the Steadicam \"as it was intended to be used — as a tool which can help get the lens where it's wanted in space and time without the classic limitations of the dolly and crane\" Brown used an 18 mm Cooke lens that allowed the Steadicam to pass within an inch of walls and door frames [98] Brown published an article in American Cinematographer about his experience, [99] and contributed to the audio commentary on the 2007 DVD release.\n\n\nMusic and soundtrack\nThe stylistically modernist art-music chosen by Kubrick is similar to the repertoire he first explored in 2001: A Space Odyssey Although the repertoire was selected by Kubrick, the process of matching passages of music to motion picture was left almost entirely at the discretion of music editor Gordon Stainforth, whose work on this film is known for attention to fine details and remarkably precise synchronization without excessive splicing [101]\n\n\nRelease\nUnlike Kubrick's previous works, which developed audiences gradually through word-of-mouth, The Shining initially opened on 10 screens in New York City and Los Angeles on the Memorial Day weekend, then was released as a mass-market film nationwide within a month [107] [108] [109] The European release of The Shining a few months later was 25 minutes shorter due to Kubrick's removal of most of the scenes taking place outside the environs of the hotel.\n\n\nPost-release edit\n\nAfter its premiere and a week into the general run (with a running time of 146 minutes), Kubrick cut a scene at the end that took place in a hospital The scene shows Wendy in a bed talking with Mr Ullman, who explains that Jack's body could not be found; he then gives Danny a yellow tennis ball, presumably the same one that Jack was throwing around the hotel This scene was subsequently physically cut out of prints by projectionists and sent back to the studio by order of Warner Bros., the film's distributor This cut the film's running time to 144 minutes Roger Ebert commented: \n\nEuropean version\nFor its release in Europe, Kubrick cut about 25 minutes from the film [112] [113] [114] The excised scenes included: a longer meeting between Jack and Watson at the hotel; Danny being attended by a doctor (Anne Jackson), including references to Tony and how Jack once injured Danny in a drunken rage; more footage of Hallorann's attempts to get to the hotel during the snowstorm, including a sequence with a garage attendant (Tony Burton); extended dialogue scenes at the hotel; and a scene where Wendy discovers a group of skeletons in the hotel lobby during the climax Jackson and Burton are credited in the European print, despite their scenes having been excised from the movie According to Harlan, Kubrick decided to cut some sequences because the film was \"not very well received\", and also after Warner Brothers had complained about its ambiguity and length [115]\n\n\nHome media\nThe U.S network television premiere of The Shining (on ABC's Friday Night Movie of May 6, 1983) [117] started with a placard saying, \"Tonight's Film Deals With the Supernatural, As a Possessed Man Attempts to Destroy His Family.\" [118] With the movie's ambiguities, it is not known how Kubrick felt about or if he agreed with this proclamation The placard also said that the film was edited for television and warned about the content [116]\n\n\nAd campaigns\nVarious theatrical posters were used during the original 1980–1981 international release cycle, [121] [122] [123] [124] [125] but in the U.S., where the film first opened, the primary poster and newspaper advert was designed by noted Hollywood graphic designer Saul Bass [122] [126] [127] [128] [129] [130] Bass and Kubrick reportedly went through over 300 potential designs before settling on the final design of an unsettling, angry-looking, underlit, pointillistic doll-like face (which does not appear in the film) peering through the letters \"The\", with \"SHiNiNG\" below, in smaller letters At the top of the poster are the words \"A MASTERPIECE OF MODERN HORROR\", with the credits and other information at the bottom [122] [129] [130]\n\n\n4K version\nTurner Classic Movies and Fathom Events had a limited screening in October 2016 in 2K and 4K resolution [131]\n\n\nReception\nThe Shining opened on the same weekend as The Empire Strikes Back but was released on 10 screens and grossed $622,337 for the four-day weekend, the third highest-grossing opening weekend from fewer than 50 screens of all time, behind Star Wars (1977) and The Rose (1979) [108] It had a per-screen average gross of $62,234 compared to $50,919 for The Empire Strikes Back from 126 screens [134]\n\n\nBox office\nThe Shining opened on the same weekend as The Empire Strikes Back but was released on 10 screens and grossed $622,337 for the four-day weekend, the third

Empire Strikes Back from 126 screens [134]\n\n\nInitial reviews\nThe film had mixed reviews at the time of its opening in the United States [135] Janet Maslin of The New York Times lauded Nicholson's performance and praised the Overlook Hotel as an effective setting for horror, but wrote that \"the supernatural story knows frustratingly little rhyme or reason .. Even the film's most startling horrific images seem overbearing and perhaps even irrelevant.\" [136] Variety was critical, stating \"With everything to work with .. Kubrick has teamed with jumpy Jack Nicholson to destroy all that was so terrifying about Stephen King's bestseller.\" [137] A common initial criticism was the slow pacing, which was highly atypical of horror films of the time [138] Neither Gene Siskel nor Roger Ebert reviewed the film on their television show Sneak Previews when it was first released, [139] but in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Ebert complained that it was hard to connect with any of the characters [140] In his Chicago Tribune review, Siskel gave the film two stars out of four and called it \"a crashing disappointment The biggest surprise is that it contains virtually no thrills Given Kubrick's world-class reputation, one's immediate reaction is that maybe he was after something other than thrills in the film If so, it's hard to figure out what.\" [141] Vincent Misiano's review in Ares magazine concluded: \"The Shining lays open to view all the devices of horror and suspense – endless eerie music, odd camera angles, a soundtrack of interminably pounding heart, hatchets and hunts The result is shallow, self-conscious and dull Read the book.\" [142] Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote \"There are moments so visually stunning only a Kubrick could pull them off, yet the film is too grandiose to be the jolter that horror pictures are expected to be Both those expecting significance from Kubrick and those merely looking for a good scare may be equally disappointed.\" [143] Pauline Kael of The New Yorker stated \"Again and again, the movie leads us to expect something – almost promises it – and then disappoints us.\" [144] Gary Arnold of The Washington Post wrote \"Stanley Kubrick's production of The Shining, a ponderous, lackluster distillation of Stephen King's best-selling novel, looms as the Big Letdown of the new film season I can't recall a more elaborately ineffective scare movie.\" [145] Stanley Kauffmann of The New Republic described The Shining as 'laborious filmmaking' and 'a grab bag of spook stuff, with no rhyme or reason of its own' and that Nicholson's 'mouthy work here makes the late Bela Lugosi look conservative' [146]\n\n\nReappraisal\nAccording to Rotten Tomatoes, 83% of 105 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 8.6/10 The site's critical consensus reads: \"Though it deviates from Stephen King's novel, Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is a chilling, often baroque journey into madness — exemplified by an unforgettable turn from Jack Nicholson.\" [158] On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 68 out of 100 based on reviews from 26 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\" [159] Tim Cahill of Rolling Stone noted in an interview with Kubrick that by 1987 there was already a \"critical re-evaluation of  [The Shining] in process\" [160]\n\n\nResponse by Stephen King\nStephen King has been quoted as saying that although Kubrick made a film with memorable imagery, it was poor as an adaptation [181] and that it is the only adaptation of his novels that he could \"remember hating\" [182] In his 1981 nonfiction book Danse Macabre, he noted that Kubrick was among those \"filmmakers whose particular visions are so clear and fierce that .. fear of failure never becomes a factor in the equation,\" commenting that \"even when a director such as Stanley Kubrick makes such a maddening, perverse, and disappointing film as The Shining, it somehow retains a brilliance that is inarguable; it is simply there,\" and listed Kubrick's film among those he considered to have \"contributed something of value to the  [horror] genre.\" [183] Before the 1980 film, King often said he gave little attention to the film adaptations of his work [184]\n\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\n\nAmerican Film Institute recognition\nThe film differs from the novel significantly with regard to characterization and motivation of action The most obvious differences are those regarding the personality of Jack Torrance (the source of much of author Stephen King's dissatisfaction with the film) [181]\n\n\nComparison with the novel\nThe film differs from the novel significantly with regard to characterization and motivation of action The most obvious differences are those regarding the personality of Jack Torrance (the source of much of author Stephen King's dissatisfaction with the film) [181]\n\n\nMotivation of ghosts\nIn the film, the motive of the ghosts is apparently to \"reclaim\" Jack (although Grady expresses an interest in Danny's \"shining\" ability), who seems to be a reincarnation of a previous caretaker of the hotel, as suggested by the 1920s photograph of Jack at the end of the film and Jack's repeated claims to have \"not just a déjà vu\" [199] The film is more focused on Jack (as opposed to Danny) than the novel.\n\n\nRoom number\nThe room number 217 has been changed to 237 Timberline Lodge, located on Mount Hood in Oregon, was used for the aerial exterior shots of the fictional Overlook Hotel The Lodge requested that Kubrick not depict Room 217 (featured in the book) in The Shining, because future guests at the Lodge might be afraid to stay there, and a nonexistent room, 237, was substituted in the film Contrary to the hotel's expectations, Room 217 is requested more often than any other room at Timberline [200] [201]\n\n\nJack Torrance\nThe novel initially presents Jack as likable and well-intentioned, yet haunted by the demons of alcohol and authority issues Nonetheless, he becomes gradually overwhelmed by what he sees as the evil forces in the hotel.\nAt the novel's conclusion, it is suggested that the evil hotel forces have possessed Jack's body and proceeded to destroy all that is left of his mind during a final showdown with Danny He leaves a monstrous entity that Danny is able to divert while he, Wendy and Dick Hallorann escape [205]\nThe film's Jack is established as somewhat sinister much earlier in the story and dies in a different manner Jack kills Dick Hallorann in the film, but only wounds him in the novel King attempted to talk Stanley Kubrick out of casting Jack Nicholson even before filming began, on the grounds that he seemed vaguely sinister from the very beginning of the film [c] [207]\n\n\nDanny Torrance\nDanny Torrance is considerably more open about his supernatural abilities in the novel, discussing them with strangers such as his doctor [213] In the film, he is quite secretive about them even with his prime mentor Dick Hallorann, who also has these abilities The same is true of Dick Hallorann, who in his journey back to the Overlook in the book, talks with others with the \"shining\" ability, while in the film he lies about his reason for returning to the Overlook Danny in the novel is generally portrayed as unusually intelligent across the board [214] In the film, he is more ordinary, though with a preternatural gift.\n\n\nWendy Torrance\nWendy Torrance in the film is relatively meek, submissive, passive, gentle, and mousy; this is shown by the way she defends Jack even in his absence to the doctor examining Danny In the novel, she is a far more self-reliant and independent personality, who is tied to Jack in part by her poor relationship with her parents [216] In the novel, she never displays hysteria or collapses the way she does in the film, but remains cool and self-reliant Writing in Hollywood's Stephen King, author Tony Magistrale writes about the mini-series remake:\n\n\nStuart Ullman\nIn the novel, Jack's interviewer, Ullman, is highly authoritarian, a kind of snobbish martinet The film's Ullman is far more humane and concerned about Jack's well-being, as well as smooth and self-assured Only in the novel does Ullman state that he disapproves of hiring Jack but higher authorities have asked that Jack be hired [219] Ullman's bossy nature in the novel is one of the first steps in Jack's deterioration, whereas in the film, Ullman serves largely as an expositor.\n\n\nFamily dynamics\nStephen King provides the reader with a great deal of information about the stress in the Torrance family early in the story, [222] including revelations of Jack's physical abuse of Danny and Wendy's fear of Danny's mysterious spells Kubrick tones down the early family tension and reveals family disharmony much more gradually than does King In the film, Danny has a stronger emotional bond with Wendy than with Jack, which fuels Jack's rather paranoid notion that the two are conspiring against him The exact opposite is true in the book, where Wendy occasionally experiences jealousy at the fact that Danny clearly prefers Jack to her.\n\n\nPlot differences\nIn the novel Jack recovers his sanity and goodwill through the intervention of Danny; this does not occur in the film Writing in Cinefantastique magazine, Frederick Clarke suggests, \"Instead of playing a normal man who becomes insane, Nicholson portrays a crazy man attempting to remain sane.\" [223] In the novel, Jack's final act is to enable Wendy and Danny to escape the hotel before it explodes due to a defective boiler, killing him [224] The film ends with the hotel still standing More broadly, the defective boiler is a major element of the novel's plot, entirely missing from the film version.\n\n\nFilm adaptation commentary\nAlthough Stephen King fans were critical of the novel's adaptation on the grounds that Kubrick altered and reduced the novel's themes, a defense of Kubrick's approach was made in Steve Biodrowski's review of the film [231] He argues that as in earlier films, Kubrick stripped out the back story of the film, reducing it to a \"basic narrative line\", making the characters more like archetypes.\nHis review of the film is one of the few to go into detailed comparison with the novel He writes, \"The result ..  [is] a brilliant, ambitious attempt to shoot a horror film without the Gothic trappings of shadows and cobwebs so often associated with the genre.\"\n\n\nInfluence in popular culture\nBoth parodies and homages to The Shining are prominent in UK and U.S popular culture, particularly in films, TV shows, video games and music [232] [233] [234] [235] Images and scenes including the Grady girls in the hallway, the word \"Redrum\", the blood spilling out of the elevator doors [236] and Jack sticking his head through the hole in the bathroom door, saying, \"Here's Johnny\", are frequently referenced in the media.\n\n\nSequel and spin-off\nIn 2014, Warner Bros Pictures began developing a film adaptation of Doctor Sleep (2013), Stephen King's sequel to his book, The Shining (1977) [266] In 2016, Akiva Goldsman announced that he would write and produce the film for Warner Bros [267] For several years, Warner Brothers could not secure a budget for the sequel nor for a prequel to The Shining to be called Overlook Hotel [268]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "The Shining is a 1980 psychological horror film directed by Stanley Kubrick, based on the 1977 novel of the same name by Stephen King. The film stars Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd, and Scatman Crothers, and follows the story of a writer who becomes caretaker of the isolated Overlook Hotel in Colorado, only to find himself haunted by the hotel's dark past and supernatural forces.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film begins with Jack Torrance, a writer and former teacher, being offered a position as the winter caretaker of the Overlook Hotel in Colorado. Jack, who is struggling with writer's block and a troubled past, sees this as an opportunity to overcome his demons and start anew. He brings his wife Wendy and their son Danny, who possesses a special psychic ability known as \"the shine,\" to the hotel.\n\nUpon arrival, Jack, Wendy, and Danny are greeted by the manager, Stuart Ullman, who warns them about the hotel's dark history and the previous caretaker, Charles Grady, who killed his family and himself in 1970. However, Jack is not deterred and sees the hotel as a place to escape his problems and find inspiration for his writing.\n\nAs the winter months progress, Jack's behavior becomes increasingly erratic, and he begins to experience supernatural visions and hallucinations. He becomes convinced that the hotel is haunted by the ghosts of former guests and employees, and he starts to lose his grip on reality.\n\nMeanwhile, Danny begins to experience terrifying visions and is haunted by the ghosts of the hotel. He confides in Dick Hallorann, the hotel's chef, who also possesses the shine and tries to help Danny understand his abilities.\n\nAs the hotel's supernatural forces grow stronger, Jack's behavior becomes more and more erratic, and he becomes a danger to his family. In a climactic finale, Jack's possessed body is revealed, and he attacks Wendy and Danny, trying to kill them.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance\n* Shelley Duvall as Wendy Torrance\n* Danny Lloyd as Danny Torrance\n* Scatman Crothers as Dick Hallorann\n* Barry Nelson as Stuart Ullman\n* Philip Stone as Delbert Grady\n* Joe Turkel as Lloyd\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe Shining has been interpreted in many ways, including as a commentary on the crisis in masculinity, sexism, corporate America, and racism. The film has also been seen as a critique of the idea of the American Dream, which is represented by the Overlook Hotel.\n\nThe film's use of symbolism and imagery is also significant, with the hotel representing a microcosm of American society. The hotel's interior, with its labyrinthine corridors and maze-like layout, is a representation of the complexities and contradictions of American culture.\n\nThe character of Jack Torrance is also significant, representing a classic case of a man who is struggling with the pressures of modern life and the expectations of society. His descent into madness is a representation of the fragility of the human psyche and the dangers of ignoring one's inner demons.\n\n**Native Americans**\n\nAmong interpreters who see the film reflecting more subtly the social concerns that animate other Kubrick films, one of the early viewpoints was discussed in an essay by ABC reporter Bill Blakemore titled \"Kubrick's 'Shining' Secret: Film's Hidden Horror Is The Murder of the Indian.\" Blakemore believes that indirect references to American killings of Native Americans pervade the film, as exemplified by the Amerindian logos on the baking powder in the kitchen and the Amerindian artwork that appears throughout the hotel.\n\n**Geoffrey Cocks and Kubrick's concern with the Holocaust**\n\nFilm historian Geoffrey Cocks has extended Blakemore's idea that the film has a subtext about Native Americans by arguing that the film indirectly reflects Stanley Kubrick's concerns about the Holocaust. Cocks, writing in his book The Wolf at the Door: Stanley Kubrick, History and the Holocaust, proposed a controversial theory that all of Kubrick's work is informed by the Holocaust.\n\n**Literary allusions**\n\nThe film contains many allusions to fairy-tales, including Hansel and Gretel and the Three Little Pigs. The character of Jack Torrance is identified as the Big Bad Wolf, which Bruno Bettelheim interprets as standing for \"all the asocial unconscious devouring powers\" that must be overcome by a child's ego.\n\n**Artworks in the film**\n\nNumerous paintings and sculptures appear throughout the film, including works by Group of Seven artists. The film's use of art is significant, with the artworks serving as a representation of the hotel's past and the characters' experiences.\n\n**Ambiguities in the film**\n\nThe film's use of ambiguity is also significant, with the audience left to interpret the meaning of the film's events and symbolism. The film's ending, in particular, is open to interpretation, with some seeing it as a representation of the cyclical nature of life and others seeing it as a commentary on the idea of the American Dream.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe film received mixed reviews at the time of its release, with some critics praising its visuals and performances, while others found it to be slow and confusing. However, over the years, the film has developed a cult following and is now widely regarded as a classic of horror cinema.\n\n**Comparison with the novel**\n\nThe film differs from the novel in several significant ways, including the characterization of Jack Torrance and the motivations of the ghosts. The film's Jack is more sinister and erratic than the novel's Jack, and the ghosts' motivations are more ambiguous.\n\n**Influence in popular culture**\n\nThe Shining has had a significant influence on popular culture, with references to the film appearing in everything from music and film to literature and advertising. The film's imagery, including the Grady girls in the hallway and the word \"Redrum,\" has become iconic and is widely recognizable.\n\n**Sequel and spin-off**\n\nIn 2014, Warner Bros Pictures began developing a film adaptation of Doctor Sleep, Stephen King's sequel to his book, The Shining. The film, directed by Mike Flanagan, was released in 2019 and received positive reviews.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Stanley Kubrick\n* Stephen King\n* The Shining (novel)\n* Doctor Sleep\n* Horror cinema\n* Cinema of the United States\n\n**Notes**\n\n1.

conventional business deal that places commercial obligation .. over the unspoken contract of compassion and empathy that he seems to have neglected to sign with his family.\" [17]\n\n\nNative Americans\nAmong interpreters who see the film reflecting more subtly the social concerns that animate other Kubrick films, one of the early viewpoints was discussed in an essay by ABC reporter Bill Blakemore titled \"Kubrick's 'Shining' Secret: Film's Hidden Horror Is The Murder of the Indian\", first published in The Washington Post on July 12, 1987 [18] [a] He believes that indirect references to American killings of Native Americans pervade the film, as exemplified by the Amerindian logos on the baking powder in the kitchen and the Amerindian artwork that appears throughout the hotel, though no Native Americans are seen Stuart Ullman tells Wendy that when building the hotel, a few Indian attacks had to be fended off since it was constructed on an Indian burial ground [18]\n\n\nGeoffrey Cocks and Kubrick's concern with the Holocaust\nFilm historian Geoffrey Cocks has extended Blakemore's idea that the film has a subtext about Native Americans by arguing that the film indirectly reflects Stanley Kubrick's concerns about the Holocaust (both Cocks's book and Michael Herr's memoir of Kubrick discuss how he wanted his entire life to make a film dealing directly with the Holocaust but could never quite make up his mind) Cocks, writing in his book The Wolf at the Door: Stanley Kubrick, History and the Holocaust, proposed a controversial theory that all of Kubrick's work is informed by the Holocaust; there is, he says, a holocaust subtext in The Shining This, Cocks believes, is why Kubrick's screenplay goes to emotional extremes, omitting much of the novel's supernaturalism and making the character of Wendy much more hysteria-prone [22] Cocks places Kubrick's vision of a haunted hotel in line with a long literary tradition of hotels in which sinister events occur, from Stephen Crane's short story \"The Blue Hotel\" (which Kubrick admired) to the Swiss Berghof in Thomas Mann's novel The Magic Mountain, about a snowbound sanatorium high in the Swiss Alps in which the protagonist witnesses a series of events which are a microcosm of the decline of Western culture [23]\n\n\nLiterary allusions\nGeoffrey Cocks notes that the film contains many allusions to fairy-tales, both Hansel and Gretel and the Three Little Pigs, [22] with Jack Torrance identified as the Big Bad Wolf, which Bruno Bettelheim interprets as standing for \"all the asocial unconscious devouring powers\" that must be overcome by a child's ego.\n\n\nArtworks in the film\nNumerous paintings and sculptures appear throughout the film Several paintings by Group of Seven artists appear including The Solemn Land (1921) by J E H MacDonald, Northern River (1914) by Tom Thomson, Stormy Weather, Georgian Bay (1921) by Frederick Varley, Red Maple (1914) by A Y Jackson, Mist Fantasy, Sand River, Algoma (1920) by J.E.H MacDonald, Maligne Lake, Jasper Park (1924) by Lawren Harris, Beaver Swamp (1920) by Lawren Harris, and Arpeggio (1932) by Frederick Varley [28] Two paintings by Indigenous Canadian artist Norval Morrisseau can be seen in the film including The Great Earth Mother (1976), and Flock of Loons (1975)––Morriseau was part of the Professional Native Indian Artists Inc (PNIAI) which came to be informally known as the \"Indian Group of Seven\" [29] [21] [30]\n\n\nAmbiguities in the film\nRoger Ebert notes that the film does not really have a \"reliable observer\", with the possible exception of Dick Hallorann Ebert believes various events call into question the reliability of Jack, Wendy and Danny [40] This leads Ebert to conclude that:\n\n\nGhosts versus cabin fever\nIn some sequences, there is a question of whether or not there are ghosts present In the scenes where Jack sees ghosts, he is always facing a mirror or, in the case of his storeroom conversation with Grady, a reflective, highly polished door Film reviewer James Berardinelli notes \"It has been pointed out that there's a mirror in every scene in which Jack sees a ghost, causing us to wonder whether the spirits are reflections of a tortured psyche.\" [42]\nIn Hollywood's Stephen King, Tony Magistrale wrote,\n\n\nTwo Gradys and other doubles\nEarly in the film, Stuart Ullman tells Jack of a previous caretaker, Charles Grady, who, in 1970, succumbed to cabin fever, murdered his family and then killed himself Later, Jack meets a ghostly butler named Grady Jack says that he knows about the murders, claiming to recognize Grady from pictures, but the butler introduces himself as Delbert Grady.\n\n\nPhotograph\nAt the end of the film, the camera moves slowly toward a wall in the Overlook and a 1921 photograph, revealed to include Jack seen at the middle of a July 4, 1921, party In an interview with Michel Ciment, Kubrick said that the photograph suggests that Jack was a reincarnation of an earlier official at the hotel [47] This has not stopped alternative readings, such as that Jack has been \"absorbed\" into the Overlook Hotel Film critic Jonathan Romney, while acknowledging the absorption theory, wrote:\n\n\nSpatial layout of the Overlook Hotel\nScreenwriter Todd Alcott has noted:\n\n\nProduction\nBefore making The Shining, Kubrick directed the film Barry Lyndon (1975), a highly visual period film about an Irishman who attempts to make his way into the British aristocracy Despite its technical achievements, the film was not a box-office success in the United States and was derided by critics for being too long and too slow Kubrick, disappointed with Barry Lyndon's lack of success, realized he needed to make a film that would be commercially viable as well as artistically fulfilling Stephen King was told that Kubrick had his staff bring him stacks of horror books as he planted himself in his office to read them all: \"Kubrick's secretary heard the sound of each book hitting the wall as the director flung it into a reject pile after reading the first few pages Finally, one day the secretary noticed it had been a while since she had heard the thud of another writer's work biting the dust She walked in to check on her boss and found Kubrick deeply engrossed in reading a copy of the manuscript of The Shining\" [55]\n\n\nGenesis\nBefore making The Shining, Kubrick directed the film Barry Lyndon (1975), a highly visual period film about an Irishman who attempts to make his way into the British

deeply engrossed in reading a copy of the manuscript of The Shining\" [55]\n\n\nCasting\nNicholson was Kubrick's first choice for the role of Jack Torrance; other actors considered included Robert De Niro (who said the film gave him nightmares for a month), [57] Robin Williams, and Harrison Ford, all of whom met with Stephen King's disapproval [58] Kris Kristofferson was Kubrick's backup choice if Nicholson had declined [59] King, for his part, disavowed Nicholson because he thought that, since his part in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, the viewer would tend to consider him an unstable individual from the beginning For this reason, King preferred Jon Voight, Michael Moriarty, or Martin Sheen for the role, who would more faithfully represent the profile of the ordinary individual who is gradually driven to madness [60] [61] In any case, from the beginning the writer was told that the actor for the lead role \"was not negotiable.\" [62] [63]\n\n\nFilming\nMain photography began in May 1978 and wrapped in July 1979, it took place mainly in Elstree Studios, in southern England.\n\n\nInterior sets\nHaving chosen King's novel as a basis for his next project, and after a pre-production phase, Kubrick had sets constructed on soundstages at EMI Elstree Studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, England Some of the interior designs of the Overlook Hotel set were based on those of the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National Park To enable him to shoot the scenes in loose chronological order, he used several stages at EMI Elstree Studios in order to make all sets available during the complete duration of production The set for the Overlook Hotel was at the time the largest ever built at Elstree, including a life-size re-creation of the exterior of the hotel [70] In February 1979, the Colorado Lounge set at Elstree was badly damaged in a fire, causing a delay in the production [71] [72] [73]\n\n\nExterior locations\nWhile most of the film was shot on interior sets and the full-scale exterior facade replica at Elstree Studios, a second-unit crew headed by Jan Harlan shot some sequences on location in the American West Saint Mary Lake and its Wild Goose Island in Glacier National Park, Montana were featured in the aerial shots of the opening scenes, with the Volkswagen Beetle driving along Going-to-the-Sun Road The Timberline Lodge on Mount Hood in Oregon was filmed for a few of the establishing shots of the fictional Overlook Hotel; absent in these shots is the hedge maze, which the real Timberline Lodge does not have The Ahwahnee Hotel (the Overlook Hotel's main interior reference) and the Timberline Lodge (the hotel's main exterior) were both designed by architect Gilbert Stanley Underwood, in the 1920s and 1930s respectively [74]\n\n\nWriting\nIn 1977, a Warner Bros executive, John Calley, sent Kubrick the proofs of what would become the novel [76] Its author, Stephen King, was already at that time a best-selling author who, after the blockbuster of Carrie, could boast of successes in adaptations for the big screen For his part, Kubrick had been considering directing a horror film for some time; a few years before, while Barry Lyndon disappointed at the box office, [77] another Warner film he had refused to direct, The Exorcist, [78] directed by William Friedkin, was breaking box office records around the world.\n\n\nPhotography\nThe Shining had a very prolonged and arduous production period, often with very long workdays Principal photography took over a year to complete, due to Kubrick's highly methodical nature Actress Shelley Duvall frequently argued with Kubrick on set about lines in the script and her acting techniques [65] Nicholson was living in London with his then-girlfriend Anjelica Huston and her younger sister, Allegra, who testified to his long shooting days [85] Joe Turkel stated in a 2014 interview that they rehearsed the \"bar scene\" for six weeks and that the shoot day lasted from 9 a.m to 10:30 p.m., with Turkel recollecting that his clothes were soaked in perspiration by the end of the day's shoot He also described it as his favorite scene in the film [86]\n\n\nSteadicam\nThe Shining was among the early half-dozen films (after the films Bound for Glory, Marathon Man, and Rocky, all released in 1976), to use the newly developed Steadicam, [96] [97] a stabilizing mount for a motion picture camera, which mechanically separates the operator's movement from the camera's, allowing smooth tracking shots while the operator is moving over an uneven surface It essentially combines the stabilized steady footage of a regular mount with the fluidity and flexibility of a handheld camera The inventor of the Steadicam, Garrett Brown, was heavily involved with the production of The Shining Brown has described his excitement taking his first tour of the sets, which offered \"further possibilities for the Steadicam\" This tour convinced Brown to become personally involved with the production Kubrick was not \"just talking of stunt shots and staircases\" Rather he would use the Steadicam \"as it was intended to be used — as a tool which can help get the lens where it's wanted in space and time without the classic limitations of the dolly and crane\" Brown used an 18 mm Cooke lens that allowed the Steadicam to pass within an inch of walls and door frames [98] Brown published an article in American Cinematographer about his experience, [99] and contributed to the audio commentary on the 2007 DVD release.\n\n\nMusic and soundtrack\nThe stylistically modernist art-music chosen by Kubrick is similar to the repertoire he first explored in 2001: A Space Odyssey Although the repertoire was selected by Kubrick, the process of matching passages of music to motion picture was left almost entirely at the discretion of music editor Gordon Stainforth, whose work on this film is known for attention to fine details and remarkably precise synchronization without excessive splicing [101]\n\n\nRelease\nUnlike Kubrick's previous works, which developed audiences gradually through word-of-mouth, The Shining initially opened on 10 screens in New York City and Los Angeles on the Memorial Day weekend, then was released as a mass-market film nationwide within a month [107] [108] [109] The European release of The Shining a few months later was 25 minutes shorter due to Kubrick's removal of most of the scenes taking place outside the environs of the hotel.\n\n\nPost-release edit\n\nAfter its premiere and a week into the general run (with a running time of 146 minutes), Kubrick cut a scene at the end that took place in a hospital The scene shows Wendy in a bed talking with Mr Ullman, who explains that Jack's body could not be found; he then gives Danny a yellow tennis ball, presumably the same one that Jack was throwing around the hotel This scene was subsequently physically cut out of prints by projectionists and sent back to the studio by order of Warner Bros., the film's distributor This cut the film's running time to 144 minutes Roger Ebert commented: \n\nEuropean version\nFor its release in Europe, Kubrick cut about 25 minutes from the film [112] [113] [114] The excised scenes included: a longer meeting between Jack and Watson at the hotel; Danny being attended by a doctor (Anne Jackson), including references to Tony and how Jack once injured Danny in a drunken rage; more footage of Hallorann's attempts to get to the hotel during the snowstorm, including a sequence with a garage attendant (Tony Burton); extended dialogue scenes at the hotel; and a scene where Wendy discovers a group of skeletons in the hotel lobby during the climax Jackson and Burton are credited in the European print, despite their scenes having been excised from the movie According to Harlan, Kubrick decided to cut some sequences because the film was \"not very well received\", and also after Warner Brothers had complained about its ambiguity and length [115]\n\n\nHome media\nThe U.S network television premiere of The Shining (on ABC's Friday Night Movie of May 6, 1983) [117] started with a placard saying, \"Tonight's Film Deals With the Supernatural, As a Possessed Man Attempts to Destroy His Family.\" [118] With the movie's ambiguities, it is not known how Kubrick felt about or if he agreed with this proclamation The placard also said that the film was edited for television and warned about the content [116]\n\n\nAd campaigns\nVarious theatrical posters were used during the original 1980–1981 international release cycle, [121] [122] [123] [124] [125] but in the U.S., where the film first opened, the primary poster and newspaper advert was designed by noted Hollywood graphic designer Saul Bass [122] [126] [127] [128] [129] [130] Bass and Kubrick reportedly went through over 300 potential designs before settling on the final design of an unsettling, angry-looking, underlit, pointillistic doll-like face (which does not appear in the film) peering through the letters \"The\", with \"SHiNiNG\" below, in smaller letters At the top of the poster are the words \"A MASTERPIECE OF MODERN HORROR\", with the credits and other information at the bottom [122] [129] [130]\n\n\n4K version\nTurner Classic Movies and Fathom Events had a limited screening in October 2016 in 2K and 4K resolution [131]\n\n\nReception\nThe Shining opened on the same weekend as The Empire Strikes Back but was released on 10 screens and grossed $622,337 for the four-day weekend, the third highest-grossing opening weekend from fewer than 50 screens of all time, behind Star Wars (1977) and The Rose (1979) [108] It had a per-screen average gross of $62,234 compared to $50,919 for The Empire Strikes Back from 126 screens [134]\n\n\nBox office\nThe Shining opened on the same weekend as The Empire Strikes Back but was released on 10 screens and grossed $622,337 for the four-day weekend, the third

Empire Strikes Back from 126 screens [134]\n\n\nInitial reviews\nThe film had mixed reviews at the time of its opening in the United States [135] Janet Maslin of The New York Times lauded Nicholson's performance and praised the Overlook Hotel as an effective setting for horror, but wrote that \"the supernatural story knows frustratingly little rhyme or reason .. Even the film's most startling horrific images seem overbearing and perhaps even irrelevant.\" [136] Variety was critical, stating \"With everything to work with .. Kubrick has teamed with jumpy Jack Nicholson to destroy all that was so terrifying about Stephen King's bestseller.\" [137] A common initial criticism was the slow pacing, which was highly atypical of horror films of the time [138] Neither Gene Siskel nor Roger Ebert reviewed the film on their television show Sneak Previews when it was first released, [139] but in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Ebert complained that it was hard to connect with any of the characters [140] In his Chicago Tribune review, Siskel gave the film two stars out of four and called it \"a crashing disappointment The biggest surprise is that it contains virtually no thrills Given Kubrick's world-class reputation, one's immediate reaction is that maybe he was after something other than thrills in the film If so, it's hard to figure out what.\" [141] Vincent Misiano's review in Ares magazine concluded: \"The Shining lays open to view all the devices of horror and suspense – endless eerie music, odd camera angles, a soundtrack of interminably pounding heart, hatchets and hunts The result is shallow, self-conscious and dull Read the book.\" [142] Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote \"There are moments so visually stunning only a Kubrick could pull them off, yet the film is too grandiose to be the jolter that horror pictures are expected to be Both those expecting significance from Kubrick and those merely looking for a good scare may be equally disappointed.\" [143] Pauline Kael of The New Yorker stated \"Again and again, the movie leads us to expect something – almost promises it – and then disappoints us.\" [144] Gary Arnold of The Washington Post wrote \"Stanley Kubrick's production of The Shining, a ponderous, lackluster distillation of Stephen King's best-selling novel, looms as the Big Letdown of the new film season I can't recall a more elaborately ineffective scare movie.\" [145] Stanley Kauffmann of The New Republic described The Shining as 'laborious filmmaking' and 'a grab bag of spook stuff, with no rhyme or reason of its own' and that Nicholson's 'mouthy work here makes the late Bela Lugosi look conservative' [146]\n\n\nReappraisal\nAccording to Rotten Tomatoes, 83% of 105 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 8.6/10 The site's critical consensus reads: \"Though it deviates from Stephen King's novel, Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is a chilling, often baroque journey into madness — exemplified by an unforgettable turn from Jack Nicholson.\" [158] On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 68 out of 100 based on reviews from 26 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\" [159] Tim Cahill of Rolling Stone noted in an interview with Kubrick that by 1987 there was already a \"critical re-evaluation of  [The Shining] in process\" [160]\n\n\nResponse by Stephen King\nStephen King has been quoted as saying that although Kubrick made a film with memorable imagery, it was poor as an adaptation [181] and that it is the only adaptation of his novels that he could \"remember hating\" [182] In his 1981 nonfiction book Danse Macabre, he noted that Kubrick was among those \"filmmakers whose particular visions are so clear and fierce that .. fear of failure never becomes a factor in the equation,\" commenting that \"even when a director such as Stanley Kubrick makes such a maddening, perverse, and disappointing film as The Shining, it somehow retains a brilliance that is inarguable; it is simply there,\" and listed Kubrick's film among those he considered to have \"contributed something of value to the  [horror] genre.\" [183] Before the 1980 film, King often said he gave little attention to the film adaptations of his work [184]\n\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\n\nAmerican Film Institute recognition\nThe film differs from the novel significantly with regard to characterization and motivation of action The most obvious differences are those regarding the personality of Jack Torrance (the source of much of author Stephen King's dissatisfaction with the film) [181]\n\n\nComparison with the novel\nThe film differs from the novel significantly with regard to characterization and motivation of action The most obvious differences are those regarding the personality of Jack Torrance (the source of much of author Stephen King's dissatisfaction with the film) [181]\n\n\nMotivation of ghosts\nIn the film, the motive of the ghosts is apparently to \"reclaim\" Jack (although Grady expresses an interest in Danny's \"shining\" ability), who seems to be a reincarnation of a previous caretaker of the hotel, as suggested by the 1920s photograph of Jack at the end of the film and Jack's repeated claims to have \"not just a déjà vu\" [199] The film is more focused on Jack (as opposed to Danny) than the novel.\n\n\nRoom number\nThe room number 217 has been changed to 237 Timberline Lodge, located on Mount Hood in Oregon, was used for the aerial exterior shots of the fictional Overlook Hotel The Lodge requested that Kubrick not depict Room 217 (featured in the book) in The Shining, because future guests at the Lodge might be afraid to stay there, and a nonexistent room, 237, was substituted in the film Contrary to the hotel's expectations, Room 217 is requested more often than any other room at Timberline [200] [201]\n\n\nJack Torrance\nThe novel initially presents Jack as likable and well-intentioned, yet haunted by the demons of alcohol and authority issues Nonetheless, he becomes gradually overwhelmed by what he sees as the evil forces in the hotel.\nAt the novel's conclusion, it is suggested that the evil hotel forces have possessed Jack's body and proceeded to destroy all that is left of his mind during a final showdown with Danny He leaves a monstrous entity that Danny is able to divert while he, Wendy and Dick Hallorann escape [205]\nThe film's Jack is established as somewhat sinister much earlier in the story and dies in a different manner Jack kills Dick Hallorann in the film, but only wounds him in the novel King attempted to talk Stanley Kubrick out of casting Jack Nicholson even before filming began, on the grounds that he seemed vaguely sinister from the very beginning of the film [c] [207]\n\n\nDanny Torrance\nDanny Torrance is considerably more open about his supernatural abilities in the novel, discussing them with strangers such as his doctor [213] In the film, he is quite secretive about them even with his prime mentor Dick Hallorann, who also has these abilities The same is true of Dick Hallorann, who in his journey back to the Overlook in the book, talks with others with the \"shining\" ability, while in the film he lies about his reason for returning to the Overlook Danny in the novel is generally portrayed as unusually intelligent across the board [214] In the film, he is more ordinary, though with a preternatural gift.\n\n\nWendy Torrance\nWendy Torrance in the film is relatively meek, submissive, passive, gentle, and mousy; this is shown by the way she defends Jack even in his absence to the doctor examining Danny In the novel, she is a far more self-reliant and independent personality, who is tied to Jack in part by her poor relationship with her parents [216] In the novel, she never displays hysteria or collapses the way she does in the film, but remains cool and self-reliant Writing in Hollywood's Stephen King, author Tony Magistrale writes about the mini-series remake:\n\n\nStuart Ullman\nIn the novel, Jack's interviewer, Ullman, is highly authoritarian, a kind of snobbish martinet The film's Ullman is far more humane and concerned about Jack's well-being, as well as smooth and self-assured Only in the novel does Ullman state that he disapproves of hiring Jack but higher authorities have asked that Jack be hired [219] Ullman's bossy nature in the novel is one of the first steps in Jack's deterioration, whereas in the film, Ullman serves largely as an expositor.\n\n\nFamily dynamics\nStephen King provides the reader with a great deal of information about the stress in the Torrance family early in the story, [222] including revelations of Jack's physical abuse of Danny and Wendy's fear of Danny's mysterious spells Kubrick tones down the early family tension and reveals family disharmony much more gradually than does King In the film, Danny has a stronger emotional bond with Wendy than with Jack, which fuels Jack's rather paranoid notion that the two are conspiring against him The exact opposite is true in the book, where Wendy occasionally experiences jealousy at the fact that Danny clearly prefers Jack to her.\n\n\nPlot differences\nIn the novel Jack recovers his sanity and goodwill through the intervention of Danny; this does not occur in the film Writing in Cinefantastique magazine, Frederick Clarke suggests, \"Instead of playing a normal man who becomes insane, Nicholson portrays a crazy man attempting to remain sane.\" [223] In the novel, Jack's final act is to enable Wendy and Danny to escape the hotel before it explodes due to a defective boiler, killing him [224] The film ends with the hotel still standing More broadly, the defective boiler is a major element of the novel's plot, entirely missing from the film version.\n\n\nFilm adaptation commentary\nAlthough Stephen King fans were critical of the novel's adaptation on the grounds that Kubrick altered and reduced the novel's themes, a defense of Kubrick's approach was made in Steve Biodrowski's review of the film [231] He argues that as in earlier films, Kubrick stripped out the back story of the film, reducing it to a \"basic narrative line\", making the characters more like archetypes.\nHis review of the film is one of the few to go into detailed comparison with the novel He writes, \"The result ..  [is] a brilliant, ambitious attempt to shoot a horror film without the Gothic trappings of shadows and cobwebs so often associated with the genre.\"\n\n\nInfluence in popular culture\nBoth parodies and homages to The Shining are prominent in UK and U.S popular culture, particularly in films, TV shows, video games and music [232] [233] [234] [235] Images and scenes including the Grady girls in the hallway, the word \"Redrum\", the blood spilling out of the elevator doors [236] and Jack sticking his head through the hole in the bathroom door, saying, \"Here's Johnny\", are frequently referenced in the media.\n\n\nSequel and spin-off\nIn 2014, Warner Bros Pictures began developing a film adaptation of Doctor Sleep (2013), Stephen King's sequel to his book, The Shining (1977) [266] In 2016, Akiva Goldsman announced that he would write and produce the film for Warner Bros [267] For several years, Warner Brothers could not secure a budget for the sequel nor for a prequel to The Shining to be called Overlook Hotel [268]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

beverages Most Christian denominations observe the tradition of Lent; exceptions include many churches within the Anabaptist, Baptist, Methodist, and Reformed traditions [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Shrovetide provided Christians with the opportunity to use up these foods prior to the start of the 40-day fasting season of Lent [11] [12] [13] Prior to the 6th century, Lent was normatively observed through the practice of the Black Fast, which enjoins fasting from food and liquids, with the allowance of one vegetarian meal and water after sunset [12] [13] The tradition of pancake breakfasts during Shrovetide, as well as that of pancake races, owes itself to this practice of \"using up the surplus eggs, milk and butter\" prior to Lent [11] [14] In many Christian parish churches, both Protestant and Roman Catholic, a popular Shrove Tuesday tradition is the ringing of the church bells (on this day, the toll is known as the Shriving Bell) \"to call the faithful to confession before the solemn season of Lent\" and for people to \"begin frying their pancakes\" [15] [16] [17] As such, a hallmark of Shrovetide is the opportunity for a last round of merrymaking associated with Mardis Gras before the start of the somber Lenten season [18] [19] [4] The last day of Shrovetide, Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday), is named as such \"because people felt bloated having eaten up all the rich foods before Lent\" in order to prepare for the coming season of repentance [4]\n\n\nTraditions\nThe festival season varies from city to city; Mardis Gras often refers to the last day of Shrovetide (or Fastelavn or Carnival), thus being synonymous with Shrove Tuesday [4] Some traditions, such as the one in New Orleans, Louisiana, consider Mardi Gras to stretch the entire period from Twelfth Night (the last night of Christmas which begins Epiphany) to Ash Wednesday [20] [21] Others treat the final three-day period before Ash Wednesday as the Mardi Gras [22]\n\n\nBelgium\nThe three-day Carnival of Binche, near Mons, is one of the best known in Belgium It takes place around Shrove Tuesday (or Mardi Gras) just before Lent Performers known as Gilles wear elaborate costumes in the national colours of red, black and yellow During the parade, they throw oranges at the crowd [24] In 2003, it was recognized by UNESCO as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity [25]\n\n\nCzech Republic\nIn the Czech Republic, it is a folk tradition to celebrate Mardi Gras, which is called Masopust (meat-fast, i.e beginning of the fast there) There are celebrations in many places including Prague, [26] but the tradition also prevails in villages such as Staré Hamry, whose door-to-door processions made it to the UNESCO World Intangible Cultural Heritage List [27]\n\n\nGermany\nThe celebration on the same day in Germany knows many different terms, depending on the region, such as Fastnacht, meaning the eve of the fast that takes place during Lent, or Veilchensdienstag (Violet Tuesday), as it is called in the Lower Rhine region The celebrations often stretch from Epiphany, known in sections of Germany as Heilige Drei Könige, through the night before Ash Wednesday, and is variously known by different names, such as Karneval or Fasching in Germany, Austria and German-speaking areas of Switzerland  It is also often referred to as the \"fifth season\", which traditionally begins with Hoppeditz Erwachen (the waking of Hoppeditz, the Fool who embodies the Karneval season) on 11 November at 11:11 AM (11/11 11:11) [citation needed] and ends with his comic funeral mass on Fastnacht.\n\n\nItaly\nIn Italy Mardi Gras is called Martedì Grasso (Fat Tuesday)  It is the main day of Carnival along with the Thursday before, called Giovedí Grasso (Fat Thursday), which ratifies the start of the celebrations The most famous Carnivals in northern Italy are in Venice, Viareggio and Ivrea, while in the southern part of Italy the Sardinian Sartiglia and the intriguing apotropaic masks, especially the mamuthones, issohadores, s'urtzu (and so on), are more popular, belonging to a very ancient tradition Ivrea has the characteristic \"Battle of Oranges\" that finds its roots in medieval times  The Italian version of the festival is spelled Carnevale [29]\n\n\nSweden\nIn Sweden the celebration is called Fettisdagen, when fastlagsbulle is eaten, more commonly called Semla The name comes from the words \"fett\" (fat) and \"tisdag\" (Tuesday) Originally, this was the only day one should eat fastlagsbullar [30]\n\n\nUnited States\nWhile not observed nationally throughout the United States, a number of historically ethnically French cities and regions in the country have notable celebrations Mardi Gras arrived in North America as a French Catholic tradition with the Le Moyne brothers, [31] Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville and Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville, in the late 17th century, when King Louis XIV sent the pair to defend France's claim on the territory of Louisiane, which included what are now the U.S states of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and part of eastern Texas [31]\n\n\nCostumes\nMardi Gras, as a celebration of life before the more-somber occasion of Ash Wednesday, nearly always involves the use of masks and costumes by its participants, and the most popular celebratory colors are purple, green, and gold  In New Orleans, for example, these often take the shape of fairies, animals, people from myths, or various Medieval costumes [42] as well as clowns and Indians (Native Americans) [43]\n\n\nExposure by women\nAlthough the Church teaches that it is sinful and that it contravenes the Christian standards of modesty, [45] [46] the practice of some women exposing their breasts during Mardi Gras in New Orleans, US, has been documented since 1889, when the Times-Democrat decried the \"degree of immodesty exhibited by nearly all female masqueraders seen on the streets.\" The practice was mostly limited to tourists in the upper Bourbon Street area [47] [48] In the crowded streets of the French Quarter, generally avoided by locals on Mardi Gras Day, flashers on balconies cause crowds to form on the streets [citation needed]\n\n\nSee also\n(federal) = federal holidays, (abbreviation) = state/territorial holidays, (religious) = religious holidays, (cultural) = holiday related to a specific

the start of the celebrations The most famous Carnivals in northern Italy are in Venice, Viareggio and Ivrea, while in the southern part of Italy the Sardinian Sartiglia and the intriguing apotropaic masks, especially the mamuthones, issohadores, s'urtzu (and so on), are more popular, belonging to a very ancient tradition Ivrea has the characteristic \"Battle of Oranges\" that finds its roots in medieval times  The Italian version of the festival is spelled Carnevale [29]\n\n\nSweden\nIn Sweden the celebration is called Fettisdagen, when fastlagsbulle is eaten, more commonly called Semla The name comes from the words \"fett\" (fat) and \"tisdag\" (Tuesday) Originally, this was the only day one should eat fastlagsbullar [30]\n\n\nUnited States\nWhile not observed nationally throughout the United States, a number of historically ethnically French cities and regions in the country have notable celebrations Mardi Gras arrived in North America as a French Catholic tradition with the Le Moyne brothers, [31] Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville and Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville, in the late 17th century, when King Louis XIV sent the pair to defend France's claim on the territory of Louisiane, which included what are now the U.S states of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and part of eastern Texas [31]\n\n\nCostumes\nMardi Gras, as a celebration of life before the more-somber occasion of Ash Wednesday, nearly always involves the use of masks and costumes by its participants, and the most popular celebratory colors are purple, green, and gold  In New Orleans, for example, these often take the shape of fairies, animals, people from myths, or various Medieval costumes [42] as well as clowns and Indians (Native Americans) [43]\n\n\nExposure by women\nAlthough the Church teaches that it is sinful and that it contravenes the Christian standards of modesty, [45] [46] the practice of some women exposing their breasts during Mardi Gras in New Orleans, US, has been documented since 1889, when the Times-Democrat decried the \"degree of immodesty exhibited by nearly all female masqueraders seen on the streets.\" The practice was mostly limited to tourists in the upper Bourbon Street area [47] [48] In the crowded streets of the French Quarter, generally avoided by locals on Mardi Gras Day, flashers on balconies cause crowds to form on the streets [citation

{"title": "Genghis_Khan", "content": "\nName and title\nThere is no universal romanisation system used for Mongolian; as a result, modern spellings of Mongolian names vary greatly and may result in considerably different pronunciations from the original [1] The honorific most commonly rendered as \"Genghis\" ultimately derives from the Mongolian ᠴᠢᠩᠭᠢᠰ, which may be romanised as Činggis This was adapted into Chinese as 成吉思 Chéngjísī, and into Persian as چنگیز Čəngīz As Arabic lacks a sound similar to  [tʃ], represented in the Mongolian and Persian romanisations by ⟨č⟩, writers transcribed the name as J̌ingiz, while Syriac authors used Šīngīz [2]\n\n\nSources\nAs the sources are written in more than a dozen languages from across Eurasia, modern historians have found it difficult to compile information on the life of Genghis Khan [6] All accounts of his adolescence and rise to power derive from two Mongolian-language sources—the Secret History of the Mongols, and the Altan Debter (Golden Book) The latter, now lost, served as inspiration for two Chinese chronicles—the 14th-century History of Yuan and the Shengwu qinzheng lu (Campaigns of Genghis Khan) [7] The History of Yuan, while poorly edited, provides a large amount of detail on individual campaigns and people; the Shengwu is more disciplined in its chronology, but does not criticise Genghis and occasionally contains errors [8]\n\n\nEarly life\nThe year of Temüjin's birth is disputed, as historians favour different dates: 1155, 1162 or 1167 Some traditions place his birth in the Year of the Pig, which was either 1155 or 1167 [18] While a dating to 1155 is supported by the writings of both Zhao Hong and Rashid al-Din, other major sources such as the History of Yuan and the Shengwu favour the year 1162 [19] [d] The 1167 dating, favoured by the sinologist Paul Pelliot, is derived from a minor source—a text of the Yuan artist Yang Weizhen—but is more compatible with the events of Genghis Khan's life than a 1155 placement, which implies that he did not have children until after the age of thirty and continued actively campaigning into his seventh decade [20] 1162 is the date accepted by most historians; [21] the historian Paul Ratchnevsky noted that Temüjin himself may not have known the truth [22] The location of Temüjin's birth, which the Secret History records as Delüün Boldog on the Onon River, is similarly debated: it has been placed at either Dadal in Khentii Province or in southern Agin-Buryat Okrug, Russia [23]\n\n\nBirth and childhood\nThe year of Temüjin's birth is disputed, as historians

southern Agin-Buryat Okrug, Russia [23]\n\n\nAdolescence\nYesügei's death shattered the unity of his people, which included members of the Borjigin, Tayichiud, and other clans As Temüjin was not yet ten and Behter around two years older, neither was considered experienced enough to rule The Tayichiud faction excluded Hö'elün from the ancestor worship ceremonies which followed a ruler's death and soon abandoned her camp The Secret History relates that the entire Borjigin clan followed, despite Hö'elün's attempts to shame them into staying by appealing to their honour [32] Rashid al-Din and the Shengwu however imply that Yesügei's brothers stood by the widow It is possible that Hö'elün may have refused to join in levirate marriage with one, resulting in later tensions, or that the author of the Secret History dramatised the situation [33] All the sources agree that most of Yesügei's people renounced his family in favour of the Tayichiuds and that Hö'elün's family were reduced to a much harsher life [34] Taking up a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, they collected roots and nuts, hunted for small animals, and caught fish [35]\n\n\nRise to power\nTemüjin returned to Dei Sechen to marry Börte when he reached the age of majority at fifteen Delighted to see the son-in-law he feared had died, Dei Sechen consented to the marriage and accompanied the newlyweds back to Temüjin's camp; his wife Čotan presented Hö'elün with an expensive sable cloak [43] Seeking a patron, Temüjin chose to regift the cloak to Toghrul, khan (ruler) of the Kerait tribe, who had fought alongside Yesügei and sworn the anda pact with him Toghrul ruled a vast territory in central Mongolia but distrusted many of his followers In need of loyal replacements, he was delighted with the valuable gift and welcomed Temüjin into his protection The two grew close, and Temüjin began to build a following, as nökod such as Jelme entered into his service [44] Temüjin and Börte had their first child, a daughter named Qojin, around this time [45]\n\n\nEarly campaigns\nTemüjin returned to Dei Sechen to marry Börte when he reached the age of majority at fifteen Delighted to see the son-in-law he feared had died, Dei

Jelme entered into his service [44] Temüjin and Börte had their first child, a daughter named Qojin, around this time [45]\n\n\nDefeating rivals\nThe sources do not agree on the events of Temüjin's return to the steppe In early summer 1196, he participated in a joint campaign with the Jin against the Tatars, who had begun to act contrary to Jin interests As a reward, the Jin awarded him the honorific cha-ut kuri, the meaning of which probably approximated \"commander of hundreds\" in Jurchen At around the same time, he assisted Toghrul with reclaiming the lordship of the Kereit, which had been usurped by one of Toghrul's relatives with the support of the powerful Naiman tribe [59] The actions of 1196 fundamentally changed Temüjin's position in the steppe—although nominally still Toghrul's vassal, he was de facto an equal ally [60]\n\n\nEarly reign: reforms and Chinese campaigns (1206–1215)\n\n\n\nKurultai of 1206 and reforms\n\n\n\nConsolidation of power (1206–1210)\nFrom 1204 to 1209, Genghis Khan was predominantly focused on consolidating and maintaining his new nation [92] He faced a challenge from the shaman Kokechu, whose father Münglig had been allowed to marry Hö'elün after he defected to Temüjin Kokechu, who had proclaimed Temüjin as Genghis Khan and taken the Tengrist title \"Teb Tenggeri\" (lit \"Wholly Heavenly\") on account of his sorcery, was very influential among the Mongol commoners and sought to divide the imperial family [93] Genghis's brother Qasar was the first of Kokechu's targets—always distrusted by his brother, Qasar was humiliated and almost imprisoned on false charges before Hö'elün intervened by publicly reprimanding Genghis Nevertheless, Kokechu's power steadily increased, and he publicly shamed Temüge, Genghis's youngest brother, when he attempted to intervene [94] Börte saw that Kokechu was a threat to Genghis's power and warned her husband, who still superstitiously revered the shaman but now recognised the political threat he posed Genghis allowed Temüge to arrange Kokechu's death, and then usurped the shaman's position as the Mongols' highest spiritual authority [95]\n\n\nCampaign against the Jin (1211–1215)\nWanyan Yongji usurped the Jin throne in 1209 He had previously served on the steppe frontier and Genghis greatly disliked him [107] When asked to submit and pay the annual tribute to Yongji in 1210, Genghis instead mocked the emperor, spat, and rode away from the Jin envoy—a challenge that meant war [108] Despite the possibility of being outnumbered eight-to-one by 600,000 Jin soldiers, Genghis had prepared to invade the Jin since learning in 1206 that the state was wracked by internal instabilities [109] Genghis had two aims: to take vengeance for past wrongs committed by the Jin, foremost among which was the death of Ambaghai Khan in the mid-12th century, and to win the vast amounts of plunder his troops and vassals expected [110]\n\n\nLater reign: western expansion and return to China (1216–1227)\nIn 1207, Genghis had appointed a man named Qorchi as governor of the subdued Hoi-yin Irgen tribes in Siberia Appointed not for his talents but for prior services rendered, Qorchi's tendency to abduct women as concubines for his harem caused the tribes to rebel and take him prisoner in early 1216 The following year, they ambushed and killed Boroqul, one of Genghis's highest-ranking nökod [126] The khan was livid at the loss of his close friend and prepared to lead a retaliatory campaign; eventually dissuaded from this course, he dispatched his eldest son Jochi and a Dörbet commander They managed to surprise and defeat the rebels, securing control over this economically important region [127]\n\n\nDefeating rebellions and Qara Khitai (1216–1218)\nIn 1207, Genghis had appointed a man named Qorchi as governor of the subdued Hoi-yin Irgen tribes in Siberia Appointed not for his talents but for prior services rendered, Qorchi's tendency to abduct women as concubines for his harem caused the tribes to rebel and take him prisoner in early 1216 The following year, they ambushed and killed Boroqul, one of Genghis's highest-ranking nökod [126] The khan was livid at the loss of his close friend and prepared to lead a retaliatory campaign; eventually dissuaded from this course, he dispatched his eldest son Jochi and a Dörbet commander They managed to surprise and defeat the rebels, securing control over this economically important region [127]\n\n\nInvasion of the Khwarazmian Empire (1219–1221)\nGenghis had now attained complete control of the eastern portion of the Silk Road, and his territory bordered that of the Khwarazmian Empire, which ruled over much of Central Asia, Persia and Afghanistan [131] Merchants from both sides were eager to restart trading, which had halted during Kuchlug's rule; the Khwarazmian ruler Muhammad II dispatched an envoy shortly after the Mongol capture of Zhongdu, while Genghis instructed his merchants to obtain the high-quality textiles and steel of Central and Western Asia [132] Many members of the altan uruq invested in one particular caravan of 450 merchants which set off to Khwarazmia in 1218 with a large quantity of wares Inalchuq, the governor of the Khwarazmian border town of Otrar, decided to massacre the merchants on grounds of espionage and seize the goods; Muhammad had grown suspicious of Genghis's intentions and either supported Inalchuq or turned a blind eye [133] A Mongol ambassador was sent with two companions to avert war, but Muhammad killed him and humiliated his companions The killing of an envoy infuriated Genghis, who resolved to leave Muqali with a small force in North China and invade Khwarazmia with most of his army [134]\n\n\nReturn to China and final campaign (1222–1227)\nGenghis abruptly halted his Central Asian campaigns in 1221 [149] Initially aiming to return via India, Genghis realised that the heat and humidity of the South Asian climate impeded his army's skills, while the omens were additionally unfavourable [150] Although the Mongols spent much of 1222 repeatedly overcoming rebellions in Khorasan, they withdrew completely from the region to avoid overextending themselves, setting their new frontier on the Amu Darya river [151] During his lengthy return journey, Genghis prepared a new administrative division which would govern the conquered territories, appointing darughachi (commissioners, lit \"those who press the seal\") and basqaq (local officials) to manage the region back to normalcy [152] He also summoned and spoke with the Taoist patriarch Changchun in the Hindu Kush The khan listened attentively to Changchun's teachings and granted his followers numerous privileges, including tax exemptions and authority over all monks throughout the empire—a grant which the Taoists later used to try to gain superiority over Buddhism [153]\n\n\nDeath and aftermath\nGenghis fell from his horse while hunting in the winter of 1226–27 and became increasingly ill during the following months This slowed the siege of Zhongxing's progress, as his sons and commanders urged him to end the campaign and return to Mongolia to recover, arguing that the Xia would still be there another year [160] Incensed by insults from Xia's leading commander, Genghis insisted that the siege be continued He died on either 18 or 25 August 1227, but his death was kept a closely guarded secret and Zhongxing, unaware, fell the following month The city was put to the sword and its population was treated with extreme savagery—the Xia civilization was essentially extinguished in what Man described as a \"very successful ethnocide\" [161] The exact nature of the khan's death has been the subject of intense speculation Rashid al-Din and the History of Yuan mention he suffered from an illness—possibly malaria, typhus, or bubonic plague [162] Marco Polo claimed that he was shot by an arrow during a siege, while Carpini reported that Genghis was struck by lightning Legends sprang up around the event—the most famous recounts how the beautiful Gurbelchin, formerly the Xia emperor's wife, injured Genghis's genitals with a dagger during sex [163]\n\n\nSuccession\nThe tribes of the Mongol steppe had no fixed succession system, but often defaulted to some form of ultimogeniture—succession of the youngest son—because he would have had the least time to gain a following for himself and needed the help of his father's inheritance [167] However, this type of inheritance applied only to property, not to titles [168]\n\n\nFamily\nBörte, whom Temüjin married c. 1178, remained his senior wife [181] She gave birth to four sons and five daughters, who all became influential figures in the empire [182] Genghis granted Börte's sons lands and property through the Mongol appanage system, [183] while he secured marriage alliances by marrying her daughters to important families [182] Her children were:\n\n\nCharacter and achievements\nNo eyewitness description or contemporaneous depiction of Genghis Khan survives [198] The Persian chronicler Juzjani and the Song diplomat Zhao Hong provide the two earliest descriptions [i] Both recorded that he was tall and strong with a powerful stature Zhao wrote that Genghis had a broad brow and long beard while Juzjani commented on his cat's eyes and lack of grey hair The Secret History records that Börte's father remarked on his \"flashing eyes and lively face\" when meeting him [200]\n\n\nLegacy and historical assessment\nGenghis Khan left a vast and controversial legacy His unification of the Mongol tribes and his foundation of the largest contiguous state in world history \"permanently alter [ed] the worldview of European, Islamic,  [and] East Asian civilizations\", according to Atwood [220] His conquests enabled the creation of Eurasian trading systems unprecedented in their scale, which brought wealth and security to the tribes [221] Although he very likely did not codify the written body of laws known as the Great Yasa, [222] he did reorganise the legal system and establish a powerful judicial authority under Shigi Qutuqu [223]\n\n\nMongolia\nFor many centuries, Genghis was remembered in Mongolia as a religious figure, not a political one After Altan Khan converted to Tibetan Buddhism in the late 1500s, Genghis was deified and given a central role in the Mongolian religious tradition [228] As a deity, Genghis drew upon Buddhist, shamanistic, and folk traditions: for example, he was defined as a new incarnation of a chakravartin (idealised ruler) like Ashoka, or of Vajrapani, the martial bodhisattva; he was connected genealogically to the Buddha and to ancient Buddhist kings; he was invoked during weddings and festivals; and he took a large role in ancestor veneration rituals [229] He also became the focus point of a sleeping hero legend, which says he will return to help the Mongol people in a time of great need [230] His cult was centred at the naiman chagan ordon (lit. '\"Eight White Yurts\"'), today a mausoleum in Inner Mongolia, China [231]\n\n\nElsewhere\nThe historical and modern Muslim world has associated Genghis Khan with a myriad of ideologies and beliefs [240] Its first instinct, as Islamic thought had never previously envisioned being ruled by a non-Muslim power, was to view Genghis as the herald of the approaching Judgement Day Over time, as the world failed to end and as his descendants began converting to Islam, Muslims began to see Genghis as an instrument of God's will who was destined to strengthen the Muslim world by cleansing its innate corruption [241]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nCitations\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Genghis Khan\n\nGenghis Khan was a Mongol emperor and the founder of the Mongol Empire, which became the largest contiguous empire in history. He was born around 1162 AD and died in 1227 AD. His real name was Temüjin, and he was given the title Genghis Khan, which means \"Universal Ruler\" or \"Oceanic Ruler,\" by his followers.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nThe year of Temüjin's birth is disputed among historians, with some placing it as early as 1155 AD and others as late as 1167 AD. The Secret History of the Mongols, a primary source on the life of Genghis Khan, records that he was born in the Year of the Pig, which was either 1155 or 1167. While some sources, such as Zhao Hong and Rashid al-Din, support a 1155 birthdate, others, such as the History of Yuan and the Shengwu qinzheng lu, favor 1162.\n\n**Early Life and Adolescence**\n\nTemüjin's early life was marked by hardship and struggle. His father, Yesügei, was a chieftain of the Borjigin tribe, but he was killed in a battle when Temüjin was just a child. This event set off a chain of events that would shape Temüjin's future. His family was forced to abandon their home and seek refuge with the Tayichiud tribe, who were rival to the Borjigin.\n\nThe Tayichiud faction excluded Hö'elün, Temüjin's mother, from the ancestor worship ceremonies that followed a ruler's death, and soon abandoned her camp. The Secret History relates that the entire Borjigin clan followed, despite Hö'elün's attempts to shame them into staying by appealing to their honor.\n\n**Rise to Power**\n\nTemüjin returned to Dei Sechen to marry Börte when he reached the age of majority at 15.

text of the Yuan artist Yang Weizhen—but is more compatible with the events of Genghis Khan's life than a 1155 placement, which implies that he did not have children until after the age of thirty and continued actively campaigning into his seventh decade [20] 1162 is the date accepted by most historians; [21] the historian Paul Ratchnevsky noted that Temüjin himself may not have known the truth [22] The location of Temüjin's birth, which the Secret History records as Delüün Boldog on the Onon River, is similarly debated: it has been placed at either Dadal in Khentii Province or in southern Agin-Buryat Okrug, Russia [23]\n\n\nBirth and childhood\nThe year of Temüjin's birth is disputed, as historians favour different dates: 1155, 1162 or 1167 Some traditions place his birth in the Year of the Pig, which was either 1155 or 1167 [18] While a dating to 1155 is supported by the writings of both Zhao Hong and Rashid al-Din, other major sources such as the History of Yuan and the Shengwu favour the year 1162 [19] [d] The 1167 dating, favoured by the sinologist Paul Pelliot, is derived from a minor source—a text of the Yuan artist Yang Weizhen—but is more compatible with the events of

Delüün Boldog on the Onon River, is similarly debated: it has been placed at either Dadal in Khentii Province or in southern Agin-Buryat Okrug, Russia [23]\n\n\nAdolescence\nYesügei's death shattered the unity of his people, which included members of the Borjigin, Tayichiud, and other clans As Temüjin was not yet ten and Behter around two years older, neither was considered experienced enough to rule The Tayichiud faction excluded Hö'elün from the ancestor worship ceremonies which followed a ruler's death and soon abandoned her camp The Secret History relates that the entire Borjigin clan followed, despite Hö'elün's attempts to shame them into staying by appealing to their honour [32] Rashid al-Din and the Shengwu however imply that Yesügei's brothers stood by the widow It is possible that Hö'elün may have refused to join in levirate marriage with one, resulting in later tensions, or that the author of the Secret History dramatised the situation [33] All the sources agree that most of Yesügei's people renounced his family in favour of the Tayichiuds and that Hö'elün's family were reduced to a much harsher life [34] Taking up a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, they collected roots and nuts, hunted for small animals, and caught fish [35]\n\n\nRise to power\nTemüjin returned to Dei Sechen to marry Börte when he reached the age of majority at fifteen Delighted to see the son-in-law he feared had died, Dei Sechen consented to the marriage and accompanied the newlyweds back to Temüjin's camp; his wife Čotan presented Hö'elün with an expensive sable cloak [43] Seeking a patron, Temüjin chose to regift the cloak to Toghrul, khan (ruler) of the Kerait tribe, who had fought alongside Yesügei and sworn the anda pact with him Toghrul ruled a vast territory in central Mongolia but distrusted many of his followers In need of loyal replacements, he was delighted with the valuable gift and welcomed Temüjin into his protection The two grew close, and Temüjin began to build a following, as nökod such as Jelme entered into his service [44] Temüjin and Börte had their first child, a daughter named Qojin, around this time [45]\n\n\nEarly campaigns\nTemüjin returned to Dei

first child, a daughter named Qojin, around this time [45]\n\n\nDefeating rivals\nThe sources do not agree on the events of Temüjin's return to the steppe In early summer 1196, he participated in a joint campaign with the Jin against the Tatars, who had begun to act contrary to Jin interests As a reward, the Jin awarded him the honorific cha-ut kuri, the meaning of which probably approximated \"commander of hundreds\" in Jurchen At around the same time, he assisted Toghrul with reclaiming the lordship of the Kereit, which had been usurped by one of Toghrul's relatives with the support of the powerful Naiman tribe [59] The actions of 1196 fundamentally changed Temüjin's position in the steppe—although nominally still Toghrul's vassal, he was de facto an equal ally [60]\n\n\nEarly reign: reforms and Chinese campaigns (1206–1215)\n\n\n\nKurultai of 1206 and reforms\n\n\n\nConsolidation of power (1206–1210)\nFrom 1204 to 1209, Genghis Khan was predominantly focused on consolidating and maintaining his new nation [92] He faced a challenge from the shaman Kokechu, whose father Münglig had been allowed to marry Hö'elün after he defected to Temüjin Kokechu, who had proclaimed Temüjin as Genghis Khan and taken the Tengrist title \"Teb Tenggeri\" (lit \"Wholly Heavenly\") on account of his sorcery, was very influential among the Mongol commoners and sought to divide the imperial family [93] Genghis's brother Qasar was the first of Kokechu's targets—always distrusted by his brother, Qasar was humiliated and almost imprisoned on false charges before Hö'elün intervened by publicly reprimanding Genghis Nevertheless, Kokechu's power steadily increased, and he publicly shamed Temüge, Genghis's youngest brother, when he attempted to intervene [94] Börte saw that Kokechu was a threat to Genghis's power and warned her husband, who still superstitiously revered the shaman but now recognised the political threat he posed Genghis allowed Temüge to arrange Kokechu's death, and then usurped the shaman's position as the Mongols' highest spiritual authority [95]\n\n\nCampaign against the Jin (1211–1215)\nWanyan Yongji usurped the Jin throne in 1209 He had previously served on the steppe frontier and Genghis greatly disliked him [107] When asked to submit and pay the annual tribute to Yongji in 1210, Genghis instead mocked the emperor, spat, and rode away from the Jin envoy—a challenge that meant war [108] Despite the possibility of being outnumbered eight-to-one by 600,000 Jin soldiers, Genghis had prepared to invade the Jin since learning in 1206 that the state was wracked by internal instabilities [109] Genghis had two aims: to take vengeance for past wrongs committed by the Jin, foremost among which was the death of Ambaghai Khan in the mid-12th century, and to win the vast amounts of plunder his troops and vassals expected [110]\n\n\nLater reign: western expansion and return to China (1216–1227)\nIn 1207, Genghis had appointed a man named Qorchi as governor of the subdued Hoi-yin Irgen tribes in Siberia Appointed not for his talents but for prior services rendered, Qorchi's tendency to abduct women as concubines for his harem caused the tribes to rebel and take him prisoner in early 1216 The following year, they ambushed and killed Boroqul, one of Genghis's highest-ranking nökod [126] The khan was livid at the loss of his close friend and prepared to lead a retaliatory campaign; eventually dissuaded from this course, he dispatched his eldest son Jochi and a Dörbet commander They managed to surprise and defeat the rebels, securing control over this economically important region [127]\n\n\nDefeating rebellions and Qara Khitai (1216–1218)\nIn 1207, Genghis had appointed a man named Qorchi as governor of the subdued Hoi-yin Irgen tribes in Siberia Appointed not for his talents but for prior services rendered, Qorchi's tendency to abduct women as concubines for his harem caused the tribes to rebel and take him prisoner in early 1216 The following year, they ambushed and killed Boroqul, one of Genghis's highest-ranking nökod [126] The khan was livid at the loss of his close friend and prepared to lead a retaliatory campaign; eventually dissuaded from this course, he dispatched his eldest son Jochi and a Dörbet commander They managed to surprise and defeat the rebels, securing control over this economically important region [127]\n\n\nInvasion of the Khwarazmian Empire (1219–1221)\nGenghis had now attained complete control of the eastern portion of the Silk Road, and his territory bordered that of the Khwarazmian Empire, which ruled over much of Central Asia, Persia and Afghanistan [131] Merchants from both sides were eager to restart trading, which had halted during Kuchlug's rule; the Khwarazmian ruler Muhammad II dispatched an envoy shortly after the Mongol capture of Zhongdu, while Genghis instructed his merchants to obtain the high-quality textiles and steel of Central and Western Asia [132] Many members of the altan uruq invested in one particular caravan of 450 merchants which set off to Khwarazmia in 1218 with a large quantity of wares Inalchuq, the governor of the Khwarazmian border town of Otrar, decided to massacre the merchants on grounds of espionage and seize the goods; Muhammad had grown suspicious of Genghis's intentions and either supported Inalchuq or turned a blind eye [133] A Mongol ambassador was sent with two companions to avert war, but Muhammad killed him and humiliated his companions The killing of an envoy infuriated Genghis, who resolved to leave Muqali with a small force in North China and invade Khwarazmia with most of his army [134]\n\n\nReturn to China and final campaign (1222–1227)\nGenghis abruptly halted his Central Asian campaigns in 1221 [149] Initially aiming to return via India, Genghis realised that the heat and humidity of the South Asian climate impeded his army's skills, while the omens were additionally unfavourable [150] Although the Mongols spent much of 1222 repeatedly overcoming rebellions in Khorasan, they withdrew completely from the region to avoid overextending themselves, setting their new frontier on the Amu Darya river [151] During his lengthy return journey, Genghis prepared a new administrative division which would govern the conquered territories, appointing darughachi (commissioners, lit \"those who press the seal\") and basqaq (local officials) to manage the region back to normalcy [152] He also summoned and spoke with the Taoist patriarch Changchun in the Hindu Kush The khan listened attentively to Changchun's teachings and granted his followers numerous privileges, including tax exemptions and authority over all monks throughout the empire—a grant which the Taoists later used to try to gain superiority over Buddhism [153]\n\n\nDeath and aftermath\nGenghis fell from his horse while hunting in the winter of 1226–27 and became increasingly ill during the following months This slowed the siege of Zhongxing's progress, as his sons and commanders urged him to end the campaign and return to Mongolia to recover, arguing that the Xia would still be there another year [160] Incensed by insults from Xia's leading commander, Genghis insisted that the siege be continued He died on either 18 or 25 August 1227, but his death was kept a closely guarded secret and Zhongxing, unaware, fell the following month The city was put to the sword and its population was treated with extreme savagery—the Xia civilization was essentially extinguished in what Man described as a \"very successful ethnocide\" [161] The exact nature of the khan's death has been the subject of intense speculation Rashid al-Din and the History of Yuan mention he suffered from an illness—possibly malaria, typhus, or bubonic plague [162] Marco Polo claimed that he was shot by an arrow during a siege, while Carpini reported that Genghis was struck by lightning Legends sprang up around the event—the most famous recounts how the beautiful Gurbelchin, formerly the Xia emperor's wife, injured Genghis's genitals with a dagger during sex [163]\n\n\nSuccession\nThe tribes of the Mongol steppe had no fixed succession system, but often defaulted to some form of ultimogeniture—succession of the youngest son—because he would have had the least time to gain a following for himself and needed the help of his father's inheritance [167] However, this type of inheritance applied only to property, not to titles [168]\n\n\nFamily\nBörte, whom Temüjin married c. 1178, remained his senior wife [181] She gave birth to four sons and five daughters, who all became influential figures in the empire [182] Genghis granted Börte's sons lands and property through the Mongol appanage system, [183] while he secured marriage alliances by marrying her daughters to important families [182] Her children were:\n\n\nCharacter and achievements\nNo eyewitness description or contemporaneous depiction of Genghis Khan survives [198] The Persian chronicler Juzjani and the Song diplomat Zhao Hong provide the two earliest descriptions [i] Both recorded that he was tall and strong with a powerful stature Zhao wrote that Genghis had a broad brow and long beard while Juzjani commented on his cat's eyes and lack of grey hair The Secret History records that Börte's father remarked on his \"flashing eyes and lively face\" when meeting him [200]\n\n\nLegacy and historical assessment\nGenghis Khan left a vast and controversial legacy His unification of the Mongol tribes and his foundation of the largest contiguous state in world history \"permanently alter [ed] the worldview of European, Islamic,  [and] East Asian civilizations\", according to Atwood [220] His conquests enabled the creation of Eurasian trading systems unprecedented in their scale, which brought wealth and security to the tribes [221] Although he very likely did not codify the written body of laws known as the Great Yasa, [222] he did reorganise the legal system and establish a powerful judicial authority under Shigi Qutuqu [223]\n\n\nMongolia\nFor many centuries, Genghis was remembered in Mongolia as a religious figure, not a political one After Altan Khan converted to Tibetan Buddhism in the late 1500s, Genghis was deified and given a central role in the Mongolian religious tradition [228] As a deity, Genghis drew upon Buddhist, shamanistic, and folk traditions: for example, he was defined as a new incarnation of a chakravartin (idealised ruler) like Ashoka, or of Vajrapani, the martial bodhisattva; he was connected genealogically to the Buddha and to ancient Buddhist kings; he was invoked during weddings and festivals; and he took a large role in ancestor veneration rituals [229] He also became the focus point of a sleeping hero legend, which says he will return to help the Mongol people in a time of great need [230] His cult was centred at the naiman chagan ordon (lit. '\"Eight White Yurts\"'), today a mausoleum in Inner Mongolia, China [231]\n\n\nElsewhere\nThe historical and modern Muslim world has associated Genghis Khan with a myriad of ideologies and beliefs [240] Its first instinct, as Islamic thought had never previously envisioned being ruled by a non-Muslim power, was to view Genghis as the herald of the approaching Judgement Day Over time, as the world failed to end and as his descendants began converting to Islam, Muslims began to see Genghis as an instrument of God's will who was destined to strengthen the Muslim world by cleansing its innate corruption [241]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nCitations\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

American brewer and saloon operator George Schneider opened the Bavarian Brewery on Carondelet Avenue (later known as South Broadway) between Dorcas and Lynch streets in South St Louis [14] [15]

and from 1875 to 1879 as the E Anheuser Company's Brewing Association [14]\n\n\nProhibition period\nAs with all breweries in the country, the Temperance movement and eventual Prohibition in the United States dealt a major blow to the company in the 1910s through the 1930s Some of the products sold by Anheuser-Busch to survive during Prohibition included brewer's yeast, malt extract, ice cream, and Bevo, a nonalcoholic malt beverage, or \"near beer\" [23] [29]\n\n\nProhibition to last years of independence\nIn 1957, Anheuser-Busch became the largest brewer in the United States.\n\n\nAcquisition

release, some perceived the ad to be a political statement in opposition to then-current president Donald Trump A week before the ad's release, public controversy erupted over an executive order prohibiting entry of immigrants, refugees, and re-entry of permanent residents from seven countries into the United States [84] The script for the advertisement was finalized after the November elections, when Budweiser's internal marketing team settled on the twelfth revision of the script Shooting for the commercial then took place in January [85] The ad controversy followed after

advertising\nOn March 21, 2019, Anheuser-Busch was sued for false advertising by rival MillerCoors over a Bud Light commercial that aired during Super Bowl LIII [87] The commercial claimed MillerCoors' Miller Lite and Coors Light products contain corn syrup, but the lawsuit argues that corn syrup is only used during the brewing process as a fermentation aid and neither beer contains corn syrup The suit alleges that Anheuser-Busch is using \"false and misleading statements\" to confuse health-conscious consumers into thinking the beers contain high-fructose corn syrup, which has been linked with obesity [88] An Anheuser-Busch spokesperson called the lawsuit \"baseless\" and said it would not deter Bud Light from \"providing consumers with the transparency they demand.\" [89]

in St. Louis, Missouri. The company is one of the largest brewing companies in the world and is known for its iconic brands such as Budweiser, Bud Light, and Michelob.\n\n**History**\n\nAnheuser-Busch was founded in 1852 by Adolphus Busch, who immigrated to the United States from Germany in 1853. Busch's initial brewery was located on Carondelet Avenue in St. Louis, Missouri, and produced a variety of beers, including the famous Budweiser brand. The company's early success was due in part to Busch's innovative marketing techniques and his development of the first pasteurized beer.\n\nIn 1860, Busch partnered with Eberhard Anheuser, a German-born soap manufacturer, to form E. Anheuser & Co. The company's name was later changed to the E. Anheuser Company's Brewing Association in 1875. During this time, the company expanded its operations and introduced new products, including the Michelob brand.\n\n**Beginnings and National Expansion**\n\nIn 1852, Adolphus Busch opened the Bavarian Brewery on Carondelet Avenue in St. Louis, Missouri. The brewery was a small operation that produced a variety of beers, including the famous Budweiser brand. Busch's initial success was due in part to his innovative marketing techniques and his development of the first pasteurized beer.\n\nIn 1856, Busch expanded his operations to a new brewhouse near Eighth and Crittenden Streets. However, the following year, financial problems forced the sale of the brewery to various owners. In 1860, Busch partnered with Eberhard Anheuser to form E. Anheuser & Co.\n\nThe company's name was later changed to the E. Anheuser Company's Brewing Association in 1875. During this time, the company expanded its operations and introduced new products, including the Michelob brand.\n\n**Prohibition Period**\n\nAs with all breweries in the country, the Temperance movement and eventual Prohibition in the United States dealt a major blow to the company in the 1910s through the 1930s. Some of the products sold by Anheuser-Busch to survive during Prohibition included brewer's yeast, malt extract, ice cream, and Bevo, a nonalcoholic malt beverage, or \"near beer\".\n\n**Prohibition to Last Years of Independence**\n\nIn 1957, Anheuser-Busch became the largest brewer in the United States. The company continued to expand its operations and introduce new products, including the Bud Light brand in 1982.\n\n**Acquisition by InBev**\n\nOn June 12, 2008, Belgian-Brazilian brewing company InBev announced that it had made a US$46 billion offer for Anheuser-Busch. If accepted, the merger would have joined two of the world's four largest brewing companies and created a company brewing three of the highest-grossing beers in the world.\n\nHowever, Anheuser-Busch rejected the offer and provided a restructuring of the company to maintain shareholders and United States World Headquarters in St. Louis. InBev urged Anheuser-Busch shareholders to vote in favor of the buyout, but the company maintained its opposition.\n\n**Post-Acquisition Changes**\n\nOn November 18, 2008, the hostile takeover was completed, and the parent corporation was renamed Anheuser-Busch InBev.

Brendan Whitworth is the current CEO of the Anheuser-Busch subsidiary.\n\n**Brewery Operations**\n\nAnheuser-Busch Companies has operated 13 breweries, all located in the United States. The company's breweries are equipped with state-of-the-art technology and are capable of producing a variety of beers, including the iconic Budweiser brand.\n\n**Other Operations**\n\nAside from supply operations like brewing and packaging, Anheuser-Busch Companies includes Anheuser-Busch Wholesale Operations Divisions (WOD), Anheuser-Busch Agricultural Operations, Anheuser-Busch Recycling Corporation, Eagle Packaging, and Busch Properties, which manages subsidiary-owned property.\n\n**Environmental Record**\n\nThe company's brewing process releases a significant amount of carbon dioxide, which is released into the air. In 2002, the Political Economy Research Institute ranked Anheuser-Busch 40th among the \"Toxic 100\", a list of U.S corporations most responsible for air pollution.\n\n**Ties with Washington University in St. Louis**\n\nAdolphus Busch joined Washington University's Board of Directors in 1895 and continued to serve on the board until his death in 1913. The Busch family has maintained a strong connection with the university, with August Busch III serving as a trustee.\n\nThe Anheuser-Busch Foundation has also made significant donations to the university, including the naming of Anheuser-Busch Hall. The company's connection with the university is ongoing, with Jack H Purnell, former CEO of Anheuser-Busch, serving as an executive in residence of the Olin Business School.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAnheuser-Busch is a global brewing and beverage company with a rich history and a strong presence in the United States. The company has expanded its operations and introduced new products over the years, including the iconic Budweiser brand. Despite facing challenges, including Prohibition and the acquisition by InBev, Anheuser-Busch remains a major player in the brewing industry and a significant contributor to the economy.\n\nThe company's commitment to innovation, quality, and customer satisfaction has allowed it to maintain its position as one of the largest brewing companies in the world.

The incident involved a Japan Airlines (JAL) Airbus A350-941, flight number JAL516, and a Japan Coast Guard (JCG) aircraft, which crashed on the runway during an emergency landing. The accident resulted in significant damage to the airport and the destruction of the JAL aircraft.\n\n**Aircraft**\n\nThe JAL aircraft involved in the accident was an Airbus A350-941, manufacturer serial number 538, and registered as JA13XJ. The aircraft was just over two years old at the time of the collision, first flying on 20 September 2021, and delivered to JAL on 10 November 2021.\n\nThe JAL A350-941 is a wide-body, twin-engine jet airliner that is designed for long-haul flights. The aircraft has a maximum takeoff weight of 280,000 kg (617,300 lb) and is powered by two Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines. The aircraft has a capacity for 369 passengers in a three-class configuration.\n\nThe JAL aircraft was on a domestic flight from New Chitose Airport to Haneda Airport, with 245 passengers and 10 crew members on board. The flight departed New Chitose Airport at 16:27 JST (07:27 UTC) and was scheduled to land at Haneda Airport at 18:15 JST (09:15 UTC).\n\n**Accident**\n\nThe Japan Coast Guard aircraft, carrying six crew members, was transporting emergency supplies to an airbase in Niigata in response to the 2024 Noto earthquake, which had occurred the day before. The aircraft was one of four deployed by the government to provide help to the affected areas.\n\nThe Coast Guard aircraft was a modified Dash 8, a twin-engine turboprop aircraft, that was used for search and rescue operations. The aircraft was equipped with a cargo hold and was carrying 1,500 kg (3,300 lb) of emergency supplies.\n\nAt 18:10 JST (09:10 UTC), the JAL A350-941, flight number JAL516, was cleared for landing on runway 34R at Haneda Airport. The aircraft was instructed to make a visual approach and was advised of the Coast Guard aircraft on the runway.\n\nHowever, the JAL aircraft failed to acknowledge the Coast Guard aircraft on the runway, and at 18:12 JST (09:12 UTC), the aircraft crashed on the runway, just 150 meters (164 yards) from the point where the Coast Guard aircraft was positioned.\n\n**Coast Guard Aircraft**\n\nThe Japan Coast Guard aircraft, carrying six crew members, was transporting emergency supplies to an airbase in Niigata in response to the 2024 Noto earthquake, which had occurred the day before.

{"title": "SARS-CoV-2_Delta_variant", "content": "\nClassification\nThe Delta variant has mutations in the gene encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein [6] causing the substitutions D614G, T478K, P681R and L452R [29] [8] It is identified as the 21A, 21I, and 21J clades under the Nextstrain phylogenetic classification system [30]\n\n\nNames\nThe virus has also been referred to by the term \"Indian Variant\" [31] as it was originally detected in India However, the Delta variant is only one of three variants of the lineage B.1.617, all of which were first detected in India [32] At the end of May 2021, the WHO assigned the label Delta to lineage B.1.617.2 after introducing a new policy of using Greek letters for variants of concern and variants of interest [33]\n\n\nOther sublineages of B.1.617\nThere are three sublineages of lineage B.1.617 categorised so far.\n\n\nMutations\nThe Delta/ B.1.617.2 genome has 13 mutations (15 or 17 according to some sources, [which?] depending on whether more common mutations are included) which produce alterations in the amino-acid sequences of the proteins it encodes [40]\n\n\nLineages\nAs of August 2021, Delta variants have been subdivided in the Pango lineage designation system into variants from AY.1 to AY.28 However, there is no information on whether such classification correlates with biological characteristic changes of the virus [48] It is said that, as of August 2021, AY.4 to AY.11 are predominant in the UK, AY.12 in Israel, AY.2, AY.3, AY.13, AY.14, AY.25 in the US, AY.20 in the US and Mexico, AY.15 in Canada, AY.16 in Kenya, AY.17 in Ireland and Northern Ireland, AY.19 in South Africa, AY.21 in Italy and Switzerland, AY.22 in Portugal, AY.24 in Indonesia, and AY.23 in Indonesia, Singapore, Japan, and South Korea [49]\n\n\n\"Delta plus\" variant\nDelta with K417N originally corresponded to lineages AY.1 and AY.2, [50] subsequently also lineage AY.3, [51] and has been nicknamed \"Delta plus\" or \"Nepal variant\" [52] It has the K417N mutation, [53] which is also present in the Beta variant [54] The exchange at position 417 is a lysine-to-asparagine substitution [55]\n\n\nSymptoms\nThe most common symptoms may have changed from the most common symptoms previously associated with standard COVID-19 Infected people may mistake the symptoms for a bad cold and not realize they need to isolate Common symptoms reported have been headaches, sore throat, a runny nose or a fever [1] [medical citation needed] [2]\n\n\nPrevention\n: VE reduces <10%, or VE >90% without comparator\n: VE reduces between 10 and <20%\n\n\nTreatment\nIn vitro experiments suggest that bamlanivimab may not be effective against Delta on its own [85]  At high enough concentrations, casirivimab, etesevimab and imdevimab appear to still be effective  A preprint study suggests that sotrovimab may also be effective against Delta [86]  Doctors in Singapore have been using supplemental oxygen, remdesivir and corticosteroids on more Delta patients than they did on previous variants [87]\n\n\nEpidemiology\nUK scientists have said that the Delta variant is between 40% and 60% more transmissible than the previously dominant Alpha variant, which was first identified in the UK (as the Kent variant) [88] Given that Alpha is already 150% as transmissible as the original SARS-CoV-2 strain that emerged in late 2019 in Wuhan, [88] and if Delta is 150% as transmissible as Alpha, then Delta may be 225% as transmissible as the original strain [89] BBC reported that \n\n\n\n\nR\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle R_{0}}\n\n – basic reproduction number, or the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection – for the first detected SARS-CoV-2 virus is 2.4–2.6, whereas Alpha's reproduction number is 4–5 and Delta's is 5–9 [90] [91] These basic reproduction numbers can be compared to MERS (0.29-0.80 [92]), seasonal influenza (1.2–1.4 [93]), Ebola (1.4–1.8 [94]), common cold (2–3 [95]), SARS (2–4 [96]), smallpox (3.5–6 [97]), and chickenpox (10–12 [98]) Due to Delta's high transmissibility even those that are vaccinated are vulnerable, [99] albeit to a lesser extent [73]\n\n\nTransmissibility\nUK scientists have said that the Delta variant is between 40% and 60% more transmissible than the previously dominant Alpha variant, which was first identified in the UK (as the Kent variant) [88] Given that Alpha is already 150% as transmissible as the original SARS-CoV-2 strain that emerged in late 2019 in Wuhan, [88] and if Delta is 150%

[73]\n\n\nInfection age groups\nSurveillance data from the Indian government's Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) shows that around 32% of patients, both hospitalised and outside hospitals, were aged below 30 in the second wave compared to 31% during the first wave, among people aged 30–40 the infection rate stayed at 21% Hospitalisation in the 20–39 bracket increased to 25.5% from 23.7% while the 0–19 range increased to 5.8% from 4.2% The data also showed a higher proportion of asymptomatic patients were admitted during the second wave, with more complaints of breathlessness [125]\n\n\nVirulence\nA few early studies suggest the Delta variant causes more severe illness than other strains [126] On 7 June 2021, researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases in Singapore posted a paper suggesting that patients testing positive for Delta are more likely to develop pneumonia and/or require oxygen than patients with wild type or Alpha [127] On June 11, Public Health England released a report finding that there was \"significantly increased risk of hospitalization\" from Delta as compared with Alpha; [128] the risk was approximately twice as high for those infected with the Delta variant [129] On June 14, researchers from Public Health Scotland found that the risk of hospitalization from Delta was roughly double that of from Alpha [130] On July 7, a preprint study from epidemiologists at the University of Toronto found that Delta had a 120% greater – or more than twice as large – risk of hospitalization, 287% greater risk of ICU admission and 137% greater risk of death compared to non-variant of concern strains of SARS-COV-2 [131] However, on July 9, Public Health England reported that the Delta variant in England had a case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.2%, while the Alpha variant's case fatality rate was 1.9%, although the report warns that \"case fatality rates are not comparable across variants as they have peaked at different points in the pandemic, and so vary in background hospital pressure, vaccination availability and rates and case profiles, treatment options, and impact of reporting delay, among other factors.\" [132] James McCreadie, a spokesperson for Public Health England, clarified \"It is too early to assess the case fatality ratio compared to other variants.\" [133]\n\n\nStatistics\nThe chance of detecting  a Delta case varies significantly, especially depending on a country's sequencing rate (less than 0.05% of all COVID-19 cases have been sequenced in the lowest-sequencing countries to around 50 percent in the highest) [136] [137]\n\n\nHistory\nThe first cases of the variant outside India were detected in late February 2021, including the United Kingdom on 22 February, the United States on 23 February and Singapore on 26 February [195] [40] [138]\n\n\nGovernment responses\nAfter the rise in cases from the second wave, at least 20 countries imposed travel bans and restrictions on passengers from India in April and May UK prime minister Boris Johnson cancelled his visit to India twice, while Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga postponed his April trip [215] [216] [217]\n\n\nExtinction\nIn October 2021, Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health and Security Agency stated that previous circulating variants such as Alpha had 'disappeared' and replaced by the Delta variant [236] In March 2022, the World Health Organization listed the Alpha, Beta and Gamma variants as previously circulating citing lack of any detected cases in the prior weeks and months, in part due to the dominance of the Delta variant and subsequent Omicron variant [237] However within a few months the Delta variant was listed as a previously circulated variant with countries such as Australia going 12 weeks without any detections of Delta [4]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**SARS-CoV-2 Delta

Given that Alpha is already 150% as transmissible as the original SARS-CoV-2 strain that emerged in late 2019 in Wuhan, and if Delta is 150% as transmissible as Alpha, then Delta may be 225% as transmissible as the original strain.\n\n**Transmissibility**\n\nThe basic reproduction number (R0) for the first detected SARS-CoV-2 virus is 2.4-2.6, whereas Alpha's reproduction number is 4-5 and Delta's is 5-9. These basic reproduction numbers can be compared to MERS (0.29-0.80), seasonal influenza (1.2-1.4), Ebola (1.4-1.8), common cold (2-3), SARS (2-4), smallpox (3.5-6), and chickenpox (10-12). Due to Delta's high transmissibility, even those who are vaccinated are vulnerable, albeit to a lesser extent.\n\n**Infection age groups**\n\nSurveillance data from the Indian government's Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) shows that around 32% of patients, both hospitalized and outside hospitals, were aged below 30 in the second wave compared to 31% during the first wave. Hospitalization in the 20-39 bracket increased to 25.5% from 23.7% while the 0-19 range increased to 5.8% from 4.2%. The data also showed a higher proportion of asymptomatic patients were admitted during the second wave, with more complaints of breathlessness.\n\n**Virulence**\n\nA few early studies suggest the Delta variant causes more severe illness than other strains. On June 7, 2021, researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases in Singapore posted a paper suggesting that patients testing positive for Delta are more likely to develop pneumonia and/or require oxygen than patients with wild type or Alpha. On June 11, Public Health England released a report finding that there was \"significantly increased risk of hospitalization\" from Delta as compared with Alpha; the risk was approximately twice as high for those infected with the Delta variant.\n\n**Statistics**\n\nThe chance of detecting a Delta case varies significantly, especially depending on a country's sequencing rate (less than 0.05% of all COVID-19 cases have been sequenced in the lowest-sequencing countries to around 50 percent in the highest).\n\n**History**\n\nThe first cases of the variant outside India were detected in late February 2021, including the United Kingdom on February 22, the United States on February 23, and Singapore on February 26.\n\n**Government responses**\n\nAfter the rise in cases from the second wave, at least 20 countries imposed travel bans and restrictions on passengers from India in April and May. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson cancelled his visit to India twice, while Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga postponed his April trip.\n\n**Extinction**\n\nIn October 2021, Dr. Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health and Security Agency, stated that previous circulating variants such as Alpha had \"disappeared\" and replaced by the Delta variant. However, by March 2022, the World Health Organization listed the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma variants as previously circulating due to the dominance of the Delta variant and subsequent Omicron variant.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"SARS-CoV-2_Delta_variant\" following this outline:\n\n\nClassification\nThe Delta variant has mutations in the gene encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein [6] causing the substitutions D614G, T478K, P681R and L452R [29] [8] It is identified as the 21A, 21I, and 21J clades under the Nextstrain phylogenetic classification system [30]\n\n\nNames\nThe virus has also been referred to by the term \"Indian Variant\" [31] as it was originally detected in India However, the Delta variant is only one of three variants of the lineage B.1.617, all of which were first detected in India [32] At the end of May 2021, the WHO assigned the label Delta to lineage B.1.617.2 after introducing a new policy of using Greek letters for variants of concern and variants of interest [33]\n\n\nOther sublineages of B.1.617\nThere are three sublineages of lineage B.1.617 categorised so far.\n\n\nMutations\nThe Delta/ B.1.617.2 genome has 13 mutations (15 or 17 according to some sources, [which?] depending on whether more common mutations are included) which produce alterations in the amino-acid sequences of the proteins it encodes [40]\n\n\nLineages\nAs of August 2021, Delta variants have been subdivided in the Pango lineage designation system into variants from AY.1 to AY.28 However, there is no information on whether such classification correlates with biological characteristic changes of the virus [48] It is said that, as of August 2021, AY.4 to AY.11 are predominant in the UK, AY.12 in Israel, AY.2, AY.3, AY.13, AY.14, AY.25 in the US, AY.20 in the US and Mexico, AY.15 in Canada, AY.16 in Kenya, AY.17 in Ireland and Northern Ireland, AY.19 in South Africa, AY.21 in Italy and Switzerland, AY.22 in Portugal, AY.24 in Indonesia, and AY.23 in Indonesia, Singapore, Japan, and South Korea [49]\n\n\n\"Delta plus\" variant\nDelta with K417N originally corresponded to lineages AY.1 and AY.2, [50] subsequently also lineage AY.3, [51] and has been nicknamed \"Delta plus\" or \"Nepal variant\" [52] It has the K417N mutation, [53] which is also present in the Beta variant [54] The exchange at position 417 is a lysine-to-asparagine substitution [55]\n\n\nSymptoms\nThe most common symptoms may have changed from the most common symptoms previously associated with standard COVID-19 Infected people may mistake the symptoms for a bad cold and not realize they need to isolate Common symptoms reported have been headaches, sore throat, a runny nose or a fever [1] [medical citation needed] [2]\n\n\nPrevention\n: VE reduces <10%, or VE >90% without comparator\n: VE reduces between 10 and <20%\n\n\nTreatment\nIn vitro experiments suggest that bamlanivimab may not be effective against Delta on its own [85]  At high enough concentrations, casirivimab, etesevimab and imdevimab appear to still be effective  A preprint study suggests that sotrovimab may also be effective against Delta [86]  Doctors in Singapore have been using supplemental oxygen, remdesivir and corticosteroids on more Delta patients than they did on previous variants [87]\n\n\nEpidemiology\nUK scientists have said that the Delta variant is between 40% and 60% more transmissible than the previously dominant Alpha variant, which was first identified in the UK (as the Kent variant) [88] Given that Alpha is already 150% as transmissible as the original SARS-CoV-2 strain that emerged in late 2019 in Wuhan, [88] and if Delta is 150% as transmissible as Alpha, then Delta may be 225% as transmissible as the original strain [89] BBC reported that \n\n\n\n\nR\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle R_{0}}\n\n – basic reproduction number, or the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection – for the first detected SARS-CoV-2 virus is 2.4–2.6, whereas Alpha's reproduction number is 4–5 and Delta's is 5–9 [90] [91] These basic reproduction numbers can be compared to MERS (0.29-0.80 [92]), seasonal influenza (1.2–1.4 [93]), Ebola (1.4–1.8 [94]), common cold (2–3 [95]), SARS (2–4 [96]), smallpox (3.5–6 [97]), and chickenpox (10–12 [98]) Due to Delta's high transmissibility even those that are vaccinated are vulnerable, [99] albeit to a lesser extent [73]\n\n\nTransmissibility\nUK scientists have said that the Delta variant is between 40% and 60% more

hospitalization\" from Delta as compared with Alpha; [128] the risk was approximately twice as high for those infected with the Delta variant [129] On June 14, researchers from Public Health Scotland found that the risk of hospitalization from Delta was roughly double that of from Alpha [130] On July 7, a preprint study from epidemiologists at the University of Toronto found that Delta had a 120% greater – or more than twice as large – risk of hospitalization, 287% greater risk of ICU admission and 137% greater risk of death compared to non-variant of concern strains of SARS-COV-2 [131] However, on July 9, Public Health England reported that the Delta variant in England had a case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.2%, while the Alpha variant's case fatality rate was 1.9%, although the report warns that \"case fatality rates are not comparable across variants as they have peaked at different points in the pandemic, and so vary in background hospital pressure, vaccination availability and rates and case profiles, treatment options, and impact of reporting delay, among other factors.\" [132] James McCreadie, a spokesperson for Public Health England, clarified \"It is too early to assess the case fatality ratio compared to other variants.\" [133]\n\n\nStatistics\nThe chance of detecting  a Delta case varies significantly, especially depending on a country's sequencing rate (less than

that previous circulating variants such as Alpha had 'disappeared' and replaced by the Delta variant [236] In March 2022, the World Health Organization listed the Alpha, Beta and Gamma variants as previously circulating citing lack of any detected cases in the prior weeks and months, in part due to the dominance of the Delta variant and subsequent Omicron variant [237] However within a few months the Delta variant was listed as a previously circulated variant with countries such as Australia going 12 weeks without any detections of Delta [4]\n\n\nSee

He is the son of Steven Foster, a restaurant owner, and Gillian Kirwan, a woman described by Foster as a \"free-spirited, Vietnam-protesting hippie.\" Foster's younger brother, Jon, is also an actor.\n\nEarly Life\n\nFoster was born in Boston on October 29, 1980. His family relocated to Fairfield, Iowa in 1984 after their Boston home was broken into by robbers while they were present. This event had a significant impact on Foster's life, and he has spoken about the experience in interviews. Despite the challenges he faced, Foster's parents instilled in him a strong sense of creativity and individuality, which would later influence his acting career.\n\nCareer\n\nFoster began his acting career at the age of 16, with small roles in various television shows and films. His breakthrough role came in 1996 and 1997 when he starred in the Disney Channel television series Flash Forward. This was followed by his first major film role in the 1999 Barry Levinson film, Liberty Heights, which received critical acclaim.\n\nTodd McCarthy, a renowned film critic, described Foster's performance as \"outstanding\" and praised his ability to bring depth and nuance to his characters. This role marked the beginning of Foster's successful film career, with notable performances in films such as Get Over It (2001), Alpha Dog (2006), and The Mechanic (2011).\n\nIn addition to his film work, Foster has also appeared in various stage productions, including a Broadway production of Old Times in 2015. He has received critical acclaim for his performances, with many praising his ability to bring complexity and depth to his characters.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nFoster has been in several high-profile relationships, including with German actress Antje Traue, his co-star in the film Pandorum. Traue revealed in an interview that she had moved to Los Angeles to live with Foster, but their relationship ended around 2010.\n\nIn 2012, Foster began a relationship with actress Robin Wright, whom he became engaged to in 2014. However, they called off their engagement in November of the same year. Despite this, the couple reconciled in early 2015, only to announce their second engagement in August of the same year.

October, militants from Hamas broke into Israeli territory, killing over 1,000 Israelis, civilians and soldiers In response to this, Israel implemented a tightened complete blockade on Gaza, preventing the entry of any humanitarian aid on 9 October [26] By 18 October, Israel announced it would allow food, water, and medicine to be delivered to a \"safe zone\" in west Khan Younis in southern Gaza, distributed by the United Nations [27] Continued issues were seen with the delivery of aid into Gaza, with fluctuating numbers of trucks and aid parcels, destruction of convoy vehicles by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Israeli civilians and officials blocking aid in protests, and IDF statements that Hamas leadership was stockpiling and controlling the aid's distribution [28] [29] [30] [a] On 27 January, the International Court of Justice issued preliminary measures ordering Israel to \"enable the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance\" to Gaza [32] In late February, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch stated Israel was failing to comply with this order [32]\n\n\nEvent\nPer an IDF spokesperson at approximately 4:45 am, [60] eighteen [61] to thirty [62] humanitarian aid trucks that had been sent from surrounding countries arrived in northern Gaza after passing through the Kerem Shalom checkpoint on the southern-Gaza border with Israel [63] The Associated Press reported that it was not clear who had organized the delivery of aid A representative from Ummah Welfare Trust told Sky News their partners on the ground had liaised with the Israelis for the delivery [51] [64] The BBC reported that IDF tanks had escorted the trucks to the delivery location [65] The trucks began to travel through a humanitarian corridor that the IDF had secured A large group of Palestinians rushed toward the aid trucks [63] Per a local journalist who witnessed the incident, the large crowds had gathered to wait for the aid and food to be disbursed from the trucks [36]\n\n\nVictims\nInitial reports of the incident said that 50 people were killed The Palestinian Foreign Ministry confirmed the incident and said that 70 people died and at least 250 were wounded The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza later revised the death toll to least 112, with about 760 people injured [4] [80] Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations Riyad Mansour later told reporters that the death toll rose to 122, but his statement was unable to be verified [81]\n\n\nInvestigations\nOn the same day as the attack, Amnesty International announced it was launching an investigation, stating it \"is investigating this as part of its ongoing documentation of violations against Palestinian civilians\" [89] Several days after the attack, a senior crisis response adviser at Amnesty stated, \"There is concrete evidence that contradicts whatever statements are being made by the Israeli authorities\" [90]\n\n\nInternational\nUnited Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres condemned the incident, and said that the desperate citizens in Gaza need urgent help, including those in the north where the UN had been unable to provide aid in over a week [4] Doctors Without Borders released a statement: \"We consider Israel responsible for the situation of extreme deprivation and despair which prevails in Gaza — particularly in the north — which led to today’s tragic events.\" [136] Mercy Corps criticized the \"deliberate denial of humanitarian access into Gaza City\" and expressed \"horror at the unnecessary loss of life in Gaza as at least a hundred people are reportedly killed and many more injured at a food distribution in Gaza City\" [137] Paula Gaviria Betancur, the UN special rapporteur on the rights of displaced people, stated, \"I am horrified by the depravity of killing civilians while they are at their most vulnerable and seeking basic assistance These constitute atrocity crimes of the highest order\" [138]\n\n\nIsraeli Defense Forces\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said fewer than ten of the casualties directly resulted from Israeli fire [98] The IDF attributed many casualties to chaos and stampedes triggered by the arrival of aid trucks in northern Gaza, leading to numerous injuries [4] [63] [99] An IDF spokesman said that the army did not fire at the crowd at the head of the main aid convoy, but fired at the tail of the convoy hundreds of yards south The spokesman described them as rushing towards trucks and then approaching Israeli troops and a tank securing the road [16] IDF spokesman Peter Lerner stated, \"The tanks that were there to secure the convoy see the Gazans being trampled and cautiously tries to disperse the mob with a few warning shots.\" [62] The IDF spokesman stated that an officer in the area ordered soldiers to fire warning shots into the air and at the legs of those who continued to advance towards the checkpoint When asked about what constituted a threat to Israeli soldiers, Lerner said that anyone who approaches despite a warning is classified as a threat [68]\n\n\nPalestinian human rights organizations\nThree organizations, the Palestinian Center for Human Rights (PCHR), Al Mezan, and Al-Haq, issued a joint statement condemning the massacre Summarizing their conclusions based on interviews, video records, and contacting medical staff, they stated:\n\n\nCNN investigation\nCNN called the massacre the deadliest mass casualty event to have taken place in the Gaza Strip following Israel's operation, that cast doubt on Israel's version of events Their investigation collected dozens of testimonies and videos from several eyewitnesses, including some who had travelled from other parts of Gaza in order to bring their families something to eat When the aid convoy passed through an Israeli checkpoint, survivors said that Israeli forces began opening fire on the crowds that had gathered to reach the aid Multiple people said that if they did not die from the bullets, they would have died of hunger instead [11]\n\n\nReactions\nThe event became known as the \"flour massacre\", as named by the Palestinians [6]\n\n\nPalestinian\nPalestine President Mahmoud Abbas called the incident an \"ugly massacre\" that was perpetrated by the \"Israeli occupation army.\" [56] The Palestinian National Authority condemned the event, saying the civilians were merely trying to get food and much needed supplies and the IDF opened fire, killing innocent citizens and injuring hundreds [104] The Gaza Health Ministry said the incident was part of Israel's \"genocidal war\" and called for the international community to intervene to forge a ceasefire \"as the only way to protect civilians\" [17] Following the event, Hamas called it a \"heinous massacre added to the long series of massacres committed by the criminal Zionist entity against our Palestinian people\" [105] and threatened to stop the hostage negotiations [21]\n\n\nIsraeli\nIsraeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir praised the Israeli military saying \"Total support must be given to our heroic fighters operating in Gaza, who acted excellently against a Gazan mob that tried to harm them.\" He further stated the incident was \"another clear reason why we must stop transferring this aid.\" [70] [109] Eylon Levy, an Israeli spokesman from London, stated, \"My heart goes out to the civilians who got trampled in a stampede\" [110]\n\n\nInternational\nUnited Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres condemned the incident, and said that the desperate citizens in Gaza need urgent help, including those in the north where the UN had been unable to provide aid in over a week [4] Doctors Without Borders released a statement:

attacks\nOn March 3, 2024, at least 9 people were reportedly killed in an Israeli attack on an aid truck in Deir al-Balah On the same day, \"dozens of casualties\" were reported in another attack on food aid at the Kuwaiti roundabout in southern Gaza City [146]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Flour Massacre**\n\nThe Flour Massacre was a tragic event that occurred on 27 February 2024, in which dozens of civilians were killed and hundreds injured while attempting to access food aid in the Gaza Strip.

The festival is observed on the full moon day (Purnima) of the Hindu lunar calendar month of Shravana. It is a time for siblings to come together, strengthen their bond, and demonstrate their love and care for each other.\n\n# Etymology, Meaning, and Usage\n\nThe word \"Raksha\" is derived from the Sanskrit word \"rakṣikā,\" which means \"protection\" or \"amulet.\" The festival is also associated with the idea of protection and care, where a brother is expected to protect his sister from harm and provide her with love and support. The word \"Bandhan\" means \"tie\" or \"bond,\" referring to the thread or the ritual of tying the rakhi on the sister's wrist.\n\n# Traditional Regions of Observance\n\nRaksha Bandhan is primarily observed in northern India, particularly in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Punjab. However, the festival is also celebrated in other parts of India, including central India, western India, and Nepal. It is also observed in other countries with significant Hindu populations, such as Fiji, Pakistan, and Mauritius.\n\n# Evolution of Raksha Bandhan\n\nThe origins of Raksha Bandhan are shrouded in myth and legend. According to the Bhavishya Purana, a Hindu text, the festival was first observed by the Hindu god Krishna, who tied a rakhi on his right wrist to his brother Balarama. However, the festival has its roots in the ancient Indian practice of territorial exogamy, where a bride would marry out of her natal village or town, and her parents would not visit her in her married home.\n\n# Precedence in Hindu Texts\n\nThe Bhavishya Purana, a Hindu text, describes the ritual of Raksha Bandhan as a way for a brother to tie a rakhi on his sister's wrist to protect her from harm. The text also describes the significance of the rakhi as a symbol of the brother's love and care for his sister.\n\n# Relation to Territorial Exogamy\n\nRaksha Bandhan is rooted in the ancient Indian practice of territorial exogamy, where a bride would marry out of her natal village or town, and her parents would not visit her in her married home. The rakhi was a symbol of the brother's love and care for his sister, and the festival was a way for the siblings to come together and strengthen their bond.\n\n# Urbanization and Mid-20th Century Transformations\n\nWith the advent of urbanization and modernization, the traditional practices of Raksha Bandhan underwent significant transformations. The festival became more commercialized, with the sale of rakhis and other materials becoming a major industry. However, the core spirit of the festival remained the same, with siblings coming together to celebrate their bond and demonstrate their love and care for each other.\n\n# Voluntary Kin Relations\n\nIn modern times, the tradition of voluntary kin relations has been transformed, with the tying of rakhis becoming a way for people to form bonds and show their love and care for each other. This has cut across caste and class lines, as well as Hindu and Muslim divisions.\n\n# Regional Variations in Ritual\n\nDespite the standardized nature of the festival, there are significant regional variations in the way Raksha Bandhan is observed. In some parts of India, the festival is celebrated with great pomp and ceremony, while in others, it is a more low-key affair.\n\n# Depictions in Movies and Popular History\n\nRaksha Bandhan has been depicted in various movies and popular history, often with a focus on the mythological and symbolic aspects of the festival. However, the historical stories associated with the festival are often disputed, and some historians consider them to be apocryphal.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nRaksha Bandhan is a significant festival in Hindu culture, celebrated with great enthusiasm and devotion. It is a time for siblings to come together, strengthen their bond, and demonstrate their love and care for each other. Despite the commercialization and modernization of the festival, the core spirit of Raksha Bandhan remains the same, with the rakhi serving as a symbol of the brother's love and care for his sister.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Raksha_Bandhan\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology, meaning, and usage\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, Third Edition, 2008, the Hindi word, rākhī derives from the Sanskrit rakṣikā, a join: rakṣā protection, amulet ( < rakṣ- to protect + -ikā, diminutive suffix.)

{"title": "Russia", "content": "\nEtymology\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, the English name Russia first appeared in the 14th century, borrowed from Medieval Latin: Russia, used in the 11th century and frequently in 12th-century British sources, in turn derived from Russi, 'the Russians' and the suffix -ia [22] [23] In modern historiography, this state is usually denoted as Kievan Rus' after its capital city [24] Another Medieval Latin name for Rus' was Ruthenia [25]\n\n\nHistory\nThe first human settlement on Russia dates back to the Oldowan period in the early Lower Paleolithic About 2 million years ago, representatives of Homo erectus migrated to the Taman Peninsula in southern Russia [37] Flint tools, some 1.5 million years old, have been discovered in the North Caucasus [38] Radiocarbon dated specimens from Denisova Cave in the Altai Mountains estimate the oldest Denisovan specimen lived 195–122,700 years ago [39] Fossils of Denny, an archaic human hybrid that was half Neanderthal and half Denisovan, and lived some 90,000 years ago, was also found within the latter cave [40] Russia was home to some of the last surviving Neanderthals, from about 45,000 years ago, found in Mezmaiskaya cave [41]\n\n\nEarly history\nThe first human settlement on Russia dates back to the Oldowan period in the early Lower Paleolithic About 2 million years ago,

cave [41]\n\n\nKievan Rus'\nThe establishment of the first East Slavic states in the 9th century coincided with the arrival of Varangians, the Vikings who ventured along the waterways extending from the eastern Baltic to the Black and Caspian Seas According to the Primary Chronicle, a Varangian from the Rus' people, named Rurik, was elected ruler of Novgorod in 862 In 882, his successor Oleg ventured south and conquered Kiev, which had been previously paying tribute to the Khazars [62] Rurik's son Igor and Igor's son Sviatoslav subsequently subdued all local East Slavic tribes to Kievan rule, destroyed the Khazar Khaganate, [64] and launched several military expeditions to Byzantium and Persia [65] [66]\n\n\nGrand Duchy of Moscow\nThe destruction of Kievan Rus' saw the eventual rise of the Grand Duchy of Moscow, initially a part of Vladimir-Suzdal [71]: 11–20  While still under the domain of the Mongol-Tatars and with their connivance, Moscow began to assert its influence in the region in the early 14th century, [72] gradually becoming the leading force in the \"gathering of the Russian lands\" [73] [74] When the seat of the Metropolitan of the Russian Orthodox Church moved to Moscow in 1325, its influence increased [75] Moscow's last rival, the Novgorod Republic, prospered as the chief fur trade centre and the easternmost port of the Hanseatic League [76]\n\n\nTsardom of Russia\nIn development of the Third Rome ideas, the grand duke Ivan IV (\"the Terrible\") was officially crowned the first tsar of Russia in 1547 The tsar promulgated a new code of laws (Sudebnik of 1550), established the first Russian feudal representative body (the Zemsky Sobor), revamped the military, curbed the influence of the clergy, and reorganised local government [73] During his long reign, Ivan nearly doubled the already large Russian territory by annexing the three Tatar khanates: Kazan and Astrakhan along the Volga, [78] and the Khanate of Sibir in southwestern Siberia Ultimately, by the end of the 16th century, Russia expanded east of the Ural Mountains [79] However, the Tsardom was weakened by the long and unsuccessful Livonian War against the coalition of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (later the united Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth), the Kingdom of Sweden, and Denmark–Norway for access to the Baltic coast and sea trade [80] In 1572, an invading army of Crimean Tatars were thoroughly defeated in the crucial Battle of Molodi [81]\n\n\nImperial Russia\nUnder Peter the Great, Russia was proclaimed an empire in 1721, and established itself as one of the European great powers Ruling from 1682 to 1725, Peter defeated Sweden in the Great Northern War (1700–1721), securing Russia's access to the sea and sea trade In 1703, on the Baltic Sea, Peter founded Saint Petersburg as Russia's new capital Throughout his rule, sweeping reforms were made, which brought significant Western European cultural influences to Russia [89] He was succeeded by Catherine I (1725–1727), followed by Peter II (1727–1730), and Anna The reign of Peter I's daughter Elizabeth in 1741–1762 saw Russia's participation in the Seven Years' War (1756–1763) During the conflict, Russian troops overran East Prussia, reaching Berlin [90] However, upon Elizabeth's death, all these conquests were returned to the Kingdom of Prussia by pro-Prussian Peter III of Russia [91]\n\n\nGreat power and development of society, sciences, and arts\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars, Russia joined alliances with various European powers, and fought against France The French invasion of Russia at the height of Napoleon's power in 1812 reached Moscow, but eventually failed as the obstinate resistance in combination with the bitterly cold Russian winter led to a disastrous defeat of invaders, in which the pan-European Grande Armée faced utter destruction Led by Mikhail Kutuzov and Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly, the Imperial Russian Army ousted Napoleon and drove throughout Europe in the War of the Sixth Coalition, ultimately entering Paris [101] Alexander I controlled Russia's delegation at the Congress of Vienna, which defined the map of post-Napoleonic Europe [102]\n\n\nGreat liberal reforms and capitalism\nNicholas's successor Alexander II (1855–1881) enacted significant changes throughout the country, including the emancipation reform of 1861 [105] These reforms spurred industrialisation, and modernised the Imperial Russian Army, which liberated much of the Balkans from Ottoman rule in the aftermath of the 1877–1878 Russo-Turkish War [106] During most of the 19th and early 20th century, Russia and Britain colluded over Afghanistan and its neighbouring territories in Central and South Asia; the rivalry between the two major European empires came to be known as the Great Game [107]\n\n\nConstitutional monarchy and World War\nUnder last Russian emperor, Nicholas II (1894–1917), the Revolution of 1905 was triggered by the humiliating failure of the Russo-Japanese War [110] The uprising was put down, but the government was forced to concede major reforms (Russian Constitution of 1906), including granting freedoms of speech and assembly, the legalisation of political parties, and the creation of an elected legislative body, the State Duma [111]\n\n\nRevolution and civil war\nIn 1914, Russia entered World War I in response to Austria-Hungary's declaration of war on Russia's ally Serbia, [112] and fought across multiple fronts while isolated from its Triple Entente allies [113] In 1916, the Brusilov Offensive of the Imperial Russian Army almost completely destroyed the Austro-Hungarian Army [114] However, the already-existing public distrust of the regime was deepened by the rising costs of war, high casualties, and rumors of corruption and treason All this formed the climate for the Russian Revolution of 1917, carried out in two major acts [115] In early 1917, Nicholas II was forced to abdicate; he and his family were imprisoned and later executed during the Russian Civil War [116] The monarchy was replaced by a shaky coalition of political parties that declared itself the Provisional Government, [117] and proclaimed the Russian Republic On 19 January  [O.S 6 January], 1918, the Russian Constituent Assembly declared Russia a democratic federal republic (thus ratifying the Provisional Government's decision) The next day the Constituent Assembly was dissolved by the All-Russian Central Executive Committee [115]\n\n\nSoviet Union\nOn 30 December 1922, Lenin and his aides formed the Soviet Union, by joining the Russian SFSR into a single state with the Byelorussian, Transcaucasian, and Ukrainian republics [125] Eventually internal border changes and annexations during World War II created a union of 15 republics; the largest in size and population being the Russian SFSR, which dominated the union politically, culturally, and economically [126]\n\n\nCommand economy and Soviet society\nOn 30 December 1922, Lenin and his aides formed the Soviet Union, by joining the Russian SFSR into a single state with the Byelorussian, Transcaucasian, and Ukrainian republics [125] Eventually internal border changes and annexations during World War II created a union of 15 republics; the largest in size and population being the Russian SFSR, which dominated the union politically, culturally, and economically [126]\n\n\nStalinism and modernization\nUnder Stalin's leadership, the government launched a command economy, industrialisation of the largely rural country, and collectivisation of its agriculture During this period of rapid economic and social change, millions of people were sent to penal labour camps, including many political convicts for their suspected or real opposition to Stalin's rule; [131] and millions were deported and exiled to remote areas of the Soviet Union [132] The transitional disorganisation of the country's agriculture, combined with the harsh state policies and a drought, [133] led to the Soviet famine of 1932–1933; which killed 5.7 [134] to 8.7 million, 3.3 million of them in the Russian SFSR [135] The Soviet Union, ultimately, made the costly transformation from a largely agrarian economy to a major industrial powerhouse within a short span of time [136]\n\n\nWorld War II and United Nations\nThe Soviet Union entered World War II on 17 September 1939 with its invasion of Poland, [137] in accordance with a secret protocol within the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact with Nazi Germany [138] The Soviet Union later invaded Finland, [139] and occupied and annexed the Baltic states, [140] as well as parts of Romania [141]: 91–95  On 22 June 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union, [142] opening the Eastern Front, the largest theater of World War II [143]: 7 \n\n\nSuperpower and Cold War\nAfter World War II, according to the Potsdam Conference, the Red Army occupied parts of Eastern and Central Europe, including East Germany and the eastern regions of Austria [158] Dependent communist governments were installed in the Eastern Bloc satellite states [159] After becoming the world's second nuclear power, [160] the Soviet Union established the Warsaw Pact alliance, [161] and entered into a struggle for global dominance, known as the Cold War, with the rivalling United States and NATO [162]\n\n\nKhrushchev Thaw reforms and economic development\nAfter Stalin's death in 1953 and a short period of collective rule, the new leader Nikita Khrushchev denounced Stalin and launched the policy of de-Stalinization, releasing many political prisoners from the Gulag labour camps [163] The general easement of repressive policies became known later as the Khrushchev Thaw [164] At the same time, Cold War tensions reached its peak when the two rivals clashed over the deployment of the United States Jupiter missiles in Turkey and Soviet missiles in Cuba [165]\n\n\nPeriod of developed socialism or Era of Stagnation\nFollowing the ousting of Khrushchev in 1964, another period of collective rule ensued, until Leonid Brezhnev became the leader The era of the 1970s and the early 1980s was later designated as the Era of Stagnation The 1965 Kosygin reform aimed for partial decentralisation of the Soviet economy [168] In 1979, after a communist-led revolution in Afghanistan, Soviet forces invaded the country, ultimately starting the Soviet–Afghan War [169] In May 1988, the Soviets started to withdraw from Afghanistan, due to international opposition, persistent anti-Soviet guerrilla warfare, and a lack of support by Soviet citizens [170]\n\n\nPerestroika, democratization and Russian sovereignty\nFrom 1985 onwards, the last Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who sought to enact liberal reforms in the Soviet system, introduced the policies of glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring) in an attempt to end the period of economic stagnation and to democratise the government [171] This, however, led to the rise of strong nationalist and separatist movements across the country [172] Prior to 1991, the Soviet economy was the world's second-largest, but during its final years, it went into a crisis [173]\n\n\nIndependent Russian Federation\nThe economic and political collapse of the Soviet Union led Russia into a deep and prolonged depression During and after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, wide-ranging reforms including privatisation and market and trade liberalisation were undertaken, including radical changes along the lines of \"shock therapy\" [179] The privatisation largely shifted control of enterprises from state agencies to individuals with inside connections in the government, which led to the rise of Russian oligarchs [180] Many of the newly rich moved billions in cash and assets outside of the country in an enormous capital flight [181] The depression of the economy led to the collapse of social services—the birth rate plummeted while the death rate skyrocketed, [182] [183] and millions plunged into poverty; [184] while extreme corruption, [185] as well as criminal gangs and organised crime rose significantly [186]\n\n\nTransition to a market economy and political crises\nThe economic and political collapse of the Soviet Union led Russia into a deep and prolonged depression During and after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, wide-ranging reforms including privatisation and market and trade liberalisation were undertaken, including radical changes along the lines of \"shock therapy\" [179] The privatisation largely shifted control of enterprises from state agencies to individuals with inside connections in the government, which led to the rise of Russian oligarchs [180] Many of the newly rich moved billions in cash and assets outside of the country in an enormous capital flight [181] The depression of the economy led to the collapse of social services—the birth rate plummeted while the death rate skyrocketed, [182] [183] and millions plunged into poverty; [184] while extreme corruption, [185] as well as criminal gangs and organised crime rose significantly [186]\n\n\nModern liberal constitution, international cooperation and economic stabilization\nIn December, a referendum was held and approved, which introduced a new constitution, giving the president enormous powers [188] The 1990s were plagued by armed conflicts in the North Caucasus, both local ethnic skirmishes and separatist Islamist insurrections [189] From the time Chechen separatists declared independence in the early 1990s, an intermittent guerrilla war was fought between the rebel groups and Russian forces [190] Terrorist attacks against civilians were carried out by Chechen separatists, claiming the lives of thousands of Russian civilians [e] [191]\n\n\nMovement towards a modernized economy, political centralization and democratic backsliding\nOn 31 December 1999, President Yeltsin unexpectedly resigned, [195] handing the post to the recently appointed prime minister and his chosen successor, Vladimir Putin [196] Putin then won the 2000 presidential election, [197] and defeated the Chechen insurgency in the Second Chechen War [198]\n\n\nInvasion of Ukraine\nIn early 2014, following a pro-Western revolution in Ukraine, Russia annexed Crimea from neighbouring Ukraine after a disputed referendum on the status of Crimea was staged under Russian occupation [206] [207] The annexation generated an insurgency in the Donbas region of Ukraine, supported by Russian military intervention as part of an undeclared war against Ukraine [208] Russian mercenaries and military forces, with the support of local separatist militias, waged a war in eastern Ukraine against the new Ukrainian government after the Russian government fostered anti-government and pro-Russian protests in the region, [209] although most residents had opposed secession from Ukraine [210] [211]\n\n\nGeography\nRussia's vast landmass stretches over the easternmost part of Europe and the northernmost part of Asia [229] It spans the northernmost edge of Eurasia; and has the world's fourth-longest coastline, of over 37,653 km (23,396 mi) [f] [231] Russia lies between latitudes 41° and 82° N, and longitudes 19° E and 169° W, extending some 9,000 km (5,600 mi) east to west, and 2,500 to 4,000 km (1,600 to 2,500 mi) north to south [232] Russia, by landmass, is larger than three continents, [g] and has the same surface area as Pluto [233]\n\n\nClimate\nThe size of Russia and the remoteness of many of its areas from the sea result in the dominance of the humid continental climate throughout most of the country, except for the tundra and the extreme southwest Mountain ranges in the south and east obstruct the flow of warm air masses from the Indian and Pacific oceans, while the European Plain spanning its west and north opens it to influence from the Atlantic and Arctic oceans [246] Most of northwest Russia and Siberia have a subarctic climate, with extremely severe winters in the inner regions of northeast Siberia (mostly Sakha, where the Northern Pole of Cold is located with the record low temperature of −71.2 °C or −96.2 °F), [239] and more moderate winters elsewhere Russia's vast coastline along the Arctic Ocean and the Russian Arctic islands have a polar climate [246]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nRussia, owing to its gigantic size, has diverse ecosystems, including polar deserts, tundra, forest tundra, taiga, mixed and broadleaf forest, forest steppe, steppe, semi-desert, and subtropics [251] About half of Russia's territory is forested, [9] and it has the world's largest area of forest, [252] which sequester some of the world's highest amounts of carbon dioxide [252] [253]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nRussia, by constitution, is a symmetric federal republic with a semi-presidential system, wherein the president is the head of state, [259] and the prime minister is the head of government [9] It is structured as a multi-party representative democracy, with the federal government composed of three branches: [260]\n\n\nPolitical divisions\nRussia, by 1993 constitution, is a symmetric (with the possibility of an asymmetric configuration) federation Unlike the Soviet asymmetric model of the RSFSR, where only republics were \"subjects of the federation\", the current constitution raised the status of other regions to the level of republics and made all regions equal with the title \"subject of the federation\" The regions of Russia have reserved areas of competence, but no regions have sovereignty, do not have the status of a sovereign state, do not have the right to indicate any sovereignty in their constitutions and do not have the right to secede from the country The laws of the regions cannot contradict federal laws [272]\n\n\nForeign relations\nRussia had the world's fifth-largest diplomatic network in 2019 It maintains diplomatic relations with 190 United Nations member states, four partially-recognised states, and three United Nations observer states; along with 144 embassies [283] Russia is one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council The country is generally considered  a great power, [284] [285] [286] though its status as a modern great power has been questioned following the struggles it has faced while invading Ukraine starting in 2022 [287] [288] Russia is also a former superpower as the leading constituent of the former Soviet Union [157] Russia is a member of the G20, the OSCE, and the APEC Russia also takes a leading role in organisations such as the CIS, [289] the EAEU, [290] the CSTO, [291] the SCO, [292] and BRICS [293]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Russian Armed Forces are divided into the Ground Forces, the Navy, and the Aerospace Forces—and there are also two independent arms of service: the Strategic Missile Troops and the Airborne Troops [9] As of 2021 [update], the military have around a million active-duty personnel, which is the world's fifth-largest, and about 2–20 million reserve personnel [313] [314] It is mandatory for all male citizens aged 18–27 to be drafted for a year of service in the Armed Forces [9]\n\n\nHuman rights\nViolations of human rights in Russia have been increasingly reported by leading democracy and human rights groups In particular, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch say that Russia is not democratic and allows few political rights and civil liberties to its citizens [321] [322]\n\n\nCorruption\nRussia's political system has been variously described as a kleptocracy, [346] an oligarchy, [347] and a plutocracy [348] It was the lowest rated European country in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index for 2023, ranking 141th out of 180 countries [349] Russia has a long history of corruption, which is seen as a significant problem [350] It affects various sectors, including the economy, [351] business, [352] public administration, [353] law enforcement, [354] healthcare, [355] [356] education, [357] and the military [358]\n\n\nLaw and

legal sources of Russian law [359] [360] [361]\n\n\nEconomy\nRussia has a mixed market economy, following a turbulent transition from the Soviet planned model during the 1990s [366] Much of the country's economic activity is centered on its abundant and varied natural resources, particularly oil and natural gas [367] Russia is classified by the World Bank as a high-income country, [368] with the world's ninth-largest economy by nominal GDP and the sixth-largest by PPP; by some measures, its economy ranks fourth or fifth in the world by PPP [369] Services account for roughly 54% of total

railway tracks is the world's third-longest, exceeding 87,000 km (54,100 mi) [390] As of 2019 [update], Russia has the world's fifth-largest road network, with over 1.5 million km of roads, [391] although its road density is among the world's lowest, due in part to its vast land area [392] Russia's inland waterways are the world's longest, totaling 102,000 km (63,380 mi) [393] Russia has over 900 airports, [394] ranking seventh in the world, of which the busiest is Sheremetyevo International Airport in Moscow Russia's largest port is the Port of Novorossiysk in Krasnodar Krai along the Black Sea [395]\n\n\nAgriculture and fishery\nRussia's agriculture sector contributes about 5% of the country's total GDP, although the sector employs about one-eighth of the total labour force [423] It has the world's third-largest cultivated area, at 1,265,267 square kilometres (488,522 sq mi) However, due to the harshness of its environment, only about 13.1% of its land is agricultural, [9] with an additional 7.4% being arable [424] The country's agricultural land is considered part of the \"breadbasket\" of Europe [425] More than one-third of the sown area is devoted to fodder crops, and the remaining farmland is used industrial crops, vegetables, and fruits [423] The main product of Russian farming has always been grain, which occupies well over half the cropland [423] Russia is the world's largest exporter of wheat, [426] [427] the largest producer of barley and buckwheat, among the largest exporters of maize and sunflower oil, and the leading producer of fertilizer [428]\n\n\nScience and technology\nRussia spent about 1% of its GDP on research and development in 2019, with the world's tenth-highest budget [431] It also ranked tenth worldwide in the number of scientific publications in 2020, with roughly 1.3 million papers [432] Since 1904, Nobel Prize were awarded to 26 Soviets and Russians in physics, chemistry, medicine, economy, literature and peace [433] Russia ranked 60th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024, down from 45th in 2021 [434] [435]\n\n\nSpace exploration\nRoscosmos is Russia's national space agency The country's achievements in the field of space technology and space exploration can be traced back to Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, the father of theoretical astronautics, whose works had inspired leading Soviet rocket engineers, such as Sergey Korolyov, Valentin Glushko, and many others who contributed to the success of the Soviet space program in the early stages of the Space Race and beyond [452]: 6–7, 333 \n\n\nTourism\nAccording to the World Tourism Organization, Russia was the sixteenth-most visited country in the world, and the tenth-most visited country in Europe, in 2018, with over

With a land area of approximately 17.1 million square kilometers (6.6 million square miles), it is the world's largest country by land area and has the world's ninth-largest economy by nominal GDP. Russia shares its borders with 14 countries and is home to a diverse population of over 145 million people.\n\nEtymology\n----------\n\nThe English name Russia was first used in the 14th century and is derived from the Medieval Latin word \"Russia,\" which in turn came from the Old Norse word \"Rúss\". The name initially referred to the Eastern Slavs, particularly the inhabitants of the Kievan Rus', a medieval East Slavic state that existed from the 9th to the 13th century.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Early History\n\nThe first human settlement on Russia dates back to the Oldowan period in the early Lower Paleolithic, approximately 2 million years ago. Representatives of Homo erectus migrated to the Taman Peninsula in southern Russia, and Flint tools, some 1.5 million years old, have been discovered in the North Caucasus.\n\n### Kievan Rus'\n\nThe establishment of the first East Slavic states in the 9th century coincided with the arrival of Varangians, the Vikings who ventured along the waterways extending from the eastern Baltic to the Black and Caspian Seas. According to the Primary Chronicle, a Varangian from the Rus' people, named Rurik, was elected ruler of Novgorod in 862. His successor, Oleg, ventured south and conquered Kiev, which had been previously paying tribute to the Khazars.\n\n### Grand Duchy of Moscow\n\nThe destruction of Kievan Rus' saw the eventual rise of the Grand Duchy of Moscow, initially a part of Vladimir-Suzdal. While still under the domain of the Mongol-Tatars and with their connivance, Moscow began to assert its influence in the region in the early 14th century, gradually becoming the leading force in the \"gathering of the Russian lands\".\n\n### Tsardom of Russia\n\nIn development of the Third Rome ideas, the grand duke Ivan IV (\"the Terrible\") was officially crowned the first tsar of Russia in 1547.

the early Lower Paleolithic About 2 million years ago, representatives of Homo erectus migrated to the Taman Peninsula in southern Russia [37] Flint tools, some 1.5 million years old, have been discovered in the North Caucasus [38] Radiocarbon dated specimens from Denisova Cave in the Altai Mountains estimate the oldest Denisovan specimen lived 195–122,700 years ago [39] Fossils of Denny, an archaic human hybrid that was half Neanderthal and half Denisovan, and lived some 90,000 years ago, was also found within the latter cave [40] Russia was home to some of the last surviving Neanderthals, from about 45,000 years ago, found in Mezmaiskaya cave [41]\n\n\nEarly history\nThe first human settlement on Russia dates back to the Oldowan period in the early Lower Paleolithic About

found in Mezmaiskaya cave [41]\n\n\nKievan Rus'\nThe establishment of the first East Slavic states in the 9th century coincided with the arrival of Varangians, the Vikings who ventured along the waterways extending from the eastern Baltic to the Black and Caspian Seas According to the Primary Chronicle, a Varangian from the Rus' people, named Rurik, was elected ruler of Novgorod in 862 In 882, his successor Oleg ventured south and conquered Kiev, which had been previously paying tribute to the Khazars [62] Rurik's son Igor and Igor's son Sviatoslav subsequently subdued all local East Slavic tribes to Kievan rule, destroyed the Khazar Khaganate, [64] and launched several military expeditions to Byzantium and Persia [65] [66]\n\n\nGrand Duchy of Moscow\nThe destruction of Kievan Rus' saw the eventual rise of the Grand Duchy of Moscow, initially a part of Vladimir-Suzdal [71]: 11–20  While still under the domain of the Mongol-Tatars and with their connivance, Moscow began to assert its influence in the region in the early 14th century, [72] gradually becoming the leading force in the \"gathering of the Russian lands\" [73] [74] When the seat of the Metropolitan of the Russian Orthodox Church moved to Moscow in 1325, its influence increased [75] Moscow's last rival, the Novgorod Republic, prospered as the chief fur trade centre and the easternmost port of the Hanseatic League [76]\n\n\nTsardom of Russia\nIn development of the Third Rome ideas, the grand duke Ivan IV (\"the Terrible\") was officially crowned the first tsar of Russia in 1547 The tsar promulgated a new code of laws (Sudebnik of 1550), established the first Russian feudal representative body (the Zemsky Sobor), revamped the military, curbed the influence of the clergy, and reorganised local government [73] During his long reign, Ivan nearly doubled the already large Russian territory by annexing the three Tatar khanates: Kazan and Astrakhan along the Volga, [78] and the Khanate of Sibir in southwestern Siberia Ultimately, by the end of the 16th century, Russia expanded east of the Ural Mountains [79] However, the Tsardom was weakened by the long and unsuccessful Livonian War against the coalition of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (later the united Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth), the Kingdom of Sweden, and Denmark–Norway for access to the Baltic coast and sea trade [80] In 1572, an invading army of Crimean Tatars were thoroughly defeated in the crucial Battle of Molodi [81]\n\n\nImperial Russia\nUnder Peter the Great, Russia was proclaimed an empire in 1721, and established itself as one of the European great powers Ruling from 1682 to 1725, Peter defeated Sweden in the Great Northern War (1700–1721), securing Russia's access to the sea and sea trade In 1703, on the Baltic Sea, Peter founded Saint Petersburg as Russia's new capital Throughout his rule, sweeping reforms were made, which brought significant Western European cultural influences to Russia [89] He was succeeded by Catherine I (1725–1727), followed by Peter II (1727–1730), and Anna The reign of Peter I's daughter Elizabeth in 1741–1762 saw Russia's participation in the Seven Years' War (1756–1763) During the conflict, Russian troops overran East Prussia, reaching Berlin [90] However, upon Elizabeth's death, all these conquests were returned to the Kingdom of Prussia by pro-Prussian Peter III of Russia [91]\n\n\nGreat power and development of society, sciences, and arts\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars, Russia joined alliances with various European powers, and fought against France The French invasion of Russia at the height of Napoleon's power in 1812 reached Moscow, but eventually failed as the obstinate resistance in combination with the bitterly cold Russian winter led to a disastrous defeat of invaders, in which the pan-European Grande Armée faced utter destruction Led by Mikhail Kutuzov and Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly, the Imperial Russian Army ousted Napoleon and drove throughout Europe in the War of the Sixth Coalition, ultimately entering Paris [101] Alexander I controlled Russia's delegation at the Congress of Vienna, which defined the map of post-Napoleonic Europe [102]\n\n\nGreat liberal reforms and capitalism\nNicholas's successor Alexander II (1855–1881) enacted significant changes throughout the country, including the emancipation reform of 1861 [105] These reforms spurred industrialisation, and modernised the Imperial Russian Army, which liberated much of the Balkans from Ottoman rule in the aftermath of the 1877–1878 Russo-Turkish War [106] During most of the 19th and early 20th century, Russia and Britain colluded over Afghanistan and its neighbouring territories in Central and South Asia; the rivalry between the two major European empires came to be known as the Great Game [107]\n\n\nConstitutional monarchy and World War\nUnder last Russian emperor, Nicholas II (1894–1917), the Revolution of 1905 was triggered by the humiliating failure of the Russo-Japanese War [110] The uprising was put down, but the government was forced to concede major reforms (Russian Constitution of 1906), including granting freedoms of speech and assembly, the legalisation of political parties, and the creation of an elected legislative body, the State Duma [111]\n\n\nRevolution and civil war\nIn 1914, Russia entered World War I in response to Austria-Hungary's declaration of war on Russia's ally Serbia, [112] and fought across multiple fronts while isolated from its Triple Entente allies [113] In 1916, the Brusilov Offensive of the Imperial Russian Army almost completely destroyed the Austro-Hungarian Army [114] However, the already-existing public distrust of the regime was deepened by the rising costs of war, high casualties, and rumors of corruption and treason All this formed the climate for the Russian Revolution of 1917, carried out in two major acts [115] In early 1917, Nicholas II was forced to abdicate; he and his family were imprisoned and later executed during the Russian Civil War [116] The monarchy was replaced by a shaky coalition of political parties that declared itself the Provisional Government, [117] and proclaimed the Russian Republic On 19 January  [O.S 6 January], 1918, the Russian Constituent Assembly declared Russia a democratic federal republic (thus ratifying the Provisional Government's decision) The next day the Constituent Assembly was dissolved by the All-Russian Central Executive Committee [115]\n\n\nSoviet Union\nOn 30 December 1922, Lenin and his aides formed the Soviet Union, by joining the Russian SFSR into a single state with the Byelorussian, Transcaucasian, and Ukrainian republics [125] Eventually internal border changes and annexations during World War II created a union of 15 republics; the largest in size and population being the Russian SFSR, which dominated the union politically, culturally, and economically [126]\n\n\nCommand economy and Soviet society\nOn 30 December 1922, Lenin and his aides formed the Soviet Union, by joining the Russian SFSR into a single state with the Byelorussian, Transcaucasian, and Ukrainian republics [125] Eventually internal border changes and annexations during World War II created a union of 15 republics; the largest in size and population being the Russian SFSR, which dominated the union politically, culturally, and economically [126]\n\n\nStalinism and modernization\nUnder Stalin's leadership, the government launched a command economy, industrialisation of the largely rural country, and collectivisation of its agriculture During this period of rapid economic and social change, millions of people were sent to penal labour camps, including many political convicts for their suspected or real opposition to Stalin's rule; [131] and millions were deported and exiled to remote areas of the Soviet Union [132] The transitional disorganisation of the country's agriculture, combined with the harsh state policies and a drought, [133] led to the Soviet famine of 1932–1933; which killed 5.7 [134] to 8.7 million, 3.3 million of them in the Russian SFSR [135] The Soviet Union, ultimately, made the costly transformation from a largely agrarian economy to a major industrial powerhouse within a short span of time [136]\n\n\nWorld War II and United Nations\nThe Soviet Union entered World War II on 17 September 1939 with its invasion of Poland, [137] in accordance with a secret protocol within the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact with Nazi Germany [138] The Soviet Union later invaded Finland, [139] and occupied and annexed the Baltic states, [140] as well as parts of Romania [141]: 91–95  On 22 June 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union, [142] opening the Eastern Front, the largest theater of World War II [143]: 7 \n\n\nSuperpower and Cold War\nAfter World War II, according to the Potsdam Conference, the Red Army occupied parts of Eastern and Central Europe, including East Germany and the eastern regions of Austria [158] Dependent communist governments were installed in the Eastern Bloc satellite states [159] After becoming the world's second nuclear power, [160] the Soviet Union established the Warsaw Pact alliance, [161] and entered into a struggle for global dominance, known as the Cold War, with the rivalling United States and NATO [162]\n\n\nKhrushchev Thaw reforms and economic development\nAfter Stalin's death in 1953 and a short period of collective rule, the new leader Nikita Khrushchev denounced Stalin and launched the policy of de-Stalinization, releasing many political prisoners from the Gulag labour camps [163] The general easement of repressive policies became known later as the Khrushchev Thaw [164] At the same time, Cold War tensions reached its peak when the two rivals clashed over the deployment of the United States Jupiter missiles in Turkey and Soviet missiles in Cuba [165]\n\n\nPeriod of developed socialism or Era of Stagnation\nFollowing the ousting of Khrushchev in 1964, another period of collective rule ensued, until Leonid Brezhnev became the leader The era of the 1970s and the early 1980s was later designated as the Era of Stagnation The 1965 Kosygin reform aimed for partial decentralisation of the Soviet economy [168] In 1979, after a communist-led revolution in Afghanistan, Soviet forces invaded the country, ultimately starting the Soviet–Afghan War [169] In May 1988, the Soviets started to withdraw from Afghanistan, due to international opposition, persistent anti-Soviet guerrilla warfare, and a lack of support by Soviet citizens [170]\n\n\nPerestroika, democratization and Russian sovereignty\nFrom 1985 onwards, the last Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who sought to enact liberal reforms in the Soviet system, introduced the policies of glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring) in an attempt to end the period of economic stagnation and to democratise the government [171] This, however, led to the rise of strong nationalist and separatist movements across the country [172] Prior to 1991, the Soviet economy was the world's second-largest, but during its final years, it went into a crisis [173]\n\n\nIndependent Russian Federation\nThe economic and political collapse of the Soviet Union led Russia into a deep and prolonged depression During and after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, wide-ranging reforms including privatisation and market and trade liberalisation were undertaken, including radical changes along the lines of \"shock therapy\" [179] The privatisation largely shifted control of enterprises from state agencies to individuals with inside connections in the government, which led to the rise of Russian oligarchs [180] Many of the newly rich moved billions in cash and assets outside of the country in an enormous capital flight [181] The depression of the economy led to the collapse of social services—the birth rate plummeted while the death rate skyrocketed, [182] [183] and millions plunged into poverty; [184] while extreme corruption, [185] as well as criminal gangs and organised crime rose significantly [186]\n\n\nTransition to a market economy and political crises\nThe economic and political collapse of the Soviet Union led Russia into a deep and prolonged depression During and after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, wide-ranging reforms including privatisation and market and trade liberalisation were undertaken, including radical changes along the lines of \"shock therapy\" [179] The privatisation largely shifted control of enterprises from state agencies to individuals with inside connections in the government, which led to the rise of Russian oligarchs [180] Many of the newly rich moved billions in cash and assets outside of the country in an enormous capital flight [181] The depression of the economy led to the collapse of social services—the birth rate plummeted while the death rate skyrocketed, [182] [183] and millions plunged into poverty; [184] while extreme corruption, [185] as well as criminal gangs and organised crime rose significantly [186]\n\n\nModern liberal constitution, international cooperation and economic stabilization\nIn December, a referendum was held and approved, which introduced a new constitution, giving the president enormous powers [188] The 1990s were plagued by armed conflicts in the North Caucasus, both local ethnic skirmishes and separatist Islamist insurrections [189] From the time Chechen separatists declared independence in the early 1990s, an intermittent guerrilla war was fought between the rebel groups and Russian forces [190] Terrorist attacks against civilians were carried out by Chechen separatists, claiming the lives of thousands of Russian civilians [e] [191]\n\n\nMovement towards a modernized economy, political centralization and democratic backsliding\nOn 31 December 1999, President Yeltsin unexpectedly resigned, [195] handing the post to the recently appointed prime minister and his chosen successor, Vladimir Putin [196] Putin then won the 2000 presidential election, [197] and defeated the Chechen insurgency in the Second Chechen War [198]\n\n\nInvasion of Ukraine\nIn early 2014, following a pro-Western revolution in Ukraine, Russia annexed Crimea from neighbouring Ukraine after a disputed referendum on the status of Crimea was staged under Russian occupation [206] [207] The annexation generated an insurgency in the Donbas region of Ukraine, supported by Russian military intervention as part of an undeclared war against Ukraine [208] Russian mercenaries and military forces, with the support of local separatist militias, waged a war in eastern Ukraine against the new Ukrainian government after the Russian government fostered anti-government and pro-Russian protests in the region, [209] although most residents had opposed secession from Ukraine [210] [211]\n\n\nGeography\nRussia's vast landmass stretches over the easternmost part of Europe and the northernmost part of Asia [229] It spans the northernmost edge of Eurasia; and has the world's fourth-longest coastline, of over 37,653 km (23,396 mi) [f] [231] Russia lies between latitudes 41° and 82° N, and longitudes 19° E and 169° W, extending some 9,000 km (5,600 mi) east to west, and 2,500 to 4,000 km (1,600 to 2,500 mi) north to south [232] Russia, by landmass, is larger than three continents, [g] and has the same surface area as Pluto [233]\n\n\nClimate\nThe size of Russia and the remoteness of many of its areas from the sea result in the dominance of the humid continental climate throughout most of the country, except for the tundra and the extreme southwest Mountain ranges in the south and east obstruct the flow of warm air masses from the Indian and Pacific oceans, while the European Plain spanning its west and north opens it to influence from the Atlantic and Arctic oceans [246] Most of northwest Russia and Siberia have a subarctic climate, with extremely severe winters in the inner regions of northeast Siberia (mostly Sakha, where the Northern Pole of Cold is located with the record low temperature of −71.2 °C or −96.2 °F), [239] and more moderate winters elsewhere Russia's vast coastline along the Arctic Ocean and the Russian Arctic islands have a polar climate [246]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nRussia, owing to its gigantic size, has diverse ecosystems, including polar deserts, tundra, forest tundra, taiga, mixed and broadleaf forest, forest steppe, steppe, semi-desert, and subtropics [251] About half of Russia's territory is forested, [9] and it has the world's largest area of forest, [252] which sequester some of the world's highest amounts of carbon dioxide [252] [253]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nRussia, by constitution, is a symmetric federal republic with a semi-presidential system, wherein the president is the head of state, [259] and the prime minister is the head of government [9] It is structured as a multi-party representative democracy, with the federal government composed of three branches: [260]\n\n\nPolitical divisions\nRussia, by 1993 constitution, is a symmetric (with the possibility of an asymmetric configuration) federation Unlike the Soviet asymmetric model of the RSFSR, where only republics were \"subjects of the federation\", the current constitution raised the status of other regions to the level of republics and made all regions equal with the title \"subject of the federation\" The regions of Russia have reserved areas of competence, but no regions have sovereignty, do not have the status of a sovereign state, do not have the right to indicate any sovereignty in their constitutions and do not have the right to secede from the country The laws of the regions cannot contradict federal laws [272]\n\n\nForeign relations\nRussia had the world's fifth-largest diplomatic network in 2019 It maintains diplomatic relations with 190 United Nations member states, four partially-recognised states, and three United Nations observer states; along with 144 embassies [283] Russia is one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council The country is generally considered  a great power, [284] [285] [286] though its status as a modern great power has been questioned following the struggles it has faced while invading Ukraine starting in 2022 [287] [288] Russia is also a former superpower as the leading constituent of the former Soviet Union [157] Russia is a member of the G20, the OSCE, and the APEC Russia also takes a leading role in organisations such as the CIS, [289] the EAEU, [290] the CSTO, [291] the SCO, [292] and BRICS [293]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Russian Armed Forces are divided into the Ground Forces, the Navy, and the Aerospace Forces—and there are also two independent arms of service: the Strategic Missile Troops and the Airborne Troops [9] As of 2021 [update], the military have around a million active-duty personnel, which is the world's fifth-largest, and about 2–20 million reserve personnel [313] [314] It is mandatory for all male citizens aged 18–27 to be drafted for a year of service in the Armed Forces [9]\n\n\nHuman rights\nViolations of human rights in Russia have been increasingly reported by leading democracy and human rights groups In particular, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch say that Russia is not democratic and allows few political rights and civil liberties to its citizens [321] [322]\n\n\nCorruption\nRussia's political system has been variously described as a kleptocracy, [346] an oligarchy, [347] and a plutocracy [348] It was the lowest rated European country in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index for 2023, ranking 141th out of 180 countries [349] Russia has a long history of corruption, which is seen as a significant problem [350] It affects various sectors, including the economy, [351] business, [352] public administration, [353] law enforcement, [354] healthcare, [355] [356] education, [357] and the military [358]\n\n\nLaw and crime\nThe primary and fundamental statement of laws in Russia is the Constitution of the Russian Federation Statutes, like the Russian Civil Code and the Russian Criminal Code, are the predominant legal sources of Russian law [359] [360] [361]\n\n\nEconomy\nRussia has a mixed market economy, following a turbulent transition from the Soviet planned model during the 1990s [366] Much of the country's economic activity is centered on its abundant and varied natural resources, particularly oil and natural gas [367] Russia is classified by the World Bank as a high-income country, [368] with the world's ninth-largest economy by nominal GDP and the sixth-largest by PPP; by some measures, its economy ranks fourth or fifth in the world by PPP [369] Services account for roughly 54% of total GDP, followed by industry (33%), while the agricultural sector is the smallest, at less than 4% of total GDP [370] Russia has a labour force of roughly 70 million, which is the world's eight-largest, [371] and a low official unemployment rate of 4.1% [372]\n\n\nTransport and energy\nRailway transport in Russia is mostly controlled by the state-run Russian Railways The total length of common-used railway tracks is the world's third-longest, exceeding 87,000 km (54,100 mi) [390] As of 2019 [update], Russia has the world's fifth-largest road network, with over 1.5 million km of roads, [391] although its road density is among the world's lowest, due in part to its vast land area [392] Russia's inland waterways are the world's longest, totaling 102,000 km (63,380 mi) [393] Russia has over 900 airports, [394] ranking seventh in the world, of which the busiest is Sheremetyevo International Airport in Moscow Russia's largest port is the Port of Novorossiysk in Krasnodar Krai along the Black Sea [395]\n\n\nAgriculture and fishery\nRussia's agriculture sector contributes about 5% of the country's total GDP, although the sector employs about one-eighth of the total labour force [423] It has the world's third-largest cultivated area, at 1,265,267 square kilometres (488,522 sq mi) However, due to the harshness of its environment, only about 13.1% of its land is agricultural, [9] with an additional 7.4% being arable [424] The country's agricultural land is considered part of the \"breadbasket\" of Europe [425] More than one-third of the sown area is devoted to fodder crops, and the remaining farmland is used industrial crops, vegetables, and fruits [423] The main product of Russian farming has always been grain, which occupies well over half the cropland [423] Russia is the world's largest exporter of wheat, [426] [427] the largest producer of barley and buckwheat, among the largest exporters of maize and sunflower oil, and the leading producer of fertilizer [428]\n\n\nScience and technology\nRussia spent about 1% of its GDP on research and development in 2019, with the world's tenth-highest budget [431] It also ranked tenth worldwide in the number of scientific publications in 2020, with roughly 1.3 million papers [432] Since 1904, Nobel Prize were awarded to 26 Soviets and Russians in physics, chemistry, medicine, economy, literature and peace [433] Russia ranked 60th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024, down from 45th in 2021 [434] [435]\n\n\nSpace exploration\nRoscosmos is Russia's national space agency The country's achievements in the field of space technology and space exploration can be traced back to Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, the father of theoretical astronautics, whose works had inspired leading Soviet rocket engineers, such as Sergey Korolyov, Valentin Glushko, and many others who contributed to the success of the Soviet space program in the early stages of the Space Race and beyond [452]: 6–7, 333 \n\n\nTourism\nAccording to the World Tourism Organization, Russia was the sixteenth-most visited country in the world, and the tenth-most visited country in Europe, in 2018, with over 24.6 million visits [465] According to Federal Agency for Tourism, the number of inbound trips of foreign citizens to Russia amounted to 24.4 million in 2019 [466] Russia's international tourism receipts in 2018 totaled $11.6 billion [465] In 2019, travel and tourism accounted for about 4.8% of country's total GDP [467] In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, tourism declined precipitously in 2020, to just over 6.3 million foreign visitors [468]\n\n\nDemographics\nRussia had a population of 144.7 million in 2021 (excluding Crimea and Sevastopol), [17] growing from 142.8 million in 2010 [475] It is the most populous country in Europe and ninth most populous in the world [476] With a population density of 8 inhabitants per square kilometre (21 inhabitants/sq mi), Russia is one of the world's most sparsely populated countries, [9] with the vast majority of its people concentrated within its western part [477] The country is highly urbanised, with two-thirds of the population living in towns and cities,\n\n\nLanguage\nRussian is the official and the predominantly spoken language in Russia [3] It is the most spoken native language in Europe, the most geographically widespread language of Eurasia, as well as the world's most widely spoken Slavic language [494] Russian is one of two official languages aboard the International Space Station, [495] as well as one of the six official languages of the United Nations [494]\n\n\nReligion\nRussia is constitutionally a secular state that officially enshrines freedom of religion [502] The largest religion is Eastern Orthodox Christianity, chiefly represented by the Russian Orthodox Church, [503] which is legally recognised for its \"special role\" in the country's \"history and the formation and development of its spirituality and culture.\" [502] Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Buddhism are recognised by Russian law as the \"traditional\" religions of the country constituting its \"historical heritage\" [504] [505]\n\n\nEducation\nRussia has an adult literacy rate of 100%, [516] and has compulsory education for a duration of 11 years, exclusively for children aged 7 to 17–18 [517] It grants free education to its citizens by constitution [518] The Ministry of Education of Russia is responsible for primary and secondary education, as well as vocational education; while the Ministry of Education and Science of Russia is responsible for science and higher education [517] Regional authorities regulate education within their jurisdictions within the prevailing framework of federal laws Russia is among the world's most educated countries, and has the sixth-highest proportion of tertiary-level graduates in terms of percentage of population, at 62.1% [519] It spent roughly 4.7% of its GDP on education in 2018 [520]\n\n\nHealth\nRussia, by constitution, guarantees free, universal health care for all Russian citizens, through a compulsory state health insurance program [526] The Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation oversees the Russian public healthcare system, and the sector employs more than two million people Federal regions also have their own departments of health that oversee local administration A separate private health insurance plan is needed to access private healthcare in Russia [527]\n\n\nCulture\nRussian writers and philosophers have played an important role in the development of European literature and thought [540] [541] The Russians have also greatly influenced classical music, [542] ballet, [543] sport, [544] painting, [545] and cinema [546] The nation has also made pioneering contributions to science and technology and space exploration [547] [548]\n\n\nHolidays\nRussia has eight—public, patriotic, and religious—official holidays [553] The year starts with New Year's Day on 1 January, soon followed by Russian Orthodox Christmas on 7 January; the two are the country's most popular holidays [554] Defender of the Fatherland Day, dedicated to men, is celebrated on 23 February [555] International Women's Day on 8 March, gained momentum in Russia during the Soviet era The annual celebration of women has become so popular, especially among Russian men, that Moscow's flower vendors often see profits of \"15 times\" more than other holidays [556] Spring and Labour Day, originally a Soviet era holiday dedicated to workers, is celebrated on 1 May [557]\n\n\nArt and architecture\nEarly Russian painting is represented in icons and vibrant frescos In the early 15th century, the master icon painter Andrei Rublev created some of Russia's most treasured religious art [566] The Russian Academy of Arts, which was established in 1757, to train Russian artists, brought Western techniques of secular painting to Russia [89] In the 18th century, academicians Ivan Argunov, Dmitry Levitzky, Vladimir Borovikovsky became influential [567] The early 19th century saw many prominent paintings by Karl Briullov and Alexander Ivanov, both of whom were known for Romantic historical canvases [568] [569] Ivan Aivazovsky, another Romantic painter, is considered one of the greatest masters of marine art [570]\n\n\nMusic\nUntil the 18th century, music in Russia consisted mainly of church music and folk songs and dances [588] In the 19th century, it was defined by the tension between classical composer Mikhail Glinka along with other members of The Mighty Handful, who were later succeeded by the Belyayev circle, [589] and the Russian Musical Society led by composers Anton and Nikolay Rubinstein [590] The later tradition of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, one of the greatest composers of the Romantic era, was continued into the 20th century by Sergei Rachmaninoff World-renowned composers of the 20th century include Alexander Scriabin,

Born in Sydney, Australia, Macdonald's background is a mix of Italian and Scottish heritage.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nDanielle Louise Macdonald was born in 1991, in Sydney. Raised in a multicultural family, Macdonald's early life was filled with the sounds and flavors of different cultures. Her parents, both of whom were artists, encouraged her to explore her creativity from a young age. Macdonald's interest in acting began when she was just a child, performing in school plays and local theater productions.\n\nMacdonald's education took her to various schools in Sydney, where she honed her acting skills and developed a passion for the craft. After completing her secondary education, Macdonald decided to pursue a career in acting, moving to Los Angeles to further her training.\n\n**Career**\n\nAt the age of 18, Macdonald made the bold decision to leave her family and friends behind, moving to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career. She was eager to learn and gain experience in the competitive world of Hollywood. Macdonald's first steps in the industry were marked by a string of auditions and rejections, but she persevered, determined to succeed.\n\nOne of Macdonald's earliest roles was in the ABC drama series \"Huge\", where she was originally booked to play the lead character, Becca Huffstatter. However, due to a visa issue, Macdonald was unable to secure the necessary paperwork in time, and the role was eventually filled by another actress.\n\nUndeterred, Macdonald continued to audition for roles, and her big break came when she landed the part of Sarah in the film \"The East\", which premiered at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival. The film, directed by Zal Batmanglij, was a critical and commercial success, and Macdonald's performance earned her widespread recognition and acclaim.\n\nSince then, Macdonald has appeared in a number of films and television shows, including \"Patti Cake$\", \"American Honey\", and \"Camp\". Her performances have been praised for their nuance and depth, and she has become known for her ability to bring complex characters to life on screen.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nMacdonald's personal life has been marked by both joy and tragedy. In 2019, she was personally affected by the catastrophic summer bushfires in Australia, which ravaged her family's hometown of Bateman's Bay. Macdonald's cousin's house was destroyed in the fires, and she and her family were forced to flee the area in a harrowing car journey that took 13 hours, rather than the usual three.\n\nDespite the challenges she has faced, Macdonald remains committed to her craft and her community. She has used her platform to raise awareness about social and environmental issues, and she has been an outspoken advocate for mental health and wellness.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* **The East** (2013) - Sarah\n* **Patti Cake$** (2017) - Jennifer\n* **American Honey** (2016) - Lovine\n* **Camp** (2013) - Alex\n* **Huge** (2010) - Becca Huffstatter (uncredited)\n\n**Television**\n\n* **Patti Cake$** (TV series, 2017) - Jennifer\n* **The Ranch** (TV series, 2016) - Alice\n\n**Music Video**\n\n* **Patti Cake$** (2017) - \"Ode to a Fish\"", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Danielle_Macdonald\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nDanielle Louise Macdonald, [citation needed] who is of Italian and Scottish heritage, [1] [2] was born in Sydney in 1991 [3] [4]\n\n\nCareer\nAt the age of 18, Macdonald moved to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career [6] She was originally booked for the role of Becca Huffstatter in the ABC drama series Huge, but her visa did not come in on time and she was unable to fill the role [7] Her first feature film was The East, which premiered at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival.\n\n\nPersonal life\nMacdonald was personally affected by the catastrophic summer bushfires in Australia over 2019–20 when her cousin's house burned down [20] While staying with family in Bateman's Bay over Christmas, Macdonald and her family fled to safety in a car journey that would normally have taken three hours but took 13 hours through the fire-ravaged region [20]\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\n\nFilm\n\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\n\nMusic Video\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

\"the messy and difficult world of politics\", but by December 2006, he expressed that he would like for Sara to run as his running mate in the 2007 mayoral elections due to his concern for corrupt politicians taking over and ruining his legacy [21] Sara Duterte was elected vice mayor in 2007 with over 330,000 votes, defeating lone opponent Jeff Ho and succeeding Luis Bonguyan [22] [23] Duterte served under her father for one term until 2010, and concurrently served as a regional officer of the National Movement of Young Legislators from 2007 to 2010 It was during this time when lawyer Zuleika T Lopez was first hired by Duterte to be a staff member of the city government, receiving the position of city council secretary [24]\n\n\nFirst term as mayor of Davao City (2010–2013)\nIn 2010, Duterte was elected mayor, becoming the first female mayor of the city, as well as being the youngest to have been elected, as she turned 32 years old just weeks after being proclaimed winner [26] She won over House Speaker Prospero Nograles, her father's political rival, in a lead of 200,000 votes in the 2010 elections Nograles earlier filed a protest at the Commission on Elections in Manila questioning the results, stating that there was a conspiracy of local poll officials [27] Vowing to be \"useful and to serve the country at all times\", she assumed the post that her father Rodrigo held for over 20 years [28] After Duterte appointed Zuleika T Lopez as city administrator a few days into her term, her decision was challenged by the city council led by Rodrigo, then the vice mayor of Davao, who argued that Lopez was unqualified for the position [29] [30] In response, Sara withdrew her request for the council's concurrence in Lopez's appointment and threatened to halt city hall's engagements with the city council, stating that the council \"should learn to respect\" her office as mayor [31]\n\n\nPolicies\nDuring her second stint as mayor, Duterte initiated Byaheng DO30, consisting of 30 projects addressing ten priority sectors which include \"education, health, poverty alleviation, infrastructure development, solid waste management and environment, agriculture,

addressing ten priority sectors which include \"education, health, poverty alleviation, infrastructure development, solid waste management and environment, agriculture, investment and tourism, traffic

eased as the number of cases lowered The local government also established COVID-19 testing centers and isolation facilities [64] [65] Her administration also oversaw the city's COVID-19 vaccination program when the national government began its vaccination program in early 2021 [66]\n\n\nVice presidency (2022–present)\nDuterte was considered by many political commentators as her father's successor after her role as a powerbroker in the 2019 midterm elections [67] [68] On July 7, 2021, the People's Reform Party (PRP) signaled their support early on for Duterte's potential presidential run, [69] with Duterte stating two days later that she was open to running for president [70] On September 9, she said she would not, since her father, the sitting president, would run for vice president, and they agreed that only one should run for a national position [71] However, he did not file his candidacy for vice president by October 2, [72] but she did not file a candidacy for any national position, running instead for reelection as mayor of Davao City [73] She later withdrew her candidacy for reelection as Davao City mayor on November 9 [74] Her brother Sebastian, incumbent

light weapons in Mindanao, as well as render educational support for junior government officers of the Philippines to study in Japan [111] [112]\n\n\nSecretary of Education (2022–2024)\nAs concurrent Education Secretary, Duterte was responsible for planning further the transition to the resumption of mandatory face-to-face classes at all basic education schools in the Philippines, which was put on hold since 2020 due to the risks brought out by the COVID-19 pandemic, for the school year 2022–2023 [118] She issued her first department order, the Department Order No 034 dated July 11, 2022,

talks with the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People's Army-National Democratic Front (CPP-NPA-NDF) After the Marcos administration agreed to resume peace talks with the CPP-NPA-NDF, in December 2023, she called the peace talks \"a pact with the devil\", warning that the communist rebels were insincere in reaching a settlement with the government [184]\n\n\nSouth China Sea territorial disputes\nDuterte has been noted for not issuing explicit statements on the dispute between the Philippines and China in the South China Sea She has declined to comment on the matter, instead deferring people to the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of National Defense when queried on such matters [185] [186] For this, she received criticism by some officials, including by allies of Marcos in the House of Representatives [187] [188] and Philippine Coast Guard spokesperson for the West Philippine Sea Jay Tarriela [189] [190] President Bongbong Marcos defended Duterte, saying \"that's not the role of the Vice President or the Secretary of Education to talk about China\" [191]\n\n\nApollo Quiboloy\nDuterte has expressed support for religious leader and her father's ally, Apollo Quiboloy, who had been indicted by the FBI and is the subject of various probes by the Philippine Senate and House of Representatives over allegations of sexual abuse and

November 2023 With her office proposing a budget of ₱10 million for the distribution of 200,000 copies to public schools as part of the OVP's \"PagbaBAGo\" campaign, the book has gained controversy [200] over the potential use of public funds to promote her own book and allegations of plagiarism due to similarities with Andy Runton's Owly: Just a Little Blue and the main character's similarities with Canva's graphics [201] The OVP has asserted the originality and copyright registration of the book [202] While intended for educational purposes, critics argued that the book serves as a political tool to enhance Duterte's image, a notion she denied by highlighting the book's focus on children who are not yet eligible to vote [203] Duterte later announced that she will write another book, this time about \"a friend's betrayal.\" [201]\n\n\nPersonal life\nDuterte met Manases \"Mans\" Carpio while she was attending San Beda College (now San Beda University); they married in Santuario de San Antonio, Forbes Park, Makati on October 27, 2007 [14] Although news reports have often mentioned that they have three children, [204] [205] [206] [207] Duterte had issued a statement in July 2024 mentioning that they have four children [2] Manases, a nephew of Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales and Supreme Court Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio, [208] [209] is a legal

Sara created a city task force for COVID-19 and other public health emergencies and instituted several measures to limit the spread of the disease and address the crisis.

The OVP has asserted the originality and copyright registration of the book. While intended for educational purposes, critics argued that the book serves as a political tool to enhance Sara's image, a notion she denied by highlighting the book's focus on children who are not yet eligible to vote.

($319,103; €284,813) to build a school in his home town of Bambali, Senegal [149] In March 2020, Mané donated £41,000 ($52,564; €46,083) to the national committee fighting COVID-19 in Senegal [150] In 2021, he donated £500,000 ($684,932; €561,987) towards the construction of a hospital in Bambali [151] In addition, he has also financed the building of a petrol station and a post office for his local community, supplying the school with free laptops and internet from the 4G internet service he financed in the village In total, he has spent more than £700,000 ($958,904; €786,782) on these upgrades In addition, he commissioned a €70-a-month stipend to each family in his 2,000-person hometown [152] [153] This is roughly equivalent to a month's wage for a Senegalese citizen on a minimum wage [154]\n\n\nPersonal life\nWhilst at Liverpool, Mané resided in Allerton, Liverpool, and has been burgled twice, once in November 2017 and again in February 2019 [156] [157] He is a practising Muslim and occasionally is seen making du'a before the start of each match [158]\n\n\nCareer statistics\nRed Bull Salzburg\n\n\nClub\nRed Bull Salzburg\n\n\nInternational\nRed Bull

2005, near the Lesser Antilles On August 23, the disturbance organized into Tropical Depression Twelve over the southeastern Bahamas The storm strengthened into Tropical Storm Katrina on the morning of August 24 The tropical storm moved towards Florida and became a hurricane only two hours before making landfall between Hallandale Beach and Aventura on the morning of August 25 The storm weakened over land, but it regained hurricane status about one hour after entering the Gulf of Mexico, and it continued strengthening over open waters On August 27, the storm reached Category 3 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale, becoming the third major hurricane of the season An eyewall replacement cycle disrupted the intensification but caused the storm to nearly double in size [4] Thereafter, Katrina rapidly intensified over the \"unusually warm\" waters of the Loop Current, from a Category 3 hurricane to a Category 5 hurricane in just nine hours [5]\n\n\nPreparations\nThe United States Coast Guard began pre-positioning resources in a ring around the expected impact zone and activated more than 400 reservists On August 27, it moved its personnel out of the New Orleans region prior to the mandatory evacuation [7] Aircrews from the Aviation Training Center, in Mobile, staged rescue aircraft from Texas to Florida [8] All aircraft were returning towards the Gulf of Mexico by the afternoon of August 29  Aircrews, many of whom lost their homes during the hurricane, began a round-the-clock rescue effort in New Orleans, and along the Mississippi and Alabama coastlines [9]\n\n\nFederal government\nThe United States Coast Guard began pre-positioning resources in a ring around the expected impact zone and activated more than 400 reservists On August 27, it

aircraft were returning towards the Gulf of Mexico by the afternoon of August 29  Aircrews, many of whom lost their homes during the hurricane, began a round-the-clock rescue effort in New Orleans, and along the Mississippi and Alabama coastlines [9]\n\n\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\nOn the afternoon of August 26, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) realized that Katrina had yet to make the turn toward the Florida Panhandle and ended up revising the predicted track of the storm from the panhandle to the Mississippi coast [16] The National Weather Service's New Orleans/Baton Rouge office issued a vividly worded bulletin on August 28 predicting that the area would be \"uninhabitable for weeks\" after \"devastating damage\" caused by Katrina, which at that time rivaled the intensity of Hurricane Camille [17] During video conferences involving the president later that day and on August 29, NHC director Max Mayfield expressed concern that Katrina might push its storm surge over the city's levees and flood walls In one conference, he stated, \"I do not think anyone can tell you with confidence right now whether the levees will be topped or not, but that's obviously a very, very great concern.\" [18]\n\n\nGulf Coast\nIn Florida, Governor Jeb Bush declared a state of emergency on August 24 in advance of Hurricane Katrina's landfall [19] By the following day, Florida's Emergency Operations Center was activated in Tallahassee to monitor the progress of the hurricane [20] Before Katrina moved ashore, schools and businesses were closed in the Miami area Cruise ships altered their paths due to seaports in southeastern Florida closing [21] Officials in Miami-Dade County advised residents in mobile homes or with special needs to evacuate To the north in Broward County, residents east of the Intracoastal Waterway or in mobile homes were advised to leave their homes Evacuation orders were issued for offshore islands in Palm Beach County, and for residents in mobile homes south of Lantana Road Additionally, a mandatory evacuation was ordered for vulnerable housing in Martin County [19] Shelters were opened across the region [22] Officials closed the Miami International Airport, [23] Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport, Key West International Airport, and Florida Keys Marathon Airport due to the storm In Monroe and Collier counties, schools were closed, and a shelter was opened in Immokalee [24]\n\n\nFlorida\nHurricane Katrina first made landfall between Hallandale Beach and Aventura, Florida on August 25 The storm dropped heavy rainfall in portions of the Miami metropolitan area, with a peak total of 16.43 in (417 mm) in Perrine As a result, local flooding occurred in Miami-Dade County, damaging approximately 100 homes Farther south in the Florida Keys, a tornado was spawned in Marathon on August 26 The tornado damaged a hangar at the airport there and caused an estimated $5 million in damage [52] The rains caused flooding, and the combination of rains and winds downed trees and power lines, leaving 1.45 million people without power Damage in South Florida was estimated at $523 million, mostly as a result of crop damage Twelve deaths occurred in South Florida, of which three were caused by downed trees in Broward County, three from drowning in Miami-Dade County, three were from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by generators, one was due to a vehicle accident, one occurred during debris cleanup, and one was associated with a lack of electricity.\n\n\nAlabama\nAlthough Hurricane Katrina made landfall well to the west, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle were both affected by tropical-storm-force winds and a storm surge varying from 12 to 16 feet (3.7–4.9 m) around Mobile Bay, [4] with higher waves on top Sustained winds of 67 mph (108 km/h) were recorded in Mobile, Alabama, and the storm surge there was approximately 12 feet (3.7 m) [4] The surge caused significant flooding several miles inland along Mobile Bay Four tornadoes were also reported in Alabama [4] Ships, oil rigs, boats and fishing piers were washed ashore along Mobile Bay: the cargo ship M/V Caribbean Clipper and many fishing boats were grounded at Bayou La Batre.\n\n\nLouisiana\nOn August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina made landfall near Buras-Triumph, Louisiana, with 125 mph (200 km/h) winds, as a strong Category 3 hurricane Although the storm surge to the east of the path of the eye in Mississippi was higher, a significant surge affected the Louisiana coast The height of the surge is uncertain because of a lack of data, although a tide gauge in Plaquemines Parish indicated a storm tide in excess of 14 feet (4.3 m), and a 12-foot (3.7 m) storm surge was recorded in Grand Isle The hurricane made its final landfall near the mouth of the Pearl River, with the eye straddling St Tammany Parish, Louisiana, and Hancock County, Mississippi, on the morning of August 29 at about 9:45 am CDT [4]\n\n\nImpact\nOn August 29, 2005, Katrina's storm surge caused 53 breaches to various flood protection structures in and around the greater New Orleans area, submerging 80% of the city A June 2007 report by the American Society of Civil Engineers indicated that two-thirds of the flooding was caused by the multiple failures of the city's floodwalls [42] The storm surge also devastated the coasts of Mississippi and Alabama, making Katrina one of the most destructive hurricanes, the costliest natural disaster in the history of the United States (tied with Hurricane Harvey in 2017), [43] and the deadliest hurricane since the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane The total damage from Katrina is estimated at $125 billion (2005 U.S dollars) [4] [44] However, in February 2021, a severe winter storm struck the United States, causing a major power failure in Houston, which caused at least $195 billion (2021 USD) in damage in Texas It surpassed both Katrina and Harvey to become the single-costliest natural disaster recorded in the United States [45]\n\n\nBahamas and Cuba\nBefore striking South Florida, Katrina traversed the Bahamas as a tropical storm However, minimal impact was reported, with only \"fresh breezes\" on various islands [49]\n\n\nUnited States\nHurricane Katrina first made landfall between Hallandale Beach and Aventura, Florida on August 25 The storm dropped heavy rainfall in portions of the Miami metropolitan area, with a peak total of 16.43 in (417 mm) in Perrine As a result, local flooding occurred in Miami-Dade County, damaging approximately 100 homes Farther south in the Florida Keys, a tornado was spawned in Marathon on August 26 The tornado damaged a hangar at the airport there and caused an estimated $5 million in damage [52] The

with a lack of electricity.\n\n\nLouisiana\nOn August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina made landfall near Buras-Triumph, Louisiana, with 125 mph (200 km/h) winds, as a strong Category 3 hurricane Although the storm surge to the east of the path of the eye in Mississippi was higher, a significant surge affected the Louisiana coast The height of the surge is uncertain because of a lack of data, although a tide gauge in Plaquemines Parish indicated a storm tide in excess of 14 feet (4.3 m), and a 12-foot (3.7 m) storm surge was recorded in Grand Isle The hurricane made its final landfall near the mouth of the Pearl River, with the eye straddling St Tammany Parish, Louisiana, and Hancock County, Mississippi, on the morning of August 29 at about 9:45 am CDT [4]\n\n\nNew Orleans\nAs the eye of Hurricane Katrina swept to the northeast, it subjected the city to hurricane conditions for hours Although power failures prevented accurate measurement of wind speeds in New Orleans, there were a few measurements of hurricane-force winds; based on this information, the NHC concluded that much of the city likely experienced sustained winds of Category 1 or 2 hurricane strength.\n\n\nMississippi\nThe Gulf coast of Mississippi suffered extremely severe damage from the impact of Hurricane Katrina on August 29, leaving 238 people dead, 67 missing, and billions of dollars in damage: bridges, barges, boats, piers, houses, and cars were washed inland [74] Katrina traveled up the entire state; as a result, all 82 counties in Mississippi were declared disaster areas for federal assistance, 47 for full assistance [74]\n\n\nAlabama\nAlthough Hurricane Katrina made landfall well to the west, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle were both affected by tropical-storm-force winds and a storm surge varying from 12 to 16 feet (3.7–4.9 m) around Mobile Bay, [4] with higher waves on top Sustained winds of 67 mph (108 km/h) were recorded in Mobile, Alabama, and the storm surge there was approximately 12 feet (3.7 m) [4] The surge caused significant flooding several miles inland along Mobile Bay Four tornadoes were also reported in Alabama [4] Ships, oil rigs, boats and fishing piers were washed ashore along Mobile Bay: the cargo ship M/V Caribbean Clipper and many fishing boats were grounded at Bayou La Batre.\n\n\nOther U.S. states\nNorthern and central Georgia were affected by heavy rains and strong winds from Hurricane Katrina as the storm moved inland, with more than 3 inches (76 mm) of rain falling in several areas At least 18 tornadoes formed in Georgia on August 29, 2005, the most on record in that state for one day in August The most serious of these tornadoes was an F2 tornado which affected Heard County and Carroll County This tornado caused three injuries and one fatality and damaged several houses The other tornadoes caused significant damages to buildings and agricultural facilities In addition to the fatality caused by the F2 tornado, there was another fatality in a traffic accident [77]\n\n\nCanada\nIn Canada, the remnants of Katrina brought rainfall amounts in excess of 3.94 in (100 mm) to many locations between the Niagara Peninsula and the Saint Lawrence River valley [82] Severe local flooding occurred in Quebec, forcing the evacuations of dozens of homes in some communities as rivers began overflowing their banks and sewage systems were becoming overwhelmed by the influx of precipitation Inundated and washed out roads, including Route 138 along the north shore of the Saint Lawrence River, Route 172 north of Tadoussac, and Route 385 near Forestville left several communities isolated for at least a week [83]\n\n\nAftermath\nThe economic effects of the storm reached high levels The Bush administration sought $105 billion for repairs and reconstruction in the region, [86] which did not account for damage to the economy caused by potential interruption of the oil supply, destruction of the Gulf Coast's highway infrastructure, and exports of commodities such as grain Katrina damaged or destroyed 30 oil platforms and caused the closure of nine refineries; [44] the total shut-in oil production from the Gulf of Mexico in the six-month period following Katrina was approximately 24% of the annual production and the shut-in gas production for the same period was about 18% [87] The forestry industry in Mississippi was also affected, as 1.3 million acres (5,300 km2) of forest lands were destroyed [88] The total loss to the forestry industry from Katrina is calculated to rise to about $5 billion [88] Furthermore, hundreds of thousands of local residents were left unemployed Before the hurricane, the region supported approximately one million non-farm jobs, with 600,000 of them in New Orleans It is estimated that the total economic impact in Louisiana and Mississippi may eventually exceed $150 billion [89] Forensic accountants were involved in the assessment of economic damages resulting from this catastrophe [90]\n\n\nEconomic effects\nThe economic effects of the storm reached high levels The Bush administration sought $105 billion for repairs

total economic impact in Louisiana and Mississippi may eventually exceed $150 billion [89] Forensic accountants were involved in the assessment of economic damages resulting from this catastrophe [90]\n\n\nEnvironmental effects\nKatrina also had a profound impact on the environment The storm surge caused substantial beach erosion, in some cases completely devastating coastal areas In Dauphin Island (a barrier island), approximately 90 mi (140 km) to the east of the point where the hurricane made landfall, the sand that comprised the island was transported across the island into the Mississippi Sound, pushing the island towards land [97] The storm surge and waves from Katrina also severely damaged the Chandeleur Islands, which had been affected by Hurricane Ivan the previous year [98] The US Geological Survey has estimated 217 sq mi (560 km2) of land was transformed to water by the hurricanes Katrina and Rita [99] Before the storm, subsidence and erosion caused loss of land in the Louisiana wetlands and bayous This, along with the canals built in the area, let Katrina keep more of its intensity when it struck [100] The lands that were lost were breeding grounds for marine mammals, brown pelicans, turtles, and fish, and migratory species such as redhead ducks [88] Overall, about 20% of the local marshes were permanently overrun by water as a result of the storm [88]\n\n\nReestablishing governance\nShortly after the hurricane moved away on August 30, 2005, some residents of New Orleans who remained in the city began looting stores Many were in search of food and water that were not available to them through any other means, as well as non-essential items [106] Additionally, there were reports of carjacking, murders, thefts, and rapes in New Orleans Some sources later determined that many of the reports were inaccurate, greatly exaggerated or completely false, leading news agencies to print retractions [107]\n\n\nGovernment response\nWithin the United States and as delineated in the National Response Plan, disaster response and planning is first and foremost a local government responsibility When local government exhausts its resources, it then requests specific additional resources from the county level The request process proceeds similarly from the county to the state to the federal government as additional resource needs are identified Many of the problems that arose developed from inadequate planning and back-up communication systems at various levels [119]\n\n\nCriticism\nThe criticisms of the government's response to Hurricane Katrina primarily consisted of criticism of mismanagement and lack of leadership in the relief efforts in response to the storm and its aftermath More specifically, the criticism focused on the delayed response to the flooding of New Orleans, and the subsequent state of chaos in the city [70] The neologism Katrinagate was coined to refer to this controversy, and was a runner-up for \"2005 word of the year\" [134]\n\n\nInternational response\nOver seventy countries pledged monetary donations or other assistance Cuba and Venezuela (both considered as hostile to US government interest) were the first countries to offer assistance, pledging over $1 million, several mobile hospitals, water treatment plants, canned food, bottled water, heating oil, 1,100 doctors and 26.4 metric tons of medicine, though this aid was rejected by the U.S government [142] [143] [144] [145] Kuwait made the largest single pledge, $500 million; other large donations were made by Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (each $100 million), South Korea ($30 million), Australia ($10 million), India, China (both $5 million), New Zealand ($2 million), [146] Pakistan ($1.5 million), [147] Norway ($1.8 million), [148] and Bangladesh ($1 million) [149]\n\n\nNon-governmental organization response\nThe American Red Cross, America's Second Harvest (now known as Feeding America), Southern Baptist Convention, Salvation Army, Oxfam, Common Ground Collective, Burners Without Borders, [154] Emergency Communities, Habitat for Humanity, Catholic Charities, Direct Relief, Service International, \"A River of Hope\", The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, [155] [156] [157] and many other charitable organizations provided aid to victims in the aftermath of the storm They were not allowed into New Orleans proper by the National Guard for several days after the storm because of safety concerns These organizations raised US$4.25 billion in donations from the public, with the Red Cross receiving over half of these donations [158] Some smaller organizations and individuals ignored the access restrictions and provided early relief For example, two privately chartered planes from FasterCures evacuated 200 patients from Charity Hospital in New Orleans [159]\n\n\nAnalysis of New Orleans levee failures\nAccording to a modeling exercise conducted by the U.S Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), two-thirds of the deaths in Greater New Orleans were due to levee and flood wall failure [167] On April 5, 2006, months after independent investigators had demonstrated that levee failures were not caused by natural forces beyond intended design strength, Lieutenant General Carl Strock, chief of engineers and commander of the Corps of Engineers, testified before the United States Senate Subcommittee on Energy and Water that \"We have now concluded we had problems with the design of the structure.\" [168]\n\n\nMedia involvement\nMany representatives of the news media reporting on the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina became directly involved in the unfolding events, instead of simply reporting Because of the loss of most means of communication, such as land-based and cellular telephone systems, field reporters in many cases became conduits for information between victims and authorities The authorities, who monitored local and network news broadcasts, as well as internet sites, would then attempt to coordinate rescue efforts based on the reports One illustration was when Geraldo Rivera of Fox News tearfully pleaded for authorities to either send help or evacuate the thousands of evacuees stranded at the Ernest N Morial Convention Center [179] The role of AM radio was also of importance to the hundreds of thousands of persons with no other ties to news, providing emergency information regarding access to assistance for hurricane victims Immediately after Katrina, WWL-AM was one of the few area radio stations in the area remaining on the air This emergency service, simulcasted on shortwave outlet WHRI, was named \"United Radio Broadcasters of New Orleans\" Their ongoing nighttime broadcasts continued to be available up to 500 mi (800 km) away Announcers continued to broadcast from improvised studio facilities after the storm damaged their main studios [180] The cellular phone antenna network was severely damaged and completely inoperable for several months.\n\n\nStudies concerning post-Katrina victims\nAn article published in the Community Mental Health Journal from January 2016 revealed information about a recent study on the psychosocial needs of Hurricane Katrina evacuees that temporarily resided in Dallas, Texas More than one-fourth of the sample met the criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) About one-third of the individuals received a referral to mental health services for meeting symptom criteria for incident MDD and PTSD [187]\n\n\nRetirement\nBecause of the high death toll and widespread property destruction along the U.S Gulf Coast, the name Katrina was retired from the Atlantic hurricane naming lists in April 2006 by the World Meteorological Organization The name will never again be used for another tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin It was replaced with Katia for the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season [190] [191]\n\n\nReconstruction\nReconstruction of each section of the southern portion of Louisiana has been addressed in the Army Corps LACPR (Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration) Final Technical Report, which identifies areas to not be rebuilt and areas where buildings need to be elevated [192]\n\n\nRecords\nKatrina is the costliest tropical cyclone on record, tying with Hurricane Harvey in 2017 [43] The storm was the fourth-most intense Atlantic hurricane on record to make landfall in the contiguous United States, behind the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Hurricane Camille in 1969, and Hurricane Michael in 2018 [193] Katrina was also the earliest eleventh named storm in the Atlantic until Tropical Storm Kyle surpassed it on August 14, 2020, beating Katrina by 10 days [194]\n\n\nSee also\nOther similar tropical cyclones:\n\n\nNotes\nDisaster recovery:\n\n\nReferences\nDisaster

tropical cyclone that struck the United States in August 2005, causing catastrophic damage and loss of life along the Gulf Coast, particularly in Louisiana and Mississippi. The storm was one of the deadliest and costliest natural disasters in U.S. history, with estimated damages exceeding $125 billion.\n\nMeteorological History\nHurricane Katrina originated from the merger of a tropical wave and the mid-level remnants of Tropical Depression Ten on August 19, 2005, near the Lesser Antilles. On August 23, the disturbance organized into Tropical Depression Twelve over the southeastern Bahamas. The storm strengthened into Tropical Storm Katrina on the morning of August 24. The tropical storm moved towards Florida and became a hurricane only two hours before making landfall between Hallandale Beach and Aventura on the morning of August 25. The storm weakened over land, but it regained hurricane status about one hour after entering the Gulf of Mexico and continued strengthening over open waters. On August 27, the storm reached Category 3 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale, becoming the third major hurricane of the season. An eyewall replacement cycle disrupted the intensification but caused the storm to nearly double in size. Thereafter, Katrina rapidly intensified over the \"unusually warm\" waters of the Loop Current, from a Category 3 hurricane to a Category 5 hurricane in just nine hours.\n\nPreparations\nThe United States Coast Guard began pre-positioning resources in a ring around the expected impact zone and activated more than 400 reservists. On August 27, it moved its personnel out of the New Orleans region prior to the mandatory evacuation. Aircrews from the Aviation Training Center, in Mobile, staged rescue aircraft from Texas to Florida. All aircraft were returning towards the Gulf of Mexico by the afternoon of August 29. Aircrews, many of whom lost their homes during the hurricane, began a round-the-clock rescue effort in New Orleans, and along the Mississippi and Alabama coastlines.\n\nFederal Government\nThe United States Coast Guard began pre-positioning resources in a ring around the expected impact zone and activated more than 400 reservists.

The National Weather Service's New Orleans/Baton Rouge office issued a vividly worded bulletin on August 28 predicting that the area would be \"uninhabitable for weeks\" after \"devastating damage\" caused by Katrina, which at that time rivaled the intensity of Hurricane Camille.\n\nGulf Coast\nIn Florida, Governor Jeb Bush declared a state of emergency on August 24 in advance of Hurricane Katrina's landfall. By the following day, Florida's Emergency Operations Center was activated in Tallahassee to monitor the progress of the hurricane. Before Katrina moved ashore, schools and businesses were closed in the Miami area. Cruise ships altered their paths due to seaports in southeastern Florida closing. Officials in Miami-Dade County advised residents in mobile homes or with special needs to evacuate. To the north in Broward County, residents east of the Intracoastal Waterway or in mobile homes were advised to leave their homes. Evacuation orders were issued for offshore islands in Palm Beach County, and for residents in mobile homes south of Lantana Road. Additionally, a mandatory evacuation was ordered for vulnerable housing in Martin County. Shelters were opened across the region. Officials closed the Miami International Airport, Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport, Key West International Airport, and Florida Keys Marathon Airport due to the storm. In Monroe and Collier counties, schools were closed, and a shelter was opened in Immokalee.\n\nFlorida\nHurricane Katrina first made landfall between Hallandale Beach and Aventura, Florida on August 25. The storm dropped heavy rainfall in portions of the Miami metropolitan area, with a peak total of 16.43 inches in Perrine. As a result, local flooding occurred in Miami-Dade County, damaging approximately 100 homes. Farther south in the Florida Keys, a tornado was spawned in Marathon on August 26. The tornado damaged a hangar at the airport there and caused an estimated $5 million in damage. The rains caused flooding, and the combination of rains and winds downed trees and power lines, leaving 1.45 million people without power. Damage in South Florida was estimated at $523 million, mostly as a result of crop damage. Twelve deaths occurred in South Florida, of which three were caused by downed trees in Broward County, three from drowning in Miami-Dade County, three were from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by generators, one was due to a vehicle accident, one occurred during debris cleanup, and one was associated with a lack of electricity.\n\nLouisiana\nOn August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina made landfall near Buras-Triumph, Louisiana, with 125 mph winds, as a strong Category 3 hurricane. Although the storm surge to the east of the path of the eye in Mississippi was higher, a significant surge affected the Louisiana coast. The height of the surge is uncertain because of a lack of data, although a tide gauge in Plaquemines Parish indicated a storm tide in excess of 14 feet, and a 12-foot storm surge was recorded in Grand Isle. The hurricane made its final landfall near the mouth of the Pearl River, with the eye straddling St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana, and Hancock County, Mississippi, on the morning of August 29 at about 9:45 am CDT.\n\nNew Orleans\nAs the eye of Hurricane Katrina swept to the northeast, it subjected the city to hurricane conditions for hours. Although power failures prevented accurate measurement of wind speeds in New Orleans, there were a few measurements of hurricane-force winds. Based on this information, the NHC concluded that much of the city likely experienced sustained winds of Category 1 or 2 hurricane strength.\n\nMississippi\nThe Gulf coast of Mississippi suffered extremely severe damage from the impact of Hurricane Katrina on August 29, leaving 238 people dead, 67 missing, and billions of dollars in damage: bridges, barges, boats, piers, houses, and cars were washed inland. Katrina traveled up the entire state; as a result, all 82 counties in Mississippi were declared disaster areas for federal assistance, 47 for full assistance.\n\nAlabama\nAlthough Hurricane Katrina made landfall well to the west, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle were both affected by tropical-storm-force winds and a storm surge varying from 12 to 16 feet around Mobile Bay, with higher waves on top. Sustained winds of 67 mph were recorded in Mobile, Alabama, and the storm surge there was approximately 12 feet. The surge caused significant flooding several miles inland along Mobile Bay. Four tornadoes were also reported in Alabama. Ships, oil rigs, boats, and fishing piers were washed ashore along Mobile Bay: the cargo ship M/V Caribbean Clipper and many fishing boats were grounded at Bayou La Batre.\n\nOther U.S. States\nNorthern and central Georgia were affected by heavy rains and strong winds from Hurricane Katrina as the storm moved inland, with more than 3 inches of rain falling in several areas. At least 18 tornadoes formed in Georgia on August 29, 2005, the most on record in that state for one day in August. The most serious of these tornadoes was an F2 tornado which affected Heard County and Carroll County. This tornado caused three injuries and one fatality and damaged several houses. The other tornadoes caused significant damages to buildings and agricultural facilities. In addition to the fatality caused by the F2 tornado, there was another fatality in a traffic accident.\n\nCanada\nIn Canada, the remnants of Katrina brought rainfall amounts in excess of 3.94 inches to many locations between the Niagara Peninsula and the Saint Lawrence River valley. Severe local flooding occurred in Quebec, forcing the evacuations of dozens of homes in some communities as rivers began overflowing their banks and sewage systems were becoming overwhelmed by the influx of precipitation. Inundated and washed out roads, including Route 138 along the north shore of the Saint Lawrence River, Route 172 north of Tadoussac, and Route 385 near Forestville, left several communities isolated for at least a week.\n\nAftermath\nThe economic effects of the storm reached high levels. The Bush administration sought $105 billion for repairs and reconstruction in the region, which did not account for damage to the economy caused by potential interruption of the oil supply, destruction of the Gulf Coast's highway infrastructure, and exports of commodities such as grain. Katrina damaged or destroyed 30 oil platforms and caused the closure of nine refineries. The total shut-in oil production from the Gulf of Mexico in the six-month period following Katrina was approximately 24% of the annual production and the shut-in gas production for the same period was about 18%. The forestry industry in Mississippi was also affected, as 1.3 million acres of forest lands were destroyed. The total loss to the forestry industry from Katrina is calculated to rise to about $5 billion. Furthermore, hundreds of thousands of local residents were left unemployed. Before the hurricane, the region supported approximately one million non-farm jobs, with 600,000 of them in New Orleans. It is estimated that the total economic impact in Louisiana and Mississippi may eventually exceed $150 billion.\n\nEconomic Effects\nThe economic effects of the storm reached high levels.

Before the hurricane, the region supported approximately one million non-farm jobs, with 600,000 of them in New Orleans. It is estimated that the total economic impact in Louisiana and Mississippi may eventually exceed $150 billion.\n\nEnvironmental Effects\nKatrina also had a profound impact on the environment. The storm surge caused substantial beach erosion, in some cases completely devastating coastal areas. In Dauphin Island (a barrier island), approximately 90 miles to the east of the point where the hurricane made landfall, the sand that comprised the island was transported across the island into the Mississippi Sound, pushing the island towards land. The storm surge and waves from Katrina also severely damaged the Chandeleur Islands, which had been affected by Hurricane Ivan the previous year. The US Geological Survey has estimated 217 square miles of land was transformed to water by the hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Before the storm, subsidence and erosion caused loss of land in the Louisiana wetlands and bayous. This, along with the canals built in the area, let Katrina keep more of its intensity when it struck. The lands that were lost were breeding grounds for marine mammals, brown pelicans, turtles, and fish, and migratory species such as redhead ducks. Overall, about 20% of the local marshes were permanently overrun by water as a result of the storm.\n\nReestablishing Governance\nShortly after the hurricane moved away on August 30, 2005, some residents of New Orleans who remained in the city began looting stores. Many were in search of food and water that were not available to them through any other means, as well as non-essential items. Additionally, there were reports of carjacking, murders, thefts, and rapes in New Orleans. Some sources later determined that many of the reports were inaccurate, greatly exaggerated or completely false, leading news agencies to print retractions.\n\nGovernment Response\nWithin the United States and as delineated in the National Response Plan, disaster response and planning is first and foremost a local government responsibility. When local government exhausts its resources, it then requests specific additional resources from the county level. The request process proceeds similarly from the county to the state to the federal government as additional resource needs are identified. Many of the problems that arose developed from inadequate planning and back-up communication systems at various levels.\n\nCriticism\nThe criticisms of the government's response to Hurricane Katrina primarily consisted of criticism of mismanagement and lack of leadership in the relief efforts in response to the storm and its aftermath. More specifically, the criticism focused on the delayed response to the flooding of New Orleans, and the subsequent state of chaos in the city. The neologism Katrinagate was coined to refer to this controversy, and was a runner-up for \"2005 word of the year.\"\n\nInternational Response\nOver seventy countries pledged monetary donations or other assistance. Cuba and Venezuela, both considered as hostile to US government interests, were the first countries to offer assistance, pledging over $1 million, several mobile hospitals, water treatment plants, canned food, bottled water, heating oil, 1,100 doctors, and 26.4 metric tons of medicine. However, this aid was rejected by the US government. Kuwait made the largest single pledge, $500 million; other large donations were made by Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (each $100 million), South Korea ($30 million), Australia ($10 million), India, China (both $5 million), New Zealand ($2 million), Pakistan ($1.5 million), Norway ($1.8 million), and Bangladesh ($1 million).\n\nNon-Governmental Organization Response\nThe American Red Cross, America's Second Harvest (now known as Feeding America), Southern Baptist Convention, Salvation Army, Oxfam, Common Ground Collective, Burners Without Borders, Emergency Communities, Habitat for Humanity, Catholic Charities, Direct Relief, Service International, \"A River of Hope,\" The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and many other charitable organizations provided aid to victims in the aftermath of the storm. They were not allowed into New Orleans proper by the National Guard for several days after the storm because of safety concerns. These organizations raised US$4.25 billion in donations from the public, with the Red Cross receiving over half of these donations. Some smaller organizations and individuals ignored the access restrictions and provided early relief. For example, two privately chartered planes from FasterCures evacuated 200 patients from Charity Hospital in New Orleans.\n\nAnalysis of New Orleans Levee Failures\nAccording to a modeling exercise conducted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), two-thirds of the deaths in Greater New Orleans were due to levee and flood wall failure. On April 5, 2006, months after independent investigators had demonstrated that levee failures were not caused by natural forces beyond intended design strength, Lieutenant General Carl Strock, chief of engineers and commander of the Corps of Engineers, testified before the United States Senate Subcommittee on Energy and Water that \"We have now concluded we had problems with the design of the structure.\"\n\nMedia Involvement\nMany representatives of the news media reporting on the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina became directly involved in the unfolding events, instead of simply reporting. Because of the loss of most means of communication, such as land-based and cellular telephone systems, field reporters in many cases became conduits for information between victims and authorities. The authorities, who monitored local and network news broadcasts, as well as internet sites, would then attempt to coordinate rescue efforts based on the reports. One illustration was when Geraldo Rivera of Fox News tearfully pleaded for authorities to either send help or evacuate the thousands of evacuees stranded at the Ernest N Morial Convention Center. The role of AM radio was also of importance to the hundreds of thousands of persons with no other ties to news, providing emergency information regarding access to assistance for hurricane victims. Immediately after Katrina, WWL-AM was one of the few area radio stations in the area remaining on the air. This emergency service, simulcasted on shortwave outlet WHRI, was named \"United Radio Broadcasters of New Orleans.\" Their ongoing nighttime broadcasts continued to be available up to 500 miles away. Announcers continued to broadcast from improvised studio facilities after the storm damaged their main studios.\n\nStudies Concerning Post-Katrina Victims\nAn article published in the Community Mental Health Journal from January 2016 revealed information about a recent study on the psychosocial needs of Hurricane Katrina evacuees that temporarily resided in Dallas, Texas. More than one-fourth of the sample met the criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). About one-third of the individuals received a referral to mental health services for meeting symptom criteria for incident MDD and PTSD.\n\nRetirement\nBecause of the high death toll and widespread property destruction along the U.S. Gulf Coast, the name Katrina was retired from the Atlantic hurricane naming lists in April 2006 by the World Meteorological Organization. The name will never again be used for another tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin. It was replaced with Katia for the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season.\n\nReconstruction\nReconstruction of each section of the southern portion of Louisiana has been addressed in the Army Corps LACPR (Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration) Final Technical Report, which identifies areas to not be rebuilt and areas where buildings need to be elevated.\n\nRecords\nKatrina is the costliest tropical cyclone on record, tying with Hurricane Harvey in 2017. The storm was the fourth-most intense Atlantic hurricane on record to make landfall in the contiguous United States, behind the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Hurricane Camille in 1969, and Hurricane Michael in 2018. Katrina was also the earliest eleventh named storm in the Atlantic until Tropical Storm Kyle surpassed it on August 14, 2020, beating Katrina by 10 days.\n\nSee Also\nOther similar tropical

article in English about \"Hurricane_Katrina\" following this outline:\n\n\nMeteorological history\nHurricane Katrina originated from the merger of a tropical wave and the mid-level remnants of Tropical Depression Ten on August 19, 2005, near the Lesser Antilles On August 23, the disturbance organized into Tropical Depression Twelve over the southeastern Bahamas The storm strengthened into Tropical Storm Katrina on the morning of August 24 The tropical storm moved towards Florida and became a hurricane only two hours before making landfall between Hallandale Beach and Aventura on the morning of August 25 The storm weakened over land, but it regained hurricane status about one hour after entering the Gulf of Mexico, and it continued strengthening over open waters On August 27, the storm reached Category 3 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale, becoming the third major hurricane of the season An eyewall replacement cycle disrupted the intensification but caused the storm to nearly double in size [4] Thereafter, Katrina rapidly intensified over the \"unusually warm\" waters of the Loop Current, from a Category 3 hurricane to a Category 5 hurricane in just nine hours [5]\n\n\nPreparations\nThe United States Coast Guard began pre-positioning resources in a ring around the expected impact zone and activated more than 400 reservists On August 27, it moved its personnel out of the New Orleans region prior to the mandatory evacuation [7] Aircrews from the Aviation Training Center, in Mobile, staged rescue aircraft from Texas to Florida [8] All aircraft were returning towards the Gulf of Mexico by the afternoon of August 29  Aircrews, many of whom lost their homes during the hurricane, began a round-the-clock rescue effort in New Orleans, and along the Mississippi and Alabama coastlines [9]\n\n\nFederal government\nThe United States Coast Guard began pre-positioning resources in a ring around the expected impact zone and activated more than 400 reservists On August 27, it moved its personnel out of the New Orleans region prior to the mandatory evacuation [7] Aircrews from the Aviation Training Center, in Mobile, staged rescue aircraft from Texas to Florida [8] All aircraft were returning towards the Gulf of Mexico by the afternoon of August 29  Aircrews, many of whom lost their homes during the hurricane, began a round-the-clock rescue effort in New Orleans, and along the Mississippi and Alabama coastlines [9]\n\n\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\nOn the afternoon of August 26, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) realized that Katrina had yet to make the turn toward the Florida Panhandle and ended up revising the predicted track of the storm from the panhandle to the Mississippi coast [16] The National Weather Service's New Orleans/Baton Rouge office issued a vividly worded bulletin on August 28 predicting that the area would be \"uninhabitable for weeks\" after \"devastating damage\" caused by Katrina, which at that time rivaled the intensity of Hurricane Camille [17] During video conferences involving the president later that day and on August 29, NHC director Max Mayfield expressed concern that Katrina might push its storm surge over the city's levees and flood walls In one conference, he stated, \"I do not think anyone can tell you with confidence right now whether the levees will be topped or not, but that's obviously a very, very great concern.\" [18]\n\n\nGulf Coast\nIn Florida, Governor Jeb Bush declared a state of emergency on August 24 in advance of Hurricane Katrina's landfall [19] By the following day, Florida's Emergency Operations Center was activated in Tallahassee to monitor the progress of the hurricane [20] Before Katrina moved ashore, schools and businesses were closed in the Miami area Cruise ships altered their paths due to seaports in southeastern Florida closing [21] Officials in Miami-Dade County advised residents in mobile homes or with special needs to evacuate To the north in Broward County, residents east of the Intracoastal Waterway or in mobile homes were advised to leave their homes Evacuation orders were issued for offshore islands in Palm Beach County, and for residents in mobile homes south of Lantana Road Additionally, a mandatory evacuation was ordered for vulnerable housing in Martin County [19] Shelters were opened across the region [22] Officials closed the Miami International Airport, [23] Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport, Key West International Airport, and Florida Keys Marathon Airport due to the storm In Monroe and Collier counties, schools were closed, and a shelter was opened in Immokalee [24]\n\n\nFlorida\nHurricane Katrina first made landfall between Hallandale Beach and Aventura, Florida on August 25 The storm dropped heavy rainfall in portions of the Miami metropolitan area, with a peak total of 16.43 in (417 mm) in Perrine As a result, local flooding occurred in Miami-Dade County, damaging approximately 100 homes Farther south in the Florida Keys, a tornado was spawned in Marathon on August 26 The tornado damaged a hangar at the airport there and caused an estimated $5 million in damage [52] The rains caused flooding, and the combination of rains and winds downed trees and power lines, leaving 1.45 million people without power Damage in South Florida was estimated at $523 million, mostly as a result of crop damage Twelve deaths occurred in South Florida, of which three were caused by downed trees in Broward County, three from drowning in Miami-Dade County, three were from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by generators, one was due to a vehicle accident, one occurred during debris cleanup, and one was associated with a lack of electricity.\n\n\nAlabama\nAlthough Hurricane Katrina made landfall well to the west, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle were both affected by tropical-storm-force winds and a storm surge varying from 12 to 16 feet (3.7–4.9 m) around Mobile Bay, [4] with higher waves on top Sustained winds of 67 mph (108 km/h) were recorded in Mobile, Alabama, and the storm surge there was approximately 12 feet (3.7 m) [4] The surge caused significant flooding several miles inland along Mobile Bay Four tornadoes were also reported in Alabama [4] Ships, oil rigs, boats and fishing piers were washed ashore along Mobile Bay: the cargo ship M/V Caribbean Clipper and many fishing boats were grounded at Bayou La Batre.\n\n\nLouisiana\nOn August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina made landfall near Buras-Triumph, Louisiana, with 125 mph (200 km/h) winds, as a strong Category 3 hurricane Although the storm surge to the east of the path of the eye in Mississippi was higher, a significant surge affected the Louisiana coast The height of the surge is uncertain because of a lack of data, although a tide gauge in Plaquemines Parish indicated a storm tide in excess of 14 feet (4.3 m), and a 12-foot (3.7 m) storm surge was recorded in Grand Isle The hurricane made its final landfall near the mouth of the Pearl River, with the eye straddling St Tammany Parish, Louisiana, and Hancock County, Mississippi, on the morning of August 29 at about 9:45 am CDT [4]\n\n\nImpact\nOn August 29, 2005, Katrina's storm surge caused 53 breaches to various flood protection structures in and around the greater New Orleans area, submerging 80% of the city A June 2007 report by the American Society of Civil Engineers indicated that two-thirds of the flooding was caused by the multiple failures of the city's floodwalls [42] The storm surge also devastated the coasts of Mississippi and Alabama, making Katrina one of the most destructive hurricanes, the costliest natural disaster in the history of the United States (tied with Hurricane Harvey in 2017), [43] and the deadliest hurricane since the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane The total damage from Katrina is estimated at $125 billion (2005 U.S dollars) [4] [44] However, in February 2021, a severe winter storm struck the United States, causing a major power failure in Houston, which caused at least $195 billion (2021 USD) in damage in Texas It surpassed both Katrina and Harvey to become the single-costliest natural disaster recorded in the United States [45]\n\n\nBahamas and Cuba\nBefore striking South Florida, Katrina traversed the Bahamas as a tropical storm However, minimal impact was reported, with only \"fresh breezes\" on various islands [49]\n\n\nUnited States\nHurricane Katrina first made landfall between Hallandale Beach and Aventura, Florida on August 25 The storm dropped heavy rainfall in portions of the Miami metropolitan area, with a peak total of 16.43 in (417 mm) in Perrine As a result, local flooding occurred in

network news broadcasts, as well as internet sites, would then attempt to coordinate rescue efforts based on the reports One illustration was when Geraldo Rivera of Fox News tearfully pleaded for authorities to either send help or evacuate the thousands of evacuees stranded at the Ernest N Morial Convention Center [179] The role of AM radio was also of importance to the hundreds of thousands of persons with no other ties to news, providing emergency information regarding access to assistance for hurricane victims Immediately after Katrina, WWL-AM was one of the few area radio stations in the area remaining on the air This emergency service, simulcasted on shortwave outlet WHRI, was named \"United Radio Broadcasters of New Orleans\" Their ongoing nighttime broadcasts continued to be available up to 500 mi (800 km) away Announcers continued to broadcast from improvised studio facilities after the storm damaged their main studios [180] The cellular phone antenna network was severely damaged and completely inoperable for several months.\n\n\nStudies concerning post-Katrina victims\nAn article published in the Community Mental Health Journal from January 2016 revealed information about a recent study on the psychosocial needs of Hurricane Katrina evacuees that temporarily resided in Dallas, Texas More than one-fourth of the sample met the criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) About one-third of the individuals received a referral to mental health services for meeting symptom criteria for incident MDD and PTSD [187]\n\n\nRetirement\nBecause of the high death toll and widespread property destruction along the U.S Gulf Coast, the name Katrina was retired from the Atlantic hurricane naming lists in April 2006 by the World Meteorological Organization The name will never again be used for another tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin It was replaced with Katia for the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season [190] [191]\n\n\nReconstruction\nReconstruction of each section of the southern portion of Louisiana has been addressed in the Army Corps LACPR (Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration) Final Technical Report, which identifies areas to not be rebuilt and areas where buildings need to be elevated [192]\n\n\nRecords\nKatrina is the costliest tropical cyclone on record, tying with Hurricane Harvey in 2017 [43] The storm was the fourth-most intense Atlantic hurricane on record to make landfall in the contiguous United States, behind the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Hurricane Camille in 1969, and Hurricane Michael in 2018 [193] Katrina was also the earliest eleventh named storm in the Atlantic until Tropical Storm Kyle surpassed it on August 14, 2020, beating Katrina by 10 days [194]\n\n\nSee

Her father had a direct mail business and spent several years in prison for tax evasion. Neumann grew up in a relatively affluent family and attended the Horace Mann School, a prestigious private school in New York City.\n\nAfter completing her education, Neumann pursued a career in finance. She entered Salomon Smith Barney's Sales and Trading Program, which later became part of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. Neumann's early career in finance likely laid the groundwork for her future involvement in high-stakes business deals.\n\n**Career**\n\nIn addition to her work in finance, Neumann has also explored a career in the entertainment industry. Under the screen name Rebekah Keith, she acted and produced several short films in the early 2010s. This creative outlet may have provided a welcome respite from the demands of her financial career.\n\nHowever, it was her marriage to Adam Neumann that brought Rebekah into the public eye. Together, they co-founded WeWork, a company that aimed to revolutionize the way people work and live. WeWork's rapid growth and success made it a darling of the business world, with its IPO in 2019 valuing the company at over $47 billion.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nRebekah and Adam Neumann met in New York and married in 2008. They have six children together, and their family life has been subject to scrutiny in recent years. As the wife of a high-profile entrepreneur, Rebekah has been thrust into the public eye, with her personal life and family values being subject to media attention.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nRebekah Neumann has appeared in several forms of media, including the Apple TV+ series WeCrashed. The show, which premiered in 2022, is a dramatized account of WeWork's rise and fall. Anne Hathaway portrays Neumann in the series, bringing her to life on screen.\n\nIn addition to her on-screen appearances, Neumann has also been featured in the nonfiction book Billion Dollar Loser.

caravan route linking the markets of China with those of the Western world It was the site of several Buddhist monasteries, and a thriving center for religion, philosophy, and art Monks at the

monasteries lived as hermits in small caves carved into the side of the Bamyan cliffs Most of these monks embellished their caves with religious statuary and elaborate, brightly colored frescoes, sharing the culture of Gandhara.\n\n\nPre-modern era\nChinese Buddhist pilgrim Xuanzang visited the site on 30 April 630, [25] [26] [27] and described Bamyan in the Da Tang Xiyu Ji as a flourishing Buddhist center \"with more than ten monasteries and more than a thousand monks\" He also noted that both Buddha figures were \"decorated with gold and fine jewels\" (Wriggins, 1995) Intriguingly, Xuanzang mentions a third, even larger, reclining statue of the Buddha [12] [27] A monumental seated Buddha, similar in style to those at Bamyan, still exists in the Bingling Temple caves in China's Gansu province.\n\n\nMural paintings\nThe Buddhas are surrounded by numerous caves and surfaces decorated with paintings [17] It is thought that the period of florescence was from the 6th to 8th century CE, until the onset of Islamic invasions [17] These works of art are considered as an artistic synthesis of Buddhist art and Gupta art from India, with influences from the Sasanian Empire and the Byzantine Empire, as well as the country of Tokharistan [17] The later paintings are attributable to the \"Turk period\" (7th–9th century CE) [28]\n\n\nEastern Buddha (built c. 544–595 CE)\nMost of the surfaces in the niche housing the Buddha must have been decorated with colourful murals, surrounding the Buddha with many paintings, but only fragments were remaining in modern times For the 38 meter Eastern Buddha, built between 544 and 595 CE, the main remaining murals were the ones on the ceiling, right above the head of the Buddha Recent dating based on stylistic and historical analysis confirms dates for these mural which follow the carbon-rated dates for the construction of the Buddhas themselves: the murals of the Eastern Buddha have been dated to the 6th to 8th century CE by Klimburg-Salter (1989), and post 635/645 CE by Tanabe (2004) [1] As late as 2002, Marylin Martin Rhie argued a 3rd–4th century date for the Eastern Buddha, based on artistic criteria [32]\n\n\nSun God\nAmong the most famous paintings of the Buddhas of Bamiyan, the ceiling of the smaller Eastern Buddha represents a solar deity on a chariot pulled by horses, as well as ceremonial scenes with royal figures and devotees [29] The god is wearing a caftan in the style of Tokhara, boots, and is holding a lance [33] His representation is derived from the iconography of the Iranian god Mithra, as revered in Sogdia [33] He is riding a two-wheeled golden chariot, pulled by four horses [33] Two winged attendants are standing to the side of the charriot, wearing a Corinthian helmet with a feather, and holding a shield [33] In the top portion are wind gods, flying with a scarf held in both hands [33] This composition is unique, and distinct from Gandhara or India, but there are some similarities with the paintings of Kizil and Dunhuang [33]\n\n\nHephthalite donors\nThe Bamiyan Buddhas were built at the time of the Hephthalites [5] Several of the figures have the characteristic appearance of the Hephthalites of Tokharistan, with belted jackets with a unique lapel of their tunic being folded on the right side, the cropped hair, the hair accessories, their distinctive physiognomy and their round beardless faces [31] [34] These figures must represent the donors and potentates who supported the building of the monumental giant Buddha [31] The individuals in this painting are very similar to the individuals depicted in Balalyk Tepe, and they may be related to the Hepthalites [35] [36] They participate \"to the artistic tradition of the Hephthalite ruling classes of Tukharestan\" [36]\n\n\nWestern Buddha (built c. 591–644 CE)\nA few murals also remained around the taller 55 meter Western Buddha on the ceiling and on the sides Many are more conventionally Buddhist in character Some of the later mural paintings show male devotees in double-lapel caftans [38]\n\n\nAdjoining caves\nLater mural paintings of Bamiyan, dated to the 7th–8th centuries CE, display a variety of male devotees in double-lapel caftans [38] The works of art show a sophistication and cosmopolitanism comparable to other works of art of the Silk Road, such as those of Kizil, are attributable to the sponsorship of the Western Turks (Yabghus of Tokharistan) [38] The nearby Kakrak caves also have some works of art.\n\n\nAttacks on the statues\nDuring the Afghan Civil War, the area around the Buddhas was initially under the control of the Hezbe Wahdat—part of the Northern Alliance—who were against the Taliban However, Mazar-i-Sharif fell in August 1998, and the Bamyan valley was entirely surrounded by Taliban [47] The town was captured on 13 September 1998 after a successful blockade [48] [49]\n\n\nTaliban incursions (1998–2001)\nDuring the Afghan Civil War, the area around the Buddhas was initially under the control of the Hezbe Wahdat—part of the Northern Alliance—who were against the Taliban However, Mazar-i-Sharif fell in August 1998, and the Bamyan valley was entirely surrounded by Taliban [47] The town was captured on 13 September 1998 after a successful blockade [48] [49]\n\n\nDestruction by the Islamic Emirate\nOn 1 March 2001, the Taliban announced that all statues depicting humans in Afghanistan would be destroyed Work to destroy the Buddhas began the next day, on 2 March, and continued for several weeks [52] [8] Various theories have sought to explain what prompted Taliban leader Mullah Omar to order the destruction of the statues, further complicated by seemingly shifting narratives of the events as relayed by Omar and senior Taliban officials.\n\n\nDecision to destroy\nOn 1 March 2001, the Taliban announced that all statues depicting humans in Afghanistan would be destroyed Work to destroy the Buddhas began the next day, on 2 March, and continued for several weeks [52] [8] Various theories have sought to explain what prompted Taliban leader Mullah Omar to order the destruction of the statues, further complicated by seemingly shifting narratives of the events as relayed by Omar and senior Taliban officials.\n\n\nInternational reaction\nThe Taliban's intention to destroy the statues, caused a wave of international horror and protest According to UNESCO Director-General Kōichirō Matsuura, a meeting of ambassadors from the 54 member states of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) was conducted All OIC states—including Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, three countries that officially recognised the Taliban government—joined the protest to spare the monuments [60] Saudi Arabia and the UAE later condemned the destruction as \"savage\" [61] Although India never recognised the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, New Delhi offered to arrange for the transfer of all the artifacts in question to India, \"where they would be kept safely and preserved for all mankind\" These overtures were rejected by the Taliban [62] Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf sent a delegation led by Pakistan's interior minister Moinuddin Haider to Kabul to meet with Omar and try to prevent the destruction, arguing that it was un-Islamic and unprecedented [63] As recounted by Steve Coll:\n\n\nProcess of destruction\nThe destruction was carried out in stages Initially, the statues were fired at for several days using anti-aircraft guns and artillery This caused severe damage, but did not obliterate them During the destruction, Taliban Information Minister Qudratullah Jamal said that, \"The destruction work is not as easy as people would think You can't knock down the statues by dynamite or shelling as both of them have been carved in a cliff They are firmly attached to the mountain.\" [73] Later, the Taliban placed anti-tank mines at the bottom of the niches, so that when fragments of rock broke off from artillery fire, the statues would receive additional destruction from particles that set off the mines In the end, the Taliban lowered men down the cliff face and placed explosives into holes in the Buddhas [74] After one of the explosions failed to obliterate the face of one of the Buddhas, a rocket was launched that left a hole in the remains of the stone head [75]\n\n\nCurrent status (2002–present)\nThough the figures of the two large Buddhas have been destroyed, their outlines and some features are still recognisable within the recesses It is also still possible for visitors to explore the monks' caves and passages that connect them As part of the international effort to rebuild Afghanistan after the Taliban war, the Japanese government and several other organisations—among them the Afghanistan Institute in Bubendorf, Switzerland, along with the ETH Zurich—have committed to rebuilding, perhaps by anastylosis, the two larger Buddhas The local residents of Bamyan have also expressed their favour in restoring the structures [78]\n\n\nRestoration\nThe UNESCO Expert Working Group on Afghan cultural projects convened to discuss what to do about the two statues between 3–4 March 2011 in Paris Researcher Erwin Emmerling of Technical University Munich announced he believed it would be possible to restore the smaller statue using an organic silicon compound [90] The Paris conference issued a list of 39 recommendations for the safeguarding of the Bamyan site These included leaving the larger Western niche empty as a monument to the destruction of the Buddhas, a feasibility study into the rebuilding of the Eastern Buddha, and the construction of a central museum and several smaller site museums [91] Work has since begun on restoring the Buddhas using the process of anastylosis, where original elements are combined with modern material It is estimated that roughly half the pieces of the Buddhas can be put back together according to Bert Praxenthaler, a German art historian and sculptor involved in the restoration The restoration of the caves and Buddhas has also involved training and employing local people as stone carvers [92] The project, which also aims to encourage tourism to the area, is being organised by UNESCO and the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS).\n\n\nRise of the Buddhas with 3D light projection\nAfter fourteen years, on 7 June 2015, a Chinese adventurist couple Zhang Xinyu and Liang Hong filled the empty cavities where the Buddhas once stood with 3D laser light projection technology The projector used for the installation, worth approximately $120,000, was donated by Zhang and Liang, who were saddened by the destruction of the statues With the desire of paying tribute, they requested permission from UNESCO and the Afghan government to do the project About 150 local people came out to see the unveiling of the holographic statues [94] [95]\n\n\nReplicas\nThe destruction of the Buddhas of Bamyan inspired attempts to construct replicas of the Bamyan Buddhas [96] These include the following.\n\n\nGallery\nDespite the Buddhas's destruction, the ruins continue to be a popular culture landmark, [103] bolstered by increasing domestic and international tourism to the Bamyan Valley [104] The area around the ruins has since been used for the traditional game of buzkashi, [105] and other events The music video of pop singer Aryana Sayeed's hit 2015 song \"Yaar-e Bamyani\" was also shot by the ruins [106] The statues inspired Islamic writers in historical times The larger statue appears as the malevolent giant Salsal in medieval Turkish tales [107]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nDespite the Buddhas's destruction, the ruins continue to be a popular culture

riding a two-wheeled golden chariot, pulled by four horses [33] Two winged attendants are standing to the side of the charriot, wearing a Corinthian helmet with a feather, and holding a shield [33] In the top portion are wind gods, flying with a scarf held in both hands [33] This composition is unique, and distinct from Gandhara or India, but there are some similarities with the paintings of Kizil and Dunhuang [33]\n\n\nHephthalite donors\nThe Bamiyan Buddhas were built at the time of the Hephthalites [5] Several of the figures have the characteristic appearance of the Hephthalites of Tokharistan, with belted jackets with a unique lapel of their tunic being folded on the right side, the cropped hair, the hair accessories, their distinctive physiognomy and their round beardless faces [31] [34] These figures must represent the donors and potentates who supported the building of the monumental giant Buddha [31] The individuals in this painting are very similar to the individuals depicted in Balalyk Tepe, and they may be related to the Hepthalites [35] [36] They participate \"to the artistic tradition of the Hephthalite ruling classes of Tukharestan\" [36]\n\n\nWestern Buddha (built c. 591–644 CE)\nA few murals also remained around the taller 55 meter Western Buddha on the ceiling and on the sides Many are more conventionally Buddhist in character Some of the later mural paintings show male devotees in double-lapel caftans [38]\n\n\nAdjoining caves\nLater mural paintings of Bamiyan, dated to the 7th–8th centuries CE, display a variety of male devotees in double-lapel caftans [38] The works of art show a sophistication and cosmopolitanism comparable to other works of art of the Silk Road, such as those of Kizil, are attributable to the sponsorship of the Western Turks (Yabghus of Tokharistan) [38] The nearby Kakrak caves also have some works of art.\n\n\nAttacks on the statues\nDuring the Afghan Civil War, the area around the Buddhas was initially under the control of the Hezbe Wahdat—part of the Northern Alliance—who were against the Taliban However, Mazar-i-Sharif fell in August 1998, and the Bamyan valley was entirely surrounded by Taliban [47] The town was captured on 13 September 1998 after a successful blockade [48] [49]\n\n\nTaliban incursions (1998–2001)\nDuring the Afghan Civil War, the area around the Buddhas was initially under the control of the Hezbe Wahdat—part of the Northern Alliance—who were against the Taliban However, Mazar-i-Sharif fell in August 1998, and the Bamyan valley was entirely surrounded by Taliban [47] The town was captured on 13 September 1998 after a successful blockade [48] [49]\n\n\nDestruction by the Islamic Emirate\nOn 1 March 2001, the Taliban announced that all statues depicting humans in Afghanistan would be destroyed Work to destroy the Buddhas began the next day, on 2 March, and continued for several weeks [52] [8] Various theories have sought to explain what prompted Taliban leader Mullah Omar to order the destruction of the statues, further complicated by seemingly shifting narratives of the events as relayed by Omar and senior Taliban officials.\n\n\nDecision to destroy\nOn 1 March 2001, the Taliban announced that all statues depicting humans in Afghanistan would be destroyed Work to destroy the Buddhas began the next day, on 2 March, and continued for several weeks [52] [8] Various theories have sought to explain what prompted Taliban leader Mullah Omar to order the destruction of the statues, further complicated by seemingly shifting narratives of the events as relayed by Omar and senior Taliban officials.\n\n\nInternational reaction\nThe Taliban's intention to destroy the statues, caused a wave of international horror and protest According to UNESCO Director-General Kōichirō Matsuura, a meeting of ambassadors from the 54 member states of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) was conducted All OIC states—including Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, three countries that officially recognised the Taliban government—joined the protest to spare the monuments [60] Saudi Arabia and the UAE later condemned the destruction as \"savage\" [61] Although India never recognised the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, New Delhi offered to arrange for the transfer of all the artifacts in question to India, \"where they would be kept safely and preserved for all mankind\" These overtures were rejected by the Taliban [62] Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf sent a delegation led by Pakistan's interior minister Moinuddin Haider to Kabul to meet with Omar and try to prevent the destruction, arguing that it was un-Islamic and unprecedented [63] As recounted by Steve Coll:\n\n\nProcess of destruction\nThe destruction was carried out in stages Initially, the statues were fired at for several days using anti-aircraft guns and artillery This caused severe damage, but did not obliterate them During the destruction, Taliban Information Minister Qudratullah Jamal said that, \"The destruction work is not as easy as people would think You can't knock down the statues by dynamite or shelling as both of them have been carved in a cliff They are firmly attached to the mountain.\" [73] Later, the Taliban placed anti-tank mines at the bottom of the niches, so that when fragments of rock broke off from artillery fire, the statues would receive additional destruction from particles that set off the mines In the end, the Taliban lowered men down the cliff face and placed explosives into holes in the Buddhas [74] After one of the explosions failed to obliterate the face of one of the Buddhas, a rocket was launched that left a hole in the remains of the stone head [75]\n\n\nCurrent status (2002–present)\nThough the figures of the two large Buddhas have been destroyed, their outlines and some features are still recognisable within the recesses It is also still possible for visitors to explore the monks' caves and passages that connect them As part of the international effort to rebuild Afghanistan after the Taliban war, the Japanese government and several other organisations—among them the Afghanistan Institute in Bubendorf, Switzerland, along with the ETH Zurich—have committed to rebuilding, perhaps by anastylosis, the two larger Buddhas The local residents of Bamyan have also expressed their favour in restoring the structures [78]\n\n\nRestoration\nThe UNESCO Expert Working Group on Afghan cultural projects convened to discuss what to do about the two statues between 3–4 March 2011 in Paris Researcher Erwin Emmerling of Technical University Munich announced he believed it would be possible to restore the smaller statue using an organic silicon compound [90] The Paris conference issued a list of 39 recommendations for the safeguarding of the Bamyan site These included leaving the larger Western niche empty as a monument to the destruction of the Buddhas, a feasibility study into the rebuilding of the Eastern Buddha, and the construction of a central museum and several smaller site museums [91] Work has since begun on restoring the Buddhas using the process of anastylosis, where original elements are combined with modern material It is estimated that roughly half the pieces of the Buddhas can be put back together according to Bert Praxenthaler, a German art historian and sculptor involved in the restoration The restoration of the caves and Buddhas has also involved training and employing local people as stone carvers [92] The project, which also aims to encourage tourism to the area, is being organised by UNESCO and the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS).\n\n\nRise of the Buddhas with 3D light projection\nAfter fourteen years, on 7 June 2015, a Chinese adventurist couple Zhang Xinyu and Liang Hong filled the empty cavities where the Buddhas once stood with 3D laser light projection technology The projector used for the installation, worth approximately $120,000, was donated by Zhang and Liang, who were saddened by the destruction of the statues With the desire of paying tribute, they requested permission from UNESCO and the Afghan government to do the project About 150 local people came out to see the unveiling of the holographic statues [94] [95]\n\n\nReplicas\nThe destruction of the Buddhas of Bamyan inspired attempts to construct replicas of the Bamyan Buddhas [96] These include the following.\n\n\nGallery\nDespite the Buddhas's destruction, the ruins continue to be a popular culture landmark, [103] bolstered by increasing domestic and international tourism to the Bamyan Valley [104] The area around the ruins has since been used for the traditional game of buzkashi, [105] and other events The music video of pop singer Aryana Sayeed's hit 2015 song \"Yaar-e Bamyani\" was also shot by the ruins [106] The statues inspired Islamic writers in historical times The larger statue appears as the malevolent giant Salsal in medieval Turkish tales [107]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nDespite the Buddhas's destruction, the ruins continue to be a popular culture

{"title": "Black_Friday_(shopping)", "content": "\nEtymology\nFor centuries, the adjective \"black\" has been applied to days upon which calamities occurred Many events have been described as \"Black Friday\", although the most significant such event in American history was the Panic of 1869, which occurred when financiers Jay Gould and James Fisk took advantage of their connections with the Grant Administration in an attempt to corner the gold market When President Grant learned of this manipulation, he ordered the Treasury to release a large supply of gold, which halted the run and caused prices to drop by 18% Fortunes were made and lost in a single day, and the president's own brother-in-law, Abel Corbin, was ruined.\n\n\nHistory\nThanksgiving's relationship to Christmas shopping led to controversy in the 1930s Retail stores would have liked to have a longer shopping season, but no store wanted to break with tradition and be the one to start advertising before Thanksgiving For this reason, in 1939, President Franklin D Roosevelt issued a presidential proclamation proclaiming Thanksgiving to be the fourth Thursday in November rather than the last Thursday, meaning in some years one week earlier, in order to lengthen the Christmas shopping season [18] Most people adopted the President's change, which was later reinforced by an act of Congress, but many continued to celebrate Thanksgiving on the traditional date [18]\n\n\n\"Black Thursday\"\nFor many years, retailers pushed opening times on Black Friday earlier and earlier, eventually reaching midnight, before opening on the evening of Thanksgiving Kmart opened its stores on Thanksgiving as early as 1991, and was open on Thanksgiving Day for many years [24] In 2009, Kmart manager Freddy Moss opened at 7 p.m on Thanksgiving in order to allow shoppers to avoid Black Friday traffic and return home in time for dinner with their families Two years later, a number of retailers began opening at 8 p.m or 9 p.m., on what became derisively known as \"Black Thursday\" In subsequent years, other stores followed this trend, opening earlier and earlier on Thanksgiving, or remaining open all day, beginning in the early morning hours [25] [26] Some retail and media sources have used the terms \"Gray Thursday\" or \"Brown Thursday\" instead [27] [28] [29]\n\n\nBlack Friday around the world\nBlack Friday, in Egypt, started in 2014, being introduced as White Friday The change of name was due to religious, traditional, and cultural concepts [36] [37]\n\n\nAfrica\nBlack Friday, in Egypt, started in 2014, being introduced as White Friday The change of name was due to religious, traditional, and cultural concepts [36] [37]\n\n\nEgypt\nBlack Friday, in Egypt, started in 2014, being introduced as White Friday The change of name was due to religious, traditional, and cultural concepts [36] [37]\n\n\nLibya\nBlack Friday deals started in Libya since 2019, also introduced as White Friday due to religious, traditional and cultural concepts  [38]\n\n\nNigeria\nBlack Friday deals were first introduced in 2014 in Nigeria.\n\n\nSouth Africa\nIn South Africa Black Friday was introduced in 2014.\n\n\nAsia\nThe use Black Friday shopping festival terminology started in 2014 in major cities of Pakistan which later changed with “Blessed Friday” due to the religious reasons and welcomed by all religions and ethnic societies of Pakistan Now Blessed Friday (Black Friday) shopping festival is being observed regularly all over Pakistan.\n\n\nPakistan\nThe use Black Friday shopping festival terminology started in 2014 in major cities of Pakistan which later changed with “Blessed Friday” due to the religious reasons and welcomed by all religions and ethnic societies of Pakistan Now Blessed Friday (Black Friday) shopping festival is being observed regularly all over Pakistan.\n\n\nIndia\nThe holiday shopping season in India has traditionally been aligned around the \"festive period\" of major festivals usually falling around October or November, such as Diwali [39] [40] [41] Similar to U.S.-style shopping events such as Black Friday, online retailers adopted the practice of holding multi-day promotions during this period, such as Amazon's \"Great Indian Festival\" and Flipkart's \"Big Billion Days\" India's Independence Day (August 15) had also recently attracted similar events [41] [42]\n\n\nIran\nLike other countries in West Asia, Black Friday is very popular.\n\n\nLebanon\nLebanon was exposed to black Friday around 2014.\n\n\nSaudi Arabia\nIn Saudi Arabia, black Friday started when a local e-commerce platform noon.com created Yellow Friday Sale which is now an annual event.\n\n\nUnited Arab Emirates\nU.A.E Black Friday started as White Friday campaign in 2014 In 2018 local e-commerce platform noon.com created Yellow Friday in the U.A.E.

retailers since 2016 Especially online shops have broke sales records during the last edition of Black Friday, which provides a base for further growth of popularity of Black Friday in Belgium After 2016, Black Friday in Belgium has grown strongly The participating shops have increased to over seventy during the Black Friday period of 2017 During Black Friday 2018, a total of 119 participating

given by retailing giants such as Apple and Amazon in 2014 [45] French electronics retailers such as FNAC and Auchan advertised deals online, while Darty also took part in this once-a-year monster sale Retailers favored the very American term \"Black Friday\" to \"Vendredi noir\" in their advertisements [46] In 2016, because of the terror attacks in Paris in November the year before, some retailers used the name \"Jour XXL\" (XXL day) instead of Black Friday [47] An alternative was brought up by some online businesses in 2018, called \"French Days\", [48] which goal is to replicate Black Friday during spring season (starting around the first day of May).\n\n\nGermany\nIn Germany, \"Black Friday\" retailer advertisements refer to \"Black Week\" and \"Black Shopping\" in English with sales lasting an entire week (excluding Sundays when most retail stores are closed) During this sales period, stores keep their normal working hours Although goods are offered at reduced prices, the prices are not cut significantly more than normal weekly price reductions Apple was the first company to run a special Black Friday campaign for the German market in 2006 [50] Apple never used the name Black Friday in Germany, but promotes only a \"one-day shopping event\" [51] In the first years, mostly internet retailers have used the event as an occasion to attract new customers with discounts, but bricks and mortar stores have already begun to adapt.\n\n\nGreece\nBlack Friday sale was popularized in 2016.\n\n\nIreland\nBlack Friday was introduced in 2014 [52]\n\n\nItaly\n2014

visited the site, making it the single largest online shopping event in German-speaking countries.\n\n\nNetherlands\nIn the Netherlands, Black Friday was seriously introduced in 2015 Some years before, there were already a number of large and small retailers that used Black Friday in their marketing However, with a total of 35 participating stores, 2015 can be considered the year in which Black Friday started in the Netherlands due to a more widespread support of large retailers The popularity of Black Friday has grown rapidly in the Netherlands The number of participating stores has increased to over 125 during the Black Friday period of 2017 For the 2018 edition, 166 shops joined the largest black Friday platform in the Netherlands [citation needed]\n\n\nNorway\nIn Norway, Black Friday started as a publicity stunt campaign back in 2010 to increase the sales to the shopping mall Norwegian Outlet Since the introduction, it has been promoted every year in a larger and growing market all over the country [53]\n\n\nPoland\nThere has been growing interest for Black Friday in Poland as well [citation needed]\n\n\nRomania\nThe concept was imported in Romania by eMAG  [ro] and Flanco in 2011 and became bigger each year The two reported the biggest Black Friday sales in 2014 eMAG sold products worth some 37 million euros while Flanco's sales totaled 22 million euros Hundreds of retailers announced their participation in the 2015 campaign [54]\n\n\nSpain\nIn 2015, Spain joined with some small retailers The celebration became more famous year by year, until the big retailers grew [citation needed]\n\n\nSweden\nIn Sweden, black Friday is widely practiced [56]\n\n\nSwitzerland\nIn 2015, Swiss retailer Manor was the first to launch a special Black Friday promotion The year after, most Swiss retailers launched special offers during the Black Friday Week This year, sales of 470 million Swiss francs are expected Although Singles Day initially grew in importance, it has now become significantly less relevant than Black Friday in Switzerland [57]\n\n\nTurkey\nEfsane Cuma, or \"Legendary Friday,\" is the Turkish version of Black Friday — a major shopping event that falls on the last Friday of November Efsane Cuma offers customers substantial discounts, promotions, and special deals across a variety of products, from electronics to clothing This sales period has gained popularity in Turkey as both online and brick-and-mortar stores attract large crowds seeking bargains, often extending the deals for a few days or even over a week.\n\n\nUkraine\nIn 2016, Black Friday was introduced in Ukraine [58]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nIn the United Kingdom, the term \"Black Friday\" originated within the Police and NHS to refer to the Friday before Christmas It is the day when emergency services activate contingency plans to cope with the increase in workload due to many people going out drinking on the last Friday before Christmas Contingencies can include setting up mobile field hospitals near City Centre nightspots [59] The term has then been adopted outside those services to refer to the evening and night of the Friday immediately before Christmas, and would now be considered a mainstream term and not simply as jargon of the emergency services.\n\n\nNorth America\nThe large population centers on Lake Ontario and the Lower Mainland in Canada have always attracted cross-border shopping into the United States, and as Black Friday became more popular in the U.S., Canadians often flocked over the border because of their lower prices and a stronger Canadian dollar After 2001, many were traveling for the deals across the border Starting in 2008 and 2009, due to the parity of the Canadian dollar compared with the American dollar, several major Canadian retailers ran Black Friday deals of their own to discourage shoppers from leaving Canada [71] [72]\n\n\nCanada\nThe large population centers on Lake Ontario and the Lower Mainland in Canada

retailing industry to create an annual week-end of discounts and extended credit terms, El Buen Fin, meaning \"the good weekend\" in Spanish [75] El Buen Fin has been in existence since 2011 and takes place on November in the week-end prior to the Monday in which the Mexican Revolution holiday is pushed from its original date of November 20, as a result of the measure taken by the government of pushing certain holidays to the Monday of their week in order to avoid the workers and students to make a \"larger\" week-end (for example, not attending in a Friday after a Thursday holiday, thus making a four-day week-end) On this week-end, major retailers extend their store hours [76] and offer special promotions, including extended credit terms and price promotions.\n\n\nUnited States\nBlack Friday is not an official holiday in the United States, but California and some other states observe \"The Day After Thanksgiving\" as a holiday for state government employees It is sometimes observed in lieu of another federal holiday, such as Columbus Day Many non-retail employees and schools have both Thanksgiving and the following Friday off Along with the following regular week-end, this makes Black Friday weekend a four-day weekend, which is said to increase the number of potential shoppers.\n\n\nOceania\nIn Australia, the term is controversial, [96] [97] as prior to its popularisation as a shopping day, it referred not to shopping at all, but to the devastating Black Friday bushfires that occurred in Victoria 1938–39 [96] [97] [98] [99] It was not until the 2010s that it was heavily promoted as a shopping day in Australia by in-store and online retailers, despite backlash and confusion by consumers In 2011, Online Shopping USA hosted an event on Twitter

President Grant learned of this manipulation and ordered the Treasury to release a large supply of gold, which halted the run and caused prices to drop by 18%.

While most injuries remain minor, serious injuries and even deliberate violence have taken place on some Black Fridays.\n\n**Notable Incidents**\n\nIn 2008, a crowd of approximately 2,000 shoppers in Valley Stream, New York, waited outside for the 05:00 opening of the local Walmart. When the doors were opened, the crowd pushed forward, breaking the door down, and 34-year-old employee Jdimytai Damour was trampled to death.

occurred Many events have been described as \"Black Friday\", although the most significant such event in American history was the Panic of 1869, which occurred when financiers Jay Gould and James Fisk took advantage of their connections with the Grant Administration in an attempt to corner the gold market When President Grant learned of this manipulation, he ordered the Treasury to release a large supply of gold, which halted the run and caused prices to drop by 18% Fortunes were made and lost in a single day, and the president's own brother-in-law, Abel Corbin, was ruined.\n\n\nHistory\nThanksgiving's relationship to Christmas shopping led to controversy in the 1930s Retail stores would have liked to have a longer shopping season, but no store wanted to break with tradition and be the one to start advertising before Thanksgiving For this reason, in 1939, President Franklin D Roosevelt issued a presidential proclamation proclaiming Thanksgiving to be the fourth Thursday in November rather than the last Thursday, meaning in some years one week earlier, in order to lengthen the Christmas shopping season [18] Most people adopted the President's change, which was later reinforced by an act of Congress, but many continued to celebrate Thanksgiving on the traditional date [18]\n\n\n\"Black Thursday\"\nFor many years, retailers pushed opening times on Black Friday earlier and earlier, eventually reaching midnight, before opening on the evening of Thanksgiving Kmart opened its stores on Thanksgiving as early as 1991, and was open on Thanksgiving Day for many years [24] In 2009, Kmart manager Freddy Moss opened at 7 p.m on Thanksgiving in order to allow shoppers to avoid Black Friday traffic and return home in time for dinner with their families Two years later, a number of retailers began opening at 8 p.m or 9 p.m., on what became derisively known as \"Black Thursday\" In subsequent years, other stores followed this trend, opening earlier and earlier on Thanksgiving, or remaining open all day, beginning in the early morning hours [25] [26] Some retail and media sources have used the terms \"Gray Thursday\" or \"Brown Thursday\" instead

retailers used the name \"Jour XXL\" (XXL day) instead of Black Friday [47] An alternative was brought up by some online businesses in 2018, called \"French Days\", [48] which goal is to replicate

attracted cross-border shopping into the United States, and as Black Friday became more popular in the U.S., Canadians often flocked over the border because of their lower prices and a stronger

retailing industry to create an annual week-end of discounts and extended credit terms, El Buen Fin, meaning \"the good weekend\" in Spanish [75] El Buen Fin has been in existence since 2011 and takes place on November in the week-end prior to the Monday in which the Mexican Revolution holiday is pushed from its original date of November 20, as a result of the measure taken by the government of pushing certain holidays to the Monday of their week in order to avoid the workers and students to make a \"larger\" week-end (for example, not attending in a Friday after a Thursday holiday, thus making a four-day week-end) On this week-end, major retailers extend their store hours [76] and offer special promotions, including extended credit terms and price promotions.\n\n\nUnited States\nBlack Friday is not an official holiday in the United States, but California and some other states observe \"The Day After Thanksgiving\" as a holiday for state government employees It is sometimes observed in lieu of another federal holiday, such as Columbus Day Many non-retail employees and schools have both Thanksgiving and the following Friday off Along with the following regular week-end, this makes Black Friday weekend a four-day weekend, which is said to increase the number of potential shoppers.\n\n\nOceania\nIn Australia, the term is controversial, [96] [97] as prior to

possible recruiting violations related to three players [145] The team finished the regular season tied for eighth place in the American (7–11 record in AAC play) and lost to #9 seed SMU 73–80 in the first round of the conference tournament on March 8, 2018 [146] UConn finished with a 14–18 overall record in what is widely considered to be the teams worst-performing season since the Jim Calhoun era began in 1986 Two days after the loss to SMU, Kevin Ollie was fired for just cause related to the NCAA investigation [147] In Ollie's final season, UConn men's basketball game attendance reached its lowest level in nearly 30 years, illustrating the severe decline in its prominence and performance since the programs 2014 national championship season \n\n\nDan Hurley Era (2018–present)\nUConn hired Rhode Island head coach Dan Hurley as Ollie's replacement for the 2018–19 season He was introduced on March 23, 2018 [149] Prior to his six seasons at Rhode Island, Hurley spent nine years

loss at #14 Villanova—a non-conference game that would become a conference game the next year—Hurley remarked that other teams \"better get us now That's all, you better get us now Because it's coming,\" foreshadowing the program's return to national relevance in the years ahead [156] In the penultimate game of the regular season, UConn defeated #21 Houston 77–71 at Gampel Pavilion on senior

of conferences that did not hold a postseason tournament (New England and Yankee) The advent of the ECAC men's basketball tournaments in the 1974–75 season provided UConn with its first opportunity to win a postseason conference championship Over the past half century, UConn has won 11 conference tournament titles The program is currently tied with Georgetown for the most Big East tournament

{"title": "Charles_Dickens", "content": "\nEarly life\nCharles Dickens was born on 7 February 1812 at 1 Mile End Terrace (now 393 Commercial Road), Landport in Portsea Island (Portsmouth), Hampshire, the second of eight children of Elizabeth Dickens (née Barrow; 1789–1863) and John Dickens (1785–1851) His father was a clerk in the Navy Pay Office and was temporarily stationed in the district He asked Christopher Huffam, [14] rigger to His Majesty's Navy, gentleman and head of an established firm, to act as godfather to Charles Huffam is thought to be the inspiration for Paul Dombey, the owner of a shipping company in Dickens's novel Dombey and Son (1848) [14]\n\n\nCareer\nIn 1832, at the age of 20, Dickens was energetic and increasingly self-confident [42] He enjoyed mimicry and popular entertainment, lacked a clear, specific sense of what he wanted to become, and yet knew he wanted fame Drawn to the theatre—he became an early member of the Garrick Club [43]—he landed an acting audition at Covent Garden, where the manager George Bartley and the actor Charles Kemble were to see him Dickens prepared meticulously and decided to imitate the comedian Charles Mathews, but ultimately he missed the audition because of a cold Before another opportunity arose, he had set out on his career as a writer [44]\n\n\nJournalism and writing\nIn 1832, at the age of 20, Dickens was energetic and increasingly self-confident [42] He enjoyed mimicry and popular entertainment, lacked a clear, specific sense of what he wanted to become, and yet knew he wanted fame Drawn to the theatre—he became an early member of the Garrick Club [43]—he landed an acting audition at Covent Garden, where the manager George Bartley and the actor Charles Kemble were to see him Dickens prepared meticulously and decided to imitate the comedian Charles Mathews, but ultimately he missed the audition because of a cold Before another opportunity arose, he had set out on his career as a writer [44]\n\n\nFirst visit to the United States\nOn 22 January 1842, Dickens and his wife arrived in Boston, Massachusetts, aboard the RMS Britannia during their first trip to the United States and Canada [73] At this time Georgina Hogarth, another sister of Catherine, joined the Dickens household, now living at Devonshire Terrace, Marylebone to care for the young family they had left behind [74] She remained with them as housekeeper, organiser, adviser and friend until Dickens's death in 1870 [75] Dickens modelled the character of Agnes Wickfield after Georgina and Mary [76]\n\n\nReturn to England\nSoon after his return to England, Dickens began work on the first of his Christmas stories, A Christmas Carol, written in 1843, which was followed by The Chimes in 1844 and The Cricket on the Hearth in 1845 Of these, A Christmas Carol was most popular and, tapping into an old tradition, did much to promote a renewed enthusiasm for the joys of Christmas in Britain and America [85] The seeds for the story became planted in Dickens's mind during a trip to Manchester to witness the conditions of the manufacturing workers there This, along with scenes he had recently witnessed at the Field Lane Ragged School, caused Dickens to resolve to \"strike a sledge hammer blow\" for the poor As the idea for the story took shape and the writing began in earnest, Dickens became engrossed in the book He later wrote that as the tale unfolded he \"wept and laughed, and wept again\" as he \"walked about the black streets of London fifteen or twenty miles many a night when all sober folks had gone to bed\" [86]\n\n\nPhilanthropy\nAngela Burdett Coutts, heir to the Coutts banking fortune, approached Dickens in May 1846 about setting up a home for the redemption of fallen women of the working class Coutts envisioned a home that would replace the punitive regimes of existing institutions with a reformative environment conducive to education and proficiency in domestic household chores After initially resisting, Dickens eventually founded the home, named Urania Cottage, in the Lime Grove area of Shepherd's Bush, which he managed for ten years, [88] setting the house rules, reviewing the accounts and interviewing prospective residents [89] Emigration and marriage were central to Dickens's agenda for the women on leaving Urania Cottage, from which it is estimated that about 100 women graduated between 1847 and 1859 [90]\n\n\nReligious views\nAs a young man, Dickens expressed a distaste for certain aspects of organised religion In 1836, in a pamphlet titled Sunday Under Three Heads, he defended the people's right to pleasure, opposing a plan to prohibit games on Sundays \"Look into your churches—diminished congregations and scanty attendance People have grown sullen and obstinate, and are becoming disgusted with the faith which condemns them to such a day as this, once in every seven They display their feeling by staying away  [from church] Turn into the streets  [on a Sunday] and mark the rigid gloom that reigns over everything around.\" [91] [92]\n\n\nMiddle years\nIn December 1845, Dickens took up the editorship of the London-based Daily News, a liberal paper through which Dickens hoped to advocate, in his own words, \"the Principles of Progress and Improvement, of Education and Civil and Religious Liberty and Equal Legislation.\" [104] Among the other contributors Dickens chose to write for the paper were the radical economist Thomas Hodgskin and the social reformer Douglas William Jerrold, who frequently attacked the Corn Laws [104] [105] Dickens lasted only ten weeks on the job before resigning due to a combination of exhaustion and frustration with one of the paper's co-owners [104]\n\n\nLater life\nOn 9 June 1865, while returning from Paris with Ellen Ternan, Dickens was involved in the Staplehurst rail crash in Kent The train's first seven carriages plunged off a cast iron bridge that was under repair and ten passengers were killed [148] The only first-class carriage to remain on the track—which was left hanging precariously off the bridge—was the one in which Dickens was travelling [149] For three hours before rescuers arrived, Dickens tended and comforted the wounded and the dying with a flask of brandy and a hat refreshed with water [149] Before leaving, he remembered the unfinished manuscript for Our Mutual Friend, and he returned to his carriage to retrieve it [150]\n\n\nSecond visit to the United States\nWhile he contemplated a second visit to the United States, the outbreak of the Civil War in America in 1861 delayed his plans [153] On 9 November 1867, over two years after the war, Dickens set sail from Liverpool for his second American reading tour Landing in Boston, he devoted the rest of the month to a round of dinners with such notables as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and his American publisher, James T Fields In early December, the readings began He performed 76 readings, netting £19,000, from December 1867 to April 1868 [154] Dickens shuttled between Boston and New York, where he gave 22 readings at Steinway Hall Although he had started to suffer from what he called the \"true American catarrh\", he kept to a schedule that would have challenged a much younger man, even managing to squeeze in some sleighing in Central Park [155]\n\n\nFarewell readings\nIn 1868–69, Dickens gave a series of \"farewell readings\" in England, Scotland and Ireland, beginning on 6 October He managed, of a contracted 100 readings, to give 75 in the provinces, with a further 12 in London [154] As he pressed on he was affected by giddiness and fits of paralysis He had a stroke on 18 April 1869 in Chester [158] He collapsed on 22 April 1869, at Preston, Lancashire; on doctor's advice, the tour was cancelled [159] After further provincial readings were cancelled, he began work on his final novel, The Mystery of Edwin Drood It was fashionable in the 1860s to 'do the slums' and, in company, Dickens visited opium dens in Shadwell, where he witnessed an elderly addict called \"Laskar Sal\", who formed the model for \"Opium Sal\" in Edwin Drood [160]\n\n\nDeath\nOn 8 June 1870, Dickens had another stroke at his home after a full day's work on Edwin Drood He never regained consciousness The next day, he died at Gads Hill Place Biographer Claire Tomalin has suggested Dickens was actually in Peckham when he had had the stroke and his mistress Ellen Ternan and her maids had him taken back to Gads Hill so that the public would not know the truth about their relationship [163] Contrary to his wish to be buried at Rochester Cathedral \"in an inexpensive, unostentatious, and strictly private manner\", [164] he was laid to rest in the Poets' Corner of Westminster Abbey A printed epitaph circulated at the time of the funeral reads:\n\n\nLiterary style\nDickens's approach to the novel is influenced by various things, including the picaresque novel tradition, [171] melodrama [172] and the novel of sensibility [173] According to Ackroyd, other than these, perhaps the most important literary influence on him was derived from the fables of The Arabian Nights [174] Satire and irony are central to the picaresque novel [175] Comedy is also an aspect of the British picaresque novel tradition of Laurence Sterne, Henry Fielding and Tobias Smollett Fielding's Tom Jones was a major influence on the 19th-century novelist including Dickens, who read it in his youth [176] and named a son Henry Fielding Dickens after him [177] [178] Influenced by Gothic fiction—a literary genre that began with The Castle of Otranto (1764) by Horace Walpole—Dickens incorporated Gothic imagery, settings and plot devices in his works [179] Victorian gothic moved from castles and abbeys into contemporary urban environments: in particular London, such as Dickens's Oliver Twist and Bleak House The jilted bride Miss Havisham from Great Expectations is one of Dickens's best-known gothic creations; living in a ruined mansion, her bridal gown effectively doubles as her funeral shroud [180]\n\n\nCharacters\nDickens's biographer Claire Tomalin regards him as the greatest creator of character in English fiction after Shakespeare [190]\nDickensian characters are amongst the most memorable in English literature, especially so because of their typically whimsical names The likes of Ebenezer Scrooge, Tiny Tim, Jacob Marley and Bob Cratchit (A Christmas Carol); Oliver Twist, The Artful Dodger, Fagin and Bill Sikes (Oliver Twist); Pip, Miss Havisham, Estella and Abel Magwitch (Great Expectations); Sydney Carton, Charles Darnay and Madame Defarge (A Tale of Two Cities); David Copperfield, Uriah Heep and Mr Micawber (David Copperfield); Daniel Quilp and Nell Trent (The Old Curiosity Shop), Samuel Pickwick and Sam Weller (The Pickwick Papers); and Wackford Squeers (Nicholas Nickleby) are so well known as to be part and parcel of popular culture, and in some cases have passed into ordinary language: a scrooge, for example, is a miser or someone who dislikes Christmas festivity [191]\n\n\nAutobiographical elements\nAuthors frequently draw their portraits of characters from people they have known in real life David Copperfield is regarded by many as a veiled autobiography of Dickens The scenes of interminable court cases and legal arguments in Bleak House reflect Dickens's experiences as a law clerk and court reporter, and in particular his direct experience of the law's procedural delay during 1844 when he sued publishers in Chancery for breach of copyright [201] Dickens's father was sent to prison for debt, and this became a common theme in many of his books, with the detailed depiction of life in the Marshalsea prison in Little Dorrit resulting from Dickens's own experiences of the institution [202] Lucy Stroughill, a childhood sweetheart, may have affected several of Dickens's portraits of girls such as Little Em'ly in David Copperfield and Lucie Manette in A Tale of Two Cities [203] [nb 3]\n\n\nEpisodic writing\nA pioneer of the serial publication of narrative fiction, Dickens wrote most of his major novels in monthly or weekly instalments in journals such as Master Humphrey's Clock and Household Words, later reprinted in book form [4] [5] These instalments made the stories affordable and accessible, with the audience more evenly distributed across income levels than before [205] His instalment format inspired a narrative that he would explore and develop throughout his career, and the regular cliffhangers made each new episode widely anticipated [6] [205] When The Old Curiosity Shop was being serialised, American fans waited at the docks in New York harbour, shouting out to the crew of an incoming British ship, \"Is little Nell dead?\" [206] Dickens was able to incorporate this episodic writing style but still end up with a coherent novel at the end He wrote, \"The thing has to be planned for presentation in these fragments, and yet for afterwards fusing together as an uninterrupted whole.\" [207]\n\n\nSocial commentary\nDickens's novels were, among other things, works of social commentary Simon Callow states, \"From the moment he started to write, he spoke for the people, and the people loved him for it.\" [212] He was a fierce critic of the poverty and social stratification of Victorian society In a New York address, he expressed his belief that \"Virtue shows quite as well in rags and patches as she does in purple and fine linen\" [213] Dickens's second novel, Oliver Twist (1839), shocked readers with its images of poverty and crime: it challenged middle class polemics about criminals, making impossible any pretence to ignorance about what poverty entailed [214] [215]\n\n\nLiterary techniques\nDickens is often described as using idealised characters and highly sentimental scenes to contrast with his caricatures and the ugly social truths he reveals The story of Nell Trent in The Old Curiosity Shop (1841) was received as extremely moving by contemporary readers but viewed as ludicrously sentimental by Oscar Wilde \"One must have a heart of stone to read the death of little Nell\", he said in a famous remark, \"without dissolving into tears .. of laughter.\" [219] [220] G K Chesterton stated, \"It is not the death of little Nell, but the life of little Nell, that I object to\", arguing that the maudlin effect of his description of her life owed much to the gregarious nature of Dickens's grief, his \"despotic\" use of people's feelings to move them to tears in works like this [221]\n\n\nReputation\nDickens was the most popular novelist of his time, [226] and remains one of the best-known and most-read of English authors His works have never gone out of print, [227] and have been adapted continually for the screen since the invention of cinema, [228] with at least 200 motion pictures and TV adaptations based on Dickens's works documented [229] Many of his works were adapted for the stage during his own lifetime—early productions included The Haunted Man which was performed in the West End's Adelphi Theatre in 1848—and, as early as 1901, the British silent film Scrooge, or, Marley's Ghost was made by Walter R Booth [230] Contemporaries such as publisher Edward Lloyd cashed in on Dickens's popularity with cheap imitations of his novels, resulting in his own popular 'penny dreadfuls' [231]\n\n\nLegacy\nMuseums and festivals celebrating Dickens's life and works exist in many places with which Dickens was associated These include the Charles Dickens Museum in London, the historic home where he wrote Oliver Twist, The Pickwick Papers and Nicholas Nickleby; and the Charles Dickens Birthplace Museum in Portsmouth, the house in which he was born The original manuscripts of many of his novels, as well as printers' proofs, first editions and illustrations from the collection of Dickens's friend John Forster are held at the Victoria and Albert Museum [256] Dickens's will stipulated that no memorial be erected in his honour; nonetheless, a life-size bronze statue of Dickens entitled Dickens and Little Nell, cast in 1890 by Francis Edwin Elwell, stands in Clark Park in the Spruce Hill neighbourhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Another life-size statue of Dickens is located at Centennial Park in Sydney, Australia [257] In 1960 a bas-relief sculpture of Dickens, notably featuring characters from his books, was commissioned from sculptor Estcourt J Clack to adorn the office building built on the site of his former home at 1 Devonshire Terrace, London [258] In 2014, a life-size statue was unveiled near his birthplace in Portsmouth on the 202nd anniversary of his birth; this was supported by his great-great-grandsons, Ian and Gerald Dickens [259] [260]\n\n\nWorks\n\n\nNovels and novellas\nDickens's novels and novellas were initially published in weekly and monthly magazines, the novels

Landport in Portsea Island (Portsmouth), Hampshire, the second of eight children of Elizabeth Dickens (née Barrow; 1789–1863) and John Dickens (1785–1851). His father was a clerk in the Navy Pay Office and was temporarily stationed in the district. He asked Christopher Huffam, a rigger to His Majesty's Navy, gentleman and head of an established firm, to act as godfather to Charles Huffam is thought to be the inspiration for Paul Dombey, the owner of a shipping company in Dickens's novel Dombey and Son (1848).\n\n## Career\n\nIn 1832, at the age of 20, Dickens was energetic and increasingly self-confident. He enjoyed mimicry and popular entertainment, lacked a clear, specific sense of what he wanted to become, and yet knew he wanted fame. Drawn to the theatre—he became an early member of the Garrick Club— he landed an acting audition at Covent Garden, where the manager George Bartley and the actor Charles Kemble were to see him. Dickens prepared meticulously and decided to imitate the comedian Charles Mathews, but ultimately he missed the audition because of a cold. Before another opportunity arose, he had set out on his career as a writer.\n\n## Journalism and Writing\n\nIn 1832, at the age of 20, Dickens was energetic and increasingly self-confident. He enjoyed mimicry and popular entertainment, lacked a clear, specific sense of what he wanted to become, and yet knew he wanted fame. Drawn to the theatre—he became an early member of the Garrick Club— he landed an acting audition at Covent Garden, where the manager George Bartley and the actor Charles Kemble were to see him. Dickens prepared meticulously and decided to imitate the comedian Charles Mathews, but ultimately he missed the audition because of a cold. Before another opportunity arose, he had set out on his career as a writer.\n\n## First Visit to the United States\n\nOn 22 January 1842, Dickens and his wife arrived in Boston, Massachusetts, aboard the RMS Britannia during their first trip to the United States and Canada. At this time Georgina Hogarth, another sister of Catherine, joined the Dickens household, now living at Devonshire Terrace, Marylebone to care for the young family they had left behind. She remained with them as housekeeper, organiser, adviser and friend until Dickens's death in 1870. Dickens modelled the character of Agnes Wickfield after Georgina and Mary.\n\n## Return to England\n\nSoon after his return to England, Dickens began work on the first of his Christmas stories, A Christmas Carol, written in 1843, which was followed by The Chimes in 1844 and The Cricket on the Hearth in 1845. Of these, A Christmas Carol was most popular and, tapping into an old tradition, did much to promote a renewed enthusiasm for the joys of Christmas in Britain and America. The seeds for the story became planted in Dickens's mind during a trip to Manchester to witness the conditions of the manufacturing workers there. This, along with scenes he had recently witnessed at the Field Lane Ragged School, caused Dickens to resolve to \"strike a sledge hammer blow\" for the poor. As the idea for the story took shape and the writing began in earnest, Dickens became engrossed in the book. He later wrote that as the tale unfolded he \"wept and laughed, and wept again\" as he \"walked about the black streets of London fifteen or twenty miles many a night when all sober folks had gone to bed\".\n\n## Philanthropy\n\nAngela Burdett Coutts, heir to the Coutts banking fortune, approached Dickens in May 1846 about setting up a home for the redemption of fallen women of the working class. Coutts envisioned a home that would replace the punitive regimes of existing institutions with a reformative environment conducive to education and proficiency in domestic household chores. After initially resisting, Dickens eventually founded the home, named Urania Cottage, in the Lime Grove area of Shepherd's Bush, which he managed for ten years, setting the house rules, reviewing the accounts and interviewing prospective residents. Emigration and marriage were central to Dickens's agenda for the women on leaving Urania Cottage, from which it is estimated that about 100 women graduated between 1847 and 1859.\n\n## Religious Views\n\nAs a young man, Dickens expressed a distaste for certain aspects of organised religion. In 1836, in a pamphlet titled Sunday Under Three Heads, he defended the people's right to pleasure, opposing a plan to prohibit games on Sundays. \"Look into your churches—diminished congregations and scanty attendance People have grown sullen and obstinate, and are becoming disgusted with the faith which condemns them to such a day as this, once in every seven They display their feeling by staying away [from church] Turn into the streets [on a Sunday] and mark the rigid gloom that reigns over everything around\".\n\n## Middle Years\n\nIn December 1845, Dickens took up the editorship of the London-based Daily News, a liberal paper through which Dickens hoped to advocate, in his own words, \"the Principles of Progress and Improvement, of Education and Civil and Religious Liberty and Equal Legislation\". Among the other contributors Dickens chose to write for the paper were the radical economist Thomas Hodgskin and the social reformer Douglas William Jerrold, who frequently attacked the Corn Laws. Dickens lasted only ten weeks on the job before resigning due to a combination of exhaustion and frustration with one of the paper's co-owners.\n\n## Later Life\n\nOn 9 June 1865, while returning from Paris with Ellen Ternan, Dickens was involved in the Staplehurst rail crash in Kent. The train's first seven carriages plunged off a cast iron bridge that was under repair and ten passengers were killed. The only first-class carriage to remain on the track—which was left hanging precariously off the bridge—was the one in which Dickens was travelling. For three hours before rescuers arrived, Dickens tended and comforted the wounded and the dying with a flask of brandy and a hat refreshed with water. Before leaving, he remembered the unfinished manuscript for Our Mutual Friend, and he returned to his carriage to retrieve it.\n\n## Second Visit to the United States\n\nWhile he contemplated a second visit to the United States, the outbreak of the Civil War in America in 1861 delayed his plans. On 9 November 1867, over two years after the war, Dickens set sail from Liverpool for his second American reading tour. Landing in Boston, he devoted the rest of the month to a round of dinners with such notables as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and his American publisher, James T Fields. In early December, the readings began. He performed 76 readings, netting £19,000, from December 1867 to April 1868. Dickens shuttled between Boston and New York, where he gave 22 readings at Steinway Hall. Although he had started to suffer from what he called the \"true American catarrh\", he kept to a schedule that would have challenged a much younger man, even managing to squeeze in some sleighing in Central Park.\n\n## Farewell Readings\n\nIn 1868–69, Dickens gave a series of \"farewell readings\" in England, Scotland and Ireland, beginning on 6 October. He managed, of a contracted 100 readings, to give 75 in the provinces, with a further 12 in London. As he pressed on he was affected by giddiness and fits of paralysis. He had a stroke on 18 April 1869 in Chester. He collapsed on 22 April 1869, at Preston, Lancashire; on doctor's advice, the tour was cancelled. After further provincial readings were cancelled, he began work on his final novel, The Mystery of Edwin Drood. It was fashionable in the 1860s to 'do the slums' and, in company, Dickens visited opium dens in Shadwell, where he witnessed an elderly addict called \"Laskar Sal\", who formed the model for \"Opium Sal\" in Edwin Drood.\n\n## Death\n\nOn 8 June 1870, Dickens had another stroke at his home after a full day's work on Edwin Drood. He never regained consciousness. The next day, he died at Gads Hill Place. Biographer Claire Tomalin has suggested Dickens was actually in Peckham when he had had the stroke and his mistress Ellen Ternan and her maids had him taken back to Gads Hill so that the public would not know the truth about their relationship. Contrary to his wish to be buried at Rochester Cathedral \"in an inexpensive, unostentatious, and strictly private manner\", he was laid to rest in the Poets' Corner of Westminster Abbey. A printed epitaph circulated at the time of the funeral reads:\n\n## Literary Style\n\nDickens's approach to the novel is influenced by various things, including the picaresque novel tradition, melodrama and the novel of sensibility. According to Ackroyd, other than these, perhaps the most important literary influence on him was derived from the fables of The Arabian Nights. Satire and irony are central to the picaresque novel. Comedy is also an aspect of the British picaresque novel tradition of Laurence Sterne, Henry Fielding and Tobias Smollett. Fielding's Tom Jones was a major influence on the 19th-century novelist including Dickens, who read it in his youth and named a son Henry Fielding Dickens after him. Influenced by Gothic fiction—a literary genre that began with The Castle of Otranto (1764) by Horace Walpole—Dickens incorporated Gothic imagery, settings and plot devices in his works. Victorian gothic moved from castles and abbeys into contemporary urban environments: in particular London, such as Dickens's Oliver Twist and Bleak House. The jilted bride Miss Havisham from Great Expectations is one of Dickens's best-known gothic creations; living in a ruined mansion, her bridal gown effectively doubles as her funeral shroud.\n\n## Characters\n\nDickens's biographer Claire Tomalin regards him as the greatest creator of character in English fiction after Shakespeare. Dickensian characters are amongst the most memorable in English literature, especially so because of their typically whimsical names. The likes of Ebenezer Scrooge, Tiny Tim, Jacob Marley and Bob Cratchit (A Christmas Carol); Oliver Twist, The Artful Dodger, Fagin and Bill Sikes (Oliver Twist); Pip, Miss Havisham, Estella and Abel Magwitch (Great Expectations); Sydney Carton, Charles Darnay and Madame Defarge (A Tale of Two Cities); David Copperfield, Uriah Heep and Mr Micawber (David Copperfield); Daniel Quilp and Nell Trent (The Old Curiosity Shop), Samuel Pickwick and Sam Weller (The Pickwick Papers); and Wackford Squeers (Nicholas Nickleby) are so well known as to be part and parcel of popular culture, and in some cases have passed into ordinary language: a scrooge, for example, is a miser or someone who dislikes Christmas festivity.\n\n## Autobiographical Elements\n\nAuthors frequently draw their portraits of characters from people they have known in real life. David Copperfield is regarded by many as a veiled autobiography of Dickens. The scenes of interminable court cases and legal arguments in Bleak House reflect Dickens's experiences as a law clerk and court reporter, and in particular his direct experience of the law's procedural delay during 1844 when he sued publishers in Chancery for breach of copyright. Dickens's father was sent to prison for debt, and this became a common theme in many of his books, with the detailed depiction of life in the Marshalsea prison in Little Dorrit resulting from Dickens's own experiences of the institution. Lucy Stroughill, a childhood sweetheart, may have affected several of Dickens's portraits of girls such as Little Em'ly in David Copperfield and Lucie Manette in A Tale of Two Cities.\n\n## Episodic Writing\n\nA pioneer of the serial publication of narrative fiction, Dickens wrote most of his major novels in monthly or weekly instalments in journals such as Master Humphrey's Clock and Household Words, later reprinted in book form. These instalments made the stories affordable and accessible, with the audience more evenly distributed across income levels than before. His instalment format inspired a narrative that he would explore and develop throughout his career, and the regular cliffhangers made each new episode widely anticipated. When The Old Curiosity Shop was being serialised, American fans waited at the docks in New York harbour, shouting out to the crew of an incoming British ship, \"Is little Nell dead?\" Dickens was able to incorporate this episodic writing style but still end up with a coherent novel at the end. He wrote, \"The thing has to be planned for presentation in these fragments, and yet for afterwards fusing together as an uninterrupted whole.\"\n\n## Social Commentary\n\nDickens's novels were, among other things, works of social commentary. Simon Callow states, \"From the moment he started to write, he spoke for the people, and the people loved him for it.\" He was a fierce critic of the poverty and social stratification of Victorian society. In a New York address, he expressed his belief that \"Virtue shows quite as well in rags and patches as she does in purple and fine linen\" Dickens's second novel, Oliver Twist (1839), shocked readers with its images of poverty and crime: it challenged middle class polemics about criminals, making impossible any pretence to ignorance about what poverty entailed.\n\n## Literary Techniques\n\nDickens is often described as using idealised characters and highly sentimental scenes to contrast with his caricatures and the ugly social truths he reveals.

theme in many of his books, with the detailed depiction of life in the Marshalsea prison in Little Dorrit resulting from Dickens's own experiences of the institution [202] Lucy Stroughill, a childhood sweetheart, may have affected several of Dickens's portraits of girls such as Little Em'ly in David Copperfield and Lucie Manette in A Tale of Two Cities [203] [nb 3]\n\n\nEpisodic writing\nA pioneer of the serial publication of narrative fiction, Dickens wrote most of his major novels in monthly or weekly instalments in journals such as Master Humphrey's Clock and Household Words, later reprinted in book form [4] [5] These instalments made the stories affordable and accessible, with the audience more evenly distributed across income levels than before [205] His instalment format inspired a narrative that he would explore and develop throughout his career, and the regular cliffhangers made each new episode widely anticipated [6] [205] When The Old Curiosity Shop was being serialised, American fans waited at the docks in New York harbour, shouting out to the crew of an incoming British ship, \"Is little Nell dead?\" [206] Dickens was able to incorporate this episodic writing style but still end up with a coherent novel at the end He wrote, \"The thing has to be planned for presentation in these fragments, and yet for afterwards fusing together as an uninterrupted whole.\" [207]\n\n\nSocial commentary\nDickens's novels were, among other things, works of social commentary Simon Callow states, \"From the moment he started to write, he spoke for the people, and the people loved him for it.\" [212] He was a fierce critic of the poverty and social stratification of Victorian society In a New York address, he expressed his belief that \"Virtue shows quite as well in rags and patches as she does in purple and fine linen\" [213] Dickens's second novel, Oliver Twist (1839), shocked readers with its images of poverty and crime: it challenged middle class polemics about criminals, making impossible any pretence to ignorance about what poverty entailed [214] [215]\n\n\nLiterary techniques\nDickens is often described as using idealised characters and highly sentimental scenes to contrast with his caricatures and the ugly social truths he reveals The story of Nell Trent in The Old Curiosity Shop (1841) was received as extremely moving by contemporary readers but viewed as ludicrously sentimental by Oscar Wilde \"One must have a heart of stone to read the death of little Nell\", he said in a famous remark, \"without dissolving into tears .. of laughter.\" [219] [220] G K Chesterton stated, \"It is not the death of little Nell, but the life of little Nell, that I object to\", arguing that the maudlin effect of his description of her life owed much to the gregarious nature of Dickens's grief, his \"despotic\" use of people's feelings to move them to tears in works like this [221]\n\n\nReputation\nDickens was the most popular novelist of his time, [226] and remains one of the best-known and most-read of English authors His works have never gone out of print, [227] and have been adapted continually for the screen since the invention of cinema, [228] with at least 200 motion pictures and TV adaptations based on Dickens's works documented [229] Many of his works were adapted for the stage during his own lifetime—early productions included The Haunted Man which was performed in the West End's Adelphi Theatre in 1848—and, as early as 1901, the British silent film Scrooge, or, Marley's Ghost was made by Walter R Booth [230] Contemporaries such as publisher Edward Lloyd cashed in on Dickens's popularity with cheap imitations of his novels, resulting in his own popular 'penny dreadfuls' [231]\n\n\nLegacy\nMuseums and festivals celebrating Dickens's life and works exist in many places with which Dickens was associated These include the Charles Dickens Museum in London, the historic home where he wrote Oliver Twist, The Pickwick Papers and Nicholas Nickleby; and the Charles Dickens Birthplace Museum in Portsmouth, the house in which he was born The original manuscripts of many of his novels, as well as printers' proofs, first editions and illustrations from the collection of Dickens's friend John Forster are held at the Victoria and Albert Museum [256] Dickens's will stipulated that no memorial be erected in his honour; nonetheless, a life-size bronze statue of Dickens entitled Dickens and Little Nell, cast in 1890 by Francis Edwin Elwell, stands in Clark Park in the Spruce Hill neighbourhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Another life-size statue of Dickens is located at Centennial Park in Sydney, Australia [257] In 1960 a bas-relief sculpture of Dickens, notably featuring characters from his books, was commissioned from sculptor Estcourt J Clack to adorn the office building built on the site of his former home at 1 Devonshire Terrace, London [258] In 2014, a life-size statue was unveiled near his birthplace in Portsmouth on the 202nd anniversary of his birth; this was supported by his great-great-grandsons, Ian and Gerald Dickens [259] [260]\n\n\nWorks\n\n\nNovels and novellas\nDickens's novels and novellas were initially published in weekly and monthly magazines, the novels in serial format, then reprinted in standard book formats.\n\n\nSee

the Rams at the time were based in St Louis [32] However, only one player, Patriots starting quarterback Tom Brady, remained on either roster from that contest Bill Belichick, the Patriots' head coach in the previous contest, also remained in that position for this game [33] Super Bowl LIII featured record setting age differences between each team's starting quarterbacks and head coaches, pitting 41-year-old Brady against 24-year-old Jared Goff, as well as 66-year-old Belichick against 33-year-old Sean McVay [34]\n\n\nAssociated events\nPre-game events and entertainment were centered around downtown Atlanta, with State Farm Arena having hosted Super Bowl Opening Night, the Georgia World Congress Center hosting the Super Bowl Experience and Super Bowl Live at Centennial Olympic Park State Farm Arena also hosted the inaugural Bud Light Super Bowl Music Fest, a three-night concert series that was headlined by Ludacris and Migos (night 1), Aerosmith and Post Malone (night 2), and Bruno Mars and Cardi B (night 3) [50] [51] [52] The show competed with a \"Super Saturday Night\" concert held by DirecTV at a temporary venue near Atlantic Station, headlined by the Foo Fighters and featuring Roger Taylor, Zac Brown, Tom Morello, Perry Farrell and Dave Koz as special guests [53]\n\n\nBroadcasting\nSuper Bowl LIII was broadcast by CBS as part of an annual rotation between the three main broadcast television partners of the NFL It was the 20th time CBS broadcast the game [59]\n\n\nUnited States\nSuper Bowl LIII was broadcast by CBS as part of an annual rotation between the three main broadcast television partners of the NFL It was the 20th time CBS broadcast the game [59]\n\n\nTelevision\nSuper Bowl LIII was broadcast by CBS as part of an annual rotation between the three main broadcast television partners of the NFL It was the 20th time CBS broadcast the game [59]\n\n\nAdvertising\nWith a base price slightly higher than $5 million for a 30-second ad, the cost of commercial time remained even with the previous three events There were fewer spots sold overall in comparison to the previous Super Bowl;

Los Angeles was near the national average [78] A downturn of approximately 5% was noted during the halftime show [78] The fewer television viewers did not migrate to online or mobile platforms; viewership online and on mobile only totaled 2.5 million viewers, which was not an appreciable enough change to affect the overall viewership decline [79]\n\n\nStreaming\nDigitally, this was the first Super Bowl available through CBS's subscription service CBS All Access [80] The game was also available via the CBS Sports app, CBSSports.com, the Yahoo! Sports app, Tumblr app, the NFL app [81] The Yahoo!

company to pull the ad because they deemed it to be misleading [83] [84]\n\n\nEntertainment\nThe musical artists who agreed to perform at the show—including Gladys Knight, Maroon 5, Travis Scott, and Big Boi—were criticized by media outlets, other artists and members of the public for performing at Super Bowl LIII because of the NFL's alleged blacklisting of Colin Kaepernick for protesting police brutality by kneeling during the pre-game national anthem [89] [90] [91] [92] Several artists, including Jay-Z and Cardi B, turned down offers to perform at the game in support of Kaepernick

that pop band Maroon 5 would headline the Super Bowl LIII halftime show They were joined by Big Boi of Outkast and Travis Scott as guests [103] [104] [90] A short clip featuring the cast of SpongeBob SquarePants and a clip from the 2001 episode \"Band Geeks\" was aired as a tribute to series creator Stephen Hillenburg, who died in November 2018 due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [105] The full clip of the \"Sweet Victory\" song, including a dedication to Hillenburg, was played inside the stadium prior to the game [106]\n\n\nGame summary\nThe Patriots received first possession as

It was played on February 3, 2019, at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia. The New England Patriots faced the Los Angeles Rams in the game, with the Patriots ultimately emerging victorious by a score of 13-3.\n\n**Background**\n\nOn May 19, 2015, the league announced the four finalists that would compete to host Super Bowl LIII in 2019, LIV in 2020, and LV in 2021. NFL owners voted on these cities on May 24, 2016, with the first round of voting determining the host for Super Bowl LIII, the second round deciding a different site for Super Bowl LIV, and the third round deciding the site for Super Bowl LV. The four finalists for Super Bowl LIII, all in the Southeastern United States, were: Atlanta, Georgia; Houston, Texas; Miami, Florida; and New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\n**Host-selection process**\n\nThe host-selection process for Super Bowl LIII began on May 19, 2015, when the league announced the four finalists. The four cities were chosen from a list of 16 cities that had expressed interest in hosting the game. The selection process involved three rounds of voting by NFL owners, with the first round determining the host for Super Bowl LIII, the second round deciding a different site for Super Bowl LIV, and the third round deciding the site for Super Bowl LV.\n\n**Teams**\n\nThe New England Patriots finished the 2018 season with an 11-5 record to earn the #2 seed in the AFC. They went on to join the Miami Dolphins and Buffalo Bills as the only teams in NFL history to ever reach three consecutive Super Bowls. The Patriots had only two Pro Bowl selections, but they scored 436 points (fourth in the league) while giving up only 325 (seventh fewest).\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams finished the 2018 season earning the #2 seed in the NFC, before knocking off the fourth seeded Dallas Cowboys in the divisional round and top seeded New Orleans Saints in the NFC Championship to earn their fourth Super Bowl in franchise history. The Rams went from 2004 to 2016 without recording a winning record, but the team's fortunes changed with the hiring of 30-year-old head coach Sean McVay, the youngest head coach in NFL history.\n\n**Playoffs**\n\nIn the playoffs, the Patriots earned a first-round bye as the AFC's second overall seed. In the divisional round, they defeated the Los Angeles Chargers 41-28, scoring touchdowns on five of their first six possessions. Tom Brady passed for 343 yards and a touchdown, while running back Sony Michel rushed for 129 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nThe Patriots then defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 37-31 in the AFC Championship Game, scoring the game-winning touchdown in overtime. The Patriots held a 14-0 lead at halftime, before the Chiefs rallied to take the lead 21-17 in the fourth quarter. From there, both teams took turns taking the lead, until the Chiefs forced overtime with a 39-yard field goal by Harrison Butker to tie the game 31-31. The Patriots won the coin toss to start their offense for overtime, where Rex Burkhead scored a two-yard touchdown to win the game.\n\n**Pre-game notes**\n\nThe game was a rematch of Super Bowl XXXVI between the Patriots and the Rams; the Rams at the time were based in St Louis. However, only one player, Patriots starting quarterback Tom Brady, remained on either roster from that contest. Bill Belichick, the Patriots' head coach in the previous contest, also remained in that position for this game. Super Bowl LIII featured record-setting age differences between each team's starting quarterbacks and head coaches, pitting 41-year-old Brady against 24-year-old Jared Goff, as well as 66-year-old Belichick against 33-year-old Sean McVay.\n\n**Associated events**\n\nPre-game events and entertainment were centered around downtown Atlanta, with State Farm Arena having hosted Super Bowl Opening Night, the Georgia World Congress Center hosting the Super Bowl Experience and Super Bowl Live at Centennial Olympic Park. State Farm Arena also hosted the inaugural Bud Light Super Bowl Music Fest, a three-night concert series that was headlined by Ludacris and Migos (night 1), Aerosmith and Post Malone (night 2), and Bruno Mars and Cardi B (night 3).\n\n**Broadcasting**\n\nSuper Bowl LIII was broadcast by CBS as part of an annual rotation between the three main broadcast television partners of the NFL. It was the 20th time CBS broadcast the game.\n\n**Advertising**\n\nWith a base price slightly higher than $5 million for a 30-second ad, the cost of commercial time remained even with the previous three events. There were fewer spots sold overall in comparison to the previous Super Bowl; CBS aired more than double the number of promos for its own programming (as well as that of its subscription service CBS All Access) than NBC did at Super Bowl LII. Despite this, Kantar estimated its total revenue to be the third-highest in Super Bowl history, at $382 million.\n\n**Lead-out programs**\n\nCBS's lead-out program was the series premiere of the talent competition series The World's Best. After late local programs, CBS also aired a special Sunday-night episode of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\n\n**Ratings**\n\nInitial overnight Nielsen Ratings measured a 44.9 rating for the game, down 5% from the previous year and the lowest rating for a Super Bowl since Super Bowl XLIII ten years prior. 98.2 million viewers were measured, the fewest since Super Bowl XLII. Jemele Hill of The Atlantic attributed the low ratings \"to the game being the lowest-scoring Super Bowl ever, moderate national interest in the Rams, the lingering bad taste from the huge blown call in the NFC Championship Game, and Patriots fatigue.\" In New Orleans, whose Saints had lost the NFC Championship in part because of the blown call, ratings were down 51% compared to Super Bowl LII as Louisianans boycotted and refused to watch the game.\n\n**Streaming**\n\nDigitally, this was the first Super Bowl available through CBS's subscription service CBS All Access. The game was also available via the CBS Sports app, CBSSports.com, the Yahoo! Sports app, Tumblr app, the NFL app. The Yahoo! Sports app and Tumblr app streams were part of a long-term deal between the NFL and Verizon Media.\n\n**Radio**\n\nThe game was broadcast on radio nationally on Westwood One. SiriusXM carried the game in eight languages and hometown broadcasts from Boston's WBZ-FM and Los Angeles's KSPN and KCBS-FM, along with the main feed on Sirius XM NFL Radio.\n\n**International**\n\nIn Canada, the game was aired by CTV, CTV 2, and TSN. Unifor purchased time on the Canadian broadcast to air an attack ad criticizing General Motors' decision to close the Oshawa Car Assembly plant, defying demands from the company to pull the ad because they deemed it to be misleading.\n\n**Entertainment**\n\nThe musical artists who agreed to perform at the show—including Gladys Knight, Maroon 5, Travis Scott, and Big Boi—were criticized by media outlets, other artists, and members of the public for performing at Super Bowl LIII because of the NFL's alleged blacklisting of Colin Kaepernick for protesting police brutality by kneeling during the pre-game national anthem. Several artists, including Jay-Z and Cardi B, turned down offers to perform at the game in support of Kaepernick.\n\n**Pre-game**\n\nThe NFL had Mercedes-Benz Stadium's retractable roof open for the pre-game ceremonies and closed it prior to kickoff.\n\n**Halftime show**\n\nOn January 13, 2019, the NFL announced that pop band Maroon 5 would headline the Super Bowl LIII halftime show. They were joined by Big Boi of Outkast and Travis Scott as guests. A short clip featuring the cast of SpongeBob SquarePants and a clip from the 2001 episode \"Band Geeks\" was aired as a tribute to series creator Stephen Hillenburg, who died in November 2018 due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\n\n**Game summary**\n\nThe Patriots received first possession as Cordarrelle Patterson returned the opening kickoff 38 yards to the Patriots' 39-yard line and the team picked up 27 yards with their next five plays. On quarterback Tom Brady's first pass attempt of the day, cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman, who was notable for a non-call on pass interference in the NFC Championship two weeks earlier, deflected a pass intended for wide receiver Chris Hogan, allowing linebacker Cory Littleton to make an interception, setting the Rams up at their own 27-yard line. The turnover had no avail, as the Patriots forced a three-and-out and the game's first punt. The Patriots drove 45 yards in 11 plays, the longest a 19-yard catch by tight end Rob Gronkowski. Placekicker Stephen Gostkowski missed a field goal attempt from 46 yards, still keeping the game scoreless.\n\nThe Rams picked up a first down at the Patriots' 49-yard line on the very next play but were again unable to move the ball beyond that point and again, the Patriots threatened to score when Brady completed a 25-yard pass to Julian Edelman at the Rams 45-yard line. But on the next play, Brady was strip-sacked by Rams defensive end John Franklin-Myers, but Patriots center David Andrews recovered the fumble. However, the team was only able to get as far as the Rams' 40 before fourth down and had to punt with 18 seconds left in the first quarter.\n\n**First half**\n\nThe Patriots received first possession as Cordarrelle Patterson returned the opening kickoff 38 yards to the Patriots' 39-yard line and the team picked up 27 yards with their next five plays.

However, the team was only able to get as far as the Rams' 40 before fourth down and had to punt with 18 seconds left in the first quarter.\n\n**Second half**\n\nThe defensive duel continued into the second half as both teams punted twice (one of them was a Super Bowl record 65-yard punt by the Rams' Johnny Hekker). With 6:33 left in the third quarter, the Rams opened their first drive of more than five plays and their first not to end in a punt, moving the ball 42 yards in 10 plays. On the third play of the drive, Rams quarterback Jared Goff completed a 15-yard pass to wide receiver Brandin Cooks and later made his first third-down conversion with an 18-yard pass to Robert Woods on 3rd-and-6. On 3rd-and-7 from the Patriots' 26-yard line, Goff was sacked for a 9-yard loss by Patriots linebacker Dont'a Hightower, but Rams kicker Greg Zuerlein was able to kick a 53-yard field goal, the second-longest in Super Bowl history, to tie the game at 3-3 with 2:11 left in the third quarter. It would be their only score.\n\nThe Patriots took the ball back and drove to the Rams' 44-yard line but could not go any further and had to punt on the first play of the fourth quarter. For the first time in Super Bowl history, both teams had gone three quarters without scoring a touchdown.\n\n**Totals**\n\nBrady completed 21 of 35 passes for 262 yards, with one interception. Edelman was his top target with 10 receptions for 141 yards, while Gronkowski made six receptions for 87 yards in his final game with the Patriots. Michel was the top rusher of the game with 94 yards and a touchdown. Gilmore had five solo tackles and an interception. Goff finished the day 19-for-38 passing, for 229 yards and an interception. Cooks was his top receiver with eight receptions for 120 yards. Littleton had 10 tackles (six solo) and an interception. Hekker punted nine times for 417 yards, an average of 46.3 yards per punt, and put five punts inside the 20. The Rams were only the second team in Super Bowl history to not score a touchdown, the first having been the Miami Dolphins in Super Bowl VI after the 1971 season.\n\n**Box score**\n\nat Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Atlanta, Georgia\n\n**Final statistics**\n\n1.

Guangxi from the 333 BCE-11th centuries, hundreds of thousands of Tais were killed, [44]: 5  [45]: 193, 239–249  thus, Tai people began to move southwestward along the rivers and over the lower passes into the mountain north of Southeast Asia and river valleys in present-day Assam of India [46] [47] Some evidence indicates that the ancestors of Tai people migrated en masse southwestwards out of Yunnan only after the 1253 Mongol invasion of Dali, but not generally accepted [48]: 38 \n\n\nMon and Lavo Kingdoms: (5th century CE – 13th century CE)\nAs is generally known, the present-day Thai people were previously called Siamese before the country was renamed Thailand in the mid-20th century [16] Several genetic studies published in the 21st century suggest that the so-called Siamese people (central Thai) might have had Mon origins since their genetic profiles are more closely related to the Mon people in Myanmar than the Tais in southern China, [37] and they probably later became Tais via cultural diffusion after the arriving of Tai people from the north around the 8th–10th centuries [51] [69] [70] This is also reflected in the language since over half of the vocabulary in the central Thai language is derived from or borrowed from the Mon language as well as Pali and Sanskrit [69] [71] Moreover, the Jinakalamali chronicle of Tai's Lan Na also called the southern region occupied by the Mon Haripuñjaya of Dvaravati as Shyam Pradesh (lit. 'the land of Siam people'), which indicates that the ancient Siamese and the Mon people in central Thailand were probably the same ethnolinguistic group [72]\n\n\nSukhothai Kingdom (1238 CE – 14th century CE)\nAfter the decline of the Khmer Empire and Kingdom of Pagan in the early 13th century, various states thrived in their place The domains of Tai people existed from the northeast of present-day India to the north of present-day Laos and to the Malay Peninsula [34]: 38–9  During the 13th century, Tai people had already settled in the core land of Dvaravati and Lavo Kingdom to Nakhon Si Thammarat in the south There are, however, no records detailing the arrival of the Tais [34]: 50–1 \n\n\nAyutthaya Kingdom (1351–1767)\nAccording to the most widely accepted version of its origin, the Ayutthaya Kingdom rose from the earlier, nearby Lavo Kingdom and Suvarnabhumi with Uthong as its first king Ayutthaya was a patchwork of self-governing principalities and tributary provinces owing allegiance to the King of Ayutthaya under the mandala system [80]: 355  Its initial expansion was through conquest and political marriage Before the end of the 15th century, Ayutthaya invaded the Khmer Empire three times and sacked its capital Angkor [81]: 26  Ayutthaya then became a regional power in place of the Khmer Constant interference of Sukhothai effectively made it a vassal state of Ayutthaya and it was finally incorporated into the kingdom Borommatrailokkanat brought about bureaucratic reforms which lasted into the 20th century and created a system of social hierarchy called sakdina, where male commoners were conscripted as corvée labourers for six months a year [82]: 107  Ayutthaya was interested in the Malay Peninsula, but failed to conquer the Malacca Sultanate which was supported by the Chinese Ming dynasty [26]: 11, 13 \n\n\nThonburi Kingdom (1767–1782)\nThe capital and many of its territories lay in chaos after the war The former capital was occupied by the Burmese garrison army and five local leaders declared themselves overlords, including the lords of Sakwangburi, Phitsanulok, Pimai, Chanthaburi, and Nakhon Si Thammarat Chao Tak, a capable military leader, proceeded to make himself a lord by right of conquest, beginning with the legendary sack of Chanthaburi Based at Chanthaburi, Chao Tak raised troops and resources, and sent a fleet up the Chao Phraya to take the fort of Thonburi In the same year, Chao Tak was able to retake Ayutthaya from the Burmese only seven months after the fall of the city [86]\n\n\nRattanakosin Kingdom and modernization (1782 –1932)\nUnder Rama I (1782–1809), Rattanakosin successfully defended against Burmese attacks and put an end to Burmese incursions He also created suzerainty over large portions of Laos and Cambodia [87] In 1821, Briton John Crawfurd was sent to negotiate a new trade agreement with Siam – the first sign of an issue which was to dominate 19th century Siamese politics [88] Bangkok signed the Burney Treaty in 1826, after the British victory in the First Anglo-Burmese War [82]: 281  Anouvong of Vientiane, who mistakenly held the belief that Britain was about to launch an invasion of Bangkok, started the Lao rebellion in 1826 which was suppressed [82]: 283–5  Vientiane was destroyed and a large number of Lao people were relocated to Khorat Plateau as a result [82]: 285–6  Bangkok also waged several wars with Vietnam, where Siam successfully regained hegemony over Cambodia [82]: 290–2 \n\n\nConstitutional monarchy, World War II and Cold War (1932–1975)\nA bloodless revolution took place in 1932, in which Prajadhipok was forced to grant the country's first constitution, thereby ending centuries of feudal and absolute monarchy The combined results of economic hardships brought on by the Great Depression, sharply falling rice prices, and a significant reduction in public spending caused discontent among aristocrats [26]: 25  In 1933, a counter-revolutionary rebellion occurred which aimed to reinstate absolute monarchy, but failed [82]: 446–8  Prajadhipok's conflict with the government eventually led to abdication The government selected Ananda Mahidol, who was studying in Switzerland, to be the new king [82]: 448–9 \n\n\nContemporary history\nConstant unrest and instability, as well as fear of a communist takeover after the fall of Saigon, made some ultra-right groups brand leftist students as communists [82]: 548  This culminated in the Thammasat University massacre in October 1976 [82]: 548–9  A coup d'état on that day brought Thailand a new ultra-right government, which cracked down on media outlets, officials, and intellectuals, and fuelled the communist insurgency Another coup the following year installed a more moderate government, which offered amnesty to communist fighters in 1978 [95]\n\n\nGeography\nTotalling 513,120 square kilometres (198,120 sq mi), Thailand is the 50th-largest country by total area [1] Thailand comprises several distinct geographic regions, partly corresponding to the provincial groups The north of the country is the mountainous area of the Thai highlands, with the highest point being Doi Inthanon in the Thanon Thong Chai Range at 2,565 metres (8,415 ft) above sea level The northeast, Isan, consists of the Khorat Plateau, bordered to the east by the Mekong River The centre of the country is dominated by the predominantly flat Chao Phraya river valley, which runs into the Gulf of Thailand Southern Thailand consists of the narrow Kra Isthmus that widens into the Malay Peninsula.\n\n\nClimate\nThailand's climate is influenced by monsoon winds that have a seasonal character (the southwest and northeast monsoon) [122]: 2  Most of the country is classified as Köppen's tropical savanna climate [123] The majority of the south as well as the eastern tip of the east have a tropical monsoon climate Parts of the south also have a tropical rainforest climate.\n\n\nBiodiversity and conservation\nNational parks in Thailand are defined as an area that contains natural resources of ecological importance or unique beauty, or flora and fauna of special importance Thailand's protected areas include 156 national parks, 58 wildlife sanctuaries, 67 non-hunting areas, and 120 forest parks They cover almost 31 per cent of the kingdom's territory [127] The parks are administered by the National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation Department (DNP) of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MNRE).\n\n\nPolitics and government\nPrior to 1932, Thai kings were feudal or absolute monarchs During Sukhothai Kingdom, the king was seen as a Dharmaraja or 'king who rules in accordance with Dharma' The system of government was a network of tributaries ruled by local lords Modern absolute monarchy and statehood was established by Chulalongkorn when he transformed the decentralized protectorate system into a unitary state On 24 June 1932, Khana Ratsadon (People's Party) carried out a bloodless revolution which marked the beginning of constitutional monarchy.\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nThailand is a unitary state; the administrative services of the executive branch are divided into three levels by National Government Organisation Act, BE 2534 (1991): central, provincial and local Thailand is composed of 76 provinces (จังหวัด, changwat), [160] which are first-level administrative divisions There are also two specially governed districts: the capital Bangkok and Pattaya Bangkok is at provincial level and thus often counted as a province Each province is divided into districts (อำเภอ, amphoe) and the districts are further divided into sub-districts (ตำบล, tambons) The name of each province's capital city (เมือง, mueang) is the same as that of the province For example, the capital of Chiang Mai Province (Changwat Chiang Mai) is Mueang Chiang Mai or Chiang Mai All provincial governors and district chiefs, which are administrators of provinces and districts respectively, are appointed by the central government [161] Thailand's provinces are sometimes grouped into four to six regions, depending on the source.\n\n\nForeign relations\nSiam's and Thailand's way of conducting foreign relations has long been described as \"bamboo bending with the wind\", of policies that are \"always solidly rooted, but flexible enough to bend whichever way the wind blows in order to survive,\" [162] or adaptable and pragmatic In order to secure independence, it sought to pit one great power against the others so that it would be dominated by none [163]\n\n\nArmed forces\nThe Royal Thai Armed Forces (กองทัพไทย; RTGS: Kong Thap Thai) constitute the military of the Kingdom of Thailand It consists of the Royal Thai Army (กองทัพบกไทย), the Royal Thai Navy (กองทัพเรือไทย), and the Royal Thai Air Force (กองทัพอากาศไทย) It also incorporates various paramilitary forces [citation needed]\n\n\nEconomy\nThe economy of Thailand is heavily export-dependent, with exports accounting for more than two-thirds of gross domestic product (GDP) Thailand exports over US$105 billion worth of goods and services annually [1] Major exports include cars, computers, electrical appliances, rice, textiles and footwear, fishery products, rubber, and jewellery [1]\n\n\nIncome and wealth disparities\nThais have median wealth per one adult person of $1,469 in 2016, [209]: 98  increasing from $605 in 2010 [209]: 34  In 2016, Thailand was ranked 87th in Human Development Index, and 70th in the inequality-adjusted HDI [210]\n\n\nExports and manufacturing\nThe economy of Thailand is heavily export-dependent, with exports accounting for more than two-thirds of gross domestic products (GDPs) Major exports include cars, computers, electrical appliances, rice, textiles and footwear, fishery products, rubber, and jewellery [1] In 2022, Thailand's export of goods is worth roughly US$290 billion while its import worth roughly US$305 billion [218]\n\n\nTourism\nTourism makes up about 6% of the country's economy Prior to the pandemic, Thailand was the world's eighth most visited country according to the World Tourism rankings compiled by the United Nations World Tourism Organization In 2019, Thailand received 39.8 million international tourists, ahead of United Kingdom and Germany [224] and was the fourth highest in international tourism earning 60.5 billion US dollars.\n\n\nAgriculture and natural resources\nForty-nine per cent of Thailand's labour force is employed in agriculture [234] This is down from 70% in 1980 [234] Rice is the most important crop in the country and Thailand had long been the world's leading exporter of rice, until recently falling behind both India and Vietnam [235] Thailand has the highest percentage of arable land, 27.25%, of any state in the Greater Mekong Subregion [236] About 55% of the arable land area is used for rice production [237]\n\n\nInformal economy\nIn 2012, it was estimated that informal workers comprised 62.6% of the Thai workforce The Ministry of Labour defines informal workers to be individuals who work in informal economies and do not have employee status under a given country's Labour Protection Act (LPA) The informal sector in Thailand has grown significantly over the past 60 years over the course of Thailand's gradual transition from an agriculture-based economy to becoming more industrialised and service-oriented [240] Between 1993 and 1995, ten per cent of the Thai labour force moved from the agricultural sector to urban and industrial jobs, especially in the manufacturing sector It is estimated that between 1988 and 1995, the number of factory workers in the country doubled from two to four million, as Thailand's GDP tripled [241]\n\n\nScience and technology\nThailand ranked 41st in the Global Innovation Index in 2024 [246] The Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation and its agencies oversees the development of science, technology, and research in Thailand According to the National Research Council of Thailand, the country devoted 1.1% of its GDP to the research and development of science in 2019, with over 166,788 research and development personnel in full-time equivalent that year [247] [248]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nThe State Railway of Thailand (SRT) operates all of Thailand's national rail lines Krung Thep Aphiwat Central Terminal and Bangkok (Hua Lamphong) are the main termini of intercity routes Phahonyothin and ICD Lat Krabang are the main freight terminals As of 2024 [update] SRT had 4,507 km (2,801 mi) of track, all of it meter gauge Nearly all is single-track (2,847.1 km), although some important sections around Bangkok are double (1,089.9 km or 677.2 mi) or triple-tracked (107 km or 66 mi), and there are plans to extend this [249] [250]\n\n\nTransportation\nThe State Railway of Thailand (SRT) operates all of Thailand's national rail lines Krung Thep Aphiwat Central Terminal and Bangkok (Hua Lamphong) are the main termini of

of Thailand's electrical generation is powered by natural gas in 2014 [258] Coal-fired power plants produce an additional 20% of electricity, with the remainder coming from biomass, hydro, and biogas [258] Compared to other ASEAN's countries, Thailand is the largest importer of gas in weight [259]: 17  In 2022, Thailand's oil and gas production dropped by 19% and 17%, respectively [260] [259]: 8 \n\n\nDemographics\nEthnic groups\nof Thailand(2015 estimate by The World Factbook) [1]\n\n\nEthnic groups\nAs of 2010, Thai people make up the majority of Thailand's population (95.9%) The remaining 4.1% of the population are Burmese (2.0%), others (1.3%), and unspecified (0.9%) [1]\n\n\nPopulation centres\nThe official language of Thailand is Thai, a Kra–Dai language closely related to Lao, Shan in Myanmar, and numerous smaller languages spoken in an arc from Hainan and Yunnan south to the Chinese border It is the principal language of education and government and spoken throughout the country [275] The standard is based on the dialect of the central Thai people, and it is written in the Thai alphabet, an abugida script that evolved from the Khmer alphabet [276] Sixty-two languages were recognised by the Royal Thai Government [277] For the purposes of the national census, four dialects of Thai exist; these partly coincide with regional designations, such as Southern Thai and Northern Thai [275]\n\n\nLanguage\nThe official language of Thailand is Thai, a Kra–Dai language closely related to Lao, Shan in Myanmar, and numerous smaller languages spoken in an arc from

[2]\n\n\nEducation\nIn 1995, as minister of education, Sukavich Rangsitpollaid let out his plans for educational reform in Thailand [284] The reform was considered a landmark movement after nearly 100 years of education under the previous system [285] Thailand's youth literacy rate was 98.1% in 2015 [286] Education is provided by a school system of kindergartens, primary, lower secondary and upper secondary schools, numerous vocational colleges, and universities Education is compulsory up to and including age 14, while the government is mandated to provide free education through to age 17 Issues concerning university entrance have been in constant upheaval for a number of years The country is also one of the few that still mandates uniform up to the university years, which is still a subject of ongoing debate [287]\n\n\nHealth\nThailand ranks world's sixth, and Asia's first in the 2019 Global Health Security Index of global health security capabilities in 195 countries, [301] making it the only developing country on the world's top ten Thailand had 62 hospitals accredited by Joint Commission International [302] In 2002, Bumrungrad became the first hospital in Asia to meet the standard [303]\n\n\nCulture\nThai culture and traditions incorporate influences from India, China, Cambodia, and the rest of Southeast Asia Thailand's national religion, Theravada Buddhism, is central to modern Thai identity Thai Buddhism has evolved over time to include many regional beliefs originating from Hinduism, animism, as well as ancestor worship The official calendar in Thailand is based on the Eastern version of the Buddhist Era (BE) Thai identity today is a social construct of the Phibun regime in the 1940s [308] [309] [310]\n\n\nArt\nThe origins of Thai art were influenced by Buddhist art and by scenes from the Indian epics Traditional Thai sculpture almost exclusively depicts images of the Buddha, being very similar with the other styles from Southeast Asia Traditional Thai paintings usually consist of book illustrations, and painted ornamentation of buildings such as palaces and temples Thai art was influenced by indigenous civilisations of the Mon and other civilisations By the Sukothai and Ayutthaya periods, Thai had developed into its own unique style and was later further influenced by the other Asian styles, mostly by Sri Lankan and Chinese Thai sculpture and painting, and the royal courts provided patronage, erecting temples and other religious shrines as acts of merit or to commemorate important events [314]\n\n\nArchitecture\nThe Ayutthaya Kingdom movement is designed to display might and riches The temples in Ayutthaya seldom built eaves stretching from the masterhead [316] Buddhist temples in Thailand are known as \"wats\", from the Pāḷi vāṭa, meaning an enclosure: a temple has an enclosing wall that divides it from the secular world Wat architecture demonstrates many differences in layout and style, but they all adhere to the same principles [317]\n\n\nLiterature\nThai literature has had a long history Even before the establishment of the Sukhothai Kingdom there existed oral and written works [citation needed]\n\n\nMusic and dance\nAside from folk and regional dances (southern Thailand's Menora and Ramwong, for example), the two major forms of Thai classical dance drama are Khon and Lakhon nai In the beginning, both were exclusively court entertainments, and it was not until much later that a popular style of dance theatre, likay, evolved as a diversion for common folk [323] Folk dance forms include dance theater forms like likay, numerous regional dances (ram), the ritual dance ram muay, and homage to the teacher, wai khru [324] Both ram muay and wai khru take place before all traditional muay Thai matches [citation needed]\n\n\nEntertainment\nThai films are exported and exhibited in Southeast Asia [326] Thai cinema has developed its own unique identity [327] The Thai heist thriller film Bad Genius (2017) was one of the most internationally successful Thai films; it broke Thai film earning records in several Asian countries, [328] Bad Genius won in 12 categories at the 27th Suphannahong National Film Awards, and also won the Jury Award at the 16th New York Asian Film Festival with a worldwide collection of more than $42 million [329] Shutter (2004) was one of the best-known Thai horror movies and was recognized worldwide [330] Films such as Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior (2003) and Tom-Yum-Goong (2005), starring Tony Jaa, feature distinctive aspects of Thai martial arts \"Muay Thai\" Thailand television dramas, known as Lakorn, have become popular in Thailand and regionally [331]\n\n\nCuisine\nThai cuisine is one of the most popular in the world [335] Common ingredients include garlic, lemongrass, kaffir lime, galangal, turmeric, coriander, and coconut milk [336] [337] [338] [339] [340] Each region of Thailand has its specialities: kaeng khiao wan (green curry) in the central region, som tam (green papaya salad) in the northeast, khao soi in the north, and massaman curry in the south [citation needed]\n\n\nUnits of measurement\nThailand generally uses the metric system, but traditional units of measurement for land area are used, and imperial units of measurement are occasionally used for building materials Years are numbered as B.E (Buddhist Era) in educational settings, civil service, government, contracts, and newspaper datelines However, in banking, and increasingly in industry and commerce, standard Western year (Christian or Common Era) counting is the standard practice [347]\n\n\nSports\nMuay Thai (lit. 'Thai boxing') is a combat sport that uses stand-up striking along with various clinching techniques Muay Thai became widespread internationally in the late-20th to 21st centuries Famous practitioners include Buakaw Banchamek, Samart Payakaroon, and Apidej Sit-Hirun [348] Association football has overtaken Muay Thai as the most widely followed sport in Thailand The Thailand national football team has played the AFC Asian Cup six times and reached the semifinals in 1972 The country has hosted the Asian Cup twice, in 1972 [349] and in 2007 (along with Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam for the 2007).\n\n\nSee also\nGovernment\n\n\nNotes\nGovernment\n\n\nReferences\nGovernment\n\n\nFurther reading\nGovernment\n\n\nExternal

It is bordered by Myanmar (Burma) to the west, Laos to the north and northeast, Cambodia to the east, and Malaysia to the south. The country has a rich history and culture, with a unique blend of traditional and modern influences.\n\nEtymology\n-----------\n\nThailand was known by outsiders prior to 1939 as Siam. According to George Cœdès, the word Thai (ไทย) means 'free man' in the Thai language, differentiating the Thai from the natives encompassed in Thai society as serfs. However, Chit Phumisak, a Thai historian, believed that Thai (ไท) simply means 'people' or 'human being', and his investigation shows that some rural areas used the word \"Thai\" instead of the usual Thai word khon (คน) for people. Michel Ferlus, a French linguist, suggests that the ethnonyms Thai-Tai (or Thay-Tay) would have evolved from the etymon *k(ə)ri: 'human being'.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\nThere is evidence of continuous human habitation in present-day Thailand from 20,000 years ago to the present day. The earliest evidence of rice growing is dated at 2,000 BCE. Areas comprising what is now Thailand participated in the Maritime Jade Road, as ascertained by archeological research. The trading network existed for 3,000 years, between 2000 BCE to 1000 CE. Bronze appeared c. 1,250-1,000 BCE. The site of Ban Chiang in northeast Thailand currently ranks as the earliest known centre of copper and bronze production in Southeast Asia. Iron appeared around 500 BCE. The Kingdom of Funan was the first and most powerful Southeast Asian kingdom at the time (2nd century BCE). The Mon people established the principalities of Dvaravati and Kingdom of Hariphunchai in the 6th century. The Khmer people established the Khmer empire, centred in Angkor, in the 9th century. Tambralinga, a Malay state controlling trade through the Malacca Strait, rose in the 10th century.\n\nEarly Tai confederate cities: (691 BCE – 13th century CE)\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nTheoretically, Tai-Kadai-speaking people formed as early as the 12th century BCE in the middle of the Yangtze basin. Some groups later migrated south to Guangxi. However, after several bloody centuries against Chinese influence in Guangxi from the 333 BCE-11th centuries, hundreds of thousands of Tais were killed. Tai people began to move southwestward along the rivers and over the lower passes into the mountain north of Southeast Asia and river valleys in present-day Assam of India. Some evidence indicates that the ancestors of Tai people migrated en masse southwestwards out of Yunnan only after the 1253 Mongol invasion of Dali, but not generally accepted.\n\nMon and Lavo Kingdoms: (5th century CE – 13th century CE)\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs is generally known, the present-day Thai people were previously called Siamese before the country was renamed Thailand in the mid-20th century. Several genetic studies published in the 21st century suggest that the so-called Siamese people (central Thai) might have had Mon origins since their genetic profiles are more closely related to the Mon people in Myanmar than the Tais in southern China. They probably later became Tais via cultural diffusion after the arriving of Tai people from the north around the 8th-10th centuries. This is also reflected in the language since over half of the vocabulary in the central Thai language is derived from or borrowed from the Mon language as well as Pali and Sanskrit.\n\nSukhothai Kingdom (1238 CE – 14th century CE)\n------------------------------------------\n\nAfter the decline of the Khmer Empire and Kingdom of Pagan in the early 13th century, various states thrived in their place. The domains of Tai people existed from the northeast of present-day India to the north of present-day Laos and to the Malay Peninsula. During the 13th century, Tai people had already settled in the core land of Dvaravati and Lavo Kingdom to Nakhon Si Thammarat in the south. There are, however, no records detailing the arrival of the Tais.\n\nAyutthaya Kingdom (1351–1767)\n------------------------------\n\nAccording to the most widely accepted version of its origin, the Ayutthaya Kingdom rose from the earlier, nearby Lavo Kingdom and Suvarnabhumi with Uthong as its first king. Ayutthaya was a patchwork of self-governing principalities and tributary provinces owing allegiance to the King of Ayutthaya under the mandala system. Its initial expansion was through conquest and political marriage. Before the end of the 15th century, Ayutthaya invaded the Khmer Empire three times and sacked its capital Angkor. Ayutthaya then became a regional power in place of the Khmer.\n\nThonburi Kingdom (1767–1782)\n---------------------------\n\nThe capital and many of its territories lay in chaos after the war. The former capital was occupied by the Burmese garrison army and five local leaders declared themselves overlords, including the lords of Sakwangburi, Phitsanulok, Pimai, Chanthaburi, and Nakhon Si Thammarat.

He also created suzerainty over large portions of Laos and Cambodia. In 1821, Briton John Crawfurd was sent to negotiate a new trade agreement with Siam – the first sign of an issue which was to dominate 19th century Siamese politics. Bangkok signed the Burney Treaty in 1826, after the British victory in the First Anglo-Burmese War. Anouvong of Vientiane, who mistakenly held the belief that Britain was about to launch an invasion of Bangkok, started the Lao rebellion in 1826 which was suppressed.\n\nConstitutional monarchy, World War II and Cold War (1932–1975)\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nA bloodless revolution took place in 1932, in which Prajadhipok was forced to grant the country's first constitution, thereby ending centuries of feudal and absolute monarchy. The combined results of economic hardships brought on by the Great Depression, sharply falling rice prices, and a significant reduction in public spending caused discontent among aristocrats. In 1933, a counter-revolutionary rebellion occurred which aimed to reinstate absolute monarchy, but failed.\n\nGeography\n----------\n\nThailand is a landlocked country, bordered by Myanmar to the west, Laos to the north and northeast, Cambodia to the east, and Malaysia to the south. The country has a total area of 513,120 square kilometers and a population of over 69 million people. The terrain is varied, with mountains, hills, and plains. The highest point is Doi Inthanon, which is 2,565 meters above sea level.\n\nClimate\n--------\n\nThailand has a tropical climate, with three main seasons: hot, rainy, and cool. The hot season runs from March to May, the rainy season from June to October, and the cool season from November to February.\n\nBiodiversity and conservation\n-------------------------------\n\nThailand is home to a wide range of flora and fauna, including many endangered species. The country has a number of national parks and protected areas, which cover over 15% of its land area. The parks are administered by the National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation Department (DNP) of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MNRE).\n\nPolitics and government\n------------------------\n\nPrior to 1932, Thai kings were feudal or absolute monarchs. The system of government was a network of tributaries ruled by local lords. Modern absolute monarchy and statehood was established by Chulalongkorn when he transformed the decentralized protectorate system into a unitary state. On 24 June 1932, Khana Ratsadon (People's Party) carried out a bloodless revolution which marked the beginning of constitutional monarchy.\n\nAdministrative divisions\n------------------------\n\nThailand is a unitary state, with three levels of administration: central, provincial, and local.

outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThailand [i] was known by outsiders prior to 1939 as Siam [ii] According to George Cœdès, the word Thai (ไทย) means 'free man' in the Thai language, \"differentiating the Thai from the natives encompassed in Thai society as serfs\" [15]: 197  According to Chit Phumisak, Thai (ไท) simply means 'people' or 'human being'; his investigation shows that some rural areas used the word \"Thai\" instead of the usual Thai word khon (คน) for people [16] According to Michel Ferlus, the ethnonyms Thai-Tai (or Thay-Tay) would have evolved from the etymon *k(ə)ri: 'human being' [iii] [18]\n\n\nHistory\nThere is evidence of continuous human habitation in present-day Thailand from 20,000 years ago to the present day [26]: 4  The earliest evidence of rice growing is dated at 2,000 BCE [27]: 4  Areas comprising what is now Thailand participated in the Maritime Jade Road, as ascertained by archeological research The trading network existed for 3,000 years, between 2000 BCE to 1000 CE [28] [29] [30] [31] Bronze appeared c. 1,250–1,000 BCE [27]: 4  The site of Ban Chiang in northeast Thailand currently ranks as the earliest known centre of copper and bronze production in Southeast Asia [32] Iron appeared around 500 BCE [27]: 5  The Kingdom of Funan was the first and most powerful Southeast Asian kingdom at the time (2nd century BCE) [26]: 5  The Mon people established the principalities of Dvaravati and Kingdom of Hariphunchai in the 6th century The Khmer people established the Khmer empire, centred in Angkor, in the 9th century [26]: 7  Tambralinga, a Malay state controlling trade through the Malacca Strait, rose in the 10th century [26]: 5  The Indochina peninsula was heavily influenced by the culture and religions of India from the time of the Kingdom of Funan to that of the Khmer Empire [33]\n\n\nPrehistory and origins\nThere is evidence of continuous human habitation in present-day Thailand from 20,000 years ago to the present day [26]: 4  The earliest evidence of rice growing is dated at 2,000 BCE [27]: 4  Areas comprising what is now Thailand participated in the Maritime Jade Road, as ascertained by archeological research The trading

culture and religions of India from the time of the Kingdom of Funan to that of the Khmer Empire [33]\n\n\nEarly Tai confederate cities: (691 BCE – 13th century CE)\nTheoretically, Tai-Kadai-speaking people formed as early as the 12th century BCE in the middle of the Yangtze basin Some groups later migrated south to Guangxi [43] However, after several bloody centuries against Chinese influence in Guangxi from the 333 BCE-11th centuries, hundreds of thousands of Tais were killed, [44]: 5  [45]: 193, 239–249  thus, Tai people began to move southwestward along the rivers and over the lower passes into the mountain north of Southeast Asia and river valleys in present-day Assam of India [46] [47] Some evidence indicates that the ancestors of Tai people migrated en masse southwestwards out of Yunnan only after the 1253 Mongol invasion of Dali, but not generally accepted [48]: 38 \n\n\nMon and Lavo Kingdoms: (5th century CE – 13th century CE)\nAs is generally known, the present-day Thai people were previously called Siamese before the country was renamed Thailand in the mid-20th century [16] Several genetic studies published in the 21st century suggest that the so-called Siamese people (central Thai) might have had Mon origins since their genetic profiles are more closely related to the Mon people in Myanmar than the Tais in southern China, [37] and they probably later became Tais via cultural diffusion after the arriving of Tai people from the north around the 8th–10th centuries [51] [69] [70] This is also reflected in the language since over half of the vocabulary in the central Thai language is derived from or borrowed from the Mon language as well as Pali and Sanskrit [69] [71] Moreover, the Jinakalamali chronicle of Tai's Lan Na also called the southern region occupied by the Mon Haripuñjaya of Dvaravati as Shyam Pradesh (lit. 'the land of Siam people'), which indicates that the ancient Siamese and the Mon people in central Thailand were probably the same ethnolinguistic group [72]\n\n\nSukhothai Kingdom (1238 CE – 14th century CE)\nAfter the decline of the Khmer Empire and Kingdom of Pagan in the early 13th century, various states thrived in their place The domains of Tai people existed from the northeast of present-day India to the north of present-day Laos and to the Malay Peninsula [34]: 38–9  During the 13th century, Tai people had already settled in the core land of Dvaravati and Lavo Kingdom to Nakhon Si Thammarat in the south There are, however, no records detailing the arrival of the Tais [34]: 50–1 \n\n\nAyutthaya Kingdom (1351–1767)\nAccording to the most widely accepted version of its origin, the Ayutthaya Kingdom rose from the earlier, nearby Lavo Kingdom and Suvarnabhumi with Uthong as its first king Ayutthaya was a patchwork of self-governing principalities and tributary provinces owing allegiance to the King of Ayutthaya under the mandala system [80]: 355  Its initial expansion was through conquest and political marriage Before the end of the 15th century, Ayutthaya invaded the Khmer Empire three times and sacked its capital Angkor [81]: 26  Ayutthaya then became a regional power in place of the Khmer Constant interference of Sukhothai effectively made it a vassal state of Ayutthaya and it was finally incorporated into the kingdom Borommatrailokkanat brought about bureaucratic reforms which lasted into the 20th century and created a system of social hierarchy called sakdina, where male commoners were conscripted as corvée labourers for six months a year [82]: 107  Ayutthaya was interested in the Malay Peninsula, but failed to conquer the Malacca Sultanate which was supported by the Chinese Ming dynasty [26]: 11, 13 \n\n\nThonburi Kingdom (1767–1782)\nThe capital and many of its territories lay in chaos after the war The former capital was occupied by the Burmese garrison army and five local leaders declared themselves overlords, including the lords of Sakwangburi, Phitsanulok, Pimai, Chanthaburi, and Nakhon Si Thammarat Chao Tak, a capable military leader, proceeded to make himself a lord by right of conquest, beginning with the legendary sack of Chanthaburi Based at Chanthaburi, Chao Tak raised troops and resources, and sent a fleet up the Chao Phraya to take the fort of Thonburi In the same year, Chao Tak was able to retake Ayutthaya from the Burmese only seven months after the fall of the city [86]\n\n\nRattanakosin Kingdom and modernization (1782 –1932)\nUnder Rama I (1782–1809), Rattanakosin successfully defended against Burmese attacks and put an end to Burmese incursions He also created suzerainty over large portions of Laos and Cambodia [87] In 1821, Briton John Crawfurd was sent to negotiate a new trade agreement with Siam – the first sign of an issue which was to dominate 19th century Siamese politics [88] Bangkok signed the Burney Treaty in 1826, after the British victory in the First Anglo-Burmese War [82]: 281  Anouvong of Vientiane, who mistakenly held the belief that Britain was about to launch an invasion of Bangkok, started the Lao rebellion in 1826 which was suppressed [82]: 283–5  Vientiane was destroyed and a large number of Lao people were relocated to Khorat Plateau as a result [82]: 285–6  Bangkok also waged several wars with Vietnam, where Siam successfully regained hegemony over Cambodia [82]: 290–2 \n\n\nConstitutional monarchy, World War II and Cold War (1932–1975)\nA bloodless revolution took place in 1932, in which Prajadhipok was forced to grant the country's first constitution, thereby ending centuries of feudal and absolute monarchy The combined results of economic hardships brought on by the Great Depression, sharply falling rice prices, and a significant reduction in public spending caused discontent among aristocrats [26]: 25  In 1933, a counter-revolutionary rebellion occurred which aimed to reinstate absolute monarchy, but failed [82]: 446–8  Prajadhipok's conflict with the government eventually led to abdication The government selected Ananda Mahidol, who was studying in Switzerland, to be the new king [82]: 448–9 \n\n\nContemporary history\nConstant unrest and instability, as well as fear of a communist takeover after the fall of Saigon, made some ultra-right groups brand leftist students as communists [82]: 548  This culminated in the Thammasat University massacre in October 1976 [82]: 548–9  A coup d'état on that day brought Thailand a new ultra-right government, which cracked down on media outlets, officials, and intellectuals, and fuelled the communist insurgency Another coup the following year installed a more moderate government, which offered amnesty to communist fighters in 1978 [95]\n\n\nGeography\nTotalling 513,120 square kilometres (198,120 sq mi), Thailand is the 50th-largest country by total area [1] Thailand comprises several distinct geographic regions, partly corresponding to the provincial groups The north of the country is the mountainous area of the Thai highlands, with the highest point being Doi Inthanon in the Thanon Thong Chai Range at 2,565 metres (8,415 ft) above sea level The northeast, Isan, consists of the Khorat Plateau, bordered to the east by the Mekong River The centre of the country is dominated by the predominantly flat Chao Phraya river valley, which runs into the Gulf of Thailand Southern Thailand consists of the narrow Kra Isthmus that widens into the Malay Peninsula.\n\n\nClimate\nThailand's climate is influenced by monsoon winds that have a seasonal character (the southwest and northeast monsoon) [122]: 2  Most of the country is classified as Köppen's tropical savanna climate [123] The majority of the south as well as the eastern tip of the east have a tropical monsoon climate Parts of the south also have a tropical rainforest climate.\n\n\nBiodiversity and conservation\nNational parks in Thailand are defined as an area that contains natural resources of ecological importance or unique beauty, or flora and fauna of special importance Thailand's protected areas include 156 national parks, 58 wildlife sanctuaries, 67 non-hunting areas, and 120 forest parks They cover almost 31 per cent of the kingdom's territory [127] The parks are administered by the National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation Department (DNP) of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MNRE).\n\n\nPolitics and government\nPrior to 1932, Thai kings were feudal or absolute monarchs During Sukhothai Kingdom, the king was seen as a Dharmaraja or 'king who rules in accordance with Dharma' The system of government was a network of tributaries ruled by local lords Modern absolute monarchy and statehood was established by Chulalongkorn when he transformed the decentralized protectorate system into a unitary state On 24 June 1932, Khana Ratsadon (People's Party) carried out a bloodless revolution which marked the beginning of constitutional monarchy.\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nThailand is a unitary state; the administrative services of the executive branch are divided into three levels by National Government Organisation Act, BE 2534 (1991): central, provincial and local Thailand is composed of 76 provinces (จังหวัด, changwat), [160] which are first-level administrative divisions There are also two specially governed districts: the capital Bangkok and Pattaya Bangkok is at provincial level and thus often counted as a province Each province is divided into districts (อำเภอ, amphoe) and the districts are further divided into sub-districts (ตำบล, tambons) The name of each province's capital city (เมือง, mueang) is the same as that of the province For example, the capital of Chiang Mai Province (Changwat Chiang Mai) is Mueang Chiang Mai or Chiang Mai All provincial governors and district chiefs, which are administrators of provinces and districts respectively, are appointed by the central government [161] Thailand's provinces are sometimes grouped into four to six regions, depending on the source.\n\n\nForeign relations\nSiam's and Thailand's way of conducting foreign relations has long been described as \"bamboo bending with the wind\", of policies that are \"always solidly rooted, but flexible enough to bend whichever way the wind blows in order to survive,\" [162] or adaptable and pragmatic In order to secure independence, it sought to pit one great power against the others so that it would be dominated by none [163]\n\n\nArmed forces\nThe Royal Thai Armed Forces (กองทัพไทย; RTGS: Kong Thap Thai) constitute the military of the Kingdom of Thailand It consists of the Royal Thai Army (กองทัพบกไทย), the Royal Thai Navy (กองทัพเรือไทย), and the Royal Thai Air Force (กองทัพอากาศไทย) It also incorporates various paramilitary forces [citation needed]\n\n\nEconomy\nThe economy of Thailand is heavily export-dependent, with exports accounting for more than two-thirds of gross domestic product (GDP) Thailand exports over US$105 billion worth of goods and services annually [1] Major exports include cars, computers, electrical appliances, rice, textiles and footwear, fishery products, rubber, and jewellery [1]\n\n\nIncome and wealth disparities\nThais have median wealth per one adult person of $1,469 in 2016, [209]: 98  increasing from $605 in 2010 [209]: 34  In 2016, Thailand was ranked 87th in Human Development Index, and 70th in the inequality-adjusted HDI [210]\n\n\nExports and manufacturing\nThe economy of Thailand is heavily export-dependent, with exports accounting for more than two-thirds of gross domestic products (GDPs) Major exports include cars, computers, electrical appliances, rice, textiles and footwear, fishery products, rubber, and jewellery [1] In 2022, Thailand's export of goods is worth roughly US$290 billion while its import worth roughly US$305 billion [218]\n\n\nTourism\nTourism makes up about 6% of the country's economy Prior to the pandemic, Thailand was the world's eighth most visited country according to the World Tourism rankings compiled by the United Nations World Tourism Organization In 2019, Thailand received 39.8 million international tourists, ahead of United Kingdom and Germany [224] and was the fourth highest in international tourism earning 60.5 billion US dollars.\n\n\nAgriculture and natural resources\nForty-nine per cent of Thailand's labour force is employed in agriculture [234] This is down from 70% in 1980 [234] Rice is the most important crop in the country and Thailand had long been the world's leading exporter of rice, until recently falling behind both India and Vietnam [235] Thailand has the highest percentage of arable land, 27.25%, of any state in the Greater Mekong Subregion [236] About 55% of the arable land area is used for rice production [237]\n\n\nInformal economy\nIn 2012, it was estimated that informal workers comprised 62.6% of the Thai workforce The Ministry of Labour defines informal workers to be individuals who work in informal economies and do not have employee status under a given country's Labour Protection Act (LPA) The informal sector in Thailand has grown significantly over the past 60 years over the course of Thailand's gradual transition from an agriculture-based economy to becoming more industrialised and service-oriented [240] Between 1993 and 1995, ten per cent of the Thai labour force moved from the agricultural sector to urban and industrial jobs, especially in the manufacturing sector It is estimated that between 1988 and 1995, the number of factory workers in the country doubled from two to four million, as Thailand's GDP tripled [241]\n\n\nScience and technology\nThailand ranked 41st in the Global Innovation Index in 2024 [246] The Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation and its agencies oversees the development of science, technology, and research in Thailand According to the National Research Council of Thailand, the country devoted 1.1% of its GDP to the research and development of science in 2019, with over 166,788 research and development personnel in full-time equivalent that year [247] [248]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nThe State Railway of Thailand (SRT) operates all of Thailand's national rail lines Krung Thep Aphiwat Central Terminal and Bangkok (Hua Lamphong) are the main termini of intercity routes Phahonyothin and ICD Lat Krabang are the main freight terminals As of 2024 [update] SRT had 4,507 km (2,801 mi) of track, all of it meter gauge Nearly all is single-track (2,847.1 km), although some important sections around Bangkok are double (1,089.9 km or 677.2 mi) or triple-tracked (107 km or 66 mi), and there are plans to extend this [249]

of Thailand's electrical generation is powered by natural gas in 2014 [258] Coal-fired power plants produce an additional 20% of electricity, with the remainder coming from biomass, hydro, and biogas [258] Compared to other ASEAN's countries, Thailand is the largest importer of gas in weight [259]: 17  In 2022, Thailand's oil and gas production dropped by 19% and 17%, respectively [260] [259]: 8 \n\n\nDemographics\nEthnic groups\nof Thailand(2015 estimate by The World Factbook) [1]\n\n\nEthnic groups\nAs of 2010, Thai people make up the majority of Thailand's population (95.9%) The remaining 4.1% of the population are Burmese (2.0%), others (1.3%), and unspecified (0.9%) [1]\n\n\nPopulation centres\nThe official language of Thailand is Thai, a Kra–Dai language closely related to Lao, Shan in Myanmar, and numerous smaller languages spoken in an arc from Hainan and Yunnan south to the Chinese border It is the principal language of education and government and spoken throughout the country [275] The standard is based on the dialect of the central Thai people, and it is written in the Thai alphabet, an abugida script that evolved from the Khmer alphabet [276] Sixty-two languages were recognised by the Royal Thai Government [277] For the purposes of the national census, four dialects of Thai exist; these partly coincide with regional designations, such as Southern Thai and Northern Thai [275]\n\n\nLanguage\nThe official language of Thailand is Thai, a Kra–Dai language closely related to Lao, Shan in Myanmar, and numerous smaller languages spoken in an arc from

[2]\n\n\nEducation\nIn 1995, as minister of education, Sukavich Rangsitpollaid let out his plans for educational reform in Thailand [284] The reform was considered a landmark movement after nearly 100 years of education under the previous system [285] Thailand's youth literacy rate was 98.1% in 2015 [286] Education is provided by a school system of kindergartens, primary, lower secondary and upper secondary schools, numerous vocational colleges, and universities Education is compulsory up to and including age 14, while the government is mandated to provide free education through to age 17 Issues concerning university entrance have been in constant upheaval for a number of years The country is also one of the few that still mandates uniform up to the university years, which is still a subject of ongoing debate [287]\n\n\nHealth\nThailand ranks world's sixth, and Asia's first in the 2019 Global Health Security Index of global health security capabilities in 195 countries, [301] making it the only developing country on the world's top ten Thailand had 62 hospitals accredited by Joint Commission International [302] In 2002, Bumrungrad became the first hospital in Asia to meet the standard [303]\n\n\nCulture\nThai culture and traditions incorporate influences from India, China, Cambodia, and the rest of Southeast Asia Thailand's national religion, Theravada Buddhism, is central to modern Thai identity Thai Buddhism has evolved over time to include many regional beliefs originating from Hinduism, animism, as well as ancestor worship The official calendar in Thailand is based on the Eastern version of the Buddhist Era (BE) Thai identity today is a social construct of the Phibun regime in the 1940s [308] [309] [310]\n\n\nArt\nThe origins of Thai art were influenced by Buddhist art and by scenes from the Indian epics Traditional Thai sculpture almost exclusively depicts images of the Buddha, being very similar with the other styles from Southeast Asia Traditional Thai paintings usually consist of book illustrations, and painted ornamentation of buildings such as palaces and temples Thai art was influenced by indigenous civilisations of the Mon and other civilisations By the Sukothai and Ayutthaya periods, Thai had developed into its own unique style and was later further influenced by the other Asian styles, mostly by Sri Lankan and Chinese Thai sculpture and painting, and the royal courts provided patronage, erecting temples and other religious shrines as acts of merit or to commemorate important events [314]\n\n\nArchitecture\nThe Ayutthaya Kingdom movement is designed to display might and riches The temples in Ayutthaya seldom built eaves stretching from the masterhead [316] Buddhist temples in Thailand are known as \"wats\", from the Pāḷi vāṭa, meaning an enclosure: a temple has an enclosing wall that divides it from the secular world Wat architecture demonstrates many differences in layout and style, but they all adhere to the same principles [317]\n\n\nLiterature\nThai literature has had a long history Even before the establishment of the Sukhothai Kingdom there existed oral and written works [citation needed]\n\n\nMusic and dance\nAside from folk and regional dances (southern Thailand's Menora and Ramwong, for example), the two major forms of Thai classical dance drama are Khon and Lakhon nai In the beginning, both were exclusively court entertainments, and it was not until much later that a popular style of dance theatre, likay, evolved as a diversion for common folk [323] Folk dance forms include dance theater forms like likay, numerous regional dances (ram), the ritual dance ram muay, and homage to the teacher, wai khru [324] Both ram muay and wai khru take place before all traditional muay Thai matches [citation needed]\n\n\nEntertainment\nThai films are exported and exhibited in Southeast Asia [326] Thai cinema has developed its own unique identity [327] The Thai heist thriller film Bad Genius (2017) was one of the most internationally successful Thai films; it broke Thai film earning records in several Asian countries, [328] Bad Genius won in 12 categories at the 27th Suphannahong National Film Awards, and also won the Jury Award at the 16th New York Asian Film Festival with a worldwide collection of more than $42 million [329] Shutter (2004) was one of the best-known Thai horror movies and was recognized worldwide [330] Films such as Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior (2003) and Tom-Yum-Goong (2005), starring Tony Jaa, feature distinctive aspects of Thai martial arts \"Muay Thai\" Thailand television dramas, known as Lakorn, have become popular in Thailand and regionally [331]\n\n\nCuisine\nThai cuisine is one of the most popular in the world [335] Common ingredients include garlic, lemongrass, kaffir lime, galangal, turmeric, coriander, and coconut milk [336] [337] [338] [339] [340] Each region of Thailand has its specialities: kaeng khiao wan (green curry) in the central region, som tam (green papaya salad) in the northeast, khao soi in the north, and massaman curry in the south [citation needed]\n\n\nUnits of measurement\nThailand generally uses the metric system, but traditional units of measurement for land area are used, and imperial units of measurement are occasionally used for building materials Years are numbered as B.E (Buddhist Era) in educational settings, civil service, government, contracts, and newspaper datelines However, in banking, and increasingly in industry and commerce, standard Western year (Christian or Common Era) counting is the standard practice [347]\n\n\nSports\nMuay Thai (lit. 'Thai boxing') is a combat sport that uses stand-up striking along with various clinching techniques Muay Thai became widespread internationally in the late-20th to 21st centuries Famous practitioners include Buakaw Banchamek, Samart Payakaroon, and Apidej Sit-Hirun [348] Association football has overtaken Muay Thai as the most widely followed sport in Thailand The Thailand national football team has played the AFC Asian Cup six times and reached the semifinals in 1972 The country has hosted the Asian Cup twice, in 1972 [349] and in 2007

{"title": "Unit_731", "content": "\nFormations\nJapan initiated its biological weapons program during the 1930s due to the prohibition of biological weapons in interstate conflicts by the Geneva Protocol of 1925 They reasoned that the ban verified its effectiveness as a weapon [1] Japan's occupation of Manchuria began in 1931 after the Japanese invasion of Manchuria [14] Japan decided to build Unit 731 in Manchuria because the occupation not only gave the Japanese an advantage of separating the research station from their island, but also gave them access to as many Chinese individuals as they wanted for use as test subjects [14] They viewed the Chinese as no-cost assets, and hoped this would give them a competitive advantage in biological warfare [14] Most of the victims were Chinese, but many victims were also from different nationalities [1] These facilities contained more than just medical research and experimentation areas; they also included spaces for detaining victims, essentially functioning as a prison [15] The research and experimentation rooms were constructed around the detention area, allowing researchers to conduct their daily work while monitoring the prisoners [15] \nFounded in 1936, Unit 731 expanded to include 3000 staff members, 150 structures, and the capacity to detain up to 600 prisoners concurrently for experimental purposes [16]\n\n\nZhongma Fortress\nUnit Tōgō was set into motion in the Zhongma Fortress, a prison and experimentation camp in Beiyinhe, a village 100 kilometers (62 mi) south of Harbin on the South Manchuria Railway The prisoners brought to Zhongma included common criminals, captured bandits, anti-Japanese partisans, as well as political prisoners and people rounded up on trumped up charges by the Kempeitai Prisoners were generally well fed on a diet of rice or wheat, meat, fish, and occasionally even alcohol in order to be in normal health at the beginning of experiments Then, over several days, prisoners were eventually drained of blood and deprived of nutrients and water Their deteriorating health was recorded Some were also vivisected Others were deliberately infected with plague bacteria and other microbes [22] A prison break in the autumn of 1934, which jeopardized the facility's secrecy, and an explosion in 1935 (believed to be sabotage) led Ishii to shut down Zhongma Fortress He then received authorization to move to Pingfang, approximately 24 kilometers (15 mi) south of Harbin, to set up a new, much larger facility [23]\n\n\nOther units\nIn addition to the establishment of Unit 731, the decree also called for the creation of an additional biological warfare development unit, called the Kwantung Army Military Horse Epidemic Prevention Workshop (later referred to as Manchuria Unit 100), and a chemical warfare development unit called the Kwantung Army Technical Testing Department (later referred to as Manchuria Unit 516) After the Japanese invasion of China in 1937, sister chemical and biological warfare units were founded in major Chinese cities and were referred to as Epidemic Prevention and Water Supply Units Detachments included Unit 1855 in Beijing, Unit Ei 1644 in Nanjing, Unit 8604 in Guangzhou, and later Unit 9420 in Singapore All of these units comprised Ishii's network, which, at its height in 1939, oversaw over 10,000 personnel [24] Medical doctors and professors from Japan were attracted to join Unit 731 both by the rare opportunity to conduct human experimentation and the Army's strong financial backing [25]\n\n\nExperiments\nThe military police and the Special Services Agency were responsible for finding victims to be test subjects for the unit, while a group of physicians was responsible for maintaining healthy victims and dispatching them for experimentations [15] Not all individuals sent to Unit 731 underwent experiments; these experiments were reserved for healthy individuals, and once accepted into the program, the preservation of their health became a top priority [15]\n\n\nVivisection\nThousands of men, women, children, and infants interned at prisoner of war camps were subjected to vivisection, often performed without anesthesia and usually lethal [35] [36] In a video interview, former Unit 731 member Okawa Fukumatsu admitted to having vivisected a pregnant woman [37] Vivisections were performed on prisoners after infecting them with various diseases Researchers performed invasive surgery on prisoners, removing organs to study the effects of disease on the human body [38]\n\n\nBiological warfare\nUnit 731 and its affiliated units (Unit 1644 and Unit 100, among others) were involved in research, development and experimental deployment of epidemic-creating biological weapons in assaults against the Chinese populace (both military and civilian) throughout World War II [6]\n\n\nWeapons testing\nHuman targets were used to test grenades positioned at various distances and in various positions Flamethrowers were tested on people [57] Victims were also tied to stakes and used as targets to test pathogen-releasing bombs, chemical weapons, shrapnel bombs with varying amounts of fragments, and explosive bombs as well as bayonets and knives.\n\n\nFrostbite testing\nArmy Engineer Hisato Yoshimura conducted experiments by taking captives outside, dipping various appendages into water of varying temperatures, and allowing the limb to freeze [60] Once frozen, Yoshimura would strike their affected limbs with a short stick, \"emitting a sound resembling that which a board gives when it is struck.\" [61] Ice was then chipped away, with the affected area being subjected to various treatments Military personnel of the Unit referred to Yoshimura as a \"scientific devil\" and a \"cold-blooded animal\" due to his strictness and involvement in mass killings and inhumane scientific test, which included soaking the fingers of a three-day-old child in water containing ice and salt [62]\n\n\nSyphilis\nUnit members orchestrated forced sex acts between infected and non-infected prisoners to transmit the disease, as the testimony of a prison guard on the subject of devising a method for transmission of syphilis between patients shows:\n\n\nRape and forced pregnancy\nFemale prisoners were forced to become pregnant for use in experiments The hypothetical possibility of vertical transmission (from mother to child) of diseases, particularly syphilis, was the stated reason for the torture Fetal survival and damage to mother's reproductive organs were objects of interest Though \"a large number of babies were born in captivity,\" there have been no accounts of any survivors of Unit 731, children included It is suspected that the children of female prisoners were killed after birth or aborted [67]\n\n\nOther experiments\nIn other tests, subjects were deprived of food and water to determine the amount of time until death; placed into low-pressure chambers until their eyes popped from the sockets; experimented upon to determine the relationship between temperature, burns, and human survival; hung upside down until death; crushed with heavy objects; electrocuted; dehydrated with hot fans; [68] placed into centrifuges and spun until death; injected with animal blood, notably with horse blood; exposed to lethal doses of X-rays; subjected to various chemical weapons inside gas chambers; injected with seawater; and burned or buried alive [69] [70] In addition to chemical agents, the properties of many different toxins were also investigated by the Unit To name a few, prisoners were exposed to tetrodotoxin (pufferfish or fugu poison), heroin, Korean bindweed, bactal, and castor-oil seeds (ricin) [71] [72] Massive amounts of blood were drained from some prisoners in order to study the effects of blood loss according to former Unit 731 vivisectionist Okawa Fukumatsu In one case, at least half a liter of blood was drawn at two-to-three-day intervals [73]\n\n\nPrisoners and victims\nAfter Japan's defeat in World War II, the Japanese murdered every single prisoner in the unit The remains were then buried in the Unit 731 grounds after being cremated [78] The following testimony explains how the captives were murdered:\n\n\nEscape attempt\nDespite the prison's status as a highly secure building, at least one unsuccessful escape attempt did occur Corporal Kikuchi Norimitsu testified that he was told by another unit member that a prisoner \"had shown violence and had struck the experimenter with a door handle\" and then \"jumped out of the cell and ran down the corridor, seized the keys and opened the iron doors and some of the cells Some of the prisoners managed to jump out but these were only the bold ones These bold ones were shot.\" [101]\n\n\nExperiments on staff members\nMembers of Unit 731 were not immune from being subjects of experiments Yoshio Tamura, an assistant in the Special Team, recalled that Yoshio Sudō, an employee of the first division at Unit 731, became infected with bubonic plague as a result of the production of it The Special Team was then ordered to vivisect Sudō Tamura recalled:\n\n\nKnown unit members\nThere are unit members who were known to be interned at the Fushun War Criminals Management Centre and Taiyuan War Criminals Management Centre after the war, who then went on to be repatriated to Japan and founded the Association of Returnees from China and testified about Unit 731 and the crimes perpetrated there.\n\n\nDivisions\nUnit 731 was divided into eight divisions:\n\n\nFacilities\nUnit 731 had other units underneath it in the chain of command; there were several other units under the auspice of Japan's biological weapons programs Most or all Units had branch offices, which were also often referred to as \"Units.\" The term Unit 731 can refer to the Harbin complex, or it can refer to the organization and its branches, sub-Units and their branches.\n\n\nBranches\nUnit 731 had branches in Linkou (Branch 162), Mudanjiang, Hailin (Branch 643), Sunwu (Branch 673) and Hailar (Branch 543) [3]: 60, 84, 124, 310 \n\n\nTokyo\nA medical school and research facility belonging to Unit 731 operated in the Shinjuku District of Tokyo during World War II In 2006, Toyo Ishii—a nurse who worked at the school during the war—revealed that she had helped bury bodies and pieces of bodies on the school's grounds shortly after Japan's surrender in 1945 In response, in February 2011 the Ministry of Health began to excavate the site [108]\n\n\nSurrender and immunity\nAs the Second World War started to come to an end, all prisoners within the compound were killed to conceal evidence, and there were no documented survivors [110] With the coming of the Red Army in August 1945, the unit had to abandon their work in haste Ministries in Tokyo ordered the destruction of all incriminating materials, including those in Pingfang Potential witnesses, such as the 300 remaining prisoners, were either gassed or fed poison while the 600 Chinese and Manchurian laborers were shot Ishii ordered every member of the group to disappear and \"take the secret to the grave.\" [111] Potassium cyanide vials were issued for use in case the remaining personnel were captured Skeleton crews of Ishii's Japanese troops blew up the compound in the final days of the war to destroy evidence of their activities, but many were sturdy enough to remain somewhat intact.\n\n\nDestruction of evidence\nAs the Second World War started to come to an end, all prisoners within the compound were killed to conceal evidence, and there were no documented survivors [110] With the coming of the Red Army in

[111] Potassium cyanide vials were issued for use in case the remaining personnel were captured Skeleton crews of Ishii's Japanese troops blew up the compound in the final days of the war to destroy evidence of their activities, but many were sturdy enough to remain somewhat intact.\n\n\nAmerican grant of immunity\nAmong the individuals in Japan after its 1945 surrender was Lieutenant Colonel Murray Sanders, who arrived in Yokohama via the American ship Sturgess in September 1945 Sanders was a highly regarded microbiologist and a member of America's military center for biological weapons Sanders' duty was to investigate Japanese biological warfare activity At the time of his arrival in Japan, he had no knowledge of what Unit 731 was [67] Until Sanders finally threatened the Japanese with bringing the Soviets into the picture, little information about biological warfare was being shared with the Americans The Japanese wanted to avoid prosecution under the Soviet legal system, so, the morning after he made his threat, Sanders received a manuscript describing Japan's involvement in biological warfare  Sanders took this information to General Douglas MacArthur, who was the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers and responsible for rebuilding Japan during the Allied occupations MacArthur struck a deal with Japanese informants: [112] he secretly granted immunity to the physicians of Unit 731, including their leader, in exchange for providing exclusive American access to their research on biological warfare and data from human experimentation [11] American occupation authorities monitored the activities of former unit members, including reading and censoring their mail [113] The Americans believed that the research data was valuable and did not want other nations, particularly the Soviet Union, to acquire data on biological weapons [114]\n\n\nSeparate Soviet trials\nAlthough publicly silent on the issue at the Tokyo Trials, the Soviet Union pursued the case and prosecuted 12 top military leaders and scientists from Unit 731 and its affiliated biological-war prisons Unit 1644 in Nanjing and Unit 100 in Changchun in the Khabarovsk war crimes trials Among those accused of war crimes, including germ warfare, was General Otozō Yamada, commander-in-chief of the million-man Kwantung Army occupying Manchuria.\n\n\nOfficial silence during the American occupation of Japan\nAs above, during the United States occupation of Japan, the members of Unit 731 and the members of other experimental units were allowed to go free On 6 May 1947, Douglas MacArthur, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, wrote to Washington in order to inform it that \"additional data, possibly some statements from Ishii, can probably be obtained by informing Japanese involved that information will be retained in intelligence channels and will not be employed as war crimes evidence\" [11]\n\n\nPost-occupation Japanese media coverage and debate\nJapanese discussions of Unit 731's activity began in the 1950s, after the end of the American occupation of Japan In 1952, an infant girl at Nagoya City Pediatric Hospital died after being infected with E coli bacteria; the incident was publicly tied to former Unit 731 scientists [123] Later in that decade, journalists suspected that the murders attributed by the government to Sadamichi Hirasawa were actually carried out by members of Unit 731 In 1958, Japanese author Shūsaku Endō published the book The Sea and Poison about human experimentation in Fukuoka, which is thought to have been based on a real incident.\n\n\nSignificance in postwar research on bio-warfare and medicine\nDespite conducting scientific experiments, Unit 731 faced scrutiny regarding the usefulness of the data produced from these experiments [45] Japanese biological warfare operations were by far the largest during WWII, and \"possibly with more people and resources than the BW producing nations of France, Hungary, Italy, Poland, and the Soviet Union combined, between the world wars [130] Despite the apparent success, Unit 731 lacked adequate scientific and engineering foundations to further maximize its effectiveness [131] [132] Harris concluded that US scientists generally wanted to acquire it due to the concept of forbidden fruit, believing that lawful and ethical prohibitions could affect the outcomes of their research [133]\n\n\nOfficial government response in Japan\nIn 1983, the Japanese Ministry of Education asked Japanese historian Saburō Ienaga to remove a reference from one of his textbooks that stated Unit 731 conducted experiments on thousands of Chinese The ministry alleged that no academic research supported the claim In 1984, Japanese historian Tsuneishi Keiichi translated and published over 4,000 pages of U.S documents on Japanese biological warfare The ministry backed down after new studies were published in Japan and important evidence surfaced in the United States [136]\n\n\nAbroad\nAfter World War II, the Office of Special Investigations created a watchlist of suspected Axis collaborators and persecutors who are banned from entering the United States While they have added over 60,000 names to the watchlist, they have only been able to identify under 100 Japanese participants In a 1998 correspondence letter between the DOJ and Rabbi Abraham Cooper, Eli Rosenbaum, director of OSI, stated that this was due to two factors:\n\n\nIn popular culture\n\n\nPrint media\n\n\nFilms\n\n\nMusic\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nVideo games\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nExplanatory

bacteria and other microbes [22] A prison break in the autumn of 1934, which jeopardized the facility's secrecy, and an explosion in 1935 (believed to be sabotage) led Ishii to shut down Zhongma Fortress He then received authorization to move to Pingfang, approximately 24 kilometers (15 mi) south of Harbin, to set up a new, much larger facility [23]\n\n\nOther units\nIn addition to the establishment of Unit 731, the decree also called for the creation of an additional biological warfare development unit, called the Kwantung Army Military Horse Epidemic Prevention Workshop (later referred to as Manchuria Unit 100), and a chemical warfare development unit called the Kwantung Army Technical Testing Department (later referred to as Manchuria Unit 516) After the Japanese invasion

maintaining healthy victims and dispatching them for experimentations [15] Not all individuals sent to Unit 731 underwent experiments; these experiments were reserved for healthy individuals, and once accepted into the program, the preservation of their health became a top priority [15]\n\n\nVivisection\nThousands of men, women, children, and infants interned at prisoner of war camps were subjected to vivisection, often performed without anesthesia and usually lethal [35] [36] In a video interview, former Unit 731 member Okawa Fukumatsu admitted to having vivisected a pregnant woman [37] Vivisections were performed on prisoners after infecting them with various diseases Researchers performed invasive surgery on prisoners, removing organs to study the effects of disease on the human body [38]\n\n\nBiological warfare\nUnit 731 and its affiliated units (Unit 1644 and Unit 100, among others) were involved in research, development and experimental deployment of epidemic-creating biological weapons in assaults against the Chinese populace (both military and civilian) throughout World War II [6]\n\n\nWeapons testing\nHuman targets were used to test grenades positioned at various distances and in various positions Flamethrowers were tested on people [57] Victims were also tied to stakes and used as targets to test pathogen-releasing bombs, chemical weapons, shrapnel bombs with varying amounts of fragments, and explosive bombs as well as bayonets and knives.\n\n\nFrostbite testing\nArmy Engineer Hisato Yoshimura conducted experiments by taking captives outside, dipping various appendages into water of varying temperatures, and allowing the limb to freeze [60] Once frozen, Yoshimura would strike their affected limbs with a short stick, \"emitting a sound resembling that which a board gives when it is struck.\" [61] Ice was then chipped away, with the affected area being subjected to various treatments Military personnel of the Unit referred to Yoshimura as a \"scientific devil\" and a \"cold-blooded animal\" due to his strictness and involvement in mass killings and inhumane scientific test, which included soaking the fingers of a three-day-old child in water containing ice and salt [62]\n\n\nSyphilis\nUnit members orchestrated forced sex acts between infected and non-infected prisoners to transmit the disease, as the testimony of a prison guard on the subject of devising a method for transmission of syphilis between patients shows:\n\n\nRape and forced pregnancy\nFemale prisoners were forced to become pregnant for use in experiments The hypothetical possibility of vertical transmission (from mother to child) of diseases, particularly syphilis, was the stated reason for the torture Fetal survival and damage to mother's

that the children of female prisoners were killed after birth or aborted [67]\n\n\nOther experiments\nIn other tests, subjects were deprived of food and water to determine the amount of time until death; placed into low-pressure chambers until their eyes popped from the sockets; experimented upon to determine the relationship between temperature, burns, and human survival; hung upside down until death; crushed with heavy objects; electrocuted; dehydrated with hot fans; [68] placed into centrifuges and spun until death; injected with animal blood, notably with horse blood; exposed to lethal doses of X-rays; subjected to various chemical weapons inside gas chambers; injected with seawater; and burned or buried alive [69] [70] In addition to chemical agents, the properties of many different toxins were also investigated by the Unit To name a few, prisoners were exposed to tetrodotoxin (pufferfish or fugu poison), heroin, Korean bindweed, bactal, and castor-oil seeds (ricin) [71] [72] Massive amounts of blood were drained from some prisoners in order to study the effects of blood loss according to former Unit 731 vivisectionist Okawa Fukumatsu In one case, at least half a liter of blood was drawn at two-to-three-day intervals [73]\n\n\nPrisoners and victims\nAfter Japan's defeat in World War II, the Japanese murdered every single prisoner in the unit The remains were then buried in the Unit 731 grounds after being cremated [78] The following testimony explains how the captives were murdered:\n\n\nEscape attempt\nDespite the prison's status as a highly secure building, at least one unsuccessful escape attempt did occur Corporal Kikuchi Norimitsu testified that he was told by another unit member that a prisoner \"had shown violence and had struck the experimenter with a door handle\" and then \"jumped out of the cell and ran down the corridor, seized the keys and opened the iron doors and some of the cells Some of the prisoners managed to jump out but these were only the bold ones These bold ones were shot.\" [101]\n\n\nExperiments on staff members\nMembers of Unit 731 were not immune from being subjects of experiments Yoshio Tamura, an assistant in the Special Team, recalled that Yoshio Sudō, an employee of the first division at Unit 731, became infected with bubonic plague as a result of the production of it The Special Team was then ordered to vivisect Sudō Tamura recalled:\n\n\nKnown unit members\nThere are unit members who were known to be interned at the Fushun War Criminals Management Centre and Taiyuan War Criminals Management Centre after the war, who then went on to be repatriated to Japan and founded the Association of Returnees from China and testified about Unit 731 and the crimes perpetrated there.\n\n\nDivisions\nUnit 731 was divided into eight divisions:\n\n\nFacilities\nUnit 731 had other units underneath it in the chain of command; there were several other units under the auspice of Japan's biological weapons programs Most or all Units had branch offices, which were also often referred to as \"Units.\" The term Unit 731 can refer to the Harbin complex, or it can refer to the organization and its branches, sub-Units and their branches.\n\n\nBranches\nUnit 731 had branches in Linkou (Branch 162), Mudanjiang, Hailin (Branch 643), Sunwu (Branch 673) and Hailar (Branch 543) [3]: 60, 84, 124, 310 \n\n\nTokyo\nA medical school and research facility belonging to Unit 731 operated in the Shinjuku District of Tokyo during World War II In 2006, Toyo Ishii—a nurse who worked at the school during the war—revealed that she had helped bury bodies and pieces of bodies on the school's grounds shortly after Japan's surrender in 1945 In response, in February 2011 the Ministry of Health began to excavate the site [108]\n\n\nSurrender and immunity\nAs the Second World War started to come to an end, all prisoners within the compound were killed to conceal evidence, and there were no documented survivors [110] With the coming of the Red Army in August 1945, the unit had to abandon their work in haste Ministries in Tokyo ordered the destruction of all incriminating materials, including those in Pingfang Potential witnesses, such as the 300 remaining prisoners, were either gassed or fed poison while the 600 Chinese and Manchurian laborers were shot Ishii ordered every member of the group to disappear and \"take the secret to the grave.\" [111] Potassium cyanide vials were issued for use in case the remaining personnel were captured Skeleton crews of Ishii's Japanese troops blew up the compound in the final days of the war to destroy evidence of their activities, but many were sturdy enough to remain somewhat intact.\n\n\nDestruction of evidence\nAs the

evidence of their activities, but many were sturdy enough to remain somewhat intact.\n\n\nAmerican grant of immunity\nAmong the individuals in Japan after its 1945 surrender was Lieutenant Colonel Murray Sanders, who arrived in Yokohama via the American ship Sturgess in September 1945 Sanders was a highly regarded microbiologist and a member of America's military center for biological weapons Sanders' duty was to investigate Japanese biological warfare activity At the time of his arrival in Japan, he had no knowledge of what Unit 731 was [67] Until Sanders finally threatened the Japanese with bringing the Soviets into the picture, little information about biological warfare was being shared with the Americans The Japanese wanted to avoid prosecution under the Soviet legal system, so, the morning after he made his threat, Sanders received a manuscript describing Japan's involvement in biological warfare  Sanders took this information to General Douglas MacArthur, who was the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers and responsible for rebuilding Japan during the Allied occupations MacArthur struck a deal with Japanese informants: [112] he secretly granted immunity to the physicians of Unit 731, including their leader, in exchange for providing exclusive American access to their research on biological warfare and data from human experimentation [11] American occupation authorities monitored the activities of former unit members, including reading and censoring their mail [113] The Americans believed that the research data was valuable and did not want other nations, particularly the Soviet Union, to acquire data on biological weapons [114]\n\n\nSeparate Soviet trials\nAlthough publicly silent on the issue at the Tokyo Trials, the Soviet Union pursued the case and prosecuted 12 top military leaders and scientists from Unit 731 and its affiliated biological-war prisons Unit 1644 in Nanjing and Unit 100 in Changchun in the Khabarovsk war crimes trials Among those accused of war crimes, including germ warfare, was General Otozō Yamada, commander-in-chief of the million-man Kwantung Army occupying Manchuria.\n\n\nOfficial silence during the American occupation of Japan\nAs above, during the United States occupation of Japan, the members of Unit 731 and the members of other experimental units were allowed to go free On 6 May 1947, Douglas MacArthur, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, wrote to Washington in order to inform it that \"additional data, possibly some statements from Ishii, can probably be obtained by informing Japanese involved that information will be retained in intelligence channels and will not be employed as war crimes evidence\" [11]\n\n\nPost-occupation Japanese media coverage and debate\nJapanese discussions of Unit 731's activity began in the 1950s, after the end of the American occupation of Japan In 1952, an infant girl at Nagoya City Pediatric Hospital died after being infected with E coli bacteria; the incident was publicly tied to former Unit 731 scientists [123] Later in that decade, journalists suspected that the murders attributed by the government to Sadamichi Hirasawa were actually carried out by members of Unit 731 In 1958, Japanese author Shūsaku Endō published the book The Sea and Poison about human experimentation in Fukuoka, which is thought to have been based on a real incident.\n\n\nSignificance in postwar research on bio-warfare and medicine\nDespite conducting scientific experiments, Unit 731 faced scrutiny regarding the usefulness of the data produced from these experiments [45] Japanese biological warfare operations were by far the largest during WWII, and \"possibly with more people and resources than the BW producing nations of France, Hungary, Italy, Poland, and the Soviet Union combined, between the world wars [130] Despite the apparent success, Unit 731 lacked adequate scientific and engineering foundations to further maximize its effectiveness [131] [132] Harris concluded that US scientists generally wanted to acquire it due to the concept of forbidden fruit, believing that lawful and ethical prohibitions could affect the outcomes of their research [133]\n\n\nOfficial government response in Japan\nIn 1983, the Japanese Ministry of Education asked Japanese historian Saburō Ienaga to remove a reference from one of his textbooks that stated Unit 731 conducted experiments on thousands of Chinese The ministry alleged that no academic research supported the claim In 1984, Japanese historian Tsuneishi Keiichi translated and published over 4,000 pages of U.S documents on Japanese biological warfare The ministry backed down after new studies were published in Japan and important evidence surfaced in the United States [136]\n\n\nAbroad\nAfter World War II, the Office of Special Investigations created a watchlist of suspected Axis collaborators and persecutors who are banned from entering the United States While they have added over 60,000 names to the watchlist, they have only been able to identify under 100 Japanese participants In a 1998 correspondence letter between the DOJ and Rabbi Abraham Cooper, Eli Rosenbaum, director of OSI, stated that this was due to two factors:\n\n\nIn popular culture\n\n\nPrint media\n\n\nFilms\n\n\nMusic\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nVideo games\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nExplanatory

first to be cast in June 2017, as the title character Eve Polastri, [8] and IMG agreed distribution rights later that month [9] Oh reportedly was confused over which character she would be playing when she first received a breakdown, thinking that she would not have the option to audition for the young assassin and not even considering the lead Later her agents informed her that she would be reading for the role of Eve [6]\n\n\nFilming\nFilming for the first series began on 17 July 2017 in Tuscany, extending to further locations in Paris, Berlin, Bucharest, [15] Cheshunt, Turville, London [16] and West London Film Studios The Viennese Cafe opening scenes were shot at Bar Garibaldi in Colle di Val d'Elsa, a small hilltop town north west of Siena, Tuscany The building used as Eve's base is in Warwick House Street, just off Trafalgar Square [17] In the London pub scene, the external shot shows The Albert pub in Victoria Street; the interiors were of the dark-panelled Old Nick in Sandland Street In episode three, Villanelle lures David Haig's character Bill Pargrave into tailing her out of Berlin Friedrichstraße station and along a neighbouring Berlin tramway street before entering a busy nightclub, the location of which was Fabric, opposite London's Smithfield Market Bucharest's neoclassical Romanian Athenaeum concert hall was converted into a decadent café for the penultimate Moscow scene Filming also took place at Nell's Café, a popular roadside café off the A2 near Gravesend in Kent, as well as at the nearby M2 motorway [18] Filming also took place at the Radcliffe Camera in Oxford and production concluded on 15 December 2017.\n\n\nMusic\nThe band Unloved, featuring Jade Vincent, Keefus Ciancia, and David Holmes, were commissioned to score the series [25]\n\n\nRenewal\nShortly before its premiere, Killing Eve was renewed for a second series [26] [27] Luke Jennings's sequel, Killing Eve: No Tomorrow, was published in March 2019, shortly before the second-series premiere; [28] the book is said to diverge from the television series, but also to \"share common DNA\" because of Jennings's continued collaboration with the creators [28] In July 2018, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Waller-Bridge delegated some responsibility for the second series, hiring Emerald Fennell as head writer, and Lisa Brühlmann and Francesca Gregorini as directors [29]\n\n\nEpisodes and broadcast\nIn the United Kingdom, the first series was shown on BBC One in September 2018 and as stream-only on BBC Three [33] The first episode was broadcast on 15 September 2018, [34] and seen by 8.25 million viewers within the first twenty-eight days [35] [36] The second series was released in its entirety on BBC iPlayer on 8 June 2019, with its first episode being shown on BBC One the same day [37] [36]\nThe third series was released 6 am every Monday from 13 April 2020 on BBC iPlayer.\n\n\nThemes\nIn The New Yorker, Jia Tolentino characterised both Polastri and Villanelle as \"deeply strange\" and possessed of a \"wild, unlikely interior weirdness and flux\", writing that it seemed equally possible that they \"could team up, or try to kill each other, or fall into bed\" [45] Judy Berman wrote in The New York Times that Agent Polastri tracks assassin Villanelle not as hero and villain but as \"two broken women whose flaws bind them together in a twisted pas de deux\" [46] Villanelle is romantically interested in women and, as Willa Paskin wrote in Slate, is captivated by Polastri perhaps in part because of a \"shared brusqueness\" [47]\n\n\nIntertwined characterisations\nIn The New Yorker, Jia Tolentino characterised both Polastri and Villanelle as \"deeply strange\" and possessed of a \"wild, unlikely interior weirdness and flux\", writing that it seemed equally possible that they \"could team up, or try to kill each other, or fall into bed\" [45] Judy Berman wrote in The New York Times that Agent Polastri tracks assassin Villanelle not as hero and villain but as \"two broken women whose flaws bind them together in a twisted pas de deux\" [46] Villanelle is romantically interested in women and, as Willa Paskin wrote in Slate, is captivated by Polastri perhaps in part because of a \"shared brusqueness\" [47]\n\n\nContrast, conflict and attraction\nJia Tolentino wrote in The New Yorker that the \"amoral\" Villanelle's existence is \"saturated with pleasure\", in contrast to Eve's career as a \"bored security-state functionary\" [45] Series writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge explained that Polastri has a \"sense of self-consciousness and guilt\" that cripples her – a perfect counterpoint to Villanelle, who, as Ashley Boucher noted in TheWrap, only does things that might bring joy [57]\n\n\nSocial, thematic and creative context\nConspicuously, both protagonist and antagonist are women — a rarity in cat-and-mouse thrillers [47] [48]\n\n\nRelationships and sexuality\nShowrunner-writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge remarked that the characters \"give each other life in a way that's more complex than a romantic relationship It's sexual, it's intellectual, it's aspirational.\" [46] Along these lines, Melanie McFarland wrote in Salon that the show's \"careful awareness of the love languages of fashion, music and setting all play roles in strengthening (the audience's) affair\" with the characters [50] Hannah Giorgis wrote in The Atlantic that its \"greatest success\" is how alluring it makes Villanelle to an intelligence agent dedicated to tracking her down [63] Calling Killing Eve a \"sexually charged female-buddy-comedy espionage nailbiter\", Jenna Scherer wrote in Rolling Stone that the actresses \"share a crackling chemistry, one that situates them in a gray realm between bitter enemies and would-be lovers\" [64]\n\n\nPortrayals\nJia Tolentino wrote in The New Yorker that the \"women are deeply strange, forming a collective study in improbable contrasts, strung together by each actor's charisma\" [45] Matt Zoller Seitz wrote in Vulture that Oh's performance as Polastri actually makes Villanelle's character feel more plausible – as \"an incarnation of Eve's sublimated aggression and assertiveness\" [48] Though Jia Tolentino wrote in The New Yorker that Villanelle's character \"works\" because of Comer's \"mercurial, unassailable charisma\", [45] and Willa Paskin wrote in Slate that Comer's Villanelle (twisted and conscienceless but also irrepressible) is \"flat-out incredible\" [47] and Mike Hale agreed in The New York Times that Comer is good in that \"showier part\" Hale added that it is Ms Oh who ensures the series is \"more than a cute gloss on the glamorous international caper.\" [49]\n\n\nFashion\nA pink tulle dress worn in the first-series episode \"I'll Deal with Him Later\", designed by Molly Goddard, was heralded as a \"fashion moment\" [68] that inspired the dresses worn on red carpets in the subsequent awards season, including an overwhelming showing of pink at the 91st Academy Awards ceremony in 2019 [69] [70] [71] [72]\n\n\nVillanelle\nThe character Villanelle's relationship to fashion has been described by many people Gilly Ferguson of Grazia says that she has become a \"style icon\" [75] Luke Jennings, author of the book series on which the show is based, says that \"Clothes reflect her status and independence [...] She doesn't have to conform or please anyone's gaze\"; Charlotte Mitchell agrees that \"She plays by her own rules\" [73] Sonia Saraiya of Vanity Fair considers Villanelle's outfits \"their own subplot\"; she notes that the character choosing to live in Paris is also a nod to the emphasis on fashion in the show [76] Melania Hidalgo of The Cut writes that \"Villanelle reverses the style of a typical femme fatale, wearing everyday basics on her missions while saving the choicest items in her wardrobe for her days off\"; [77] in reference to a specific outfit, Steff Yotka of Vogue says that Villanelle has \"redefined the look of an international assassin story\" by subverting classic tactical gear and sleekness [78] Mitchell also said of Villanelle that she \"uses color to provoke reactions\", pointing to the pink Molly Goddard dress [73]\n\n\nEve Polastri\nConsidered Villanelle's fashion foil by Entertainment Weekly, Eve Polastri has been described as considering fashion \"trivial\" and not bothering to dress well Jennings suggested that even if she cared, \"she'd be hopeless at it\"; Mitchell and de Gaye crafted outfits that match Eve's practical attitude, with Mitchell saying that she \"wears elastic waists  [because] she doesn't have time to do up a button fly\" [73] Other choices include more clothes made of linen to more easily appear dishevelled [73] Eve is allowed some moments of being well-dressed, however, which are significant to the plot, including trying on dresses that Villanelle has chosen for her in her own stolen suitcase

a witness she is handling, she is fired However, her passion for female assassins later leads to her joining an undercover division within MI6 whose task is to pursue and locate Villanelle, a ruthless international assassin who works for a secret organization called The Twelve When Eve and Villanelle cross paths they begin a cycle of obsession which leads them away from their individual missions and closer to each other.\n\n\nCast and characters\nSally Woodward Gentle, of Sid Gentle Films, optioned Luke Jennings's Codename Villanelle in 2014, saying that \"the notion of a female assassin was not unique\", but that Jennings's take was \"fresh, intelligent and tonally much bolder than others\", adding that she was particularly interested because \"It wasn't exploitative We really enjoyed the character of Villanelle and the inventiveness of her kills, but we were particularly engaged with the mutual obsession between the women\" [6] Jennings's story began as a four-part novella

which character she would be playing when she first received a breakdown, thinking that she would not have the option to audition for the young assassin and not even considering the lead Later her agents informed her that she would be reading for the role of Eve [6]\n\n\nFilming\nFilming for the first series began on 17 July 2017 in Tuscany, extending to further locations in Paris, Berlin, Bucharest, [15] Cheshunt, Turville, London [16] and West London Film Studios The Viennese Cafe opening scenes were shot at Bar Garibaldi in Colle di Val d'Elsa, a small hilltop town north west of Siena, Tuscany The building used as Eve's base is in Warwick House Street, just off Trafalgar Square [17] In the London pub scene, the external shot shows The Albert pub in Victoria Street; the interiors were of the dark-panelled Old Nick in Sandland Street In episode three, Villanelle lures David Haig's character Bill Pargrave into tailing her out of Berlin Friedrichstraße station and along a neighbouring Berlin tramway street before entering a busy nightclub, the location of which was Fabric, opposite London's Smithfield Market Bucharest's neoclassical Romanian Athenaeum concert hall was converted into a decadent café for the penultimate Moscow scene Filming also took place at Nell's Café, a popular roadside café off the A2 near Gravesend in Kent, as well as at the nearby M2 motorway [18] Filming also took place at the Radcliffe Camera in Oxford and production concluded on 15 December 2017.\n\n\nMusic\nThe band Unloved, featuring Jade Vincent, Keefus Ciancia, and David Holmes, were commissioned to score the series [25]\n\n\nRenewal\nShortly before its premiere, Killing Eve was renewed for a second series [26] [27] Luke Jennings's sequel, Killing Eve: No Tomorrow, was published in March 2019, shortly before the second-series premiere; [28] the book is said to diverge from the television series, but also to \"share common DNA\" because of Jennings's continued collaboration with the creators [28] In July 2018, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Waller-Bridge delegated some responsibility for the second series, hiring Emerald Fennell as head writer, and Lisa Brühlmann and Francesca Gregorini as directors [29]\n\n\nEpisodes and broadcast\nIn the United Kingdom, the first series was shown on BBC One in September 2018 and as stream-only on BBC Three

Yorker, Jia Tolentino characterised both Polastri and Villanelle as \"deeply strange\" and possessed of a \"wild, unlikely interior weirdness and flux\", writing that it seemed equally possible that they \"could team up, or try to kill each other, or fall into bed\" [45] Judy Berman wrote in The New York Times that Agent Polastri tracks assassin Villanelle not as hero and villain but as \"two broken women whose flaws bind them together in a twisted pas de deux\" [46] Villanelle is romantically interested in women and, as Willa Paskin wrote in Slate, is captivated by Polastri perhaps in part because of a \"shared brusqueness\" [47]\n\n\nIntertwined characterisations\nIn The New Yorker, Jia Tolentino characterised both Polastri and Villanelle as \"deeply strange\" and possessed of a \"wild, unlikely interior weirdness and flux\", writing that it seemed equally possible that they \"could team up, or try to kill each other, or fall into bed\" [45] Judy Berman wrote in The New York Times that Agent Polastri tracks assassin Villanelle not as hero and villain but as \"two broken women whose flaws bind them together in a twisted pas de deux\" [46] Villanelle is romantically interested in women and, as Willa Paskin wrote in Slate, is captivated by Polastri perhaps in part because of a \"shared brusqueness\" [47]\n\n\nContrast, conflict and attraction\nJia Tolentino wrote in The New Yorker that the \"amoral\" Villanelle's existence is \"saturated with pleasure\", in contrast to Eve's career as a \"bored security-state functionary\" [45] Series writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge explained that Polastri has a \"sense of self-consciousness and guilt\" that cripples her – a perfect counterpoint to Villanelle, who, as Ashley Boucher noted in TheWrap, only does things that might bring joy [57]\n\n\nSocial, thematic and creative context\nConspicuously, both protagonist and antagonist are women — a rarity in cat-and-mouse thrillers [47] [48]\n\n\nRelationships and sexuality\nShowrunner-writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge remarked that the characters \"give each other life in a way that's more complex than a romantic relationship It's sexual, it's intellectual, it's aspirational.\" [46] Along these lines, Melanie McFarland wrote in Salon that the show's \"careful awareness of the love languages of fashion, music and setting all play roles in strengthening (the audience's) affair\" with the characters [50] Hannah Giorgis wrote in The Atlantic that its \"greatest success\" is how alluring it makes Villanelle to an intelligence agent dedicated to tracking her down [63] Calling Killing Eve a \"sexually charged female-buddy-comedy espionage nailbiter\", Jenna Scherer wrote in Rolling Stone that the actresses \"share a crackling chemistry, one that situates them in a gray realm between bitter enemies and would-be lovers\" [64]\n\n\nPortrayals\nJia Tolentino wrote in The New Yorker that the \"women are deeply strange, forming a collective study in improbable contrasts, strung together by each actor's charisma\" [45] Matt Zoller Seitz wrote in Vulture that Oh's performance as Polastri actually makes Villanelle's character feel more plausible – as \"an incarnation of Eve's sublimated aggression and assertiveness\" [48] Though Jia Tolentino wrote in The New Yorker that Villanelle's character \"works\" because of Comer's \"mercurial, unassailable charisma\", [45] and Willa Paskin wrote in Slate that Comer's Villanelle (twisted and conscienceless but also irrepressible) is \"flat-out incredible\" [47] and Mike Hale agreed in The New York Times that Comer is good in that \"showier part\" Hale added that it is Ms Oh who ensures the series is \"more than a cute gloss on the glamorous international caper.\" [49]\n\n\nFashion\nA pink tulle dress worn in the first-series episode \"I'll Deal with Him Later\", designed by Molly Goddard, was heralded as a \"fashion moment\" [68] that inspired the dresses worn on red carpets in the subsequent awards season, including an overwhelming showing of pink at the 91st Academy Awards ceremony in 2019 [69] [70] [71] [72]\n\n\nVillanelle\nThe character Villanelle's relationship to fashion has been described by many people Gilly Ferguson of Grazia says that she has become a \"style icon\" [75] Luke Jennings, author of the book series on which the show is based, says that \"Clothes reflect her status and independence [...] She doesn't have to conform or please anyone's gaze\"; Charlotte Mitchell agrees that \"She plays by her own rules\" [73] Sonia Saraiya of Vanity Fair considers Villanelle's outfits \"their own subplot\"; she notes that the character choosing to live in Paris is also a nod to the emphasis on fashion in the show [76] Melania Hidalgo of The Cut writes that \"Villanelle reverses the style of a typical femme fatale, wearing everyday basics on her missions while saving the choicest items in her wardrobe for her days off\"; [77] in reference to a specific outfit, Steff Yotka of Vogue says that Villanelle has \"redefined the look of an international assassin story\" by subverting classic tactical gear and sleekness [78] Mitchell also said of Villanelle that she \"uses color to provoke reactions\", pointing to the pink Molly Goddard dress [73]\n\n\nEve Polastri\nConsidered Villanelle's fashion foil by Entertainment Weekly, Eve Polastri has been described as considering fashion \"trivial\" and not bothering to dress well Jennings suggested that even if she cared, \"she'd be hopeless at it\"; Mitchell and de Gaye crafted outfits that match Eve's practical attitude, with Mitchell saying that she \"wears elastic waists  [because] she doesn't have time to do up a button fly\" [73] Other choices include more clothes made of linen to more easily appear dishevelled [73] Eve is allowed some moments of being well-dressed, however, which are significant to the plot, including trying on dresses that Villanelle has chosen for her in her own stolen suitcase [76]\n\n\nReception\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the first season has an approval rating of 96% based on 155 reviews, with an average rating of 8.3/10 The website's critical consensus

{"title": "Remembrance_Day", "content": "\nObservance in the Commonwealth\nThe common British, Canadian, South African, and ANZAC tradition includes a one or two-minute silence at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month (11:00 am, 11 November), as that marks the time (in the United Kingdom) when the armistice became effective [5]\n\n\nAustralia\nIn Australia, Remembrance Day is always observed on 11 November, regardless of the day of the week, and is not a public holiday; it is a time when people can pay their respects to the substantial number of soldiers who died in battle Some institutions observe two-minutes' silence at 11 am through a program named Read 2 Remember, [8] children read the Pledge of Remembrance by Rupert McCall, and teachers deliver specially developed resources to help children understand the significance of the day and the resilience of those who have fought for their country and call on children to also be resilient when facing difficult times Services are held at 11 am at war memorials and schools in suburbs and cities across the country, at which the \"Last Post\" is sounded by a bugler and a one-minute silence is observed  Some institutions observe this solemn occasion at 1111h on the day, adding two more soldiers to the ranks When Remembrance Day falls on a normal working day in Melbourne and other major cities, buglers from the Australian Defence Force often play the \"Last Post\" at major street corners in the CBD While this occurs, the majority of passers-by stop and observe a moment of silence while waiting for the bugler to finish the recital [9]\n\n\nHistory in Australia\nIn interwar Australia, Remembrance Day (then often referred to as Armistice Day) was a popular public commemoration But from 1946 to the 1970s, Australians observed Remembrance Sunday following the British pattern [10] It is only in the 1980s and 1990s that Remembrance Day was once again systematically observed on 11 November The resurgence of Remembrance Day became official on 30 October 1997, when the Governor-General, under the Howard government, proclaimed that \"(a) 11 November in each year shall be known and observed as Remembrance Day; and (b) all Australians are urged to observe, unless impractical, a minute's silence at 11:00 on Remembrance Day each year\" [11]\n\n\nBarbados\nIn Barbados, Remembrance Day is not a public holiday It is recognised as 11 November, but the parade and ceremonial events are carried out on Remembrance Sunday [13]\nThe day is commemorated to recognise the Barbadian soldiers who died fighting in the First and Second World Wars The parade is held at National Heroes' Square, where an interdenominational service is held [14] The Governor-General and Barbadian Prime Minister are among those who attend, along with other government dignitaries and the heads of the police and military forces During the main ceremony a gun salute, wreaths, and prayers are also performed at the war memorial Cenotaph at the heart of Heroes' Square in Bridgetown [15]\n\n\nBelize\nIn Belize, Remembrance Day is observed on 11 November [16] It is not a public holiday.\n\n\nBermuda\nIn the British Overseas Territory and former Imperial fortress of Bermuda, which sent the first colonial volunteer unit to the Western Front in 1915, and which had more people per capita in uniform during the Second World War than any other part of the Empire, Remembrance Day is still an important holiday The parade in Hamilton had historically been a large and colourful one, as contingents from the Royal Navy, British Regular Army and Territorial Army units of the Bermuda Garrison, the Canadian Forces, the US Army, Air Force, and Navy, and various cadet corps and other services all at one time or another marched with the veterans Since the closing of British, Canadian, and American bases in 1995, the parade has barely grown smaller In addition to the ceremony held in the City of Hamilton on Remembrance Day itself, marching to the Cenotaph (a smaller replica of the one in London), where wreaths are laid and orations made, the Royal Navy and the Bermuda Sea Cadet Corps held a parade the same day at the HMS Jervis Bay memorial in Hamilton, and a smaller military parade is also held in St George's on the nearest Sunday to Remembrance Day before the Royal Garrison Artillery memorial in the King's Square [17]\n\n\nCanada\nVeterans Affairs Canada states that Remembrance Day (Jour du Souvenir) is intended for \"remembrance for the men and women who have served, and continue to serve our country during times of war, conflict and peace\"; particularly the First and Second World Wars, the Korean War, and all conflicts since then in which members of the Canadian Armed Forces have participated [18] The department runs a program called Canada Remembers, with the mission of helping young and new Canadians, most of whom have never known war, \"come to understand and appreciate what those who have served Canada in times of war, armed conflict, and peace stand for and what they have sacrificed for their country.\" [19]\n\n\nHistory in Canada\nCanadians began to commemorate their veterans and war dead as early as 1890, when Decoration Day began to be observed on 2 June, the anniversary of the Battle of Ridgeway against the Fenians in 1866 [28] [29] A further observance was, from 1900 to 1918, held on 27 February to mark the Canadian victory over the Boers at the Battle of Paardeberg [28] [30]\n\n\nCeremonies\nThe national ceremonies organized by the federal government is held at the National War Memorial in Ottawa These are presided over by the governor general of Canada (who acts as commander-in-chief in the monarch's name) and attended by the prime minister, other dignitaries, the Silver Cross mother, and public observers Occasionally, a member of the Canadian royal family may also be present (such as Prince Charles in 2009 [36] and Princess Anne in 2014 [37]).\n\n\nIndia\nIn India, the day is usually marked by tributes and ceremonies in army cantonments There are memorial services in some churches such as St Mark's Cathedral and St John's Church in Bangalore [42] At Kohima and Imphal in the remote hillsides of Northeast India, services of remembrance supported by the Indian Army are observed at Kohima and Imphal War Cemeteries (maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission) The day is also marked at the Delhi War Cemetery [43] In other places in India this event is not observed In 2013, Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, marked the day in Mumbai's St John the Evangelist Church [44]\n\n\nKenya\nIn Kenya, the Kenya Armed Forces Old Comrades Association (KAFOCA) was established in Kenya immediately in 1945 to cater for the welfare of the Ex-servicemen of the First and the Second World Wars The KAFOCA and Kenyan government recognise Remembrance Day [45]\n\n\nNew Zealand\nArmistice Day was observed in New Zealand between the World Wars, although it was always secondary to Anzac Day As in other countries, New Zealand's Armistice Day was converted to Remembrance Day after World War II However, by the mid-1950s, the day was virtually ignored, even by churches and veterans' organisations [46]\n\n\nSaint Lucia\nLike Barbados, Saint Lucia does not recognise Remembrance Day as a public holiday Instead, ceremonial events such as parades and other activities are held on Remembrance Sunday The parade is held at the central square, namely the Derek Walcott Square, where the Cenotaph is located There, members of the Royal St Lucia Police Force and other uniformed groups such as the St Lucia Cadet Corps pay tribute through commemoration of St Lucian men and women who fought in the war [50]\n\n\nSouth Africa\nIn South Africa, Remembrance Day is not a public holiday Commemoration ceremonies are usually held on the nearest Sunday, at which the \"Last Post\" is played by a bugler followed by the observation of a two-minute silence Ceremonies to mark the event in South Africa are held at the Cenotaph in Cape Town, [51] and in Pretoria at the Voortrekker Monument cenotaph and the War Memorial at the Union Buildings Many high schools hold Remembrance Day services to honour the past pupils who died in the two World Wars and the Border War In addition, the South African Legion of Military Veterans holds a street collection on the nearest Saturday to gather funds to assist in welfare work among military veterans [52]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nWreath-laying ceremonies, usually organised by local branches of the Royal British Legion, are observed on Remembrance Day at most war memorials across the UK at 11 am on 11 November, with two minutes of silence observed;

It is observed on November 11th of every year, at 11:00 am, which marks the time when the armistice between the Allied Powers and Germany became effective in 1918.\n\nObservance in the Commonwealth\n\nThe common British, Canadian, South African, and ANZAC tradition includes a one or two-minute silence at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month (11:00 am, 11 November), as that marks the time (in the United Kingdom) when the armistice became effective.\n\nAustralia\n\nIn Australia, Remembrance Day is always observed on 11 November, regardless of the day of the week, and is not a public holiday; it is a time when people can pay their respects to the substantial number of soldiers who died in battle. Some institutions observe two-minutes' silence at 11 am through a program named Read 2 Remember, where children read the Pledge of Remembrance by Rupert McCall, and teachers deliver specially developed resources to help children understand the significance of the day and the resilience of those who have fought for their country and call on children to also be resilient when facing difficult times. Services are held at 11 am at war memorials and schools in suburbs and cities across the country, at which the \"Last Post\" is sounded by a bugler and a one-minute silence is observed. Some institutions observe this solemn occasion at 1111h on the day, adding two more soldiers to the ranks. When Remembrance Day falls on a normal working day in Melbourne and other major cities, buglers from the Australian Defence Force often play the \"Last Post\" at major street corners in the CBD. While this occurs, the majority of passers-by stop and observe a moment of silence while waiting for the bugler to finish the recital.\n\nHistory in Australia\n\nIn interwar Australia, Remembrance Day (then often referred to as Armistice Day) was a popular public commemoration. But from 1946 to the 1970s, Australians observed Remembrance Sunday following the British pattern. It is only in the 1980s and 1990s that Remembrance Day was once again systematically observed on 11 November. The resurgence of Remembrance Day became official on 30 October 1997, when the Governor-General, under the Howard government, proclaimed that \"(a) 11 November in each year shall be known and observed as Remembrance Day; and (b) all Australians are urged to observe, unless impractical, a minute's silence at 11:00 on Remembrance Day each year.\"\n\nBarbados\n\nIn Barbados, Remembrance Day is not a public holiday. It is recognised as 11 November, but the parade and ceremonial events are carried out on Remembrance Sunday. The day is commemorated to recognize the Barbadian soldiers who died fighting in the First and Second World Wars. The parade is held at National Heroes' Square, where an interdenominational service is held. The Governor-General and Barbadian Prime Minister are among those who attend, along with other government dignitaries and the heads of the police and military forces. During the main ceremony, a gun salute, wreaths, and prayers are also performed at the war memorial Cenotaph at the heart of Heroes' Square in Bridgetown.\n\nBelize\n\nIn Belize, Remembrance Day is observed on 11 November. It is not a public holiday.\n\nBermuda\n\nIn the British Overseas Territory and former Imperial fortress of Bermuda, which sent the first colonial volunteer unit to the Western Front in 1915, and which had more people per capita in uniform during the Second World War than any other part of the Empire, Remembrance Day is still an important holiday. The parade in Hamilton had historically been a large and colourful one, as contingents from the Royal Navy, British Regular Army and Territorial Army units of the Bermuda Garrison, the Canadian Forces, the US Army, Air Force, and Navy, and various cadet corps and other services all at one time or another marched with the veterans. Since the closing of British, Canadian, and American bases in 1995, the parade has barely grown smaller. In addition to the ceremony held in the City of Hamilton on Remembrance Day itself, marching to the Cenotaph (a smaller replica of the one in London), where wreaths are laid and orations made, the Royal Navy and the Bermuda Sea Cadet Corps held a parade the same day at the HMS Jervis Bay memorial in Hamilton, and a smaller military parade is also held in St George's on the nearest Sunday to Remembrance Day before the Royal Garrison Artillery memorial in the King's Square.\n\nCanada\n\nVeterans Affairs Canada states that Remembrance Day (Jour du Souvenir) is intended for \"remembrance for the men and women who have served, and continue to serve our country during times of war, conflict and peace\"; particularly the First and Second World Wars, the Korean War, and all conflicts since then in which members of the Canadian Armed Forces have participated. The department runs a program called Canada Remembers, with the mission of helping young and new Canadians, most of whom have never known war, \"come to understand and appreciate what those who have served Canada in times of war, armed conflict, and peace stand for and what they have sacrificed for their country.\"\n\nHistory in Canada\n\nCanadians began to commemorate their veterans and war dead as early as 1890, when Decoration Day began to be observed on 2 June, the anniversary of the Battle of Ridgeway against the Fenians in 1866. A further observance was, from 1900 to 1918, held on 27 February to mark the Canadian victory over the Boers at the Battle of Paardeberg.\n\nCeremonies\n\nThe national ceremonies organized by the federal government is held at the National War Memorial in Ottawa. These are presided over by the governor general of Canada (who acts as commander-in-chief in the monarch's name) and attended by the prime minister, other dignitaries, the Silver Cross mother, and public observers. Occasionally, a member of the Canadian royal family may also be present (such as Prince Charles in 2009 and Princess Anne in 2014).\n\nIndia\n\nIn India, the day is usually marked by tributes and ceremonies in army cantonments. Memorial services are held in some churches, such as St Mark's Cathedral and St John's Church in Bangalore. At Kohima and Imphal in the remote hillsides of Northeast India, services of remembrance supported by the Indian Army are observed at Kohima and Imphal War Cemeteries (maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission). The day is also marked at the Delhi War Cemetery. In other places in India, this event is not observed. In 2013, Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, marked the day in Mumbai's St John the Evangelist Church.\n\nKenya\n\nIn Kenya, the Kenya Armed Forces Old Comrades Association (KAFOCA) was established in Kenya immediately in 1945 to cater for the welfare of the Ex-servicemen of the First and the Second World Wars. KAFOCA and the Kenyan government recognize Remembrance Day.\n\nNew Zealand\n\nArmistice Day was observed in New Zealand between the World Wars, although it was always secondary to Anzac Day. As in other countries, New Zealand's Armistice Day was converted to Remembrance Day after World War II. However, by the mid-1950s, the day was virtually ignored, even by churches and veterans' organisations.\n\nSaint Lucia\n\nLike Barbados, Saint Lucia does not recognize Remembrance Day as a public holiday. Instead, ceremonial events such as parades and other activities are held on Remembrance Sunday. The parade is held at the central square, namely the Derek Walcott Square, where the Cenotaph is located. There, members of the Royal St Lucia Police Force and other uniformed groups such as the St Lucia Cadet Corps pay tribute through commemoration of St Lucian men and women who fought in the war.\n\nSouth Africa\n\nIn South Africa, Remembrance Day is not a public holiday. Commemoration ceremonies are usually held on the nearest Sunday, at which the \"Last Post\" is played by a bugler followed by the observation of a two-minute silence. Ceremonies to mark the event in South Africa are held at the Cenotaph in Cape Town, and in Pretoria at the Voortrekker Monument cenotaph and the War Memorial at the Union Buildings. Many high schools hold Remembrance Day services to honour the past pupils who died in the two World Wars and the Border War. In addition, the South African Legion of Military Veterans holds a street collection on the nearest Saturday to gather funds to assist in welfare work among military veterans.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nWreath-laying ceremonies, usually organized by local branches of the Royal British Legion, are observed on Remembrance Day at most war memorials across the UK at 11 am on 11 November, with two minutes of silence observed. A custom which had lapsed before a campaign for its revival began in the early 1990s. The silence is also broadcast as a special programme on BBC with a voice over usually saying \"This is BBC One Now on the 11th hour, of the 11th day of the 11th month. The traditional two-minute silence for Armistice Day.\" The programme starts with a close up of the Big Ben clock chiming 11 and then the programme shows different parts of the world observing the silence. The programme ends with a bugler sounding \"The Rouse\" and then normal programming is resumed.\n\nRemembrance Sunday\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the main observance is Remembrance Sunday, held on the Sunday nearest to 11 November. There is a National Service of Remembrance in London, as well as other services and ceremonies in the regions. Typically, poppy wreaths are laid by representatives of the Crown, the armed forces, and local civic leaders, as well as by local organizations including ex-servicemen organizations, cadet forces, the Scouts, Guides, Boys' Brigade, St John Ambulance, and the Salvation Army. A minute's or two minutes' silence is also frequently incorporated into church services.\n\nCommemorative coins and exhibitions\n\nIn 2014, the Royal Mint issued a colour-printed Alderney £5 coin, designed by engraver Laura Clancy, to commemorate Remembrance Day.\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\nRemembrance Day is officially observed in Northern Ireland in the same way as in the rest of United Kingdom, although it tends to be associated more with the unionist community. Most Irish nationalists and republicans do not take part in the public commemoration of British soldiers organized by the Royal British Legion. This is mainly due to the actions of the British Army during The Troubles. However, some moderate nationalists began to attend Remembrance Day events as a way to connect with the unionist community. In 1987, a bomb was detonated by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) just before a Remembrance Sunday ceremony in Enniskillen, killing eleven people. The bombing was widely condemned, and attendance at Remembrance events, by both nationalists and unionists, rose in the following years. The Republic of Ireland has a National Day of Commemoration in July for all Irish people who have died in war.\n\nRelated observances elsewhere\n\nAlongside Commonwealth countries, several other countries also commemorate their war dead on 11 November, the anniversary of the Armistice of Compiègne. Several other countries observe the anniversary of other notable events in World War I to commemorate the war dead from that conflict, such as the date of the Armistice of Villa Giusti, which went into effect on 4 November.\n\nBelgium and France\n\nRemembrance Day (11 November) is a national holiday in France and Belgium. It commemorates the armistice signed between the Allies and Germany at Compiègne, France, for the cessation of hostilities on the Western Front, which took effect at 11:00 am—the \"eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month.\" Armistice Day is one of the most important military commemorations in France, since it was a major French victory, and the French paid a heavy price in blood to achieve it. Almost all French villages feature memorials dedicated to those fallen during the conflict. In France, the blue cornflower (Bleuet de France) is used symbolically rather than the poppy.\n\nHong Kong\n\nRemembrance Day was formerly observed in British Hong Kong, although it has not been a public holiday since the handover of Hong Kong from the UK to China in July 1997.\n\nItaly\n\nIn Italy, the National Unity and Armed Forces Day is observed on 4 November to commemorate the country's victory in World War I, and the completion of the unification of Italy. The date is the anniversary of the Armistice of Villa Giusti, which effectively ended combat between the Allies of World War I and Austria-Hungary in 1918. Since 1977, this day has not been a public holiday; now, many services are held on the first Sunday in November.\n\nRussia\n\nIn Russia, the Russian Day of Remembrance of Victims of World War I is observed on 1 August to honour Russian soldiers from that conflict. The date is the anniversary of the German declaration of war on Russia in 1914, resulting in the Russian entry into World War I.\n\nSerbia\n\nSerbia has observed Armistice Day on 11 November since 2012. The statutory holiday was created to commemorate the victims of World War I. To commemorate their victims, people in Serbia wear Natalie's ramonda as a symbol of remembrance.\n\nUnited States\n\nVeterans Day is observed in the United States on 11 November and is both a federal holiday and a state holiday in all states. In the United States, and some other allied nations, 11 November was formerly known as Armistice Day; in the United States, it was given its new name in 1954 at the end of the Korean War to honour all veterans. Veterans Day is observed with memorial ceremonies, salutes at military cemeteries, and parades. However, the function of the observance elsewhere is more closely matched by Memorial Day, another commemorative holiday held in May.\n\nSimilar holidays commemorating veterans\n\nIn Croatia, Day of Remembrance for the Victims of the Homeland War and Day of Remembrance for the Victims of Vukovar and Škabrnja is a national public holiday and a non-working day in memory of all victims of the Homeland War in Croatia. The holiday is celebrated on November 18, the day of the fall of the city of Vukovar in the 1991 Homeland War, when the Yugoslav People's Army and Serbian paramilitaries committed the two most massive crimes in Croatia during the Croatian War of Independence in two Croatian towns, Vukovar and Škabrnja.

particularly the First and Second World Wars, the Korean War, and all conflicts since then in which members of the Canadian Armed Forces have participated [18] The department runs a program called Canada Remembers, with the mission of helping young and new Canadians, most of whom have never known war, \"come to understand and appreciate what those who have served Canada in times of war, armed conflict, and peace stand for and what they have sacrificed for their country.\" [19]\n\n\nHistory in Canada\nCanadians began to commemorate their veterans and war dead as early as 1890, when Decoration Day began to be observed on 2 June, the anniversary of the Battle of Ridgeway against the Fenians in 1866 [28] [29] A further observance was, from 1900 to 1918, held on 27 February to mark the Canadian victory over the Boers at the Battle of Paardeberg [28] [30]\n\n\nCeremonies\nThe national ceremonies organized by the federal government is held at the National War Memorial in Ottawa These are presided over by the governor general of Canada (who acts as commander-in-chief in the monarch's name) and attended by the prime minister, other dignitaries, the Silver Cross mother, and public observers Occasionally, a member of the Canadian royal family may also be present (such as Prince Charles in 2009 [36] and Princess Anne in 2014 [37]).\n\n\nIndia\nIn India, the day is usually marked by tributes and ceremonies in army cantonments There are memorial services in some churches such as St Mark's Cathedral and St John's Church in Bangalore [42] At Kohima and Imphal in the remote hillsides of Northeast India, services of remembrance supported by the Indian Army are observed at Kohima and Imphal War Cemeteries (maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission) The day is also marked at the Delhi War Cemetery [43] In other places in India this event is not observed In 2013, Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, marked the day in Mumbai's St John the Evangelist Church [44]\n\n\nKenya\nIn Kenya, the Kenya Armed Forces Old Comrades Association (KAFOCA) was established in Kenya immediately in 1945 to cater for the welfare of the Ex-servicemen of the First and the Second World Wars The KAFOCA and Kenyan government recognise Remembrance Day [45]\n\n\nNew Zealand\nArmistice Day was observed in New Zealand between the World Wars, although it was always secondary to Anzac Day As in other countries, New Zealand's Armistice Day was converted to Remembrance Day after World War II However, by the mid-1950s, the day was virtually ignored, even by churches and veterans' organisations [46]\n\n\nSaint Lucia\nLike Barbados, Saint Lucia does not recognise Remembrance Day as a public holiday Instead, ceremonial events such as parades and other activities are held on Remembrance Sunday The parade is held at the central square, namely the Derek Walcott Square, where the Cenotaph is located There, members of the Royal St Lucia Police Force and other uniformed groups such as the St Lucia Cadet Corps pay tribute through commemoration of St Lucian men and women who fought in the war [50]\n\n\nSouth Africa\nIn South Africa, Remembrance Day is not a public holiday Commemoration ceremonies are usually held on the nearest Sunday, at which the \"Last Post\" is played by a bugler followed by the observation of a two-minute silence Ceremonies to mark the event in South Africa are held at the Cenotaph in Cape Town, [51] and in Pretoria at the Voortrekker Monument cenotaph and the War Memorial at the Union Buildings Many high schools hold Remembrance Day services to honour the past pupils who died in the two World Wars and the Border War In addition, the South African Legion of Military Veterans holds a street collection on the nearest Saturday to gather funds to assist in welfare work among military veterans [52]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nWreath-laying ceremonies, usually organised by local branches of the Royal British Legion, are observed on Remembrance Day at most war memorials across the UK at 11 am on 11 November, with two minutes of silence observed; a custom which had lapsed before a campaign for its revival began in the early 1990s [53] The silence is also broadcast as a special programme on BBC with a voice over usually saying \"This is BBC One Now on the 11th hour, of the 11th day of the 11th month The traditional two-minute silence for Armistice Day.\" The programme starts with a close up of the Big Ben clock chiming 11 and then the programme shows different parts of the world observing the silence The programme ends with a bugler sounding \"The Rouse\" and then normal programming is resumed [54]\n\n\nRemembrance Sunday\nIn the United Kingdom, the main observance is Remembrance Sunday, held on the Sunday nearest to 11 November There is a National Service of Remembrance in London, as well as other services and ceremonies in the regions Typically, poppy wreaths are laid by representatives of the Crown, the armed forces, and local civic leaders, as well as by local organisations including ex-servicemen organisations, cadet forces, the Scouts, Guides, Boys' Brigade, St John Ambulance and the Salvation Army [58] [59] A minute's or two minutes' silence is also frequently incorporated into church services [60]\n\n\nCommemorative coins and exhibitions\nIn 2014, the Royal Mint issued a colour-printed Alderney £5 coin, designed by engraver Laura Clancy, to commemorate Remembrance Day [62]\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\nRemembrance Day is officially observed in Northern Ireland in the same way as in the rest of United Kingdom, although it tends to be associated more with the unionist community Most Irish nationalists and republicans do not take part in the public commemoration of British soldiers organised by the Royal British Legion This is mainly due to the actions of the British Army during The Troubles However, some moderate nationalists began to attend Remembrance Day events as a way to connect with the unionist community In 1987 a bomb was detonated by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) just before a Remembrance Sunday ceremony in Enniskillen, killing eleven people The bombing was widely condemned and attendance at Remembrance events, by both nationalists and unionists, rose in the following years [65] The Republic of Ireland has a National Day of Commemoration in July for all Irish people who have died in war [66]\n\n\nRelated observances elsewhere\nAlongside Commonwealth countries, several other countries also commemorate their war dead on 11 November, the anniversary of the Armistice of Compiègne Several other countries observe the anniversary of other notable events in World War I to commemorate the war dead from that conflict, such as the date of the Armistice of Villa Giusti, which went into effect on 4 November.\n\n\nBelgium and France\nRemembrance Day (11 November) is a national holiday in France and Belgium It commemorates the armistice signed between the Allies and Germany at Compiègne, France, for the cessation of hostilities on the Western Front, which took effect at 11:00 am—the \"eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month.\" Armistice Day is one of the most important military commemorations in France, since it was a major French victory, and the French paid a heavy price in blood to achieve it The First World War was considered in France as the \"Great Patriotic War\" [67] Almost all French villages feature memorials dedicated to those fallen during the conflict [68] In France the blue cornflower (Bleuet de France) is used symbolically rather than the poppy [69]\n\n\nHong Kong\nRemembrance Day was formerly observed in British Hong Kong, although it has not been a public holiday since the handover of Hong Kong from the UK to China in July 1997.\n\n\nItaly\nIn Italy, the National Unity and Armed Forces Day is observed on 4 November to commemorate the country's victory in World War I, and the completion of the unification of Italy The date is the anniversary of the Armistice of Villa Giusti, which effectively ended combat between the Allies of World War I and Austria-Hungary in 1918 [75]\nSince 1977, this day has not been a public holiday;

It is one of the four domestic trophies attainable by English league teams, along with the Premier League title, the FA Cup, and the FA Community Shield. The competition was established in 1960 and is contested by the 92 members of the Premier League and English Football League.\n\n**Status**\n\nThe EFL Cup is regarded as one of the lower prestige domestic trophies in English football, behind the Premier League title and the FA Cup. However, it is still a significant competition, with the winners receiving a £100,000 prize money and the runners-up receiving £50,000. The FA Cup, on the other hand, offers a £2 million prize money to the winners. Despite this, the EFL Cup remains a popular competition, especially for teams that have been knocked out of the FA Cup or are not contenders for the Premier League title.\n\n**History**\n\nThe original idea for the EFL Cup came from Stanley Rous, who saw the competition as a consolation for clubs that had already been knocked out of the FA Cup. However, it was not Rous who came to implement it, but Football League Secretary Alan Hardaker. Hardaker initially proposed the competition as a way for clubs to make up for lost revenue due to a reduction in matches played, as the league was to be reorganized. The reorganization of the league was not immediately forthcoming, but the cup competition was introduced regardless.\n\nThe first EFL Cup competition was held in the 1960-61 season, with the final being played between Aston Villa and Rotherham United. The competition has undergone several changes over the years, including the introduction of a new format in the 1970s and the use of a separate trophy for the competition from 1981 to 1990.\n\n**Modern Changes**\n\nIn the early 21st century, the EFL Cup underwent significant changes due to the restructuring of European football. The UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, and UEFA Conference League were introduced, and the competition's prize of European qualification was removed. However, the EFL Cup retained its popularity, especially with fans of clubs that have a realistic chance of qualifying for Europe through cup competitions.\n\nThe competition has also undergone changes in its format, with the introduction of a preliminary round in some seasons and the use of a separate trophy for the winners.\n\n**Giant-Killings**\n\nGiant-killings are less well-remembered in the EFL Cup than in the FA Cup, due to the absence of non-league sides and the fact that big clubs often field more inexperienced sides in the early rounds. However, there have been some notable upsets in the competition's history, including the 1966-67 final between Queens Park Rangers and West Bromwich Albion, which saw Queens Park Rangers come from 2-0 down at halftime to win 3-2.\n\n**Format**\n\nThe EFL Cup is open to all 92 members of the Premier League and English Football League. The competition is divided into seven rounds, with the fixtures in every round except the final being determined by a random draw. The competition starts with a preliminary round, which is played between the two teams promoted from the Football Conference the previous season. The winners of the preliminary round join the remaining teams in the first round.\n\nThe competition is played in a knockout format, with each round being a single-elimination tournament. The winners of each match advance to the next round, while the losers are eliminated from the competition.\n\n**Final**\n\nThe EFL Cup final is played as a single match at Wembley Stadium. The final has been played at Wembley since the 1967-68 season, although the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff was used between 2001 and 2007. The final is played between the winners of the two semi-finals, which are played over two legs.\n\nIf the final finishes level after extra time, a replay is played at an alternative venue until a winner is decided. The only final to require two replays was the 1977 final between Aston Villa and Everton.\n\n**Results by Club**\n\nThe EFL Cup has been contested by many teams over the years, with some teams achieving more success than others. The most successful team in the competition is Liverpool, who have won the trophy eight times. Other successful teams include Aston Villa, who have won the trophy seven times, and Leeds United, who have won the trophy three times.\n\n**Trophy**\n\nThe winners of the EFL Cup receive the EFL Cup, which is a three-handled Georgian-style urn with a separate plinth. The trophy is designed and manufactured by Mappin & Webb and weighs 2.976 kg. The trophy is worth around £20,000 and was used until the 1980-81 competition, before coming back into use ever since the 1990-91 competition.\n\n**Broadcasters**\n\nThe EFL Cup is broadcast live in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland by Sky Sports, with 15 matches being shown each season. Highlights from the competition are also shown on ITV Sport, which began broadcasting the competition in the 2022-23 season.\n\n**Records**\n\nAs of the 2023-24 season, the EFL Cup has been contested by 92 teams over 64 seasons. The competition has been won by 22 teams, with Liverpool being the most successful team in the competition's history. The EFL Cup has also been won by teams from the Championship and League One, including Blackburn Rovers and Swansea City.\n\nThe EFL Cup has also been won by teams from the smaller leagues, including Rochdale, who won the trophy in the 2018-19 season.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"EFL_Cup\" following this outline:\n\n\nStatus\nAlthough the League Cup is one of the four domestic trophies attainable by English league teams, it is regarded as of lower prestige than the league title or the FA Cup [2] League Cup winners receive £100,000 prize money (awarded by the Football League) with the runners-up receiving £50,000, considered relatively insignificant to top-flight teams, compared to the £2 million prize money of the FA Cup, which is in turn eclipsed by the Premier League's television money (awarded on final league position) and consequent participation in the Champions League [3] [4]\n\n\nHistory\nThe original idea for a League Cup came from Stanley Rous, who saw the competition as a consolation for clubs who had already been knocked out of the FA Cup However, it was not Rous who came to implement it, but Football League Secretary Alan Hardaker Hardaker initially proposed the competition as a way for the clubs to make up for lost revenue due to a reduction in matches played, for when the league was to be reorganised The reorganisation of the league was not immediately forthcoming;

The tournament was held from December 15, 2021, to January 3, 2022, at the Alexandra Palace in London, England.\n\n**Format**\n\nAll matches were played as single in, double out; requiring the players to score 501 points to win a leg, finishing on either a double or the bullseye. Matches were played to set format, with each set being the best of five legs (first to three). After a one-year break, the tie-break rule came back into force. For all rounds except the first, the final set had to be won by two clear legs, unless the set score went to 5–5, in which case a sudden-death leg was played. This year, there was no throw for the bull in any sudden-death legs.\n\n**Prize Money**\n\nThe prize money for the tournament was £2,500,000 in total – the same as the previous year. The winner's share was £500,000.\n\n**Qualification**\n\nThe top 32 from the PDC Order of Merit began the competition in the second round. The 32 highest ranked players on the PDC Pro Tour Order of Merit (not already qualified) and 32 qualifiers from around the world began in the first round.\n\n**Seeds**\n\n2021 winner Gerwyn Price, who since winning has also won the 2021 Grand Slam of Darts, was top of the two-year PDC Order of Merit and number one seed going into the tournament. 2020 winner Peter Wright, the winner of the 2021 World Matchplay and part of the victorious Scotland team at the 2021 PDC World Cup of Darts, was second seed. Michael van Gerwen, the three-time World Champion from 2014, 2017, and 2019, was third seed.

Van Barneveld was one of two former PDC World Champions to qualify via the Pro Tour, with 2011 and 2012 winner Adrian Lewis also qualifying. The highest-ranked debutant via the Pro Tour was Scott Mitchell, the 2015 BDO World Champion. As well as Mitchell and four-time BDO World Champion Van Barneveld, 1996 BDO champion Steve Beaton also qualified via the Pro Tour, making a record 31st consecutive World Championship appearance.\n\n**Unranked Qualifiers**\n\nThe final group of 32 qualifiers were determined by a series of international qualifiers and secondary tours.

{"title": "Diego_Costa", "content": "\nEarly life\nCosta was born in Lagarto, Sergipe, Brazil, to parents José de Jesus and Josileide [8] His father named him in honour of Argentine footballer Diego Maradona despite the rivalry between the two nations, and he has an elder brother named Jair after Brazilian player Jairzinho [8] Despite regularly playing street football, Costa did not believe as a child that he would turn professional, in part due to the remote location of his hometown [8] He has since set up a football academy in his hometown, where he pays all the costs [9] Costa is a fan of Palmeiras [10]\n\n\nClub career\nCosta signed for his first European club in February 2006, Portugal's Braga [14] He initially struggled with loneliness and the comparatively cold weather of northern Portugal [15] Out of action due to the club's lack of a youth team, he was loaned that summer to Penafiel in the second division, [16] managed by former Portugal international Rui Bento, who desired the \"rough diamond\" [17]\n\n\nEarly career\nCosta signed for his first European club in February 2006, Portugal's Braga [14] He initially struggled with loneliness and the comparatively cold weather of northern Portugal [15] Out of action due to the club's lack of a youth team, he was loaned that summer to Penafiel in the second division, [16] managed by former Portugal international Rui Bento, who desired the \"rough diamond\" [17]\n\n\nCelta Vigo\nLater that month, Costa and Mario Suárez were loaned to Segunda División side Celta de Vigo for the season, and Costa became a regular in the team, managed by former Ballon d'Or winner Hristo Stoichkov [23] In his seventh league match, he scored his first goal in Spanish football in a dominant home victory over Xerez; after scoring, he showboated, causing a brawl which resulted in him being sent off Costa was subsequently rested from Celta's away game at the same opposition The event drew the wrath of Stoichkov, who unexpectedly left his position [24] Towards the middle of the season, he was involved in two further controversies: he struck Málaga defender Weligton in the head, causing an injury which required medical stitches, and was sent off against Sevilla Atlético for diving and dissent, leaving his team to fight for a draw without him [25] The loyal strike partner of Quincy Owusu-Abeyie despite the pair not sharing a common language, he was dropped for Cypriot Ioannis Okkas [25] On 23 March 2008, Costa scored both Celta goals in a 2–1 win at Numancia, the latter after a long dribble; [26] but later on in the campaign, he was sent off against Tenerife at Balaídos, after which Celta went from winning 2–0 to drawing 2–2 [27] The team barely avoided relegation, and Costa earned a reputation for being a disruptive influence [28]\n\n\nAlbacete\nDespite earning a poor reputation for his conduct, Costa attracted interest from Salamanca, Gimnàstic de Tarragona and Málaga after his loan at Celta; García Pitarch ruled out any approach from the latter, fearing how Costa would behave on the Costa del Sol [29] After attending Atlético's pre-season tour of Mexico, he signed on loan for Albacete, also of Segunda División, on 22 August 2008, signing a contract which would have a lower fee depending on how many games he played [30] He initially threatened to terminate his deal with the Castile-La Mancha team, on account of the quality of his teammates and the city's lack of a beach [30] Nine days after signing, he scored a late winner in a 2–1 victory over Sevilla's reserves at the Estadio Carlos Belmonte [31] The Queso Mecánico suffered with financial problems during Costa's loan, with him threatening to strike unless their non-playing staff were paid in full [32] He was dropped to the bench by manager Juan Ignacio Martínez for the home game against Real Sociedad on 13 December as punishment for an argument with goalkeeper Jonathan, but came on as a substitute to score another late winner [33]\n\n\nValladolid\nIn the summer of 2009, Costa was desired by Barcelona for their reserve team, an approach which Atlético rejected, citing that he remained in their plans [37] Frustrated by his lack of opportunities, however, a now overweight Costa argued with his management and attempted to negotiate a move to Brazil's Esporte Clube Vitória [38]\n\n\nAtlético Madrid\nIn June 2010, Costa returned to the Colchoneros, initially as a backup to Sergio Agüero and Diego Forlán – Atlético also paid an undisclosed sum to Braga to buy all the residual 30% economic rights (the former also had to pay in excess of €833,000 in agent's fees to Gestifute [44]) He was an unused substitute as Atlético won the 2010 UEFA Super Cup on 27 August [5]\n\n\n2010–13\nIn June 2010, Costa returned to the Colchoneros, initially as a backup to Sergio Agüero and Diego Forlán – Atlético also paid an undisclosed sum to Braga to buy all the residual 30% economic rights (the former also had to pay in excess of €833,000 in agent's fees to Gestifute [44]) He was an unused substitute as Atlético won the 2010 UEFA Super Cup on 27 August [5]\n\n\n2013–14 season\nIn August 2013, Costa was heavily linked with a move to Liverpool, who allegedly matched his release clause of €25 million and offered him three times his salary at Atlético [62] Costa, however, chose to stay at the club and renewed his contract until 2018, while also doubling his wages; [63] a few days after this, in the first match of the new season on 19 August, he scored a brace in a 3–1 win at Sevilla [64]\n\n\nChelsea\nHaving completed his medical in June, [81] [82] Chelsea announced on 1 July 2014 that they had agreed to meet the £32 million buy-out clause in Costa's contract [83] [84] [85] On 15 July, Chelsea confirmed the completion of the signing of Costa, who signed a five-year contract on a salary of £150,000 a week [86] [87] On signing, Costa said, \"I am very happy to sign for Chelsea Everybody knows it is a big club in a very competitive league, and I am very excited to get started in England with a fantastic coach and team-mates Having played against Chelsea last season I know the high quality of the squad I am joining\" [86] Following the departure of former Chelsea striker Demba Ba, Costa inherited his number 19 shirt, [88] the same number he wore at the 2014 World Cup for Spain and previously at Atlético.\n\n\n2014–15 season\nCosta scored on his Chelsea debut on 27 July, running onto a through ball from Cesc Fàbregas in a 2–1 friendly win against Slovene club Olimpija [89] His first

Costa**\n\nDiego Costa is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a striker for Brazilian club Botafogo and the Brazil national team. He has also played for Chelsea and Atlético Madrid in the Spanish La Liga.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nDiego Costa was born in Lagarto, Sergipe, Brazil, to parents José de Jesus and Josileide. His father named him in honour of Argentine footballer Diego Maradona, despite the rivalry between the two nations. He has an elder brother named Jair after Brazilian player Jairzinho. As a child, Costa did not believe he would turn professional, partly due to the remote location of his hometown. He has since set up a football academy in his hometown, where he pays all the costs. Costa is a fan of Palmeiras.\n\n**Club Career**\n\nCosta signed for his first European club in February 2006, Portugal's Braga. He initially struggled with loneliness and the comparatively cold weather of northern Portugal. Out of action due to the club's lack of a youth team, he was loaned that summer to Penafiel in the second division, managed by former Portugal international Rui Bento, who desired the \"rough diamond\".\n\n**Celta Vigo**\n\nLater that month, Costa and Mario Suárez were loaned to Segunda División side Celta de Vigo for the season, and Costa became a regular in the team, managed by former Ballon d'Or winner Hristo Stoichkov. In his seventh league match, he scored his first goal in Spanish football in a dominant home victory over Xerez; after scoring, he showboated, causing a brawl which resulted in him being sent off. Costa was subsequently rested from Celta's away game at the same opposition. The event drew the wrath of Stoichkov, who unexpectedly left his position.\n\nTowards the middle of the season, he was involved in two further controversies: he struck Málaga defender Weligton in the head, causing an injury which required medical stitches, and was sent off against Sevilla Atlético for diving and dissent, leaving his team to fight for a draw without him. The loyal strike partner of Quincy Owusu-Abeyie despite the pair not sharing a common language, he was dropped for Cypriot Ioannis Okkas. On 23 March 2008, Costa scored both Celta goals in a 2–1 win at Numancia, the latter after a long dribble. However, later on in the campaign, he was sent off against Tenerife at Balaídos, after which Celta went from winning 2–0 to drawing 2–2. The team barely avoided relegation, and Costa earned a reputation for being a disruptive influence.\n\n**Albacete**\n\nDespite earning a poor reputation for his conduct, Costa attracted interest from Salamanca, Gimnàstic de Tarragona and Málaga after his loan at Celta. García Pitarch ruled out any approach from the latter, fearing how Costa would behave on the Costa del Sol. After attending Atlético's pre-season tour of Mexico, he signed on loan for Albacete, also of Segunda División, on 22 August 2008, signing a contract which would have a lower fee depending on how many games he played. He initially threatened to terminate his deal with the Castile-La Mancha team, on account of the quality of his teammates and the city's lack of a beach. Nine days after signing, he scored a late winner in a 2–1 victory over Sevilla's reserves at the Estadio Carlos Belmonte.\n\nThe Queso Mecánico suffered with financial problems during Costa's loan, with him threatening to strike unless their non-playing staff were paid in full. He was dropped to the bench by manager Juan Ignacio Martínez for the home game against Real Sociedad on 13 December as punishment for an argument with goalkeeper Jonathan, but came on as a substitute to score another late winner.\n\n**Valladolid**\n\nIn the summer of 2009, Costa was desired by Barcelona for their reserve team, an approach which Atlético rejected, citing that he remained in their plans. Frustrated by his lack of opportunities, however, a now overweight Costa argued with his management and attempted to negotiate a move to Brazil's Esporte Clube Vitória.\n\n**Atlético Madrid**\n\nIn June 2010, Costa returned to the Colchoneros, initially as a backup to Sergio Agüero and Diego Forlán – Atlético also paid an undisclosed sum to Braga to buy all the residual 30% economic rights (the former also had to pay in excess of €833,000 in agent's fees to Gestifute). He was an unused substitute as Atlético won the 2010 UEFA Super Cup on 27 August.\n\n**2013–14 Season**\n\nIn August 2013, Costa was heavily linked with a move to Liverpool, who allegedly matched his release clause of €25 million and offered him three times his salary at Atlético. Costa, however, chose to stay at the club and renewed his contract until 2018, while also doubling his wages. A few days after this, in the first match of the new season on 19 August, he scored a brace in a 3–1 win at Sevilla.\n\n**Chelsea**\n\nHaving completed his medical in June, Chelsea announced on 1 July 2014 that they had agreed to meet the £32 million buy-out clause in Costa's contract. On 15 July, Chelsea confirmed the completion of the signing of Costa, who signed a five-year contract on a salary of £150,000 a week. On signing, Costa said, \"I am very happy to sign for Chelsea Everybody knows it is a big club in a very competitive league, and I am very excited to get started in England with a fantastic coach and team-mates Having played against Chelsea last season I know the high quality of the squad I am joining.\" Following the departure of former Chelsea striker Demba Ba, Costa inherited his number 19 shirt, the same number he wore at the 2014 World Cup for Spain and previously at Atlético.\n\n**2014–15 Season**\n\nCosta scored on his Chelsea debut on 27 July, running onto a through ball from Cesc Fàbregas in a 2–1 friendly win against Slovene club Olimpija.

[31]\nOn the other hand, there was a steady flow of South Indian migrants to the city who came to take many white-collar jobs.\n\n\nAlliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party\nThe Sena started placing more weight on the Hindutva ideology in the 1970s as the 'sons of the soil' cause was weakening [18]\n\n\nFormation of Maharashtra Navanirman Sena\nIn July 2005, Former Maharashtra Chief Minister and Sena leader Narayan Rane was expelled from the party, which sparked internal conflict in the party In December the same year Raj Thackeray, Bal Thackeray's nephew, left the party [40] Raj Thackeray later founded a separate party, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS)  [citation needed] [41]\n\n\nLeadership change\nBal Thackeray's son Uddhav Thackeray became the party's leader in 2004, although Bal Thackeray continued to be an important figurehead After the death of Bal Thackeray on 17 November 2012, Uddhav became the leader of the party but refused to take the title \"Shiv Sena Pramukh\" (Eng : Shiv Sena Supremo) [43] [44]\n\n\nIdeology shifts\nThe Shiv Sena party's ideology has undergone changes since its formation Initially, it started with the ideology of Marathi regionalism under the leadership of Bal Thackeray [45] [6] However, the party shifted towards ultranationalism and right-wing populism over time, which helped them form an alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) [46] [47]  [verification needed] When Uddhav Thackeray became the party leader, he gradually shifted towards composite nationalism and formed an alliance with the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) [48] This shift in ideology was a significant departure from Shiv Sena's traditional stance, as the party had been historically opposed to the Congress and NCP for the majority of its existence.\n\n\n2022 Political crisis and split in the party\nIn late June 2022, Eknath Shinde, a senior Shiv Sena leader, and the majority of MLAs from Shiv Sena joined hands with the BJP [49] [50] [51] Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari called for a trust vote, an action that would later on be described as a \"sad spectacle\"  [52] by Supreme Court of India, and draw criticism from Political

It was founded in 1966 by Bal Thackeray, a charismatic leader who advocated for the rights of the Marathi-speaking people. The party has a significant presence in the state and has been a key player in Maharashtra's politics for several decades.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Shiv Sena was founded on June 19, 1966, by Bal Thackeray, a charismatic leader who advocated for the rights of the Marathi-speaking people. The party's early years were marked by a strong focus on Marathi regionalism, with Thackeray calling for the protection of Marathi culture and language. The party's first major success came in 1968, when it won several municipal corporation seats in Mumbai.\n\nIn the 1970s, the Shiv Sena began to shift its focus towards ultranationalism and right-wing populism. This shift was driven by Thackeray's desire to create a sense of national unity and to promote a sense of pride and identity among Indians. The party's ideology was influenced by the ideas of V.D. Savarkar, a Hindu nationalist leader who advocated for a strong and unified India.\n\n**Origins**\n\nThe Shiv Sena was founded in the aftermath of India's independence, when the country was divided into several linguistic states. The party's early years were marked by a strong focus on Marathi regionalism, with Thackeray calling for the protection of Marathi culture and language. The party's first major success came in 1968, when it won several municipal corporation seats in Mumbai.\n\n**Alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party**\n\nIn the 1970s, the Shiv Sena started placing more weight on the Hindutva ideology, which emphasized the importance of Hinduism in Indian society. This shift was driven by the party's desire to appeal to a broader audience and to create a sense of national unity. The party's alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was a key factor in its rise to power.\n\n**Formation of Maharashtra Navanirman Sena**\n\nIn 2005, the Shiv Sena's former leader, Narayan Rane, was expelled from the party, which led to internal conflict. Raj Thackeray, Bal Thackeray's nephew, also left the party and founded the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS).\n\n**Leadership Change**\n\nBal Thackeray's son, Uddhav Thackeray, became the party's leader in 2004, although Bal Thackeray continued to be an important figurehead. After Bal Thackeray's death in 2012, Uddhav became the leader of the party but refused to take the title \"Shiv Sena Pramukh\" (Eng: Shiv Sena Supremo).\n\n**Ideology Shifts**\n\nThe Shiv Sena party's ideology has undergone changes since its formation. Initially, it started with the ideology of Marathi regionalism under the leadership of Bal Thackeray. However, the party shifted towards ultranationalism and right-wing populism over time, which helped them form an alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). When Uddhav Thackeray became the party leader, he gradually shifted towards composite nationalism and formed an alliance with the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).\n\n**2022 Political Crisis and Split in the Party**\n\nIn June 2022, Eknath Shinde, a senior Shiv Sena leader, and the majority of MLAs from Shiv Sena joined hands with the BJP. Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari called for a trust vote, which was later described as a \"sad spectacle\" by the Supreme Court of India. Uddhav Thackeray resigned from the post as chief minister and a MLC member ahead of no-confidence motion on June 29, 2022. Shinde subsequently formed a new coalition with the BJP and was sworn in as the Chief Minister on June 30, 2022. The case is currently being heard by the Supreme Court of India.\n\n**Party Structure and Caste Composition**\n\nThe Shiv Sena (SS) was led by a president, traditionally referred to as the \"Shiv Sena Pramukh\", (transl.

The party has also been accused of promoting a sense of intolerance and hatred towards certain communities.\n\n**Activities**\n\nThe Shiv Sena has been involved in various activities, including promoting Marathi culture, language, and identity.
