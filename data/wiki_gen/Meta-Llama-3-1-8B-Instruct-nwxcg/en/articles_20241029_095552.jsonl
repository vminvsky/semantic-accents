The path is a popular destination for cyclists, walkers, and joggers, and offers scenic views of the surrounding wetlands and wildlife.\n\n# Route\n\n## Airport\n\nThe Ballona Creek Bike Path begins at the Sepulveda Basin, near the Van Nuys Airport. From there, it runs northwest along the Ballona Creek and passes through the cities of Van Nuys, Panorama City, and Westchester. The path then enters the city of Los Angeles and continues along the creek, passing through the neighborhoods of Playa del Rey, Playa Vista, and Del Rey. The path ends at the Ballona Creek's mouth, where it empties into the Santa Monica Bay.\n\n## Airport Connection\n\nThere are several access points to the Ballona Creek Bike Path from the nearby airports. The Van Nuys Airport has a bike path that connects to the Ballona Creek Bike Path, and the Los Angeles International Airport has a bike path that runs along the airport's periphery, with several access points to the Ballona Creek Bike Path.\n\n# Conditions\n\n## Rest stops\n\nThere are several rest stops and picnic areas along the Ballona Creek Bike Path, where cyclists and walkers can take a break and rest their feet. These rest stops are equipped with benches, tables, and trash cans, and some have drinking fountains and restrooms. Some of the rest stops also have interpretive signs that provide information about the local wildlife and vegetation.\n\n## Homeless camping\n\nUnfortunately, the Ballona Creek Bike Path has experienced problems with homeless camping, particularly in the areas near the Sepulveda Basin and the Los Angeles International Airport. The city of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department have implemented measures to deter homeless camping, including increased patrols and the installation of fencing and gates to restrict access to the path.\n\n# Access gates\n\nThere are several access gates along the Ballona Creek Bike Path, which allow cyclists and walkers to enter and exit the path. These gates are typically locked during the night and are unlocked during the day. Some of the access gates are also equipped with electronic gates that can be opened with a keycard or a mobile app.\n\n# History\n\nThe Ballona Creek Bike Path was built in the 1990s, as part of a larger effort to create a network of bike paths and trails in the Los Angeles area. The path was designed to provide a safe and scenic route for cyclists and walkers, and to promote the use of alternative transportation. The path has undergone several improvements over the years, including the addition of new rest stops and the installation of new lighting and signage.\n\n# Improvements\n\nIn recent years, the city of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works have made several improvements to the Ballona Creek Bike Path. These improvements include the addition of new rest stops and picnic areas, the installation of new lighting and signage, and the repair of damaged sections of the path. The city has also implemented measures to reduce the risk of flooding along the path, including the installation of new storm drains and the creation of a flood control plan.\n\n# Proposed extensions\n\nThere are several proposed extensions to the Ballona Creek Bike Path, including a proposed extension to the Marina del Rey area and a proposed extension to the Venice Beach area. These extensions would provide additional scenic views of the surrounding wetlands and wildlife, and would promote the use of alternative transportation.\n\n# Gallery\n\n* Image of the Ballona Creek Bike Path at sunset\n* Image of a rest stop along the Ballona Creek Bike Path\n* Image of a homeless encampment along the Ballona Creek Bike Path\n* Image of an access gate along the Ballona Creek Bike Path\n* Image of a section of the Ballona Creek Bike Path in the Sepulveda Basin\n\n# See also\n\n* Ballona Creek\n* Sepulveda Basin\n* Van Nuys Airport\n* Los Angeles International Airport\n* Los Angeles County Department of Public Works\n* City of Los Angeles\n\n# References\n\nThis article does not include any references.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Ballona_Creek_Bike_Path\" following this outline:\n\n#Route\n##Airport\n#Conditions\n##Rest stops\n##Homeless camping\n#Access gates\n#History\n#Improvements\n#Proposed extensions\n#Gallery\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The massive seismic event caused widespread destruction, resulting in thousands of deaths and injuries, and leaving many more homeless.\n\n# Tectonic setting\n\n## Geology\n\nThe region affected by the earthquakes is located in the Eastern Anatolian Fault Zone (EAFZ), a major fault that runs for over 1,000 km through eastern Turkey and northern Syria. The EAFZ is a transform fault that accommodates the northward movement of the Arabian Plate relative to the Eurasian Plate. The region has a long history of seismic activity, with several major earthquakes occurring in the past, including the 1879 Gökçedağ earthquake and the 1976 Kavırçay earthquake.\n\n## Seismicity\n\nThe area is considered a seismically active region, with a high likelihood of future earthquakes. The EAFZ is a complex fault system that includes several sub-faults, including the Gökçedağ Fault and the Kavırçay Fault. These faults are thought to be responsible for the majority of the seismic activity in the region.\n\n# Earthquake sequence\n\n## Aftershocks\n\nThe 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquakes were preceded by a series of smaller earthquakes, including a magnitude 5.6 event on January 30, 2023. This event was followed by a series of aftershocks, including a magnitude 4.8 event on February 5, 2023. The mainshock, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake, struck at 04:17 local time on February 6, 2023, followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake at 13:24 local time.\n\n## Seismology\n\nThe earthquakes were characterized by a complex seismic waveform, indicating a long rupture duration. The epicenter of the mainshock was located in the southeastern province of Kahramanmaraş, while the epicenter of the second earthquake was located in the neighboring province of Elazığ.\n\n## Rupture propagation\n\nThe rupture propagation of the earthquakes was characterized by a northward direction, with the primary rupture zone extending for over 200 km.

He was a prominent member of the Factory, a gathering place for artists, musicians, and other creatives. Warhol's work was heavily influenced by the commercial art world, and he often incorporated elements of advertising and consumer culture into his art. The Campbell's Soup Cans series was a natural extension of this interest, as it celebrated the ubiquity and familiarity of the Campbell's brand.\n\n### Pop Art\n\nWarhol's work was a key moment in the development of pop art, a movement that emphasized the importance of popular culture and mass production. Pop art challenged the traditional notions of high art and sought to blur the line between fine art and commercial art. Warhol's Campbell's Soup Cans series was a prime example of this, as it took a mundane product and elevated it to the status of art.\n\n**Premiere**\n\n### Subsequent Publicity\n\nThe Campbell's Soup Cans series premiered in September 1962 at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles. The exhibition was a major success, and the series generated widespread publicity and attention. The use of familiar images and the banality of the subject matter helped to make the series accessible and engaging to a broad audience. The Campbell's Soup Cans series was a major breakthrough for Warhol, and it cemented his reputation as a leading figure in the pop art movement.\n\n**Campbell's Soup Company**\n\n### Can and Label History\n\nCampbell's Soup Company was founded in 1869 by Joseph A. Campbell and Abraham Anderson. The company's early products were canned soups, which quickly became popular due to their convenience and affordability. The company's iconic red and white can design was introduced in the early 20th century and has remained largely unchanged to this day. The Campbell's Soup Cans series features 32 different flavors of soup, each represented by a unique image on the can.\n\n### Relation to Warhol's Art\n\nThe Campbell's Soup Cans series was a natural extension of Warhol's interest in consumer culture and mass production. The use of familiar images and the banality of the subject matter helped to make the series accessible and engaging to a broad audience. The series also highlighted the commercialism and ubiquity of the Campbell's brand, which was a major theme in Warhol's art.\n\n**Inspiration**\n\n### Artist Colleagues\n\nWarhol was influenced by a number of artist colleagues, including Roy Lichtenstein and Jasper Johns. Lichtenstein's use of comic book images and Johns's use of everyday objects as subject matter both influenced Warhol's approach to the Campbell's Soup Cans series. Warhol's interest in pop culture and mass production was also influenced by his friendship with artist Edie Sedgwick, who often appeared in his films and was a key figure in the Factory.\n\n**Interpretation**\n\nThe Campbell's Soup Cans series can be interpreted in a number of ways, each reflecting the viewer's individual perspective. Some see the series as a commentary on the ubiquity and banality of consumer culture, while others view it as a celebration of the familiar and the mundane. The series can also be seen as a reflection of Warhol's fascination with the commercialism and mass production of everyday life.\n\n**Variations**\n\n### Campbell's Soup I and Campbell's Soup Cans II\n\nWarhol created two distinct versions of the Campbell's Soup Cans series: Campbell's Soup I and Campbell's Soup Cans II. Campbell's Soup I features 32 different images of Campbell's soup cans, each representing a different flavor of the company's product. Campbell's Soup Cans II features 10 different images of Campbell's soup cans, each representing a different flavor of the company's product.\n\n### Colored Soup Cans\n\nWarhol also created a series of colored soup cans, each featuring a different color scheme and design. These images were created using silkscreen printing and feature a range of bright, bold colors.\n\n### Unauthorized Versions\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, a number of unauthorized versions of the Campbell's Soup Cans series were created, often using Warhol's original images and designs. These versions were often created for commercial purposes and were intended to capitalize on the popularity of the original series.\n\n### Other Variations\n\nWarhol also created a number of other variations of the Campbell's Soup Cans series, including images of Campbell's soup cans in different sizes and configurations. These images were often created using silkscreen printing and feature a range of bold, bright colors.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Campbell's Soup Cans series is a quintessential example of pop art and a major landmark in the development of the movement. The series' emphasis on mass production, consumer culture, and the banality of everyday life helped to revolutionize the art world and paved the way for future generations of artists. The series remains a popular and iconic work of art to this day, and its influence can be seen in a wide range of artistic and cultural contexts.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Pop art\n* Andy Warhol\n* Campbell's Soup Company\n* Joseph A.

The mission was a critical step towards establishing a sustainable presence on the Moon and eventually sending humans to Mars.\n\n**Mission Profile**\n\nThe Artemis I mission profile was designed to test the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, the Orion spacecraft, and the lunar Gateway, a space station that will serve as a base for future missions to the Moon. The mission involved launching the Orion spacecraft on top of the SLS rocket, sending it on a lunar flyby, and then returning it to Earth for a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean.\n\n**Mission Profile Animation**\n\nThe mission profile animation, created by NASA, shows the trajectory of the Orion spacecraft as it travels from the Earth to the Moon and back again. The animation depicts the spacecraft's entry into lunar orbit, its lunar flyby, and its return to Earth for a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Artemis I mission was the first major test of the Artemis program, which was initiated in 2019. The program aims to return humans to the Moon by 2025 and establish a sustainable presence on the lunar surface. The mission was also a critical test of the SLS rocket, which is the most powerful rocket ever built by NASA.\n\n### Ground Testing\n\nGround testing of the Artemis I mission began in 2020, with the SLS rocket being assembled at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The Orion spacecraft was also assembled at the Kennedy Space Center, and the lunar Gateway was assembled at the Kennedy Space Center and at a facility in Alabama.\n\n### Assembly\n\nThe Artemis I spacecraft was assembled at the Kennedy Space Center, with the Orion spacecraft being stacked on top of the SLS rocket. The spacecraft was then integrated with the lunar Gateway, which was launched on a separate rocket.\n\n### Launch Preparations\n\nLaunch preparations for the Artemis I mission began in November 2022, with the SLS rocket being fueled with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. The Orion spacecraft was also fueled with a combination of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen.\n\n### Initial Launch Attempts\n\nThe Artemis I mission was initially scheduled to launch on November 14, 2022, but the launch was scrubbed due to technical issues with the SLS rocket. The launch was rescheduled for December 11, 2022, but it was again scrubbed due to technical issues. The launch was eventually rescheduled for January 16, 2023, and it was successful.\n\n**Flight**\n\nThe Artemis I mission launched on January 16, 2023, at 1:47 a.m. EST from the Kennedy Space Center. The Orion spacecraft was propelled by the SLS rocket to a distance of 280,000 miles from Earth, which is farther than any human-rated spacecraft has ever traveled before.\n\n### Launch\n\nThe launch of the Artemis I mission was a complex process that involved the ignition of the SLS rocket's four RS-25 engines and four Space Shuttle main engines. The rocket's solid rocket boosters were also ignited, and they provided additional thrust to the rocket.\n\n### Outbound Flight\n\nThe outbound flight of the Artemis I mission was a critical phase of the mission, during which the Orion spacecraft traveled to the Moon and performed a lunar flyby. The spacecraft was propelled by the SLS rocket, which provided a total of 2.2 million pounds of thrust.\n\n### Lunar Orbit\n\nThe Artemis I spacecraft entered lunar orbit on January 20, 2023, at 5:53 a.m. EST. The spacecraft remained in lunar orbit for approximately 20 minutes, during which time it performed a series of scientific experiments.\n\n### Return Flight\n\nThe return flight of the Artemis I mission began on January 20, 2023, at 6:13 a.m. EST, when the Orion spacecraft left lunar orbit and began its journey back to Earth. The spacecraft was propelled by the SLS rocket, which provided a total of 1.5 million pounds of thrust.\n\n### Reentry and Splashdown\n\nThe reentry of the Artemis I spacecraft into Earth's atmosphere was a critical phase of the mission, during which the spacecraft experienced extremely high temperatures and intense forces. The spacecraft successfully reentered the atmosphere and landed in the Pacific Ocean on January 25, 2023, at 6:42 a.m. EST.\n\n**Payloads**\n\nThe Artemis I mission carried a number of payloads, including a suite of scientific instruments and a number of cubesats. The cubesats were small satellites that were designed to test new technologies and perform a number of scientific experiments.\n\n### Cubesats\n\nThe cubesats that were launched on the Artemis I mission were designed to test new technologies and perform a number of scientific experiments. The cubesats were launched in a number of different configurations, including in a small satellite bus and in a compact satellite bus.\n\n**Media Outreach**\n\nThe Artemis I mission was covered extensively by the media, with a number of news outlets providing live coverage of the launch and the mission's progress. The mission was also covered by a number of social media platforms, including Twitter and Facebook.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Artemis program\n* Space Launch System\n* Orion spacecraft\n* Lunar Gateway\n* Cubesats\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The Artemis I mission was a critical test of the Artemis program and the SLS rocket.\n* The mission was a major step towards establishing a sustainable presence on the Moon.\n* The mission was also a critical test of the Orion spacecraft and the lunar Gateway.\n\n**References**\n\n* NASA.

The election was the 46th federal election in Australian history and the first to be held since the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe 2022 Australian federal election was a significant event in Australian politics, marked by a change in government from the Liberal Party of Australia to the Australian Labor Party (ALP). The election saw a number of key issues, including climate change, economic policy, and the COVID-19 pandemic, take center stage. The election was also notable for the high number of retiring members and the increased presence of independent candidates.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Previous election\n\nThe previous federal election was held on 18 May 2019, and resulted in the re-election of the Liberal-National coalition government, led by Prime Minister Scott Morrison.

The government was also criticized for its handling of various issues, including the response to the pandemic, the treatment of refugees, and the economy.\n\n### Change in party registration rules\n\nIn 2020, the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) introduced new rules for party registration, requiring parties to meet stricter criteria to be eligible to have candidates listed on the ballot paper. The changes were designed to reduce the number of minor parties and independents on the ballot paper.\n\n### Party preselection issues\n\nPrior to the election, there were a number of high-profile party preselection contests, including in the seat of Eden-Monaro, where a number of candidates were embroiled in scandal and controversy.\n\n### Independents\n\nThe 2022 election saw a number of high-profile independent candidates, including Zali Steggall, who had previously won the seat of Warringah, and Allegra Spender, who won the seat of Wentworth.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nThe Australian electoral system is based on a preferential voting system, where voters rank candidates in order of preference. The system is designed to ensure that the winner of the election is the candidate who has the support of the majority of voters.\n\n**State of electorates**\n\nThe Australian electoral system is designed to ensure that the number of voters in each electorate is roughly equal. However, some electorates have significantly more voters than others, due to factors such as population growth and urbanization.\n\n### Redistribution\n\nIn 2021, the Australian Electoral Commission undertook a redistribution of electoral boundaries, which resulted in the creation of new electorates and the abolition of others.\n\n### Election pendulum (House of Representatives)\n\nThe election pendulum is a tool used to predict the outcome of elections based on the polling of voters. In the lead-up to the 2022 election, the pendulum suggested that the ALP was likely to win a majority of seats in the House of Representatives.\n\n**Voter registration**\n\nVoter registration is an important aspect of the Australian electoral system, with eligible voters required to register to vote in order to participate in elections. In the lead-up to the 2022 election, there were concerns about voter registration, with some commentators suggesting that the online registration system was flawed.\n\n**Election date**\n\nThe election date was set for 21 May 2022, with the AEC announcing the date in April 2022.\n\n### Dissolution of parliament\n\nThe 46th Parliament was dissolved on 11 April 2022, with the

These clocks are considered the most accurate timekeeping devices in the world and have revolutionized the way we understand and measure time. In this article, we will explore the history of atomic clocks, their mechanics, and their applications.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe concept of atomic clocks dates back to the early 20th century, when physicists first began to understand the behavior of atoms. The discovery of the first atomic clock in the 1950s marked a significant milestone in the history of timekeeping. Since then, atomic clocks have become increasingly accurate and have played a crucial role in various fields, including science, navigation, and finance.\n\n**History**\n\n### Definition of the Second\n\nThe definition of the second is the fundamental unit of time in the International System of Units (SI). The second is defined as the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom. This definition was adopted in 1967 and has remained unchanged since then.\n\n### Metrology Advancements and Optical Clocks\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, significant advancements were made in the field of metrology, which is the science of measurement. The development of optical clocks, which use light to measure time, has led to a new generation of atomic clocks that are even more accurate than their microwave predecessors. Optical clocks have the potential to revolutionize various fields, including navigation, finance, and scientific research.\n\n### Chip-Scale Atomic Clocks\n\nIn recent years, there has been a significant increase in the development of chip-scale atomic clocks, which are small, portable devices that use atomic clocks to measure time. These clocks have the potential to be used in a wide range of applications, including navigation, timing, and synchronization.\n\n**Measuring Time with Atomic Clocks**\n\n### Clock Mechanism\n\nAtomic clocks use a mechanism to measure the vibrations of atoms. The most common type of atomic clock is the microwave atomic clock, which uses the vibrations of caesium atoms to measure time. The clock mechanism consists of a reservoir of caesium atoms, a cavity that contains the atoms, and a detector that measures the vibrations of the atoms.\n\n### Tuning and Optimization\n\nTo ensure accurate timekeeping, atomic clocks require regular tuning and optimization. This involves adjusting the frequency of the clock to match the standard frequency of the second. Atomic clocks also require periodic calibration to ensure that they remain accurate over time.\n\n**Accuracy**\n\nAtomic clocks are considered the most accurate timekeeping devices in the world. They can measure time with an accuracy of one second over tens of millions of years. This level of accuracy has a significant impact on various fields, including navigation, finance, and scientific research.\n\n**Comparing Atomic Clocks**\n\n### Time Standards\n\nAtomic clocks are used to establish time standards, which are essential for various applications, including navigation, finance, and scientific research. The most common time standard is the International Atomic Time (TAI), which is a weighted average of the time kept by over 200 atomic clocks around the world.\n\n### Synchronization with Satellites\n\nAtomic clocks are used to synchronize clocks on satellites, which is essential for navigation and communication systems. Satellites use atomic clocks to provide accurate time and frequency signals, which are used to synchronize clocks on the ground.\n\n### International Timekeeping\n\nAtomic clocks play a crucial role in international timekeeping. Countries use atomic clocks to establish their own time standards, which are often based on the TAI. The use of atomic clocks has facilitated international coordination and has enabled countries to share accurate time and frequency signals.\n\n### Fiber Optics\n\nAtomic clocks are used in fiber optic systems, which are essential for long-distance communication and navigation. Fiber optic systems use atomic clocks to provide accurate time and frequency signals, which are used to synchronize clocks and ensure accurate communication.\n\n**Microwave Atomic Clocks**\n\n### Caesium\n\nCaesium is the most common element used in microwave atomic clocks. The caesium clock mechanism consists of a reservoir of caesium atoms, a cavity that contains the atoms, and a detector that measures the vibrations of the atoms. The caesium clock is considered the most accurate type of microwave atomic clock.\n\n#### Block Diagram\n\nA block diagram of a caesium atomic clock is shown below:\n\n* Reservoir of caesium atoms\n* Cavity that contains the atoms\n* Detector that measures the vibrations of the atoms\n* Frequency generator that provides the reference frequency\n* Phase detector that measures the phase difference between the reference frequency and the clock frequency\n\n### Rubidium\n\nRubidium is another element used in microwave atomic clocks. The rubidium clock mechanism is similar to the caesium clock mechanism, but it uses rubidium atoms instead of caesium atoms.\n\n### Hydrogen\n\nHydrogen is also used in microwave atomic clocks. The hydrogen clock mechanism is different from the caesium and rubidium clock mechanisms, as it uses hydrogen atoms instead of caesium or rubidium atoms.\n\n**Other Types of Atomic Clocks**\n\n### Quantum Clocks\n\nQuantum clocks are a new generation of atomic clocks that use quantum effects to measure time. These clocks have the potential to be even more accurate than traditional atomic clocks.\n\n### Nuclear Clock Concept\n\nThe nuclear clock concept is a new approach to timekeeping that uses the vibrations of atomic nuclei to measure time. This approach has the potential to be even more accurate than traditional atomic clocks.\n\n**Potential for Redefining the Second**\n\n### Rydberg Constant\n\nThe Rydberg constant is a fundamental constant of physics that is used to define the second. The Rydberg constant is a measure of the energy of the radiation emitted by an atom when it transitions from one energy level to another.\n\n### Requirements\n\nTo redefine the second, a new measurement of the Rydberg constant is required. This measurement will involve the use of advanced atomic clocks and spectroscopy techniques.\n\n### Secondary Representations of the Second\n\nSecondary representations of the second are used to express time in a more convenient and precise way. These representations include the second, the minute, the hour, and the day.\n\n**Applications**\n\n### Global Navigation Satellite Systems\n\nGlobal navigation satellite systems (GNSS) use atomic clocks to provide accurate location and time information.

With a career spanning over six decades, Lewis has released numerous chart-topping hits, earning him multiple accolades and a place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJerr-Lee Lewis was born on September 29, 1935, in Ferriday, Louisiana, to Elmo and Mamie Lewis. He was the youngest of three children, and his family was deeply rooted in gospel music. Lewis's mother, a devout Christian, encouraged his siblings to sing in church, while his father, a farmer, played the guitar and sang folk songs. The family's musical environment instilled in Lewis a passion for music from an early age.\n\nGrowing up in a rural community, Lewis attended church regularly and developed a strong musical foundation. He began playing the piano at the age of four, learning to play by ear and soon becoming proficient in various styles, including gospel, country, and blues. Lewis's early musical influences included gospel singers such as Mahalia Jackson and The Golden Gate Quartet, as well as country and blues artists like Hank Williams and Little Richard.\n\n**Career**\n\n**J&M Studio**\n\nIn 1955, Lewis's family moved to Memphis, Tennessee, where he began performing at local clubs and bars. He soon gained attention from Sam Phillips, the owner of Sun Records, one of the first independent record labels in the United States. Phillips was impressed by Lewis's unique blend of rockabilly and gospel, and in 1956, he signed Lewis to a recording contract.\n\nUnder the guidance of Phillips and the studio's engineer, Jack Clement, Lewis recorded his debut single, \"Crazy Arms,\" at J&M Studio in Memphis. The song, a country-rockabilly fusion, failed to chart, but it laid the groundwork for Lewis's future success.\n\n**Sun Records**\n\nLewis's breakthrough came in 1957 with the release of \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On,\" a song written by Dave Williams and Jody Williams. The song's energetic and rebellious style captured the hearts of listeners, and it reached the top of the Billboard charts, staying there for eight weeks.\n\nOver the next few years, Lewis released a string of successful singles, including \"Great Balls of Fire\" and \"Breathless,\" which solidified his position as one of the leading figures in rock and roll.\n\n**Marriage Controversy**\n\nIn 1957, Lewis married his 13-year-old second cousin, Myra Gale Brown. The marriage sparked controversy due to the significant age difference and the fact that Brown was still a minor. The scandal damaged Lewis's career and led to a backlash from the public and the media.\n\nDespite the controversy, Lewis continued to perform and release music, and in 1958, he appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show, marking a significant moment in his career.\n\n**Smash Records**\n\nIn 1963, Lewis signed with Smash Records, a subsidiary of Mercury Records. Under the guidance of producer Shelby Singleton, Lewis released a string of country-rock crossover hits, including \"End of the Road\" and \"Another Place, Another Time.\" These songs showcased Lewis's ability to adapt to changing musical trends and further solidified his position as a versatile artist.\n\n**Live at the Star Club, Hamburg**\n\nIn 1964, Lewis embarked on a European tour, performing at various clubs and venues.

This article will explore the military history of Canada from pre-contact to the present day, highlighting key conflicts, battles, and events that have shaped the country's armed forces.\n\n**Warfare Pre-Contact**\n\nThe indigenous peoples of Canada, including the Inuit, First Nations, and Métis, had developed complex societies and engaged in various forms of warfare. These conflicts were often fought over resources, territory, and ideology. The earliest recorded conflicts date back to the 15th century, with the Ojibwa and Cree nations fighting each other over trade and territory.\n\n**European Contact**\n\nThe arrival of European colonizers in the 16th century marked a significant turning point in Canada's military history. The French and British competed for control of the continent, leading to a series of conflicts that would shape the country's future. The first major conflict between European colonizers and indigenous peoples was the Battle of Restigouche in 1760, where the French and their Mi'kmaq allies defeated a British force.\n\n**17th Century**\n\nThe 17th century saw the beginning of regular conflicts between European colonizers and indigenous peoples.

The conflict began in 1672, when the British conquered the Acadian capital of Port-Royal. The Acadians resisted the British occupation, leading to a series of brutal attacks and reprisals. The conflict finally came to an end in 1713, when the British seized control of the Acadian colony.\n\n**Anglo-Dutch Wars**\n\nThe Anglo-Dutch Wars, a series of conflicts fought between the British and the Dutch, had a significant impact on Canadian history.

The allegations were investigated by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the Australian Defence Force (ADF).\n\nInvestigation\n\nThe AFP and the ADF launched an investigation into the allegations, which included reviewing footage from body cameras worn by soldiers during the mission.

The game was contested by the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles, with the Chiefs emerging victorious by a score of 38-35. The event was one of the most highly anticipated and closely watched sporting events of the year, attracting a massive global audience.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Host selection\n\nThe host city for Super Bowl LVII was selected by the National Football League (NFL) in 2018. Phoenix, Arizona, was awarded the hosting rights after a competitive bidding process between several cities. State Farm Stadium, which serves as the home stadium of the Arizona Cardinals, was chosen as the venue for the game. The stadium underwent significant renovations in the lead-up to the event, including the installation of a new playing surface and upgrades to the seating and amenities.\n\n### Calls for location change\n\nPrior to the game, there were calls for the location of the event to be changed due to concerns over the Arizona heat and the potential impact on player safety. However, the NFL ultimately decided to proceed with the original plan, citing the stadium's air-conditioned facilities and the precautions in place to mitigate the effects of the heat.\n\n### Indigenous representation\n\nSuper Bowl LVII was notable for its significant indigenous representation, with several members of the host city's Native American communities playing key roles in the event. The game's halftime show, for example, featured a performance by indigenous musician and activist, Keith Secola, who sang the traditional Native American song \"Native American Prayer.\" Additionally, the NFL partnered with local Native American organizations to provide educational resources and promote awareness about indigenous issues.\n\n### Stadium playing surface\n\nState Farm Stadium's playing surface was a significant upgrade from previous Super Bowl venues. The stadium's surface was designed to provide optimal traction and safety for players, with a special type of turf that is resistant to wear and tear. The surface was also equipped with a state-of-the-art drainage system, which allowed for quick recovery between plays and minimized the risk of injuries.\n\n**Teams**\n\n### Kansas City Chiefs\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs entered Super Bowl LVII as the defending champions, having won the previous year's game in a thrilling comeback victory. The team was led by quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who had a reputation for making spectacular plays in high-pressure situations. The Chiefs' offense was known for its explosive potential, with a talented group of receivers and a dominant running back in Jamaal Williams.\n\n### Philadelphia Eagles\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles, on the other hand, were seeking their second Super Bowl title in franchise history. The team was led by quarterback Jalen Hurts, a young and dynamic player who had a strong season in 2022. The Eagles' defense was anchored by a talented group of pass rushers, including defensive end Brandon Graham and linebacker Fletcher Cox.\n\n### Playoffs\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles both entered the playoffs as division winners, with the Chiefs earning the #1 seed in the AFC and the Eagles earning the #1 seed in the NFC. Both teams navigated their respective conference playoffs with ease, with the Chiefs defeating the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Buffalo Bills, and the Eagles defeating the New York Giants and the San Francisco 49ers.\n\n### Pre-game notes\n\nIn the lead-up to the game, the NFL announced several pre-game festivities, including a concert by pop star, Taylor Swift, and a performance by the Grammy-winning band, U2. The event also featured a series of promotional activities, including a Super Bowl-themed float in the Rose Parade and a special edition of the NFL's popular video game, Madden NFL.\n\n**Broadcasting**\n\n### United States\n\nThe game was broadcast nationally in the United States by CBS, with play-by-play announcer Jim Nantz and color commentator Tony Romo calling the action. The broadcast was watched by an estimated 115 million viewers, making it one of the most-watched television events in history.\n\n### Advertising\n\nThe Super Bowl is known for its high-profile advertising, with several major brands shelling out millions of dollars for a 30-second spot. This year was no exception, with companies like Amazon, Google, and Pepsi airing elaborate and expensive commercials.\n\n### Ratings\n\nThe game's ratings were among the highest in Super Bowl history, with a 47.5% share of the viewing audience. The game's average viewership was up 10% from the previous year's game.\n\n### Streaming\n\nThe game was also streamed online through various platforms, including the NFL's official app and YouTube.

The album was initially intended as a more upbeat and experimental project, but SZA eventually shifted her focus towards a more introspective and emotionally charged sound.

Other notable tracks on the album include \"Snooze,\" \"Low,\" and \"Gone Girl.\" The album's lyrics explore themes of love, heartbreak, and self-discovery, with SZA drawing on her own experiences with relationships and mental health.\n\n**Title and artwork**\n\nThe title of the album, SOS, is emblazoned on the cover art in bold, distressed font, with a red background that references the emergency signal. The artwork features SZA standing in a dark, abstract environment, surrounded by images of flowers and other natural elements. The cover art has been praised for its striking design and symbolism.\n\n**Promotion**\n\nSZA promoted SOS through a series of interviews and performances, including a appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in November 2022. The album's lead single, \"Kill Bill,\" was also used in a variety of promotional materials, including billboards and social media ads. SZA has stated that she plans to support the album with a tour in 2023.\n\n**Critical reception**\n\n**Reviews**\n\nSOS has received widespread critical acclaim, with many reviewers praising SZA's vocal performance and the album's production. The album has been praised for its introspective and emotionally charged sound, as well as its exploration of themes such as mental health and self-discovery.

The event was held from April 2 to 10, 2022, in Basel, Switzerland.\n\n# Qualification\n\nThe qualification process for the 2022 World Men's Curling Championship consisted of several criteria. The top five teams from the 2021 World Men's Curling Championship qualified automatically, while the next six teams were determined by the World Curling Federation's (WCF) ranking system. The host nation, Switzerland, also qualified as the seventh team.\n\n## Russian Participation\n\nDue to the ongoing 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Russian curling team was initially suspended by the WCF. However, following a meeting of the WCF Council, the Russian team was allowed to compete, but under a neutral flag and as \"Team ROC\" (Russian Olympic Committee). The decision was made after the WCF received assurances from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) that the Russian team would not be allowed to compete under the Russian flag or with any Russian branding.\n\n# Teams\n\nA total of 13 teams competed in the 2022 World Men's Curling Championship. The teams were:\n\n1.  Canada\n2.  China\n3.  Denmark\n4.  Germany\n5.  Italy\n6.  Japan\n7.  Norway\n8.  Russia (Team ROC)\n9.  Scotland\n10.  South Korea\n11.  Sweden\n12.  Switzerland\n13.  United States\n\n# Rule Changes\n\nThe 2022 World Men's Curling Championship introduced several rule changes. One of the notable changes was the introduction of a \"hammer throw\" rule, which allowed the winning team of the previous end to throw the first stone in the next end. This rule change was designed to promote more aggressive curling and to increase the chances of a comeback in the game.\n\n# Round-robin standings\n\nThe round-robin standings for the 2022 World Men's Curling Championship were as follows:\n\n1.  Sweden (9-2)\n2.  Scotland (8-3)\n3.  Canada (8-3)\n4.  Switzerland (7-4)\n5.  Norway (7-4)\n6.  United States (6-5)\n7.  Denmark (6-5)\n8.  South Korea (5-6)\n9.  Germany (5-6)\n10.

The election was the 25th general election since the end of World War II and the first under the revised electoral system introduced in 2022.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Löfven's government\n\nThe 2018 general election saw the Social Democrats, led by Stefan Löfven, return to power after a four-year period in opposition. The election resulted in a minority government, with the Social Democrats forming a coalition with the Green Party. This marked the first time a Green Party minister had been included in a Swedish government. Löfven's government focused on issues such as climate change, taxation, and healthcare reform.\n\nHowever, Löfven's government faced numerous challenges, including opposition from the centre-right parties and criticism from some within the Social Democrats. In June 2019, Löfven's government lost a no-confidence vote in parliament, prompting him to resign as prime minister. However, he was later re-elected as leader of the Social Democrats and formed a new government with the Green Party and the Centre Party.\n\n### Andersson's government\n\nIn 2021, Löfven announced his intention to resign as leader of the Social Democrats and as prime minister. Magdalena Andersson, the Minister of Finance, was elected as the new leader of the Social Democrats. Andersson formed a new government with the Green Party and the Centre Party, becoming the first female prime minister of Sweden in her own right.\n\nHowever, Andersson's government was short-lived, as she faced opposition from the centre-right parties and criticism from some within the Social Democrats. In July 2022, Andersson's government lost a no-confidence vote in parliament, prompting her to resign as prime minister. This led to a snap general election being called for September 2022.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nThe 2022 general election was held under the revised electoral system introduced in 2022. The system consists of a mixed-member proportional representation system, where 349 members of the Riksdag are elected.

Social Democrats and Green Party forming the main opposition.\n\n**Campaign**\n\nThe 2022 general election campaign was marked by a number of key issues, including:\n\n* **Climate change**: the

The show is a survival program where a group of trainees compete against each other to debut as a member of a boy group. The program is produced by CJ E&M and is a spin-off of the popular show I-Land.\n\n# Concept and format\n\nThe concept of Boys Planet is centered around a competition where a group of trainees, known as \"trainees,\" compete against each other to debut as a member of a boy group. The show features a unique voting system where viewers, a panel of judges, and a group of trainees known as the \"Team Leaders\" vote for their favorite trainees to determine who will debut.\n\n## Voting system\n\nThe voting system in Boys Planet is a key aspect of the show. Viewers can vote for their favorite trainees through the Wave app, while the judges and Team Leaders vote based on the trainees' performances in the episodes. The votes are then combined to determine the ranking of the trainees. The trainees with the lowest number of votes are at risk of elimination each week, while the trainees with the highest number of votes are considered safe from elimination.\n\n# Promotion and broadcast\n\nBoys Planet was heavily promoted before its premiere, with various teasers and trailers released on social media and the Wave app. The show premiered on January 6, 2022, and was broadcast on Mnet every Thursday at 9:00 PM KST. The show was also available to stream on the Wave app and other streaming platforms.\n\n## Broadcast schedule\n\nThe broadcast schedule for Boys Planet is as follows:\n\n* January 6, 2022: Episode 1 (premiere)\n* January 13, 2022: Episode 2\n* January 20, 2022: Episode 3\n* January 27, 2022: Episode 4\n* February 3, 2022: Episode 5\n* February 10, 2022: Episode 6\n* February 17, 2022: Episode 7\n* February 24, 2022: Episode 8\n* March 3, 2022: Episode 9 (semi-final)\n* March 10, 2022: Episode 10 (final)\n\n# Cast\n\nThe cast of Boys Planet includes a group of trainees from various entertainment agencies and a panel of judges.

Located on the western coast of the island, Lahaina was once the capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii and a major hub for whaling and trade in the 19th century.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nLahaina is a historic town with a rich cultural heritage, known for its vibrant arts and cultural scene, stunning natural beauty, and significant historical landmarks. The town's strategic location on the island's western coast made it an important center for trade, commerce, and tourism, earning it the nickname \"The Pioneer Capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii.\" Today, Lahaina is a popular tourist destination, attracting visitors from around the world who come to experience its unique blend of history, culture, and natural beauty.\n\n**History**\n\n### Name\n\n#### Modern name, etymology and pronunciations\n\nLahaina's modern name is derived from the Hawaiian language, with \"Lahaina\" meaning \"cruel\" or \"merciless\" in Hawaiian. However, the town's original name was \"Lele,\" which means \"to place of gathering\" or \"to seat.\" Over time, the name \"Lahaina\" became the commonly used term, and it is pronounced as \"LA-hah-nee-ah\" in Hawaiian and \"LA-hay-nah\" in English.\n\n#### Ancient names\n\nBefore the arrival of European explorers, Lahaina was known as \"Kaluakai,\" which translates to \"seaboard\" or \"shore\" in Hawaiian. This name reflects the town's strategic location on the western coast of Maui and its importance as a major hub for trade and commerce.\n\n### Early rulers\n\nLahaina's early history dates back to the 12th century, when it was a small fishing village inhabited by the ancient Polynesian people. The town's location made it an ideal spot for fishing and trade, and it soon became an important center for the island's early rulers. The first ruler to establish a presence in Lahaina was the ali'i (chief) Kiha, who ruled over the area in the 13th century.\n\n### Western contact\n\n#### Kahekili II\n\nIn 1778, the British explorer James Cook arrived in Hawaii, and Lahaina became one of the first towns to be encountered by European explorers. The town's ruler at the time, King Kahekili II, was a shrewd leader who quickly grasped the potential of European trade and technology. Under his rule, Lahaina became a major hub for trade and commerce, with European ships arriving regularly to exchange goods such as iron, copper, and cloth for Hawaiian goods like sandalwood and fish.\n\n#### Kamehameha I and Kamehameha II\n\nIn 1782, King Kamehameha I, the founder of the Kingdom of Hawaii, arrived in Lahaina, and the town became an important center for his kingdom. Kamehameha I established a new capital at Honolulu, but Lahaina remained a major hub for trade and commerce. Under his rule, the town's population grew rapidly, and it became one of the largest towns on the island.\n\n#### Christian missionaries\n\nIn 1820, a group of Christian missionaries arrived in Lahaina, and the town became a major center for the spread of Christianity in Hawaii. The missionaries established a school, a hospital, and a church, and they worked closely with the island's rulers to convert the native population to Christianity. The missionaries also played a significant role in the abolition of the Hawaiian custom of human sacrifice, which had been practiced in the islands for centuries.\n\n#### Whaling\n\nIn the early 19th century, Lahaina became a major hub for the whaling industry, with many whaling ships arriving regularly to hunt whales in the surrounding waters. The town's wharves were filled with whale oil, bone, and other products, and the town's economy boomed as a result of the whaling industry.\n\n#### Kamehameha III\n\nIn 1824, King Kamehameha III ascended to the throne, and Lahaina continued to grow as a major center for trade and commerce. The king established a new capital at Honolulu, but Lahaina remained an important town, with a thriving economy and a significant population.\n\n#### 20th century\n\nIn the 20th century, Lahaina continued to grow as a tourist destination, with many visitors arriving to experience the town's rich history, cultural landmarks, and natural beauty. The town's economy diversified, with a growing emphasis on tourism, arts, and culture.\n\n### 2023 wildfire\n\nIn June 2023, a devastating wildfire swept through Lahaina, destroying several homes and businesses and forcing thousands of residents to evacuate. The fire was eventually brought under control, but not before causing significant damage to the town's infrastructure and economy.\n\n**Geography**\n\nLahaina is located on the western coast of Maui, in the state of Hawaii, United States. The town is situated on a narrow strip of land between the ocean and the West Maui Mountains, making it an ideal spot for trade and commerce.

The town's population is diverse, with a mix of Native Hawaiians, Asian Americans, and European Americans.

Established in 1986 by Eric Escoffier, the award has been presented annually since 1987, with the exception of a few years.\n\n# History\n\nThe Piolets d'Or was created to acknowledge the contributions of mountaineers to the sport and to promote the values of adventure, exploration, and risk-taking that define mountaineering. The award is given to individuals or teams who have made significant contributions to the development of new routes, the exploration of new territories, or the improvement of existing routes.\n\n## Multiple Winners\n\nThe Piolets d'Or has been awarded to multiple winners on several occasions. In 2013, the award was given to every member of the Piolets d'Or jury, in recognition of their tireless efforts to promote the sport and honor the achievements of mountaineers. In 2015, the award was pre-announced, with the winner being announced at a later date.\n\n# Criteria\n\nThe criteria for the Piolets d'Or are strict and well-defined. The award is given to individuals or teams who have made significant contributions to the development of new routes, the exploration of new territories, or the improvement of existing routes. The Piolets d'Or jury, which consists of experienced mountaineers and experts in the field, reviews the nominations and selects the winner(s) based on their achievements and contributions to the sport.\n\n# Reception\n\nThe Piolets d'Or has been widely recognized and respected within the mountaineering community. The award is seen as a testament to the achievements of mountaineers and a recognition of the risks and challenges they face. However, the award has not been without controversy, with some critics arguing that it is too focused on individual achievements and does not adequately recognize the contributions of teams or the broader mountaineering community.\n\n## Criticism\n\nOne of the criticisms of the Piolets d'Or is that it is too focused on individual achievements and does not adequately recognize the contributions of teams or the broader mountaineering community.

It existed from the 16th to the 18th centuries, playing a significant role in the complex history of the region. The Banat of Craiova was a territory that witnessed numerous conquests, resistance movements, and cultural developments, leaving a lasting impact on the region's identity.\n\n**History**\n\n### **Austrian Conquest**\n\nThe Banat of Craiova was first conquered by the Austrian Empire in 1718, as a result of the Austro-Turkish War. The Austrians sought to expand their territory and gain control over the strategic region. The conquest marked the beginning of a new chapter in the region's history, as the Austrians introduced their administrative and economic systems, which would shape the development of the region for centuries to come.\n\n### **Government Creation**\n\nFollowing the conquest, the Austrians created a new administrative structure for the region, dividing it into several districts and appointing officials to govern them. The Banat of Craiova was established as a distinct administrative unit, with its capital in the city of Craiova. The Austrian government aimed to modernize the region, introducing new laws, taxes, and infrastructure projects. The creation of a centralized government marked a significant shift in the region's political landscape, as the Austrians sought to exert their control over the local population.\n\n### **Boyar and Peasant Resistance**\n\nThe Austrian conquest and the establishment of a new government did not go unchallenged. The local boyar class, as well as the peasant population, resisted the Austrian rule, seeking to maintain their traditional rights and privileges. The boyars, who had long enjoyed a privileged position in the region, resisted the Austrian attempts to impose their own administrative and economic systems. The peasants, who made up the bulk of the population, also resisted the new taxes and labor obligations imposed by the Austrians. The resistance movement was characterized by a mix of armed uprisings, petitions, and negotiations with the Austrian authorities.\n\n### **Austrian Consolidation**\n\nDespite the resistance, the Austrians managed to consolidate their control over the region. They introduced new laws and institutions, such as the Banat's land registry, which ensured the transfer of land ownership from the boyars to the Austrian state. The Austrians also promoted the development of trade and commerce, establishing new markets and roads that connected the region to the rest of the empire. The consolidation of Austrian control marked a significant turning point in the region's history, as the Austrians established a lasting presence in the Banat of Craiova.\n\n### **Ottoman Reconquest**\n\nIn 1739, the Banat of Craiova was reconquered by the Ottoman Empire, marking the end of Austrian rule in the region. The Ottomans had long sought to regain control over the region, which had been lost to the Austrians two decades earlier. The reconquest was a significant blow to the Austrians, who had invested heavily in the region's development. The Ottomans, on the other hand, sought to restore their traditional institutions and administrative systems, which had been disrupted by the Austrian conquest.\n\n**Legacy**\n\n### **\"Colonial\" Precedent**\n\nThe Banat of Craiova played a significant role in the broader history of the region, serving as a precedent for later colonial and imperial conquests. The Austrian conquest and the subsequent creation of a new administrative structure set a model for later European powers, who sought to impose their own systems and institutions on the local population. The Banat of Craiova's legacy can be seen in the many other regions that were conquered and colonized by European powers in the centuries that followed.\n\n### **Cultural Survivals**\n\nDespite the numerous conquests and changes in administration, the Banat of Craiova retained many of its cultural traditions and institutions. The region's unique cultural identity, shaped by the interactions between the local population, the boyars, and the various imperial powers, continued to evolve and thrive. The Banat of Craiova's cultural survivals can be seen in the many festivals, customs, and traditions that are still celebrated in the region today.\n\n**Symbols**\n\nThe Banat of Craiova's legacy is also reflected in its symbols, which have been adopted by the region's inhabitants over the centuries. The region's coat of arms, which features a lion and a crescent moon, is a testament to its complex history and cultural identity. The lion represents the region's strength and courage, while the crescent moon symbolizes its connection to the Ottoman Empire and the Islamic world.\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe Banat of Craiova's history is a complex and multifaceted one, marked by numerous conquests, resistance movements, and cultural developments. The region's legacy continues to shape the identity and traditions of the local population, who remain proud of their unique cultural heritage.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Banat_of_Craiova\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Austrian conquest\n##Government creation\n##Boyar and peasant resistance\n##Austrian consolidation\n##Ottoman reconquest\n#Legacy\n##\"Colonial\" precedent\n##Cultural survivals\n#Symbols\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The scandal led to the downfall of the UMNO-led government and the eventual collapse of the PH coalition.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nMalaysia uses a first-past-the-post electoral system, where candidates are elected based on the number of votes received in each constituency. The country is divided into 222 parliamentary constituencies, each represented by a member of parliament. The electoral system is governed by the Election Commission of Malaysia, which is responsible for regulating the electoral process and ensuring the integrity of the elections.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n### Dissolution of parliament\n\nOn 10 October 2022, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King of Malaysia) dissolved the parliament, paving the way for the general election.\n\n### Dissolution of state legislatures\n\nOn 14 October 2022, the state legislatures were also dissolved, marking the start of the election campaign.\n\n### Pre-nomination events\n\nPrior to the election, several parties and candidates faced nomination challenges, including the contest for the presidency of the Malaysian Trades Union Congress (MTUC).\n\n### Timetable\n\nThe election timetable was as follows:\n\n* 10 October 2022: Parliament dissolved\n* 14 October 2022: State legislatures dissolved\n* 23 October 2022: Nomination day\n* 26 October 2022: Campaign period begins\n* 19 November 2022: Election day\n\n**Last election pendulum**\n\nThe last election pendulum, released by the Malaysian Election Commission, predicted that the PH coalition would win 92 seats, while the UMNO-led Perikatan Nasional (PN) coalition would win 104 seats.\n\n**Political parties and candidates**\n\n### Parties represented in current legislatures\n\nThe following parties were represented in the current legislatures:\n\n* Pakatan Harapan (PH)\n* Perikatan Nasional (PN)\n* Barisan Nasional (BN)\n* Parti Amanah Negara (Amanah)\n* Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS)\n* Parti Sosialis Malaysia (PSM)\n* Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia (Gerakan)\n* Democratic Action Party (DAP)\n* Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu)\n* Parti Bangsa Malaysia (PBM)\n\n### Extra-parliamentary parties\n\nSeveral extra-parliamentary parties also contested in the election, including:\n\n* Parti Demokratik Malaysia (PDM)\n* Parti Sarawak Bersatu (PSB)\n* Parti Maju Sabah (PMS)\n* Parti Maju Malaysia (PMM)\n\n### Nominated candidates\n\nA total of 637 candidates were nominated for the election, including 368 from the PH coalition, 199 from the PN coalition, and 70 from the BN coalition.\n\n**Campaign**\n\n### Timing of election\n\nThe election campaign period began on 26 October 2022, and ended on 18 November 2022.\n\n### Youth vote\n\nYoung voters played a significant role in the election, with many candidates engaging with Generation Z and millennials on social media platforms.\n\n**Outgoing members of parliament**\n\nA total of 222 members of parliament were elected in the 2018 general election, including 94 from the PH coalition, 68 from the BN coalition, and 60 from the PN coalition.\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nSeveral opinion polls were conducted in the lead-up to the election, predicting varying outcomes.\n\n**Results**\n\n### By alliance\n\nThe final results were as follows:\n\n* PH: 82 seats\n* PN: 92 seats\n* BN: 30 seats\n* Amanah: 11 seats\n* PAS: 23 seats\n* PSM: 0 seats\n* Gerakan: 0 seats\n* DAP: 42 seats\n* Bersatu: 31 seats\n* PBM: 2 seats\n\n### By parliamentary seats\n\nThe PH coalition won 82 parliamentary seats, while the PN coalition won 92 seats.
