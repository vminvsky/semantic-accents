Past winners of the award include some of the league's greatest players, including Wollongong Football Club's Paul O'Keefe, who won the award a record five times.\n\n**Leading Goalkicker**\n\nThe South West Football League also awards a leading goalkicker award to the player who kicks the most goals in the league each year.

It is one of the most well-preserved and iconic steam locomotives in the United States, known for its striking appearance and rich history.\n\n**Design and Abilities**\n\nThe Class J locomotive was designed by N&W engineer Louis A. Mayfield and built by the N&W's own locomotive shops. The 611 is a 4-8-4 Articulated locomotive, meaning it has four leading wheels, eight driving wheels, and four trailing wheels. This design allows for greater stability and maneuverability, particularly when hauling heavy loads at high speeds.\n\nThe 611 has a maximum speed of 120 miles per hour (193 km/h) and is powered by a 2,300-horsepower (1,700 kW) light oil-fired boiler. It has a total weight of 530 tons (483 t) and is 118 feet 2 inches (36.02 m) long. The locomotive has a large firebox and a 15-ton (13.6 t) coal bunker, allowing it to burn coal or oil as fuel.\n\n**History**\n\nThe 611 was built in 1950 as part of N&W's effort to modernize its steam locomotive fleet. It was assigned to the Powhatan Arrow passenger train, which ran between Norfolk, Virginia, and Chicago, Illinois. The locomotive quickly gained a reputation for its speed, power, and reliability, earning the nickname \"Powhatan Arrow.\"\n\n### Revenue Service\n\nThe 611 spent 11 years in revenue service, hauling the Powhatan Arrow and other passenger trains across the N&W system. It was known for its smooth riding and quiet operation, making it a favorite among passengers. During this time, the locomotive hauled some of the heaviest and longest trains on the N&W, including a 154-car train that weighed over 14,000 tons.\n\n### First Retirement\n\nIn 1961, the N&W began to retire its steam locomotives in favor of diesel and electric power. The 611 was one of the first locomotives to be retired, and it was stored in the N&W's Roanoke shops. Although the locomotive was still in good condition, it was deemed surplus and was eventually sold to a private owner.\n\n### First Mainline Excursion Service\n\nIn 1974, the 611 was purchased by the Norfolk Southern Railway (NS) and restored to operating condition. It was used for mainline excursion service, running on various railroads across the United States. The locomotive hauled excursions on the Appalachian Railway, the B&O Railroad, and the Pennsylvania Railroad, among others.\n\nDuring this time, the 611 hauled some of the largest and most elaborate excursion trains in the country. These trains featured elaborate passenger cars, often with restored or replica equipment from the 1920s to the 1950s. The locomotive became a beloved fixture on the excursion circuit, known for its speed and power.\n\n### Second Retirement\n\nIn 1986, the NS retired the 611 from mainline excursion service, citing maintenance costs and decreasing ridership. The locomotive was stored in the NS's Chattanooga shops, where it remained for several years.\n\n### Second Mainline Excursion Service\n\nIn 1997, the 611 was sold to the Virginia Museum of Transportation, which had been operating a mainline excursion service using the locomotive.

The election was the sixth presidential and parliamentary election in Serbia since the country's independence from Yugoslavia in 2006.\n\nThe election was marked by a number of significant events and developments, including a constitutional referendum, environmental protests, and a highly contested campaign. This article provides an overview of the background to the election, the electoral system, and the key parties and candidates involved.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Inter-party dialogues on electoral conditions\n\nIn the months leading up to the election, the main opposition parties in Serbia engaged in a series of inter-party dialogues aimed at reaching a consensus on the electoral conditions. The dialogues, which were facilitated by the European Union, focused on issues such as the electoral code, the composition of the electoral commission, and the role of international observers.\n\nHowever, the talks ultimately failed to produce a consensus, and the opposition parties decided to boycott the election in protest at the government's refusal to make concessions on key issues.\n\n### Constitutional referendum\n\nIn 2020, the Serbian government held a constitutional referendum, which was widely seen as an attempt to consolidate the power of the ruling party. The referendum, which was held on May 16, 2020, proposed a number of changes to the constitution, including the abolition of the post of prime minister and the introduction of a more presidential system of government.\n\nThe referendum was marked by low turnout and widespread allegations of irregularities, including vote-buying and coercion.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the United States saw a significant increase in activism and advocacy for reproductive rights, leading to the passage of several state laws that decriminalized abortion. The landmark case of _Roe v. Wade_ (1973) further solidified the right to an abortion, establishing a woman's constitutional right to choose whether to carry a pregnancy to term.\n\n### Constitutional right\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision in _Roe v. Wade_ recognized a woman's right to choose as a fundamental right protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court established a trimester framework, which gave women a right to an abortion during the first trimester, subject to certain regulations during the second trimester, and prohibited most abortions during the third trimester. This framework was later modified in _Planned Parenthood v. Casey_ (1992), which introduced an undue burden standard, allowing states to impose regulations on abortion as long as they did not create an undue burden on the woman's right to choose.\n\n### Evolution of the composition of the Supreme Court\n\nOver the years, the Supreme Court's composition has undergone significant changes, with several justices retiring or passing away. As of 2020, the Court had a conservative majority, with six justices appointed by Republican presidents and three justices appointed by Democratic presidents. The changing composition of the Court has led to concerns about the future of reproductive rights and the potential for the Court to overturn or modify existing precedents.\n\n**Gestational Age Act**\n\nThe Jackson Women's Health Organization case centered on a Mississippi law known as the Gestational Age Act, which banned most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The law was enacted in 2018 and was challenged by Jackson Women's Health Organization, a clinic that provided abortion services in Mississippi. The clinic argued that the law was unconstitutional and would cause irreparable harm to its patients.\n\n### Lower courts\n\nThe case was first heard in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi, which ruled that the law was unconstitutional because it conflicted with the undue burden standard established in _Planned Parenthood v. Casey_. The decision was appealed to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the lower court's ruling. The state appealed to the Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case.\n\n**Supreme Court**\n\n### Oral argument\n\nThe oral argument in _Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization_ took place on December 1, 2021. During the argument, the justices posed questions to the attorneys representing the state and the clinic, focusing on the constitutionality of the Gestational Age Act and the implications of the law for women's reproductive rights.\n\n### Leaked draft opinion\n\nIn early May 2022, a leaked draft opinion from Justice Samuel Alito revealed that the Court was poised to overturn _Roe v. Wade_ and the undue burden standard established in _Planned Parenthood v. Casey_. The leak sparked widespread outrage and protests, with many condemning the decision as a threat to women's rights and reproductive autonomy.\n\n### Reactions\n\nThe leak of the draft opinion sparked intense reactions from politicians, activists, and ordinary citizens. Many politicians and activists condemned the decision, arguing that it would have devastating consequences for women's health and well-being. Others expressed support for the decision, citing concerns about fetal rights and the potential for abortion to be used as a form of population control.\n\n### Investigation\n\nThe leak of the draft opinion led to an investigation by the Department of Justice, which sought to identify the source of the leak. The investigation was sparked by concerns about the security of the Court's internal documents and the potential for leaks to have a significant impact on the Court's decision-making process.\n\n**Opinions**\n\n### Majority opinion\n\nOn June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court issued its decision in _Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization_. In a 6-3 majority opinion, the Court overturned _Roe v. Wade_ and the undue burden standard established in _Planned Parenthood v. Casey_. The majority opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito, held that the Constitution does not confer a right to an abortion and that the decision to regulate abortion should be left to the states.\n\n### Concurrences\n\nThe majority opinion was joined by Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett, and John Roberts. The concurrences offered various justifications for the decision, including concerns about fetal rights, the potential for abortion to be used as a form of population control, and the need for states to regulate abortion in order to promote public health and safety.\n\n### Concurrence in judgment\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor issued a concurrence in judgment, arguing that the majority opinion was not only wrong but also unjust. Sotomayor argued that the Court had abandoned its commitment to precedent and had instead chosen to impose its own will on the country.\n\n### Dissent\n\nJustice Elena Kagan issued a dissenting opinion, arguing that the majority opinion was a significant departure from precedent and a threat to women's rights and reproductive autonomy. Kagan argued that the Court had a duty to protect the constitutional rights of women and that it had failed to do so in this case.\n\n**Impact**\n\n### Pre-decision\n\nPrior to the Supreme Court's decision in _Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization_, abortion laws were governed by a patchwork of state and federal regulations. Some states had laws that restricted access to abortion, while others had laws that protected women's reproductive rights.\n\n### Post-decision\n\nThe decision in _Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization_ has had significant implications for the country's abortion landscape. Many states have enacted laws that restrict access to abortion, while others have enacted laws that protect women's reproductive rights. The decision has also sparked a new wave of activism and advocacy for reproductive rights, with many organizations and individuals working to protect women's access to abortion.\n\n### State laws restricting abortion\n\nSince the decision in _Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization_, several states have enacted laws that restrict access to abortion. These laws include bans on abortion after a certain number of weeks, requirements that women undergo counseling or waiting periods before obtaining an abortion, and restrictions on the types of clinics that can provide abortion services.\n\n#### EMTALA and federal preemption\n\nThe decision in _Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization_ has also raised questions about the intersection of state laws and federal regulations governing abortion. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires hospitals to provide emergency medical care, including abortion, in certain circumstances. However, some states have enacted laws that conflict with EMTALA, raising concerns about federal preemption and the potential for conflicts between state and federal laws.\n\n### State laws expanding abortion access\n\nDespite the challenges posed by state laws restricting access to abortion, several states have enacted laws that protect women's reproductive rights. These laws include laws that protect access to abortion, laws that require insurance coverage for abortion, and laws that protect the right to travel for abortion.\n\n### Congressional proposals\n\nIn response to the decision in _Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization_, Congress has proposed several bills aimed at protecting women's reproductive rights. These bills include the Women's Health Protection Act, which would protect access to abortion, and the Equality Act, which would prohibit discrimination based on sex, including in the context of reproductive health.\n\n### Executive action by President Biden\n\nPresident Biden has taken several executive actions in response to the decision in _Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization_. These actions include requiring the Department of Health and Human Services to promote access to abortion and requiring the Department of Justice to protect the rights of women seeking abortion.\n\n### Medical abortion, in vitro fertilization, and other processes\n\nThe decision in _Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization_ has also raised questions about the intersection of abortion and other reproductive health issues. Medical abortion, in vitro fertilization, and other processes may be affected by the decision, and advocates are working to ensure that women's access to these services is protected.\n\n### Data privacy\n\nThe decision in _Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization_ has also raised concerns about data privacy and the potential for women's reproductive health information to be shared with the government or other entities. Advocates are working to protect women's access to abortion and to ensure that their reproductive health information is kept confidential.\n\n### 2022 and 2024 United States election seasons\n\nThe decision in _Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization_ has also had significant implications for the 2022 and 2024 United States election seasons. Many politicians have made reproductive rights a central issue in their campaigns, and advocates are working to ensure that women's access to abortion is protected.\n\n### Effects on abortion rates\n\nThe decision in _Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization_ has also raised questions about the potential effects on abortion rates. Some advocates have argued that the decision will lead to an increase in abortion rates, while others have argued that it will lead to a decrease. The actual effects on abortion rates will depend on a variety of factors, including the specific laws enacted by states and the availability of abortion services.\n\n### Effects on infant mortality\n\nThe decision in _Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization_ has also raised questions about the potential effects on infant mortality. Some advocates have argued that the decision will lead to an increase in infant mortality rates, while others have argued that it will lead to a decrease. The actual effects on infant mortality rates will depend on a variety of factors, including the specific laws enacted by states and the availability of prenatal care and other maternal health services.\n\n**Reaction**\n\n### Legal journalists\n\nThe decision in _Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization_ has received extensive coverage from legal journalists. Many have argued that the decision is a significant departure from precedent and a threat to women's rights and reproductive autonomy.

Jackson Women's Health Organization_ has also had significant implications for politics. Many politicians have made reproductive rights a central issue in their campaigns, and advocates are working to ensure that women's access to abortion is protected.

The game was an exhibition match to raise funds for the Australian troops serving in World War I.\n\n**Origin**\n\nThe idea for the game was conceived by Sir John Monash, a prominent Australian engineer and military leader who was serving as the General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the Third Australian Division. Monash was a strong advocate for the importance of sport in the lives of soldiers and believed that it had a positive impact on their morale and overall well-being. He saw the potential for a charity football match to bring the community together and raise funds for the troops.\n\n**Planning**\n\nMonash's views on the value of sport were well-known, and he was approached by the Melbourne Football Club to host the game. The club was eager to participate in the match and was willing to donate its services to raise funds for the troops. Monash accepted the proposal and began to plan the event.\n\n**Participants**\n\nThe match was to be played between two teams: the Third Australian Divisional Squad and the Australian Training Units Squad. The Third Australian Divisional Squad was comprised of soldiers who were serving in the Third Australian Division, while the Australian Training Units Squad was made up of soldiers who were undergoing training at the time. Both teams were selected by Monash, who was keen to ensure that the match was competitive and enjoyable for spectators.\n\n**Promotion**\n\nPromotion for the game began several weeks before the match, with posters and advertisements appearing around Melbourne. The event was widely publicized in the local press, and the Melbourne Football Club was instrumental in promoting the game. Monash was also involved in promoting the event, and he was keen to ensure that it was a success.\n\n**The Official Programme**\n\nThe official programme for the game was a 16-page booklet that detailed the teams, team lists, and match officials.

The protests were primarily centered in Ottawa and involved a large convoy of truckers and other vehicles that aimed to disrupt the city and pressure the government to lift COVID-19 vaccination mandates and restrictions.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe protest was sparked by the Canadian government's decision to introduce vaccination mandates and passports for cross-border travel, which required truckers and other travelers to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 in order to enter the country. Many truckers and other protesters felt that these measures were an overreach of government power and an infringement on their personal freedoms.\n\n### Protest goals\n\nThe primary goals of the protest were to:\n\n*   Pressure the Canadian government to lift vaccination mandates and restrictions\n*   Challenge the authority of the government to impose these measures\n*   Raise awareness about the impact of COVID-19 policies on businesses and individuals\n\n### Initial events and the start of the protest\n\nThe protest was initially sparked by a group of truckers who organized a convoy to travel to Ottawa and deliver a petition to the Canadian government.

His crimes, which involved the rape and murder of at least 21 young men and boys, shocked the nation and led to a major overhaul of the California justice system.\n\nEarly life\n\nChildhood\nWilliam Bonin was born on January 8, 1947, in Los Angeles, California. His father, who was a retired naval officer, was reportedly abusive and violent. Bonin's mother, who was a homemaker, was described as cold and distant. The family moved frequently during Bonin's childhood, often living in low-income housing projects.\n\nAdolescence\nBonin attended high school in Southern California, where he was reportedly a loner and a bully. He was arrested several times for vandalism and assault, but was never held accountable for his actions. After dropping out of high school, Bonin enlisted in the United States Air Force, where he was stationed in California and served from 1964 to 1967.\n\nEngagement and U.S. Air Force\nBonin met his first wife, a woman named Barbara, while he was still in the Air Force. The couple had a son, but Bonin's abusive behavior and infidelity led to the breakdown of their marriage. After leaving the Air Force, Bonin married again, but this relationship also ended in divorce.\n\nFirst convictions\nBonin's first conviction came in 1967, when he was arrested for grand theft auto. He served 18 months in prison, but was released early on parole. In 1970, Bonin was arrested for assault with a deadly weapon, but the charges were dropped due to lack of evidence.\n\nIncarceration at Atascadero and Vacaville prison\nBonin was sentenced to 2 years in prison for the assault charge, but was released after serving only 18 months. He was then sentenced to 2 years in prison for a separate charge of rape, but was released after serving only 1 year. During this time, Bonin was treated at Atascadero State Hospital for his mental health issues, but was deemed to be a low-risk patient and was released back into the community.\n\nFurther offenses and imprisonment\nIn 1975, Bonin was arrested for kidnapping and rape, but the charges were dropped due to lack of evidence. In 1978, Bonin was arrested for a separate charge of kidnapping and rape, and was sentenced to 2 years in prison. However, he was released after serving only 6 months, due to a technicality in the law.\n\nRelease\nBonin was released from prison in 1978, and began to pick up where he had left off before his incarceration. He quickly became involved in a new relationship, this time with a woman named Deborah. However, this relationship also ended in disaster, with Bonin becoming increasingly violent and abusive.\n\nAcquaintance with Vernon Butts and Gregory Miley\nWhile Bonin was in prison, he had become acquainted with two other men, Vernon Butts and G", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"William_Bonin\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n##Childhood\n##Adolescence\n##Engagement and U.S. Air Force\n#First convictions\n#Incarceration at Atascadero and Vacaville prison\n##Further offenses and imprisonment\n#Release\n##Acquaintance with Vernon Butts and Gregory Miley\n#Murders\n##1979\n###May\n###August\n###September through December\n##1980\n###January and February\n###March\n###April\n###May\n###June\n#Arrest\n##Confession\n##Accomplices' arrest\n#Preliminary hearings\n#Murder trials\n##Los Angeles County\n###Closing arguments\n###Conviction\n###Sentencing\n##Orange County\n###Second conviction\n#Death row\n##Appeals\n#Execution\n#Aftermath\n#Known victims\n##1979\n##1980\n#Media\n##Film\n##Bibliography\n##Television\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Cited works and further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The shortage, which began in February 2022, was caused by a combination of factors, including supply chain issues, recall and plant shutdown, import restrictions, and market concentration. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the causes, effects, responses, and commentary related to the infant formula shortage.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe infant formula shortage was caused by a combination of factors, including:\n\n### **Supply chain issues**\n\nThe infant formula shortage was exacerbated by supply chain issues, which had been ongoing for several years. The COVID-19 pandemic had disrupted global supply chains, leading to shortages of raw materials and transportation delays. Additionally, the increased demand for infant formula due to the pandemic had put pressure on manufacturers, leading to stockouts and delays.\n\n### **Recall and plant shutdown**\n\nIn February 2022, the FDA recalled millions of units of infant formula produced by Abbott Nutrition due to contamination concerns. The recall was triggered by reports of babies becoming sick after consuming Abbott's formula. As a result, the company shut down its Sturgis, Michigan, plant, which was the only facility producing formula for Abbott in the United States.\n\n#### **Alleged problems at Sturgis plant**\n\nThe shutdown of the Sturgis plant was due to alleged problems with quality control and manufacturing practices. Inspectors had found contamination concerns, including the presence of Cronobacter sakazakii, a bacteria that can cause severe illness in infants. The FDA had issued a warning letter to Abbott in November 2021, citing concerns about the plant's quality control and manufacturing practices.\n\n### **Import restrictions**\n\nThe U.S. government imposed import restrictions on infant formula in an effort to address the shortage. The FDA issued a guidance document outlining the requirements for importation of infant formula, which included requirements for labeling, packaging, and quality control. The restrictions were intended to ensure the safety and quality of imported formula.\n\n### **Market concentration**\n\nThe infant formula market in the United States is highly concentrated, with a few large manufacturers dominating the market. This concentration has been criticized for limiting competition and driving up prices. The shortage highlighted the need for greater competition and diversity in the market.\n\n**Effects**\n\nThe infant formula shortage had significant effects on families and infants across the United States.\n\n## **Sale and donation of breast milk**\n\nThe shortage led to an increase in the sale and donation of breast milk. Many families turned to breast milk banks and online marketplaces to purchase or donate breast milk. However, the demand for breast milk far exceeded supply, leading to concerns about the safety and quality of breast milk being sold or donated.\n\n## **Use of alternative foods**\n\nFamilies affected by the shortage turned to alternative foods, including cow's milk and soy-based formulas. However, these alternatives may not be suitable for all infants, and some families reported difficulty in finding suitable alternatives.\n\n## **Hospitalizations**\n\nThe shortage led to an increase in hospitalizations due to infant formula-related illnesses. According to reports, many hospitals experienced shortages of infant formula, leading to delays in treatment and increased costs.\n\n## **Bot usage**\n\nThe shortage led to an increase in online sales of infant formula, with some sellers using bots to purchase and resell formula at inflated prices. This activity has been criticized for price gouging and exploiting vulnerable families.\n\n## **Shortage in Canada**\n\nThe infant formula shortage also affected Canada, where many families reported difficulty in finding formula. The Canadian government implemented measures to address the shortage, including import restrictions and increased production.\n\n**Responses**\n\nThe U.S. government and manufacturers responded to the infant formula shortage in various ways.\n\n## **Efforts to prevent price gouging**\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and state attorneys general launched investigations into price gouging and online sales of infant formula. The FTC also issued guidance to online marketplaces and sellers to prevent price gouging.\n\n## **Efforts to increase supply**\n\nThe U.S. government implemented measures to increase the supply of infant formula, including importing formula from other countries and authorizing the use of emergency funds to support manufacturers.\n\n## **Efforts to restore production**\n\nThe FDA worked with manufacturers to restore production at the Sturgis plant and other facilities. The agency also implemented measures to improve quality control and manufacturing practices.\n\n## **Investigations**\n\nMultiple investigations were launched to investigate the causes of the shortage and the response of manufacturers and government agencies.\n\n### **Congressional investigation**\n\nThe House Committee on Oversight and Reform launched an investigation into the shortage, focusing on the role of manufacturers, the FDA, and government agencies.\n\n### **FDA investigation**\n\nThe FDA launched an investigation into the Sturgis plant and the manufacturing practices of Abbott Nutrition.\n\n### **ABC News investigation**\n\nABC News conducted an investigation into the online sales of infant formula and the use of bots to purchase and resell formula.\n\n### **DOJ investigation**\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) launched an investigation into price gouging and online sales of infant formula.\n\n**Commentary**\n\nThe infant formula shortage has sparked debate and commentary on various issues.\n\n## **Breast milk vs. formula debate**\n\nThe shortage has reignited the debate about breast milk versus formula, with some advocates arguing that breast milk is the best option for infants, while others argue that formula is a suitable alternative.\n\n## **Criticism of federal response**\n\nThe federal response to the shortage has been criticized for being slow and inadequate. Some have argued that the government should have taken more aggressive action to address the shortage and prevent price gouging.\n\n### **White House response**\n\nThe White House has defended the federal response to the shortage, arguing that the government took swift action to address the crisis and prevent price gouging.\n\n### **Formula availability at the Southern border**\n\nThe shortage has highlighted the need to address the availability of infant formula at the Southern border, where many families rely on formula due to breastfeeding challenges.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_United_States_infant_formula_shortage\" following this outline:\n\n#Causes\n##Supply chain issues\n##Recall and plant shutdown\n###Alleged problems at Sturgis plant\n##Import restrictions\n##Market concentration\n#Effects\n##Sale and donation of breast milk\n##Use of alternative foods\n##Hospitalizations\n##Bot usage\n##Shortage in Canada\n#Responses\n##Efforts to prevent price gouging\n##Efforts to increase supply\n##Efforts to restore production\n##Investigations\n###Congressional investigation\n###FDA investigation\n###ABC News investigation\n###DOJ investigation\n#Commentary\n##Breast milk vs. formula debate\n##Criticism of federal response\n###White House response\n###Formula availability at the Southern border\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is best known for his numerous record-breaking swims in Lake Ontario, as well as his successful crossing of the Catalina Channel.\n\n**Early Swimming Achievements**\n\nYoung's early life and swimming career are not well-documented, but it is known that he began training for long-distance swimming in his late teens. He was drawn to the sport due to the influence of other Canadian swimmers, who were making headlines for their record-breaking swims.\n\n### **Catalina Swim Training**\n\nIn the early 1920s, Young traveled to California to train with the Catalina Swim Club, a renowned group of long-distance swimmers. Under the guidance of experienced coaches and swimmers, Young honed his skills and built his endurance, preparing himself for the challenges of swimming long distances in open water. His training was rigorous, with sessions often lasting several hours a day, and included swimming with fins, paddles, and other equipment to build strength and endurance.\n\n**Catalina Channel Swim**\n\nYoung's most notable achievement was his successful crossing of the Catalina Channel, a 21-mile stretch of water between the California mainland and the island of Catalina. This swim was considered one of the most difficult in the world at the time, due to the strong currents and tides that made the swim extremely challenging.\n\n### **Swam with Tides**\n\nYoung's approach to the swim was innovative for the time. He chose to swim with the tides, using the currents to his advantage to conserve energy and speed up his progress. This approach allowed him to cover the distance in a relatively short period of time, and he completed the swim in an impressive 14 hours and 39 minutes.\n\n### **Competition from Norman Ross**\n\nYoung's achievement was soon matched by Norman Ross, a fellow Canadian swimmer who had also been training in California. Ross completed the Catalina Channel swim in an impressive 14 hours and 14 minutes, just 25 minutes faster than Young's time. This set up a rivalry between the two swimmers, with each pushing the other to achieve greater distances and times.\n\n### **Public Acclaim, with Limited Financial Gain**\n\nDespite his impressive achievement, Young's success was met with limited financial gain. He received some public acclaim and recognition, but the prize money for the swim was relatively small. This was a common issue for long-distance swimmers at the time, with many competing in events that offered little in terms of financial reward. Young's focus on the sport was driven by a passion for swimming, rather than a desire for financial gain.\n\n**Inconsistent Swimming Career**\n\nYoung's swimming career was marked by inconsistency, with periods of intense training and competition followed by periods of inactivity. This was due to a combination of factors, including injuries, illness, and personal issues. Despite his best efforts, Young was unable to sustain a consistent level of performance throughout his career.\n\n### **1927, 21-Mile Lake Ontario Swim**\n\nOne of Young's most notable swims was his 21-mile crossing of Lake Ontario in 1927. This swim was considered one of the most difficult in the world at the time, due to the strong currents and tides that made the swim extremely challenging. Young completed the swim in an impressive 13 hours and 30 minutes, earning him widespread recognition and acclaim.\n\n### **1928, 15-Mile Lake Ontario Swim**\n\nIn 1928, Young returned to Lake Ontario to attempt another record-breaking swim. This time, he completed a 15-mile crossing of the lake in an impressive 10 hours and 30 minutes. This achievement cemented Young's reputation as one of the world's leading long-distance swimmers.\n\n### **Wins Sept 1928 Montreal to Repentigney Marathon**\n\nLater in 1928, Young competed in the Montreal to Repentigney Marathon, a 20-mile swim across the St. Lawrence River. He completed the swim in an impressive 12 hours and 45 minutes, winning the event and earning further recognition for his achievements.\n\n### **1929, 15-mile Lake Ontario Swim**\n\nIn 1929, Young returned to Lake Ontario to attempt another record-breaking swim. This time, he completed a 15-mile crossing of the lake in an impressive 10 hours and 45 minutes. This achievement marked the third time Young had completed a 15-mile swim in Lake Ontario, cementing his reputation as one of the world's leading long-distance swimmers.\n\n### **1930, 15-mile Lake Ontario Swim**\n\nIn 1930, Young competed in another 15-mile swim in Lake Ontario, completing the event in an impressive 11 hours and 15 minutes. This achievement marked the fourth time Young had completed a 15-mile swim in Lake Ontario, further solidifying his reputation as one of the world's leading long-distance swimmers.\n\n### **Wins 1931 Lake Ontario win**\n\nIn 1931, Young competed in a 15-mile swim in Lake Ontario, completing the event in an impressive 10 hours and 45 minutes. This achievement marked the fifth time Young had completed a 15-mile swim in Lake Ontario, cementing his reputation as one of the world's leading long-distance swimmers.\n\n**Late Swim Career**\n\nYoung's late swim career was marked by a decline in performance, due to a combination of factors including injuries, illness, and personal issues. Despite his best efforts, Young was unable to sustain a consistent level of performance throughout his career.\n\n**Swim Retirement and Marriage**\n\nYoung retired from professional swimming in the early 1930s, and went on to marry his wife, a woman named Mary. Little is known about Young's personal life after his retirement from swimming, but it is believed that he settled down and started a family.\n\n### **Marriages**\n\nYoung married twice, first to Mary, and then to a woman named Helen. Little is known about Young's first marriage, but it is believed that he and Mary had one child together. Young's second marriage, to Helen, was more successful, and the couple went on to have several children together.\n\n**Late Professional Life**\n\nAfter his retirement from swimming, Young went on to work in a variety of different roles, including as a coach and a teacher. He continued to be involved in the sport of swimming, and was a vocal advocate for the importance of promoting swimming as a healthy and enjoyable activity for people of all ages.\n\n**Honors**\n\nYoung's achievements as a long-distance swimmer were recognized with a number of honors and awards. He was inducted into the Canadian Swimming Hall of Fame in 1978, and was awarded the Order of Canada in 1981 for his contributions to the sport of swimming.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Catalina Channel\n* Lake Ontario\n* Canadian Swimming Hall of Fame\n* Order of Canada\n\n**References**\n\n* (Note: No references are provided as this article is written in a neutral, encyclopedic tone and does not require citations or references to support its content.)\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Canadian Swimming Hall of Fame\n* Order of Canada\n* Catalina Channel Swimming Federation", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"George_Young_(swimmer)\" following this outline:\n\n#Early swimming achievements\n##Catalina swim training\n#Catalina channel swim\n##Swam with tides\n##Competition from Norman Ross\n##Public acclaim, with limited financial gain\n#Inconsistent swimming career\n##1927, 21-Mile Lake Ontario swim\n##1928, 15-Mile Lake Ontario swim\n##Wins Sept 1928 Montreal to Repentigney Marathon\n##1929, 15-mile Lake Ontario swim\n##1930, 15-mile Lake Ontario swim\n##Wins 1931 Lake Ontario win\n##Late swim career\n#Swim retirement and marriage\n##Marriages\n#Late professional life\n#Honors\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film is loosely based on the true story of a bear that ingested a large quantity of cocaine in 1985, and the subsequent events that unfolded. The film stars Keri Russell, Margo Martindale, O'Shea Jackson Jr., and Christian Convery.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place in the 1980s and follows the story of a group of people who become stranded in the woods after their plane crashes. The group, which includes a woman named Allison (played by Keri Russell), a park ranger named Bob (played by Margo Martindale), and a young boy named Eddie (played by Christian Convery), must survive the harsh wilderness and the dangers that come with it.\n\nAs they navigate the woods, they stumble upon a large quantity of cocaine that has been left behind by a group of smugglers. The group decides to take some of the cocaine and bring it back to their camp, but they soon realize that they have made a grave mistake. The cocaine is highly addictive, and soon the group becomes consumed by its effects.\n\nMeanwhile, a bear (played by Raynor Scheine) who has been sniffing out the cocaine in the forest becomes increasingly aggressive and begins to attack the group. The bear's behavior becomes more and more erratic, and the group must find a way to stop it before it's too late.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Keri Russell as Allison\n* Margo Martindale as Bob\n* O'Shea Jackson Jr. as Delroy\n* Christian Convery as Eddie\n* Raynor Scheine as the Bear\n* Alden Ehrenreich as Andrew\n* Jesse Tyler Ferguson as Dave\n* Kristofer Hivju as Roger\n* Brooklynn Prince as Sari\n\n**Inspiration**\n\nThe film is loosely based on the true story of a bear that ingested a large quantity of cocaine in 1985.

The acquisition, which was finalized in October 2022, saw Musk, the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, acquire Twitter for a total of $44 billion. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the acquisition process, from Elon Musk's initial offer to the finalization of the deal.\n\n**Prelude**\n\n### Background\n\nTwitter, founded in 2006, was a leading social media platform with over 440 million monthly active users. The platform was known for its real-time updates, where users could share short messages, known as tweets, with their followers. Twitter's popularity had grown exponentially over the years, making it a key player in the social media landscape.\n\n### Early Developments\n\nIn the months leading up to the acquisition, Twitter was facing increased competition from other social media platforms, including Facebook and Instagram.

On May 13, 2022, Musk announced that he was reconsidering his bid, citing concerns over the prevalence of spam and fake accounts on the platform. Musk claimed that Twitter's management had lied about the number of bots on the platform, which could impact the company's valuation.\n\n### Attempted Withdrawal by Musk\n\nOn July 8, 2022, Musk announced that he was terminating his takeover bid, citing Twitter's failure to provide sufficient information about the number of bots on the platform. The move sent Twitter's stock price plummeting, with the company's market value falling by over 10%.\n\n**Revival and Closing**\n\n### Revitalization of Bid\n\nOn July 12, 2022, Musk announced that he was reviving his takeover bid, stating that he was willing to proceed with the acquisition if Twitter's management agreed to provide the necessary information about the platform's bots. The move was seen as a significant development, as it marked a reversal of Musk's previous decision to terminate the bid.\n\n### Completion of Purchase\n\nOn October 27, 2022, Musk completed the acquisition of Twitter, purchasing the company for a total of $44 billion. The deal marked a significant milestone in the history of the tech industry, with many analysts praising Musk's bold and strategic play. The acquisition of Twitter has significant implications for the social media landscape, with many experts predicting that the platform will undergo significant changes under Musk's leadership.\n\n**Post-acquisition**\n\nThe acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk has significant implications for the social media landscape. Musk has promised to take a more hands-on approach to the platform, with a focus on improving the user experience and reducing the spread of misinformation. The acquisition has also raised concerns about the impact on free speech and the role of social media platforms in shaping public discourse.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### Takeover Bid\n\nThe takeover bid was met with a mixed reaction from investors and analysts.

These acts played a significant role in shaping the British military and naval establishments, and their impact can still be seen today.\n\n# Background\n\nThe concept of mutiny has existed throughout history, with the first recorded instance dating back to ancient Greece. However, the modern concept of mutiny as we understand it today began to take shape during the 17th century in England. The English Civil War and the subsequent Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 saw significant changes in the military and naval establishments, leading to the need for new laws to regulate behavior.\n\nIn 1661, the first Mutiny Act was passed, providing a framework for the prosecution of mutiny and desertion. The act was aimed at preventing the spread of sedition and ensuring the loyalty of military and naval personnel to the Crown. Over the next century, the act was renewed and amended several times, with significant changes made in 1690, 1694, and 1714.\n\n# Passage of the first Mutiny Act\n\nThe first Mutiny Act was passed on December 14, 1661, just over a year after the Restoration of the monarchy. The act was a response to the significant changes in the military and naval establishments following the English Civil War. The act made it a felony for military and naval personnel to conspire against the Crown, and provided for the prosecution of mutiny and desertion.\n\nThe act was aimed at preventing the spread of sedition and ensuring the loyalty of military and naval personnel to the Crown. It also established the principle of martial law, which allowed for the trial of military and naval personnel by court-martial rather than by civil courts.\n\n# Renewal of the Mutiny Acts\n\nThe Mutiny Act of 1661 was renewed and amended several times over the next century. In 1690, the act was amended to make it a felony for military and naval personnel to conspire against the Crown, and to provide for the prosecution of mutiny and desertion.\n\nIn 1694, the act was further amended to provide for the trial of military and naval personnel by court-martial in cases of mutiny and desertion.

This amendment was significant, as it established the principle of loyalty as a requirement for military and naval personnel.\n\n# The Quartering Acts\n\nThe Quartering Acts were a series of laws passed in the 17th and 18th centuries to regulate the housing and accommodation of military and naval personnel. The first Quartering Act was passed in 1662, and was aimed at providing for the accommodation of military and naval personnel in times of peace.\n\nThe Quartering Act of 1662 provided for the billeting of military and naval personnel in the homes of local inhabitants, and established a system of rent and compensation for the use of these homes. This act was significant, as it established the principle of billeting as a means of providing accommodation for military and naval personnel.\n\nThe Quartering Act of 1691 further amended the earlier act, and provided for the billeting of military and naval personnel in times of war. This amendment was significant, as it established the principle of billeting as a means of providing accommodation for military and naval personnel in times of conflict.\n\n# List\n\n## England\n\nThe Mutiny Act of 1661 was passed in England, and was aimed at regulating the behavior of military and naval personnel in the English military and naval establishments.\n\n## Great Britain\n\nThe Mutiny Act of 1690 was passed in Great Britain, and was aimed at regulating the behavior of military and naval personnel in the British military and naval establishments.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nThe Mutiny Act of 1714 was passed in the United Kingdom, and was aimed at regulating the behavior of military and naval personnel in the British military and naval establishments.\n\n### 1800s\n\nThe Mutiny Act of 1803 was passed in the United Kingdom, and was aimed at regulating the behavior of military and naval personnel in the British military and naval establishments.

The outbreak occurred on November 4 and 5, 2022, and was characterized by a large number of tornadoes touching down in a relatively short period of time.\n\n# Meteorological Synopsis\n\nThe outbreak was the result of a complex low-pressure system that developed over the southern Great Plains. A strong cold front moved eastward from the Rocky Mountains, colliding with a stationary front over the southern Plains. This collision led to the development of a strong low-pressure system, which intensified as it moved eastward. The system was fueled by a strong jet stream, which provided the necessary lift for the development of thunderstorms.\n\nThe low-pressure system interacted with a strong dry line, which stretched from the Texas Panhandle to the southern Oklahoma plains. The combination of the low-pressure system and the dry line created an environment conducive to severe thunderstorms, including tornadoes.\n\n# Confirmed Tornadoes\n\n## November 4 Event\n\nThe first tornadoes touched down on November 4, 2022, in the late afternoon and early evening hours. The National Weather Service (NWS) reported a total of 15 tornadoes that touched down on this day. The tornadoes were primarily located in Texas and Oklahoma, with the majority of them being rated as either EF1 or EF2.\n\nSome of the notable tornadoes that occurred on November 4 include:\n\n* A long-lived EF2 tornado that touched down in Archer County, Texas, and traveled 22 miles before dissipating.\n* A EF1 tornado that touched down in Montague County, Texas, and caused significant damage to several homes.\n* A EF2 tornado that touched down in Bryan County, Oklahoma, and caused extensive damage to several businesses.\n\n## November 5 Event\n\nThe second day of the outbreak was even more intense, with a total of 25 tornadoes reported by the NWS. The tornadoes were again primarily located in Texas and Oklahoma, with several tornadoes touching down in the Texas Panhandle and southern Oklahoma.\n\nSome of the notable tornadoes that occurred on November 5 include:\n\n* A long-lived EF3 tornado that touched down in Grayson County, Texas, and traveled 30 miles before dissipating.\n* A EF2 tornado that touched down in Sherman, Texas, and caused significant damage to several homes.\n* A EF1 tornado that touched down in Durant, Oklahoma, and caused minor damage to several homes.\n\n## Brookston–Caviness–Midcity–Arthur City, Texas/Sawyer, Oklahoma\n\nOne of the most significant tornadoes of the outbreak occurred in the Brookston–Caviness–Midcity–Arthur City, Texas/Sawyer, Oklahoma area. This tornado was rated as an EF3 and touched down on November 5, 2022. The tornado caused extensive damage to several homes and businesses, with several homes being completely destroyed. The tornado was reported to have traveled 15 miles before dissipating.\n\n## Bogota–Clarksville–Acworth, Texas/Idabel–Broken Bow–Eagletown, Oklahoma\n\nAnother significant tornado occurred in the Bogota–Clarksville–Acworth, Texas/Idabel–Broken Bow–Eagletown, Oklahoma area. This tornado was rated as an EF2 and touched down on November 5, 2022. The tornado caused significant damage to several homes and businesses, with several homes being partially destroyed. The tornado was reported to have traveled 10 miles before dissipating.\n\n## Cason–Naples, Texas\n\nA tornado touched down in the Cason–Naples, Texas area on November 5, 2022, and was rated as an EF1. The tornado caused minor damage to several homes, with a few homes being partially damaged. The tornado was reported to have traveled 5 miles before dissipating.\n\n## Simms–New Boston, Texas\n\nA tornado touched down in the Simms–New Boston, Texas area on November 5, 2022, and was rated as an EF2. The tornado caused significant damage to several homes and businesses, with several homes being partially destroyed. The tornado was reported to have traveled 10 miles before dissipating.\n\n# Non-Tornadic Effects\n\nIn addition to the tornadoes, the low-pressure system and dry line combination also produced a significant amount of rain and hail. The rain caused flash flooding in several areas, with several roads becoming impassable. The hail caused significant damage to several homes and vehicles, with several vehicles being damaged beyond repair.\n\n# Impact\n\nThe Tornado Outbreak of November 4–5, 2022, had a significant impact on the communities affected by the tornadoes. Several homes and businesses were destroyed or damaged, with many people being left without power or water. The outbreak also caused significant disruptions to daily life, with several roads becoming impassable and several schools being closed.\n\nThe economic impact of the outbreak was also significant, with several businesses being forced to close due to the damage caused by the tornadoes. The total cost of the damage was estimated to be in the millions of dollars.\n\n# See Also\n\n* List of tornado outbreaks in the United States\n* Tornado Alley\n* Great Plains\n* Texas Panhandle\n* Southern Oklahoma\n\n# Notes\n\n* The National Weather Service (NWS) reported a total of 40 tornadoes during the outbreak.\n* The tornadoes were primarily located in Texas and Oklahoma, with several tornadoes touching down in the Texas Panhandle and southern Oklahoma.\n* The outbreak was the result of a complex low-pressure system that developed over the southern Great Plains.\n* The low-pressure system interacted with a strong dry line, which stretched from the Texas Panhandle to the southern Oklahoma plains.\n* The combination of the low-pressure system and the dry line created an environment conducive to severe thunderstorms, including tornadoes.\n\n# References\n\nNone\n\n# External Links\n\n* National Weather Service: Tornado Outbreak of November 4–5, 2022\n* Weather Underground: Tornado Outbreak of November 4–5, 2022\n* AccuWeather: Tornado Outbreak of November 4–5, 2022", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tornado_outbreak_of_November_4–5,_2022\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological synopsis\n#Confirmed tornadoes\n##November 4 event\n##November 5 event\n##Brookston–Caviness–Midcity–Arthur City, Texas/Sawyer, Oklahoma\n##Bogota–Clarksville–Acworth, Texas/Idabel–Broken Bow–Eagletown, Oklahoma\n##Cason–Naples, Texas\n##Simms–New Boston, Texas\n#Non-tornadic effects\n#Impact\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is the sequel to the 1986 film Top Gun and stars Tom Cruise reprising his role as Captain Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film follows Maverick, now a decorated test pilot and flight instructor, who is recalled to the Top Gun program to train a new generation of fighter pilots for a top-secret mission. Maverick is tasked with leading a team of elite pilots on a high-stakes mission to destroy a uranium enrichment facility in an undisclosed country, which poses a threat to global security.\n\nAs Maverick and his team prepare for the mission, they face a series of challenges, including the death of a comrade and the emotional toll of the mission on the pilots and their families. Maverick also reconnects with his former Radar Intercept Officer (RIO) and love interest, Charlotte \"Charlie\" Harper (played by Jennifer Connelly), who is now a single mother.\n\nThe mission requires Maverick and his team to fly the F/A-18 Hornet and execute a low-altitude, low-speed bombing run, which is a complex and high-risk maneuver. The film's climax features an intense aerial dogfight and a dramatic bombing run, showcasing the pilots' skills and the aircraft's capabilities.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Tom Cruise as Captain Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell\n* Miles Teller as Lieutenant Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw\n* Jennifer Connelly as Charlotte \"Charlie\" Harper\n* Jon Hamm as Vice Admiral Cyclone\n* Glen Powell as Lieutenant Jake \"Hangman\" Seresin\n* Lewis Pullman as Lieutenant Robert \"Bob\" Floyd\n* Ed Harris as Admiral Jon Cummings\n* Lewis Pullman as Lieutenant Robert \"Bob\" Floyd\n* Monica Barbaro as Lieutenant Natasha \"Phoenix\" Trace\n* Jay Ellis as Lieutenant Mike \"Viper\" Metcalf\n* Bashir Salahuddin as Lieutenant Junior Grade Dusty Stevens\n* Danny Ramirez as Lieutenant Junior Grade Radar Intercept Officer Joe \"Fitzgerald\" Pete\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe film's development began in 2010, when Justin Marks was hired to write a script for a Top Gun sequel.

It officially began on June 1, 2023, and ended on November 30, 2023.\n\n**Seasonal forecasts**\n\n### Pre-season forecasts\n\nPrior to the start of the season, several organizations and agencies issued forecasts for the number of named storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes that would occur during the season. The Climate Prediction Center (CPC) issued a pre-season outlook on May 20, 2023, predicting a 60% chance of above-normal activity, a 30% chance of near-normal activity, and a 10% chance of below-normal activity. The CPC also predicted an average of 14 named storms, 6 hurricanes, and 2 major hurricanes.\n\n### Mid-season forecasts\n\nAs the season progressed, some organizations updated their forecasts. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued an updated outlook on August 4, 2023, predicting a 70% chance of above-normal activity, a 20% chance of near-normal activity, and a 10% chance of below-normal activity. The NOAA also predicted an average of 16 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes.\n\n**Seasonal summary**\n\n### Background\n\nThe 2023 Atlantic hurricane season was characterized by a strong African aerosol layer, which contributed to a drier-than-normal atmosphere over the Sahel region. This, in turn, led to a more energetic African easterly jet, which was conducive to tropical cyclogenesis. The season also saw a strong El Niño event, which typically suppresses hurricane activity in the Atlantic.\n\n### Early activity\n\nThe first storm of the season, subtropical storm Arlene, formed on May 25, 2023, in the western Atlantic. Arlene strengthened into a tropical storm on May 28 and made landfall in North Carolina on May 30. The storm brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to the eastern United States.\n\n### Peak to late activity\n\nThe peak of the season occurred in late August and early September, with several storms forming in quick succession. Hurricane Margaret formed on August 20 and strengthened into a major hurricane on August 22. Margaret made landfall in Florida on August 25, causing widespread damage and flooding. The storm also brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to the southeastern United States.\n\n**Systems**\n\n### Unnamed subtropical storm\n\n* **Duration:** May 25 – 28\n* **Peak intensity:** 65 mph (100 km/h)\n\n### Tropical Storm Arlene\n\n* **Duration:** May 25 – 31\n* **Peak intensity:** 70 mph (110 km/h)\n\n### Tropical Storm Bret\n\n* **Duration:** June 5 – 10\n* **Peak intensity:** 60 mph (95 km/h)\n\n### Tropical Storm Cindy\n\n* **Duration:** June 15 – 20\n* **Peak intensity:** 65 mph (100 km/h)\n\n### Hurricane Don\n\n* **Duration:** June 20 – 25\n* **Peak intensity:** 90 mph (145 km/h)\n\n### Tropical Storm Gert\n\n* **Duration:** June 25 – July 1\n* **Peak intensity:** 60 mph (95 km/h)\n\n### Tropical Storm Emily\n\n* **Duration:** July 1 – 5\n* **Peak intensity:** 65 mph (100 km/h)\n\n### Hurricane Franklin\n\n* **Duration:** July 5 – 10\n* **Peak intensity:** 100 mph (160 km/h)\n\n### Tropical Storm Harold\n\n* **Duration:** July 10 – 15\n* **Peak intensity:** 60 mph (95 km/h)\n\n### Hurricane Idalia\n\n* **Duration:** July 15 – 20\n* **Peak intensity:** 90 mph (145 km/h)\n\n### Tropical Storm Jose\n\n* **Duration:** July 20 – 25\n* **Peak intensity:** 65 mph (100 km/h)\n\n### Tropical Storm Katia\n\n* **Duration:** July 25 – 30\n* **Peak intensity:** 60 mph (95 km/h)\n\n### Hurricane Lee\n\n* **Duration:** August 1 – 8\n* **Peak intensity:** 120 mph (195 km/h)\n\n### Hurricane Margot\n\n* **Duration:** August 8 – 15\n* **Peak intensity:** 110 mph (175 km/h)\n\n### Hurricane Nigel\n\n* **Duration:** August 15 – 22\n* **Peak intensity:** 100 mph (160 km/h)\n\n### Tropical Storm Ophelia\n\n* **Duration:** August 22 – 27\n* **Peak intensity:** 60 mph (95 km/h)\n\n### Tropical Storm Philippe\n\n* **Duration:** August 27 – September 1\n* **Peak intensity:** 65 mph (100 km/h)\n\n### Tropical Storm Rina\n\n* **Duration:** September 1 – 5\n* **Peak intensity:** 60 mph (95 km/h)\n\n### Tropical Storm Sean\n\n* **Duration:** September 5 – 10\n* **Peak intensity:** 65 mph (100 km/h)\n\n### Hurricane Tammy\n\n* **Duration:** September 10 – 15\n* **Peak intensity:** 90 mph (145 km/h)\n\n### Tropical Depression Twenty-One\n\n* **Duration:** September 15 – 20\n* **Peak intensity:** 30 mph (45 km/h)\n\n### Other system\n\n* **Duration:** September 20 – 25\n* **Peak intensity:** 50 mph (80 km/h)\n\n**Storm names**\n\nThe following lists of names were used for named storms that formed in the Atlantic basin during 2023.

He is welcomed by the villagers, who are in dire need of his guidance due to the corrupt and oppressive government officials. Shiva uses his spiritual powers to unite the villagers and fight against the injustices perpetrated by the government officials. Along the way, he also helps a young woman, Kailash (Kajal Aggarwal), who is struggling to find her place in the world.\n\nCast\n\n* Chiranjeevi as Shiva\n* Kajal Aggarwal as Kailash\n* Pooja Hegde as Priya\n* Sonu Sood as Rana\n* Rajeev Kanakala as Satyam\n* Jhansi as Lakshmi\n* Tanikella Bharani as Rama Rao\n* Srikanth as Vikram\n* Aby Kaur as Rukmini\n* Gulshan Devaiah as DCP\n* Sudheer Babu as Ajay (cameo appearance)\n\nProduction\n\n## Development\n\nAcharya was first announced in 2019, with Chiranjeevi and Koratala Siva collaborating on the project.

However, the shoot was completed by the end of 2020, and the film was released in May 2022.\n\n## Legal issues\n\nAcharya was embroiled in a controversy over the film's music rights. The music rights for the film were initially given to Sony Music, but later, they were transferred to Zee Music. This led to a dispute between the two music companies, which was eventually resolved through mediation.\n\nMusic\n\nThe music for Acharya was composed by Mani Sharma, who is a well-known composer in the Telugu film industry. The soundtrack features six songs, including a duet sung by Chiranjeevi and Pooja Hegde. The music was released in April 2022 and received positive reviews from critics and audiences alike.\n\nRelease\n\n## Theatrical\n\nAcharya was released in theaters on May 13, 2022, coinciding with the festival of Buddha Purnima. The film was released in Telugu and dubbed versions in Hindi and Malayalam.

The film's lead actor, Chiranjeevi, received praise for his performance, but the film's direction and screenplay were criticized.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n* Acharya at IMDb\n* Acharya on Bollywood Hungama\n* Acharya on Rotten Tomatoes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Acharya_(2022_film)\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Casting\n##Filming\n##Legal issues\n#Music\n#Release\n##Theatrical\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The conflict has its roots in the complex history and politics of the region, and has evolved over time to involve various aspects of international relations, including military intervention, economic sanctions, and propaganda campaigns.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Independent Ukraine and the Orange Revolution\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine declared its independence and began to establish its own government and institutions. However, the country's early years were marked by corruption, economic instability, and a struggle for power between different factions. The Orange Revolution in 2004, which saw the opposition candidate Viktor Yushchenko defeat the incumbent president Leonid Kuchma, brought a sense of hope and optimism to the country. However, the revolution's aftermath was marked by continued corruption and infighting, which ultimately led to the rise of Vladimir Putin in Russia and the beginning of a new era of Russian-Ukrainian relations.\n\n### Euromaidan, Revolution of Dignity, and pro-Russian unrest\n\nIn 2013, a wave of protests swept across Ukraine, known as the Euromaidan movement, as people demanded greater integration with Europe and the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. The protests were met with violent crackdowns by the government, leading to the eventual ousting of Yanukovych and the establishment of a new government. However, the aftermath of the revolution saw a rise in pro-Russian unrest, particularly in the eastern regions of Ukraine, where many people had historically maintained close ties with Russia.\n\n### Russian military bases in Crimea\n\nPrior to the annexation of Crimea in 2014, Russia had maintained a significant military presence in the region, with several bases and installations. The presence of these bases had long been a source of tension between Ukraine and Russia, with Ukraine repeatedly calling for their closure.\n\n### Legality and declaration of war\n\nThe legality of the annexation of Crimea and the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine is disputed. Russia claims that the annexation was legitimate and that it was necessary to protect the rights of ethnic Russians in Crimea. However, Ukraine and many other countries view the annexation as an act of aggression and a violation of international law. The conflict in eastern Ukraine is classified as an armed conflict, with both sides accusing each other of aggression and human rights abuses.\n\n**History**\n\n### Russian annexation of Crimea (2014)\n\nOn February 27, 2014, Russian troops began to arrive in Crimea, marking the beginning of the annexation of the region. The annexation was widely condemned by the international community, with the United States and European Union imposing economic sanctions on Russia.\n\n### War in the Donbas (2014–2015)\n\nThe war in the Donbas region of Ukraine began in April 2014, when pro-Russian separatists declared independence from Ukraine and began to fight against the Ukrainian military. The conflict was marked by a series of battles and sieges, including the Battle of Ilovaisk and the Siege of Debaltseve.\n\n### Pro-Russia unrest\n\nThe pro-Russian unrest in eastern Ukraine was marked by a series of protests and demonstrations, particularly in the cities of Donetsk and Luhansk. The unrest was characterized by a mix of peaceful and violent protests, with separatists and Russian-backed forces using violence to suppress opposition.\n\n### Armed conflict\n\nThe armed conflict in eastern Ukraine was marked by a series of battles and sieges, including the Battle of Ilovaisk and the Siege of Debaltseve. The conflict was fought between the Ukrainian military and pro-Russian separatists, with both sides suffering significant casualties.\n\n### August 2014 Russian invasion\n\nOn August 24, 2014, Russia launched a major invasion of Ukraine, with troops and tanks pouring into the country. The invasion was widely condemned by the international community, with the United States and European Union imposing further economic sanctions on Russia.\n\n### Mariupol offensive and first Minsk ceasefire\n\nIn January 2015, the Ukrainian military launched a successful counteroffensive against the separatists in the city of Mariupol. The offensive was followed by the first Minsk ceasefire agreement, which was signed by Ukraine, Russia, and the separatists on February 12, 2015.\n\n### End of 2014 and Minsk II agreement\n\nThe year 2014 ended with a series of skirmishes and battles between the Ukrainian military and separatists, particularly in the Donbas region. In February 2015, the Minsk II agreement was signed, which aimed to establish a ceasefire and implement a series of confidence-building measures.\n\n### Line of conflict stabilizes (2015–2022)\n\nThe line of conflict in eastern Ukraine stabilized in 2015, with the Ukrainian military and separatists maintaining their positions. However, the conflict continued to simmer, with periodic skirmishes and battles breaking out.\n\n### 2018 Kerch Strait incident\n\nOn November 25, 2018, a confrontation between Ukrainian and Russian naval vessels in the Kerch Strait marked a significant escalation of the conflict. The incident was widely condemned by the international community, with the United States and European Union imposing further economic sanctions on Russia.\n\n### 2019–2020\n\nThe years 2019 and 2020 saw a series of skirmishes and battles between the Ukrainian military and separatists, particularly in the Donbas region. The conflict continued to simmer, with periodic outbreaks of violence.\n\n### Full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine (2022)\n\nThe full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine began on F", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Russo-Ukrainian_War\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Independent Ukraine and the Orange Revolution\n##Euromaidan, Revolution of Dignity, and pro-Russian unrest\n##Russian military bases in Crimea\n##Legality and declaration of war\n#History\n##Russian annexation of Crimea (2014)\n##War in the Donbas (2014–2015)\n###Pro-Russia unrest\n###Armed conflict\n###August 2014 Russian invasion\n###Mariupol offensive and first Minsk ceasefire\n###End of 2014 and Minsk II agreement\n##Line of conflict stabilizes (2015–2022)\n###2018 Kerch Strait incident\n###2019–2020\n##Full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine (2022)\n###Prelude\n###Escalation\n###Full-scale invasion\n##Ukrainian counteroffensives and stalemate (2022–2023)\n##Russian campaigns and Ukrainian Kursk offensive (1 December 2023 – present)\n#Human rights violations\n#Related issues\n##Spillover\n##Gas disputes and Nord Stream sabotage\n##Hybrid warfare\n##Russian propaganda and disinformation campaigns\n##Role of the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine\n##Russia–NATO relations\n#Reactions\n##Reactions to the Russian annexation of Crimea\n###Ukrainian response\n###NATO and United States military response\n###Financial markets\n##Reactions to the war in Donbas\n###Ukrainian public opinion\n###Russian public opinion\n##Reactions to the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n###Ukrainian public opinion\n###Russian public opinion\n###United States\n###Russian military suppliers\n###United Nations\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
