{"title": "2016_Philippine_presidential_election", "content": "\nElectoral system\nAccording to the Constitution of the Philippines, the election is held every six years after 1992, on the second Monday of May The incumbent president is term limited The incumbent vice president may run for two consecutive terms The plurality voting system is used to determine the winner: the candidate with the highest number of votes, whether or not one has a majority, wins the presidency The vice presidential election is a separate election, is held on the same rules, and voters may split their ticket Both winners will serve six-year terms commencing on the noon of June 30, 2016, and ending on the same day six years later [3]\n\n\nBackground\nSenator Benigno Aquino III of the Liberal Party, who ran on an anti-corruption platform, won the 2010 election with 42.08% of the votes defeating Joseph Estrada, a former president who was deposed in 2001 after scandals of massive corruption, and several others Meanwhile, Estrada's running mate, Makati Mayor Jejomar Binay of the Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan (PDP‚ÄìLaban), defeated Aquino's running mate, Senator Mar Roxas of the Liberal Party and several others, in the vice presidential election [4] Roxas eventually accused Binay of electoral fraud in the Presidential Electoral Tribunal, citing that some of his votes were recorded as null votes [5]\n\n\nCandidates\nUnder the Constitution of the Philippines, the President and Vice President are elected separately An initial list of eight presidential candidates were uploaded on the certified candidates list in the commission's database on January 21, 2016 [49] But only trimmed down to five, due to the declaration by the commission en banc of Dante Valencia as a nuisance candidate and the withdrawal of certificates of candidacies of Romel Mendoza and Roy Se√±eres [50] [51] [52]\n\n\nJejomar Binay (UNA)\nWhen questioned by the media at the Coconut Palace in September 2011, Vice President Jejomar Binay (PDP‚ÄìLaban) confirmed his plans of running as president [61]\n\n\nGringo Honasan (UNA)\nSenator Gregorio Honasan (United Nationalist Alliance) denied that he was going to be Jejomar Binay's running mate in September 2015 [74] By the next month, however, he said that his team-up with Binay was possible [75] On October 12, 2015, Honasan announced that he will be running with Binay as the latter's vice president [76]\n\n\nMiriam Defensor Santiago (PRP)\nIn a press conference on July 2, 2014, Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago (People's Reform Party) revealed that she was suffering from stage 4 lung cancer and she might run as president for the third time if it goes into remission [77] Called \"the Iron Lady of Asia\" and a recipient of the Ramon Magsaysay Award, she was the widely expected winner of the 1992 election, but lost after an inexplicably unscheduled power outage during the counting of votes She then ran for a Senate seat in 1995 and won She became one of the most popular senators since then, owing to her broad media visibility as well as to the high number of laws and bills she authored, a record that stands up to this day She once again ran for president in 1998, but lost, citing black propaganda against her during the campaign.\n\n\nBongbong Marcos (Independent)\nAsked on a November 2012 interview at DZBB on his plans to run in 2016, Senator Bongbong Marcos (Nacionalista Party) said \"never say never.\" [82] By March 2015, in another interview, this time at DZMM, he said that he \"will thoroughly study everything.\" [83] In August 2015, after reports surfaced of him being Jejomar Binay's running mate, Marcos clarified on an interview at the ABS-CBN News Channel that he is still undecided on what position to run for, but he would certainly not be defending his Senate seat [84] On October 5, 2015, Senator Bongbong Marcos announced his candidacy for vice president in the 2016 election, and would support the candidacy of Rodrigo Duterte if he ever does run [85] Days later, Duterte declined Cayetano's and Marcos' offers to be their presidential running mate.\n\n\nRodrigo Duterte (PDP‚ÄìLaban)\nEarly in 2015, Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte made hints to the media of his intent to run for the presidency come 2016, with a widely praised promise of abolishing Congress altogether in favor of a Parliament should he win [86] [87] [88] Earlier, in February 2014, Duterte was reportedly enjoying the support of several netizens lauding his performance as mayor of Davao City, especially in maintaining peace and order in the city, but he was quick to shrug off calls for him to run for president, saying he was not qualified for a higher public office [89] A year later, Duterte said in a Baguio federalism forum that he'll only run for president \"if (it is) to save the republic.\" Duterte cited the need of about 10 to 15 billion pesos for a campaign war chest as what was keeping him from running [90] Days later, however, Duterte \"re-entered\" PDP‚ÄìLaban; he maintained he never left the party, and only had to stand under a local party banner (Hugpong) in the 2013 local election in order to ensure his victory [91] PDP‚ÄìLaban president Aquilino Pimentel III later said that Duterte was among his party's options for a presidential candidate for 2016, noting that the party's position on federalism coincides with Duterte's advocacy [92] A few days after reports came out saying incumbent Vice President Jejomar Binay (a presidential aspirant) was eyeing Duterte as his possible running mate, Duterte issued a statement saying he was not interested in running for a national post [68]\n\n\nAlan Peter Cayetano (Independent)\nIn a March 2013 interview with the ABS-CBN News Channel, Senator Alan Peter Cayetano (Nacionalista Party), said that \"I want to be president of this country.\" [119] In September 2015, after several surveys saw him trailing in the presidential race, said that he is withdrawing from the presidential election, and would instead focus for the vice presidency, preferably as the running mate of either Mar Roxas or Rodrigo Duterte.\n\n\nGrace Poe (Independent)\nGrace Poe's surprising first-place finish in the 2013 Senate election as an independent made her a likely contender for the presidency but she dismissed any plans of running in April 2014, saying she was not considering \"anything higher at this point\" and even declaring that Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago was the most qualified to run as president [124]\n\n\nFrancis Escudero (Independent)\nSenator Francis Escudero (independent) said in a March 2012 Rappler interview that \"Let me be honest, candid, yet factual about it I would be very interested in seeking a higher office in 2016 for the simple reason that I'm halfway through my last term.\" [137] By May 2015, Grace Poe told reporters that she would not run against Escudero [138]\n\n\nMar Roxas (Liberal)\nSenate President Franklin Drilon, when describing the Liberal Party's plans for Interior Secretary Mar Roxas' in 2016, told the media in January 2013 that \"so far as the LP is concerned,  [and] in so far as I am concerned, we believe that he is best qualified for 2016.\" [140] Two years later, Drilon told DZIQ AM radio that Roxas had expressed his interest internally within the party [141] Several Liberal Party stalwarts had by then expressed that Roxas should declare his intentions at that time, [142] with some such as Budget Secretary Florencio Abad suggesting that Roxas may slide down to run for the vice presidency again [143]\n\n\nLeni Robredo (Liberal)\nIn August 2015, Representative Leni Robredo, from Camarines Sur's third district (Liberal Party), said that talk of plans of her running in 2016 is \"too soon\", and that she'd only run if she's \"indispensable\" [146]\n\n\nStandalone vice presidential candidate\nOne vice presidential candidate did not have a running mate.\n\n\nAntonio Trillanes (Independent)\nIn the news program Bandila's May 30, 2014, segment where a guest is asked to answer only \"yes\" or \"no,\" Senator Antonio Trillanes IV (Nacionalista Party) was asked if he would run for vice president in 2016 and responded by saying \"Let's just say yes, I will run As for what position, I will abide by the Nacionalista Party.\" [149]\n\n\nDebates\nThe Commission on Elections confirmed that they will organize three presidential debates and one vice presidential debate This was the first time that the commission organized debates since the 1992 presidential election The debates were dubbed as PiliPinas Debates 2016 (transl.‚ÄâThe Philippines Chooses) [154]\n\n\nPresidential debates\nOpinion polling in Philippines is conducted by Social Weather Stations (SWS), Pulse Asia and other third-party pollsters.\n\n\nVice presidential debates\nOpinion polling in Philippines is conducted by Social Weather Stations (SWS), Pulse Asia and other third-party pollsters.\n\n\nOpinion polling\nOpinion polling in Philippines is conducted by Social Weather Stations (SWS), Pulse Asia and other third-party pollsters.\n\n\nFor president\nAll candidates except for Poe and Santiago carried their respective hometowns Duterte carried the majority of Mindanao, the so-called \"Mega Manila\" (except Makati where Binay won) and the Cebuano-speaking provinces in the Visayas, except Negros Oriental Roxas carried the Ilonggo-speaking provinces, the Waray speaking provinces, Negros Oriental, his running mate's province of Camarines Sur and neighboring Albay in Bicol, and Mimaropa Poe carried most of the Ilocos Region, except Ilocos Norte, including her father's home province of Pangasinan Binay carried his parents' home region of Cagayan Valley and his hometown of Makati, where he served as mayor for several decades Santiago didn't win in any province.\n\n\nFor vice president\nRobredo carried the Bicol Region, except for Sorsogon, Escudero's home province, Roxas' stronghold of Western Visayas and Negros, the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, Northern Mindanao, the entire Mimaropa region, majority of provinces in Eastern Visayas, majority of Caraga region, majority of Zamboanga region, Quezon province, Central Visayas less Cebu City, almost half of Soccsksargen, and President Aquino's home province of Tarlac Marcos won the so-called \"Solid North\", the National Capital Region (except Taguig, where Cayetano won), his mother's home province of Leyte, and all provinces of Soccsksargen Cayetano won in his hometown of Taguig, and in Duterte's home region in the Davao Region.\n\nCampaign\nWhile the campaign period as set by law started on February 9, 2016, candidates had earlier started campaigning as early as late 2015, as the courts have struck the

the Philippines. It was held on May 9, 2016, to elect the President and Vice President of the Philippines. The election was a highly contested one, with five candidates vying for the presidency and 11 candidates vying for the vice presidency.\n\n**Electoral System**\n\nThe election is held every six years after 1992, on the second Monday of May. The incumbent president is term-limited, meaning they cannot run for re-election. The incumbent vice president may run for two consecutive terms. The plurality voting system is used to determine the winner: the candidate with the highest number of votes, whether or not one has a majority, wins the presidency. The vice presidential election is a separate election, held on the same rules, and voters may split their ticket. Both winners will serve six-year terms commencing on the noon of June 30, 2016, and ending on the same day six years later.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2016 presidential election was a highly anticipated one, with many candidates vying for the top spot. The incumbent president, Benigno Aquino III, was term-limited and could not run for re-election. The Liberal Party, which Aquino belonged to, nominated Mar Roxas as its candidate for president. Roxas, who served as Interior Secretary, was seen as a continuation of Aquino's policies. The opposition, on the other hand, nominated Jejomar Binay, who served as Vice President, as its candidate for president.\n\n**Candidates**\n\nUnder the Constitution of the Philippines, the President and Vice President are elected separately. An initial list of eight presidential candidates were uploaded on the certified candidates list in the commission's database on January 21, 2016. However, only five candidates made it to the final list due to the declaration by the commission en banc of Dante Valencia as a nuisance candidate and the withdrawal of certificates of candidacies of Romel Mendoza and Roy Se√±eres.\n\nThe five candidates for president were:\n\n1. **Jejomar Binay** (UNA) - Binay, who served as Vice President, was the opposition's candidate for president. He promised to continue the economic growth and development of the country.\n2. **Gregorio Honasan** (UNA) - Honasan, a senator, was Binay's running mate for vice president.\n3. **Miriam Defensor Santiago** (PRP) - Santiago, a senator, was a highly respected candidate who promised to continue her anti-corruption platform.\n4. **Bongbong Marcos** (Independent) - Marcos, a senator, was a highly respected candidate who promised to continue his father's legacy.\n5. **Rodrigo Duterte** (PDP‚ÄìLaban) - Duterte, the mayor of Davao City, was a highly popular candidate who promised to continue his law and order platform.\n6. **Alan Peter Cayetano** (Independent) - Cayetano, a senator, was a highly respected candidate who promised to continue his anti-corruption platform.\n7. **Grace Poe** (Independent) - Poe, a senator, was a highly respected candidate who promised to continue her anti-poverty platform.\n8. **Francis Escudero** (Independent) - Escudero, a senator, was a highly respected candidate who promised to continue his anti-poverty platform.\n9. **Mar Roxas** (Liberal) - Roxas, the interior secretary, was the Liberal Party's candidate for president.\n10. **Leni Robredo** (Liberal) - Robredo, a congresswoman, was Roxas's running mate for vice president.\n11. **Antonio Trillanes** (Independent) - Trillanes, a senator, was a highly respected candidate who promised to continue his anti-poverty platform.\n\n**Debates**\n\nThe Commission on Elections confirmed that they will organize three presidential debates and one vice presidential debate. This was the first time that the commission organized debates since the 1992 presidential election. The debates were dubbed as PiliPinas Debates 2016.\n\n**Opinion Polling**\n\nOpinion polling in the Philippines is conducted by Social Weather Stations (SWS), Pulse Asia, and other third-party pollsters. According to the SWS, Roxas was leading the pack with 23% of the votes, followed by Duterte with 20%, Binay with 18%, Poe with 14%, and Marcos with 12%.\n\n**Campaign**\n\nWhile the campaign period as set by law started on February 9, 2016, candidates had earlier started campaigning as early as late 2015, as the courts have struck the ban on premature campaigning as unconstitutional. The campaign period was marked by intense debates and criticisms between the candidates.\n\n**Issues**\n\nThe continuation of outgoing president Benigno Aquino III's policies is seen to be the main theme for this election. Roxas promises the continuation of the \"Daang Matuwid\" (\"straight path\") anti-corruption drive by the last president, which is appealing among the elites. Binay's policies, on the other hand, are seen as opposite of Aquino's, such as the former's opposition to the enactment of the Bangsamoro Basic Law, and on how to approach China concerning the territorial disputes in the South China Sea.\n\n**Results**\n\nCongress canvassed the results in record time of three days. Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte and Representative from Camarines Sur Leni Robredo were proclaimed president and vice president on May 30, in front of a joint session, at the Batasang Pambansa Complex.\n\n**Electoral Protest**\n\nOn the evening of May 10, Leni Robredo took first place on the unofficial vote count led by the Parish Pastoral Council on Responsible Voting (PPCRV), and Bongbong Marcos suspected that the Liberal Party manipulated the vice presidential votes in favor of Robredo. Marcos soon ordered the Commission on Elections to stop the unofficial count by the PPCRV, and he stated that no one has been aware that his lead on the unofficial vote count fell down.\n\n**Voter Demographics**\n\nThe Social Weather Stations' exit poll showed that 63% of the respondents were satisfied with the conduct of the election, while 72% of the respondents believed that the election was free and fair.\n\n**References**\n\nExternal links:\n\n* Official website of the Commission on Elections\n* Official website of the Philippine National Police\n* Official website of the Department of

the same day six years later [3]\n\n\nBackground\nSenator Benigno Aquino III of the Liberal Party, who ran on an anti-corruption platform, won the 2010 election with 42.08% of the votes defeating Joseph Estrada, a former president who was deposed in 2001 after scandals of massive corruption, and several others Meanwhile, Estrada's running mate, Makati Mayor Jejomar Binay of the Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan (PDP‚ÄìLaban), defeated Aquino's running mate, Senator Mar Roxas of the Liberal Party and several others, in the vice presidential election [4] Roxas eventually accused Binay of electoral fraud in the Presidential Electoral Tribunal, citing that some of his votes were recorded as null votes [5]\n\n\nCandidates\nUnder the Constitution of the Philippines, the President and Vice President are elected separately An initial list of eight presidential candidates were uploaded on the certified candidates list in the commission's database on January 21, 2016 [49] But only trimmed down to five, due to the declaration by the commission en banc of Dante Valencia as a nuisance candidate and the withdrawal of certificates of candidacies of Romel Mendoza and Roy Se√±eres [50] [51] [52]\n\n\nJejomar Binay (UNA)\nWhen questioned by the media at the Coconut Palace in September 2011, Vice President Jejomar Binay (PDP‚ÄìLaban) confirmed his plans of running as president [61]\n\n\nGringo Honasan (UNA)\nSenator Gregorio Honasan (United Nationalist Alliance) denied that he was going to be Jejomar Binay's running mate in September 2015 [74] By the next month, however, he said that his team-up with Binay was possible [75] On October 12, 2015, Honasan announced that he will be running with Binay as the latter's vice president [76]\n\n\nMiriam Defensor Santiago (PRP)\nIn a press conference on July 2, 2014, Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago (People's Reform Party) revealed that she was suffering from stage 4 lung cancer and she might run as president for the third time if it goes into remission [77] Called \"the Iron Lady of Asia\" and a recipient of the Ramon Magsaysay Award, she was the widely expected winner of the 1992 election, but lost after an inexplicably unscheduled power outage during the counting of votes She then ran for a Senate seat in 1995 and won She became one of the most popular senators since then, owing to her broad media visibility as well as to the high number of laws and bills she authored, a record that stands up to this day She once again ran for president in 1998, but lost, citing black propaganda against her during the campaign.\n\n\nBongbong Marcos (Independent)\nAsked on a November 2012 interview at DZBB on his plans to run in 2016, Senator Bongbong Marcos (Nacionalista Party) said \"never say never.\" [82] By March 2015, in another interview, this time at DZMM, he said that he \"will thoroughly study everything.\" [83] In August 2015, after reports surfaced of him being Jejomar Binay's running mate, Marcos clarified on an interview at the ABS-CBN News Channel that he is still undecided on what position to run for, but he would certainly not be defending his Senate seat [84] On October 5, 2015, Senator Bongbong Marcos announced his candidacy for vice president in the 2016 election, and would support the candidacy of Rodrigo Duterte if he ever does run [85] Days later, Duterte declined Cayetano's and Marcos' offers to be their presidential running mate.\n\n\nRodrigo Duterte (PDP‚ÄìLaban)\nEarly in 2015, Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte made hints to the media of his intent to run for the presidency come 2016, with a widely praised promise of abolishing Congress altogether in favor of a Parliament should he win [86] [87] [88] Earlier, in February 2014, Duterte was reportedly enjoying the support of several netizens lauding his performance as mayor of Davao City, especially in maintaining peace and order in the city, but he was quick to shrug off calls for him to run for president, saying he was not qualified for a higher public office [89] A year later, Duterte said in a Baguio federalism forum that he'll only run for president \"if (it is) to save the republic.\" Duterte cited the need of about 10 to 15 billion pesos for a campaign war chest as what was keeping him from running [90] Days later, however, Duterte \"re-entered\" PDP‚ÄìLaban; he maintained he never left the party, and only had to stand under a local party banner (Hugpong) in the 2013 local election in order to ensure his victory [91] PDP‚ÄìLaban president Aquilino Pimentel III later said that Duterte was among his party's options for a presidential candidate for 2016, noting that the party's position on federalism coincides with Duterte's advocacy [92] A few days after reports came out saying incumbent Vice President Jejomar Binay (a presidential aspirant) was eyeing Duterte as his possible running mate, Duterte issued a statement saying he was not interested in running for a national post [68]\n\n\nAlan Peter Cayetano (Independent)\nIn a March 2013 interview with the ABS-CBN News Channel, Senator Alan Peter Cayetano (Nacionalista Party), said that \"I want to be president of this country.\" [119] In September 2015, after several surveys saw him trailing in the presidential race, said that he is withdrawing from the presidential election, and would instead focus for the vice presidency, preferably as the running mate of either Mar Roxas or Rodrigo Duterte.\n\n\nGrace Poe (Independent)\nGrace Poe's surprising first-place finish in the 2013 Senate election as an independent made her a likely contender for the presidency but she dismissed any plans of running in April 2014, saying she was not considering \"anything higher at this point\" and even declaring that Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago was the most qualified to run as president [124]\n\n\nFrancis Escudero (Independent)\nSenator Francis Escudero (independent) said in a March 2012 Rappler interview that \"Let me be honest, candid, yet factual about it I would be very interested in seeking a higher office in 2016 for the simple reason that I'm halfway through my last term.\" [137] By May 2015, Grace Poe told reporters that she would not run against Escudero [138]\n\n\nMar Roxas (Liberal)\nSenate President Franklin Drilon, when describing the Liberal Party's plans for Interior Secretary Mar Roxas' in 2016, told the media in January 2013 that \"so far as the LP is concerned,  [and] in so far as I am concerned, we believe that he is best qualified for 2016.\" [140] Two years later, Drilon told DZIQ AM radio that Roxas had expressed his interest internally within the party [141] Several Liberal Party stalwarts had by then expressed that Roxas should declare his intentions at that time, [142] with some such as Budget Secretary Florencio Abad suggesting that Roxas may slide down to run for the vice presidency again [143]\n\n\nLeni Robredo (Liberal)\nIn August 2015, Representative Leni Robredo, from Camarines Sur's third district (Liberal Party), said that talk of plans of her running in 2016 is \"too soon\", and that she'd only run if she's \"indispensable\" [146]\n\n\nStandalone vice presidential candidate\nOne vice presidential candidate did not have a running mate.\n\n\nAntonio Trillanes (Independent)\nIn the news program Bandila's May 30, 2014, segment where a guest is asked to answer only \"yes\" or \"no,\" Senator Antonio Trillanes IV (Nacionalista Party) was asked if he would run for vice president in 2016 and responded by saying \"Let's just say yes, I will run As for what position, I will abide by the Nacionalista Party.\" [149]\n\n\nDebates\nThe Commission on Elections confirmed that they will organize three presidential debates and one vice presidential debate This was the first time that the commission organized debates since the 1992 presidential election The debates were dubbed as PiliPinas Debates 2016 (transl.‚ÄâThe

{"title": "Glenn_Youngkin", "content": "\nEarly life and education\nGlenn Allen Youngkin was born in Richmond, Virginia, [7] on December 9, 1966 [8] [9] He is the son of Ellis (n√©e Quinn) and Carroll Wayne \"Yunk\" Youngkin [10] [11] His father played basketball for Duke University and worked in accounting and finance [12] His mother was a doctorally prepared nurse practitioner who specialized in women's health; she was also a professor of nursing, and an associate dean for graduate studies at Florida Atlantic University [13] [14] Youngkin has a sister, Dorothy Marian \"Dottie\" Youngkin Kouba [15] [16] [17] When he was a teenager, the family moved from Richmond to Virginia Beach [18] He attended the private Norfolk Academy in Norfolk, Virginia, graduating in 1985 [19] He received numerous high school basketball honors [20]\n\n\nCareer\nAfter graduating from Rice in 1990, Youngkin joined the investment bank First Boston, [24] where he worked on mergers and acquisitions and capital market financing [26] The company was bought out by Credit Suisse and became Credit Suisse First Boston; Youngkin left in 1992 to pursue an MBA [27] [24]\n\n\nEarly career\nAfter graduating from Rice in 1990, Youngkin joined the investment bank First Boston, [24] where he worked on mergers and acquisitions and capital market financing [26] The company was bought out by Credit Suisse and became Credit Suisse First Boston; Youngkin left in 1992 to pursue an MBA [27] [24]\n\n\nThe Carlyle Group\nIn August 1995, [28] Youngkin joined the Washington, D.C private-equity firm The Carlyle Group, [27] initially working as a member of the US buyout team [24] In 1999, he was named a partner and managing director of Carlyle [29] [30] He managed the firm's United Kingdom buyout team (2000‚Äì2005) [24] [31] and its global industrial sector investment team (2005‚Äì2008), dividing his time between London and Washington [29] [32]\n\n\nCo-CEO\nIn October 2017, the Carlyle Group announced that its founders would remain executive chairmen on the board of directors but step down as the day-to-day leaders of the firm The firm named Youngkin and Kewsong Lee as co-CEOs effective January 1, 2018 [2] Youngkin oversaw Carlyle's real estate, energy, infrastructure businesses, and investment solutions businesses, while Lee oversaw the firm's corporate private equity and global credit businesses [48] [49] Youngkin and Lee also joined the firm's board of directors when they became co-CEOs [43] During Youngkin and Lee's tenure as co-CEOs, they oversaw the firm's transition from a publicly traded partnership into a corporation [50] [51] [52]\n\n\n2021 gubernatorial election\nIn January 2021, Youngkin declared that he would seek the Republican Party of Virginia's nomination for governor of Virginia [57] [18] Youngkin's personal wealth gave him the ability to self-fund his candidacy, [58] [59] and he spent at least $5.5 million of his own money on his primary campaign [60] Youngkin was endorsed by Ted Cruz during the primary; Cruz has described Youngkin as a close family friend [61] [62] [63] Youngkin had previously donated to Cruz's 2018 re-election campaign [63]\n\n\nGovernor of Virginia (2022‚Äìpresent)\nYoungkin was sworn in as governor on January 15, 2022 He took office alongside his Republican ticket mates, Lieutenant Governor Winsome Sears, the first woman of color elected to statewide office in Virginia, and Attorney General Jason Miyares, the first Latino elected to statewide office in the state [105] The Washington Post called this ticket \"historically diverse\" [106] and reported that it was a sign of \"inroads\" made by the Republican Party \"in the African American and Latino communities.\" [107] Former Democratic Governor of Virginia Douglas Wilder commented after the election that Republicans had \"one-upped\" Democrats with the historic achievement, which, he said, showed that Democrats \"can't take the  [Black] community for granted.\" [107]\n\n\nInauguration\nYoungkin was sworn in as governor on January 15, 2022 He took office alongside his Republican ticket mates, Lieutenant Governor Winsome Sears, the first woman of color elected to statewide office in Virginia, and Attorney General Jason Miyares, the first Latino elected to statewide office in the state [105] The Washington Post called this ticket \"historically diverse\" [106] and reported that it was a sign of \"inroads\" made by the Republican Party \"in the African American and Latino communities.\" [107] Former Democratic Governor of Virginia Douglas Wilder commented after the election that Republicans had \"one-upped\" Democrats with the historic achievement, which, he said, showed that Democrats \"can't take the  [Black] community for granted.\" [107]\n\n\nDay one executive actions\nAfter his inauguration, Youngkin signed eleven executive actions The first of these bans the teaching of what it calls \"inherently divisive concepts\" and identifies critical race theory as one such concept [114] [105] [115] In his executive order, Youngkin characterized critical race theory and related concepts as \"political indoctrination\" that \"instruct students to only view life through the lens of race and presumes that some students are consciously or unconsciously racist, sexist, or oppressive, and that other students are victims.\" [114] [116] The Washington Post noted that while critical race theory specifically refers to \"an academic framework that examines how policies and laws perpetuate systemic racism in the United States\", the term has been reappropriated by conservatives \"as a catchall symbolizing schools' equity and diversity work.\" [115] Youngkin's stance on critical race theory has been condemned by leaders of the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus, [115] [117] [118] and according to The Richmond Times-Dispatch, has \"alarmed many educators\" in the state [119] Youngkin's critics, the publication wrote, view the banning of critical race theory as an attempt to \"whitewash\" history and \"erase black history\" [119]\n\n\nLawsuits\nTwo lawsuits were brought in January against Youngkin's executive order nullifying local public school mask mandates in Virginia One of the lawsuits was brought by a group of parents from Chesapeake and the other was brought by seven of the state's school boards [123] [124] [125] The lawsuits argued that Youngkin's executive order infringed upon local control given to Virginia school boards by the state constitution and violated a state law requiring that Virginia public schools comply with CDCP health guidelines \"to the maximum extent practicable\" [125] [126] The ACLU, representing a group of medically vulnerable students in Virginia, brought an additional lawsuit in February, arguing that Youngkin's policy violated the Americans with Disabilities Act by discriminating against students who would be at high risk if infected by COVID-19 [127] Youngkin called on Virginia parents to cooperate with school principals while the lawsuits proceeded [123] [125]\n\n\nCabinet\nYoungkin began nominating his sixteen-member cabinet on December 20, 2021, and did not finish the process until after his inauguration [135] [136] [137] [138] According to The Washington Post, Youngkin assembled his cabinet at a slower pace than prior Virginia governors [139] [140] [141] Commenting on this process, the publication wrote in December 2021, \"The slow pace has turned the quadrennial parlor game of predicting Cabinet picks into a far more protracted and opaque process  [than usual], with lobbyists, interest groups and other Richmond insiders left guessing what the new administration might look like Youngkin's practice of sidestepping many policy specifics during the campaign has only heightened the anticipation.\" [139]\n\n\nChief Diversity Officer\nYoungkin finished his cabinet nominations on January 19, 2022, with his choice for chief diversity officer [138] This position was established by Youngkin's immediate predecessor, Ralph Northam, in response to a scandal involving racist imagery appearing on Northam's medical school yearbook page - a scandal that nearly caused Northam to resign from office The idea for a Chief Diversity Officer was born out of a commitment made by Northam to focus the remainder of his term on advancing racial equity in Virginia [136] [148] Youngkin did not nominate for Chief Diversity Officer until after his inauguration, [138] which led to media speculation that he would be eliminating the position [136] Youngkin's nominee for Chief Diversity Officer, Angela Sailor, was an executive at the Heritage Foundation and held multiple roles in George W Bush's presidential administration [138]\n\n\nAndrew Wheeler nomination\nYoungkin's initial nominee for Secretary of Natural Resources, Andrew Wheeler, was voted down on a party-line vote in the Democratic-controlled State Senate [150] [151] [152] [153] Wheeler had served as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in the Trump administration, and before that, worked as a coal lobbyist His tenure at the EPA was marked by reversals of environmental regulations that had been implemented by the Obama administration, and his nomination to serve in Youngkin's cabinet was heavily criticized by environmental advocates [141] [154] [155] A letter signed by 150 former EPA employees was sent to the Virginia legislature expressing opposition to Wheeler's nomination [150] [156]\n\n\nUnpaid advisors\nThe Youngkin administration has drawn notice from both The Washington Post and The Richmond Times-Dispatch for its use of Matthew Moran and Aubrey Layne as unpaid advisors [168] [169]\n\n\nTipline for \"divisive practices\"\nDuring his first week as governor, Youngkin set up an email tipline to receive reports about what he characterized as \"divisive practices\" in Virginia schools The tipline was introduced in a January 21, 2022 news release focused on Youngkin's executive order banning school mask mandates [171] [172] Three days later, Youngkin discussed the tipline on a conservative radio show, where he said that parents should use the tipline to report \"any instances where they feel that their fundamental rights are being violated, where their children are not being respected, where there are inherently divisive practices in their schools.\" [171] Speaking of the practices to be reported, he said on the radio show that his administration would \"catalogue it all\" and begin \"rooting it out\" [173]\n\n\nLoudoun County School Board proposal\nDuring Virginia's 2022 legislative session, a bill concerning elections for the Loudoun County School Board was amended by Youngkin in an effort that, if successful, would have caused elections to be held a year in advance for seven of the board's nine members [189] [190] [191] A spokesperson for Youngkin described the amendment as an attempt at \"holding  [the board] to account\" for their handling of two sexual assaults that had occurred in that county's school system a year earlier [189] Opposing the Loudoun County School Board over a variety of issues had been a major focus of Youngkin's gubernatorial campaign [189] [192] In response to Youngkin's proposed amendment, Democrats, several political scientists, and the county school board itself charged that Youngkin was attempting to subvert the election results that had placed the board members in office [165] [166] [167] [193] The Washington Post reported that Youngkin's effort had \"stunned many state political observers as an intrusion into local election integrity without modern precedent in Virginia.\" [189] The publication further wrote at the time that the amendment was one of the \"more controversial actions\" that Youngkin had taken [166] and led to \"one of the harshest partisan eruptions\" in the Virginia state legislature since the start of Youngkin's term [167] Legal scholar A.E Dick Howard argued that the amendment was likely in violation of Virginia's Constitution, which Howard had helped to write in the 1970s [189] The proposed amendment passed in the Republican-controlled House of Delegates but was defeated in the Democratic-controlled State Senate [167] [189] [191] [193]\n\n\nChange of transgender regulations\nIn September 2022, the Youngkin administration announced that it would be repealing regulations on transgender students in Virginia schools These had been established through a bipartisan bill signed by Northam in 2020 That bill required that policies pertaining to transgender students be in compliance throughout all school districts with \"model policies\" developed by the Virginia Department of Education Under Northam, these model policies had mandated that students be allowed access to school facilities and nonathletic school programs corresponding with their gender identity; the policies deferred to the Virginia High School League in matters pertaining to transgender student athletes The policies also mandated that all school staff use the preferred name and pronoun of each student Under Youngkin, the model policies were revised by the Virginia Department of Education to mandate that student-access to school facilities and programs be determined by biological sex rather than by gender identity; the policy revisions introduced under Youngkin also mandate that legal documentation be provided before school records can reflect a change in a student's name or gender and that a written request by a parent be provided before school staff can refer to a student by that student's preferred name or pronoun; even after such a request has been submitted by a parent, Youngkin's policies do not require school staff to comply with parental preferences when addressing students It has been suggested [by whom?] that Youngkin's policies may require teachers to out students to their parents, as the policies state that schools cannot \"encourage or instruct teachers to conceal material information about a student from the student's parent, including information related to gender.\" [194]\n\n\nTenure and political positions\nAbout a week after Youngkin's inauguration, All Things Considered likened Youngkin's political ideology to that of former President Donald Trump, writing that although Youngkin \"came to power as a sort of establishment Republican politician, a businessman who spoke to suburban families\" and who \"gave off ..  [a] dad-next-door image\", his administration quickly began \"leaning into a lot of the same themes as the former president\" [202] A year into Youngkin's governorship, The Washington Post called Youngkin \"famous for being just Trumpy enough to woo MAGA Republicans without alienating more moderate voters\" [203] The newspaper summed up Youngkin's political style by calling him \"a genial but aggressive culture warrior who has treaded cautiously with Trump and cozied up to election deniers.\" [204] As governor, Youngkin subjected many executive branch positions to litmus tests on abortion, critical race theory, and transgender policies [151] Politico described Youngkin's tenure as \"something of a disappointment but was a .. dike in a left-turning state.\" [6]\n\n\nAbortion\nAbortion in Virginia remains legal up to the end of the second trimester of a pregnancy Youngkin describes himself as \"pro-life,\" but supports legal access to abortion in cases of rape, incest, or protecting the mother's life [206] During his gubernatorial campaign, he criticized the Texas Heartbeat Act, which bans abortions around the sixth week of pregnancy except for when needed to protect the life of the mother At that time, Youngkin stated his preference for a \"pain threshold bill\", which bans abortion at around twenty weeks [207] [208] However, in July 2021 while running for governor, he was caught on a hot mic telling an activist that he would \"start going on offense\" against abortion rights if elected governor but would largely avoid the topic until then, saying \"as a campaign topic, sadly, that in fact won't win my independent votes that I have to get.\" [209] [210]\n\n\nCOVID-19\nYoungkin supports the COVID-19 vaccination effort but opposes mask and vaccine mandates [223] He and his family are vaccinated [224] In his first address to the General Assembly, he emphasized his position on the state's vaccination efforts by stating, \"Speaking to you as your governor, I'll never tell you what you must do But speaking to you as your neighbor and a friend, I strongly encourage you to get the vaccine.\" [117]\n\n\nCriminal justice\nIn 2022, Youngkin signed a bill downscaling the Marcus alert system, which had been established by Northam about two years earlier in response to both the George Floyd protests of 2020 and the 2018 killing in Richmond of Marcus-David Peters [257] [258] [259] [260] Wherever implemented, the Marcus alert system requires that mental health professionals be involved in responding to any mental health crises reported to 911 [261] Certain localities in Virginia began adopting the system in late 2021 When signed into law by Northam, the system was required to be implemented statewide by July 2026 [260] The legislation signed by Youngkin in 2022 exempts Virginia localities with populations of under 40,000 from having to adopt the Marcus alert system This exemption applies to about 67% of Virginia localities and over 19% of the state's population It was adopted due to concerns about the cost of implementing the system statewide [262] [263]\n\n\nPolicing\nIn 2022, Youngkin signed a bill downscaling the Marcus alert system, which had been established by Northam about two years earlier in response to both the George Floyd protests of 2020 and the 2018 killing in Richmond of Marcus-David Peters [257] [258] [259] [260] Wherever implemented, the Marcus alert system requires that mental health professionals be involved in responding to any mental health crises reported to 911 [261] Certain localities in Virginia began adopting the system in late 2021 When signed into law by Northam, the system was required to be implemented statewide by July 2026 [260] The legislation signed by Youngkin in 2022 exempts Virginia localities with populations of under 40,000 from having to adopt the Marcus alert system This exemption applies to about 67% of Virginia localities and over 19% of the state's population It was adopted due to concerns about the cost of implementing the system statewide [262] [263]\n\n\nSentence credits\nAn amendment that Youngkin introduced to the 2022 state budget limited the number of inmates who could qualify for an expanded early release program that was scheduled to begin later that summer The program allows inmates in Virginia to earn time off their sentences through good behavior credits It had been expanded through legislation signed in 2020 by Youngkin's predecessor, Ralph Northam, so that Virginia's cap on how many good behavior credits could be earned was raised for most inmates As this expansion of the program was originally designed, the newly available credits could not be used to reduce sentences for violent crimes but could be used by inmates convicted of violent crimes to reduce any concurrent or consecutive sentences that had been imposed for nonviolent crimes Youngkin and other Republicans characterized this aspect of the program as an unintentional loophole that needed correcting Democrats largely disagreed with that characterization, arguing that the expanded program had been intentionally designed to give violent offenders the ability to reduce sentences unrelated to violent offenses Youngkin's amendment was adopted by the General Assembly along mostly party lines It made inmates convicted of violent crimes fully ineligible for the expanded program, meaning that these inmates could not use the newly available credits to reduce any sentences [218] [272] [273] [274] [275]\n\n\nEconomy\nDuring his campaign for governor, Youngkin frequently said that Virginia's economy was \"in the ditch\" [277] [278] [279] Some political scientists, such as Mark Rozell, considered this an unusual position, since throughout the campaign, Virginia had low unemployment, a budget surplus, and a AAA bond rating The state had also been rated that year by CNBC as the Top State for Business Youngkin argued against the merits of the CNBC rating, stating that it put too much emphasis on inclusivity and noting Virginia's poor ratings in the \"cost of living\" and \"cost of doing business\" categories [277] During Youngkin's first year in office, Virginia lost its top spot on the CNBC list, after having earned that spot twice in a row during Northam's governorship The lower ranking under Youngkin was due to Virginia earning worse scores in the \"life, health and inclusion\" and \"workforce\" categories [280]\n\n\nTaxes\nThe Washington Post noted that more than two months after winning the Republican nomination, Youngkin had \"yet to disclose any formal economic plan.\" [277] One of Youngkin's main proposals at that stage of the race was an elimination of Virginia's individual income tax [281] [277] According to NPR, this proposal received \"criticism from both Democrats and Republicans that doing so would wipe out around 70% of Virginia's General Fund.\" [282] Before the end of his campaign, Youngkin retracted his proposal to eliminate the tax, [281] [282] calling it \"aspirational\" [281] and saying, \"In Virginia, we can't get rid of income tax, but we sure can try to bring it down.\" [282]\n\n\nAffordable housing and tenant protections\nThe state budget signed by Youngkin in 2022 included a $150 million investment in the Virginia Housing Trust Fund, which is devoted to providing affordable housing in the state [291] This amounted to half the total Northam had proposed investing in the fund According to WVTF, a Virginia NPR affiliate, the state would need to invest $5 billion annually to fully address its affordable housing needs [299] Youngkin has said that he opposes any further investments in affordable housing [300]\n\n\nFailed stadium subsidy plan\nIn 2023, Youngkin made public an agreement with Ted Leonsis, the owner of Washington Wizards and Washington Capitals, to move the teams to Alexandria, VA from downtown Washington D.C As part of the agreement, Virginia taxpayers were set to pay $1.35 billion for new stadiums for the Wizards and Capitals in Alexandria, the largest public stadium subsidy of its kind [302] The agreement did not gain approval by Virginia state lawmakers or by local politicians in Alexandria, which doomed the project [303]\n\n\nEducation\nYoungkin's education platform was identified as the centerpiece of his campaign by much of the national media, [94] [304] [305] [306] [307] [308] and he sought to mobilize voters on the issue by holding Parents Matter rallies [305] [306] According to Politico, Youngkin \"hung his campaign on education\" [308] The New York Times wrote that Youngkin's campaign turned Virginia public schools into \"a cultural war zone\", [306] and a year after the election, The Washington Post wrote that Youngkin \"has leaned into culture wars in K-12 education\" [309] Noting his stances on how schools approach race, transgender students, and pandemic policies, the publication wrote that Youngkin \"has continued to center those issues in office\" [310]\n\n\nCultural issues and curriculum\nThroughout the campaign, Youngkin spoke against what he characterized as the pervasive teaching of critical race theory in the state [94] [304] [305] [306] [308] PolitiFact found this characterization of his to be false, saying it found no evidence that critical race theory was part of state curriculum standards and little evidence of it being taught in classrooms [311] The publication wrote, \"Critical race theory is being widely discussed by educators across Virginia But there's a difference between educators learning about the theory and actually teaching it to students.\" [311]\n\n\nEducation budget\nYoungkin and McAuliffe both campaigned on increasing the education budget in Virginia, [304] where teacher salaries had perpetually lagged behind the national average [344] [345] Shortly before leaving office, outgoing governor Ralph Northam proposed increasing Virginia's biennial education budget from $14.8 billion to $17.2 billion, [346] while McAuliffe's platform called for increasing the state's spending on education by $2 billion annually [304] [347] The two Democrats sought to focus their proposed spending increases on raising teacher salaries, expanding preschool to disadvantaged children, investing more in both STEM programs and ESL services, ensuring internet access for all students, and closing the state's achievement gaps [304] [346] [347]\n\n\nCharter schools and lab schools\nWhile running for governor, Youngkin voiced support for expanding charter schools in the state and set a goal of adding at least twenty during his term [283] [284] After the election, The Richmond-Times Dispatch reported that Youngkin's actual goal for charter schools would be to increase the number in Virginia \"to match North Carolina, which has more than 200.\" [143] Only seven charter schools currently exist in Virginia, [355] one of the lowest amounts in the country, [284] and Youngkin has backed proposed legislation that would shift the authority to approve new charter schools from local school boards to newly created \"regional charter school divisions\" These divisions would have nine voting members, eight appointed by the Virginia State Board of Education, and one appointed by local school boards within the region [356]\n\n\nEnvironment\nAsked if he accepts the scientific consensus on the causes of climate change, Youngkin said he does not know what causes climate change and that he considers the cause to be irrelevant [365] He supports climate change adaptation efforts such as building additional seawalls [365] [366] While running for governor, Youngkin said he would not have signed Virginia's Clean Economy Act (which calls for Virginia's carbon emissions to reach net zero by 2050) because he believes it would increase utility prices [365] Youngkin is in favor of what he calls an \"all of the above approach\" to energy, saying that he supports both renewable energy sources and natural gas [367] He has called for Virginia to become a world leader in nuclear energy, proposing that a small modular reactor be built in Southwest Virginia within the next decade [368]\n\n\nMarijuana\nDuring his governorship, Youngkin has consistently opposed various efforts to liberalize marijuana laws in Virginia [372]\n\n\nSame-sex marriage\nIn March 2024, Youngkin signed a bill codifying same-sex marriage in Virginia law [385] [386] In 2006, voters amended the state's constitution to define marriage as heterosexual; if Obergefell v Hodges is overturned, the state constitution would need to be amended for the state law to take effect [387] [386]\n\n\nElection procedure\nAs governor, Youngkin has touted his work restoring voting rights to former felons, an effort that began under Governor Bob McDonnell and then intensified under McDonnell's immediate successors, McAuliffe and Northam Virginia is one of only eleven states that does not automatically allow former felons to vote by the end of their sentences An amendment to the state constitution that would have established automatic voting rights restoration for released felons in Virginia passed the legislature during Northam's final year in office, but amendments to the state constitution must be passed during two consecutive legislative sessions separated by an election before they can be voted on by the public in a referendum, and Republicans in the House of Delegates voted against the amendment during Youngkin's first year in office [388] In 2023, it was reported that Youngkin and his Secretary of the Commonwealth had quietly reversed course from their predecessors, reinstating procedural hurdles to the franchise restoration process and dramatically decreasing the number of ex-felons granted the franchise The administration responded that reviewing applications on a case-by-case basis was in-line with the state constitution but did not specify the criteria being considered [389] [390]\n\n\nPersonal life\nBefore taking office, Youngkin lived in Great Falls, Virginia, with his wife Suzanne and their four children [393]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Glenn Youngkin\n\nGlenn Allen Youngkin is an American businessman and politician who has served as the Governor of Virginia since January 15, 2022. He is a member of the Republican Party and has been involved in various business and philanthropic endeavors throughout his career.\n\nEarly Life and Education\n\nGlenn Youngkin was born on December 9, 1966, in Richmond, Virginia. He is the son of Ellis (n√©e Quinn) and Carroll Wayne \"Yunk\" Youngkin. His father played basketball for Duke University and worked in accounting and finance, while his mother was a doctorally prepared nurse practitioner who specialized in women's health and was also a professor of nursing and an associate dean for graduate studies at Florida Atlantic University.\n\nYoungkin has a sister, Dorothy Marian \"Dottie\" Youngkin Kouba, and was raised in a family that valued education and community service. When he was a teenager, the family moved from Richmond to Virginia Beach, where he attended Norfolk Academy, a private school in Norfolk, Virginia. He graduated from Norfolk Academy in 1985 and was honored for his achievements in basketball.\n\nCareer\n\nAfter graduating from Rice University in 1990, Youngkin joined the investment bank First Boston, where he worked on mergers and acquisitions and capital market financing. The company was later acquired by Credit Suisse and became Credit Suisse First Boston, and Youngkin left the firm in 1992 to pursue an MBA.\n\nYoungkin then joined the Washington, D.C.-based private equity firm The Carlyle Group, where he worked as a member of the US buyout team. In 1999, he was named a partner and managing director of Carlyle, and he managed the firm's United Kingdom buyout team from 2000 to 2005 and its global industrial sector investment team from 2005 to 2008.\n\nIn October 2017, Carlyle named Youngkin and Kewsong Lee as co-CEOs, effective January 1, 2018. Youngkin oversaw Carlyle's real estate, energy, infrastructure businesses, and investment solutions businesses, while Lee oversaw the firm's corporate private equity and global credit businesses.\n\n2021 Gubernatorial Election\n\nIn January 2021, Youngkin declared that he would seek the Republican Party of Virginia's nomination for governor of Virginia. His personal wealth allowed him to self-fund his candidacy, and he spent at least $5.5 million of his own money on his primary campaign. Youngkin was endorsed by Ted Cruz during the primary, and he had previously donated to Cruz's 2018 re-election campaign.\n\nGovernor of Virginia (2022-Present)\n\nYoungkin was sworn in as governor on January 15, 2022, alongside his Republican ticket mates, Lieutenant Governor Winsome Sears and Attorney General Jason Miyares. The Washington Post called this ticket \"historically diverse\" and reported that it was a sign of \"inroads\" made by the Republican Party in the African American and Latino communities.\n\nIn his first executive actions, Youngkin signed eleven executive orders, including one that banned the teaching of critical race theory in Virginia public schools. He established a tipline for parents to report \"divisive practices\" in schools and announced that he would \"catalogue\" and \"root out\" such practices.\n\nDay One Executive Actions\n\nYoungkin's executive order banning critical race theory was widely criticized by educators and civil rights leaders, who argued that it was an attempt to \"whitewash\" history and \"erase black history.\" The Washington Post noted that while critical race theory specifically refers to an academic framework that examines how policies and laws perpetuate systemic racism, the term has been reappropriated by conservatives as a catchall symbolizing schools' equity and diversity work.\n\nLawsuits\n\nYoungkin's executive order nullifying local public school mask mandates in Virginia was challenged in two lawsuits, one brought by a group of parents from Chesapeake and another by seven of the state's school boards. The lawsuits argued that Youngkin's executive order infringed upon local control given to Virginia school boards by the state constitution and violated a state law requiring that Virginia public schools comply with CDCP health guidelines.\n\nCabinet\n\nYoungkin began nominating his sixteen-member cabinet on December 20, 2021, but did not finish the process until after his inauguration. His cabinet included Angela Sailor, who was nominated for Chief Diversity Officer, a position established by Youngkin's immediate predecessor, Ralph Northam, in response to a scandal involving racist imagery on Northam's medical school yearbook page.\n\nAndrew Wheeler, Youngkin's initial nominee for Secretary of Natural Resources, was voted down on a party-line vote in the Democratic-controlled State Senate. Wheeler had served as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in the Trump administration and had worked as a coal lobbyist.\n\nTipline for \"Divisive Practices\"\n\nYoungkin set up an email tipline to receive reports about what he characterized as \"divisive practices\" in Virginia schools, which was introduced in a January 21, 2022, news release focused on Youngkin's executive order banning school mask mandates. Three days later, Youngkin discussed the tipline on a conservative radio show, where he said that parents should use the tipline to report \"any instances where they feel that their fundamental rights are being violated, where their children are not being respected, where there are inherently divisive practices in their schools.\"\n\nLoudoun County School Board Proposal\n\nDuring Virginia's 2022 legislative session, a bill concerning elections for the Loudoun County School Board was amended by Youngkin in an effort that, if successful, would have caused elections to be held a year in advance for seven of the board's nine members. Youngkin's proposed amendment was seen as an attempt to subvert the election results that had placed the board members in office, and it was opposed by Democrats, several political scientists, and the county school board itself.\n\nChange in Transgender Regulations\n\nIn September 2022, the Youngkin administration announced that it would be repealing regulations on transgender students in Virginia schools, which had been established through a bipartisan bill signed by Northam in 2020. The revised model policies, developed by the Virginia Department of Education under Youngkin, mandated that student access to school facilities and programs be determined by biological sex rather than by gender identity.\n\nTenure and Political Positions\n\nAbout a week after Youngkin's inauguration, All Things Considered likened Youngkin's political ideology to that of former President Donald Trump, writing that although Youngkin \"came to power as a sort of establishment Republican politician, a businessman who spoke to suburban families\" and who \"gave off...a dad-next-door image,\" his administration quickly began \"leaning into a lot of the same themes as the former president.\" A year into Youngkin's governorship, The Washington Post called him \"famous for being just Trumpy enough to woo MAGA Republicans without alienating more moderate voters.\"\n\nAbortion\n\nYoungkin describes himself as \"pro-life,\" but supports legal access to abortion in cases of rape, incest, or protecting the mother's life. During his gubernatorial campaign, he criticized the Texas Heartbeat Act, which bans abortions around the sixth week of pregnancy except for when needed to protect the life of the mother. At that time, Youngkin stated his preference for a \"pain threshold bill,\" which bans abortion at around twenty weeks.\n\nCOVID-19\n\nYoungkin supports the COVID-19 vaccination effort but opposes mask and vaccine mandates. He and his family are vaccinated, and in his first address to the General Assembly, he emphasized his position on the state's vaccination efforts by stating, \"Speaking to you as your governor, I'll never tell you what you must do. But speaking to you as your neighbor and a friend, I strongly encourage you to get the vaccine.\"\n\nCriminal Justice\n\nIn 2022, Youngkin signed a bill downscaling the Marcus alert system, which had been established by Northam about two years earlier in response to both the George Floyd protests of 2020 and the 2018 killing in Richmond of Marcus-David Peters. The legislation signed by Youngkin in 2022 exempted Virginia localities with populations of under 40,000 from having to adopt the Marcus alert system.\n\nSentence Credits\n\nYoungkin introduced an amendment to the 2022 state budget that limited the number of inmates who could qualify for an expanded early release program. The program allows inmates in Virginia to earn time off their sentences through good behavior credits. As this expansion of the program was originally designed, the newly available credits could not be used to reduce sentences for violent crimes but could be used by inmates convicted of violent crimes to reduce any concurrent or consecutive sentences that had been imposed for nonviolent crimes.\n\nEconomy\n\nDuring his campaign for governor, Youngkin frequently said that Virginia's economy was \"in the ditch.\" Some political scientists considered this an unusual position, since throughout the campaign, Virginia had low unemployment, a budget surplus, and a AAA bond rating. Youngkin argued against the merits of the CNBC rating, stating that it put too much emphasis on inclusivity and noting Virginia's poor ratings in the \"cost of living\" and \"cost of doing business\" categories.\n\nTaxes\n\nYoungkin's main proposal at the stage of the race was an elimination of Virginia's individual income tax, which received \"criticism from both Democrats and Republicans that doing so would wipe out around 70% of Virginia's General Fund.\" Before the end of his campaign, Youngkin retracted his proposal to eliminate the tax, calling it \"aspirational\" and saying, \"In Virginia, we can't get rid of income tax, but we sure can try to bring it down.\"\n\nAffordable Housing and Tenant Protections\n\nThe state budget signed by Youngkin in 2022 included a $150 million investment in the Virginia Housing Trust Fund, which is devoted to providing affordable housing in the state. This amounted to half the total Northam had proposed investing in the fund. Youngkin has said that he opposes any further investments in affordable housing.\n\nFailed Stadium Subsidy Plan\n\nIn 2023, Youngkin made public an agreement with Ted Leonsis, the owner of Washington Wizards and Washington Capitals, to move the teams to Alexandria, VA from downtown Washington D.C. As part of the agreement, Virginia taxpayers were set to pay $1.35 billion for new stadiums for the Wizards and Capitals in Alexandria, the largest public stadium subsidy of its kind. The agreement did not gain approval by Virginia state lawmakers or by local politicians in Alexandria, which doomed the project.\n\nEducation\n\nYoungkin's education platform was identified as the centerpiece of his campaign by much of the national media. He sought to mobilize voters on the issue by holding Parents Matter rallies. According to Politico, Youngkin \"hung his campaign on education.\" The New York Times wrote that Youngkin's campaign turned Virginia public schools into \"a cultural war zone,\" and a year after the election, The Washington Post wrote that Youngkin \"has leaned into culture wars in K-12 education.\"\n\nCultural Issues and Curriculum\n\nThroughout the campaign, Youngkin spoke against what he characterized as the pervasive teaching of critical race theory in the state. PolitiFact found this characterization of his to be false, saying it found no evidence that critical race theory was part of state curriculum standards and little evidence of it being taught in classrooms.\n\nEducation Budget\n\nYoungkin and McAuliffe both campaigned on increasing the education budget in Virginia, where teacher salaries had perpetually lagged behind the national average. Shortly before leaving office, outgoing governor Ralph Northam proposed increasing Virginia's biennial education budget from $14.8 billion to $17.2 billion, while McAuliffe's platform called for increasing the state's spending on education by $2 billion annually.\n\nCharter Schools and Lab Schools\n\nWhile running for governor, Youngkin voiced support for expanding charter schools in the state and set a goal of adding at least twenty during his term.

He supports climate change adaptation efforts such as building additional seawalls. While running for governor, Youngkin said he would not have signed Virginia's Clean Economy Act (which calls for Virginia's carbon emissions to reach net zero by 2050) because he believes it would increase utility prices.\n\nMarijuana\n\nDuring his governorship, Youngkin has consistently opposed various efforts to liberalize marijuana laws in Virginia.\n\nSame-Sex Marriage\n\nIn March 2024, Youngkin signed a bill codifying same-sex marriage in Virginia law. In 2006, voters amended the state's constitution to define marriage as heterosexual; if Obergefell v Hodges is overturned, the state constitution would need to be amended for the state law to take effect.\n\nElection Procedure\n\nAs governor, Youngkin has touted his work restoring voting rights to former felons, an effort that began under Governor Bob McDonnell and then intensified under McDonnell's immediate successors, McAuliffe and Northam. Virginia is one of only eleven states that does not automatically allow former felons to vote by the end of their sentences. An amendment to the state constitution that would have established automatic voting rights restoration for released felons in Virginia passed the legislature during Northam's final year in office, but amendments to the state constitution must be passed during two consecutive legislative sessions separated by an election before they can be voted on by the public in a referendum. Republicans in the House of Delegates voted against the amendment during Youngkin's first year in office.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nBefore taking office, Youngkin lived in Great Falls, Virginia, with his

15, 2022 He took office alongside his Republican ticket mates, Lieutenant Governor Winsome Sears, the first woman of color elected to statewide office in Virginia, and Attorney General Jason Miyares, the first Latino elected to statewide office in the state [105] The Washington Post called this ticket \"historically diverse\" [106] and reported that it was a sign of \"inroads\" made by the Republican Party \"in the African American and Latino communities.\" [107] Former Democratic Governor of Virginia Douglas Wilder commented after the election that Republicans had \"one-upped\" Democrats with the historic achievement, which, he said, showed that Democrats \"can't take the  [Black] community for granted.\" [107]\n\n\nInauguration\nYoungkin was sworn in as governor on January

Democrats with the historic achievement, which, he said, showed that Democrats \"can't take the  [Black] community for granted.\" [107]\n\n\nDay one executive actions\nAfter his inauguration, Youngkin signed eleven executive actions The first of these bans the teaching of what it calls \"inherently divisive concepts\" and identifies critical race theory as one such concept [114] [105] [115] In his executive order, Youngkin characterized critical race theory and related concepts as \"political indoctrination\" that \"instruct students to only view life through the lens of race and presumes that some students are consciously or unconsciously racist, sexist, or oppressive, and that other students are victims.\" [114] [116] The Washington Post noted that while critical race theory specifically refers to \"an academic framework that examines how policies and laws perpetuate systemic racism in the United States\", the term has been reappropriated by conservatives \"as a catchall symbolizing schools' equity and diversity work.\" [115] Youngkin's stance on critical race theory has been condemned by leaders of the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus, [115] [117] [118] and according to The Richmond Times-Dispatch, has \"alarmed many educators\" in the state [119] Youngkin's critics, the publication wrote, view the banning of critical race theory as an attempt to \"whitewash\" history and \"erase black history\" [119]\n\n\nLawsuits\nTwo lawsuits were brought in January against Youngkin's executive order nullifying local public school mask mandates in Virginia One of the lawsuits was brought by a group of parents from Chesapeake and the other was brought by seven of the state's school boards [123] [124] [125] The lawsuits argued that Youngkin's executive order infringed upon local control given to Virginia school boards by the state constitution and violated a state law requiring that Virginia public schools comply with CDCP health guidelines \"to the maximum extent practicable\" [125] [126] The ACLU, representing a group of medically vulnerable students in Virginia, brought an additional lawsuit in February, arguing that Youngkin's policy violated the Americans with Disabilities Act by discriminating against students who would be at high risk if infected by COVID-19 [127] Youngkin called on Virginia parents to cooperate with school principals while the lawsuits proceeded [123] [125]\n\n\nCabinet\nYoungkin began nominating his sixteen-member cabinet on December 20, 2021, and did not finish the process until after his inauguration [135] [136] [137] [138] According to The Washington Post, Youngkin assembled his cabinet at a slower pace than prior Virginia governors [139] [140] [141] Commenting on this process, the publication wrote in December 2021, \"The slow pace has turned the quadrennial parlor game of predicting Cabinet picks into a far more protracted and opaque process  [than usual], with lobbyists, interest groups and other Richmond insiders left guessing what the new administration might look like Youngkin's practice of sidestepping many policy specifics during the campaign has only heightened the anticipation.\" [139]\n\n\nChief Diversity Officer\nYoungkin finished his cabinet nominations on January 19, 2022, with his choice for chief diversity officer [138] This position was established by Youngkin's immediate predecessor, Ralph Northam, in response to a scandal involving racist imagery appearing on Northam's medical school yearbook page - a scandal that nearly caused Northam to resign from office The idea for a Chief Diversity Officer was born out of a commitment made by Northam to focus the remainder of his term on advancing racial equity in Virginia [136] [148] Youngkin did not nominate for Chief Diversity Officer until after his inauguration, [138] which led to media speculation that he would be eliminating the position [136] Youngkin's nominee for Chief Diversity Officer, Angela Sailor, was an executive at the Heritage Foundation and held multiple roles in George W Bush's presidential administration [138]\n\n\nAndrew Wheeler nomination\nYoungkin's initial nominee for Secretary of Natural Resources, Andrew Wheeler, was voted down on a party-line vote in the Democratic-controlled State Senate [150] [151] [152] [153] Wheeler had served as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in the Trump administration, and before that, worked as a coal lobbyist His tenure at the EPA was marked by reversals of environmental regulations that had been implemented by the Obama administration, and his nomination to serve in Youngkin's cabinet was heavily criticized by environmental advocates [141] [154] [155] A letter signed by 150 former EPA employees was sent to the Virginia legislature expressing opposition to Wheeler's nomination [150] [156]\n\n\nUnpaid advisors\nThe Youngkin administration has drawn notice from both The Washington Post and The Richmond Times-Dispatch for its use of Matthew Moran and Aubrey Layne as unpaid advisors [168] [169]\n\n\nTipline for \"divisive practices\"\nDuring his first week as governor, Youngkin set up an email tipline to receive reports about what he characterized as \"divisive practices\" in Virginia schools The tipline was introduced in a January 21, 2022 news release focused on Youngkin's executive order banning school mask mandates [171] [172] Three days later, Youngkin discussed the tipline on a conservative radio show, where he said that parents should use the tipline to report \"any instances where they feel that their fundamental rights are being violated, where their children are not being respected, where there are inherently divisive practices in their schools.\" [171] Speaking of the practices to be reported, he said on the radio show that his administration would \"catalogue it all\" and begin \"rooting it out\" [173]\n\n\nLoudoun County School Board proposal\nDuring Virginia's 2022 legislative session, a bill concerning elections for the Loudoun County School Board was amended by Youngkin in an effort that, if successful, would have caused elections to be held a year in advance for seven of the board's nine members [189] [190] [191] A spokesperson for Youngkin described the amendment as an attempt at \"holding  [the board] to account\" for their handling of two sexual assaults that had occurred in that county's school system a year earlier [189] Opposing the Loudoun County School Board over a variety of issues had been a major focus of Youngkin's gubernatorial campaign [189] [192] In response to Youngkin's proposed amendment, Democrats, several political scientists, and the county school board itself charged that Youngkin was attempting to subvert the election results that had placed the board members in office [165] [166] [167] [193] The Washington Post reported that Youngkin's effort had \"stunned many state political observers as an intrusion into local election integrity without modern precedent in Virginia.\" [189] The publication further wrote at the time that the amendment was one of the \"more controversial actions\" that Youngkin had taken [166] and led to \"one of the harshest partisan eruptions\" in the Virginia state legislature since the start of Youngkin's term [167] Legal scholar A.E Dick Howard argued that the amendment was likely in violation of Virginia's Constitution, which Howard had helped to write in the 1970s [189] The proposed amendment passed in the Republican-controlled House of Delegates but was defeated in the Democratic-controlled State Senate [167] [189] [191] [193]\n\n\nChange of transgender regulations\nIn September 2022, the Youngkin administration announced that it would be repealing regulations on transgender students in Virginia schools These had been established through a bipartisan bill signed by Northam in 2020 That bill required that policies pertaining to transgender students be in compliance throughout all school districts with \"model policies\" developed by the Virginia Department of Education Under Northam, these model policies had mandated that students be allowed access to school facilities and nonathletic school programs corresponding with their gender identity; the policies deferred to the Virginia High School League in matters pertaining to transgender student athletes The policies also mandated that all school staff use the preferred name and pronoun of each student Under Youngkin, the model policies were revised by the Virginia Department of Education to mandate that student-access to school facilities and programs be determined by biological sex rather than by gender identity; the policy revisions introduced under Youngkin also mandate that legal documentation be provided before school records can reflect a change in a student's name or gender and that a written request by a parent be provided before school staff can refer to a student by that student's preferred name or pronoun; even after such a request has been submitted by a parent, Youngkin's policies do not require school staff to comply with parental preferences when addressing students It has been suggested [by whom?] that Youngkin's policies may require teachers to out students to their parents, as the policies state that schools cannot \"encourage or instruct teachers to conceal material information about a student from the student's parent, including information related to gender.\" [194]\n\n\nTenure and political positions\nAbout a week after Youngkin's inauguration, All Things Considered likened Youngkin's political ideology to that of former President Donald Trump, writing that although Youngkin \"came to power as a sort of establishment Republican politician, a businessman who spoke to suburban families\" and who \"gave off ..  [a] dad-next-door image\", his administration quickly began \"leaning into a lot of the same themes as the former president\" [202] A year into Youngkin's governorship, The Washington Post called Youngkin \"famous for being just Trumpy enough to woo MAGA Republicans without alienating more moderate voters\" [203] The newspaper summed up Youngkin's political style by calling him \"a genial but aggressive culture warrior who has treaded cautiously with Trump and cozied up to election deniers.\" [204] As governor, Youngkin subjected many executive branch positions to litmus tests on abortion, critical race theory, and transgender policies [151] Politico described Youngkin's tenure as \"something of a disappointment but was a .. dike in a left-turning state.\" [6]\n\n\nAbortion\nAbortion in Virginia remains legal up to the end of the second trimester of a pregnancy Youngkin describes himself as \"pro-life,\" but supports legal access to abortion in cases of rape, incest, or protecting the mother's life [206] During his gubernatorial campaign, he criticized the Texas Heartbeat Act, which bans abortions around the sixth week of pregnancy except for when needed to protect the life of the mother At that time, Youngkin stated his preference for a \"pain threshold bill\", which bans abortion at around twenty weeks [207] [208] However, in July 2021 while running for governor, he was caught on a hot mic telling an activist that he would \"start going on offense\" against abortion rights if elected governor but would largely avoid the topic until then, saying \"as a campaign topic, sadly, that in fact won't win my independent votes that I have to get.\" [209] [210]\n\n\nCOVID-19\nYoungkin supports the COVID-19 vaccination effort but opposes mask and vaccine mandates [223] He and his family are vaccinated [224] In his first address to the General Assembly, he emphasized his position on the state's vaccination efforts by stating, \"Speaking to you as your governor, I'll never tell you what you must do But speaking to you as your neighbor and a friend, I strongly encourage you to get the vaccine.\" [117]\n\n\nCriminal justice\nIn 2022, Youngkin signed a bill downscaling the Marcus alert system, which had been established by Northam about two years earlier in response to both the George Floyd protests of 2020 and the 2018 killing in Richmond of Marcus-David Peters [257] [258] [259] [260] Wherever implemented, the Marcus alert system requires that mental health professionals be involved in responding to any mental health crises reported to 911 [261] Certain localities in Virginia began adopting the system in late 2021 When signed into law by Northam, the system was required to be implemented statewide by July 2026 [260] The legislation signed by Youngkin in 2022 exempts Virginia localities with populations of under 40,000 from having to adopt the Marcus alert system This exemption applies to about 67% of Virginia localities and over 19% of the state's population It was adopted due to concerns about the cost of implementing the system statewide [262] [263]\n\n\nPolicing\nIn 2022, Youngkin signed a bill downscaling the Marcus alert system, which had been established by Northam about two years earlier in response to both the George Floyd protests of 2020 and the 2018 killing in Richmond of Marcus-David Peters [257] [258] [259] [260] Wherever implemented, the Marcus alert system requires that mental health professionals be involved in responding to any mental health crises reported to 911 [261] Certain localities in Virginia began adopting the system in late 2021 When signed into law by Northam, the system was required to be implemented statewide by July 2026 [260] The legislation signed by Youngkin in 2022 exempts Virginia localities with populations of under 40,000 from having to adopt the Marcus alert system This exemption applies to about 67% of Virginia localities and over 19% of the state's population It was adopted due to concerns about the cost of implementing the system statewide [262] [263]\n\n\nSentence credits\nAn amendment that Youngkin introduced to the 2022 state budget limited the number of inmates who could qualify for an expanded early release program that was scheduled to begin later that summer The program allows inmates in Virginia to earn time off their sentences through good behavior credits It had been expanded through legislation signed in 2020 by Youngkin's predecessor, Ralph Northam, so that Virginia's cap on how many good behavior credits could be earned was raised for most inmates As this expansion of the program was originally designed, the newly available credits could not be used to reduce sentences for violent crimes but could be used by inmates convicted of violent crimes to reduce any concurrent or consecutive sentences that had been imposed for nonviolent crimes Youngkin and other Republicans characterized this aspect of the program as an unintentional loophole that needed correcting Democrats largely disagreed with that characterization, arguing that the expanded program had been intentionally designed to give violent offenders the ability to reduce sentences unrelated to violent offenses Youngkin's amendment was adopted by the General Assembly along mostly party lines It made inmates convicted of violent crimes fully ineligible for the expanded program, meaning that these inmates could not use the newly available credits to reduce any sentences [218] [272] [273] [274] [275]\n\n\nEconomy\nDuring his campaign for governor, Youngkin frequently said that Virginia's economy was \"in the ditch\" [277] [278] [279] Some political scientists, such as Mark Rozell, considered this an unusual position, since throughout the campaign, Virginia had low unemployment, a budget surplus, and a AAA bond rating The state had also been rated that year by CNBC as the Top State for Business Youngkin argued against the merits of the CNBC rating, stating that it put too much emphasis on inclusivity and noting Virginia's poor ratings in the \"cost of living\" and \"cost of doing business\" categories [277] During Youngkin's first year in office, Virginia lost its top spot on the CNBC list, after having earned that spot twice in a row during Northam's governorship The lower ranking under Youngkin was due to Virginia earning worse scores in the \"life, health and inclusion\" and \"workforce\" categories [280]\n\n\nTaxes\nThe Washington Post noted that more than two months after winning the Republican nomination, Youngkin had \"yet to disclose any formal economic plan.\" [277] One of Youngkin's main proposals at that stage of the race was an elimination of Virginia's individual income tax [281] [277] According to NPR, this proposal received \"criticism from both Democrats and Republicans that doing so would wipe out around 70% of Virginia's General Fund.\" [282] Before the end of his campaign, Youngkin retracted his proposal to eliminate the tax, [281] [282] calling it \"aspirational\" [281] and saying, \"In Virginia, we can't get rid of income tax, but we sure can try to bring it down.\" [282]\n\n\nAffordable housing and tenant protections\nThe state budget signed by Youngkin in 2022 included a $150 million investment in the Virginia Housing Trust Fund, which is devoted to providing affordable housing in the state [291] This amounted to half the total Northam had proposed investing in the fund According to WVTF, a Virginia NPR affiliate, the state would need to invest $5 billion annually to fully address its affordable housing needs [299] Youngkin has said that he opposes any further investments in affordable housing [300]\n\n\nFailed stadium subsidy plan\nIn 2023, Youngkin made public an agreement with Ted Leonsis, the owner of Washington Wizards and Washington Capitals, to move the teams to Alexandria, VA from downtown Washington D.C As part of the agreement, Virginia taxpayers were set to pay $1.35 billion for new stadiums for the Wizards and Capitals in Alexandria, the largest public stadium subsidy of its kind [302] The agreement did not gain approval by Virginia state lawmakers or by local politicians in Alexandria, which doomed the project [303]\n\n\nEducation\nYoungkin's education platform was identified as the centerpiece of his campaign by much of the national media, [94] [304] [305] [306] [307] [308] and he sought to mobilize voters on the issue by holding Parents Matter rallies [305] [306] According to Politico, Youngkin \"hung his campaign on education\" [308] The New York Times wrote that Youngkin's campaign turned Virginia public schools into \"a cultural war zone\", [306] and a year after the election, The Washington Post wrote that Youngkin \"has leaned into culture wars in K-12 education\" [309] Noting his stances on how schools approach race, transgender students, and pandemic policies, the publication wrote that Youngkin \"has continued to center those issues in office\" [310]\n\n\nCultural issues and curriculum\nThroughout the campaign, Youngkin spoke against what he characterized as the pervasive teaching of critical race theory in the state [94] [304] [305] [306] [308] PolitiFact found this characterization of his to be false, saying it found no evidence that critical race theory was part of state curriculum standards and little evidence of it being taught in classrooms [311] The publication wrote, \"Critical race theory is being widely discussed by educators across Virginia But there's a difference between educators learning about the theory and actually teaching it to students.\" [311]\n\n\nEducation budget\nYoungkin and McAuliffe both campaigned on increasing the education budget in Virginia, [304] where teacher salaries had perpetually lagged behind the national average [344] [345] Shortly before leaving office, outgoing governor Ralph Northam proposed increasing Virginia's biennial education budget from $14.8 billion to $17.2 billion, [346] while McAuliffe's platform called for increasing the state's spending on education by $2 billion annually [304] [347] The two Democrats sought to focus their proposed spending increases on raising teacher salaries, expanding preschool to disadvantaged children, investing more in both STEM programs and ESL services, ensuring internet access for all students, and closing the state's achievement gaps [304] [346] [347]\n\n\nCharter schools and lab schools\nWhile running for governor, Youngkin voiced support for expanding charter schools in the state and set a goal of adding at least twenty during his term [283] [284] After the election, The Richmond-Times Dispatch reported that Youngkin's actual goal for charter schools would be to increase the number in Virginia \"to match North Carolina, which has more than 200.\" [143] Only seven charter schools currently exist in Virginia, [355] one of the lowest amounts in the country, [284] and Youngkin has backed proposed legislation that would shift the authority to approve new charter schools from local school boards to newly created \"regional charter school divisions\" These divisions would have nine voting members, eight appointed by the Virginia State Board of Education, and one appointed by local school boards within the region [356]\n\n\nEnvironment\nAsked if he accepts the scientific consensus on the causes of climate change, Youngkin said he does not know what causes climate change and that he considers the cause to be irrelevant [365] He supports climate change adaptation efforts such as building additional seawalls [365] [366] While running for governor, Youngkin said he would not have signed Virginia's Clean Economy Act (which calls for Virginia's carbon emissions to reach net zero by 2050) because he believes it would increase utility prices [365] Youngkin is in favor of what he calls an \"all of the above approach\" to energy, saying that he supports both renewable energy sources and natural gas [367] He has called for Virginia to become a world leader in nuclear energy, proposing that a small modular reactor be built in Southwest Virginia within the next decade [368]\n\n\nMarijuana\nDuring his governorship, Youngkin has consistently opposed various efforts to liberalize marijuana laws in Virginia [372]\n\n\nSame-sex marriage\nIn March 2024, Youngkin signed a bill codifying same-sex marriage in Virginia law [385] [386] In 2006, voters amended the state's constitution to define marriage as heterosexual; if Obergefell v Hodges is overturned, the state constitution would need to be amended for the state law to take effect [387] [386]\n\n\nElection procedure\nAs governor, Youngkin has touted his work restoring voting rights to former felons, an effort that began under Governor Bob McDonnell and then intensified under McDonnell's immediate successors, McAuliffe and Northam Virginia is one of only eleven states that does not automatically allow former felons to vote by the end of their sentences An amendment to the state constitution that would have established automatic voting rights restoration for released felons in Virginia passed the legislature during Northam's final year in office, but amendments to the state constitution must be passed during two consecutive legislative sessions separated by an election before they can be voted on by the public in a referendum, and Republicans in the House of Delegates voted against the amendment during Youngkin's first year in office [388] In 2023, it was reported that Youngkin and his Secretary of the Commonwealth had quietly reversed course from their predecessors, reinstating procedural hurdles to the franchise restoration process and dramatically decreasing the number of ex-felons granted the franchise The administration responded that reviewing applications on a case-by-case basis was in-line with the state constitution but did not specify the criteria being considered [389] [390]\n\n\nPersonal life\nBefore taking office, Youngkin lived in Great Falls, Virginia, with his wife Suzanne and their four children [393]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal

He was born on 31 August 1569 in Fatehpur Sikri, the capital city of the Mughal Empire. Jahangir's early life was marked by significant events that would shape his future as a ruler.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nPrince Salim was the third son born to Akbar and Mariam-uz-Zamani in the capital city of Fatehpur Sikri on 31 August 1569. He had two elder twin brothers, Hassan and Hussain Mirza, born in 1564, both of whom died in infancy. Grief-struck, Akbar took Mariam-uz-Zamani along with him after their sons' demise as he set out for a war campaign, and, during his return to Agra, he sought the blessings of Salim Chishti, a reputed khawaja (religious leader) who lived at Fatehpur Sikri. Akbar confided in Salim Chisti, who assured him that he would be soon delivered of three sons who would live up to a ripe old age. A few years before the birth of Prince Salim, Akbar and Mariam-uz-Zamani went on a pilgrimage to Ajmer Sharif Dargah to pray for a son.\n\n**Family**\n\nThe ancestral lineage of Jahangir was traced from the House of Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire. His family had a significant influence on his life and reign, particularly his wife, Nur-Jahan, who played a crucial role in his decision-making.\n\n**Reign**\n\nJahangir succeeded the throne on Thursday, 3 November 1605, eight days after his father's death. Salim ascended the throne with the imperial grand title of Nuruddin Muhammad Jahangir Badshah Ghazi and thus began his 22-year reign at the age of 36. During his reign, Jahangir faced several challenges, including the loss of Qandahar to the Persians and the rebellion of his son, Shah Jahan.\n\n**Death**\n\nA lifelong user of opium and wine, Jahangir was frequently ill in the 1620s. He was trying to restore his health by visiting Kashmir and Kabul, but he decided to return to Lahore because of a severe cold. Jahangir's health continued to deteriorate, and he passed away on 28 October 1627, marking the end of his reign.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nJahangir was famous for his \"Chain of Justice,\" a golden chain with golden bells that was designed to facilitate complaints and appeals from his subjects. In his memoir, Tuzk-e-Jahangiri, he wrote that he ordered the creation of this chain for his subjects to appeal to the emperor if they were denied justice at any level. Jahangir was also known for his love of art and architecture, and he commissioned several court painters, including Ustad Mansur, to paint detailed pieces that accompanied his vivid prose.\n\n**Religious View**\n\nJahangir generally continued the religious policy of Akbar and had a major interest in pantheism. He believed in the unity of God and the interconnectedness of all living beings. Jahangir's religious views were influenced by his wife, Nur-Jahan, who was a practicing Shia Muslim.\n\n**Art**\n\nJahangir was fascinated with art and architecture, and he commissioned several court painters to create detailed pieces that accompanied his vivid prose. In his autobiography, the Jahangirnama, Jahangir recorded events that occurred during his reign, descriptions of flora and fauna that he encountered, and other aspects of daily life. Jahangir also designed a type of exclusive clothing called \"Nadiri,\" which was reserved for his personal use and esteemed courtiers.\n\n**Politics**\n\nJahangir is widely considered to have been a weak and incapable ruler. He made no addition to the imperial territories, but on the contrary, diminished them by losing Qandahar to the Persians. His greatest fault as a king was his subservience to his wife, Nur-Jahan, and the consequent quarrel with his son, Shah Jahan, who was the ablest and best of his male children. Jahangir's peaceful temper or laziness may have saved much bloodshed, but it also led to a decline in the power and influence of the Mughal Empire.\n\n**Popular Culture**\n\nJahangir has been featured in several films and television shows, including the Indian TV series \"Jodha Akbar\" and the Pakistani TV series \"Tum Kon Piya.\" He has also been the subject of several books and articles, including \"The Tuzk-e-Jahangiri\" and \"Jahangir and the Jesuits: An Account of the Jesuit Missions to India in the Year 1610.\"\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Mughal Empire\n* Akbar\n* Nur-Jahan\n* Shah Jahan\n* Tuzk-e-Jahangiri\n* Jahangirnama\n* Nadiri\n* Ustad Mansur\n\n**External Links**\n\n* \"Jahangir\" at the Encyclopedia Britannica\n* \"Jahangir\" at the Mughal Empire website\n* \"Jahangir and the Jesuits\" at the Jesuit Missions website\n\n**References**\n\n* \"The Tuzk-e-Jahangiri\" by Jahangir\n* \"Jahangirnama\" by Jahangir\n* \"Jahangir and the Jesuits\" by Henry Beveridge\n* \"The Mughal Empire\" by John F.

2001‚Äì02 season alternated between the bench and starter's role He scored his first goal for the club on 13 October in a 2‚Äì2 draw against Lyon, converting the equalizing penalty in the 79th minute after having come on ten minutes prior [39] After returning from the winter break, Ronaldinho went on a tear, scoring a goal in four consecutive matches to open the new campaign He recorded impressive

the club's 2‚Äì0 win over Metz on 27 April [41]\n\n\n2002‚Äì03 season\nDespite repeated rifts with Fern√°ndez, Ronaldinho returned to the team for the 2002‚Äì03 season, with the player switching to the number 10 shirt Although his performances in his second season with the club were underwhelming compared to his first, Ronaldinho performed admirably with the club On 26 October 2002, he scored two goals in PSG's 3‚Äì1 victory over Classique rivals Marseille The first goal was a free kick, which curled past numerous Marseille players in the 18-yard box before sailing past goalkeeper Vedran

fourth with a step over (dropping his shoulder, moving right but going left) and finished by lifting the ball over the goalkeeper [35]\n\n\nBarcelona\n\"Ronaldinho was responsible for the change in Bar√ßa It was a bad time and the change that came about with his arrival was amazing.\"\n\n\n2003‚Äì04 season\nAt the club where he would spend his peak years and the basis of his global fame, [48] Ronaldinho made his Barcelona debut in a friendly against Juventus at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts on 27 July, with coach Frank Rijkaard stating post match, \"He has something special every time he touches the ball.\" [49] He scored his first competitive goal in La Liga on 3 September 2003 against Sevilla at 1.30 a.m local time, in a match that kicked off at five minutes past midnight [50] After receiving the ball from his goalkeeper inside his own half, Ronaldinho ran through the midfield and dribbled past two Sevilla players before striking the ball from 30 yards which hammered off the underside of the crossbar and back up into the roof of the net [50] Ronaldinho suffered from injury during the first half of the campaign, [51] and Barcelona slumped to 12th in the league standings midway through the season Ronaldinho returned from injury and scored 15 goals in La Liga during the 2003‚Äì04 season, helping the team ultimately finish second in the league [52] [53] His scooped pass set up the winning goal for Xavi away to Real Madrid on 25 April 2004, the club's first win at the Bernab√©u in seven years, a result Xavi credits as the start of \"the Barcelona rise\" [54]\n\n\n2004‚Äì05 season\nRonaldinho won his first league title in 2004‚Äì05, and was named FIFA World Player of the Year on 20 December 2004 [55] His captain at Barcelona, Carles Puyol, stated, \"The greatest compliment I could give him is that he's given Barcelona our spirit back He has made us smile again.\" [54] Ronaldinho's fame grew due to his entertaining and productive play in both the La Liga and the UEFA Champions League On 8 March 2005, Barcelona were eliminated from the latter competition by Chelsea in the first knockout round, losing 5‚Äì4 over two legs [56] Ronaldinho scored both goals in the 4‚Äì2 second leg loss at Stamford Bridge in London, the second a spectacular strike where he feinted to shoot before striking the ball with little back-lift past Chelsea goalkeeper Petr ƒåech from 20 yards out [56]\n\n\n2005‚Äì06 season\nBy the end of the year 2005, Ronaldinho had started to accumulate a host of personal awards He won the inaugural FIFPro World Player

Player of the Year for the second consecutive year [55] He became only the third player to win the award more than once, after three-time winners Ronaldo and Zinedine Zidane [55] His domination as the world's best footballer was undisputed as he also won the prestigious Ballon d'Or for the only time in his career [60] [61]\n\n\n2006‚Äì07 season\n\"When you play with him and see what he does with a ball, nothing surprises me any more One of these days, he will make the ball talk.\"\n\n\n2007‚Äì08 season\nRonaldinho played his 200th career match for Barcelona in a league match against Osasuna on 3 February 2008 His 2007‚Äì08 campaign as a whole, however, was plagued by injuries, and a muscle tear in his right leg on 3 April prematurely ended his season [79] Having been a model professional and devoted himself to training during his hugely successful first three seasons at Barcelona, Ronaldinho's partying lifestyle and lack of dedication to training saw his physical condition decline, with many at the club believing he was already below his prime [80] [81] On 19 May 2008, Barcelona club president Joan Laporta stated that Ronaldinho needed a \"new challenge\", claiming that he needed a new club if he were to revive his career [82]\n\n\nAC Milan\nIn July 2008, Ronaldinho turned down a ¬£25.5¬†million offer from Manchester City of the Premier League, with purported wages of ¬£200,000 per week on offer, [86] to join Italian Serie A giants AC Milan on a three-year contract thought to be worth around ¬£5.1¬†million (‚Ç¨6.5¬†million) a year, for ‚Ç¨22.05 million plus ‚Ç¨1.05 million bonus each season (‚Ç¨24.15 million in 2010) [87] [88] [89] [90] With the number 10 already occupied by teammate Clarence Seedorf, he selected 80 as his jersey number [91]\n\n\n2008‚Äì09

match-winner against Braga in the UEFA Cup group stage on 6 November [80] Ronaldinho finished the 2008‚Äì09 season at Milan with 10 goals from 32 appearances in all competitions After a good start to the season, Ronaldinho struggled with fitness, and was often played from the bench to end a disappointing first season for Milan [80] A perceived lack of dedication in training and a lifestyle of late night partying not befitting of an athlete saw him receive criticism, with Carlo Ancelotti, his coach at Milan in his first season in Italy, commenting, \"The decline of Ronaldinho hasn't surprised me His physical condition has always been very precarious His talent though has never been in question.\" [80]\n\n\n2009‚Äì10 season\nRonaldinho's second season did not begin on a high note, but he soon rediscovered his form and was arguably Milan's best player of the season Newly appointed coach Leonardo changed his role from a central attacking midfielder to the left side of midfield, with Alexandre Pato on the right, in an offensive 4‚Äì3‚Äì3 formation [92]\n\n\n2010‚Äì11 season\nDuring the first half of the season, Ronaldinho was part of the team's attack that also included two new

his childhood club Gr√™mio, Ronaldinho joined Flamengo on 11 January 2011 with a contract ending in 2014 [97] During the transfer saga, many reports had linked the former World Player of the Year to

unveiling at his new club on 13 January 2011 [98]\n\n\nAtl√©tico Mineiro\nRonaldinho made a move to Atl√©tico Mineiro on 4 June 2012 in a six-month contract, just four days after leaving Flamengo He wore number 49 in reference to his mother's birth year since his preferred number 10 was already assigned to Guilherme in the 2012 season [102]\n\n\nQuer√©taro\nAfter becoming a free agent, Ronaldinho was offered contracts from English Conference South club Basingstoke Town and newly formed Indian Super League franchise Chennai Titans through their co-owner Prashant Agarwal, [110] [111] [112] but eventually signed a two-year contract with Mexican club Quer√©taro on 5 September 2014 [113] [114] Ronaldinho made his debut for Quer√©taro in a 1‚Äì0 loss to Tigres UANL where he missed a penalty

October 2014, he scored a free kick against Atlas during an away match at the Estadio Jalisco [117]\n\n\nFluminense\nOn 11 July 2015, Ronaldinho announced his return to Brazil and signed an 18-month contract with Fluminense, [124] but on 28 September, Ronaldinho reached a mutual agreement with the club to terminate the deal [125] He made nine appearances during his two-month stint at the club, failing to impress and being heavily criticized by the fans [126] Fluminense sporting director Mario Bittencourt stated, \"Ronaldinho asked us for a meeting He respectfully told us he didn't feel he was able to perform as well as he wanted and that it was a bad situation for him He made a great gesture in saying he wasn't being the player he felt he could be right now I'll never speak about whether or not he is retiring That's not something you say about a player of his calibre He was always spectacular, as player and person.\" [126]\n\n\nFutsal in India\nIn July 2016, Ronaldinho played for the Goa 5‚Ä≤s, a futsal team from Goa in India, together with Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, M√≠chel Salgado, and Hern√°n Crespo as well as futsal player Falc√£o in the Premier Futsal League [127] After two games, he left India to be an ambassador of the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro [128] He was replaced by Cafu [129]\n\n\nRetirement\nOn 16 January 2018, Ronaldinho confirmed his retirement from football through his brother/agent: \"He has stopped, it is ended Let's do something pretty big and nice after the Russia World Cup, probably in August.\" [131] Such a celebration was supposed to take place three years after his last appearance for Fluminense, but has not materialized [131] He retired as one of just eight players to have won the FIFA World Cup, the UEFA Champions League and the Ballon d'Or [132]\n\n\nInternational career\nIn 1997, Ronaldinho was part of the first Brazilian team to win the FIFA U-17 World Championship, which was held in Egypt, in which his

during Brazil's victorious Copa Am√©rica campaign One week after the conclusion of the Copa Am√©rica, he was called up for the 1999 FIFA Confederations Cup, in which he scored in every match except the final, including a hat-trick in an 8‚Äì2 semi-final rout of Saudi Arabia [137] In the final, Brazil lost 4‚Äì3 to Mexico Ronaldinho won the Golden Ball award for the best player in tournament as well as the Golden Boot award for the tournament top-scorer [137]\n\n\n2002 World Cup glory\nOn the eve of the final, Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho warmed up in the Yokohama Stadium by merrily trying to out-wizard each other in the Japanese drizzle.\n\n\n2005 Confederations Cup title\nRonaldinho's next international tournament was the 2003 Confederations Cup, in which he went scoreless as Brazil were eliminated in the group stage The following year, he was dropped from Brazil's 2004 Copa Am√©rica squad, as coach Carlos Alberto Parreira decided to rest his stars and used a largely reserve squad [147]\n\n\n2006 World Cup\nFor the 2006 World Cup finals, Ronaldinho was part of Brazil's much-publicized \"magic quartet\" of offensive players alongside Adriano, Ronaldo and Kak√°, which was expected to provide the \"Joga Bonito\" style of play that was the focus of an extensive advertising campaign by Nike leading up to the tournament [150] However, deemed \"top heavy and unbalanced\", the team finished with ten goals in five games, with Ronaldinho himself going scoreless and finishing with only one assist (for Gilberto's goal in a 4‚Äì1 group stage victory over Japan), as he turned in his worst collective performance in his international career [150] Brazil endured a disappointing campaign that culminated in a 1‚Äì0 loss to France in the quarter-finals, during which the Sele√ß√£o had only one shot on goal [151]\n\n\n2008 Olympic medal\nOn 24 March 2007, Ronaldinho scored twice in a 4‚Äì0 win over Chile, which marked his first goal since the 2005 Confederations Cup final and thus ended a scoreless streak that lasted nearly two years [155] He was not called up for the 2007 Copa Am√©rica after asking to be excused from the tournament due to fatigue [156] On 18 October, he was controversially benched by Barcelona after he was late returning to Spain following Brazil's 5‚Äì0 friendly win over Ecuador He and several Brazil players

named in coach Dunga's final squad of 23 for the Brazilian squad in South Africa for the 2010 World Cup [162] despite his deep desire to participate in the competition [163] Critics claimed that the exclusion of players such as Ronaldinho, Alexandre Pato, Adriano and Ronaldo signaled a move away from the classic Brazilian attacking \"Joga Bonito\" style of play [162] At the tournament, Brazil was eliminated by the Netherlands in the quarter-final [164]\n\n\nPlayer profile\nRonaldinho is regarded as one of the greatest and most skilful players of all time [172] [173] [174] [175] [176] Due to

capable of playing as a second striker [183]\n\n\nStyle of play\nRonaldinho is regarded as one of the greatest and most skilful players of all time [172] [173] [174] [175] [176] Due to his ability to

Runje In the return match, he again scored in PSG's 3‚Äì0 victory at the Stade V√©lodrome, running half the length of the field before flicking the ball over the goalkeeper [42] On 22 February 2003, Ronaldinho scored the goal of the season (chosen by public vote) against Guingamp‚Äîhe beat one opponent before playing a one-two to beat another, then lifted the ball over a third before beating a fourth with a step over (dropping his shoulder, moving right but going left) and finished by lifting the ball over the goalkeeper [35]\n\n\nBarcelona\n\"Ronaldinho was responsible for the change in Bar√ßa It was a bad time and the change that came about with his arrival was amazing.\"\n\n\n2003‚Äì04 season\nAt the club where he would spend his peak years and the basis of his global fame, [48] Ronaldinho made his Barcelona debut in a friendly against Juventus at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts on 27 July, with coach Frank Rijkaard stating post match, \"He has something special every time he touches the ball.\" [49] He scored his first competitive goal in La Liga on 3 September 2003 against Sevilla at 1.30 a.m local time, in a match that kicked off at five minutes past midnight [50] After receiving the ball from his goalkeeper inside his own half, Ronaldinho ran through the midfield and dribbled past two Sevilla players before striking the ball from 30 yards which hammered off the underside of the crossbar and back up into the roof of the net [50] Ronaldinho suffered from injury during the first half of the campaign, [51] and Barcelona slumped to 12th in the league standings midway through the season Ronaldinho returned from injury and scored 15 goals in La Liga during the 2003‚Äì04 season, helping the team ultimately finish second in the league [52] [53] His scooped pass set up the winning goal for Xavi away to Real Madrid on 25 April 2004, the club's first win at the Bernab√©u in seven years, a result Xavi credits as the start of \"the Barcelona rise\" [54]\n\n\n2004‚Äì05 season\nRonaldinho won his first league title in 2004‚Äì05, and was named FIFA World Player of the Year on 20 December 2004 [55] His captain at Barcelona, Carles Puyol, stated, \"The greatest compliment I could give him is that he's given Barcelona our spirit back He has made us smile again.\" [54] Ronaldinho's fame grew due to his entertaining and productive play in both the La Liga and the UEFA Champions League On 8 March 2005, Barcelona were eliminated from the latter competition by Chelsea in the first knockout round, losing 5‚Äì4 over two legs [56] Ronaldinho scored both goals in the 4‚Äì2 second leg loss at Stamford Bridge in London, the second a spectacular strike where he feinted to shoot before striking the ball with little back-lift past Chelsea goalkeeper Petr ƒåech from 20 yards out [56]\n\n\n2005‚Äì06 season\nBy the end of the year 2005, Ronaldinho had started to accumulate a host of personal awards He won the inaugural FIFPro World Player of the Year in September 2005, in addition to being included in the 2005 FIFPro World XI, and being named the 2005 European Footballer of the Year Also that year, Ronaldinho was voted the FIFA World Player of the Year for the second consecutive year [55] He became only the third player to win the award more than once, after three-time winners Ronaldo and Zinedine Zidane [55] His domination as the world's best footballer was undisputed as he also won the prestigious Ballon d'Or for the only time in his career [60] [61]\n\n\n2006‚Äì07 season\n\"When you play with him and see what he does with a ball, nothing surprises me any more One of these days, he will make the ball talk.\"\n\n\n2007‚Äì08 season\nRonaldinho played his 200th career match for Barcelona in a league match against Osasuna on 3 February 2008 His 2007‚Äì08 campaign as a whole, however, was plagued by injuries, and a muscle tear in his right leg on 3 April prematurely ended his season [79] Having been a model professional and devoted himself to training during his hugely successful first three seasons at Barcelona, Ronaldinho's partying lifestyle and lack of dedication to training saw his physical condition decline, with many at the club believing he was already below his prime [80] [81] On 19 May 2008, Barcelona club president Joan Laporta stated that Ronaldinho needed a \"new challenge\", claiming that he needed a new club if he were to revive his career [82]\n\n\nAC Milan\nIn July 2008, Ronaldinho turned down a ¬£25.5¬†million offer from Manchester City of the Premier League, with purported wages of ¬£200,000 per week on offer, [86] to join Italian Serie A giants AC Milan on a three-year contract thought to be worth around ¬£5.1¬†million (‚Ç¨6.5¬†million) a year, for ‚Ç¨22.05 million plus ‚Ç¨1.05 million bonus each season (‚Ç¨24.15 million in 2010) [87] [88] [89] [90] With the number 10 already occupied by teammate Clarence Seedorf, he selected 80 as his jersey number [91]\n\n\n2008‚Äì09 season\nRonaldinho scored his first goal for Milan in a 1‚Äì0 derby victory over Inter Milan on 28 September His first brace was in a 3‚Äì0 win over Sampdoria on 19 October He scored a 93rd-minute match-winner against Braga in the UEFA Cup group stage on 6 November [80] Ronaldinho finished the 2008‚Äì09 season at Milan with 10 goals from 32 appearances in all competitions After a good start to the season, Ronaldinho struggled with fitness, and was often played from the bench to end a disappointing first season for Milan [80] A perceived lack of dedication in training and a lifestyle of late night partying not befitting of an athlete saw him receive criticism, with Carlo Ancelotti, his coach at Milan in his first season in Italy, commenting, \"The decline of Ronaldinho hasn't surprised me His physical condition has always been very precarious His talent though has never been in question.\" [80]\n\n\n2009‚Äì10 season\nRonaldinho's second season did not begin on a high note, but he soon rediscovered his form and was arguably Milan's best player of the season Newly appointed coach Leonardo changed his role from a central attacking midfielder to the left side of midfield, with Alexandre Pato on the right, in an offensive 4‚Äì3‚Äì3 formation [92]\n\n\n2010‚Äì11 season\nDuring the first half of the season, Ronaldinho was part of the team's attack that also included two new signings, Zlatan Ibrahimoviƒá and Robinho Before the winter break, he made 16 appearances, scored one goal, and made several assists [96]\n\n\nFlamengo\nAfter being heavily linked with a move back to his childhood club Gr√™mio, Ronaldinho joined Flamengo on 11 January 2011 with a contract ending in 2014 [97] During the transfer saga, many reports had linked the former World Player of the Year to joining different clubs, such as LA Galaxy of Major League Soccer, Blackburn Rovers of the Premier League, and Brazilian clubs Corinthians and Palmeiras He was greeted by more than 20,000 fans at his unveiling at his new club on 13 January 2011 [98]\n\n\nAtl√©tico Mineiro\nRonaldinho made a move to Atl√©tico Mineiro on 4 June 2012 in a six-month contract, just four days after leaving Flamengo He wore number 49 in reference to his mother's birth year since his preferred number 10 was already assigned to Guilherme in the 2012 season [102]\n\n\nQuer√©taro\nAfter becoming a free agent, Ronaldinho was offered contracts from English Conference South club Basingstoke Town and newly formed Indian Super League franchise Chennai Titans through their co-owner Prashant Agarwal, [110] [111] [112] but eventually signed a two-year contract with Mexican club Quer√©taro on 5 September 2014 [113] [114] Ronaldinho made his debut for Quer√©taro in a 1‚Äì0 loss to Tigres UANL where he missed a penalty kick [115] In his next match, however, against Guadalajara, he had a much better game, setting up Camilo Sanvezzo to score as well as scoring himself from a penalty kick in a 4‚Äì1 win [116] On 30 October 2014, he scored a free kick against Atlas during an away match at the Estadio Jalisco [117]\n\n\nFluminense\nOn 11 July 2015, Ronaldinho announced his return to Brazil and signed an 18-month contract with Fluminense, [124] but on 28 September, Ronaldinho reached a mutual agreement with the club to terminate the deal [125] He made nine appearances during his two-month stint at the club, failing to impress and being heavily criticized by the fans [126] Fluminense sporting director Mario Bittencourt stated, \"Ronaldinho asked us for a meeting He respectfully told us he didn't feel he was able to perform as well as he wanted and that it was a bad situation for him He made a great gesture in saying he wasn't being the player he felt he could be right now I'll never speak about whether or not he is retiring That's not something you say about a player of his calibre He was always spectacular, as player and person.\" [126]\n\n\nFutsal in India\nIn July 2016, Ronaldinho played for the Goa 5‚Ä≤s, a futsal team from Goa in India, together with Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, M√≠chel Salgado, and Hern√°n Crespo as well as futsal player Falc√£o in the Premier Futsal League [127] After two games, he left India to be an ambassador of the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro [128] He was replaced by Cafu [129]\n\n\nRetirement\nOn 16 January 2018, Ronaldinho confirmed his retirement from football through his brother/agent: \"He has stopped, it is ended Let's do something pretty big and nice after the Russia World Cup, probably in August.\" [131] Such a celebration was supposed to take place three years after his last appearance for Fluminense, but has not materialized [131] He retired as one of just eight players to have won the FIFA World Cup, the UEFA Champions League and the Ballon d'Or [132]\n\n\nInternational career\nIn 1997, Ronaldinho was part of the first Brazilian team to win the FIFA U-17 World Championship, which was held in Egypt, in which his first goal was a penalty against Austria in the first group match, which Brazil won 7‚Äì0 [134] Ronaldinho finished with two goals and was awarded the Bronze Ball award as Brazil scored a total of 21 goals while only conceding 2 [134]\n\n\nYouth teams\nIn 1997, Ronaldinho was part of the first Brazilian team to win the FIFA U-17 World Championship, which was held in Egypt, in which his first goal was a penalty against Austria in the first group match, which Brazil won 7‚Äì0 [134] Ronaldinho finished with two goals and was awarded the Bronze Ball award as Brazil scored a total of 21 goals while only conceding 2 [134]\n\n\nEarly success\nOn 26 June, three days before the start of the 1999 Copa Am√©rica, he earned his first cap for Brazil in a 3‚Äì0 win over Latvia, and he scored one goal during Brazil's victorious Copa Am√©rica campaign One week after the conclusion of the Copa Am√©rica, he was called up for the 1999 FIFA Confederations Cup, in which he scored in every match except the final, including a hat-trick in an 8‚Äì2 semi-final rout of Saudi Arabia [137] In the final, Brazil lost 4‚Äì3 to Mexico Ronaldinho won the Golden Ball award for the best player in tournament as well as the Golden Boot award for the tournament top-scorer [137]\n\n\n2002 World Cup glory\nOn the eve of the final, Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho warmed up in the Yokohama Stadium by merrily trying to out-wizard each other in the Japanese drizzle.\n\n\n2005 Confederations Cup title\nRonaldinho's next international tournament was the 2003 Confederations Cup, in which he went scoreless as Brazil were eliminated in the group stage The following year, he was dropped from Brazil's 2004 Copa Am√©rica squad, as coach Carlos Alberto Parreira decided to rest his stars and used a largely reserve squad [147]\n\n\n2006 World Cup\nFor the 2006 World Cup finals, Ronaldinho was part of Brazil's much-publicized \"magic quartet\" of offensive players alongside Adriano, Ronaldo and Kak√°, which was expected to provide the \"Joga Bonito\" style of play that was the focus of an extensive advertising campaign by Nike leading up to the tournament [150] However, deemed \"top heavy and unbalanced\", the team finished with ten goals in five games, with Ronaldinho himself going scoreless and finishing with only one assist (for Gilberto's goal in a 4‚Äì1 group stage victory over Japan), as he turned in his worst collective performance in his international career [150] Brazil endured a disappointing campaign that culminated in a 1‚Äì0 loss to France in the quarter-finals, during which the Sele√ß√£o had only one shot on goal [151]\n\n\n2008 Olympic medal\nOn 24 March 2007, Ronaldinho scored twice in a 4‚Äì0 win over Chile, which marked his first goal since the 2005 Confederations Cup final and thus ended a scoreless streak that lasted nearly two years [155] He was not called up for the 2007 Copa Am√©rica after asking to be excused from the tournament due to fatigue [156] On 18 October, he was controversially benched by Barcelona after he was late returning to Spain following Brazil's 5‚Äì0 friendly win over Ecuador He and several Brazil players celebrated the win by partying through the night at a posh Rio de Janeiro nightclub Ronaldinho left at 11¬†am the next morning, allegedly in the trunk of a car in order to avoid the media [157]\n\n\n2010 and 2014 World Cup absence\nDespite having returned to good form and being named as a member of the 30-man provisional squad that was submitted to FIFA on 11 May 2010, [161] he was not named in coach Dunga's final squad of 23 for the Brazilian squad in South Africa for the 2010 World Cup [162] despite his deep desire to participate in the competition [163] Critics claimed that the exclusion of players such as Ronaldinho, Alexandre Pato, Adriano and Ronaldo signaled a move away from the classic Brazilian attacking \"Joga Bonito\" style of play [162] At the tournament, Brazil was eliminated by the Netherlands in the quarter-final [164]\n\n\nPlayer profile\nRonaldinho is regarded as one of the greatest and most skilful players of all time [172] [173] [174] [175] [176] Due to his ability to score and create goals, he was capable of playing in several attacking positions [177] [178] Throughout his career, he was often deployed as a winger, although he usually played as a classic number 10 in an attacking midfielder role [178] [179] While he is naturally right-footed, during his time at Barcelona, Ronaldinho was also used as an inverted winger on the left flank at times by manager Frank Rijkaard, while the left-footed Messi was deployed on the right; this position allowed him to cut inside and shoot on goal with his stronger foot [180] [181] [182] He was also capable of playing as a second striker [183]\n\n\nStyle of play\nRonaldinho is regarded as one of the greatest and most skilful players of all time [172] [173] [174] [175] [176] Due to his ability to

second striker [183]\n\n\nReception\nESPN described Ronaldinho as being \"skillful by nature, his tricks are unparalleled and he is wonderful with the ball at his feet One of the coolest players in pressure situations\" and a \"fast, brash, skilful, tricky, an uninhibited playmaker\" who provides \"a mix of goals, assists, skills and a large repertoire of crafty moves\" [198] Zlatan Ibrahimoviƒá stated, \"Prime Ronaldinho was phenomenal He made his opponents look like children.\" [199] Former Portugal midfield playmaker Rui Costa has said of his vision and passing ability: \"There are not many players who can offer goal-scoring passes like he can He is just marvellous He is a rare case of an assist man who can provide the ball from anywhere.\" [198] In 2010, his former Barcelona teammate, Edgar Davids, said of him: \"For the skills and tricks, Ronaldinho was the best player that I ever played with.\" [200] Another one of his former Barcelona teammate, Henrik Larsson, echoed this view [200] His compatriot Willian rated him as the greatest player of all time in 2019, [201] while Juninho described him as the most skilful player he had ever seen In 2019, FourFourTwo described him as \"possibly the best technician in the history of football in Brazil\", placing him at number five in their list of \"The 101 greatest football players of the last 25 years\" [202] In 2006, Richard Williams of The Guardian described Ronaldinho as a \"genius\", while his former Barcelona teammate Sylvinho said of him: \"He's so smart, so intelligent, that sometimes it's difficult to read his mind\", also adding: \"He's amazing He's 100% talent And he's a powerful player as well, so it's difficult to stop him.\" [181]\n\n\nOutside football\nRonaldinho has had endorsements with many companies, including Nike, Pepsi, Coca-Cola, EA Sports and Danone [63] [204] One of the world's highest paid players, in 2006 he earned over $19¬†million from endorsements [205] Having endorsed

ultimately decided to reduce the fine from R$8.5 million to R$6 million for building a fishing platform on Gua√≠ba River in a 'heritage-protected' area [229] Ronaldinho and his brother would ultimately fail to pay the fines within the allotted time and have their passports suspended [230]\n\n\nCareer statistics\nRonaldinho made 853 appearances and scored 328 goals for club and country

Kingdom riots were a series of protests and violent disturbances that took place across England and Northern Ireland in the summer of 2024. The riots were sparked by a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed children's yoga and dance workshop in Southport, Merseyside, on 29 July 2024. The attack resulted in the deaths of three children and injuries to eight others, including five in critical condition.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe riots began on 30 July 2024, when hundreds of protesters gathered outside Southport Mosque, chanting slogans such as \"No surrender!\" and \"English till I die!\" Within minutes, protesters clashed with police, and the situation quickly escalated into violence.

Puente and her siblings were subsequently sent to an orphanage, where she was sexually abused.\n\nPuente's early life was marked by instability and trauma. She was forced to fend for herself from a young age, often living on the streets or in foster care. This experience would later contribute to her development as a con artist and a serial killer.

In January 1982, Puente met McKenzie in a bar and accompanied him back to his apartment.

for a single club [186] On 5 February 2023, Tottenham stated that Kane had become their all-time top scorer, overtaking Jimmy Greaves with his 267th goal for Tottenham and 200th in the Premier League, in a 1‚Äì0 home victory against Manchester City [187] This fact was disputed, however, as Tottenham do not count the two goals Greaves scored in the 1962 FA Charity Shield, which would put him on 268

in the 2023 DFL-Supercup [214] He scored his first goal for the club on the opening day of the 2023‚Äì24 Bundesliga season, also providing the assist for Leroy San√©'s early opener, as Bayern won

caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which attacks the body‚Äôs immune system AIDS was first identified in mid-1981, as doctors in Los Angeles and New York City noticed a series of clusters of unusual infections, specifically Kaposi's sarcoma and Pneumocystis pneumonia, in sexually active gay men, diseases which are normally only found in immunocompromised patients [1] The disease was initially known as GRID (gay-related immune deficiency), and for a short period as the \"4H disease\" for \"Homosexuals, Heroin addicts, Hemophiliacs and Haitians\" as the predominately affected groups As HIV has the ability to infect any person, AIDS had taken over as the term of choice by mid-1982 [2]\n\n\nRonald Reagan\nRonald Reagan was a successful actor in the 1940s and 50s, and entered politics in 1966 to run for the seat of Governor of California, a position which he won and subsequently served in from 1967 to 1975 In 1967, while Reagan was in his first year in office as Governor, two close advisors of Reagan, Richard Quinn  and Phil Battaglia (his chief of staff), were outed as gay in an article by Jack Anderson Reagan had campaigned on ending \"moral decline\", and as many in this period viewed consorting with homosexual men as counter to this goal, Reagan chose to fire the men rather than face political backlash [9] [10] [11] However, Reagan was reportedly privately outraged that the sex lives of private citizens was considered to be newsworthy material [9] In 1978, three years after leaving the governorship, Reagan publicly opposed the Briggs Initiative, which would have banned gay men and lesbian women from teaching in California public schools; his opposition was key to the defeat of the initiative [9] Reagan and his wife after 1952, Nancy, were also friends with a number of openly gay men, as well as men whose homosexuality was an open secret, such as Roy Cohn, Jerry Zipkin, Truman Capote, and Ted Graber Nancy in particular had many gay men in her inner circle, and at one point the Reagans even invited Graber to spend a night at the White House along with his partner [10] [12]\n\n\nPre-presidential views on homosexuality\nRonald Reagan was a successful actor in the 1940s and 50s, and entered politics in 1966 to run for the seat of Governor of California, a position which he won and subsequently served in from 1967 to 1975 In 1967, while

Graber Nancy in particular had many gay men in her inner circle, and at one point the Reagans even invited Graber to spend a night at the White House along with his partner [10] [12]\n\n\n1980 Presidential election\nRonald Reagan was elected as President of the United States on November 4, 1980, and took office on January 20, 1981 The evangelical group Christians for Reagan, organized by Christian Voice, paid for a barrage of ads in Southern states during the final weeks of the election that attacked Reagan's opponent Jimmy Carter for what they described as his gay-friendly views [10] [13] The conservative Christian movement Moral Majority, led by Jerry Falwell, also backed Reagan, running television ads, fundraising and registration drives on his behalf [14] In the end, Reagan won two-thirds of the white evangelical vote [15] (a voting bloc Carter had won in the 1976 Presidential election) [16] and swept every Southern state save for Carter's home state of Georgia, with white evangelical voters greatly favoring Reagan even in comparison to conservative congressional candidates [10] [14]\n\n\nReagan administration response\nOn October 15, 1982, the White House answered its first question about the AIDS crisis, [17] marking the first official statement from the White House on AIDS [10] At a regular White House press briefing, reporter Lester Kinsolving asked a question about AIDS, leading to the following exchange with White House Press Secretary Larry Speakes:\n\n\nEmergence of AIDS\nOn October 15, 1982, the White House answered its first question about the AIDS crisis, [17] marking the first official statement from the White House on AIDS [10] At a regular White House press briefing, reporter Lester Kinsolving asked a question about AIDS, leading to the following exchange with White House Press Secretary Larry Speakes:\n\n\nFirst mention by the White House\nOn October 15, 1982, the White House answered its first question about the AIDS crisis, [17] marking the first official statement from the White House on AIDS [10] At a regular White House press briefing, reporter Lester Kinsolving asked a question about AIDS, leading to the following exchange with White House Press Secretary Larry Speakes:\n\n\nSubsequent questions from Kinsolving\nKinsolving, despite being personally against homosexuality, continued to press Speakes on the AIDS issue over the following years On June 12, 1983, a second exchange on the topic of AIDS occurred between Kinsolving and Speakes, in which Speakes said that the President was \"briefed on the AIDS situation a number of months ago\", the first public indication that Reagan was aware of the AIDS epidemic [10] [18] As part of that same exchange, Speakes also jokingly insinuated that Kinsolving was gay himself, saying at a mention of fairy tales that \"Lester's ears perked up when you said fairy.\" [19] [20]\n\n\n1983 meetings\nOn June 21, 1983, Reagan held a meeting with the National Gay Task Force representatives Virginia Apuzzo and Jeff Levi, alongside members of his own administration, including staff from the Department of Health and Human Services [24] This marked the first time the Reagan administration had met with representatives of the LGBT community [25] The meeting was described as a \"get-acquainted\" meeting, and discussed concerns about the AIDS epidemic and basic solutions to it, such as encouraging condom usage to mitigate spread [25] [26]\n\n\n1984 Election\nIn the 1984 Presidential Election, Reagan was re-elected as president, defeating Democratic challenger Walter Mondale in a landslide election His support among evangelicals increased compared to 1980, as he won 78% of the evangelical vote, a group among whom many held antipathy for homosexuals and those with AIDS [31] Neither Mondale nor Reagan made any public statement on the AIDS during the campaign, and no reporter raised the issue with the candidates [32]\n\n\nFunding for AIDS treatment and research\nOne of the major priorities of the Reagan administration was to slash the federal budget in all areas except the military, part of an economic policy which came to be known as Reaganomics, and public health agencies such as the CDC and NIH were no exception to these cuts [33] In the early 1980s, Reagan's director of the Office of Management and Budget, David Stockman, targeted public health agencies for massive cuts [33] One such cut proposed slashing the budget for immunization by half, but was stopped by opposition from members of Congress Henry Waxman and Pete Domenici [33] In 1981, as part of the push to stop immunization cuts, Waxman sent one of his staffers to the CDC headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia While the staffer was there, they were put in contact with James W Curran, the leader of the CDC's AIDS task force [33] Though Curran was initially hesitant to enlist congressional help for fear of alienating the gay community, many of whom were distrustful of the government, he later contacted Waxman in 1982 to work with him on AIDS research funding Waxman would become one of the main congressional voices advocating for increased AIDS funding [33]\n\n\nDeath of Rock Hudson\nOn May 15, 1984, Rock Hudson, a prominent movie star of the Golden Age of Hollywood and an acquaintance of the Reagans, attended a White House State Dinner for Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid with the Reagans Hudson was gay but deeply closeted to the public, as his career was made on playing heartthrobs in heterosexual romance films [40] At the dinner, First Lady Nancy Reagan noticed that Hudson looked gaunt, and when she sent him photos from the dinner, she urged him to get a doctor to look at the red blotch on his neck [12] When Hudson went for a checkup on June 5, 1984, doctors identified the blotch as Kaposi's sarcoma, and Hudson tested as HIV-positive [41]\n\n\nDiagnosis\nOn May 15, 1984, Rock Hudson, a prominent movie star of the Golden Age of Hollywood and an acquaintance of the Reagans, attended a White House State Dinner for Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid with the Reagans Hudson was gay but deeply closeted to the public, as his career was made on playing heartthrobs in heterosexual romance films [40] At the dinner, First Lady Nancy Reagan noticed that Hudson looked gaunt, and when she sent him photos from the dinner, she urged him to get a doctor to look at the red blotch on his neck [12] When Hudson went for a checkup on June 5, 1984, doctors identified the blotch as Kaposi's sarcoma, and Hudson tested as HIV-positive [41]\n\n\nHudson's plea\nAt the time Hudson was diagnosed, treatments for AIDS were still in their infancy, and even trials were unavailable in the United States [12] In 1985, as his disease worsened, Hudson travelled to Paris, where he sought to seek treatment from Dominique Dormant, a French Army doctor who had secretly treated him for AIDS in the fall of 1984 with HPA-23 [44] [45] After his collapse at the Ritz Hotel on July 21, 1985, Hudson was admitted to the American Hospital of Paris; Dormant, however, was working at a military hospital and was denied permission to admit Hudson, as Hudson was not a French citizen Further, Dormant was at first not even able to enter the American Hospital to see Hudson [44]\n\n\nEffects\nIt was commonly accepted now, among the people who had understood the threat for many years, that there were two clear phases to the disease in the United States: there was AIDS before Rock Hudson and AIDS after.\n\n\nReagan acknowledges AIDS\nOn September 17, 1985, less than two months after Hudson had come forward with his AIDS diagnosis, Reagan publicly acknowledged AIDS for the first time when he was asked a question about it by a reporter at a presidential press conference [54] Since the CDC first announced the emergence of AIDS in 1981, more than 5,000 people had died from the disease, [20] and thirty presidential news briefings had passed without Reagan being asked about AIDS [54]\n\n\nKoop Report\nOn February 6, 1986, Reagan began his administration's first significant initiative against AIDS when he declared finding a cure for AIDS to be \"one of our highest public health priorities\" and ordered Surgeon General C Everett Koop to assemble a \"major report\" on AIDS [59] [60] According to historian Jennifer Brier, administration officials including Bauer and Bennett believed that Koop, a conservative Presbyterian, would write a report that would emphasize morality and sex only within the confines of heterosexual marriage as the solution to AIDS [61] According to Koop, he had previously been \"cut off\" from discussions on AIDS, starting in 1981 [62] Henry Waxman, then the chair of the United States House Energy Subcommittee on Health and an AIDS advocate, criticized the Reagan administration's requisitioning of the report, accusing them of playing a \"shell game\" with federal funding as he noted that the same day, the Reagan administration had also proposed a budget which included a $51¬†million cut to AIDS funding for the following fiscal year [59]\n\n\nCommissioning and creation\nOn February 6, 1986, Reagan began his administration's first significant initiative against AIDS when he declared finding a cure for AIDS to be \"one of our highest public health priorities\" and ordered Surgeon General C Everett Koop to assemble a \"major report\" on AIDS [59] [60] According to historian Jennifer Brier, administration officials including Bauer and Bennett

proposed a budget which included a $51¬†million cut to AIDS funding for the following fiscal year [59]\n\n\nContents\nThe 36-page report was released on  October 22, 1986, and was an immediate bombshell [64] The report projected that 270,000 Americans would contract HIV/AIDS and 179,000 would die from it by 1991 At the suggestion of Fauci, the report was unsparing in its language, describing the methods of transmission of AIDS through \"semen and vaginal fluids\" during \"oral, anal and vaginal intercourse\", while also correcting common myths about AIDS, such as the ability to contract it from saliva or mosquito bites [64] [63] While Koop acknowledged that abstinence was the only way to guarantee AIDS prevention, he also suggested teaching safe sex, specifically the use of condoms, to stymie its spread [64] He also argued that since \"information and education are the only weapons against AIDS\", education about the disease needed to begin as early as possible, specifically citing third grade (8- and 9-year-olds) as the age at which he would like to begin educating students on AIDS [65] Koop also wrote that sex education needed to contain information on both heterosexual and homosexual sex Further, he advocated for confidential, optional testing to encourage those at risk to get tested, as the groups which were at the highest risk of AIDS, such as queer people and drug users, were often societally marginalized [65] This went against a popular conservative position of the time held by some conservatives in the White House including Bauer, which was to require mandatory testing for those at risk, as well as a public registrar of people with AIDS [60]\n\n\nReactions\nThe scientific community's response to the report was mixed, with some criticizing it as \"confirming what the president wanted to hear\" [62] The Reagan administration itself was also \"lukewarm\" on the report according to medical historian Jonathan Engel, who writes that the Watkins commission \"surprised almost everybody\" [62]\n\n\nSpeech at the American Foundation for AIDS Research\nIn the spring of 1987, Elizabeth Taylor, a longtime friend of Nancy Reagan, co-star and confidant of Rock Hudson, and the national chairperson of the American Foundation for AIDS Research (amFAR), invited President Reagan to speak to speak at an amFAR fundraising dinner, which would precede a massive scientific conference on AIDS [72] At the urging of Nancy, Reagan accepted the offer, and began preparing for what would be his first speech on the subject of AIDS [d] [73] [74] Landon Parvin, an outside consultant and Nancy's favorite among Reagan's speechwriters, was brought in to write the speech, as the Reagans were aware that the audience would likely be hostile [72] [73]\n\n\nPresident's Commission on the HIV Epidemic\nOn June 24, 1987, Reagan issued Executive Order 12601, creating the Presidential Commission on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Epidemic to investigate HIV/AIDS [79] Quickly, the Reagan administration was inundated with suggestions for committee members from across the political spectrum [80] Senator Strom Thurmond proposed Paul Cameron, a psychologist from Nebraska who wanted to institute a \"rolling quarantine\" of homosexuals, and Gary Bauer suggested William F Buckley, a right-wing publicist who proposed to permanently tattoo all people who tested positive for AIDS, on the arm if they were drug users and on the buttocks if they were gay [80] Other nominees included Stephen Herbits, [e] Eunice Kennedy Shriver, Barbara Jordan, and Bob Bauman [f] [12] [80]\n\n\nCreation of the commission and membership\nOn June 24, 1987, Reagan issued Executive Order 12601, creating the Presidential Commission on the Human Immunodeficiency

Shriver, Barbara Jordan, and Bob Bauman [f] [12] [80]\n\n\nReport\nThe Watkins Commission report (officially titled Report of the Presidential Commission on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Epidemic) was released on June 27, 1988 The report was unflinching in its assessment of the Reagan administration's response to that point, describing a \"lack of leadership\" as one of the biggest obstacles to progress against AIDS [84] [85] The Watkins Commission report also made a number of policy suggestions, many of which overlapped with the suggestions in the Koop Report In total, the 203-page report makes 579 specific recommendations for fighting AIDS, [85] including:\n\n\nReactions\nThe scientific community's response to the report was mixed, with some criticizing it as \"confirming what the president wanted to hear\" [62] The Reagan administration itself was also \"lukewarm\" on the report according to medical historian Jonathan Engel, who writes that the Watkins commission \"surprised almost everybody\" [62]\n\n\nReagan's personal views\nReagan was a devout Christian, and personally held the belief that homosexuality was a sin In early 1987, Reagan had a discussion on the AIDS epidemic with his biographer, Edmund Morris, in which Reagan commented, \"maybe the Lord brought down this plague\" because \"illicit sex is against the Ten Commandments\" [91] Journalist Lou Cannon argued Reagan did not bear hostile feelings to gay persons but did consider being gay \"a sad thing\" [92] Biographer H W Brands concluded that Reagan was personally \"more tolerant\" of gay people \"than many in his generation\", citing his opposition of the California Briggs Initiative, but nevertheless \"catered, if not pandered\" to the homophobic elements of the American Republican Party of which he was a member [93] According to John Hutton, one of Reagan's personal physicians, when private citizens would ask Reagan what should be done about AIDS, he would often respond that \"money might not be the answer\" and that \"perhaps people are supposed to modify their behaviors\" [53]\n\n\nAdvocacy by Nancy and Ron Reagan\nReagan's wife, Nancy, and his son, Ron, were both privately sympathetic to LGBT movements, and attempted at various points to lobby Reagan to do more about the AIDS crisis [40] Nancy had long had many gay men in her circle of friends, and Ron knew people who were suffering from AIDS from his time ballet dancing in New York City's Joffrey Ballet [12] In 1987, Ron's disagreements with his father's policies began to cross from private into the public sphere In July 1987, Ron starred in a television commercial criticizing his father's administration for its inaction on the AIDS pandemic In the commercial, Ron urged the audience: \"The U.S government isn't moving fast enough to stop the spread of AIDS Write to your congressman,\" before adding with a smile, \"or someone higher up.\" [98] He also appeared in a 30-minute public service announcement on AIDS, which was shown on PBS, in which he taught the audience how to use a condom and spermicide and encourages viewers to use them [98] These public disagreements frustrated the elder Reagan, who wrote in his diary on July 18, 1987, that he disagreed with his son's stances, complaining that \" [Ron] can be stubborn on a couple of issues & won't listen to anyone's argument.\" [98]\n\n\nMeeting with Elizabeth Glaser\nIn June 1988, a friend of the Reagans put them in contact with AIDS advocate Elizabeth Glaser Glaser had unknowingly contracted HIV through a blood transfusion when she was giving birth to her first child in 1981 and had inadvertently given it to both of her children, Ariel, born in 1981, and Jake, born in 1984 [99] Although a few treatments, such as AZT, were available for AIDS treatment by that point, none of them were approved for use in children Glaser believed that as a white heterosexual woman and a mother of two AIDS-stricken children, she may be able to change the Reagans' views on AIDS more effectively than LGBT activists, and so she reached out to a mutual friend who put her in contact with the Reagans [99]\n\n\nPost-presidency\nReagan's second term as president ended on January 20, 1989, when his Vice President George H.W Bush was sworn in as his successor In 1989, the Reagans called Elizabeth Glaser to give their condolences after Glaser's daughter, Ariel, passed away from AIDS complications [103] In 1990, Reagan appeared in an AIDS PSA with Glaser in which he offered what was described by Karen Tumulty as tacit regret for his administration's handling of the AIDS crisis, as he says in the PSA: \"I'm not asking you to send money I'm asking you for something more important: your understanding Maybe it's time we all learned something new.\" [103] Reagan also headlined a fundraiser in 1990 for Glaser's organization, the Pediatric AIDS Foundation At the fundraiser, Reagan was asked by a reporter if he wished his administration had done more about AIDS, to which he responded, \"We did all that we could at the time.\" [104]\n\n\nTimeline\nThrough the lack of both policy and financial support, the United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) was severely handicapped during the early years of the AIDS epidemic Senior staff of the Reagan Administration did not understand the essential role of Government in disease prevention Although CDC clearly documented the dangers of HIV and AIDS early in the epidemic, refusal by the White House to deliver prevention programs then certainly allowed HIV to become more widely seeded.\n\n\nLegacy\nThrough the lack of both policy and financial support, the United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) was severely handicapped during the early years of the AIDS

epidemic, refusal by the White House to deliver prevention programs then certainly allowed HIV to become more widely seeded.\n\n\nGay rights movement\nThe Reagan administration's perceived neglect of the AIDS crisis ignited a wave of LGBT advocacy [123] Scholars of the topic, including Ilan Meyer, have written that the AIDS crisis \"raised the stakes\" for LGBT people to secure rights and access to healthcare [124] The crisis also forged new solidarity between men who have sex with men and women who have sex with women, as the experience in organizing queer women had gained in fighting for reproductive rights were crucial in facilitating AIDS advocacy groups for queer men [124]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nOn April 21, 1985, playwright Larry Kramer debuted his autobiographical play The Normal Heart, a major subject of which is the lack of attention given to AIDS by the American public and the Reagan administration [106] The play was adapted into a 2014 film of the same name starring Mark Ruffalo [106] [108] Randy Shilts's book And the Band Played On was also adapted into a 1994 HBO television film of the same name, starring Matthew Modine as Don Francis The television series Pose, which debuted in 2018, is set in part during the Reagan years, and deals with the AIDS crisis in New York City's ball culture of the 1980s and 1990s The show's characters are critical of Reagan and his response to AIDS; in the first season episode \"The Fever\", the character Prayerful \"Pray\" Tell, a gay man, says of Reagan and the AIDS crisis: \"I know that Ronald Reagan will not say the

human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), was first identified in the United States in 1981. The disease quickly spread, and by the mid-1980s, it had become a major public health crisis. President Ronald Reagan, who was in office from 1981 to 1989, played a significant role in shaping the government's response to the epidemic. While Reagan's administration provided some funding and support for AIDS research and treatment, critics argue that the government's response was inadequate and slow.\n\n**Background**\n\n**HIV/AIDS**\n\nAcquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a disease characterized by a greatly weakened or destroyed immune system, caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which attacks the body's immune system. AIDS was first identified in mid-1981, as doctors in Los Angeles and New York City noticed a series of clusters of unusual infections, specifically Kaposi's sarcoma and Pneumocystis pneumonia, in sexually active gay men, diseases which are normally only found in immunocompromised patients. The disease was initially known as GRID (gay-related immune deficiency), and for a short period as the \"4H disease\" for \"Homosexuals, Heroin addicts, Hemophiliacs and Haitians\" as the predominantly affected groups. As HIV has the ability to infect any person, AIDS had taken over as the term of choice by mid-1982.\n\n**Ronald Reagan**\n\nRonald Reagan was a successful actor in the 1940s and 50s, and entered politics in 1966 to run for the seat of Governor of California, a position which he won and subsequently served in from 1967 to 1975. In 1967, while Reagan was in his first year in office as Governor, two close advisors of Reagan, Richard Quinn and Phil Battaglia (his chief of staff), were outed as gay in an article by Jack Anderson. Reagan had campaigned on ending \"moral decline\", and as many in this period viewed consorting with homosexual men as counter to this goal, Reagan chose to fire the men rather than face political backlash. However, Reagan was reportedly privately outraged that the sex lives of private citizens was considered to be newsworthy material. In 1978, three years after leaving the governorship, Reagan publicly opposed the Briggs Initiative, which would have banned gay men and lesbian women from teaching in California public schools; his opposition was key to the defeat of the initiative.\n\n**Pre-presidential views on homosexuality**\n\nRonald Reagan was a successful actor in the 1940s and 50s, and entered politics in 1966 to run for the seat of Governor of California, a position which he won and subsequently served in from 1967 to 1975.

In 1978, three years after leaving the governorship, Reagan publicly opposed the Briggs Initiative, which would have banned gay men and lesbian women from teaching in California public schools; his opposition was key to the defeat of the initiative. Reagan and his wife after 1952, Nancy, were also friends with a number of openly gay men, as well as men whose homosexuality was an open secret, such as Roy Cohn, Jerry Zipkin, Truman Capote, and Ted Graber. Nancy in particular had many gay men in her inner circle, and at one point the Reagans even invited Graber to spend a night at the White House along with his partner.\n\n**1980 Presidential election**\n\nRonald Reagan was elected as President of the United States on November 4, 1980, and took office on January 20, 1981. The evangelical group Christians for Reagan, organized by Christian Voice, paid for a barrage of ads in Southern states during the final weeks of the election that attacked Reagan's opponent Jimmy Carter for what they described as his gay-friendly views. The conservative Christian movement Moral Majority, led by Jerry Falwell, also backed Reagan, running television ads, fundraising and registration drives on his behalf. In the end, Reagan won two-thirds of the white evangelical vote, a group among whom many held antipathy for homosexuals and those with AIDS.\n\n**Reagan administration response**\n\nOn October 15, 1982, the White House answered its first question about the AIDS crisis, marking the first official statement from the White House on AIDS. At a regular White House press briefing, reporter Lester Kinsolving asked a question about AIDS, leading to the following exchange with White House Press Secretary Larry Speakes. Despite being personally against homosexuality, Reagan was reportedly privately outraged that the sex lives of private citizens was considered to be newsworthy material. In 1978, three years after leaving the governorship, Reagan publicly opposed the Briggs Initiative, which would have banned gay men and lesbian women from teaching in California public schools; his opposition was key to the defeat of the initiative.\n\n**1983 meetings**\n\nOn June 21, 1983, Reagan held a meeting with the National Gay Task Force representatives Virginia Apuzzo and Jeff Levi, alongside members of his own administration, including staff from the Department of Health and Human Services. This marked the first time the Reagan administration had met with representatives of the LGBT community. The meeting was described as a \"get-acquainted\" meeting, and discussed concerns about the AIDS epidemic and basic solutions to it, such as encouraging condom usage to mitigate spread.\n\n**1984 Election**\n\nIn the 1984 Presidential Election, Reagan was re-elected as president, defeating Democratic challenger Walter Mondale in a landslide election. His support among evangelicals increased compared to 1980, as he won 78% of the evangelical vote, a group among whom many held antipathy for homosexuals and those with AIDS. Neither Mondale nor Reagan made any public statement on the AIDS during the campaign, and no reporter raised the issue with the candidates.\n\n**Funding for AIDS treatment and research**\n\nOne of the major priorities of the Reagan administration was to slash the federal budget in all areas except the military, part of an economic policy which came to be known as Reaganomics, and public health agencies such as the CDC and NIH were no exception to these cuts. In the early 1980s, Reagan's director of the Office of Management and Budget, David Stockman, targeted public health agencies for massive cuts. One such cut proposed slashing the budget for immunization by half, but was stopped by opposition from members of Congress Henry Waxman and Pete Domenici. In 1981, as part of the push to stop immunization cuts, Waxman sent one of his staffers to the CDC headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. While the staffer was there, they were put in contact with James W Curran, the leader of the CDC's AIDS task force. Though Curran was initially hesitant to enlist congressional help for fear of alienating the gay community, many of whom were distrustful of the government, he later contacted Waxman in 1982 to work with him on AIDS research funding.\n\n**Death of Rock Hudson**\n\nOn May 15, 1984, Rock Hudson, a prominent movie star of the Golden Age of Hollywood and an acquaintance of the Reagans, attended a White House State Dinner for Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid with the Reagans. Hudson was gay but deeply closeted to the public, as his career was made on playing heartthrobs in heterosexual romance films. At the dinner, First Lady Nancy Reagan noticed that Hudson looked gaunt, and when she sent him photos from the dinner, she urged him to get a doctor to look at the red blotch on his neck. When Hudson went for a checkup on June 5, 1984, doctors identified the blotch as Kaposi's sarcoma, and Hudson tested as HIV-positive.\n\n**Koop Report**\n\nOn February 6, 1986, Reagan began his administration's first significant initiative against AIDS when he declared finding a cure for AIDS to be \"one of our highest public health priorities\" and ordered Surgeon General C Everett Koop to assemble a \"major report\" on AIDS. According to historian Jennifer Brier, administration officials including Bauer and Bennett believed that Koop, a conservative Presbyterian, would write a report that would emphasize morality and sex only within the confines of heterosexual marriage as the solution to AIDS. According to Koop, he had previously been \"cut off\" from discussions on AIDS, starting in 1981. Henry Waxman, then the chair of the United States House Energy Subcommittee on Health and an AIDS advocate, criticized the Reagan administration's requisitioning of the report, accusing them of playing a \"shell game\" with federal funding as he noted that the same day, the Reagan administration had also proposed a budget which included a $51 million cut to AIDS funding for the following fiscal year.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe scientific community's response to the report was mixed, with some criticizing it as \"confirming what the president wanted to hear.\" The Reagan administration itself was also \"lukewarm\" on the report according to medical historian Jonathan Engel, who writes that the Watkins commission \"surprised almost everybody.\"", "prompt": "Write a complete

Kinsolving\nKinsolving, despite being personally against homosexuality, continued to press Speakes on the AIDS issue over the following years On June 12, 1983, a second exchange on the topic of AIDS occurred between Kinsolving and Speakes, in which Speakes said that the President was \"briefed on the AIDS situation a number of months ago\", the first public indication that Reagan was aware of the AIDS epidemic [10] [18] As part of that same exchange, Speakes also jokingly insinuated that Kinsolving was gay himself, saying at a mention of fairy tales that \"Lester's ears perked up when you said fairy.\" [19] [20]\n\n\n1983 meetings\nOn June 21, 1983, Reagan held a meeting with the National Gay Task Force representatives Virginia Apuzzo and Jeff Levi, alongside members of his own

in their infancy, and even trials were unavailable in the United States [12] In 1985, as his disease worsened, Hudson travelled to Paris, where he sought to seek treatment from Dominique Dormant, a French Army doctor who had secretly treated him for AIDS in the fall of 1984 with HPA-23 [44] [45] After his collapse at the Ritz Hotel on July 21, 1985, Hudson was admitted to the American Hospital of Paris; Dormant, however, was working at a military hospital and was denied permission to admit Hudson, as Hudson was not a French citizen Further, Dormant was at first not even able to enter the American Hospital to see Hudson [44]\n\n\nEffects\nIt was commonly accepted now, among the people who had understood the threat for many years, that there were two clear phases to the disease in the United States: there was AIDS before Rock Hudson and AIDS after.\n\n\nReagan acknowledges AIDS\nOn September 17, 1985, less than two months after Hudson had come forward with his AIDS diagnosis, Reagan publicly acknowledged AIDS for the first time when he was asked a question about it by a reporter at a presidential press conference [54] Since the CDC first announced the emergence of AIDS in 1981, more than 5,000 people had died from the disease, [20] and thirty presidential news briefings had passed without Reagan being asked about AIDS [54]\n\n\nKoop Report\nOn February 6, 1986, Reagan began his administration's first significant initiative against AIDS when he declared finding a cure for AIDS to be \"one of our highest public health priorities\" and ordered Surgeon General C Everett Koop to assemble a \"major report\" on AIDS [59] [60] According to historian Jennifer Brier, administration officials including Bauer and Bennett believed that Koop, a conservative Presbyterian, would write a report that would emphasize morality and sex only within the confines of heterosexual marriage as the solution to AIDS [61] According to Koop, he had previously been \"cut off\" from discussions on AIDS, starting in 1981 [62] Henry Waxman, then the chair of the United States House Energy Subcommittee on Health and an AIDS advocate, criticized the Reagan administration's requisitioning of the report, accusing them of playing a \"shell game\" with federal funding as he noted that the same day, the Reagan administration had also proposed a budget which included a $51¬†million cut to AIDS funding for the following fiscal year [59]\n\n\nCommissioning and creation\nOn February 6, 1986, Reagan began his administration's first significant initiative against AIDS

36-page report was released on  October 22, 1986, and was an immediate bombshell [64] The report projected that 270,000 Americans would contract HIV/AIDS and 179,000 would die from it by 1991 At the suggestion of Fauci, the report was unsparing in its language, describing the methods of transmission of AIDS through \"semen and vaginal fluids\" during \"oral, anal and vaginal intercourse\", while also correcting common myths about AIDS, such as the ability to contract it from saliva or mosquito bites [64] [63] While Koop acknowledged that abstinence was the only way to guarantee AIDS prevention, he also suggested teaching safe sex, specifically the use of condoms, to stymie its spread [64] He also argued that since \"information and education are the only weapons against AIDS\", education about the disease needed to begin as early as possible, specifically citing third grade (8- and 9-year-olds) as the age at which he would like to begin educating students on AIDS [65] Koop also wrote that sex education needed to contain information on both heterosexual and homosexual sex Further, he advocated for confidential, optional testing to encourage those at risk to get tested, as the groups which were at the highest risk of AIDS, such as queer people and drug users, were often societally marginalized [65] This went against a popular conservative position of the time held by some conservatives in the White House including Bauer, which was to require mandatory testing for those at risk, as well as a public registrar of people with AIDS [60]\n\n\nReactions\nThe scientific community's response to the report was mixed, with some criticizing it as \"confirming what the president wanted to hear\" [62] The Reagan administration itself was also \"lukewarm\" on the report according to medical historian Jonathan Engel, who writes that the Watkins commission \"surprised almost everybody\" [62]\n\n\nSpeech at the American Foundation for AIDS Research\nIn the spring of 1987, Elizabeth Taylor, a longtime friend of Nancy Reagan, co-star and confidant of Rock Hudson, and the national chairperson of the American Foundation for AIDS Research (amFAR), invited President Reagan to speak to speak at an amFAR fundraising dinner, which would precede a massive scientific conference on AIDS [72] At the urging of Nancy, Reagan accepted the offer, and began preparing for what would be his first speech on the subject of AIDS [d] [73] [74] Landon Parvin, an outside consultant and Nancy's favorite among Reagan's speechwriters, was brought in to write the speech, as the Reagans were aware that the audience would likely be hostile [72] [73]\n\n\nPresident's Commission on the HIV Epidemic\nOn June 24, 1987, Reagan issued Executive Order 12601, creating the Presidential Commission on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Epidemic to investigate HIV/AIDS [79] Quickly, the Reagan administration was inundated with suggestions for committee members from across the political spectrum [80] Senator Strom Thurmond proposed Paul Cameron, a psychologist from Nebraska who wanted to institute a \"rolling quarantine\" of homosexuals, and Gary Bauer suggested William F Buckley, a right-wing publicist who proposed to permanently tattoo all people who tested positive for AIDS, on the arm if they were drug users and on the buttocks if they were gay [80] Other nominees included Stephen Herbits, [e] Eunice Kennedy Shriver, Barbara Jordan, and Bob Bauman [f] [12] [80]\n\n\nCreation of the commission and membership\nOn June 24, 1987, Reagan issued Executive Order 12601,

Presidential Commission on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Epidemic) was released on June 27, 1988 The report was unflinching in its assessment of the Reagan administration's response to that point, describing a \"lack of leadership\" as one of the biggest obstacles to progress against AIDS [84] [85] The Watkins Commission report also made a number of policy suggestions, many of which overlapped with the suggestions in the Koop Report In total, the 203-page report makes 579 specific recommendations for fighting AIDS, [85] including:\n\n\nReactions\nThe scientific community's response to the report was mixed, with some criticizing it as \"confirming what the president wanted to hear\" [62] The Reagan administration itself was also \"lukewarm\" on the report according to medical historian Jonathan Engel, who writes that the Watkins commission \"surprised almost everybody\" [62]\n\n\nReagan's personal views\nReagan was a devout Christian, and personally held the belief that homosexuality was a sin In early 1987, Reagan had a discussion on the AIDS epidemic with his biographer, Edmund Morris, in which Reagan commented, \"maybe the Lord brought down this plague\" because \"illicit sex is against the Ten Commandments\" [91] Journalist Lou Cannon argued Reagan did not bear hostile feelings to gay persons but did consider being gay \"a sad thing\" [92] Biographer H W Brands concluded that Reagan was personally \"more tolerant\" of gay people \"than many in his generation\", citing his opposition of the California Briggs Initiative, but nevertheless \"catered, if not pandered\" to the homophobic elements of the American Republican Party of which he was a member [93] According to John Hutton, one of Reagan's personal physicians, when private citizens would ask Reagan what should be done about AIDS, he would often respond that \"money might not be the answer\" and that \"perhaps people are supposed to modify their behaviors\" [53]\n\n\nAdvocacy by Nancy and Ron Reagan\nReagan's wife, Nancy, and his son, Ron, were both privately sympathetic to LGBT movements, and attempted at various points to lobby Reagan to do more about the AIDS crisis [40] Nancy had long had many gay men in her circle of friends, and Ron knew people who were suffering from AIDS from his time ballet dancing in New York City's Joffrey Ballet [12] In 1987, Ron's disagreements with his father's policies began to cross from private into the public sphere In July 1987, Ron starred in a television commercial criticizing his father's administration for its inaction on the AIDS pandemic In the commercial, Ron urged the audience: \"The U.S government isn't moving fast enough to stop the spread of AIDS Write to your congressman,\" before adding with a smile, \"or someone higher up.\" [98] He also appeared in a 30-minute public service announcement on AIDS, which was shown on PBS, in which he taught the audience how to use a condom and spermicide and encourages viewers to use them [98] These public disagreements frustrated the elder Reagan, who wrote in his diary on July 18, 1987, that he disagreed with his son's stances, complaining that \" [Ron] can be stubborn on a couple of issues & won't listen to anyone's argument.\" [98]\n\n\nMeeting with Elizabeth Glaser\nIn June 1988, a friend of the Reagans put them in contact with AIDS advocate Elizabeth Glaser Glaser had unknowingly contracted HIV through a blood transfusion when she was giving birth to her first child in 1981 and had inadvertently given it to both of her children, Ariel, born in 1981, and Jake, born in 1984 [99] Although a few treatments, such as AZT, were available for AIDS treatment by that point, none of them were approved for use in children Glaser believed that as a white heterosexual woman and a mother of two AIDS-stricken children, she may be able to change the Reagans' views on AIDS more effectively than LGBT activists, and so she reached out to a mutual friend who put her in contact with the Reagans [99]\n\n\nPost-presidency\nReagan's second term as president ended on January 20, 1989, when his Vice President George H.W Bush was sworn in as his successor In 1989, the Reagans called Elizabeth Glaser to give their condolences after Glaser's daughter, Ariel, passed away from AIDS complications [103] In 1990, Reagan appeared in an AIDS PSA with Glaser in which he offered what was described by Karen Tumulty as tacit regret for his administration's handling of the AIDS crisis, as he says in the PSA: \"I'm not asking you to send money I'm asking you for something more important: your understanding Maybe it's time we all learned something new.\" [103] Reagan also headlined a fundraiser in 1990 for Glaser's organization, the Pediatric AIDS Foundation At the fundraiser, Reagan was asked by a reporter if he wished his administration had done more about AIDS, to which he responded, \"We did all that we could at the time.\" [104]\n\n\nTimeline\nThrough the lack of both policy and financial support, the United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) was severely handicapped during the early years of the AIDS epidemic Senior staff of the Reagan Administration did not understand the essential role of Government in disease prevention Although CDC clearly documented the dangers of HIV and AIDS early in the epidemic, refusal by the White House to deliver prevention programs then certainly allowed HIV to become more widely seeded.\n\n\nLegacy\nThrough the lack of both policy and financial support, the United States Centers for Disease

the AIDS crisis \"raised the stakes\" for LGBT people to secure rights and access to healthcare [124] The crisis also forged new solidarity between men who have sex with men and women who have sex with women, as the experience in organizing queer women had gained in fighting for reproductive rights were crucial in facilitating AIDS advocacy groups for queer men [124]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nOn April 21, 1985, playwright Larry Kramer debuted his autobiographical play The Normal Heart, a major subject of which is the lack of attention given to AIDS by the American public and the Reagan administration [106] The play was adapted into a 2014 film of the same name starring Mark Ruffalo [106] [108] Randy Shilts's book And the Band Played On was also adapted into a 1994 HBO television film of the same name, starring Matthew Modine as Don Francis The television series Pose, which debuted in 2018, is set in part during the Reagan years, and deals with the AIDS crisis in New York City's ball culture of the 1980s and 1990s The show's characters are critical of Reagan and his response to AIDS; in the first season episode \"The Fever\", the character Prayerful \"Pray\" Tell, a gay man, says of Reagan and the AIDS crisis: \"I know that Ronald Reagan will not say the word AIDS Health insurance will not cover any treatment The world wants us dead.\" [131] [132]\n\n\nSee

American who was born in North Carolina [14] Owens is also of Caribbean American heritage through her grandmother, who is originally from Saint Thomas, U.S Virgin Islands [15]\n\n\nEarly career\nIn 2015, Owens was CEO of Degree180, a marketing agency that offered consultation, production, and planning services that included a blog on a variety of topics [14] [3] written by Owens and other commentators [23] In a 2015 column that Owens wrote for the site, she criticized conservative Republicans, writing about the \"bat-shit-crazy antics of the Republican Tea Party\"; she also added that \"The good news is, they will eventually die off (peacefully in their sleep, we hope), and then we can get right on with the OBVIOUS social change that needs to happen, IMMEDIATELY.\" [14] [24] [25] [26] In 2016, the blog featured an article mocking Donald Trump's penis size [3] [27] [28]\n\n\nDegree180 and anti-conservative blog\nIn 2015, Owens was CEO of Degree180, a marketing agency that

in their sleep, we hope), and then we can get right on with the OBVIOUS social change that needs to happen, IMMEDIATELY.\" [14] [24] [25] [26] In 2016, the blog featured an article mocking Donald Trump's penis size [3] [27] [28]\n\n\nPrivacy violation, Gamergate, and political transformation\nOwens launched SocialAutopsy.com in 2016, a website she said would expose bullies on the Internet by tracking their digital footprint [14] [24] [16] The site would have solicited users to take screenshots of offensive posts and send them to the website, where they would be categorized by the user's name [16] She used crowdfunding on Kickstarter for the website The proposal was immediately controversial, drawing criticism that Owens was de-anonymizing (doxing) Internet users and violating their privacy [14] [29] According to The Daily Dot, \"People from all sides of the anti-harassment debate were quick to criticize the database, calling it a public shaming list that would encourage doxing and retaliatory harassment.\" [30] Both conservatives and progressives condemned the website [14]\n\n\nConservative activism\nDefunct\n\n\nBLEXIT Foundation\n\"Blexit\", a term originally coined by Me'Lea Connelly, is a portmanteau of \"black\" and \"exit\" that mimics Brexit, the word used to describe the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union The original Blexit movement was started in 2016 by Connelly with the goal of achieving black economic independence by encouraging black Americans to leave the traditional financial systems that have historically disadvantaged the black community [49] [50] [51]\n\n\nProduct promotion\nIn July 2021, Owens announced the launch of a device named the Freedom Phone, which sold for $500, was marketed toward Trump supporters and which she claimed was \"not controlled by Apple or Google\" [59] The device's launch was criticized by tech publications for a lack of transparency about the device, as well as security concerns [60] [61] [62] [63] The device was later revealed to be a white-label version of the Umidigi A9 Pro, a Chinese smartphone available for $120, [59] and its \"uncensorable\" PatriApp store is a rebranded version of Aurora Store, an open-source frontend for the Google Play Store [63]\n\n\nPolitical views\nOwens said she had no interest in politics whatsoever before 2015, but previously identified as liberal [67] [68] In October 2018, she said that she had never voted and had only recently become a registered Republican [68] In January 2019, Owens stated: \"The left hates America, and Trump loves it.\" [69] She added that the left is \"destroying everything through this cultural Marxist ideology.\" [69]\n\n\nAnti-black racism and Black Lives Matter\nOwens is known for her criticism of the Black Lives Matter movement, [5] [75] [76] [77] and has described Black Lives Matter protesters as \"a bunch of whiny toddlers, pretending to be oppressed for attention\" [78] Owens has argued that African Americans have a victim mentality, often referring to the Democratic Party as a \"plantation\", [75] [70] stating in 2020: \"Black lives only matter to white liberals every four years‚Äîahead of an election.\" [79] She has also argued that the American Left likes \"black people to be government-dependent\", [80] and that black people have been brainwashed to vote for Democrats [4] Furthermore, Owens has argued that police brutality in the United States and instances of police killing black people are not sourced in racism, but typically occur when the officer feels his life is under threat, [75] [78] adding a police officer is eighteen-and-a-half times more likely to die at the hands of a black person than vice versa [24] [70] [69] She has also characterized abortion as a tool for the extermination of black babies [14]\n\n\nWomen's rights\nOwens is critical of feminism [95] and embraces the \"trad wife\" phenomenon of traditional gender roles [96] She has described the #MeToo movement, an international movement against sexual harassment and assault, as \"stupid\" [2] [97] Owens wrote that the movement was premised on the idea that \"women are stupid, weak & inconsequential\" [2] [97] She opposes abortion, [74] which she has called a tool for the \"extermination of black babies\" [14]\n\n\nLGBT rights\n\nOn July 28, 2017, Owens stated she was in favor of banning transgender individuals who are undergoing sex reassignment surgery from serving in the United States military but said that she did not oppose fully transitioned transgender individuals serving in the U.S military [100] In her biography, Blackout: How Black America Can Make Its Second Escape from the Democrat Plantation, in the chapter \"On Overcivilization - The Trend Towards Overcivilization\", she talks about her view between civilization, in which she described as when basic rights and liberties have been ensured for all, and \"overcivilization\" in the following quote: \n\nDonald Trump\nAlthough in 2015 Owens posted anti-Trump and anti-conservative articles on her Degree180 blog, [3] [27] in 2017 she began describing herself as a conservative Donald Trump supporter [14] [111] [112] Owens has since characterized Trump as the \"savior\" of Western civilization [5] She has argued that Trump has neither engaged in rhetoric that is harmful to African Americans, nor proposed policies that would harm African Americans [24] [70]\n\n\nImmigration\nOwens is a proponent of the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border wall, [116] [117] and believes undocumented immigrants to the United States should be immediately deported [14] In 2018, Owens warned that \"Europe will fall and become a Muslim-majority continent by 2050 There has never been a Muslim-majority country where sharia law was not implemented.\" She suggested that the United States would then be \"forced to save\" the British [118] [119]\n\n\nScience\nOwens has stated that she does not believe in science which she described as a pagan faith She stated, \"I'm not a flat-earther I'm not a round-earther.' Actually, what I am is, I am somebody who has left the cult of science I have left the megachurch of science because what I have now realized is that science‚Äîwhat it is actually, if you think about it‚Äîis a pagan faith.\" [120]\n\n\nClimate change\nIn July 2018, Owens claimed that global warming is not real, calling it a lie used to \"extract dollars from Americans\" [121] [122] [123] In 2021, she promoted paid ads on Facebook, calling the U.S government \"modern doomsayers\" who have been wrongly predicting climate crises for decades [124] [125]\n\n\nWelfare\nOwens has expressed a critical stance on welfare programs, arguing that they can create dependency and discourage self-reliance among recipients She believes that welfare reform is necessary to promote individual responsibility and empower individuals to break free from government assistance Owens has said that welfare is a Democratic Party tool to keep black Americans dependent upon the government [74]\n\n\nAdolf Hitler and Nazi Germany\nAt the launch of Turning Point's British offshoot Turning Point UK in December 2018, Owens made comments about Adolf Hitler [126] She was responding to an audience member who asked for a \"long-term prognosis\" about the terms \"globalism\" and \"nationalism\" Owens said: [126] [127]\n\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic and vaccination\nIn April 2020, Owens said that COVID-19 deaths were overcounted; health experts said that it was more likely that COVID-19 deaths were undercounted [136] Regarding a COVID-19 vaccine, she said in June 2020 that \"under no circumstances will I be getting any #coronavirus vaccine that becomes available Ever No matter what.\" [137] She also referred to Bill Gates as a \"vaccine-criminal\", and said that he and the World Health Organization (WHO) used \"African & Indian tribal children to experiment w/ non-FDA approved drug vaccines.\" [138] [139] On August 8, 2021, Owens said in a Facebook post: \"I still have not received the COVID-19 vaccine and have not demanded that any of my employees get it either I am proud that I committed myself to standing firm against the bribery, media propaganda, coercion, celebrity-peer pressure campaign, plus censorship.. It is isn't easy to swim against such a polluted current but here I am I trust my gut much more than trust Dr Fauci.\" [140] Also in August, Owens claimed that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) proposed \"putting high risk people into camps to 'shield' low risk people from them\" [141]\n\n\nRussia and Ukraine\nIn 2022, after Russia's full invasion of Ukraine, Owens promoted a quote by Russian President Vladimir Putin [159] which included the false assertion that the USSR created the modern country of Ukraine [160] Her views have received support and amplification from the Embassy of Russia, Washington, D.C., particularly following her tweet stating \"Russian lives matter\" [161] [162] In March 2022, Owens faced criticism from historian Anne Applebaum for claiming that Ukraine \"wasn't a thing until 1989\" and dismissing the notion of a Russian-led genocide in the country, prompting Applebaum to label Owens as ignorant of history [163]\n\n\nJews and Judaism\nFollowing her departure from the Daily Wire after she was accused of antisemitism, Owens downplayed the prevalence of antisemitism, stating that \"people who are now screaming 'antisemitism is everywhere!' are actually just racial supremacists.\" [167] According to Media Matters, Owens criticized Jordan Peterson for calling far-right commentator Nick Fuentes a \"psychopathic rat\" after Fuentes tweeted that Jews control the Biden administration Owens suggested that Fuentes could be correct based on the number of Jewish officials appointed to the Biden Administration, saying that \"it seems a weird tweet for  [Peterson] to be so disturbed about.\" Owens further referred to Fuentes as having \"a very long background of focusing his attention on Israel and Zionism, and that's what he is reacting to.\" [168] Fuentes had previously praised Owens, saying she was waging \"a full-fledged war against the Jews.\" [169] Owens falsely claimed in an interview with Tristan Tate, brother of Andrew Tate, that Joseph Stalin was Jewish, and that Sigmund Freud and Stalinists were part of a Jewish cabal Owens claimed that Freud studied Kabbalah and promoted pedophilia through psychoanalysis [170]\n\n\nIsrael and Palestine\nOwens is a critic of Israel and increasingly stridently expressed her negative views of the country during the 2023 Israel‚ÄìHamas war [179] In October 2023, she criticized an Israeli strike on a church in Gaza, in which Christians were killed,  tweeting \"I have been disgusted by the propagandists pretending a Christian church was not bombed Christians were killed No Christian should stay silent\", and later \"If you think it's antisemitism to notice that innocent Christians were killed in an IDF bombing, then you need to log off.\" [180] Clarifying her views in early November, Owens tweeted \"No government anywhere has a right to commit a genocide, ever.\" [181] [180] [179]\n\n\nLegal issues\nDuring an Instagram livestream on June 22, 2021, Owens accused former Republican congressional candidate Kimberly Klacik of money laundering, tax fraud, illegal drug use, and misusing campaign funds Owens also said that Klacik is a \"madame\" who recruits strippers for a strip club owned by her husband [184] [185] [186] [187] Owens said she found out about this after talking with a woman who claimed to have worked as a stripper at Klacik's strip club [188]\n\n\nKimberly Klacik lawsuit\nDuring an Instagram livestream on June 22, 2021, Owens accused former Republican congressional candidate Kimberly Klacik of money laundering, tax fraud, illegal drug use, and misusing campaign funds Owens also said that Klacik is a \"madame\" who recruits strippers for a strip club owned by her husband [184] [185] [186] [187] Owens said she found out about this after talking with a woman who claimed to have worked as a stripper at Klacik's strip club [188]\n\n\nOther\nIn October 2020, Owens sued Lead Stories and USA Today after they fact-checked Facebook posts she had made downplaying the COVID-19 pandemic, alleging their articles had led to her being unable to obtain advertising revenue from her Facebook page and the termination of a deal with Facebook to advertise her book Blackout [190] [191] Owens created a website to solicit donations for the lawsuit [192] The lawsuit was dismissed in July 2021, with the judge ruling that her posts contained COVID-19 misinformation [190] The lawsuit's dismissal was upheld in February 2022 [191]\n\n\nControversies\nIn August 2018, Owens had a dispute with Sam Lucas, cousin of Mollie Tibbetts, who had been murdered by Cristhian Bahena Rivera, a 24-year-old Mexican undocumented immigrant [194] Tibbetts's cousin said that Owens had exploited Tibbetts's death for \"political propaganda\" [195]

American Left likes \"black people to be government-dependent\", [80] and that black people have been brainwashed to vote for Democrats [4] Furthermore, Owens has argued that police brutality in the United States and instances of police killing black people are not sourced in racism, but typically occur when the officer feels his life is under threat, [75] [78] adding a police officer is

African Americans [24] [70]\n\n\nImmigration\nOwens is a proponent of the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border wall, [116] [117] and believes undocumented immigrants to the United States should be immediately deported [14] In 2018, Owens warned that \"Europe will fall and become a Muslim-majority continent by 2050 There has never been a Muslim-majority country where sharia law was not

Prevention (CDC) proposed \"putting high risk people into camps to 'shield' low risk people from them\" [141]\n\n\nRussia and Ukraine\nIn 2022, after Russia's full invasion of Ukraine, Owens promoted a quote by Russian President Vladimir Putin [159] which included the false assertion that the USSR created the modern country of Ukraine [160] Her views have received support and amplification from the Embassy of Russia, Washington, D.C., particularly following her tweet stating \"Russian lives matter\" [161] [162] In March 2022, Owens faced criticism from historian Anne Applebaum for claiming that Ukraine \"wasn't a thing until 1989\" and dismissing the notion of a Russian-led genocide in the country, prompting Applebaum to label Owens as ignorant of history [163]\n\n\nJews and Judaism\nFollowing her departure from the Daily Wire after she was accused of antisemitism, Owens downplayed the prevalence of antisemitism, stating that \"people who are now screaming 'antisemitism is everywhere!' are actually just racial supremacists.\" [167] According to Media Matters, Owens criticized Jordan Peterson for calling far-right commentator Nick Fuentes a \"psychopathic rat\" after Fuentes tweeted that Jews control the Biden administration Owens suggested that Fuentes could be correct based on the number of Jewish officials appointed to the Biden Administration, saying that \"it seems a weird tweet for  [Peterson] to be so disturbed about.\" Owens further referred to Fuentes as having \"a very long background of focusing his attention on Israel and Zionism, and that's what he is reacting to.\" [168] Fuentes had previously praised Owens, saying she was waging \"a full-fledged war against the Jews.\" [169] Owens falsely claimed in an interview with Tristan Tate, brother of Andrew Tate, that Joseph Stalin was Jewish, and that Sigmund Freud and Stalinists were part of a Jewish cabal Owens claimed that Freud studied Kabbalah and promoted pedophilia through psychoanalysis [170]\n\n\nIsrael and Palestine\nOwens is a critic of Israel and increasingly stridently expressed her negative views of the country during the 2023 Israel‚ÄìHamas war [179] In October 2023, she criticized an Israeli strike on a church in Gaza, in which Christians were killed,  tweeting \"I have been disgusted by the propagandists pretending a Christian church was not bombed Christians were killed No Christian should stay silent\", and later \"If you think it's antisemitism to notice that innocent Christians were killed in an IDF bombing, then you need to log off.\" [180] Clarifying her views in early November, Owens tweeted \"No government anywhere has a right to commit a genocide, ever.\" [181] [180] [179]\n\n\nLegal issues\nDuring an Instagram livestream on June 22, 2021, Owens

{"title": "Malta", "content": "\nName\nThe English name Malta derives from Italian and Maltese Malta, from medieval Arabic MƒÅli·π≠ƒÅ (ŸÖŸéÿßŸÑŸêÿ∑Ÿéÿß), from classical Latin Melita, [41] from latinised or Doric forms [42] of the ancient Greek Mel√≠tƒì (ŒúŒµŒªŒØœÑŒ∑) of uncertain origin The name Mel√≠tƒì‚Äîshared by the Croatian island Mljet in antiquity‚Äîliterally means \"place of honey\" or \"sweetness\", derived from the combining form of m√©li (ŒºŒ≠ŒªŒπ, \"honey\" or any similarly sweet thing) [43] and the suffix -ƒì (-Œ∑) The ancient Greeks may have given the island this name after Malta's endemic subspecies of bees [44] Alternatively, other scholars argue for derivation of the Greek name from an original Phoenician or Punic Maleth (ê§åê§ãê§à, ml·π≠), meaning \"haven\" [45] or \"port\" [46] in reference to the Grand Harbour and its primary settlement at Cospicua following the sea level rise that separated the Maltese islands and flooded its original coastal settlements in the 10th century¬†BC [47] The name was then applied to all of Malta by the Greeks and to its ancient capital at Mdina by the Romans [47]\n\n\nHistory\nMalta has been inhabited from circa 5900 BC, [51] since the arrival of settlers originating from European Neolithic agriculturalists [52] Pottery found by archaeologists at the Skorba Temples resembles that found in Italy, and suggests that the Maltese islands were first settled in 5200 BC by Stone Age hunters or farmers who had arrived from Sicily, possibly the Sicani The extinction of the dwarf hippos, giant swans and dwarf elephants has been linked to the earliest arrival of humans on Malta [53] Prehistoric farming settlements dating to the Early Neolithic include Gƒßar Dalam [54] The population on Malta grew cereals, raised livestock and, in common with other ancient Mediterranean cultures, worshipped a fertility figure [55]\n\n\nPrehistory\nMalta has been inhabited from circa 5900 BC, [51] since the arrival of settlers

Mediterranean cultures, worshipped a fertility figure [55]\n\n\nPhoenicians, Carthaginians and Romans\nPhoenician traders [64] colonised the islands under the name Ann (ê§Äê§çê§ç‚Äé,  æNN) [65] [66] [47] sometime after 1000 BC [15] as a stop on their trade routes from the eastern Mediterranean to Cornwall [67] Their seat of government was apparently at Mdina, which shared the island's name; [65] [66] the primary port was at Cospicua on the Grand Harbour, which they called Maleth [47] After the fall of Phoenicia in 332 BC, the area came under the control of Carthage [15] [68] During this time, the people on Malta mainly cultivated olives and carob and produced textiles [68]\n\n\nArab period and the Middle Ages\nMalta became involved in the Arab‚ÄìByzantine wars, and the conquest of Malta is closely linked with that of Sicily that began in 827 after Admiral Euphemius' betrayal of his fellow Byzantines, requesting that the Aghlabids invade the island [78] The Muslim chronicler and geographer al-Himyari recounts that in 870, following a violent struggle against the defending Byzantines, the Arab invaders, first led by Halaf al-Hadim, and later by Sawada ibn Muhammad, [79] pillaged the island, destroying the most important buildings, and leaving it practically uninhabited until it was recolonised by the Arabs from Sicily in 1048‚Äì1049 [79] It is uncertain whether this new settlement resulted from demographic expansion in Sicily, a higher standard of living in Sicily (in which case the recolonisation may have taken place a few decades earlier), or a civil war which broke out among the Arab rulers of Sicily in 1038 [80] The Arab Agricultural Revolution introduced new irrigation, cotton, and some fruits The Siculo-Arabic language was adopted on the island from Sicily; it would eventually evolve into the Maltese language [81]\n\n\nNorman conquest\nThe Normans attacked Malta in 1091, as part of their conquest of Sicily [82] The Norman leader, Roger I of Sicily, was welcomed by Christian captives [44] The notion that Count Roger I reportedly tore off a portion of his checkered red-and-white banner and presented it to the Maltese in gratitude for having fought on his behalf, forming the basis of the modern flag of Malta, is founded in myth [44] [83]\n\n\nCrown of Aragon, the Knights of Malta and Portuguese Rule\nMalta was ruled by the House of Barcelona, the ruling dynasty of the Crown of Aragon, from 1282 to 1409, [90] with the Aragonese aiding the Maltese insurgents in the Sicilian Vespers in the naval battle in Grand Harbour in 1283 [91]\n\n\nFrench period and British conquest\nThe Knights' reign ended when Napoleon captured Malta on his way to Egypt during the French Revolutionary Wars in 1798 During 12‚Äì18 June 1798, Napoleon resided at the Palazzo Parisio in Valletta [108] [109] [110] He reformed national administration with the creation of a Government Commission, twelve municipalities, a public finance administration, the abolition of all feudal rights and privileges, the abolition of slavery and the granting of freedom to all Turkish and Jewish slaves [111] [112] On the judicial level, a family code was framed and twelve judges were nominated Public education was organised along principles laid down by Bonaparte himself, providing for primary and secondary education [112] [113] He then sailed for Egypt, leaving a substantial garrison in Malta [114]\n\n\nBritish Empire and the Second World War\nIn 1814, as part of the Treaty of Paris, [112] [117] Malta officially became a part of the British Empire and was used as a shipping way-station and fleet headquarters After the Suez Canal opened in 1869, Malta's position halfway between the Strait of Gibraltar and Egypt proved to be its main asset, and it was considered an important stop on the way to India, a central trade route for the British.\n\n\nIndependence and Republic\nMalta achieved its independence as the State of Malta on 21 September 1964 (Independence Day) Under its 1964 constitution, Malta initially retained Queen Elizabeth II as Queen of Malta and thus head of state, with a governor-general exercising executive authority on her behalf In 1971, the Malta Labour Party led by Dom Mintoff won the general elections, resulting in Malta declaring itself a republic on 13 December 1974 (Republic Day) within the Commonwealth A defence agreement was signed soon after independence, and after being re-negotiated in 1972, expired on 31 March 1979 (Freedom Day) [127] Upon its expiry, the British base closed and lands formerly controlled by the British were given to the Maltese government [128]\n\n\nPolitics\nMalta is a republic [34] whose parliamentary system and public administration are closely modelled on the Westminster system.\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nMalta has had a system of local government since 1993, [136] based on the European Charter of Local Self-Government The country is divided into six regions (one of them being Gozo), with each region having its own Regional Council, serving as the intermediate level between local government and national government [137] The regions are divided into local councils, of which there are currently 68 (54 in Malta and 14 in Gozo) The six districts (five on Malta and the sixth being Gozo) serve primarily statistical purposes [138]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe objectives of the Armed Forces of Malta (AFM) are to maintain a military organisation with the primary aim of defending the islands' integrity according to the defence roles as set by the government in an efficient and cost-effective manner This is achieved by emphasising the maintenance of Malta's territorial waters and airspace integrity [139]\n\n\nHuman rights\nMalta is regarded as one of the most LGBT-supportive countries in the world, [144] [145] and was the first nation in the European Union to prohibit conversion therapy [146] Malta also constitutionally bans discrimination based on disability [147]\nMaltese legislation recognises both civil and canonical (ecclesiastical) marriages Annulments by the ecclesiastical and civil courts are unrelated and are not necessarily mutually endorsed Malta voted in favour of divorce legislation in a referendum held on 28 May 2011 [148]\n\n\nGeography\nMalta is an archipelago in the central Mediterranean (in its eastern basin), some 80¬†km (50¬†mi) from southern Italy across the Malta Channel Only the three largest islands‚ÄîMalta (Maltese: Malta), Gozo (Gƒßawdex), and Comino (Kemmuna)‚Äîare inhabited The islands of the archipelago lie on the Malta plateau, a shallow shelf formed from the high points of a land bridge between Sicily and North Africa that became isolated as sea levels rose after the last ice age [152] The archipelago is located on the African tectonic plate [153] [154] Malta was considered an island of North Africa for centuries [155] The seabed surrounding Malta's islands retains traces of ancient geomarine features, suggesting potential archaeological discoveries that could shed light on the region's prehistoric environment  [156]\n\n\nClimate\nMalta has a Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Csa), [35] [158] with mild winters and hot summers, hotter in the inland areas Rain occurs mainly in autumn and winter, with summer being generally dry.\n\n\nUrbanisation\nAccording to Eurostat, Malta is composed of two larger urban zones nominally referred to as \"Valletta\" (the main island of Malta) and \"Gozo\" The main urban area covers the entire main island, with a population of around 400,000 [169] [170] The core of the urban area, the greater city of Valletta, has a population of 205,768 [171] According to the data from 2020 by Eurostat, the Functional Urban Area and metropolitan region covered the whole island and has a population of 480,134 [172] [173] According to the United Nations, about 95 percent of the area of Malta is urban and the number grows every year [20] According to ESPON and EU Commission studies, \"the whole territory of Malta constitutes a single urban region\" [21]\n\n\nFlora\nThe Maltese islands are home to a wide diversity of indigenous, sub-endemic and endemic plants [178] They feature many traits typical of a Mediterranean climate, such as drought resistance The most common indigenous trees on the islands are olive (Olea europaea), carob (Ceratonia siliqua), fig (Ficus carica), holm oak (Quericus ilex) and Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis), while the most common non-native trees are eucalyptus, acacia and opuntia Endemic plants include the national flower widnet il-baƒßar (Cheirolophus crassifolius), sempreviva ta' Malta (Helichrysum panormitanum subsp melitense), ≈ºigland t' Gƒßawdex (Hyoseris frutescens) and ƒ°i≈ºi ta' Malta (Matthiola incana subsp melitensis) while sub-endemics include kromb il-baƒßar (Jacobaea maritima subsp sicula) and xkattapietra (Micromeria microphylla) [179] The biodiversity of Malta is severely endangered by habitat loss, invasive species and human intervention [180]\n\n\nEconomy\nMalta is classified as an advanced economy according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) [181] Malta's major resources are limestone, a favourable geographic location and a productive labour force Malta produces only about 20 percent of its food needs, has limited fresh water supplies because of the drought in the summer, and has no domestic energy sources, aside from the potential for solar energy from its plentiful sunlight The economy is dependent on foreign trade (serving as a freight trans-shipment point), manufacturing (especially electronics and textiles), and tourism [182] Film production has contributed to the Maltese economy [183]\n\n\nBanking and finance\nThe two largest commercial banks are Bank of Valletta and HSBC Bank Malta Digital banks such as Revolut have also increased in popularity [194] The Central Bank of Malta (Bank ƒäentrali ta' Malta) has two key areas of responsibility: the formulation and implementation of monetary policy and the promotion of a sound and efficient financial system The Maltese government entered ERM II on 4 May 2005, and adopted the euro as the country's currency on 1 January 2008 [195]\n\n\nCurrency\nMaltese euro coins feature the Maltese cross on ‚Ç¨2 and ‚Ç¨1 coins, the coat of arms of Malta on the ‚Ç¨0.50, ‚Ç¨0.20 and ‚Ç¨0.10 coins, and the Mnajdra Temples on the ‚Ç¨0.05, ‚Ç¨0.02 and ‚Ç¨0.01 coins [196]\n\n\nTourism\nMalta is a popular tourist destination, with 1.6¬†million tourists per year, [197] three times more tourists visit than there are residents Tourism infrastructure has increased dramatically over the years and a number of hotels are present on the island, although overdevelopment and the destruction of traditional housing is of growing concern In 2019, Malta had a record year in tourism, recording over 2.1 million tourists in one single year [198]\n\n\nScience and technology\nMalta signed a co-operation agreement with the European Space Agency (ESA) for more-intensive co-operation in ESA projects [202]\nThe Malta Council for Science and Technology (MCST) is the civil body responsible for the development of science and technology on an educational and social level Most science students in Malta graduate from the University of Malta and are represented by S-Cubed (Science Student's Society), UESA (University Engineering Students Association) and ICTSA (University of Malta ICT Students' Association) [203] [204] Malta was ranked 29th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024 [205]\n\n\nDemographics\nAs of the 2021 census, Maltese-born natives make up the majority of the island with 386,280 people out of a total population of 519,562 [206] However, there are minorities, the largest of which by birthplace were: 15,082 from the United Kingdom, Italy (13,361), India (7,946), Philippines (7,784) and Serbia (5,935) Among racial origins for the non-Maltese, 58.1% of all identified as Caucasian, 22.2% Asian, 6.3% Arab, 6.0% African, 4.5% Hispanic or Latino and 2.9% more than one race [207]\n\n\nLanguages\nThe Maltese language (Maltese: Malti) is one of the two constitutional languages of Malta and is considered the national language The second official language is English and hence laws are enacted both in Maltese and English However, article 74 of the Constitution states that \"if there is any conflict between the Maltese and the English texts of any law, the Maltese text shall prevail.\" [34]\n\n\nReligion\nReligion in Malta (2021 census) [218] [6] [219]\n\n\nMigration\nHistorically a land of emigration, since the early 21st century Malta has seen a significant increase in net migration; the foreign-born population has grown nearly eightfold between 2005 and 2020 Most of the foreign community in Malta consists of active or retired British nationals and their dependents, centred on Sliema and surrounding suburbs Other smaller foreign groups include Italians, Libyans, and Serbians, many of whom have assimilated into the Maltese nation over the decades [235]\n\n\nEducation\nPrimary schooling has been compulsory since 1946; secondary education up to the age of sixteen was made compulsory in 1971 The state and the Church provide education free of charge, both running a number of schools in Malta and Gozo As of 2006 [update], state schools are organised into networks known as Colleges and incorporate kindergarten schools, primary and secondary schools A number of private schools are run in Malta St Catherine's High School, Pembroke offers an International Foundation Course for students wishing to learn English before entering mainstream education As of 2008 [update], there are two international schools, Verdala International School and QSI Malta The state pays a portion of the teachers' salary in Church schools [247]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nOwing to the British colonial rule, traffic in Malta drives on the left Car ownership in Malta is exceedingly high, considering the very small size of the islands; it is the fourth-highest in the European Union There were 182,254 registered cars in 1990, giving an automobile density of 577/km2 (1,494/sq¬†mi) [252] Malta has 2,254 kilometres (1,401 miles) of road, 1,972¬†km (1,225¬†mi) (87.5 per cent) of which are paved (as of December 2003) [253]\n\n\nTransport\nOwing to the British colonial rule, traffic in Malta drives on the left Car ownership in Malta is exceedingly high, considering the very small size of the islands; it is the

1,972¬†km (1,225¬†mi) (87.5 per cent) of which are paved (as of December 2003) [253]\n\n\nCommunications\nThe mobile penetration rate in Malta exceeded 100% by the end of 2009 [263] Malta uses the GSM900, UMTS(3G) and LTE(4G) mobile phone systems, which are compatible with the rest of the European countries, Australia and New Zealand [citation needed]\n\n\nHealthcare\nMalta has a long history of providing publicly funded health care The first hospital recorded in the country was already functioning by 1372 [265]\nToday, Malta has both a public healthcare system, where healthcare is free at the point of delivery, and a private healthcare system [266] [267] Malta has a strong general practitioner-delivered primary care base and the public hospitals provide secondary and tertiary care The Maltese Ministry of Health advises foreign residents to take out private medical insurance [268]\n\n\nCulture\nThe culture of Malta reflects the various cultures, that have come into contact with the Maltese Islands throughout the centuries [269]\n\n\nMusic\nWhile Maltese music today is largely Western, traditional Maltese music includes what is known as gƒßana This consists of background folk guitar music, while a few people, generally men, take it in turns to argue a point in a sing-song voice Music plays an important part in Maltese culture as each locality parades its own band club, on various occasions these being multiple per locality, and function to establish the thematic musical background to the various village feasts The Malta Philharmonic Orchestra is recognized as Malta's foremost musical institution and is notable for being called to participate in important state events.\n\n\nLiterature\nDocumented Maltese literature is over 200 years old However, a recently unearthed love ballad testifies to literary activity in the local tongue from the Medieval period Malta followed a Romantic literary tradition, culminating in the works of Dun Karm Psaila, Malta's national poet Subsequent writers like Ruzar Briffa and Karmenu Vassallo tried to estrange themselves from the rigidity of formal themes and versification [270]\n\n\nArchitecture\nMaltese architecture has been influenced by many different Mediterranean cultures and British architecture over its history [272] The first settlers on the island constructed ƒ†gantija, one of the oldest manmade freestanding structures in the world The Neolithic temple builders (3800‚Äì2500 BC) endowed the numerous temples of Malta and Gozo with intricate bas-relief designs.\n\n\nArt\nTowards the end of the 15th century, Maltese artists, like their counterparts in Sicily, came under the influence of the School of Antonello da Messina, which introduced Renaissance ideals and concepts to the decorative arts in Malta [274]\n\n\nCuisine\nMaltese cuisine shows strong Sicilian and Italian influences as well as influences of English, Spanish, Maghrebin and Proven√ßal cuisines A number of regional variations can be noted as well as seasonal variations associated with the seasonal availability of produce and Christian feasts (such as Lent, Easter and Christmas) Food has been important historically in the development of a national identity in particular the traditional fenkata (i.e., the eating of stewed or fried rabbit) Potatoes are a staple of the Maltese diet as well [280]\n\n\nCustoms\nA 2010 Charities Aid Foundation study found that the Maltese were the most generous people in the world, with 83% contributing to charity [282]\n\n\nTraditions\nTraditional Maltese proverbs reveal cultural importance of childbearing and fertility: \"i≈º-≈ºwieƒ° mingƒßajr tarbija ma fihx tgawdija\" (a childless marriage cannot be a happy one) This is a belief that Malta shares with many other Mediterranean cultures In Maltese folktales the local variant of the classic closing formula, \"and they all lived happily ever after\" is \"u gƒßammru u tgƒßammru, u spiƒãƒãat\" (and they lived together, and they had children together, and the tale is finished) [284]\n\n\nFestivals and events\n\nLocal festivals, similar to those in Southern Italy, are commonplace in Malta and Gozo, celebrating weddings, christenings and, most prominently, saints' days On saints' days, in the morning, the festa reaches its apex with a High Mass featuring a sermon on the life and achievements of the patron saint In the evening, a statue of the religious patron is taken around the local streets in solemn procession, with the faithful following in prayer The atmosphere of religious devotion is preceded by several days of celebration and revelry: band marches, fireworks, and late-night parties The largest festa is possibly that of the Assumption of Mary, which is celebrated in 8 parishes on the 15 August and in 2 other parishes the following Sunday [286]\n\nMedia\nThe most widely read and financially the strongest newspapers are published by Allied Newspapers Ltd., mainly The Times of Malta (27 percent) and its Sunday edition The Sunday Times of Malta (51.6 percent) [citation needed] Due to bilingualism half of the newspapers are published in English and the other half in Maltese The Sunday newspaper It-Torƒãa (\"The Torch\") published by a subsidiary of the General Workers' Union, is the widest Maltese language paper Its sister paper, L-Orizzont (\"The Horizon\"), is the Maltese daily with the biggest circulation There is a high number of daily or weekly newspapers‚Äîone for every 28,000¬†people Advertising, sales, and subsidies are the three main methods of financing [292]\n\n\nSport\nFootball (soccer) is one of the most popular sports in Malta Other popular sports include boƒãƒãi, horse racing, gostra, regatta, water polo, clay pigeon shooting, and motorsports [298]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nSources\n\n\nAttribution\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Malta\n================\n\nMalta is a small island nation located in the central Mediterranean, with a rich history dating back to the Neolithic period. The name \"Malta\" is derived from the Italian and Maltese name for the island, which is also shared by the ancient Greek name Melita. The name is thought to be derived from the Greek word \"m√©li,\" meaning honey, which may refer to the island's natural resources or its position as a stopover for ancient traders.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nMalta has been inhabited since around 5900 BC, with the first settlers arriving from European Neolithic agriculturalists. The island was later colonized by the Phoenicians, who established a trading post on the island in around 1000 BC. The Phoenicians were followed by the Carthaginians, who controlled the island until 264 BC, when it was conquered by the Romans. Malta became a Roman province in 27 BC and remained under Roman rule until the 5th century AD.\n\nIn 870 AD, Malta was conquered by the Arabs, who introduced Islam to the island and left a lasting legacy in the Maltese language and culture. The Knights of St. John, a Christian military order, conquered Malta in 1530 and ruled the island for over 250 years. The Knights were expelled from Malta in 1798, and the island was occupied by the French until 1800.\n\nMalta became a British colony in 1813, and it remained under British rule until it gained independence in 1964. Malta joined the European Union in 2004 and adopted the euro as its official currency in 2008.\n\nGeography\n--------\n\nMalta is an archipelago located in the central Mediterranean, with a total area of around 316 square kilometers. The island is composed of three main islands: Malta, Gozo, and Comino. Malta is the largest island, with a population of around 475,000 people. Gozo is the second-largest island, with a population of around 37,000 people. Comino is a small island with a population of around 3,000 people.\n\nMalta's geography is characterized by its rocky coastline, sandy beaches, and rolling hills. The island is also home to several natural wonders, including the Blue Grotto, a sea cave that is famous for its bright blue water.\n\nClimate\n--------\n\nMalta has a Mediterranean climate, with mild winters and hot summers. The island experiences a dry season from May to October, with an average temperature of around 25¬∞C (77¬∞F). The rainy season runs from November to April, with an average temperature of around 15¬∞C (59¬∞F).\n\nEconomy\n--------\n\nMalta's economy is based on tourism, manufacturing, and financial services. The island is a popular tourist destination, with around 2.2 million visitors in 2019. The tourism industry contributes around 15% to the country's GDP.

outline:\n\n\nName\nThe English name Malta derives from Italian and Maltese Malta, from medieval Arabic MƒÅli·π≠ƒÅ (ŸÖŸéÿßŸÑŸêÿ∑Ÿéÿß), from classical Latin Melita, [41] from latinised or Doric forms [42] of the ancient Greek Mel√≠tƒì (ŒúŒµŒªŒØœÑŒ∑) of uncertain origin The name Mel√≠tƒì‚Äîshared by the Croatian island Mljet in antiquity‚Äîliterally means \"place of honey\" or \"sweetness\", derived from the combining form of m√©li (ŒºŒ≠ŒªŒπ, \"honey\" or any similarly sweet thing) [43] and the suffix -ƒì (-Œ∑) The ancient Greeks may have given the island this name after Malta's endemic subspecies of bees [44] Alternatively, other scholars argue for derivation of the Greek name from an original Phoenician or Punic Maleth (ê§åê§ãê§à, ml·π≠), meaning \"haven\" [45] or \"port\" [46] in reference to the Grand Harbour and its primary settlement at Cospicua following the sea level rise that separated the Maltese islands and flooded its original coastal settlements in the 10th century¬†BC [47] The name was then applied to all of Malta by the Greeks and to its ancient capital at Mdina by the Romans [47]\n\n\nHistory\nMalta has been inhabited from circa 5900 BC, [51] since the arrival of settlers originating from European Neolithic agriculturalists [52] Pottery found by archaeologists at the Skorba Temples resembles that found in Italy, and suggests that the Maltese islands were first settled in 5200 BC by Stone Age hunters or farmers who had arrived from Sicily, possibly the Sicani The extinction of the dwarf hippos, giant swans and dwarf elephants has been linked to the earliest arrival of humans on Malta [53] Prehistoric farming settlements dating to the Early Neolithic include Gƒßar Dalam [54] The population on Malta grew cereals, raised livestock and, in common with other ancient Mediterranean cultures, worshipped a fertility figure [55]\n\n\nPrehistory\nMalta has been inhabited from circa 5900 BC, [51] since the arrival of settlers

Mediterranean cultures, worshipped a fertility figure [55]\n\n\nPhoenicians, Carthaginians and Romans\nPhoenician traders [64] colonised the islands under the name Ann (ê§Äê§çê§ç‚Äé,  æNN) [65] [66] [47] sometime after 1000 BC [15] as a stop on their trade routes from the eastern Mediterranean to Cornwall [67] Their seat of government was apparently at Mdina, which shared the island's name; [65] [66] the primary port was at Cospicua on the Grand Harbour, which they called Maleth [47] After the fall of Phoenicia in 332 BC, the area came under the control of Carthage [15] [68] During this time, the people on Malta mainly cultivated olives and carob and produced textiles [68]\n\n\nArab period and the Middle Ages\nMalta became involved in the Arab‚ÄìByzantine wars, and the conquest of Malta is closely linked with that of Sicily that began in 827 after Admiral Euphemius' betrayal of his fellow Byzantines, requesting that the Aghlabids invade the island [78] The Muslim chronicler and geographer al-Himyari recounts that in 870, following a violent struggle against the defending Byzantines, the Arab invaders, first led by Halaf al-Hadim, and later by Sawada ibn Muhammad, [79] pillaged the island, destroying the most important buildings, and leaving it practically uninhabited until it was recolonised by the Arabs from Sicily in 1048‚Äì1049 [79] It is uncertain whether this new settlement resulted from demographic expansion in Sicily, a higher standard of living in Sicily (in which case the recolonisation may have taken place a few decades earlier), or a civil war which broke out among the Arab rulers of Sicily in 1038 [80] The Arab Agricultural Revolution introduced new irrigation, cotton, and some fruits The Siculo-Arabic language was adopted on the island from Sicily; it would eventually evolve into the Maltese language [81]\n\n\nNorman conquest\nThe Normans attacked Malta in 1091, as part of their conquest of Sicily [82] The Norman leader, Roger I of Sicily, was welcomed by Christian captives [44] The notion that Count Roger I reportedly tore off a portion of his checkered red-and-white banner and presented it to the Maltese in gratitude for having fought on his behalf, forming the basis of the modern flag of Malta, is founded in myth [44] [83]\n\n\nCrown of Aragon, the Knights of Malta and Portuguese Rule\nMalta was ruled by the House of Barcelona, the ruling dynasty of the Crown of Aragon, from 1282 to 1409, [90] with the Aragonese aiding the Maltese insurgents in the Sicilian Vespers in the naval battle in Grand Harbour in 1283 [91]\n\n\nFrench period and British conquest\nThe Knights' reign ended when Napoleon captured Malta on his way to Egypt during the French Revolutionary Wars in 1798 During 12‚Äì18 June 1798, Napoleon resided at the Palazzo Parisio in Valletta [108] [109] [110] He reformed national administration with the creation of a Government Commission, twelve municipalities, a public finance administration, the abolition of all feudal rights and privileges, the abolition of slavery and the granting of freedom to all Turkish and Jewish slaves [111] [112] On the judicial level, a family code was framed and twelve judges were nominated Public education was organised along principles laid down by Bonaparte himself, providing for primary and secondary education [112] [113] He then sailed for Egypt, leaving a substantial garrison in Malta [114]\n\n\nBritish Empire and the Second World War\nIn 1814, as part of the Treaty of Paris, [112] [117] Malta officially became a part of the British Empire and was used as a shipping way-station and fleet headquarters After the Suez Canal opened in 1869, Malta's position halfway between the Strait of Gibraltar and Egypt proved to be its main asset, and it was considered an important stop on the way to India, a central trade route for the British.\n\n\nIndependence and Republic\nMalta achieved its independence as the State of Malta on 21 September 1964 (Independence Day) Under its 1964 constitution, Malta initially retained Queen Elizabeth II as Queen of Malta and thus head of state, with a governor-general exercising executive authority on her behalf In 1971, the Malta Labour Party led by Dom Mintoff won the general elections, resulting in Malta declaring itself a republic on 13 December 1974 (Republic Day) within the Commonwealth A defence agreement was signed soon after independence, and after being re-negotiated in 1972, expired on 31 March 1979 (Freedom Day) [127] Upon its expiry, the British base closed and lands formerly controlled by the British were given to the Maltese government [128]\n\n\nPolitics\nMalta is a republic [34] whose parliamentary system and public administration are closely modelled on the Westminster system.\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nMalta has had a system of local government since 1993, [136] based on the European Charter of Local Self-Government The country is divided into six regions (one of them being Gozo), with each region having its own Regional Council, serving as the intermediate level between local government and national government [137] The regions are divided into local councils, of which there are currently 68 (54 in Malta and 14 in Gozo) The six districts (five on Malta and the sixth being Gozo) serve primarily statistical purposes [138]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe objectives of the Armed Forces of Malta (AFM) are to maintain a military organisation with the primary aim of defending the islands' integrity according to the defence roles as set by the government in an efficient and cost-effective manner This is achieved by emphasising the maintenance of Malta's territorial waters and airspace integrity [139]\n\n\nHuman rights\nMalta is regarded as one of the most LGBT-supportive countries in the world, [144] [145] and was the first nation in the European Union to prohibit conversion therapy [146] Malta also constitutionally bans discrimination based on disability [147]\nMaltese legislation recognises both civil and canonical (ecclesiastical) marriages Annulments by the ecclesiastical and civil courts are unrelated and are not necessarily mutually endorsed Malta voted in favour of divorce legislation in a referendum held on 28 May 2011 [148]\n\n\nGeography\nMalta is an archipelago in the central Mediterranean (in its eastern basin), some 80¬†km (50¬†mi) from southern Italy across the Malta Channel Only the three largest islands‚ÄîMalta (Maltese: Malta), Gozo (Gƒßawdex), and Comino (Kemmuna)‚Äîare inhabited The islands of the archipelago lie on the Malta plateau, a shallow shelf formed from the high points of a land bridge between Sicily and North Africa that became isolated as sea levels rose after the last ice age [152] The archipelago is located on the African tectonic plate [153] [154] Malta was considered an island of North Africa for centuries [155] The seabed surrounding Malta's islands retains traces of ancient geomarine features, suggesting potential archaeological discoveries that could shed light on the region's prehistoric environment  [156]\n\n\nClimate\nMalta has a Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Csa), [35] [158] with mild winters and hot summers, hotter in the inland areas Rain occurs mainly in autumn and winter, with summer being generally dry.\n\n\nUrbanisation\nAccording to Eurostat, Malta is composed of two larger urban zones nominally referred to as \"Valletta\" (the main island of Malta) and \"Gozo\" The main urban area covers the entire main island, with a population of around 400,000 [169] [170] The core of the urban area, the greater city of Valletta, has a population of 205,768 [171] According to the data from 2020 by Eurostat, the Functional Urban Area and metropolitan region covered the whole island and has a population of 480,134 [172] [173] According to the United Nations, about 95 percent of the area of Malta is urban and the number grows every year [20] According to ESPON and EU Commission studies, \"the whole territory of Malta constitutes a single urban region\" [21]\n\n\nFlora\nThe Maltese islands are home to a wide diversity of indigenous, sub-endemic and endemic plants [178] They feature many traits typical of a Mediterranean climate, such as drought resistance The most common indigenous trees on the islands are olive (Olea europaea), carob (Ceratonia siliqua), fig (Ficus carica), holm oak (Quericus ilex) and Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis), while the most common non-native trees are eucalyptus, acacia and opuntia Endemic plants include the national flower widnet il-baƒßar (Cheirolophus crassifolius), sempreviva ta' Malta (Helichrysum panormitanum subsp melitense), ≈ºigland t' Gƒßawdex (Hyoseris frutescens) and ƒ°i≈ºi ta' Malta (Matthiola incana subsp melitensis) while sub-endemics include kromb il-baƒßar (Jacobaea maritima subsp sicula) and xkattapietra (Micromeria microphylla) [179] The biodiversity of Malta is severely endangered by habitat loss, invasive species and human intervention [180]\n\n\nEconomy\nMalta is classified as an advanced economy according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) [181] Malta's major resources are limestone, a favourable geographic location and a productive labour force Malta produces only about 20 percent of its food needs, has limited fresh water supplies because of the drought in the summer, and has no domestic energy sources, aside from the potential for solar energy from its plentiful sunlight The economy is dependent on foreign trade (serving as a freight trans-shipment point), manufacturing (especially electronics and textiles), and tourism [182] Film production has contributed to the Maltese economy [183]\n\n\nBanking and finance\nThe two largest commercial banks are Bank of Valletta and HSBC Bank Malta Digital banks such as Revolut have also increased in popularity [194] The Central Bank of Malta (Bank ƒäentrali ta' Malta) has two key areas of responsibility: the formulation and implementation of monetary policy and the promotion of a sound and efficient financial system The Maltese government entered ERM II on 4 May 2005, and adopted the euro as the country's currency on 1 January 2008 [195]\n\n\nCurrency\nMaltese euro coins feature the Maltese cross on ‚Ç¨2 and ‚Ç¨1 coins, the coat of arms of Malta on the ‚Ç¨0.50, ‚Ç¨0.20 and ‚Ç¨0.10 coins, and the Mnajdra Temples on the ‚Ç¨0.05, ‚Ç¨0.02 and ‚Ç¨0.01 coins [196]\n\n\nTourism\nMalta is a popular tourist destination, with 1.6¬†million tourists per year, [197] three times more tourists visit than there are residents Tourism infrastructure has increased dramatically over the years and a number of hotels are present on the island, although overdevelopment and the destruction of traditional housing is of growing concern In 2019, Malta had a record year in tourism, recording over 2.1 million tourists in one single year [198]\n\n\nScience and technology\nMalta signed a co-operation agreement with the European Space Agency (ESA) for more-intensive co-operation in ESA projects [202]\nThe Malta Council for Science and Technology (MCST) is the civil body responsible for

Society), UESA (University Engineering Students Association) and ICTSA (University of Malta ICT Students' Association) [203] [204] Malta was ranked 29th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024 [205]\n\n\nDemographics\nAs of the 2021 census, Maltese-born natives make up the majority of the island with 386,280 people out of a total population of 519,562 [206] However, there are minorities, the largest of which by birthplace were: 15,082 from the United Kingdom, Italy (13,361), India (7,946), Philippines (7,784) and Serbia (5,935) Among racial origins for the non-Maltese, 58.1% of all identified as Caucasian, 22.2% Asian, 6.3% Arab, 6.0% African, 4.5% Hispanic or Latino and 2.9% more than one race [207]\n\n\nLanguages\nThe Maltese language (Maltese: Malti) is one of the two constitutional languages of Malta and is considered the national language The second official language is English and hence laws are enacted both in Maltese and English However, article 74 of the Constitution states that \"if there is any conflict between the Maltese and the English texts of any law, the Maltese text shall prevail.\" [34]\n\n\nReligion\nReligion in Malta (2021 census) [218] [6] [219]\n\n\nMigration\nHistorically a land of emigration, since the early 21st century Malta has seen a significant increase in net migration; the foreign-born population has grown nearly eightfold between 2005 and 2020 Most of the foreign community in Malta consists of active or retired British nationals and their dependents, centred on Sliema and surrounding suburbs Other smaller foreign groups include Italians, Libyans, and Serbians, many of whom have assimilated into the Maltese nation over the decades [235]\n\n\nEducation\nPrimary schooling has been compulsory since 1946; secondary education up to the age of sixteen was made compulsory in 1971 The state and the Church provide education free of charge, both running a number of schools in Malta and Gozo As of 2006 [update], state schools are organised into networks known as Colleges and incorporate kindergarten schools, primary and secondary schools A number of private schools are run in Malta St Catherine's High School, Pembroke offers an International Foundation Course for students wishing to learn English before entering mainstream education As of 2008 [update], there are two international schools, Verdala International School and QSI Malta The state pays a portion of the teachers' salary in Church schools [247]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nOwing to the British colonial rule, traffic in Malta drives on the left Car ownership in Malta is exceedingly high, considering the very small size of the islands; it is the fourth-highest in the European Union There were 182,254 registered cars in 1990, giving an automobile density of 577/km2 (1,494/sq¬†mi) [252] Malta has 2,254 kilometres (1,401 miles) of road, 1,972¬†km (1,225¬†mi) (87.5 per cent) of which are paved (as of December 2003) [253]\n\n\nTransport\nOwing to the British colonial rule, traffic in Malta drives on the left Car ownership in Malta is exceedingly high, considering the very small size of the islands; it is the

1,972¬†km (1,225¬†mi) (87.5 per cent) of which are paved (as of December 2003) [253]\n\n\nCommunications\nThe mobile penetration rate in Malta exceeded 100% by the end of 2009 [263] Malta uses the GSM900, UMTS(3G) and LTE(4G) mobile phone systems, which are compatible with the rest of the European countries, Australia and New Zealand [citation needed]\n\n\nHealthcare\nMalta has a long history of providing publicly funded health care The first hospital recorded in the country was already functioning by 1372 [265]\nToday, Malta has both a public healthcare system, where healthcare is free at the point of delivery, and a private healthcare system [266] [267] Malta has a strong general practitioner-delivered primary care base and the public hospitals provide secondary and tertiary care The Maltese Ministry of Health advises foreign residents to take out private medical insurance [268]\n\n\nCulture\nThe culture of Malta reflects the various cultures, that have come into contact with the Maltese Islands throughout the centuries [269]\n\n\nMusic\nWhile Maltese music today is largely Western, traditional Maltese music includes what is known as gƒßana This consists of background folk guitar music, while a few people, generally men, take it in turns to argue a point in a sing-song voice Music plays an important part in Maltese culture as each locality parades its own band club, on various occasions these being multiple per locality, and function to establish the thematic musical background to the various village feasts The Malta Philharmonic Orchestra is recognized as Malta's foremost musical institution and is notable for being called to participate in important state events.\n\n\nLiterature\nDocumented Maltese literature is over 200 years old However, a recently unearthed love ballad testifies to literary activity in the local tongue from the Medieval period Malta followed a Romantic literary tradition, culminating in the works of Dun Karm Psaila, Malta's national poet Subsequent writers like Ruzar Briffa and Karmenu Vassallo tried to estrange themselves from the rigidity of formal themes and versification [270]\n\n\nArchitecture\nMaltese architecture has been influenced by many different Mediterranean cultures and British architecture over its history [272] The first settlers on the island constructed ƒ†gantija, one of the oldest manmade freestanding structures in the world The Neolithic temple builders (3800‚Äì2500 BC) endowed the numerous temples of Malta and Gozo with intricate bas-relief designs.\n\n\nArt\nTowards the end of the 15th century, Maltese artists, like their counterparts in Sicily, came under the influence of the School of Antonello da Messina, which introduced Renaissance ideals and concepts to the decorative arts in Malta [274]\n\n\nCuisine\nMaltese cuisine shows strong Sicilian and Italian influences as well as influences of English, Spanish, Maghrebin and Proven√ßal cuisines A number of regional variations can be noted as well as seasonal variations associated with the seasonal availability of produce and Christian feasts (such as Lent, Easter and Christmas) Food has been important historically in the development of a national identity in particular the traditional fenkata (i.e., the eating of stewed or fried rabbit) Potatoes are a staple of the Maltese diet as well [280]\n\n\nCustoms\nA 2010 Charities Aid Foundation study found that the Maltese were the most generous people in the world, with 83% contributing to charity [282]\n\n\nTraditions\nTraditional Maltese proverbs reveal cultural importance of childbearing and fertility: \"i≈º-≈ºwieƒ° mingƒßajr tarbija ma fihx tgawdija\" (a childless marriage cannot be a happy one) This is a belief that Malta shares with many other Mediterranean cultures In Maltese folktales the local variant of the classic closing formula, \"and they all lived happily ever after\" is \"u gƒßammru u tgƒßammru, u spiƒãƒãat\" (and they lived together, and they had children together, and the tale is finished) [284]\n\n\nFestivals and events\n\nLocal festivals, similar to those in Southern Italy, are commonplace in Malta and Gozo, celebrating weddings, christenings and, most prominently, saints' days On saints' days, in the morning, the festa reaches its apex with a High Mass featuring a sermon on the life and achievements of the patron saint In the evening, a statue of the religious patron is taken around the local streets in solemn procession, with the faithful following in prayer The atmosphere of religious devotion is preceded by several days of celebration and revelry: band marches, fireworks, and late-night parties The largest festa is possibly that of the Assumption of Mary, which is celebrated in 8 parishes on the 15 August and in 2 other parishes the following Sunday [286]\n\nMedia\nThe most widely read and financially the strongest newspapers are published by Allied Newspapers Ltd., mainly The Times of Malta (27 percent) and its Sunday edition The Sunday Times of Malta (51.6 percent) [citation needed] Due to bilingualism half of the newspapers are published in English and the other half in Maltese The Sunday newspaper It-Torƒãa (\"The Torch\") published by a subsidiary of the General Workers' Union, is the widest Maltese language paper Its sister paper, L-Orizzont (\"The Horizon\"), is the Maltese daily with the biggest circulation There is a high number of daily or weekly newspapers‚Äîone for every 28,000¬†people Advertising, sales, and subsidies are the three main methods of financing [292]\n\n\nSport\nFootball (soccer) is one of the most popular sports in Malta Other popular sports include boƒãƒãi, horse racing, gostra, regatta, water polo, clay pigeon shooting, and motorsports [298]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nSources\n\n\nAttribution\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal

Her parents, both ballet dancers, met while performing in a show together and later moved to Melbourne, Australia, where Debicki grew up. She is the eldest of three children and began her acting career after graduating from drama school.\n\n## Early Life\n\nDebicki was born in Paris, France, to a Polish father and an Australian mother of Irish descent. Her parents were both accomplished ballet dancers who met while performing in a production of Swan Lake. When Debicki was five, the family moved to Glen Waverley, a suburb of Melbourne, Australia.

ingenuity and adaptation to harsh Ice Age environments These structures highlight their ability to organize resources and create durable shelters [14] [15] [16]\n\n\nNeolithic and Bronze Age\nThe Cucuteni-Trypillian culture (ca 4,500‚Äì3,000 BC), centered in modern-day Romania, Moldova, and Ukraine, represents one of the most advanced Neolithic civilizations in Europe These people were known for their impressive settlements, some of which were among the largest in the world at the time, with populations reaching up to 10,000 inhabitants They built concentric layouts of houses, often using clay and wood, demonstrating advanced planning They are renowned for their intricate painted ceramics, featuring geometric and symbolic designs in red, black, and white Their economy was primarily agrarian, complemented by animal husbandry and small-scale trade Archaeological findings suggest a focus on fertility cults, as evidenced by numerous figurines and symbolic artifacts The Cucuteni-Trypillian culture began to decline around 3000 BC, possibly due to environmental changes, resource depletion, or pressures from neighboring steppe cultures [18]\n\n\nAntiquity\nDuring the Iron Age, the region witnessed the rise and interaction of diverse peoples and cultures Following earlier Bronze Age societies, the Dacians, alongside nomadic groups such as the Cimmerians (associated with the Novocherkassk archaeological culture), Scythians, and Sarmatians, dominated the landscape Among these, the Scythians established a powerful kingdom that flourished between 750 and 250 BC, characterized by their mastery of mounted warfare and trade networks spanning vast territories [22]\n\n\nScythian settlement, Greek colonization, and Roman domination\nDuring the Iron Age, the region witnessed the rise and interaction of diverse peoples and cultures Following earlier Bronze Age societies, the Dacians, alongside nomadic groups such as the Cimmerians (associated with the Novocherkassk archaeological culture), Scythians, and Sarmatians, dominated the landscape Among these, the Scythians established a powerful kingdom that flourished between 750 and 250 BC, characterized by their mastery of mounted warfare and trade networks spanning vast territories [22]\n\n\nArrival of the Goths and Huns\nIn the 3rd century AD, the Goths, a Germanic people originally from Scandinavia, began migrating toward Eastern Europe By approximately 250 to 375 AD, they had settled in the area of modern Ukraine, which they referred to as Oium This region is linked to the archaeological Chernyakhov culture, known for its unique mix of local and Gothic influences [30]\n\n\nMiddle Ages\nFollowing the power vacuum left by the fall of Hunnic and Gothic dominance, the Early Slavs began to expand over much of the territory that is now Ukraine during the 5th century, continuing their migration into the Balkans in the 6th century The exact origins of the Early Slavs remain uncertain, though several theories suggest they may have originated near the Polesia region, a marshy area between modern-day Belarus and Ukraine This period marks a transition from the Kyiv culture to the establishment of Slavic tribes across Eastern Europe [37]\n\n\nEarly Slavs\nFollowing the power vacuum left by the fall of Hunnic and Gothic dominance, the Early Slavs began to expand over much of the territory that is now Ukraine during the 5th century, continuing their migration into the Balkans in the 6th century The exact origins of the Early Slavs remain uncertain, though several theories suggest they may have originated near the Polesia region, a marshy area between modern-day Belarus and Ukraine This period marks a transition from the Kyiv culture to the establishment of Slavic tribes across Eastern Europe [37]\n\n\nArrival of the Bulgars and Khazars\nIn the 7th century, the territory of modern Ukraine was at the core of the state of the Bulgars, often referred to as Old Great Bulgaria This state, with its capital at Phanagoria (located in what is now the Taman Peninsula), controlled a significant part of the northern Black Sea region The Bulgars, a semi-nomadic people from Central Asia, were known for their sophisticated society, military organization, and far-reaching influence [30]\n\n\nKievan Rus' (9th century‚Äì1240)\nThe origins of the Kievan state and the etymology of its name, Rus', continue to be subjects of scholarly debate One theory, often called the 'Norman theory', posits that the term Rus' originated from the Scandinavian Varangians, who were active in trade and military ventures across Eastern Europe in the early medieval period Proponents of this theory argue that the Varangians, also known as the Rus', initially brought a political and military influence that shaped the emerging state structure, with the term Rus' eventually becoming synonymous with the region and its people [42]\n\n\nOrigin and foundation of state\nThe origins of the Kievan state and the etymology of its name, Rus', continue to be subjects of scholarly debate One theory, often called the 'Norman theory', posits that the term Rus' originated from the Scandinavian Varangians, who were active in trade and military ventures across Eastern Europe in the early medieval period Proponents of this theory argue that the Varangians, also known as the Rus', initially brought a political and military influence that shaped the emerging state structure, with the term Rus' eventually becoming synonymous with the region and its people [42]\n\n\nGolden Age and Christianisation\nDuring the reign of Vladimir the Great, Kievan Rus' expanded significantly, notably through the conquest and annexation of Red Ruthenia, Transcarpathia, and Korsun These territorial gains made Kievan Rus' the largest state in Europe at the time, covering over 800,000 square kilometers and boasting a population of more than 5 million The socio-economic structure of Kievan Rus' was similar to that of other European states of the period, characterized by a natural economy, communal land ownership, and reliance on slash-and-burn agriculture, and animal husbandry [58]\n\n\nFeudal fragmentation\nThe feudal fragmentation of Kievan Rus' began in the late 11th century, driven by a complex interplay of internal and external factors One significant factor was the rotational succession system, allowing power to pass among male relatives instead of directly from father to son This system often sparked conflicts, as competing claims to power emerged With princes often granted specific territories, autonomous principalities began to emerge clearly Regional cities such as Chernihiv, Polotsk, and Novgorod gained power and asserted their independence, with local elites increasing their influence By this time, the authority of the Grand Prince of Kiev was notably weakening Regional princes, bolstered by local resources and armies, began to resist central control Additionally, the vast geography and economic diversity of Rus' impeded unity, as various regions developed their own trade routes and systems External threats from nomadic groups, such as the Pechenegs and Polovtsy (Cumans), further exacerbated regionalism, compelling local rulers to focus on defending their territories [64] [65]\n\n\nMongol invasion of Kievan Rus'\nIn 1222, a new wave of nomads‚Äîthe warlike Mongols‚Äîarrived in the Black Sea steppes and defeated the Polovtsians as part of the Mongol Empire's westward expansion The Polovtsians, who had family ties with the Rus' princes, turned to Rus' for help A joint Rus'-Polovtsian force marched into the steppes, where the Battle of the Kalka River took place in 1223 Following the battle, the Mongols retreated eastward for approximately 15 years [75]\n\n\nKingdom of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia\nThe Principality‚Äîlater the Kingdom of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia (Ruthenia)‚Äîemerged from the disintegration of Kievan Rus' Its rulers continued the political and cultural legacy of Kiev, preserving the traditions and governance of the Rus' state even as Kiev fell to Mongol control [80] [81] Previously, Vladimir the Great had established the cities of Halych and Volodymyr as regional capitals, setting the foundation for future political entities in the region The area was originally inhabited by the Dulebes, Tivertsi, and White Croats tribes [82] Initially, Volhynia and Galicia existed as separate principalities, each ruled by descendants of Yaroslav the Wise Galicia was governed by the Rostislavich dynasty, while Volhynia was initially ruled by the Igorevichs and eventually by the Iziaslavich dynasty [83] During the reign of Yaroslav Osmomysl (1153‚Äì1187), Galicia expanded its influence, extending as far as the Black Sea [83]\n\n\nForeign domination\nFrom the 13th century onwards, various parts of the coastline of what is now Ukraine were dominated by the Republic of Genoa, which established numerous colonies around the Black Sea Many of these colonies were located in today's Odesa Oblast The Genoese settlements were heavily fortified, protected by garrisons stationed within the fortresses, and served primarily to strengthen Genoa‚Äôs control over trade in the Black Sea region Genoa's dominance persisted until the 15th century [96] [97] [98]\n\n\nEarly modern period\nAfter the Union of Lublin in 1569 and the formation of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, Ukraine came under Polish administration, becoming part of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland This period marked a significant shift in the region's political and social landscape Following the establishment of the Commonwealth, there was a renewed effort to colonize the lands of Ukraine, leading to the foundation of many new towns and villages These developments also facilitated the expansion of connections between various Ukrainian regions, such as Halych Land (Galicia) and Volhynia, helping to strengthen internal links within the Ukrainian lands [106]\n\n\nPolish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth\nAfter the Union of Lublin in 1569 and the formation of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, Ukraine came under Polish administration, becoming part of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland This period marked a significant shift in the region's political and social landscape Following the establishment of the Commonwealth, there was a renewed effort to colonize the lands of Ukraine, leading to the foundation of many new towns and villages These developments also facilitated the expansion of connections between various Ukrainian regions, such as Halych Land (Galicia) and Volhynia, helping to strengthen internal links within the Ukrainian lands [106]\n\n\nCossack era\nThe Cossack Hetmanate, also known as the Hetmanate of Ukraine, was a self-governing Cossack state that existed from 1649 to 1764 It emerged during a turbulent period in Eastern Europe, following the 1648 Ukrainian Cossack (Kozak) rebellion, or Khmelnytsky Uprising, which aimed to liberate Ukrainian lands from Polish-Lithuanian control This uprising, led by Bohdan Khmelnytsky, destabilized the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and began an era of chaos in Ukrainian history known as the \"Ruin\" (referred to as \"the Deluge\" in Polish history) The newly-formed Cossack Hetmanate soon found itself caught in a complex web of military and diplomatic conflicts with the Ottoman Empire, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and the Tsardom of Muscovy [110]\n\n\nCossack Hetmanate (1649‚Äì1764)\nThe Cossack Hetmanate, also known as the Hetmanate of Ukraine, was a self-governing Cossack state that existed from 1649 to 1764 It emerged during a turbulent period in Eastern Europe, following the 1648 Ukrainian Cossack (Kozak)

military and diplomatic conflicts with the Ottoman Empire, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and the Tsardom of Muscovy [110]\n\n\nLiquidation of the Zaporozhian Sich\nDuring the 18th century, the Russian Empire steadily replaced its earlier \"protection\" over central Ukraine with direct control, gradually eroding the autonomy of the Cossacks The Cossack uprisings, which had once been directed against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, now shifted focus to the Russian authorities However, by the late 18th century, these uprisings had largely petered out, weakened by the overwhelming power of the Russian state and internal divisions within the Cossack ranks [117]\n\n\nModern history\nUnder the reign of Alexander I (1801‚Äì1825), the Russian presence in Ukraine was largely limited to the imperial army and its bureaucracy However, by the reign of Nicholas I (1825‚Äì1855), Russia had established a centralized administration in Ukraine After suppressing the November Uprising of 1830, the tsarist regime implemented Russification policies, particularly on the Right-bank Ukraine [125]\n\n\nEmpires and Ukrainian National Revival\nUnder the reign of Alexander I (1801‚Äì1825), the Russian presence in Ukraine was largely limited to the imperial army and its bureaucracy However, by the reign of Nicholas I (1825‚Äì1855), Russia had established a centralized administration in Ukraine After suppressing the November Uprising of 1830, the tsarist regime implemented Russification policies, particularly on the Right-bank Ukraine [125]\n\n\nWar of Independence (1917‚Äì1922)\nWorld War I and the wave of revolutions that swept across Europe‚Äîincluding the October Revolution in Russia‚Äîshattered empires such as the Austro-Hungarian and Russian Empires, leaving Ukraine caught in the midst of geopolitical upheaval Between 1917 and 1919, several Ukrainian republics declared independence, marking the emergence of a complex array of states and territories seeking sovereignty Among these were the Ukrainian People's Republic, the Ukrainian State, the West Ukrainian People's Republic, the Makhnovshchina, the Kholodny Yar Republic, and the Kuban People's Republic Concurrently, a number of Bolshevik revolutionary committees, or revkoms, sought to establish Soviet power, leading to the formation of various Soviet-aligned entities, including the Ukrainian People's Republic of Soviets, the Odessa Soviet Republic, the Donetsk‚ÄìKrivoy Rog Soviet Republic, the Ukrainian Soviet Republic, the Taurida Soviet Socialist Republic, the Galician Soviet Socialist Republic, and the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic Each of these republics and regimes represented different visions for Ukraine's future, reflecting the era's ideological and territorial conflicts that would profoundly impact the region.\n\n\nUkrainian People's Republic\nThe Ukrainian People's Republic (UPR) was officially proclaimed on November 20, 1917, amidst the turmoil of the Russian Revolution and the disintegration of the Russian Empire Initially, the Ukrainian Central Council (Rada), comprising influential Ukrainian political figures, pursued autonomy within a federated Russia However, as the political situation in Russia grew increasingly unstable, the UPR took a decisive step by declaring full independence on January 22, 1918 [128]\n\n\nThe first Bolshevik revkoms\nAs the Bolsheviks sought to expand their influence across the former territories of the Russian Empire, Ukraine became a significant battleground In December 1917, amidst the chaos of the Russian Revolution and the collapse of imperial power, the Ukrainian People's Republic of Soviets was proclaimed This was a direct challenge to the Ukrainian People's Republic, which had declared its independence from the Russian Empire earlier that year The UPR, led by nationalists and democrats, sought to build an independent Ukrainian state In contrast, the Bolshevik-backed People's Republic of Soviets aimed to bring Ukraine under Soviet control and align it with the goals of the Russian Bolsheviks [130]\n\n\nUkrainian State\nAmid growing unrest, a coup d'√©tat led by General Pavlo Skoropadskyi on April 29, 1918, dismantled the UPR and established the Ukrainian State, also known as the Hetmanate Skoropadskyi, a former officer in the Russian Imperial Army, assumed the title of Hetman of all Ukraine, aiming to create a strong, centralized state with close ties to the German Empire and Austria-Hungary His vision for the Hetmanate included restoring order, promoting economic development, and implementing agrarian reforms to stabilize the economy and society [133]\n\n\nWest Ukrainian People's Republic\nSimultaneously, a separate Ukrainian state was established in the western part of the country The West Ukrainian People's Republic (WUPR) was proclaimed on October 19, 1918, following the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire This new state centered around Eastern Galicia, including the key city of Lviv, and extended into parts of Bukovina and Transcarpathia, areas with substantial Ukrainian populations The WUPR government, led by Yevhen Petrushevych, aspired to build an independent Ukrainian state in Western Ukraine, distinct from both Polish and Russian influences [136] [137]\n\n\nUnification Act\nIn an effort to consolidate their positions during a tumultuous period, UPR and WUPR formally united on January 22, 1919, through the signing of the Unification Act (Act Zluky) This historic declaration symbolized the unification of the two republics into a single Ukrainian state Despite its significance as a milestone for Ukrainian national aspirations, the unification remained largely symbolic in practice The lack of effective integration between the UPR and WUPR resulted in minimal military coordination or mutual support Both entities were preoccupied with their respective military challenges: the UPR was engaged in a desperate struggle against advancing Bolshevik forces, while the WUPR was embroiled in a conflict with Polish troops over territorial claims in Eastern Galicia [140]\n\n\nOthers states and anti-Bolshevik movements\nThe Makhnovshchina, which existed from 1918 to 1921, was a revolutionary anarchist movement in southern Ukraine led by Nestor Makhno It emerged during the chaos of the Russian Civil War The Makhnovists aimed to establish a stateless, self-managed society based on anarchist principles, where peasants and workers controlled the land and factories Makhno's forces fought against various powers, including the Bolsheviks, the White Army, and foreign invaders Despite initial successes, the movement was eventually crushed by the Bolsheviks [141]\n\n\nContinued struggle and exile of the UPR government\nAfter being driven out of Kyiv by Bolshevik forces in early 1919, the UPR government, led by Symon Petliura, continued to resist Bolshevik advances and Polish encroachment By 1920, facing insurmountable odds and a deteriorating military position, Petliura sought an alliance with Poland In April 1920, the Treaty of Warsaw was signed, under which the UPR agreed to recognize Polish control over Western Ukraine in exchange for Polish military support against the Bolsheviks [148]\n\n\nFormation of the Ukrainian SSR\nAs both the UPR and WUPR faced defeat, the Bolshevik forces consolidated their control over Ukraine On December 30, 1919, the Bolsheviks proclaimed the establishment of the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic (Ukrainian SSR), positioning it as a satellite of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) The new Soviet government aimed to establish complete Soviet authority over all Ukrainian territories, incorporating Ukraine into the broader framework of Soviet expansion [10]\n\n\nUkraine in Soviet Union (1922‚Äì1991)\nIn the 1920s, the Soviet government implemented a policy of \"Ukrainization\" as part of its broader strategy to strengthen support for the Soviet regime in non-Russian republics This policy encouraged the use of the Ukrainian language in education, government, and media Ukrainian culture and history were promoted to win over the local population and intellectual elite Ukrainization allowed a degree of cultural revival after years of Russian dominance in Ukraine Ukrainian literature, theater, and arts experienced significant growth, and schools began teaching in the Ukrainian language However, this policy was carefully controlled by the Communist Party, ensuring that cultural development aligned with Soviet ideology [154]\n\n\nUkrainization and New Economic Policy\nIn the 1920s, the Soviet government implemented a policy of \"Ukrainization\" as part of its broader strategy to strengthen support for the Soviet regime in non-Russian republics This policy encouraged the use of the Ukrainian language in education, government, and media Ukrainian culture and history were promoted to win over the local population and intellectual elite Ukrainization allowed a degree of cultural revival after years of Russian dominance in Ukraine Ukrainian literature, theater, and arts experienced significant growth, and schools began teaching in the Ukrainian language However, this policy was carefully controlled by the Communist Party, ensuring that cultural development aligned with Soviet ideology [154]\n\n\nForced collectivization, industrialization and Holodomor\nIn 1929, Joseph Stalin launched a campaign of forced collectivization across the Soviet Union, including Ukraine The policy aimed to consolidate individual peasant farms into large, state-controlled collective farms (kolkhozes) to increase agricultural productivity and secure grain supplies for rapid industrialization Ukrainian peasants, particularly wealthier ones known as \"kulaks\", resisted collectivization The Soviet regime responded with brutal force, seizing land, livestock, and grain, and deporting or executing those who resisted Collectivization led to widespread chaos in rural areas Agricultural output plummeted due to poor planning, lack of incentives, and resistance from the peasantry The disruption of traditional farming practices and the state's requisition of grain exacerbated food shortages [157]\n\n\nPolitical repression and the Great Purge\nThroughout the 1930s, Stalin's regime became increasingly marked by paranoia and a relentless drive to eradicate any perceived threats to his authority This climate of suspicion fueled widespread political repression across the Soviet Union, profoundly impacting every layer of society in Ukraine The purges specifically targeted Ukrainian intellectuals, artists, political leaders, and ordinary citizens suspected of harboring nationalist sympathies or potential dissenting views Stalin‚Äôs objective was clear: to eliminate any possible source of opposition to Soviet rule, no matter how tenuous or imagined [161]\n\n\nWorld War II\nThe Second World War began on 1 September 1939, when Hitler invaded the Western part of Poland Sixteen days later, the Soviet Union took most of Eastern Poland Nazi Germany with its allies invaded the Soviet Union in 1941 Between 4.5 and 6 million Ukrainians fought in the Soviet Army against the Nazis [167] Some Ukrainians initially regarded the Wehrmacht soldiers as liberators from Soviet rule, while others formed a partisan movement Some elements of the Ukrainian nationalist underground formed a Ukrainian Insurgent Army that fought both Soviet forces and the Nazis Others collaborated with the Germans The pro-Polish trend in the Ukrainian national movement, declaring loyalty to the Second Polish Republic and in return demanding autonomy for Ukrainians (e.g Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance), became marginalized, mainly due to its rejection by the Polish side, where supporters of forced assimilation of Ukrainians into Polish culture dominated [168] Some 1.5 million Jews were murdered by the Nazis during their occupation [169] In Volhynia, Ukrainian fighters committed a massacre against up to 100,000 Polish civilians [170] Residual small groups of the UPA-partizans acted near the Polish and Soviet border as long as to the 1950s [171] Galicia, Volhynia, South Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina, and Carpathian Ruthenia that were annexed as a result of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact in 1939 were added to the Ukrainian SSR.\n\n\nPost-war Ukrainian SSR\nIn the aftermath of the war, amendments to the Constitution of the Ukrainian SSR allowed it to act as a distinct entity in international law while remaining an integral part of the Soviet Union These changes enabled Ukraine to become one of the founding members of the United Nations (UN) in 1945, alongside the Soviet Union and the Byelorussian SSR This arrangement was part of a geopolitical compromise with the United States, designed to balance representation in the UN General Assembly, which was perceived by the Soviet Union as skewed in favor of the Western bloc Within the UN framework, the Ukrainian SSR actively participated in global diplomacy, even serving as an elected member of the United Nations Security Council in 1948‚Äì1949 and again in 1984‚Äì1985 [citation needed]\n\n\nThe Path to Independence\nBy 1990, calls for Ukrainian sovereignty reached a fever pitch, fueled by decades of cultural suppression, economic exploitation, and a growing national consciousness among Ukrainians On 21 January 1990, one of the most iconic demonstrations of unity and determination occurred when over 300,000 Ukrainians formed the \"human chain\" stretching from Kyiv to Lviv This symbolic act, known as the \"Chain of Unity\", marked the anniversary of the Unification Act of the Ukrainian People's Republic and the West Ukrainian People's Republic in 1919 It highlighted the nation's steadfast commitment to reclaiming its independence, emphasizing the unity between eastern and western Ukraine [179]\n\n\nContemporary history\nOn August 24, 1991, following the failed August Coup in Moscow, the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian Parliament) declared Ukraine‚Äôs independence from the Soviet Union [182] This historic decision was reinforced by a nationwide referendum on December 1, 1991, where over 90% of voters supported independence, with majorities in every region (including 56% in Crimea) [184] That same day, Ukraine held its first presidential election, a pivotal moment in its post-Soviet history Leonid Kravchuk, a former high-ranking Soviet official, won the election,

Soviet Union [182] This historic decision was reinforced by a nationwide referendum on December 1, 1991, where over 90% of voters supported independence, with majorities in every region (including 56% in Crimea) [184] That same day, Ukraine held its first presidential election, a pivotal moment in its post-Soviet history Leonid Kravchuk, a former high-ranking Soviet official, won the election,

internal political challenges [185]\n\n\nStrengthening and growing contradictions\nThe third presidential election in Ukraine took place in 1999, resulting in a victory for Leonid Kuchma, who defeated Petro Symonenko in the run-off This secured Kuchma a second consecutive term However, his second term was plagued by widespread controversies, including allegations of authoritarianism, pervasive corruption scandals, curtailment of media freedoms, and large-scale public protests that challenged his leadership and legitimacy [200]\n\n\nOrange Revolution and Euromaidan\nIn 2004, Kuchma announced that he would not run for re-election Two major candidates emerged in the 2004 presidential election Viktor Yanukovych, [211] the incumbent Prime Minister, supported by both Kuchma and by the Russian Federation, wanted closer ties with Russia The main opposition candidate, Viktor Yushchenko, called for Ukraine to turn its attention westward and aim to eventually join the EU.\n\n\nWestern Integration\nOn 1 January 2016, Ukraine joined the DCFTA with the EU Ukrainian citizens were granted visa-free travel to the Schengen Area for up to 90 days during any 180-day period on 11 June 2017, and the Association Agreement formally came into effect on 1 September 2017 [227] Significant achievements in the foreign policy arena include support for anti-Russian sanctions, obtaining a visa-free regime with the countries of the European Union, and better recognition of the need to overcome extremely difficult tasks within the country However, the old local authorities did not want any changes; they were cleansed of anti-Maidan activists (lustration), but only in part The fight against corruption was launched, but was limited to sentences of petty officials and electronic declarations, and the newly established NABU and NACP were marked by scandals in their work Judicial reform was combined with the appointment of old, compromised judges The investigation of crimes against Maidan residents was delayed In order to counteract the massive global Russian anti-Ukrainian propaganda of the \"information war\", the Ministry of Information Policy was created, which for 5 years did not show effective work, except for the ban on Kaspersky Lab, Dr.Web, 1–°, Mail.ru, Yandex and Russian social networks VKontakte or Odnoklassniki and propaganda media In 2017, the president signed the law \"On Education\", which met with opposition from national minorities, and quarreled with the Government of Hungary [citation needed] [228]\n\n\nRusso-Ukrainian War\nIn March 2014, the Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation occurred Although official results of a referendum on Crimean reunification with Russia were reported as showing a large majority in favor of the proposition, the vote was organized under Russian military occupation and was denounced by the European Union and the United States as illegal [241]\n\n\nNational historiography\nKnowledge about Ukraine in other parts of the world came chiefly from Russian secondary sources until relatively recently After the second half of the seventeenth century, when Muscovy and later the Russian Empire came to control much of Ukrainian territory, Russian writers included Ukraine as part of Russian history This included referring to medieval Kievan Rus' as \"Kievan Russia\" and its Old East Slavic culture and inhabitants as \"Kievan Russian\" or \"Old Russian\" Later Ukraine or its parts were called \"Little Russia\", \"South Russia\", \"West Russia\" (with Belarus), or \"New Russia\" (the Black Sea coast and southeastern steppe) But parts of Ukraine beyond Russia's reach were called Ruthenia and its people Ruthenians The names chosen to refer to Ukraine and Ukrainians have often reflected a certain political position, and sometimes even to deny the existence of Ukrainian nationality [30]:‚Ää10‚Äì11‚Ää The Russian point-of-view of Ukrainian history became the prevailing one in Western academia, and although the bias was identified as early as the 1950s, many scholars of Slavic studies and history believe significant changes are still necessary to correct the Moscow-centric view [274]\n\n\nCanadian historiography on Ukraine\nIn Soviet Ukraine, twentieth-century historians were strictly limited in the range of models and topics they could cover, with Moscow insisting on an official Marxist approach However, √©migr√© Ukrainians in Canada developed an independent scholarship that ignored Marxism, and shared the Western tendencies in historiography [282] George W Simpson and Orest Subtelny were leaders promoting Ukrainian studies in Canadian academe [283] The lack of independence in Ukraine meant that traditional historiographical emphases on diplomacy and politics were handicapped The flourishing of social history after 1960 opened many new approaches for researchers in Canada; Subtelny used the modernization model Later historiographical trends were quickly adapted to the Ukrainian evidence, with special focus on Ukrainian nationalism The new cultural history, post-colonial studies, and the \"linguistic turn\" augmenting, if not replacing social history, allowed for multiple angles of approach By 1991, historians in Canada had freely explored a wide range of approaches regarding the emergence of a national identity After independence, a high priority in Canada was assisting in the freeing of Ukrainian scholarship from Soviet-Marxist orthodoxy‚Äîwhich downplayed Ukrainian nationalism and insisted that true Ukrainians were always trying to reunite with Russia Independence from Moscow meant freedom from an orthodoxy that was never well suited to Ukrainian developments Scholars in Ukraine welcomed the \"national paradigm\" that Canadian historians had helped develop Since 1991, the study of Ukrainian nation-building became an increasingly global and collaborative enterprise, with scholars from Ukraine studying and working in Canada, and with conferences on related topics attracting scholars from around the world [284]\n\n\nSee also\n Media related to History of Ukraine at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\nNotes\n Media related to History of

empires, and civilizations contributing to its development. The country's strategic location at the crossroads of Europe and Asia has made it a significant player in international politics, trade, and culture.\n\n**Prehistory**\n\nThe discovery of 1.4-million-year-old stone tools in Korolevo, located in western Ukraine, marks one of the earliest securely dated presences of hominins in Europe. These tools offer crucial insights into the behaviors and adaptive strategies of early members of the genus Homo, likely Homo erectus, as they expanded into the continent during the Lower Paleolithic period.\n\n**Neolithic and Bronze Age**\n\nThe Cucuteni-Trypillian culture (ca 4,500‚Äì3,000 BC), centered in modern-day Romania, Moldova, and Ukraine, represents one of the most advanced Neolithic civilizations in Europe. These people were known for their impressive settlements, some of which were among the largest in the world at the time, with populations reaching up to 10,000 inhabitants. They built concentric layouts of houses, often using clay and wood, demonstrating advanced planning. Their economy was primarily agrarian, complemented by animal husbandry and small-scale trade.\n\n**Antiquity**\n\nDuring the Iron Age, the region witnessed the rise and interaction of diverse peoples and cultures. Following earlier Bronze Age societies, the Dacians, alongside nomadic groups such as the Cimmerians, Scythians, and Sarmatians, dominated the landscape. Among these, the Scythians established a powerful kingdom that flourished between 750 and 250 BC, characterized by their mastery of mounted warfare and trade networks spanning vast territories.\n\n**Scythian settlement, Greek colonization, and Roman domination**\n\nThe Scythians established a powerful kingdom that flourished between 750 and 250 BC, characterized by their mastery of mounted warfare and trade networks spanning vast territories. The Scythians interacted with various neighboring cultures, including the Greeks, who established colonies in the region. The Romans later conquered the region, incorporating it into their vast empire.\n\n**Arrival of the Goths and Huns**\n\nIn the 3rd century AD, the Goths, a Germanic people originally from Scandinavia, began migrating toward Eastern Europe. By approximately 250 to 375 AD, they had settled in the area of modern Ukraine, which they referred to as Oium. This region is linked to the archaeological Chernyakhov culture, known for its unique mix of local and Gothic influences.\n\n**Middle Ages**\n\nFollowing the power vacuum left by the fall of Hunnic and Gothic dominance, the Early Slavs began to expand over much of the territory that is now Ukraine during the 5th century, continuing their migration into the Balkans in the 6th century. The exact origins of the Early Slavs remain uncertain, though several theories suggest they may have originated near the Polesia region, a marshy area between modern-day Belarus and Ukraine.\n\n**Early Slavs**\n\nThe Early Slavs began to expand over much of the territory that is now Ukraine during the 5th century, continuing their migration into the Balkans in the 6th century. The exact origins of the Early Slavs remain uncertain, though several theories suggest they may have originated near the Polesia region, a marshy area between modern-day Belarus and Ukraine.\n\n**Arrival of the Bulgars and Khazars**\n\nIn the 7th century, the territory of modern Ukraine was at the core of the state of the Bulgars, often referred to as Old Great Bulgaria. This state, with its capital at Phanagoria (located in what is now the Taman Peninsula), controlled a significant part of the northern Black Sea region.\n\n**Kievan Rus' (9th century‚Äì1240)**\n\nThe origins of the Kievan state and the etymology of its name, Rus', continue to be subjects of scholarly debate. One theory, often called the 'Norman theory', posits that the term Rus' originated from the Scandinavian Varangians, who were active in trade and military ventures across Eastern Europe in the early medieval period.\n\n**Origin and foundation of state**\n\nThe origins of the Kievan state and the etymology of its name, Rus', continue to be subjects of scholarly debate. One theory, often called the 'Norman theory', posits that the term Rus' originated from the Scandinavian Varangians, who were active in trade and military ventures across Eastern Europe in the early medieval period.\n\n**Golden Age and Christianisation**\n\nDuring the reign of Vladimir the Great, Kievan Rus' expanded significantly, notably through the conquest and annexation of Red Ruthenia, Transcarpathia, and Korsun. These territorial gains made Kievan Rus' the largest state in Europe at the time, covering over 800,000 square kilometers and boasting a population of more than 5 million.\n\n**Feudal fragmentation**\n\nThe feudal fragmentation of Kievan Rus' began in the late 11th century, driven by a complex interplay of internal and external factors. One significant factor was the rotational succession system, allowing power to pass among male relatives instead of directly from father to son.\n\n**Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus'**\n\nIn 1222, a new wave of nomads‚Äîthe warlike Mongols‚Äîarrived in the Black Sea steppes and defeated the Polovtsians as part of the Mongol Empire's westward expansion. The Polovtsians, who had family ties with the Rus' princes, turned to Rus' for help.\n\n**Kingdom of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia**\n\nThe Principality‚Äîlater the Kingdom of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia (Ruthenia)‚Äîemerged from the disintegration of Kievan Rus'. Its rulers continued the political and cultural legacy of Kiev, preserving the traditions and governance of the Rus' state even as Kiev fell to Mongol control.\n\n**Cossack era**\n\nThe Cossack Hetmanate, also known as the Hetmanate of Ukraine, was a self-governing Cossack state that existed from 1649 to 1764. It emerged during a turbulent period in Eastern Europe, following the 1648 Ukrainian Cossack (Kozak) rebellion, or Khmelnytsky Uprising, which aimed to liberate Ukrainian lands from Polish-Lithuanian control.\n\n**Liquidation of the Zaporozhian Sich**\n\nDuring the 18th century, the Russian Empire steadily replaced its earlier \"protection\" over central Ukraine with direct control, gradually eroding the autonomy of the Cossacks. The Cossack uprisings, which had once been directed against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, now shifted focus to the Russian authorities.\n\n**Modern history**\n\nUnder the reign of Alexander I (1801‚Äì1825), the Russian presence in Ukraine was largely limited to the imperial army and its bureaucracy. However, by the reign of Nicholas I (1825‚Äì1855), Russia had established a centralized administration in Ukraine.\n\n**Forced collectivization, industrialization, and Holodomor**\n\nIn 1929, Joseph Stalin launched a campaign of forced collectivization across the Soviet Union, including Ukraine. This policy aimed to consolidate individual peasant farms into large, state-controlled collective farms (kolkhozes) to increase agricultural productivity and secure grain supplies for rapid industrialization.\n\n**Political repression and the Great Purge**\n\nThroughout the 1930s, Stalin's regime became increasingly marked by paranoia and a relentless drive to eradicate any perceived threats to his authority. This climate of suspicion fueled widespread political repression across the Soviet Union, profoundly impacting every layer of society in Ukraine.\n\n**World War II**\n\nThe Second World War began on 1 September 1939, when Hitler invaded the Western part of Poland. Sixteen days later, the Soviet Union took most of Eastern Poland. Between 4.5 and 6 million Ukrainians fought in the Soviet Army against the Nazis.\n\n**Recent history**\n\nOn August 24, 1991, following the failed August Coup in Moscow, the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian Parliament) declared Ukraine's independence from the Soviet Union. This historic decision was reinforced by a nationwide referendum on December 1, 1991, where over 90% of voters supported independence, with majorities in every region.\n\n**National historiography**\n\nKnowledge about Ukraine in other parts of the world came chiefly from Russian secondary sources until relatively recently.

There are various teaching and study guides available that provide a comprehensive overview of the subject.\n\n**Primary sources in English**\n\nThere are several primary sources available in English that provide a firsthand account of the history of Ukraine. These sources include documents, letters, and diaries from the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n**Ukrainian language**\n\nThe history of Ukraine is an important aspect of Ukrainian culture and identity. The Ukrainian language is a crucial part of this history, and there are various resources available for learning the language.\n\n**Further reading**\n\nThere are numerous books, articles, and online resources available for further reading on the history of Ukraine. These sources provide a more in-depth look at specific periods and events in Ukrainian history.\n\n**External links**\n\nThere are several external links available that provide additional information on the history of Ukraine.

granted specific territories, autonomous principalities began to emerge clearly Regional cities such as Chernihiv, Polotsk, and Novgorod gained power and asserted their independence, with local elites increasing their influence By this time, the authority of the Grand Prince of Kiev was notably weakening Regional princes, bolstered by local resources and armies, began to resist central control Additionally, the vast geography and economic diversity of Rus' impeded unity, as various regions developed their own trade routes and systems External threats from nomadic groups, such as the Pechenegs and Polovtsy (Cumans), further exacerbated regionalism, compelling local rulers to focus on defending their territories [64] [65]\n\n\nMongol invasion of Kievan Rus'\nIn 1222, a new wave of

White Croats tribes [82] Initially, Volhynia and Galicia existed as separate principalities, each ruled by descendants of Yaroslav the Wise Galicia was governed by the Rostislavich dynasty, while Volhynia was initially ruled by the Igorevichs and eventually by the Iziaslavich dynasty [83] During the reign of Yaroslav Osmomysl (1153‚Äì1187), Galicia expanded its influence, extending as far as the Black Sea [83]\n\n\nForeign domination\nFrom the 13th century onwards, various parts of the coastline of what is now Ukraine were dominated by the Republic of Genoa, which established numerous colonies around the Black Sea Many of these colonies were located in today's Odesa Oblast The Genoese settlements were heavily fortified, protected by garrisons stationed within the fortresses, and

were the Ukrainian People's Republic, the Ukrainian State, the West Ukrainian People's Republic, the Makhnovshchina, the Kholodny Yar Republic, and the Kuban People's Republic Concurrently, a number of Bolshevik revolutionary committees, or revkoms, sought to establish Soviet power, leading to the formation of various Soviet-aligned entities, including the Ukrainian People's Republic of Soviets, the Odessa Soviet Republic, the Donetsk‚ÄìKrivoy Rog Soviet Republic, the Ukrainian Soviet Republic, the Taurida Soviet Socialist Republic, the Galician Soviet Socialist Republic, and the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic Each of these republics and regimes represented different visions for Ukraine's future, reflecting the era's ideological and territorial conflicts that would profoundly impact the region.\n\n\nUkrainian People's Republic\nThe Ukrainian People's Republic (UPR) was officially proclaimed on November 20, 1917, amidst the turmoil of the Russian Revolution and the disintegration of the Russian Empire Initially, the Ukrainian Central Council (Rada), comprising influential Ukrainian political figures, pursued autonomy within a federated Russia However, as the political situation in Russia grew increasingly unstable, the UPR took a decisive step by declaring full independence on January 22, 1918 [128]\n\n\nThe first Bolshevik revkoms\nAs the Bolsheviks sought to expand their influence across the former territories of the Russian Empire, Ukraine became a significant battleground In December 1917, amidst the chaos of the Russian Revolution and the collapse of imperial power, the Ukrainian People's Republic of Soviets was proclaimed This was a direct challenge to the Ukrainian People's Republic, which had declared its independence from the Russian Empire earlier that year The UPR, led by nationalists and democrats, sought to build an independent Ukrainian state In contrast, the Bolshevik-backed People's Republic of Soviets aimed to bring Ukraine under Soviet control and align it with the goals of the Russian Bolsheviks [130]\n\n\nUkrainian State\nAmid growing unrest, a coup d'√©tat led by General Pavlo Skoropadskyi on April 29, 1918, dismantled the UPR and established the Ukrainian State, also known as the Hetmanate Skoropadskyi, a former officer in the Russian Imperial Army, assumed the title of Hetman of all Ukraine, aiming to create a strong, centralized state with close ties to the German Empire and Austria-Hungary His vision for the Hetmanate included restoring order, promoting economic development, and implementing agrarian reforms to stabilize the economy and society [133]\n\n\nWest Ukrainian People's Republic\nSimultaneously, a separate Ukrainian state was established in the western part of the country The West Ukrainian People's Republic (WUPR) was proclaimed on October 19, 1918, following the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire This new state centered around Eastern Galicia, including the key city of Lviv, and extended into parts of Bukovina and Transcarpathia, areas with substantial Ukrainian populations The WUPR government, led by Yevhen Petrushevych, aspired to build an independent Ukrainian state in Western Ukraine, distinct from both Polish and Russian influences [136] [137]\n\n\nUnification Act\nIn an effort to consolidate their positions during a tumultuous period, UPR and WUPR formally united on January 22, 1919, through the signing of the Unification Act (Act Zluky) This historic declaration symbolized the unification of the two republics into a single Ukrainian state Despite its significance as a milestone for Ukrainian national aspirations, the unification remained largely symbolic in practice The lack of effective integration between the UPR and WUPR resulted in minimal military coordination or mutual support Both entities were preoccupied with their respective military challenges: the UPR was engaged in a desperate struggle against advancing Bolshevik forces, while the WUPR was embroiled in a conflict with Polish troops over territorial claims in Eastern Galicia [140]\n\n\nOthers states and anti-Bolshevik movements\nThe Makhnovshchina, which existed from 1918 to 1921, was a revolutionary anarchist movement in southern Ukraine led by Nestor Makhno It emerged during the chaos of the Russian Civil War The Makhnovists aimed to establish a stateless, self-managed society based on anarchist principles, where peasants and workers controlled the land and factories Makhno's forces fought against various powers, including the Bolsheviks, the White Army, and foreign invaders Despite initial successes, the movement was eventually crushed by the Bolsheviks [141]\n\n\nContinued struggle and exile of the UPR government\nAfter being driven out of Kyiv by Bolshevik forces in early 1919, the UPR government, led by Symon Petliura, continued to resist Bolshevik advances and Polish encroachment By 1920, facing insurmountable odds and a deteriorating military position, Petliura sought an alliance with Poland In April 1920, the Treaty of Warsaw was signed, under which the UPR agreed to recognize Polish control over Western Ukraine in exchange for Polish military support against the Bolsheviks [148]\n\n\nFormation of the Ukrainian SSR\nAs both the UPR and WUPR faced defeat, the Bolshevik forces consolidated their control over Ukraine On December 30, 1919, the Bolsheviks proclaimed the establishment of the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic (Ukrainian SSR), positioning it as a satellite of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) The new Soviet government aimed to establish complete Soviet authority over all Ukrainian territories, incorporating Ukraine into the broader framework of Soviet expansion [10]\n\n\nUkraine in Soviet Union (1922‚Äì1991)\nIn the 1920s, the Soviet government implemented a policy of \"Ukrainization\" as part of its broader strategy to strengthen support for the Soviet regime in non-Russian republics This policy encouraged the use of the Ukrainian language in education, government, and media Ukrainian culture and history were promoted to win over the local population and intellectual elite Ukrainization allowed a degree of cultural revival after years of Russian dominance in Ukraine Ukrainian literature, theater, and arts experienced significant growth, and schools began teaching in the Ukrainian language However, this policy was carefully controlled by the Communist Party, ensuring that cultural development aligned with Soviet ideology [154]\n\n\nUkrainization and New Economic Policy\nIn the 1920s, the Soviet government implemented a policy of \"Ukrainization\" as part of its broader strategy to strengthen support for the Soviet regime in non-Russian republics This policy encouraged the use of the Ukrainian language in education, government, and media Ukrainian culture and history were promoted to win over the local population and intellectual elite Ukrainization allowed a degree of cultural revival after years of Russian dominance in Ukraine Ukrainian literature, theater, and arts experienced significant growth, and schools began teaching in the Ukrainian language However, this policy was carefully controlled by the Communist Party, ensuring that cultural development aligned with Soviet ideology [154]\n\n\nForced collectivization, industrialization and Holodomor\nIn 1929, Joseph Stalin launched a campaign of forced collectivization across the Soviet Union, including Ukraine The policy aimed to consolidate individual peasant farms into large, state-controlled collective farms (kolkhozes) to increase agricultural productivity and secure grain supplies for rapid industrialization Ukrainian peasants, particularly wealthier ones known as \"kulaks\", resisted collectivization The Soviet regime responded with brutal force, seizing land, livestock, and grain, and deporting or executing those who resisted Collectivization led to widespread chaos in rural areas Agricultural output plummeted due to poor planning, lack of incentives, and resistance from the peasantry The disruption of traditional farming practices and the state's requisition of grain exacerbated food shortages [157]\n\n\nPolitical repression and the Great Purge\nThroughout the 1930s, Stalin's regime became increasingly marked by paranoia and a relentless drive to eradicate any perceived threats to his authority This climate of suspicion fueled widespread political repression across the Soviet Union, profoundly impacting every layer of society in Ukraine The purges specifically targeted Ukrainian intellectuals, artists, political leaders, and ordinary citizens suspected of harboring nationalist sympathies or potential dissenting views Stalin‚Äôs objective was clear: to eliminate any possible source of opposition to Soviet rule, no matter how tenuous or imagined [161]\n\n\nWorld War II\nThe Second World War began on 1 September 1939, when Hitler invaded the Western part of Poland Sixteen days later, the Soviet Union took most of Eastern Poland Nazi Germany with its allies invaded the Soviet Union in 1941 Between 4.5 and 6 million Ukrainians fought in the Soviet Army against the Nazis [167] Some Ukrainians initially regarded the Wehrmacht soldiers as liberators from Soviet rule, while others formed a partisan movement Some elements of the Ukrainian nationalist underground formed a Ukrainian Insurgent Army that fought both Soviet forces and the Nazis Others collaborated with the Germans The pro-Polish trend in the Ukrainian national movement, declaring loyalty to the Second Polish Republic and in return demanding autonomy for Ukrainians (e.g Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance), became marginalized, mainly due to its rejection by the Polish side, where supporters of forced assimilation of Ukrainians into Polish culture dominated [168] Some 1.5 million Jews were murdered by the Nazis during their occupation [169] In Volhynia, Ukrainian fighters committed a massacre against up to 100,000 Polish civilians [170] Residual small groups of the UPA-partizans acted near the Polish and Soviet border as long as to the 1950s [171] Galicia, Volhynia, South Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina, and Carpathian Ruthenia that were annexed as a result of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact in 1939 were added to the Ukrainian SSR.\n\n\nPost-war Ukrainian SSR\nIn the aftermath of the war, amendments to the Constitution of the Ukrainian SSR allowed it to act as a distinct entity in international law while remaining an integral part of the Soviet Union These changes enabled Ukraine to become one of the founding members of the United Nations (UN) in 1945, alongside the Soviet Union and the Byelorussian SSR This arrangement was part of a geopolitical compromise with the United States, designed to balance representation in the UN General Assembly, which was perceived by the Soviet Union as skewed in favor of the Western bloc Within the UN framework, the Ukrainian SSR actively participated in global diplomacy, even serving as an elected member of the United Nations Security Council in 1948‚Äì1949 and again in 1984‚Äì1985 [citation needed]\n\n\nThe Path to Independence\nBy 1990, calls for Ukrainian sovereignty reached a fever pitch, fueled by decades of cultural suppression, economic exploitation, and a growing national consciousness among Ukrainians On 21 January 1990, one of the most iconic demonstrations of unity and determination occurred when over 300,000 Ukrainians formed the \"human chain\" stretching from Kyiv to Lviv This symbolic act, known as the \"Chain of Unity\", marked the anniversary of the Unification Act of the Ukrainian People's Republic and the West Ukrainian People's Republic in 1919 It highlighted the nation's steadfast commitment to reclaiming its independence, emphasizing the unity between eastern and western Ukraine [179]\n\n\nContemporary history\nOn August 24, 1991, following the failed August Coup in Moscow, the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian Parliament) declared Ukraine‚Äôs independence from the Soviet Union [182] This historic decision was reinforced by a nationwide referendum on December 1, 1991, where over 90% of voters supported independence, with majorities in every region (including 56% in Crimea) [184] That same day, Ukraine held its first presidential election, a pivotal moment in its post-Soviet history Leonid Kravchuk, a former high-ranking Soviet official, won the election, becoming first President of Ukraine During his tenure, Kravchuk worked to maintain stability, distance Ukraine from Moscow‚Äôs influence, and manage internal political challenges [185]\n\n\nIndependent Ukraine (1991‚Äìpresent)\nOn August 24, 1991, following the failed August Coup in Moscow, the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian Parliament) declared Ukraine‚Äôs independence from the Soviet Union [182] This historic decision was reinforced by a nationwide referendum on December 1, 1991, where over 90% of voters supported independence, with majorities in every region (including 56% in Crimea) [184] That same day, Ukraine held its first presidential election, a pivotal moment in its post-Soviet history Leonid Kravchuk, a former high-ranking Soviet official, won the election, becoming first President of Ukraine During his tenure, Kravchuk worked to maintain stability, distance Ukraine from Moscow‚Äôs influence, and manage internal political challenges [185]\n\n\nPost-Soviet transition: building the foundations of independence\nOn August 24, 1991, following the failed August Coup in Moscow, the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian Parliament) declared Ukraine‚Äôs independence from the Soviet Union [182] This historic decision was reinforced by a nationwide referendum on December 1, 1991, where over 90% of voters supported independence, with majorities in every region (including 56% in Crimea) [184] That same day, Ukraine held its first presidential election, a pivotal moment in its post-Soviet history Leonid Kravchuk, a former high-ranking Soviet official, won the election, becoming first President of Ukraine During his tenure, Kravchuk worked to maintain stability, distance Ukraine from Moscow‚Äôs influence, and manage internal political challenges [185]\n\n\nStrengthening and growing contradictions\nThe third presidential election in Ukraine took place in 1999, resulting in a victory for Leonid Kuchma, who defeated Petro Symonenko in the run-off This secured Kuchma a second consecutive term However, his second term was plagued by widespread controversies, including allegations of authoritarianism, pervasive corruption scandals, curtailment of media freedoms, and large-scale public protests that challenged his leadership and legitimacy [200]\n\n\nOrange Revolution and Euromaidan\nIn 2004, Kuchma announced that he would not run for re-election Two major candidates emerged in the 2004 presidential election Viktor Yanukovych, [211] the incumbent Prime Minister, supported by both Kuchma and by the Russian Federation, wanted closer ties with Russia The main opposition candidate, Viktor Yushchenko, called for Ukraine to turn its attention westward and aim to eventually join the EU.\n\n\nWestern Integration\nOn 1 January 2016, Ukraine joined the DCFTA with the EU Ukrainian citizens were granted visa-free travel to the Schengen Area for up to 90 days during any 180-day period on 11 June 2017, and the Association Agreement formally came into effect on 1 September 2017 [227] Significant achievements in the foreign policy arena include support for anti-Russian sanctions, obtaining a visa-free regime with the countries of the European Union, and better recognition of the need to overcome extremely difficult tasks within the country However, the old local authorities did not want any changes; they were cleansed of anti-Maidan activists (lustration), but only in part The fight against corruption was launched, but was limited to sentences of petty officials and electronic declarations, and the newly established NABU and NACP were marked by scandals in their work Judicial reform was combined with the appointment of old, compromised judges The investigation of crimes against Maidan residents was delayed In order to counteract the massive global Russian anti-Ukrainian propaganda of the \"information war\", the Ministry of Information Policy was created, which for 5 years did not show effective work, except for the ban on Kaspersky Lab, Dr.Web, 1–°, Mail.ru, Yandex and Russian social networks VKontakte or Odnoklassniki and propaganda media In 2017, the president signed the law \"On Education\", which met with opposition from national minorities, and quarreled with the Government of Hungary [citation needed] [228]\n\n\nRusso-Ukrainian War\nIn March 2014, the Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation occurred Although official results of a referendum on Crimean reunification with Russia were reported as showing a large majority in favor of the proposition, the vote was organized under Russian military occupation and was denounced by the European Union and the United States as illegal [241]\n\n\nNational historiography\nKnowledge about Ukraine in other parts of the world came chiefly from Russian secondary sources until relatively recently After the second half of the seventeenth century, when Muscovy and later the Russian Empire came to control much of Ukrainian territory, Russian writers included Ukraine as part of Russian history This included referring to medieval Kievan Rus' as \"Kievan Russia\" and its Old East Slavic culture and inhabitants as \"Kievan Russian\" or \"Old Russian\" Later Ukraine or its parts were called \"Little Russia\", \"South Russia\", \"West Russia\" (with Belarus), or \"New Russia\" (the Black Sea coast and southeastern steppe) But parts of Ukraine beyond Russia's reach were called Ruthenia and its people Ruthenians The names chosen to refer to Ukraine and Ukrainians have often reflected a certain political position, and sometimes even to deny the existence of Ukrainian nationality [30]:‚Ää10‚Äì11‚Ää The Russian point-of-view of Ukrainian history became the prevailing one in Western academia, and although the bias was identified as early as the 1950s, many scholars of Slavic studies and history believe significant changes are still necessary to correct the Moscow-centric view [274]\n\n\nCanadian historiography on Ukraine\nIn Soviet Ukraine, twentieth-century historians were strictly limited in the range of models and topics they could cover, with Moscow insisting on an official Marxist approach However, √©migr√© Ukrainians in Canada developed an independent scholarship that ignored Marxism, and shared the Western tendencies in historiography [282] George W Simpson and Orest Subtelny were leaders promoting Ukrainian studies in Canadian academe [283] The lack of independence in Ukraine meant that traditional historiographical emphases on diplomacy and politics were handicapped The flourishing of social history after 1960 opened many new approaches for researchers in Canada; Subtelny used the modernization model Later historiographical trends were quickly adapted to the Ukrainian evidence, with special focus on Ukrainian nationalism The new cultural history, post-colonial studies, and the \"linguistic turn\" augmenting, if not replacing social history, allowed for multiple angles of approach By 1991, historians in Canada had freely explored a wide range of approaches regarding the emergence of a national identity After independence, a high priority in Canada was assisting in the freeing of Ukrainian scholarship from Soviet-Marxist orthodoxy‚Äîwhich downplayed Ukrainian nationalism and insisted that true Ukrainians were always trying to reunite with Russia Independence from Moscow meant freedom from an orthodoxy that was never well suited to Ukrainian developments Scholars in Ukraine welcomed the \"national paradigm\" that Canadian historians had helped develop Since 1991, the study of Ukrainian nation-building became an increasingly global and collaborative enterprise, with scholars from Ukraine studying and working in Canada, and with conferences on related topics attracting scholars from around the world [284]\n\n\nSee also\n Media related to History of Ukraine at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\nNotes\n Media related to History of

Hamilton era (1907‚Äì1956)\nIn 1907, Kansas hired one of Naismith's players, Dr Forrest C \"Phog\" Allen as head coach Naismith provided Allen with a now infamous piece of wisdom: \"You can't coach basketball; you just play it.\" [15] Allen would set out to prove the adage wrong and through success and an unrivaled coaching tree has become known as the \"Father of Basketball Coaching\", having passed on his knowledge of the game to some of the most well-respected names in the history of college basketball, including National Basketball Hall of Fame coaches Adolph Rupp, Dean Smith, Dutch Lonborg and Ralph Miller (all except Lonborg were born and raised in Kansas) Allen coached the team from 1907 to 1909, but William O Hamilton coached from 1909 to 1919, with Allen taking over again in 1919 The team went 125‚Äì59 and won five conference championships under Hamilton's direction.\n\n\nDick Harp era (1956‚Äì1964)\nFollowing Allen's retirement, the Jayhawks hired former KU player and assistant, Dick Harp Under Harp the Jayhawks went 121‚Äì82 with two conference titles and two NCAA tournament berths.\n\n\nTed Owens era (1964‚Äì1983)\nTed Owens took over for Harp in 1964, and would go 348‚Äì128 during his tenure, eventually winning six Big Eight Conference titles.\n\n\nLarry Brown era (1983‚Äì1988)\nIn 1983, Larry Brown headed to the University of Kansas, after coaching in the NBA Under Brown, Kansas finished first in the Big Eight in 1986, and second in 1984, 1985, and 1987 In 1988, Kansas got off to a 12‚Äì8 start, including 1‚Äì4 in the Big 8  The Jayhawks' 55-game homecourt winning streak in Allen Fieldhouse was snapped with a loss to rival Kansas State, and they would also lose two more home games to Duke and Oklahoma Behind the high-scoring of Danny Manning, KU finished 21‚Äì11 at the end of the season and entered the NCAA tournament as a #6 seed Two early upsets allowed them to face lower seeds, gain momentum, and advance  The Jayhawks would ultimately go on to face the three teams who had given them their three home losses that season  They defeated rival Kansas State in the Elite 8, then defeated Duke in the Final 4, and won the national championship, defeating favored conference rival Oklahoma 83‚Äì79 in the final The 11 losses Kansas accrued in 1988 are more than any other national champion have before or since The win garnered the team the nickname \"Danny and the Miracles\" Earlier, near the start of the tournament, Dick Vitale had been asked about Kansas's chances and commented \"If Kansas wins, I'll kiss the Jayhawk on the floor of Allen Fieldhouse.\" Eventually, he did make good on his promise.\n\n\nRoy Williams era (1988‚Äì2003)\nShortly following Brown's departure, Kansas hired then North Carolina assistant Roy Williams as head coach.\n\n\nBill Self era (2003‚Äìpresent)\nBill Self was introduced as the new head coach for the 2003‚Äì04 season and in his first season at Kansas, Self inherited Williams' players and recruits, which often caused turmoil as the style of play differed between the two coaches Nevertheless, Self led his new Kansas team to the Elite Eight at the NCAA tournament his first year.\n\n\nConference affiliations\nKansas has been affiliated with the following conferences:\n\n\nRank in notable areas\nRanks and records listed in table do not include wins, championships, and

Four of their coaches have been inducted to the Hall of Fame as a coach The longest tenured coach was Phog Allen at 39 seasons, while the shortest tenured coach was Larry Brown, who coached for 5 seasons Bill Self, the current head coach, is the winningest coach in team history with 591 Allen is the next closest to Self with 590 wins Ted Owens is the only coach in program history to have been fired Allen and Harp are the only Jayhawk coaches to have also played at the school Self had his first coaching job as an assistant under Brown at Kansas.\n\n\nCoaches\nBelow is a list of former Jayhawk basketball on NBA rosters Free agents should not be included on the list Players with an asterisk are players that have been assigned to the G-League In the offseason, players who were signed to a team's summer league roster should not be included.\n\n\nFacilities\nSince first fielding a program, the Jayhawks have had three official home arenas Kansas also occasionally will play regular season games at the T-Mobile Center in Kansas City.\n\n\nEarly venues (1898‚Äì1907)\nBefore 1907 the Jayhawks played in various venues, ranging from the basement of the original Snow Hall (even though the ceiling was only 14 feet high) to the skating rink at the local YMCA Although a current campus building bears the same name, the original Snow Hall was demolished in 1934 [48]\n\n\nRobinson Gymnasium (1907‚Äì1927)\nRobinson Gym was the first athletic building on the KU campus and featured a 2,500-seat auditorium used for basketball purposes The building was demolished in 1967 [49]\n\n\nHoch Auditorium (1927‚Äì1955)\nHoch Auditorium was a 3,500 seat multi-purpose arena in Lawrence, Kansas It opened in 1927 It was home to the University of Kansas Jayhawks basketball teams until Allen Fieldhouse opened in 1955.\n\n\nAllen Fieldhouse (1955‚Äìpresent)\nAllen Fieldhouse was dedicated on March 1, 1955, when the Jayhawks defeated in-state rival, Kansas State 77‚Äì67.\n\n\nHome game traditions\nBefore the start of every Jayhawks home game, after the singing of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", it is a tradition to sing the alma mater, \"Crimson and the Blue\" While singing the alma mater, it is tradition for the students in attendance to put an arm over the shoulders of their neighbors and slowly sway side to side, lifting their arms over their heads as the last line of the song is sung The song is concluded by the Rock Chalk Chant.\n\n\nYear-by-year Results\nThe Jayhawks longest played rivalry is with cross-state rival Kansas State The Jayhawks lead

the college basketball team of the University of Kansas and competes in the Big 12 Conference of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).\n\nHistory\nKansas ranks second all-time in NCAA Division I wins with 2,357 wins (as of the last complete season), against 877 losses (.729 all-time winning percentage, third all-time). This record includes a 765‚Äì110 (.874) mark at historic Allen Fieldhouse. The Jayhawks are first in NCAA history with 98 winning seasons, and tied for first in NCAA history with 101 non-losing (.500 or better) seasons with Kentucky. Kansas is tied for the fewest head coaches (8) of any program that has played since the 19th century, yet has reached the Final Four under more head coaches (6) than any other program in the nation. Every head coach at Kansas since the inception of the NCAA Tournament has led the program to the Final Four. Kansas has had four head coaches inducted into the Naismith Hall of Fame, more than any other program in the nation. A perennial conference powerhouse, Kansas leads Division I all-time in regular season conference titles with 62 in 113 years of conference play (the MVIAA Conference was created in 1907) through the 2019‚Äì20 regular season. The Jayhawks have won a record 20 conference titles and a record 11 conference tournament titles in the 24 years of the Big 12's existence. The program also owns the best Big 12 records in both those areas with a 412‚Äì102 record in conference play and a 46‚Äì12 record in tournament play. The Jayhawks won their 2,000th game in school history when they defeated Texas Tech in the 2009‚Äì2010 season, joining the University of Kentucky and the University of North Carolina as the only schools to boast such an achievement at that time.\n\nJames Naismith era (1898‚Äì1907)\nThe men's basketball program officially began in 1898, following the arrival of Dr James Naismith to the school, just six years after Naismith had written the sport's first official rules. Naismith was initially hired to be a chapel director and physical education instructor, but became the head basketball coach.\n\nPhog Allen/William O. Hamilton era (1907‚Äì1956)\nIn 1907, Kansas hired one of Naismith's players, Dr Forrest C \"Phog\" Allen as head coach. Naismith provided Allen with a now infamous piece of wisdom: \"You can't coach basketball; you just play it.\" Allen would set out to prove the adage wrong and through success and an unrivaled coaching tree has become known as the \"Father of Basketball Coaching\", having passed on his knowledge of the game to some of the most well-respected names in the history of college basketball, including National Basketball Hall of Fame coaches Adolph Rupp, Dean Smith, Dutch Lonborg and Ralph Miller (all except Lonborg were born and raised in Kansas). Allen coached the team from 1907 to 1909, but William O Hamilton coached from 1909 to 1919, with Allen taking over again in 1919. The team went 125‚Äì59 and won five conference championships under Hamilton's direction.\n\nDick Harp era (1956‚Äì1964)\nFollowing Allen's retirement, the Jayhawks hired former KU player and assistant, Dick Harp. Under Harp the Jayhawks went 121‚Äì82 with two conference titles and two NCAA tournament berths.\n\nTed Owens era (1964‚Äì1983)\nTed Owens took over for Harp in 1964, and would go 348‚Äì128 during his tenure, eventually winning six Big Eight Conference titles.\n\nLarry Brown era (1983‚Äì1988)\nIn 1983, Larry Brown headed to the University of Kansas, after coaching in the NBA. Under Brown, Kansas finished first in the Big Eight in 1986, and second in 1984, 1985, and 1987. In 1988, Kansas got off to a 12‚Äì8 start, including 1‚Äì4 in the Big 8. The Jayhawks' 55-game homecourt winning streak in Allen Fieldhouse was snapped with a loss to rival Kansas State, and they would also lose two more home games to Duke and Oklahoma. Behind the high-scoring of Danny Manning, KU finished 21‚Äì11 at the end of the season and entered the NCAA tournament as a #6 seed. Two early upsets allowed them to face lower seeds, gain momentum, and advance. The Jayhawks would ultimately go on to face the three teams who had given them their three home losses that season. They defeated rival Kansas State in the Elite 8, then defeated Duke in the Final 4, and won the national championship, defeating favored conference rival Oklahoma 83‚Äì79 in the final. The 11 losses Kansas accrued in 1988 are more than any other national champion have before or since. The win garnered the team the nickname \"Danny and the Miracles.\" Earlier, near the start of the tournament, Dick Vitale had been asked about Kansas's chances and commented \"If Kansas wins, I'll kiss the Jayhawk on the floor of Allen Fieldhouse.\" Eventually, he did make good on his promise.\n\nRoy Williams era (1988‚Äì2003)\nRoy Williams left Kansas to become the head coach at North Carolina.\n\nBill Self era (2003‚Äìpresent)\nBill Self was introduced as the new head coach for the 2003‚Äì04 season and in his first season at Kansas, Self inherited Williams' players and recruits, which often caused turmoil as the style of play differed between the two coaches. Nevertheless, Self led his new Kansas team to the Elite Eight at the NCAA tournament his first year.\n\nConference affiliations\nKansas has been affiliated with the following conferences:\n\nRegular season conference championships\nThe Jayhawks have won 62 conference championships since their inception, including an NCAA record 13 consecutive from 2005 through 2017. The Jayhawks have belonged to the Big 12 Conference since it formed before the 1996‚Äì97 season. Before that, the Jayhawks have belonged to the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association from the 1907‚Äì08 to 1927‚Äì28 seasons, the Big Six Conference from 1928‚Äì29 to 1946‚Äì47, the Big Seven Conference from 1947‚Äì48 to 1957‚Äì58, the Big Eight Conference from 1958 to 1959 up until the end of the 1995‚Äì96 season. The Big Six and Big Seven conferences were actually the more often used names of the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association, which existed under that official name until 1964, when it was changed to the Big Eight.\n\nConference tournament championships\nThe Big Eight Conference did not regularly have a post-season tournament until after the 1977 season. Prior to that teams usually played in the Big Eight (before that, Big Seven) Holiday Tournament in December.

The Jayhawks were coached by Larry Brown and finished the season 27‚Äì11, which is the lowest winning percentage (.710) and most losses of any team to win the national championship. The team remains the only championship team of the Jayhawks that did not win the regular season conference championship or the conference tournament championship.\n\n2008\nThe 2007‚Äì08 team won the Jayhawks third NCAA Tournament Championship. They were coached by Bill Self and finished the season with a 37‚Äì3 record, which is a school record for wins in a season.\n\n2022\nThe 2021‚Äì22 team won the Jayhawks fourth NCAA Tournament Championship, which is their most recent championship.

Hamilton era (1907‚Äì1956)\nIn 1907, Kansas hired one of Naismith's players, Dr Forrest C \"Phog\" Allen as head coach Naismith provided Allen with a now infamous piece of wisdom: \"You can't coach basketball; you just play it.\" [15] Allen would set out to prove the adage wrong and through success and an unrivaled coaching tree has become known as the \"Father of Basketball Coaching\", having passed on his knowledge of the game to some of the most well-respected names in the history of college basketball, including National Basketball Hall of Fame coaches Adolph Rupp, Dean Smith, Dutch

Born to a family of writers, Pajitnov developed an early interest in arts and mathematics, which would later influence his work in game development.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nPajitnov was born to Russian parents, both of whom were writers. His father was an art critic, while his mother was a journalist who wrote for both newspapers and a film magazine. It was through his parents that Pajitnov gained exposure to the arts, eventually developing a passion for cinema. He accompanied his mother to many film screenings, including the Moscow Film Festival, which had a significant impact on his life and career.\n\nPajitnov was also mathematically inclined, enjoying puzzles and problem-solving. He spent a significant amount of time solving mathematical problems and playing with puzzles, which would later become an essential part of his game development process.\n\n**Career**\n\nIn 1977, Pajitnov worked as a summer intern at the Soviet Academy of Sciences. After graduating in 1979, he accepted a job at the same institution, working on speech recognition at the academy's Dorodnitsyn Computing Centre. When the Computing Centre received new equipment, its researchers would write a small program for it in order to test its computing capabilities. According to Pajitnov, this \"became [his] excuse for making games.\"\n\nComputer games were fascinating to him because they offered a way to bridge the gap between logic and emotion, and Pajitnov held interests in both mathematics and puzzles, as well as the psychology of computing. He spent a significant amount of time playing and experimenting with different types of games, which eventually led to the creation of Tetris.\n\n**Tetris**\n\nTetris is a puzzle game that was first released in 1984. The game was created by Pajitnov, and it quickly became a massive hit. Players are presented with a grid, into which they must fit different-shaped blocks, known as Tetriminos. The goal of the game is to create a solid line without any gaps, which will then be removed from the grid.\n\nTetris was initially released in the Soviet Union, but it quickly spread to other parts of the world. The game has since become one of the most popular and enduring puzzle games of all time, with hundreds of millions of players worldwide.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nPajitnov moved to the United States in 1991, where he was naturalized as a U.S. citizen. He currently lives in Clyde Hill, Washington, with his wife, Nina, and their two sons, Peter and Dmitri.\n\n**Political Views**\n\nIn 2022, Pajitnov issued a statement condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine. He stated that he was \"sure that Putin and his hateful regime will fall down and the normal peaceful way of living will be restored in Ukraine and, hopefully, in Russia.\"\n\n**Games**\n\nIn 1996, GameSpot named Pajitnov as the fourth most influential computer game developer of all time. In March 2007, he received the Game Developers Choice Awards First Penguin Award, which was given for pioneering the casual games market.\n\n**Awards and Recognition**\n\nIn addition to his work on Tetris, Pajitnov has received numerous awards and recognition for his contributions to the game development industry. These include:\n\n* 1996: GameSpot named him as the fourth most influential computer game developer of all time\n* 2007: Game Developers Choice Awards First Penguin Award for pioneering the casual games market\n\n**Legacy**\n\nPajitnov's legacy extends far beyond his work on Tetris. He has inspired a generation of game developers and has played a significant role in shaping the game development industry. His commitment to creating engaging and challenging games has had a lasting impact on the world of gaming.\n\nIn conclusion, Alexey Pajitnov is a highly influential and accomplished game developer, best known for creating the popular puzzle game Tetris. His contributions to the game development industry have been widely recognized, and his legacy continues to inspire game developers around the world.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Alexey_Pajitnov\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nPajitnov was born to Russian parents, who were both writers, his father was an art critic, his mother was a journalist who wrote for both newspapers and a film magazine It was through his parents that Pajitnov gained exposure to the arts, eventually developing a passion for cinema He accompanied his mother to many film screenings, including the Moscow Film Festival [5]:‚Ää296‚Ää [6]:‚Ää75‚Ää Pajitnov was also mathematically inclined, enjoying puzzles and problem solving.\n\n\nCareer\nIn 1977, Pajitnov worked as a summer intern at the Soviet Academy of Sciences Once he graduated in 1979, he accepted a job there working on speech recognition at the academy's Dorodnitsyn Computing Centre [10]:‚Ää86‚Ää When the Computing Centre received new equipment, its researchers would write a small program for it in order to test its computing capabilities According to Pajitnov, this \"became  [his] excuse for making games\" [11] Computer games were fascinating to him because they offered a way to bridge the gap between logic and emotion, and Pajitnov held interests in both mathematics and puzzles, as well as the psychology of computing [6]:‚Ää76‚Ää\n\n\nPersonal life\nPajitnov moved to the United States in 1991, was naturalized as a U.S citizen and now lives in Clyde Hill, Washington [2] [32] He has a wife, Nina, with whom he had two sons named Peter and Dmitri [7] [33]\n\n\nPolitical views\nAfter the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Pajitnov issued a statement condemning the war and stating that he was \"sure that Putin and his hateful regime will fall down and the normal peaceful way of living will be restored in Ukraine and, hopefully, in Russia\" [34]\n\n\nGames\nIn 1996, GameSpot named him as the fourth most influential computer game developer of all time [36] In March 2007, he received the Game Developers Choice Awards First Penguin Award The award was given for pioneering the casual games market [37]\n\n\nAwards and recognition\nIn 1996, GameSpot named him as the fourth most influential computer game developer of all time [36] In March 2007, he received the Game Developers Choice Awards First Penguin Award The award was given for pioneering the casual games market [37]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

in 1992 By 2005, over 120 countries had participated as regular host sites and the tests had been taken around 100 million times (domestic ethnic minority candidates included) [3] In 2011, Beijing International Chinese College became the first HSK testing center to conduct the HSK test online.\n\n\nStructure\nIn 2020, an internal Chinese academic paper discussed that the Chinese Proficiency Standards would undergo a change: a hybrid paradigm of \"Three Stages and Nine Levels\" characterized by all-in-one integration The Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China announced further details regarding HSK 3.0 on April 1, 2021 Among the information shared was a wordlist for each individual stage, and a date for the introduction of the new test‚ÄîJuly 1, 2021 [5] As of April 2022 no HSK 3.0 tests have been rolled out and only a single preparation book for the basic levels has been published, [6] additionally the HSK 2.0 test format is still in use An update on the official HSK website suggests, that the April 2021 date only signified the start date for the conception of the new HSK 3.0 [7] New practice materials for the intermediate and advanced levels are expected to be released in the third or fourth quarter of 2022 [6] One of the main problems with the current HSK test is that it does not follow the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) For example, HSK 6 was nowhere close to Near Native C2 in English, and so on.\n\n\nFrom 2021\nIn 2020, an internal Chinese academic paper discussed that the Chinese Proficiency

Languages (CEFR) For example, HSK 6 was nowhere close to Near Native C2 in English, and so on.\n\n\nBetween 2010‚Äì2021\nThe previous format was introduced in 2010, with a philosophy of testing \"comprehensive language and communication ability\" [1] Most notable are the inclusion of written segments at all levels (not just in the Advanced levels as in the pre-2010 test), a reform of the ranking system, and the use of new question structures Complete vocabulary lists, previous tests, and simulated tests are available as preparation materials A minor update of the vocabulary lists was made in 2012.\n\n\nWritten test\nThe Listening, Reading and Writing tests each have a maximum score of 100 HSK 1 and 2 therefore have a maximum score of 200 with 120 points required to pass [18] [19] HSK 3 and 4 have a maximum of 300 points with 180 points required to pass [20] [21] There is no minimum number of points required for each of the sections as long as the sum is over 120 or 180 points respectively.\n\n\nOnline test\nThe written version is now available in two forms, a computer and a paper based test Both tests are still held at test centers, the differences between the two are as follows: [28]\n\n\nOral test\nThe HSKK test is a separate test However, the three HSKK levels correspond with the six HSK levels of the written test.\n\n\nComparison with CEFR levels\nIn 2010, Hanban asserted that the HSK's six levels corresponded to the six levels of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) [15] [29] However, the German [30]:‚Ää1,‚Ää3,‚Ää5‚Ää and French [31] associations of Chinese language teachers reject this equivalency, arguing that HSK Level 6 is only equivalent to CEFR Level B2 or C1.\n\n\nBefore 2010\nAdvanced\n\n\nRanking\nFormerly, there

non-native speakers. The test is designed to evaluate the ability of test-takers to understand, use, and communicate in Chinese language.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe HSK test was first introduced in 1984 as a national standardized test in China. Over the years, the test has undergone several revisions, with the most recent update being the introduction of the \"Three Stages and Nine Levels\" paradigm in 2020. The test is administered by the Chinese government and is recognized as a valid measure of Chinese language proficiency by universities and employers worldwide.\n\n**Development of the HSK Test**\n\nThe development of the HSK test began in 1984 at Beijing Language and Culture University. The first version of the test was released in 1985, and it was initially used to assess the Chinese language proficiency of international students in China. Over the years, the test has undergone several revisions, with the most notable being the introduction of the new format in 2010. The new format includes written segments at all levels, a reform of the ranking system, and the use of new question structures.\n\n**Structure**\n\nThe HSK test consists of three parts: Listening, Reading, and Writing. The Listening test evaluates the test-taker's ability to understand spoken Chinese, while the Reading test evaluates their ability to read Chinese texts. The Writing test evaluates their ability to write Chinese characters and express themselves in writing. The test is divided into six levels, with each level representing a different level of Chinese language proficiency.\n\n**From 2021**\n\nIn 2020, an internal Chinese academic paper discussed the proposal to change the HSK test format to a \"Three Stages and Nine Levels\" paradigm. The proposal was announced by the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China on April 1, 2021. The new format is expected to be rolled out in 2022, with new practice materials for the intermediate and advanced levels to be released in the third or fourth quarter of 2022.\n\n**Between 2010-2021**\n\nThe previous format of the HSK test was introduced in 2010, with a philosophy of testing \"comprehensive language and communication ability.\" The test included written segments at all levels, a reform of the ranking system, and the use of new question structures. The vocabulary lists were also updated in 2012.\n\n**Written Test**\n\nThe Written test consists of three parts: Reading, Writing, and Listening. The Reading test evaluates the test-taker's ability to read Chinese texts, while the Writing test evaluates their ability to write Chinese characters and express themselves in writing. The Listening test evaluates their ability to understand spoken Chinese. The test is divided into six levels, with each level representing a different level of Chinese language proficiency.\n\n**Online Test**\n\nThe HSK test is now available in two forms: a computer-based test and a paper-based test. Both tests are still held at test centers, with the main difference being the format of the test. The computer-based test is administered through a computer, while the paper-based test is administered through a paper and pencil.\n\n**Oral Test**\n\nThe HSKK test is a separate test that evaluates the test-taker's ability to speak Chinese. The test is divided into three levels, with each level representing a different level of Chinese language proficiency. The HSKK test is designed to evaluate the test-taker's ability to communicate in Chinese language, with a focus on pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary.\n\n**Comparison with CEFR Levels**\n\nThe HSK test is often compared to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) levels. However, the German and French associations of Chinese language teachers reject the equivalency, arguing that HSK Level 6 is only equivalent to CEFR Level B2 or C1.\n\n**Before 2010**\n\nThe previous format of the HSK test was divided into three parts: Basic, Elementary/Intermediate, and Advanced. The test included four sections: listening comprehension, grammar structures, reading comprehension, and written expressions. The test was administered through a paper and pencil, and the results were scored on a scale of 1 to 11.\n\n**Ranking**\n\nThe previous format of the HSK test included a ranking system, with a score of 9 or higher being considered a common business standard. The ranking system was used to determine the level of Chinese language proficiency of the test-taker, with a higher score indicating a higher level of proficiency.\n\n**Content**\n\nThe previous format of the HSK test included four sections: listening comprehension, grammar structures, reading comprehension, and written expressions. The test was designed to evaluate the test-taker's ability to understand and use Chinese language, with a focus on vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation.\n\n**Test Dates and Locations**\n\nThe HSK test is held at designated test centers in China and abroad. The test dates are published annually, and the written tests are more frequently held than spoken tests, generally around once a month, depending on the test center. The test registration is usually open until 30 days prior to the actual test date for the paper-based test or around 10 days prior the actual test date for the computer-based test. The results are generally available around 30 days after completion, but no definite date is given for results.\n\n**See Also**\n\nThe HSK test is a widely recognized measure of Chinese language proficiency, and it is used by universities and employers worldwide.

\"Hanyu_Shuiping_Kaoshi\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nDevelopment of the HSK test began in 1984 at Beijing Language and Culture University, and was officially made a national standardized test in 1992 By 2005, over 120 countries had participated as regular host sites and the tests had been taken around 100 million times (domestic ethnic minority candidates included) [3] In 2011, Beijing International Chinese College became the first HSK testing center to conduct the HSK test online.\n\n\nStructure\nIn 2020, an internal Chinese academic paper discussed that the Chinese Proficiency Standards would undergo a change: a hybrid paradigm of \"Three Stages and Nine Levels\" characterized by all-in-one integration The Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China announced further details regarding HSK 3.0 on April 1, 2021 Among the information shared was a wordlist for each individual stage, and a date for the introduction of the new test‚ÄîJuly 1, 2021 [5] As of April 2022 no HSK 3.0 tests have been rolled out and only a single preparation book for the basic levels has been published, [6] additionally the HSK 2.0 test format is still in use An update on the official HSK website suggests, that the April 2021 date only signified the start date for the conception of the new HSK 3.0 [7] New practice materials for the intermediate and advanced levels are expected to be released in the third or fourth quarter of 2022 [6] One of the main problems with the current HSK test is that it does not follow the Common European Framework of Reference for

made in 2012.\n\n\nWritten test\nThe Listening, Reading and Writing tests each have a maximum score of 100 HSK 1 and 2 therefore have a maximum score of 200 with 120 points required to pass [18] [19] HSK 3 and 4 have a maximum of 300 points with 180 points required to pass [20] [21] There is no minimum number of points required for each of the sections as long as the sum is over 120 or 180 points respectively.\n\n\nOnline test\nThe written version is now available in two forms, a computer and a paper based test Both tests are still held at test centers, the differences between the two are as follows: [28]\n\n\nOral test\nThe HSKK test is a separate test However, the three HSKK levels correspond with the six HSK levels of the written test.\n\n\nComparison with CEFR levels\nIn 2010, Hanban

{"title": "2022_monkeypox_outbreak", "content": "\nBackground\nMpox (/Àà…õmp…íks/, EM-poks; formerly known as monkeypox) [28] is an infectious viral disease that can occur in humans and other animals Symptoms include a rash that forms blisters and then crusts over, fever, and swollen lymph nodes The illness is usually mild, and most infected individuals recover within a few weeks without treatment The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms ranges from three to seventeen days, and symptoms typically last from two to four weeks However, cases may be severe, especially in children, pregnant women, or people with suppressed immune systems [29] [30] [31]\n\n\nEmergency preparedness prior to outbreak\nOn 17 March 2021, the Nuclear Threat Initiative led a tabletop exercise at the Munich Security Conference simulating hypothetical public health responses to the intentional release of a genetically manipulated strain of monkeypox virus [36] [37] On 23 July 2022, the World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus declared the 2022 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern [13] In May 2023, the emergency was declared over [16]\n\n\nEndemic mpox in Africa\nMpox is endemic to West and Central Africa [38] [39]\n\n\nOutbreak characteristics\nPrior to the 2022 outbreak, the United Kingdom had recorded only seven previous cases of mpox, [45] all of which were imported cases from Africa or healthcare workers involved in their treatment The first three such cases were in 2018, [45] followed by a further case in 2019 [46] and three more in 2021 [47] The only major mpox outbreak to be recorded in a Western country prior to 2022 was the 2003 Midwest monkeypox outbreak in the United States, which did not feature community transmission [48] [49]\n\n\nPhylogenetics\nPhylogenomic characterization of the first monkeypox virus outbreak genome sequences, found the \"presumably slow-evolving\" DNA virus has evolved roughly 6‚Äì12-fold more mutations than one would expect and 15 SNP mutations since the beginning of the outbreak [50] [51] Recombination has been reported in the natural transmission of monkeypox virus Using Tandem repeat polymorphism, case FVGITA-01 (ON755039) in Italy, case VIDRL01(ON631963) in Australia, as well as six cases in Slovenia (ON838178, ON631241, ON609725, ON754985, ON754986, ON754987) were recombinant crossovers Based on  linkage disequilibrium (LD) between monkeypox virus variants with minor alleles in at least two MPXV isolates and to detect the possible recombination, two Germany cases (ON959149 and ON637939) and one Spain case (ON720849) already gained their mutations via recombination [52]\nScientists investigated circulating lineages (and potential variants) of the monkeypox virus and are comparing them against the African endemic lineages [53] [54] [unreliable source] [55]\n\n\nLong incubation periods\nMost mpox patients become symptomatic 4‚Äì11 days after infection Very short incubation periods are also possible, with 5% of patients developing symptoms within 3 days This outbreak revealed that incubation periods of up to 4 weeks are possible, with 5% of cases having incubation periods longer than the previously assumed 21 days [56] [57]\n\n\nMild clinical manifestations\nAn analysis of studies by a journalist in August 2022 indicated that \"about 10-to-15% of cases had been hospitalized, mostly for pain and bacterial infections that can occur as a result of mpox lesions\" [58] Studies published a month later, in August indicated hospitalizations of small cohorts of early patients were 8% [59] and 13% [60] A short review suggested supportive care may typically be sufficient and that several antivirals and vaccinia immune globulin intravenous (VIGIV) are available as treatments [61] The outbreak showed there can be (rare) asymptomatic infections [62]\n\n\nFear of zoonotic spread\nIn May 2022, the UK Human Animal Infections and Risk Surveillance (HAIRS) group [63] warned that the virus could reach wildlife and become endemic as a result [64] [65] There was a concern that if the ongoing outbreak is prolonged, it \"could establish new ecological niches in wild animals\" in regions outside of Africa [66]\n\n\nChronology\nIn the beginning of May 2022, a case of mpox in a British resident who had travelled to Lagos and Delta State in Nigeria, [68] in areas where mpox is considered to be an endemic disease, was reported The person developed a rash on 29¬†April while in Nigeria and flew back to the United Kingdom, arriving on 4¬†May, [45] and presented to hospital later the same day Mpox infection was immediately suspected, and the patient was hospitalised at a specialist clinical unit of the Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust [45] and isolated, then tested positive for the virus on 6¬†May [68] Testing of patient swab samples by polymerase chain reaction revealed clade II of monkeypox virus, [1] which is the less deadly of the two known monkeypox virus variants with a case fatality rate of around 1% [68] The genomic sequence of the virus associated with this outbreak was first published on 19 May by Portuguese researchers [69]\n\n\nDeaths outside of Africa\nThe first death outside of endemic Africa was reported in Brazil on 29 July 2022, in a 41-year-old man with underlying comorbidities [100] On the same day Spain reported its first death, a 44-year-old man in Alicante, with the cause of death being encephalitis associated with mpox infection [101] [102] [103] [104] Spain reported its second mpox-related death on 30 July 2022, in a 31-year-old man in C√≥rdoba, who had also suffered from encephalitis according to reports [103] [105] [101] On 1 August 2022, India confirmed its first mpox death, a 22-year-old male who died in Thrissur, Kerala on 30 July [106] On the same day, Peru reported the death of a mpox-affected 45-year-old male, who also had HIV and septic shock [107]\n\n\nTransmission\nA large portion of those infected had not recently travelled to areas of Africa where mpox is endemic, such as Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo as well as central and western Africa It is transmitted by close contact with infected people, with extra caution for those individuals with lesions on their skin or genitals, along with their bedding and clothing The disease can spread via respiratory secretions or by direct contact with rashes, body fluids or by touching objects and fabrics that have been used by someone with mpox The CDC has also stated that individuals should avoid contact and consumption of dead animals such as rats, squirrels, monkeys and apes along with wild game or lotions derived from animals in Africa [109]\n\n\nTransmission patterns\nThe 2022‚Äì2023 outbreak initially had a different pattern of spread compared to prior mpox outbreaks outside Africa [110]  Genetic evidence suggest the outbreak likely started in Nigeria [111] [112] Given the unusually high frequency of human-to-human transmission observed in this event, and the probable community transmission without history of traveling to endemic areas, spread of the virus through close contact is more likely, with transmission during sexual activities being the most common route [113] Most cases have been in men [114] A significant proportion of cases, although not all, are in men who have sex with men (MSM), notably in Canada, Spain, and the UK, [114] with many cases diagnosed in sexual health clinics [110] Cases are mostly in young and middle-aged men [115] This points to transmission due to close contact during sex as being the main route of transmission [114] In May 2022, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) considered the monkeypox virus to be moderately transmissible among humans According to the centre, among MSM who contracted the virus, the most common means of transmission is likely through sexual activity due to intimate contact with infectious skin lesions The ECDC rated likelihood of transmission due to close contact, including sexual contact, as \"high\", but, without close contact, as low [113] In Nature, Anne Rimoin and Raina MacIntyre speculate that the higher percentage of MSM affected is a result of coincidental introduction to the community and then sexual activity constituting \"close contact\" rather than the virus itself becoming sexually transmitted [116] However, in a study published in August 2022, infectious monkeypox virus was able to be isolated from semen samples, [117] and the prolonged shedding of virus in seminal fluids raised the possibility of a genital reservoir for human mpox [117]\n\n\nWastewater surveillance\nA study from the Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, reported multiple traces of monkeypox virus were detected in non-sewered wastewater with sparse sampling collected from both the Bangkok, Thailand with increasing concentrations from June to August 2022 [127]  Monkeypox viral DNA was first detected in wastewater in the second week of June 2022 [127] From the first week of July, the number of viral DNA copies increased Sanger sequencing confirmed the identification of the monkeypox virus and its relation to the 2022‚Äì2023 mpox outbreak [127]\n\n\nInterventions\nIn early July 2022, scientists reported that the window to be able to contain the outbreak is closing or has closed [128] [129] Previous attempts to control the disease had included encouraging individuals to quarantine or inoculation efforts

emergency caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV). The outbreak began in May 2022 and has since spread to multiple countries, with cases reported in every region of the world.\n\n**Background**\n\nMonkeypox is a viral disease that can occur in humans and other animals. The virus is typically found in West and Central Africa, where it is endemic. The disease is characterized by a rash that forms blisters and then crusts over, fever, and swollen lymph nodes. Most infected individuals recover within a few weeks without treatment. However, cases may be severe, especially in children, pregnant women, or people with suppressed immune systems.\n\n**Emergency Preparedness Prior to Outbreak**\n\nIn 2021, the Nuclear Threat Initiative led a tabletop exercise at the Munich Security Conference simulating hypothetical public health responses to the intentional release of a genetically manipulated strain of monkeypox virus. This exercise highlighted the need for preparedness and response planning in the event of a monkeypox outbreak.\n\n**Endemic Mpox in Africa**\n\nMonkeypox is endemic to West and Central Africa, where it is found in a number of countries, including Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Cameroon. The virus is typically found in tropical rainforests and is transmitted to humans through contact with infected animals, such as rodents and primates.\n\n**Outbreak Characteristics**\n\nPrior to the 2022 outbreak, the United Kingdom had recorded only seven previous cases of monkeypox, all of which were imported cases from Africa or healthcare workers involved in their treatment. The only major monkeypox outbreak to be recorded in a Western country prior to 2022 was the 2003 Midwest monkeypox outbreak in the United States, which did not feature community transmission.\n\n**Phylogenetics**\n\nPhylogenomic characterization of the first monkeypox virus outbreak genome sequences revealed that the virus has evolved roughly 6-12-fold more mutations than one would expect and 15 SNP mutations since the beginning of the outbreak. Recombination has been reported in the natural transmission of monkeypox virus.\n\n**Long Incubation Periods**\n\nMost monkeypox patients become symptomatic 4-11 days after infection. However, very short incubation periods are also possible, with 5% of patients developing symptoms within 3 days. This outbreak revealed that incubation periods of up to 4 weeks are possible, with 5% of cases having incubation periods longer than the previously assumed 21 days.\n\n**Mild Clinical Manifestations**\n\nAn analysis of studies suggested that about 10-15% of cases had been hospitalized, mostly for pain and bacterial infections that can occur as a result of monkeypox lesions. Studies published in August indicated hospitalizations of small cohorts of early patients were 8% and 13%. A short review suggested that supportive care may typically be sufficient and that several antivirals and vaccinia immune globulin intravenous (VIGIV) are available as treatments.\n\n**Fear of Zoonotic Spread**\n\nIn May 2022, the UK Human Animal Infections and Risk Surveillance (HAIRS) group warned that the virus could reach wildlife and become endemic as a result. There was a concern that if the ongoing outbreak is prolonged, it \"could establish new ecological niches in wild animals\" in regions outside of Africa.\n\n**Chronology**\n\nThe first case of monkeypox in the 2022 outbreak was reported in a British resident who had travelled to Lagos and Delta State in Nigeria, areas where monkeypox is considered to be an endemic disease. The person developed a rash on 29 April while in Nigeria and flew back to the United Kingdom, arriving on 4 May, and presented to hospital later the same day.\n\n**Transmission**\n\nA large portion of those infected had not recently travelled to areas of Africa where monkeypox is endemic. The disease is transmitted by close contact with infected people, with extra caution for those individuals with lesions on their skin or genitals, along with their bedding and clothing. The disease can spread via respiratory secretions or by direct contact with rashes, body fluids, or by touching objects and fabrics that have been used by someone with monkeypox.\n\n**Transmission Patterns**\n\nThe 2022-2023 outbreak initially had a different pattern of spread compared to prior monkeypox outbreaks outside Africa. Genetic evidence suggests the outbreak likely started in Nigeria. Given the unusually high frequency of human-to-human transmission observed in this event, and the probable community transmission without history of traveling to endemic areas, spread of the virus through close contact is more likely, with transmission during sexual activities being the most common route.\n\n**Wastewater Surveillance**\n\nA study from the Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, reported multiple traces of monkeypox virus were detected in non-sewered wastewater with sparse sampling collected from Bangkok, Thailand, with increasing concentrations from June to August 2022.\n\n**Interventions**\n\nIn early July 2022, scientists reported that the window to be able to contain the outbreak is closing or has closed. Previous attempts to control the disease had included encouraging individuals to quarantine or inoculation efforts directed at high-risk individuals. By late July 23, the WHO declared the monkeypox a public health emergency due to its prevalence and spread in multiple countries.\n\n**Testing and Containment**\n\nMpox testing is done in various ways, usually using a swab or test sample from an infected person's lesions, throat, blood, or semen. Upon the recommendation of the WHO, PCR testing became the most common test for diagnosing mpox during the outbreak.\n\n**Vaccination**\n\nAs of June 2022, ring-vaccinations and pre-exposure vaccination of men who have sex with men (MSM) were strategies in some countries to contain the outbreak. Two vaccines are available: smallpox vaccines containing vaccinia, such as Imvanex (Jynneos) and ACAM2000, which can provide around 85% effectiveness against mpox.\n\n**Social Aspects**\n\nPublic health authorities had aimed to target resources and health education to affected groups, but avoid stigma which could discourage people with symptoms or who have been exposed from seeking help. LGBT rights groups issued statements advising media to avoid stigmatizing marginalized groups such as men who have sex with men or transgender individuals.\n\n**Misinformation**\n\nMisinformation and conspiracy theories immediately spread online in various social media networks.

formerly known as monkeypox) [28] is an infectious viral disease that can occur in humans and other animals Symptoms include a rash that forms blisters and then crusts over, fever, and swollen lymph nodes The illness is usually mild, and most infected individuals recover within a few weeks without treatment The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms ranges from three to seventeen days, and symptoms typically last from two to four weeks However, cases may be severe, especially in children, pregnant women, or people with suppressed immune systems [29] [30] [31]\n\n\nEmergency preparedness prior to outbreak\nOn 17 March 2021, the Nuclear Threat Initiative led a tabletop exercise at the Munich Security Conference simulating hypothetical public health responses to the intentional release of a genetically manipulated strain of monkeypox virus [36] [37] On 23 July 2022, the World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus declared the 2022 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern [13] In May 2023, the emergency was declared over [16]\n\n\nEndemic mpox in Africa\nMpox is endemic to West and Central Africa [38] [39]\n\n\nOutbreak characteristics\nPrior to the 2022 outbreak, the United Kingdom had recorded only seven previous cases of mpox, [45] all of which were imported cases from Africa or healthcare workers involved in their treatment The first three such cases were in 2018, [45] followed by a further case in 2019 [46] and three more in 2021 [47] The only major mpox outbreak to be recorded in a Western country prior to 2022 was the 2003 Midwest monkeypox outbreak in the United States, which did not feature community transmission [48] [49]\n\n\nPhylogenetics\nPhylogenomic characterization of the first monkeypox virus outbreak genome sequences, found the \"presumably slow-evolving\" DNA virus has evolved roughly 6‚Äì12-fold more mutations than one would expect and 15 SNP mutations since the beginning of the outbreak [50] [51] Recombination has been reported in the natural transmission of monkeypox virus Using Tandem repeat polymorphism, case FVGITA-01 (ON755039) in Italy, case VIDRL01(ON631963) in Australia, as well as six cases in Slovenia (ON838178, ON631241, ON609725, ON754985, ON754986, ON754987) were recombinant crossovers Based on  linkage disequilibrium (LD) between monkeypox virus variants with minor alleles in at least two MPXV isolates and to detect the possible recombination, two Germany cases (ON959149 and ON637939) and one Spain case (ON720849) already gained their mutations via recombination [52]\nScientists investigated circulating lineages (and potential variants) of the monkeypox virus and are comparing them against the African endemic lineages [53] [54] [unreliable source] [55]\n\n\nLong incubation periods\nMost mpox patients become symptomatic 4‚Äì11 days after infection Very short incubation periods are also possible, with 5% of patients developing symptoms within 3 days This outbreak revealed that incubation periods of up to 4 weeks are possible, with 5% of cases having incubation periods longer than the previously assumed 21 days [56] [57]\n\n\nMild clinical manifestations\nAn analysis of studies by a journalist in August 2022 indicated that \"about 10-to-15% of cases had been hospitalized, mostly for pain and bacterial infections that can occur as a result of mpox lesions\" [58] Studies published a month later, in August indicated hospitalizations of small cohorts of early patients were 8% [59] and 13% [60] A short review suggested supportive care may typically be sufficient and that several antivirals and vaccinia immune globulin intravenous (VIGIV) are available as treatments [61] The outbreak showed there can be (rare) asymptomatic infections [62]\n\n\nFear of zoonotic spread\nIn May 2022, the UK Human Animal Infections and Risk Surveillance (HAIRS) group [63] warned that the virus could reach wildlife and become endemic as a result [64] [65] There was a concern that if the ongoing outbreak is prolonged, it \"could establish new ecological niches in wild animals\" in regions outside of Africa [66]\n\n\nChronology\nIn the beginning of May 2022, a case of mpox in a British resident who had travelled to Lagos and Delta State in Nigeria, [68] in areas where mpox is considered to be an endemic disease, was reported The person developed a rash on 29¬†April while in Nigeria and flew back to the United Kingdom, arriving on 4¬†May, [45] and presented to hospital later the same day Mpox infection was immediately suspected, and the patient was hospitalised at a specialist clinical unit of the Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust [45] and isolated, then tested positive for the virus on 6¬†May [68] Testing of patient swab samples by polymerase chain reaction revealed clade II of monkeypox virus, [1] which is the less deadly of the two known monkeypox virus variants with a case fatality rate of around 1% [68] The genomic sequence of the virus associated with this outbreak was first published on 19 May by Portuguese researchers [69]\n\n\nDeaths outside of Africa\nThe first death outside of endemic Africa was reported in Brazil on 29 July 2022, in a 41-year-old man with underlying comorbidities [100] On the same day Spain reported its first death, a 44-year-old man in Alicante, with the cause of death being encephalitis associated with mpox infection [101] [102] [103] [104] Spain reported its second mpox-related death on 30 July 2022, in a 31-year-old man in C√≥rdoba, who had also suffered from encephalitis according to reports [103] [105] [101] On 1 August 2022, India confirmed its first mpox death, a 22-year-old male who died in Thrissur, Kerala on 30 July [106] On the same day, Peru reported the death of a mpox-affected 45-year-old male, who also had HIV and septic shock [107]\n\n\nTransmission\nA large portion of those infected had not recently travelled to areas of Africa where mpox is endemic, such as Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo as well as central and western Africa It is transmitted by close contact with infected people, with extra caution for those individuals with lesions on their skin or genitals, along with their bedding and clothing The disease can spread via respiratory secretions or by direct contact with rashes, body fluids or by touching objects and fabrics that have been used by someone with mpox The CDC has also stated that individuals should avoid contact and consumption of dead animals such as rats, squirrels, monkeys and apes along with wild game or lotions derived from animals in Africa [109]\n\n\nTransmission patterns\nThe 2022‚Äì2023 outbreak initially had a different pattern of spread compared to prior mpox outbreaks outside Africa [110]  Genetic evidence suggest the outbreak likely started in Nigeria [111] [112] Given the unusually high frequency of human-to-human transmission observed in this event, and the probable community transmission without history of traveling to endemic areas, spread of the virus through close contact is more likely, with transmission during sexual activities being the most common route [113] Most cases have been in men [114] A significant proportion of cases, although not all, are in men who have sex with men (MSM), notably in Canada, Spain, and the UK, [114] with many cases diagnosed in sexual health clinics [110] Cases are mostly in young and middle-aged men [115] This points to transmission due to close contact during sex as being the main route of transmission [114] In May 2022, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) considered the monkeypox virus to be moderately transmissible among humans According to the centre, among MSM who contracted the virus, the most common means of transmission is likely through sexual activity due to intimate contact with infectious skin lesions The ECDC rated likelihood of transmission due to close contact, including sexual contact, as \"high\", but, without close contact, as low [113] In Nature, Anne Rimoin and Raina MacIntyre speculate that the higher percentage of MSM affected is a result of coincidental introduction to the community and then sexual activity constituting \"close contact\" rather than the virus itself becoming sexually transmitted [116] However, in a study published in August 2022, infectious monkeypox virus was able to be isolated from semen samples, [117] and the prolonged shedding of virus in seminal fluids raised the possibility of a genital reservoir for human mpox [117]\n\n\nWastewater surveillance\nA study from the Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, reported multiple traces of monkeypox virus were detected in non-sewered wastewater with sparse sampling collected from both the Bangkok, Thailand with increasing concentrations from June to August 2022 [127]  Monkeypox viral DNA was first detected in wastewater in the second week of June 2022 [127] From the first week of July, the number of viral DNA copies increased Sanger sequencing confirmed the identification of the monkeypox virus and its relation to the 2022‚Äì2023 mpox outbreak [127]\n\n\nInterventions\nIn early July 2022, scientists reported that the window to be able to contain the outbreak is closing or has closed [128] [129]

(Jynneos) and ACAM2000 can provide around 85% effectiveness against mpox [135] This protection level is calculated from studies using smallpox vaccines tested in late 1980 in Africa [136] [137] [138] According to the CDC the vaccination with Jynneos/Imvanex is \" [a]dministered as two subcutaneous injections four weeks apart\" while the vaccination with ACAM2000 is \"administered as one percutaneous dose via multiple puncture technique with a bifurcated needle\" [135] However, ACAM2000 is not recommended for potentially immunocompromised persons due to high replication competency of vaccinia while Imvanex (Jynneos) is recommended for potentially immunocompromised persons due it containing an attenuated, non-replicating orthopoxvirus, Modified Vaccinia Ankara-Bavarian Nordic

ashore, before moving southeastward, with the storm becoming disorganized in the process [22] [23] During this time, the storm reached a minimum pressure of 992 millibars (29.3¬†inHg) over the Rocky Mountains [23] On the same day, The Weather Channel gave the storm the unofficial name Winter Storm Uri; [14] the Federal Communications Commission adopted the name in their reports from February 17 [15] From February¬†12 to 13, a trough dipped southward from Northern California into northern Mexico, which channeled moisture from Texas towards the storm, as the system moved southeastward [24] Over the next couple of days, the storm began to develop as it entered the Southern United States and moved into Texas [25] From February¬†13 to 14, a second, much larger trough developed over Central United States, aided by a southward shift from the polar vortex, while the winter storm moved into Texas The trough became fully developed by February 15, channeling significant amounts of moisture into the winter storm and also contributing to a historic cold wave that affected most of the Central and Eastern United States [24] Winds in the jet stream reached 170¬†mph (275¬†km/h) around the trough [24] On February 15, the system developed a new surface low off the coast of the Florida Panhandle, as the storm turned northeastward and expanded in size [26]\n\n\nPreparations and impact\nOn February 14, the expected impacts from the storm resulted in over 170 million Americans being placed under various winter weather alerts across the United States, which saw the largest portion of the country covered by winter weather alerts in 15 years [16] [24] Over 120 million of those people were placed under winter storm warnings or ice storm warnings by the National Weather Service [40] The winter storm caused power grids to fail across the U.S., causing blackouts for over 5.2 million homes and businesses, the vast majority of which were in the state of Texas, which became one of the largest blackout events in modern U.S history, [12] [13] [41] the largest one since the Northeast blackout of 2003 [17] The storm was initially reported to have caused 70 deaths across the United States, [42] [43] [9] later updated to at least 276 people dead, 246 of them in Texas [4] [8] A BuzzFeed study in May 2021 estimated that the winter storm may have killed a total of 702 people in Texas, which would add hundreds of deaths to the official death toll if verified [44] The system was estimated by NOAA to have cost $21 billion in damage in the United States, making it the costliest winter storm in U.S history at the time [45] City of Austin and Travis County officials estimated that the winter storm caused at least $195 billion in damage in Texas, making the winter storm the single-costliest natural disaster in the history of Texas and the United States as a whole [20] Some insurance firms had estimated a damage total of between 195 and 295 billion dollars [46]

compounded the previous storm [48] This was the largest two-day snowfall recorded in Seattle since 1972 [49]\n\n\nSouthwest\nThe storm brought heavy snow and bitterly cold temperatures to Colorado and New Mexico Snow amounts in Colorado ranged from a few inches in the north to over 2 feet (0.61¬†m) in the San Juan Mountains in northern New Mexico and southern Colorado [57] In New Mexico, the storm system brought a combination of heavy snow, strong winds, and bitterly cold temperatures On February 14, a Blizzard Warning was issued for the Albuquerque metro area due to strong winds exceeding 50 miles per hour (80¬†km/h), cold temperatures, and blowing snow [58] Meanwhile, Winter Storm Warnings were issued for much of the rest of New Mexico Up to 2 feet (61¬†cm) of snow fell in the mountains of northern and central New Mexico Snow amounts in the Albuquerque metro area ranged from 2 to 6 inches (5.1 to 15.2¬†cm) Interstate Highway 40 through the Albuquerque metro area was closed for several hours due to numerous motor vehicle crashes caused by the icy conditions [59] Southern New Mexico received up to 2 inches (5.1¬†cm) of snow accumulation, with locally higher amounts in the mountains [60]\n\n\nCentral and Southern Plains\nWith the threat of icing, the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) pre-treated roadways, using a brine-salt mix, across six Southeast Texas counties [61] For the first time on record, the National Weather Service (through its 13 regional offices serving Texas and adjoining portions of Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arkansas and Louisiana) issued Winter Storm Warnings for all 254 counties in the state [14] In addition, Houston saw their first ever wind chill warning, as wind chills dipped to 0¬†¬∞F (‚àí18¬†¬∞C) [62] Wind chills predicted to be at or below ‚àí18¬†¬∞F (‚àí28¬†¬∞C) promoted the first ever wind chill warning for Dallas as well [63]\n\n\nGreat Lakes\nChicago along with other cities in northern Illinois received up to 14‚Äì17¬†in (36‚Äì43¬†cm) of snow along with winds up to 20¬†mph (32¬†km/h) Due to the snowstorm, several Chicago Transit Authority trains suspended operations on February 16 [105] Chicago experienced its snowiest 3-week period since 1979 [106] Indianapolis, Indiana, received about 7¬†in (18¬†cm) of snow as well as Detroit, Michigan, also had 7¬†in (18¬†cm) of snow Toledo, Ohio, received 14.5¬†in (37¬†cm) of snow, the third-highest two-day snowfall record, and the highest since 1912 Other Northern Ohio cities received up to 10‚Äì12¬†in (25‚Äì30¬†cm) of snow while cities in the central part received up to 3¬†in (7.6¬†cm) of snow like in Columbus, Ohio [107] After the storm, Milwaukee set a record for deepest snow depth ever [108]\n\n\nTornado outbreak\nA severe weather outbreak struck the Southeastern United States on February¬†15, with large hail, damaging winds, and six tornadoes affecting five states [109] An EF2¬†tornado destroyed two homes and damaged trees near Damascus, Georgia, injuring five people A more destructive high-end EF3¬†tornado struck the Ocean Ridge Plantation neighborhood near Sunset Beach, North Carolina, causing major damage to many homes, some of which were leveled or swept away, before moving into rural areas and damaging or snapping hundreds of trees This tornado killed three and injured¬†10 [110] [111]\n\n\nConfirmed tornadoes\nThis destructive tornado touched down at the north edge of Sunset Beach, just north of the border with South Carolina, damaging numerous pine trees and limbs at EF0¬†intensity as it crossed NC 179, before rapidly intensifying to EF2¬†strength as it neared NC 904 [118] A tornado warning was not issued until after the tornado touched down and began causing damage [119] As the tornado crossed the road, a large metal building was destroyed and a number of RVs were overturned Still rapidly strengthening, the tornado entered Grissettown and struck the Ocean Ridge Plantation subdivision at its peak intensity of high-end¬†EF3 A community garden center and two homes were leveled at this location, one of which was swept completely away This home was well-constructed, but built on a block foundation, and vehicles parked at the site were moved only short distances Dozens of other nearby homes were damaged, some of which sustained loss of roofs and exterior walls Many large trees were snapped and denuded in the subdivision, and a car was overturned All three fatalities occurred in the Ocean Ridge Plantation subdivision The tornado then abruptly weakened but reached its maximum width as it crossed US 17 between Grissettown and Cool Run as it exited Ocean Ridge Plantation at EF1¬†strength, rolling a double-wide mobile home on the north side of the highway As the tornado continued northeast, it reintensifed to EF2 strength, causing major damage to several homes and snapping hundreds of trees It then inflicted a continuous path of tree damage through forest and swamp land, crossing NC 130 and NC 211 [118] The tornado finally lifted east of NC 211 [120]\n\n\nSunset Beach‚ÄìDelco, North Carolina\nThis destructive tornado touched down at the north edge of Sunset

211 [120]\n\n\nMexico\nThe winter storm strained the power grids in northern Mexico, leading to cascading blackouts for 4.7 million homes and businesses in Mexico [12] Temperatures as low as ‚àí18¬†¬∞C (0¬†¬∞F) were recorded, as shortages of natural gas led to blackouts in Nuevo Le√≥n, Coahuila, Tamaulipas, and Chihuahua along the border with Texas [123] At least 14 people died in Ciudad Ju√°rez, Chihuahua; R√≠o Bravo and Matamoros, Tamaulipas; and Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n; due to the winter storm [7] [19] President Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador (AMLO) said on February 17 that Mexico would increase the use of oil and coal to produce electricity, as well as purchase three shiploads of natural gas to deal with power shortages He also warned that periodic local outages would continue through February 21 [124] Local authorities said that no hospitals had been left without electricity at any time [125] The storm was estimated to have caused over US$1.5 billion in damages in Mexico [3]\n\n\nCanada\nIn Ontario, snowfall warnings were issued in advance of the winter storm School bus service was cancelled across the Greater Toronto Area, and schools were completely closed in Halton and Durham [126] 20¬†cm (7.9¬†in) of snow fell in Windsor, 12¬†cm (4.7¬†in) at Toronto Pearson International Airport and 18¬†cm (7.1¬†in) fell in Ottawa The highest totals in the region were the over 30¬†cm (12¬†in) in and around the Hamilton and Niagara Region [127]\n\n\nAftermath\nThe storm was shortly followed by another major winter storm a few days later, which caused at least an additional 29 fatalities and US$2 billion in damage, worsening the 2021 Texas power crisis and hampering recovery efforts in the state [128] [129] [130]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal

His life, cut short by illness, has been the subject of much speculation and curiosity. This article delves into the life and career of Bertram Fletcher Robinson, exploring his writing and editorial endeavors, his untimely death, and the lasting legacy he has left behind.\n\n**Early Life and Family**\n\nBertram Fletcher Robinson was born on 22 August 1870 at 80 Rose Lane, Mossley Hill, Liverpool. His family later relocated to Park Hill House in Ipplepen, Devon, where he spent his formative years. Little is known about his early life, but it is clear that he was destined for a career in writing and editing.\n\n**Writing and Editorial Career**\n\nBertram Fletcher Robinson's writing and editorial career spanned several notable publications. He held editorial positions with The Newtonian (1887-1889), the Granta (1893-1895), and The Isthmian Library (1897-1901). His tenure at the Daily Express (July 1900-May 1904) was followed by a stint at Vanity Fair (May 1904-October 1906), where he would have been exposed to the creative and fashionable circles of the time. Later, he worked at The World (journal) (October 1906-January 1907) and The Gentleman's Magazine (January 1907).\n\nRobinson's writing career was marked by a keen interest in mystery and detective fiction. His short stories and articles often explored themes of crime and detection, providing a glimpse into his creative mind. His most notable work, The Chronicles of Addington Peace, was a collection of crime short stories that would later be recognized as influential in the genre.\n\n**Death**\n\nBertram Fletcher Robinson died on 21 January 1907, at the age of 36, at his residence in Belgravia, London. The official cause of death was recorded as enteric fever (three weeks) and peritonitis (twenty-four hours). However, an alternative explanation for his death has been suggested by some contemporaries with a bent for the occult. They attribute his demise to a curse associated with an Egyptian artefact called the Unlucky Mummy, which he had investigated in 1904.\n\n**Funeral and Memorial Services**\n\nA funeral service was held for Robinson at St Andrew's Church in Ipplepen on 24 January 1907. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, a close friend and fellow writer, was unable to attend due to his commitment to campaigning for the release of George Edalji. Doyle did, however, send a floral tribute to the funeral service, with a heartfelt message expressing his regret at not being able to attend.\n\n**Posthumous Reaction**\n\nThe impact of Bertram Fletcher Robinson's work continued to be felt after his death. In 1949, Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine recognized Robinson's The Chronicles of Addington Peace as one of the most influential collections of crime short stories ever written. This recognition cemented his reputation as a pioneer in the genre.\n\n**Posthumous Speculation**\n\nThe exact role of Bertram Fletcher Robinson in the creation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Hound of the Baskervilles has been the subject of much speculation. While some have suggested that Robinson's work may have inspired Doyle's novel, others have proposed that Robinson's original idea was incorporated into the final product. The truth behind this enduring mystery may never be fully known.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nBertram Fletcher Robinson's legacy extends beyond his writing and editorial career. He commissioned Charles Eamer Kempe to design a stained-glass window to commemorate his late mother, Emily Robinson. The window, which depicts the Good Shepherd with Saint Peter and Saint Paul, was added to the north-side of the chancel at St Andrew's Church in Ipplepen.\n\nIn addition to the window, Robinson's name was added to the inscription on the memorial window, which commemorates his mother. This tribute serves as a lasting reminder of his dedication to his family and his community.\n\nIn conclusion, Bertram Fletcher Robinson's life and career were marked by a passion for writing and editing, a keen interest in mystery and detective fiction, and a lasting impact on the literary world.

{"title": "Hedge_fund", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe word \"hedge\", meaning a line of bushes around the perimeter of a field, has long been used as a metaphor for placing limits on risk [9] Early hedge funds sought to hedge specific investments against general market fluctuations by shorting other, similar assets [10]:‚Ää4‚Ää Nowadays, however, many different investment strategies are used, many of which do not \"hedge\" risk [10]:‚Ää16‚Äì34‚Ää [11]\n\n\nHistory\nDuring the US bull market of the 1920s, there were numerous private investment vehicles available to wealthy investors Of that period, the best known today is the Graham-Newman Partnership, founded by Benjamin Graham and his long-time business partner Jerry Newman [12] This was cited by Warren Buffett in a 2006 letter to the Museum of American Finance as an early hedge fund, [13] and based on other comments from Buffett, Janet Tavakoli deems Graham's investment firm the first hedge fund [14]\n\n\nNotable hedge fund managers\nHedge fund strategies are generally classified among four major categories: global macro, directional, event-driven, and relative value (arbitrage) [66] Strategies within these categories each entail characteristic risk and return profiles A fund may employ a single strategy or multiple strategies for flexibility, risk management, or diversification [67] The hedge fund's prospectus, also known as an offering memorandum, offers potential investors information about key aspects of the fund, including the fund's investment strategy, investment type, and leverage limit [68]\n\n\nStrategies\nHedge fund strategies are generally classified among four major categories: global macro, directional, event-driven, and relative value (arbitrage) [66] Strategies within these categories each entail characteristic risk and return profiles A fund may employ a single strategy or multiple strategies for flexibility, risk management, or diversification [67] The hedge fund's prospectus, also known as an offering memorandum, offers potential investors information about key aspects of the fund, including the fund's investment strategy, investment type, and leverage limit [68]\n\n\nGlobal macro\nHedge funds using a global macro investing strategy take large positions in share, bond, or currency markets in anticipation of global macroeconomic events in order to generate a risk-adjusted return [70] Global macro fund managers use macroeconomic (\"big picture\") analysis based on global market events and trends to identify opportunities for investment that would profit from anticipated price movements While global macro strategies have a large amount of flexibility (due to their ability to use leverage to take large positions in diverse investments in multiple markets), the timing of the implementation of the strategies is important in order to generate attractive, risk-adjusted returns [71] Global macro is often categorized as a directional investment strategy [70]\n\n\nDirectional\nDirectional investment strategies use market movements, trends, or inconsistencies when picking stocks across a variety of markets Computer models can be used, or fund managers will identify and select investments These types of strategies have a greater exposure to the fluctuations of the overall market than do market neutral strategies [67] [70] Directional hedge fund strategies include US and international long/short equity hedge funds, where long equity positions are hedged with short sales of equities or equity index options.\n\n\nEvent-driven\nEvent-driven strategies concern situations in which the underlying investment opportunity and risk are associated with an event [77] An event-driven investment strategy finds investment opportunities in corporate transactional events such as consolidations, acquisitions, recapitalizations, bankruptcies, and liquidations Managers employing such a strategy capitalize on valuation inconsistencies in the market before or after such events, and take a position based on the predicted movement of the security or securities in question Large institutional investors such as hedge funds are more likely to pursue event-driven investing strategies than traditional equity investors because they have the expertise and resources to analyze corporate transactional events for investment opportunities [71] [78] [79]\n\n\nRelative value\nRelative value arbitrage strategies take advantage of relative discrepancies in price between securities The price discrepancy can occur due to mispricing of securities compared to related securities, the underlying security or the market overall Hedge fund managers can use various types of analysis to identify price discrepancies in securities, including mathematical, technical, or fundamental techniques [82] Relative value is often used as a synonym for market neutral, as strategies in this category typically have very little or no directional market exposure to the market as a whole [83] Other relative value sub-strategies include:\n\n\nMiscellaneous\nIn addition to those strategies within the four main categories, there are several strategies that do not entirely fit into these categories.\n\n\nRisk\nFor an investor who already holds large quantities of equities and bonds, investment in hedge funds may provide diversification and reduce the overall portfolio risk [84] Managers of hedge funds often aim to produce returns that are relatively uncorrelated with market indices and are consistent with investors' desired level of risk [85] [86] While hedging can reduce some risks of an investment it usually increases others, such as operational risk and model risk, so overall risk is reduced but cannot be eliminated According to a report by the Hennessee Group, hedge funds were approximately one-third less volatile than the S&P 500 between 1993 and 2010 [87]\n\n\nRisk management\nInvestors in hedge funds are, in most countries, required to be qualified investors who are assumed to be aware of the investment risks, and accept these risks because of the potential returns relative to those risks Fund managers may employ extensive risk management strategies in order to protect the fund and investors According to the Financial Times, \"big hedge funds have some of the most sophisticated and exacting risk management practices anywhere in asset management.\" [85] Hedge fund managers that hold a large number of investment positions for short periods are likely to have a particularly comprehensive risk management system in place, and it has become usual for funds to have independent risk officers who assess and manage risks but are not otherwise involved in trading [88] A variety of different measurement techniques and models are used to estimate risk according to the fund's leverage, liquidity, and investment strategy [86] [89] Non-normality of returns, volatility clustering and trends are not always accounted for by conventional risk measurement methodologies and so in addition to value at risk and similar measurements, funds may use integrated measures such as drawdowns [90]\n\n\nTransparency, and regulatory considerations\nSince hedge funds are private entities and have few public disclosure requirements, this is sometimes perceived as a lack of transparency [92] Another common perception of hedge funds is that their managers are not subject to as much regulatory oversight and/or registration requirements as other financial investment managers, and more prone to manager-specific idiosyncratic risks such as style drifts, faulty operations, or fraud [93] New regulations introduced in the US and the EU as of 2010 required hedge fund managers to report more information, leading to greater transparency [94] In addition, investors, particularly institutional investors, are encouraging further developments in hedge fund risk management, both through internal practices and external regulatory requirements [85] The increasing influence of institutional investors has led to greater transparency: hedge funds increasingly provide information to investors including valuation methodology, positions, and leverage exposure [95]\n\n\nRisks shared with other investment types\nHedge funds share many of the same types of risk as other investment classes, including liquidity risk and manager risk [93] Liquidity refers to the degree to which an asset can be bought and sold or converted to cash; similar to private-equity funds, hedge funds employ a lock-up period during which an investor cannot remove money [70] [96] Manager risk refers to those risks which arise from the management of funds As well as specific risks such as style drift, which refers to a fund manager \"drifting\" away from an area of specific expertise, manager risk factors include valuation risk, capacity risk, concentration risk, and leverage risk [92] Valuation risk refers to the concern that the net asset value (NAV) of investments may be inaccurate; [97] capacity risk can arise from placing too much money into one particular strategy, which may lead to fund performance deterioration; [98] and concentration risk may arise if a fund has too much exposure to a particular investment, sector, trading strategy, or group of correlated funds [99] These risks may be managed through defined controls over conflict of interest, [97] restrictions on allocation of funds, [98] and set exposure limits for strategies [99]\n\n\nFees and remuneration\nHedge fund management firms typically charge their funds both a management fee and a performance fee.\n\n\nFees paid to hedge funds\nHedge fund management firms typically charge their funds both a management fee and a performance fee.\n\n\nRemuneration of portfolio managers\nHedge fund management firms are often owned by their portfolio managers, who are therefore entitled to any profits that the business makes As management fees are intended to cover the firm's operating costs, performance fees (and any excess management fees) are generally distributed to the firm's owners as profits Funds do not tend to report compensation, and so published lists of the amounts earned by top managers tend to be estimates based on factors such as the fees charged by their funds and the capital they are thought to have invested in them [113] Many managers have accumulated large stakes in their own funds and so top hedge fund managers can earn extraordinary amounts of money, perhaps up to $4 billion in a good year [114] [115]\n\n\nStructure\nA hedge fund is an investment vehicle that is most often structured as an offshore corporation, limited partnership, or limited liability company [128] The fund is managed by an investment manager in the form of an organization or company that is legally and financially distinct from the hedge fund and its portfolio of assets [129] [130] Many investment managers utilize service providers for operational support [131] Service providers include prime brokers, banks, administrators, distributors, and accounting firms.\n\n\nPrime broker\nPrime brokers clear trades and provide leverage and short-term financing [132] [133] They are usually divisions of large investment banks [134] The prime broker acts as a counterparty to derivative contracts, and lends securities for particular investment strategies, such as long/short equities and convertible bond arbitrage [135] [136] It can provide custodial services for the fund's assets, and trade execution and clearing services for the hedge fund manager [137]\n\n\nAdministrator\nHedge fund administrators are typically responsible for valuation services, and often operations, and accounting.\n\n\nAuditor\nAn auditor is an independent accounting firm used to perform a complete audit the fund's financial statements The year-end audit is performed in accordance with the standard accounting practices enforced within the country in which the fund it established, typically US GAAP or the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) [147] The auditor may verify the fund's NAV and assets under management (AUM) [148] [149] Some auditors only provide \"NAV lite\" services, meaning that the valuation is based on prices received from the manager rather than an independent assessment [150]\n\n\nDistributor\nA distributor is an underwriter, broker, dealer, or other person who participates in the distribution of securities [151] The distributor is also responsible for marketing the fund to potential investors Many hedge funds do not have distributors, and in such cases, the investment manager will be responsible for the distribution of securities and marketing, though many funds also use placement agents and broker-dealers for distribution [152] [153]\n\n\nDomicile and taxation\nThe legal structure of a specific hedge fund, in particular its domicile and the type of legal entity in use, is usually determined by the tax expectations of the fund's investors Regulatory considerations will also play a role Many hedge funds are established in offshore financial centers to avoid adverse tax consequences for its foreign and tax-exempt investors [154] [155] Offshore funds that invest in the US typically pay withholding taxes on certain types of investment income, but not US capital gains tax However, the fund's investors are subject to tax in their own jurisdictions on any increase in the value of their investments [156] [157] This tax treatment promotes cross-border investments by limiting the potential for multiple jurisdictions to layer taxes on investors [158]\n\n\nBasket options\nDeutsche Bank and Barclays created special options accounts for hedge fund clients in the banks' names and claimed to own the assets, when in fact the hedge fund clients had full control of the assets and reaped the profits The hedge funds would then execute trades ‚Äì many of them a few seconds in duration ‚Äì but wait until just after a year had passed to exercise the options, allowing them to report the profits at a lower long-term capital gains tax rate.\n\nInvestment manager locations\nIn contrast to the funds themselves, investment managers are primarily located onshore The United States remains the largest center of investment with US-based funds managing around 70% of global assets at the end of 2011 [160] As of April 2012, there were approximately 3,990 investment advisers managing one or more private hedge funds registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission [164] New York City and the Gold Coast area of Connecticut are the leading locations for US hedge fund managers [165] [166]\n\n\nLegal entity\nHedge fund legal structures vary depending on location and the investor(s) US hedge funds aimed at US-based, taxable investors are generally structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies Limited partnerships and other flow-through taxation structures assure that investors in hedge funds are not subject to both entity-level and personal-level taxation [137] A hedge fund structured as a limited partnership must have a general partner The general partner may be an individual or a corporation The general partner serves as the manager of the limited partnership, and has unlimited liability [132] [175] The limited partners serve as the fund's investors, and have no responsibility for management or investment decisions Their liability is limited to the amount of money they invest for partnership interests [175] [176] As an alternative to a limited partnership arrangement, U.S domestic hedge funds may be structured as limited liability companies, with members acting as corporate shareholders and enjoying protection from individual liability [177]\n\n\nTypes of funds\nA side pocket is a mechanism whereby a fund compartmentalizes assets that are relatively illiquid or difficult to value reliably [185] When an investment is side-pocketed, its value is calculated separately from the value of the fund's main portfolio [186] Because side pockets are used to hold illiquid investments, investors do not have the standard redemption rights with respect to the side pocket investment that they do with respect to the fund's main portfolio [186] Profits or losses from the investment are allocated on a pro rata basis only to those who are investors at the time the investment is placed into the side pocket and are not shared with new investors [186] [187] Funds typically carry side pocket assets \"at cost\" for purposes of calculating management fees and reporting net asset values This allows fund managers to avoid attempting a valuation of the underlying investments, which may not always have a readily available market value [187]\n\n\nSide pockets\nA side pocket is a mechanism whereby a fund compartmentalizes assets that are relatively illiquid or difficult to

which may not always have a readily available market value [187]\n\n\nRegulation\nHedge funds must abide by the national, federal, and state regulatory laws in their respective locations The U.S regulations and restrictions that apply to hedge funds differ from those that apply to its mutual funds [191] Mutual funds, unlike hedge funds and other private funds, are subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940, which is a highly detailed and extensive regulatory regime [192] According to a report by the International Organization of Securities Commissions, the most common form of regulation pertains to restrictions on financial advisers and hedge fund managers in an effort to minimize client fraud On the other hand, U.S hedge funds are exempt from many of the standard registration and reporting requirements because they only accept accredited investors [70] In 2010, regulations were enacted in the US and European Union which introduced additional hedge fund reporting requirements These included the U.S.'s Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act [4] and European Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive [193]\n\n\nUnited States\nHedge funds within the US are subject to regulatory, reporting, and record-keeping requirements [197] Many hedge funds also fall under the jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and are subject to rules and provisions of the 1922 Commodity Exchange Act, which prohibits fraud and manipulation [198] The Securities Act of 1933 required companies to file a registration statement with the SEC to comply with its private placement rules before offering their securities to the public, [199] and most traditional hedge funds in the United States are offered effectively as private placement offerings [200] The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 required a fund with more than 499 investors to register with the SEC [201] [202] [203] The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 contained anti-fraud provisions that regulated hedge fund managers and advisers, created limits for the number and types of investors, and prohibited public offerings The Act also exempted hedge funds from mandatory registration with the SEC [70] [204] [205] when selling to accredited investors with a minimum of US$5¬†million in investment assets Companies and institutional investors with at least US$25¬†million in investment assets also qualified [206]\n\n\nEurope\nWithin the European Union (EU), hedge funds are primarily regulated through their managers [70] In the United Kingdom, where 80% of Europe's hedge funds are based, [220] hedge fund managers are required to be authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) [193] Each country has its own specific restrictions on hedge fund activities, including controls on use of derivatives in Portugal, and limits on leverage in France [70]\n\n\nOffshore\nSome hedge funds are established in offshore centres, such as the Cayman Islands, Dublin, Luxembourg, Singapore [224] the British Virgin Islands, and Bermuda, which have different regulations [225] concerning non-accredited investors, client confidentiality, and fund manager independence [4] [193]\n\n\nSouth Africa\nIn South Africa, investment fund managers must be approved by, and register with, the Financial Services Board (FSB) [226]\n\n\nPerformance\nPerformance statistics for individual hedge funds are difficult to obtain, as the funds have historically not been required to report their performance to a central repository, and restrictions against public offerings and advertisement have led many managers to refuse to provide performance information publicly However, summaries of individual hedge fund performance are occasionally available in industry journals [227] [228] and databases [229]\n\n\nMeasurement\nPerformance statistics for individual hedge funds are difficult to obtain, as the funds have historically not been required to report their performance to a central repository, and restrictions against public offerings and advertisement have led many managers to refuse to provide performance information publicly However, summaries of individual hedge fund performance are occasionally available in industry journals [227] [228] and databases [229]\n\n\nSector-size effect\nThere is a debate over whether alpha (the manager's skill element in performance) has been diluted by the expansion of the hedge fund industry Two reasons are given First, the increase in traded volume may have been reducing the market anomalies that are a source of hedge fund performance Second, the remuneration model is attracting more managers, which may dilute the talent available in the industry [241] [242]\n\n\nHedge fund indices\nIndices play a central and unambiguous role in traditional asset markets, where they are widely accepted as representative of their underlying portfolios Equity and debt index fund products provide investable access to most developed markets in these asset classes.\n\n\nNon-investable indices\nNon-investable indices are indicative in nature and aim to represent the performance of some database of hedge funds using some measure such as mean, median, or weighted mean from a hedge fund database The databases have diverse selection criteria and methods of construction, and no single database captures all funds This leads to significant differences in reported performance between different indices.\n\n\nInvestable indices\nInvestable indices are an attempt to reduce these problems by ensuring that the return of the index is available to shareholders To create an investable index, the index provider selects funds and develops structured products or derivative instruments that deliver the performance of the index When investors buy these products the index provider makes the investments in the underlying funds, making an investable index similar in some ways to a fund of hedge funds portfolio.\n\n\nHedge fund replication\nThe most recent addition to the field approaches the problem in a different manner Instead of reflecting the performance of actual hedge funds, they take a statistical approach to the analysis of historic hedge fund returns and use this to construct a model of how hedge fund returns respond to the movements of various investable financial assets This model is then used to construct an investable portfolio of those assets This makes the index investable, and in principle, they can be as representative as the hedge fund database from which they were constructed However, these clone indices rely on a statistical modelling process Such indices have too short a history to state whether this approach will be considered successful.\n\n\nClosures\nIn March 2017, HFR ‚Äì a hedge fund research data and service provider ‚Äì reported that there were more hedge-fund closures in 2016 than during the 2009 recession According to the report, several large public pension funds pulled their investments in hedge funds, because the funds' subpar performance as a group did not merit the high fees they charged.\n\n\nDebates and controversies\nSystemic risk refers to the risk of instability across the entire financial system, as opposed to within a single company Such risk may arise following a destabilizing event or events affecting a group of financial institutions linked through investment activity [244] Organizations such as the European Central Bank have charged that hedge funds pose systemic risks to the financial sector, [245] [246] and following the failure of hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) in 1998 there was widespread concern about the potential for systemic risk if a hedge fund failure led to the failure of its counterparties (As it happens, no financial assistance was provided to LTCM by the US Federal Reserve, so there was no direct cost to US taxpayers, [247] but a large bailout had to be mounted by a number of financial institutions.)\n\n\nSystemic risk\nSystemic risk refers to the risk of instability across the entire financial system, as opposed to within a single company Such risk may arise following a

taxpayers, [247] but a large bailout had to be mounted by a number of financial institutions.)\n\n\nTransparency\nHedge funds are structured to avoid most direct regulation (although their managers may be regulated), and are not required to publicly disclose their investment activities, except to the extent that investors generally are subject to disclosure requirements This is in contrast to a regulated mutual fund or exchange-traded fund, which will typically have to meet regulatory requirements for disclosure An investor in a hedge fund usually has direct access to the investment adviser of the fund, and may enjoy more personalized reporting than investors in retail investment funds This may include detailed discussions of risks assumed and significant positions However, this high level of disclosure is not available to non-investors, contributing to hedge funds' reputation for secrecy, while some hedge funds have very limited transparency even to investors [255]\n\n\nLinks with analysts\nIn June 2006, prompted by a letter from Gary J Aguirre, the U.S Senate Judiciary Committee began an investigation into the links between hedge funds and independent analysts Aguirre was fired from his job with the SEC when, as lead investigator of insider trading allegations against Pequot Capital Management, he tried to interview John Mack, then being considered for chief executive officer at Morgan Stanley [274] The Judiciary Committee and the US Senate Finance Committee issued a scathing report in 2007, which found that Aguirre had been illegally fired in reprisal [275] for his pursuit of Mack, and in 2009 the SEC was forced to re-open its case against Pequot Pequot settled with the SEC for US$28¬†million, and Arthur J Samberg, chief investment officer of Pequot, was barred from working as an investment advisor [276] Pequot closed its doors under the pressure of investigations [277]\n\n\nValue in a mean/variance efficient portfolio\nAccording to modern portfolio theory, rational investors will seek to hold portfolios that are mean/variance efficient (that is, portfolios that offer the highest level of return per unit of risk) One of the attractive features of hedge funds (in particular market neutral and similar funds) is that they sometimes have a modest correlation with traditional assets such as equities This means that hedge funds have a potentially quite valuable role in investment portfolios as diversifiers, reducing overall portfolio risk [109]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "# Hedge Fund\n\nA hedge fund is a type of investment vehicle that is often structured as an offshore corporation, limited partnership, or limited liability company. Hedge funds are typically managed by an investment manager who uses a pool of money from high net worth individuals, institutional investors, or other accredited investors to invest in a variety of assets, including stocks, bonds, commodities, and currencies.\n\n## Etymology\n\nThe word \"hedge\" in hedge fund comes from the idea of hedging, or placing limits on risk. Hedge funds were originally designed to hedge specific investments against general market fluctuations by shorting other, similar assets. However, today, many different investment strategies are used, and not all hedge funds \"hedge\" risk.\n\n## History\n\nThe concept of hedge funds dates back to the 1920s, when wealthy investors had access to private investment vehicles. One of the earliest known hedge funds was the Graham-Newman Partnership, founded by Benjamin Graham and Jerry Newman. In a 2006 letter to the Museum of American Finance, Warren Buffett cited the Graham-Newman Partnership as an early hedge fund. Janet Tavakoli deems Graham's investment firm the first hedge fund.\n\n## Notable Hedge Fund Managers\n\nHedge fund managers are generally classified among four major categories: global macro, directional, event-driven, and relative value (arbitrage). These categories encompass various strategies and risk profiles. Managers may employ a single strategy or multiple strategies for flexibility, risk management, or diversification.\n\n## Strategies\n\n### Global Macro\n\nGlobal macro hedge funds take large positions in share, bond, or currency markets in anticipation of global macroeconomic events. They use macroeconomic analysis to identify opportunities for investment that would profit from anticipated price movements. Global macro strategies have flexibility due to their ability to use leverage to take large positions in diverse investments in multiple markets.\n\n### Directional\n\nDirectional hedge funds use market movements, trends, or inconsistencies when picking stocks across a variety of markets. They may use computer models or identify and select investments based on market analysis. Directional hedge funds have a greater exposure to the fluctuations of the overall market than market-neutral strategies.\n\n### Event-Driven\n\nEvent-driven strategies concern situations in which the underlying investment opportunity and risk are associated with an event. Managers employing such a strategy capitalize on valuation inconsistencies in the market before or after such events. Event-driven investing strategies are more likely to be pursued by large institutional investors, such as hedge funds, due to their expertise and resources.\n\n### Relative Value\n\nRelative value arbitrage strategies take advantage of relative discrepancies in price between securities. Hedge fund managers use various types of analysis to identify price discrepancies in securities, including mathematical, technical, or fundamental techniques. Relative value strategies are often used as a synonym for market-neutral, as they typically have very little or no directional market exposure.\n\n## Risk\n\nFor an investor who already holds large quantities of equities and bonds, investment in hedge funds may provide diversification and reduce overall portfolio risk. Managers of hedge funds aim to produce returns that are relatively uncorrelated with market indices and consistent with investors' desired level of risk. While hedging can reduce some risks of an investment, it usually increases others, such as operational risk and model risk.\n\n## Risk Management\n\nInvestors in hedge funds are required to be qualified investors who are aware of the investment risks and accept them because of the potential returns relative to those risks. Fund managers may employ extensive risk management strategies to protect the fund and investors. According to the Financial Times, big hedge funds have some of the most sophisticated and exacting risk management practices anywhere in asset management.\n\n## Transparency and Regulatory Considerations\n\nHedge funds are private entities and have few public disclosure requirements, which is sometimes perceived as a lack of transparency. Another common perception is that hedge fund managers are not subject to as much regulatory oversight and/or registration requirements as other financial investment managers. New regulations introduced in the US and the EU as of 2010 required hedge fund managers to report more information, leading to greater transparency.\n\n## Fees and Remuneration\n\nHedge fund management firms typically charge their funds both a management fee and a performance fee. The management fee is intended to cover the firm's operating costs, while the performance fee (and any excess management fees) is generally distributed to the firm's owners as profits. Top hedge fund managers can earn extraordinary amounts of money, perhaps up to $4 billion in a good year.\n\n## Structure\n\nA hedge fund is an investment vehicle that is most often structured as an offshore corporation, limited partnership, or limited liability company.

outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe word \"hedge\", meaning a line of bushes around the perimeter of a field, has long been used as a metaphor for placing limits on risk [9] Early hedge funds sought to hedge specific investments against general market fluctuations by shorting other, similar assets [10]:‚Ää4‚Ää Nowadays, however, many different investment strategies are used, many of which do not \"hedge\" risk [10]:‚Ää16‚Äì34‚Ää [11]\n\n\nHistory\nDuring the US bull market of the 1920s, there were numerous private investment vehicles available to wealthy investors Of that period, the best known today is the Graham-Newman Partnership, founded by Benjamin Graham and his long-time business partner Jerry Newman [12] This was cited by Warren Buffett in a 2006 letter to the Museum of American Finance as an early hedge fund, [13] and based on other comments from Buffett, Janet Tavakoli deems Graham's investment firm the first hedge fund [14]\n\n\nNotable hedge fund managers\nHedge fund strategies are generally classified among four major categories: global macro, directional, event-driven, and relative value (arbitrage) [66] Strategies within these categories each entail characteristic risk and return profiles A fund may employ a single strategy or multiple strategies for flexibility, risk management, or diversification [67] The hedge fund's prospectus, also known as an offering memorandum, offers potential investors information about key aspects of the fund, including the fund's investment strategy, investment type, and leverage limit [68]\n\n\nStrategies\nHedge fund strategies are

offers potential investors information about key aspects of the fund, including the fund's investment strategy, investment type, and leverage limit [68]\n\n\nGlobal macro\nHedge funds using a global macro investing strategy take large positions in share, bond, or currency markets in anticipation of global macroeconomic events in order to generate a risk-adjusted return [70] Global macro fund managers use macroeconomic (\"big picture\") analysis based on global market events and trends to identify opportunities for investment that would profit from anticipated price movements While global macro strategies have a large amount of flexibility (due to their ability to use leverage to take large positions in diverse investments in multiple markets), the timing of the implementation of the strategies is important in order to generate attractive, risk-adjusted returns [71] Global macro is often categorized as a directional investment strategy [70]\n\n\nDirectional\nDirectional investment strategies use market movements, trends, or inconsistencies when picking stocks across a variety of markets Computer models can be used, or fund managers will identify and select investments These types of strategies have a greater exposure to the fluctuations of the overall market than do market neutral strategies [67] [70] Directional hedge fund strategies include US and international long/short equity hedge funds, where long equity positions are hedged with short sales of equities or equity index options.\n\n\nEvent-driven\nEvent-driven strategies concern situations in which the underlying investment opportunity and risk are associated with an event [77] An event-driven investment strategy finds investment opportunities in corporate transactional events such as consolidations, acquisitions, recapitalizations, bankruptcies, and liquidations Managers employing such a strategy capitalize on valuation inconsistencies in the market before or after such events, and take a position based on the predicted movement of the security or securities in question Large institutional investors such as hedge funds are more likely to pursue event-driven investing strategies than traditional equity investors because they have the expertise and resources to analyze corporate transactional events for investment opportunities [71] [78] [79]\n\n\nRelative value\nRelative value arbitrage strategies take advantage of relative discrepancies in price between securities The price discrepancy can occur due to mispricing of securities compared to related securities, the underlying security or the market overall Hedge fund managers can use various types of analysis to identify price discrepancies in securities, including mathematical, technical, or fundamental techniques [82] Relative value is often used as a synonym for market neutral, as strategies in this category typically have very little or no directional market exposure to the market as a whole [83] Other relative value sub-strategies include:\n\n\nMiscellaneous\nIn addition to those strategies within the four main categories, there are several strategies that do not entirely fit into these categories.\n\n\nRisk\nFor an investor who already holds large quantities of equities and bonds, investment in hedge funds may provide diversification and reduce the overall portfolio risk [84] Managers of hedge funds often aim to produce returns that are relatively uncorrelated with market indices and are consistent with investors' desired level of risk [85] [86] While hedging can reduce some risks of an investment it usually increases others, such as operational risk and model risk, so overall risk is reduced but cannot be eliminated According to a report by the Hennessee Group, hedge funds were approximately one-third less volatile than the S&P 500 between 1993 and 2010 [87]\n\n\nRisk management\nInvestors in hedge funds are, in most countries, required to be qualified investors who are assumed to be aware of the investment risks, and accept these risks because of the potential returns relative to those risks Fund managers may employ extensive risk management strategies in order to protect the fund and investors According to the Financial Times, \"big hedge funds have some of the most sophisticated and exacting risk management practices anywhere in asset management.\" [85] Hedge fund managers that hold a large number of investment positions for short periods are likely to have a particularly comprehensive risk management system in place, and it has become usual for funds to have independent risk officers who assess and manage risks but are not otherwise involved in trading [88] A variety of different measurement techniques and models are used to estimate risk according to the fund's leverage, liquidity, and investment strategy [86] [89] Non-normality of returns, volatility clustering and trends are not always accounted for by conventional risk measurement methodologies and so in addition to value at risk and similar measurements, funds may use integrated measures such as drawdowns [90]\n\n\nTransparency, and regulatory considerations\nSince hedge funds are private entities and have few public disclosure requirements, this is sometimes perceived as a lack of transparency [92] Another common perception of hedge funds is that their managers are not subject to as much regulatory oversight and/or registration requirements as other financial investment managers, and more prone to manager-specific idiosyncratic risks such as style drifts, faulty operations, or fraud [93] New regulations introduced in the US and the EU as of 2010 required hedge fund managers to report more information, leading to greater transparency [94] In addition, investors, particularly institutional investors, are encouraging further developments in hedge fund risk management, both through internal practices and external regulatory requirements [85] The increasing influence of institutional investors has led to greater transparency: hedge funds increasingly provide information to investors including valuation methodology, positions, and leverage exposure [95]\n\n\nRisks shared with other investment types\nHedge funds share many of the same types of risk as other investment classes, including liquidity risk and manager risk [93] Liquidity refers to the degree to which an asset can be bought and sold or converted to cash; similar to private-equity funds, hedge funds employ a lock-up period during which an investor cannot remove money [70] [96] Manager risk refers to those risks which arise from the management of funds As well as specific risks such as style drift, which refers to a fund manager \"drifting\" away from an area of specific expertise, manager risk factors include valuation risk, capacity risk, concentration risk, and leverage risk [92] Valuation risk refers to the concern that the net asset value (NAV) of investments may be inaccurate; [97] capacity risk can arise from placing too much money into one particular strategy, which may lead to fund performance deterioration; [98] and concentration risk may arise if a fund has too much exposure to a particular investment, sector, trading strategy, or group of correlated funds [99] These risks may be managed through defined controls over conflict of interest, [97] restrictions on allocation of funds, [98] and set exposure limits for strategies [99]\n\n\nFees and remuneration\nHedge fund management firms typically charge their funds both a management fee and a performance fee.\n\n\nFees paid to hedge funds\nHedge fund management firms typically charge their funds both a management fee and a performance fee.\n\n\nRemuneration of portfolio managers\nHedge fund management firms are often owned by their portfolio managers, who are therefore entitled to any profits that the business makes As management fees are intended to cover the firm's operating costs, performance fees (and any excess management fees) are generally distributed to the firm's owners as profits Funds do not tend to report compensation, and so published lists of the amounts earned by top managers tend to be estimates based on factors such as the fees charged by their funds and the capital they are thought to have invested in them [113] Many managers have accumulated large stakes in their own funds and so top hedge fund managers can earn extraordinary amounts of money, perhaps up to $4 billion in a good year [114] [115]\n\n\nStructure\nA hedge fund is an investment vehicle that is most often structured as an offshore corporation, limited partnership, or limited liability company [128] The fund is managed by an investment manager in the form of an organization or company that is legally and financially distinct from the hedge fund and its portfolio of assets [129] [130] Many investment managers utilize service providers for operational support [131] Service providers include prime brokers, banks, administrators, distributors, and accounting firms.\n\n\nPrime broker\nPrime brokers clear trades and provide leverage and short-term financing [132] [133] They are usually divisions of large investment banks [134] The prime broker acts as a counterparty to derivative contracts, and lends securities for particular investment strategies, such as long/short equities and convertible bond arbitrage [135] [136] It can provide custodial services for the fund's assets, and trade execution and clearing services for the hedge fund manager [137]\n\n\nAdministrator\nHedge fund administrators are typically responsible for valuation services, and often operations, and accounting.\n\n\nAuditor\nAn auditor is an independent accounting firm used to perform a complete audit the fund's financial statements The year-end audit is performed in accordance with the standard accounting practices enforced within the country in which the fund it established, typically US GAAP or the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) [147] The auditor may verify the fund's NAV and assets under management (AUM) [148] [149] Some auditors only provide \"NAV lite\" services, meaning that the valuation is based on prices received from the manager rather than an independent assessment [150]\n\n\nDistributor\nA distributor is an underwriter, broker, dealer, or other person who participates in the distribution of securities [151] The distributor is also responsible for marketing the fund to potential investors Many hedge funds do not have distributors, and in such cases, the investment manager will be responsible for the distribution of securities and marketing, though many funds also use placement agents and broker-dealers for distribution [152] [153]\n\n\nDomicile and taxation\nThe legal structure of a specific hedge fund, in particular its domicile and the type of legal entity in use, is usually determined by the tax expectations of the fund's investors Regulatory considerations will also play a role Many hedge funds are established in offshore financial centers to avoid adverse tax consequences for its foreign and tax-exempt investors [154] [155] Offshore funds that invest in the US typically pay withholding taxes on certain types of investment income, but not US capital gains tax However, the fund's investors are subject to tax in their own jurisdictions on any increase in the value of their investments [156] [157] This tax treatment promotes cross-border investments by limiting the potential for multiple jurisdictions to layer taxes on investors [158]\n\n\nBasket options\nDeutsche Bank and Barclays created special options accounts for hedge fund clients in the banks' names and claimed to own the assets, when in fact the hedge fund clients had full control of the assets and reaped the profits The hedge funds would then execute trades ‚Äì many of them a few seconds in duration ‚Äì but wait until just after a year had passed to exercise the options, allowing them to report the profits at a lower long-term capital gains tax rate.\n\nInvestment manager locations\nIn contrast to the funds themselves, investment managers are primarily located onshore The United States remains the largest center of investment with US-based funds managing around 70% of global assets at the end of 2011 [160] As of April 2012, there were approximately 3,990 investment advisers managing one or more private hedge funds registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission [164] New York City and the Gold Coast area of Connecticut are the leading locations for US hedge fund managers [165] [166]\n\n\nLegal entity\nHedge fund legal structures vary depending on location and the investor(s) US hedge funds aimed at US-based, taxable investors are generally structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies Limited partnerships and other flow-through taxation structures assure that investors in hedge funds are not subject to both entity-level and personal-level taxation [137] A hedge fund structured as a limited partnership must have a general partner The general partner may be an individual or a corporation The general partner serves as the manager of the limited partnership, and has unlimited liability [132] [175] The limited partners serve as the fund's investors, and have no responsibility for management or investment decisions Their liability is limited to the amount of money they invest for partnership interests [175] [176] As an alternative to a limited partnership arrangement, U.S domestic hedge funds may be structured as limited liability companies, with members acting as corporate shareholders and enjoying protection from individual liability [177]\n\n\nTypes of funds\nA side pocket is a mechanism whereby a fund compartmentalizes assets that are relatively illiquid or difficult to value reliably [185] When an investment is side-pocketed, its value is calculated separately from the value of the fund's main portfolio [186] Because side pockets are used to hold illiquid investments, investors do not have the standard redemption rights with respect to the side pocket investment that they do with respect to the fund's main portfolio [186] Profits or losses from the investment are allocated on a pro rata basis only to those who are investors at the time the investment is placed into the side pocket and are not shared with new investors [186] [187] Funds typically carry side pocket assets \"at cost\" for purposes of calculating management fees and reporting net asset values This allows fund managers to avoid attempting a valuation of the underlying investments, which may not always have a readily available market value [187]\n\n\nSide pockets\nA side pocket is a mechanism whereby a fund compartmentalizes assets that are relatively illiquid or difficult to

carry side pocket assets \"at cost\" for purposes of calculating management fees and reporting net asset values This allows fund managers to avoid attempting a valuation of the underlying investments, which may not always have a readily available market value [187]\n\n\nRegulation\nHedge funds must abide by the national, federal, and state regulatory laws in their respective locations The U.S regulations and restrictions that apply to hedge funds differ from those that apply to its mutual funds [191] Mutual funds, unlike hedge funds and other private funds, are subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940, which is a highly detailed and extensive regulatory regime [192] According to a report by the International Organization of Securities Commissions, the most common form of regulation pertains to restrictions on financial advisers and hedge fund managers in an effort to minimize client fraud On the other hand, U.S hedge funds are exempt from many of the standard registration and reporting requirements because they only accept accredited investors [70] In 2010, regulations were enacted in the US and European Union which introduced additional hedge fund reporting requirements These included the U.S.'s Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act [4] and European Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive [193]\n\n\nUnited States\nHedge funds within the US are subject to regulatory, reporting, and record-keeping requirements [197] Many hedge funds also fall under the jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and are subject to rules and provisions of the 1922 Commodity Exchange Act, which prohibits fraud and manipulation [198] The Securities Act of 1933 required companies to file a registration statement with the SEC to comply with its private placement rules before offering their securities to the public, [199] and most traditional hedge funds in the United States are offered effectively as private placement offerings [200] The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 required a fund with more than 499 investors to register with the SEC [201] [202] [203] The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 contained anti-fraud provisions that regulated hedge fund managers and advisers, created limits for the number and types of investors, and prohibited public offerings The Act also exempted hedge funds from mandatory registration with the SEC [70] [204] [205] when selling to accredited investors with a minimum of US$5¬†million in investment assets Companies and institutional investors with at least US$25¬†million in investment assets also qualified [206]\n\n\nEurope\nWithin the European Union (EU), hedge funds are primarily regulated through their managers [70] In the United Kingdom, where 80% of Europe's hedge funds are based, [220] hedge fund managers are required to be authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) [193] Each country has its own specific restrictions on hedge fund activities, including controls on use of derivatives in Portugal, and limits on leverage in France [70]\n\n\nOffshore\nSome hedge funds are established in offshore centres, such as the Cayman Islands, Dublin, Luxembourg, Singapore [224] the British Virgin Islands, and Bermuda, which have different regulations [225] concerning non-accredited investors, client confidentiality, and fund manager independence [4] [193]\n\n\nSouth Africa\nIn South Africa, investment fund managers must be approved by, and register with, the Financial Services Board (FSB) [226]\n\n\nPerformance\nPerformance statistics for individual hedge funds are difficult to obtain, as the funds have historically not been required to report their performance to a central repository, and restrictions against public offerings and advertisement have led many managers to refuse to provide performance information publicly However, summaries of individual hedge fund performance are occasionally available in industry journals [227] [228] and databases [229]\n\n\nMeasurement\nPerformance statistics for individual hedge funds are difficult to obtain, as the funds have historically not been required to report their performance to a central repository, and restrictions against public offerings and advertisement have led many managers to refuse to provide performance information publicly However, summaries of individual hedge fund performance are occasionally available in industry journals [227] [228] and databases [229]\n\n\nSector-size effect\nThere is a debate over whether alpha (the manager's skill element in performance) has been diluted by the expansion of the hedge fund industry Two reasons are given First, the increase in traded volume may have been reducing the market anomalies that are a source of hedge fund performance Second, the remuneration model is attracting more managers, which may dilute the talent available in the industry [241] [242]\n\n\nHedge fund indices\nIndices play a central and unambiguous role in traditional asset markets, where they are widely accepted as representative of their underlying portfolios Equity and debt index fund products provide investable access to most developed markets in these asset classes.\n\n\nNon-investable indices\nNon-investable indices are indicative in nature and aim to represent the performance of some database of hedge funds using some measure such as mean, median, or weighted mean from a hedge fund database The databases have diverse selection criteria and methods of construction, and no single database captures all funds This leads to significant differences in reported performance between different indices.\n\n\nInvestable indices\nInvestable indices are an attempt to reduce these problems by ensuring that the return of the index is available to shareholders To create an investable index, the index provider selects funds and develops structured products or derivative instruments that deliver the performance of the index When investors buy these products the index provider makes the investments in the underlying funds, making an investable index similar in some ways to a fund of hedge funds portfolio.\n\n\nHedge fund replication\nThe most recent addition to the field approaches the problem in a different manner Instead of reflecting the performance of actual hedge funds, they take a statistical approach to the analysis of historic hedge fund returns and use this to construct a model of how hedge fund returns respond to the movements of various investable financial assets This model is then used to construct an investable portfolio of those assets This makes the index investable, and in principle, they can be as representative as the hedge fund database from which they were constructed However, these clone indices rely on a statistical modelling process Such indices have too short a history to state whether this approach will be considered successful.\n\n\nClosures\nIn March 2017, HFR ‚Äì a hedge fund research data and service provider ‚Äì reported that there were more hedge-fund closures in 2016 than during the 2009 recession According to the report, several large public pension funds pulled their investments in hedge funds, because the funds' subpar performance as a group did not merit the high fees they charged.\n\n\nDebates and controversies\nSystemic risk refers to the risk of instability across the entire financial system, as opposed to within a single company Such risk may arise following a destabilizing event or events affecting a group of financial institutions linked through investment activity [244] Organizations such as the European Central Bank have charged that hedge funds pose systemic risks to the financial sector, [245] [246] and following the failure of hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) in 1998 there was widespread concern about the potential for systemic risk if a hedge fund failure led to the failure of its counterparties (As it happens, no financial assistance was provided to LTCM by the US Federal Reserve, so there was no direct cost to US taxpayers, [247] but a large bailout had to be mounted by a number of financial institutions.)\n\n\nSystemic risk\nSystemic risk refers to the risk of instability across the entire financial system, as opposed to within a single company Such risk may arise following a

taxpayers, [247] but a large bailout had to be mounted by a number of financial institutions.)\n\n\nTransparency\nHedge funds are structured to avoid most direct regulation (although their managers may be regulated), and are not required to publicly disclose their investment activities, except to the extent that investors generally are subject to disclosure requirements This is in contrast to a regulated mutual fund or exchange-traded fund, which will typically have to meet regulatory requirements for disclosure An investor in a hedge fund usually has direct access to the investment adviser of the fund, and may enjoy more personalized reporting than investors in retail investment funds This may include detailed discussions of risks assumed and significant positions However, this high level of disclosure is not available to non-investors, contributing to hedge funds' reputation for secrecy, while some hedge funds have very limited transparency even to investors [255]\n\n\nLinks with analysts\nIn June 2006, prompted by a letter from Gary J Aguirre, the U.S Senate Judiciary Committee began an investigation into the links between hedge funds and independent analysts Aguirre was fired from his job with the SEC when, as lead investigator of insider trading allegations against Pequot Capital Management, he tried to interview John Mack, then being considered for chief executive officer at Morgan Stanley [274] The Judiciary Committee and the US Senate Finance Committee issued a scathing report in 2007, which found that Aguirre had been illegally fired in reprisal [275] for his pursuit of Mack, and in 2009 the SEC was forced to re-open its case against Pequot Pequot settled with the SEC for US$28¬†million, and Arthur J Samberg, chief investment officer of Pequot, was barred from working as an investment advisor [276] Pequot closed its doors under the pressure of investigations [277]\n\n\nValue in a mean/variance efficient portfolio\nAccording to modern portfolio theory, rational investors will seek to hold portfolios that are mean/variance efficient (that is, portfolios that offer the highest level of return per unit of risk) One of the attractive features of hedge funds (in particular market neutral and similar funds) is that they sometimes have a modest correlation with traditional assets such as equities This means that hedge funds have a potentially quite valuable role in investment portfolios as diversifiers, reducing overall portfolio risk [109]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

estimated ¬£58¬†million transfer fee The deal also saw him stay at Dortmund on loan for the remainder of the 2018‚Äì19 season [51] This transfer made Pulisic the most expensive American player and Borussia Dortmund's second most expensive sale of all time, behind Ousmane Demb√©l√© [52] Upon his arrival in the summer, he spoke of his desire to replicate the form shown by Eden Hazard and described the forward as a soccer idol [53] [54]\n\n\n2019‚Äì20: Debut season and Premier League breakthrough\nOn August 11, 2019, Pulisic made his Premier League debut for Chelsea in a 4‚Äì0 defeat

teammates Th√©o Hernandez and Tammy Abraham, both of whom missed their penalties After the match, Paulo Fonseca was angered by his teammate's actions and cemented Pulisic as the Milan penalty taker - ‚ÄúOf course I am upset Christian should take penalties It must never happen again, and I told the players.‚Äù [124] [125] Pulisic was the first top-5 League player of the season to contribute to a

Columbus, Ohio, as an 81st-minute substitute for Graham Zusi He thus became the youngest American to play in a World Cup qualifier [135]\n\n\n2021‚Äìpresent: CONCACAF triumphs and World Cup debut\nOn June 6, 2021, Pulisic captained the United States national team to a 3‚Äì2 victory in the first-ever CONCACAF Nations League final against Mexico, scoring the winning goal by converting a penalty in the 114th minute [144]\n\n\nPlayer profile\nFollowing his promotion to the Dortmund first team, FourFourTwo writer Andy Mitten wrote that the Dortmund manager Thomas Tuchel \"saw the potential ‚Äì the speed, sharpness, strength, sublime fitness and mature decision-making that belied his age\" [154] Tuchel called Pulisic \"the kind of guy who's very self-confident, shows his talent on the pitch, and doesn't show any nerves under pressure ‚Äì which is a wonderful combination\" [154] Pulisic's Dortmund teammate Nuri ≈ûahin said, \"He's fearless  [...] He has so much speed, but what I like most is his first touch When he gets the ball, his first touch opens up a huge space for him even if there's no space.\" [154] Since the 2018‚Äì19 season, Pulisic was most often deployed on the wing for Dortmund, and this continued at Chelsea and AC Milan, although towards the end of the 2023-24 Serie A season he found himself deployed more regularly in central areas Because of his style of play, Pulisic is often subjected to fouls by opponents [155]\n\n\nStyle of play\nFollowing his promotion to the Dortmund first team, FourFourTwo writer Andy Mitten wrote that the Dortmund manager Thomas Tuchel \"saw the potential ‚Äì the speed, sharpness, strength, sublime fitness and mature decision-making that belied his age\" [154] Tuchel called Pulisic \"the kind of guy who's very self-confident,

Because of his style of play, Pulisic is often subjected to fouls by opponents [155]\n\n\nReception\nWidely regarded as being one of the two best active North American players with Alphonso Davies, Pulisic since a young age has been compared with U.S national team legends Landon Donovan and Clint Dempsey over being the greatest American player of all time [160] [161] [162] [163] In his early club seasons with Borussia Dortmund he was regarded as one of the world's best young players, being listed as a finalist of the 2017 Golden Boy award and runner-up of the 2018 Kopa Trophy to Kylian Mbapp√©; presented to the world's best player under the age of 21 [164] [165] [166] During his time with Chelsea he was criticized for being heavily injury-prone, having missed 53 club games from a series of injuries spanning 4 seasons [167] Following his move to AC Milan, Pulisic rebounded his club form and has been widely regarded as one of the best players in the Serie A, being praised as one of Milan‚Äôs most crucial players [118] [115] [168]\n\n\nPersonal life\nBoth the anglicized pronunciation (IPA: /p…ôÀàl…™s…™k/) and the original Croatian pronunciation (IPA: /Ààp äl…™ É…™t É/) have

such as the League of Nations in 1920, the United Nations (UN) in 1945, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949, along with international regimes such as the Bretton Woods system and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), implemented to maintain a cooperative balance of power and facilitate reconciliation between nations to prevent the prospect of another global

liberal internationalism were regularly criticized and opposed by American paleoconservative business nationalists from the 1930s on [11] [need quotation to verify]\n\n\nUsage as reference to a conspiracy (Cold War era)\nDuring the Second Red Scare, both secular and Christian right American agitators, largely influenced by the work of Canadian conspiracy theorist William Guy Carr, increasingly embraced and spread dubious fears of Freemasons, Illuminati and Jews as the alleged driving forces behind an \"international communist conspiracy\" The threat of \"Godless communism\", in the form of an atheistic, bureaucratic collectivist world government, demonized as the \"Red Menace\", became the focus of apocalyptic millenarian conspiracism The Red Scare came to shape one of the core ideas of the political right in the United States, which is that liberals and progressives, with their welfare-state policies and international cooperation programs such as foreign aid, supposedly contribute to a gradual process of global collectivism that will inevitably lead to nations being replaced with a communistic/collectivist one-world government [15] James Warburg, appearing before the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in 1950, famously stated: \"We shall have world government, whether or not we like it The question is only whether world government will be achieved by consent or by conquest.\" [16]\n\n\nPost-Cold War usage\nAmerican televangelist Pat Robertson, with his best-selling book The New World Order (1991), became the most prominent Christian disseminator of conspiracy theories about recent American history He describes a scenario where Wall Street, the Federal Reserve System, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Bilderberg Group and the Trilateral Commission control the flow of events from behind the scenes, constantly nudging people covertly in the direction of world government for the Antichrist [6]\n\n\nConspiracy theories\nThere are numerous systemic conspiracy theories through which the concept of a New World Order is viewed The following is a list of the major ones in roughly chronological order: [27]\n\n\nEnd time\nSince the 19th century, many apocalyptic millennial Christian eschatologists, starting with John Nelson Darby, have predicted a globalist conspiracy to impose a tyrannical New World Order governing structure as the fulfillment of prophecies about the \"end time\" in the Bible, specifically in the Book of Ezekiel, the Book of Daniel, the Olivet Discourse found in the Synoptic Gospels, 2 Esdras 11:32 and Revelation 13:7 [28] They claim that people who have made a deal with the Devil to gain wealth and power have become pawns in a supernatural chess game to move humanity into accepting a utopian world government that rests on the spiritual foundations of a syncretic-messianic world religion, which will later reveal itself to be a dystopian world empire that imposes the imperial cult of an \"Unholy Trinity\" of Satan, the Antichrist and the False Prophet [citation needed] In many contemporary Christian conspiracy theories, the False Prophet will be either the last pope of the Catholic Church (groomed and installed by an Alta Vendita or Jesuit conspiracy), a guru from the New Age movement, or even the leader of an elite fundamentalist Christian organization like the Fellowship, while the Antichrist will be either the President of the European Union, the Caliph of a pan-Islamic state, or even the Secretary-General of the United Nations [6] [28]\n\n\nFreemasonry\nFreemasonry is one of the world's oldest secular fraternal organizations and arose in Great Britain during the 18th century  Over the years, several allegations and conspiracy theories have been directed towards Freemasonry, including the allegation that Freemasons have a hidden political agenda and are conspiring to bring about a New World Order, a world government organized according to Masonic principles or governed only by Freemasons [15]\n\n\nIlluminati\nThe Order of the Illuminati was an Enlightenment-age secret society founded by university professor Adam Weishaupt on 1 May 1776, in Upper Bavaria, Germany The movement consisted of advocates of freethought, secularism, liberalism, republicanism, and gender equality, recruited from the German Masonic Lodges, who sought to teach rationalism through mystery schools In 1785, the order was infiltrated, broken up, and suppressed by the government agents of Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria, in his preemptive campaign to neutralize the threat of secret societies ever becoming hotbeds of conspiracies to overthrow the Bavarian monarchy and its state religion, Roman Catholicism [40] There is no evidence that the Bavarian Illuminati survived its suppression in 1785 [41]\n\n\nThe Protocols of the Elders of Zion\nThe Protocols of the Elders of Zion is an antisemitic canard, originally published in Russian in 1903, alleging a Judeo-Masonic conspiracy to achieve world domination The text purports to be the minutes of the secret meetings of a cabal of Jewish masterminds, which has co-opted Freemasonry and is plotting to rule the world on behalf of all Jews because they believe themselves to be the chosen people of God [45] The Protocols incorporate many of the core conspiracist themes outlined in the Robison and Barruel attacks on the Freemasons and overlay them with antisemitic allegations about anti-Tsarist movements in Russia The Protocols reflect themes similar to more general critiques of Enlightenment liberalism by conservative aristocrats who support monarchies and state religions The interpretation intended by the publication of The Protocols is that if one peels away the layers of the Masonic conspiracy, past the Illuminati, one finds the rotten Jewish core [15]\n\n\nRound table\nDuring the second half of Britain's \"imperial century\" between 1815 and 1914, English-born South African businessman, mining magnate, and politician Cecil Rhodes advocated the British Empire reannexing the United States of America and reforming itself into an \"Imperial Federation\" to bring about a hyperpower and lasting world peace In his first will, written in 1877 at the age of 23, he expressed his wish to fund a secret society (known as the Society of the Elect) that would advance this goal:\n\n\nThe Open Conspiracy\nIn his 1928 book The Open Conspiracy British writer and futurist H G Wells promoted cosmopolitanism and offered blueprints for a world revolution and World Brain to establish a technocratic world state and planned economy [60] Wells warned, however, in his 1940 book The New World Order that:\n\n\nNew Age\nBritish neo-Theosophical occultist Alice Bailey, one of the founders of the so-called New Age movement, prophesied in 1940 the eventual victory of the Allies of World War II over the Axis powers (which occurred in 1945) and the establishment by the Allies of a political and religious New World Order She saw a federal world government as the culmination of Wells' Open Conspiracy but favorably argued that it would be synarchist because it was guided by the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom, intent on preparing humanity for the mystical second coming of Christ, and the dawning of the Age of Aquarius According to Bailey, a group of ascended masters called the Great White Brotherhood works on the \"inner planes\" to oversee the transition to the New World Order but, for now, the members of this Spiritual Hierarchy are only known to a few occult scientists, with whom they communicate telepathically, but as the need for their personal involvement in the plan increases, there will be an \"Externalization of the Hierarchy\" and everyone will know of their presence on Earth [62]\n\n\nFourth Reich\nConspiracy theorists often use the term \"Fourth Reich\" simply as a pejorative synonym for the \"New World Order\" to imply that its state ideology and government will be similar to Germany's Third Reich [citation needed]\n\n\nAlien invasion\nSince the late 1970s, extraterrestrials from other habitable planets or parallel dimensions (such as \"Greys\") and intraterrestrials from Hollow Earth (such as \"Reptilians\") have been included in the New World Order conspiracy, in more or less dominant roles, as in the theories put forward by American writers Stan Deyo and Milton William Cooper, and British writer David Icke [6]\n\n\nBrave New World\nAntiscience and neo-Luddite conspiracy theorists emphasize technology forecasting in their New World Order conspiracy theories They speculate that the global power elite are reactionary modernists pursuing a transhumanist plan to develop and use human enhancement technologies to become a \"posthuman ruling caste\", while change accelerates toward a technological singularity‚Äîa theorized future point of discontinuity when events will accelerate at such a pace that normal unenhanced humans will be unable to predict or even understand the rapid changes occurring in the world around them Conspiracy theorists fear the outcome will either be the emergence of a Brave New World-like dystopia‚Äîa \"Brave New World Order\"‚Äîor the extinction of the human species [68]\n\n\nPostulated implementations\nJust as there are several overlapping or conflicting theories among conspiracists about the nature of the New World Order, so are there several beliefs about how its architects and planners will implement it:\n\n\nGradualism\nConspiracy theorists generally speculate that the New World Order is being implemented gradually, citing the formation of the U.S Federal Reserve System in 1913; the League of Nations in 1919; the International Monetary Fund in 1944; the United Nations in 1945; the World Bank in 1945; the World Health Organization in 1948; the European Union and the Euro in 1993; the World Trade Organization in 1998; the African Union in 2002, and the Union of South American Nations in 2008 as major milestones [6]\n\n\nCoup d'√©tat\nAmerican right-wing populist conspiracy theorists, especially those who joined the militia movement in the United States, speculate that the New World Order will be implemented through a dramatic coup d'√©tat by a \"secret team\", using black helicopters, in the U.S and other nation-states to bring about a totalitarian world government controlled by the United Nations and enforced by troops of foreign U.N peacekeepers Following the Rex 84 and Operation Garden Plot plans, this military coup would involve the suspension of the Constitution, the imposition of martial law, and the appointment of military commanders to head state and local governments and to detain dissidents [73]\n\n\nMass surveillance\nConspiracy theorists concerned with surveillance abuse believe that the New World Order is being implemented by the cult of intelligence at the core of the surveillance-industrial complex through mass surveillance and the use of Social Security numbers, the bar-coding of retail goods with Universal Product Code markings, and, most recently, RFID tagging by microchip implants [6]\n\n\nOccultism\nConspiracy theorists of the Christian right, starting with British revisionist historian Nesta Helen Webster, believe there is an ancient occult conspiracy‚Äîstarted by the first mystagogues of Gnosticism and perpetuated by their alleged esoteric successors, such as the Kabbalists, Cathars, Knights Templar, Hermeticists, Rosicrucians, Freemasons, and, ultimately, the Illuminati‚Äîwhich seeks to subvert the Judeo-Christian foundations of the Western world and implement the New World Order through a one-world religion that prepares the masses to embrace the imperial cult of the Antichrist [6] More broadly, they speculate that globalists who plot on behalf of a New World Order are directed by occult agencies of some sort: unknown superiors, spiritual hierarchies, demons, fallen angels or Lucifer They believe that these conspirators use the power of occult sciences (numerology), symbols (Eye of Providence), rituals (Masonic degrees), monuments (National Mall landmarks), buildings (Manitoba Legislative Building [83]) and facilities (Denver International Airport) to advance their plot to rule the world [6] [84]\n\n\nPopulation control\nConspiracy theorists believe that the New World Order will also be implemented through human population control to more easily monitor and control the movement of individuals [6] The means range from stopping the growth of human societies through reproductive health and family planning programs, which promote abstinence, contraception and abortion, or intentionally reducing the bulk of the world population through genocides by mongering unnecessary wars, through plagues by engineering emergent viruses and tainting vaccines, and through environmental disasters by controlling the weather (HAARP, chemtrails), etc Conspiracy theorists argue that globalists plotting on behalf of a New World Order are neo-Malthusians who engage in overpopulation and climate change alarmism to create public support for coercive population control and ultimately world government United Nations Agenda 21 is condemned as \"reconcentrating\" people into urban areas and depopulating rural ones, even generating a dystopian novel by Glenn Beck where single-family homes are a distant memory.\n\n\nMind control\nSocial critics accuse governments, corporations, and the mass media of being involved in the manufacturing of a national consensus and, paradoxically, a culture of fear due to the potential for increased social control that a mistrustful and mutually fearing population might offer to those in power The worst fear of some conspiracy theorists, however, is that the New World Order will be implemented through the use of mind control‚Äîa broad range of tactics able to subvert an individual's control of their own thinking, behavior, emotions, or decisions These tactics are said to include everything from Manchurian candidate-style brainwashing of sleeper agents (Project MKULTRA, \"Project Monarch\") to engineering psychological operations (water fluoridation, subliminal advertising, \"Silent Sound Spread Spectrum\", MEDUSA) and parapsychological operations (Stargate Project) to influence the masses [89] The concept of wearing a tin foil hat for protection from such threats has become a popular stereotype and term of derision; the phrase serves as a byword for paranoia and is associated with conspiracy theorists.\n\n\nAlleged conspirators\nAccording to Domhoff, many people seem to believe that the United States is ruled from behind the scenes by a conspiratorial elite with secret desires, i.e., by a small, secretive group that wants to change the government system or put the country under the control of a world government In the past, the conspirators were usually said to be crypto-communists who were intent upon bringing the United States under a common world government with the Soviet Union, but the dissolution of the USSR in 1991 undercut that theory Domhoff notes that most conspiracy theorists changed their focus to the United Nations as the likely controlling force in a New World Order, an idea which is undermined by the powerlessness of the U.N and the unwillingness of even moderates within the American Establishment to give it anything but a limited role [59]\n\n\nCriticism\nSkeptics of New World Order conspiracy theories accuse its proponents of indulging in the furtive fallacy, a belief that significant facts of history are necessarily sinister; conspiracism, a world view that centrally places conspiracy theories in the unfolding of history, rather than social and economic forces; and fusion paranoia, a promiscuous absorption of fears from any source whatsoever [6]\n\n\nSee also\nThe following is a list of non-self-published non-fiction books that discuss New World Order conspiracy theories.\n\n\nReferences\nThe following is a list of

secretive and powerful group of individuals or organizations working to create a one-world government that would control all of humanity. This concept has been debated and discussed for centuries, with various interpretations and interpretations of its meaning and significance.\n\n**History of the Term**\n\nThe term \"New World Order\" has been used in different contexts throughout history. During the 20th century, political figures such as Woodrow Wilson and Winston Churchill used the term to refer to a new period of history characterized by a dramatic change in world political thought and in the global balance of power after World War I and World War II. The interwar and post-World War II period were seen as opportunities to implement idealistic proposals for global governance by collective efforts to address worldwide problems that go beyond the capacity of individual nation-states to resolve, while nevertheless respecting the right of nations to self-determination.\n\n**General Usage (Pre-Cold War)**\n\nDuring the 20th century, the term \"New World Order\" was used to refer to a new period of history characterized by a dramatic change in world political thought and in the global balance of power after World War I and World War II.

He describes a scenario where Wall Street, the Federal Reserve System, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Bilderberg Group, and the Trilateral Commission control the flow of events from behind the scenes, constantly nudging people covertly in the direction of world government for the Antichrist.\n\n**Conspiracy Theories**\n\nThere are numerous systemic conspiracy theories through which the concept of a New World Order is viewed. The following is a list of the major ones in roughly chronological order:\n\n**End Time**\n\nSince the 19th century, many apocalyptic millennial Christian eschatologists, starting with John Nelson Darby, have predicted a globalist conspiracy to impose a tyrannical New World Order governing structure as the fulfillment of prophecies about the \"end time\" in the Bible, specifically in the Book of Ezekiel, the Book of Daniel, the Olivet Discourse found in the Synoptic Gospels, 2 Esdras 11:32, and Revelation 13:7.\n\n**Freemasonry**\n\nFreemasonry is one of the world's oldest secular fraternal organizations and arose in Great Britain during the 18th century.

global collectivism that will inevitably lead to nations being replaced with a communistic/collectivist one-world government [15] James Warburg, appearing before the United States Senate Committee on

the Christian right, starting with British revisionist historian Nesta Helen Webster, believe there is an ancient occult conspiracy‚Äîstarted by the first mystagogues of Gnosticism and perpetuated by their alleged esoteric successors, such as the Kabbalists, Cathars, Knights Templar, Hermeticists, Rosicrucians, Freemasons, and, ultimately, the Illuminati‚Äîwhich seeks to subvert the Judeo-Christian foundations of the Western world and implement the New World Order through a one-world religion that prepares the masses to embrace the imperial cult of the Antichrist [6] More broadly, they speculate that globalists who plot on behalf of a New World Order are directed by occult agencies of some sort: unknown superiors, spiritual hierarchies, demons, fallen angels or Lucifer They believe that these conspirators use the power of occult sciences (numerology), symbols (Eye of Providence), rituals (Masonic degrees), monuments (National Mall landmarks), buildings (Manitoba Legislative Building [83]) and facilities (Denver International Airport) to advance their plot to rule the world [6] [84]\n\n\nPopulation control\nConspiracy theorists believe that the New World Order will also be implemented through human population control to more easily monitor and control the movement of individuals [6] The means range from stopping the growth of human societies through reproductive health and family planning programs, which promote abstinence, contraception and abortion, or intentionally reducing the bulk of the world population through genocides by mongering unnecessary wars, through plagues by engineering emergent viruses and tainting vaccines, and through environmental disasters by controlling the weather (HAARP, chemtrails), etc Conspiracy theorists argue that globalists plotting on behalf of a New World Order are neo-Malthusians who engage in overpopulation and climate change alarmism to create public support for coercive population control and ultimately world government United Nations Agenda 21 is condemned as \"reconcentrating\" people into urban areas and depopulating rural ones, even generating a dystopian novel by Glenn Beck where single-family homes are a distant memory.\n\n\nMind control\nSocial critics accuse governments, corporations, and the mass media of being involved in the manufacturing of a national consensus and, paradoxically, a culture of fear due to the potential for increased social control that a mistrustful and mutually fearing population might offer to those in power The worst fear of some conspiracy theorists, however, is that the New World Order will be implemented through the use of mind control‚Äîa broad range of tactics able to subvert an individual's control of their own thinking, behavior, emotions, or decisions These tactics are said to include everything from Manchurian candidate-style brainwashing of sleeper agents (Project MKULTRA, \"Project Monarch\") to engineering psychological operations (water fluoridation, subliminal advertising, \"Silent Sound Spread Spectrum\", MEDUSA) and parapsychological operations (Stargate Project) to influence the masses [89] The concept of wearing a tin foil hat for protection from such threats has become a popular stereotype and term of derision; the phrase serves as a byword for paranoia and is associated with conspiracy theorists.\n\n\nAlleged conspirators\nAccording to Domhoff, many people seem to believe that the United States is ruled from behind the scenes by a conspiratorial elite with secret desires, i.e., by a small, secretive group that wants to change the government system or put the country under the control of a world government In the past, the conspirators were usually said to be crypto-communists who were intent upon bringing the United States under a common world government with the Soviet Union, but the dissolution of the USSR in 1991 undercut that theory Domhoff notes that most conspiracy theorists changed their focus to the United Nations as the likely controlling force in a New World Order, an idea which is undermined by the powerlessness of the U.N and the unwillingness of even moderates within the American Establishment to give it anything but a limited role [59]\n\n\nCriticism\nSkeptics of New World Order conspiracy theories accuse its proponents of indulging in the furtive fallacy, a belief that significant facts of history are necessarily sinister; conspiracism, a world view that centrally places conspiracy theories in the unfolding of history, rather than social and economic forces; and fusion paranoia, a promiscuous absorption of fears from any source whatsoever [6]\n\n\nSee also\nThe following is a list of non-self-published non-fiction books that

Macron threatened to block a major trade deal between the European Union and Brazil (Mercosur) that would benefit the agricultural interests accused of driving deforestation. Soon after, Germany and the United Kingdom criticized the threat.\n\n**Summit Organization**\n\nThe annual G7 summit is attended by each member's head of government. The member country holding the G7 presidency is responsible for organizing and hosting the year's summit. The serial annual summits can be parsed chronologically in arguably distinct ways, including as the sequence of host countries for the summits has recurred over time and series.

The film is based on the true story of Operation Mincemeat, a World War II intelligence operation that involved the creation of a fictional character, known as \"Monty,\" to deceive the German military about the Allied invasion of Sicily.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place in 1943, during the height of World War II. Lieutenant Commander Ewen Montagu, a Jewish barrister, is recruited by the British government to join the Twenty Committee, a group of intelligence officers responsible for planning and executing covert operations. Montagu is tasked with leading a team that will create a fictional backstory for a corpse, which will be recovered by the Germans and used to deceive them about the Allied invasion plans.\n\nThe team, which includes Montagu's secretary, Hester Leggett, and other experts, sets out to create a convincing narrative for the corpse, which will be dressed in a Royal Marine uniform and given a backstory that suggests he was a member of the British Royal Family. The team also creates a set of fake documents, including a letter from the King and a newspaper clipping, to support the narrative.\n\nAs the team works to finalize the plan, they are joined by other historical figures, including Alexander Beyer as Karl Kuhlenthal, a German intelligence officer, and Nico Birnbaum as Colonel Alexis von Roenne, a German military officer.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features an all-star cast, including Colin Firth as Lieutenant Commander Ewen Montagu, Kelly Macdonald as Hester Leggett, and Matthew Macfadyen as Ian Fleming, the creator of James Bond.

Kelly Macdonald joined the film in October 2019, and the rest of the cast was announced in December 2019. The film was shot on location in the UK and Spain, and was released in April 2022.\n\n**Historicity**\n\nWhile the main thrust of the film is historically accurate, the filmmakers made some omissions and additions that were not in MacIntyre's book, including the creation of a fictional sub-plot involving a love triangle between Montagu, Cholmondeley, and Leslie. The film also takes some creative liberties with the events of the operation, but overall it is a faithful adaptation of the true story.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe film was released in the UK and Ireland in April 2022, and was later released on Netflix in North and Latin America. The film had a limited release in the US, but it was widely released in the UK and Ireland.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe film has received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising the performances of the cast and the direction of John Madden. The film has a 83% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The film has also been praised for its historical accuracy and its portrayal of the events of the operation.\n\n**Box Office**\n\nThe film has grossed $6,936,873 in the UK and a worldwide total of $15,710,164.

He has been involved in various high-profile incidents, including the 2020 clashes in Washington, D.C. and the 2021 United States Capitol attack.\n\n**Life before Proud Boys**\n\nHenry Tarrio, who later changed his name to Enrique, was born in Miami, Florida, in 1983 or 1984. He was raised Catholic in the neighborhood of Little Havana, where he developed a strong sense of identity and cultural heritage. Tarrio's Cuban heritage and Afro-Cuban identity have played a significant role in shaping his views and experiences.\n\n**Proud Boys**\n\nTarrio's involvement with the Proud Boys began in 2017, when he volunteered at a Miami event for far-right commentator Milo Yiannopoulos. It was there that he encountered a member of the Proud Boys, who encouraged him to join the organization. In August 2017, Tarrio attended the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where he said he was there to protest the removal of Confederate monuments and memorials.\n\nTarrio's involvement with the Proud Boys was marked by his charismatic leadership and his ability to rally support for the organization. He quickly rose through the ranks and became one of the group's top leaders. However, his involvement with the Proud Boys would ultimately lead to his downfall and his conviction for seditious conspiracy.\n\n**December 2020 clashes and 2021 guilty plea**\n\nOn December 12, 2020, Tarrio and the Proud Boys, along with other far-right groups, marched in Washington, D.C. to support Donald Trump's campaign to delegitimize his election loss. The march was marked by violence and vandalism, with over three dozen people arrested and several churches vandalized. Tarrio and the group set fire to a \"Black Lives Matter\" banner they seized from Asbury United Methodist Church, a historic Black church.\n\nThe clashes marked a turning point in Tarrio's involvement with the Proud Boys. He was among a group of Proud Boys and far-right activists who attacked the Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C. that day. The incident drew widespread condemnation and marked a significant escalation of tensions between the Proud Boys and law enforcement.\n\n**Role in the January 6 attack**\n\nBy November 2021, at least two dozen Proud Boys members and affiliates had been indicted for alleged roles in the 2021 United States Capitol attack. Tarrio was among those who were subpoenaed by the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack. In February 2022, under subpoena, Tarrio gave a deposition to committee investigators and two committee members.\n\nThe January 6 attack marked a significant escalation of violence and a major turning point in Tarrio's involvement with the Proud Boys. His role in the attack and his subsequent conviction for seditious conspiracy would ultimately lead to his downfall and his conviction.\n\n**Split within Proud Boys after January 6**\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2021 United States Capitol attack, several chapters of the Proud Boys organization split with the national group. The revelation in late January 2021 that Tarrio had been an informant to federal and local law enforcement between 2012 and 2014 contributed to rifts within the group. The revelation that some Proud Boys had turned into FBI informants also led members to panic.\n\nThe Proud Boys' decline was also attributed to financial troubles. In June 2021, Tarrio said that the Proud Boys had been \"hemorrhaging money\" since January 2021. The organization's financial woes and internal conflicts ultimately led to its decline and the conviction of Tarrio and other top leaders.\n\n**Trial and conviction for seditious conspiracy**\n\nTarrio was indicted in D.C. federal court on a conspiracy charge by the Justice Department for his involvement in organizing the January 6 attack in March 2022. Tarrio was detained pending trial. In June 2022, a federal grand jury indicted Tarrio and four other top Proud Boys lieutenants on more serious seditious conspiracy charges.\n\nTarrio's trial and conviction marked the culmination of a long and complex investigation into the Proud Boys' involvement in the January 6 attack. His conviction and the convictions of other top leaders marked a significant blow to the organization and its ideology.\n\n**Personal life**\n\nTarrio is of Cuban heritage and identifies as Afro-Cuban.

Biden**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nJill Biden is an American educator and former second lady of the United States. She is the wife of Joe Biden, the 46th President of the United States, and the first person to hold both the positions of Second Lady and First Lady non-consecutively since Pat Nixon. Jill Biden is also the first Italian American First Lady.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJill Tracy Jacobs was born on June 3, 1951, in Hammonton, New Jersey. She is the oldest of five sisters. Her father, Donald Carl Jacobs, was a bank teller and U.S. Navy signalman during World War II who used the G.I. Bill to attend business school and then worked his way up in the banking field. His family name had been Giacoppo before his father and others in the family emigrated from the Sicilian village of Gesso. The name was anglicized to Jacobs about a month after the family entered the United States. Her mother, Bonny Jean (n√©e Godfrey) Jacobs, was a homemaker of English and Scottish descent.\n\n**Education and Career, Marriages and Family**\n\nJacobs enrolled in Brandywine Junior College in Pennsylvania for one semester. She intended to study fashion merchandising but found it unsatisfying. She married Bill Stevenson, a former college football player, in February 1970, taking the name Jill Stevenson. Within a couple of years, he opened the Stone Balloon in Newark, Delaware, near the University of Delaware. It became one of the most successful college bars in the nation. The couple divorced in 1975.\n\n**Role in 2008 Presidential Campaign**\n\nDespite personally opposing the Iraq War, Biden had not wanted her husband to run in the 2004 presidential election. However, following George W. Bush's reelection in 2004, she urged her husband to run again for president. During Joe Biden's unsuccessful campaign to be the 2008 Democratic presidential nominee, she continued to teach during the week and would join him for campaigning on weekends. She said she would have taken an activist role in addressing education as her chief focus of concern as a potential First Lady. She also said she would not seek inclusion in Cabinet meetings and that \"I say that I'm apolitical if that's at all possible being married to Joe for 30 years.\"\n\n**Second Lady of the United States (2009‚Äì2017)**\n\nFollowing the election of the Obama-Biden ticket, she and her husband moved into Number One Observatory Circle, the official vice presidential residence in Washington. But as the new Second Lady of the United States, Biden intended to keep teaching at a Washington-area community college, and several of them recruited her. In January 2009, she began teaching two English courses with an initial appointment as an adjunct professor at the Alexandria campus of Northern Virginia Community College (NOVA), the second-largest community college in the nation. It has been rare for Second Ladies to work while their spouses serve as Vice President, and Biden is believed to have been the first Second Lady to hold a paying job while her husband was Vice President. In White House announcements and by her preference, she was referred to as \"Dr. Jill Biden.\"\n\n**Role in 2012 Presidential Campaign**\n\nIn the 2012 U.S. presidential election, in which her husband was running for re-election as Vice President, Biden played a modest role.

designing the pillbox hat worn by Jacqueline Kennedy to her husband's presidential inauguration in 1961, and when he moved to designing women's wear, Newsweek dubbed him \"the premier fashion designer of all America\" [8] When hats fell out of fashion, Halston moved on to designing clothing, made possible by Estelle Marsh, a millionaire from Amarillo, Texas Marsh was his sole financial backer during this critical time of development He opened his first boutique on Madison Avenue in 1968 The collection that year included a dark jade velvet wedding gown for advertising executive Mary Wells Lawrence Lawrence was married to the CEO of Braniff International Airways, Harding Lawrence She would be instrumental in bringing Halston to Braniff in 1976 to design Braniff's hostess, pilot, ticket agent, and ground personnel uniforms [9]\n\n\nHalstonettes\nAs Halston's popularity and fame grew, those he worked with also became well known His favored models included Pat Cleveland, Anjelica Huston, Heidi Goldberg, Karen Bjornson, Beverly Johnson, Nancy North, Chris Royer, Alva Chinn, Connie Cook, and Pat Ast [16] This entourage of models were eventually dubbed ‚ÄúThe Halstonettes‚Äù by

Halston signed a six-year licensing deal worth a reported $1 billion with retail chain J C Penney The line, called Halston III, consisted of affordable clothing, accessories, cosmetics and perfumes ranging from $24 to $200 At the time, the move was considered controversial, as no other high-end designer had ever licensed their designs to a mid-priced chain retail store While Halston was excited about the deal and felt that it would only expand his brand, the deal damaged his image with high-end fashion retailers who felt that his name had been \"cheapened\" [21] Bergdorf Goodman at the time dropped his Halston Limited line from their store shortly after plans for Halston III were announced [22]\n\n\nPersonal life\nHalston's on-again off-again lover was Venezuelan-born artist Victor Hugo

His hats were not only fashionable but also functional, and he popularized the pillbox hat, which became a signature style.\n\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, Halston began to expand his designs to include clothing and accessories. He was one of the first designers to use synthetic materials, such as nylon and polyester, in his designs. His clothing was known for its simplicity, comfort, and versatility, and he became a favorite among young women who wanted to dress stylishly without sacrificing practicality.\n\n**Popularity**\n\nHalston achieved great fame after designing the pillbox hat worn by Jacqueline Kennedy to her husband's presidential inauguration in 1961. The hat became an iconic symbol of the era, and Halston's reputation as a designer soared. When he moved to designing women's wear, Newsweek dubbed him \"the premier fashion designer of all America.\"\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Halston's designs became more avant-garde and experimental. He used new materials and techniques, such as pleating and draping, to create complex and intricate designs. His clothing was not only fashionable but also revolutionary, and he became a leading figure in the fashion industry.\n\n**Halstonettes**\n\nAs Halston's popularity and fame grew, those he worked with also became well known. His favored models included Pat Cleveland, Anjelica Huston, Heidi Goldberg, Karen Bjornson, Beverly Johnson, Nancy North, Chris Royer, Alva Chinn, Connie Cook, and Pat Ast. This entourage of models were eventually dubbed \"The Halstonettes\" by fashion journalist Andr√© Leon Talley.\n\nThe Halstonettes appeared together in editorials and ads for Halston clothing and cosmetics and appeared at many Halston-related events. The troupe often traveled with Halston, attended his galas, acted as his muses, and reflected ethnic diversity. Halston was one of the first major designers to hire models of different races to walk in his shows and appear in his ads.\n\n**Uniforms**\n\nHalston was very influential in the design of uniforms. In 1977, he was contracted by Braniff International Airways to create a new look for their flight attendants. He created muted brown uniforms with a distinctive \"H\" logo. Halston created interchangeable separates in shades of bone, tan, and taupe, which the airline extended to the seat covers, using brown Argentine leather.\n\nThe entire scheme was dubbed \"Ultra Touch\" by the airline in reference to Halston's ultrasuede designs, and was extremely evocative of the late 1970s. An elaborate party was thrown in February 1977, dubbed Three Nights in Acapulco, to introduce the new Halston fashions along with the new and elegant Braniff International Airways.\n\n**Braniff Airways**\n\nHalston was very influential in the design of uniforms.

He also designed the uniforms for the Girl Scouts, the New York Police Department, and the Avis Rent a Car System.\n\n**Later Years**\n\nIn 1983, Halston signed a six-year licensing deal worth a reported $1 billion with retail chain J.C. Penney. The line, called Halston III, consisted of affordable clothing, accessories, cosmetics, and perfumes ranging from $24 to $200. At the time, the move was considered controversial, as no other high-end designer had ever licensed their designs to a mid-priced chain retail store.\n\nWhile Halston was excited about the deal and felt that it would only expand his brand, the deal damaged his image with high-end fashion retailers who felt that his name had been \"cheapened.\" Bergdorf Goodman at the time dropped his Halston Limited line from their store shortly after plans for Halston III were announced.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nHalston's on-again, off-again lover was Venezuelan-born artist Victor Hugo. The two met while Hugo was working as a makeup artist in 1972. They began a relationship and Hugo lived on and off in Halston's home. Halston soon hired Hugo to work as his window dresser. Their on-and-off relationship lasted a little over ten years.\n\n**Death**\n\nIn 1988, Halston tested positive for HIV. After his health began to fail, he moved to San Francisco, where he was cared for by his family. On March 26, 1990, he died of Kaposi's sarcoma, an AIDS-defining illness, at the California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco. His remains were cremated.\n\n**Commemoration**\n\nIn June 1990, Halston's longtime friend the singer and actress Liza Minnelli sponsored a tribute at Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall that was followed by a reception hosted by his friend Elsa Peretti.\n\n**Company**\n\nSince Halston's death in 1990, his namesake company changed hands several times.", "prompt": "Write a complete

It is one of the most iconic and recognizable symbols of the British monarchy, and its history dates back to the medieval period.\n\n# History\n\nThe Imperial State Crown is a continuation of a tradition of state crowns that dates back to the medieval period. St Edward's Crown, used to crown English monarchs, was considered to be a holy relic, kept in the saint's shrine at Westminster Abbey and therefore not worn by monarchs at any other time. Instead, a \"great crown\" with crosses and fleurs-de-lis, but without arches (an open crown), was a king's usual headgear at state occasions until the time of Henry V, who is depicted wearing an imperial crown of state with gold arches (a closed crown). Arches were a symbol of sovereignty, and by this point in history, the king of England was being celebrated as rex in regno suo est imperator ‚Äì an emperor of his own domain ‚Äì subservient to no one but God, unlike some continental rulers, who owed fealty to more powerful kings or to the Holy Roman Emperor.\n\n# Origin\n\nThe tradition of state crowns continued throughout the centuries, with each monarch adding their own personal touches and symbols to the design. During the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, a new state crown was made for Charles II by Sir Robert Vyner. This crown was a significant departure from the earlier designs, featuring a more elaborate and ornate design. It was also the first crown to feature the Imperial State Crown's characteristic arches.\n\n# Restoration to present day\n\nUpon the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, a new state crown was made for Charles II by Sir Robert Vyner. About 10 versions of the crown have existed since the Restoration. The one made for Queen Victoria in 1838 is the basis for today's crown. Made by Rundell and Bridge using old and new jewels, it had a crimson velvet cap with ermine border and a lining of white silk. It weighed 39.25 troy ounces (43.06 oz; 1,221 g) and was decorated with 1,363 brilliant-cut, 1,273 rose-cut and 147 table-cut diamonds, 277 pearls, 17 sapphires (including St Edward's Sapphire, thought to have been taken from the Confessor's ring when his body was reinterred at Westminster Abbey in 1163), 11 emeralds, 4 rubies, and the Black Prince's Ruby (a cabochon red spinel).\n\n# Description\n\nThe Imperial State Crown is 31.5 cm (12.4 in) tall and weighs 1.06 kg (2.3 lb), and has four fleurs-de-lis alternating with four crosses patt√©e, supporting two arches topped by a monde and cross patt√©e. Its purple velvet cap is trimmed with ermine. The frame is made of gold, silver and platinum, and decorated with 2,868 diamonds, 269 pearls, 17 sapphires, 11 emeralds, and 5 rubies.\n\n# Usage\n\nThe crown is worn by the monarch on leaving Westminster Abbey at the end of his or her coronation. It is usually also worn at State Openings of Parliament, although Elizabeth II wore a hat in March 1974, June 2017 and December 2019 after snap general elections, and in May 2021; and, in October 2019 she wore the State Diadem, while the Imperial State Crown was carried beside her. Usually, it is taken to the Palace of Westminster under armed guard in its own carriage and placed in the Robing Room, where the monarch dons the Robe of State and puts on the crown before giving the speech to Parliament. If a State Opening occurs before a coronation, the crown is placed on a cushion beside the monarch. In 1689, one week after being proclaimed king, William III wore his crown in Parliament to pass the Crown and Parliament Recognition Act 1689.\n\n# Gallery\n\nThe Imperial State Crown is on public display in the Jewel House at the Tower of London. It is a popular attraction for tourists and visitors, and is seen by millions of people each year.\n\n# See also\n\n* St Edward's Crown\n* Crown Jewels\n* British monarchy\n* State Opening of Parliament\n* Coronation\n* Jewel House\n\n# References\n\n# Bibliography\n\n* Biddle, Martin (2010).

Douglas Morrison (1934‚Äì2020) [21] His father was a policeman who served on the Waverley Municipal Council, including a single term as mayor [22] Morrison's maternal grandfather was born in New Zealand [23] His paternal grandmother was the niece of noted Australian poet Dame Mary Gilmore In 2012, on the 50th anniversary of her death, he delivered a tribute to her in federal parliament [24] Morrison is descended from William Roberts, a convict who was convicted of stealing yarn and transported to Australia on the First Fleet in 1788 [25]\n\n\nEarly career\nAfter graduating from university, Morrison worked as national policy and research manager for the Property Council of Australia from 1989 to 1995 [1] He then moved into tourism, serving as deputy chief executive of the Australian Tourism Task Force and then general manager of the Tourism Council of Australia; the latter was managed by Bruce Baird, whom he would eventually succeed in federal parliament [26]\n\n\nTourism Australia\nIn 2004, Morrison left the NSW Liberal Party post to become the inaugural managing director of Tourism Australia, which had been established by the Howard government His appointment was controversial due to its openly political nature [22] He signed an initial three-year contract [34] Morrison approved and defended the contentious \"So where the bloody hell are you?\" advertising campaign featuring Lara Bingle His contract was terminated in July 2006, which at the time was attributed to conflict with tourism minister Fran Bailey over the government's plans to further integrate the agency into the Australian Public Service [35] He had been awarded a pay rise by the Remuneration Tribunal three weeks before his sacking A 2019 investigation by The Saturday Paper suggested Morrison was sacked due to concerns that Tourism Australia was not following government procurement guidelines for three contracts relating to the \"So where the bloody hell are you?\" campaign, with a total value of $184 million A 2008 report from the Auditor-General found that \"information had been kept from the board, procurement guidelines breached and private companies engaged before paperwork was signed and without appropriate value-for-money assessments\" It was suggested that M&C Saatchi, which had previously worked with Morrison on the \"100% Pure\" campaign in New Zealand, received favourable treatment in the tendering process [34] In 2022, following the ministerial positions controversy, Fran Bailey revealed that Morrison showed no respect for his colleagues at Tourism Australia and he left her feeling bullied, also confirming that he ‚Äúpoint-blank refused‚Äù to provide her or the board with any documentation or to answer questions about how the ad campaign was awarded to Saatchi [36]\n\n\nPolitical career\nMorrison sought Liberal preselection for the division of Cook, an electorate in the southern suburbs of Sydney which includes Cronulla,

government and included in cabinet [1]\n\n\nImmigration\nOn 18 September 2013, Morrison launched Operation Sovereign Borders, the new government's strategy aimed at stopping unauthorised boats from entering Australian waters [57] Cabinet documents from this time revealed in 2018 that Morrison asked for mitigation strategies to avoid granting permanent visas to 700 refugees [58] His office reported that there were 300 boats and 20,587 arrivals in 2013 to only 1 boat and 157 arrivals for all of 2014 [59] The UNHCR expressed concerns that the practice may violate the Refugee Convention [60]  In September 2014, it was reported that zero asylum seekers had died at sea since December 2013, compared with more than 1,100 deaths between 2008 and 2013 [61] The annual refugee intake, which had been increased to 20,000 for 2012‚Äì13 by the previous government, was reduced to 13,750, the level it had been in 2011‚Äì12 Morrison stated that \"Not one of those places will go to anyone who

2015, he announced the introduction of the \"No Jab, No Pay\" policy, which withholds family and childcare benefits from parents who do not vaccinate their children [80] His time as minister was criticised by his opposition counterpart Jenny Macklin, who said that \"Scott Morrison was appointed to clean up Kevin Andrews' mess but left behind more chaos, confusion and cuts.\" [81]\n\n\nTurnbull government (2015‚Äì2018)\nMorrison was appointed as Treasurer in the Turnbull government in September 2015, replacing Joe Hockey [88] [89] In his first press conference as Treasurer, he indicated a reduction in government expenditure and stated that the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO) and White Paper on tax reform would arrive on time [90]\n\n\nPrime Minister of Australia (2018‚Äì2022)\nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called a leadership spill on 21 August 2018 in order to gauge the confidence of the Liberal Party in his leadership [101] He defeated challenger Peter Dutton by 48 votes to 35 [102] Over the following days, there was repeated speculation about a second spill being called, without Turnbull's approval Turnbull announced two

[118]\n\n\n2019 federal election\nMorrison led the Coalition into the 2019 election At time of the writs being issued, the Coalition had been behind the Labor Party in most opinion polls for previous term of parliament, leading to widespread expectations that the Coalition would lose [126] However, in a significant upset, the Coalition retained its majority [127] This was considered to have been caused by the unpopularity of opposition leader Bill Shorten and Labor's failure to adapt to the re-framing of the election as a choice between Morrison and Shorten [128] [129] Claiming victory on election night, Morrison stated that he had \"always believed in miracles\" [130]\n\n\nSecond term, 2019‚Äì2022\nIn December 2019, Morrison faced criticism for taking an unannounced overseas holiday with his family to Hawaii, United States during the 2019‚Äì20 Australian bushfire season [131] [132] [133] Morrison's office initially declined to comment on the length of his trip and his whereabouts, citing security concerns, and made false claims that Morrison was not in Hawaii [131] [134] After increasing criticism from opposition politicians and on social media regarding the holiday, Morrison released a statement on 20 December that stated he \"deeply regret [ted] any offence caused\" and that he would cut his holiday short to return to Australia on 21 December [131] [135] [136]\n\n\nDomestic affairs\nIn December 2019, Morrison faced criticism for taking an unannounced overseas holiday with his family to Hawaii, United States during the 2019‚Äì20 Australian

regarding the holiday, Morrison released a statement on 20 December that stated he \"deeply regret [ted] any offence caused\" and that he would cut his holiday short to return to Australia on 21 December [131] [135] [136]\n\n\nResponse to parliamentary sexual misconduct allegations\nThe Morrison government was widely criticised for its handling of the 2021 Australian Parliament House sexual misconduct allegations, with an Essential poll finding that 65% of respondents (including 76% of Labor supporters, 51% of Coalition supporters and 88% of Greens supporters) saying the government was more interested in protecting itself than women [138] As well as the Labor and Greens parties, the government faced criticism from within its own party Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, who had been made aware of the allegations against Christian Porter in 2019, criticised him for taking too long to come forward [139] Former prime minister John Howard defended Morrison's decision not to open an independent inquiry into Porter's conduct [140] Australian of the Year and sexual assault survivor advocate Grace Tame also criticised Morrison in a speech to the National Press Club, saying she did not believe he was creating an environment where victims were believed She also said \"It shouldn't take having children to have a conscience\" in response to Morrison's statement that he'd been prompted to reflect on the issue and decide to listen to Tame after a discussion with his wife Jenny Morrison where she said to him \"you have to think about this as a father What would you want to happen if it were our girls?\" [141] Porter resigned from his parliamentary position in September following concerns that he had accepted anonymous donations via a blind trust to pay for his legal expenses [142] The following month, Morrison and the Coalition successfully voted against a motion to investigate Porter's blind trust, in turn preventing the identities of the benefactors who donated to his legal costs from being revealed [143] The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Tony Smith, had determined that there was a prima facie case and, in voting down the motion, the Morrison government became the first government since Federation to refuse a referral from the Speaker [144] This decision attracted significant attention and criticism from the media [145] [146] [147] [148] [149]\n\n\nAfghan refugees\nMorrison was also criticised for not accepting more Afghan refugees, who were fleeing the country after the Taliban seized control of the country in August 2021 [150] He agreed to give humanitarian visas to 3,000 Afghan refugees, fewer than other countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom [151] Morrison later determined that more than 3,000 refugees may be accepted, as the original number was a \"floor not a ceiling\" [152] He would later state that he would only resettle refugees who came in through \"official channels\", and those who came to Australia via boat would not receive permanent residency [153] [154]\n\n\nEastern Australia floods\nMorrison was heavily condemned for his government's response to the 2022 eastern Australia floods; criticism was levelled against him for campaigning in Perth instead of being present in New South Wales, causing a relief package for flood victims to be delayed, with many critics suggesting that Morrison was prioritising marketing over the flood response [155] [156]\n\n\nJoint ministerial positions\nOn 15 August 2022, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced an investigation by his office into claims that Morrison secretly appointed himself to administer several government departments during the COVID-19 pandemic [157] [158] [159] The health minister at the time, Greg Hunt, was understood to have agreed to Morrison's position administering the health department;  however, the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, was unaware that Morrison had appointed himself in a joint ministerial position The resources minister, Keith Pitt, was aware of Morrison's self-appointment to the resources portfolio \"sometime in 2021\" [157] David Littleproud, who was the agriculture minister in Morrison's government, criticised the self-appointments as \"pretty ordinary [a]\" [157]\n\n\nTribunal appointments\nTwo former senior judges have reported to the Commonwealth Attorney-General that, shortly before the 2022 Australian federal election was called, the Morrison government got an unusual number of people with political connections to the Coalition appointed to highly paid positions on the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Each was appointed by the Governor-General through an administrative instrument, but the appointment was not gazetted, although there was at least one media release In some cases, the appointee was already a member of the AAT whose term still had some time to run In no case did the new appointment carry a specified term of office The two former judges question whether these appointments were validly made and whether, if they were not valid, that would affect the validity of decisions that these appointees have made [174]\n\n\nAustralian Future Leaders Foundation\nThe Australian Future Leaders Foundation, a leadership education programme proposed by Governor-General David Hurley, was formally established in 2021  The Morrison government allocated it $18m in funding over five years, with no formal process of approval  The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Delegated Legislation was seeking further information and no public money had yet been paid, [175] although Hurley had hosted fundraising events at Government House, when the Albanese government cancelled the grant [176]\n\n\nForeign affairs\nIn August 2019, Morrison called on the Chief Executive of Hong Kong to listen to protester demands, denying that the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests were showing signs of terrorism [177]\n\n\n2019 Hong Kong protests\nIn August 2019, Morrison called on the Chief Executive of Hong Kong to listen to protester demands, denying that the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests were showing signs of terrorism [177]\n\n\n2019 Turkish offensive\nIn October 2019, Morrison criticised the 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria Morrison stated that he was concerned for the safety of the Kurds living in the region and also feared that the offensive could result in a resurgence of ISIS [178]\n\n\nSino‚ÄìAustralian relations\nOn 30 November 2020, a Chinese diplomat, Zhao Lijian, posted on his Twitter page a digitally manipulated image of an Australian soldier who appeared to hold a bloodied knife against the throat of an Afghan child [179] [180] The image is believed to be a reference to the Brereton Report, which had been released earlier by the Australian government that month, and which details war crimes committed by the Australian Defence Force during the War in Afghanistan between 2005 and 2016 [181] Later that day, Morrison called a press conference, calling the image \"offensive\" and \"truly repugnant\", [182] and demanding a formal apology from the Chinese government China rejected the demands for an apology on the following day, [183] with the artist of the image creating another artwork To Morrison in response to Morrison's demand [184] The incident had the effect of unifying Australian politicians in condemning China across party lines while also drawing attention to the Brereton Report [185] The incident was further seen as a sign of deteriorating relations between Australia and China [186]\n\n\nRelations with New Zealand\nAs prime minister, Morrison has defended Australia's policy of deporting non-citizens including New Zealanders who had violated its character test or committed crimes This policy was criticised by his New Zealand counterpart Jacinda Ardern, who described it as \"corrosive\" to Australia‚ÄìNew Zealand relations in February 2020 [187] [188]\n\n\n2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\nIn February 2022, Morrison condemned Russian President Vladimir Putin for launching the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and imposed sanctions on travel bans on individuals perceived to be supporting the invasion [198] Morrison said Australia would begin sending lethal aid to the Ukrainian government [199] The Australian government moved to join with the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States in personally sanctioning Putin and Sergey Lavrov, the foreign minister [200]\n\n\nAUKUS\nIn September 2021, Morrison, British premier Boris Johnson and US President Joe Biden announced AUKUS, a security pact between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States seen as an initiative to counter the perceived dominance of China in the Pacific [201] [202] This superseded a proposed submarine pact between Australia and France that had been in discussions at the same time; the announcement of AUKUS attracted backlash from French officials and damaged Australia‚ÄìFrance relations Chinese officials also criticised the agreement [203] [204] French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly remarked privately to Morrison that the dissolution of the agreement had \"broke the relationship of trust\" between the two countries, [205] [206] and publicly accused him of lying during the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, which was seen as damaging to Morrison's public image [207] [208] [209]\n\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in Australia prompted Morrison to establish the National Cabinet on 13 March 2020 This body is composed of the prime minister and the premiers and chief ministers of the states and territories to coordinate the national response to the pandemic [210] On 29 May 2020, the Prime Minister announced that the National Cabinet would replace the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) and meetings after the pandemic would be held monthly, instead of the biannual meetings of COAG [211]\n\n\nVaccine rollout\nIn August 2020, Morrison announced that Australians would be \"among the first in the world to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, if it proves successful, through an agreement between the Australian government and UK-based drug company AstraZeneca\" [217] In November 2020, he said the government's COVID-19 strategy would put \"Australia at the front of the queue for a safe and effective vaccine\" [218]\n\n\n2022 federal election\nMorrison sought a second full term at the 2022 Australian federal election His primary opposition was the Labor Party, led by Anthony Albanese The Coalition suffered heavy losses, and it soon became apparent that there was no realistic scenario for Morrison to stay in office Hours after the polls closed, he conceded defeat to Albanese [230] The Coalition's loss was attributed to Morrison's unpopularity with voters, the popularity of centrist \"teal independents\" in certain inner-city electorates, and a large swing toward Labor in Western Australia [231] [232] After conceding defeat, Morrison announced that he would step down as leader of the Liberal Party [233] Soon afterward, he advised the Governor-General, David Hurley, that he was no longer in a position to govern.\n\n\nAsylum seeker boat controversy\nOn election day, 21 May 2022, a Suspected Illegal Entry Vessel was intercepted as a part of Joint Agency Task Force (JATF), Operation Sovereign Borders The Prime Minister‚Äôs Office then asked the Commander of the JATF to publish a statement about the interception The incoming Labor government ordered a departmental inquiry, which found that officials had been pressured by the immigration minister, apparently urged by Morrison, to make a quick announcement with release to selected journalists as well as social media, but had refused do so;  although, at the minister's insistence, basic factual information was given limited release in time for a press conference by the prime minister [238] [239] [240]\n\n\nPost-prime ministerial career\nSoon after the 2022 election, on 30 May, Peter Dutton was elected as the new leader of the Liberal Party in a leadership election, with Dutton later stating that Morrison would not be included in his shadow ministry [241] Morrison remained in Parliament as a backbencher until his resignation in February 2024 In May 2023, he took an advisory position with the U.S based think tank the Center for a New American Security [242]\n\n\nSecret ministerial appointments controversy\nIn August 2022, Morrison was involved in a political scandal when reports emerged that he had secretly advised Governor-General Hurley to appoint him as joint minister for Health, Finance, and Resources between March 2020 and May 2021 In a press conference on 15 August, Albanese announced an investigation into the reports, saying that the people were \"kept in the dark\" about these developments in a manner that was \"unacceptable\" and \"very contrary to our Westminster system\" [18] The following day, Albanese revealed that Morrison had himself appointed as joint Treasurer and joint minister for Home Affairs in addition to the other three portfolios [245]\n\n\nPrivate sector career\nOn 23 January 2024, Morrison announced his resignation as Member for Cook He formally resigned on 28 February 2024 [17] Morrison is reportedly set to join a consulting firm founded by Robert C O'Brien, who served as National Security Advisor to former U.S President Donald Trump Morrison will reportedly join the firm, American Global Strategies LLC, as a non-executive vice chairman [247]\n\n\nPolitical views\nDefunct\n\n\nSocial policies\nMorrison has declared himself a proud supporter of the Australian constitutional monarchy [253] [254] In January 2021, he commented that he opposes changing the date of Australia Day from 26 January, which attracted criticism [255] [256]\n\n\nEnvironmental policies\nThis is coal Don't be afraid Don't be scared It won't hurt you.\n\n\nPublic image\nMorrison was one of Australia's most popular and unpopular prime ministers At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020, Morrison's job performance was approved by 68 percent of voters, one of the highest approval ratings for an Australian prime minister on record [288] However, by March 2022, Morrison's popularity had greatly declined, and he was found to be Australia's least trusted politician in a study by Roy Morgan Research [289] A study taken after his government's defeat in the 2022 federal election conducted by the Australian National University in December 2022 found that Morrison was the most unpopular major party leader since the beginning of the survey in 1987 [290] In a poll conducted by The Guardian in September 2022, over half of respondents believed Morrison should resign from Parliament [291] Research conducted by The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age in December 2023 found Morrison to be Australia's most disliked politician [292]\n\n\nPersonal life\nMorrison is a fan of rugby union and supported the Eastern Suburbs RUFC during his childhood After moving to the Sutherland Shire, he became a fan of the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks rugby league team and was named the club's number-one ticket holder in 2016 [26] [303]\n\n\nMarriage and children\nMorrison began dating Jenny Warren when they were both 16 [304] They married in 1990, [305] [306] [307] when Morrison was 21 and Warren was 22, and have two daughters together After multiple unsuccessful IVF treatments over a period of 14 years, their daughters were conceived naturally [304] Their daughters attend an independent Baptist school Morrison has stated that one of the reasons for this choice was so that he could avoid \"the values of others being imposed on my children.\" [308]\n\n\nReligious beliefs\nMorrison was raised in the Presbyterian Church of Australia, [309] which partly merged into the Uniting Church when he was a child He later became a Pentecostal and now attends the Horizon Church, [310] which is affiliated with the Australian Christian Churches [22] Morrison was Australia's first Pentecostal prime minister [311] As a Pentecostal and evangelical church, Horizon is not a mainstream church in Australia Some members believe in divine healing, and practise \"speaking in tongues\", which is seen as a miraculous gift from God [312]\n\n\nHealth\nIn 2024, Morrison revealed he had been prescribed medication for anxiety during his premiership, which he blamed on \"pure physical exhaustion\" and the \"unrelenting and callous brutality of politics\" [318]\n\n\nHonours\n\n\nForeign honours\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Scott

Turnbull announced two days later that he would resign the leadership if a spill motion were passed. Dutton, Morrison, and Julie Bishop announced they would stand for the leadership if that were the case.\n\n**Leadership Election**\n\nTurnbull called a leadership spill on 21 August 2018 in order to gauge the confidence of the Liberal Party in his leadership. He defeated challenger Peter Dutton by 48 votes to 35. Over the following days, there was repeated speculation about a second spill being called, without Turnbull's approval. Turnbull announced two days later that he would resign the leadership if a spill motion were passed. Dutton, Morrison, and Julie Bishop announced they would stand for the leadership if that were the case.\n\n**First Term (2018‚Äì2019)**\n\nMorrison made his first overseas trip as prime minister less than a week after acceding to the office. He visited the Indonesian capital of Jakarta for the Australia‚ÄìIndonesia Business Forum and met with President Joko Widodo, announcing the Indonesia‚ÄìAustralia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement that had been negotiated under the preceding Turnbull government.\n\n**2019 Federal Election**\n\nMorrison led the Coalition into the 2019 election. At the time of the writs being issued, the Coalition had been behind the Labor Party in most opinion polls for the previous term of parliament, leading to widespread expectations that the Coalition would lose. However, in a significant upset, the Coalition retained its majority. This was considered to have been caused by the unpopularity of opposition leader Bill Shorten and Labor's failure to adapt to the re-framing of the election as a choice between Morrison and Shorten. Claiming victory on election night, Morrison stated that he had \"always believed in miracles.\"\n\n**Second Term (2019‚Äì2022)**\n\nIn December 2019, Morrison faced criticism for taking an unannounced overseas holiday with his family to Hawaii, United States during the 2019‚Äì20 Australian bushfire season. Morrison's office initially declined to comment on the length of his trip and his whereabouts, citing security concerns, and made false claims that Morrison was not in Hawaii. After increasing criticism from opposition politicians and on social media regarding the holiday, Morrison released a statement on 20 December that stated he \"deeply regret[ted] any offence caused\" and that he would cut his holiday short to return to Australia on 21 December.\n\n**Domestic Affairs**\n\nIn December 2019, Morrison faced criticism for taking an unannounced overseas holiday with his family to Hawaii, United States during the 2019‚Äì20 Australian bushfire season.

As well as the Labor and Greens parties, the government faced criticism from within its own party. Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull criticised Morrison for taking too long to come forward with allegations against Christian Porter, who had been accused of rape. Former prime minister John Howard defended Morrison's decision not to open an independent inquiry into Porter's conduct. Australian of the Year and sexual assault survivor advocate Grace Tame also criticised Morrison in a speech to the National Press Club, saying she did not believe he was creating an environment where victims were believed. She also said \"It shouldn't take having children to have a conscience\" in response to Morrison's statement that he'd been prompted to reflect on the issue and decide to listen to Tame after a discussion with his wife Jenny Morrison where she said to him \"you have to think about this as a father What would you want to happen if it were our girls?\"\n\n**Afghan Refugees**\n\nMorrison was also criticised for not accepting more Afghan refugees, who were fleeing the country after the Taliban seized control of the country in August 2021. He agreed to give humanitarian visas to 3,000 Afghan refugees, fewer than other countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom. Morrison later determined that more than 3,000 refugees may be accepted, as the original number was a \"floor not a ceiling.\" He would later state that he would only resettle refugees who came in through \"official channels,\" and those who came to Australia via boat would not receive permanent residency.\n\n**Eastern Australia Floods**\n\nMorrison was heavily condemned for his government's response to the 2022 eastern Australia floods, with criticism levelled against him for campaigning in Perth instead of being present in New South Wales, causing a relief package for flood victims to be delayed. Many critics suggested that Morrison was prioritising marketing over the flood response.\n\n**Joint Ministerial Positions**\n\nOn 15 August 2022, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced an investigation by his office into claims that Morrison secretly advised Governor-General David Hurley to appoint him as joint minister for Health, Finance, and Resources between March 2020 and May 2021. The following day, Albanese revealed that Morrison had himself appointed as joint Treasurer and joint minister for Home Affairs in addition to the other three portfolios.\n\n**Private Sector Career**\n\nOn 23 January 2024, Morrison announced his resignation as Member for Cook. He formally resigned on 28 February 2024. Morrison is reportedly set to join a consulting firm founded by Robert C O'Brien, who served as National Security Advisor to former U.S President Donald Trump. Morrison will reportedly join the firm, American Global Strategies LLC, as a non-executive vice chairman.\n\n**Political Views**\n\nMorrison has declared himself a proud supporter of the Australian constitutional monarchy. In January 2021, he commented that he opposes changing the date of Australia Day from 26 January, which attracted criticism.\n\n**Environmental Policies**\n\nMorrison has been a strong supporter of the coal industry. In 2019, he stated that \"This is coal. Don't be afraid. Don't be scared. It won't hurt you.\"\n\n**Public Image**\n\nMorrison was one of Australia's most popular and unpopular prime ministers. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020, Morrison's job performance was approved by 68% of voters, one of the highest approval ratings for an Australian prime minister on record. However, by March 2022, Morrison's popularity had greatly declined, and he was found to be Australia's least trusted politician in a study by Roy Morgan Research. A study taken after his government's defeat in the 2022 federal election conducted by the Australian National University in December 2022 found that Morrison was the most unpopular major party leader since the beginning of the survey in 1987. In a poll conducted by The Guardian in September 2022, over half of respondents believed Morrison should resign from Parliament. Research conducted by The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age in December 2023 found Morrison to be Australia's most disliked politician.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nMorrison is a fan of rugby union and supported the Eastern Suburbs RUFC during his childhood. After moving to the Sutherland Shire, he became a fan of the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks rugby league team and was named the club's number-one ticket holder in 2016.\n\n**Marriage and Children**\n\nMorrison began dating Jenny Warren when they were both 16. They married in 1990, when Morrison was 21 and Warren was 22, and have two daughters together. After multiple unsuccessful IVF treatments over a period of 14 years, their daughters were conceived naturally. Their daughters attend an independent Baptist school. Morrison has stated that one of the reasons for this choice was so that he could avoid \"the values of others being imposed on my children.\"\n\n**Religious Beliefs**\n\nMorrison was raised in the Presbyterian Church of Australia, which partly merged into the Uniting Church when he was a child. He later became a Pentecostal and now attends the Horizon Church, which is affiliated with the Australian Christian Churches. Morrison was Australia's first Pentecostal prime minister. As a Pentecostal and evangelical church, Horizon is not a mainstream church in Australia. Some members believe in divine healing, and practise \"speaking in tongues,\" which is seen as a miraculous gift from God.\n\n**Health**\n\nIn 2024, Morrison revealed he had been prescribed medication for anxiety during his premiership, which he blamed on \"pure physical exhaustion\" and the \"unrelenting and callous brutality of politics.\"\n\n**Foreign Honours**\n\nMorrison was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Rays, by the Emperor of Japan in 2019.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article is entirely based on publicly available information and does not contain any citations or references.\n\n**Notes**\n\n1.

born in the suburb of Waverley in Sydney, [19] [20] the younger of two sons born to Marion (n√©e Smith) and John Douglas Morrison (1934‚Äì2020) [21] His father was a policeman who served on the Waverley Municipal Council, including a single term as mayor [22] Morrison's maternal grandfather was born in New Zealand [23] His paternal grandmother was the niece of noted Australian poet Dame Mary Gilmore In 2012, on the 50th anniversary of her death, he delivered a tribute to her in federal parliament [24] Morrison is descended from William Roberts, a convict who was convicted of stealing yarn and transported to Australia on the First Fleet in 1788 [25]\n\n\nEarly career\nAfter graduating from university, Morrison worked as national policy and research manager for the Property Council of Australia from 1989 to 1995 [1] He then moved into tourism, serving as deputy chief executive of the Australian Tourism Task Force and then general manager of the Tourism Council of Australia; the latter was managed by Bruce Baird, whom he would eventually succeed in federal parliament [26]\n\n\nTourism Australia\nIn 2004, Morrison left the NSW Liberal Party post to become the inaugural managing director of Tourism Australia, which had been established by the Howard government His appointment was controversial due to its openly political nature [22] He signed an initial three-year contract [34] Morrison approved and defended the contentious \"So where the bloody hell are you?\" advertising campaign featuring Lara Bingle His contract was terminated in July 2006, which at the time was attributed to conflict with tourism minister Fran Bailey over the government's plans to further integrate the agency into the Australian Public Service [35] He had been awarded a pay rise by the Remuneration Tribunal three weeks before his sacking A 2019 investigation by The Saturday Paper suggested Morrison was sacked due to concerns that Tourism Australia was not following government procurement guidelines for three contracts relating to the \"So where the bloody hell are you?\" campaign, with a total value of $184 million A 2008 report from the Auditor-General found that \"information had been kept from the board, procurement guidelines breached and private companies engaged before paperwork was signed and without appropriate value-for-money assessments\" It was suggested that M&C Saatchi, which had previously worked with Morrison on the \"100% Pure\" campaign in New Zealand, received favourable treatment in the tendering process [34] In 2022, following the ministerial positions controversy, Fran Bailey revealed that Morrison showed no respect for his colleagues at Tourism Australia and he left her feeling bullied, also confirming that he ‚Äúpoint-blank refused‚Äù to provide her or the board with any documentation or to answer questions about how the ad campaign was awarded to Saatchi [36]\n\n\nPolitical career\nMorrison sought Liberal preselection for the division of Cook, an electorate in the southern suburbs of Sydney which includes Cronulla, Caringbah, and Miranda, for the 2007 election, following the retirement of Bruce Baird, who had been the member since 1998 [40] [41] He lost the ballot to Michael Towke, a telecommunications engineer and the candidate of the Liberals' right faction, by 82 votes to 8 [42] Paul Fletcher who came closest to Towke received 70 votes Fletcher went on to win Liberal preselection for the North Shore seat of Bradfield [43]\n\n\nOpposition (2007‚Äì2013)\nMorrison sought Liberal preselection for the

federal election, Morrison was appointed Minister for Immigration and Border Protection in the Abbott government and included in cabinet [1]\n\n\nImmigration\nOn 18 September 2013, Morrison launched Operation Sovereign Borders, the new government's strategy aimed at stopping unauthorised boats from entering Australian waters [57] Cabinet documents from this time revealed in 2018 that Morrison asked for mitigation strategies to avoid granting permanent visas to 700 refugees [58] His office reported that there were 300 boats and 20,587 arrivals in 2013 to only 1 boat and 157 arrivals for all of 2014 [59] The UNHCR expressed concerns that the practice may violate the Refugee Convention [60]  In September 2014, it was reported that zero asylum seekers had died at sea since December 2013, compared with more than 1,100 deaths between 2008 and 2013 [61] The annual refugee intake, which had been increased to 20,000 for 2012‚Äì13 by the previous government, was reduced to 13,750, the level it had been in 2011‚Äì12 Morrison stated that \"Not one of those places will go to anyone who comes on a boat to Australia  [...] they will go to people who have come the right way.\" [62] [63]\n\n\nSocial services\nIn a cabinet reshuffle in late December 2014, Morrison was appointed the Minister for Social Services and ceased to be Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [77] As minister, Morrison changed indexation changes to the Family Tax Benefits payment [78] [79] In April 2015, he announced the introduction of the \"No Jab, No Pay\" policy, which withholds family and childcare benefits from parents who do not vaccinate their children [80] His time as minister was criticised by his opposition counterpart Jenny Macklin, who said that \"Scott Morrison was appointed to clean up Kevin Andrews' mess but left behind more chaos, confusion and cuts.\" [81]\n\n\nTurnbull government (2015‚Äì2018)\nMorrison was appointed as Treasurer in the Turnbull government in September 2015, replacing Joe Hockey [88] [89] In his first press conference as Treasurer, he indicated a reduction in government expenditure and stated that the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO) and White Paper on tax reform would arrive on time [90]\n\n\nPrime Minister of Australia (2018‚Äì2022)\nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called a leadership spill on 21 August 2018 in order to

the 2021 Australian Parliament House sexual misconduct allegations, with an Essential poll finding that 65% of respondents (including 76% of Labor supporters, 51% of Coalition supporters and 88% of Greens supporters) saying the government was more interested in protecting itself than women [138] As well as the Labor and Greens parties, the government faced criticism from within its own party

about this as a father What would you want to happen if it were our girls?\" [141] Porter resigned from his parliamentary position in September following concerns that he had accepted anonymous donations via a blind trust to pay for his legal expenses [142] The following month, Morrison and the Coalition successfully voted against a motion to investigate Porter's blind trust, in turn preventing the identities of the benefactors who donated to his legal costs from being revealed [143] The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Tony Smith, had determined that there was a prima facie case and, in voting down the motion, the Morrison government became the first government since Federation to refuse a referral from the Speaker [144] This decision attracted significant attention and criticism from the media [145] [146] [147] [148] [149]\n\n\nAfghan refugees\nMorrison was also criticised for not accepting more Afghan refugees, who were fleeing the country after the Taliban seized control of the country in August 2021 [150] He agreed to give humanitarian visas to 3,000 Afghan refugees, fewer than other countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom

government's response to the 2022 eastern Australia floods; criticism was levelled against him for campaigning in Perth instead of being present in New South Wales, causing a relief package for flood victims to be delayed, with many critics suggesting that Morrison was prioritising marketing over the flood response [155] [156]\n\n\nJoint ministerial positions\nOn 15 August 2022, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced an investigation by his office into claims that Morrison secretly appointed himself to administer several government departments during the COVID-19 pandemic [157] [158] [159] The health minister at the time, Greg Hunt, was understood to have agreed to Morrison's position administering the health department;  however, the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, was unaware that Morrison had appointed himself in a joint ministerial position The resources minister, Keith Pitt, was aware of Morrison's self-appointment to the resources portfolio \"sometime in 2021\" [157] David Littleproud, who was the agriculture minister in Morrison's government, criticised the self-appointments as \"pretty ordinary [a]\" [157]\n\n\nTribunal appointments\nTwo former senior judges have reported to the Commonwealth Attorney-General that, shortly before the 2022 Australian federal election was called, the Morrison government got an unusual number of people with political connections to the Coalition appointed to highly paid positions on the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Each was appointed by the Governor-General through an administrative instrument, but the appointment was not gazetted, although there was at least one media release In some cases, the appointee was already a member of the AAT whose term still had some time to run In no case did the new appointment carry a specified term of office The two former judges question whether these appointments were validly made and whether, if they were not valid, that would affect the validity of decisions that these appointees have made [174]\n\n\nAustralian Future Leaders Foundation\nThe Australian Future Leaders Foundation, a leadership education programme proposed by Governor-General David Hurley, was formally established in 2021  The Morrison government allocated it $18m in funding over five years, with no formal process of approval  The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Delegated Legislation was seeking further information and no public money had yet been paid, [175] although Hurley had hosted fundraising events at Government House, when the Albanese government cancelled the grant [176]\n\n\nForeign affairs\nIn August 2019, Morrison called on the Chief Executive of Hong Kong to listen to protester demands, denying that the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests were showing signs of terrorism [177]\n\n\n2019 Hong Kong protests\nIn August 2019, Morrison called on the Chief Executive of Hong Kong to listen to protester demands, denying that the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests were showing signs of terrorism [177]\n\n\n2019 Turkish offensive\nIn October 2019, Morrison criticised the 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria Morrison stated that he was concerned for the safety of the Kurds living in the region and also feared that the offensive could result in a resurgence of ISIS [178]\n\n\nSino‚ÄìAustralian relations\nOn 30 November 2020, a Chinese diplomat, Zhao Lijian, posted on his Twitter page a digitally manipulated image of an Australian soldier who appeared to hold a bloodied knife against the throat of an Afghan child [179] [180] The image is believed to be a reference to the Brereton Report, which had been released earlier by the Australian government that month, and which details war crimes committed by the Australian Defence Force during the War in Afghanistan between 2005 and 2016 [181] Later that day, Morrison called a press conference, calling the image \"offensive\" and \"truly repugnant\", [182] and demanding a formal apology from the Chinese government China rejected the demands for an apology on the following day, [183] with the artist of the image creating another artwork To Morrison in response to Morrison's demand [184] The incident had the effect of unifying Australian politicians in condemning China across party lines while also drawing attention to the Brereton Report [185] The incident was further seen as a sign of deteriorating relations between Australia and China [186]\n\n\nRelations with New Zealand\nAs prime minister, Morrison has defended Australia's policy of deporting non-citizens including New Zealanders who had violated its character test or committed crimes This policy was criticised by his New Zealand counterpart Jacinda Ardern, who described it as \"corrosive\" to Australia‚ÄìNew Zealand relations in February 2020 [187] [188]\n\n\n2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\nIn February 2022, Morrison condemned Russian President Vladimir Putin for launching the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and imposed sanctions on travel bans on individuals perceived to be supporting the invasion [198] Morrison said Australia would begin sending lethal aid to the Ukrainian government [199] The Australian government moved to join with the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States in personally sanctioning Putin and Sergey Lavrov, the foreign minister [200]\n\n\nAUKUS\nIn September 2021, Morrison, British premier Boris Johnson and US President Joe Biden announced AUKUS, a security pact between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States seen as an initiative to counter the perceived dominance of China in the Pacific [201] [202] This superseded a proposed submarine pact between Australia and France that had been in discussions at the same time; the announcement of AUKUS attracted backlash from French officials and damaged Australia‚ÄìFrance relations Chinese officials also criticised the agreement [203] [204] French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly remarked privately to Morrison that the dissolution of the agreement had \"broke the relationship of trust\" between the two countries, [205] [206] and publicly accused him of lying during the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, which was seen as damaging to Morrison's public image [207] [208] [209]\n\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in Australia prompted Morrison to establish the National Cabinet on 13 March 2020 This body is composed of the prime minister and the premiers and chief ministers of the states and territories to coordinate the national response to the pandemic [210] On 29 May 2020, the Prime Minister announced that the National Cabinet would replace the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) and meetings after the pandemic would be held monthly, instead of the biannual meetings of COAG [211]\n\n\nVaccine rollout\nIn August 2020, Morrison announced that Australians would be \"among the first in the world to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, if it proves successful, through an agreement between the Australian government and UK-based drug company AstraZeneca\" [217] In November 2020, he said the government's COVID-19 strategy would put \"Australia at the front of the queue for a safe and effective vaccine\" [218]\n\n\n2022 federal election\nMorrison sought a second full term at the 2022 Australian federal election His primary opposition was the Labor Party, led by Anthony Albanese The Coalition suffered heavy losses, and it soon became apparent that there was no realistic scenario for Morrison to stay in office Hours after the polls closed, he conceded defeat to Albanese [230] The Coalition's loss was attributed to Morrison's unpopularity with voters, the popularity of centrist \"teal independents\" in certain inner-city electorates, and a large swing toward Labor in Western Australia [231] [232] After conceding defeat, Morrison announced that he would step down as leader of the Liberal Party [233] Soon afterward, he advised the Governor-General, David Hurley, that he was no longer in a position to govern.\n\n\nAsylum seeker boat controversy\nOn election day, 21 May 2022, a Suspected Illegal Entry Vessel was intercepted as a part of Joint Agency Task Force (JATF), Operation Sovereign Borders The Prime Minister‚Äôs Office then asked the Commander of the JATF to publish a statement about the interception The incoming Labor government ordered a departmental inquiry, which found that officials had been pressured by the immigration minister, apparently urged by Morrison, to make a quick announcement with release to selected journalists as well as social media, but had refused do so;  although, at the minister's insistence, basic factual information was given limited release in time for a press conference by the prime minister [238] [239] [240]\n\n\nPost-prime ministerial career\nSoon after the 2022 election, on 30 May, Peter Dutton was elected as the new leader of the Liberal Party in a leadership election, with Dutton later stating that Morrison would not be included in his shadow ministry [241] Morrison remained in Parliament as a backbencher until his resignation in February 2024 In May 2023, he took an advisory position with the U.S based think tank the Center for a New American Security [242]\n\n\nSecret ministerial appointments controversy\nIn August 2022, Morrison was involved in a political scandal when reports emerged that he had secretly advised Governor-General Hurley to appoint him as joint minister for Health, Finance, and Resources between March 2020 and May 2021 In a press conference on 15 August, Albanese announced an investigation into the reports, saying that the people were \"kept in the dark\" about these developments in a manner that was \"unacceptable\" and \"very contrary to our Westminster system\" [18] The following day, Albanese revealed that Morrison had himself appointed as joint Treasurer and joint minister for Home Affairs in addition to the other three portfolios [245]\n\n\nPrivate sector career\nOn 23 January 2024, Morrison announced his resignation as Member for Cook He formally resigned on 28 February 2024 [17] Morrison is reportedly set to join a consulting firm founded by Robert C O'Brien, who served as National Security Advisor to former U.S President Donald Trump Morrison will reportedly join the firm, American Global Strategies LLC, as a non-executive vice chairman [247]\n\n\nPolitical views\nDefunct\n\n\nSocial policies\nMorrison has declared himself a proud supporter of the Australian constitutional monarchy [253] [254] In January 2021, he commented that he opposes changing the date of Australia Day from 26 January, which attracted criticism [255] [256]\n\n\nEnvironmental policies\nThis is coal Don't be afraid Don't be scared It won't hurt you.\n\n\nPublic image\nMorrison was one of Australia's most popular and unpopular prime ministers At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020, Morrison's job performance was approved by 68 percent of voters, one of the highest approval ratings for an Australian prime minister on record [288] However, by March 2022, Morrison's popularity had greatly declined, and he was found to be Australia's least trusted politician in a study by Roy Morgan Research [289] A study taken after his government's defeat in the 2022 federal election conducted by the Australian National University in December 2022 found that Morrison was the most unpopular major party leader since the beginning of the survey in 1987 [290] In a poll conducted by The Guardian in September 2022, over half of respondents believed Morrison should resign from Parliament [291] Research conducted by The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age in December 2023 found Morrison to be Australia's most disliked politician [292]\n\n\nPersonal life\nMorrison is a fan of rugby union and supported the Eastern Suburbs RUFC during his childhood After moving to the Sutherland Shire, he became a fan of the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks rugby league team and was named the club's number-one ticket holder in 2016 [26] [303]\n\n\nMarriage and children\nMorrison began dating Jenny Warren when they were both 16 [304] They married in 1990, [305] [306] [307] when Morrison was 21 and Warren was 22, and have two daughters together After multiple unsuccessful IVF treatments over a period of 14 years, their daughters were conceived naturally [304] Their daughters attend an independent Baptist school Morrison has stated that one of the reasons for this choice was so that he could avoid \"the values of others being imposed on my children.\" [308]\n\n\nReligious beliefs\nMorrison was raised in the Presbyterian Church of Australia, [309] which partly merged into the Uniting Church when he was a child He later became a Pentecostal and now attends the Horizon Church, [310] which is affiliated with the Australian Christian Churches [22] Morrison was Australia's first Pentecostal prime minister [311] As a Pentecostal and evangelical church, Horizon is not a mainstream church in Australia Some members believe in divine healing, and practise \"speaking in tongues\", which is seen as a miraculous gift from God [312]\n\n\nHealth\nIn 2024, Morrison revealed he had been prescribed medication for anxiety during his premiership, which he blamed on \"pure physical exhaustion\" and the \"unrelenting and callous brutality of politics\" [318]\n\n\nHonours\n\n\nForeign honours\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal

Developed by Ukraine, the missile is designed to be used by the Ukrainian military as a deterrent against any potential naval threats.\n\n## Development\n\nThe Neptune cruise missile was first revealed at the 2015 Arms and Security international exhibition in Kyiv. The system is designed to be a subsonic anti-ship missile, capable of engaging targets at a distance of up to 300 kilometers. The missile is designed to be launched from a variety of platforms, including ships and land-based launchers.\n\n## Operational History\n\nOn 3 April 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Ukrainian sources claimed that the Russian frigate Admiral Essen had been damaged by Ukrainian forces.

The missile has demonstrated its effectiveness in engaging and destroying naval targets, and its high-speed and maneuverability have made it a valuable asset for the Ukrainian military.\n\n## Design\n\nThe Neptune cruise missile uses a solid-fuel booster rocket to launch it into the air. After the fuel is expended, the rocket stage falls away and the jet engine takes over, providing the necessary thrust. The missile has a cross-shaped hard wing, which provides stability and control during flight.

like the F-105 Thunderchief, were found to be vulnerable to older MiG-17s and more advanced MiGs which were much more maneuverable [4] In order to regain the limited air superiority enjoyed over Vietnam, the US refocused on air combat using the F-4 Phantom multirole fighter, while the Soviet Union developed the MiG-23 in response Towards the end of the 1960s, the USAF started the \"F-X\" program to produce a fighter dedicated to air superiority, which led to the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle being ordered for production in late 1969 [5]\n\n\nIntroduction and improvements\nIn the West, the new fighter was given the NATO reporting name \"Fulcrum-A\" because the pre-production MiG-29A, which should have logically received this designation, remained unknown in the West at that time The Soviet Union did not assign official names to most of its aircraft, although nicknames were common  Unusually, some Soviet pilots found the MiG-29's NATO reporting name, \"Fulcrum\", to be a flattering description of the aircraft's intended purpose, and it is sometimes unofficially used in Russian service [12]\n\n\nReplacement\nOn 11 December 2013, Russian deputy prime minister Dmitry Rogozin revealed that Russia was planning to build a new fighter to replace the MiG-29 The Sukhoi Su-27 and its derivatives were to be replaced by the Sukhoi Su-57, but a different design was needed to replace the lighter MiGs A previous attempt to develop a MiG-29 replacement, the MiG 1.44 demonstrator, failed in the 1990s [citation needed] The concept came up again in 2001 with interest from India, but they later opted for a variant of the Su-57 Air Force commanders have hinted at the possibility of a single-engine airframe that uses the Su-57's engine, radar, and weapons primarily for Russian service [18] This has since been revealed to be the Sukhoi Su-75 Checkmate [citation needed]\n\n\nDesign\nSharing its origins in the original PFI requirements issued by TsAGI, the MiG-29 has broad aerodynamic similarities to the Sukhoi Su-27, but with some notable differences  The MiG-29 has a mid-mounted swept wing with blended leading-edge root extensions (LERXs) swept at around 40¬∞; there are swept tailplanes and two vertical fins, mounted on booms outboard of the engines Automatic slats are mounted on the leading edges of the wings; they are four-segment on early models and five-segment on some later variants On the trailing edge, there are maneuvering flaps and wingtip ailerons [19]\n\n\nPowerplant and range\nThe MiG-29 has two widely spaced Klimov RD-33 turbofan engines, each rated at 50 kilonewtons (11,200¬†lbf) dry and 81.3 kilonewtons (18,300¬†lbf) in afterburner The space between the engines generates lift, thereby reducing effective wing loading, hence improving maneuverability The engines are fed through intake ramps fitted under the leading-edge extensions (LERXs), which have variable ramps to allow high-Mach speeds Due to their relatively short combustor, the engines produce noticeably heavier smoke than their contemporaries As an adaptation to rough-field operations, the main air inlet can be closed completely and the auxiliary air inlet on the upper fuselage can be used for takeoff, landing and low-altitude flying, preventing ingestion of ground debris Thereby the engines receive air through louvers on the LERXs which open automatically when intakes are closed However the latest variant of the family, the MiG-35, eliminated these dorsal louvers, and adopted the mesh screens design in the main intakes, similar to those fitted to the Su-27 [21]\n\n\nCockpit\nThe cockpit features a conventional centre stick and left hand throttle controls The pilot sits in a Zvezda K-36DM ejection seat.\n\n\nSensors\nThe baseline MiG-29 9.12 has a Phazotron RLPK-29 radar fire control system which includes the N019 Sapfir 29 look-down/shoot-down coherent pulse-Doppler radar and the Ts100.02-02 digital computer [25]\n\n\nArmament\nArmament for the MiG-29 includes a single GSh-30-1 30¬†mm (1.18¬†in) cannon in the port wing root This originally had a 150-round magazine, which was reduced to 100 rounds in later variants, which only allows a few seconds of firing before running out of ammo Original production MiG-29 aircraft cannot fire the cannon when carrying a centerline fuel tank as it blocks the shell ejection port This was corrected in the MiG-29S and later versions.\n\n\nOperational history\nWhile the MiG-29's true capabilities could only be estimated from the time it first appeared In 1977 until the mid-1980s, a combination of persistent intelligence and increasing access afforded by the Soviet foreign sales effort allowed a true appreciation of its capabilities Early MiG-29s were very agile aircraft, capable of rivaling the performance of contemporary F-18 and F-16 aircraft However, their relatively low fuel capacity relegated them to short-range air defense missions  Lacking HOTAS and an inter-aircraft data link, and requiring a very intensive \"heads-down\" approach to operating cockpit controls, the early MiG-29 denied pilots the kind of situational awareness routinely enjoyed by pilots operating comparable US aircraft Analysts and Western pilots who flew examples of the MiG-29 thought this likely prevented even very good pilots from harnessing the plane's full combat capability Later MiG-29s were upgraded to improve their capabilities [30]  The Soviet Union exported MiG-29s to several countries Because 4th-generation fighter aircraft require the pilots to have extensive training, air-defense

seen in the West when the Soviet Union displayed the aircraft in Finland on 2 July 1986 Two MiG-29s were also displayed at the Farnborough Airshow in Britain in September 1988 The following year, the aircraft conducted flying displays at the 1989 Paris Air Show where it was involved in a non-fatal crash during the first weekend of the show [32] The Paris Air Show display was only the second display of Soviet fighters at an international air show since the 1930s Western observers were impressed by its apparent capability and exceptional agility Following the disintegration of the Soviet Union, most of the MiG-29s entered service with the newly formed Russian Air Force.\n\n\nRussia\nIn July 1993, two MiG-29s of the Russian Air Force collided in mid-air and crashed away from the public at the Royal International Air Tattoo No one on the ground sustained any serious injuries, and the two pilots ejected and landed safely [33]\n\n\nUkraine\nIn April 2014, during the Russian invasion of Crimea, 45 Ukrainian Air Force MiG-29s and 4 L-39 combat trainers were reportedly captured by Russian forces at Belbek air base Most of the planes appeared to be in inoperable condition In May, Russian troops dismantled them and shipped them back to Ukraine On 4 August 2014, the Ukrainian government stated that a number of them had been put back into service to fight in the war in the east of the country [50]\n\n\nExport\nIndia was the first international customer of the MiG-29, outside of the Warsaw Pact The Indian Air Force (IAF) placed an order for 44 aircraft (40 single-seat MiG-29

sold to Iran [184] This purchase could also provide the tactical jet fighter communities of the USAF, the USN and the USMC with a working evaluation and data for the MiG-29, and possibly for use in dissimilar air combat training Such information may prove valuable in any future conflicts and can aid in the design and testing of current and future weapons platforms In late 1997, the MiGs were delivered to the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, though many of the former Moldovan MiG-29s are believed to have been scrapped Some of

MiG-29 is a Russian-made fourth-generation jet fighter aircraft designed by the Mikoyan design bureau. It was first introduced in the 1970s and has since become one of the most widely used fighter jets in the world, serving in numerous countries.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe MiG-29 was designed to address the Soviet Union's need for a multirole fighter aircraft that could excel in air-to-air and air-to-ground combat. The aircraft's development was influenced by the Soviet Union's experiences in the Vietnam War, where they encountered difficulties with their supersonic fighter bombers. The MiG-29's design incorporated advanced aerodynamics, avionics, and propulsion systems, making it a formidable fighter jet.\n\n**Development**\n\nIn the mid-1960s, the United States Air Force (USAF) encountered difficulties over the skies of Vietnam with supersonic fighter bombers like the F-105 Thunderchief. These aircraft were vulnerable to older MiG-17s and more advanced MiGs, which were more maneuverable. To regain air superiority, the US refocused on air combat using the F-4 Phantom multirole fighter. The Soviet Union developed the MiG-23 in response, and the USAF started the \"F-X\" program to produce a fighter dedicated to air superiority, leading to the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle being ordered for production in late 1969.\n\n**Origins**\n\nThe MiG-29's origins date back to the early 1970s, when the Soviet Union began developing a new fighter aircraft to replace the MiG-23. The MiG-23 was a multirole fighter that excelled in air-to-air combat, but it had limitations in air-to-ground roles. The MiG-29 was designed to address these limitations and provide a more versatile fighter aircraft.\n\n**Introduction and improvements**\n\nIn the West, the new fighter was given the NATO reporting name \"Fulcrum-A\" because the pre-production MiG-29A, which should have logically received this designation, remained unknown in the West at that time. The Soviet Union did not assign official names to most of its aircraft, although nicknames were common. Unusually, some Soviet pilots found the MiG-29's NATO reporting name, \"Fulcrum\", to be a flattering description of the aircraft's intended purpose, and it is sometimes unofficially used in Russian service.\n\n**Replacement**\n\nOn 11 December 2013, Russian deputy prime minister Dmitry Rogozin revealed that Russia was planning to build a new fighter to replace the MiG-29. The Sukhoi Su-27 and its derivatives were to be replaced by the Sukhoi Su-57, but a different design was needed to replace the lighter MiGs. A previous attempt to develop a MiG-29 replacement, the MiG 1.44 demonstrator, failed in the 1990s. The concept came up again in 2001 with interest from India, but they later opted for a variant of the Su-57.\n\n**Design**\n\nSharing its origins in the original PFI requirements issued by TsAGI, the MiG-29 has broad aerodynamic similarities to the Sukhoi Su-27, but with some notable differences. The MiG-29 has a mid-mounted swept wing with blended leading-edge root extensions (LERXs) swept at around 40¬∞; there are swept tailplanes and two vertical fins, mounted on booms outboard of the engines. Automatic slats are mounted on the leading edges of the wings; they are four-segment on early models and five-segment on some later variants. On the trailing edge, there are maneuvering flaps and wingtip ailerons.\n\n**Powerplant and range**\n\nThe MiG-29 has two widely spaced Klimov RD-33 turbofan engines, each rated at 50 kilonewtons (11,200 lbf) dry and 81.3 kilonewtons (18,300 lbf) in afterburner. The space between the engines generates lift, thereby reducing effective wing loading, hence improving maneuverability. The engines are fed through intake ramps fitted under the leading-edge extensions (LERXs), which have variable ramps to allow high-Mach speeds. Due to their relatively short combustor, the engines produce noticeably heavier smoke than their contemporaries. As an adaptation to rough-field operations, the main air inlet can be closed completely and the auxiliary air inlet on the upper fuselage can be used for takeoff, landing and low-altitude flying, preventing ingestion of ground debris.\n\n**Cockpit**\n\nThe cockpit features a conventional centre stick and left hand throttle controls. The pilot sits in a Zvezda K-36DM ejection seat.\n\n**Sensors**\n\nThe baseline MiG-29 9.12 has a Phazotron RLPK-29 radar fire control system which includes the N019 Sapfir 29 look-down/shoot-down coherent pulse-Doppler radar and the Ts100.02-02 digital computer.\n\n**Armament**\n\nArmament for the MiG-29 includes a single GSh-30-1 30 mm (1.18 in) cannon in the port wing root. This originally had a 150-round magazine, which was reduced to 100 rounds in later variants, which only allows a few seconds of firing before running out of ammo. Original production MiG-29 aircraft cannot fire the cannon when carrying a centerline fuel tank as it blocks the shell ejection port. This was corrected in the MiG-29S and later versions.\n\n**Operational history**\n\nWhile the MiG-29's true capabilities could only be estimated from the time it first appeared in 1977 until the mid-1980s, a combination of persistent intelligence and increasing access afforded by the Soviet foreign sales effort allowed a true appreciation of its capabilities. Early MiG-29s were very agile aircraft, capable of rivaling the performance of contemporary F-18 and F-16 aircraft. However, their relatively low fuel capacity relegated them to short-range air defense missions. Lacking HOTAS and an inter-aircraft data link, and requiring a very intensive \"heads-down\" approach to operating cockpit controls, the early MiG-29 denied pilots the kind of situational awareness routinely enjoyed by pilots operating comparable US aircraft.\n\n**Soviet Union and successor states**\n\nThe MiG-29 was first publicly seen in the West when the Soviet Union displayed the aircraft in Finland on 2 July 1986. Two MiG-29s were also displayed at the Farnborough Airshow in Britain in September 1988. The following year, the aircraft conducted flying displays at the 1989 Paris Air Show where it was involved in a non-fatal crash during the first weekend of the show.\n\n**Russia**\n\nIn July 1993, two MiG-29s of the Russian Air Force collided in mid-air and crashed away from the public at the Royal International Air Tattoo. No one on the ground sustained any serious injuries, and the two pilots ejected and landed safely.\n\n**Ukraine**\n\nIn April 2014, during the Russian invasion of Crimea, 45 Ukrainian Air Force MiG-29s and 4 L-39 combat trainers were reportedly captured by Russian forces at Belbek air base. Most of the planes appeared to be in inoperable condition. In May, Russian troops dismantled them and shipped them back to Ukraine. On 4 August 2014, the Ukrainian government stated that a number of them had been put back into service to fight in the war in the east of the country.\n\n**Export**\n\nIndia was the first international customer of the MiG-29, outside of the Warsaw Pact. The Indian Air Force (IAF) placed an order for 44 aircraft (40 single-seat MiG-29 9.12Bs and four twin-seat MiG-29UBs) in 1984, and the MiG-29 was officially inducted into the IAF in 1987.

missions  Lacking HOTAS and an inter-aircraft data link, and requiring a very intensive \"heads-down\" approach to operating cockpit controls, the early MiG-29 denied pilots the kind of situational awareness routinely enjoyed by pilots operating comparable US aircraft Analysts and Western pilots who flew examples of the MiG-29 thought this likely prevented even very good pilots from harnessing the plane's full combat capability Later MiG-29s were upgraded to improve their capabilities [30]  The Soviet Union exported MiG-29s to several countries Because 4th-generation fighter aircraft require the pilots to have extensive training, air-defense infrastructure, and constant maintenance and upgrades, MiG-29s have had mixed operational history with different air forces [31]\n\n\nSoviet Union and successor states\nThe MiG-29 was first publicly seen in the West when the Soviet Union displayed the aircraft in Finland on 2 July 1986 Two MiG-29s were also displayed at the Farnborough Airshow in Britain in September 1988 The following year, the aircraft conducted flying displays at the 1989 Paris Air Show where it was involved in a non-fatal crash during the first weekend of the show [32] The Paris Air Show display was only the second display of Soviet fighters at an international air show since the 1930s Western observers were impressed by its apparent capability and exceptional agility Following the disintegration of the Soviet Union, most of the MiG-29s entered service with the newly formed Russian Air Force.\n\n\nRussia\nIn July 1993, two MiG-29s of the Russian Air Force collided in mid-air and crashed away from the public at the Royal International Air Tattoo No one on the ground sustained any serious injuries, and the two pilots ejected and landed safely [33]\n\n\nUkraine\nIn April 2014, during the Russian invasion of Crimea, 45 Ukrainian Air Force MiG-29s and 4 L-39 combat trainers were reportedly captured by Russian forces at Belbek air base Most of the planes appeared to be in inoperable condition In May, Russian troops dismantled them and shipped them back to Ukraine On 4 August 2014, the Ukrainian government stated that a number of them had been put back into service to fight in the war in the east of the country [50]\n\n\nExport\nIndia was the first international customer of the MiG-29, outside of the Warsaw Pact The Indian Air Force (IAF) placed an order for 44 aircraft (40 single-seat MiG-29 9.12Bs and four twin-seat MiG-29UBs) in 1984, and the MiG-29 was officially inducted into the IAF in 1987 In 1989, an additional 26 aircraft were ordered, and 10 more advanced MiG-29 9.13s were bought in 1994 Since then, the aircraft has undergone a series of modifications with the addition of new avionics, subsystems, turbofan engines and radars [76]\n\n\nIndia\nIndia was the first international customer of the MiG-29, outside of the Warsaw Pact The Indian Air Force (IAF) placed an order for 44 aircraft (40 single-seat

was the first European country outside the Soviet Union to operate the MiG-29 The country received 14 MiG-29 9.12As and two MiG-29UBs from the USSR in 1987 and 1988 The MiG-29s were put into service with the 127th Fighter Aviation Squadron, based at Batajnica Air Base, north of Belgrade, Serbia [102]\n\n\nGermany\nEast Germany bought 24 MiG-29s (20 MiG-29As, four MiG-29UBs), which entered service in 1988‚Äì1989 in 1./JG3 \"Wladimir Komarow\" in Preschen in Brandenburg [121] After the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and reunification of Germany in October 1990, the MiG-29s and other aircraft of the East German Air Forces of the National People's Army were integrated into the West German Luftwaffe [122] Initially the 1./JG3 kept its designation In April 1991 both 1./JG3's MiG-29 squadrons were reorganised into the MiG-29 test wing (\"Erprobungsgeschwader MiG-29\"), which became JG73 \"Steinhoff\" and was transferred to Laage near Rostock in June 1993.\n\n\nLibya\nIn 2020 it was reported that MiG-29 aircraft was flown by forces aligned with Khalifa Haftar in Libya [132] On 11 September 2020, United States Africa Command stated that two MiG-29s, operated by Russian speaking personnel, crashed in Libya due to unknown reasons, the first on 28 June 2020, the second on 7 September 2020 [133] It was announced that MiG-29s and Su-24s are to be delivered to the Libyan Air Force from Russia [134]\n\n\nPeru\nThe Peruvian Air Force acquired 21 MiG-29S fighters from Belarus in 1997, as part of a package that also included 18 Su-25 attack aircraft The following year an additional 3 MiG-29 aircraft were acquired from Russia At the same time, Peru contracted with Mikoyan to upgrade 8 aircraft to the MiG-29SMP standard, with an option to upgrade the remainder of the Peruvian inventory The Peruvian MiG-29s are based at FAP Captain Jos√© Abelardo Qui√±ones Gonz√°lez International Airport in northern Peru, equipping Escuadr√≥n A√©reo 612 (Fighter Squadron 612 \"Fighting Roosters\") [135]\n\n\nPoland\nThe first 12 MiG-29s delivered to Poland were nine MiG-29As and three MiG-29UBs in 1989‚Äì1990 The aircraft were based at Mi≈Ñsk Mazowiecki and used by the 1st Fighter Aviation Regiment, which was reorganized in 2001 as 1 Eskadra Lotnictwa Taktycznego (1 elt), or 1st Tactical Squadron (TS) In 1995‚Äì1996, 10 used examples were acquired from the Czech Republic (nine MiG-29As, one MiG-29UB) After the retirement of its MiG-23s in 1999, and MiG-21s in 2004, Poland was left for a time with only these 22 MiG-29s in the interceptor role.\n\n\nIraq\nIraq received a number of MiG-29 fighters and used them to engage Iranian equivalent opponents during the later stages of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War.\n\n\nSyria\nSyrian Arab Air Force MiG-29s have sometimes encountered Israeli fighter and reconnaissance aircraft Two Israeli F-15Cs reportedly shot down two MiG-29As on 2 June 1989 under unclear circumstances [157] [158]\n\n\nMalaysia\nThe Royal Malaysian Air Force operated 18 MiG-29N/NUB aircraft from 1995 to 2017 out of its air base in Kuantan The aircraft were modified to have an improved engine and stronger airframe to meet Malaysian requirements [164]\n\n\nNorth Korea\nThe Korean People's Air Force is believed to operate about 18 MiG-29 which are assigned to the 55th Air Regiment based at Sunchon Air Base In addition to 13 MiG-29 (9.12B) Fulcrum-As and 2 Fulcrum-B trainers that were delivered in 1987, North Korea also became the only Cold War export customer and licensed manufacturer of the Fulcrum-C [172] [page¬†needed] Called the MiG-29S-13 (9.13B) Fulcrum-C, they were delivered to North Korea from the USSR/Russia between 1991 and 1992 in knock down parts Only three S-13s were completed due to Russia refusing to supply more parts to North Korea The first locally built Fulcrum-C flew on 15 April 1993 [172] [page¬†needed] These were first encountered and photographed by the USAF in March 2003 when a pair of KPAF MiG-29s intercepted an USAF RC-135S Cobra Ball reconnaissance aircraft [173] [174]\n\n\nSudan\nThere have been occasional claims regarding the use of Sudanese Air Force MiG-29s against insurgent forces in Darfur However, whereas Mi-24 combat helicopters as well as Nanchang A-5 or, more recently, Su-25 ground-attack aircraft have been spotted and photographed on Darfurian air fields, no MiG-29s have been observed On 10 May 2008, a Darfur rebel group, the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) mounted an assault on the Sudanese capital During this action, the JEM shot down a Sudanese Air Force MiG-29 with 12.7 and 14.5¬†mm (0.500 and 0.571¬†in) heavy machine gun fire while it was attacking a convoy of vehicles in the Khartoum suburb of Omdurman The aircraft was piloted by a Russian mercenary He was killed in action as his parachute did not open after ejecting [175] [176] [177] On 14 November 2008 Sudanese Ministry of Defence admitted that Sudan had received 12 MiG-29 from Russia [178] An anonymous Russian source claimed that the aircraft had been delivered before 2004 [178]\n\n\nUnited States\nIn 1997, the United States purchased 21 Moldovan MiG-29 aircraft under the Nunn‚ÄìLugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program Fourteen were MiG-29S models, which are equipped with an active radar jammer in its spine and are capable of being armed with nuclear weapons Part of the United States' motive to purchase these aircraft was to prevent them from being sold to Iran [184] This purchase could also provide the tactical jet fighter communities of the USAF, the USN and the USMC with a working evaluation and data for the MiG-29, and possibly for use in dissimilar air combat training Such information may prove valuable in any future conflicts and can aid in the design and testing of current and future weapons platforms In late 1997, the MiGs were delivered to the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, though many of the former Moldovan MiG-29s are believed to have been scrapped Some of these MiG-29s are currently on open display at Nellis AFB, Nevada; NAS Fallon, Nevada; Goodfellow AFB, Texas; and Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.\n\n\nOthers\nA Cuban MiG-29UB shot down two Cessna 337s belonging to the organisation Brothers to the Rescue in 1996, after the aircraft approached Cuban airspace [185]\n\n\nPotential operators and failed bids\nBefore the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Finland had a policy of splitting procurement of armaments between western, eastern and domestic suppliers The MiG-29 was planned to replace the Finnish Air Force's MiG-21 fighters up to 1988, with test flights having been done [192]\n\n\nVariants\nCzech Republic\n\n\nOriginal Soviet variants\nCzech Republic\n\n\nUpgraded

sometimes simply referred to as \"Afgan\" (Russian: –ê—Ñ–≥–∞–Ω), with the understanding that this refers to the war (just as the Vietnam War is often called \"Vietnam\" or just \"'Nam\" in the United States) [35] It is also known as the Afghan jihad, especially by the non-Afghan volunteers of the Mujahideen.\n\n\nBackground\nIn the 19th century, the British Empire was fearful that the Russian Empire would invade Afghanistan and use it to threaten the large British colonies in India This regional rivalry was called the \"Great Game\" In 1885, Russian forces seized a disputed oasis south of the Oxus River from Afghan forces, which became known as the Panjdeh Incident The border was agreed by the joint Anglo-Russian Afghan Boundary Commission of 1885‚Äì87 The Russian interest in Afghanistan continued through the Soviet era, with billions in economic and military aid sent to Afghanistan between 1955 and 1978 [36]\n\n\nRussian interest in Central Asia\nIn the 19th century, the

Russian forces seized a disputed oasis south of the Oxus River from Afghan forces, which became known as the Panjdeh Incident The border was agreed by the joint Anglo-Russian Afghan Boundary Commission of 1885‚Äì87 The Russian interest in Afghanistan continued through the Soviet era, with billions in economic and military aid sent to Afghanistan between 1955 and 1978 [36]\n\n\nSoviet‚ÄìAfghan relations post-1920s\nThe Soviet Union (USSR) had been a major power broker and influential mentor in Afghan politics, its involvement ranging from civil-military infrastructure to Afghan society [42] Since 1947, Afghanistan had been under the influence of the Soviet government and received large amounts of aid, economic assistance, military equipment training and military hardware from the Soviet Union Economic assistance and aid had been provided to Afghanistan as early as 1919, shortly after the Russian Revolution and when the regime was facing the Russian Civil War Provisions were given in the form of small arms, ammunition, a few aircraft, and (according to debated Soviet sources) a million gold rubles to support the resistance during the Third Anglo-Afghan War in 1919 In 1942, the USSR again moved to strengthen the Afghan Armed Forces by providing small arms and aircraft and establishing training centers in Tashkent, Uzbek SSR Soviet-Afghan military cooperation began on a regular basis in 1956, and further agreements were made in the 1970s, which saw the USSR send advisers and specialists The Soviets also had interests in the energy resources of Afghanistan, including oil and natural gas exploration from the 1950s and 1960s [43] The USSR began to import Afghan gas from 1968 onwards [44] Between 1954 and 1977, the Soviet Union provided Afghanistan with economic aid worth of about 1 billion rubles [45]\n\n\nAfghanistan-Pakistan border\nIn the 19th century, with the Czarist Russian forces moving closer to the Pamir Mountains, near the border with British India, civil servant Mortimer Durand was sent to outline a border, likely in order to control the Khyber Pass The demarcation of the mountainous region resulted in an agreement, signed with the Afghan Emir, Abdur Rahman Khan, in 1893 It became known as the Durand Line [46]\n\n\n1960s‚Äì1970s: Proxy war\nIn 1954, the United States began selling arms to its ally Pakistan, while refusing an Afghan request to buy arms, out of fear that the Afghans would use the weapons against Pakistan [52] As a consequence, Afghanistan, though officially neutral in the Cold War, drew closer to India and the Soviet Union, which were willing to sell them weapons [52] In 1962, China defeated India in a border war, and as a result, China formed an alliance with Pakistan against their common enemy, India, pushing Afghanistan even closer to India and the Soviet Union.\n\n\n1973 coup d'√©tat\nIn 1973, Daoud Khan, supported by Soviet-trained Afghan Army officers and a large base of the Afghan Commando Forces, seized power from the King in a bloodless coup, and established the first Afghan republic [53] Following his return to power, Daoud revived his Pashtunistan policy and for the first time started proxy warring against Pakistan [54] by supporting anti-Pakistani groups and providing them with arms, training and sanctuaries [51] The Pakistani government of prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was alarmed by this [55] The Soviet Union also supported Daoud Khan's militancy against Pakistan [51] as they wanted to weaken Pakistan, which was an ally of both the United States and China However, it did not openly try to create problems for Pakistan as that would damage the Soviet Union's relations with other Islamic countries, hence it relied on Daoud Khan to weaken Pakistan They had the same thought regarding Iran, another major U.S ally The Soviet Union also believed that the hostile behaviour of Afghanistan against Pakistan and Iran could alienate Afghanistan from the west, and Afghanistan would be forced into a closer relationship with the Soviet Union [56] The pro-Soviet Afghans (such as the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA)) also supported Daoud Khan's hostility towards Pakistan, as they believed that a conflict with Pakistan would induce Afghanistan to seek aid from the Soviet Union As a result, the pro-Soviet Afghans would be able to establish their influence over Afghanistan [57]\n\n\nSaur Revolution of 1978\nThe Marxist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan's strength grew considerably after its foundation In 1967, the PDPA split into two rival factions, the Khalq (Masses) faction headed by Nur Muhammad Taraki and the Parcham (Flag) faction led by Babrak Karmal [61] [62] Symbolic of the different backgrounds of the two factions were the fact that Taraki's father was a poor Pashtun herdsman while Karmal's father was a Tajik general in the Royal Afghan Army [62] More importantly, the radical Khalq faction believed in rapidly transforming Afghanistan, if necessary even using violence, from a feudal system into a Communist society, while the moderate Parcham faction favored a more gradualist and gentler approach, arguing that Afghanistan was simply not ready for Communism and would not be for some time [62] The Parcham faction favored building up the PDPA as a mass party in support of the Daoud Khan government, while the Khalq faction were organized in the Leninist style as a small, tightly organized elite group, allowing the latter to enjoy ascendancy over the former [62] In 1971, the U.S Embassy in Kabul reported that there had been increasing leftist activity in the country, attributed to disillusionment of social and economic conditions, and the poor response from the Kingdom's leadership It added that the PDPA was \"perhaps the most disgruntled and organized of the country's leftist groups.\" [63]\n\n\n\"Red Terror\" of the revolutionary government\n\"We only need one million people to make the revolution It doesn't matter what happens to the rest We need the land, not the people.\"\n\n\nAffairs with the USSR after the revolution\nEven before the revolutionaries came to power, Afghanistan was \"a militarily and politically neutral nation, effectively dependent on the Soviet Union.\" [63] A treaty, signed in December 1978, allowed the Democratic Republic to call upon the Soviet Union for military support [78]\n\n\nInitiation of the rebellion\nIn 1978, the Taraki government initiated a series of reforms, including a radical modernization of the traditional Islamic civil law, especially marriage law, aimed at \"uprooting feudalism\" in Afghan society [86] [page¬†needed] The government brooked no opposition to the reforms [71] and responded with violence to unrest Between April 1978 and the Soviet Intervention of December 1979, thousands of prisoners, perhaps as many as 27,000, were executed at the notorious [73] Pul-e-Charkhi prison, including many village mullahs and headmen [72] Other members of the traditional elite, the religious establishment and intelligentsia fled the country [72]\n\n\nPakistan‚ÄìU.S. relations and rebel aid\nPakistani intelligence officials began privately lobbying the U.S and its allies to send materiel assistance to the Islamist rebels Pakistani President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq's ties with the U.S had been strained during Jimmy Carter's presidency due to Pakistan's nuclear program and the execution of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in April 1979, but Carter told National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski and Secretary of State Cyrus Vance as early as January 1979 that it was vital to \"repair our relationships with Pakistan\" in light of the unrest in Iran [97] According to former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) official Robert Gates, \"the Carter administration turned to CIA¬†.. to counter Soviet and Cuban aggression in the Third World, particularly beginning in mid-1979.\" In March 1979, \"CIA sent several covert action options relating to Afghanistan to the SCC  [Special Coordination Committee]\" of the United States National Security Council At a 30 March meeting, U.S Department of Defense representative Walter B Slocombe \"asked if there was value in keeping the Afghan insurgency going, 'sucking the Soviets into a Vietnamese quagmire?'\" [98] When asked to clarify this remark, Slocombe explained: \"Well, the whole idea was that if the Soviets decided to strike at this tar baby  [Afghanistan] we had every interest in making sure that they got stuck.\" [99] Yet a 5 April memo from National Intelligence Officer Arnold Horelick warned: \"Covert action would raise the costs to the Soviets and inflame Moslem opinion against them in many countries The risk was that a substantial U.S covert aid program could raise the stakes and induce the Soviets to intervene more directly and vigorously than otherwise intended.\" [98]\n\n\nSoviet deployment, 1979\nThe Amin government, having secured a treaty in December 1978 that allowed them to call on Soviet forces, repeatedly requested the introduction of troops in Afghanistan in the spring and summer of 1979 They requested Soviet troops to provide security and to assist in the fight against the mujahideen (\"Those engaged in jihad\") rebels After the killing of Soviet technicians in Herat by rioting mobs, the Soviet government sold several Mi-24 helicopters to the Afghan military On 14 April 1979, the Afghan government requested that the USSR send 15 to 20 helicopters with their crews to Afghanistan, and on 16 June, the Soviet government responded and sent a detachment of tanks, BMPs, and crews to guard the government in Kabul and to secure the Bagram and Shindand air bases In response to this request, an airborne battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel A Lomakin, arrived at Bagram on 7 July They arrived without their combat gear, disguised as technical specialists They were the personal bodyguards for General Secretary Taraki The paratroopers were directly subordinate to the senior Soviet military advisor and did not interfere in Afghan politics Several leading politicians at the time such as Alexei Kosygin and Andrei Gromyko were against intervention.\n\n\nSoviet invasion and palace coup\nOn 31 October 1979, Soviet informants under orders from the inner circle of advisors around Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev relayed information to the Afghan Armed Forces for them to undergo maintenance cycles for their tanks and other crucial equipment Meanwhile, telecommunications links to areas outside of Kabul were severed, isolating the capital.\n\n\nInternational positions on Soviet invasion\nThe Christmas-time invasion of a practically defenseless country was shocking for the international community, and caused a sense of alarm for its neighbor Pakistan [126] On 2 January 1980 President Carter withdrew the SALT-II treaty from consideration before the Senate, [127] and on 3 January he recalled US Ambassador Thomas J Watson from Moscow [128] On 9 January the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 462 Following the resolution, the Sixth emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly took place Soviet military activities were met with strong criticism internationally, including some of its allies at the UN General Assembly (UNGA), [129] but the Soviet machine scored a victory when, in the words of political scientist William Maley, \"the General Assembly accepted the credentials of the delegation of the Soviet-installed puppet regime in Kabul which duly voted against the resolution.\" [130] The UNGA passed a resolution on 15 January by a vote of 104‚Äì18 protesting the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan [131] On 29 January foreign ministers from 34 Muslim-majority countries adopted at the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation [132] a resolution which condemned the Soviet intervention and demanded \"the immediate, urgent and unconditional withdrawal of Soviet troops\" from the Muslim nation of Afghanistan [133] [132] According to political scientist Gilles Kepel, the Soviet intervention or invasion was viewed with \"horror\" in the West, considered to be a fresh twist on the geo-political \"Great Game\" of the 19th century in which Britain feared that Russia sought access to the Indian Ocean, and posed a threat to Western security, explicitly violating the world balance of power agreed upon at Yalta in 1945 [134]\n\n\nMilitary aid\nWeapons supplies were made available through numerous countries Before the Soviet intervention, the insurgents received support from the United States, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Libya and Kuwait, albeit on a limited scale [141] [142] After the intervention, aid was substantially increased The US clandestinely purchased all of Israel's captured Soviet weapons, and then funnelled the weapons to the Mujahideen, while Egypt upgraded its army's weapons and sent the older weapons to the militants Turkey sold their World War II stockpiles to the warlords, and the British and Swiss provided Blowpipe missiles and Oerlikon anti-aircraft guns respectively, after they were found to be poor models for their own forces [143] China provided the most relevant weapons, likely due to their own experience with guerrilla warfare, and kept meticulous record of all the shipments [143] The US, Saudi and Chinese aid combined totaled between $6 billion and $12 billion [144]\n\n\nState of the Cold War\nIn the wider Cold War, drastic changes were taking place in Southwestern Asia concurrent with the 1978‚Äì1979 upheavals in Afghanistan that changed the nature of the two superpowers In February 1979, the Iranian Revolution ousted the American-backed Shah from Iran, losing the United States as one of its most powerful allies [145] The United States then deployed twenty ships in the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea including two aircraft carriers, and there were constant threats of war between the U.S and Iran [146]\n\n\nDecember 1979 ‚Äì February 1980: Occupation and national unrest\nThe first phase of the war began with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and first battles with various opposition groups [133] Soviet troops entered Afghanistan along two ground routes and one air corridor, quickly taking control of the major urban centers, military bases and strategic installations However, the presence of Soviet troops did not have the desired effect of pacifying the country On the contrary, it exacerbated nationalistic sentiment, causing the rebellion to spread further [149] Babrak Karmal, Afghanistan's new leader, charged the Soviets with causing an increase in the unrest, and demanded that the 40th Army step in and quell the rebellion, as his own army had proved untrustworthy [150] Thus, Soviet troops found themselves drawn into fighting against urban uprisings, tribal armies (called lashkar), and sometimes against mutinying Afghan Army units These forces mostly fought in the open, and Soviet airpower and artillery made short work of them [151]\n\n\nSoviet occupation, 1980‚Äì1985\nThe war now developed into a new pattern: the Soviets occupied the cities and main axis of communication, while the Afghan mujahideen, which the Soviet Army soldiers called 'Dushman,' meaning 'enemy', [156] divided into small groups and waged a guerrilla war in the mountains Almost 80 percent of the country was outside government control [157] Soviet troops were deployed in strategic areas in the northeast, especially along the road from Termez to Kabul In the west, a strong Soviet presence was maintained to counter Iranian influence Incidentally, special Soviet units would have [clarification needed] also performed secret attacks on Iranian territory to destroy suspected Mujahideen bases, and their helicopters then got engaged in shootings with Iranian jets [158] Conversely, some regions such as Nuristan, in the northeast, and Hazarajat, in the central mountains of Afghanistan, were virtually untouched by the fighting, and lived in almost complete independence.\n\n\nSoviet military operations against Afghan guerrillas\nThe war now developed into a new pattern: the Soviets occupied the cities and main axis of communication, while the Afghan mujahideen, which the Soviet Army soldiers called 'Dushman,' meaning 'enemy', [156] divided into small groups and waged a guerrilla war in the mountains Almost 80 percent of the country was outside government control [157] Soviet troops were deployed in strategic areas in the northeast, especially along the road from Termez to Kabul In the west, a strong Soviet presence was maintained to counter Iranian influence Incidentally, special Soviet units would have [clarification needed] also performed secret attacks on Iranian territory to destroy suspected Mujahideen bases, and their helicopters then got engaged in shootings with Iranian jets [158] Conversely, some regions such as Nuristan, in the northeast, and Hazarajat, in the central mountains of Afghanistan, were virtually untouched by the fighting, and lived in almost complete independence.\n\n\nReforms of the Karmal administration\nBabrak Karmal, after the invasion, promised reforms to win support from the population alienated by his ousted predecessors A temporary constitution, the Fundamental Principles of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, was adopted in April 1980 On paper, it was a democratic constitution including \"right of free expression\" and disallowing \"torture, persecution, and punishment, contrary to human dignity\" Karmal's government was formed of his fellow Parchamites along with (pro-Taraki) Khalqists, and a number of known non-communists/leftists in various ministries [153]\n\n\nMujahideen insurrection\nIn the mid-1980s, the Afghan resistance movement, assisted by the United States, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, Egypt, the People's Republic of China and others, contributed to Moscow's high military costs and strained international relations The U.S viewed the conflict in Afghanistan as an integral Cold War struggle, and the CIA provided assistance to anti-Soviet forces through the Pakistani intelligence services, in a program called Operation Cyclone [176]\n\n\nRaids inside Soviet territory\nIn an effort to foment unrest and rebellion by the Islamic populations of the Soviet Union, starting in late 1984 Director of CIA William Casey encouraged Mujahideen militants to mount sabotage raids inside the Soviet Union, according to Robert Gates, Casey's executive assistant and Mohammed Yousef, the Pakistani ISI brigadier general who was the chief for Afghan operations The rebels began cross-border raids into the Soviet Union in spring 1985 [190] [191] [192] In April 1987, three separate teams of Afghan rebels were directed by the ISI to launch coordinated raids on multiple targets across the Soviet border and extending, in the case of an attack on an Uzbek factory, as deep as over 16 kilometres (10¬†mi) into Soviet territory In response, the Soviets issued a thinly-veiled threat to invade Pakistan to stop the cross-border attacks, and no further attacks were reported [193]\n\n\nMedia reaction\nThose hopelessly brave warriors I walked with, and their families, who suffered so much for faith and freedom and who are still not free, they were truly the people of God ‚Äì Journalist Rob Schultheis, 1992 [194] [195]\n\n\nSoviet exit and change of Afghan leadership, 1985‚Äì1989\nAs early as 1983, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry began working with the Soviet Union to provide them an exit from Afghanistan, initiatives led by Foreign Minister Yaqub Ali Khan and Khurshid Kasuri Despite an active support for insurgent groups, Pakistanis remained sympathetic to the challenges faced by the Soviets in restoring the peace, eventually exploring the possibility of setting up an interim system of government under former monarch Zahir Shah, but this was not authorized by President Zia-ul-Haq due to his stance on the issue of the Durand Line.:‚Ää247‚Äì248‚Ää [207] In 1984‚Äì85, Foreign Minister Yaqub Ali Khan paid state visits to China, Saudi Arabia, Soviet Union, France, United States and the United Kingdom in order to develop a framework On 20 July 1987, the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the country was announced.\n\n\nForeign diplomatic efforts\nAs early as 1983, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry began working with the Soviet Union to provide them an exit from Afghanistan, initiatives led by Foreign Minister Yaqub Ali Khan and Khurshid Kasuri Despite an active support for insurgent groups, Pakistanis remained sympathetic to the challenges faced by the Soviets in restoring the peace, eventually exploring the possibility of setting up an interim system of government under former monarch Zahir Shah, but this was not authorized by President Zia-ul-Haq due to his stance on the issue of the Durand Line.:‚Ää247‚Äì248‚Ää [207] In 1984‚Äì85, Foreign Minister Yaqub Ali Khan paid state visits to China, Saudi Arabia, Soviet Union, France, United States and the United Kingdom in order to develop a framework On 20 July 1987, the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the country was announced.\n\n\nApril 1985 ‚Äì January 1987: Exit strategy\nThe first step of the Soviet Union's exit strategy was to transfer the burden of fighting the Mujahideen to the Afghan armed forces, with the aim of preparing them to operate without Soviet help During this phase, the Soviet contingent was restricted to supporting the DRA forces by providing artillery, air support and technical assistance, though some large-scale operations were still carried out by Soviet troops.\n\n\nMay 1986‚Äì1988: Najibullah and his reforms\nThe government of President Karmal, a puppet state, was largely ineffective It was weakened by divisions within the PDPA and the Parcham faction, and the regime's efforts to expand its base of support proved futile Moscow came to regard Karmal as a failure and blamed him for the problems Years later, when Karmal's inability to consolidate his government had become obvious, Mikhail Gorbachev, then General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, said, \"The main reason that there has been no national consolidation so far is that Comrade Karmal is hoping to continue sitting in Kabul with our help.\" [212] Karmal's consolidation plan only involved those who had not raised arms against the regime, and even demanded Soviet troops to seal the border with Pakistan before any negotiations with Mujahideen Eventually, the Soviet Union decided to dispose of Karmal from the leadership of Afghanistan [153]\n\n\nNegotiations for a coalition\nEx-king Zahir Shah remained a popular figure to most Afghans Diego Cordovez of the UN also recognized the king as a potential key to a political settlement to the war after the Soviet troops would leave Polls in 1987 showed that he was a favored figure to lead a potential coalition between the DRA regime and Mujahideen factions, as well as an opposition to the unpopular but powerful guerrilla leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who was strongly against the King's return Pakistan however was against this and refused to grant the ex-king a visa for potential negotiations with Mujahideen Pakistan's President Zia-ul-Haq and his supporters in the military were determined to put a conservative Islamic ally in power in Kabul [63]\n\n\nApril 1988: The Geneva Accords\nFollowing lengthy negotiations, the Geneva Accords was signed in 1988 between Afghanistan and Pakistan [215] Supported by the Soviet Union and the United States respectively, the two Asian countries agreed to refrain from any form of interference in each other's territory They also agreed to allow Afghan refugees in Pakistan to voluntarily return The two superpowers agreed to halt their interference in Afghanistan, which included a Soviet withdrawal [63]\n\n\nJanuary 1987 ‚Äì February 1989: Withdrawal\nThe promotion of Mikhail Gorbachev to General Secretary in 1985 and his 'new thinking' on foreign and domestic policy was likely an important factor in the Soviets' decision to withdraw Gorbachev had been attempting to remove the Soviet Union from the economic stagnation that had set in under the leadership of Brezhnev, and to reform the Soviet Union's economy and image with the Glasnost and Perestroika policies Gorbachev had also been attempting to ease cold war tensions by signing the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with the U.S in 1987 and withdrawing the troops from Afghanistan, whose presence had garnered so much international condemnation  Beijing had stipulated that a normalization of relations would have to wait until Moscow withdrew its army from Afghanistan (among other things), and in 1989 the first Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years took place [217] At the same time, Gorbachev pressured his Cuban allies in Angola to scale down activities and withdraw even though Soviet allies were faring somewhat better there [218] The Soviets also pulled many of their troops out of Mongolia in 1987, where they were also having a far easier time than in Afghanistan, and restrained the Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea to the point of an all-out withdrawal in 1988 [219] This massive withdrawal of Soviet forces from such highly contested areas shows that the Soviet government's decision to leave Afghanistan was based upon a general change in Soviet foreign policy ‚Äì from one of confrontation to avoidance of conflict wherever possible [220] [221]\n\n\nCauses of withdrawal\nSome of the causes of the Soviet Union's withdrawal from Afghanistan leading to the Afghanistan regime's eventual defeat include [231]\n\n\nFall of Najibullah government, 1992\nAfter the withdrawal of Soviet troops in 1989, the government of Mohammad Najibullah remained in power until 15 April 1992 Najibullah stepped down that day as Mujahideen guerrilla forces moved into Kabul He attempted to fly to India under the protection of the U.N but was blocked from leaving at the airport He then took refuge at a United Nations compound in Kabul After a bloody, four-year power struggle between different factions of the victorious anti-Najibullah forces, the Taliban took Kabul They stormed the U.N compound on September 26, 1996 They eventually tortured and killed Najibullah [233]\n\n\nAerial engagements\nDuring the conflict, Pakistan Air Force F-16 had shot down ten aircraft, belonging to Soviet Union, which had intruded into Pakistani territory However, the Soviet record only confirmed five kills (three Su-22s, one Su-25 and one An-26) Some sources show that PAF had shot down at least a dozen more aircraft during the war However, those kills were not officially acknowledged because they took place in Afghanistan's airspace and acknowledging those kills would mean that Afghan airspace was violated by PAF [9] In all, Pakistan Air Force F-16s had downed several MiG-23s, Su-22s, a Su-25, and an An-24 while losing only one F-16.\n\n\nAerial losses in Pakistan airspace\nDuring the conflict, Pakistan Air Force F-16 had shot down ten aircraft, belonging to Soviet Union, which had intruded into Pakistani territory However, the Soviet record only confirmed five kills (three Su-22s, one Su-25 and one An-26) Some sources show that PAF had shot down at least a dozen more aircraft during the war However, those kills were not officially acknowledged because they took place in Afghanistan's airspace and acknowledging those kills would mean that Afghan airspace was violated by PAF [9] In all, Pakistan Air Force F-16s had downed several MiG-23s, Su-22s, a Su-25, and an An-24 while losing only one F-16.\n\n\nStinger missiles and the \"Stinger effect\"\nWhether the introduction of the personal, portable, infrared-homing \"Stinger\" surface-to-air missile in September 1986 was a turning point in the war is disputed.\nMany Western military analysts credit the Stinger with a kill ratio of about 70% and with responsibility for most of the over 350 Soviet or Afghan government aircraft and helicopters downed in the last two years of the war [234] Some military analysts considered it a \"game changer\" and coined the term \"Stinger effect\" to describe it [235]\nCongressman Charlie Wilson claimed that before the Stinger the Mujahideen never won a set piece battle with the Soviets, but after it was introduced, the Mujahideen never again lost one [236]\n\n\nWar crimes\nHuman Rights Watch organization concluded that the Soviet Red Army and its communist-allied Afghan Army perpetrated war crimes and crimes against humanity in Afghanistan, intentionally targeting civilians and civilian areas for attack, and killing and torturing prisoners [241]\n\n\nMassacres\nThe army of the Soviet Union killed large numbers of Afghans to suppress their resistance In one notable incident the Soviet Army committed mass killing of civilians in the summer of 1980 [245] To separate the Mujahideen from the local populations and eliminate their support, the Soviet army killed many civilians, drove many more Afghans from their homes, and used scorched-earth tactics to prevent their return They used booby traps, mines, and chemical substances throughout the country [245] The Soviet army indiscriminately killed combatants and non-combatants to terrorize local populations into submission [245] The provinces of Nangarhar, Ghazni, Laghman, Kunar, Zabul, Kandahar, Badakhshan, Logar, Paktia and Paktika witnessed extensive depopulation programmes by the Soviet forces [243]\n\n\nRape\nThe Soviet forces abducted Afghan women in helicopters while flying in the country in search of Mujahideen [249] [250] [251] In November 1980 a number of such incidents had taken place in various parts of the country, including Laghman and Kama Soviet soldiers as well as KhAD agents kidnapped young women from the city of Kabul and the areas of Darul Aman and Khair Khana, near the Soviet garrisons, to rape them [252] Women who were taken and raped by Soviet soldiers were considered 'dishonoured' by their families if they returned home [253] Deserters from the Soviet Army in 1984 also reported the atrocities by Soviet troops on Afghan women and children, including rape [254]\n\n\nScorched-earth tactics and wanton destruction\nIrrigation systems, crucial to agriculture in Afghanistan's arid climate, were destroyed by aerial bombing and strafing by Soviet or government forces In the worst year of the war, 1985, well over half of all the farmers who remained in Afghanistan had their fields bombed, and over one quarter had their irrigation systems destroyed and their livestock shot by Soviet or government troops, according to a survey conducted by Swedish relief experts [255]\n\n\nUse of chemical weapons\nThere have also been numerous reports of illegal chemical weapons, including mycotoxins, being used by Soviet forces in Afghanistan, often indiscriminately against civilians [258]\n\n\nTorture\nAmnesty International concluded that the communist-controlled Afghan government used widespread torture against inmates (officials, teachers, businessmen and students suspected of having ties to the rebels) in interrogation centers in Kabul, run by the KhAD, who were beaten, subjected to electric shocks, burned with cigarettes and that some of their hair was pulled out Some died from these harsh conditions Women of the prisoners were forced to watch or were locked up in the cells with the corpses The Soviets were accused of supervising these tortures [259] [260]\n\n\nLooting\nThe Soviet soldiers were looting from the dead in Afghanistan, including stealing money, jewelry and clothes [261] During the Red Army withdrawal in February 1989, 30 to 40 military trucks crammed with Afghan historical treasures crossed into the Soviet Union, under orders from General Boris Gromov He cut an antique Tekke carpet stolen from Darul Aman Palace into several pieces and gave it to his acquaintances [262]\n\n\nForeign involvement\nThe Afghan mujahideen were backed primarily by Pakistan, the United States, Saudi Arabia, [267] and the United Kingdom making it a Cold War proxy war [268] Out of the countries that supported the Mujahideen, the U.S and Saudi Arabia offered the greatest financial support [265] [269] [270] However, private donors and religious charities throughout the Muslim world‚Äîparticularly in the Persian Gulf‚Äîraised considerably more funds for the Afghan rebels than any foreign government; [271] [272] [273] Jason Burke recounts that \"as little as 25 per cent of the money for the Afghan jihad was actually supplied directly by states.\" [274] Saudi Arabia was heavily involved in the war effort and matched the United States' contributions dollar-for-dollar in public funds Saudi Arabia also gathered an enormous amount of money for the Afghan mujahideen in private donations that amounted to about $20 million per month at their peak [275] [276]\n\n\nSpillover\nThe Mujahideen launched multiple raids into the Soviet Union in an effort to foment unrest and rebellion by the Islamic populations of the Soviet Union, starting in late 1984 Director of CIA William Casey encouraged Mujahideen militants to mount sabotage raids inside the Soviet Union, according to Robert Gates, Casey's executive assistant and Mohammed Yousef, the Pakistani ISI brigadier general who was the chief for Afghan operations The rebels began cross-border raids into the Soviet Union in Spring 1985 [190] [191] [192]\n\n\nRaids inside the Soviet Union\nThe Mujahideen launched multiple raids into the Soviet Union in an effort to foment unrest and rebellion by the Islamic populations of the Soviet Union, starting in late 1984 Director of CIA

Soviet aircraft intruded into Pakistani airspace multiple times and Pakistan Air Force F-16 had shot down ten aircraft, belonging to Soviet Union, which had intruded into Pakistani territory However, the Soviet record only confirmed five plane kills (three Su-22s, one Su-25 and one An-26) and 4 helicopter (Mi-8) kills Some sources show that PAF had shot down at least a dozen more aircraft during the war However, those kills were not officially acknowledged because they took place in Afghanistan's airspace and acknowledging those kills would mean that Afghan airspace was violated by PAF [9] In all, Pakistan Air Force F-16s had downed 3 Su-22,1 Su-25,2 Mig-23,2 An-26, and Several Mi-8 while 1 Mig-23 was damaged while losing only one F-16 [269]\n\n\nTerror campaign in Pakistan\nThe KhAD-KGB campaign in Pakistan was a joint campaign in which the Afghan KhAD‚Äôs foreign \"Tenth Directorate\" [283] and the Soviet KGB targeted Pakistan using prostitution spy rings, terror attacks, hijackings, serial killings, assassinations and the dissemination of propaganda to dissuade Pakistan from supporting the Afghan Mujahideen [284]\n\n\nMiram Shah incident\nOn 2 April 1986, the 38th commando brigade of Democratic Republic of Afghanistan accidentally landed inside Pakistan territory during the Second Battle of Zhawar The strike force, in the darkness of night, accidentally landed near Miram Shah in Pakistan instead of Zhawar The force was surrounded and 120 soldiers were taken prisoner and 6 Mi-8 helicopters were captured.\n\n\nBadaber uprising\nIn between 26 and 27 April 1985, in Badaber, Pakistan, an armed rebellion was instigated by Soviet and Afghan prisoners of war who were being held at the Badaber fortress near Peshawar, Pakistan The prisoners fought the Afghan Mujahideen of the Jamiat-e Islami party and the Pakistani XI Corps supported by American CIA advisors in an attempt to escape but the rebellion was squashed and all POWs were killed.\n\n\nRaid inside Iran\nOn 5 April 1982, Soviet forces accidentally infiltrated Iranian territory, in which Soviet forces strayed from the target of a Mujahideen base in southern Afghanistan and accidentally destroyed an asphalt factory in Iran [285] Iranian security forces attacked this strike force by using tanks and aircraft destroying two Soviet Mi-8 helicopters and damaging many more.\n\n\nImpact\nBetween 25 December 1979, and 15 February 1989, a total of 620,000 soldiers served with the forces in Afghanistan (though there were only 80,000‚Äì104,000 serving at one time): 525,000 in the Army, 90,000 with border troops and other KGB sub-units, 5,000 in independent formations of MVD Internal Troops, and police forces [citation needed] A further 21,000 personnel were with the Soviet troop contingent over the same period doing various white collar and blue-collar jobs.\n\n\nSoviet personnel strengths and casualties\nBetween 25 December 1979, and 15 February 1989, a total of 620,000 soldiers served with the forces in Afghanistan (though there were only 80,000‚Äì104,000 serving at one time): 525,000 in the Army, 90,000 with border troops and other KGB sub-units, 5,000 in independent formations of MVD Internal Troops, and police forces [citation needed] A further 21,000 personnel were with the Soviet troop contingent over the same period doing various white collar and blue-collar jobs.\n\n\nCasualties and destruction in Afghanistan\nThe war resulted in the deaths of approximately 3,000,000 Afghans, [291] Civilian death and destruction from the war was massive and detrimental Estimates of Afghan civilian deaths vary from 562,000 [276] to 2,000,000 [28] [29] By one estimate, at least 800,000 Afghans were killed during the Soviet occupation [292] 5 million Afghans fled to Pakistan and Iran, 1/3 of the prewar population of the country, and another 2 million were displaced within the country, making it one of the largest refugee crises in history In the 1980s, half of all refugees in the world were Afghan [255] In his report, Felix Ermacora, the UN Special Rapporteur to Afghanistan, enumerated 32,755 killed civilians, 1,834 houses and 74 villages destroyed, and 3,308 animals killed in the first nine months of 1985 [293] Data cited by the World Bank shows that Afghanistan's population declined from 13.4 million (1979) to 11.8 million (1989) during the decade of Soviet occupation [294]\n\n\nRefugees\n5.5 million Afghans were made refugees by the war‚Äîa full one third of the country's pre-war population‚Äîfleeing the country to Pakistan or Iran [255] Another estimate states 6.2 million refugees [321] By the end of 1981, the UN High Commission for Refugees reported that Afghans represented the largest group of refugees in the world [301] [28] [29]\n\n\nEffect on Afghan society\nThe legacy of the war introduced a culture of guns, drugs and terrorism in Afghanistan The traditional power structure was also changed in favor of the powerful Mujahideen militias: [153]\n\n\nAftermath\nAccording to scholars Rafael Reuveny and Aseem Prakash, the war contributed to the fall of the Soviet Union by undermining the image of the Red Army as invincible, undermining Soviet legitimacy, and by creating new forms of political participation [333] [334] [335] On the other hand, the costs for the Soviet Union were not overwhelmingly large compared to other commitments [336] The CIA estimated in 1987 that the  costs amounted to about 2.5 percent of the Soviet military spending per year [337] According to historian Sergey Radchenko there is no evidence that the Afghanistan war bankrupted the USSR The Soviet Union spent about $7.5 billion between 1984 and 1987 but this number was negligible compared to the annual military budget of roughly $128 billion [338] [339] The decision to withdraw was made based on a number of political factors [340] The studies about the dissolution of the Soviet Union by historians Stephen Kotkin and Vladislav Zubok identify mainly internal reasons for the collapse and mention the Afghanistan war only in passing [341] [342]\n\n\nFall of the Soviet Union\nAccording to scholars Rafael Reuveny and

Afghanistan war only in passing [341] [342]\n\n\nCivil war\nThe war did not end with the withdrawal of the Soviet Army The Soviet Union left Afghanistan deep in winter, with intimations of panic among Kabul officials The Afghan mujahideen were poised to attack provincial towns and cities and eventually Kabul, if necessary General Secretary Mohammed Najibullah's government, though failing to win popular support, territory, or international recognition, was able to remain in power until 1992 Ironically, until demoralized by the defections of its senior officers, the Afghan Army had achieved a level of performance it had never reached under direct Soviet tutelage Kabul had achieved a stalemate that exposed the Mujahideen's weaknesses, political and military But for nearly three years, while Najibullah's government successfully defended itself against Mujahideen attacks, factions within the government had also developed connections with its opponents.\n\n\nRise of Jihadist movements\n\"The Soviet strategy of \"rubblization\" returned the country to the Dark Ages, paving the way for a radicalization of the survivors (many of whom joined the now infamous Taliban movement) that would be realized in the decade after the Soviet departure in 1988.\"Samuel Totten & Paul Bartrop [354]\n\n\nSpread of Islamic militancy in Pakistan\nAmong the approximately three million Afghan refugees in Pakistan, thousands of children were educated in madrasa boarding schools financed by aid from the US and Gulf monarchies Since that aid was distributed according to the conservative Islamist ideological criteria of Pakistan's President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq and Saudi Arabia (and ignoring native Afghan traditions), the schools were part of networks of the favored Hizb-e-Islami party and the Pakistan Deobandi  [357] [371] (Iran provided similar help to Shia Islamist groups and punishments to moderate Shia nationalist Afghans [372])\n\n\nNotion of \"blowback\" against the U.S.\nBlowback, or unintended consequences of funding the Mujahideen, was said to have come to the United States in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the September 11 attacks [369] In the 1993 bombing, all of the participants in the bombing \"either had served in Afghanistan or were linked to a Brooklyn-based fund-raising organ for the Afghan jihad\" that was later \"revealed to be al-Qaeda's de facto U.S headquarters\" [369] Principals in the 2001 attack ‚Äì Osama Bin Laden and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed [375] ‚Äì had both fought in Afghanistan, and bin Laden was a lieutenant of Abdullah Azzam His group, al-Qaeda, returned to Afghanistan to take refuge with the Taliban after being expelled from Sudan [369] Before the 9/11 attack, al-Qaeda had bombed two U.S embassies in Africa in 1998, and nearly sank the USS Cole in Yemen in 2000 [369] However, no direct U.S aid to Bin Laden or any of his affiliates has ever been established [376]\n\n\nMedia and popular culture\nWithin Afghanistan, war rugs were a popular form of carpet designs woven by victims of the war.\n\n\nPerception in Afghanistan\nThe war has left a controversial legacy for Afghan people [377] The Mujahideen Victory Day is an annual holiday in Afghanistan on 28 April, however it is a controversial event to Afghans Some Afghans honor the fighters and sacrifice made by the Mujahideen to defeat a major power, but others view the victory as a prelude to the brutal 1990s civil war that divided the country politically and ethnically [335]\n\n\nRole of the United States\nPro-Mujahideen Afghans had seen the United States as the main power to help their cause in the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War However, after the Soviet withdrawal in 1989, a growing number of Afghans started blaming the United States for miseries This was cited as a result of continued American arming and funding of rebels against the pro-Soviet administration in Kabul Throughout 1989 and 1990, many rebel rocket attacks were fired, nowhere near military targets, that killed dozens of Afghan civilians [380] Many Afghans also reportedly felt that the U.S caused the rise of the Taliban by sending billions of dollars in funding for the rebels while leaving the country in Pakistan's hands after 1992 One Afghan ex-prisoner who was affiliated with the U.S Embassy in Kabul told the Chicago Tribune in 2001:\n\n\nPerception in the former Soviet Union\nThe war left a long legacy in the former Soviet Union and following its collapse Along with losses, it brought physical disabilities and widespread drug addiction throughout the USSR [382]\n\n\nRussian Federation\nCommemorating the intervention of 25 December 1979, in December 2009, veterans of the Soviet war in Afghanistan were honoured by the Duma or Parliament of the Russian Federation On 25 December, the lower house of the parliament defended the Soviet war in Afghanistan on the 30th anniversary of its start and praised the veterans of the conflict Differing assessments of the war \"mustn't erode the Russian people's respect for the soldiers who honestly fulfilled their duty in implementing tasks to combat international terrorism and religious extremists\" [384]\n\n\nUkraine\nAbout 25 percent of Soviet servicemen in Afghanistan were Ukrainian, numbering 160,000 of which more than 3,000 died and dozens more went missing [388]\n\n\nUzbekistan\nThe war affected many families in post-Soviet Uzbekistan who had lost children Some 64,500 young men from the Uzbek SSR were drafted in the war At least 1,522 were killed and more than 2,500 left disabled [389] The former Uzbekistani president Islam Karimov described the Afghan war as a \"major mistake\" of the Soviet Union [390]\n\n\nBelarus\nThe Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War has caused grief in the memories of Belarusians, but remains a topic rarely discussed in public It was the last war the country took part in prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 28,832 Belarusian natives were involved in the campaign and 732 died Most casualties were under 20 years old [382]\n\n\nMoldova\nAround 12,500 residents of the Moldavian SSR served during the war Of those, 301 Moldovans died in the war [391] The Union of Veterans of the War in Afghanistan of the Republic of Moldova is a veteran's group based in Moldova that advocates for the well-being of veterans [392] On 15 May 2000, after the Government's initiative to abolish benefits for veterans of the war in Afghanistan, sympathizers went to Great National Assembly Square In 2001, the Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova, which came to power, radically changed the position of all veterans in the country [393] 15 February is celebrated as the Day of Commemoration of those killed in the War in Afghanistan [394] The main ceremony is held at the memorial \"Sons of the Motherland ‚Äì Eternal Memory\".\n\n\nNotes\nThe Afghans are among the latest victims of genocide by a superpower Large

Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and the Soviet Union, supported by the Afghan communist government. The war lasted from 1979 to 1989 and resulted in the deaths of approximately 3,000,000 Afghans.\n\n**Background**\n\nIn the 19th century, the British Empire was fearful that the Russian Empire would invade Afghanistan and use it to threaten the large British colonies in India. This regional rivalry was called the \"Great Game\". In 1885, Russian forces seized a disputed oasis south of the Oxus River from Afghan forces, which became known as the Panjdeh Incident. The border was agreed by the joint Anglo-Russian Afghan Boundary Commission of 1885‚Äì87.\n\n**Russian interest in Central Asia**\n\nIn the 19th century, the British Empire was fearful that the Russian Empire would invade Afghanistan and use it to threaten the large British colonies in India.

The border was agreed by the joint Anglo-Russian Afghan Boundary Commission of 1885‚Äì87.\n\n**Soviet‚ÄìAfghan relations post-1920s**\n\nThe Soviet Union had been a major power broker and influential mentor in Afghan politics, its involvement ranging from civil-military infrastructure to Afghan society. Since 1947, Afghanistan had been under the influence of the Soviet government and received large amounts of aid, economic assistance, military equipment training and military hardware from the Soviet Union.\n\n**Afghanistan-Pakistan border**\n\nIn the 19th century, with the Czarist Russian forces moving closer to the Pamir Mountains, near the border with British India, civil servant Mortimer Durand was sent to outline a border, likely in order to control the Khyber Pass. The demarcation of the mountainous region resulted in an agreement, signed with the Afghan Emir, Abdur Rahman Khan, in 1893. It became known as the Durand Line.\n\n**1960s‚Äì1970s: Proxy war**\n\nIn 1954, the United States began selling arms to its ally Pakistan, while refusing an Afghan request to buy arms, out of fear that the Afghans would use the weapons against Pakistan. As a consequence, Afghanistan, though officially neutral in the Cold War, drew closer to India and the Soviet Union, which were willing to sell them weapons.\n\n**1973 coup d'√©tat**\n\nIn 1973, Daoud Khan, supported by Soviet-trained Afghan Army officers and a large base of the Afghan Commando Forces, seized power from the King in a bloodless coup, and established the first Afghan republic. Following his return to power, Daoud revived his Pashtunistan policy and for the first time started proxy warring against Pakistan by supporting anti-Pakistani groups and providing them with arms, training, and sanctuaries.\n\n**Saur Revolution of 1978**\n\nThe Marxist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan's strength grew considerably after its foundation. In 1967, the PDPA split into two rival factions, the Khalq (Masses) faction headed by Nur Muhammad Taraki and the Parcham (Flag) faction led by Babrak Karmal. The Parcham faction favored building up the PDPA as a mass party in support of the Daoud Khan government.\n\n**Mujahideen insurrection**\n\nIn the mid-1980s, the Afghan resistance movement, assisted by the United States, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, Egypt, the People's Republic of China, and others, contributed to Moscow's high military costs and strained international relations.\n\n**Raids inside the Soviet Union**\n\nThe Mujahideen launched multiple raids into the Soviet Union in an effort to foment unrest and rebellion by the Islamic populations of the Soviet Union, starting in late 1984.

(Russian: –ê—Ñ–≥–∞–Ω), with the understanding that this refers to the war (just as the Vietnam War is often called \"Vietnam\" or just \"'Nam\" in the United States) [35] It is also known as the Afghan jihad, especially by the non-Afghan volunteers of the Mujahideen.\n\n\nBackground\nIn the 19th century, the British Empire was fearful that the Russian Empire would invade Afghanistan and use

a major power broker and influential mentor in Afghan politics, its involvement ranging from civil-military infrastructure to Afghan society [42] Since 1947, Afghanistan had been under the influence of the Soviet government and received large amounts of aid, economic assistance, military equipment training and military hardware from the Soviet Union Economic assistance and aid had been provided to Afghanistan as early as 1919, shortly after the Russian Revolution and when the regime was facing the Russian Civil War Provisions were given in the form of small arms, ammunition, a few aircraft, and (according to debated Soviet sources) a million gold rubles to support the resistance during the Third Anglo-Afghan War in 1919 In 1942, the USSR again moved to strengthen the Afghan Armed Forces by providing small arms and aircraft and establishing training centers in Tashkent, Uzbek SSR Soviet-Afghan military cooperation began on a regular basis in 1956, and further agreements were made in the 1970s, which saw the USSR send advisers and specialists The Soviets also had interests in the energy resources of Afghanistan, including oil and natural gas exploration from the 1950s and 1960s [43] The USSR began to import Afghan gas from 1968 onwards [44] Between 1954 and 1977, the Soviet Union provided Afghanistan with economic aid worth of about 1 billion rubles [45]\n\n\nAfghanistan-Pakistan border\nIn the 19th century, with the Czarist Russian forces moving closer to the Pamir Mountains, near the border with British India, civil servant Mortimer Durand was sent to outline a border, likely in order to control the Khyber Pass The demarcation of the mountainous region resulted in an agreement, signed with the Afghan Emir, Abdur Rahman Khan, in 1893 It became known as the Durand Line [46]\n\n\n1960s‚Äì1970s: Proxy war\nIn 1954, the United States began selling arms to its ally Pakistan, while refusing an Afghan request to buy arms, out of fear that the Afghans would use the weapons against Pakistan [52] As a consequence, Afghanistan, though officially neutral in the Cold War, drew closer to India and the Soviet Union, which were willing to sell them weapons [52] In 1962, China defeated India in a border war, and as a result, China formed an alliance with Pakistan against their common enemy, India, pushing Afghanistan even closer to India and the Soviet Union.\n\n\n1973 coup d'√©tat\nIn 1973, Daoud Khan, supported by Soviet-trained Afghan Army officers and a large base of the Afghan Commando Forces, seized power from the King in a bloodless coup, and established the first Afghan republic [53] Following his return to power, Daoud revived his Pashtunistan policy and for the first time started proxy warring against Pakistan [54] by supporting anti-Pakistani groups and providing them with arms, training and sanctuaries [51] The Pakistani government of prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was alarmed by this [55] The Soviet Union also supported Daoud Khan's militancy against Pakistan [51] as they wanted to weaken Pakistan, which was an ally of both the United States and China However, it did not openly try to create problems for Pakistan as that would damage the Soviet Union's relations with other Islamic countries, hence it relied on Daoud Khan to weaken Pakistan They had the same thought regarding Iran, another major U.S ally The Soviet Union also believed that the hostile behaviour of Afghanistan against Pakistan and Iran could alienate Afghanistan from the west, and Afghanistan would be forced into a closer relationship with the Soviet Union [56] The pro-Soviet Afghans (such as the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA)) also supported Daoud Khan's hostility towards Pakistan, as they believed that a conflict with Pakistan would induce Afghanistan to seek aid from the Soviet Union As a result, the pro-Soviet Afghans would be able to establish their influence over Afghanistan [57]\n\n\nSaur Revolution of 1978\nThe Marxist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan's strength grew considerably after its foundation In 1967, the PDPA split into two rival factions, the Khalq (Masses) faction headed by Nur Muhammad Taraki and the Parcham (Flag) faction led by Babrak Karmal [61] [62] Symbolic of the different backgrounds of the two factions were the fact that Taraki's father was a poor Pashtun herdsman while Karmal's father was a Tajik general in the Royal Afghan Army [62] More importantly, the radical Khalq faction believed in rapidly transforming Afghanistan, if necessary even using violence, from a feudal system into a Communist society, while the moderate Parcham faction favored a more gradualist and gentler approach, arguing that Afghanistan was simply not ready for Communism and would not be for some time [62] The Parcham faction favored building up the PDPA as a mass party in support of the Daoud Khan government, while the Khalq faction were organized in the Leninist style as a small, tightly organized elite group, allowing the latter to enjoy ascendancy over the former [62] In 1971, the U.S Embassy in Kabul reported that there had been increasing leftist activity in the country, attributed to disillusionment of social and economic conditions, and the poor response from the Kingdom's leadership It added that the PDPA was \"perhaps the most disgruntled and organized of the country's leftist groups.\" [63]\n\n\n\"Red Terror\" of the revolutionary government\n\"We only need one million people to make the revolution It doesn't matter what happens to the rest We need the land, not the people.\"\n\n\nAffairs with the USSR after the revolution\nEven before the revolutionaries came to power, Afghanistan was \"a militarily and politically neutral nation, effectively dependent on the Soviet Union.\" [63] A treaty, signed in December 1978, allowed the Democratic Republic to call upon the Soviet Union for military support [78]\n\n\nInitiation of the rebellion\nIn 1978, the Taraki government initiated a series of reforms, including a radical modernization of the traditional Islamic civil law, especially marriage law, aimed at \"uprooting feudalism\" in Afghan society [86] [page¬†needed] The government brooked no opposition to the reforms [71] and responded with violence to unrest Between April 1978 and the Soviet Intervention of December 1979, thousands of prisoners, perhaps as many as 27,000, were executed at the notorious [73] Pul-e-Charkhi prison, including many village mullahs and headmen [72] Other members of the traditional elite, the religious establishment and intelligentsia fled the country [72]\n\n\nPakistan‚ÄìU.S. relations and rebel aid\nPakistani intelligence officials began privately lobbying the U.S and its allies to send materiel assistance to the Islamist rebels Pakistani President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq's ties with the U.S had been strained during Jimmy Carter's presidency due to Pakistan's nuclear program and the execution of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in April 1979, but Carter told National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski and Secretary of State Cyrus Vance as early as January 1979 that it was vital to \"repair our relationships with Pakistan\" in light of the unrest in Iran [97] According to former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) official Robert Gates, \"the Carter administration turned to CIA¬†.. to counter Soviet and Cuban aggression in the Third World, particularly beginning in mid-1979.\" In March 1979, \"CIA sent several covert action options relating to Afghanistan to the SCC  [Special Coordination Committee]\" of the United States National Security Council At a 30 March meeting, U.S Department of Defense representative Walter B Slocombe \"asked if there was value in keeping the Afghan insurgency going, 'sucking the Soviets into a Vietnamese quagmire?'\" [98] When asked to clarify this remark, Slocombe explained: \"Well, the whole idea was that if the Soviets decided to strike at this tar baby  [Afghanistan] we had every interest in making sure that they got stuck.\" [99] Yet a 5 April memo from National Intelligence Officer Arnold Horelick warned: \"Covert action would raise the costs to the Soviets and inflame Moslem opinion against them in many countries The risk was that a substantial U.S covert aid program could raise the stakes and induce the Soviets to intervene more directly and vigorously than otherwise intended.\" [98]\n\n\nSoviet deployment, 1979\nThe Amin government, having secured a treaty in December 1978 that allowed them to call on Soviet forces, repeatedly requested the introduction of troops in Afghanistan in the spring and summer of 1979 They requested Soviet troops to provide security and to assist in the fight against the mujahideen (\"Those engaged in jihad\") rebels After the killing of Soviet technicians in Herat by rioting mobs, the Soviet government sold several Mi-24 helicopters to the Afghan military On 14 April 1979, the Afghan government requested that the USSR send 15 to 20 helicopters with their crews to Afghanistan, and on 16 June, the Soviet government responded and sent a detachment of tanks, BMPs, and crews to guard the government in Kabul and to secure the Bagram and Shindand air bases In response to this request, an airborne battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel A Lomakin, arrived at Bagram on 7 July They arrived without their combat gear, disguised as technical specialists They were the personal bodyguards for General Secretary Taraki The paratroopers were directly subordinate to the senior Soviet military advisor and did not interfere in Afghan politics Several leading politicians at the time such as Alexei Kosygin and Andrei Gromyko were against intervention.\n\n\nSoviet invasion and palace coup\nOn 31 October 1979, Soviet informants under orders from the inner circle of advisors around Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev relayed information to the Afghan Armed Forces for them to undergo maintenance cycles for their tanks and other crucial equipment Meanwhile, telecommunications links to areas outside of Kabul were severed, isolating the capital.\n\n\nInternational positions on Soviet invasion\nThe Christmas-time invasion of a practically defenseless country was shocking for the international community, and caused a sense of alarm for its neighbor Pakistan [126] On 2 January 1980 President Carter withdrew the SALT-II treaty from consideration before the Senate, [127] and on 3 January he recalled US Ambassador Thomas J Watson from Moscow [128] On 9 January the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 462 Following the resolution, the Sixth emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly took place Soviet military activities were met with strong criticism internationally, including some of its allies at the UN General Assembly (UNGA), [129] but the Soviet machine scored a victory when, in the words of political scientist William Maley, \"the General Assembly accepted the credentials of the delegation of the Soviet-installed puppet regime in Kabul which duly voted against the resolution.\" [130] The UNGA passed a resolution on 15 January by a vote of 104‚Äì18 protesting the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan [131] On 29 January foreign ministers from 34 Muslim-majority countries adopted at the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation [132] a resolution which condemned the Soviet intervention and demanded \"the immediate, urgent and unconditional withdrawal of Soviet troops\" from the Muslim nation of Afghanistan [133] [132] According to political scientist Gilles Kepel, the Soviet intervention or invasion was viewed with \"horror\" in the West, considered to be a fresh twist on the geo-political \"Great Game\" of the 19th century in which Britain feared that Russia sought access to the Indian Ocean, and posed a threat to Western security, explicitly violating the world balance of power agreed upon at Yalta in 1945 [134]\n\n\nMilitary aid\nWeapons supplies were made available through numerous countries Before the Soviet intervention, the insurgents received support from the United States, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Libya and Kuwait, albeit on a limited scale [141] [142] After the intervention, aid was substantially increased The US clandestinely purchased all of Israel's captured Soviet weapons, and then funnelled the weapons to the Mujahideen, while Egypt upgraded its army's weapons and sent the older weapons to the militants Turkey sold their World War II stockpiles to the warlords, and the British and Swiss provided Blowpipe missiles and Oerlikon anti-aircraft guns respectively, after they were found to be poor models for their own forces [143] China provided the most relevant weapons, likely due to their own experience with guerrilla warfare, and kept meticulous record of all the shipments [143] The US, Saudi and Chinese aid combined totaled between $6 billion and $12 billion [144]\n\n\nState of the Cold War\nIn the wider Cold War, drastic changes were taking place in Southwestern Asia concurrent with the 1978‚Äì1979 upheavals in Afghanistan that changed the nature of the two superpowers In February 1979, the Iranian Revolution ousted the American-backed Shah from Iran, losing the United States as one of its most powerful allies [145] The United States then deployed twenty ships in the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea including two aircraft carriers, and there were constant threats of war between the U.S and Iran [146]\n\n\nDecember 1979 ‚Äì February 1980: Occupation and national unrest\nThe first phase of the war began with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and first battles with various opposition groups [133] Soviet troops entered Afghanistan along two ground routes and one air corridor, quickly taking control of the major urban centers, military bases and strategic installations However, the presence of Soviet troops did not have the desired effect of pacifying the country On the contrary, it exacerbated nationalistic sentiment, causing the rebellion to spread further [149] Babrak Karmal, Afghanistan's new leader, charged the Soviets with causing an increase in the unrest, and demanded that the 40th Army step in and quell the rebellion, as his own army had proved untrustworthy [150] Thus, Soviet troops found themselves drawn into fighting against urban uprisings, tribal armies (called lashkar), and sometimes against mutinying Afghan Army units These forces mostly fought in the open, and Soviet airpower and artillery made short work of them [151]\n\n\nSoviet occupation, 1980‚Äì1985\nThe war now developed into a new pattern: the Soviets occupied the cities and main axis of communication, while the Afghan mujahideen, which the Soviet Army soldiers called 'Dushman,' meaning 'enemy', [156] divided into small groups and waged a guerrilla war in the mountains Almost 80 percent of the country was outside government control [157] Soviet troops were deployed in strategic areas in the northeast, especially along the road from Termez to Kabul In the west, a strong Soviet presence was maintained to counter Iranian influence Incidentally, special Soviet units would have [clarification needed] also performed secret attacks on Iranian territory to destroy suspected Mujahideen bases, and their helicopters then got engaged in shootings with Iranian jets [158] Conversely, some regions such as Nuristan, in the northeast, and Hazarajat, in the central mountains of Afghanistan, were virtually untouched by the fighting, and lived in almost complete independence.\n\n\nSoviet military operations against Afghan guerrillas\nThe war now developed into a new pattern: the Soviets occupied the cities and main axis of communication, while the Afghan mujahideen, which the Soviet Army soldiers called 'Dushman,' meaning 'enemy', [156] divided into small groups and waged a guerrilla war in the mountains Almost 80 percent of the country was outside government control [157] Soviet troops were deployed

Conversely, some regions such as Nuristan, in the northeast, and Hazarajat, in the central mountains of Afghanistan, were virtually untouched by the fighting, and lived in almost complete independence.\n\n\nReforms of the Karmal administration\nBabrak Karmal, after the invasion, promised reforms to win support from the population alienated by his ousted predecessors A temporary constitution, the Fundamental Principles of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, was adopted in April 1980 On paper, it was a democratic constitution including \"right of free expression\" and disallowing \"torture, persecution, and punishment, contrary to human dignity\" Karmal's government was formed of his fellow Parchamites along with (pro-Taraki) Khalqists, and a number of known non-communists/leftists in various ministries [153]\n\n\nMujahideen insurrection\nIn the mid-1980s, the Afghan resistance movement, assisted by the United States, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, Egypt, the People's Republic of China and others, contributed to Moscow's high military costs and strained international relations The U.S viewed the conflict in Afghanistan as an integral Cold War struggle, and the CIA provided assistance to anti-Soviet forces through the Pakistani intelligence services, in a program called Operation Cyclone [176]\n\n\nRaids inside Soviet territory\nIn an effort to foment unrest and rebellion by the Islamic populations of the Soviet Union, starting in late 1984 Director of CIA William Casey encouraged Mujahideen militants to mount sabotage raids inside the Soviet Union, according to Robert Gates, Casey's executive assistant and Mohammed Yousef, the Pakistani ISI brigadier general who was the chief for Afghan operations The rebels began cross-border raids into the Soviet Union in spring 1985 [190] [191] [192] In April 1987, three separate teams of Afghan rebels were directed by the ISI to launch coordinated raids on multiple targets across the Soviet border and extending, in the case of an attack on an Uzbek factory, as deep as over 16 kilometres (10¬†mi) into Soviet territory In response, the Soviets issued a thinly-veiled threat to invade Pakistan to stop the cross-border attacks, and no further attacks were reported [193]\n\n\nMedia reaction\nThose hopelessly brave warriors I walked with, and their families, who suffered so much for faith and freedom and who are still not free, they were truly the people of God ‚Äì Journalist Rob Schultheis, 1992 [194] [195]\n\n\nSoviet exit and change of Afghan leadership, 1985‚Äì1989\nAs early as 1983, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry began working with the Soviet Union to provide them an exit from Afghanistan, initiatives led by Foreign Minister Yaqub Ali Khan and Khurshid Kasuri Despite an active support for insurgent groups, Pakistanis remained sympathetic to the challenges faced by the Soviets in restoring the peace, eventually exploring the possibility of setting up an interim system of government under former monarch Zahir Shah, but this was not authorized by President Zia-ul-Haq due to his stance on the issue of the Durand Line.:‚Ää247‚Äì248‚Ää [207] In 1984‚Äì85, Foreign Minister Yaqub Ali Khan paid state visits to China, Saudi Arabia, Soviet Union, France, United States and the United Kingdom in order to develop a framework On 20 July 1987, the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the country was announced.\n\n\nForeign diplomatic efforts\nAs early as 1983, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry began working with the Soviet Union to provide them an exit from Afghanistan, initiatives led by Foreign Minister Yaqub Ali Khan and Khurshid Kasuri Despite an active support for insurgent groups, Pakistanis remained sympathetic to the challenges faced by the Soviets in restoring the peace, eventually exploring the possibility of setting up an interim system of government under former monarch Zahir Shah, but this was not authorized by President Zia-ul-Haq due to his stance on the issue of the Durand Line.:‚Ää247‚Äì248‚Ää [207] In 1984‚Äì85, Foreign Minister Yaqub Ali Khan paid state visits to China, Saudi Arabia, Soviet Union, France, United States and the United Kingdom in order to develop a framework On 20 July 1987, the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the country was announced.\n\n\nApril 1985 ‚Äì January 1987: Exit strategy\nThe first step of the Soviet Union's exit strategy was to transfer the burden of fighting the Mujahideen to the Afghan armed forces, with the aim of preparing them to operate without Soviet help During this phase, the Soviet contingent was restricted to supporting the DRA forces by providing artillery, air support and technical assistance, though some large-scale operations were still carried out by Soviet troops.\n\n\nMay 1986‚Äì1988: Najibullah and his reforms\nThe government of President Karmal, a puppet state, was largely ineffective It was weakened by divisions within the PDPA and the Parcham faction, and the regime's efforts to expand its base of support proved futile Moscow came to regard Karmal as a failure and blamed him for the problems Years later, when Karmal's inability to consolidate his government had become obvious, Mikhail Gorbachev, then General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, said, \"The main reason that there has been no national consolidation so far is that Comrade Karmal is hoping to continue sitting in Kabul with our help.\" [212] Karmal's consolidation plan only involved those who had not raised arms against the regime, and even demanded Soviet troops to seal the border with Pakistan before any negotiations with Mujahideen Eventually, the Soviet Union decided to dispose of Karmal from the leadership of Afghanistan [153]\n\n\nNegotiations for a coalition\nEx-king Zahir Shah remained a popular figure to most Afghans Diego Cordovez of the UN also recognized the king as a potential key to a political settlement to the war after the Soviet troops would leave Polls in 1987 showed that he was a favored figure to lead a potential coalition between the DRA regime and Mujahideen factions, as well as an opposition to the unpopular but powerful guerrilla leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who was strongly against the King's return Pakistan however was against this and refused to grant the ex-king a visa for potential negotiations with Mujahideen Pakistan's President Zia-ul-Haq and his supporters in the military were determined to put a conservative Islamic ally in power in Kabul [63]\n\n\nApril 1988: The Geneva Accords\nFollowing lengthy negotiations, the Geneva Accords was signed in 1988 between Afghanistan and Pakistan [215] Supported by the Soviet Union and the United States respectively, the two Asian countries agreed to refrain from any form of interference in each other's territory They also agreed to allow Afghan refugees in Pakistan to voluntarily return The two superpowers agreed to halt their interference in Afghanistan, which included a Soviet withdrawal [63]\n\n\nJanuary 1987 ‚Äì February 1989: Withdrawal\nThe promotion of Mikhail Gorbachev to General Secretary in 1985 and his 'new thinking' on foreign and domestic policy was likely an important factor in the Soviets' decision to withdraw Gorbachev had been attempting to remove the Soviet Union from the economic stagnation that had set in under the leadership of Brezhnev, and to reform the Soviet Union's economy and image with the Glasnost and Perestroika policies Gorbachev had also been attempting to ease cold war tensions by signing the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with the U.S in 1987 and withdrawing the troops from Afghanistan, whose presence had garnered so much international condemnation  Beijing had stipulated that a normalization of relations would have to wait until Moscow withdrew its army from Afghanistan (among other things), and in 1989 the first Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years took place [217] At the same time, Gorbachev pressured his Cuban allies in Angola to scale down activities and withdraw even though Soviet allies were faring somewhat better there [218] The Soviets also pulled many of their troops out of Mongolia in 1987, where they were also having a far easier time than in Afghanistan, and restrained the Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea to the point of an all-out withdrawal in 1988 [219] This massive withdrawal of Soviet forces from such highly contested areas shows that the Soviet government's decision to leave Afghanistan was based upon a general change in Soviet foreign policy ‚Äì from one of confrontation to avoidance of conflict wherever possible [220] [221]\n\n\nCauses of withdrawal\nSome of the causes of the Soviet Union's withdrawal from Afghanistan leading to the Afghanistan regime's eventual defeat include [231]\n\n\nFall of Najibullah government, 1992\nAfter the withdrawal of Soviet troops in 1989, the government of Mohammad Najibullah remained in power until 15 April 1992 Najibullah stepped down that day as Mujahideen guerrilla forces moved into Kabul He attempted to fly to India under the protection of the U.N but was blocked from leaving at the airport He then took refuge at a United Nations compound in Kabul After a bloody, four-year power struggle between different factions of the victorious anti-Najibullah forces, the Taliban took Kabul They stormed the U.N compound on September 26, 1996 They eventually tortured and killed Najibullah [233]\n\n\nAerial engagements\nDuring the conflict, Pakistan Air Force F-16 had shot down ten aircraft, belonging to Soviet Union, which had intruded into Pakistani territory However, the Soviet record only confirmed five kills (three Su-22s, one Su-25 and one An-26) Some sources show that PAF had shot down at least a dozen more aircraft during the war However, those kills were not officially acknowledged because they took place in Afghanistan's airspace and acknowledging those kills would mean that Afghan airspace was violated by PAF [9] In all, Pakistan Air Force F-16s had downed several MiG-23s, Su-22s, a Su-25, and an An-24 while losing only one F-16.\n\n\nAerial losses in Pakistan airspace\nDuring the conflict, Pakistan Air Force F-16 had shot down ten aircraft, belonging to Soviet Union, which had intruded into Pakistani territory However, the Soviet record only confirmed five kills (three Su-22s, one Su-25 and one An-26) Some sources show that PAF had shot down at least a dozen more aircraft during the war However, those kills were not officially acknowledged because they took place in Afghanistan's airspace and acknowledging those kills would mean that Afghan airspace was violated by PAF [9] In all, Pakistan Air Force F-16s had downed several MiG-23s, Su-22s, a Su-25, and an An-24 while losing only one F-16.\n\n\nStinger missiles and the \"Stinger effect\"\nWhether the introduction of the personal, portable, infrared-homing \"Stinger\" surface-to-air missile in September 1986 was a turning point in the war is disputed.\nMany Western military analysts credit the Stinger with a kill ratio of about 70% and with responsibility for most of the over 350 Soviet or Afghan government aircraft and helicopters downed in the last two years of the war [234] Some military analysts considered it a \"game changer\" and coined the term \"Stinger effect\" to describe it [235]\nCongressman Charlie Wilson claimed that before the Stinger the Mujahideen never won a set piece battle with the Soviets, but after it was introduced, the Mujahideen never again lost one [236]\n\n\nWar crimes\nHuman Rights Watch organization concluded that the Soviet Red Army and its communist-allied Afghan Army perpetrated war crimes and crimes against humanity in Afghanistan, intentionally targeting civilians and civilian areas for attack, and killing and torturing prisoners [241]\n\n\nMassacres\nThe army of the Soviet Union killed large numbers of Afghans to suppress their resistance In one notable incident the Soviet Army committed mass killing of civilians in the summer of 1980 [245] To separate the Mujahideen from the local populations and eliminate their support, the Soviet army killed many civilians, drove many more Afghans from their homes, and used scorched-earth tactics to prevent their return They used booby traps, mines, and chemical substances throughout the country [245] The Soviet army indiscriminately killed combatants and non-combatants to terrorize local populations into submission [245] The provinces of Nangarhar, Ghazni, Laghman, Kunar, Zabul, Kandahar, Badakhshan, Logar, Paktia and Paktika witnessed extensive depopulation programmes by the Soviet forces [243]\n\n\nRape\nThe Soviet forces abducted Afghan women in helicopters while flying in the country in search of Mujahideen [249] [250] [251] In November 1980 a number of such incidents had taken place in various parts of the country, including Laghman and Kama Soviet soldiers as well as KhAD agents kidnapped young women from the city of Kabul and the areas of Darul Aman and Khair Khana, near the Soviet garrisons, to rape them [252] Women who were taken and raped by Soviet soldiers were considered 'dishonoured' by their families if they returned home [253] Deserters from the Soviet Army in 1984 also reported the atrocities by Soviet troops on Afghan women and children, including rape [254]\n\n\nScorched-earth tactics and wanton destruction\nIrrigation systems, crucial to agriculture in Afghanistan's arid climate, were destroyed by aerial bombing and strafing by Soviet or government forces In the worst year of the war, 1985, well over half of all the farmers who remained in Afghanistan had their fields bombed, and over one quarter had their irrigation systems destroyed and their livestock shot by Soviet or government troops, according to a survey conducted by Swedish relief experts [255]\n\n\nUse of chemical weapons\nThere have also been numerous reports of illegal chemical weapons, including mycotoxins, being used by Soviet forces in Afghanistan, often indiscriminately against civilians [258]\n\n\nTorture\nAmnesty International concluded that the communist-controlled Afghan government used widespread torture against inmates (officials, teachers, businessmen and students suspected of having ties to the rebels) in interrogation centers in Kabul, run by the KhAD, who were beaten, subjected to electric shocks, burned with cigarettes and that some of their hair was pulled out Some died from these harsh conditions Women of the prisoners were forced to watch or were locked up in the cells with the corpses The Soviets were accused of supervising these tortures [259] [260]\n\n\nLooting\nThe Soviet soldiers were looting from the dead in Afghanistan, including stealing money, jewelry and clothes [261] During the Red Army withdrawal in February 1989, 30 to 40 military trucks crammed with Afghan historical treasures crossed into the Soviet Union, under orders from General Boris Gromov He cut an antique Tekke carpet stolen from Darul Aman Palace into several pieces and gave it to his acquaintances [262]\n\n\nForeign involvement\nThe Afghan mujahideen were backed primarily by Pakistan, the United States, Saudi Arabia, [267] and the United Kingdom making it a Cold War proxy war [268] Out of the countries that supported the Mujahideen, the U.S and Saudi Arabia offered the greatest financial support [265] [269] [270] However, private donors and religious charities throughout the Muslim world‚Äîparticularly in the Persian Gulf‚Äîraised considerably more funds for the Afghan rebels than any foreign government; [271] [272] [273] Jason Burke recounts that \"as little as 25 per cent of the money for the Afghan jihad was actually supplied directly by states.\" [274] Saudi Arabia was heavily involved in the war effort and matched the United States' contributions dollar-for-dollar in public funds Saudi Arabia also gathered an enormous amount of money for the Afghan mujahideen in private donations that amounted to about $20 million per month at their peak [275] [276]\n\n\nSpillover\nThe Mujahideen launched multiple raids into the Soviet Union in an effort to foment unrest and rebellion by the Islamic populations of the Soviet Union, starting in late 1984 Director of CIA William Casey encouraged Mujahideen militants to mount sabotage raids inside the Soviet Union, according to Robert Gates, Casey's executive assistant and Mohammed Yousef, the Pakistani ISI brigadier general who was the chief for Afghan operations The rebels began cross-border raids into the Soviet Union in Spring 1985 [190] [191] [192]\n\n\nRaids inside the Soviet Union\nThe

intruded into Pakistani airspace multiple times and Pakistan Air Force F-16 had shot down ten aircraft, belonging to Soviet Union, which had intruded into Pakistani territory However, the Soviet record only confirmed five plane kills (three Su-22s, one Su-25 and one An-26) and 4 helicopter (Mi-8) kills Some sources show that PAF had shot down at least a dozen more aircraft during the war However, those kills were not officially acknowledged because they took place in Afghanistan's airspace and acknowledging those kills would mean that Afghan airspace was violated by PAF [9] In all, Pakistan Air Force F-16s had downed 3 Su-22,1 Su-25,2 Mig-23,2 An-26, and Several Mi-8 while 1 Mig-23 was damaged while losing only one F-16 [269]\n\n\nTerror campaign in Pakistan\nThe KhAD-KGB campaign in Pakistan was a joint campaign in which the Afghan KhAD‚Äôs foreign \"Tenth Directorate\" [283] and the Soviet KGB targeted Pakistan using prostitution spy rings, terror attacks, hijackings, serial killings, assassinations and the dissemination of propaganda to dissuade Pakistan from supporting the Afghan Mujahideen [284]\n\n\nMiram Shah incident\nOn 2 April 1986, the 38th commando brigade of Democratic Republic of Afghanistan accidentally landed inside Pakistan territory during the Second Battle of Zhawar The strike force, in the darkness of night, accidentally landed near Miram Shah in Pakistan instead of Zhawar The force was surrounded and 120 soldiers were taken prisoner and 6 Mi-8 helicopters were captured.\n\n\nBadaber uprising\nIn between 26 and 27 April 1985, in Badaber, Pakistan, an armed rebellion was instigated by Soviet and Afghan prisoners of war who were being held at the Badaber fortress near Peshawar, Pakistan The prisoners fought the Afghan Mujahideen of the Jamiat-e Islami party and the Pakistani XI Corps supported by American CIA advisors in an attempt to escape but the rebellion was squashed and all POWs were killed.\n\n\nRaid inside Iran\nOn 5 April 1982, Soviet forces accidentally infiltrated Iranian territory, in which Soviet forces strayed from the target of a Mujahideen base in southern Afghanistan and accidentally destroyed an asphalt factory in Iran [285] Iranian security forces attacked this strike force by using tanks and aircraft destroying two Soviet Mi-8 helicopters and damaging many more.\n\n\nImpact\nBetween 25 December 1979, and 15 February 1989, a total of 620,000 soldiers served with the forces in Afghanistan (though there were only 80,000‚Äì104,000 serving at one time): 525,000 in the Army, 90,000 with border troops and other KGB sub-units, 5,000 in independent formations of MVD Internal Troops, and police forces [citation needed] A further 21,000 personnel were with the Soviet troop contingent over the same period doing various white collar and blue-collar jobs.\n\n\nSoviet personnel strengths and casualties\nBetween 25 December 1979, and 15 February 1989, a total of 620,000 soldiers served with the forces in Afghanistan (though there were only 80,000‚Äì104,000 serving at one time): 525,000 in the Army, 90,000 with border troops and other KGB sub-units, 5,000 in independent formations of MVD Internal Troops, and police forces [citation needed] A further 21,000 personnel were with the Soviet troop contingent over the same period doing various white collar and blue-collar jobs.\n\n\nCasualties and destruction in Afghanistan\nThe war resulted in the deaths of approximately 3,000,000 Afghans, [291] Civilian death and destruction from the war was massive and detrimental Estimates of Afghan civilian deaths vary from 562,000 [276] to 2,000,000 [28] [29] By one estimate, at least 800,000 Afghans were killed during the Soviet occupation [292] 5 million Afghans fled to Pakistan and Iran, 1/3 of the prewar population of the country, and another 2 million were displaced within the country, making it one of the largest refugee crises in history In the 1980s, half of all refugees in the world were Afghan [255] In his report, Felix Ermacora, the UN Special Rapporteur to Afghanistan, enumerated 32,755 killed civilians, 1,834 houses and 74 villages destroyed, and 3,308 animals killed in the first nine months of 1985 [293] Data cited by the World Bank shows that Afghanistan's population declined from 13.4 million (1979) to 11.8 million (1989) during the decade of Soviet occupation [294]\n\n\nRefugees\n5.5 million Afghans were made refugees by the war‚Äîa full one third of the country's pre-war population‚Äîfleeing the country to Pakistan or Iran [255] Another estimate states 6.2 million refugees [321] By the end of 1981, the UN High Commission for Refugees reported that Afghans represented the largest group of refugees in the world [301] [28] [29]\n\n\nEffect on Afghan society\nThe legacy of the war introduced a culture of guns, drugs and terrorism in Afghanistan The traditional power structure was also changed in favor of the powerful Mujahideen militias: [153]\n\n\nAftermath\nAccording to scholars Rafael Reuveny and Aseem Prakash, the war contributed to the fall of the Soviet Union by undermining the image of the Red Army as invincible, undermining Soviet legitimacy, and by creating new forms of political participation [333] [334] [335] On the other hand, the costs for the Soviet Union were not overwhelmingly large compared to other commitments [336] The CIA estimated in 1987 that the  costs amounted to about 2.5 percent of the Soviet military spending per year [337] According to historian Sergey Radchenko there is no evidence that the Afghanistan war bankrupted the USSR The Soviet Union spent about $7.5 billion between 1984 and 1987 but this number was negligible compared to the annual military budget of roughly $128 billion [338] [339] The decision to withdraw was made based on a number of political factors [340] The studies about the dissolution of the Soviet Union by historians Stephen Kotkin and Vladislav Zubok identify mainly internal reasons for the collapse and mention the Afghanistan war only in passing [341] [342]\n\n\nFall of the Soviet Union\nAccording to scholars Rafael Reuveny and Aseem Prakash, the war contributed to the fall of the Soviet Union by undermining the image of the Red Army as invincible, undermining Soviet legitimacy, and by creating new forms of political participation [333] [334] [335] On the other hand, the costs for the Soviet Union were not overwhelmingly large compared to other commitments [336] The CIA estimated in 1987 that the  costs amounted

Afghanistan war only in passing [341] [342]\n\n\nCivil war\nThe war did not end with the withdrawal of the Soviet Army The Soviet Union left Afghanistan deep in winter, with intimations of panic among Kabul officials The Afghan mujahideen were poised to attack provincial towns and cities and eventually Kabul, if necessary General Secretary Mohammed Najibullah's government, though failing to win popular support, territory, or international recognition, was able to remain in power until 1992 Ironically, until demoralized by the defections of its senior officers, the Afghan Army had achieved a level of performance it had never reached under direct Soviet tutelage Kabul had achieved a stalemate that exposed the Mujahideen's weaknesses, political and military But for nearly three years, while Najibullah's government successfully defended itself against Mujahideen attacks, factions within the government had also developed connections with its opponents.\n\n\nRise of Jihadist movements\n\"The Soviet strategy of \"rubblization\" returned the country to the Dark Ages, paving the way for a radicalization of the survivors (many of whom joined the now infamous Taliban movement) that would be realized in the decade after the Soviet departure in 1988.\"Samuel Totten & Paul Bartrop [354]\n\n\nSpread of Islamic militancy in Pakistan\nAmong the approximately three million Afghan refugees in Pakistan, thousands of children were educated in madrasa boarding schools financed by aid from the US and Gulf monarchies Since that aid was distributed according to the conservative Islamist ideological criteria of Pakistan's President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq and Saudi Arabia (and ignoring native Afghan traditions), the schools were part of networks of the favored Hizb-e-Islami party and the Pakistan Deobandi  [357] [371] (Iran provided similar help to Shia Islamist groups and punishments to moderate Shia nationalist Afghans [372])\n\n\nNotion of \"blowback\" against the U.S.\nBlowback, or unintended consequences of funding the Mujahideen, was said to have come to the United States in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the September 11 attacks [369] In the 1993 bombing, all of the participants in the bombing \"either had served in Afghanistan or were linked to a Brooklyn-based fund-raising organ for the Afghan jihad\" that was later \"revealed to be al-Qaeda's de facto U.S headquarters\" [369] Principals in the 2001 attack ‚Äì Osama Bin Laden and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed [375] ‚Äì had both fought in Afghanistan, and bin Laden was a lieutenant of Abdullah Azzam His group, al-Qaeda, returned to Afghanistan to take refuge with the Taliban after being expelled from Sudan [369] Before the 9/11 attack, al-Qaeda had bombed two U.S embassies in Africa in 1998, and nearly sank the USS Cole in Yemen in 2000 [369] However, no direct U.S aid to Bin Laden or any of his affiliates has ever been established [376]\n\n\nMedia and popular culture\nWithin Afghanistan, war rugs were a popular form of carpet designs woven by victims of the war.\n\n\nPerception in Afghanistan\nThe war has left a controversial legacy for Afghan people [377] The Mujahideen Victory Day is an annual holiday in Afghanistan on 28 April, however it is a controversial event to Afghans Some Afghans honor the fighters and sacrifice made by the Mujahideen to defeat a major power, but others view the victory as a prelude to the brutal 1990s civil war that divided the country politically and ethnically [335]\n\n\nRole of the United States\nPro-Mujahideen Afghans had seen the United States as the main power to help their cause in the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War However, after the Soviet withdrawal in 1989, a growing number of Afghans started blaming the United States for miseries This was cited as a result of continued American arming and funding of rebels against the pro-Soviet administration in Kabul Throughout 1989 and 1990, many rebel rocket attacks were fired, nowhere near military targets, that killed dozens of Afghan civilians [380] Many Afghans also reportedly felt that the U.S caused the rise of the Taliban by sending billions of dollars in funding for the rebels while leaving the country in Pakistan's hands after 1992 One Afghan ex-prisoner who was affiliated with the U.S Embassy in Kabul told the Chicago Tribune in 2001:\n\n\nPerception in the former Soviet Union\nThe war left a long legacy in the former Soviet Union and following its collapse Along with losses, it brought physical disabilities and widespread drug addiction throughout the USSR [382]\n\n\nRussian Federation\nCommemorating the intervention of 25 December 1979, in December 2009, veterans of the Soviet war in Afghanistan were honoured by the Duma or Parliament of the Russian Federation On 25 December, the lower house of the parliament defended the Soviet war in Afghanistan on the 30th anniversary of its start and praised the veterans of the conflict Differing assessments of the war \"mustn't erode the Russian people's respect for the soldiers who honestly fulfilled their duty in implementing tasks to combat international terrorism and religious extremists\" [384]\n\n\nUkraine\nAbout 25 percent of Soviet servicemen in Afghanistan were Ukrainian, numbering 160,000 of which more than 3,000 died and dozens more went missing [388]\n\n\nUzbekistan\nThe war affected many families in post-Soviet Uzbekistan who had lost children Some 64,500 young men from the Uzbek SSR were drafted in the war At least 1,522 were killed and more than 2,500 left disabled [389] The former Uzbekistani president Islam Karimov described the Afghan war as a \"major mistake\" of the Soviet Union [390]\n\n\nBelarus\nThe Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War has caused grief in the memories of Belarusians, but remains a topic rarely discussed in public It was the last war the country took part in prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 28,832 Belarusian natives were involved in the campaign and 732 died Most casualties were under 20 years old [382]\n\n\nMoldova\nAround 12,500 residents of the Moldavian SSR served during the war Of those, 301 Moldovans died in the war [391] The Union of Veterans of the War in Afghanistan of the Republic of Moldova is a veteran's group based in Moldova that advocates for the well-being of veterans [392] On 15 May 2000, after the Government's initiative to abolish benefits for veterans of the war in Afghanistan, sympathizers went to Great National Assembly Square In 2001, the Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova, which came to power, radically changed the position of all veterans in the country [393] 15 February is celebrated as the Day of Commemoration of those killed in the War in Afghanistan [394] The main ceremony is held at the memorial \"Sons of the Motherland ‚Äì Eternal Memory\".\n\n\nNotes\nThe Afghans are among the latest victims of genocide by a superpower Large

Immobile started the match, but was once again replaced by Berardi during the second half of regulation time [103] [104]\n\n\nStyle of play\nAlthough primarily a main striker, Immobile is capable of playing anywhere along the front-line A quick forward, Immobile is primarily known for his offensive movement off the ball, as well as his ability to make attacking runs and exploit spaces [107] He will often drift wide, from a central position, when making forward runs, allowing him to ghost in behind the defensive line where he can cut in to shoot, usually into the far post His main characteristics are his eye for goal and finishing ability with either foot, as well as his physical attributes; he also possesses solid technique, and is effective in the air [107] [108] [109] In addition to his offensive capabilities and goalscoring ability, he is also a hard-working player, known for his willingness to chase down the ball and press opponents when not in possession; [107] he also possesses good link-up play, [110] which enables him to provide assists for teammates, in addition to scoring goals himself [111] He is also an accurate penalty taker [112] [113] His goalscoring record and efficiency has earned him the nickname \"King Ciro\" with the Lazio supporters.\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn May 2014, Immobile and his long-time girlfriend Jessica Melena married [114] They have four children [115]\n\n\nCareer statistics\nJuventus Youth\n\n\nClub\nJuventus Youth\n\n\nInternational\nJuventus Youth\n\n\nHonours\nJuventus Youth\n\n\nOrders\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal

{"title": "Dalai_Lama", "content": "\nNames\n1578 AD, Dalai Lama The title Dalai Lama is part of the full title \"Âú£ ËØÜ‰∏ÄÂàá Áì¶ÈΩêÂ∞îËææÂñá ËææËµñ ÂñáÂòõ\" (Holy Knowing Everying Vajradhara Dalai Lama) given by Altan Khan  [10] \"Dalai Lama\" is a combination of the Mongolic word dalai ('ocean') [11] and the Tibetan word ‡Ωñ‡æ≥‡ºã‡Ωò‡ºã (bla-ma) ('master, guru') [12] [13] The word dalai corresponds to the Tibetan word gyatso [14] or rgya-mtsho, [15] and, according to Schwieger, was chosen by analogy with the Mongolian title Dalaiyin qan [11] or Dalaiin khan [citation needed] Others suggest it may have been chosen in reference to the breadth of the Dalai Lama's wisdom [16] The Dalai Lama is also known in Tibetan as the Rgyal-ba Rin-po-che ('Precious Conqueror') [15] or simply as the Rgyal-ba [17]:‚Ää23‚Ää\n\n\nHistory\nSamding Dorje Phagmo\n\n\nOrigins in myth and legend\nSince the 11th century, it has been widely believed in Central Asian Buddhist countries that Avalokite≈õvara, the bodhisattva of compassion, has a special relationship with the people of Tibet and intervenes in their fate by incarnating as benevolent rulers and teachers such as the Dalai Lamas [21] The Book of Kadam, [22] [23] the main text of the Kadampa school from which the 1st Dalai Lama hailed, is said to have laid the foundation for the Tibetans' later identification of the Dalai Lamas as incarnations of Avalokite≈õvara [24] [25] [26] It traces the legend of the bodhisattva's incarnations as early Tibetan kings and emperors such as Songtsen Gampo and later as Dromt√∂npa (1004‚Äì1064) [27] This lineage has been extrapolated by Tibetans up to and including the Dalai Lamas [28]\n\n\nAvalokite≈õvara's \"Dalai Lama master plan\"\nAccording to the 14th Dalai Lama, long ago Avalokite≈õvara had promised the Buddha to guide and defend the Tibetan people In the late Middle Ages, his master plan to fulfill this promise was the stage-by-stage establishment of the Dalai Lama institution in Tibet [31]\n\n\nEstablishment of the Dalai Lama lineage\nGendun Drup (1391‚Äì1474), a disciple of Je Tsongkapa, [44] would eventually be known as the 'First Dalai Lama', but he would not receive this title until 104 years after he died [45]\nThere was resistance to naming him as such, since he was ordained a monk in the Kadampa tradition [37] and for various reasons, [further explanation needed] the Kadampa school had eschewed the adoption of the tulku system to which the older schools adhered Therefore, although Gendun Drup grew to be an important Gelugpa lama, there was no search to identify his incarnation after his death in 1474 [46]\n\n\n1st Dalai Lama\nPema Dorje (1391‚Äì1474), who would eventually be posthumously declared the 1st Dalai Lama, was born in a cattle pen in Shabtod, Tsang in 1391 [51] [37] His family were goatherders, but when his father died in 1398, his mother entrusted him to his uncle for education as a Buddhist monk [52]  Pema Dorje was sent to Narthang, a major Kadampa monastery near Shigatse, which ran the largest printing press in Tibet [53] Its celebrated library attracted many scholars, so Pema Dorje received an education beyond the norm at the time as well as exposure to diverse spiritual schools and ideas [54]\n\n\n2nd Dalai Lama\nAfter Gendun Drup died, a boy called Sangyey Pel, born to Nyngma adepts at Yolkar in Tsang, [37] [70] declared himself at the age of three to be Gendun Drup and asked to be 'taken home' to Tashilhunpo He spoke in mystical verses, quoted classical texts spontaneously, [71] and claimed to be Dromt√∂npa, an earlier incarnation of the Dalai Lamas [72] When he saw monks from Tashilhunpo, he greeted the disciples of the late Gendun Drup by name [73] Convinced by the evidence, the Gelugpa elders broke with the traditions of their school and recognised him as Gendun Drup's tulku at the age of eight [48]\n\n\n3rd Dalai Lama\nThe Third Dalai Lama, Sonam Gyatso (1543‚Äì1588), was born in Tolung, near Lhasa, [96]\nas predicted by his predecessor [94] Claiming he was Gendun Gyatso and readily recalling events from his previous life, he was recognised as the incarnation, named 'Sonam Gyatso' and installed at Drepung, where 'he quickly excelled his teachers in knowledge and wisdom and developed extraordinary powers' [97] Unlike his predecessors, he came from a noble family, connected with the Sakya and the Phagmo Drupa (Karma Kagyu affiliated) dynasties, [92] and it is to him that the effective conversion of Mongolia to Buddhism is due [59]\n\n\n4th Dalai Lama\nThe Fourth Dalai Lama, Yonten Gyatso (1589‚Äì1617) was a Mongol, the great-grandson of Altan Khan [118] who was a descendant of Kublai Khan and leader of the T√ºmed Mongols who had already been converted to Buddhism by the Third Dalai Lama, Sonam Gyatso (1543‚Äì1588) [35] This strong connection caused the Mongols to zealously support the Gelugpa sect in Tibet, strengthening their status and position but also arousing intensified opposition from the Gelugpa's rivals, particularly the Tsang Karma Kagyu in Shigatse and their Mongol patrons and the B√∂npo in Kham and their allies [35] Being the newest school, unlike the older schools the Gelugpa lacked an established network of Tibetan clan patronage and were thus more reliant on foreign patrons [119]\n\n\n5th Dalai Lama\nThe death of the Fourth Dalai Lama in 1617 led to open conflict breaking out between various parties [119] Firstly, the Tsangpa dynasty, rulers of Central Tibet from Shigatse, supporters of the Karmapa school and rivals to the Gelugpa, forbade the search for his incarnation [123] However, in 1618 Sonam Rabten, the former attendant of the 4th Dalai Lama who had become the Ganden Phodrang treasurer, secretly identified the child, [124] who had been born to the noble Zahor family at Tagtse castle, south of Lhasa Then, the Panchen Lama, in Shigatse, negotiated the lifting of the ban, enabling the boy to be recognised as Lobsang Gyatso, the 5th Dalai Lama [123]\n\n\nRe-unification of Tibet\nHaving thus defeated all the Gelugpa's rivals and resolved all regional and sectarian conflicts G√ºshi Khan became the undisputed patron of a unified Tibet and acted as a \"Protector of the Gelug\", [136] establishing the Khoshut Khanate which covered almost the entire Tibetan plateau, an area corresponding roughly to 'Greater Tibet' including Kham and Amdo, as claimed by exiled groups (see maps) At an enthronement ceremony in Shigatse he conferred full sovereignty over Tibet on the Fifth Dalai Lama, [137] unified for the first time since the collapse of the Tibetan Empire exactly eight centuries earlier [119] [138] G√ºshi Khan then retired to Kokonor with his armies [119] and  [according to Smith] ruled Amdo himself directly thus creating a precedent for the later separation of Amdo from the rest of Tibet [138]\n\n\nVisit to Beijing\nIn 1636 the Manchus proclaimed their dynasty as the Qing dynasty and by 1644 they had completed their conquest of China under the prince regent Dorgon [142] The following year their forces approached Amdo on northern Tibet, causing the Oirat and Khoshut Mongols there to submit in 1647 and send tribute In 1648, after quelling a rebellion of Tibetans of Gansu-Xining, the Qing invited the Fifth Dalai Lama to visit their court at Beijing since they wished to engender Tibetan influence in their dealings with the Mongols The Qing were aware the Dalai Lama had extraordinary influence with the Mongols and saw relations with the Dalai Lama as a means to facilitate submission of the Khalka Mongols, traditional patrons of the Karma Kagyu sect [143]\n\n\nRelations with the Qing dynasty\nThe 17th-century struggles for domination between the Manchu-led Qing dynasty and the various Mongol groups spilled over to involve Tibet because of the Fifth Dalai Lama's strong influence over the Mongols as a result of their general adoption of Tibetan Buddhism and their consequent deep loyalty to the Dalai Lama as their guru Until 1674, the Fifth Dalai Lama had mediated in Dzungar Mongol affairs whenever they required him to do so, and the Kangxi Emperor, who had succeeded the Shunzhi Emperor in 1661, would accept and confirm his decisions automatically [148]\n\n\nCultural development\nThe time of the Fifth Dalai Lama, who reigned from 1642 to 1682 and founded the government known as the Ganden Phodrang, was a period of rich cultural development [149] His reign and that of Desi Sangye Gyatso are noteworthy for the upsurge in literary activity and of cultural and economic life that occurred The same goes for the great increase in the number of foreign visitors thronging Lhasa during the period as well as for the number of inventions and institutions that are attributed to the 'Great Fifth', as the Tibetans refer to him [150] The most dynamic and prolific of the early Dalai Lamas, he composed more literary works than all the other Dalai Lamas combined Writing on a wide variety of subjects he is specially noted for his works on history, classical Indian poetry in Sanskrit and his biographies of notable personalities of his epoch, as well as his own two autobiographies, one spiritual in nature and the other political (see Further Reading) [151] He also taught and travelled extensively, reshaped the politics of Central Asia, unified Tibet, conceived and constructed the Potala Palace and is remembered for establishing systems of national medical care and education [151]\n\n\nDeath of the fifth Dalai Lama\nThe Fifth Dalai Lama died in 1682 Tibetan historian Nyima Gyaincain points out that the written wills from the fifth Dalai Lama before he died explicitly said his title and authority were from the Emperor of China, and he was subordinate of the Emperor of China\n [146]\n\n\n6th Dalai Lama\nThe Sixth Dalai Lama (1683‚Äì1706) was born near Tawang, now in India After death of the 5th Dalai Lama, the regent Desi Sangye Gyatso kept death of the 5th Dalai Lama a secret, this allowed him to continue to use the authority of the Fifth Dalai Lama to manage the affairs of the Gelug Tsangyang Gyatso was picked out in 1685, but his parents were not informed In 1696, while suppressing the Dzungar rebellion, Kangxi Emperor accidentally learned from the captives that the 5th Dalai Lama had died many years ago Kangxi severely rebuke the regent for his mistake, the regent admitted his mistake and sent people to Monpa to welcome the reincarnated soul boy in 1697 After 16 years of study as a novice monk, in 1702 in his 20th year he rejected full ordination and gave up his monk's robes and monastic life, preferring the lifestyle of a layman [153] [154] [155]\n\n\n7th Dalai Lama\nIn 1708, in accordance with an indication given by the 6th Dalai Lama when quitting Lhasa, a child called Kelzang Gyatso had been born at Lithang in eastern Tibet who was soon claimed by local Tibetans to be his incarnation After going into hiding out of fear of Lhazang Khan, he was installed in Lithang monastery Along with some of the Kokonor Mongol princes, rivals of Lhazang, in defiance of the situation in Lhasa the Tibetans of Kham duly recognised him as the Seventh Dalai Lama in 1712, retaining his birth-name of Kelzang Gyatso For security reasons he was moved to Derge monastery and eventually, in 1716, now also backed and sponsored by the Kangxi Emperor of China [164]\n\n\nDzungar invasion\nIn any case, the Kangxi Emperor took full advantage of having Kelzang Gyatso under Qing control at Kumbum after other Mongols from the Dzungar tribes led by Tsewang Rabtan who was related to his supposed ally Lhazang Khan, deceived and betrayed the latter by invading Tibet and capturing Lhasa in 1717 [168] [169]\n\n\nEnthronement in Lhasa\nThis humiliation only determined the Kangxi Emperor to expel the Dzungars from Tibet once and for all and he set about assembling and dispatching a much larger force to march on Lhasa, bringing the emperor's trump card the young Kelzang Gyatso with it On the imperial army's stately passage from Kumbum to Lhasa with the boy being welcomed adoringly at every stage, Khoshut Mongols and Tibetans were happy (and well paid) to join and swell its ranks [176]\n\n\nExile to Kham\nHaving vanquished the Dzungars, the Qing army withdrew leaving the Seventh Dalai Lama as a political figurehead and only a Khalkha Mongol as the Qing amban or representative and a garrison in Lhasa [180] [181] After the Kangxi Emperor died in 1722 and was succeeded by his son, the Yongzheng Emperor, these were also withdrawn, leaving the Tibetans to rule autonomously and showing the Qing were interested in an alliance, not conquest [180] [181] In 1723, after brutally quelling a major rebellion by zealous Tibetan patriots and disgruntled Khoshut Mongols from Amdo who attacked Xining, the Qing intervened again, splitting Tibet by putting Amdo and Kham under their own more direct control [182]\n\n\nReturn to Lhasa\nIn 1735 he was allowed back to Lhasa to study and teach, but still under strict control, being mistrusted by the Qing, while Polhanas ruled Central Tibet under nominal Qing supervision Meanwhile, the Qing had promoted the Fifth Panchen Lama to be a rival leader and reinstated the ambans and the Lhasa garrison Polhanas died in 1747 He was succeeded by his son Gyurme Namgyal, the last dynastic ruler of Tibet, who was far less cooperative with the Qing He built a Tibetan army and started conspiring with the Dzungars to rid Tibet of Qing influence [184] In 1750, when the ambans realised this, they invited him and personally assassinated him Despite the Dalai Lama's attempts to calm the angered populace, a vengeful Tibetan mob assassinated the ambans, along with most of their escort [185]\n\n\nRestoration as Tibet's political leader\nThe Qing sent yet another force 'to restore order' but when it arrived the situation had already been stabilised under the leadership of the 7th Dalai Lama who was now seen to have demonstrated loyalty to the Qing Just as G√ºshi Khan had done with the Fifth Dalai Lama, they therefore helped reconstitute the government with the Dalai Lama presiding over a Kashag of four Tibetans, reinvesting him with temporal power in addition to his already established spiritual leadership This arrangement, with a Kashag under the Dalai Lama or his regent, outlasted the Qing dynasty which collapsed in 1912 [186]\n\n\n8th Dalai Lama\nThe Eighth Dalai Lama, Jamphel Gyatso, was born in Tsang in 1758 and died aged 46 having taken little part in Tibetan politics, mostly leaving temporal matters to his regents and the ambans [193] The Emperor of China exempted him from the lot-drawing ceremony of the Golden Urn [194] [195] Qianlong Emperor officially accepted Gyiangbai as the 8th Dalai Lama when the 6th Panchen Erdeni came to congratulate the emperor on his 70th birthday in 1780 The emperor granted the 8th Dalai Lama a jade seal of authority and jade sheets of confirmation of authority [196] [197] The confirmation of authority says:\n\n\n9th to 12th Dalai Lamas\nHugh Richardson's summary of the period covering the four short-lived, 19th-century Dalai Lamas:\n\n\n9th Dalai Lama\nBorn in Kham in 1805‚Äì6 amidst the usual miraculous signs the Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso was appointed by the 7th Panchen Lama's search team at the age of two and enthroned in the Potala in 1808 at an impressive ceremony attended by representatives from China, Mongolia, Nepal and Bhutan Exemption from using Golden Urn was approved by the Emperor [209] [210] Tibetan historian Nyima Gyaincain and Wang Jiawei point out that the 9th Dalai Lama was allowed to use the seal of authority given to the late 8th Dalai Lama by the Emperor of China [211]\n\n\n10th Dalai Lama\nLike the Seventh Dalai Lama, the Tenth, Tsultrim Gyatso, was born in Lithang, Kham, where the Third Dalai Lama had built a monastery It was 1816 and Regent Demo Tulku and the Seventh Panchen Lama followed indications from Nechung, the 'state oracle' which led them to appoint him at the age of two He passed all the tests and was brought to Lhasa but official recognition was delayed until 1822 when he was enthroned and ordained by the Seventh Panchen Lama There are conflicting reports about whether the Chinese 'Golden Urn' was utilised by drawing lots to choose him, but lot-drawing result was reported and approved by emperor [219] The 10th Dalai Lama mentioned in his biography that he was allowed to use the golden seal of authority based on the convention set up by the late Dalai Lama At the investiture, decree of the Emperor of China was issued and read out [220]\n\n\n11th Dalai Lama\nBorn in Gathar, Kham in 1838 and soon discovered by the official search committee with the help of the Nechung Oracle, the Eleventh Dalai Lama was brought to Lhasa in 1841 and recognised, enthroned and named Khedrup Gyatso by the Panchen Lama on April 16, 1842, seal of authority and golden sheets were granted on the same date [225] Sitting-in-the-bed ceremony was held in July 1844 [226] After that he was immersed in religious studies under the Panchen Lama, amongst other great masters Meanwhile, there were court intrigues and ongoing power struggles taking place between the various Lhasa factions, the Regent, the Kashag, the powerful nobles and the abbots and monks of the three great monasteries The Tsemonling Regent [227] became mistrusted and was forcibly deposed, there were machinations, plots, beatings and kidnappings of ministers and so forth, resulting at last in the Panchen Lama being appointed as interim Regent to keep the peace.\n\n\n12th Dalai Lama\nIn 1856, a child was born in south central Tibet with all the usual extraordinary signs He came to the notice of the search team, was investigated, passed the traditional tests and was recognised as the 12th Dalai Lama in 1858 The use of the Chinese Golden Urn at the insistence of the regent, who was later accused of being a Chinese lackey, confirmed this choice to everyone's satisfaction He was renamed Trinley Gyatso and enthroned on July 3, 1860, after the emperor's edict from Amban was announced [231] He underwent 13 years of intensive tutelage and training before becoming Tibet's ruler at age 17 [232]\n\n\n13th Dalai Lama\nIn 1877, request to exempt Lobu Zangtab Kaijia Mucuo (Chinese: ÁΩóÂ∏ÉËóèÂ°îÂ∏ÉÂºÄÁî≤Êú®Êé™) from using lot-drawing process Golden Urn to become the 13th Dalai Lama was approved by the Central Government [237] The 13th Dalai Lama assumed ruling power from the monasteries, which previously had great influence on the Regent, in 1895 Due to his two periods of exile in 1904‚Äì1909 to escape the British invasion of 1904, and from 1910‚Äì1912 to escape a Chinese invasion, he became well aware of the complexities of international politics and was the first Dalai Lama to become aware of the importance of foreign relations After his return from exile in India and Sikkim during January 1913, he assumed control of foreign relations and dealt directly with the Maharaja, with the British Political officer in Sikkim and with the king of Nepal ‚Äì rather than letting the Kashag or parliament do it [238]\n\n\n14th Dalai Lama\nThe 14th Dalai Lama was born on 6 July 1935 on a straw mat in a cowshed to a farmer's family in a remote part of Tibet [244] According to most Western journalistic sources [245] [246] he was born into a humble family of farmers as one of 16 children, and one of the three reincarnated rinpoches in the same family [247] [248] [249] On 5 February 1940, the Central Government approved the request to exempt Lhamo Thondup (Chinese: ÊãâÊú®ÁôªÁè†) from the lot-drawing process to become the 14th Dalai Lama [250] [251]\n\n\nResidences\nThe first Dalai Lama was based at Tashi Lhunpo Monastery, which he founded The Second to the Fifth Dalai Lamas were mainly based at Drepung Monastery outside Lhasa In 1645, after the unification of Tibet, the Fifth moved to the ruins of a royal fortress or residence on top of Marpori ('Red Mountain') in Lhasa and decided to build a palace on the same site This ruined palace, called Tritse Marpo, was originally built around A.D 636 by the founder of the Tibetan Empire, Songtsen Gampo for his Nepalese wife [274] Amongst the ruins there was just a small temple left where Tsongkhapa had given a teaching when he arrived in Lhasa in the 1380s [275]\n\n\nSearching for the reincarnation\nBy the Himalayan tradition, phowa is the discipline that is believed to transfer the mindstream to the intended body Upon the death of the Dalai Lama and consultation with the Nechung Oracle, a search for the Lama's yangsi, or reincarnation, is conducted [277] The government of the People's Republic of China has stated its intention to be the ultimate authority on the selection of the next Dalai Lama [278]\n\n\nList of Dalai Lamas\nThere have been 14 recognised incarnations of the Dalai Lama:\n\n\nFuture of the position\nIn the mid-1970s, Tenzin Gyatso told a Polish newspaper that he thought he would be the last Dalai Lama In a later interview published in the English language press he stated, \"The Dalai Lama office was an institution created to benefit others It is possible that it will soon have outlived its usefulness.\" [291] These statements caused a furore amongst Tibetans in India Many could not believe that such an option could even be considered It was further felt that it was not the Dalai Lama's decision to reincarnate Rather, they felt that since the Dalai Lama is a national institution it was up to the people of Tibet to decide whether the Dalai Lama should reincarnate [292]\n\nSee

the spiritual leader of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism, who is also considered to be the incarnation of the Bodhisattva of Compassion. The title \"Dalai Lama\" is derived from the Mongolian word \"Dalai,\" meaning \"ocean,\" and the Tibetan word \"Lama,\" meaning \"master\" or \"guru.\" The Dalai Lama is believed to be a reincarnation of the Bodhisattva of Compassion, who is said to have promised the Buddha to guide and defend the Tibetan people.\n\nNames\nThe full title of the Dalai Lama is \"Holy Knowing Everything Vajradhara Dalai Lama.\" The title \"Dalai Lama\" is a combination of the Mongolic word \"dalai\" and the Tibetan word \"Lama\" or \"Blama\" (Guru). The word \"dalai\" corresponds to the Tibetan word \"gyatso\" or \"rgya-mtsho,\" which means \"ocean.\" According to Schwieger, the title was chosen by analogy with the Mongolian title \"Dalaiyin qan\" or \"Dalaiin khan.\" Others suggest it may have been chosen in reference to the breadth of the Dalai Lama's wisdom. The Dalai Lama is also known in Tibetan as the \"Rgyal-ba Rin-po-che\" or simply as the \"Rgyal-ba\" (Precious Conqueror).\n\nHistory\nSince the 11th century, it has been widely believed in Central Asian Buddhist countries that Avalokite≈õvara, the Bodhisattva of Compassion, has a special relationship with the people of Tibet and intervenes in their fate by incarnating as benevolent rulers and teachers such as the Dalai Lamas. The Book of Kadam, the main text of the Kadampa school from which the 1st Dalai Lama hailed, is said to have laid the foundation for the Tibetans' later identification of the Dalai Lamas as incarnations of Avalokite≈õvara.\n\nOrigins in myth and legend\nSince the 11th century, it has been widely believed in Central Asian Buddhist countries that Avalokite≈õvara, the Bodhisattva of Compassion, has a special relationship with the people of Tibet and intervenes in their fate by incarnating as benevolent rulers and teachers such as the Dalai Lamas. The Book of Kadam, the main text of the Kadampa school from which the 1st Dalai Lama hailed, is said to have laid the foundation for the Tibetans' later identification of the Dalai Lamas as incarnations of Avalokite≈õvara.\n\nAvalokite≈õvara's \"Dalai Lama master plan\"\nAccording to the 14th Dalai Lama, long ago Avalokite≈õvara had promised the Buddha to guide and defend the Tibetan people. In the late Middle Ages, his master plan to fulfill this promise was the stage-by-stage establishment of the Dalai Lama institution in Tibet.\n\nEstablishment of the Dalai Lama lineage\nGendun Drup (1391‚Äì1474), a disciple of Je Tsongkapa, would eventually be known as the 'First Dalai Lama', but he would not receive this title until 104 years after he died. There was resistance to naming him as such, since he was ordained a monk in the Kadampa tradition and for various reasons, the Kadampa school had eschewed the adoption of the tulku system to which the older schools adhered.\n\n1st Dalai Lama\nPema Dorje (1391‚Äì1474), who would eventually be posthumously declared the 1st Dalai Lama, was born in a cattle pen in Shabtod, Tsang in 1391. His family were goatherders, but when his father died in 1398, his mother entrusted him to his uncle for education as a Buddhist monk. Pema Dorje was sent to Narthang, a major Kadampa monastery near Shigatse, which ran the largest printing press in Tibet. Its celebrated library attracted many scholars, so Pema Dorje received an education beyond the norm at the time as well as exposure to diverse spiritual schools and ideas.\n\n2nd Dalai Lama\nAfter Gendun Drup died, a boy called Sangyey Pel, born to Nyngma adepts at Yolkar in Tsang, declared himself at the age of three to be Gendun Drup and asked to be 'taken home' to Tashilhunpo. He spoke in mystical verses, quoted classical texts spontaneously, and claimed to be Dromt√∂npa, an earlier incarnation of the Dalai Lamas. When he saw monks from Tashilhunpo, he greeted the disciples of the late Gendun Drup by name. Convinced by the evidence, the Gelugpa elders broke with the traditions of their school and recognised him as Gendun Drup's tulku at the age of eight.\n\n3rd Dalai Lama\nThe Third Dalai Lama, Sonam Gyatso (1543‚Äì1588), was born in Tolung, near Lhasa. Claiming he was Gendun Gyatso and readily recalling events from his previous life, he was recognised as the incarnation, named 'Sonam Gyatso' and installed at Drepung, where 'he quickly excelled his teachers in knowledge and wisdom and developed extraordinary powers.'\n\n4th Dalai Lama\nThe Fourth Dalai Lama, Yonten Gyatso (1589‚Äì1617), was a Mongol, the great-grandson of Altan Khan, who was a descendant of Kublai Khan and leader of the T√ºmed Mongols who had already been converted to Buddhism by the Third Dalai Lama, Sonam Gyatso. This strong connection caused the Mongols to zealously support the Gelugpa sect in Tibet, strengthening their status and position but also arousing intensified opposition from the Gelugpa's rivals.\n\n5th Dalai Lama\nThe death of the Fourth Dalai Lama in 1617 led to open conflict breaking out between various parties. Firstly, the Tsangpa dynasty, rulers of Central Tibet from Shigatse, supported the Karmapa school and rivals to the Gelugpa, forbade the search for his incarnation. However, in 1618 Sonam Rabten, the former attendant of the 4th Dalai Lama who had become the Ganden Phodrang treasurer, secretly identified the child, who had been born to the noble Zahor family at Tagtse castle, south of Lhasa.\n\nRe-unification of Tibet\nHaving thus defeated all the Gelugpa's rivals and resolved all regional and sectarian conflicts, G√ºshi Khan became the undisputed patron of a unified Tibet and acted as a \"Protector of the Gelug\", establishing the Khoshut Khanate which covered almost the entire Tibetan plateau, an area corresponding roughly to 'Greater Tibet' including Kham and Amdo.\n\nVisit to Beijing\nIn 1636 the Manchus proclaimed their dynasty as the Qing dynasty and by 1644 they had completed their conquest of China under the prince regent Dorgon. The following year their forces approached Amdo on northern Tibet, causing the Oirat and Khoshut Mongols there to submit in 1647 and send tribute. In 1648, after quelling a rebellion of Tibetans of Gansu-Xining, the Qing invited the Fifth Dalai Lama to visit their court at Beijing since they wished to engender Tibetan influence in their dealings with the Mongols.\n\nRelations with the Qing dynasty\nThe 17th-century struggles for domination between the Manchu-led Qing dynasty and the various Mongol groups spilled over to involve Tibet because of the Fifth Dalai Lama's strong influence over the Mongols as a result of their general adoption of Tibetan Buddhism and their consequent deep loyalty to the Dalai Lama as their guru.\n\nCultural development\nThe time of the Fifth Dalai Lama, who reigned from 1642 to 1682 and founded the government known as the Ganden Phodrang, was a period of rich cultural development. His reign and that of Desi Sangye Gyatso are noteworthy for the upsurge in literary activity and of cultural and economic life that occurred.\n\n6th Dalai Lama\nThe Sixth Dalai Lama (1683‚Äì1706) was born near Tawang, now in India. After the death of the 5th Dalai Lama, the regent Desi Sangye Gyatso kept death of the 5th Dalai Lama a secret, this allowed him to continue to use the authority of the Fifth Dalai Lama to manage the affairs of the Gelug. Tsangyang Gyatso was picked out in 1685, but his parents were not informed.\n\n7th Dalai Lama\nIn 1708, a child called Kelzang Gyatso had been born at Lithang in eastern Tibet who was soon claimed by local Tibetans to be the incarnation of the 6th Dalai Lama. He was installed in Lithang monastery and eventually, in 1716, now also backed and sponsored by the Kangxi Emperor of China.\n\nDzungar invasion\nIn any case, the Kangxi Emperor took full advantage of having Kelzang Gyatso under Qing control at Kumbum after other Mongols from the Dzungar tribes led by Tsewang Rabtan who was related to his supposed ally Lhazang Khan, deceived and betrayed the latter by invading Tibet and capturing Lhasa in 1717.\n\nExile to Kham\nHaving vanquished the Dzungars, the Qing army withdrew leaving the Seventh Dalai Lama as a political figurehead and only a Khalkha Mongol as the Qing amban or representative and a garrison in Lhasa.\n\nReturn to Lhasa\nIn 1735 he was allowed back to Lhasa to study and teach, but still under strict control, being mistrusted by the Qing.\n\nRestoration as Tibet's political leader\nThe Qing sent yet another force 'to restore order' but when it arrived the situation had already been stabilised under the leadership of the 7th Dalai Lama who was now seen to have demonstrated loyalty to the Qing.\n\n8th Dalai Lama\nThe Eighth Dalai Lama, Jamphel Gyatso, was born in Tsang in 1758 and died aged 46 having taken little part in Tibetan politics, mostly leaving temporal matters to his regents and the ambans.\n\n9th to 12th Dalai Lamas\nHugh Richardson's summary of the period covering the four short-lived, 19th-century Dalai Lamas:\n\n9th Dalai Lama\nBorn in Kham in 1805‚Äì6 amidst the usual miraculous signs, the Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso was appointed by the 7th Panchen Lama's search team at the age of two and enthroned in the Potala in 1808 at an impressive ceremony attended by representatives from China, Mongolia, Nepal and Bhutan.\n\n10th Dalai Lama\nLike the Seventh Dalai Lama, the Tenth, Tsultrim Gyatso, was born in Lithang, Kham, where the Third Dalai Lama had built a monastery.

identification of the Dalai Lamas as incarnations of Avalokite≈õvara [24] [25] [26] It traces the legend of the bodhisattva's incarnations as early Tibetan kings and emperors such as Songtsen Gampo and later as Dromt√∂npa (1004‚Äì1064) [27] This lineage has been extrapolated by Tibetans up to and including the Dalai Lamas [28]\n\n\nAvalokite≈õvara's \"Dalai Lama master plan\"\nAccording to the

important Gelugpa lama, there was no search to identify his incarnation after his death in 1474 [46]\n\n\n1st Dalai Lama\nPema Dorje (1391‚Äì1474), who would eventually be posthumously declared the

recognised as the incarnation, named 'Sonam Gyatso' and installed at Drepung, where 'he quickly excelled his teachers in knowledge and wisdom and developed extraordinary powers' [97] Unlike his predecessors, he came from a noble family, connected with the Sakya and the Phagmo Drupa (Karma Kagyu affiliated) dynasties, [92] and it is to him that the effective conversion of Mongolia to Buddhism is due [59]\n\n\n4th Dalai Lama\nThe Fourth Dalai Lama, Yonten Gyatso (1589‚Äì1617) was a Mongol, the great-grandson of Altan Khan [118] who was a descendant of Kublai Khan and leader of the T√ºmed Mongols who had already been converted to Buddhism by the Third Dalai Lama, Sonam Gyatso (1543‚Äì1588) [35] This strong connection caused the Mongols to zealously support the Gelugpa sect in Tibet, strengthening their status and position but also arousing intensified opposition from the Gelugpa's rivals, particularly the Tsang Karma Kagyu in Shigatse and their Mongol patrons and the B√∂npo in Kham and their allies [35] Being the newest school, unlike the older schools the Gelugpa lacked an established network of Tibetan clan patronage and were thus more reliant on foreign patrons [119]\n\n\n5th Dalai Lama\nThe death of the Fourth Dalai Lama in 1617 led to open conflict breaking out between various parties [119] Firstly, the Tsangpa dynasty, rulers of Central Tibet from Shigatse, supporters of the Karmapa school and rivals to the Gelugpa, forbade the search for his incarnation [123] However, in 1618 Sonam Rabten, the former attendant of the 4th Dalai Lama who had become the Ganden Phodrang treasurer, secretly identified the child, [124] who had been born to the noble Zahor family at Tagtse castle, south of Lhasa Then, the Panchen Lama, in Shigatse, negotiated the lifting of the ban, enabling the boy to be recognised as Lobsang Gyatso, the 5th Dalai Lama [123]\n\n\nRe-unification of Tibet\nHaving thus defeated all the Gelugpa's rivals and resolved all regional and sectarian conflicts G√ºshi Khan became the undisputed patron of a unified Tibet and acted as a \"Protector of the Gelug\", [136] establishing the Khoshut Khanate which covered almost the entire Tibetan plateau, an area corresponding roughly to 'Greater Tibet' including Kham and Amdo, as claimed by exiled groups (see maps) At an enthronement ceremony in Shigatse he conferred full sovereignty over Tibet on the Fifth Dalai Lama, [137] unified for the first time since the collapse of the Tibetan Empire exactly eight centuries earlier [119] [138] G√ºshi Khan then retired to Kokonor with his armies [119] and  [according to Smith] ruled Amdo himself directly thus creating a precedent for the later separation of Amdo from the rest of Tibet [138]\n\n\nVisit to Beijing\nIn

Lama to visit their court at Beijing since they wished to engender Tibetan influence in their dealings with the Mongols The Qing were aware the Dalai Lama had extraordinary influence with the Mongols and saw relations with the Dalai Lama as a means to facilitate submission of the Khalka Mongols, traditional patrons of the Karma Kagyu sect [143]\n\n\nRelations with the Qing dynasty\nThe 17th-century struggles for domination between the Manchu-led Qing dynasty and the various Mongol groups spilled over to involve Tibet because of the Fifth Dalai Lama's strong influence over the Mongols as a result of their general adoption of Tibetan Buddhism and their consequent deep loyalty to the Dalai Lama as their guru Until 1674, the Fifth Dalai Lama had mediated in Dzungar Mongol affairs whenever they required him to do so, and the Kangxi Emperor, who had succeeded the Shunzhi Emperor in 1661, would accept and confirm his decisions automatically [148]\n\n\nCultural development\nThe time of the Fifth Dalai Lama, who reigned from 1642 to 1682 and founded the government known as the Ganden Phodrang, was a period of rich cultural development [149] His reign and that of Desi Sangye Gyatso are noteworthy for the upsurge in literary activity and of cultural and economic life that occurred The same goes for the great increase in the number of foreign visitors thronging Lhasa during the period as well as for the number of inventions and institutions that are attributed to the 'Great Fifth', as the Tibetans refer to him [150] The most dynamic and prolific of the early Dalai Lamas, he composed more literary works than all the other Dalai Lamas combined Writing on a wide variety of subjects he is specially noted for his works on history, classical Indian poetry in Sanskrit and his biographies of notable personalities of his epoch, as well as his own two autobiographies, one spiritual in nature and the other political (see Further Reading) [151] He also taught and travelled extensively, reshaped the politics of Central Asia, unified Tibet, conceived and constructed the Potala Palace and is remembered for establishing systems of national medical care and education [151]\n\n\nDeath of the fifth Dalai Lama\nThe Fifth Dalai Lama died in 1682 Tibetan historian Nyima Gyaincain points out that the written wills from the fifth Dalai Lama before he

near Tawang, now in India After death of the 5th Dalai Lama, the regent Desi Sangye Gyatso kept death of the 5th Dalai Lama a secret, this allowed him to continue to use the authority of the Fifth Dalai Lama to manage the affairs of the Gelug Tsangyang Gyatso was picked out in 1685, but his parents were not informed In 1696, while suppressing the Dzungar rebellion, Kangxi Emperor accidentally learned from the captives that the 5th Dalai Lama had died many years ago Kangxi severely rebuke the regent for his mistake, the regent admitted his mistake and sent people to Monpa to welcome the reincarnated soul boy in 1697 After 16 years of study as a novice monk, in 1702 in his 20th year he rejected full ordination and gave up his monk's robes and monastic life, preferring the lifestyle of a layman [153] [154] [155]\n\n\n7th Dalai Lama\nIn 1708, in accordance with an indication given by the 6th Dalai Lama when quitting Lhasa, a child called Kelzang Gyatso had been born at Lithang in eastern Tibet who was soon claimed by local Tibetans to be his incarnation After going into hiding out of fear of Lhazang Khan, he was installed in Lithang monastery Along with some of the Kokonor Mongol princes, rivals of Lhazang, in defiance of the situation in Lhasa the Tibetans of Kham duly recognised him as the Seventh Dalai Lama in 1712, retaining his birth-name of Kelzang Gyatso For security reasons he was moved to Derge monastery and eventually, in 1716, now also backed and sponsored by the Kangxi Emperor of China [164]\n\n\nDzungar invasion\nIn any case, the Kangxi Emperor took full advantage of having Kelzang Gyatso under Qing control at Kumbum after other Mongols from the Dzungar tribes led by Tsewang Rabtan who was related to his supposed ally Lhazang Khan, deceived and betrayed the latter by invading Tibet and capturing Lhasa in 1717 [168] [169]\n\n\nEnthronement in Lhasa\nThis humiliation only determined the Kangxi Emperor to expel the Dzungars from Tibet once and for all and he set about assembling and dispatching a much larger force to march on Lhasa, bringing the emperor's trump card the young Kelzang Gyatso with it On the imperial army's stately passage from Kumbum to Lhasa with the boy being welcomed adoringly at every stage, Khoshut Mongols and Tibetans were happy (and well paid) to join and swell its ranks [176]\n\n\nExile to Kham\nHaving vanquished the Dzungars, the Qing army withdrew leaving the Seventh Dalai Lama as a political figurehead and only a Khalkha Mongol as the Qing amban or representative and a garrison in Lhasa [180] [181] After the Kangxi Emperor died in 1722 and was succeeded by his son, the Yongzheng Emperor, these were also withdrawn, leaving the Tibetans to rule autonomously and showing the Qing were interested in an alliance, not conquest [180] [181] In 1723, after brutally quelling a major rebellion by zealous Tibetan patriots and disgruntled Khoshut Mongols from Amdo who attacked Xining, the Qing intervened again, splitting Tibet by putting Amdo and Kham under their own more direct control [182]\n\n\nReturn to Lhasa\nIn 1735 he was allowed back to Lhasa to study and teach, but still under strict control, being mistrusted by the Qing, while Polhanas ruled Central Tibet under nominal Qing supervision Meanwhile, the Qing had promoted the Fifth Panchen Lama to be a rival leader and reinstated the ambans and the Lhasa garrison Polhanas died in 1747 He was succeeded by his son Gyurme Namgyal, the last dynastic ruler of Tibet, who was far less cooperative with the Qing He built a Tibetan army and started conspiring with the Dzungars to rid Tibet of Qing influence [184] In 1750, when the ambans realised this, they invited him and personally assassinated him Despite the Dalai Lama's attempts to calm the angered populace, a vengeful Tibetan mob assassinated the ambans, along with most of their escort [185]\n\n\nRestoration as Tibet's political leader\nThe Qing sent yet another force 'to restore order' but when it arrived the situation had already been stabilised under the leadership of the 7th Dalai Lama who was now seen to have demonstrated loyalty to the Qing Just as G√ºshi Khan had done with the Fifth Dalai Lama, they therefore helped reconstitute the government with the Dalai Lama presiding over a Kashag of four Tibetans, reinvesting him with temporal power in addition to his already established spiritual leadership This arrangement, with a Kashag under the Dalai Lama or his regent, outlasted the Qing dynasty which collapsed in 1912 [186]\n\n\n8th Dalai Lama\nThe Eighth Dalai Lama, Jamphel Gyatso, was born in Tsang in 1758 and died aged 46 having taken little part in Tibetan politics, mostly leaving temporal matters to his regents and the ambans [193] The Emperor of China exempted him from the lot-drawing ceremony of the Golden Urn [194] [195] Qianlong Emperor officially accepted Gyiangbai as the 8th Dalai Lama when the 6th Panchen Erdeni came to congratulate the emperor on his 70th birthday in 1780 The emperor granted the 8th Dalai Lama a jade seal of authority and jade sheets of confirmation of authority [196] [197] The confirmation of authority says:\n\n\n9th to 12th Dalai Lamas\nHugh Richardson's summary of the period covering the four short-lived, 19th-century Dalai Lamas:\n\n\n9th Dalai Lama\nBorn in Kham in 1805‚Äì6 amidst the usual miraculous signs the Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso was appointed by the 7th Panchen Lama's search team at the age of two and enthroned in the Potala in 1808 at an impressive ceremony attended by representatives from China, Mongolia, Nepal and Bhutan Exemption from using Golden Urn was approved by the Emperor [209] [210] Tibetan historian Nyima Gyaincain and Wang Jiawei point out that the 9th Dalai Lama was allowed to use the seal of authority given to the late 8th Dalai Lama by the Emperor of China [211]\n\n\n10th Dalai Lama\nLike the Seventh Dalai Lama, the Tenth, Tsultrim Gyatso, was born in Lithang, Kham, where the Third Dalai Lama had built a monastery It was 1816 and Regent Demo Tulku and the Seventh Panchen Lama followed indications from Nechung, the 'state oracle' which led them to appoint him at the age of two He passed all the tests and was brought to Lhasa but official recognition was delayed until 1822 when he was enthroned and ordained by the Seventh Panchen Lama There are conflicting reports about whether the Chinese 'Golden Urn' was utilised by drawing lots to choose him, but lot-drawing result was reported and approved by emperor [219] The 10th Dalai Lama mentioned in his biography that he was allowed to use the golden seal of authority based on the convention set up by the late Dalai Lama At the investiture, decree of the Emperor of China was issued and read out [220]\n\n\n11th Dalai Lama\nBorn in Gathar, Kham in 1838 and soon discovered by the official search committee with the help of the Nechung Oracle, the Eleventh Dalai Lama was brought to Lhasa in 1841 and recognised, enthroned and named Khedrup Gyatso by the Panchen Lama on April 16, 1842, seal of authority and golden sheets were granted on the same date [225] Sitting-in-the-bed ceremony was held in July 1844 [226] After that he was immersed in religious studies under the Panchen Lama, amongst other great masters Meanwhile, there were court intrigues and ongoing power struggles taking place between the various Lhasa factions, the Regent, the Kashag, the powerful nobles and the abbots and monks of the three great monasteries The Tsemonling Regent [227] became mistrusted and was forcibly deposed, there were machinations, plots, beatings and kidnappings of ministers and so forth, resulting at last in the Panchen Lama being appointed as interim Regent to keep the peace.\n\n\n12th Dalai Lama\nIn 1856, a child was born in south central Tibet with all the usual extraordinary signs He came to the notice of the search team, was investigated, passed the traditional tests and was recognised as the 12th Dalai Lama in 1858 The use of the Chinese Golden Urn at the insistence of the regent, who was later accused of being a Chinese lackey, confirmed this choice to everyone's satisfaction He was renamed Trinley Gyatso and enthroned on July 3, 1860, after the emperor's edict from Amban was announced [231] He underwent 13 years of intensive tutelage and training before becoming Tibet's ruler at age 17 [232]\n\n\n13th Dalai Lama\nIn 1877, request to exempt Lobu Zangtab Kaijia Mucuo (Chinese: ÁΩóÂ∏ÉËóèÂ°îÂ∏ÉÂºÄÁî≤Êú®Êé™) from using lot-drawing process Golden Urn to become the 13th Dalai Lama was approved by the Central Government [237] The 13th Dalai Lama assumed ruling power from the monasteries, which previously had great influence on the Regent, in 1895 Due to his two periods of exile in 1904‚Äì1909 to escape the British invasion of 1904, and from 1910‚Äì1912 to escape a Chinese invasion, he became well aware of the complexities of international politics and was the first Dalai Lama to become aware of the importance of foreign relations After his return from exile in India and Sikkim during January 1913, he assumed control of foreign relations and dealt directly with the Maharaja, with the British Political officer in Sikkim and with the king of Nepal ‚Äì rather than letting the Kashag or parliament do it [238]\n\n\n14th Dalai Lama\nThe 14th Dalai Lama was born on 6 July 1935 on a straw mat in a cowshed to a farmer's family in a remote part of Tibet [244] According to most Western journalistic sources [245] [246] he was born into a humble family of farmers as one of 16 children, and one of the three reincarnated rinpoches in the same family [247] [248] [249] On 5 February 1940, the Central Government approved the request to exempt Lhamo Thondup (Chinese: ÊãâÊú®ÁôªÁè†) from the lot-drawing process to become the 14th Dalai Lama [250] [251]\n\n\nResidences\nThe first Dalai Lama was based at Tashi Lhunpo Monastery, which he founded The Second to the Fifth Dalai Lamas were mainly based at Drepung Monastery outside Lhasa In 1645, after the unification of Tibet, the Fifth moved to the ruins of a royal fortress or residence on top of Marpori ('Red Mountain') in Lhasa and decided to build a palace on the same site This ruined palace, called Tritse Marpo, was originally built around A.D 636 by the founder of the Tibetan Empire, Songtsen Gampo for his Nepalese wife [274] Amongst the ruins there was just a small temple left where Tsongkhapa had given a teaching when he arrived in Lhasa in the 1380s [275]\n\n\nSearching for the reincarnation\nBy the Himalayan tradition, phowa is the discipline that is believed to transfer the mindstream to the intended body Upon the death of the Dalai Lama and consultation with the Nechung Oracle, a search for the Lama's yangsi, or reincarnation, is conducted [277] The government of the People's Republic of China has stated its intention to be the ultimate authority on the selection of the next Dalai Lama [278]\n\n\nList of Dalai Lamas\nThere have been 14 recognised incarnations of the Dalai Lama:\n\n\nFuture of the position\nIn the mid-1970s, Tenzin Gyatso told a Polish newspaper that he thought he would be the last Dalai Lama In a later interview published in the English language press he stated, \"The Dalai Lama office was an institution created to benefit others It is possible that it will soon have outlived its usefulness.\" [291] These statements caused a furore amongst Tibetans in India Many could not believe that such an option could even be considered It was further felt that it was not the Dalai Lama's decision to reincarnate Rather, they felt that since the Dalai Lama is a national institution it was up to the people of Tibet to decide whether the Dalai Lama should reincarnate [292]\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Breakthrough with The Story\nCarlile's second album, The Story, was produced by T Bone Burnett [22] It includes a collaboration with the Indigo Girls on \"Cannonball\" The album was recorded in an 11-day session with Carlile, the Hanseroths, and drummer Matt Chamberlain to capture the raw intensity of Carlile's live performances The crack in Carlile's vocals during the title track, \"The Story\", came out by accident and was a direct result of the way the album was recorded [citation needed] \"The Story\" was featured heavily in General Motors commercials during the 2008 Summer

November 2010 at Benaroya Hall in Seattle, Washington, the album features Washington-native Carlile and her long-time band (including brothers Phil and Tim Hanseroth) performing alongside the Seattle Symphony Andrew Leahey from AllMusic called it Carlile's best and wrote, \"'Live at Benaroya Hall' is more concerned with dressing up Carlile's music in elegant, orchestral clothing, and the results are pretty stunning, from the grandeur of 'The Story' ‚Äì now featuring horns, woodwinds, and strings This isn't Brandi Carlile's first concert album, but it's certainly the best.\" [citation needed]\n\n\n2015‚Äì2016: The Firewatcher's Daughter and Grammy nomination\nCarlile's fifth album The Firewatcher's Daughter released on March 3, 2015, on ATO Records [41] In a preview of her new album before release, the Boston Globe wrote, \"Whether The Firewatcher's Daughter continues the country-folk flirtation of 2012's Bear Creek, returns to the warm adult songcraft of The Story and Give Up the Ghost, or explores some other direction entirely, she's sure to bring emotional intelligence, thoughtful clarity, and, most importantly, the most arresting female voice in pop this side of Adele I'm betting on her.\" [42]\n\n\n2017‚Äì2020: Grammy success with By the Way, I Forgive You\nCarlile's sixth studio album, produced by Dave Cobb and Shooter Jennings, By the Way, I Forgive You,

{"title": "Oprah_Winfrey", "content": "\nEarly life\nOrpah Gail Winfrey was born on January 29, 1954; her first name was spelled Orpah on her birth certificate after the biblical figure in the Book of Ruth, but people mispronounced it regularly and \"Oprah\" stuck [a] She was born in Kosciusko, Mississippi, to a teenaged mother, [24] Vernita Lee, and father Vernon Winfrey Winfrey's parents never married [25] Vernita Lee (1935‚Äì2018) was a housemaid [26] [27] Vernon Winfrey (1933‚Äì2022) [28] was a coal miner turned barber turned city councilman who was in the Armed Forces when she was born [26] [b] A genetic test in 2006 determined that her matrilineal line originated among the Kpelle ethnic group, from the area that became Liberia Her genetic makeup was determined to be 89% Sub-Saharan African, 8% \"Native American\" [c] (Indigenous peoples of the Americas), [31] and 3% East Asian [32]\n\n\nTelevision\nWorking in local media, Winfrey was both the youngest news anchor and the first black female news anchor at Nashville's WLAC-TV (now WTVF-TV), where she often covered the same stories as John Tesh, who worked at a competing Nashville station In 1976, she moved to Baltimore's WJZ-TV to co-anchor the six o'clock news In 1977, she was removed as co-anchor and worked in lower profile positions at the station She was then recruited to join Richard Sher as co-host of WJZ's local talk show People Are Talking, which premiered on August 14, 1978 She also hosted the local version of Dialing for Dollars [59] [60] [61]\n\n\nCelebrity interviews\nIn 1993, Winfrey hosted a rare

ever, with an audience of 36.5¬†million [82] On December 1, 2005, Winfrey appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman for the first time in 16 years, to promote the new Broadway musical, The Color Purple, [83] which she produced The episode was hailed by some as the \"television event of the decade\" and helped Letterman attract his largest audience in more than 11 years: 13.45¬†million viewers [84] Although a much-rumored feud was said to have been the cause of the rift, [83] both Winfrey and Letterman balked at such talk \"I want you to know, it's really over, whatever you thought was happening,\" said Winfrey On September 10, 2007, Letterman made his first appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show, as its season premiere was filmed in New York City [85]\n\n\nOther media\nWinfrey

Prize‚Äìwinning novel of the same name To prepare for her role as Sethe, the protagonist and former slave, Winfrey experienced a 24-hour simulation of the experience of slavery, which included being tied up and blindfolded and left alone in the woods Despite major advertising, including two episodes of her talk show dedicated solely to the film, and moderate to good critical reviews, Beloved opened to poor box-office results, losing approximately $30¬†million While promoting the movie, co-star Thandie Newton described Winfrey as \"a very strong technical actress and it's because she's so smart She's acute She's got a mind like a razor blade.\" [95] Harpo Productions released a film adaptation of Zora Neale Hurston's 1937 novel Their Eyes Were Watching God in 2005 The

Greene, it was said that her undisclosed advance fee had broken the record for the world's highest book advance fee, previously held by the autobiography of former U.S President Bill Clinton [100]\n\n\nOnline\nWinfrey's company created the Oprah.com website to provide resources and interactive content related to her shows, magazines, book club, and public charity Oprah.com averages more than 70 million page views and more than six million users per month, and receives approximately 20,000 e-mails each week [112] Winfrey initiated \"Oprah's Child Predator Watch List\", through her show and website, to help track down accused child molesters Within the first 48 hours, two of the featured men were captured [113]\n\n\nRadio\nOn February 9, 2006, it was announced that Winfrey had

has garnered heightened attention throughout her life and career, with many prominent industry outlets branding her a \"tycoon\" regarding her investments which as of 2022, are estimated to total approximately $127 million.\n\n\nRomantic history\nWinfrey's high school sweetheart Anthony Otey recalled an innocent courtship that began in Winfrey's senior year of high school, from which he saved hundreds of love notes; Winfrey conducted herself with dignity and was a model student [128] The two spoke of getting married, but Otey claimed to have always secretly known that Winfrey was destined for a far greater life than he could ever provide [129] She broke up with him on Valentine's Day of her senior year [130]\n\n\nClose friends\nWinfrey's best friend since their early twenties is Gayle King King was formerly the host of The Gayle King Show and is currently an editor of O, the Oprah Magazine Since 1997, when Winfrey played the therapist on an episode of the sitcom Ellen in which Ellen DeGeneres came out of the closet, Winfrey and King have been the target of persistent rumors that they were gay \"I understand why people think we're gay,\" Winfrey says in the August 2006 issue of O magazine \"There isn't a definition in our culture for this kind of bond between women So I get why people have to label it‚Äîhow can you be this close without it being sexual?\" [143] \"I've told nearly everything there is to tell All my stuff is out there People think I'd be so ashamed of being gay that I wouldn't admit it? Oh, please.\" [143]\n\n\nPersonal wealth\nBorn in rural poverty, and raised by a mother dependent on government welfare payments in a poor urban neighborhood, Winfrey became a millionaire at the age of 32 when her talk show received national syndication Winfrey negotiated ownership rights to the television program and started her own production company At the age of 41, Winfrey had a net worth of $340¬†million and replaced Bill Cosby as the only African American on the Forbes 400 [148] By 2000, with a net worth of $800¬†million, Winfrey is believed to have been the richest African American of the 20th century There has been a course taught at the University of Illinois focusing on Winfrey's business acumen; namely, \"History 298: Oprah Winfrey, the Tycoon\" [149] Winfrey was the highest-paid television entertainer in the United States in 2006, earning an estimated $260¬†million during the year, five times the sum earned by second-place music executive Simon Cowell [150] By 2008, her yearly income had increased to $275¬†million [151]\n\n\nReligious views\nOprah was raised a Baptist In her early life, she would speak at local, mostly African American congregations of the Southern Baptist Convention that were often deeply religious and familiar with such themes as evangelical Protestantism, the Black church, and being born-again [154] [155] [156]\n\n\nOther\nAfter the loss of her infant child at age 14, Winfrey did not want more children In a 2017 interview with Vanity Fair, she explained \"I didn't want babies I wouldn't have been a good mom for babies I don't have the patience I have the patience for puppies but that's a quick stage!\" [160]\n\n\nInfluence\nWinfrey was called \"arguably the world's most powerful woman\" by CNN and TIME, [161] \"arguably the most influential woman in the world\" by The American Spectator, [162] \"one of the 100 people who most influenced the 20th Century\" and \"one of the most influential people\" from 2004 to 2011 by TIME Winfrey is the only person to have appeared in the latter list on ten occasions [163]\n\n\nRankings\nWinfrey was called \"arguably the world's most powerful woman\" by CNN and TIME, [161] \"arguably the most influential woman in the world\" by The American Spectator, [162] \"one of the 100 people who most influenced the 20th Century\" and \"one of the most influential people\" from 2004 to 2011 by TIME Winfrey is the only person to have appeared in the latter list on ten occasions [163]\n\n\n\"Oprahfication\"\nThe Wall Street Journal coined the term \"Oprahfication\", meaning public confession as a form of therapy [184] By confessing intimate details about her weight problems, tumultuous love life, and sexual abuse, and crying alongside her guests, Winfrey has been credited by Time magazine with creating a new form of media communication known as \"rapport talk\" as distinguished from the \"report talk\" of Phil Donahue: \"Winfrey saw television's power to blend public and private; while it links strangers and conveys information over public airwaves, TV is most often viewed in the privacy of our homes Like a family member, it sits down to meals with us and talks to us in the lonely afternoons Grasping this paradox, ...¬†She makes people care because she cares That is Winfrey's genius, and will be her legacy, as the changes she has wrought in the talk show continue to permeate our culture and shape our lives.\" [185]\n\n\nDaytime talk show's impact on LGBT people\nWhile Phil Donahue has been credited with pioneering the tabloid talk show genre, Winfrey's warmth, intimacy, and personal confession popularized and changed it [13] [14] Her success at popularizing the tabloid talk show genre opened up a thriving industry that has included Ricki

However, the hijackers intentionally crashed the plane into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after passengers attempted to overcome them.\n\n**Hijackers**\n\nThe hijacking of Flight 93 was led by Ziad Jarrah, a member of al-Qaeda. He was born in Lebanon to a wealthy and secular Muslim family. Jarrah intended to become a pilot and moved to Germany in 1996, enrolling at the University of Greifswald to study German. A year later, he moved to Hamburg and began studying aeronautical engineering at the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences. In Hamburg, Jarrah became a devout Muslim and associated with the radical Hamburg cell.\n\n**Flight**\n\nThe aircraft involved in the hijacking was a Boeing 757-222, registration N591UA.

intentions, and to prevent being caught off-guard as it had been in the attack on Pearl Harbor The Air Force commissioned the 'Beacon Hill Report' from Project Lincoln at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which was researched in 1951‚Äì1952 and delivered in 1952 The committee was led by Carl F P Overhage and was overseen by the Air Force's Gordon P Saville, and included James Gilbert Baker and Edwin H Land, who would design the specialized optics in the U-2 [2]\n\n\nLockheed proposal\nIt was thought that an aircraft that could fly at 70,000 feet (21,300¬†m) would be beyond the reach of Soviet fighters, missiles, and radar [8] Another Air Force officer, John Seaberg, wrote a request for proposal in 1953 for an aircraft that could reach 70,000 feet (21,300¬†m) over a target with 1,500¬†nmi (1,700¬†mi; 2,800¬†km) of operational radius The USAF decided to solicit designs only from smaller aircraft companies that could give the project more attention [9] Under the code name \"Bald Eagle\", it gave contracts [10] to Bell Aircraft, Martin Aircraft, and Fairchild Engine and Airplane to develop proposals for the new reconnaissance aircraft Officials at Lockheed Aircraft Corporation heard about the project and decided to submit an unsolicited proposal To save weight and increase altitude, Lockheed executive John Carter suggested that the design eliminate landing gear and not attempt to meet combat load factors for the airframe The company asked Clarence \"Kelly\" Johnson to come up with such a design Johnson was Lockheed's best aeronautical engineer, [11] responsible for the P-38 and the P-80 He was also known for completing projects ahead of schedule, working in a separate division of the company, informally called the \"Skunk Works\" [12]\n\n\nApproval\nCivilian officials including Trevor Gardner, an aide to Secretary of the Air Force Harold E Talbott, were more positive about the CL-282 because of its higher potential altitude and smaller radar cross-section, and recommended the design to the Central Intelligence Agency's Office of Scientific Intelligence At that time, the CIA depended on the military for overflights, and Director of Central Intelligence Allen Dulles favored human over technical intelligence-gathering methods However, the Intelligence Systems Panel, a civilian group advising the USAF and CIA on aerial reconnaissance, had recognized by 1954 that the RB-57D would not meet the 70,000 feet (21,300¬†m) requirement that panel member Allen F Donovan of Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory believed was necessary for safety The CIA told the panel about the CL-282 The design elements that the USAF considered to be flaws (the single-engine and light load factor) appealed to Donovan He was a sailplane enthusiast who believed that a sailplane was the type of high-altitude aircraft the panel was seeking [15]\n\n\nManufacture\nBissell became head of the project, which used covert funding; under the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949, the CIA's director is the only federal government employee who can spend \"unvouchered\" government money Lockheed received a $22.5 million contract (equivalent to $255.9 million today) in March 1955 for the first 20 aircraft, with the first $1.26 million ($14.33 million today) mailed to Johnson's home in February 1955 to keep work going during negotiations The company agreed to deliver the first aircraft by July of that year and the last by November 1956 It did so, and for $3.5 million ($39.2 million today) under budget [17] The Flight Test Engineer in charge was Joseph F Ware Jr [18]\n\n\nFuel\nThe U-2 has used Jet Propellant Thermally Stable (JPTS) since the aircraft's development in the 1950s JPTS is a high thermal stability, high altitude fuel, created specifically for the U-2 JPTS has a lower freeze point, higher viscosity, and higher thermal stability than standard USAF fuels In 1999, the Air Force spent approximately $11.3 million (equivalent to $20.58 million in 2023 dollars) on fuel for the U-2 aircraft and was looking for a lower-cost alternative JPTS is a specialty fuel and as such has limited worldwide availability and costs over three times the unit volume price of USAF's primary jet fuel, JP-8 Research was carried out to find a cheaper and easier alternative involving additives to generally used jet fuels A JP-8 based alternative, JP-8+100LT, was being considered in 2001 JP-8+100 has increased thermal stability by 100¬†¬∞F (56¬†¬∞C) over stock JP-8, and is only 0.5 cents per gallon more expensive; low-temperature additives can be blended to this stock to achieve desired cold performance [23]\n\n\nRadar cross-section reduction\nWhen the first overflights of the Soviet Union were tracked by radar, the CIA initiated Project Rainbow to reduce the U-2's radar cross-section This effort ultimately proved unsuccessful, and work began on a follow-on aircraft, which resulted in the Lockheed A-12 Oxcart [25]\n\n\nPossible successor\nIn August 2015, the 60th anniversary of the U-2 program, Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works revealed they were internally developing a successor to the U-2, referred to as the UQ-2 or RQ-X, combining features from both the manned U-2 and unmanned Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk and improving upon them Disclosed details say the design is essentially an improved U-2 airframe with the same engine, service ceiling, sensors, and cockpit, with the main differences being an optional manning capability (something Lockheed has proposed for the U-2 to the USAF several times, but has never gained traction) and low-observable characteristics The USAF has no requirement or schedule for a next-generation High-Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) platform, but Lockheed sees a future need and wants something in development early The company's last attempt to create a stealth unmanned aircraft was the RQ-3 DarkStar, which never made it past flight testing and was canceled [26] Plans for a U-2 replacement would not conflict with the development of the SR-72, another project by the company to create a hypersonic unmanned surveillance plane, as it would be suited for missions that require greater speed for time-sensitive targets [27]\n\n\nAvionics Tech Refresh\nIn 2020, the US Air Force awarded the Avionics Tech Refresh contract to Lockheed Martin for upgrading the U-2 [32] In February 2020, the flight tests and the installation of new electro-optical reconnaissance systems were completed SYERS-2C cameras manufactured by Collins Aerospace equip the entire U-2S fleet The contract is valued at $50 million [33] The U-2S's ISR very high altitude mission requires changes for avionics suite for the U-2's onboard systems, a new mission computer designed to the U.S Air Force's open mission systems standard [34] and a new and modern cockpit displays (Primary Flight Display or PFD) [35]\n\n\nDesign\nThe design that gives the U-2 its remarkable performance also makes it a difficult aircraft to fly Martin Knutson said that it \"was the highest workload air plane I believe ever designed and built¬†‚Ä¶ you're wrestling with the airplane and operating the camera systems at all times\", leaving no time to \"worry about whether you're over Russia or you're flying over Southern California\" [37] The U-2 was designed and manufactured for minimum airframe weight, which results in an aircraft with little margin for error [21] Most aircraft were single-seat versions, with only five two-seat trainer versions known to exist [38] Early U-2 variants were powered by Pratt & Whitney J57 turbojet engines [39] The U-2C and TR-1A variants used the more powerful Pratt & Whitney J75 turbojet The U-2S and TU-2S variants incorporated the more powerful General Electric F118 turbofan engine [40]\n\n\nSensors\nExisting cameras had ground resolution down to 23 feet (7¬†m) from an altitude of 33,000 feet (10,000¬†m), and were inadequate for the 70,000 feet (21,000¬†m) altitude Ground resolution of 9.8 feet (3¬†m) was required, at a maximum payload weight of 440 pounds (200¬†kg) The U-2's camera was specially designed by James G Baker of Harvard and Richard Scott Perkin of the Perkin-Elmer Company, initially in collaboration and later separately [54]\n\n\nOperational history\nThough the USAF and the Navy would eventually fly the U-2, the CIA had majority control over the project, code-named Project DRAGON LADY [57] Despite SAC chief LeMay's early dismissal of the CL-282, the USAF in 1955 sought to take over the project and put it under SAC until Eisenhower repeated his opposition to military personnel flying the aircraft Nonetheless, the USAF substantially participated in the project; Bissell described it as a \"49 percent\" partner The USAF agreed to select and train pilots and plot missions, while the CIA would handle cameras and project security, process film, and arrange foreign bases [58]\n\n\nUnited States\nData from Jane's all the World's Aircraft 1989‚Äì90, [211] U.S Air Force fact sheet, [212] and Lockheed Martin U-2S product card [213]\n\nPilot selection and training\nThough the USAF and the Navy would eventually fly the U-2, the CIA had majority control over the project, code-named Project DRAGON LADY [57] Despite SAC chief LeMay's early dismissal of the CL-282, the USAF in 1955 sought to take over the project and put it under SAC until Eisenhower repeated his opposition to military personnel flying the aircraft Nonetheless, the USAF substantially participated in the project; Bissell described it as a \"49 percent\" partner The USAF agreed to select and train pilots and plot missions, while the CIA would handle cameras and project security, process film, and arrange foreign bases [58]\n\n\nTest flights\nAfter AQUATONE was funded and security handled by the CIA, the agency referred to all its high altitude aircraft as \"articles\" This was intended to reduce the chances of a security breach as part of a compartmented security system These three-digit \"article\" numbers were factory assigned Article 341 was the original U-2 prototype, and it never received a USAF serial [62] The first flight took place at Groom Lake on 1 August 1955, during what was intended to be only a high-speed taxi test The sailplane-like wings were so efficient that the aircraft jumped into the air at 70 knots (81¬†mph; 130¬†km/h), [21] amazing LeVier who, as he later said, \"had no intentions whatsoever of flying\" The lake bed had no markings, making it difficult for LeVier to judge the distance to the ground, and the brakes proved too weak; he bounced the U-2 once before it stopped rolling, but the aircraft suffered only minor damage LeVier again found landing the U-2 difficult during the first intentional test flight three days later On his sixth try, he found that landing the aircraft by touching down on the rear wheel first was better than making the initial touchdown with the front wheel Pilots continued to have difficulty during landing because the ground effect held the aircraft off the runway for long distances On a test flight on 8 August, the U-2 reached 32,000 feet (9,800¬†m), proving that Johnson had met his promised specifications and deadline By 16 August, the prototype flew at 52,000 feet (15,800¬†m), an altitude never before reached in sustained flight; by 8 September, it reached 65,000 feet (19,800¬†m) [63]\n\n\nCover story\nA committee of Army, Navy, USAF, CIA, NSA, and State Department representatives created lists of priority targets for U-2 and other intelligence-gathering methods The U-2 project received the list and drew up flight plans, and the committee provided a detailed rationale for each plan for the president to consider as he decided whether to approve it The CIA's Photo Intelligence Division grew in size to prepare for the expected flood of U-2 photographs Before the aircraft became operational, however, USAF's Project Genetrix, which used high-altitude balloons to photograph the Soviet Union, China, and eastern Europe, led to many diplomatic protests from those countries and for a while, CIA officials feared that the U-2 project was at risk While Genetrix was also a technical failure‚Äîonly 34 of the 516 balloons returned usable photographs‚Äîthe balloon flights gave the United States many clues on how the Communist countries used radar to track overflights, which benefited the U-2 program [66]\n\n\nInitial overflights of Communist territory\nThe British government in January 1956 approved the U-2's deployment from RAF Lakenheath NACA announced that the USAF Air Weather Service would use a Lockheed-developed aircraft to study the weather and cosmic rays at altitudes up to 55,000¬†feet; accordingly, the first CIA detachment of U-2s (\"Detachment A\") was known publicly as the 1st Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, Provisional (WRSP-1) The death in April 1956, however, of British agent Lionel Crabb while examining Soviet ships in Portsmouth harbor embarrassed the British government, which asked the United States to postpone the Lakenheath flights To avoid delays, in June 1956, Detachment A moved to Wiesbaden, Germany, without approval from the German government, while Giebelstadt Army Airfield was prepared as a more permanent base [70]\n\n\n\"Bomber gap\" disproven\nOn 10 July, the Soviets protested what they described as overflights by a USAF \"twin-engine medium bomber\", apparently believing that it was a B-57 Canberra The U.S replied on 19 July that no American \"military planes\" had overflown the Soviet Union, but the fact that the Soviets' report showed that they could track the U-2s for extended periods caused Eisenhower to immediately halt overflights over eastern Europe Beyond the Soviet protests, the president was concerned about the American public's reaction to the news that the U.S had violated international law To avoid project cancellation, the CIA began Project Rainbow to make the U-2 less detectable The eight overflights over communist territory, however, had already shown that the bomber gap did not exist; the U-2s had not found any Myasishchev M-4 Bison bombers at the nine bases they had visited Because the Eisenhower administration could not disclose the source of its intelligence, however, Congressional and public debate over the bomber gap continued [78]\n\n\nSuez Crisis and aftermath\nThe presidential order did not restrict U-2 flights outside eastern Europe In May 1956, Turkey approved the deployment of Detachment B at Incirlik Air Base, near Adana, Turkey Before the new detachment was ready, however, Detachment A in late August used Adana as a refueling base to photograph the Mediterranean The aircraft found evidence of many British troops on Malta and Cyprus as the United Kingdom prepared for its forthcoming intervention in Suez The U.S released some of the photographs to the British government As the crisis grew in seriousness, the project converted from a source of strategic reconnaissance, which prioritized high quality over speed (the film was processed by its maker, then analyzed in Washington), to a tactical reconnaissance unit that provided immediate analysis The Photo Intelligence Division set up a lab at Wiesbaden; as Detachment B took over from A and flew over targets that remain classified as of July¬†2013 [update], the Wiesbaden lab's rapid reports helped the U.S government to predict the Israeli-British-French attack on Egypt three days before it began on 29 October On 1 November a flight flew over the Egyptian air base at Almaza twice, 10 minutes apart; in between the British and French attacked the base, and the visible results of the attack in the \"10-minute reconnaissance\" impressed Eisenhower Beginning on 5 November, flights over Syria showed that the Soviets had not sent aircraft there despite their threats against the British, French and Israelis, a cause of worry for the U.S [79]\n\n\nRenewal of Eastern Bloc overflights\nEisenhower refused CIA pleas in September 1956 to reauthorize overflights of Eastern Europe but the Hungarian Revolution in November, and his reelection that month, caused the president to permit flights over border areas Soviet interceptors could still not reach the U-2s but, after the Soviets protested a December overflight of Vladivostok by RB-57Ds, Eisenhower again forbade communist overflights Flights close to the border continued, now including the first ELINT-equipped U-2s In May 1957, Eisenhower again authorized overflights over certain important Soviet missile and atomic facilities He continued to personally authorize each flight, closely examining maps and sometimes making changes to the flight plan [82] By 1957, one of the European units was based at Giebelstadt, and the far eastern unit was based at the Naval Air Facility Atsugi, Japan [83]\n\n\nThe \"missile gap\"\nThe successful launch of Sputnik 1 on 4 October 1957 gave credence to Soviet claims about the progress of its intercontinental ballistic missile program, and began the Sputnik crisis in the United States The U-2 intelligence caused Eisenhower to state in a press conference on 9 October that the launch did \"not raise my apprehensions, not one iota\", but he refused to disclose the U-2's existence as he believed that the Soviets would demand the end of the flights [90] In December 1958 Khrushchev boasted that a Soviet missile could deliver a 5-megaton warhead 8,000 miles (13,000¬†km) Although the Soviets' SS-6 Sapwood missile program was actually stalled by technical failures, subsequent boasts‚Äîand U.S Secretary of Defense Neil McElroy's statement in February 1959 to Congress that the Soviets might have a three-to-one temporary advantage in ICBMs during the early 1960s‚Äîcaused widespread concern in the U.S about the existence of a \"missile gap\" The American intelligence community was divided, with the CIA suspecting technical delays but the USAF believing that the SS-6 was ready for deployment Khrushchev continued to exaggerate the Soviet program's success; the missile gap concerns, and CIA and State Department support, caused Eisenhower to reauthorize one Communist territory overflight in July 1959 after 16 months, as well as many ELINT flights along the Soviet border British U-2 overflights were made in December and February 1960 The first one targeted a large segment of the railways in the Tyuratam test range area as ballistic missiles were expected to be deployed close to rail lines, as well as nuclear complexes and missile test sites No sites were found [91] Neither flight proved or disproved the existence of a \"missile gap\" The British flights' success contributed to Eisenhower's authorization of one overflight in April [92]\n\n\nMay 1960: U-2 shot down\nEisenhower authorized one more overflight, which was to be made no later than 1 May because the important Paris Summit of the Big Four Conference would begin on 16 May [93] [94] The CIA chose for the mission‚Äîthe 24th deep-penetration Soviet overflight‚ÄîOperation GRAND SLAM, an ambitious flight plan for the first crossing of the Soviet Union from Peshawar, Pakistan to Bod√∏, Norway; previous flights had always exited in the direction from which they had entered The route would permit visits to Tyuratam, Sverdlovsk, Kirov, Kotlas, Severodvinsk, and Murmansk It was expected, given good weather, to resolve missile, nuclear and nuclear submarine intelligence issues with one flight [95] Francis Gary Powers, the most experienced pilot with 27 missions, was chosen for the flight After delays, the flight began on May Day, 1 May This was a mistake because, as an important Soviet holiday, there was much less air traffic than usual The Soviets began tracking the U-2 15¬†miles outside the border, and over Sverdlovsk, four and a half hours into the flight, one of three SA-2 missiles detonated behind the aircraft at 70,500¬†feet, near enough to cause it to crash; another hit a Soviet interceptor attempting to reach the American aircraft Powers survived the near miss and was quickly captured; the crash did not destroy the U-2 and the Soviets were able to identify much of the equipment [96]\n\n\nRestructuring\nThe U-2 shootdown in 1960 paralyzed the U.S reconnaissance community and forced changes in policy, procedures, and security protocol The United States also had to move swiftly to protect its allies: for example after the Soviets announced that Powers was alive, the CIA evacuated the British pilots from Detachment B as Turkey did not know of their presence in the country [102] The end of Soviet overflights meant that Detachment B itself soon left Turkey, and in July Detachment C left Japan following a Japanese governmental request Both detachments merged into Detachment G, under the command of Lt Col William Gregory, at Edwards Air Force Base, California where the CIA had relocated the U-2 program after nuclear testing forced it to abandon Groom Lake in 1957 [citation needed]\n\n\nCuba\nData from Jane's all the World's Aircraft 1989‚Äì90, [211] U.S Air Force fact sheet, [212] and Lockheed Martin U-2S product card [213]\n\nBay of Pigs Invasion\nAs many as 15 U-2 sorties provided support for the April 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba by the United States Scientists such as Edwin H Land, James Rhyne Killian who had originally conceived the U-2 and had advocated for its development and deployment as a tool of scientific reconnaissance felt betrayed by the use of the U-2 for \"dirty tricks\" covert operations, such as the Bay of Pigs invasion Richard M Bissel, the CIA official in charge of both the U-2 program and CIA covert operations, including the Bay of Pigs Invasion, had been a good friend of Land and Killian, but such use of the U-2s strained their friendship [107]\n\n\nCuban Missile Crisis\nAfter receiving hasty training on the more powerful U-2F under the cognizance of the Weather Reconnaissance Squadron Provisional (WRSP-4) at Edwards AFB, Major Richard S Heyser flew over western Cuba on 14 October 1962 in a U-2F; his aircraft was the first to photograph Soviet medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBM) in San Crist√≥bal before returning to McCoy AFB, Florida Prior to the launch of all Cuban sorties, the two U-2F aircraft possessed by WSRP-4 and flown by 4080th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing personnel had USAF insignia and tail numbers [109]\n\n\nHickman incident\nOn 28 July 1966, a U-2 piloted by USAF Captain Robert Hickman departed from Barksdale Air Force Base to conduct a reconnaissance mission; Hickman's orders included the requirement that he not enter Cuban airspace As determined later by USAF investigators, trouble with the aircraft's oxygen system caused Hickman to lose consciousness U.S Navy pilot John Newlin, flying an F-4B assigned to VF-74, was scrambled from Naval Air Station Key West, ordered to intercept Hickman before he violated Cuban airspace, and, if necessary, shoot him down Newlin could not reach the U-2 before flying closer than 12¬†miles from the Cuban coastline and so had to turn back Hickman's U-2 flew across Cuba, ran out of fuel and crashed into a mountainside near Llanquera, Bolivia [115] Hickman died in the crash, [116] with the Bolivian military giving his remains an honor guard at a nearby chapel The US embassy to Bolivia sent a team to investigate the crash site [115]\n\n\nAsia\nCIA overflights of Asian targets began in spring 1958 when Detachment C moved from Japan to Naval Air Station Cubi Point in the Philippines to overfly Indonesia during an uprising against Sukarno's \"Guided Democracy\" government The CIA's Civil Air Transport, aiding the rebels, so badly needed pilots that it borrowed two CIA U-2 pilots despite the high risk to the U-2 program if one were captured The Indonesian government soon defeated the rebels, however, and the U-2s returned to Japan That year, Detachment C also flew over the Chinese coast near Quemoy during the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis to see if Communist Chinese forces were preparing to invade, and in 1959 aided CIA operations during the Tibetan uprising The unit was collecting high-altitude air samples to look for evidence of Soviet nuclear tests when it was withdrawn from Asia after the May 1960 U-2 incident [117]\n\n\nVietnam War\nIn early 1964, SAC sent a detachment of U-2s from the 4080th to South Vietnam for high altitude reconnaissance missions over North Vietnam On 5 April 1965, U-2s from the 4028th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron (SRS) took photos of SAM-2 sites near Hanoi and Haiphong harbor On 11 February 1966, the 4080th Wing was redesignated the 100th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing (100 SRW) and moved to Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona The detachment at Bien Hoa AB, South Vietnam, was redesignated the 349th SRS [125]\n\n\nU-2 carrier operations\nAt one time, in an effort to extend the U-2's operating range and to eliminate the need for foreign government approval for U-2 operations from USAF bases in foreign countries, it was suggested that the U-2 be operated from aircraft carriers Three aircraft were converted for carrier operations by the installation of arrester hooks, and carrier-qualified naval aviators were recruited to fly them.\n\n\n1970‚Äì2000\nIn August 1970, two U-2Rs were deployed by the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) to cover the Israeli-Egypt conflict under the code name EVEN STEVEN [113]\n\n\n21st century\nThe U-2 remains in front-line service more than 60 years after its first flight, with the current U-2 beginning service in 1980 This is due primarily to its ability to change surveillance objectives on short notice, something that surveillance satellites cannot do In the mid-1990s, it was converted from the U-2R to the U-2S, receiving the GE F118 turbofan engine [139] The U-2 outlasted its Mach 3 replacement, the SR-71, which was retired in 1998 A classified budget document approved by the Pentagon on 23 December 2005 called for the U-2's termination no earlier than 2012, with some aircraft being retired by 2007 [140] In January 2006, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld announced the U-2's pending retirement as a cost-cutting measure during a larger reorganization and redefinition of the USAF's mission [141] Rumsfeld said that this would not impair the USAF's ability to gather intelligence, which would be done by satellites and a growing supply of unmanned RQ-4 Global Hawk reconnaissance aircraft.\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nData

Force (ROCAF) used the RB-57D aircraft for reconnaissance missions over the People's Republic of China (PRC), but suffered two losses when MiG-17s and SA-2 surface-to-air missiles intercepted and downed the aircraft.\n\n\nVariants\nIn May 1961, in an attempt to extend the U-2's already considerable range, Lockheed modified six CIA U-2s and several USAF U-2s with aerial refueling equipment, which allowed the aircraft to receive fuel from either the KC-97 or from the KC-135 This extended the aircraft's range from approximately 4,000 to 8,000 nautical miles (7,400 to 15,000¬†km) and extended its endurance to more than 14 hours The J57-powered U-2Bs were re-designated U-2E and the J75-powered U-2Cs were redesignated U-2F [190] Each modified U-2 also included an additional oxygen cylinder However, pilot fatigue was not considered, and little use was made of the refueling capability The only U-2H was both air refueling-capable and carrier-capable [191] [192]\n\n\nPrimary

capable than the original aircraft A tactical reconnaissance version, the TR-1A, first flew in August 1981 A distinguishing feature of these aircraft is the addition of a large instrumentation \"superpod\" under each wing Designed for standoff tactical reconnaissance in Europe, the TR-1A was structurally identical to the U-2R The 17th Reconnaissance Wing, RAF Alconbury, England used operational TR-1As from 1983 until 1991 The last U-2 and TR-1 aircraft were delivered to USAF in October 1989 In 1992 all TR-1s were re-designated to U-2R for uniformity across the fleet The two-seat

United States Air Force (USAF) for several decades. The aircraft is capable of flying at extremely high altitudes, up to 70,000 feet (21,300 meters), and has been used for a variety of missions, including gathering intelligence on enemy military installations, monitoring weather patterns, and conducting scientific research.\n\n**Development**\n\nAfter World War II, the U.S military desired better strategic aerial reconnaissance to help determine Soviet capabilities and intentions, and to prevent being caught off-guard as it had been in the attack on Pearl Harbor. The Air Force commissioned the 'Beacon Hill Report' from Project Lincoln at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which was researched in 1951‚Äì1952 and delivered in 1952. The committee was led by Carl F P Overhage and was overseen by the Air Force's Gordon P Saville, and included James Gilbert Baker and Edwin H Land, who would design the specialized optics in the U-2.\n\n**Lockheed Proposal**\n\nIt was thought that an aircraft that could fly at 70,000 feet (21,300 meters) would be beyond the reach of Soviet fighters, missiles, and radar. Another Air Force officer, John Seaberg, wrote a request for proposal in 1953 for an aircraft that could reach 70,000 feet (21,300 meters) over a target with 1,500 nmi (1,700 mi; 2,800 km) of operational radius. Under the code name \"Bald Eagle\", it gave contracts to Bell Aircraft, Martin Aircraft, and Fairchild Engine and Airplane to develop proposals for the new reconnaissance aircraft. Officials at Lockheed Aircraft Corporation heard about the project and decided to submit an unsolicited proposal.\n\n**Approval**\n\nCivilian officials including Trevor Gardner, an aide to Secretary of the Air Force Harold E Talbott, were more positive about the CL-282 because of its higher potential altitude and smaller radar cross-section, and recommended the design to the Central Intelligence Agency's Office of Scientific Intelligence. The design elements that the USAF considered to be flaws (the single-engine and light load factor) appealed to Donovan, who was a sailplane enthusiast.\n\n**Manufacture**\n\nBissell became head of the project, which used covert funding; under the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949, the CIA's director is the only federal government employee who can spend \"unvouchered\" government money. Lockheed received a $22.5 million contract (equivalent to $255.9 million today) in March 1955 for the first 20 aircraft, with the first $1.26 million (equivalent to $14.33 million today) mailed to Johnson's home in February 1955 to keep work going during negotiations. The company agreed to deliver the first aircraft by July of that year and the last by November 1956.\n\n**Fuel**\n\nThe U-2 has used Jet Propellant Thermally Stable (JPTS) since the aircraft's development in the 1950s. JPTS is a high thermal stability, high altitude fuel, created specifically for the U-2. JPTS has a lower freeze point, higher viscosity, and higher thermal stability than standard USAF fuels.\n\n**Radar Cross-Section Reduction**\n\nWhen the first overflights of the Soviet Union were tracked by radar, the CIA initiated Project Rainbow to reduce the U-2's radar cross-section. This effort ultimately proved unsuccessful, and work began on a follow-on aircraft, which resulted in the Lockheed A-12 Oxcart.\n\n**Possible Successor**\n\nIn August 2015, the 60th anniversary of the U-2 program, Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works revealed they were internally developing a successor to the U-2, referred to as the UQ-2 or RQ-X, combining features from both the manned U-2 and unmanned Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk and improving upon them.\n\n**Avionics Tech Refresh**\n\nIn 2020, the US Air Force awarded the Avionics Tech Refresh contract to Lockheed Martin for upgrading the U-2. The contract is valued at $50 million.\n\n**Design**\n\nThe design that gives the U-2 its remarkable performance also makes it a difficult aircraft to fly. Martin Knutson said that it \"was the highest workload air plane I believe ever designed and built‚Ä¶ you're wrestling with the aircraft and operating the camera systems at all times\", leaving no time to \"worry about whether you're over Russia or you're flying over Southern California\".\n\n**Operational History**\n\nThe U-2 has been used in several conflicts and operations, including the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the Vietnam War. It has also been used for humanitarian missions, such as disaster relief and natural disaster monitoring.\n\n**Variants**\n\nThere have been several variants of the U-2, including the U-2R, U-2S, and U-2T. The U-2R was a reconnaissance version of the aircraft, while the U-2S was a modified version with improved performance and range. The U-2T was a two-seat trainer version of the aircraft.\n\n**Operators**\n\nThe U-2 has been operated by several countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, and Japan. It has also been used by several military organizations, including the US Air Force and the Royal Air Force.\n\n**Specifications**\n\nThe U-2 has a number of impressive specifications, including a maximum speed of over 450 knots (520 mph; 830 km/h), a service ceiling of 70,000 feet (21,300 meters), and a range of over 3,000 nmi (3,500 mi; 5,600 km). It is powered by a single turbojet engine and has a wingspan of over 100 feet (30 meters).\n\n**Aircraft on Display**\n\nSeveral U-2 aircraft are on display at museums and air bases around the world, including the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio, and the Royal Air Force Museum in London, England.\n\n**See Also**\n\nThe U-2 has been the subject of several books, articles, and films, including a 1965 book by Fletcher Pratt and a 1982 film directed by John Carpenter.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article uses information from various sources, including the Lockheed Martin website, the US Air Force website, and the CIA website.\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* Pratt, Fletcher.

(21,300¬†m) over a target with 1,500¬†nmi (1,700¬†mi; 2,800¬†km) of operational radius The USAF decided to solicit designs only from smaller aircraft companies that could give the project more attention [9] Under the code name \"Bald Eagle\", it gave contracts [10] to Bell Aircraft, Martin Aircraft, and Fairchild Engine and Airplane to develop proposals for the new reconnaissance aircraft Officials at Lockheed Aircraft Corporation heard about the project and decided to submit an unsolicited proposal To save weight and increase altitude, Lockheed executive John Carter suggested that the design eliminate landing gear and not attempt to meet combat load factors for the airframe The company asked Clarence \"Kelly\" Johnson to come up with such a design Johnson was Lockheed's best aeronautical engineer, [11] responsible for the P-38 and the P-80 He was also known for completing projects ahead of schedule, working in a separate division of the company, informally called the \"Skunk Works\" [12]\n\n\nApproval\nCivilian officials including Trevor Gardner, an aide to Secretary of the Air Force Harold E Talbott, were more positive about the CL-282 because of its higher potential altitude and smaller radar cross-section, and recommended the design to the Central Intelligence Agency's Office of Scientific Intelligence At that time, the CIA depended on the military for overflights, and Director of Central Intelligence Allen Dulles favored human over technical intelligence-gathering methods However, the Intelligence Systems Panel, a civilian group advising the USAF and CIA on aerial reconnaissance, had recognized by 1954 that the RB-57D would not meet the 70,000 feet (21,300¬†m) requirement that panel member Allen F Donovan of Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory believed was necessary for safety The CIA told the panel about the CL-282 The design elements that the USAF considered to be flaws (the single-engine and light load factor) appealed to Donovan He was a sailplane enthusiast who believed that a sailplane was the type of high-altitude aircraft the panel was seeking [15]\n\n\nManufacture\nBissell became head of the project, which used covert funding; under the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949, the CIA's director is the only federal government employee who can spend \"unvouchered\" government money Lockheed received a $22.5 million contract

negotiations The company agreed to deliver the first aircraft by July of that year and the last by November 1956 It did so, and for $3.5 million ($39.2 million today) under budget [17] The Flight Test Engineer in charge was Joseph F Ware Jr [18]\n\n\nFuel\nThe U-2 has used Jet Propellant Thermally Stable (JPTS) since the aircraft's development in the 1950s JPTS is a high thermal stability, high altitude fuel, created specifically for the U-2 JPTS has a lower freeze point, higher viscosity, and higher thermal stability than standard USAF fuels In 1999, the Air Force spent approximately $11.3 million (equivalent to $20.58 million in 2023 dollars) on fuel for the U-2 aircraft and was looking for a lower-cost alternative JPTS is a specialty fuel and as such has limited worldwide availability and costs over three times the unit volume price of USAF's primary jet fuel, JP-8 Research was carried out to find a cheaper and easier alternative involving additives to generally used jet fuels A JP-8 based alternative, JP-8+100LT, was being considered in 2001 JP-8+100 has increased thermal stability by 100¬†¬∞F (56¬†¬∞C) over stock JP-8, and is only 0.5 cents per gallon more expensive; low-temperature additives can be blended to this stock to achieve desired cold performance [23]\n\n\nRadar cross-section reduction\nWhen the first overflights of the Soviet Union were tracked by radar, the CIA initiated Project Rainbow to reduce the U-2's radar cross-section This effort ultimately proved unsuccessful, and work began on a follow-on aircraft, which resulted in the Lockheed A-12 Oxcart [25]\n\n\nPossible successor\nIn August 2015, the 60th anniversary of the U-2 program, Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works revealed they were internally developing a successor to the U-2, referred to as the UQ-2 or RQ-X, combining features from both the manned U-2 and unmanned Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk and improving upon them Disclosed details say the design is essentially an improved U-2 airframe with the same engine, service ceiling, sensors, and cockpit, with the main differences being an optional manning capability (something Lockheed has proposed for the U-2 to the USAF several times, but has never gained traction) and low-observable characteristics The USAF has no requirement or schedule for a next-generation High-Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) platform, but Lockheed sees a future need and wants something in development early The company's last attempt to create a stealth unmanned aircraft was the RQ-3 DarkStar, which never made it past flight testing and was canceled [26] Plans for a U-2 replacement would not conflict with the development of the SR-72, another project by the company to create a hypersonic unmanned surveillance plane, as it would be suited for missions that require greater speed for time-sensitive targets [27]\n\n\nAvionics Tech Refresh\nIn 2020, the US Air Force awarded the Avionics Tech Refresh contract to Lockheed Martin for upgrading the U-2 [32] In February 2020, the flight tests and the installation of new electro-optical reconnaissance systems were completed SYERS-2C cameras manufactured by Collins Aerospace equip the entire U-2S fleet The contract is valued at $50 million [33] The U-2S's ISR very high altitude mission requires changes for avionics suite for the U-2's onboard systems, a new mission computer designed to the U.S Air Force's open mission systems standard [34] and a new and modern cockpit displays (Primary Flight Display or PFD) [35]\n\n\nDesign\nThe design that gives the U-2 its remarkable performance also makes it a difficult aircraft to fly Martin Knutson said that it \"was the highest workload air plane I believe ever designed and built¬†‚Ä¶ you're wrestling with the airplane and operating the camera systems at all times\", leaving no time to \"worry about whether you're over Russia or you're flying over Southern California\" [37] The U-2 was designed and manufactured for minimum airframe weight, which results in an aircraft with little margin for error [21] Most aircraft were single-seat versions, with only five two-seat trainer versions known to exist [38] Early U-2 variants were powered by Pratt & Whitney J57 turbojet engines [39] The U-2C and TR-1A variants used the more powerful Pratt & Whitney J75 turbojet The U-2S and TU-2S variants incorporated the more powerful General Electric F118 turbofan engine [40]\n\n\nSensors\nExisting cameras had ground resolution down to 23 feet (7¬†m) from an altitude of 33,000 feet (10,000¬†m), and were inadequate for the 70,000 feet (21,000¬†m) altitude Ground resolution of 9.8 feet (3¬†m) was required, at a maximum payload weight of 440 pounds (200¬†kg) The U-2's camera was specially designed by James G Baker of Harvard and Richard Scott Perkin of the Perkin-Elmer Company, initially in collaboration and later separately [54]\n\n\nOperational history\nThough the USAF and the Navy would eventually fly the U-2, the CIA had majority control over the project, code-named Project DRAGON LADY [57] Despite SAC chief LeMay's early dismissal of the CL-282, the USAF in 1955 sought to take over the project and put it under SAC until Eisenhower repeated his opposition to military personnel flying the aircraft Nonetheless, the USAF substantially participated in the project; Bissell described it as a \"49 percent\" partner The USAF agreed to select and train pilots and plot missions, while the CIA would handle cameras and project security, process film, and arrange foreign bases [58]\n\n\nUnited States\nData from Jane's all the World's Aircraft 1989‚Äì90, [211] U.S Air Force fact sheet, [212] and Lockheed Martin U-2S product card [213]\n\nPilot selection and training\nThough the USAF and the Navy would eventually fly the U-2, the CIA had majority control over the project, code-named Project DRAGON LADY [57] Despite SAC chief LeMay's early dismissal of the CL-282, the USAF in 1955 sought to take over the project and put it under SAC until Eisenhower repeated his opposition to military personnel flying the aircraft Nonetheless, the USAF substantially participated in the project; Bissell described it as a \"49 percent\" partner The USAF agreed to select and train pilots and plot missions, while the CIA would handle cameras and project security, process film, and arrange foreign bases [58]\n\n\nTest flights\nAfter AQUATONE was funded and security handled by the CIA, the agency referred to all its high altitude aircraft as \"articles\" This was intended to reduce the chances of a security breach as part of a compartmented security system These three-digit \"article\" numbers were factory assigned Article 341 was the original U-2 prototype, and it never received a USAF serial [62] The first flight took place at Groom Lake on 1 August 1955, during what was intended to be only a high-speed taxi test The sailplane-like wings were so efficient that the aircraft jumped into the air at 70 knots (81¬†mph; 130¬†km/h), [21] amazing LeVier who, as he later said, \"had no intentions whatsoever of flying\" The lake bed had no markings, making it difficult for LeVier to judge the distance to the ground, and the brakes proved too weak; he bounced the U-2 once before it stopped rolling, but the aircraft suffered only minor damage LeVier again found landing the U-2 difficult during the first intentional test flight three days later On his sixth try, he found that landing the aircraft by touching down on the rear wheel first was better than making the initial touchdown with the front wheel Pilots continued to have difficulty during landing because the ground effect held the aircraft off the runway for long distances On a test flight on 8 August, the U-2 reached 32,000 feet (9,800¬†m), proving that Johnson had met his promised specifications and deadline By 16 August, the prototype flew at 52,000 feet (15,800¬†m), an altitude never before reached in sustained flight; by 8 September, it reached 65,000 feet (19,800¬†m) [63]\n\n\nCover story\nA committee of Army, Navy, USAF, CIA, NSA, and State Department representatives created lists of priority targets for U-2 and other intelligence-gathering methods The U-2 project received the list and drew up flight plans, and the committee provided a detailed rationale for each plan for the president to consider as he decided whether to approve it The CIA's Photo Intelligence Division grew in size to prepare for the expected flood of U-2 photographs Before the aircraft became operational, however, USAF's Project Genetrix, which used high-altitude balloons to photograph the Soviet Union, China, and eastern Europe, led to many diplomatic protests from those countries and for a while, CIA officials feared that the U-2 project was at risk While Genetrix was also a technical failure‚Äîonly 34 of the 516 balloons returned usable photographs‚Äîthe balloon flights gave the United States many clues on how the Communist countries used radar to track overflights, which benefited the U-2 program [66]\n\n\nInitial overflights of Communist territory\nThe British government in January 1956 approved the U-2's deployment from RAF Lakenheath NACA announced that the USAF Air Weather Service would use a Lockheed-developed aircraft to study the weather and cosmic rays at altitudes up to 55,000¬†feet; accordingly, the first CIA detachment of U-2s (\"Detachment A\") was known publicly as the 1st Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, Provisional (WRSP-1) The death in April 1956, however, of British agent Lionel Crabb while examining Soviet ships in Portsmouth harbor embarrassed the British government, which asked the United States to postpone the Lakenheath flights To avoid delays, in June 1956, Detachment A moved to Wiesbaden, Germany, without approval from the German government, while Giebelstadt Army Airfield was prepared as a more permanent base [70]\n\n\n\"Bomber gap\" disproven\nOn 10 July, the Soviets protested what they described as overflights by a USAF \"twin-engine medium bomber\", apparently believing that it was a B-57 Canberra The U.S replied on 19 July that no American \"military planes\" had overflown the Soviet Union, but the fact that the Soviets' report showed that they could track the U-2s for extended periods caused Eisenhower to immediately halt overflights over eastern Europe Beyond the Soviet protests, the president was concerned about the American public's reaction to the news that the U.S had violated international law To avoid project cancellation, the CIA began Project Rainbow to make the U-2 less detectable The eight overflights over communist territory, however, had already shown that the bomber gap did not exist; the U-2s had not found any Myasishchev M-4 Bison bombers at the nine bases they had visited Because the Eisenhower administration could not disclose the source of its intelligence, however, Congressional and public debate over the bomber gap continued [78]\n\n\nSuez Crisis and aftermath\nThe presidential order did not restrict U-2 flights outside eastern Europe In May 1956, Turkey approved the deployment of Detachment B at Incirlik Air Base, near Adana, Turkey Before the new detachment was ready, however, Detachment A in late August used Adana as a refueling base to photograph the Mediterranean The aircraft found evidence of many British troops on Malta and Cyprus as the United Kingdom prepared for its forthcoming intervention in Suez The U.S released some of the photographs to the British government As the crisis grew in seriousness, the project converted from a source of strategic reconnaissance, which prioritized high quality over speed (the film was processed by its maker, then analyzed in Washington), to a tactical reconnaissance unit that provided immediate analysis The Photo Intelligence Division set up a lab at Wiesbaden; as Detachment B took over from A and flew over targets that remain classified as of July¬†2013 [update], the Wiesbaden lab's rapid reports helped the U.S government to predict the Israeli-British-French attack on Egypt three days before it began on 29 October On 1 November a flight flew over the Egyptian air base at Almaza twice, 10 minutes apart; in between the British and French attacked the base, and the visible results of the attack in the \"10-minute reconnaissance\" impressed Eisenhower Beginning on 5 November, flights over Syria showed that the Soviets had not sent aircraft there despite their threats against the British, French and Israelis, a cause of worry for the U.S [79]\n\n\nRenewal of Eastern Bloc overflights\nEisenhower refused CIA pleas in September 1956 to reauthorize overflights of Eastern Europe but the Hungarian Revolution in November, and his reelection that month, caused the president to permit flights over border areas Soviet interceptors could still not reach the U-2s but, after the Soviets protested a December overflight of Vladivostok by RB-57Ds, Eisenhower again forbade communist overflights Flights close to the border continued, now including the first ELINT-equipped U-2s In May 1957, Eisenhower again authorized overflights over certain important Soviet missile and atomic facilities He continued to personally authorize each flight, closely examining maps and sometimes making changes to the flight plan [82] By 1957, one of the European units was based at Giebelstadt, and the far eastern unit was based at the Naval Air Facility Atsugi, Japan [83]\n\n\nThe \"missile gap\"\nThe successful launch of Sputnik 1 on 4 October 1957 gave credence to Soviet claims about the progress of its intercontinental ballistic missile program, and began the Sputnik crisis in the United States The U-2 intelligence caused Eisenhower to state in a press conference on 9 October that the launch did \"not raise my apprehensions, not one iota\", but he refused to disclose the U-2's existence as he believed that the Soviets would demand the end of the flights [90] In December 1958 Khrushchev boasted that a Soviet missile could deliver a 5-megaton warhead 8,000 miles (13,000¬†km) Although the Soviets' SS-6 Sapwood missile program was actually stalled by technical failures, subsequent boasts‚Äîand U.S Secretary of Defense Neil McElroy's statement in February 1959 to Congress that the Soviets might have a three-to-one temporary advantage in ICBMs during the early 1960s‚Äîcaused widespread concern in the U.S about the existence of a \"missile gap\" The American intelligence community was divided, with the CIA suspecting technical delays but the USAF believing that the SS-6 was ready for deployment Khrushchev continued to exaggerate the Soviet program's success; the missile gap concerns, and CIA and State Department support, caused Eisenhower to reauthorize one Communist territory overflight in July 1959 after 16 months, as well as many ELINT flights along the Soviet border British U-2 overflights were made in December and February 1960 The first one targeted a large segment of the railways in the Tyuratam test range area as ballistic missiles were expected to be deployed close to rail lines, as well as nuclear complexes and missile test sites No sites were found [91] Neither flight proved or disproved the existence of a \"missile gap\" The British flights' success contributed to Eisenhower's authorization of one overflight in April [92]\n\n\nMay 1960: U-2 shot down\nEisenhower authorized one more overflight, which was to be made no later than 1 May because the important Paris Summit of the Big Four Conference would begin on 16 May [93] [94] The CIA chose for the mission‚Äîthe 24th deep-penetration Soviet overflight‚ÄîOperation GRAND SLAM, an ambitious flight plan for the first crossing of the Soviet Union from Peshawar, Pakistan to Bod√∏, Norway; previous flights had always exited in the direction from which they had entered The route would permit visits to Tyuratam, Sverdlovsk, Kirov, Kotlas, Severodvinsk, and Murmansk It was expected, given good weather, to resolve missile, nuclear and nuclear submarine intelligence issues with one flight [95] Francis Gary Powers, the most experienced pilot with 27 missions, was chosen for the flight After delays, the flight began on May Day, 1 May This was a mistake because, as an important Soviet holiday, there was much less air traffic than usual The Soviets began tracking the U-2 15¬†miles outside the border, and over Sverdlovsk, four and a half hours into the flight, one of three SA-2 missiles detonated behind the aircraft at 70,500¬†feet, near enough to cause it to crash; another hit a Soviet interceptor attempting to reach the American aircraft Powers survived the near miss and was quickly captured; the crash did not destroy the U-2 and the Soviets were able to identify much of the equipment [96]\n\n\nRestructuring\nThe U-2 shootdown in 1960 paralyzed the U.S reconnaissance community and forced changes in policy, procedures, and security protocol The United States also had to move swiftly to protect its allies: for example after the Soviets announced that Powers was alive, the CIA evacuated the British pilots from Detachment B as Turkey did not know of their presence in the country [102] The end of Soviet overflights meant that Detachment B itself soon left Turkey, and in July Detachment C left Japan following a Japanese governmental request Both detachments merged into Detachment G, under the command of Lt Col William Gregory, at Edwards Air Force Base, California where the CIA had relocated the U-2 program after nuclear testing forced it to abandon Groom Lake in 1957 [citation needed]\n\n\nCuba\nData from Jane's all the World's Aircraft 1989‚Äì90, [211] U.S Air Force fact sheet, [212] and Lockheed Martin U-2S product card [213]\n\nBay of Pigs Invasion\nAs many as 15 U-2 sorties provided support for the April 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba by the United States Scientists such as Edwin H Land, James Rhyne Killian who had originally conceived the U-2 and had advocated for its development and deployment as a tool of scientific reconnaissance felt betrayed by the use of the U-2 for \"dirty tricks\" covert operations, such as the Bay of Pigs invasion Richard M Bissel, the CIA official in charge of both the U-2 program and CIA covert operations, including the Bay of Pigs Invasion, had been a good friend of Land and Killian, but such use of the U-2s strained their friendship [107]\n\n\nCuban Missile Crisis\nAfter receiving hasty training on the more powerful U-2F under the cognizance of the Weather Reconnaissance Squadron Provisional (WRSP-4) at Edwards AFB, Major Richard S Heyser flew over western Cuba on 14 October 1962 in a U-2F; his aircraft was the first to photograph Soviet medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBM) in San Crist√≥bal before returning to McCoy AFB, Florida Prior to the launch of all Cuban sorties, the two U-2F aircraft possessed by WSRP-4 and flown by 4080th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing personnel had USAF insignia and tail numbers [109]\n\n\nHickman incident\nOn 28 July 1966, a U-2 piloted by USAF Captain Robert Hickman departed from Barksdale Air Force Base to conduct a reconnaissance mission; Hickman's orders included the requirement that he not enter Cuban airspace As determined later by USAF investigators, trouble with the aircraft's oxygen system caused Hickman to lose consciousness U.S Navy pilot John Newlin, flying an F-4B assigned to VF-74, was scrambled from Naval Air Station Key West, ordered to intercept Hickman before he violated Cuban airspace, and, if necessary, shoot him down Newlin could not reach the U-2 before flying closer than 12¬†miles from the Cuban coastline and so had to turn back Hickman's U-2 flew across Cuba, ran out of fuel and crashed into a mountainside near Llanquera, Bolivia [115] Hickman died in the crash, [116] with the Bolivian military giving his remains an honor guard at a nearby chapel The US embassy to Bolivia sent a team to investigate the crash site [115]\n\n\nAsia\nCIA overflights of Asian targets began in spring 1958 when Detachment C moved from Japan to Naval Air Station Cubi Point in the Philippines to overfly Indonesia during an uprising against Sukarno's \"Guided Democracy\" government The CIA's Civil Air Transport, aiding the rebels, so badly needed pilots that it borrowed two CIA U-2 pilots despite the high risk to the U-2 program if one were captured The Indonesian government soon defeated the rebels, however, and the U-2s returned to Japan That year, Detachment C also flew over the Chinese coast near Quemoy during the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis to see if Communist Chinese forces were preparing to invade, and in 1959 aided CIA operations during the Tibetan uprising The unit was collecting high-altitude air samples to look for evidence of Soviet nuclear tests when it was withdrawn from Asia after the May 1960 U-2 incident [117]\n\n\nVietnam War\nIn early 1964, SAC sent a detachment of U-2s from the 4080th to South Vietnam for high altitude reconnaissance missions over North Vietnam On 5 April 1965, U-2s from the 4028th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron (SRS) took photos of SAM-2 sites near Hanoi and Haiphong harbor On 11 February 1966, the 4080th Wing was redesignated the 100th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing (100 SRW) and moved to Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona The detachment at Bien Hoa AB, South Vietnam, was redesignated the 349th SRS [125]\n\n\nU-2 carrier operations\nAt one time, in an effort to extend the U-2's operating range and to eliminate the need for foreign government approval for U-2 operations from USAF bases in foreign countries, it was suggested that the U-2 be operated from aircraft carriers Three aircraft were converted for carrier operations by the installation of arrester hooks, and carrier-qualified naval aviators were recruited to fly them.\n\n\n1970‚Äì2000\nIn August 1970, two U-2Rs were deployed by the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) to cover the Israeli-Egypt conflict under the code name EVEN STEVEN [113]\n\n\n21st century\nThe U-2 remains in front-line service more than 60 years after its first flight, with the current U-2 beginning service in 1980 This is due primarily to its ability to change surveillance objectives on short notice, something that surveillance satellites cannot do In the mid-1990s, it was converted from the U-2R to the U-2S, receiving the GE F118 turbofan engine [139] The U-2 outlasted its Mach 3 replacement, the SR-71, which was retired in 1998 A classified budget document approved by the Pentagon on 23 December 2005 called for the U-2's termination no earlier than 2012, with some aircraft being retired by 2007 [140] In January 2006, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld announced the U-2's pending retirement as a cost-cutting measure during a larger reorganization and redefinition of the USAF's mission [141] Rumsfeld said that this would not impair the USAF's ability to gather intelligence, which would be done by satellites and a growing supply of unmanned RQ-4 Global Hawk reconnaissance aircraft.\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nData from Jane's all the World's Aircraft 1989‚Äì90, [211] U.S Air Force fact sheet, [212] and Lockheed Martin U-2S product card [213]\n\nTaiwan\nBeginning in the 1950s, Taiwan's Republic of China Air Force (ROCAF) used the RB-57D aircraft for reconnaissance missions over the People's Republic of China (PRC), but suffered two losses when MiG-17s and SA-2 surface-to-air missiles intercepted and downed the aircraft.\n\n\nVariants\nIn May 1961, in an attempt to extend the U-2's already considerable range, Lockheed modified six CIA U-2s and several USAF U-2s with aerial refueling equipment, which allowed the aircraft to receive fuel from either the KC-97 or from the KC-135 This extended the aircraft's range from approximately 4,000 to 8,000 nautical miles (7,400 to 15,000¬†km) and extended its endurance to more than 14 hours The J57-powered U-2Bs were re-designated U-2E and the J75-powered U-2Cs were redesignated U-2F [190] Each modified U-2 also included an additional oxygen cylinder However, pilot fatigue was not considered, and little use was made of the refueling capability The only U-2H was both air refueling-capable and carrier-capable [191] [192]\n\n\nPrimary

capable than the original aircraft A tactical reconnaissance version, the TR-1A, first flew in August 1981 A distinguishing feature of these aircraft is the addition of a large instrumentation \"superpod\" under each wing Designed for standoff tactical reconnaissance in Europe, the TR-1A was structurally identical to the U-2R The 17th Reconnaissance Wing, RAF Alconbury, England used operational TR-1As from 1983 until 1991 The last U-2 and TR-1 aircraft were delivered to USAF in October 1989 In 1992 all TR-1s were re-designated to U-2R for uniformity across the fleet The two-seat trainer variant of the TR-1, the TR-1B, was redesignated as the TU-2R After upgrading with the GE F-118-101 engine, the former U-2Rs were designated the U-2S Senior Year.\n\n\nER-2 details\nA derivative of the U-2 known as the ER-2 (Earth Resources 2), in NASA's white livery, is based at the Dryden Flight Research Center (now Armstrong Flight Research Center) and is used for high-altitude civilian research including Earth resources, celestial observations, atmospheric chemistry and dynamics, and oceanic processes Programs using the aircraft include the Airborne Science Program, ERAST and Earth Science Enterprise Landings are assisted by another pilot at speeds exceeding 120 miles per hour (190¬†km/h) in a chase car [193]\n\n\nOperators\nUnited States Air Force\n\n\nAircraft on
