Born on April 8, 1927, in Chicago, Illinois, Hersh has been a prominent voice in journalism for over six decades, earning numerous awards and honors for his work.\n\n**Early life and education**\nSeymour Hersh was born to a Jewish family in Chicago's West Side. His father, Isaac Hersh, was a grocer, and his mother, Dora Hersh, was a homemaker. Hersh's early life was marked by poverty, and his family often relied on government assistance programs to make ends meet. Despite these challenges, Hersh's parents encouraged his love of reading and learning, which would eventually lead him to become a journalist.\n\nHersh attended South Shore High School in Chicago, where he developed an interest in writing and politics. After graduating in 1945, he attended the University of Chicago, where he studied history and social sciences. However, he dropped out of college in 1948 to pursue a career in journalism.\n\n**Newspaper career**\nHersh began his journalism career in 1949 as a reporter for the _Chicago Sun-Times_, where he covered local politics and crime stories. In 1953, he joined the _Chicago Daily News_ as a reporter and later became the newspaper's city editor. Hersh's work at the _Daily News_ earned him recognition within the journalism community, and he was eventually recruited by the _New York Times_ in 1962.\n\n**My Lai massacre**\nHersh's most notable work during his time at the _New York Times_ was his investigation into the My Lai massacre, a brutal incident in which American soldiers killed hundreds of Vietnamese civilians in 1968. Hersh's reporting, which was published in 1970, exposed the atrocities committed by U.S. troops and led to widespread outrage and calls for reform. The story also contributed to the growing anti-war movement in the United States.\n\n**The New York Times**\nHersh's tenure at the _New York Times_ was marked by a series of high-profile investigations, including his reporting on the CIA's role in the 1973 Chilean coup and the Pentagon Papers, which revealed the U.S. government's secret involvement in the Vietnam War. Hersh's work at the _Times_ earned him a Pulitzer Prize in 1970, and he became known as one of the most respected investigative journalists of his generation.\n\n**Investigative books: 1980s and 1990s**\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Hersh began to focus on book-length investigations, publishing several critically acclaimed works, including _The Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House_ (1983), _The Samson Option: Israel's Nuclear Arsenal and American Foreign Policy_ (1991), and _My Lai 4: A Report on the Massacre and Its Aftermath_ (1970). Hersh's books provided in-depth analysis of international politics and the actions of government officials, further solidifying his reputation as a leading investigative journalist.\n\n**Later investigations**\nIn the 2000s, Hersh continued to investigate high-profile stories, including the Iraq War and the Abu Ghraib prison scandal. His reporting on these issues exposed the mistreatment of prisoners and the lack of accountability within the U.S. military.\n\n**Iraq and Abu Ghraib**\nHersh's investigation into the Abu Ghraib prison scandal, which was published in 2004, revealed widespread abuse and torture of Iraqi prisoners by U.S. soldiers. The story led to a firestorm of criticism and calls for reform within the military.\n\n**Iran**\nHersh's reporting on Iran, which was published in 2005, exposed the U.S. government's secret plans to overthrow the Iranian government. The story, which was based on anonymous sources, revealed a top-secret program aimed at destabilizing the Iranian regime.\n\n**Syria and chemical attacks**\nIn 2013, Hersh reported on the Syrian government's use of chemical attacks against civilians. The story, which was published in the _London Review of Books_, exposed the lack of evidence supporting the U.S. government's claims that the Syrian government was responsible for the attacks.\n\n**Killing of Osama bin Laden**\nHersh's investigation into the killing of Osama bin Laden, which was published in 2015, raised questions about the U.S. government's account of the raid. The story, which was based on anonymous sources, suggested that the U.S. government had knowingly killed an unarmed bin Laden, contradicting official claims that the al-Qaeda leader had been armed.\n\n**Nord Stream pipeline and Ukraine**\nIn 2022, Hersh reported on the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipeline, which runs from Russia to Germany. The story, which was published in _The Grayzone_, suggested that the U.S. government had orchestrated the sabotage to prevent Germany from becoming energy-independent from Russia.\n\n**Other statements**\nHersh has made several public statements and given speeches throughout his career, often addressing issues related to journalism, politics, and human rights. In 2016, he spoke at a conference on investigative journalism, where he criticized the rise of online media outlets and the decline of traditional journalism.\n\n**Murder of Seth Rich**\nHersh has been involved in controversy regarding the murder of Seth Rich, a young Democratic Party staffer who was killed in 2016. Hersh's reporting on the case, which suggested that Rich had been in contact with WikiLeaks, was widely criticized by the media and the Rich family.\n\n**Pat Nixon abuse**\nIn 2020, Hersh reported on the alleged abuse of Pat Nixon, the wife of President Richard Nixon, by her husband. The story, which was published in the _London Review of Books_, suggested that Pat Nixon had been subjected to physical and emotional abuse by her husband.\n\n**Use of anonymous sources**\nHersh has been criticized for his use of anonymous sources in his reporting. He has defended his methods, arguing that the use of anonymous sources is necessary to protect sources who may be at risk of retaliation or other forms of retribution.\n\n**Personal life**\nHersh has been married twice and has three children. He has been involved in various charitable organizations and has supported several causes related to human rights and social justice.\n\n**Awards and honors**\nHersh has received numerous awards and honors for his work, including:\n\n* Pulitzer Prize (1970)\n* George Polk Award (1969)\n* Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award (1970)\n* Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Award (1971)\n* Investigative Reporters and Editors Award (1994)\n* Overseas Press Club Award (2004)\n\n**Publications**\nHersh has published several books and articles throughout his career, including:\n\n* _My Lai 4: A Report on the Massacre and Its Aftermath_ (1970)\n* _The Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House_ (1983)\n* _The Samson Option: Israel's Nuclear Arsenal and American Foreign Policy_ (1991)\n* _Chain of Command: The Road from 9/11 to Abu Ghraib_ (2004)\n* _Chain of Command_ (2005)\n\nReferences:\nWorks Cited\n\nExternal links:\n* Seymour Hersh's official website\n* The Grayzone: Seymour Hersh's reporting on the Nord Stream pipeline\n* The London Review of Books: Seymour Hersh's reporting on the Syrian government's use of chemical attacks\n* The New York Times: Seymour Hersh's reporting on the My Lai massacre", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Seymour_Hersh\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#Newspaper career\n##My Lai massacre\n##The New York Times\n#Investigative books: 1980s and 1990s\n#Later investigations\n##Iraq and Abu Ghraib\n##Iran\n##Syria and chemical attacks\n##Killing of Osama bin Laden\n##Nord Stream pipeline and Ukraine\n#Other statements\n##Speeches\n##Murder of Seth Rich\n##Pat Nixon abuse\n#Use of anonymous sources\n#Personal life\n#Awards and honors\n#Publications\n##Books\n##Articles\n#References\n##Works cited\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is best known for his alleged crimes, including child murder and occult involvement, which led to his trial and execution. This article will explore his life, military career, and the events that led to his downfall.\n\n**House of Retz**\n\nGilles de Rais was born in ChamptocÃ©, Maine, to Guy de Rais, a nobleman, and Isabelle Le Maire. He was the second son of the family, and his family was part of the influential House of Retz. This house had a long history of producing notable figures, including bishops, nobles, and military leaders.\n\n### Early life\n\nGilles de Rais was educated in the traditional manner of a nobleman, receiving training in arms, literature, and music. He was also known for his exceptional physical strength and bravery, which earned him a reputation as a skilled fighter. During his youth, he was involved in several tournaments and battles, where he distinguished himself as a skilled warrior.\n\n### Matrimonial projects\n\nIn 1420, Gilles de Rais married Catherine de Thouars, a noblewoman from the House of Thouars. The marriage was arranged by his family, and it was intended to strengthen the ties between the two houses. However, the marriage was short-lived, as Catherine died in 1425. Gilles de Rais then became involved in a series of matrimonial projects, which ultimately failed to produce a stable and lasting relationship.\n\n### Family disputes\n\nThe de Rais family was known for its internal conflicts and power struggles. Gilles de Rais's older brother, Jean de Rais, was a powerful nobleman who held significant influence over the family's estates. However, the two brothers were at odds over the management of their family's affairs, which led to a series of disputes and tensions.\n\n### Titles, estates, and wealth\n\nAs a member of the House of Retz, Gilles de Rais inherited a significant amount of wealth and titles. He was the lord of a large estate in Maine, which included several castles, villages, and lands. He also held a number of titles, including the lordship of ChamptocÃ© and the seigniory of La Suze.\n\n**Military career**\n\nGilles de Rais's military career began during the Hundred Years' War, where he fought alongside the French army against the English. He quickly distinguished himself as a skilled and brave warrior, earning the respect of his comrades and superiors.\n\n### First hypothetical feat of arms\n\nOne of Gilles de Rais's most notable military achievements was his participation in the Battle of OrlÃ©ans, where he fought alongside Joan of Arc. According to legend, Gilles de Rais was instrumental in the French victory, but the details of his involvement are shrouded in mystery.\n\n### Franco-Breton alliance through the House of Valois-Anjou\n\nIn 1429, Gilles de Rais became involved in the Franco-Breton alliance, which aimed to bring an end to the Hundred Years' War. He allied himself with the House of Valois-Anjou, a powerful noble family that controlled a significant portion of France. This alliance marked the beginning of a new era in Gilles de Rais's military career, as he became a key figure in the French army's efforts to defeat the English.\n\n### Guerilla warfare against English garrisons on the borders of Maine\n\nIn the early 1430s, Gilles de Rais became involved in a series of guerrilla wars against English garrisons on the borders of Maine.

He was one of the few nobles who remained loyal to Joan throughout her trials and tribulations.\n\n### Civil wars between La TrÃ©moille and Richemont's allies\n\nIn the mid-1430s, Gilles de Rais became embroiled in a series of civil wars between the supporters of La TrÃ©moille and Richemont. These wars marked a significant turning point in Gilles de Rais's career, as he began to lose his influence and power.\n\n### Lifting of the siege of Lagny\n\nOne of Gilles de Rais's most notable military achievements was the lifting of the siege of Lagny. He led a series of raids against the English forces, using his knowledge of the terrain and his military skills to outmaneuver the enemy.\n\n### Reduction of military commitments\n\nIn the late 1430s, Gilles de Rais began to reduce his military commitments, focusing on his personal affairs and his family's estates. However, this decision marked the beginning of a period of decline for Gilles de Rais, as he lost his influence and power.\n\n**Squandering of heritage**\n\nGilles de Rais's decision to reduce his military commitments marked the beginning of a period of squandering of his heritage. He became embroiled in a series of financial and personal scandals, which ultimately led to his downfall.\n\n**Criminal life**\n\nIn the early 1440s, Gilles de Rais became embroiled in a series of criminal activities, including occultism and child murder. He was accused of using his wealth and influence to recruit children into his household, where they were subjected to physical and emotional abuse.\n\n### Occult involvement\n\nGilles de Rais was accused of being involved in a number of occult practices, including demonology and necromancy. He was said to have used his knowledge of the occult to gain power and influence over others.\n\n### Child murders\n\nGilles de Rais was accused of murdering a number of children in his household.

The Speaker is the presiding officer and leader of the House of Representatives.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe speaker election was a significant event in the history of the United States Congress, as it marked the first time in over 100 years that the House of Representatives had not chosen a speaker on the first ballot. The election was also notable for the fact that the Republican Party, which had won a majority of seats in the House in the 2022 midterm elections, was unable to agree on a candidate for speaker. The election was a complex and contentious process that lasted for several days, with multiple ballots and various candidates vying for the position.\n\n**Process and conventions**\n\nThe speaker election is governed by Article I, Section 2 of the United States Constitution, which states that the House of Representatives shall choose its own speaker. The Constitution also establishes the rules for the election, including the requirement that a majority of the members present and voting must support the candidate for speaker.\n\nThe speaker election typically takes place at the beginning of a new Congress, which is every two years. The election is usually a formality, with the majority party's candidate being elected on the first ballot. However, in the event that the majority party is unable to agree on a candidate, the election can become more complicated and contentious.\n\n**Democratic nomination**\n\nThe Democratic Party, which had won a minority of seats in the House in the 2022 midterm elections, nominated Hakeem Jeffries as its candidate for speaker. Jeffries, a congressman from New York, was a rising star in the Democratic Party and had been a vocal advocate for progressive policies.\n\n### Candidates\n\n**Nominee**\n\nIn November 2022, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) nominated Hakeem Jeffries as the party's candidate for speaker. Jeffries was a strong contender for the position, having served as a member of the House Democratic leadership team and having been a vocal advocate for progressive policies.\n\n**Declined to run**\n\nSeveral other Democrats declined to run for speaker, including Nancy Pelosi, who had served as speaker from 2007 to 2023. Pelosi had announced her intention to retire from Congress in 2022, and her decision not to run for speaker was seen as a significant development in the election.\n\n### Result\n\nThe Democratic nomination for speaker was uncontested, with Hakeem Jeffries being the only candidate nominated by the party.\n\n**Republican nomination**\n\nThe Republican Party, which had won a majority of seats in the House in the 2022 midterm elections, nominated Kevin McCarthy as its candidate for speaker. McCarthy, a congressman from California, had been a vocal advocate for conservative policies and had served as the House Minority Leader from 2019 to 2023.\n\n### Candidates\n\n**Nominee**\n\nIn November 2022, the Republican National Committee (RNC) nominated Kevin McCarthy as the party's candidate for speaker. McCarthy was a strong contender for the position, having served as a member of the House Republican leadership team and having been a vocal advocate for conservative policies.\n\n**Lost nomination**\n\nSeveral other Republicans declined to run for speaker, including Steve Scalise, who had been a contender for the position. Scalise had been a key figure in the House Republican leadership and had been a vocal advocate for conservative policies.\n\n### Results\n\nThe Republican nomination for speaker was also uncontested, with Kevin McCarthy being the only candidate nominated by the party.\n\n**Election of the speaker**\n\nThe election of the speaker was a complex and contentious process that lasted for several days. The election took place in the House of Representatives, with members voting on the floor of the chamber.\n\n### Background\n\nThe speaker election was a significant event in the history of the United States Congress, as it marked the first time in over 100 years that the House of Representatives had not chosen a speaker on the first ballot. The election was also notable for the fact that the Republican Party, which had won a majority of seats in the House in the 2022 midterm elections, was unable to agree on a candidate for speaker.\n\n### Candidates\n\nThe candidates for speaker included Hakeem Jeffries, Kevin McCarthy, and several other Republicans and Democrats. The candidates were vying for the position of speaker, which is the presiding officer and leader of the House of Representatives.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe speaker election was a complex and contentious process that lasted for several days. The election took place in the House of Representatives, with members voting on the floor of the chamber. The candidates for speaker included Hakeem Jeffries, Kevin McCarthy, and several other Republicans and Democrats.\n\n### Ballots 1â3 (January 3)\n\nThe first three ballots were held on January 3, 2023. The results were as follows:\n\n* Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY): 212 votes\n* Kevin McCarthy (R-CA): 203 votes\n* Other candidates: 14 votes\n\n### Ballots 4â6 (January 4)\n\nThe next three ballots were held on January 4, 2023.

This period, spanning from the 14th to the 16th century, produced some of the most iconic and influential works of sculpture in history.\n\n# Periods\n\nItalian Renaissance sculpture can be divided into several periods, each characterized by distinct styles, techniques, and influences.\n\n## To 1400\n\nDuring the early years of the Renaissance, sculpture was heavily influenced by Gothic and Byzantine styles. Artists such as Arnolfo di Cambio and Lorenzo Maitani created works that were often grandiose and decorative, but lacking in naturalism. The period saw the rise of the \"altarelievo\" technique, where low-relief sculpture was used to create intricate and detailed designs.\n\n## From 1400\n\nAs the Renaissance gained momentum, sculpture began to move towards greater naturalism and humanism. Artists such as Donatello and Michelangelo pioneered the use of classical techniques, such as modeling and chiseling, to create works that were both aesthetically pleasing and emotionally powerful. The period saw the emergence of the \"scultura in rilievo\" style, where three-dimensional figures were carved from stone or wood.\n\n### Doors of the Florence Baptistery\n\nOne of the most significant works of this period is the doors of the Florence Baptistery, created by Andrea Orcagna and his workshop. These doors, featuring scenes from the Old Testament, showcased the artist's skill in creating intricate and detailed designs.\n\n### Donatello\n\nDonatello, one of the most influential artists of the Renaissance, created works that were both innovative and emotionally powerful. His bronze statue of David, created around 1408-1409, is considered one of the greatest works of the period, showcasing the artist's mastery of classical techniques.\n\n### Middle of the century\n\nAs the Renaissance continued, sculpture began to take on a more humanistic tone. Artists such as Brunelleschi and Verrocchio created works that emphasized the beauty and dignity of the human form. The period saw the emergence of the \"portraiture\" style, where artists focused on capturing the likeness and personality of their subjects.\n\n### Lombardy\n\nLombardy, a region in northern Italy, produced some of the most significant works of the period. Artists such as Bernini and Cavalcaselle created sculptures that were both innovative and technically impressive.\n\n### Crisis of the 1490s\n\nThe 1490s saw a period of crisis in the art world, with the rise of the \"Quattrocento\" style, characterized by a focus on perspective and realism. This period saw the emergence of artists such as Leonardo, Michelangelo, and Raphael, who would go on to shape the course of Renaissance art.\n\n## 16th century\n\nThe 16th century saw a significant shift in the style of sculpture, with the emergence of the \"Mannerist\" and \"Late Renaissance\" styles.\n\n### Michelangelo\n\nMichelangelo, one of the greatest artists of the Renaissance, created works that were both innovative and emotionally powerful. His sculptures, such as the PietÃ  and the David, showcased the artist's mastery of classical techniques and his ability to capture the beauty and dignity of the human form.\n\n### Mannerist and Late Renaissance sculpture\n\nThe Mannerist style, characterized by a focus on elegance and subtlety, emerged in the 1520s. Artists such as Ammanati and Sansovino created works that were both refined and technically impressive. The Late Renaissance style, which emerged in the 1550s, saw a focus on classical forms and proportions, with artists such as Giambologna and Bartolomeo Ammannati creating works that were both beautiful and technically impressive.\n\n### Giambologna\n\nGiambologna, one of the greatest artists of the Late Renaissance, created works that were both innovative and technically impressive. His bronze statue of Mercury, created around 1560, is considered one of the greatest works of the period, showcasing the artist's mastery of classical techniques.\n\n# Italians abroad\n\nItalian sculptors were highly sought after by royal courts and churches throughout Europe, with many working abroad to create works that would be admired and revered by the nobility and clergy.\n\n# Settings\n\nSculpture was often displayed in public spaces, such as churches, palaces, and squares, where it could be seen and admired by the masses.\n\n## Churches and tombs\n\nChurches and tombs were often decorated with intricate and detailed sculptures, which served as a testament to the wealth and power of the patron.\n\n## Civic pride\n\nCities and towns often commissioned sculptures to showcase their civic pride and wealth. Fountains, in particular, were a popular choice, as they not only provided a source of water but also served as a symbol of the city's status.\n\n### Fountains\n\nFountains, such as the famous Trevi Fountain in Rome, were often decorated with intricate and detailed sculptures, which served as a testament to the wealth and power of the city.\n\n## Portraits\n\nPortraits, often in the form of busts or statues, were a popular choice for sculpture, as they allowed artists to capture the likeness and personality of their subjects.\n\n### Equestrian statues\n\nEquestrian statues, such as the famous statue of Marcus Aurelius in Rome, were often commissioned to commemorate great leaders and military victories.\n\n### Shoulder busts\n\nShoulder busts, such as the famous statue of Donatello's bronze statue of David, were often created to showcase the artist's skill in capturing the likeness and personality of their subjects.\n\n### Medals\n\nMedals, often small and intricately detailed, were a popular choice for sculpture, as they allowed artists to create works that were both beautiful and functional.\n\n## Small sculpture\n\nSmall sculpture, often in the form of figurines or reliefs, was a popular choice for artists, as it allowed them to experiment with new techniques and styles.\n\n# Workshops\n\nMany sculptors worked in workshops, alongside other artists and craftsmen, to create works that were both beautiful and technically impressive.\n\n## Women sculptors\n\nWomen sculptors, such as the famous artist, Maddalena Bufalini, were often overlooked in the history of art, but their contributions to the development of sculpture are undeniable.\n\n# Guilds\n\nGuilds, such as the Arte della Statua, played a significant role in the development of sculpture, as they provided a framework for artists to work together and share their skills and knowledge.\n\n# Patrons\n\nPatrons, such as the Medici family, played a significant role in the development of sculpture, as they provided financial support and commissions to artists.\n\n# Development of style\n\nThe development of style in sculpture was influenced by a variety of factors, including the emergence of new techniques, the rise of humanism, and the influence of classical art.\n\n## To 1400\n\nDuring the early years of the Renaissance, sculpture was heavily influenced by Gothic and Byzantine styles. Artists such as Arnolfo di Cambio and Lorenzo Maitani created works that were often grandiose and decorative, but lacking in naturalism.\n\n## From 1400\n\nAs the Renaissance gained momentum, sculpture began to move towards greater naturalism and humanism.

Its history spans over two millennia, with its roots in the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who is considered the central figure of Christianity. The history of Christianity can be broadly divided into several periods, from the early Christian communities to the present day.\n\n**#Early Christianity**\n\n###**##Jewish background**\n\nChristianity emerged from Judaism, with Jesus Christ being born into a Jewish family and performing his ministry in the Jewish context. The early Christian communities were composed of Jewish converts who continued to observe Jewish traditions and practices. The relationship between Christianity and Judaism has been complex, with periods of harmony and periods of conflict.\n\n###**##Apostolic Age (c. 30â100)**\n\nThe Apostolic Age refers to the period of time after the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, during which his followers established the Christian Church. The early Christian communities were led by the apostles, who were entrusted with the task of spreading the message of Jesus Christ. The apostles established a church structure, with bishops and deacons serving as leaders.\n\n####**###Developing church structure**\n\nThe early Christian Church developed a hierarchical structure, with bishops serving as leaders over local churches. The bishop of Rome, who would later become the Pope, held a position of authority over other bishops. The early Church also developed a system of sacraments, with baptism and the Eucharist being central to the Christian faith.\n\n####**###Early growth**\n\nThe early Christian communities experienced rapid growth, with converts coming from both Jewish and Gentile (non-Jewish) backgrounds. The apostles and other early Christian leaders traveled extensively, preaching the message of Jesus Christ and establishing churches in various parts of the Mediterranean world.\n\n**#Ante-Nicene period (100â312)**\n\n###**##Scripture**\n\nThe Ante-Nicene period refers to the time before the Council of Nicaea, which was a major ecumenical council that established the Nicene Creed. During this period, the Christian Church developed its scriptural canon, with the New Testament being finalized and the Old Testament being widely accepted. The early Church Fathers, such as Irenaeus and Tertullian, played a crucial role in shaping the Christian doctrine and tradition.\n\n###**##Early Christian art**\n\nEarly Christian art, which emerged during this period, was characterized by simplicity and symbolism. The art often depicted scenes from the life of Jesus Christ and the early Church, with the use of images and icons becoming increasingly widespread.\n\n###**##Persecutions and legalization**\n\nThe Ante-Nicene period was marked by numerous persecutions of Christians, with the Roman Empire being hostile to the Christian faith. However, with the reign of Emperor Constantine, the Church experienced a period of relative peace and even official recognition.\n\n**#Spread of Christianity to c. 300 AD**\n\n###**##Inclusivity, women and exclusivity**\n\nThe early Christian communities were characterized by a sense of inclusivity, with women and men being equally valued. However, as the Church grew and developed, there were periods of exclusivity, with the Church becoming increasingly patriarchal.\n\n###**##Moral practices**\n\nThe early Christian communities were known for their commitment to moral practices, with the emphasis on living a virtuous life being central to the Christian faith. The early Church Fathers, such as Justin Martyr and Clement of Alexandria, wrote extensively on moral theology and the importance of living a Christian life.\n\n**#Late antiquity (313â476)**\n\n###**##Conversion of Constantine**\n\nThe conversion of Emperor Constantine to Christianity marked a significant turning point in the history of the Church. Constantine's reign saw the Church experiencing a period of relative peace and official recognition, with the Church becoming increasingly influential in Roman society.\n\n###**##Christianity and the state**\n\nThe Late Antique period saw the Church becoming increasingly intertwined with the state, with bishops and clergy serving as advisors to emperors and other high-ranking officials. The Church also became increasingly responsible for education, charity, and healthcare.\n\n###**##Christianity and polytheism**\n\nThe Late Antique period saw the Church coming into contact with various polytheistic traditions, with the Church Fathers engaging in debates and discussions with representatives of these traditions.\n\n**#Early Middle Ages (476â842)**\n\n###**##Justinian I**\n\nThe reign of Emperor Justinian I saw the Church experiencing a period of significant growth and development, with the Code of Justinian being a major achievement of the Church.\n\n###**##Education**\n\nThe Early Middle Ages saw the Church becoming increasingly responsible for education, with schools and universities being established throughout Europe.\n\n###**##Law**\n\nThe Church played a significant role in shaping the law during the Early Middle Ages, with the Justinian Code being a major influence on Western law.\n\n###**##Monasticism**\n\nMonasticism became increasingly widespread during the Early Middle Ages, with monasteries and convents being established throughout Europe.\n\n###**##Art**\n\nThe Early Middle Ages saw the Church becoming increasingly influential in the development of art, with the use of images and icons becoming increasingly widespread.\n\n###**##Papal supremacy**\n\nThe Early Middle Ages saw the Church becoming increasingly centralized, with the Pope exercising greater authority over the Church.\n\n###**##Spread and growth of Christianity**\n\nThe Early Middle Ages saw Christianity spreading throughout Europe, with the Church becoming increasingly influential in Roman society.\n\n**#High Middle Ages (842â1299)**\n\n###**##Christendom 842-1099**\n\nThe High Middle Ages saw the Church becoming increasingly influential in European society, with the Church playing a significant role in the development of law, education, and art.\n\n###**##Tenth and eleventh century reform**\n\nThe High Middle Ages saw the Church experiencing significant reform, with the Cluniac reform movement and the Gregorian reform movement being major influences on the Church.\n\n###**##Investiture controversy (1078)**\n\nThe High Middle Ages saw the Church becoming increasingly centralized, with the Pope exercising greater authority over the Church.

The election was triggered by Truss's resignation on October 24, 2022, following a series of scandals and controversies during her premiership.\n\nBackground\n\n### Boris Johnson premiership and scandals\n\nThe Conservative Party leadership election was the second one in 2022, following the July 2022 Conservative Party leadership election which saw Liz Truss succeed Boris Johnson as Prime Minister. Johnson had become Prime Minister in 2019, following a leadership election in which he defeated Jeremy Hunt. Johnson's premiership was marked by several scandals, including the Partygate scandal, which involved allegations of parties being held at 10 Downing Street during the COVID-19 pandemic, violating lockdown rules.\n\n### Leadership election to succeed Johnson\n\nIn July 2022, Johnson announced that he would resign as Prime Minister, following a confidence vote in his leadership. The leadership election that followed saw Liz Truss emerge as the winner, defeating Rishi Sunak in the final round of voting by Conservative Party members. Truss became Prime Minister on September 6, 2022, and began to implement her economic policies, including a series of tax cuts and a plan to increase energy production.\n\n### Liz Truss premiership and scandals\n\nTruss's premiership was marked by several scandals, including the mini-budget scandal, which involved a series of tax cuts and economic policies that were widely criticized by economists and experts. The scandal led to a sharp decline in the value of the pound and a rise in interest rates. Truss also faced criticism for her handling of the Northern Ireland Protocol, which involved the Northern Ireland border and the UK's withdrawal from the EU.\n\n### Calls for Truss's resignation\n\nFollowing the mini-budget scandal, there were growing calls for Truss's resignation, including from within her own party. The opposition parties, including Labour and the Liberal Democrats, also called for Truss's resignation. The pressure on Truss continued to build, and on October 20, 2022, she announced that she would resign as Prime Minister, effective October 25, 2022.\n\n### Resignations and vote on fracking\n\nThe day before Truss's resignation, two of her cabinet ministers, Jeremy Hunt and Rishi Sunak, resigned, citing the need for a change in leadership. The resignation of Hunt and Sunak was seen as a significant blow to Truss's leadership, and it was widely reported that they had been considering resigning for several days. The vote on fracking was also seen as a significant issue, with many Conservative Party members opposing the policy.\n\n### Liz Truss resigns\n\nOn October 24, 2022, Liz Truss officially resigned as Prime Minister, effective October 25, 2022. She was the shortest-serving Prime Minister in British history, serving for just 49 days. The Conservative Party leadership election that followed was triggered by Truss's resignation, and it was widely reported that the election would be a contest between Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss's other cabinet ministers.\n\nCampaign\n\nThe Conservative Party leadership election campaign began immediately after Truss's resignation, with several cabinet ministers announcing their intention to run. The campaign was marked by a series of debates, hustings, and rallies, as the candidates sought to win the support of Conservative Party members. The campaign was also marked by a series of controversies, including a row over the party's stance on fracking.\n\nElection process\n\nThe Conservative Party leadership election process involved a series of rounds of voting, with Conservative Party members voting to select the next leader. The election process was similar to the one that had been used in the July 2022 Conservative Party leadership election. The first round of voting saw several candidates eliminated, with the remaining candidates going on to the next round.\n\nCandidates\n\n### Declared\n\nSeveral cabinet ministers declared their intention to run in the leadership election, including:\n\n* Rishi Sunak: The former Chancellor of the Exchequer, who had served in the cabinet during Boris Johnson's premiership.\n* Liz Truss's other cabinet ministers: Several other cabinet ministers, including Jeremy Hunt, who had served as Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Suella Braverman, who had served as Home Secretary.\n\n### Withdrawn\n\nSeveral candidates withdrew from the leadership election, including:\n\n* Sajid Javid: The former Health Secretary, who had served in the cabinet during Boris Johnson's premiership.\n* Nadhim Zahawi: The former Chancellor of the Exchequer, who had served in the cabinet during Boris Johnson's premiership.\n\n### Explored\n\nSeveral other candidates explored the possibility of running in the leadership election, including:\n\n* Michael Gove: The former Chancellor of the Exchequer, who had served in the cabinet during Boris Johnson's premiership.\n* Grant Shapps: The former Transport Secretary, who had served in the cabinet during Boris Johnson's premiership.\n\n### Declined\n\nSeveral other candidates declined to run in the leadership election, including:\n\n* Boris Johnson: The former Prime Minister, who had announced that he would not run in the leadership election.\n* Jeremy Hunt: The former Chancellor of the Exchequer, who had served in the cabinet during Boris Johnson's premiership.\n\nEndorsements\n\nSeveral Conservative Party members and politicians endorsed candidates in the leadership election, including:\n\n* Michael Gove: Gove endorsed Rishi Sunak in the leadership election.\n* Grant Shapps: Shapps endorsed Rishi Sunak in the leadership election.\n* Suella Braverman: Braverman endorsed Rishi Sunak in the leadership election.\n\nResponses\n\nSeveral Conservative Party members and politicians responded to the leadership election, including:\n\n* Rishi Sunak: Sunak said that he was \"honored\" to be running in the leadership election.\n* Liz Truss: Truss said that she was \"sad\" to be leaving the leadership election.\n\nPolling\n\n### Conservative members\n\nSeveral polls were conducted to gauge the views of Conservative Party members on the leadership election, including:\n\n* A poll conducted by Conservative Home: The poll found that Rishi Sunak was the most popular candidate among Conservative Party members, with 34% of the vote.\n* A poll conducted by the Daily Telegraph: The poll found that Rishi Sunak was the most popular candidate among Conservative Party members, with 35% of the vote.\n\n### 2019 Conservative voters\n\nSeveral polls were conducted to gauge the views of 2019 Conservative voters on the leadership election, including:\n\n* A poll conducted by the Daily Telegraph: The poll found that Rishi Sunak was the most popular candidate among 2019 Conservative voters, with 32% of the vote.\n* A poll conducted by ITV News: The poll found that Rishi Sunak was the most popular candidate among 2019 Conservative voters, with 33% of the vote.\n\n### General population\n\nSeveral polls were conducted to gauge the views of the general population on the leadership election, including:\n\n* A poll conducted by YouGov: The poll found that Rishi Sunak was the most popular candidate in the general population, with 27% of the vote.\n* A poll conducted by Ipsos MORI: The poll found that Rishi Sunak was the most popular candidate in the general population, with 28% of the vote.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"October_2022_Conservative_Party_leadership_election\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Boris Johnson premiership and scandals\n##Leadership election to succeed Johnson\n##Liz Truss premiership and scandals\n##Calls for Truss's resignation\n##Resignations and vote on fracking\n##Liz Truss resigns\n#Campaign\n#Election process\n#Candidates\n##Declared\n##Withdrawn\n##Explored\n##Declined\n#Endorsements\n#Responses\n#Polling\n##Conservative members\n##2019 Conservative voters\n##General population\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The novel is a complex and ambitious work that combines elements of philosophy, history, and art to explore the nature of resistance and the human condition.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance is a sprawling and fragmented narrative that defies easy summary. The novel is structured around a series of vignettes, each of which explores a different aspect of resistance and its relationship to art, culture, and politics. The story is centered around a group of characters, including an unnamed narrator, a Marxist philosopher, and a group of workers, who are all struggling to come to terms with the complexities of resistance in the face of oppression.\n\nThroughout the novel, Weiss explores a wide range of themes and ideas, including the nature of class struggle, the role of art in society, and the relationship between ideology and reality. The novel is also notable for its use of historical and cultural references, which are often woven together in complex and unexpected ways.\n\n**Form features and structure**\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance is a highly experimental work that rejects traditional notions of narrative and structure. The novel is composed of a series of vignettes, each of which is written in a different style and tone. Weiss draws on a wide range of literary and artistic traditions, including Romanticism, Expressionism, and Surrealism, to create a unique and hybrid form of writing.\n\nThe novel also incorporates a range of other forms and media, including poetry, drama, and visual art. Weiss uses a range of different techniques, including collage, montage, and pastiche, to create a dynamic and multi-layered text.\n\n**History of origins and publication**\n\n**Beginning**\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance was first conceived in the early 1970s, during a period of intense political and cultural upheaval in Germany. Weiss was deeply influenced by the student movement and the squatting movement, which were both challenging the existing social and economic order.\n\n**Research**\n\nWeiss spent several years researching the novel, drawing on a wide range of sources, including literature, art, and history. He was particularly interested in the work of the Surrealists, who were also exploring the relationship between art and politics.\n\n**Writer's block**\n\nWeiss struggled with writer's block throughout the composition of the novel. He was torn between his desire to create a work of art that was both beautiful and meaningful, and his commitment to exploring the complexities of resistance.\n\n**The third volume**\n\nThe third volume of the novel was published in 1981, several years after the first two volumes. Weiss had been working on the novel in fits and starts, and the final volume was rushed into print after his death.\n\n**Sweden and the GDR**\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance was published in Sweden and the GDR (East Germany) in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The novel was widely praised in both countries for its innovative form and its commitment to exploring the complexities of resistance.\n\n**Other translations**\n\nThe novel was translated into several other languages, including English, French, Spanish, and Italian. The English translation was published in 1984, several years after the novel's initial publication in Germany.\n\n**Textual forms**\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance incorporates a wide range of textual forms, including poetry, drama, and visual art. Weiss draws on a range of different techniques, including collage, montage, and pastiche, to create a dynamic and multi-layered text.\n\n**Artists and artworks in the novel**\n\nThe novel is notable for its inclusion of a wide range of artworks and artists, including:\n\n* **Divine Comedy**: Weiss uses Dante's Divine Comedy as a central reference point for the novel, exploring the relationship between art and politics.\n* **Central artworks**: The novel includes a range of central artworks, including a painting of the Last Judgment and a sculpture of a worker.\n* **Questions**: Weiss also includes a range of questions and puzzles throughout the novel, which challenge the reader to think critically about the nature of resistance.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance received mixed reactions in culture, both in Germany and worldwide. Some critics praised the novel's innovative form and its commitment to exploring the complexities of resistance, while others found it confusing and inaccessible.\n\n**Mixed reactions in culture**\n\n* **Germany**: The novel was widely praised in Germany for its innovative form and its commitment to exploring the complexities of resistance. However, some critics found it confusing and inaccessible.\n* **Worldwide**: The novel received mixed reactions worldwide, with some critics praising its innovative form and others finding it confusing and inaccessible.\n\n**Reading groups**\n\nThe novel has been the subject of several reading groups and academic studies, which have explored its themes and ideas in depth.\n\n**Intermedial reception**\n\nThe novel has also been the subject of several intermedial studies, which have explored its relationship to other forms of art and media.\n\n**Radio play**\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance was adapted into a radio play in the 1980s, which was widely praised for its innovative form and its commitment to exploring the complexities of resistance.\n\n**Film**\n\nThe novel was adapted into a film in the 1990s, which was widely praised for its innovative form and its commitment to exploring the complexities of resistance.\n\n**Musical recordings**\n\nThe novel has been the subject of several musical recordings, including a symphony and a opera.\n\n**See also**\n\n* **Literature**: The Aesthetics of Resistance is part of a larger literary tradition that explores the relationship between art and politics.\n* **Thesis**: The novel can be seen as a thesis on the nature of resistance and its relationship to art and culture.\n* **English editions in print**: The novel has been published in several English editions in print, including a Penguin Classics edition and a New Directions edition.\n* **GDR reception**: The novel was widely praised in the GDR for its innovative form and its commitment to exploring the complexities of resistance.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article has no references", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"The_Aesthetics_of_Resistance\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Form features and structure\n#History of origins and publication\n##Beginning\n##Research\n##Writers block\n##The third volume\n##Sweden and the GDR\n##Other translations\n#Textual forms\n#Artists and artworks in the novel\n##Divine Comedy\n##Central artworks\n##Questions\n#Reception\n##Mixed reactions in culture\n###Germany\n##Worldwide\n##Reading groups\n##Intermedial Reception\n#Radio play\n#Film\n#Musical recordings\n#See also\n#Literature\n##Thesis\n##English editions in print\n##GDR reception\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The UPA's anti-Soviet resistance was marked by periods of intense fighting, guerrilla warfare, and brutal reprisals.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe UPA's anti-Soviet resistance was a culmination of decades of Ukrainian nationalist sentiment, which had been suppressed by the Soviet authorities. The OUN, founded in 1929, was a radical nationalist organization that sought to establish an independent Ukrainian state. The UPA, formed in 1942, was the military wing of the OUN and was committed to fighting against the Soviet occupation of Ukraine.\n\n## Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists\n\nThe OUN was founded by a group of Ukrainian nationalists, including Eugeniy Konovalets, Andriy Melnyk, and Stepan Bandera. The organization's initial goal was to establish an independent Ukrainian state, but it soon became radicalized and began to advocate for the creation of an all-Ukrainian state, which would include parts of Poland and other neighboring countries. The OUN was divided into two main factions: the OUN-M, led by Melnyk, and the OUN-B, led by Bandera. The OUN-B was more radical and violent than the OUN-M and was responsible for many of the atrocities committed during the war.\n\n## Outbreak of the war\n\nThe German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 caught the UPA off guard, and the organization was initially unable to respond effectively. However, as the Germans advanced into Ukraine, the UPA saw an opportunity to launch a guerrilla war against the Soviet authorities. The UPA's initial strategy was to attack Soviet military units, disrupt supply lines, and gather intelligence on Soviet troop movements.\n\n## Creation of OUN-B, pogroms, and anti-Soviet uprising\n\nThe OUN-B, le", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Anti-Soviet_resistance_by_the_Ukrainian_Insurgent_Army\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists\n##Outbreak of the war\n##Creation of OUN-B, pogroms, and anti-Soviet uprising\n##Creation of UPA, anti-German uprising, and extermination of Poles\n#Armed resistance during the war (1944â1945)\n##Fights in Volhynia and Podolia (first half of 1944)\n##After German expulsion from Ukraine\n###Battle of Zaliznytsia (28 April 1944)\n###Battle of Piryatin (19 August 1944)\n###Battle of Karov (29â30 August 1944)\n###Battle of Urman village (17 September 1944)\n###Battle of Univ (30 Septemberâ1 October 1944)\n###Battle of Leszczawa GÃ³rna (28 October 1944)\n###Impeding mobilization of Ukrainians to the Red Army\n###Attacks on cities in 1944\n###Attacks on the railways\n##Fights in 1945\n###Elimination of \"Klim Savur\"\n###UPA attacks on cities in 1945\n#Post-war period\n##Contacts with the special services of the West\n##Final suppression of the insurgency\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#Bibliography\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The Lakota religion is deeply rooted in the tribe's history, culture, and geography, and is characterized by a rich and nuanced cosmology, complex rituals, and a profound respect for the natural world.\n\n# Definition and Classification\n\nThe Lakota religion is often classified as a form of animism, which is a spiritual tradition that attributes spiritual significance to non-human entities such as animals, plants, and natural features. However, the Lakota religion is more accurately described as a holistic spiritual tradition that encompasses a wide range of spiritual practices and beliefs. The Lakota religion is also closely tied to the tribe's cultural and historical context, and is heavily influenced by the tribe's traditional way of life as hunters and gatherers.\n\n# Beliefs\n\n## WakÊ½Ä and WakÊ½Ä TÊ½ÄkÄ\n\nAt the heart of Lakota spirituality is the concept of WakÊ½Ä, which refers to the Great Spirit or the Ultimate Reality. WakÊ½Ä is considered to be the source of all life and energy in the universe, and is often depicted as a powerful and benevolent force. The WakÊ½Ä TÊ½ÄkÄ, or the \"WakÊ½Ä People,\" are the spirits that inhabit the world and are believed to be responsible for maintaining balance and order in the universe.

The Lakota people were skilled hunters and gatherers, and were known for their expertise in horse breeding and riding.\n\n## Encounters with Christianity and Colonialism\n\nThe Lakota people had their first encounters with Christianity and colonialism in the 16th century, when European explorers and settlers began to arrive in the Great Plains region. The Lakota people were initially resistant to the ideas and practices of Christianity, and instead maintained their traditional spiritual practices and way of life. However, the Lakota people were eventually forced to adapt to the changing circumstances of colonialism, and many were forcibly converted to Christianity.\n\n## Revivalism\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Lakota people experienced a revival of their traditional spiritual practices and way of life. This revival was led by a variety of spiritual leaders and medicine men, who worked to preserve and promote the traditional spiritual practices and way of life of the Lakota people.

The election was the sixth assembly election since the restoration of devolution in 2007.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Electoral events\n\nThe election was held under the single transferable vote (STV) system, with each of the 18 constituencies electing 5 members. The election was a result of a collapse in the power-sharing agreement between the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in, which had ruled the assembly since 2020.\n\n### Leadership changes\n\nIn the months leading up to the election, both parties had experienced leadership changes. The DUP leader, Jeffrey Donaldson, had taken over in April 2021 after Edwin Poots' leadership was short-lived. Sinn FÃ©in had also seen a change in leadership, with Mary Lou McDonald being replaced by Michelle O'Neill as the party's leader in the assembly.\n\n### Northern Ireland Protocol\n\nThe election took place against the backdrop of the ongoing Northern Ireland Protocol controversy. The protocol, implemented as part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, had created tensions between the UK and EU. The DUP, in particular, had been vocal in its opposition to the protocol, which it saw as threatening the UK's sovereignty. The election campaign saw both parties emphasizing their positions on the protocol, with the DUP advocating for its removal and Sinn FÃ©in arguing for its retention.\n\n### Calls for early election\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the election, there had been calls for an early election from both parties, as well as from other politicians. The election was ultimately called in March 2022, with a date set for May 5.\n\n**Candidates**\n\nA total of 656 candidates stood for election, with 431 of those candidates being women. The largest number of candidates came from Sinn FÃ©in, with 75 candidates, followed by the DUP with 59, and the Alliance Party with 46.\n\n**Members not seeking re-election**\n\nSeveral members of the outgoing assembly had announced their decision not to seek re-election. These included DUP members Paul Givan, who had served as First Minister, and Edwin Poots, as well as Sinn FÃ©in member Michelle Gildernew.\n\n**Campaign**\n\nThe election campaign was dominated by issues related to the Northern Ireland Protocol and the UK's departure from the EU. The DUP, in particular, campaigned on a platform of opposing the protocol and advocating for its removal. Sinn FÃ©in, on the other hand, argued for the retention of the protocol and the importance of maintaining the Good Friday Agreement.\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nThroughout the campaign, several opinion polls were conducted to gauge public opinion.

The surgery is performed to restore vision and improve the quality of life for individuals with cataracts.\n\n**Uses**\n\nCataract surgery is used to treat cataracts, which are a common cause of vision loss and blindness worldwide. Cataracts occur when the lens in the eye becomes cloudy or opaque, preventing light from passing through and reaching the retina. The surgery is typically recommended for individuals with vision loss or blindness due to cataracts, and can be performed on individuals of any age.\n\n**Techniques**\n\nThere are several techniques used in cataract surgery, including:\n\n* **Phacoemulsification**: This is the most common technique used in cataract surgery, where the cloudy lens is broken up and removed using an ultrasonic handpiece.\n* **Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS)**: This technique involves making a small incision in the cornea and removing the cloudy lens manually.\n* **Extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE)**: This technique involves removing the cloudy lens while leaving the elastic capsule that surrounds the lens intact.\n* **Converting to ECCE to manage a contingency**: In some cases, the surgeon may need to convert to ECCE during the surgery if the cloudy lens is too hard to remove using phacoemulsification.\n\n**Pre-operative evaluation**\n\nBefore undergoing cataract surgery, individuals should undergo a thorough pre-operative evaluation to determine the best course of treatment. This evaluation typically includes:\n\n### **Contraindications**\n\nCertain conditions may contraindicate cataract surgery, including:\n\n* Active eye infections or inflammation\n* Glaucoma or other eye conditions that may affect the outcome of the surgery\n* History of eye surgery or trauma\n* Certain medical conditions, such as bleeding disorders or diabetes\n\n### **Selection of intraocular lenses**\n\nThe choice of IOL depends on several factors, including the individual's age, vision needs, and overall health. There are several types of IOLs available, including monofocal, multifocal, and accommodating IOLs.\n\n**Operation procedures**\n\n### **Preparation**\n\nBefore the surgery, the individual's eye will be cleaned and prepared for the procedure. The individual may be given a local anesthetic to numb the eye, and a speculum may be placed to keep the eye open.\n\n### **Anaesthesia**\n\nLocal anesthesia, such as topical anesthesia or regional anesthesia, is typically used to numb the eye during the surgery. The individual may also be given sedation to help them relax.\n\n### **Phacoemulsification**\n\nThe phacoemulsification procedure involves making a small incision in the cornea and using an ultrasonic handpiece to break up and remove the cloudy lens. The lens fragments are then suctioned out of the eye using a gentle vacuum.\n\n### **Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS)**\n\nThe MSICS procedure involves making a small incision in the cornea and removing the cloudy lens manually. This procedure is typically used for harder cataracts.\n\n### **Extracapsular cataract extraction**\n\nThe ECCE procedure involves removing the cloudy lens while leaving the elastic capsule that surrounds the lens intact. This procedure is typically used for harder cataracts.\n\n### **Converting to ECCE to manage a contingency**\n\nIn some cases, the surgeon may need to convert to ECCE during the surgery if the cloudy lens is too hard to remove using phacoemulsification.\n\n### **Closing the wound**\n\nAfter the cloudy lens has been removed, the incision is closed with a small suture or stitch.\n\n**Post-operative care**\n\nAfter the surgery, the individual will need to rest and follow a post-operative care routine to ensure proper healing and minimize complications. This may include:\n\n* Anti-inflammatory drops to reduce swelling and inflammation\n* Antibiotic drops to prevent infection\n* Pain medication to manage discomfort\n* Follow-up appointments with the surgeon to monitor progress and remove stitches\n\n**Complications**\n\nComplications can occur during or after cataract surgery, including:\n\n### **During surgery**\n\nComplications that can occur during surgery include:\n\n* Bleeding or hemorrhage\n* Injury to the retina or other eye structures\n* Infection or endophthalmitis\n* Cataract recurrence\n\n### **After surgery**\n\nComplications that can occur after surgery include:\n\n* Infection or endophthalmitis\n* Vision loss or blindness\n* Cataract recurrence\n* Glaucoma or eye pressure\n* Dry eye or eye irritation\n\n### **Risk**\n\nThe risks associated with cataract surgery include:\n\n* Infection or endophthalmitis\n* Bleeding or hemorrhage\n* Injury to the retina or other eye structures\n* Cataract recurrence\n* Glaucoma or eye pressure\n* Dry eye or eye irritation\n\n**Recovery and rehabilitation**\n\nThe recovery time for cataract surgery varies depending on the individual and the type of surgery performed. Most individuals can expect to recover within a few days to a week. During this time, it is essential to follow the post-operative care routine and attend follow-up appointments with the surgeon.\n\n**Outcomes**\n\nThe outcomes of cataract surgery are typically excellent, with most individuals experiencing improved vision and a significant reduction in symptoms. However, the success of the surgery depends on several factors, including the individual's overall health, the type of cataract, and the type of IOL used.\n\n**History**\n\nCataract surgery has a long history dating back to ancient civilizations. The first recorded cataract surgery was performed by the Indian physician Sushruta in the 6th century BC. In the 19th century, the first successful cataract surgery using a surgical knife was performed by the British physician John Herbert Parsons.\n\n**Accessibility**\n\nCataract surgery is a widely available procedure, with access to surgery varying depending on the country and region.\n\n### **Europe**\n\nIn Europe, cataract surgery is widely available and affordable, with most countries having a public or private healthcare system that provides access to surgery.\n\n### **Asia**\n\nIn Asia, cataract surgery is also widely available, with many countries having a public or private healthcare system that provides access to surgery.\n\n### **Africa**\n\nIn Africa, cataract surgery is less widely available, with many countries having limited access to surgery due to lack of resources or infrastructure.\n\n### **Latin America**\n\nIn Latin America, cataract surgery is widely available, with many countries having a public or private healthcare system that provides access to surgery.\n\n**Social, economic and environmental relevance**\n\nCataract surgery has significant social, economic, and environmental relevance, particularly in developing countries where cataracts are a major cause of blindness and disability.\n\n**Special populations**\n\nCataract surgery can be challenging in certain populations, including:\n\n### **Congenital cataracts**\n\nCongenital cataracts are a rare condition where the lens in the eye is cloudy or opaque from birth. Cataract surgery can be challenging in these cases, and may require specialized techniques and equipment.\n\n### **Higher risk for operations on separate occasions**\n\nIndividuals who have had previous eye surgery or trauma may be at higher risk for complications during cataract surgery.\n\n**Other animals**\n\nCataract surgery is not limited to humans, and can be performed on animals, including dogs, cats, and horses.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Intraocular lens\n* Cataract\n* Eye surgery\n* Glaucoma\n* Dry eye\n* Endophthalmitis\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is intended for general information purposes only and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not include any references.\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* For further information on cataract surgery, please refer to the following resources:\n\t+ American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO)\n\t+ National Eye Institute (NEI)\n\t+ World Health Organization (WHO)\n\n**External links**\n\n* American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO)\n* National Eye Institute (NEI)\n* World Health Organization (WHO)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Cataract_surgery\" following this outline:\n\n#Uses\n#Techniques\n#Pre-operative evaluation\n##Contraindications\n##Selection of intraocular lenses\n#Operation procedures\n##Preparation\n##Anaesthesia\n##Phacoemulsification\n##Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS)\n##Extracapsular cataract extraction\n##Converting to ECCE to manage a contingency\n##Closing the wound\n#Post-operative care\n#Complications\n##During surgery\n##After surgery\n##Risk\n#Recovery and rehabilitation\n#Outcomes\n#History\n#Accessibility\n##Europe\n##Asia\n##Africa\n##Latin America\n#Social, economic and environmental relevance\n#Special populations\n##Congenital cataracts\n##Higher risk for operations on separate occasions\n#Other animals\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The company was founded in 1974 and has since become one of the largest construction companies in the country. The Shepherd Building Group has a diverse portfolio of construction projects, including residential, commercial, and industrial developments.\n\n# History\n\n## Main Contractor\n\nThe Shepherd Building Group was founded in 1974 by Peter Shepherd. Initially, the company operated as a small building contractor, with a focus on residential projects. Over the years, the company experienced rapid growth and expansion, and by the 1980s, it had become a major player in the construction industry. In 1997, the company was acquired by the Shepherd Group, a private equity firm.\n\n## Manufactured Products\n\nIn the 1990s, the Shepherd Building Group expanded its operations to include the manufacture of building components, such as windows, doors, and roof trusses. The company established a number of factories across the UK, which produced high-quality building products. The manufactured products division of the company became a significant contributor to its overall revenue.\n\n## Disposal of Non-Core Businesses\n\nIn the early 2000s, the Shepherd Building Group disposed of its non-core businesses, including its manufacturing operations. The company sold its factories and transferred its manufacturing operations to third-party contractors. This move allowed the company to focus on its core construction business and to reduce its overhead costs.\n\n# Notable Construction Projects\n\nThe Shepherd Building Group has completed a number of notable construction projects across the UK. Some of the company's most notable projects include:\n\n* The redevelopment of the former Liverpool Street Station in London, which involved the construction of a new office building and the refurbishment of the station's historic faÃ§ade.\n* The construction of the new Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro, which was completed in 2010.\n* The redevelopment of the former docklands area in Liverpool, which involved the construction of new residential and commercial buildings.\n* The construction of the new Sainsbury's supermarket in Leeds, which was completed in 2012.\n\n# Controversies\n\nThe Shepherd Building Group has been involved in a number of controversies over the years. Some of the company's most notable controversies include:\n\n## Identity Behind Anonymous Emails\n\nIn 2006, the Shepherd Building Group was at the center of a controversy surrounding anonymous emails sent to the company's employees. The emails, which were sent from a pseudonymous account, contained threatening and abusive messages. The company's management was criticized for its handling of the situation, and an investigation was launched by the police.\n\n## Hand Tool Vibration\n\nIn 2010, the Shepherd Building Group was criticized for its use of hand-held power tools that were exempt from the Control of Vibration at Work Regulations. The company was accused of putting its employees at risk of developing hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS), a condition that can cause permanent damage to the hands and wrists.\n\n## Domain Name Disputes\n\nIn 2011, the Shepherd Building Group was involved in a dispute over the ownership of the domain name \"shepherdconstruction.com\". The company claimed that the domain name was a generic name that should not be registered by any company, while the domain name's owner argued that the name was a legitimate business name.\n\n## Employment Blacklisting\n\nIn 2013, the Shepherd Building Group was accused of being involved in the blacklisting of construction workers. The company was accused of providing information to a blacklist of workers who were deemed to be \"undesirable\" by the construction industry.\n\n## Trinity Walk\n\nIn 2016, the Shepherd Building Group was involved in a controversy surrounding the development of the Trinity Walk shopping center in Wakefield. The company was accused of using a loophole in the planning laws to avoid paying a fair market price for the land.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Construction industry in the United Kingdom\n* Shepherd Group\n* Building regulations in the United Kingdom\n* Health and safety in the construction industry\n* Hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Shepherd_Building_Group\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Main contractor\n##Manufactured products\n##Disposal of non core businesses\n#Notable construction projects\n#Controversies\n##Identity behind anonymous emails\n##Hand tool vibration\n##Domain name disputes\n##Employment blacklisting\n##Trinity Walk\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

As the war progressed, the black market grew in size and complexity, involving various actors and networks that operated in secret to supply goods and services to those in need.\n\n**Background**\n\n### 1930s: Inflation, Instability, and Unrest\n\nThe interwar period in France was marked by economic instability, high inflation, and social unrest. The Great Depression had a devastating impact on the French economy, leading to widespread poverty and unemployment. The government's attempts to address these issues were often ineffective, creating a sense of disillusionment among the population. This climate of uncertainty and discontent laid the groundwork for the emergence of a black market in France.\n\n### Fall of France\n\nThe fall of France in June 1940, following the German invasion, marked a turning point in the country's history. The Vichy government, led by Marshal Philippe PÃ©tain, took power and implemented a range of policies aimed at maintaining order and stability. However, these measures only served to exacerbate the economic crisis, leading to widespread poverty and hunger. The black market, which had existed in some form before the war, began to grow in size and importance as people sought to supplement their meager rations.\n\n**1940-1941**\n\n### Origins\n\nThe black market in wartime France had several origins, including:\n\n#### Rationing and Price Controls\n\nThe Vichy government introduced a range of rationing and price controls in an attempt to manage the country's resources and stabilize the economy. However, these measures only served to create a shortage of essential goods, driving up prices and creating an incentive for people to seek out illicit supplies.\n\n#### Diversion from Official Channels\n\nAs the black market grew, people began to divert goods from official channels, either by stealing from warehouses or by surreptitiously selling goods that were meant for the official market.\n\n#### Clandestine Networks\n\nClandestine networks of smugglers and traders emerged, operating in secret to supply goods and services to those in need. These networks often involved complex webs of relationships and alliances, and were frequently linked to organized crime.\n\n#### Hidden Stockpiling\n\nSome individuals and businesses began to stockpile goods in secret, either in anticipation of future shortages or to evade the authorities. This hidden stockpiling contributed to the growth of the black market and helped to create a culture of hoarding and speculation.\n\n#### Grey Market\n\nThe grey market, also known as the \"petit marchÃ©,\" emerged as a way for people to buy and sell goods outside of the official market. This market operated in a grey area, with traders often using coded language and clandestine meetings to avoid detection.\n\n### Users of the Black Market\n\nThe black market in wartime France was used by a variety of individuals and groups, including:\n\n#### Privileged French\n\nThe black market was a vital source of supply for the privileged French, who were able to use their connections and resources to access goods and services that were unavailable to the general population.\n\n#### Occupation Forces\n\nThe German occupation forces also used the black market to supply themselves with goods and services, often at the expense of the local population.\n\n### Public Response\n\nThe public response to the black market was complex and varied, with many people viewing it as a necessary evil in a time of crisis. However, others saw it as a symbol of the moral decay of French society and a threat to the social order.\n\n#### Early Condemnation\n\nIn the early years of the occupation, the black market was widely condemned by the Vichy government and the French media, who saw it as a threat to the country's moral values and social cohesion.\n\n#### Participation\n\nDespite the condemnation, many people participated in the black market, either out of necessity or as a way to access goods and services that were unavailable through official channels.\n\n#### Housewives' Demonstrations\n\nIn some cases, housewives organized demonstrations and protests to demand better access to food and other essential goods, highlighting the impact of the black market on their daily lives.\n\n#### Suspicions of Hoarding\n\nAs the black market grew, suspicions of hoarding and speculation began to emerge, with some people accusing others of stockpiling goods for personal gain.\n\n#### Official Antisemitism\n\nThe Vichy government and some elements of the French population also used the black market as a pretext for antisemitic attacks, accusing Jewish businesspeople and traders of hoarding and speculation.\n\n#### Public Opinion\n\nPublic opinion on the black market was complex and varied, with some people viewing it as a necessary evil and others seeing it as a symbol of the moral decay of French society.\n\n#### Political Opposition\n\nThe black market was also used by some elements of the French Resistance as a way to undermine the Vichy government and the German occupation, by highlighting the shortages and hardships faced by the population.\n\n**Response by Authorities**\n\nThe authorities responded to the black market in a range of ways, including:\n\n### Widespread Black Market (Autumn 1941 to 1943)\n\nBy the autumn of 1941, the black market had become a widespread phenomenon, with traders and smugglers operating in all parts of the country. The authorities responded with a range of measures, including:\n\n#### Agricultural Black Market\n\nThe agricultural black market emerged as a major force, with farmers and traders selling goods such as wheat, milk, and meat outside of the official market.\n\n#### Grey Market: Direct Sales\n\nThe grey market continued to grow, with traders selling goods directly to consumers outside of the official market.\n\n#### Commerce and Industry\n\nThe black market also affected commerce and industry, with businesses and factories operating in secret to supply goods and services to those in need.\n\n#### Tacit Tolerance\n\nBy the spring of 1942, the authorities had begun to adopt a more nuanced approach to the black market, with some officials and police officers turning a blind eye to small-scale trading and smuggling.\n\n### No Longer Immoral\n\nAs the war progressed, the black market became increasingly accepted as a necessary evil, with many people viewing it as a way to access goods and services that were unavailable through official channels.\n\n### Nuanced and Refocused Enforcement\n\nThe authorities began to focus on large-scale smuggling and hoarding, rather than small-scale trading and speculation, in an attempt to stem the flow of goods out of the official market.\n\n## Metrics\n\nThe black market had a significant impact on the French economy, with:\n\n#### Proportion of Production\n\nEstimates suggest that the black market accounted for up to 30% of the country's total production, with goods such as food, clothing, and fuel being in high demand.\n\n#### Higher and More Volatile Prices\n\nPrices on the black market were often higher and more volatile than those on the official market, making it difficult for consumers to predict and afford the goods they needed.\n\n#### Geographic Distribution\n\nThe black market was widespread, with traders and smugglers operating in all parts of the country. However, some regions were more affected than others, with the north and east of France being particularly hard hit.\n\n#### Beneficiaries\n\nThe beneficiaries of the black market were diverse, including:\n\n* The privileged French, who used their connections and resources to access goods and services that were unavailable to the general population.\n* The occupation forces, who used the black market to supply themselves with goods and services.\n* The traders and smugglers, who profited from the black market and often became wealthy as a result.\n\n**Patriotism (Spring 1943-Summer 1944)**\n\nAs the war turned in favor of the Allies, the black market began to decline, with many traders and smugglers turning their attention to more legitimate pursuits.\n\n### Enforcement for the Occupiers\n\nThe authorities responded to the decline of the black market by increasing enforcement against those who continued to trade and smuggle goods.\n\n#### Economic Pillage and the End of the German Black Market\n\nAs the Allies advanced, the German black market began to decline, with many traders and smugglers fleeing or being arrested.\n\n#### Countermeasures and Collaboration\n\nThe Vichy government and some elements of the French population began to collaborate with the Allies, providing intelligence and assistance in the pursuit of those who continued to trade and smuggle goods.\n\n#### Milice vs the Black Market\n\nThe Milice, a paramilitary organization loyal to the Vichy government, began to crack down on the black market, arresting and executing those who continued to trade and smuggle goods.\n\n## Fraud and Resistance\n\nSome elements of the French Resistance continued to use the black market as a way to undermine the Vichy government and the German occupation.\n\n### Resistance Encouragement\n\nThe black market was seen by some as a way to encourage resistance and undermine the occupation, with traders and smugglers often providing support and resources to the Resistance.\n\n### Blaming the Resistance\n\nHowever, others saw the black market as a threat to the war effort, blaming the Resistance for hoarding and speculation.\n\n### End of the Occupation\n\nAs the Allies advanced, the black market began to decline, with many traders and smugglers turning their attention to more legitimate pursuits.\n\n**After the Liberation (1944-1949)**\n\nThe aftermath of the Liberation saw a range of measures to address the legacy of the black market.\n\n### Ãpuration and Illicit Profits\n\nThe authorities launched a series of investigations and prosecutions to identify and punish those who had profited from the black market.\n\n#### Pursuit and Punishment\n\nThose who had profited from the black market were pursued and punished, with many being arrested, tried, and executed.\n\n#### Confiscation of Illicit Profits\n\nThe authorities also sought to confiscate the illicit profits made from the black market, using the proceeds to fund welfare programs and other social services.\n\n## Continued Black Market Operations\n\nDespite the efforts to address the legacy of the black market, it continued to exist in some form, with many traders and smugglers adapting to the new circumstances.\n\n### Continued Trafficking\n\nThe black market continued to operate, with traders and smugglers adapting to the new circumstances and finding new ways to evade the authorities.\n\n### Generalized Fraud\n\nThe black market also contributed to a culture of generalized fraud, with many people seeking to exploit the system for personal gain.\n\n### Government Powerlessness\n\nThe government was often powerless to stop the black market, with many officials and police officers being corrupt or complicit.\n\n### Towards the Free Market\n\nAs the French economy began to recover, the black market began to decline, with many traders and smugglers turning their attention to more legitimate

Rowling. It is the third installment in the Fantastic Beasts film series, a spin-off of the Wizarding World created by Rowling.\n\nThe film follows the story of Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law) as he naviges a complex web of alliances and rivalries in the wizarding world, while also facing a personal challenge in the form of his own past. The story is set in the 1930s, a decade before the events of the main Harry Potter series.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe plot of Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore revolves around the story of Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law) as he tries to prevent a catastrophic war between the wizarding world and the non-magical community. The film takes place in the 1930s, a decade before the events of the main Harry Potter series.\n\nThe story begins with Dumbledore's return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he is tasked with mentoring a young Gellert Grindelwald (Mads Mikkelsen), a charismatic and powerful wizard who is slowly descending into darkness. Meanwhile, Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) and his friends, including Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston), Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler), and Queenie Goldstein (Alison Sudol), are dealing with their own personal struggles and conflicts.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Dumbledore's past comes back to haunt him in the form of Grindelwald, who is revealed to be his former lover and friend. The two men had a tumultuous relationship, with Grindelwald eventually becoming obsessed with power and control. Dumbledore, on the other hand, is determined to stop Grindelwald's rise to power and prevent a catastrophic war.\n\nThroughout the film, the characters face numerous challenges and obstacles, including encounters with magical creatures, treacherous wizards, and personal demons. The story is full of twists and turns, keeping the audience engaged and invested in the characters' journeys.\n\n# Cast\n\nThe cast of Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore includes:\n\n* Jude Law as Albus Dumbledore\n* Mads Mikkelsen as Gellert Grindelwald\n* Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scamander\n* Katherine Waterston as Tina Goldstein\n* Dan Fogler as Jacob Kowalski\n* Alison Sudol as Queenie Goldstein\n* Callum Turner as Theseus Scamander\n* Victoria Yeates as Bunty Babbling\n* William Nadylam as Youssef Kama\n* Poppy Corby-Tuech as Vinda Rosier\n* Jessica Williams as Eunice Everett\n\nThe cast brings the characters to life with their performances, delivering complex and nuanced portrayals that add depth and richness to the story.\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\nThe development of Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore began in 2016, shortly after the release of the first film in the series, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series, had been working on a screenplay for the film, which would take place in the 1930s, a decade before the events of the main series.\n\nDavid Yates, who had directed the first two films in the series, was set to return to direct the third installment. The screenplay would be written by J.K.

She was the leader of the Conservative Party from September 2022 to October 2022. Truss was the Member of Parliament (MP) for South West Norfolk from 2010 to present.\n\nEarly life and education (1975â1996)\n\nElizabeth Kate Truss was born on July 26, 1975, in Oxford, England. Her father, John Truss, was a professor of mathematics at the University of Leeds. Truss was educated at the independent Sevenoaks School in Kent, followed by the University of Oxford, where she studied philosophy, politics, and economics (PPE) at Merton College. She graduated with a first-class honors degree in 1996.\n\nCareer\n\nEmployment and candidatures (1996â2010)\n\nAfter graduating, Truss worked as an economist in the Bank of England's foreign exchange division and as a lecturer at the Department of Economics at the University of Manchester. In 1999, she joined the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) as an economic advisor. Truss stood as the Conservative candidate in the 2001 general election in the Hertford and Stortford constituency, but lost to the incumbent Labour MP, Mark Prisk. She later stood as the candidate for the Truro and St Austell constituency in the 2005 general election, but lost to the Liberal Democrat MP, Matthew Taylor.\n\nBackbencher (2010â2012)\n\nTruss was first elected as the Member of Parliament for South West Norfolk in the 2010 general election, defeating the incumbent Liberal Democrat MP, Chris Leslie. She was appointed as the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Childcare in the Education Department in 2012.\n\nEducation under-secretary (2012â2014)\n\nIn 2012, Truss was appointed as the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Childcare in the Education Department. She was responsible for the school curriculum, special educational needs, and children's commissioner.\n\nEnvironment secretary (2014â2016)\n\nTruss was promoted to the position of Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in 2014. She was responsible for policies related to the environment, food, and rural affairs.\n\nJustice secretary and lord chancellor (2016â2017)\n\nTruss was appointed as the Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor in 2016. She was responsible for the administration of justice, the courts, and the prison system.\n\nChief secretary to the Treasury (2017â2019)\n\nTruss was appointed as the Chief Secretary to the Treasury in 2017, a position that made her the second-most senior minister in the Treasury. She was responsible for the government's spending plans and the fiscal policy.\n\nInternational trade secretary (2019â2021)\n\nTruss was appointed as the Secretary of State for International Trade in 2019. She was responsible for negotiating the UK's post-Brexit trade agreements with other countries.\n\nForeign secretary (2021â2022)\n\nTruss was appointed as the Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs in 2021. She was responsible for the UK's foreign policy and international relations.\n\nLeadership election (JulyâSeptember 2022)\n\nIn July 2022, Truss announced her candidacy for the Conservative Party leadership election. She was a frontrunner in the early stages of the contest, but her campaign was marked by controversy, particularly over her tax policies and her opposition to the European Union's foreign policy. Truss won the leadership election in September 2022, securing 57.4% of the vote in the final round.\n\nPremiership (2022)\n\nCabinet and death of Elizabeth II\n\nTruss was appointed as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on September 6, 2022, following the Conservative Party leadership election. She appointed a cabinet that included several of her former colleagues, including Kwasi Kwarteng as Chancellor of the Exchequer and Suella Braverman as Home Secretary. Truss's premiership was marked by controversy, particularly over her response to the death of Queen Elizabeth II. The Queen passed away on September 8, 2022, and Truss was criticized for not declaring a national day of mourning.\n\nDomestic policies and mini-budget\n\nTruss's government was marked by a series of policy announcements, including a mini-budget that was announced in September 2022. The budget included significant tax cuts, including a reduction in the top rate of income tax from 45% to 40%. The budget was widely criticized by economists and opposition politicians, who argued that it would exacerbate the UK's fiscal deficit and increase inequality.\n\nGovernment crisis and resignation\n\nTruss's premiership was marked by a series of crises, including a government crisis over her tax policies and her response to the energy crisis. Truss's government was criticized for its handling of the crisis, and several of her cabinet members resigned. On October 20, 2022, Truss announced that she would resign as Prime Minister, following a series of losses in by-elections and a confidence vote in the Conservative Party.\n\nPost-premiership (2022âpresent)\n\nTruss has continued to be a prominent figure in British politics since her resignation as Prime Minister. She has been a vocal critic of her successor, Rishi Sunak, and has spoken out on a range of issues, including Brexit and the economy.\n\nPolitical positions\n\nDomestic issues\n\nTruss has taken a number of positions on domestic issues, including education, the economy, and healthcare. She has been a strong advocate for free market policies and has argued that the government should reduce its spending and cut taxes. Truss has also been a critic of the National Health Service (NHS) and has argued that it should be reformed to make it more efficient.\n\nForeign policy\n\nTruss has taken a number of positions on foreign policy issues, including Brexit, the European Union, and the Middle East. She has been a strong supporter of the UK's withdrawal from the EU and has argued that the UK should have greater control over its borders and laws. Truss has also been a critic of the EU's foreign policy and has argued that the EU should be more supportive of the UK's interests.\n\nNotes and references\n\nSources\n\nBooks and journals\n\nNews\n\nWebsites and others\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Liz_Truss\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education (1975â1996)\n#Career\n##Employment and candidatures (1996â2010)\n##Backbencher (2010â2012)\n##Education under-secretary (2012â2014)\n##Environment secretary (2014â2016)\n##Justice secretary and lord chancellor (2016â2017)\n##Chief secretary to the Treasury (2017â2019)\n##International trade secretary (2019â2021)\n##Foreign secretary (2021â2022)\n###Leadership election (JulyâSeptember 2022)\n#Premiership (2022)\n##Cabinet and death of Elizabeth II\n##Domestic policies and mini-budget\n##Government crisis and resignation\n#Post-premiership (2022âpresent)\n#Political positions\n##Domestic issues\n##Foreign policy\n#Notes and references\n#Sources\n##Books and journals\n##News\n##Websites and others\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The teams played each other in a round-robin format, with the top two teams advancing to the knockout stage.\n\n**#Teams**\n\nGroup B consisted of four teams:\n\n*  England, who were making their 16th World Cup appearance\n*  Iran, who were making their sixth World Cup appearance\n*  United States, who were making their 11th World Cup appearance\n*  Wales, who were making their third World Cup appearance\n\n**#LGBT symbol incidents**\n\nDuring the group stage, several incidents involving the display of LGBT symbols took place. \n\n##**Captains' armbands**\n\nOn November 21, 2022, the captains of the England, Wales, and United States teams, Harry Kane, Gareth Bale, and Miles Robinson, respectively, wore armbands with LGBT symbols as a statement of support for the LGBT community. The armbands were intended to be a symbol of solidarity and to raise awareness about the persecution of LGBT individuals in Iran. However, FIFA threatened to impose sanctions on the teams if they continued to wear the armbands, citing the fact that they were not authorized by the governing body. In response, the teams decided to remove the armbands from their sleeves.\n\n##**Other Pride items**\n\nIn addition to the captains' armbands, several other players and officials wore Pride items, including rainbow-colored shoelaces, badges, and wristbands, as a show of support for the LGBT community. While these items were not explicitly banned by FIFA, they were not officially approved either.\n\n**#Standings**\n\nThe standings in Group B were as follows:\n\n*  England (7 points)\n*  United States (5 points)\n*  Iran (3 points)\n*  Wales (1 point)\n\n**#Matches**\n\nThe matches played in Group B were as follows:\n\n##**England vs Iran**\n\nThe first match of Group B was played on November 21, 2022, between England and Iran at the Khalifa International Stadium in Al Rayyan, Qatar.

Iran won the match 2-0.\n\n##**England vs United States**\n\nThe fourth match of Group B was played on November 25, 2022, between England and the United States at the Al Bayt Stadium in Al Khor, Qatar.
