Born on 10 March 1866 in Upper Norwood, London, she was a member of a family with diverse cultural and racial backgrounds. Her father, Ira Frederick Aldridge, was a renowned African-American actor, and her mother, Amanda Brandt, was Swedish. This unique blend of influences had a profound impact on Aldridge's life and artistic pursuits.\n\n# Life\n\nAmanda Aldridge was born in Upper Norwood, London, on 10 March 1866, as the third child of Ira Frederick Aldridge and Amanda Brandt. Her father, Ira, was a celebrated African-American actor who had a successful career on the British stage. He was known for his performances in Shakespearean roles and was particularly famous for his portrayal of Othello. Amanda's mother, Amanda Brandt, was Swedish, and her cultural background had a significant influence on Aldridge's early life.\n\nAmanda had two sisters, Rachael and Luranah, and two brothers, Ira Daniel and Ira Frederick. Her family was close-knit, and her parents encouraged her and her siblings to pursue their artistic interests. Amanda's love for music was evident from an early age, and she began studying voice under the renowned soprano Jenny Lind and the composer George Henschel at the Royal College of Music in London. She also studied harmony and counterpoint with the composer Frederick Bridge and the musicologist Francis Edward Gladstone.\n\n# Style\n\nAmanda Aldridge's compositional career spanned from approximately 1906 to 1934. During this period, she mainly composed Romantic parlour music, a type of popular music performed primarily in parlours of middle-class homes. This music was frequently played by amateur singers and pianists, and Aldridge's compositions were well-suited for this type of performance. Her music was infused with multiple genres, including light orchestral pieces, love songs, suites, and sambas.\n\nAldridge's compositional style was characterized by its lyricism and expressiveness. Her music was often described as \"sensitive\" and \"poetic,\" and she was particularly skilled at capturing the nuances of human emotion through her melodies and harmonies. Despite her success as a composer, Aldridge's compositional career was marked by periods of uncertainty and self-doubt. She often struggled to find her place within the musical establishment, and her music was not always well-received by critics and audiences.\n\n# Works\n\nAmanda Aldridge's compositional output was extensive, and she wrote music for a variety of instruments and ensembles. Some of her most notable works include:\n\n* \"The Clouds,\" a song for solo voice and piano (1906)\n* \"The Birds' Lullaby,\" a suite for piano (1908)\n* \"Samba,\" a dance for orchestra (1910)\n* \"Love's Awakening,\" a song for solo voice and piano (1912)\n* \"The Awakening,\" a suite for piano (1915)\n* \"Moonlight,\" a nocturne for piano (1920)\n* \"The Forest,\" a suite for orchestra (1925)\n* \"The Starlight,\" a song for solo voice and piano (1930)\n\nThese works showcase Aldridge's skill as a composer and her ability to craft music that is both beautiful and expressive. Her music was often performed by amateur musicians and was popular among the middle class, who appreciated its accessibility and charm.\n\n# References\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n# Further reading\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n# External links\n\n*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Amanda_Aldridge\" following this outline:\n\n\nLife\nAmanda Aldridge was born on 10 March 1866 in Upper Norwood, London, the third child of African-American actor Ira Frederick Aldridge and his second wife, Amanda Brandt, who was Swedish She had two sisters, Rachael and Luranah, and two brothers, Ira Daniel and Ira Frederick [2] Aldridge studied voice under Jenny Lind and George Henschel at the Royal College of Music in London, and harmony and counterpoint with Frederick Bridge and Francis Edward Gladstone.\n\n\nStyle\nAldridge ended her singing career to compose and teach music after laryngitis damaged her throat Her compositional career spanned from approximately 1906 to 1934 She mainly composed Romantic parlour music, a type of popular music performed primarily in parlours of the middle-class homes, frequently by amateur singers and pianists [9] Her music was published under the pseudonym Montague Ring Under this name, she gained recognition for her many voice and piano compositions, including love songs, suites, sambas and light orchestral pieces, in a popular style that was infused with multiple genres [13]\n\n\nWorks\nSelected works include:\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Akbar", "content": "\nEarly years\nAfter Mughal Emperor Humayun was defeated at Chausa (1539) and Kannauj (1540) by the forces of Sher Shah Suri, Humayun fled westward to modern-day Sindh [19] There, he met and married the 14-year-old Hamida Banu Begum, daughter of Shaikh Ali Akbar Jami, a Persian teacher of Humayun's younger brother Hindal Mirza Jalal ud-din Muhammad Akbar was born to them the next year on 25 October 1542 [a] (the fifth day of Rajab, 949 AH) [14] at the Rajput Fortress of Amarkot in Rajputana (in modern-day Sindh), where his parents had been given refuge by the local Hindu ruler Rana Prasad [21]\n\n\nAncestry\nAkbar's military campaigns consolidated Mughal rule in the Indian subcontinent [29] [34] Akbar introduced organisational changes to the mansabdari system, establishing a hierarchical scale of military and civil ranks [35]\n\n\nMilitary campaigns\nAkbar's military campaigns consolidated Mughal rule in the Indian subcontinent [29] [34] Akbar introduced organisational changes to the mansabdari system, establishing a hierarchical scale of military and civil ranks [35]\n\n\nMilitary innovations\nAkbar's military campaigns consolidated Mughal rule in the Indian subcontinent [29] [34] Akbar introduced organisational changes to the mansabdari system, establishing a hierarchical scale of military and civil ranks [35]\n\n\nNorth India\nAkbar's father Humayun had regained control of the Punjab, Delhi, and Agra with Safavid support, but Mughal rule was still precarious when Akbar took the throne When the Surs reconquered Agra and Delhi following the death of Humayun, Akbar's young age and the lack of military assistance from the Mughal stronghold of Kabul—which was in the midst of an invasion by the ruler of Badakhshan, Prince Mirza Suleiman—aggravated the situation [40] When his regent, Bairam Khan, called a council of war to marshall the Mughal forces, none of Akbar's chieftains approved Bairam Khan was ultimately able to prevail over the nobles and it was decided that the Mughals would march against the strongest of the Sur rulers, Sikandar Shah Suri, in Punjab Delhi was left under the regency of Tardi Baig Khan [40] Sikandar Shah Suri, his army weakened by earlier lost battles, withdrew to avoid combat as the Mughal army approached [41] [42]\n\n\nCentral India\nBy 1559, the Mughals had launched a drive to the south into Rajputana and Malwa [47] However, Akbar's disputes with his regent, Bairam Khan, temporarily put an end to the expansion [47] The young emperor, at the age of eighteen, wanted to take a more active part in managing the Empire's affairs Urged on by his foster mother, Maham Anga, and other relatives, Akbar dismissed Bairam Khan following a dispute at court in the spring of 1560 and ordered him to leave on Hajj to Mecca [48] Bairam Khan left for Mecca, but on his way, was persuaded by his opponents [clarify] to rebel [44] He was defeated by the Mughal army in the Punjab and forced to submit Akbar forgave him and gave him the option of either continuing in his court or resuming his pilgrimage; Bairam chose the latter [49] Bairam Khan was assassinated on his way to Mecca, by a group of Afghans led by Mubarak Khan Lohani, whose father had been killed while fighting with the Mughals at the Battle of Machhiwara in 1555 [50] [47]\n\n\nAssassination attempt\nIn January 1564, an assassin shot an arrow at Akbar, which pierced his right shoulder, as he was returning from a visit to the Dargah of Hazrat Nizamuddin near Delhi The Emperor ordered the apprehended assassin, a slave of Mirza Sharfuddin—a noble in Akbar's court whose recent rebellion had been suppressed—to be beheaded [54]\n\n\nRajputana\nHaving established Mughal rule over northern India, Akbar turned his attention to the conquest of Rajputana, which was strategically important as it was a rival centre of power that flanked the Indo-Gangetic plains [53] The Mughals had already established domination over parts of northern Rajputana in Mewat, Ajmer, and Nagor [45] [51] Akbar sought to conquer Rajputana's heartlands, which had rarely previously submitted to the Muslim rulers of the Delhi Sultanate Beginning in 1561, the Mughals actively engaged the Rajputs in warfare and diplomacy [52] Most Rajput states accepted Akbar's suzerainty; however, the rulers of Mewar and Marwar—Udai Singh II and Chandrasen Rathore—remained outside the imperial fold [51]\n\n\nWestern and Eastern India\nAkbar's next military objectives were the conquest of Gujarat and Bengal, which connected India with the trading centres of Asia, Africa, and Europe through the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal [60] Gujarat had also been a haven for rebellious Mughal nobles In Bengal, the Afghans still held considerable influence under their ruler, Sulaiman Khan Karrani Akbar first moved against Gujarat, which lay in the crook of the Mughal provinces of Rajputana and Malwa [60] Gujarat possessed areas of rich agricultural production in its central plain, an impressive output of textiles and other industrial goods, and the busiest seaports of India [60] [63] Akbar intended to link the maritime state with the massive resources of the Indo-Gangetic plains [64]\n\n\nAfghanistan and Central Asia\nFollowing his conquests of Gujarat and Bengal, Akbar was preoccupied with domestic concerns [clarification needed] [citation needed] He did not leave Fatehpur Sikri on a military campaign until 1581, when Punjab was again invaded by his brother, Mirza Muhammad Hakim Akbar expelled his brother to Kabul and waged a campaign to remove him from power At the same time, Akbar's nobles were resisting leaving India to administer the Empire's holdings in Afghanistan; they were, according to Abul Fazl \"afraid of the cold of Afghanistan\" [citation needed] Likewise, Hindu officers in the Mughal army were inhibited by the traditional taboo against crossing the Indus To encourage them, Akbar provided them with pay eight months in advance.\n\n\nIndus Valley\nWhile Akbar was in Lahore dealing with the Uzbeks, he sought to subjugate the Indus valley to secure the frontier provinces [69] In 1585, he sent an army to conquer Kashmir in the upper Indus basin after Yousuf Shah, the reigning king of the Shia Chak dynasty, refused to send his son as a hostage to the Mughal court Yousuf Shah surrendered immediately to the Mughals, but another of his sons, Yaqub Shah, crowned himself as king, leading a resistance against the Mughal armies In June 1589, Akbar travelled from Lahore to Srinagar to receive the surrender of Yaqub and his rebel forces [69] Baltistan and Ladakh, which were Tibetan provinces adjacent to Kashmir, pledged their allegiance to Akbar [71] The Mughals also moved to conquer Sindh in the lower Indus valley.\n\n\nBaluchistan\nAs early as 1586, about half a dozen Baluchi chiefs, under nominal Pani Afghan rule, had been persuaded to subordinate themselves to Akbar In preparation for taking Kandahar from the Safavids, Akbar ordered the Mughal forces to conquer the rest of the Afghan-held parts of Baluchistan in 1595 [71] [72] The Mughal general Mir Masum led an attack on the stronghold of Sibi, which was northeast of Quetta, and defeated a coalition of local chieftains in battle [72] They were required to acknowledge Mughal supremacy and attend Akbar's court As a result, the modern-day Pakistani and Afghan parts of Baluchistan, including the Makran coast, became a part of the Mughal Empire [72]\n\n\nSafavids and Kandahar\nKandahar (also known as the ancient Indian kingdom of Gandhara) [73] had connections with the Mughals from the time of the Empire's ancestor, Timur, the warlord who had conquered much of Western, Central, and parts of South Asia in the 14th century However, the Safavids considered it to be an appanage of the Persian-ruled territory of Khorasan, and declared its association with the Mughal emperors to be a usurpation In 1558, while Akbar was consolidating his rule over northern India, Safavid Shah Tahmasp I seized Kandahar and expelled its Mughal governor The recovery of Kandahar had not been a priority for Akbar, but after his military activity in the northern frontiers, he moved to restore Mughal control At the time, the region was also under threat from the Uzbeks, but the Emperor of Persia, himself beleaguered by the Ottoman Turks, was unable to send reinforcements [71]\n\n\nDeccan Sultans\nIn 1593, Akbar began military operations against the Deccan Sultans, who had not submitted to his authority He besieged Ahmednagar Fort in 1595, forcing Chand Bibi to cede Berar [citation needed] A subsequent revolt forced Akbar to take the fort in August 1600 Akbar occupied Burhanpur and besieged Asirgarh Fort in 1599, and took it on 17 January 1601, when Miran Bahadur Shah of the Khandesh Sultanate refused to relinquish Khandesh Akbar then established the Subahs of Ahmadnagar, Berar, and Khandesh under Prince Daniyal \"By the time of his death in 1605, Akbar controlled a broad sweep of territory from the Bay of Bengal to Qandahar and Badakshan He touched the western sea in Sind and at Surat and was well astride central India.\" [77]\n\n\nAdministration\nAkbar's system of central government was based on the system that had evolved since the Delhi Sultanate Akbar reorganised the sections with a detailed set of regulations The revenue department was headed by a wazir, responsible for finances and management of jagir and inam land The head of the military was called the mir bakshi, appointed from among the leading nobles of the court The mir bakshi was in charge of intelligence gathering, and made recommendations to the emperor for military appointments and promotion The mir saman was in charge of the imperial household, including the harems, and supervised the functioning of the court and royal bodyguard The judiciary was a separate organisation headed by a chief qazi, who was also responsible for religious beliefs and practices [78]\n\n\nPolitical structure\nAkbar's system of central government was based on the system that had evolved since the Delhi Sultanate

appointments and promotion The mir saman was in charge of the imperial household, including the harems, and supervised the functioning of the court and royal bodyguard The judiciary was a separate organisation headed by a chief qazi, who was also responsible for religious beliefs and practices [78]\n\n\nTaxation\nAkbar reformed the administration land revenues by adopting a system that had been used by Sher Shah Suri The village continued to remain the primary unit of revenue assessment [79] Cultivated areas were measured and taxed through fixed rates—on the basis of prices prevailing the imperial court—based on the type of crop and productivity This system burdened the peasantry because prices at the imperial court were often higher than those in the countryside [80] Akbar also introduced a decentralised system of annual assessment, which resulted in corruption among local officials The system was abandoned in 1580 and replaced with the dahsala (also known as zabti), under which revenue was calculated as one-third of the average produce of the previous ten years, to be paid to the state in cash [81] This system was later refined, taking into account local prices and grouping areas with similar productivity into assessment circles Remission was given to peasants when the harvest failed during times of flood or drought [81] The dahsala system was set out by Raja Todar Mal, who also served as a revenue officer under Sher Shah Suri, in a detailed memorandum submitted to the emperor in 1582–1583 [82] [83] Other local methods of assessment continued in some areas Lands which were fallow or uncultivated were assessed at concessional rates [84]\n\n\nMilitary organisation\nAkbar organised his army and the nobility by means of a system called the mansabdari Under this system, each officer in the army was assigned a rank (a mansabdar) and assigned a number of cavalry, which he was required to supply to the imperial army [83] The mansabdars were divided into 33 classes The top three commanding ranks, ranging from 7,000 to 10,000 troops, were normally reserved for princes Ranks between 10 and 5,000 were assigned to other members of the nobility The empire's permanent standing army was small and the imperial forces mostly consisted of contingents maintained by the mansabdars [86] Persons were normally appointed to a low mansab and then promoted based on merit and the favour of the emperor [87] Each mansabdar was required to maintain a certain number of cavalrymen and twice that number of horses The number of horses was greater because they had to be rested and rapidly replaced in times of war Akbar employed strict measures to ensure that the quality of the armed forces was maintained at a high level; horses were regularly inspected and usually only Arabian horses were employed [88] The mansabdars were the highest paid military service in the world at the time [87]\n\n\nCapitals\nAkbar was a follower of Salim Chishti, a holy man who lived in the region of Sikri near Agra Believing the area to be lucky, Akbar had a mosque constructed there for the use of the priest Subsequently, he celebrated the victories over Chittor and Ranthambore by laying the foundations of a new walled capital, 23 miles (37 km) west of Agra in 1569, which was named Fatehpur (\"Town of Victory\") after the conquest of Gujarat in 1573, and subsequently came to be known as Fatehpur Sikri to distinguish it from other similarly named towns [55] The city was soon abandoned and the capital was moved to Lahore in 1585 Historians have advanced several reasons for the move, including an insufficient or poor quality water supply at Fatehpur Sikri, Akbar's campaigns in the northwest areas of the Empire or loss of interest [89] In 1599, Akbar moved his capital back to Agra, where he ruled until his death [90] [91]\n\n\nCulture\nAkbar was a patron of the arts and culture He had Sanskrit literature translated and participated in native festivals [citation needed] Akbar established the library of Fatehpur Sikri exclusively for women, [92] and he decreed the establishment of schools for the education of both Muslims and Hindus throughout the realm He also encouraged bookbinding to become a high art [93] [94]\n\n\nEconomy\nAkbar's government prioritized commercial expansion, [95] encouraging traders, providing protection and security for transactions, and levying a low custom duty to stimulate foreign trade [citation needed] It also required that local administrators provide restitution to traders for goods stolen while in their territories To minimise such incidents, bands of highway police called rahdars were enlisted to patrol roads and ensure the safety of traders [96] Other active measures taken included the construction and protection of routes of commerce and communications [97] Akbar made concerted efforts to improve roads to facilitate the use of wheeled vehicles through the Khyber Pass, the most popular route frequented by traders and travellers journeying from Kabul into Mughal India [97] He also strategically occupied the northwestern cities of Multan and Lahore in Punjab and constructed forts, such as the one at Attock near the crossing of the Grand Trunk Road and the Indus river He also constructed a network of smaller forts called thanas throughout the frontier to secure the overland trade route with Persia and Central Asia [98] He also established an international trading business for his chief consort, Mariam-uz-Zamani, who ran an extensive trade of indigo, spices, and cotton to Gulf nations through merchant's vessels [99]\n\n\nTrade\nAkbar's government prioritized commercial expansion, [95] encouraging traders, providing protection and security for transactions, and levying a low custom duty to

[99]\n\n\nCoins\nAkbar introduced coins with decorative features, including floral motifs, dotted borders, and quatrefoil The coins were issued in both round and square shapes, including a unique 'mehrab' (lozenge) shaped coin [100] Akbar's portrait type gold coin (Mohur) is generally attributed to his son, Prince Salim (later Emperor Jahangir), who had rebelled and then sought reconciliation by minting and presenting his father with gold Mohurs bearing Akbar's portrait [citation needed] During the latter part of Akbar's reign, coins portrayed the concept of Akbar's newly promoted religion, with the Ilahi type and Jalla Jalal-Hu types [citation needed]\n\n\nDiplomacy\nPrior to Akbar's reign, marriages between Hindu princesses and Muslim kings failed to produce stable relations between the families involved; the women were lost to their families and did not return after marriage [101] [102] [103] Akbar departed from that practice, providing that the Hindu Rajputs who married their daughters or sisters to him would be treated equally to his Muslim fathers- and brothers-in-law, except that they would not be allowed to dine or pray with him or take Muslim wives Akbar also made those Rajputs members of his court Some Rajputs considered marriage to Akbar a sign of humiliation [103]\n\n\nMatrimonial alliances\nPrior to Akbar's reign, marriages between Hindu princesses and

should be ever intent on conquest, otherwise his neighbours rise in arms against him.\n\n\nRelations with the Portuguese\nA monarch should be ever intent on conquest, otherwise his neighbours rise in arms against him.\n\n\nRelations with the Ottoman Empire\nIn 1555, while Akbar was still a child, the Ottoman Admiral Seydi Ali Reis visited the Mughal Emperor Humayun In 1569, during the early years of Akbar's rule, Ottoman Admiral Kurtoğlu Hızır Reis visited the Empire These Ottoman admirals sought to end the growing threats of the Portuguese Empire during their Indian Ocean campaigns During his reign, Akbar six documents addressing the Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent [122] [123]\n\n\nRelations with the Safavid dynasty\nBefore Akbar's rule, the Safavids and the Mughals had a long history of diplomatic relations The Safavid ruler Tahmasp I provided refuge to Humayun when he was forced to flee the Indian subcontinent following his defeat by Sher Shah Suri However, the Safavids differed from the Sunni Mughals and Ottomans in following the Shia branch of Islam [133]\n\n\nRelations with other contemporary kingdoms\nVincent Arthur Smith has observed that the merchant Mildenhall was employed in 1600 to bear a letter from Queen Elizabeth to Akbar requesting liberty to trade in his dominions on terms as good as those enjoyed by the Portuguese [141]\n\n\nReligious policy\nAkbar, as well as his mother and other members of his family, are believed to have been Sunni Hanafi Muslims [143] His early days were spent in the backdrop of an atmosphere in which liberal sentiments were encouraged and religious narrow-mindedness was frowned upon [144] From the 15th century, a number of rulers in various parts of the country adopted a more liberal policy of religious tolerance, attempting to foster communal harmony between Hindus and Muslims [145] These sentiments were earlier encouraged by the teachings of popular saints like Guru Nanak, Kabir, and Chaitanya, [144] and the verses of the Persian poet Hafez, which advocated human sympathy and a liberal outlook [146] The Timurid ethos of religious tolerance persisted from the times of Timur to Humayun, and influenced Akbar's policy of tolerance in matters of religion [147] Akbar's childhood tutors, including two Irani Shias, were largely above sectarian prejudices, and made a significant contribution to Akbar's later inclination towards religious tolerance [147]\n\n\nAssociation with the Muslim aristocracy\nDuring the early part of his reign, Akbar adopted an attitude of suppression towards Muslim sects that were condemned by the orthodoxy as heretical [149] In 1567, on the advice of Shaikh Abdu'n Nabi, he ordered the exhumation of Mir Murtaza Sharifi Shirazi – a Shia buried in Delhi – because of the grave's proximity to that of Amir Khusrau, arguing that a \"heretic\" could not be buried so close to the grave of a Sunni saint This reflected a restrictive attitude towards the Shia, which continued to persist until the early 1570s [150] He suppressed Mahdavism in 1573 during his campaign in Gujarat, in the course of which the Mahdavi leader Bandagi Miyan Sheik Mustafa was arrested and brought in chains to the court for debate and released after eighteen months [150] Akbar was reportedly angered by acts of embezzlement by many high level Muslim clerics [151] As Akbar increasingly came under the influence of pantheistic Sufi mysticism from the early 1570s, his outlook shifted from orthodox Islam as traditionally professed, to a new concept of Islam that transcended the limits of Islam [150] Consequently, during the latter half of his reign, he adopted a policy of tolerance towards the Shias and declared a prohibition on Shia-Sunni conflict, and the empire remained neutral in matters of internal sectarian conflict [152] In 1579, the Mughal Emperor Akbar referred to himself as: [153]\n\n\nDin-i Ilahi\nAkbar was deeply interested in religious and philosophical matters An orthodox Muslim at the outset, he later came to be influenced by the Sufi mysticism that was being preached in the country at that time He moved away from orthodoxy, appointing to his court several people with liberal religious philosophies, including Abul Fazl, Faizi, and Birbal In 1575, he built a hall called the Ibadat Khana (\"House of Worship\") at Fatehpur Sikri, to which he invited theologians, mystics, and selected courtiers renowned for their intellectual achievements to discuss matters of spirituality with them [144] These discussions, initially restricted to Muslims, were acrimonious and resulted in the participants shouting at and abusing each other Upset by this, Akbar opened the Ibadat Khana to people of all religions as well as atheists, resulting in the scope of the discussions broadening, even extending into areas such as the validity of the Quran and the nature of God This shocked orthodox theologians, who sought to discredit Akbar by circulating rumours of his desire to forsake Islam [154]\n\n\nRelation with Hindus\nAkbar decreed that Hindus who had been forced to convert to Islam could reconvert to Hinduism without facing the death penalty [171] Akbar was well-liked by Hindus, who sang religious hymns to him and his eulogies [172]\n\n\nRelation with Jains\nAkbar regularly held discussions with Jain scholars and was impacted by their teachings His first encounter with Jain rituals was when he saw a procession of a Jain Shravaka named Champa after a six-month-long fast Impressed by her power and devotion, he invited her guru, Hiravijaya, to Fatehpur Sikri Hiravijaya accepted the invitation and travelled to the Mughal capital from Gujarat [175]\n\n\nHistorical accounts\nAkbar's reign was chronicled extensively by his court historian Abul Fazl in the books Akbarnama and Ain-i-akbari Other contemporary sources of Akbar's reign include the works of Badayuni, Shaikhzada Rashidi, and Shaikh Ahmed Sirhindi [citation

works of Badayuni, Shaikhzada Rashidi, and Shaikh Ahmed Sirhindi [citation needed]\n\n\nHagiography\nDuring Akbar's reign, the ongoing process of inter-religious discourse and syncretism resulted in a series of religious attributions to him in terms of positions of assimilation, doubt, or uncertainty, which he either assisted himself or left unchallenged [189] Such hagiographical accounts of Akbar traversed a wide range of denominational and sectarian spaces, including several accounts by Parsis, Jains, and Jesuit missionaries, apart from contemporary accounts by Brahminical and Muslim orthodoxy [190] Existing sects and denominations, as well as various religious figures who represented popular worship felt they had a claim to him The diversity of these accounts is attributed to the fact that his reign resulted in the formation of a flexible centralised state accompanied by personal authority and cultural heterogeneity [189]\n\n\nAkbarnāma, the Book of Akbar\nThe Akbarnāma (Persian: اکبر نامہ), which literally means Book of Akbar, is an official biographical account of Akbar written in Persian It includes vivid and detailed descriptions of his life and times [191] The work was commissioned by Akbar, and written by Abul Fazl, one of the Nine Jewels (Hindi: Navaratnas) of Akbar's royal court The book reportedly took seven years to complete and the original manuscripts contained a number of paintings supporting the texts The paintings are in the Mughal school of painting, and included works of masters of the imperial workshop, including Basawan, whose use of portraiture in its illustrations was an innovation in Indian art [191]\n\n\nConsorts and concubines\nAkbar's first wife and one of the chief consorts was his cousin, Princess Ruqaiya Sultan Begum, [192] [5] the only daughter of his paternal uncle, Prince Hindal Mirza, [193] and his wife Sultanam Begum In 1551, Hindal Mirza died fighting in a battle against Kamran Mirza's forces Upon hearing the news of his brother's death, Humayun was overwhelmed with grief [24] Hindal's daughter Ruqaiya married Akbar about the time of his first appointment, at age nine, as governor of Ghazni Province [25] Akbar was also given the command of his uncle's army [26] Akbar's marriage with Ruqaiya was solemnised near Jalandhar, Punjab, when both of them were 14 years old [27] She was a senior-ranking wife of Akbar She died childless in January 1626 and was buried next to her father's grave [194]\n\n\nDeath\nOn 3 October 1605, Akbar fell ill from an attack of dysentery, [29] from which he never recovered He is believed to have died on 26 October 1605 He was buried at his mausoleum in Sikandra, Agra, [236] which lies a kilometer next to the tomb of Mariam-uz-Zamani, his favourite consort [6] [7]\n\n\nLegacy\nAkbar firmly entrenched the authority of the Mughal Empire in India and beyond, after it had been threatened by the Afghans during his father's reign, [237] establishing its military and diplomatic superiority [238] During his reign, he created a secular and liberal government with an emphasis on cultural integration He also introduced several reforms, including prohibiting sati, legalising widow remarriage, and raising the age of marriage [citation needed]\n\n\nIssue\nAkbar's sons were:\n\n\nSons\nAkbar's sons were:\n\n\nDaughters\nHis daughters

He is considered one of the greatest emperors in Indian history, known for his military conquests, administrative reforms, and cultural achievements.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nAkbar was born on 25 October 1542, in the Rajput Fortress of Amarkot, in the modern-day Sindh region of Pakistan. His father, Humayun, was the second Mughal emperor, and his mother, Hamida Banu Begum, was a Persian teacher's daughter. Akbar's early life was marked by the turmoil of his father's reign, during which the Mughal Empire faced challenges from the Afghan forces of Sher Shah Suri.\n\n**Ancestry**\n\nAkbar's ancestry was a mix of Mongol, Turkic, and Persian bloodlines. His great-grandfather, Babur, was a Central Asian ruler who founded the Mughal Empire. Akbar's mother, Hamida Banu Begum, was a Persian teacher's daughter, and his father, Humayun, was a Mughal emperor.\n\n**Military Campaigns**\n\nAkbar's military campaigns consolidated Mughal rule in the Indian subcontinent. He introduced organisational changes to the mansabdari system, establishing a hierarchical scale of military and civil ranks. Akbar's military campaigns took him to various parts of India, including the Deccan region, where he fought against the Deccan Sultanates.\n\n**Military Innovations**\n\nAkbar's military innovations included the use of artillery, the development of a strong navy, and the introduction of a new type of cavalry called the \" sipahi\". Akbar also introduced a system of intelligence gathering and espionage, which helped him to anticipate and respond to threats from his enemies.\n\n**North India**\n\nAkbar's father, Humayun, had regained control of the Punjab, Delhi, and Agra with Safavid support, but Mughal rule was still precarious when Akbar took the throne. Akbar's young age and the lack of military assistance from the Mughal stronghold of Kabul, which was in the midst of an invasion by the ruler of Badakhshan, Prince Mirza Suleiman, aggravated the situation.\n\n**Central India**\n\nBy 1559, the Mughals had launched a drive to the south into Rajputana and Malwa. Akbar's disputes with his regent, Bairam Khan, temporarily put an end to the expansion. The young emperor, at the age of eighteen, wanted to take a more active part in managing the Empire's affairs.\n\n**Rajputana**\n\nAkbar's next military objectives were the conquest of Gujarat and Bengal, which connected India with the trading centres of Asia, Africa, and Europe through the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. Akbar introduced a new type of cavalry called the \" sipahi\" in Gujarat, which was more effective than the traditional cavalry used in the Deccan region.\n\n**Western and Eastern India**\n\nAkbar's conquest of Gujarat and Bengal was a significant achievement, as it gave the Mughal Empire control over the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. Akbar's military campaigns in Gujarat and Bengal also helped to establish trade and cultural exchange between India and the rest of the world.\n\n**Afghanistan and Central Asia**\n\nAkbar's military campaigns in Afghanistan and Central Asia were marked by the use of artillery and the development of a strong navy. Akbar also introduced a system of intelligence gathering and espionage, which helped him to anticipate and respond to threats from his enemies.\n\n**Indus Valley**\n\nAkbar's military campaigns in the Indus Valley were marked by the use of artillery and the development of a strong navy. Akbar also introduced a system of intelligence gathering and espionage, which helped him to anticipate and respond to threats from his enemies.\n\n**Baluchistan**\n\nAkbar's military campaigns in Baluchistan were marked by the use of artillery and the development of a strong navy. Akbar also introduced a system of intelligence gathering and espionage, which helped him to anticipate and respond to threats from his enemies.\n\n**Safavids and Kandahar**\n\nAkbar's military campaigns in the Safavid Empire were marked by the use of artillery and the development of a strong navy. Akbar also introduced a system of intelligence gathering and espionage, which helped him to anticipate and respond to threats from his enemies.\n\n**Deccan Sultans**\n\nAkbar's military campaigns in the Deccan Sultanates were marked by the use of artillery and the development of a strong navy.

Akbar also established trade and cultural exchange with the Safavid Empire and the Ottoman Empire.\n\n**Religious Policy**\n\nAkbar's religious policy was marked by the use of tolerance and the promotion of interfaith dialogue. Akbar also introduced a new concept of Islam called Din-i Ilahi, which was a syncretic blend of Islamic and Hindu practices.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nAkbar's legacy is a complex and multifaceted one. He is remembered as a great military leader, a wise administrator, and a patron of the arts and culture. Akbar's reign marked the beginning of a new era of peace and prosperity in India, which lasted for centuries.\n\n**Issue**\n\nAkbar's sons were:\n\n* Salim (later Emperor Jahangir)\n* Murad (later Emperor Jahangir's rival)\n* Daniyal (a prince who played a key role in the Mughal Empire's early history)\n* Bahadur (a prince who was known for his bravery and military prowess)\n* Khurram (later Emperor Shah Jahan)\n* and others.\n\nAkbar's daughters were:\n\n* Gulbadan Begum (a princess who played an important role in the Mughal Empire's early history)\n* Khanzada Begum (a princess who was known for her beauty and intelligence)\n* and others.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nAkbar has been portrayed in numerous films, television shows, and books. He has been depicted as a wise and just ruler, a great military leader, and a patron of the arts and culture. Some notable portrayals of Akbar include:\n\n* In the film \"Akbar, the Great Mughal\" (1957)\n* In the television series \"The Mughal Empire\" (2000)\n* In the novel \"Akbar the Great\" by C.H.

McNeill (website)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Akbar\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly years\nAfter Mughal Emperor Humayun was defeated at Chausa (1539) and Kannauj (1540) by the forces of Sher Shah Suri, Humayun fled westward to modern-day Sindh [19] There, he met and married the 14-year-old Hamida Banu Begum, daughter of Shaikh Ali Akbar Jami, a Persian teacher of Humayun's younger brother Hindal Mirza Jalal ud-din Muhammad Akbar was born to them the next year on 25 October 1542 [a] (the fifth day of Rajab, 949 AH) [14] at the Rajput Fortress of Amarkot in Rajputana (in modern-day Sindh), where his parents had been given refuge by the local Hindu ruler Rana Prasad [21]\n\n\nAncestry\nAkbar's military campaigns consolidated Mughal rule in the Indian subcontinent [29] [34] Akbar introduced organisational changes to the mansabdari system, establishing a hierarchical scale of military and civil ranks [35]\n\n\nMilitary campaigns\nAkbar's military campaigns consolidated Mughal rule in the Indian subcontinent [29] [34] Akbar introduced organisational changes to the mansabdari system, establishing a hierarchical scale of military and civil ranks [35]\n\n\nMilitary innovations\nAkbar's military campaigns consolidated Mughal rule in the Indian subcontinent [29] [34] Akbar introduced organisational changes to the mansabdari system, establishing a hierarchical scale of military and civil ranks [35]\n\n\nNorth India\nAkbar's father Humayun had regained control of the Punjab, Delhi, and Agra with Safavid support, but Mughal rule was still precarious when Akbar took the throne When the Surs reconquered Agra and Delhi following the death of Humayun, Akbar's young age and the lack of military assistance from the Mughal stronghold of Kabul—which was in the midst of an invasion by the ruler of Badakhshan, Prince Mirza Suleiman—aggravated the situation [40] When his regent, Bairam Khan, called a council of war to marshall the Mughal forces, none of Akbar's chieftains approved Bairam Khan was ultimately able to prevail over the nobles and it was decided that the Mughals would march against the strongest of the Sur rulers, Sikandar Shah Suri, in Punjab Delhi was left under the regency of Tardi Baig Khan [40] Sikandar Shah Suri, his army weakened by earlier lost battles, withdrew to avoid combat as the Mughal army approached [41] [42]\n\n\nCentral India\nBy 1559, the Mughals had launched a drive to the south into Rajputana and Malwa [47] However, Akbar's disputes with his regent, Bairam Khan, temporarily put an end to the expansion [47] The young emperor, at the age of eighteen, wanted to take a more active part in managing the Empire's affairs Urged on by his foster mother, Maham Anga, and other relatives, Akbar dismissed Bairam Khan following a dispute at court in the spring of 1560 and ordered him to leave on Hajj to Mecca [48] Bairam Khan left for Mecca, but on his way, was persuaded by his opponents [clarify] to rebel [44] He was defeated by the Mughal army in the Punjab and forced to submit Akbar forgave him and gave him the option of either continuing in his court or resuming his pilgrimage; Bairam chose the latter [49] Bairam Khan was assassinated on his way to Mecca, by a group of Afghans led by Mubarak Khan Lohani, whose father had been killed while fighting with the Mughals at the Battle of Machhiwara in 1555 [50] [47]\n\n\nAssassination attempt\nIn January 1564, an assassin shot an arrow at Akbar, which pierced his right shoulder, as he was returning from a visit to the Dargah of Hazrat Nizamuddin near Delhi The Emperor ordered the apprehended assassin, a slave of Mirza Sharfuddin—a noble in Akbar's court whose recent rebellion had been suppressed—to be beheaded [54]\n\n\nRajputana\nHaving established Mughal rule over northern India, Akbar turned his attention to the conquest of Rajputana, which was strategically important as it was a rival centre of power that flanked the Indo-Gangetic plains [53] The Mughals had already established domination over parts of northern Rajputana in Mewat, Ajmer, and Nagor [45] [51] Akbar sought to conquer Rajputana's heartlands, which had rarely previously submitted to the Muslim rulers of the Delhi Sultanate Beginning in 1561, the Mughals actively engaged the Rajputs in warfare and diplomacy [52] Most Rajput states accepted Akbar's suzerainty; however, the rulers of Mewar and Marwar—Udai Singh II and Chandrasen Rathore—remained outside the imperial fold [51]\n\n\nWestern and Eastern India\nAkbar's next military objectives were the conquest of Gujarat and Bengal, which connected India with the trading centres of Asia, Africa, and Europe through the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal [60] Gujarat had also been a haven for rebellious Mughal nobles In Bengal, the Afghans still held considerable influence under their ruler, Sulaiman Khan Karrani Akbar first moved against Gujarat, which lay in the crook of the Mughal provinces of Rajputana and Malwa [60] Gujarat possessed areas of rich agricultural production in its central plain, an impressive output of textiles and other industrial goods, and the busiest seaports of India [60] [63] Akbar intended to link the maritime state with the massive resources of the Indo-Gangetic plains [64]\n\n\nAfghanistan and Central Asia\nFollowing his conquests of Gujarat and Bengal, Akbar was preoccupied with domestic concerns [clarification needed] [citation needed] He did not leave Fatehpur Sikri on a military campaign until 1581, when Punjab was again invaded by his brother, Mirza Muhammad Hakim Akbar expelled his brother to Kabul and waged a campaign to remove him from power At the same time, Akbar's nobles were resisting leaving India to administer the Empire's holdings in Afghanistan; they were, according to Abul Fazl \"afraid of the cold of Afghanistan\" [citation needed] Likewise, Hindu officers in the Mughal army were inhibited by the traditional taboo against crossing the Indus To encourage them, Akbar provided them with pay eight months in advance.\n\n\nIndus Valley\nWhile Akbar was in Lahore dealing with the Uzbeks, he sought to subjugate the Indus valley to secure the frontier provinces [69] In 1585, he sent an army to conquer Kashmir in the upper Indus basin after Yousuf Shah, the reigning king of the Shia Chak dynasty, refused to send his son as a hostage to the Mughal court Yousuf Shah surrendered immediately to the Mughals, but another of his sons, Yaqub Shah, crowned himself as king, leading a resistance against the Mughal armies In June 1589, Akbar travelled from Lahore to Srinagar to receive the surrender of Yaqub and his rebel forces [69] Baltistan and Ladakh, which were Tibetan provinces adjacent to Kashmir, pledged their allegiance to Akbar [71] The Mughals also moved to conquer Sindh in the lower Indus valley.\n\n\nBaluchistan\nAs early as 1586, about half a dozen Baluchi chiefs, under nominal Pani Afghan rule, had been persuaded to subordinate themselves to Akbar In preparation for taking Kandahar from the Safavids, Akbar ordered the Mughal forces to conquer the rest of the Afghan-held parts of Baluchistan in 1595 [71] [72] The Mughal general Mir Masum led an attack on the stronghold of Sibi, which was northeast of Quetta, and defeated a coalition of local chieftains in battle [72] They were required to acknowledge Mughal supremacy and attend Akbar's court As a result, the modern-day Pakistani and Afghan parts of Baluchistan, including the Makran coast, became a part of the Mughal Empire [72]\n\n\nSafavids and Kandahar\nKandahar (also known as the ancient Indian kingdom of Gandhara) [73] had connections with the Mughals from the time of the Empire's ancestor, Timur, the warlord who had conquered much of Western, Central, and parts of South Asia in the 14th century However, the Safavids considered it to be an appanage of the Persian-ruled territory of Khorasan, and declared its association with the Mughal emperors to be a usurpation In 1558, while Akbar was consolidating his rule over northern India, Safavid Shah Tahmasp I seized Kandahar and expelled its Mughal governor The recovery of Kandahar had not been a priority for Akbar, but after his military activity in the northern frontiers, he moved to restore Mughal control At the time, the region was also under threat from the Uzbeks, but the Emperor of Persia, himself beleaguered by the Ottoman Turks, was unable to send reinforcements [71]\n\n\nDeccan Sultans\nIn 1593, Akbar began military operations against the Deccan Sultans, who had not submitted to his authority He besieged Ahmednagar Fort in 1595, forcing Chand Bibi to cede Berar [citation needed] A subsequent revolt forced Akbar to take the fort in August 1600 Akbar occupied Burhanpur and besieged Asirgarh Fort in 1599, and took it on 17 January 1601, when Miran Bahadur Shah of the Khandesh Sultanate refused to relinquish Khandesh Akbar then established the Subahs of Ahmadnagar, Berar, and Khandesh under Prince Daniyal \"By the time of his death in 1605, Akbar controlled a broad sweep of territory from the Bay of Bengal to Qandahar and Badakshan He touched the western sea in Sind and at Surat and was well astride central India.\" [77]\n\n\nAdministration\nAkbar's system of central government was based on the system that had evolved since the Delhi Sultanate Akbar reorganised the sections with a detailed set of regulations The revenue department was headed by a wazir, responsible for finances and management of jagir and inam land The head of the military was called the mir bakshi, appointed from among the leading nobles of the court The mir bakshi was in charge of intelligence gathering, and made recommendations to the emperor for military appointments and promotion The mir saman was in charge of the imperial household, including the harems, and supervised the functioning of the court and royal bodyguard The judiciary was a separate organisation headed by a chief qazi, who was also responsible for religious beliefs and practices [78]\n\n\nPolitical structure\nAkbar's system of central

functioning of the court and royal bodyguard The judiciary was a separate organisation headed by a chief qazi, who was also responsible for religious beliefs and practices [78]\n\n\nTaxation\nAkbar reformed the administration land revenues by adopting a system that had been used by Sher Shah Suri The village continued to remain the primary unit of revenue assessment [79] Cultivated areas were measured and taxed through fixed rates—on the basis of prices prevailing the imperial court—based on the type of crop and productivity This system burdened the peasantry because prices at the imperial court were often higher than those in the countryside [80] Akbar also introduced a decentralised system of annual assessment, which resulted in corruption among local officials The system was abandoned in 1580 and replaced with the dahsala (also known as zabti), under which revenue was calculated as one-third of the average produce of the previous ten years, to be paid to the state in cash [81] This system was later refined, taking into account local prices and grouping areas with similar productivity into assessment circles Remission was given to peasants when the harvest failed during times of flood or drought [81] The dahsala system was set out by Raja Todar Mal, who also served as a revenue officer under Sher Shah Suri, in a detailed memorandum submitted to the emperor in 1582–1583 [82] [83] Other local methods of assessment continued in some areas Lands which were fallow or uncultivated were assessed at concessional rates [84]\n\n\nMilitary organisation\nAkbar organised his army and the nobility by means of a system called the mansabdari Under this system, each officer in the army was assigned a rank (a mansabdar) and assigned a number of cavalry, which he was required to supply to the imperial army [83] The mansabdars were divided into 33 classes The top three commanding ranks, ranging from 7,000 to 10,000 troops, were normally reserved for princes Ranks between 10 and 5,000 were assigned to other members of the nobility The empire's permanent standing army was small and the imperial forces mostly consisted of contingents maintained by the mansabdars [86] Persons were normally appointed to a low mansab and then promoted based on merit and the favour of the emperor [87] Each mansabdar was required to maintain a certain number of cavalrymen and twice that number of horses The number of horses was greater because they had to be rested and rapidly replaced in times of war Akbar employed strict measures to ensure that the quality of the armed forces was maintained at a high level; horses were regularly inspected and usually only Arabian horses were employed [88] The mansabdars were the highest paid military service in the world at the time [87]\n\n\nCapitals\nAkbar was a follower of Salim Chishti, a holy man who lived in the region of Sikri near Agra Believing the area to be lucky, Akbar had a mosque constructed there for the use of the priest Subsequently, he celebrated the victories over Chittor and Ranthambore by laying the foundations of a new walled capital, 23 miles (37 km) west of Agra in 1569, which was named Fatehpur (\"Town of Victory\") after the conquest of Gujarat in 1573, and subsequently came to be known as Fatehpur Sikri to distinguish it from other similarly named towns [55] The city was soon abandoned and the capital was moved to Lahore in 1585 Historians have advanced several reasons for the move, including an insufficient or poor quality water supply at Fatehpur Sikri, Akbar's campaigns in the northwest areas of the Empire or loss of interest [89] In 1599, Akbar moved his capital back to Agra, where he ruled until his death [90] [91]\n\n\nCulture\nAkbar was a patron of the arts and culture He had Sanskrit literature translated and participated in native festivals [citation needed] Akbar established the library of Fatehpur Sikri exclusively for women, [92] and he decreed the establishment of schools for the education of both Muslims and Hindus throughout the realm He also encouraged bookbinding to become a high art [93] [94]\n\n\nEconomy\nAkbar's government prioritized commercial expansion, [95] encouraging traders, providing protection and security for transactions, and levying a low custom duty to stimulate foreign trade [citation needed] It also required that local administrators provide restitution to traders for goods stolen while in their territories To minimise such incidents, bands of highway police called rahdars were enlisted to patrol roads and ensure the safety of traders [96] Other active measures taken included the construction and protection of routes of commerce and communications [97] Akbar made concerted efforts to improve roads to facilitate the use of wheeled vehicles through the Khyber Pass, the most popular route frequented by traders and travellers journeying from Kabul into Mughal India [97] He also strategically occupied the northwestern cities of Multan and Lahore in Punjab and constructed forts, such as the one at Attock near the crossing of the Grand Trunk Road and the Indus river He also constructed a network of smaller forts called thanas throughout the frontier to secure the overland trade route with Persia and Central Asia [98] He also established an international trading business for his chief consort, Mariam-uz-Zamani, who ran an extensive trade of indigo, spices, and cotton to Gulf nations through merchant's vessels [99]\n\n\nTrade\nAkbar's government prioritized commercial expansion,

Mariam-uz-Zamani, who ran an extensive trade of indigo, spices, and cotton to Gulf nations through merchant's vessels [99]\n\n\nCoins\nAkbar introduced coins with decorative features, including floral motifs, dotted borders, and quatrefoil The coins were issued in both round and square shapes, including a unique 'mehrab' (lozenge) shaped coin [100] Akbar's portrait type gold coin (Mohur) is generally attributed to his son, Prince Salim (later Emperor Jahangir), who had rebelled and then sought reconciliation by minting and presenting his father with gold Mohurs bearing Akbar's portrait [citation needed] During the latter part of Akbar's reign, coins portrayed the concept of Akbar's newly promoted religion, with the Ilahi type and Jalla Jalal-Hu types [citation needed]\n\n\nDiplomacy\nPrior to Akbar's reign, marriages between Hindu princesses and Muslim kings failed to produce stable relations between the families involved; the women were lost to their families and did not return after marriage [101] [102] [103] Akbar departed from that practice, providing that the Hindu Rajputs who married their daughters or sisters to him would be treated equally to his Muslim fathers- and brothers-in-law, except that they would not be allowed to dine or pray with him or take Muslim wives Akbar also made those Rajputs members of his court Some Rajputs considered marriage to Akbar a sign of humiliation [103]\n\n\nMatrimonial alliances\nPrior to Akbar's reign, marriages between Hindu princesses and Muslim kings failed to produce stable relations

neighbours rise in arms against him.\n\n\nRelations with the Portuguese\nA monarch should be ever intent on conquest, otherwise his neighbours rise in arms against him.\n\n\nRelations with the Ottoman Empire\nIn 1555, while Akbar was still a child, the Ottoman Admiral Seydi Ali Reis visited the Mughal Emperor Humayun In 1569, during the early years of Akbar's rule, Ottoman Admiral Kurtoğlu Hızır Reis visited the Empire These Ottoman admirals sought to end the growing threats of the Portuguese Empire during their Indian Ocean campaigns During his reign, Akbar six documents addressing the Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent [122] [123]\n\n\nRelations with the Safavid dynasty\nBefore Akbar's rule, the Safavids and the Mughals had a long history of diplomatic relations The Safavid ruler Tahmasp I provided refuge to Humayun when he was forced to flee the Indian subcontinent following his defeat by Sher Shah Suri However, the Safavids differed from the Sunni Mughals and Ottomans in following the Shia branch of Islam [133]\n\n\nRelations with other contemporary kingdoms\nVincent Arthur Smith has observed that the merchant Mildenhall was employed in 1600 to bear a letter from Queen Elizabeth to Akbar requesting liberty to trade in his dominions on terms as good as those enjoyed by the Portuguese [141]\n\n\nReligious policy\nAkbar, as well as his mother and other members of his family, are believed to have been Sunni Hanafi Muslims [143] His early days were spent in the backdrop of an atmosphere in which liberal sentiments were encouraged and religious narrow-mindedness was frowned upon [144] From the 15th century, a number of rulers in various parts of the country adopted a more liberal policy of religious tolerance, attempting to foster communal harmony between Hindus and Muslims [145] These sentiments were earlier encouraged by the teachings of popular saints like Guru Nanak, Kabir, and Chaitanya, [144] and the verses of the Persian poet Hafez, which advocated human sympathy and a liberal outlook [146] The Timurid ethos of religious tolerance persisted from the times of Timur to Humayun, and influenced Akbar's policy of tolerance in matters of religion [147] Akbar's childhood tutors, including two Irani Shias, were largely above sectarian prejudices, and made a significant contribution to Akbar's later inclination towards religious tolerance [147]\n\n\nAssociation with the Muslim aristocracy\nDuring the early part of his reign, Akbar adopted an attitude of suppression towards Muslim sects that were condemned by the orthodoxy as heretical [149] In 1567, on the advice of Shaikh Abdu'n Nabi, he ordered the exhumation of Mir Murtaza Sharifi Shirazi – a Shia buried in Delhi – because of the grave's proximity to that of Amir Khusrau, arguing that a \"heretic\" could not be buried so close to the grave of a Sunni saint This reflected a restrictive attitude towards the Shia, which continued to persist until the early 1570s [150] He suppressed Mahdavism in 1573 during his campaign in Gujarat, in the course of which the Mahdavi leader Bandagi Miyan Sheik Mustafa was arrested and brought in chains to the court for debate and released after eighteen months [150] Akbar was reportedly angered by acts of embezzlement by many high level Muslim clerics [151] As Akbar increasingly came under the influence of pantheistic Sufi mysticism from the early 1570s, his outlook shifted from orthodox Islam as traditionally professed, to a new concept of Islam that transcended the limits of Islam [150] Consequently, during the latter half of his reign, he adopted a policy of tolerance towards the Shias and declared a prohibition on Shia-Sunni conflict, and the empire remained neutral in matters of internal sectarian conflict [152] In 1579, the Mughal Emperor Akbar referred to himself as: [153]\n\n\nDin-i Ilahi\nAkbar was deeply interested in religious and philosophical matters An orthodox Muslim at the outset, he later came to be influenced by the Sufi mysticism that was being preached in the country at that time He moved away from orthodoxy, appointing to his court several people with liberal religious philosophies, including Abul Fazl, Faizi, and Birbal In 1575, he built a hall called the Ibadat Khana (\"House of Worship\") at Fatehpur Sikri, to which he invited theologians, mystics, and selected courtiers renowned for their intellectual achievements to discuss matters of spirituality with them [144] These discussions, initially restricted to Muslims, were acrimonious and resulted in the participants shouting at and abusing each other Upset by this, Akbar opened the Ibadat Khana to people of all religions as well as atheists, resulting in the scope of the discussions broadening, even extending into areas such as the validity of the Quran and the nature of God This shocked orthodox theologians, who sought to discredit Akbar by circulating rumours of his desire to forsake Islam [154]\n\n\nRelation with Hindus\nAkbar decreed that Hindus who had been forced to convert to Islam could reconvert to Hinduism without facing the death penalty [171] Akbar was well-liked by Hindus, who sang religious hymns to him and his eulogies [172]\n\n\nRelation with Jains\nAkbar regularly held discussions with Jain scholars and was impacted by their teachings His first encounter with Jain rituals was when he saw a procession of a Jain Shravaka named Champa after a six-month-long fast Impressed by her power and devotion, he invited her guru, Hiravijaya, to Fatehpur Sikri Hiravijaya accepted the invitation and travelled to the Mughal capital from Gujarat [175]\n\n\nHistorical accounts\nAkbar's reign was chronicled extensively by his court historian Abul Fazl in the books Akbarnama and Ain-i-akbari Other contemporary sources of Akbar's reign include the works of Badayuni, Shaikhzada Rashidi, and Shaikh Ahmed Sirhindi [citation needed]\n\n\nPersonality\nAkbar's reign was chronicled extensively by his court historian Abul Fazl in the books Akbarnama and Ain-i-akbari Other contemporary sources of Akbar's reign include the works of Badayuni, Shaikhzada Rashidi, and Shaikh Ahmed Sirhindi [citation needed]\n\n\nHagiography\nDuring Akbar's reign, the ongoing process of inter-religious discourse and syncretism resulted in a series of religious attributions to him in terms of positions of assimilation, doubt, or uncertainty, which he either assisted himself or left unchallenged [189] Such hagiographical accounts of Akbar traversed a wide range of denominational and sectarian spaces, including several accounts by Parsis, Jains, and Jesuit missionaries, apart from contemporary accounts by Brahminical and Muslim orthodoxy [190] Existing sects and denominations, as well as various religious figures who represented popular worship felt they had a claim to him The diversity of these accounts is attributed to the fact that his reign resulted in the formation of a flexible centralised state accompanied by personal authority and cultural heterogeneity [189]\n\n\nAkbarnāma, the Book of Akbar\nThe Akbarnāma (Persian: اکبر نامہ), which literally means Book of Akbar, is an official biographical account of Akbar written in Persian It includes vivid and detailed descriptions of his life and times [191] The work was commissioned by Akbar, and written by Abul Fazl, one of the Nine Jewels (Hindi: Navaratnas) of Akbar's royal court The book reportedly took seven years to complete and the original manuscripts contained a number of paintings supporting the texts The paintings are in the Mughal school of painting, and included works of masters of the imperial workshop, including Basawan, whose use of portraiture in its illustrations was an innovation in Indian art [191]\n\n\nConsorts and concubines\nAkbar's first wife and one of the chief consorts was his cousin, Princess Ruqaiya Sultan Begum, [192] [5] the only daughter of his paternal uncle, Prince Hindal Mirza, [193] and his wife Sultanam Begum In 1551, Hindal Mirza died fighting in a battle against Kamran Mirza's forces Upon hearing the news of his brother's death, Humayun was overwhelmed with grief [24] Hindal's daughter Ruqaiya married Akbar about the time of his first appointment, at age nine, as governor of Ghazni Province [25] Akbar was also given the command of his uncle's army [26] Akbar's marriage with Ruqaiya was solemnised near Jalandhar, Punjab, when both of them were 14 years old [27] She was a senior-ranking wife of Akbar She died childless in January 1626 and was buried next to her father's grave [194]\n\n\nDeath\nOn 3 October 1605, Akbar fell ill from an attack of dysentery, [29] from which he never recovered He is believed to have died on 26 October 1605 He was buried at his mausoleum in Sikandra, Agra, [236] which lies a kilometer next to the tomb of Mariam-uz-Zamani, his favourite consort [6] [7]\n\n\nLegacy\nAkbar firmly entrenched the authority of the Mughal Empire in India and beyond, after it had been threatened by the Afghans during his father's reign, [237] establishing its military and diplomatic superiority [238] During his reign, he created a secular and liberal government with an emphasis on cultural integration He also introduced several reforms, including prohibiting sati, legalising widow remarriage, and raising the age of marriage

{"title": "Maximilian_I_of_Mexico", "content": "\nEarly life\nMaximilian was born on 6 July 1832 in the Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna, capital of the Austrian Empire [8] [9] He was baptized the following day as Ferdinand Maximilian Josef Maria The first name honored his godfather and paternal uncle, the future Emperor Ferdinand I, and the second honored his late maternal grandfather, Maximilian I Joseph, King of Bavaria [10] [11] His father was Archduke Franz Karl, the second surviving son of Emperor Francis I, during whose reign he was born Maximilian was thus a member of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine [12] His mother was Princess Sophie of Bavaria, a member of the House of Wittelsbach [13] Intelligent, ambitious and strong-willed, Sophie had little in common with her husband, whom historian Richard O'Conner characterized as \"an amiably dim fellow whose main interest in life was consuming bowls of dumplings drenched in gravy\" [14] Despite their different personalities, the marriage was fruitful, and after four miscarriages, four sons – including Maximilian – would reach adulthood [15] Rumors at the court alleged that Maximilian was the product of an extramarital affair between his mother and Napoleon II, Duke of Reichstadt [16] The existence of an illicit affair between Sophie and the duke, and any possibility that Maximilian was conceived from such a union, are dubious [A]\n\n\nYears in the Imperial Austrian Navy\nNot destined to rule, Maximilian entered military service, training in the small Imperial Austrian Navy He displayed zeal in his naval career and his direct link with Emperor Franz Joseph enabled the diversion of resources to what had previously been a neglected service [30]\n\n\nMarriage to Charlotte of Belgium, personal life, and family remnants\nIn May 1856, Franz Joseph asked Maximilian to return from Paris to Vienna, stopping on the way at Brussels, in order to visit the King of the Belgians, Leopold I On 30 May 1856, he arrived in Belgium where he was received by Prince Philippe, younger son of King Leopold He was accompanied by the Belgian princes, visiting the cities of Tournai, Kortrijk, Bruges, Ghent, Antwerp, and Charleroi  [42] In Brussels, Maximilian met the only daughter of the king and the late queen Louise of Orleans, Charlotte of Belgium, and romance blossomed  [43] Leopold I, upon becoming aware of the couple's feelings advised Maximilian to propose From the Belgian viewpoint, the marriage was highly advantageous, since the nation was newly established and could benefit from ties to the Great Powers Having been unlucky in love twice before, Maximilian's marriage to the daughter of a reigning European monarch was suitable and would seem to be a happy conclusion to his bachelorhood Maximilian proposed and was welcomed into the Belgian Court He later remarked on the contrast of the Belgian Palace of Laeken to the splendor of the Imperial Viennese royal residences, [42] not surprising since Belgium was but a small and new kingdom.\n\n\nViceroy of Lombardy-Venetia, 1857–59\nOn 28 February 1857, Franz Joseph named Maximilian as viceroy of Lombardy-Venetia, an Italian-speaking region of the empire [56] On 6 September 1857, Maximilian and Charlotte made their entrance to the capital Milan During their stay there the couple lived at the Royal Palace of Milan and occasionally resided at the Royal Villa of Monza [57] As viceroy, Maximilian lived as a sovereign surrounded by an imposing court of chamberlains and servants [58] During his two years as viceroy, Maximilian continued the construction of Miramar Castle, which would not be finished until three years later Charlotte's royal dowry aided in the construction Her brother Leopold would remark in his diary that “the construction of that palace amounts to endless madness.” [59]\n\n\nDismissal as viceroy\nMaximilian's tenure as viceroy was short-lived, lasting only two years during a period of rising local tensions Although holding title of viceroy, his jurisdiction did not fully extend over the Austrian garrison, which was opposed to any sort of liberal reforms Maximilian went to Vienna in April 1858 to ask his brother the emperor to grant him both military and administrative jurisdiction, while continuing a policy of concessions Franz Joseph rejected the appeal  [56] That left Maximilian with only the limited role of prefect of police while tensions with Piedmont were rising On 3 January 1859, for security reasons, Carlota was asked to return to Miramar, and she sent her valuables out of Lombardy-Venetia Only while safe in the royal Palace of Milan did she share her concerns with her mother-in-law Sophie  [66]\n\n\nEmperor of Mexico\nAfter gaining independence in 1821 Mexico had soon divided itself into liberal and conservative parties, the latter of which had a monarchist faction The failed monarchy of Agustín I that saw him forced to abdicate, swearing to remain in exile, met its final demise when he returned to Mexico and was shot in 1824 Nonetheless, Conservatives continued to see monarchy as a viable option Monarchist plans had most clearly been laid out in an 1840 essay by the statesman José María Gutiérrez de Estrada, which argued that after two decades of chaos, the republic had failed, and that a European prince ought to be invited to establish a Mexican throne Such ideas received official interest during the presidency of Mariano Paredes and during the last presidency of Santa Anna, but by the late 1850s the liberals had appeared to have achieved a decisive victory through the promulgation of the Constitution of 1857, which constrained the powers of the Mexican Catholic Church and the Mexican Army, two traditional bastions of conservativism Conservatives declared the Constitution null and void and formed a rival conservative government The three-year civil war (1858–61) between liberals and conservatives was won by liberals on the battlefield Conservatives regrouped after the defeat and sought external allies for their monarchist cause.\n\n\nBackground to Accession\nAfter gaining independence in 1821 Mexico had soon divided itself into liberal and conservative parties, the latter of which had a monarchist faction The failed monarchy of Agustín I that saw him forced to abdicate, swearing to remain in exile, met its final demise when he returned to Mexico and was shot in 1824 Nonetheless, Conservatives continued to see monarchy as a viable option Monarchist plans had most clearly been laid out in an 1840

Conservatives declared the Constitution null and void and formed a rival conservative government The three-year civil war (1858–61) between liberals and conservatives was won by liberals on the battlefield Conservatives regrouped after the defeat and sought external allies for their monarchist cause.\n\n\nFrench invasion, Mexican conservatives, and Maximilian's agreement\nIn the interim, the agreement among France, the United Kingdom, and Spain broke down as it became increasingly clear that France intended to overthrow Juárez's liberal government of Mexico France began military operations in April 1862 They were eventually joined by conservative Mexican generals who were not reconciled to their loss to the liberals in the War of Reform [77]\n\n\nArrival in Mexico\nIn April 1864, Maximilian stepped down from his duties as Chief of Naval Section of the Austrian Navy He traveled from Trieste aboard SMS Novara, escorted by the frigates SMS Bellona (Austrian) and Thémis (French), and the Imperial yacht Fantasie led the warship procession from his Miramare Castle out to sea [82] They received a blessing from Pope Pius IX, and Queen Victoria ordered the Gibraltar garrison to fire a salute for Maximilian's passing ship [83]\n\n\nRule\nAlthough Maximilian had been brought to power with the support of Mexican conservatives expecting he would reverse the reforms of Mexican liberals, codified in the Constitution of 1857, Maximilian and Napoleon III did not want hardline Mexicans to control the regime Napoleon III had a confidential policy known to his military commander Bazaine to marginalize the conservatives and create a moderate monarchy with wide support [94] Maximilian was in agreement and sought to establish a regime that included liberals In the summer of 1864 Maximilian declared a political amnesty for all liberals wishing to join the Empire His conciliatory efforts eventually won over some moderate liberals such as José Fernando Ramírez, José María Lacunza, Manuel Orozco y Berra, and northern strongman Santiago Vidaurri, a former ally of Juárez [95]\n\n\nCourt life\nMaximilian lived for the most part at Chapultepec Castle, making occasional retreats to his villa at Cuernavaca, where he had also taken a mistress named Concepción Sedano [49] He preferred to dress plainly and also enjoyed wearing traditional Mexican clothing [115] He enjoyed the Mexican countryside and would often go horse-riding, walking, and swimming [116] On Sundays at Chapultepec Palace, Maximilian and Carlota frequently held audiences with people from all social and economic segments, including Mexico's Indigenous peoples [117] The royal couple also hosted multiple balls for Mexican high society [118]\n\n\nDeteriorating military situation\nIn April 1865, the American Civil War ended, and while the American government was reluctant to enter upon a conflict with France to enforce the Monroe Doctrine, official American sympathy remained with president Benito Juárez The U.S government refused to recognize the Empire and also ignored Maximilian's correspondence [119] In December, a  private American loan worth $30 million was approved for Juárez, and American volunteers kept joining the Mexican republican troops [120] An unofficial American raid occurred near Brownsville, and Juárez's minister to the United States, Matías Romero, proposed that General Grant or General Sherman intervene in Mexico to help the liberals [121] The prospect of an American invasion to reinstate Juárez caused a number of Maximilian's loyal adherents to abandon his cause and leave the capital [122] The United States refrained from direct military intervention, but continued to put diplomatic pressure on France to leave Mexico [123]\n\n\nFall of the Empire\nIn October 1866 Maximilian moved his cabinet to Orizaba and was widely rumored to be leaving the nation He contemplated abdication, and on 25 November held a council of his ministers to address the crisis faced by his government They narrowly voted against abdication and Maximilian headed back towards the capital [130] He intended to appeal to the nation in order to hold a national assembly which would then decide what form of government the Mexican nation was to take [131] Such a measure would require a ceasefire from Juárez, who had no intention of conceding to someone whom he viewed as the puppet of the French invaders.\n\n\nExecution\nMaximilian's trial began on 13 June, in the Teatro Iturbide of Querétaro, and he was charged with conspiring to overthrow the Mexican government and with carrying out the Black Decree Maximilian's lawyers, which included the conservative statesman Rafael Martínez de la Torre, attempted to defend the legitimacy of the Empire and Maximilian's benevolent rule [134] After only one day the court returned a verdict of guilty and sentenced Maximilian to death [135]\n\n\nCultural depictions and portrayals\nMaximilian's execution was portrayed in a series of three paintings by French painter Édouard Manet, who had Republican sympathies His third depiction of the execution shows the Mexican soldiers wearing \"uniforms almost identical to French troops, and the man preparing for the coup de grâce shares the conspicuous features of Napoleon III The implication was clear: Napoleon III had blood on his hands Unsurprisingly, the painting was banned from public display in Paris\" [143]\n\n\nLegacy\nWith Maximilian's execution in 1867 by a firing squad of the restored republic, schemes and dreams of a royal head of state came to an end in Mexico Historians are still assessing the period in Mexican history and Maximilian's role as well as that of the man he unsuccessfully aimed to depose, the liberal president of the Mexican Republic, Benito Juárez With Maximilian's execution, the second emperor of Mexico to have met that fate following that of Agustín I of Mexico, monarchism in Mexico ceased to be a goal of Mexican conservatives [citation needed]\n\n\nHonours\n\n\nArms\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Maximilian I of

During his two years as viceroy, Maximilian continued the construction of Miramar Castle, which would not be finished until three years later. Charlotte's royal dowry aided in the construction.\n\nDismissal as Viceroy\n---------------------\n\nMaximilian's tenure as viceroy was short-lived, lasting only two years during a period of rising local tensions. Although holding title of viceroy, his jurisdiction did not fully extend over the Austrian garrison, which was opposed to any sort of liberal reforms. Maximilian went to Vienna in April 1858 to ask his brother the emperor to grant him both military and administrative jurisdiction, while continuing a policy of concessions. Franz Joseph rejected the appeal, leaving Maximilian with only the limited role of prefect of police while tensions with Piedmont were rising.\n\nEmperor of Mexico\n-------------------\n\nMaximilian was invited to become the Emperor of Mexico in 1864, following the French invasion of Mexico. He was brought to power with the support of Mexican conservatives, who expected him to reverse the reforms of Mexican liberals, codified in the Constitution of 1857. However, Maximilian and Napoleon III did not want hardline Mexicans to control the regime and sought to establish a moderate monarchy with wide support.\n\nCourt Life\n------------\n\nMaximilian lived for the most part at Chapultepec Castle, making occasional retreats to his villa at Cuernavaca, where he had also taken a mistress named Concepción Sedano. He preferred to dress plainly and also enjoyed wearing traditional Mexican clothing. He enjoyed the Mexican countryside and would often go horse-riding, walking, and swimming. On Sundays at Chapultepec Palace, Maximilian and Carlota frequently held audiences with people from all social and economic segments, including Mexico's Indigenous peoples. The royal couple also hosted multiple balls for Mexican high society.\n\nDeteriorating Military Situation\n---------------------------------\n\nIn April 1865, the American Civil War ended, and while the American government was reluctant to enter upon a conflict with France to enforce the Monroe Doctrine, official American sympathy remained with president Benito Juárez. The U.S government refused to recognize the Empire and also ignored Maximilian's correspondence. In December, a private American loan worth $30 million was approved for Juárez, and American volunteers kept joining the Mexican republican troops. An unofficial American raid occurred near Brownsville, and Juárez's minister to the United States, Matías Romero, proposed that General Grant or General Sherman intervene in Mexico to help the liberals.\n\nFall of the Empire\n-------------------\n\nIn October 1866 Maximilian moved his cabinet to Orizaba and was widely rumored to be leaving the nation. He contemplated abdication, and on 25 November held a council of his ministers to address the crisis faced by his government. They narrowly voted against abdication, and Maximilian headed back towards the capital. He intended to appeal to the nation in order to hold a national assembly which would then decide what form of government the Mexican nation was to take.\n\nExecution\n----------\n\nMaximilian's trial began on 13 June, in the Teatro Iturbide of Querétaro, and he was charged with conspiring to overthrow the Mexican government and with carrying out the Black Decree. Maximilian's lawyers, which included the conservative statesman Rafael Martínez de la Torre, attempted to defend the legitimacy of the Empire and Maximilian's benevolent rule. After only one day the court returned a verdict of guilty and sentenced Maximilian to death.\n\nLegacy\n--------\n\nMaximilian's execution in 1867 by a firing squad of the restored republic marked the end of schemes and dreams of a royal head of state in Mexico. Historians are still assessing the period in Mexican history and Maximilian's role as well as that of the man he unsuccessfully aimed to depose, the liberal president of the Mexican Republic, Benito Juárez. With Maximilian's execution, the second emperor of Mexico to have met that fate following that of Agustín I of Mexico, monarchism in Mexico ceased to be a goal of Mexican conservatives.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Maximilian_I_of_Mexico\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nMaximilian was born on 6 July 1832 in the Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna, capital of the Austrian Empire [8] [9] He was baptized the following day as Ferdinand Maximilian Josef Maria The first name honored his godfather and paternal uncle, the future Emperor Ferdinand I, and the second honored his late maternal grandfather, Maximilian I Joseph, King of Bavaria [10] [11] His father was Archduke Franz Karl, the second surviving son of Emperor Francis I, during whose reign he was born Maximilian was thus a member of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine [12] His mother was Princess Sophie of Bavaria, a member of the House of Wittelsbach [13] Intelligent, ambitious and strong-willed, Sophie had little in common with her husband, whom historian Richard O'Conner characterized as \"an amiably dim fellow whose main interest in life was consuming bowls of dumplings drenched in gravy\" [14] Despite their different personalities, the marriage was fruitful, and after four miscarriages, four sons – including Maximilian – would reach adulthood [15] Rumors at the court alleged that Maximilian was the product of an extramarital affair between his mother and Napoleon II, Duke of Reichstadt [16] The existence of an illicit affair between Sophie and the duke, and any possibility that Maximilian was conceived from such a union, are dubious [A]\n\n\nYears in the Imperial Austrian Navy\nNot destined to rule, Maximilian entered military service, training in the small Imperial Austrian Navy He displayed zeal in his naval career and his direct link with Emperor Franz Joseph enabled the diversion of resources to what had previously been a neglected service [30]\n\n\nMarriage to Charlotte of Belgium, personal life, and family remnants\nIn May 1856, Franz Joseph asked Maximilian to return from Paris to Vienna, stopping on the way at Brussels, in order to visit the King of the Belgians, Leopold I On 30 May 1856, he arrived in Belgium where he was received by Prince Philippe, younger son of King Leopold He was accompanied by the Belgian princes, visiting the cities of Tournai, Kortrijk, Bruges, Ghent, Antwerp, and Charleroi  [42] In Brussels, Maximilian met the only daughter of the king and the late queen Louise of Orleans, Charlotte of Belgium, and romance blossomed  [43] Leopold I, upon becoming aware of the couple's feelings advised Maximilian to propose From the Belgian viewpoint, the marriage was highly advantageous, since the nation was newly established and could benefit from ties to the Great Powers Having been unlucky in love twice before, Maximilian's marriage to the daughter of a reigning European monarch was suitable and would seem to be a happy conclusion to his bachelorhood Maximilian proposed and was welcomed into the Belgian Court He later remarked on the contrast of the Belgian Palace of Laeken to the splendor of the Imperial Viennese royal residences, [42] not surprising since Belgium was but a small and new kingdom.\n\n\nViceroy of Lombardy-Venetia, 1857–59\nOn 28 February 1857, Franz Joseph named Maximilian as viceroy of Lombardy-Venetia, an Italian-speaking region of the empire [56] On 6 September 1857, Maximilian and Charlotte made their entrance to the capital Milan During their stay there the couple lived at the Royal Palace of Milan and occasionally resided at the Royal Villa of Monza [57] As viceroy, Maximilian lived as a sovereign surrounded by an imposing court of chamberlains and servants [58] During his two years as viceroy, Maximilian continued the construction of Miramar Castle, which would not be finished until three years later Charlotte's royal dowry aided in the construction Her brother Leopold would remark in his diary that “the construction of that palace amounts to endless madness.” [59]\n\n\nDismissal as viceroy\nMaximilian's tenure as viceroy was short-lived, lasting only two years during a period of rising local tensions Although holding title of viceroy, his jurisdiction did not fully extend over the Austrian garrison, which was opposed to any sort of liberal reforms Maximilian went to Vienna in April 1858 to ask his brother the emperor to grant him both military and administrative jurisdiction, while continuing a policy of concessions Franz Joseph rejected the appeal  [56] That left Maximilian with only the limited role of prefect of police while tensions with Piedmont were rising On 3 January 1859, for security reasons, Carlota was asked to return to Miramar, and she sent her valuables out of Lombardy-Venetia Only while safe in the royal Palace of Milan did she share her concerns with her mother-in-law Sophie  [66]\n\n\nEmperor of Mexico\nAfter gaining independence in 1821 Mexico had soon divided itself into liberal and conservative parties, the latter of which had a monarchist faction The failed monarchy of Agustín I that saw him forced to abdicate, swearing to remain in exile, met its final demise when he returned to Mexico and was shot in 1824 Nonetheless, Conservatives continued to see monarchy as a viable option Monarchist plans had most clearly been laid out in an 1840 essay by the statesman José María Gutiérrez de Estrada, which argued that after two decades of chaos, the republic had failed, and that a European prince ought to be invited to establish a Mexican throne Such ideas received official interest during the presidency of Mariano Paredes and during the last presidency of Santa Anna, but by the late 1850s the liberals had appeared to have achieved a decisive victory through the promulgation of the Constitution of 1857, which constrained the powers of the Mexican Catholic Church and the Mexican Army, two traditional bastions of conservativism Conservatives declared the Constitution null and void and formed a rival conservative government The three-year civil war (1858–61) between liberals and conservatives was won by liberals on the battlefield Conservatives regrouped after the defeat and sought external allies for their monarchist cause.\n\n\nBackground to Accession\nAfter gaining independence in 1821 Mexico had soon divided itself into liberal and conservative parties, the latter of which had a monarchist faction The failed

civil war (1858–61) between liberals and conservatives was won by liberals on the battlefield Conservatives regrouped after the defeat and sought external allies for their monarchist cause.\n\n\nFrench invasion, Mexican conservatives, and Maximilian's agreement\nIn the interim, the agreement among France, the United Kingdom, and Spain broke down as it became increasingly clear that France intended to overthrow Juárez's liberal government of Mexico France began military operations in April 1862 They were eventually joined by conservative Mexican generals who were not reconciled to their loss to the liberals in the War of Reform [77]\n\n\nArrival in Mexico\nIn April 1864, Maximilian stepped down from his duties as Chief of Naval Section of the Austrian Navy He traveled from Trieste aboard SMS Novara, escorted by the frigates SMS Bellona (Austrian) and Thémis (French), and the Imperial yacht Fantasie led the warship procession from his Miramare Castle out to sea [82] They received a blessing from Pope Pius IX, and Queen Victoria ordered the Gibraltar garrison to fire a salute for Maximilian's passing ship [83]\n\n\nRule\nAlthough Maximilian had been brought to power with the support of Mexican conservatives expecting he would reverse the reforms of Mexican liberals, codified in the Constitution of 1857, Maximilian and Napoleon III did not want hardline Mexicans to control the regime Napoleon III had a confidential policy known to his military commander Bazaine to marginalize the conservatives and create a moderate monarchy with wide support [94] Maximilian was in agreement and sought to establish a regime that included liberals In the summer of 1864 Maximilian declared a political amnesty for all liberals wishing to join the Empire His conciliatory efforts eventually won over some moderate liberals such as José Fernando Ramírez, José María Lacunza, Manuel Orozco y Berra, and northern strongman Santiago Vidaurri, a former ally of Juárez [95]\n\n\nCourt life\nMaximilian lived for the most part at Chapultepec Castle, making occasional retreats to his villa at Cuernavaca, where he had also taken a mistress named Concepción Sedano [49] He preferred to dress plainly and also enjoyed wearing traditional Mexican clothing [115] He enjoyed the Mexican countryside and would often go horse-riding, walking, and swimming [116] On

raid occurred near Brownsville, and Juárez's minister to the United States, Matías Romero, proposed that General Grant or General Sherman intervene in Mexico to help the liberals [121] The prospect of an American invasion to reinstate Juárez caused a number of Maximilian's loyal adherents to abandon his cause and leave the capital [122] The United States refrained from direct military intervention, but continued to put diplomatic pressure on France to leave Mexico [123]\n\n\nFall of the Empire\nIn October 1866 Maximilian moved his cabinet to Orizaba and was widely rumored to be leaving the nation He contemplated abdication, and on 25 November held a council of his ministers to address the crisis faced by his government They narrowly voted against abdication and Maximilian headed back towards the capital [130] He intended to appeal to the nation in order to hold a national assembly which would then decide what form of government the Mexican nation was to take [131] Such a measure would require a ceasefire from Juárez, who had no intention of conceding to someone whom he viewed as the puppet of the French invaders.\n\n\nExecution\nMaximilian's trial began on 13 June, in the

Maximilian to death [135]\n\n\nCultural depictions and portrayals\nMaximilian's execution was portrayed in a series of three paintings by French painter Édouard Manet, who had Republican sympathies His third depiction of the execution shows the Mexican soldiers wearing \"uniforms almost identical to French troops, and the man preparing for the coup de grâce shares the conspicuous features of Napoleon III The implication was clear: Napoleon III had blood on his hands Unsurprisingly, the painting was banned from public display in Paris\" [143]\n\n\nLegacy\nWith Maximilian's execution in 1867 by a firing squad of the restored republic, schemes and dreams of a royal head of state came to an end in Mexico Historians are still assessing the period in Mexican history and Maximilian's role

{"title": "New_Zealand", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe first European visitor to New Zealand, Dutch explorer Abel Tasman, named the islands Staten Land, believing they were part of the Staten Landt that Jacob Le Maire had sighted off the southern end of South America [17] [18] Hendrik Brouwer proved that the South American land was a small island in 1643, and Dutch cartographers subsequently renamed Tasman's discovery Nova Zeelandia from Latin, after the Dutch province of Zeeland [17] [19] This name was later anglicised to New Zealand [20] [21]\n\n\nHistory\nThe first people to reach New Zealand were Polynesians in ocean going waka (canoes) Their arrival likely occurred in several waves, approximately between 1280 and 1350 CE Those Polynesian settlers, isolated in New Zealand, became the Māori of later years According to an early European synthesized interpretation of various Māori traditional accounts, around 750 CE the heroic explorer, Kupe, had discovered New Zealand and later, around 1350, one great fleet of settlers set out from Hawaiki in eastern Polynesia [35] However, from the late 20th century, this story has been increasingly relegated to the realm of legend and myth An alternative view has emerged from fresh archaeological and scientific evidence, which correlates with doubts raised by historians everywhere as to the reliability of interpretations drawn from the oral evidence of indigenous peoples, including from Māori [36]\n\n\nGeography and environment\nNew Zealand is located near the centre of the water hemisphere and is made up of two main islands and more than 700 smaller islands [92] The two main islands (the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Māui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamu) are separated by Cook Strait, 22 kilometres (14 mi) wide at its narrowest point [93] Besides the North and South Islands, the five largest inhabited islands are Stewart Island (across the Foveaux Strait), Chatham Island, Great Barrier Island (in the Hauraki Gulf), [94] D'Urville Island (in the Marlborough Sounds) [95] and Waiheke Island (about 22 km (14 mi) from central Auckland) [96]\n\n\nClimate\nNew Zealand's climate is predominantly temperate maritime (Köppen: Cfb), with mean annual temperatures ranging from 10 °C (50 °F) in the south to 16 °C (61 °F) in the north [113] Historical maxima and minima are 42.4 °C (108.32 °F) in Rangiora, Canterbury and −25.6 °C (−14.08 °F) in Ranfurly, Otago [114] Conditions vary sharply across regions from extremely wet on the West Coast of the South Island to semi-arid in Central Otago and the Mackenzie Basin of inland Canterbury and subtropical in Northland [115] [116] Of the seven largest cities, Christchurch is the driest, receiving on average only 618 millimetres (24.3 in) of rain per year and Wellington the wettest, receiving almost twice that amount [117] Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch all receive a yearly average of more than 2,000 hours of sunshine The southern and southwestern parts of the South Island have a cooler and cloudier climate, with around 1,400–1,600 hours; the northern and northeastern parts of the South Island are the sunniest areas of the country and receive about 2,400–2,500 hours [118] The general snow season is early June until early October, though cold snaps can occur outside this season [119] Snowfall is common in the eastern and southern parts of the South Island and mountain areas across the country [113]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nNew Zealand's geographic isolation for 80 million years [121] and island biogeography has influenced evolution of the country's species of animals, fungi and plants Physical isolation has caused biological isolation, resulting in a dynamic evolutionary ecology with examples of distinctive plants and animals as well as populations of widespread species [122] [123] The flora and fauna of New Zealand were originally thought to have originated from New Zealand's fragmentation off from Gondwana, however more recent evidence postulates species resulted from dispersal [124] About 82% of New Zealand's indigenous vascular plants are endemic, covering 1,944 species across 65 genera [125] [126] The number of fungi recorded from New Zealand, including lichen-forming species, is not known, nor is the proportion of those fungi which are endemic, but one estimate suggests there are about 2,300 species of lichen-forming fungi in New Zealand [125] and 40% of these are endemic [127] The two main types of forest are those dominated by broadleaf trees with emergent podocarps, or by southern beech in cooler climates [128] The remaining vegetation types consist of grasslands, the majority of which are tussock [129]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nNew Zealand is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democracy, [150] although its constitution is not codified [151] Charles III is the King of New Zealand [152] and thus the head of state [153] The king is represented by the governor-general, whom he appoints on the advice of the prime minister [154] The governor-general can exercise the Crown's prerogative powers, such as reviewing cases of injustice and making appointments of ministers, ambassadors, and other key public officials, [155] and in rare situations, the reserve powers (e.g the power to dissolve Parliament or refuse the royal assent of a bill into law) [156] The powers of the monarch and the governor-general are limited by constitutional constraints, and they cannot normally be exercised without the advice of ministers [156]\n\n\nRegions and external territories\nThe early European settlers divided New Zealand into provinces, which had a degree of autonomy [182] Because of financial pressures and the desire to consolidate railways, education, land sales, and other policies, government was centralised and the provinces were abolished in 1876 [183] The provinces are remembered in regional public holidays [184] and sporting rivalries [185]\n\n\nForeign relations\n\nDuring the period of the New Zealand colony, Britain was responsible for external trade and foreign relations [199] The 1923 and 1926 Imperial Conferences decided that New Zealand should be allowed to negotiate its own political treaties, and the first commercial treaty was ratified in 1928 with Japan On 3 September 1939, New Zealand allied itself with Britain and declared war on Germany with Prime Minister Michael Joseph Savage proclaiming, \"Where she goes, we go; where she stands, we stand\" [200]\n\nMilitary\nNew Zealand's military services—the New Zealand Defence Force—comprise the New Zealand Army, the Royal New Zealand Air Force, and the Royal New Zealand Navy [226] New Zealand's national defence needs are modest since a direct attack is unlikely [227] However, its military has had a global presence The country fought in both world wars, with notable campaigns in Gallipoli, Crete, [228] El Alamein, [229] and Cassino [230] The Gallipoli campaign played an important part in fostering New Zealand's national identity [231] [232] and strengthened the ANZAC tradition it shares with Australia [233]\n\n\nEconomy\nNew Zealand has an advanced market economy, [238] ranked 13th in the 2021 [update] Human Development Index, [239] and fourth in the 2022 [update] Index of Economic Freedom [240] It is a high-income economy with a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of US$36,254 [241] The currency is the New Zealand dollar, informally known as the \"Kiwi dollar\"; it also circulates in the Cook Islands (see Cook Islands dollar), Niue, Tokelau, and the Pitcairn Islands [242]\n\n\nTrade\nNew Zealand is heavily dependent on international trade, [271] particularly in agricultural products [272] Exports account for 24% of its output, [98] making New Zealand vulnerable to international commodity prices and global economic slowdowns Food products made up 55% of the value of all the country's exports in 2014;

the short-e sound (as in dress) has moved towards the short-i sound; and the short-a sound (as in trap) has moved to the short-e sound [338]\n\n\nReligion\nAt the 2023 census, 51.6% of population stated they had no religion, [350] up from 48.2% in 2018 census [335] As the largest religious minority as per the census, the Christians forming 32.3% of the population, [350] compared to 36.5% in 2018 [335] Hindus are the second largest religious minority, forming the 2.9% of population, followed by Muslims on 1.5% [350] The Auckland Region exhibited the greatest religious diversity [351]\n\n\nEducation\nPrimary and secondary schooling is compulsory for children aged 6 to 16, with the majority of children attending from the age of 5 [352] There are 13 school years and attending state (public) schools is free to New Zealand citizens and permanent residents from a person's 5th birthday to the end of the calendar year following their 19th birthday [353] New Zealand has an adult literacy rate of 99%, [98] and over half of the population aged 15 to 29 hold a tertiary qualification [352] There are five types of government-owned tertiary institutions: universities, colleges of education, polytechnics, specialist colleges, and wānanga, [354] in addition to private training establishments [355] In 2021, in the population aged 25–64;

It is situated near the center of the water hemisphere and is known for its unique geography, diverse culture, and rich history.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe first European visitor to New Zealand was Dutch explorer Abel Tasman, who named the islands Staten Land, believing them to be part of the Staten Landt that Jacob Le Maire had sighted off the southern end of South America. Hendrik Brouwer later proved that the South American land was a small island, and Dutch cartographers subsequently renamed Tasman's discovery Nova Zeelandia from Latin, after the Dutch province of Zeeland. This name was later anglicized to New Zealand.\n\n**History**\n\nThe first people to reach New Zealand were Polynesians in ocean-going waka (canoes), who arrived around 1280-1350 CE. These Polynesian settlers became the Māori of later years. According to early European synthesized interpretations of Māori traditional accounts, around 750 CE the heroic explorer Kupe had discovered New Zealand, and later, around 1350, one great fleet of settlers set out from Hawaiki in eastern Polynesia. However, from the late 20th century, this story has been increasingly relegated to the realm of legend and myth, and alternative views have emerged from fresh archaeological and scientific evidence.\n\n**Geography and Environment**\n\nNew Zealand is made up of two main islands, the North Island and the South Island, which are separated by Cook Strait, 22 kilometers (14 miles) wide at its narrowest point. The North Island is home to the majority of the population and is the larger of the two islands, covering an area of 103,000 square kilometers (40,000 sq mi). The South Island is smaller, covering an area of 145,000 square kilometers (56,000 sq mi), and is known for its rugged terrain and stunning natural scenery. Besides the North and South Islands, the five largest inhabited islands are Stewart Island, Chatham Island, Great Barrier Island, D'Urville Island, and Waiheke Island.\n\n**Climate**\n\nNew Zealand's climate is predominantly temperate maritime, with mean annual temperatures ranging from 10°C (50°F) in the south to 16°C (61°F) in the north. Historical maxima and minima are 42.4°C (108.32°F) in Rangiora, Canterbury, and -25.6°C (-14.08°F) in Ranfurly, Otago. Conditions vary sharply across regions from extremely wet on the West Coast of the South Island to semi-arid in Central Otago and the Mackenzie Basin of inland Canterbury and subtropical in Northland. Of the seven largest cities, Christchurch is the driest, receiving on average only 618 millimeters (24.3 in) of rain per year, and Wellington is the wettest, receiving almost twice that amount.\n\n**Biodiversity**\n\nNew Zealand's geographic isolation for 80 million years and island biogeography have influenced the evolution of the country's species of animals, fungi, and plants. Physical isolation has caused biological isolation, resulting in a dynamic evolutionary ecology with examples of distinctive plants and animals as well as populations of widespread species. The flora and fauna of New Zealand were originally thought to have originated from New Zealand's fragmentation off from Gondwana, but more recent evidence suggests that species resulted from dispersal. About 82% of New Zealand's indigenous vascular plants are endemic, covering 1,944 species across 65 genera.\n\n**Government and Politics**\n\nNew Zealand is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democracy, although its constitution is not codified. Charles III is the King of New Zealand and thus the head of state. The king is represented by the governor-general, whom he appoints on the advice of the prime minister. The governor-general can exercise the Crown's prerogative powers, such as reviewing cases of injustice and making appointments of ministers, ambassadors, and other key public officials. The powers of the monarch and the governor-general are limited by constitutional constraints, and they cannot normally be exercised without the advice of ministers.\n\n**Regions and External Territories**\n\nThe early European settlers divided New Zealand into provinces, which had a degree of autonomy. Because of financial pressures and the desire to consolidate railways, education, land sales, and other policies, government was centralized, and the provinces were abolished in 1876. The provinces are remembered in regional public holidays and sporting rivalries.\n\n**Foreign Relations**\n\nDuring the period of the New Zealand colony, Britain was responsible for external trade and foreign relations. The 1923 and 1926 Imperial Conferences decided that New Zealand should be allowed to negotiate its own political treaties, and the first commercial treaty was ratified in 1928 with Japan. On 3 September 1939, New Zealand allied itself with Britain and declared war on Germany with Prime Minister Michael Joseph Savage proclaiming, \"Where she goes, we go; where she stands, we stand.\"\n\n**Military**\n\nNew Zealand's military services, the New Zealand Defence Force, comprise the New Zealand Army, the Royal New Zealand Air Force, and the Royal New Zealand Navy. New Zealand's national defence needs are modest since a direct attack is unlikely. However, its military has had a global presence, with notable campaigns in Gallipoli, Crete, El Alamein, and Cassino. The Gallipoli campaign played an important part in fostering New Zealand's national identity and strengthened the ANZAC tradition it shares with Australia.\n\n**Economy**\n\nNew Zealand has an advanced market economy, ranked 13th in the Human Development Index and fourth in the Index of Economic Freedom. It is a high-income economy with a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of US$36,254. The currency is the New Zealand dollar, informally known as the \"Kiwi dollar,\" and it also circulates in the Cook Islands, Niue, Tokelau, and the Pitcairn Islands. New Zealand is heavily dependent on international trade, with exports accounting for 24% of its output.\n\n**Infrastructure**\n\nIn 2015, renewable energy generated 40.1% of New Zealand's gross energy supply. The majority of the country's electricity supply is generated from hydroelectric power, with major schemes on the Waikato, Waitaki, and Clutha/Mata-Au rivers, as well as at Manapouri. Geothermal power is also a significant generator of electricity, with several large stations located across the Taupō Volcanic Zone in the North Island. State-owned Transpower operates the high-voltage transmission grids in the North and South Islands, as well as the Inter-Island HVDC link connecting the two together.\n\n**Science and Technology**\n\nEarly indigenous contribution to science in New Zealand was by Māori tohunga accumulating knowledge of agricultural practice and the effects of herbal remedies in the treatment of illness and disease. Cook's voyages in the 1700s and Darwin's in 1835 had important scientific botanical and zoological objectives. The establishment of universities in the 19th century fostered scientific discoveries by notable New Zealanders, including Ernest Rutherford for splitting the atom, William Pickering for rocket science, Maurice Wilkins for helping discover DNA, Beatrice Tinsley for galaxy formation, Archibald MacDiarmid for conducting polymers, and Alan MacDiarmid for conducting polymers.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nThe 2023 New Zealand census enumerated a resident population of 4,993,923, an increase of 6.3% over the 2018 census figure. As of November 2024, the total population has risen to an estimated 5,428,380. New Zealand's population increased at a rate of 1.9% per year in the seven years ended June 2020. In September 2020, Statistics New Zealand reported that the population had climbed above 5 million people in September 2019, according to population estimates based on the 2018 census.\n\n**Ethnicity and Immigration**\n\nIn the 2023 census, 67.8% of New Zealand residents identified ethnically as European, and 17.8% as Māori. Other major ethnic groups include Asian (17.3%) and Pacific peoples (8.9%). The population has become more multicultural and diverse in recent decades, with 92% of the population being European and 7% Māori in 1961.\n\n**Language**\n\nEnglish is the predominant language in New Zealand, spoken by 95.4% of the population. New Zealand English is a variety of the language with a distinctive accent and lexicon. It is similar to Australian English, and many speakers from the Northern Hemisphere are unable to tell the accents apart.\n\n**Religion**\n\nAt the 2023 census, 51.6% of the population stated they had no religion, up from 48.2% in the 2018 census. As the largest religious minority, Christians formed 32.3% of the population, compared to 36.5% in the 2018 census. Hindus are the second-largest religious minority, forming 2.9% of the population, followed by Muslims on 1.5%.\n\n**Education**\n\nPrimary and secondary schooling is compulsory for children aged 6 to 16, with the majority of children attending from the age of 5. There are 13 school years, and attending state (public) schools is free to New Zealand citizens and permanent residents from a person's 5th birthday to the end of the calendar year following their 19th birthday. New Zealand has an adult literacy rate of 99%, and over half of the population aged 15 to 29 hold a tertiary qualification.\n\n**Culture**\n\nEarly Māori adapted the tropically based east Polynesian culture in line with the challenges associated with a larger and more diverse environment, eventually developing their own distinctive culture. Social organization was largely communal with families (whānau), sub-tribes (hapū), and tribes (iwi) ruled by a chief (rangatira), whose position was subject to the community's approval.\n\n**Art**\n\nAs part of the resurgence of Māori culture, the traditional crafts of carving and weaving are now more widely practised, and Māori artists are increasing in number and influence. Most Māori carvings feature human figures, generally with three fingers and either a natural-looking, detailed head or a stylized version. Surface patterns consisting of spirals, ridges, notches, and fish scales decorate most carvings.\n\n**Literature**\n\nMāori quickly adopted writing as a means of sharing ideas, and many of their oral stories and poems were converted to the written form. Most early English literature was obtained from Britain, and it was not until the 1950s that local publishing outlets increased, allowing New Zealand literature to start becoming widely known.\n\n**Media and Entertainment**\n\nNew Zealand music has been influenced by blues, jazz, country, rock and roll, and hip hop, with many of these genres given a unique New Zealand interpretation. Māori developed a varied musical tradition around songs and chants, including ceremonial performances, laments, and love songs. Instruments (taonga pūoro), such as flutes and percussion, began being used as spiritual tools, entertainment, and signalling devices.\n\n**Cuisine**\n\nThe national cuisine has been described as Pacific Rim, incorporating the native Māori cuisine and diverse culinary traditions introduced by settlers and immigrants from Europe, Polynesia, and Asia. Distinctive ingredients or dishes include lamb, salmon, kōura (crayfish), Bluff oysters, whitebait, pāua (abalone), mussels, scallops, pipi, and tuatua (types of New Zealand shellfish).\n\n**Sport**\n\nMost of the major sporting codes played in New Zealand have British origins. Rugby union is considered the national sport and attracts the most spectators. Golf, netball, tennis, and cricket have the highest rates of adult participation, while netball, rugby union, and football (soccer) are particularly popular among young people.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"New_Zealand\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe first European visitor to New Zealand, Dutch explorer Abel Tasman, named the islands Staten Land, believing they were part of the Staten Landt that Jacob Le Maire had sighted off the southern end of South America [17] [18] Hendrik Brouwer proved that the South American land was a small island in 1643, and Dutch cartographers subsequently renamed Tasman's discovery Nova Zeelandia from Latin, after the Dutch province of Zeeland [17] [19] This name was later anglicised to New Zealand [20] [21]\n\n\nHistory\nThe first people to reach New Zealand were Polynesians in ocean going waka (canoes) Their arrival likely occurred in several waves, approximately between 1280 and 1350 CE Those Polynesian settlers, isolated in New Zealand, became the Māori of later years According to an early European synthesized interpretation of various Māori traditional accounts, around 750 CE the heroic explorer, Kupe, had discovered New Zealand and later, around 1350, one great fleet of settlers set out from Hawaiki in eastern Polynesia [35] However, from the late 20th century, this story has been increasingly relegated to the realm of legend and myth An alternative view has emerged from fresh archaeological and scientific evidence, which correlates with doubts raised by historians everywhere as to the reliability of interpretations drawn from the oral evidence of indigenous peoples, including from Māori [36]\n\n\nGeography and environment\nNew Zealand is located near the centre of the water hemisphere and is made up of two main islands and more than 700 smaller islands [92] The two main islands (the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Māui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamu) are separated by Cook Strait, 22 kilometres (14 mi) wide at its narrowest point [93] Besides the North and South Islands, the five largest inhabited islands are Stewart Island (across the Foveaux Strait), Chatham Island, Great Barrier Island (in the Hauraki Gulf), [94] D'Urville Island (in the Marlborough Sounds) [95] and Waiheke Island (about 22 km (14 mi) from central Auckland) [96]\n\n\nClimate\nNew Zealand's climate is predominantly temperate maritime (Köppen: Cfb), with mean annual temperatures ranging from 10 °C (50 °F) in the south to 16 °C (61 °F) in the north [113] Historical maxima and minima are 42.4 °C (108.32 °F) in Rangiora, Canterbury and −25.6 °C (−14.08 °F) in Ranfurly, Otago [114] Conditions vary sharply across regions from extremely wet on the West Coast of the South Island to semi-arid in Central Otago and the Mackenzie Basin of inland Canterbury and subtropical in Northland [115] [116] Of the seven largest cities, Christchurch is the driest, receiving on average only 618 millimetres (24.3 in) of rain per year and Wellington the wettest, receiving almost twice that amount [117] Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch all receive a yearly average of more than 2,000 hours of sunshine The southern and southwestern parts of the South Island have a cooler and cloudier climate, with around 1,400–1,600 hours;

wood was the second largest earner (7%) [273] New Zealand's main trading partners, as at June 2018 [update], are China (NZ$27.8b), Australia ($26.2b), the European Union ($22.9b), the United States ($17.6b), and Japan ($8.4b) [274] On 7 April 2008, New Zealand and China signed the New Zealand–China Free Trade Agreement, the first such agreement China has signed with a developed country [275] In July 2023, New Zealand and the European Union entered into the EU–New Zealand Free Trade Agreement, which eliminated tariffs on several goods traded between the two regions [276] This free trade agreement expanded on the pre-existing free trade agreement [277] and saw a reduction in tariffs on meat and dairy [278] in response to feedback from the affected industries [279]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nIn 2015, renewable energy generated 40.1% of New Zealand's gross energy supply [289] The majority of the country's electricity supply is generated from hydroelectric power, with major schemes on the Waikato, Waitaki and Clutha / Mata-Au rivers, as well as at Manapouri Geothermal power is also a significant generator of electricity, with several large stations located across the Taupō Volcanic Zone in the North Island The four main companies in the generation and retail market are Contact Energy, Genesis Energy, Mercury Energy and Meridian Energy State-owned Transpower operates the high-voltage transmission grids in the North and South Islands, as well as the Inter-Island HVDC link connecting the two together [289]\n\n\nScience and technology\nEarly indigenous contribution to science in New Zealand was by Māori tohunga accumulating knowledge of agricultural practice and the effects of herbal remedies in the treatment of illness and disease [302] Cook's voyages in the 1700s and Darwin's in 1835 had important scientific botanical and zoological objectives [303] The establishment of universities in the 19th century fostered scientific discoveries by notable New Zealanders including Ernest Rutherford for splitting the atom, William Pickering for rocket science, Maurice Wilkins for helping discover DNA, Beatrice Tinsley for galaxy formation, Archibald McIndoe for plastic surgery, and Alan MacDiarmid for conducting polymers [304]\n\n\nDemographics\nThe 2023 New Zealand census enumerated a resident population of 4,993,923, an increase of 6.3% over the 2018 census figure [4] As of November 2024, the total population has risen to an estimated 5,428,380 [9] New Zealand's population increased at a rate of 1.9% per year in the seven years ended June 2020 In September 2020 Statistics New Zealand reported that the population had climbed above 5 million people in September 2019, according to population estimates based on the 2018 census [309] [n 9]\n\n\nEthnicity and immigration\nIn the 2023 census, 67.8% of New Zealand residents identified ethnically as European, and 17.8% as Māori Other major ethnic groups include Asian (17.3%) and Pacific peoples (8.9%) [n 3] [4] The population has become more multicultural and diverse in recent decades: in 1961, the census reported that the population of New Zealand was 92% European and 7% Māori, with Asian and Pacific minorities sharing the remaining 1% [321] However, New Zealand's non-European population is disproportionately concentrated in the North Island and especially in the Auckland region: while Auckland is home to 33% of New Zealand's population, it is home to 62% of the country's Pasifika population and 60% of its Asian population [4]\n\n\nLanguage\nEnglish is the predominant language in New Zealand, spoken by 95.4% of the population [335] New Zealand English is a variety of the language with a distinctive accent and lexicon [336] It is similar to Australian English, and many speakers from the Northern Hemisphere are unable to tell the accents apart [337] The most prominent differences between the New Zealand English dialect and other English dialects are the shifts in the short front vowels: the short-i sound (as in kit) has centralised towards the schwa sound (the a in comma and about); the short-e sound (as in dress) has moved towards the short-i sound; and the short-a sound (as in trap) has moved to the short-e sound [338]\n\n\nReligion\nAt the 2023 census, 51.6% of population stated they had no religion, [350] up from 48.2% in 2018 census [335] As the largest religious minority as per the census, the Christians forming 32.3% of the population, [350] compared to 36.5% in 2018 [335] Hindus are the second largest religious minority, forming the 2.9% of population, followed by Muslims on 1.5% [350] The Auckland Region exhibited the greatest religious diversity [351]\n\n\nEducation\nPrimary and secondary schooling is compulsory for children aged 6 to 16, with the majority of children attending from the age of 5 [352] There are 13 school years and attending state (public) schools is free to New Zealand citizens and permanent residents from a person's 5th birthday to the end of the calendar year following their 19th birthday [353] New Zealand has an adult literacy rate of 99%, [98] and over half of the population aged 15 to 29 hold a tertiary qualification [352] There are five types of government-owned tertiary institutions: universities, colleges of education, polytechnics, specialist colleges, and wānanga, [354] in addition to private training establishments [355] In 2021, in the population aged 25–64; 13% had no formal qualification, 21% had a school qualification, 28% had a tertiary certificate or diploma, and 35% have a bachelor's degree or higher [356] The OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment ranks New Zealand as the 28th best in the OECD for maths, 13th best for science, and 11th best for reading [357]\n\n\nCulture\nEarly Māori adapted the tropically based east Polynesian culture in line with the challenges associated with a larger and more diverse environment, eventually developing their own distinctive culture Social organisation was largely communal with families (whānau), subtribes (hapū) and tribes (iwi) ruled by a chief (rangatira), whose position was subject to the community's approval [358] The British and Irish immigrants brought aspects of their own culture to New Zealand and also influenced Māori culture, [359] [360] particularly with the introduction of Christianity [361] However, Māori still regard their allegiance to tribal groups as a vital part of their identity, and Māori kinship roles resemble those of other Polynesian peoples [362] More recently, American, Australian, Asian and other European cultures have exerted influence on New Zealand Non-Māori Polynesian cultures are also apparent, with Pasifika, the world's largest Polynesian festival, now an annual event in Auckland [363]\n\n\nArt\nAs part of the resurgence of Māori culture, the traditional crafts of carving and weaving are now more widely practised, and Māori artists are increasing in number and influence [371] Most Māori carvings feature human figures, generally with three fingers and either a natural-looking, detailed head or a stylised version [372] Surface patterns consisting of spirals, ridges, notches and fish scales decorate most carvings [373] The pre-eminent Māori architecture consisted of carved meeting houses (wharenui) decorated with symbolic carvings and illustrations These buildings were originally designed to be constantly rebuilt, changing and adapting to different whims or needs [374]\n\n\nLiterature\nMāori quickly adopted writing as a means of sharing ideas, and many of their oral stories and poems were converted to the written form [386] Most early English literature was obtained from Britain, and it was not until the 1950s when local publishing outlets increased that New Zealand literature started to become widely known [387] Although still largely influenced by global trends (modernism) and events (the Great Depression), writers in the 1930s began to develop stories increasingly focused on their experiences in New Zealand During this period, literature changed from a journalistic activity to a more academic pursuit [388] Participation in the world wars gave some New Zealand writers a new perspective on New Zealand culture and with the post-war expansion of universities local literature flourished [389] Dunedin is a UNESCO City of Literature [390]\n\n\nMedia and entertainment\nNew Zealand music has been influenced by blues, jazz, country, rock and roll and hip hop, with many of these genres given a unique New Zealand interpretation [391] Māori developed a varied musical tradition around songs and chants, including ceremonial performances, laments, and love songs [392] Instruments (taonga pūoro), such as flutes and percussion, began being used as spiritual tools, entertainment, and signalling devices [393] [394] Early settlers brought over their ethnic music, with brass bands and choral music being popular, and musicians began touring New Zealand in the 1860s [395] [396] Pipe bands became widespread during the early 20th century [397] The New Zealand recording industry began to develop from 1940 onwards, and many New Zealand musicians have obtained success in Britain and the United States [391] Some artists release Māori language songs, and the Māori tradition-based art of kapa haka (song and dance) has made a resurgence [398] The New Zealand Music Awards are held annually by Recorded Music NZ; the awards were first held in 1965 by Reckitt & Colman as the Loxene Golden Disc awards [399] Recorded Music NZ also publishes the country's official weekly record charts [400]\n\n\nCuisine\nThe national cuisine has been described as Pacific Rim, incorporating the native Māori cuisine and diverse culinary traditions introduced by settlers and immigrants from Europe, Polynesia, and Asia [413] New Zealand yields produce from land and sea—most crops and livestock, such as maize, potatoes and pigs, were gradually introduced by the early European settlers [414] Distinctive ingredients or dishes include lamb, salmon, kōura (crayfish), [415] Bluff oysters, whitebait, pāua (abalone), mussels, scallops, pipi and tuatua (types of New Zealand shellfish), [416] kūmara (sweet potato), kiwifruit, tamarillo, and pavlova (considered a national dessert) [417] [413] A hāngī is a traditional Māori method of cooking food using heated rocks buried in a pit oven; still used for large groups on special occasions, [418] such as tangihanga [419]\n\n\nSport\nMost of the major sporting codes played in New Zealand have British origins [420] Rugby union is considered the national sport [421] and attracts the most spectators [422] Golf, netball, tennis and cricket have the highest rates of adult participation, while netball, rugby union and football (soccer) are particularly popular among young people [422] [423] Horse racing is one of the most popular spectator sports in New Zealand and was part of the \"rugby, racing, and beer\" subculture during the 1960s [424] Around 54% of New Zealand adolescents participate in sports for their school [423] Victorious rugby tours to Australia and the United Kingdom in the late 1880s and the early 1900s played an early role in instilling a national identity [425] Māori participation in European sports was particularly evident in rugby, and the country's team performs a haka, a traditional Māori challenge, before international matches [426] New Zealand is known for its extreme sports, adventure tourism [427] and strong mountaineering tradition, as seen in the success of notable New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary [428] [429] Other outdoor pursuits such as cycling, fishing, swimming, running, tramping, canoeing, hunting, snowsports, surfing and sailing are also popular [430] New Zealand has seen regular sailing success in the America's Cup regatta since 1995 [431] The Polynesian sport of waka ama racing has experienced a resurgence of interest in New Zealand since the 1980s [432]\n\n\nSee also\nGovernment\n\n\nNotes\nGovernment\n\n\nReferences\nGovernment\n\n\nCitations\nGovernment\n\n\nFurther reading\nGovernment\n\n\nExternal links\nGovernment\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born on June 27, 1880, in Tuscumbia, Alabama, Keller's life was marked by courage, determination, and a passion for learning.\n\n**Early Childhood and Illness**\n\nKeller was born to Arthur Henley Keller and Catherine Everett Keller, a family of modest means. Her early life was marked by a series of illnesses, including scarlet fever and meningitis, which left her deaf and blind by the age of two. Despite her disability, Keller's parents encouraged her to communicate and explore her surroundings through touch and sensation.\n\n**Formal Education**\n\nIn May 1888, Keller started attending the Perkins Institute for the Blind, where she began to learn through a combination of touch and visual aids. In 1893, Keller, along with her instructor Anne Sullivan, attended the William Wade House and Finishing School, where Keller learned to communicate through a system of hand-over-hand signing. The two women then moved to New York to attend the Wright-Humason School for the Deaf, where Keller learned to read and write through a combination of Braille and tactile sign language.\n\n**Companions**\n\nAnne Sullivan remained Keller's companion and instructor throughout her life, teaching her to communicate and navigate the world around her. Sullivan married John Macy in 1905, but her health began to decline around 1914. Keller then hired Polly Thomson, a young woman from Scotland, to keep house and assist her. Thomson eventually became a constant companion to Keller, serving as her secretary and confidante.\n\n**Career, Writing, and Political Activities**\n\nKeller's writing career spanned over three decades, during which she published 12 books and numerous articles. Her writing often focused on disability rights, education, and social justice. In 1904, Keller graduated from Radcliffe College, becoming the first deafblind person to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree. She maintained a correspondence with the Austrian philosopher and pedagogue Wilhelm Jerusalem, who recognized her literary talent.\n\nKeller's writings often reflected her experiences as a deafblind person, advocating for the rights of people with disabilities. Her most famous work, \"The Song of the Stone Wall,\" explores the themes of oppression, freedom, and the struggle for equality. Keller's activism extended beyond her writing, as she traveled the world giving lectures and speeches on human rights and disability rights.\n\n**Archival Material**\n\nThe Helen Keller Archives in New York are owned by the American Foundation for the Blind. Unfortunately, archival material of Keller stored in New York was lost when the Twin Towers were destroyed in the September 11 attacks.\n\n**Later Life and Death**\n\nKeller suffered a series of strokes in 1961, which left her partially paralyzed. She spent the last years of her life at her home in Easton, Connecticut, surrounded by her family and loved ones. Keller passed away on June 1, 1968, at the age of 87.\n\n**Portrayals**\n\nKeller's life has been interpreted in numerous films, plays, and books. Her story was told in a silent film, \"Deliverance,\" which premiered in 1919. The film was a melodramatic and allegorical retelling of Keller's story, highlighting her courage and determination.\n\n**Posthumous Honors**\n\nIn 1999, Keller was listed in Gallup's Most Widely Admired People of the 20th century. Her legacy continues to inspire people around the world, as a symbol of courage, resilience, and the power of the human spirit.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Anne Sullivan\n* Polly Thomson\n* American Foundation for the Blind\n* Perkins Institute for the Blind\n* Radcliffe College\n* Disability Rights Movement\n\n**Further Reading**\n\n* Keller, H.

announced that the second installment was \"on the way\" [5] On March 3, French Montana announced his involvement and shared a clip of himself with the duo in the recording studio [6] After Vultures 2 had not met its scheduled release five days later, West explained that he and Ty Dolla Sign were still recording in the studio [7] [8]\n\n\nMusic and themes\nVultures 2 is a hip hop, R&B, house, and trap album, [23] incorporating avant-garde [18] It features a raw style, including prominent synths [23] Multiple publications noted the album's unfinished sound, [24] comparing its songs to demotapes [25] [26] The instrumentation at the start of Vultures 2 invokes the Deep Note of THX that is also used at the beginning of rapper and record producer Dr Dre's 2001 (1999); Kanye West previously stated the album's track \"Xxplosive\" influenced his sound [23] [27]\n\n\nSongs\nThe album's opening track, \"Slide\", begins with a cinematic sound that combines a booming percussion section with organs, [24] alongside THX synths [23] Ty Dolla Sign performs first on the song as he delivers smooth soulful vocals, [26] while West stands defiant in the face of industry opposition in a villainous tone [25] [27] Resembling Donda 2 track \"Flowers\", [23] [29] \"Time Moving Slow\" features drum kicks and West declaring \"I rewrote my ending\" [18] [26] \"Field Trip\" is based on a sample of the piano from Portishead's \"Machine Gun\" (2008), [26] [28] which is combined with Kodak Black's vocals [24] The guest rappers have more vocals than West on the song, including fast rapping from Playboi Carti [18] \"Fried\" relies on chants that invoke Vultures 1 single \"Carnival\", [23] [24] [27] with lyrics from West threatening people who consider becoming opposed to him and Ty Dolla Sign comparing himself to deceased rapper Tupac Shakur [18] The interlude \"Isabella\" follows, consisting of a rock sample [18] [23] \"Promotion\" contains synth tones and drum sounds, [23] alongside a lyrical reference from West to his 2007 single \"Good Life\" [18] [27] An introspective number, \"530\" features West lamenting over his relationship with ex wife, Kim Kardashian [25] [28] \"Dead\" includes booming drums and synth tones, [23] with lyrics from West reflecting on a former lover after fellow rapper Future's verse [18] [27] Future's voice is sequenced and he raps about his involvement with an Instagram model, while Ty Dolla Sign identifies himself as \"the new  [Hugh] Hef\" and rapper Lil Durk engages in a call and response with the singer and West [18] [26] \"Forever Rolling\" incorporates clattering drums in its grand production, [30] opening with a verse from West calling out companies that parted ways with him Lil Baby and Ty Dolla Sign deliver lines back and forth, [18] focusing on staying together and making the most of life [26]\n\n\nRelease and promotion\nWest shared the cover art for the album through his Twitter account on March 9, 2024, showing a masked figure standing in all-black outfit The figure on the cover was revealed to be Ty Dolla Sign and he holds a photo of Big TC, who has the real name of Jabreal Muhammad and has been given a 16-year prison sentence under for a murder that they both insist he did not commit [32] [33] On March 10, 2024, in a conversation with a fan page, West mentioned that he would be selling Vultures 2 on his Yeezy website for $20 instead of releasing it on streaming platforms like Vultures 1 West thought streaming devalues music and is \"basically pirating\", offering that he could reach one million

The album was released on February 25, 2024, following the successful debut of Vultures 1, which reached number one on the US Billboard 200.\n\n## Background and Recording\n\nThe recording process for Vultures 2 began in 2016 and continued on and off until 2024. On January 23, 2024, West revealed that he would be releasing a Vultures series as a trilogy with Ty Dolla Sign, with the first set for release in February, the second on March 8, and the final on April 5. Vultures 1 was released after a slight delay as the first installment of the series on February 10, 2024, reaching number one on the US Billboard 200 and experiencing worldwide chart success. On February 25, 2024, Timbaland, who worked on the album, announced that the second installment was \"on the way.\" On March 3, French Montana announced his involvement and shared a clip of himself with the duo in the recording studio. After Vultures 2 had not met its scheduled release five days later, West explained that he and Ty Dolla Sign were still recording in the studio.\n\n## Music and Themes\n\nVultures 2 is a hip hop, R&B, house, and trap album, incorporating avant-garde elements. It features a raw style, including prominent synths. Multiple publications noted the album's unfinished sound, comparing its songs to demotapes. The instrumentation at the start of Vultures 2 invokes the Deep Note of THX that is also used at the beginning of rapper and record producer Dr. Dre's 2001 (1999); Kanye West previously stated the album's track \"Xxplosive\" influenced his sound.\n\n## Songs\n\nThe album's opening track, \"Slide,\" begins with a cinematic sound that combines a booming percussion section with organs, alongside THX synths. Ty Dolla Sign performs first on the song as he delivers smooth soulful vocals, while West stands defiant in the face of industry opposition in a villainous tone. Resembling Donda 2 track \"Flowers,\" \"Time Moving Slow\" features drum kicks and West declaring \"I rewrote my ending.\" \"Field Trip\" is based on a sample of the piano from Portishead's \"Machine Gun\" (2008), which is combined with Kodak Black's vocals. The guest rappers have more vocals than West on the song, including fast rapping from Playboi Carti. \"Fried\" relies on chants that invoke Vultures 1 single \"Carnival,\" with lyrics from West threatening people who consider becoming opposed to him and Ty Dolla Sign comparing himself to deceased rapper Tupac Shakur. The interlude \"Isabella\" follows, consisting of a rock sample. \"Promotion\" contains synth tones and drum sounds, alongside a lyrical reference from West to his 2007 single \"Good Life.\" An introspective number, \"530\" features West lamenting over his relationship with ex-wife Kim Kardashian. \"Dead\" includes booming drums and synth tones, with lyrics from West reflecting on a former lover after fellow rapper Future's verse. Future's voice is sequenced and he raps about his involvement with an Instagram model, while Ty Dolla Sign identifies himself as \"the new Hugh Hef\" and rapper Lil Durk engages in a call and response with the singer and West. \"Forever Rolling\" incorporates clattering drums in its grand production, opening with a verse from West calling out companies that parted ways with him. Lil Baby and Ty Dolla Sign deliver lines back and forth, focusing on staying together and making the most of life.\n\n## Release and Promotion\n\nWest shared the cover art for the album through his Twitter account on March 9, 2024, showing a masked figure standing in an all-black outfit. The figure on the cover was revealed to be Ty Dolla Sign, who holds a photo of Big TC, who has the real name of Jabreal Muhammad and has been given a 16-year prison sentence under for a murder that they both insist he did not commit. On March 10, 2024, in a conversation with a fan page, West mentioned that he would be selling Vultures 2 on his Yeezy website for $20 instead of releasing it on streaming platforms like Vultures 1. West thought streaming devalues music and is \"basically pirating,\" offering that he could reach one million album sales from five percent of his then-20 million Instagram followers. He said the decision was made to stop streaming companies being \"in control of the artist\" and Ty Dolla Sign echoed West's views in spite of requests for the album to be streamed, declaring the release went against \"what these streaming services want u to to [sic] believe so they can stay on top.\"\n\n## Post-release updates\n\nAfter fans complained about the mixing on Vultures 2 following its release, West announced that updates \"will be published in real time,\" with no specified conclusion to potential revisions to the songs.

On August 16, 2024, \"Forever,\" originally titled \"Maybe,\" had a new verse added. The verse sees West discussing the value of time on Earth, with its first part being taken from the original version.\n\n## Listening events\n\nDuring the listening events for Vultures 2, West and Ty Dolla Sign dressed in all-black outfits and wore masks, with the rapper wearing a hockey mask.

{"title": "Paul_Simon", "content": "\nEarly life\nSimon was born on October 13, 1941, in Newark, New Jersey, to Hungarian-Jewish parents [3] [4] [5] His father, Louis (1916–1995), a professor of education at the City College of New York, [6] was a double-bass player and dance bandleader who performed under the name Lee Sims His mother, Belle (1910–2007), was an elementary-school teacher In 1945, his family moved to the Kew Gardens Hills section of Flushing, Queens, in New York City [7]\n\n\nCareer\nBetween 1957 and 1964, Simon wrote, recorded and released more than 30 songs He and Garfunkel occasionally reunited as Tom & Jerry to record singles, including \"Our Song\" and \"That's My Story\" Most of the songs Simon recorded during that time he performed alone, or with musicians other than Garfunkel They were released on minor record labels including Amy, Big, Hunt, King, Tribute and Madison Simon used several pseudonyms for these recordings, usually \"Jerry Landis\", but also \"Paul Kane\" and \"True Taylor\" By 1962, working as Jerry Landis, he was a frequent writer/producer for several Amy Records artists, overseeing material released by Dotty Daniels, The Vels and Ritchie Cordell.\n\n\n1960s: Simon & Garfunkel\nIn early 1964, Simon and Garfunkel auditioned for Columbia Records, whose executive Clive Davis signed them to produce an album Columbia decided to call them Simon & Garfunkel instead of Tom & Jerry, and according to Simon, this was the first time artists' surnames had been used in pop music without their first names [14] Simon and Garfunkel's first LP, Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M., was released on October 19, 1964 It consisted of 12 songs, five of which were written by Simon The album initially flopped [15]\n\n\n1970–1976: Solo and Still Crazy After All These Years\nIn 1970, Simon taught songwriting at New York University He said he had wanted to teach for a while, and hoped to help people avoid some of the mistakes he had made: \"You can teach somebody about writing songs You can't teach someone how to write a song .. I'd go to a course if the Beatles would talk about how they made records because I'm sure I could learn something.\" [15]\n\n\n1977–1985: One-Trick Pony and Hearts and Bones\nAfter releasing three successful studio albums, Simon worked in the second half of the 1970s on various projects, including writing music for the film Shampoo, which became the music for the song \"Silent Eyes\" on the Still Crazy album, and acting (he was cast as Tony Lacey in Woody Allen's film Annie Hall) He achieved another hit with \"Slip Slidin' Away\", the lead single of his 1977 compilation Greatest Hits, Etc.,  which reached number 5 in the United States.\n\n\n1986–1992: Graceland and The Rhythm of the Saints\nIn 1986, Simon was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Music degree from Berklee College of Music,

Simon 1964/1993 Originally a three-disc compilation, this became a reduced version on the two-disc album The Paul Simon Anthology one month later In 1995, Simon appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show and performed the song \"Ten Years\", which he had composed for the tenth anniversary of the show In 1995 he also featured in the Annie Lennox version of his 1973 song \"Something So Right\", which appeared briefly on the UK Top 50 after it was released as a single [49]\n\n\n1999–2007: You're the One and Surprise\nAfter The Capeman, Simon's career was in an unexpected crisis, but he continued to record new material In 1999, he embarked on a three-month North American tour with Bob Dylan, in which he and Dylan alternated as the headline act with a middle section where they performed together The collaboration was generally well-received, with just one critic, Seth Rogovoy of the Berkshire Eagle, questioning the collaboration [51]\n\n\n2008–2013: So Beautiful or So What and touring\nAfter living in Montauk, New York, for many years, Simon relocated to New Canaan, Connecticut [56]\n\n\n2014–2022: Stranger to Stranger and In the Blue Light\nIn 2014, Simon embarked on a joint 21-date concert tour of North America, titled On Stage Together, with English musician Sting [71] The tour continued in 2015 with ten shows in Australia and New Zealand [72] [73] and 23 concerts in Europe [74]\n\n\n2023–present: Seven Psalms\nSimon released a new album, Seven Psalms, in April 2023 A documentary of the project, In Restless Dreams: The Music of Paul Simon, was made by Alex Gibney [88] The album was described as 33 minutes of uninterrupted musical meditation, consisting of seven pieces performed on acoustic guitar, linked by a motif derived from \"Anji\", with elements of folk, blues and jazz, and with lyrics that reflected on life, death and faith [17] The inspiration for the album came to Simon in 2020 He recalled, \"I had a dream so vivid it made me get up in the middle of the night and write it down .. a voice said 'You are meant to be working on a piece called 'Seven Psalms'.\" [17]\n\n\nSongwriting\nIn 2012, in an interview reprinted in American Songwriter, Simon discussed the craft of songwriting with music journalist Tom Moon and talked about the basic themes in his songwriting: love, family and social commentary, as well as messages of religion, spirituality and God Simon explained how he wrote his songs \"The music always precedes the words The words often come from the sound of the music and eventually evolve into coherent thoughts Or incoherent thoughts Rhythm plays a crucial part in the lyric-making as well It's like a puzzle to find the right words to express what the music is saying.\" [90]\n\n\nProjects\nIn the late 1990s, Simon wrote and produced a Broadway musical called The Capeman, which lost $11 million during its 1998 run In April 2008, the Brooklyn Academy of Music celebrated Paul Simon's works, and dedicated a

American singer, songwriter, musician, and record producer. Born on October 13, 1941, in Newark, New Jersey, to Hungarian-Jewish parents, Simon's early life and career have been marked by an incredible range of creativity and innovation.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nSimon was born to Louis (1916–1995), a double-bass player and dance bandleader, and Belle (1910–2007), an elementary-school teacher. His family moved to the Kew Gardens Hills section of Flushing, Queens, in New York City in 1945. Simon's early life was influenced by his parents' love of music, and he began playing the guitar and writing songs as a teenager. He attended Queens College, where he met his future songwriting partner, Art Garfunkel.\n\n**Career**\n\nBetween 1957 and 1964, Simon wrote, recorded, and released more than 30 songs. He and Garfunkel occasionally reunited as Tom & Jerry to record singles, including \"Our Song\" and \"That's My Story.\" Most of the songs Simon recorded during that time he performed alone, or with musicians other than Garfunkel. They were released on minor record labels, including Amy, Big, Hunt, King, Tribute, and Madison. Simon used several pseudonyms for these recordings, usually \"Jerry Landis,\" but also \"Paul Kane\" and \"True Taylor.\" By 1962, working as Jerry Landis, he was a frequent writer/producer for several Amy Records artists, overseeing material released by Dotty Daniels, The Vels, and Ritchie Cordell.\n\n**1960s: Simon & Garfunkel**\n\nIn early 1964, Simon and Garfunkel auditioned for Columbia Records, whose executive Clive Davis signed them to produce an album. Columbia decided to call them Simon & Garfunkel instead of Tom & Jerry, and according to Simon, this was the first time artists' surnames had been used in pop music without their first names. Simon and Garfunkel's first LP, Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M., was released on October 19, 1964. It consisted of 12 songs, five of which were written by Simon. The album initially flopped.\n\n**1970–1976: Solo and Still Crazy After All These Years**\n\nIn 1970, Simon taught songwriting at New York University. He said he had wanted to teach for a while, and hoped to help people avoid some of the mistakes he had made: \"You can teach somebody about writing songs. You can't teach someone how to write a song.. I'd go to a course if the Beatles would talk about how they made records because I'm sure I could learn something.\" In 1975, Simon released the album Still Crazy After All These Years, which won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1976.\n\n**1977–1985: One-Trick Pony and Hearts and Bones**\n\nAfter releasing three successful studio albums, Simon worked in the second half of the 1970s on various projects, including writing music for the film Shampoo, which became the music for the song \"Silent Eyes\" on the Still Crazy album, and acting (he was cast as Tony Lacey in Woody Allen's film Annie Hall). He achieved another hit with \"Slip Slidin' Away,\" the lead single of his 1977 compilation Greatest Hits, Etc., which reached number 5 in the United States.\n\n**1986–1992: Graceland and The Rhythm of the Saints**\n\nIn 1986, Simon was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Music degree from Berklee College of Music, where he had served on the board of trustees. He released the album Graceland in 1986, which won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1988.\n\n**1993–1998: Paul Simon 1964/1993 and The Capeman**\n\nAnother Simon & Garfunkel reunion took place in September 1993, and Columbia released Paul Simon 1964/1993. Originally a three-disc compilation, this became a reduced version on the two-disc album The Paul Simon Anthology one month later. In 1995, Simon appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show and performed the song \"Ten Years,\" which he had composed for the tenth anniversary of the show.\n\n**1999–2007: You're the One and Surprise**\n\nAfter The Capeman, Simon's career was in an unexpected crisis, but he continued to record new material. In 1999, he embarked on a three-month North American tour with Bob Dylan, in which he and Dylan alternated as the headline act with a middle section where they performed together.\n\n**2008–2013: So Beautiful or So What and touring**\n\nAfter living in Montauk, New York, for many years, Simon relocated to New Canaan, Connecticut.\n\n**2014–2022: Stranger to Stranger and In the Blue Light**\n\nIn 2014, Simon embarked on a joint 21-date concert tour of North America, titled On Stage Together, with English musician Sting. The tour continued in 2015 with ten shows in Australia and New Zealand and 23 concerts in Europe.\n\n**2023–present: Seven Psalms**\n\nSimon released a new album, Seven Psalms, in April 2023. A documentary of the project, In Restless Dreams: The Music of Paul Simon, was made by Alex Gibney. The album was described as 33 minutes of uninterrupted musical meditation, consisting of seven pieces performed on acoustic guitar, linked by a motif derived from \"Anji,\" with elements of folk, blues, and jazz, and with lyrics that reflected on life, death, and faith.\n\n**Songwriting**\n\nIn 2012, in an interview reprinted in American Songwriter, Simon discussed the craft of songwriting with music journalist Tom Moon and talked about the basic themes in his songwriting: love, family, and social commentary, as well as messages of religion, spirituality, and God. Simon explained how he wrote his songs: \"The music always precedes the words. The words often come from the sound of the music and eventually evolve into coherent thoughts Or incoherent thoughts. Rhythm plays a crucial part in the lyric-making as well. It's like a puzzle to find the right words to express what the music is saying.\"\n\n**Projects**\n\nIn the late 1990s, Simon wrote and produced a Broadway musical called The Capeman, which lost $11 million during its 1998 run. In April 2008, the Brooklyn Academy of Music celebrated Paul Simon's works, and dedicated a week to Songs From the Capeman, with some of the show's songs performed by a cast of singers and the Spanish Harlem Orchestra. Simon appeared during the BAM shows, performing \"Trailways Bus\" and \"Late in the Evening.\" In August 2010, The Capeman was staged for three nights in the Delacorte Theatre in New York's Central Park.\n\n**Music for Broadway**\n\nSimon wrote and produced a Broadway musical called The Capeman, which lost $11 million during its 1998 run.

He played music producer Tony Lacey, a supporting character in the 1977 Woody Allen feature film Annie Hall, and made a cameo appearance in the movie The Rutles: All You Need Is Cash the following year. He later wrote and starred in 1980's One Trick Pony as Jonah Levin, a journeyman rock-and-roller, and wrote all the songs in the film.\n\n**Saturday Night Live**\n\nSimon appeared on Saturday Night Live 14 times, both as host and as a musical guest.

{"title": "Navaratri", "content": "\nEtymology and nomenclature\nThe word Navaratri means \"nine nights\" in Sanskrit, nava meaning \"nine\" and ratri meaning \"nights\" [3]\n\n\nDates and celebrations\nIn the eastern and northeastern states of India, the Durga Puja [5] is synonymous with Navaratri, wherein goddess Durga battles and emerges victorious over the buffalo demon Mahishasura to help restore dharma [4] In southern states, the victory of Durga or Kali is celebrated In the western state of Gujarat, Navaratri celebrations are constituted by arti, followed by garba In all cases, the common theme is the battle and victory of good over evil based on a regionally famous epic or legend such as the Devi Mahatmya [2] [3]\n\n\nCelebrations\nCelebrations include worshipping nine goddesses during nine days, stage decorations, recital of the legend, enacting of the story, and chanting of the scriptures of Hinduism The nine days are also a major crop season cultural event, such as competitive design and staging of pandals, a family visit to these pandals, and the public celebration of classical and folk dances of Hindu culture [6] [7] [8] Hindu devotees often celebrate Navaratri by fasting On the final day, called Vijayadashami, the statues are either immersed in a water body such as a river or ocean, or the statue symbolising the evil is burnt with fireworks, marking the destruction of evil During this time preparations also take place for Deepavali (the festival of lights) which is celebrated twenty days after Vijayadashami [4] [9] [10]\n\n\nDates\nAccording to some Hindu texts such as the Shakta and Vaishnava Puranas, Navaratri theoretically falls two or four times in a year Of these, the Sharada Navaratri near the September

Hindus in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Sri Lanka for example, built Hindu temples in southeast Asia in the 19th century, and Navaratri has been one of their major traditional festivals. In Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Fiji, Mauritius, Canada, South Africa, the United States, and the United Kingdom, Navaratri and Diwali have been one of the most visible celebrations of the local Hindu communities from about mid 20th-century.\n\nOther Religions\n\nNavaratri and goddess worship is mentioned in the historic Sikhism literature, particularly in the Dasam Granth traditionally attributed to Guru Gobind Singh. According to Louis Fenech, the Sikhs have historically mirrored the reverence for Devi Shakti and the worship of weapons in a manner similar to those by Shakta Hindus. The second Guru of Sikhism, Guru Angad, was an ardent devotee of goddess Durga.\n\nIn conclusion, Navaratri is a significant festival in Hinduism, celebrated over nine nights in honor of the divine feminine, often associated with the goddess Durga. The festival has a rich history and cultural significance, with various traditions and customs observed across different regions in India and beyond.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Navaratri\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology and nomenclature\nThe word Navaratri means \"nine nights\" in Sanskrit, nava meaning \"nine\" and ratri meaning \"nights\" [3]\n\n\nDates and celebrations\nIn the eastern and northeastern states of India, the Durga Puja [5] is synonymous with Navaratri, wherein goddess Durga battles and emerges victorious over the buffalo demon Mahishasura to help restore dharma [4] In southern states, the victory of Durga or Kali is celebrated In the western state of Gujarat, Navaratri celebrations are constituted by arti, followed by garba In all cases, the common theme is the battle and victory of good over evil based on a regionally famous epic or legend such as the Devi Mahatmya [2] [3]\n\n\nCelebrations\nCelebrations include worshipping nine goddesses during nine days, stage decorations, recital of the legend, enacting of the story, and chanting of the scriptures of Hinduism The nine days are also a major crop season cultural event, such as competitive design and staging of pandals, a family visit to these pandals, and the public celebration of classical and folk dances of Hindu culture [6] [7] [8] Hindu devotees often celebrate Navaratri by fasting On the final day, called Vijayadashami, the statues are either immersed in a water body such as a river or ocean, or the statue symbolising the evil is burnt with fireworks, marking the destruction of evil During this time preparations also take place for Deepavali (the festival of lights) which is celebrated twenty days after Vijayadashami [4] [9] [10]\n\n\nDates\nAccording to some Hindu texts such as the Shakta and Vaishnava Puranas, Navaratri theoretically falls two or four times in a year Of these, the Sharada Navaratri near the September equinox (the autumn equinox in September–October) is the most celebrated and the Vasanta Navaratri near the March equinox (the spring equinox in March–April) is the next most significant to the culture of the Indian subcontinent In all cases, Navaratri falls in the bright half (waxing phase) of the Hindu lunisolar months The celebrations vary by region, leaving much to the creativity and preferences of the Hindu [3] [11] [12]\n\n\nSharada Navaratri\nSharada Navaratri is the most celebrated of the four Navaratri, named after Sharada which means autumn It commences on the first day (pratipada) of the bright fortnight of the lunar month of Ashvini [13] The festival is celebrated for nine nights once every year during this month, which typically falls in the Gregorian months of September and October The exact dates of the festival are determined according to the Hindu lunisolar calendar, and sometimes the festival may be held for a day more or a day less depending on the adjustments for sun and moon movements and the leap year [2] [6] [11] In many regions, the festival falls after the autumn harvest, and in others, during harvest [14]\n\n\nChaitra Navaratri\nChaitra Navaratri, also called Vasantha Navaratri, is the second most celebrated Navaratri, named after vasanta which means spring It is observed during the lunar month of Chaitra (March–April) The festival is devoted to goddess Durga, whose nine forms are worshipped on nine days The last day is also Rama Navami, the birthday of Rama For this reason, it is also called Rama Navaratri by some people [19] [20]\n\n\nMagha Navaratri\nMagha Navaratri is observed during the lunar month of Magha (January–February) This Navaratri is also known as Gupt (secret) Navaratri The fifth day of this festival is often independently observed as Vasant Panchami or Basant Panchami, the official start of spring in the Hindu tradition, where in goddess Saraswati is revered through arts, music, writing, and kite flying In some regions, the Hindu god of love, Kama is revered [22] [23] Magha Navaratri is observed regionally or by individuals [24]\n\n\nAshada Navaratri\nAshada Navaratri, also known as Gupta Navaratri, is observed during the lunar month of Ashadha (June–July), during the start of the monsoon season [25] Ashada Navaratri is observed regionally or by individuals [24]\n\n\nNine forms of Durga\nThe festival is associated to the prominent battle that took place between Durga and the demon Mahishasura to celebrate the victory of good over evil [26] This isn’t just a simple tale of good versus evil, but one filled with layers of symbolism and moral lessons [27] These nine days are solely dedicated to Durga and her nine avatars – the Navadurga [28]The specific forms of navadurga are extracted from the Devikavaca, a subsection of the Devipurana text and representative of a major aspect in the life of the goddess, Parvati [29] [30] Each day is associated to an incarnation of the goddess: [26] [31] [32] [33]\n\n\nDay 1 – Shailaputri\nPratipada, also known as the first day, is associated with the form Shailaputri (\"Daughter of Mountain\"), an incarnation of Parvati [30] It is

left Shailaputri is considered to be the direct incarnation of Mahakali The colour of the day is yellow, which depicts action and vigor [34] She is also considered to be a reincarnation of Sati (Shiva's first wife, who then reincarnates as Parvati) and is also known as Hemavati [35]\n\n\nDay 2 – Brahmacharini\nOn Dwitiya (second day), Goddess Brahmacharini (\"Unmarried One\"), [30] another incarnation of Parvati, is worshipped In this form, Parvati became Yogini, her unmarried self Brahmacharini is worshipped for emancipation or moksha and endowment of peace and prosperity Depicted as walking bare feet and holding a rudrakshmala (japmala) and a kamandala (water pot) in her hands, she symbolizes bliss and calm White is the colour code of this day The orange colour which depicts tranquility is sometimes used so that strong energy flows everywhere [citation needed]\n\n\nDay 3 – Chandraghanta\nTritiya (third day) commemorates the worship of Chandraghanta – the name derived from the fact that after marrying Shiva, Parvati adorned her forehead with the ardhachandra (lit half-moon) She is the embodiment of beauty and is also symbolic of bravery Grey is the colour of the third day, which is a vivacious colour and can cheer up everyone's mood [citation needed]\n\n\nDay 4 – Kushmanda\nGoddess Kushmanda is worshipped on Chaturthi (fourth day) Believed to be the creative power of the universe, Kushmanda is associated with the endowment of vegetation on earth, and hence, the colour of the day is green She is depicted as having eight arms and sits on a tiger [citation needed]\n\n\nDay 5 – Skandamata\nSkandamata, the goddess worshipped on Panchami (fifth day), is the mother of Skanda (or Kartikeya) [30] The green colour is symbolic of the transforming strength of a mother when her child is confronted with danger She is depicted riding a ferocious lion, having four arms, and holding her baby [citation needed]\n\n\nDay 6 – Katyayani\nBorn to sage Katyayana, she is an incarnation of Durga which killed the buffalo-demon, Mahisa [30] [29] and is shown to exhibit courage which is symbolized by the colour red Known as the warrior goddess, she is considered one of the most violent forms of Devi In this avatar, Katyayani rides a lion and has four hands She is celebrated on Shashti (sixth day) In eastern India, Maha Shashti is observed on this day and starting of

asuras Shumbha and Nishumbha The colour of the day is royal blue The goddess is depicted in a red-coloured attire or tiger skin with enraged and fiery eyes and dark skin The red colour is believed to represent prayer and assurance of the goddess's protection to the devotees from harm.\n\n\nDay 8 – Mahagauri\nMahagauri symbolizes intelligence and peace It is believed when Kaalaratri took a bath in the Ganga river, she gained a warmer complexion The colour associated with this day is pink which depicts optimism She is celebrated on Ashtami (eighth day) In eastern India, Maha Astami is observed on this day and starting with pushpanjali, kumari puja etc It is a very important tithi and considered as the birthday of Mahishasura mardini rupa of Chandi [citation needed]\n\n\nDay 9 – Siddhidatri\nOn the last day of the festival also known as Navami (ninth day), people pray to Siddhidhatri (\"Giver of Perfection\") [30] Sitting on a lotus, she is believed to possess and bestows all types of Siddhis She mainly bestows nine types of siddhis–anima (the ability to reduce one's body to the size of an atom), mahima (the ability to expand one's body to an infinitely large size), garima (the ability to become heavy or dense), laghima (the ability to become weightless or lighter than air), prapti (the ability to realize whatever one desires), prakamya (the ability to access any place

believed that one side of Shiva's body is that of Siddhidatri Therefore, he is also known by the name of Ardhanarishwara According to Vedic scriptures, Shiva attained all the siddhis by worshipping this goddess [citation needed]\n\n\nDay 10 - Dussehra or Vijayadashami\nVijayadashami is observed for different reasons and celebrated differently in various parts of the Indian subcontinent In the southern, eastern, northeastern, and some northern states of India, Vijayadashami marks the end of Durga Puja, commemorating goddess Durga's victory against the buffalo-demon Mahishasura to restore and protect dharma.\n\n\nRegional practices\nNavaratri is celebrated in different ways throughout India [39] Certain people revere different aspects of Durga and some people fast while others feast [11] The Chaitra Navaratri culminates in Ram Navami [40] and the Sharada Navaratri culminates in Durga Puja and Vijayadashami [11]\n\n\nEastern Indian subcontinent\nNavaratri is celebrated as the Durga Puja festival by Bengali Hindus, Assamese people, Bihari people, Tripuri people, Maithils, Nepalese people, Bhutanese people, Burmese people, Odia people as well as some minor tribal ethnicities in Bangladesh and India such as Santal people, Chakma people, Manipuri people and others It is the most important annual festival to Bengali Hindus and a major social and public event in eastern and northeastern states of India, where it dominates the religious life [41] [42] The occasion is celebrated with thousands [43] of pandals (temporary stages) that are built in community squares, roadside shrines, and large Durga temples in West Bengal, Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar, eastern Nepal, Assam, Tripura, and nearby regions It is also observed by some Shakta Hindus as a private, home-based festival [42] [44] [45] Durga Puja festival marks the victory of the goddess Durga in the battle against the shape-shifting, deceptive, and powerful buffalo demon Mahishasura [46] [47]\n\n\nNorth India\nIn North India, Navaratri is marked by the numerous Ramlila events, where episodes from the story of Rama and Ravana are enacted by teams of artists in rural and urban centers, inside temples, or in temporarily constructed stages This Hindu tradition of festive performance arts was inscribed by UNESCO as one of the \"Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity\" in 2008 [60] The festivities, states UNESCO, include songs, narration, recital and dialogue based on the Hindu text Ramcharitmanas by Tulsidas It is particularly notable in the historically important Hindu cities of Ayodhya, Varanasi, Vrindavan, Almora, Satna and Madhubani – cities in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar, and Madhya Pradesh [60]\n\n\nBihar and Jharkhand\nIn parts of Bihar and Jharkhand, Durga is revered during the autumn of Navaratri A huge number of pandals are made In Bihar, Durga is worshipped alongside Lakshmi, Saraswati, Kartikey, and Ganesha In other parts like Sitamarhi and close to the Nepal border, the spring Navaratri attracts a large Rama Navami fair, which marks the birth of Lord Rama It is the largest cattle trading fair and attracts a large handicraft market in pottery, kitchen, and housewares, as well as traditional clothing Festive performance arts and celebrations are held at the local Hindu temple dedicated to Sita, Hanuman, Durga, and Ganesha [63] [64]\n\n\nGujarat\nNavaratri in Gujarat is one of the state's main festivals The traditional celebrations include fasting for a day, or partially fasting each of the nine days by not eating grains or just taking liquid foods, in remembrance of one of nine aspects of Shakti goddess The prayers are dedicated to a symbolic clay pot called garbo, as a remembrance of the womb of the family and universe The clay pot is lit, and this is believed to represent the one Atman (soul, self) [65] [66]\n\n\nGoa\nIn the temples of Goa, on the first day of the Hindu month of Ashwin, a copper pitcher, surrounded by clay, is installed inside the sanctum sanctorum of Devi and Krishna temples, in which nine varieties of food grains are placed The nine nights are celebrated through devotional songs and religious discourses Artists arrive to perform folk musical instruments Celebrations include placing Durga's image in a specially-decorated colourful silver swing, known as Makhar, and for each of the nine nights, swinging Her to the tune of temple music (called as ranavadya) This is locally called Makharotsav [68] [69]\n\n\nKarnataka\nIn Karnataka, Navaratri is observed at home and by lighting up Hindu temples, cultural sites, and many regal processions It is locally called Dasara and it is the state festival (Naadahabba) of Karnataka Of the many celebrations, the Mysuru Dasara is a major one and is popular for its festivities [71]\n\n\nKerala\nIn Kerala, three days (Ashtami, Navami, and Vijayadashami) of Sharada Navaratri are celebrated as Sarasvati Puja in which books are worshipped The books are placed for Puja on Ashtami in their own houses, traditional nursery schools, or in temples On Vijayadashami, the books are ceremoniously taken out for reading and writing after worshipping Sarasvati Vijayadashami is considered auspicious for initiating the children into writing and reading, which is called Vidyarambham [75]\n\n\nMaharashtra\nNavaratri celebrations vary across Maharashtra and the specific rites differ between regions, even if they are called the same and dedicated to the same deity The most common celebration begins on the first day of Navaratri with Ghatasthapana, which literally means \"mounting of a jar\" On this day, rural households mount a copper or brass jar, filled with water, upon a small heap of rice kept on a wooden stool (pat) [76] The jar is typically placed other agriculture symbols such as a turmeric root, leaves of a mango tree, coconut, and major staple grains (usually eight varieties) A lamp is lighted symbolising knowledge and household prosperity, and kept alight through the nine nights of Navaratri [77]\n\n\nTamil Nadu\nNavaratri has been a historic tradition within Tamil Nadu, with Lakshmi, Saraswati, and Durga goddesses as the focus [80] Like the rest of India, the festival has been an occasion for performance arts, particularly Hindu temple dances such as Bharatanatyam and Mohiniyattam Major palaces, community centers, and historic temples have embedded dance halls For example, the Padmanabhapuram Palace built about 1600 CE has had a large dance hall with intricately carved pillars, a structure entirely made of stone This dance hall has traditionally been known as Navaratri Mantapa [81] The festivities begin with Vedic chants inaugurating the dances and other ceremonies Other Tamil Hindu temples, such as those associated with Sri Vaishnavism, also celebrate the Navaratri festivities [82]\n\n\nTelangana\nIn Telangana, Navaratri is celebrated as in the rest of India and it ends with Dasara During the Navaratri nights, a notable Telangana tradition involves Telugu Hindu women who produce Bathukamma for Navaratri goddesses It is an artistic flower decorations driven event, particularly using marigolds, which revere three different aspects Devi, called Tridevi In 2016, 9,292 women simultaneously participated to create a 20 feet high flower arrangements, one of the world's largest festive flower arrangement [88] [89]\n\n\nTextual mentions\nEarly mentions of Navaratri rituals are found in vernacular texts of the Ramayana, such as the Bengali Krittivasi Ramayana, whereby Rama is described as offering Durga puja [90] In the epic Mahabharata, Durga is praised twice in the chapters of Virata Parva and Bhishma Parva Rituals are also found in Puranic texts such as the Markandeya Purana, Devi Purana, Kalika Purana and Devi Bhagavata Purana [90]\n\n\nAnimal sacrifice\nAlthough rare, animal sacrifice is a part of some Durga puja celebrations during Navaratri in the eastern states of India The goddess is offered a sacrificial animal in this ritual in the belief that it stimulates her violent vengeance against the buffalo demon [91] According to Christopher Fuller, the animal sacrifice practice is rare among Hindus during Navaratri, or at other times, outside the Shaktism tradition found in the eastern Indian states of West Bengal, Odisha, and Assam [92] Even in these states, the festival season is one where significant animal sacrifices are observed [91] In some Shakta Hindu communities, the slaying of the buffalo demon and the victory of Durga are observed with a symbolic sacrifice instead of animal sacrifice [b] [94] [95]\n\n\nOutside Indian subcontinent\nThe Hindu diaspora that migrated as indentured servants during colonial era to various plantations and mines around the world, as well as those who migrated on their own, continued to mark their Navaratri traditions Hindus in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Sri Lanka for example, built Hindu temples in southeast Asia in the 19th century, and Navaratri has been one of their major traditional festivals [101] In Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Fiji, Mauritius, Canada, South Africa, the United States, and the United Kingdom, Navaratri and Diwali have been one of the most visible celebrations of the local Hindu communities from about mid 20th-century [102] [103]\n\n\nOther religions\nNavaratri and goddess worship is mentioned in the historic Sikhism literature, particularly in the Dasam Granth traditionally attributed to Guru Gobind Singh According to Louis Fenech, the Sikhs have historically mirrored the reverence for Devi Shakti and the worship of weapons in a manner similar to those by Shakta Hindus [107] [108] The second Guru of Sikhism, Guru Angad, was an ardent devotee of goddess Durga

The national director, Shamcey Supsup-Lee, explained that this was intended to \"even the playing field\" by having local organizers providing resources to participants in the pageant. It was compared to that used in Miss USA. Supsup-Lee added that it will \"provide women in the provinces with an equal opportunity\", noting that previously contestants based in Metro Manila had a financial advantage.\n\nWithdrawals and replacements\nOut of the 55 initial contestants announced, four announced their withdrawal from the competition prior to the coronation night: Natasha Jung of Kananga on February 22, 2024; Joanne Marie Thornley of Angeles on March 19; Lorraine Ojimba of Quezon City on April 3; and Kiara Landon of the Filipino community of Washington, United States, on April 19.\n\nLocation and date\nThe organization announced that the coronation night would be held on May 22, 2024, at the SM Mall of Asia Arena in Bay City, Pasay. The sale of tickets for the event began on April 8. The pageant and its related events were being held with the theme \"Love For All\". The initial fifty-five competitors were formally introduced at a press presentation on February 18, at the Hilton Manila, which was held concurrently with the appointment ceremonies for the Miss Philippines and Mister Pilipinas Worldwide pageants.\n\nAdditional titles\nThe organization announced that four more national titles would be contested in the pageant on May 13, 2024. In a separate ceremony following the coronation night, delegates were appointed to represent the country in Miss Supranational, Miss Charm, Miss Eco International, and Miss Cosmo.\n\nResults\nThe top 10 delegates shortlisted from the top 20 semifinalists were given the choice to represent the country in four international beauty pageants shortly after the coronation night. As first runner-up, Stacey Gabriel of Cainta had the first choice, but declined any of the titles. Ahtisa Manalo of Quezon then had the first choice as second runner-up and chose to be crowned Miss Cosmo Philippines.\n\nSpecial awards\nThe National Costume Competition was held on April 28, 2024, at the Sultan Kudarat Provincial Capitol Gym in Sultan Kudarat, with the theme Flora and Fauna. R'Bonney Gabriel and Marco Gumabao hosted the event. The results of the competition were announced on April 29, with Alexie Brooks of Iloilo City, Janet Hammond of Southern California, and Tamara Ocier of Tacloban, being named winners, each receiving a ₱100,000 cash prize.\n\nMajor awards\nThe National Costume Competition was held on April 28, 2024, at the Sultan Kudarat Provincial Capitol Gym in Sultan Kudarat, with the theme Flora and Fauna.

The results for each challenge were determined through online polls. The swimsuit competition, the first of the preliminary contests for the pageant, was held on April 20, in Boracay at the Aqua Boracay resort. Also determined during the contest were eight \"Acqua Boracay Angels\" and twelve brand ambassadors for Arete Tagaytay. The five finalists for the contest were announced on May 4. The individual reels of the contestants were released on April 27, which saw the public vote for the winner on Facebook. The third competition, the \"Up Close & Personal\" personality interviews, followed on May 7, with executive vice president Voltaire Tayag serving as the sole panelist. On May 8, voting opened for the runway challenge, the third contest.\n\nPageant\nThe results of the preliminary competition, held on May 19, 2024, at the Manila Hotel, which evaluated the 53 delegates in the swimsuit and evening gown categories and the closed-door interviews, determined the first 15 semifinalists for the edition. The voting public determined the winners of the pre-pageant challenges which each advanced a delegate to the semifinals, creating a total of 20 semifinalists, an increase of two from the previous edition. The semifinalists competed in the swimsuit competition, where they were then narrowed down to ten. Afterward, top 10 competed in the evening gown competition, where five delegates were chosen to advance to the finals. The top five finalists then participated in the question and answer portion where Miss Universe Philippines 2024 and her runners-up were determined.\n\nFormat\nThe results of the preliminary competition, held on May 19, 2024, at the Manila Hotel, which evaluated the 53 delegates in the swimsuit and evening gown categories and the closed-door interviews, determined the first 15 semifinalists for the edition.

Attracting backlash from netizens, the organizers released a public apology and re-uploaded the video of the telecast. The coronation night, which ran for nearly six hours, was criticized on social media for its length. The organization explained that the length was a result of allotting \"enough time\" for the \"tabulations, production set-ups, and costume changes\" during the event. As a result, a shortened version of the pageant was uploaded on the organization's YouTube channel.\n\nContestants\nFifty-three contestants competed for the title.\n\nNotes\nA total of 53 contestants

It is a major component of the aromatic scents and resins characteristic of numerous trees and plants. Limonene is a relatively stable monoterpene and can be distilled without decomposition, although at elevated temperatures it cracks to form isoprene.\n\n**In Plants**\n\n(+)-Limonene is a major component of the aromatic scents and resins characteristic of numerous coniferous and broadleaved trees. Some of the plants that contain limonene include:\n\n* Red and silver maple (Acer rubrum, Acer saccharinum)\n* Cottonwoods (Populus angustifolia)\n* Aspens (Populus grandidentata, Populus tremuloides)\n* Sumac (Rhus glabra)\n* Spruce (Picea spp.)\n* Various pines (e.g., Pinus echinata, Pinus ponderosa)\n* Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii)\n* Larches (Larix spp.)\n* True firs (Abies spp.)\n* Hemlocks (Tsuga spp.)\n* Cannabis (Cannabis sativa spp.)\n* Cedars (Cedrus spp.)\n* Various Cupressaceae\n* Juniper bush (Juniperus spp.)\n\nLimonene contributes to the characteristic odor of orange peel, orange juice, and other citrus fruits. To optimize recovery of valued components from citrus peel waste, (+)-limonene is typically removed.\n\n**Chemical Reactions**\n\nLimonene is a relatively stable monoterpene and can be distilled without decomposition, although at elevated temperatures it cracks to form isoprene. It oxidizes easily in moist air to produce carveol, carvone, and limonene oxide. With sulfur, it undergoes dehydrogenation to p-cymene.\n\nThe chemical stability of limonene makes it a useful compound for various applications, including the production of fragrances, flavors, and cleaning products. However, its reactivity also means that it can undergo chemical changes, which can affect its properties and uses.\n\n**Biosynthesis**\n\nIn nature, limonene is formed from geranyl pyrophosphate, via cyclization of a neryl carbocation or its equivalent. The final step involves loss of a proton from the cation to form the alkene. This biosynthetic pathway is common in plants, where limonene is produced as a byproduct of the synthesis of other compounds.\n\nThe biosynthesis of limonene is a complex process that involves multiple steps and enzymes. The exact details of the biosynthetic pathway are still not fully understood, but research has shed light on the key enzymes and intermediates involved.\n\n**Uses**\n\nAs the main fragrance of citrus peels, D-limonene is used in food manufacturing and some medicines, such as a flavoring agent to mask the bitter taste of alkaloids, and as a fragrance in perfumery, aftershave lotions, bath products, and other personal care products. (+)-Limonene is also used as a botanical insecticide and in the organic herbicides. It is added to cleaning products, such as hand cleansers to give a lemon or orange fragrance and for its ability to dissolve oils.\n\nIn contrast, (-)-limonene has a piny, turpentine-like odor and is used in different applications, such as in the production of fragrances and flavors.\n\n**Safety and Research**\n\nApplied to skin, limonene may cause irritation from contact dermatitis, but otherwise appears to be safe for human use. Limonene is flammable as a liquid or vapor and it is toxic to aquatic life.\n\nResearch has investigated the potential health effects of limonene, including its antioxidant properties, anti-inflammatory effects, and potential anticancer activity. However, more research is needed to fully understand the safety and efficacy of limonene as a therapeutic agent.\n\n**Cancer**\n\nThere is no evidence that the limonene in peel oils of citrus fruits affects the onset or progress of cancer, with one national agency stating, \"there is no consistent evidence that people with cancer who consume limonene—either in supplement form or by eating citrus fruits—get better or are more likely to be cured.\"\n\nThe relationship between limonene and cancer is complex and multifaceted. While some studies have suggested potential anticancer effects of limonene, others have found no significant association. Further research is needed to clarify the role of limonene in cancer prevention and treatment.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Monoterpenes\n* Citrus fruits\n* Coniferous trees\n* Plant-mediated insecticides\n* Fragrances and flavors\n* Cleaning products\n\n**References**\n\nNote: This article does not include any citations or references.\n\n**External Links**\n\n* National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)\n* United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\n* National Cancer Institute (NCI)\n* European Chemicals Agency (ECHA)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Limonene\" following this outline:\n\n\nIn plants\n(+)-Limonene is a major component of the aromatic scents and resins characteristic of numerous coniferous and broadleaved trees: red and silver maple (Acer rubrum, Acer saccharinum), cottonwoods (Populus angustifolia), aspens (Populus grandidentata, Populus tremuloides) sumac (Rhus glabra), spruce (Picea spp.), various pines (e.g., Pinus echinata, Pinus ponderosa), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), larches (Larix spp.), true firs (Abies spp.), hemlocks (Tsuga spp.), cannabis (Cannabis sativa spp.), [5] cedars (Cedrus spp.), various Cupressaceae, and juniper bush (Juniperus spp.) [1] [failed verification] It contributes to the characteristic odor of orange peel, orange juice and other citrus fruits [1] [6] To optimize recovery of valued components from citrus peel waste, (+)-limonene is typically removed [7]\n\n\nChemical reactions\nLimonene is a relatively stable monoterpene and can be distilled without decomposition, although at elevated temperatures it cracks to form isoprene [8]  It oxidizes easily in moist air to produce carveol, carvone, and limonene oxide [1] [9] With sulfur, it undergoes dehydrogenation to p-cymene [10]\n\n\nBiosynthesis\nIn nature, limonene is formed from geranyl pyrophosphate, via cyclization of a neryl carbocation or its equivalent as shown [11] The final step involves loss of a proton from the cation to form the alkene.\n\n\nUses\nAs the main fragrance of citrus peels, D-limonene is used in food manufacturing and some medicines, such as a flavoring agent to mask the bitter taste of alkaloids, and as a fragrance in perfumery, aftershave lotions, bath products, and other personal care products [1] (+)-Limonene is also used as a botanical insecticide [1] [12] (+)-Limonene is used in the organic herbicides [13] It is added to cleaning products, such as hand cleansers to give a lemon or orange fragrance (see orange oil) and for its ability to dissolve oils [1] In contrast, (-)-limonene has a piny, turpentine-like odor.\n\n\nSafety and research\nApplied to skin, limonene may cause irritation from contact dermatitis, but otherwise appears to be safe for human use [20] [21] Limonene is flammable as a liquid or vapor and it is toxic to aquatic life [1]\n\n\nCancer\nThere is no evidence that the limonene in peel oils of citrus fruits affects the onset or progress of cancer, with one national agency stating, \"there is no consistent evidence that people with cancer who consume limonene—either in supplement form or by eating citrus fruits—get better or are more likely to be cured\" [22]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He has established himself as a prominent figure in the entertainment industry, known for his versatility and range in various film genres.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJonah Hill was born on December 20, 1983, in Los Angeles, California. His parents, Sharon Lyn (née Chalkin) and Richard Feldstein, were both from Long Island, New York. Sharon is a costume designer and fashion stylist, while Richard was a tour accountant for Guns N' Roses. Hill has a younger sister, Beanie Feldstein, who is also an actress. Their older brother, Jordan Feldstein, was a music manager for Robin Thicke and Maroon 5 until his sudden death at age 40 from a DVT/pulmonary embolism.\n\nGrowing up, the family would often vacation in the Catskill Mountains, which had a profound impact on Hill's childhood. He has spoken fondly of these experiences, crediting them with shaping his sense of humor and creativity. Hill's parents encouraged his artistic pursuits from an early age, and he began writing and performing his own plays in high school.\n\n**Career**\n\nHill's early career began in the late 1990s, when he started performing his plays at the Black and White bar in the East Village neighborhood of New York City. His work developed a small following, and he soon realized that his true desire was to act in films. It was during this time that he befriended Dustin Hoffman's children, Rebecca and Jake, who introduced him to their father.\n\nThe elder Hoffman asked Hill to audition for a role in the 2004 film \"I Heart Huckabees,\" in which he made his film debut. This marked the beginning of Hill's transition from the stage to the screen. He went on to appear in a number of films throughout the 2000s, including \"40-Year-Old Virgin\" and \"Superbad.\"\n\n**2000s**\n\nHill's breakthrough role came in 2007 with the film \"Superbad,\" which he co-wrote and starred in alongside Michael Cera. The film was a critical and commercial success, and Hill's performance earned him an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Supporting Male. He went on to appear in a number of other successful films throughout the 2000s, including \"Get Him to the Greek\" and \"Moneyball.\"\n\n**2010s**\n\nAfter co-starring in \"Get Him to the Greek\" with Russell Brand, Hill started seeking more work in independent film. He turned down a role as one of the three principals in \"The Hangover\" to work with directors Jay Duplass and Mark Duplass in \"Cyrus\" (2010). Hill's performance in \"Cyrus\" earned him critical acclaim, and he went on to appear in a number of other independent films throughout the 2010s, including \"21 Jump Street\" and \"Mid90s.\"\n\n**2020s**\n\nIn 2020, Hill appeared alongside director Martin Scorsese in a commercial for Coca-Cola Energy, titled \"Show Up,\" which aired during Super Bowl LIV. This marked a new direction for Hill, who has been exploring the world of advertising and commercial work.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nIn July 2011, Hill appeared at the 2011 ESPN ESPY Awards having lost a significant amount of weight. He later said he had done so to seek more serious roles, explaining that he consulted with a trainer and a nutritionist, and had changed his diet to mainly sushi.\n\nHill has been open about his struggles with weight and body image, using his platform to promote self-acceptance and body positivity. He has also been involved in various charitable efforts, including working with the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and the American Cancer Society.\n\n**Filmography and Awards**\n\nHill has appeared in a wide range of films throughout his career, including:\n\n* \"I Heart Huckabees\" (2004)\n* \"40-Year-Old Virgin\" (2005)\n* \"Superbad\" (2007)\n* \"Get Him to the Greek\" (2010)\n* \"Cyrus\" (2010)\n* \"21 Jump Street\" (2012)\n* \"This Is the End\" (2013)\n* \"Money Monster\" (2016)\n* \"War Dogs\" (2016)\n* \"Mid90s\" (2018)\n\nHe has received numerous awards and nominations for his work, including:\n\n* Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Supporting Male for \"Superbad\" (2007)\n* Critics' Choice Movie Award nomination for Best Actor in a Comedy for \"21 Jump Street\" (2013)\n* Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for \"Saturday Night Live\" (2016)\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Jonah Hill at IMDb\n* Jonah Hill on Twitter\n* Jonah Hill on Instagram", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Jonah_Hill\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nHill was born on December 20, 1983, in Los Angeles, California [3] His parents are Sharon Lyn (née Chalkin), a costume designer and fashion stylist, and Richard Feldstein, a tour accountant for Guns N' Roses [4] [5] [6] He has a younger sister, actress Beanie Feldstein (b 1993) Their older brother, Jordan Feldstein (1977–2017), was a music manager for Robin Thicke and Maroon 5 until his sudden death at age 40 from a DVT/pulmonary embolism [7] [8] [9] [10] Their parents were originally from Long Island, New York, and the family vacationed in the Catskill Mountains [11]\n\n\nCareer\nIn college, Hill began writing his own plays and performing them in the Black and White bar in the East Village neighborhood of New York City [29] His plays developed a small following and helped him realize that his true desire was to act in films He was befriended by Dustin Hoffman's children, Rebecca and Jake, who introduced him to their father [11] The elder Hoffman asked him to audition for a role in I Heart Huckabees, in which Hill made his film debut [29] [27]\n\n\n2000s\nIn college, Hill began writing his own plays and performing them in the Black and White bar in the East Village neighborhood of New York City [29] His plays developed a small following and helped him realize that his true desire was to act in films He was befriended by Dustin Hoffman's children, Rebecca and Jake, who introduced him to their father [11] The elder Hoffman asked him to audition for a role in I Heart Huckabees, in which Hill made his film debut [29] [27]\n\n\n2010s\nAfter co-starring in Get Him to the Greek with Russell Brand, Hill started seeking more work in independent film [40] He turned down a role as one of the three principals in The Hangover to work with directors Jay Duplass and Mark Duplass in Cyrus (2010) [41] [42] [43]\n\n\n2020s\nIn 2020, Hill appeared alongside director Martin Scorsese in a commercial for Coca-Cola Energy, titled Show Up which aired during Super Bowl LIV [76]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn July 2011, Hill appeared at the 2011 ESPN ESPY Awards having lost a significant amount of weight; he later said he had done so to seek more serious roles He explained that he consulted with a trainer and a nutritionist, and had changed his diet to mainly sushi [85]\n\n\nFilmography and awards\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Attempted_assassination_of_Donald_Trump", "content": "\nBackground\nAt the time of the incident, Donald Trump was the presumptive Republican nominee in the 2024 presidential election [25] The shooting occurred two days before the July 15 start of the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin [26] A previous attempt at violence toward Trump during one of his rallies happened in 2016, when a man attempted to grab a security officer's gun at a rally outside of Las Vegas [27]\n\n\nSecurity arrangements\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation had no information about any particular threats before the event [37] The Secret Service had increased Trump's security detail in earlier weeks because of intelligence indicating that Iran was plotting to assassinate Trump, [38] [39] leading the Secret Service to boost security measures before the incident [40] The acting Iranian minister of foreign affairs rejected the claim and said it wanted a \"legal path to bring  [Trump] to justice\" for ordering the assassination of Qasem Soleimani [41]\n\n\nShooting\nOn July 7, 2024, Thomas Matthew Crooks visited the Butler Farm Show grounds, the site of a future campaign rally announced by Trump four days earlier He spent 20 minutes there and registered to attend the rally On July 12, Crooks went to a shooting range and practiced with his rifle, [47] a DPMS Panther Arms-produced AR-15–style rifle with a 16-inch (41 cm) barrel, chambered in 5.56×45mm NATO, which he had bought from his father [48] [49] [50] [51]\n\n\nTimeline\n(EDT)\n\n\nVictims\nCorey Comperatore of Sarver, Pennsylvania, was killed by gunfire [2] Comperatore, aged 50, worked as a project and tooling engineer and was the former chief of the Buffalo Township Volunteer Fire Company [122] According to Comperatore's family and Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro, he died while shielding his wife and two daughters from gunfire [120] [123] In addition to Trump, a number of other people were injured [124] Two other male audience members, aged 57 and 74, were shot and critically injured [125] [126] [127] Both victims were listed as being in stable condition the following day [128] The 57-year-old victim was discharged from the hospital on July 24; [129] the 74-year-old was discharged on July 26 [130]\n\n\nPerpetrator\nOn July 14, the FBI identified the shooter as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, which is about an hour's drive from the rally venue [10] [133] [134] Crooks is believed to have acted alone The rifle Crooks used had been legally bought by his father in 2013, who sold it to Crooks in October 2023 [47] [135] [83] He had no criminal record [102] [134] The FBI said that there had been \"no indication of any mental health issues\" regarding Crooks [136]\n\n\nAftermath\nTrump was transported to Butler Memorial Hospital for examination immediately after the shooting [153] The Secret Service had already called hospital officials and asked that the hospital be put on lockdown, putting into action an emergency plan that was created for when Trump spoke at another nearby rally in 2020 [154] The lockdown lasted for approximately

2024, when a gunman opened fire on a crowd attending a campaign rally for the then-presumptive Republican nominee for the 2024 presidential election in Butler, Pennsylvania. The shooting occurred two days before the start of the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\n## Background\n\nAt the time of the incident, Donald Trump was the presumptive Republican nominee in the 2024 presidential election. The shooting occurred two days before the July 15 start of the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. A previous attempt at violence toward Trump during one of his rallies happened in 2016, when a man attempted to grab a security officer's gun at a rally outside of Las Vegas.\n\n## Security Arrangements\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation had no information about any particular threats before the event. The Secret Service had increased Trump's security detail in earlier weeks because of intelligence indicating that Iran was plotting to assassinate Trump, leading the Secret Service to boost security measures before the incident. The acting Iranian minister of foreign affairs rejected the claim and said it wanted a \"legal path to bring [Trump] to justice\" for ordering the assassination of Qasem Soleimani.\n\n## Shooting\n\nOn July 7, 2024, Thomas Matthew Crooks visited the Butler Farm Show grounds, the site of a future campaign rally announced by Trump four days earlier. He spent 20 minutes there and registered to attend the rally. On July 12, Crooks went to a shooting range and practiced with his rifle, a DPMS Panther Arms-produced AR-15–style rifle with a 16-inch (41 cm) barrel, chambered in 5.56×45mm NATO, which he had bought from his father.\n\n## Timeline\n\n(EDT)\n\n* 9:30 a.m.: Trump's motorcade arrived at the venue.\n* 10:00 a.m.: Crooks walked onto the roof of the building and opened fire on the crowd.\n* 10:05 a.m.: The shooting stopped, and the Secret Service rushed to secure the area.\n* 10:15 a.m.: Trump was transported to Butler Memorial Hospital for examination.\n* 11:00 a.m.: The FBI identified the shooter as Thomas Matthew Crooks.\n* 12:00 p.m.: The Secret Service confirmed that Trump was safe.\n* 1:00 p.m.: Crooks was taken into custody by the FBI.\n* 2:00 p.m.: The hospital was put on lockdown, and law enforcement from the Secret Service, FBI, Homeland Security, Pittsburgh police, and Butler police guarded the hospital's entrances.\n* 3:00 p.m.: The lockdown lasted for approximately three hours.\n* 4:00 p.m.: Trump's motorcade left the hospital bound for Pittsburgh International Airport.\n* 5:00 p.m.: Trump landed in Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey.\n* 6:00 p.m.: Trump spent the night at Trump National Golf Club Bedminster.\n\n## Victims\n\nCorey Comperatore of Sarver, Pennsylvania, was killed by gunfire. Comperatore, aged 50, worked as a project and tooling engineer and was the former chief of the Buffalo Township Volunteer Fire Company. According to Comperatore's family and Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro, he died while shielding his wife and two daughters from gunfire. In addition to Trump, a number of other people were injured. Two other male audience members, aged 57 and 74, were shot and critically injured. Both victims were listed as being in stable condition the following day. The 57-year-old victim was discharged from the hospital on July 24; the 74-year-old was discharged on July 26.\n\n## Perpetrator\n\nOn July 14, the FBI identified the shooter as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, which is about an hour's drive from the rally venue. Crooks is believed to have acted alone. The rifle Crooks used had been legally bought by his father in 2013, who sold it to Crooks in October 2023. He had no criminal record. The FBI said that there had been \"no indication of any mental health issues\" regarding Crooks.\n\n## Aftermath\n\nTrump was transported to Butler Memorial Hospital for examination immediately after the shooting. The Secret Service had already called hospital officials and asked that the hospital be put on lockdown, putting into action an emergency plan that was created for when Trump spoke at another nearby rally in 2020. The lockdown lasted for approximately three hours, with law enforcement from the Secret Service, FBI, Homeland Security, Pittsburgh police, and Butler police guarding the hospital's entrances. Shortly after his arrival, a Secret Service spokesperson confirmed that Trump was safe. Trump's motorcade left the hospital at around 9:30 p.m EDT bound for Pittsburgh International Airport. Trump landed in Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey in the early hours of July 14 and spent the night at Trump National Golf Club Bedminster.

known professionally as Nicole Scherzinger, is a Filipino-American singer, songwriter, actress, television personality, and dancer. She rose to fame as the lead singer of the Pussycat Dolls and has since become a successful solo artist.\n\nEarly Life\n\nNicole Scherzinger was born on June 29, 1978, in Honolulu, Hawaii, to Alfonso Valiente of Filipino descent and Rosemary, her mother, who is of Native Hawaiian and Ukrainian descent. When Nicole was two years old, her father left the family. Rosemary then married German-American Gary Scherzinger, who adopted Nicole, and whose surname she eventually took. Nicole has a younger sister, Keala.\n\nGrowing up, Nicole was raised as Roman Catholic and considered herself conservative with \"really strong religious beliefs.\" She attended a local elementary school in Louisville, Kentucky, where her mother was a clerk, and her step-father was a welder. Nicole describes her upbringing as difficult, stating that she grew up \"without much money\" and supported her parents by being a waitress, taking local modeling jobs, and being part of an entertainment troupe of the local amusement park, Kentucky Kingdom.\n\nCareer\n\nIn 2001, Nicole's mother saw a commercial for the WB's show Popstars USA, a reality series with the aim to chronicle a music group's formation until the recording of their debut album. Warner Bros imprint London-Sire Records signed the group to a recording contract before the band was named and had finalized its membership, due to the hours of network television exposure the group would receive. Initially reluctant to audition, Nicole later opted otherwise as she saw it as an opportunity to travel to Los Angeles. For her audition, she sang Whitney Houston's version of Dolly Parton's song \"I Will Always Love You\" and, alongside Ana Maria Lombo, Maile Misajon, Ivette Sosa, and Rosanna Tavarez, established the girl group Eden's Crush. Their debut single, \"Get Over Yourself,\" was released in March 2001 and debuted at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and became the first female act to debut at number one on the Hot 100 Singles Sales chart. Their debut studio album, Popstars, debuted at number six on the Billboard 200 chart.\n\nEden's Crush went on to tour with 'N Sync and Jessica Simpson, but, by the end of the year, their label went bankrupt and the group disbanded. During this time, will.i.am, front man of The Black Eyed Peas, approached Nicole to become a member of the group, but her then-boyfriend, Nick Hexum, declined. Following the band's dissolution, Nicole took a detour into acting and guest-starred in television shows such as My Wife and Kids and had a cameo in the independent comedy, Chasing Papi.\n\n2003–2009: The Pussycat Dolls\n\nIn August 2003, opting for a solo recording contract, Nicole traveled to Arista Records office in New York with a demo CD of her own written material under her Hawaiian family name Nicole Kea.

After will.i.am recommended Nicole to Iovine, and in hopes to obtain a solo deal, she successfully auditioned in December 2003 along with Melody Thornton joining Carmit Bachar, Ashley Roberts, Jessica Sutta, and Kimberly Wyatt.

The book is a thriller that explores the story of John Kelly, a former Navy SEAL, and his quest for justice and revenge after his pregnant wife is killed in a car accident. The novel delves into themes of trauma, violence, and the psychological effects of war on individuals and society.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe story begins in 1970, when John Kelly, a former Navy SEAL, picks up a hitchhiker named Pam on his way to his home on Battery Island in the Chesapeake Bay. They quickly become lovers, and over time Kelly discovers her full name, Pamela Madden, and that she is a runaway who became a drug mule and prostitute. She has recently escaped from her drug-dealer/pimp Henry Tucker. Kelly, along with the help of doctors Sam and Sarah Rosen, helps rehabilitate her from barbiturates.\n\nWeeks after recovering, Kelly and Pam go to Baltimore for follow-up treatment. Kelly takes them scouting through the neighborhood where her pimps work. One of them recognizes Pam and pursues them in a car chase. Kelly is gravely wounded by a shotgun blast, while Pam is recaptured and later tortured, gang-raped, and killed.\n\nThe novel explores Kelly's rage and frustration as he seeks revenge against those responsible for Pam's death. He becomes a one-man army, taking on the corrupt system and the men who have wronged him. Along the way, he is aided by a few allies, including a mysterious woman who helps him navigate the underworld.\n\n**Characters**\n\nAt the center of the novel is John Kelly, a complex and troubled character. He is a former Navy SEAL, haunted by the memories of his time in Vietnam. He is driven by a desire for justice and revenge, but also struggles with his own demons. Through Kelly's character, Clancy explores the psychological effects of war on individuals and society.\n\nPam, Kelly's love interest, is a complex and multifaceted character. She is a victim of circumstance, forced into a life of prostitution and drug addiction by her pimp. She is also a survivor, determined to escape her situation and start a new life.\n\nThe novel also features a range of supporting characters, including doctors Sam and Sarah Rosen, who help Kelly and Pam in their time of need. These characters add depth and complexity to the story, highlighting the ways in which individuals can make a difference in the lives of others.\n\n**Baltimore**\n\nThe city of Baltimore plays a significant role in the novel, serving as a backdrop for the story's events. The city's gritty, urban landscape provides a fitting setting for the novel's themes of violence and corruption. Through its depiction of Baltimore, Clancy highlights the city's complex social and economic issues, including poverty, crime, and inequality.\n\n**Vietnam**\n\nThe novel's exploration of Vietnam is a key aspect of its themes and character development. Kelly's experiences in Vietnam are a central part of his backstory, shaping his character and influencing his actions throughout the novel. Through Kelly's character, Clancy explores the psychological effects of war on individuals and society, highlighting the ways in which trauma and violence can shape individuals and communities.\n\n**Themes**\n\nWithout Remorse explores a range of themes, including trauma, violence, and the psychological effects of war on individuals and society. The novel highlights the ways in which trauma can shape individuals and communities, leading to violence and aggression. Through Kelly's character, Clancy explores the complexities of revenge and justice, highlighting the ways in which individuals may seek to punish those who have wronged them.\n\nThe novel also explores the theme of corruption, highlighting the ways in which institutions and individuals can become corrupt and complicit in systems of violence and exploitation. Through its depiction of Baltimore, Clancy highlights the city's complex social and economic issues, including poverty, crime, and inequality.\n\n**Development**\n\nClancy began working on Without Remorse in 1971, but did not complete the novel until 1992, when he spent four months revising and editing the manuscript. According to Clancy, the process of writing the novel was a challenging one, requiring him to delve into the complexities of trauma, violence, and the psychological effects of war on individuals and society.\n\n**Reception**\n\nWithout Remorse was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the New York Times bestseller list for the week of August 29, 1993. The novel received positive reviews from critics, who praised its complex characters, gripping plot, and thought-provoking themes.\n\n**Film Adaptation**\n\nA film adaptation of Without Remorse was in development for several years, with various actors and directors attached to the project at different times. In 2012, Christopher McQuarrie signed on to direct the adaptation for Paramount Pictures, with Tom Hardy set to star as John Kelly. However, the project was ultimately scrapped, and the film remains in development hell.\n\nDespite the challenges and setbacks, Without Remorse remains a significant and influential novel, exploring complex themes and characters in a gripping and thought-provoking way. Its legacy continues to be felt, inspiring new adaptations and interpretations of the story.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Without_Remorse\" following this outline:\n\n\nPlot\nIn 1970, former Navy SEAL John Kelly, who recently lost his pregnant wife, Patricia, in a car accident, picks up a hitchhiker named Pam on his way to his home on Battery Island in the Chesapeake Bay They quickly become lovers, and over time Kelly discovers her full name, Pamela Madden, and that she is a runaway who became a drug mule and prostitute; she has recently escaped from her drug-dealer/pimp Henry Tucker Kelly, along with the help of doctors Sam and Sarah Rosen, helps rehabilitate her from barbiturates Weeks after recovering, Kelly and Pam go to Baltimore for follow-up treatment Kelly takes them scouting through the neighborhood where her pimps work One of them recognizes Pam and pursues them in a car chase Kelly is gravely wounded by a shotgun blast, while Pam is recaptured and later tortured, gang-raped, and killed.\n\n\nCharacters\nWithout Remorse is said to be inspired by David Morrell's novel First Blood (1972) as well a string of action films that feature violent and \"psycho\" Vietnam veterans of the 1980s Clancy subverted the cliché by framing Kelly's rage and frustration as \"pro-social\" Moreover, it gave him a platform to express his disgust with the U.S government for neglecting Vietnam veterans, who \"understand the arts of war\" [2]\n\n\nBaltimore\nWithout Remorse is said to be inspired by David Morrell's novel First Blood (1972) as well a string of action films that feature violent and \"psycho\" Vietnam veterans of the 1980s Clancy subverted the cliché by framing Kelly's rage and frustration as \"pro-social\" Moreover, it gave him a platform to express his disgust with the U.S government for neglecting Vietnam veterans, who \"understand the arts of war\" [2]\n\n\nVietnam\nWithout Remorse is said to be inspired by David Morrell's novel First Blood (1972) as well a string of action films that feature violent and \"psycho\" Vietnam veterans of the 1980s Clancy subverted the cliché by framing Kelly's rage and frustration as \"pro-social\" Moreover, it gave him a platform to express his disgust with the U.S government for neglecting Vietnam veterans, who \"understand the arts of war\" [2]\n\n\nThemes\nWithout Remorse is said to be inspired by David Morrell's novel First Blood (1972) as well a string of action films that feature violent and \"psycho\" Vietnam veterans of the 1980s Clancy subverted the cliché by framing Kelly's rage and frustration as \"pro-social\" Moreover, it gave him a platform to express his disgust with the U.S government for neglecting Vietnam veterans, who \"understand the arts of war\" [2]\n\n\nDevelopment\nClancy started working on Without Remorse in 1971 He later went back to the previously abandoned story in 1992, spending about four months on the novel He explained the process: \"You gotta tell a good story if people are going to read it I think you have an ethical obligation to deal with those issues as truthfully as possible So, there's an educational aspect to what I do.\"\n\n\nReception\nCommercially, the book debuted at number one on the New York Times bestseller list for the week of August 29, 1993.\n\n\nFilm adaptation\nSavoy Pictures first bought the film rights to Without Remorse soon after the novel was released for $2.5 million [8] At one point, Keanu Reeves was offered the role as Clark for $7 million but declined [9] Variety magazine reported that Laurence Fishburne and Gary Sinise were later attached to star in the adaptation, but production was shut down due to script problems and financial woes with the production company [10] The film went under development hell for years until Christopher McQuarrie signed on with Paramount Pictures to direct the adaptation in 2012 [11] Tom Hardy was approached by Paramount to play Clark, and Kevin Costner was slated to reprise his role as mentor William Harper from another Clancy-based film, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit (2014), but this version was scrapped [12]\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

caused trouble for him The plot-line was then changed to focus on the group of kids alone, and later, the kids battling adulthood [9] The show began development under the name The Kids Next Door, which was later changed to the current title after another network began developing a show called Pigs Next Door [10] In 2001, the show's pilot episode, \"No P in the OOL\", which was produced at Cartoon Network Studios, won a Cartoon Network viewer's poll, and as a result, Codename: Kids Next Door was greenlit to become a series, while Kenny and the Chimp was not greenlit by the channel [11] The character Professor XXXL, who appeared in \"Diseasy Does It\", became a recurring character in Codename: Kids Next Door after Kenny and the Chimp was not picked up for a series, while Kenny and

The show revolves around a group of five 10-year-old children, using codenames Numbuhs 1 through 5, who are the main home operatives of Sector V, a worldwide espionage-style organization fighting against crimes committed by adults, senior citizens, teenagers, and other children. The series is known for its unique blend of humor, action, and satire, and has gained a large following worldwide.\n\nOverview\nThe series revolves around a group of five 10-year-old children (later retconned to be varying ages), using codenames Numbuhs 1 through 5, who are the main home operatives of what is known as Sector V, which is part of a worldwide espionage-style organization called the Kids Next Door. Their mission is to fight crimes against children (such as homework and flossing), many of which are willingly committed by \"evil\" adults, senior citizens, teenagers, and other children. Numbuh 1 is a level-headed, no-nonsense British-American boy named Nigel Uno, leader of Sector V. Numbuh 2 is an overweight, nerdy Jewish-American boy named Hogarth \"Hoagie\" Pennywhistle Gilligan, Jr. Numbuh 3 is a friendly and happy-go-lucky Japanese-American girl named Kuki Sanban. Numbuh 4 is a short-tempered and hot-headed Australian-American boy named Wallabee \"Wally\" Beetles. Numbuh 5 is a quiet, laid-back, black French-American girl named Abigail \"Abby\" Lincoln.\n\nSynopsis\nThe series revolves around a group of five 10-year-old children (later retconned to be varying ages), using codenames Numbuhs 1 through 5, who are the main home operatives of what is known as Sector V, which is part of a worldwide espionage-style organization called the Kids Next Door.

Numbuh 4 is a short-tempered and hot-headed Australian-American boy named Wallabee \"Wally\" Beetles. Numbuh 5 is a quiet, laid-back, black French-American girl named Abigail \"Abby\" Lincoln.\n\nStorylines\nThe episodes are titularly presented as the missions of the members of Sector V in the Kids Next Door, denoted as \"Operation:\" followed by an acronym that can give viewers clues as to what each mission is about. Most episodes are divided into two parts, each with a different mission, while some episodes consist of two directly linked parts with one mission. Usually, the episodes have very little continuity with each other, although occasionally an episode will have a reference to at least one earlier episode and/or lead to consequences in later ones. Season Five's \"Operation: O.U.T.B.R.E.A.K.\" is a direct continuation of the episode \"Operation: V.I.R.U.S.\", and Season Six's \"Operation: S.C.I.E.N.C.E.\" leads into \"Operation: A.M.I.S.H.\" while another pair of Season Six episodes; \"Operation: R.E.C.E.S.S.\" and \"Operation: H.A.M.S.T.E.R.\", occur simultaneously, the latter showing what sort of thing transpires while the team is away.\n\nProduction\nWarburton created a pilot episode, titled \"Diseasy Does It\", for another planned show, Kenny and the Chimp, which was to be produced by Hanna-Barbera. Among the planned recurring characters for Kenny and the Chimp was a group of rebellious children known as \"Those Kids Next Door\", who carried out their mischief from a house next to Kenny's home, and frequently caused trouble for him. The plot-line was then changed to focus on the group of kids alone, and later, the kids battling adulthood. The show began development under the name The Kids Next Door, which was later changed to the current title after another network began developing a show called Pigs Next Door. In 2001, the show's pilot episode, \"No P in the OOL\", which was produced at Cartoon Network Studios, won a Cartoon Network viewer's poll, and as a result, Codename: Kids Next Door was greenlit to become a series, while Kenny and the Chimp was not greenlit by the channel. The character Professor XXXL, who appeared in \"Diseasy Does It\", became a recurring character in Codename: Kids Next Door after Kenny and the Chimp was not picked up for a series, while Kenny and Chimpy did make a cameo in \"No P in the OOL\".\n\nCharacters\nThere are six seasons, each with 13 episodes (two half-length episodes counting as one), adding up to 78 episodes altogether. There have been two TV movies, the first taking place between the second and third episodes of season 6 (Operation: Z.E.R.O.), and the second at the end of season 6 (Operation: I.N.T.E.R.V.I.E.W.S.), which serves as the series finale.\n\nKND Organization\nThere are six seasons, each with 13 episodes (two half-length episodes counting as one), adding up to 78 episodes altogether.

{"title": "Malcolm_McLaren", "content": "\nEarly years\nMcLaren was born on 3 September 1946 [2] to Scottish-born [3] engineer [3] Peter McLaren, an upper-middle-class [3] Londoner who was at that time serving with the Royal Engineers, [4] and Emily Isaacs, the daughter of tailor Mick Isaacs and independently wealthy Rose Corré Isaacs, whose father had been a Portuguese Sephardic Jewish diamond dealer.\n\n\nFashion design and music\nIn October 1971, McLaren took over the back part of the retail premises at 430 King's Road in Chelsea, West London, and sold rock and roll records, refurbished 1950s radiograms and dead stock clothing as \"In The Back Of Paradise Garage\" With the assistance of art school friend Patrick Casey, McLaren converted the entire ground floor into the store and renamed it Let It Rock initially selling clothing (dead stock, military surplus) and objects he'd sourced When the shop became a success, he enlisted the help of his then-girlfriend Vivienne Westwood who customized and repaired original clothing and made facsimiles [9] [10]\n\n\n430 King's Road, Vivienne Westwood and New York Dolls\nIn October 1971, McLaren took over the back part of the retail premises at 430 King's Road in Chelsea, West London, and sold rock and roll records, refurbished 1950s radiograms and dead stock clothing as \"In The Back Of Paradise Garage\" With the assistance of art school friend Patrick Casey, McLaren converted the entire ground floor into the store and renamed it Let It Rock initially selling clothing (dead stock, military surplus) and objects he'd sourced When the shop became a success, he enlisted the help of his then-girlfriend Vivienne Westwood who customized and repaired original clothing and made facsimiles [9] [10]\n\n\nSex Pistols\nFrom 1974, McLaren had advised Sex customers Paul Cook and Steve Jones on their musical aspirations, having proposed that one of his shop assistants, Glen Matlock, join them as the bass-player in a group McLaren named Kutie Jones and his Sex Pistols In the summer of 1975, McLaren ejected frontman Wally Nightingale from the line-up because he did not fit with McLaren's vision for the band's image [14] His one-time associate Bernie Rhodes, who would later become the manager of the Clash, claimed he spotted a new frontman in another customer, John Lydon, then sporting green hair and torn clothes with the words \"I hate\" written on a Pink Floyd T-shirt above the band's name After Lydon joined, McLaren dubbed him \"Johnny Rotten\" and shortened the band's name to simply Sex Pistols, stating that he wanted to give the impression of \"sexy young assassins\" [15]\n\n\nOther artists\nMcLaren was approached by Adam Ant to manage Adam and the Ants following their debut album release in late 1979 Shortly thereafter, three members of the band left to form Bow Wow Wow under McLaren's management McLaren continued to manage Ant as he formed a new lineup of the Ants and also advised the Slits and Jimmy the Hoover.\n\n\nSolo music career\nIn 1983, McLaren released Duck Rock, an album that, in collaboration with producer and co-writer Trevor Horn and the World's Famous Supreme Team (a duo of hip hop radio disc jockeys from New York City who hosted a hip hop and classic R&B show on WHBI 105.9 FM and were among the first DJs to introduce the art of scratching to the world), mixed up influences from Africa and the Americas, including hip hop The album helped bring hip-hop to a wider audience The singles \"Buffalo Gals\" and \"Double Dutch\" became top-10 hits in the UK, with the former also a minor regional hit in the US.\n\n\nRoyalty payment controversies\nIn 1982, McLaren visited Johannesburg in South Africa His hit song, \"Double Dutch\" was taken from \"Puleng\", by mbaqanga band \"The Boyoyo Boys\", as was the flip side \"Zulus on a Time Bomb\", from \"Tsotsi\" \"On The Road To Soweto\" was lifted from a General MD Shirinda and the Gaza Sisters song, \"He Mdjadji\", while two songs were taken from the Mahotella Queens, with \"Thina Siyakhanyisa\" becoming \"Jive My Baby\", and \"Kgarebe Tsaga Mothusi\" becoming \"Punk It Up\".\n\n\nFilm production\nIn 1984, McLaren turned away from record-making in favour of theatrical and film production, starting with a musical version of the Fans album to be staged off-Broadway with the impresario Joseph Papp This was to remain in development for three years and involved contributions from the choreographer Tommy Tune [24]\n\n\nCampaign to become Mayor of London\nAn article in the New Statesman, published on 20 December 1999, titled \"My Vision for London\", included the \"McLaren Manifesto\", [28] prompting speculation that McLaren might stand to be elected as Mayor of London [29] With funds sourced from Sony Music by the rock music entrepreneur Alan McGee, McLaren subsequently launched a campaign to stand as an independent candidate in the inaugural elections for the position in May 2000 [29]\n\n\nRadio and TV projects\nIn 2006, McLaren presented the documentary series Malcolm McLaren's Musical Map of London for BBC Radio 2, followed in 2007 by Malcolm McLaren's Life and Times in L.A.\n\n\nVisual art and

Gaga is a multi-platinum, award-winning American singer-songwriter and actress known for her unique voice, captivating stage presence, and unapologetic style. Born Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta on March 28, 1986, in Manhattan, New York City, Gaga rose to fame in the late 2000s with her debut album \"The Fame\" and has since become a global superstar. With a career spanning over a decade, Gaga has released numerous chart-topping albums, singles, and EPs, and has won numerous awards, including 13 Grammy Awards.\n\n**Life and Career**\n\n## Early Life\n\nStefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta was born into an upper-middle-class Catholic family on March 28, 1986, at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, New York City. Both of her parents have Italian ancestry and are philanthropists and business executives. Gaga's parents are Cynthia Louise (née Bissett) and Joseph Germanotta, and she has a younger sister named Natali. Brought up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, Gaga said in an interview that her parents came from lower-class families and worked hard for everything.\n\n## Education\n\nFrom age 11, Gaga attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart, a private all-girls Roman Catholic school. She has described her high-school self as \"very dedicated, very studious, very disciplined\" but also \"a bit insecure.\" She considered herself a misfit and was mocked for \"being either too provocative or too eccentric.\"\n\n## Career Beginnings\n\nIn 2005, Gaga recorded two songs with hip-hop artist Melle Mel for an audio book accompanying Cricket Casey's children's novel \"The Portal in the Park.\" She also formed a band called the SGBand with some friends from NYU. They played gigs around New York and became a fixture of the downtown Lower East Side club scene. After the 2006 Songwriters Hall of Fame New Songwriters Showcase at the Cutting Room in June, talent scout Wendy Starland recommended her to music producer Rob Fusari. Fusari collaborated with Gaga, who traveled daily to New Jersey, helping to develop her songs and compose new material. The producer said they began dating in May 2006, and claimed to have been the first person to call her \"Lady Gaga,\" which was derived from Queen's song \"Radio Ga Ga.\"\n\n## Breakthrough with The Fame and The Fame Monster\n\nBy 2008, Gaga had relocated to Los Angeles to work extensively with her record label to complete her debut album, \"The Fame,\" and to set up her own creative team called the Haus of Gaga, modeled on Andy Warhol's The Factory. \"The Fame\" was released on August 19, 2008, and reached number one in Austria, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, and the UK, as well as the top five in Australia and the US. Its first two singles, \"Just Dance\" and \"Poker Face,\" reached number one in the United States, Australia, Canada, and the UK. The latter was also the world's bestselling single of 2009, with 9.8 million copies sold that year, and spent a record 83 weeks on Billboard magazine's Digital Songs chart.\n\n## Born This Way and Artpop\n\nIn February 2011, Gaga released \"Born This Way,\" the lead single from her studio album of the same name. The song sold more than one million copies within five days, earning the Guinness World Record for the fastest selling single on iTunes. It debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the 1,000th number-one single in the history of the charts. Her music video for \"The Edge of Glory\" portrayed her dancing on a fire escape and walking on a lonely street, without intricate choreography and back-up dancers.\n\n## Cheek to Cheek and American Horror Story\n\nIn February 2015, Gaga became engaged to Taylor Kinney. After the lukewarm response to \"Artpop,\" Gaga began to reinvent her image and style. According to Billboard, this shift started with the release of \"Cheek to Cheek\" and the attention she received for her performance at the 87th Academy Awards, where she sang a medley of songs from \"The Sound of Music\" in a tribute to Julie Andrews.\n\n## A Star Is Born and Las Vegas Residency\n\nIn March 2018, Gaga supported the March for Our Lives gun-control rally in Washington, D.C., and released a cover of Elton John's \"Your Song\" for his tribute album \"Revamp.\" Later that year, she starred as struggling singer Ally in Bradley Cooper's musical romantic drama \"A Star Is Born,\" a remake of the 1937 film of the same name. The film follows Ally's relationship with singer Jackson Maine (played by Cooper), which becomes strained after her career begins to overshadow his.\n\n## Chromatica and Love for Sale\n\nGaga's sixth studio album, \"Chromatica,\" was released on May 29, 2020, to positive reviews. It debuted atop the US charts, becoming her sixth consecutive number-one album in the country, and reached the top spot in more than a dozen other territories, including Australia, Canada, France, Italy, and the UK. \"Chromatica\" won the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, and debuted at number one in the US, making Gaga the third person to top the country's chart in the 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s.\n\n## Artistry\n\nGaga grew up listening to artists such as Michael Jackson, the Beatles, Stevie Wonder, Queen, Bruce Springsteen, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Whitney Houston, Elton John, Prince, En Vogue, TLC, Christina Aguilera, Janet Jackson, and Blondie. These artists have all influenced her music. Gaga's musical inspiration varies from dance-pop singers such as Madonna and Michael Jackson to glam rock artists such as David Bowie and Freddie Mercury, as well as the theatrics of the pop artist Andy Warhol and her own performance roots in musical theater.\n\n## Videos and Stage\n\nFeaturing constant costume changes and provocative visuals, Gaga's music videos are often described as short films.

influence, specifically Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath and Marilyn Manson [299] [300] [301] [302] She has credited Beyoncé as a key inspiration to pursue a musical career [303]\n\n\nInfluences\nGaga grew up listening to artists such as Michael Jackson, [287] the Beatles, Stevie Wonder, Queen, Bruce Springsteen, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Whitney Houston, [288] Elton John, Prince, [289] [290] En Vogue, TLC, [291] Christina Aguilera, [292] Janet Jackson, [293] and Blondie, [294] who have all influenced her music [295] Gaga's musical inspiration varies from dance-pop singers such as Madonna and Michael Jackson to glam rock artists such as David Bowie and Freddie Mercury, as well as the theatrics of the pop artist Andy Warhol and her own performance roots in musical theater [31] [296] She has been compared to Madonna, who has said that she sees herself reflected in Gaga [297] Gaga has expressed her desire to revolutionize pop music the way Madonna did [298] Gaga has also cited heavy metal bands as an influence, specifically Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath and Marilyn Manson [299] [300] [301] [302] She has credited Beyoncé as a key inspiration to pursue a musical career [303]\n\n\nMusical style and themes\nCritics have analyzed and scrutinized Gaga's musical and performance style, as she has experimented with new ideas and images throughout her career She has said that she finds the continual reinvention \"liberating\", which she has been drawn to since childhood [313] Gaga combines a variety of music genres, particularly incorporating elements of rock into her pop and dance music She has also branched out into jazz and other non-pop musical genres [314] Gaga's voice has been classified as a contralto, [315] [316] [317] with a range spanning from B♭2 to B5 [318] [319] [320] She has changed her vocal style regularly, and deemed Born This Way \"much more vocally up to par with what I've always been capable of\" [321] [322] In summing up her voice, Entertainment Weekly wrote: \"There's an immense emotional intelligence behind the way she uses her voice Almost never does she overwhelm a song with her vocal ability, recognizing instead that artistry is to be found in nuance rather than lung power.\" [323]\n\n\nVideos and stage\nFeaturing constant costume changes and provocative visuals, Gaga's music videos are often described as short films [339] The video for \"Telephone\" earned Gaga the Guinness World Record for Most Product Placement in a Video [340] According to author Curtis Fogel, she explores bondage and sadomasochism and highlights prevalent feminist themes The main themes of her music videos are sex, violence, and power She has called herself \"a little bit of a feminist\" and asserted that she is \"sexually empowering women\" [341] Billboard ranked her sixth on its list of \"The 100 Greatest Music Video Artists of All Time\" in 2020, stating that \"the name 'Lady Gaga' will forever be synonymous with culture-shifting music videos\" [342]\n\n\nPublic image\nPublic reception of her music, fashion sense, and persona is polarized Because of her influence on modern culture, and her rise to global fame, sociologist Mathieu Deflem of the University of South Carolina has offered a course titled \"Lady Gaga and the Sociology of the Fame\" since early 2011 with the objective of unraveling \"some of the sociologically relevant dimensions of the fame of Lady Gaga\" [354] When Gaga met briefly with then-president Barack Obama at a Human Rights Campaign fundraiser, he found the interaction \"intimidating\" as she was dressed in 16-inch (40 cm) heels, making her the tallest woman in the room [355] When interviewed by Barbara Walters for her annual ABC News special 10 Most Fascinating People in 2009, Gaga dismissed the claim that she is intersex as an urban legend Responding to a question on this issue, she expressed her fondness for androgyny [356]\n\n\nCensorship\nIn 2011, lyrics of Gaga's song \"Born This Way\", which reference homosexuality and LGBT subjects, were censored by Malaysian broadcaster AMP Radio Networks as a precaution against government restrictions against songs which might violate \"good taste or decency or  [are] offensive to public feeling\" [371] The same year, the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China, reportedly enforcing a directive designed to tackle \"poor taste and vulgar content\", banned the publication of six of Gaga's songs from the album Born This Way on all Chinese music websites [372] [373]\n\n\nActivism\nAfter declining an invitation to appear on the single \"We Are the World 25 for Haiti\", because of rehearsals for her tour, to benefit victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Gaga donated the proceeds of her January 2010 Radio City Music Hall concert to the country's reconstruction relief fund [380] All profits from her online store that day were also donated, and Gaga announced that $500,000 was collected for the fund [381] Hours after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami hit Japan, Gaga tweeted a link to Japan Prayer Bracelets All revenue from a bracelet she designed in conjunction with the company was donated to relief efforts; [382] these raised $1.5 million [383] In June 2011, Gaga performed at MTV Japan's charity show in Makuhari Messe, which benefited the Japanese Red Cross [384]\n\n\nPhilanthropy\nAfter declining an invitation to appear on the single \"We Are the World 25 for Haiti\", because of rehearsals for her tour, to benefit victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Gaga donated the proceeds of her January 2010 Radio City Music Hall concert to the country's reconstruction relief fund [380] All profits from her online store that day were also donated, and Gaga announced that $500,000 was

album Media proprietor Oprah Winfrey, writer Deepak Chopra, and US Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius spoke at the foundation's inauguration at Harvard University [395] The foundation's original funding included $1.2 million from Gaga, $500,000 from the MacArthur Foundation, and $850,000 from Barneys New York [396] In July 2012, the BTWF partnered with Office Depot for a series of limited edition back-to-school products, with 25% of its sales going towards the foundation, for a guaranteed donation of $1 million [397] The foundation's initiatives have included the \"Born Brave Bus\" that followed Gaga on tour as a youth drop-in center as an initiative against bullying [398] [399]\n\n\nLGBT advocacy\nA bisexual woman, [d] Gaga has been actively supporting LGBT rights worldwide [413] She has attributed much of her early success as a mainstream artist to her gay fans and is considered a gay icon [414] [415] Early in her career, Gaga had difficulty getting radio airplay, and stated: \"The turning point for me was the gay community.\" [416] She thanked FlyLife, a Manhattan-based LGBTQ marketing company which worked with her label Interscope at the time, in the liner notes of The Fame [417] One of her first televised performances was in May 2008 at the NewNowNext Awards, an awards show aired by the LGBT television network Logo [418]\n\n\nLegacy\nGaga

The service has undergone a series of updates and changes since its original release, with the goal of making it easier for teachers to manage their classes and for students to complete their assignments.\n\n**History**\n\nGoogle Classroom has undergone a series of updates and changes since its original release in May 2014. Initially, the service was only available to schools with a Google for Education account, but it later became available to all educators and students. In 2015, Google introduced mobile apps for iOS and Android devices, making it easier for teachers and students to access their classes on the go. In 2020, Google introduced the Originality Report, a built-in plagiarism detection tool that allows teachers to verify the academic integrity of student submissions.\n\n**Features**\n\nGoogle Classroom integrates several Google Applications for Education, such as Google Drive, Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Slides, Google Forms, Google Sites, and Gmail. A Google Calendar integration was later added to the platform, allowing teachers to schedule assignments and events. Students can be invited to classrooms through the institution's database, through a private code that can then be added in the student's user interface, or automatically imported from a school domain. Each class created with Google Classroom creates a separate folder in the respective user's Google Drive, where the student can submit work to be graded by a teacher.\n\n**Assignments**\n\nAssignments are stored and graded on Google's document applications. Rather than sharing documents that reside on the student's Google Drive with the teacher, files are hosted on the student's Drive and then submitted for grading. Teachers on Google Classroom have the option of creating Assignments in various templates and formats with different accessibility options, such as permissions to view, edit, and comment. These assignments can be submitted for a grade and allow the teacher to provide feedback. Students may also attach additional documents from their Drive to their assignment.\n\n**Grading**\n\nGoogle Classroom supports different grading schemes. Turned in assignments can be graded by teachers and returned with comments before the final submission, allowing for the students to modify their work. Once turned in, assignments can only be edited by the teacher.\n\n**Communication**\n\nAnnouncements can be posted by teachers to a \"class stream\" which can be commented on by students. Students may also post to the class class stream, although teachers retain a moderator role. Multiple types of media from Google products such as YouTube videos and Google Drive files can be attached to announcements and posts to share content. Gmail also provides email options for teachers to send emails to one or more students in the Google Classroom interface.\n\n**Originality Report**\n\nIntroduced in 2020, the Originality Report is a built-in plagiarism detection tool that both students and teachers can access. Teachers can view the originality report, allowing them to verify the academic integrity of the student's submitted work. On the free version of G Suite for Education, teachers can turn on originality report for 3 assignments but have limited cloud storage. This restriction is lifted on the paid version of G Suite Enterprise for Education.\n\n**Archive Courses**\n\nClassroom allows instructors to archive courses at the end of a term or year. When a course is archived, it is removed from the homepage and placed in the Archived Classes area. When a course is archived, teachers and students can view it, but are unable to make any changes unless it is restored.\n\n**Mobile Applications**\n\nGoogle Classroom mobile apps, introduced in January 2015, are available for iOS and Android devices. These apps allow teachers and students to access their classes on the go, making it easier to stay organized and communicate with each other.\n\n**Reception**\n\nEase of use, universal device accessibility, Google Drive integration, and the ability of teachers and students alike to quickly share content and feedback have been highlighted as strengths of Google Classroom. Among Classroom's disadvantages, a review highlighted the service's heavy integration of Google apps and services with limited or no support for external files or services, lack of automated quizzes and tests, and a lack of live chats that can aid in feedback efforts.\n\n**Criticism**\n\nAs a company, Google has been criticized on several different issues, including privacy. Specific criticism of Google Classroom generally focuses on concern for privacy for students and Google's use of student data. Criticism of Google Classroom is often combined with criticism of Chromebooks and Google Workspace.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Google_Classroom\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nGoogle Classroom has undergone a series of updates and changes since its original release in May 2014 \n\n\nFeatures\nGoogle Classroom integrates several Google Applications for Education, such as Google Drive, Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Slides, Google Forms, Google Sites, and Gmail [20] A Google Calendar integration was later added to the platform [21] Students can be invited to classrooms through the institution's database, through a private code that can then be added in the student's user interface, or automatically imported from a school domain [22] Each class created with Google Classroom creates a separate folder in the respective user's Google Drive, where the student can submit work to be graded by a teacher [23]\n\n\nAssignments\nAssignments are stored and graded on Google's document applications Rather than sharing documents that reside on the student's Google Drive with the teacher, files are hosted on the student's Drive and then submitted for grading Teachers on Google Classroom have the option of creating Assignments in various templates and formats with different accessibility options, such as permissions to view, edit, and comment These assignments can be submitted for a grade and allow the teacher to provide feedback [24] Students may also attach additional documents from their Drive to their assignment.\n\n\nGrading\nGoogle Classroom supports different grading schemes Turned in assignments can be graded by teachers and returned with comments before the final submission, allowing for the students to modify their work Once turned in, assignments can only be edited by the teacher [25]\n\n\nCommunication\nAnnouncements can be posted by teachers to a \"class stream\" which can be commented on by students [23] Students may also post to the class class stream, although teachers retain a moderator role Multiple types of media from Google products such as YouTube videos and Google Drive files can be attached to announcements and posts to share content Gmail also provides email options for teachers to send emails to one or more students in the Google Classroom interface \n\n\nOriginality Report\nIntroduced in 2020, Originality Report is a built-in plagiarism detection tool which both students and teachers can access Teachers can view the originality report, allowing them to verify the academic integrity of the student's submitted work On the free version of G Suite for Education, teachers can turn on originality report for 3 assignments but have limited cloud storage [26] This restriction is lifted on the paid version of G Suite Enterprise for Education [27]\n\n\nArchive Courses\nClassroom allows instructors to archive courses at the end of a term or year When a course is archived, it is removed from the homepage and placed in the Archived Classes area When a course is archived, teachers and students can view it, but are unable to make any changes unless it is restored [28]\n\n\nMobile Applications\nGoogle Classroom mobile apps, introduced in January 2015, are available for iOS and Android devices   \n\n\nReception\nEase of use, universal device accessibility, Google Drive integration, and the ability of teachers and students alike to quickly share content and feedback have been highlighted as strengths Among Classroom's disadvantages, a review highlighted the service's heavy integration of Google apps and services with limited or no support for external files or services, lack of automated quizzes and tests, and a lack of live chats that can aid in feedback efforts [29] Google Classroom won a 2020 Webby Special Achievement Award [30]\n\n\nCriticism\nAs a company, Google has been criticized on several different issues, including privacy Specific criticism of Google Classroom generally focuses on concern for privacy for students and Google's use of student data [31] [32] Criticism of Google Classroom is often combined with criticism of Chromebooks and Google Workspace [33] [34]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

control of the island would open the Mediterranean Sea to Allied shipping and allow the invasion of continental Europe through Italy [17] The second option was to go into Greece and the Balkans, to trap the German forces between the British and American invaders and the Soviets [18] [19] [n 4] At the Casablanca Conference in January 1943, Allied planners agreed on the selection of Sicily – codenamed Operation Husky – and decided to undertake the invasion no later than July [21] There was concern among the Allied planners that Sicily was an obvious choice – Churchill is reputed to have said \"Everyone but a bloody fool would know that it's Sicily\" [17] – and that the build-up of resources for the invasion would be detected [22]\n\n\nDevelopment\nMontagu and Cholmondeley were assisted by an MI6 representative, Major Frank Foley, as they examined the practicalities of the plan [27] Montagu approached the pathologist Sir Bernard Spilsbury to determine what kind of body they needed and what factors they would need to take into account to fool a Spanish pathologist Spilsbury informed him that those who died in an air crash often did so from shock and not drowning; the lungs would not necessarily be filled with water He added that \"Spaniards, as Roman Catholics, were averse to post-mortems and did not hold them unless the cause of death was of great importance\" [28] Spilsbury advised that a person could have suffered one of many different causes of death, which could be misconstrued in an autopsy Montagu later wrote\n\n\nExamining the practicalities; locating a corpse\nMontagu and Cholmondeley were assisted by an MI6 representative, Major Frank Foley, as they examined the practicalities of the plan [27] Montagu approached the pathologist Sir Bernard Spilsbury to determine what kind of body they needed and what factors they would need to take into account to fool a Spanish pathologist Spilsbury informed him that those who died in an air crash often did so from shock and not drowning;

one of these corpses was purportedly used [40] The military historian Denis Smyth dismisses the suggestion and observes that the official records of the operation state that Glyndwr Michael was the body [41]\n\n\nDeveloping the plan; the corpse's new identity\nMontagu selected the code name Mincemeat from a list of centrally held available possibilities [42] [n 5] On 4 February 1943 Montagu and Cholmondeley filed their plan for the operation with the Twenty Committee; it was a re-working of Cholmondeley's Trojan Horse plan The Mincemeat plan was to place documents on the corpse, and then float it off the coast of Spain, whose nominally neutral government was known to co-operate with the Abwehr, the German military intelligence organisation [43] The plan was passed by the committee, who passed it up the chain of command to the senior Allied strategists; Montagu and Cholmondeley were ordered to continue with their preparations for the operation [44]\n\n\nDeception documents\nMontagu outlined three criteria for the document that contained the details of the falsified plans to land in the Balkans He said that the target should be casually but clearly identified, that it should name Sicily and another location as cover, [n 10] and that it should be in an unofficial correspondence that would not normally be sent by diplomatic courier, or encoded signal [65]\n\n\nTechnical considerations; strategic approval\nMontagu and Cholmondeley gave consideration to the location of the corpse's delivery It had long been assumed by the pair that the western coast of Spain would be the ideal location Early in the planning they investigated the possibility of Portuguese and French coasts, but rejected those in favour of Huelva on the coast of southern Spain, after advice was taken from the Hydrographer of the Navy regarding the tides and currents best suited to ensure the body landed where it was wanted [35] [77] Montagu later outlined that the choice of Huelva was also made because \"there was a very active German agent .. who had excellent contacts with certain Spaniards, both officials and others\" [78] The agent – Adolf Clauss, a member of the Abwehr – was the son of the German consul, and operated under the cover of an agriculture technician; he was an efficient and effective operative Huelva was also chosen because the British vice-consul in the city, Francis Haselden, was \"a reliable and helpful man\" who could be relied upon, according to Montagu [79]\n\n\nExecution\nIn the early hours of 17 April 1943 the corpse of Michael was dressed as Martin, although there was one last-minute hitch: the feet had frozen Purchase, Montagu and Cholmondeley could not put the boots on, so an electric heater was located and the feet defrosted enough to put the boots on properly The pocket litter was placed on the body, and the briefcase attached [86] The body was placed in the canister, which was filled with 21 pounds (9.5 kg) of dry ice and sealed up When the dry ice sublimated, it filled the canister with carbon dioxide and drove out any oxygen, thus preserving the body without refrigeration The canister was placed in the 1937 Fordson van of an MI5 driver, St John \"Jock\" Horsfall, who had been a racing champion before the war Cholmondeley and Montagu travelled in the back of the van, which drove through the night to Greenock, west Scotland, where the canister was taken on board the submarine HMS Seraph, which was preparing for a deployment to the Mediterranean [87] [88] Seraph's commander, Lt Bill Jewell, and crew had previous special operations experience Jewell told his men that the canister contained a top secret meteorological device to be deployed near Spain [89] [90]\n\n\nSpanish handling of the corpse and the ramifications\nThe body of \"Major Martin\" was found at around 9:30 am on 30 April 1943 by a local fisherman; [n 12] it was taken to Huelva by Spanish soldiers, where it was handed over to a naval judge Haselden, as vice-consul, was officially informed by the Spaniards; he reported back to the Admiralty that the body and briefcase had been found A series of pre-scripted diplomatic cables were sent between Haselden and his superiors, which continued for several days The British knew that these were being intercepted and, although they were encrypted, the Germans had broken the code; the messages played out the story that it was imperative that Haselden retrieve the briefcase because it was important [96]\n\n\nGerman reaction\nOn 14 May 1943 Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz met Hitler to discuss Dönitz's recent visit to Italy, his meeting with the Italian leader Benito Mussolini and the progress of the war The Admiral, referring to the Mincemeat documents as the \"Anglo-Saxon order\", recorded\n\n\nAftermath\nOn 25 July 1943, as the battle for Sicily went against the Axis forces, the Italian Grand Council of Fascism voted to limit the power of Mussolini, and handed control of the Italian armed forces over to King Victor Emmanuel III The following day Mussolini met the King, who dismissed him as prime minister; the former dictator was then imprisoned A new Italian government took power and began secret negotiations with the Allies [118] Sicily fell on 17 August [119] after a force of 65,000 Germans held off 400,000 American and British troops long enough to allow many of the Germans to evacuate to the Italian mainland [120]\n\n\nLegacy\nMontagu was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1944 for his part in Operation Mincemeat; [15] for masterminding the plan, Cholmondeley was appointed a Member of the Order in 1948 [126] Duff Cooper, a former cabinet minister who had been briefed on the operation in March 1943, published the spy novel Operation Heartbreak (1950), which contained the plot device of a corpse – with papers naming him as William Maryngton – being floated off the coast of Spain with false documents to deceive the Germans [127] The British security services decided that the best response was to publish the story of Mincemeat Over the course of a weekend Montagu wrote The Man Who Never Was (1953), which sold two million copies and formed the basis for a 1956 film [15] [128] The security services did not give Montagu complete freedom to reveal operational details, and he was careful not to mention the role played by signals intelligence to confirm that the operation had been successful He was also careful to obscure \"the idea of an organised programme of strategic deception .. with Mincemeat being presented as a 'wild' one-off caper\" [129] In 1977 Montagu published Beyond Top Secret U, his wartime autobiography which gave further details of Mincemeat, among other operations [15] In 2010 the journalist Ben Macintyre published Operation Mincemeat, a history of the events [130]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes and references\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Operation Mincemeat**\n\nOperation Mincemeat was a deception operation conducted by the British during World War II. It was a plan to deceive the German military into believing that the Allied invasion of Europe would take place at the Greek port of Taranto, rather than the actual target of Sicily. The operation involved creating a fake identity for a British officer who would be washed up on the coast of Spain, carrying documents that outlined the planned invasion.\n\n**Background**\n\nIn September 1939, at the start of the Second World War, Rear Admiral John Godfrey, the Director of Naval Intelligence, circulated a paper known as the Trout memo. The memo compared the deception of an enemy in wartime to fly fishing.

Number 28 on the list was titled \"A Suggestion (not a very nice one)\". It was an idea to plant misleading papers on a corpse that would be found by the enemy.\n\n**British Intelligence and the inspiration for the plan**\n\nA month after the Turner crash, the British intelligence officer Charles Cholmondeley outlined his own variation of the Trout memo plan, codenamed Trojan Horse. His plan was to create a fake identity for a British officer who would be washed up on the coast of Spain, carrying documents that outlined the planned invasion.

[4] it was an idea to plant misleading papers on a corpse that would be found by the enemy.\n\n\nBritish Intelligence and the inspiration for the plan\nA month after the Turner crash, the British intelligence officer Charles Cholmondeley [n 2] outlined his own variation of the Trout memo plan, codenamed Trojan Horse, after the Achaean deception from the Trojan War His plan was:\n\n\nMilitary situation\nIn late 1942, with the Allied success in the North African campaign, military planners turned their attention to the next target British planners considered that an invasion of France from Britain could not take place until 1944 and the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, wanted to use the Allied forces from North Africa to attack Europe's \"soft underbelly\" There were two possible targets for the Allies to attack The first option was Sicily; control of the island would open the Mediterranean Sea to Allied shipping and allow the invasion of continental Europe through Italy [17] The second option was to go into Greece and the Balkans, to trap the German forces between the British and American invaders and the Soviets [18] [19] [n 4] At the Casablanca Conference in January 1943, Allied planners agreed on the selection of Sicily – codenamed Operation Husky – and decided to undertake the invasion no later than July [21] There was concern among the Allied planners that Sicily was an obvious choice – Churchill is reputed to have said \"Everyone but a bloody fool would know that it's Sicily\" [17] – and that the build-up of resources for the invasion would be detected [22]\n\n\nDevelopment\nMontagu and Cholmondeley were assisted by an MI6 representative, Major Frank Foley, as they examined the practicalities of the plan [27] Montagu approached the pathologist Sir Bernard Spilsbury to determine what kind of body they needed and what factors they would need to take into account to fool a Spanish pathologist Spilsbury informed him that those who died in an air crash often did so from shock and not drowning; the lungs would not necessarily be filled with water He added that \"Spaniards, as Roman Catholics, were averse to post-mortems and did not hold them unless the cause of death was of great importance\" [28] Spilsbury advised that a person could have suffered one of many different causes of death, which could be misconstrued in an autopsy Montagu later wrote\n\n\nExamining the practicalities; locating a corpse\nMontagu and Cholmondeley were assisted by an MI6 representative, Major Frank Foley, as they examined the practicalities of the plan [27] Montagu approached the pathologist Sir Bernard Spilsbury to determine what kind of body they needed and what factors they would need to take into account to fool a Spanish pathologist Spilsbury informed him that those who died in an air crash often did so from shock and not drowning; the lungs would not necessarily be filled with water He added that \"Spaniards, as Roman Catholics, were averse to post-mortems and did not hold them unless the cause of death was of great importance\" [28] Spilsbury advised that a person could have suffered one of many different causes of death, which could be misconstrued in an autopsy Montagu later wrote\n\n\nIdentity of the corpse\nMontagu refused to identify the individual and only described him as \"a bit of a ne'er-do-well, and that the only worthwhile thing that he ever did he did after his death\" [37] In 1996 Roger Morgan, an amateur historian from London, uncovered evidence in the Public Record Office that the identity of the corpse was Michael [38] [39] An alternative theory to the corpse's identity was suggested in the history book The Secrets of HMS Dasher (2004) that in March 1943 there was an explosion on HMS Dasher, which sank, killing 379 men; one of these corpses was purportedly used [40] The military historian Denis Smyth dismisses the suggestion and observes that the official records of the operation state that Glyndwr Michael was the body [41]\n\n\nDeveloping the plan; the corpse's new identity\nMontagu selected the code name Mincemeat from a list of centrally held available possibilities [42] [n 5] On 4 February 1943 Montagu and Cholmondeley filed their plan for the operation with the Twenty Committee; it was a re-working of Cholmondeley's Trojan Horse plan The Mincemeat plan was to place documents on the corpse, and then float it off the coast of Spain, whose nominally neutral government was known to co-operate with the Abwehr, the German military intelligence organisation [43] The plan was passed by the committee, who passed it up the chain of command to the senior Allied strategists; Montagu and Cholmondeley were ordered to continue with their preparations for the operation [44]\n\n\nDeception documents\nMontagu outlined three criteria for the document that contained the details of the falsified plans to land in the Balkans He said that the target should be casually but clearly identified, that it should name Sicily and another location as cover, [n 10] and that it should be in an unofficial correspondence that would not normally be sent by diplomatic courier, or encoded signal [65]\n\n\nTechnical considerations; strategic approval\nMontagu and Cholmondeley gave consideration to the location of the corpse's delivery It had long been assumed by the pair that the western coast of Spain would be the ideal location Early in the planning they investigated the possibility of Portuguese and French coasts, but rejected those in favour of Huelva on the coast of southern Spain, after advice was taken from the Hydrographer of the Navy regarding the tides and currents best suited to ensure the body landed where it was wanted [35] [77] Montagu later outlined that the choice of Huelva was also made because \"there was a very active German agent .. who had excellent contacts with certain Spaniards, both officials and others\" [78] The agent – Adolf Clauss, a member of the Abwehr – was the son of the German consul, and operated under the cover of an agriculture technician; he was an efficient and effective operative Huelva was also chosen because the British vice-consul in the city, Francis Haselden, was \"a reliable and helpful man\" who could be relied upon, according to Montagu [79]\n\n\nExecution\nIn the early hours of 17 April 1943 the corpse of Michael was dressed as Martin, although there was one last-minute hitch: the feet had frozen Purchase, Montagu and Cholmondeley could not put the boots on, so an electric heater was located and the feet defrosted enough to put the boots on properly The pocket litter was placed on the body, and the briefcase attached [86] The body was placed in the canister, which was filled with 21 pounds (9.5 kg) of dry ice and sealed up When the dry ice sublimated, it filled the canister with carbon dioxide and drove out any oxygen, thus preserving the body without refrigeration The canister was placed in the 1937 Fordson van of an MI5 driver, St John \"Jock\" Horsfall, who had been a racing champion before the war Cholmondeley and Montagu travelled in the back of the van, which drove through the night to Greenock, west Scotland, where the canister was taken on board the submarine HMS Seraph, which was preparing for a deployment to the Mediterranean [87] [88] Seraph's commander, Lt Bill Jewell, and crew had previous special operations experience Jewell told his men that the canister contained a top secret meteorological device to be deployed near Spain [89] [90]\n\n\nSpanish handling of the corpse and the ramifications\nThe body of \"Major Martin\" was found at around 9:30 am on 30 April 1943 by a local fisherman; [n 12] it was taken to Huelva by Spanish soldiers, where it was handed over to a naval judge Haselden, as vice-consul, was officially informed by the Spaniards; he reported back to the Admiralty that the body and briefcase had been found A series of pre-scripted diplomatic cables were sent between Haselden and his superiors, which continued for several days The British knew that these were being intercepted and, although they were encrypted, the Germans had broken the code; the messages played out the story that it was imperative that Haselden retrieve the briefcase because it was important [96]\n\n\nGerman reaction\nOn 14 May 1943 Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz met Hitler to discuss Dönitz's recent visit to Italy, his meeting with the Italian leader Benito Mussolini and the progress of the war The Admiral, referring to the Mincemeat documents as the \"Anglo-Saxon order\", recorded\n\n\nAftermath\nOn 25 July 1943, as the battle for Sicily went against the Axis forces, the Italian Grand Council of Fascism voted to limit the power of Mussolini, and handed control of the Italian armed forces over to King Victor Emmanuel III The following day Mussolini met the King, who dismissed him as prime minister; the former dictator was then imprisoned A new Italian government took power and began secret negotiations with the Allies [118] Sicily fell on 17 August [119] after a force of 65,000 Germans held off 400,000 American and British troops long enough to allow many of the Germans to evacuate to the Italian mainland [120]\n\n\nLegacy\nMontagu was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1944 for his part in Operation Mincemeat; [15] for masterminding the plan, Cholmondeley was appointed a Member of the Order in 1948 [126] Duff Cooper, a former cabinet minister who had been briefed on the operation in March 1943, published the spy novel Operation Heartbreak (1950), which contained the plot device of a corpse – with papers naming him as William Maryngton – being floated off the coast of Spain with false documents to deceive the Germans [127] The British security services decided that the best response was to publish the story of Mincemeat Over the course of a weekend Montagu wrote The Man Who Never Was (1953), which sold two million copies and formed the basis for a 1956 film [15] [128] The security services did not give Montagu complete freedom to reveal operational details, and he was careful not to mention the role played by signals intelligence to confirm that the operation had been successful He was also careful to obscure \"the idea of an organised programme of strategic deception .. with Mincemeat being presented as a 'wild' one-off caper\" [129] In 1977 Montagu published Beyond Top Secret U, his wartime autobiography which gave further details of Mincemeat, among other operations [15] In 2010 the journalist Ben Macintyre published Operation Mincemeat, a history of the events [130]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes and references\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born on 16 September 1976, Meena began her career as a child artist and has since established herself as one of the most popular and successful actresses in the South Indian film industry.\n\n# Early Life\nMeena was born on 16 September 1976 in Chennai (then Madras), Tamil Nadu. Her mother, Rajamallika, is from the Kannur district of Kerala, while her father, Durairaj, is from Andhra Pradesh. Meena's early life was marked by her entry into the film industry as a child artist, which would go on to shape her career and destiny.\n\n# Career\nMeena's career in the film industry began in 1982 when she was just six years old. She made her debut as a child artist in the film Nenjangal, which featured Sivaji Ganesan in the lead role. Meena's portrayal of a young girl in the film caught the attention of Sivaji Ganesan, who saw her at a birthday party and decided to cast her in his film. This marked the beginning of Meena's successful career as a child artist, with appearances in over 45 films.\n\n## Child Artist\nMeena's debut as a child artist in Nenjangal was followed by appearances in several other films, including Enkeyo Ketta Kural and Anbulla Rajinikanth. She also made her debut in Malayalam as a child artist in the film Oru Kochukatha Aarum Parayatha Katha, directed by P G Viswambharan. Meena's portrayal of a terminally ill child in Anbulla Rajinikanth is particularly noteworthy, as it showcased her acting skills and earned her critical acclaim.\n\n## Lead Female Roles\nMeena made her debut as a lead actress in the Tamil film Oru Pudhiya Kadhai in 1990, opposite Rajendra Prasad. However, it was her role in the Tamil film En Rasavin Manasile opposite Rajkiran in 1991 that brought her her first major break. Meena's portrayal of Solaiyamma in the film won her fans' hearts, and the movie was later remade in Telugu as Moratodu Naa Mogudu. Meena reprised her role in the Telugu remake, cementing her position as one of the leading actresses in the South Indian film industry.\n\n# Return to Films\nAfter a brief hiatus from films, Meena returned to the big screen in 2010 with the Kannada film Hendtheer Darbar. This was her first film after her marriage, and it marked a new chapter in her career. In 2011, Meena played the role of Narain's sister in the film Thambikottai.\n\n# Other Work\nMeena has explored other creative outlets beyond acting. She has been a playback singer for some albums with actor Manoj, and has also been a playback singer in two pop albums called 16 Vayathinile and Kadhalism. Meena began recording the pop albums in 2001 with actor Vikram.\n\n# Music Composing\nMeena has also dabbled in music composing, though it remains a relatively lesser-known aspect of her career. Her experience as a playback singer has likely influenced her approach to music composing.\n\n# Dubbing\nIn addition to her acting and singing credits, Meena has also worked as a dubbing artist. She dubbed for Padmapriya Janakiraman in Cheran's movie Pokkisham.\n\n# Personal Life\nMeena married Vidyasagar, a Bangalore-based software engineer, on 12 July 2009 at Arya Vysya Samaj Kalyana Mandapam. The couple has a daughter, Nainika, who made her acting debut at the age of 5 in the film Theri (2016).

at all [34] [35] [13] This group represents a spectrum of identities that diverge from conventional gender norms According to scholar Finn Enke, not all agender individuals may self-identify as transgender [36] While there is no universally accepted set of pronouns for agender people, singular they is commonly used, but it is not the default [37] Notably, \"Agender\" and \"Neutrois\" were among the custom gender options added to Facebook in February 2014 and to OkCupid since November 2014 [38] [39]\n\n\nAgender\nAgender individuals, also known as genderless, gender-free, non-gendered,

\"Agender\" and \"Neutrois\" were among the custom gender options added to Facebook in February 2014 and to OkCupid since November 2014 [38] [39]\n\n\nMultigender/polygender\nThese terms describe individuals who experience more than one gender identity, either simultaneously or alternately This category includes identities such as demigender, bigender, pangender, and genderfluid [40] [41] In contrast, those who experience a singular, unchanging gender are referred to as monogender or genderstatic [42]\n\n\nBigender\n\n\nDemigender\nIndividuals identifying as demigender feel a partial connection to one gender while also identifying with another gender or none at all (agender) [53] [54] Subcategories include demi-boy or demi-man, who partially identify as male, and demi-girl, who are partly female and partly non-binary Demiflux people experience a stable non-binary identity with varying intensities of other gender identities [54]\n\n\nPangender\nPangender individuals identify with multiple or all genders, sometimes experiencing all these identities simultaneously [55] [56]\n\n\nGenderfluid\nGenderfluid individuals do not adhere to a fixed gender identity; their genders change depending on time, place and situation, combining elements from one or more genders at different times [57] [58] This identity can overlap with bigender, trigender, polygender or pangender expressions [7] [8]\n\n\nTransfeminine or transmasculine\nTransfeminine refers to individuals assigned male at birth who predominantly identify or express themselves as feminine Transmasculine refers to those assigned female at birth who predominantly identify or express themselves as masculine These terms encompass both binary and non-binary identities [59]\n\n\nTwo-spirit\nOriginating from a 1990 Indigenous LGBT gathering in Winnipeg, the term Two-spirit refers to individuals within Indigenous North American communities who embody qualities or fulfill roles across traditional gender distinctions [60]\n\n\nXenogender\nXenogender encompasses a variety of gender identities that are defined using non-traditional concepts often drawn from natural, inanimate, or abstract sources, representing a departure from the typical human gender binary [61] [62] People who identify with a xenogender may not have the words to describe their gender, so instead they compare it to something else [63]\n\n\nOther identities\nThis includes identities such as maverique, aporagender, ambigender, intergender, and genderflux, each presenting unique perspectives and experiences outside conventional gender norms [59]\n\n\nHistory\nNon-binary gender, often included within the concept of third gender, has historical roots that extend well before the modern term was established [67] For instance, the Public Universal Friend, who emerged in 1776, was a genderless evangelist who renounced their birth name and gendered pronouns, representing an early instance of non-binary gender expression in America [68] [69] [70]\n\n\nPronouns and titles\nMany non-binary people use gender-neutral pronouns with the singular \"they\", \"their\" and \"them\" being used most commonly in English Some non-binary individuals opt for neopronouns such as xe, ze, sie, co, and ey [85] [86] [87] [88] Others may use traditional gender-specific pronouns such as \"he\" or \"she\", switch between them, or prefer to use their name without pronouns [89] The title Mx is also increasingly used as a gender-neutral honorific [90] [91]\n\n\nLegal recognition\nMany non-binary/genderqueer people use the gender they were given at birth to conduct everyday business, as many institutions and forms of identification—such as passports and driver's licenses—only accept, in the sense of recorded recognition, binary gender identities But with the increasing acceptance of non-binary gender identities and the rise in wider societal recognition, this is slowly changing, as more governments and institutions recognize and allow non-binary identities [2]\n\n\nDiscrimination\nVarious countries throughout history have criminalized transgender and non-binary gender identities [103] [104]\n\n\nHealthcare\nNonbinary people may report significantly less well-being and overall health than binary transgender people, although current research demonstrates conflicting perspectives on this topic [109] These health disparities may be exacerbated by minority stress by breaking gender and social norms [110] [111]\n\n\nTransgender health care\nSome nonbinary people desire gender-affirming health care, including hormone replacement therapy or surgery [116] Others do not, [117] and the ratio of those who desire care to those who do not is unclear The factors that lead to this decision are complex and unique to each person [118]\n\n\nMental health care\nNonbinary people are likely to face more mental stress than binary transgender people [92] [120] This can be for many reasons including worse mental health and being discouraged from using the bathroom of their choice According to the Trevor Project, 54% of non-binary and transgender youth have considered suicide and 58% have been discouraged from using the bathroom corresponding to their gender identity [121]\n\n\nSymbols and observances\nMany flags have been used in non-binary and genderqueer communities to represent various identities There are distinct non-binary and genderqueer pride flags The genderqueer pride flag was designed in 2011 by Marilyn Roxie Lavender represents androgyny or queerness, white represents agender identity, and green represents those whose identities which are defined outside the binary [124] [125] [126] The non-binary pride flag was created in 2014 by Kye Rowan [127] Yellow represents people whose gender exists outside the binary, purple represents those whose gender is a mixture of—or between—male and female, black represents people who have no gender, and white represents those who embrace many or all genders [128]\n\n\nPopulation figures\nOn July 20, 2021, President Alberto Fernández signed Decreto 476/2021, mandating that the National Registry of Persons (RENAPER) allow a third gender option on all national identity cards and passports, marked as \"X\" The measure also applies to non-citizen permanent residents who possess Argentine identity cards [140] The 2022 national census, carried out less than a year after the resolution was implemented, counted 8,293 (roughly 0.12%) of the country's population identifying with the \"X / other\" gender

pipe by her blouse [27]\n\n\nNight Stalker crimes\nOn June 28, 1984, 79-year-old Jennie Vincow was found murdered in her apartment in Glassell Park, Los Angeles She had been stabbed repeatedly in the head, neck and chest while asleep in her bed, and her throat slashed so deeply that she was nearly decapitated [30] Ramirez's fingerprint was found on a mesh screen he removed to gain access through an open window [31] This, his second known murder, established his pattern of breaking into homes, committing particularly vicious murders, and frequently burglarizing his victims either before or after killing them, which was mainly to support his drug addiction and pay his rent [32] [31]\n\n\nSuspected victims\nOn the night of June 27, 1985, 32-year-old Patty Elaine Higgins was murdered in her Arcadia home The crime was not discovered until July 2, when she failed to show up for work [84] Her attacker had sodomized her, strangled her, and slashed her throat [85] Ramirez was charged with murder and burglary in relation to Higgins' death However, these charges were eventually dropped due to a lack of concrete physical evidence linking Higgins to the other murders [85]\n\n\nIdentification of Ramirez\nErickson gave a detailed description of her assailant to investigators, [88] and police obtained a cast of Ramirez' footprint from the Romero house [78] The stolen Toyota was found abandoned on August 28 in Koreatown, Los Angeles, and police obtained a single fingerprint from the rear-view mirror despite Ramirez' careful efforts to wipe the car clean of his prints [89] The print was positively identified as belonging to Ramirez, who was described by police as a 25-year-old drifter from Texas, with a long rap sheet that included many arrests for traffic and illegal drug violations [90] The identification of Ramirez's print was described as a \"near miracle\" as the system used to identify him was recently installed, as well as the fact that the system contained the fingerprints of criminals born after January 1, 1960, only two months before Ramirez was born [91]\n\n\nCapture\nOn August 30, 1985, Ramirez took a bus to Tucson, Arizona, to visit his brother, unaware that he had become the lead story in virtually every major newspaper and television news program across California [93] [94] After failing to meet his brother due to his not being home, [95] he returned to Los Angeles early on the morning of August 31 [96] He walked past police officers, who were staking out the bus terminal in hopes of catching the killer should he attempt to flee on an outbound bus, and into a convenience store in East Los Angeles [97]\n\n\nTrial and conviction\nJury selection for Ramirez's trial began on July 22, 1988 At his first court appearance, he raised a hand with a pentagram drawn on it and yelled, \"Hail Satan!\" [100] On August 3, 1988, the Los Angeles Times reported that some jail employees overheard Ramirez planning to shoot the prosecutor with a gun, which he intended to have smuggled into the courtroom [101] Consequently, a metal detector was installed outside and intensive searches were conducted on people entering.\n\n\nIncarceration and death\nWhile awaiting trial, Ramirez reportedly met actor Sean Penn Penn, who was jailed for 33 days in 1987 for reckless driving and assault of an extra on Colors (1988), claimed to receive a letter from Ramirez as a fellow inmate, to which he wrote back telling Ramirez he had no sympathy and hoped he died in the gas chamber [107]\n\n\nIn popular

{"title": "Sam_Gilliam", "content": "\nEarly life and education\nSam Gilliam Jr was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, on November 30, 1933, [7] the seventh of eight children born to Sam Gilliam Sr and Estery Gilliam [8] The Gilliam family moved to Louisville, Kentucky, in 1942 [13] Gilliam said that his father \"did everything,\" working variously as a farmer, janitor, and deacon, in addition to being a hobbyist carpenter; [14] his mother was a school teacher, cared for the large family, [7] and was an active member of the neighborhood sewing group [13] At a young age, Gilliam wanted to be a cartoonist and spent most of his time drawing [15] with encouragement from his mother [16] As an adult, Gilliam recalled that creativity was an essential part of his home life as a child: \"Almost all of my family members used their hands to create .. In this atmosphere of construction, I too began to flourish.\" [13] Throughout his middle and high school education he participated in school-sponsored specialized art programs [7] He attended Central High School in Louisville, and graduated in 1951 [17]\n\n\nLife and career\nOn arriving in Washington in 1962, Gilliam and Butler rented an apartment in the Adams Morgan neighborhood [24] Gilliam tried to enroll in painting courses at American University under artist Robert Gates, a painting professor interested in the same Bay Area Figurative style, but Gates declined, saying Gilliam would not gain much from being his student [34] Gilliam was also turned down for a teaching position at Howard University by art department chair James Porter; according to Gilliam, Porter said he was \"too 'passionate' a painter to be worried about teaching,\" and recommended Gilliam teach at a local high school instead to allow for more time to make and exhibit art [34] Binstock [note 1] suggested that Porter's rejection of Gilliam may have also been due to Gilliam's abstract figurative style clashing with Porter's view of the school's direction, during the era's cultural shifts and social movements, including the Black power movement, which were manifesting in art as a clear, declarative, and often overtly political aesthetic: \"Gilliam's somewhat ethereal and apparently raceless figures may have seemed irrelevant to Porter.\" [34] Gilliam followed Porter's advice – and that of his college professors [18] – to become a high school teacher, teaching art at D.C.'s McKinley Technical High School for five years, eventually becoming close with Porter as a friend and colleague [34] As an art teacher, Gilliam could dedicate time to his own art on the weekdays reserved for his students' academic classes, [18] renting a painting studio at 17th and Q St NW near Dupont Circle [35] [36]\n\n\n1960s\nOn arriving in Washington in 1962, Gilliam and Butler rented an apartment in the Adams Morgan neighborhood [24] Gilliam tried to enroll in painting courses at American University under artist Robert Gates, a painting professor interested in the same Bay Area Figurative style, but Gates declined, saying Gilliam would not gain much from being his student [34] Gilliam was also turned down for a teaching position at Howard University by art department chair James Porter; according to Gilliam, Porter said he was \"too 'passionate' a painter to be worried about teaching,\" and recommended Gilliam teach at a local high school instead to allow for more time to make and exhibit art [34] Binstock [note 1] suggested that Porter's rejection of Gilliam may have also been due to Gilliam's abstract figurative style clashing with Porter's view of the school's direction, during the era's cultural shifts and social movements, including the Black power movement, which were manifesting in art as a clear, declarative, and often overtly political aesthetic: \"Gilliam's somewhat ethereal and apparently raceless figures may have seemed irrelevant to Porter.\" [34] Gilliam followed Porter's advice – and that of his college professors [18] – to become a high school teacher, teaching art at D.C.'s McKinley Technical High School for five years, eventually becoming close with Porter as a friend and colleague [34] As an art teacher, Gilliam could dedicate time to his own art on the weekdays reserved for his students' academic classes, [18] renting a painting studio at 17th and Q St NW near Dupont Circle [35] [36]\n\n\nEarly color field and hard-edge abstraction\nIn 1964, Gilliam began developing a series of paintings that experimented with hard-edge and color field styles, with precise geometric fields of color similar to those of Washington Color School painters like Downing, Gene Davis, Morris Louis, and Kenneth Noland, [39] who had been influenced in turn by the soak-stain painting techniques of Helen Frankenthaler [49] Binstock has argued that Gilliam's work was informed in large part by Downing and his relationship to the formation of the movement; unlike Louis and Noland, Downing had not yet been championed by art critic Clement Greenberg, [50] whose praise had been instrumental in elevating the Washington School painters [51] Downing believed the movement's strengths were broader than Greenberg's focus - the importance of the flatness of the colored shapes - and he encouraged Gilliam and others to embrace a more expansive definition of abstraction [52] While the two were close and would often have the other over for dinners with their wives, Gilliam characterized their relationship - and his relationship with other artists [53] - as competitive, later saying that Downing \"didn't influence me, he was someone that I had to beat, to compete with, which meant we hung out together.\" [54] Downing also introduced Gilliam to methods and materials used by the cohort, such as how to work with Magna acrylic resin paint which can soak into canvas rather than layering on top of it, along with a water-tension breaker, the group's so-called \"secret ingredient.\" [55] Gilliam primed his canvases with the water-tension breaker, to \"open the pores\" of the canvas, letting him mix paint colors as they soaked in, instead of mixing on a palette, giving them a translucent appearance [55] Gilliam showed his early hard-edge experiments in 1964 in his second solo exhibition at The Adams Morgan Gallery, his first show of exclusively abstract art The same year he also began teaching in the summers at the Corcoran Gallery of Art [32]\n\n\nFluid abstractions, beveled Slice paintings, and Phillips exhibition\nTo create his hard-edge paintings, Gilliam would tape over sections of unprimed canvas and use a brush or sponge to stain the uncovered portions with paint [64] [65] In 1966 he began to remove the tape before the paint had dried, allowing the colors to run fluidly together over the entire surface, as in the watercolor work Downing had first admired in 1963 [66]\n\n\nSupport from Walter Hopps and early Drape paintings\nIn 1966, curator Walter Hopps came to work for the Institute for Policy Studies, a progressive think tank; [73] in 1967 he became acting director of the WGMA, where he worked to integrate his policy ideas, refocusing the institution on local and regional living artists and building an outreach program oriented in part toward D.C.'s large black community, [90] soon offering Gilliam a space in the WGMA's new artist-in-residence program [91] This offer in December 1967, just after Gilliam's Phillips exhibition - of a $5,000 stipend and studio space in the institution's new workshop downtown with a $50,000 operations budget - led him to continue painting full time instead of returning to teaching, but the workshop did not open until April 1968 and Gilliam did not receive the stipend until June [92] Looking back on this decision, Gilliam said, \"I survived at least six months just on the promise of $5,000,\" and \"It took a lot of guts.\" [92] When the WGMA workshop opened in 1968, Gilliam shared the space with Krebs; other artists in the program included printmaker Lou Stovall, [92] who would become Gilliam's long-term colleague and collaborator [93]\n\n\n1970s\nFollowing the critical success of his early Drapes, Gilliam was invited to present his work at a number of museums and galleries in the early and mid-1970s, both creating new Drape installations and re-installing previous ones [123] In 1970, Gilliam was also hospitalized for anxiety and depression for a second time [46] In April 1971, he withdrew from a group exhibition of contemporary African-American art at New York's Whitney Museum in solidarity with a boycott organized by the Black Emergency Cultural Coalition (BECC) [124] Gilliam and other artists were frustrated with the museum, which had organized the exhibition in response to earlier BECC protests over the lack of black artists in the Whitney's programming, because they believed the curator had made only cursory attempts to contact established black curators and scholars of African-American art to help shape the exhibition [124] [125]\n\n\nNew Drape forms, national and international success, printmaking\nFollowing the critical success of his early Drapes, Gilliam was invited to present his work at a number of museums and galleries in the early and mid-1970s, both creating new Drape installations and re-installing previous ones [123] In 1970, Gilliam was also hospitalized for anxiety and depression for a second time [46] In April 1971, he withdrew from a group exhibition of contemporary African-American art at New York's Whitney Museum in solidarity with a boycott organized by the Black Emergency Cultural Coalition (BECC) [124] Gilliam and other artists were frustrated with the museum, which had organized the exhibition in response to earlier BECC protests over the lack of black artists in the Whitney's programming, because they believed the curator had made only cursory attempts to contact established black curators and scholars of African-American art to help shape the exhibition [124] [125]\n\n\nAutumn Surf, Dark as I Am, and collage\nIn 1973 he was featured in the group exhibition Works in Spaces at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, completely filling the gallery space with Autumn Surf, a 365 ft long [129] polypropylene Drape that dropped from the ceiling before spreading completely around the room to create an angled bay that allowed viewers to \"enter\" the piece [127] He installed several ceiling-height vertical oak beams around the gallery with horizontal beams attached lower down, building an armature from which he draped portions of the painting; [127] the beams also served as anchors for a series of cords, ropes, and pulleys to further suspend other portions of the painting, creating tall wave-like forms [123] Art historian Courtney J Martin has called it \"a hinge in Gilliam's practice, showing how his work matured up to that moment,\" [144] and said the installation spoke to \"his desire to work in space;\" [145] Binstock [note 1] has described the work as \"arguably the preeminent example\" of Gilliam's Drapes [123]  Gilliam re-staged and recycled the painted polypropylene from Autumn Surf multiple times over the following decade in modified configurations and with new additions for different exhibitions, sometimes with new titles when reinstalled; the piece was exhibited through 1982 under its original title as well as Niagara and Niagara Extended [146] In 1973 he also made his first pieces with printmaker William Weege at his Jones Road Print Shop and Stable in Wisconsin, [69] a relationship that would yield a sizeable body of collaborative print works, many published as editions by UW–Madison's Tandem Press, also founded by Weege [147]\n\n\nOutdoor Drapes, White & Black Paintings\nIn the run-up to the Corcoran exhibition, Gilliam also prepared one of his largest and most well-known draped works, Seahorses, his first commissioned work of public art This was exhibited at the Philadelphia Museum of Art as part of a city-wide festival in April and May 1975 [166] Inspired by the large bronze rings that decorate the top of the museum's building, which Gilliam said had made him imagine Neptune using them to tie seahorses to his temple, [167] the work consisted of six monumental unstretched painted canvases, two measuring 40 x 95 ft each and four measuring 30 x 60 ft each, [168] all hung from their respective top corners on the outside walls of the museum, attached via the rings and drooping down in upside-down arches of folds [169] In 1977 he reinstalled the work for a second and final time, with five canvases instead of six, on the outside of the Brooklyn Museum [161] Seahorses was made with traditional canvas material displayed open to the elements and was blown off the museums' walls by the wind in both Philadelphia and Brooklyn, [170] [15] and the canvases were tattered and partly destroyed by the time he deinstalled them in New York [171]\n\n\n1980s-1990s\nIterating on what he explored in the textures of his Black Paintings, by 1980 Gilliam had begun to further build up the surfaces of the canvases with additional collaged pieces and colors beyond black and white [182] He also experimented with stretching the stained and collaged canvases over irregular polygonal beveled stretchers each with nine distinct edges, before covering them with raked fields of paint, [183] producing seventeen of these new forms that he called Chasers [182] This marked a return to the exploration of painting as sculpture, with art historian Steven Zucker describing one of the Chasers as \"an object on the wall, not so much a painting we're looking into.\" [184] The combination of colors, textures, and shapes have led multiple critics and historians to describe the Chaser paintings and others from the period as \"quilted,\" for their resemblance to African and African-American quilting patterns [184] [185] The transition between his Black Paintings and Chasers can be seen most clearly in his Wild Goose Chase series [9] [note 5]\n\n\nChasers, wood and metal constructions\nIterating on what he explored in the textures of his Black Paintings, by 1980 Gilliam had begun to further build up the surfaces of the canvases with additional collaged pieces and colors beyond black and white [182] He also experimented with stretching the stained and collaged canvases over irregular polygonal beveled stretchers each with nine distinct edges, before covering them with raked fields of paint, [183] producing seventeen of these new forms that he called Chasers [182] This marked a return to the exploration of painting as sculpture, with art historian Steven Zucker describing one of the Chasers as \"an object on the wall, not so much a painting we're looking into.\" [184] The combination of colors, textures, and shapes have led multiple critics and historians to describe the Chaser paintings and others from the period as \"quilted,\" for their resemblance to African and African-American quilting patterns [184] [185] The transition between his Black Paintings and Chasers can be seen most clearly in his Wild Goose Chase series [9] [note 5]\n\n\nArt world decline, continued commissions\nIn the late 1980s through the early 2000s, Gilliam was somewhat overlooked by the New York art world; [11] [7] he showed his work very infrequently in New York, [7] but he continued to produce paintings and sculptures in new forms and developed new approaches to abstraction, exhibiting extensively in Washington, across the country, and in several international exhibitions [11] Speaking about staying in Washington, Gilliam himself said in 1989 that \"I’ve learned the difference between what is really good and real for me and what is something that I dreamed would be real and good for me I’ve learned to — I don’t mean to say I’ve learned to love this — but I’ve learned to accept this, the matter of staying here.\" [7] Binstock argued that Gilliam's choices to pursue abstraction as a black artist and to not have a permanent gallery contributed to what he deemed \"a process of growth or expansion and then perhaps a cooling or retrenching period.\" [8] Speaking in 2013, Gilliam offered another explanation as to why he may have been overlooked by some in the art world, suggesting that younger post-black artists making work during this era had been \"able to do something I was not – to keep the political in the front,\" and that they had received greater attention for it [6] This term, usually attributed to curator Thelma Golden, is meant to describe black artists who explicitly invoke and explore black history, culture, and politics in their work but refuse the label of \"black art\" to avoid singular ideas of how all black people or culture should be represented and the responsibilities associated with that representation [193] [194]\n\n\n2000s–2020s\nBeginning in the early 2000s, Gilliam returned to a new version of his early-career geometric abstractions; [207] after experimenting with making monochromatic print works in 2001 at Ohio University, he developed a series of monochrome paintings on wood that he first called Slats and later renamed Slatts [208] He built up thick surfaces of high-gloss acrylic with gel medium on wood to create wall-based works with polished, nearly reflective surfaces, [209] some with puzzle-like insets of alternating rectangles [210] [191]\n\n\nSlatts, retrospective\nBeginning in the early 2000s, Gilliam returned to a new version of his early-career geometric abstractions;

Born on November 30, 1933, in Tupelo, Mississippi, Gilliam's artistic journey was shaped by his experiences as a black artist in America, exploring themes of identity, social justice, and the nuances of color and form.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nGilliam was the seventh of eight children born to Sam Gilliam Sr. and Estery Gilliam. His family moved to Louisville, Kentucky, in 1942, where his father worked as a farmer, janitor, and deacon, and his mother was a school teacher and an active member of the neighborhood sewing group. At a young age, Gilliam was fascinated by drawing and spent most of his time creating cartoons. His mother encouraged his creativity, and he began to flourish in an atmosphere of construction, where his family members used their hands to create.\n\nThroughout his middle and high school education, Gilliam participated in school-sponsored art programs, which laid the foundation for his future artistic pursuits. He attended Central High School in Louisville and graduated in 1951.\n\n**Life and Career**\n\nIn 1962, Gilliam moved to Washington, D.C., where he met his wife, Dorothy Butler, a Louisville native and the first African-American female columnist at The Washington Post. They had three children together: Stephanie, Melissa, and L Franklin. Gilliam's early career was marked by his work as a high school art teacher at D.C.'s McKinley Technical High School, which allowed him to dedicate time to his own art on the weekdays reserved for his students' academic classes.\n\nGilliam's first solo exhibition was held at the Adams Morgan Gallery in 1964, showcasing his early hard-edge experiments. He also began teaching in the summers at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, which provided him with a platform to showcase his work and experiment with new techniques. In 1966, Gilliam began to remove the tape from his hard-edge paintings before the paint had dried, allowing the colors to run fluidly together over the entire surface.\n\n**Early Color Field and Hard-Edge Abstraction**\n\nGilliam's early work was influenced by the Washington Color School, a group of artists who explored the possibilities of color and form. He was particularly drawn to the work of Gene Davis, who introduced him to the concept of color field painting. Gilliam's early hard-edge paintings were characterized by precise geometric fields of color, similar to those of the Washington Color School painters.\n\n**Fluid Abstractions, Beveled Slice Paintings, and Phillips Exhibition**\n\nIn 1966, Gilliam began to experiment with fluid abstractions, removing the tape from his hard-edge paintings before the paint had dried. This allowed him to create dynamic and expressive works that explored the possibilities of color and form. He also began to work on beveled slice paintings, which featured irregular polygonal beveled stretchers with nine distinct edges.\n\nGilliam's work was featured in the Phillips exhibition in 1967, which showcased his early Drapes, a series of folded and draped paintings that explored the possibilities of color and form. The exhibition was a critical success, and Gilliam's work was hailed as a major contribution to the development of modern and contemporary art.\n\n**Outdoor Drapes, White & Black Paintings**\n\nIn the run-up to the Corcoran exhibition, Gilliam prepared one of his largest and most well-known draped works, Seahorses, his first commissioned work of public art. This was exhibited at the Philadelphia Museum of Art as part of a city-wide festival in April and May 1975. Seahorses consisted of six monumental unstretched painted canvases, two measuring 40 x 95 ft each and four measuring 30 x 60 ft each, all hung from their respective top corners on the outside walls of the museum, attached via the rings and drooping down in upside-down arches of folds.\n\n**Art World Decline, Continued Commissions**\n\nIn the late 1980s through the early 2000s, Gilliam was somewhat overlooked by the New York art world. He showed his work very infrequently in New York, but he continued to produce paintings and sculptures in new forms and developed new approaches to abstraction, exhibiting extensively in Washington, across the country, and in several international exhibitions.\n\n**Health Challenges, Resurgence, and Late-Career Acclaim**\n\nFor several years in the early 2010s, Gilliam dealt with severe health complications from his long-term use of lithium to treat his bipolar disorder, which had extensively damaged his kidneys and brought on several years of depression. He was mostly unable to work and his daughter Melissa described him during this time as \"sort of catatonic on the couch.\"\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nGilliam and his wife, Dorothy Butler, separated in 1982 and divorced soon after. In 1986, he met Annie Gawlak, the owner of Washington's G Fine Art gallery. Gilliam and Gawlak married in 2018 after a 30-year partnership.\n\n**Awards and Grants**\n\nGilliam's work was broadly acclaimed during his lifetime and he received numerous awards and grants.\n\n**Exhibitions**\n\nGilliam regularly staged exhibitions in the United States and internationally. Notable group exhibitions included The De Luxe Show (1971) in Houston, the Venice Biennale in 1972 and 2017, and the Marrakech Biennale in 2016.

In this atmosphere of construction, I too began to flourish.\" [13] Throughout his middle and high school education he participated in school-sponsored specialized art programs [7] He attended Central High School in Louisville, and graduated in 1951 [17]\n\n\nLife and career\nOn arriving in Washington in 1962, Gilliam and Butler rented an apartment in the Adams Morgan neighborhood [24] Gilliam tried to enroll in painting courses at American University under artist Robert Gates, a painting professor interested in the same Bay Area Figurative style, but Gates declined, saying Gilliam would not gain much from being his student [34] Gilliam was also turned down for a teaching position at Howard University by art department chair James Porter; according to Gilliam, Porter said he was \"too 'passionate' a painter to be worried about teaching,\" and recommended Gilliam teach at a local high school instead to allow for more time to make and exhibit art [34] Binstock [note 1] suggested that Porter's rejection of Gilliam may have also been due to Gilliam's abstract figurative style clashing with Porter's view of the school's direction, during the era's cultural shifts and social movements, including the Black power movement, which were manifesting in art as a clear, declarative, and often overtly political aesthetic: \"Gilliam's somewhat ethereal and apparently raceless figures may have seemed irrelevant to Porter.\" [34] Gilliam followed Porter's advice – and that of his college professors [18] – to become a high school teacher, teaching art at D.C.'s McKinley Technical High School for five years, eventually becoming close with Porter as a friend and colleague [34] As an art teacher, Gilliam could dedicate time to his own art on the weekdays reserved for his students' academic classes, [18] renting a painting studio at 17th and Q St NW near Dupont Circle [35] [36]\n\n\n1960s\nOn arriving in Washington in 1962, Gilliam and Butler rented an apartment in the Adams Morgan neighborhood [24] Gilliam tried to enroll in painting courses at American University under artist Robert Gates, a painting professor interested in the same Bay Area Figurative style, but Gates declined, saying Gilliam would not gain much from being his student [34] Gilliam was also turned down for a teaching position at Howard University by art department chair James Porter;

unlike Louis and Noland, Downing had not yet been championed by art critic Clement Greenberg, [50] whose praise had been instrumental in elevating the Washington School painters [51] Downing believed the movement's strengths were broader than Greenberg's focus - the importance of the flatness of the colored shapes - and he encouraged Gilliam and others to embrace a more expansive definition of abstraction [52] While the two were close and would often have the other over for dinners with their wives, Gilliam characterized their relationship - and his relationship with other artists [53] - as competitive, later saying that Downing \"didn't influence me, he was someone that I had to beat, to compete with, which meant we hung out together.\" [54] Downing also introduced Gilliam to methods and materials used by the cohort, such as how to work with Magna acrylic resin paint which can soak into canvas rather than layering on top of it, along with a water-tension breaker, the group's so-called \"secret ingredient.\" [55] Gilliam primed his canvases with the water-tension breaker, to \"open the pores\" of the canvas, letting him mix paint colors as they soaked in, instead of mixing on a palette, giving them a translucent appearance [55] Gilliam showed his early hard-edge experiments in 1964 in his second solo exhibition at The Adams Morgan Gallery, his first show of exclusively abstract art The same year he also began teaching in the summers at the Corcoran Gallery of Art [32]\n\n\nFluid abstractions, beveled Slice paintings, and Phillips exhibition\nTo create his hard-edge paintings, Gilliam would tape over sections of unprimed canvas and use a brush or sponge to stain the uncovered portions with paint [64] [65] In 1966 he began to remove the tape before the paint had dried, allowing the colors to run fluidly together over the entire surface, as in the watercolor work Downing had first admired in 1963 [66]\n\n\nSupport from Walter Hopps and early Drape paintings\nIn 1966, curator Walter Hopps came to work for the Institute for Policy Studies, a progressive think tank; [73] in 1967 he became acting director of the WGMA, where he worked to integrate his policy ideas, refocusing the institution on local and regional living artists and building an outreach program oriented in part toward D.C.'s large black community, [90] soon offering Gilliam a space in the WGMA's new artist-in-residence program [91] This offer in December 1967, just after Gilliam's Phillips exhibition - of a $5,000 stipend and studio space in the institution's new workshop downtown with a $50,000 operations budget - led him to continue painting full time instead of returning to teaching, but the workshop did not open until April 1968 and Gilliam did not receive the stipend until June [92] Looking back on this decision, Gilliam said, \"I survived at least six months just on the promise of $5,000,\" and \"It took a lot of guts.\" [92] When the WGMA workshop opened in 1968, Gilliam shared the space with Krebs; other artists in the program included printmaker Lou Stovall, [92] who would become Gilliam's long-term colleague and collaborator [93]\n\n\n1970s\nFollowing the critical success of his early Drapes, Gilliam was invited to present his work at a number of museums and galleries in the early and mid-1970s, both creating new Drape installations and re-installing previous ones [123] In 1970, Gilliam was also hospitalized for anxiety and depression for a second time [46] In April 1971, he withdrew from a group exhibition of contemporary African-American art at New York's Whitney Museum in solidarity with a boycott organized by the Black Emergency Cultural Coalition (BECC) [124] Gilliam and other artists were frustrated with the museum, which had organized the exhibition in response to earlier BECC protests over the lack of black artists in the Whitney's programming, because they believed the curator had made only cursory attempts to contact established black curators and scholars of African-American art to help shape the exhibition [124] [125]\n\n\nNew Drape forms, national and international success, printmaking\nFollowing the critical success of his early Drapes, Gilliam was invited to present his work at a number of museums and galleries in the early and mid-1970s, both creating new Drape installations and re-installing previous ones [123] In 1970, Gilliam was also hospitalized for anxiety and depression for a second time [46] In April 1971, he withdrew from a group exhibition of contemporary African-American art at New York's Whitney Museum in solidarity with a boycott organized by the Black Emergency Cultural Coalition (BECC) [124] Gilliam and other artists were frustrated with the museum, which had organized the exhibition in response to earlier BECC protests over the lack of black artists in the Whitney's programming, because they believed the curator had made only cursory attempts to contact established black curators and scholars of African-American art to help shape the exhibition [124] [125]\n\n\nAutumn Surf, Dark as I Am, and collage\nIn 1973 he was featured in the group exhibition Works in Spaces at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, completely filling the gallery space with Autumn Surf, a 365 ft long [129] polypropylene Drape that dropped from the ceiling before spreading completely around the room to create an angled bay that allowed viewers to \"enter\" the piece [127] He installed several ceiling-height vertical oak beams around the gallery with horizontal beams attached lower down, building an armature from which he draped portions of the painting; [127] the beams also served as anchors for a series of cords, ropes, and pulleys to further suspend other portions of the painting, creating tall wave-like forms [123] Art historian Courtney J Martin has called it \"a hinge in Gilliam's practice, showing how his work matured up to that moment,\" [144] and said the installation spoke to \"his desire to work in space;\" [145] Binstock [note 1] has described the work as \"arguably the preeminent example\" of Gilliam's Drapes [123]  Gilliam re-staged and recycled the painted polypropylene from Autumn Surf multiple times over the following decade in modified configurations and with new additions for different exhibitions, sometimes with new titles when reinstalled; the piece was exhibited through 1982 under its original title as well as Niagara and Niagara Extended [146] In 1973 he also made his first pieces with printmaker William Weege at his Jones Road Print Shop and Stable in Wisconsin, [69] a relationship that would yield a sizeable body of collaborative print works, many published as editions by UW–Madison's Tandem Press, also founded by Weege [147]\n\n\nOutdoor Drapes, White & Black Paintings\nIn the run-up to the Corcoran exhibition, Gilliam also prepared one of his largest and most well-known draped works, Seahorses, his first commissioned work of public art This was exhibited at the Philadelphia Museum of Art as part of a city-wide festival in April and May 1975 [166] Inspired by the large bronze rings that decorate the top of the museum's building, which Gilliam said had made him imagine Neptune using them to tie seahorses to his temple, [167] the work consisted of six monumental unstretched painted canvases, two measuring 40 x 95 ft each and four measuring 30 x 60 ft each, [168] all hung from their respective top corners on the outside walls of the museum, attached via the rings and drooping down in upside-down arches of folds [169] In 1977 he reinstalled the work for a second and final time, with five canvases instead of six, on the outside of the Brooklyn Museum [161] Seahorses was made with traditional canvas material displayed open to the elements and was blown off the museums' walls by the wind in both Philadelphia and Brooklyn, [170] [15] and the canvases were tattered and partly destroyed by the time he deinstalled them in New York [171]\n\n\n1980s-1990s\nIterating on what he explored in the textures of his Black Paintings, by 1980 Gilliam had begun to further build up the surfaces of the canvases with additional collaged pieces and colors beyond black and white [182] He also experimented with stretching the stained and collaged canvases over irregular polygonal beveled stretchers each with nine distinct edges, before covering them with raked fields of paint, [183] producing seventeen of these new forms that he called Chasers [182] This marked a return to the exploration of painting as sculpture, with art historian Steven Zucker describing one of the Chasers as \"an object on the wall, not so much a painting we're looking into.\" [184] The combination of colors, textures, and shapes have led multiple critics and historians to describe the Chaser paintings and others from the period as \"quilted,\" for their resemblance to African and African-American quilting patterns [184] [185] The transition between his Black Paintings and Chasers can be seen most clearly in his Wild Goose Chase series [9] [note 5]\n\n\nChasers, wood and metal constructions\nIterating on what he explored in the textures of his Black Paintings, by 1980 Gilliam had begun to further build up the surfaces of the canvases with additional collaged pieces and colors beyond black and white [182] He also experimented with stretching the stained and collaged canvases over irregular polygonal beveled stretchers each with nine distinct edges, before covering them with raked fields of paint, [183] producing seventeen of these new forms that he called Chasers [182] This marked a return to the exploration of painting as sculpture, with art historian Steven Zucker describing one of the Chasers as \"an object on the wall, not so much a painting we're looking into.\" [184] The combination of colors, textures, and shapes have led multiple critics and historians to describe the Chaser paintings and others from the period as \"quilted,\" for their resemblance to African and African-American quilting patterns [184] [185] The transition between his Black Paintings and Chasers can be seen most clearly in his Wild Goose Chase series [9] [note 5]\n\n\nArt world decline, continued commissions\nIn the late 1980s through the early 2000s, Gilliam was somewhat overlooked by the New York art world; [11] [7] he showed his work very infrequently in New York, [7] but he continued to produce paintings and sculptures in new forms and developed new approaches to abstraction, exhibiting extensively in Washington, across the country, and in several international exhibitions [11] Speaking about staying in Washington, Gilliam himself said in 1989 that \"I’ve learned the difference between what is really good and real for me and what is something that I dreamed would be real and good for me I’ve learned to — I don’t mean to say I’ve learned to love this — but I’ve learned to accept this, the matter of staying here.\" [7] Binstock argued that Gilliam's choices to pursue abstraction as a black artist and to not have a permanent gallery contributed to what he deemed \"a process of growth or expansion and then perhaps a cooling or retrenching period.\" [8] Speaking in 2013, Gilliam offered another explanation as to why he may have been overlooked by some in the art world, suggesting that younger post-black artists making work during this era had been \"able to do something I was not – to keep the political in the front,\" and that they had received greater attention for it [6] This term, usually attributed to curator Thelma Golden, is meant to describe black artists who explicitly invoke and explore black history, culture, and politics in their work but refuse the label of \"black art\" to avoid singular ideas of how all black people or culture should be represented and the responsibilities associated with that representation [193] [194]\n\n\n2000s–2020s\nBeginning in the early 2000s, Gilliam returned to a new version of his early-career geometric abstractions; [207] after experimenting with making monochromatic print works in 2001 at Ohio University, he developed a series of monochrome paintings on wood that he first called Slats and later renamed Slatts [208] He built up thick surfaces of high-gloss acrylic with gel medium on wood to create wall-based works with polished, nearly reflective surfaces, [209] some with puzzle-like insets of alternating rectangles [210] [191]\n\n\nSlatts, retrospective\nBeginning in the early 2000s, Gilliam returned to a new version of his early-career geometric abstractions; [207] after experimenting with making monochromatic print works in 2001 at Ohio University, he developed a series of monochrome paintings on wood that he first called Slats and later renamed Slatts [208] He built up thick surfaces of high-gloss acrylic with gel medium on wood to create wall-based works with polished, nearly reflective surfaces, [209] some with puzzle-like insets of alternating rectangles [210] [191]\n\n\nHealth challenges, resurgence, and late-career acclaim\nFor several years in the early 2010s, Gilliam dealt with severe health complications from his long-term use of lithium to treat his bipolar disorder, which had extensively damaged his kidneys and brought on several years of depression [47] [48] He was mostly unable to work and his daughter Melissa described him during this time as \"sort of catatonic on the couch.\" [48]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1962, Gilliam married Dorothy Butler, a Louisville native and the first African-American female columnist at The Washington Post They had three children together: Stephanie (b 1963), [32] Melissa (b 1965), [32] and L Franklin (b 1967) [69] Gilliam and Butler separated in 1982 and divorced soon after [181] In 1986 he met Annie Gawlak, the owner of Washington's G Fine Art gallery [232] Gilliam and Gawlak married in 2018 after a 30-year partnership [52]\n\n\nSelected permanent public artwork\nStarting in the late 1970s, some of Gilliam's works were commissions for public buildings His first work made for permanent public display was Triple Variants, an unstretched canvas in earthy tones with extensive cut-outs, bolted flat and draped against the wall, with two curved blocks of marble and an aluminum beam resting on the ground [188] It was commissioned through the Art in Architecture Program of the General Services Administration, [233] and installed in the Richard B Russell Federal Building in Atlanta in 1979 [234] [235]\n\n\nAwards and grants\nGilliam's work was broadly acclaimed during his lifetime and he received numerous awards and grants.\n\n\nExhibitions\nGilliam regularly staged exhibitions in the United States and internationally \nNotable group exhibitions included The De Luxe Show (1971) in Houston; [248] \nthe Venice Biennale in 1972 [8] and 2017; [25] and the Marrakech Biennale in 2016 [249] He also staged a series of three-artist shows with Mel Edwards and William T Williams titled Interconnections (1972) at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago; Extensions (1974) at the Wadsworth Atheneum; Resonance (1976) at Morgan State University; [250] and Epistrophy (2021) at Pace Gallery [251]\n\n\nNotable solo exhibitions\nFollowing his death, several galleries and museums staged posthumous exhibitions of his work, including: Late Paintings, which opened at Pace's London gallery in 2022;

Such an opportunity you will never again have I would therefore strongly press on you to fix no other limit to your stay in Edinborough than your having got thro this whole course The omission of any one part of it will be an affliction & loss to you as long as you live.\"\n\n\n20th century\nDuring World War I, the Science and Medicine buildings had suffered from a lack of repairs or upgrades, which was exacerbated by an influx of students after the end of the war [64] In 1919, the university bought the land of West Mains Farm in the south of the city for the development of a new satellite campus specialising in the sciences [65] On 6 July 1920, King George V laid the foundation of the first new building (now called the Joseph Black Building), housing the Department of Chemistry [64] The campus was named King's Buildings in honour of George V.\n\n\n21st century\nIn the 1990s it became apparent that the old Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh buildings in Lauriston Place were no longer adequate for a modern teaching hospital Donald Dewar, the Scottish Secretary at the time, authorized a joint project between private finance, local authorities, and the university to create a modern hospital and medical campus in the Little France area of Edinburgh [80] The new campus was named the BioQuarter The Chancellor's Building was opened on 12 August 2002 by Prince Philip, housing the new Edinburgh Medical School alongside the new Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh [81] In 2007, the campus saw the addition of the Euan MacDonald Centre as a research centre for motor neuron diseases, which was part-funded by Scottish entrepreneur Euan MacDonald and his father Donald [82] [83] In August 2010, author J K Rowling provided £10 million in funding to create the Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic, [84] which was officially opened in October 2013 [85] The Centre for Regenerative Medicine (CRM) is a stem cell research centre dedicated to the development of regenerative treatments, which was opened in 2012 [86] CRM is also home to applied scientists working with the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS) and Roslin Cells [87]\n\n\nHistorical links\nEdinburgh has several historical links to other universities, chiefly through its influential Medical School and its graduates, who established and developed institutions elsewhere in the world.\n\n\nCampuses and buildings\nThe university has five main sites in Edinburgh: [120]\n\n\nCentral Area\nThe Central Area is spread around numerous squares and streets in Edinburgh's Southside, with some buildings in Old Town It is the university's oldest area, occupied primarily by the College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences and the School of Informatics The highest concentration of university buildings is around George Square, which includes 40 George Square (formerly David Hume Tower), Appleton Tower, Main Library, and Gordon Aikman Lecture Theatre, the area's largest lecture hall Around nearby Bristo Square lie the Dugald Stewart Building, Informatics Forum, McEwan Hall, Potterrow Student Centre, Teviot Row House, and old Medical School, which still houses pre-clinical medical courses and biomedical sciences [43] The Pleasance, one of Edinburgh University Students' Association's main buildings, is located nearby, as is Edinburgh College of Art in Lauriston North of George Square lies the university's Old College housing Edinburgh Law School, New College on The Mound housing the School of Divinity, and St Cecilia's Hall Some of these buildings are used to host events during the Edinburgh International Festival and the Edinburgh Festival Fringe every summer [122]\n\n\nPollock Halls\nPollock Halls, adjoining Holyrood Park to the east, is the university's largest residence hall for undergraduate students in their first year The complex houses over 2,000 students during term time and consists of ten named buildings with communal green spaces between them [123] The two original buildings, St Leonard's Hall and Salisbury Green, were built in the 19th century, while the majority of Pollock Halls dates from the 1960s and early 2000s Two of the older houses in Pollock Halls were demolished in 2002, and a new building, Chancellor's Court, was built in their place and opened in 2003 Self-catered flats elsewhere account for the majority of university-provided accommodation The area also includes the John McIntyre Conference Centre opened in 2009, which is the university's premier conference space [124]\n\n\nHolyrood\nThe Holyrood campus, just off the Royal Mile, used to be the site for Moray House Institute for Education until it merged with the university on 1 August 1998 [78] The university has since extended this campus [125] The buildings include redeveloped and extended Sports Science, Physical Education and Leisure Management facilities at St Leonard's Land linked to the Sports Institute in the Pleasance [126] The £80 million O'Shea Hall at Holyrood was named after the former principal of the university Sir Timothy O'Shea and was opened by Princess Anne in 2017, providing a living and social environment for postgraduate students [127] The Outreach Centre, Institute for Academic Development (University Services Group), and Edinburgh Centre for Professional Legal Studies are also located at Holyrood [128] [129] [130]\n\n\nKing's Buildings\nThe King's Buildings campus is located in the south of the city Most of the Science and Engineering College's research and teaching activities take place at the campus, which occupies a 35-hectare site It includes the Alexander Graham Bell Building (for mobile phones and digital communications systems), James Clerk Maxwell Building (the administrative and teaching centre of the School of Physics and Astronomy and School of Mathematics), Joseph Black Building (home to the School of Chemistry), Royal Observatory, Swann Building (the Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Biology), Waddington Building (the Centre for Systems Biology at Edinburgh), William Rankine Building (School of Engineering's Institute for Infrastructure and Environment), and others [131] Until 2012, the KB campus was served by three libraries: Darwin Library, James Clerk Maxwell Library, and Robertson Engineering and Science Library These were replaced by the Noreen and Kenneth Murray Library opened for the academic year 2012/13 [132] [133] The campus also hosts the National e-Science Centre (NeSC), Scotland's Rural College (SRUC), Scottish Institute for Enterprise (SIE), Scottish Microelectronics Centre (SMC), and Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre (SUERC).\n\n\nBioQuarter\nThe BioQuarter campus, based in the Little France area, is home to the majority of medical facilities of the university, alongside the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh The campus houses the Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic, Centre for Regenerative Medicine, Chancellor's Building, Euan MacDonald Centre, and Queen's Medical Research Institute, which opened in 2005 [81] The Chancellor's Building has two large lecture theatres and a medical library connected to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh

administration\nIn common with the other ancient universities of Scotland, and in contrast to nearly all other pre-1992 universities which are established by royal charters, the University of Edinburgh is constituted by the Universities (Scotland) Acts 1858 to 1966 These acts provide for three major bodies in the governance of the university: the University Court, the General Council, and the Senatus Academicus [47]\n\n\nGovernance\nIn common with the other ancient universities of Scotland, and in contrast to nearly all other pre-1992 universities which are established by royal charters, the University of Edinburgh is constituted by the Universities (Scotland) Acts 1858 to 1966 These acts provide for three major bodies in the governance of the university: the University Court, the General Council, and the Senatus Academicus [47]\n\n\nUniversity Court\nThe University Court is the university's governing body and the legal person of the university, chaired by the rector and consisting of the principal, Lord Provost of Edinburgh, and of Assessors appointed by the rector, chancellor, Edinburgh Town Council, General Council, and Senatus Academicus By the Universities (Scotland) Act 1889, it is a body corporate, with perpetual succession and a common seal All property belonging to the university at the passing of the Act was vested in the Court [138] The present powers of the Court are further defined in the Universities (Scotland) Act 1966, including the administration and management of the university's revenue and property, the regulation of staff salaries, and the establishment and composition of committees of its own members or others.\n\n\nGeneral Council\nThe General Council consists of graduates, academic staff, current and former University Court members It was established to ensure that graduates have a continuing voice in the management of the university The Council is required to meet twice per year to consider matters affecting the wellbeing and prosperity of the university The Universities (Scotland) Act 1966 gave the Council the power to consider draft ordinances and resolutions, to be presented with an annual report of the work and activities of the university, and to receive an audited financial statement [139] The Council elects the chancellor of the university and three Assessors on the University Court.\n\n\nSenatus Academicus\nThe Senatus Academicus is the university's supreme academic body, chaired by the principal and consisting of the professors, heads of departments, and a number of readers, lecturers and other teaching and research staff [140] The core function of the Senatus is to regulate and supervise the teaching and discipline of the university and to promote research The Senatus elects four Assessors on the University Court The Senatus meets three times per year, hosting a presentation and discussion session which is open to all members of staff at each meeting.\n\n\nUniversity officials\nThe university's three most significant officials are its chancellor, rector, and principal, whose rights and responsibilities are largely derived from the Universities (Scotland) Act 1858.\n\n\nColleges and schools\nIn 2002, the university was reorganised from its nine faculties into three 'Colleges' [146] While technically not a collegiate university, it comprises the Colleges of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences (CAHSS), Science & Engineering (CSE) and Medicine & Vet Medicine (CMVM) Within these colleges are 'Schools', which either represent one academic discipline such as Informatics or assemble adjacent academic disciplines such as the School of History, Classics and Archaeology While bound by College-level policies, individual Schools can differ in their organisation and governance As of 2021, the university has 21 schools in total [147]\n\n\nArts, Humanities and Social Sciences\nThe College took on its current name of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences in 2016 after absorbing the Edinburgh College of Art in 2011 [148] CAHSS offers more than 280 undergraduate degree programmes, 230 taught postgraduate programmes, and 200 research postgraduate programmes [149] [150] Twenty subjects offered by the college were ranked within the top 10 nationally in the 2022 Complete University Guide [151] It includes the oldest English Literature department in Britain, [33] which was ranked 7th globally in the 2021 QS Rankings by Subject in English Language & Literature [152] The college hosts Scotland's ESRC Doctoral Training Centre (DTC), the Scottish Graduate School of Social Science The college is the largest of the three colleges by enrolment, with 26,130 students and 3,089 academic staff [153] [5]\n\n\nMedicine and Veterinary Medicine\nEdinburgh Medical School was widely considered the best medical school in the English-speaking world throughout the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century and contributed significantly to the university's international reputation [154] [155] Its graduates founded medical schools all over the world, including at five of the seven Ivy League universities (Columbia, Dartmouth, Harvard, Pennsylvania, and Yale); those in McGill, Montréal, Sydney, and Vermont; the Royal Postgraduate Medical School (now part of Imperial College London), Middlesex Hospital, and the London School of Medicine for Women (both now part of UCL).\n\n\nScience and Engineering\nIn the 16th century, science was taught as \"natural philosophy\" in the university The 17th century saw the institution of the University Chairs of Mathematics and Botany, followed the next century by Chairs of Natural History, Astronomy, Chemistry and Agriculture It was Edinburgh's professors who took a leading part in the formation of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1783 Joseph Black, Professor of Medicine and Chemistry at the time, founded the world's first Chemical Society in 1785 [163] The first named degrees of Bachelor and Doctor of Science was instituted in 1864, and a separate Faculty of Science was created in 1893 after three centuries of scientific advances at Edinburgh [163] The Regius Chair in Engineering was established in 1868, and the Regius Chair in Geology in 1871 In 1991 the Faculty of Science was renamed the Faculty of Science and Engineering, and in 2002 it became the College of Science and Engineering The college has 11,745 students and 2,937 academic staff [153] [5]\n\n\nSub-units, centres and institutes\nSome subunits, centres and institutes within the university are listed as follows: [164]\n\n\nStaff, community and networking\nIn June 2024, the University employed over 12,390 full time equivalent staff, an increase of 508 over the previous year: [165]\n\n\nIndustrial action\nStaff at the university engaged in the sector-wide 2018–2023 UK higher education strikes called by the University and College Union over disputes regarding USS pensions, pay, and working conditions A Marking and Assessment Boycott [181] that commenced on 20 April 2023 [182] was called off on 6 September 2023 [183] However, the UCU voted to continue strike action throughout the rest of September [184] [185]\n\n\nAcademic profile\nThe university is a member of the Russell Group of research-led British universities, and the Sutton 13 group of top-ranked universities in the UK [186] It is the only British university to be a member of both the Coimbra Group and the League of European Research Universities, and it is a founding member of Una Europa and Universitas 21, both international associations of research-intensive universities [187] The university maintains historically strong ties with the neighbouring Heriot-Watt University for teaching and research Edinburgh also offers a wide range of free online MOOC courses on three global platforms Coursera, Edx and FutureLearn [188] [189]\n\n\nAdmissions\nIn 2021, the University of Edinburgh had the seventh-highest average entry standards amongst universities in the UK, with new undergraduates averaging 197 UCAS points, equivalent to just above AAAA in A-level grades [190] It gave offers of admission to 33% of its 18 year old applicants in 2022, the fourth-lowest amongst the Russell Group [195]\n\n\nGraduation\nAt graduation ceremonies, graduates are being 'capped' with the Geneva bonnet, which involves the university's principal tapping them on the head with the cap while they receive their graduation certificate [200] The velvet-and-silk hat has been used for over 150 years, and legend says that it was originally made from cloth taken from the breeches of 16th-century scholars John Knox or George Buchanan [201] However, when the hat was last restored in the early 2000s, a label dated 1849 was discovered bearing the name of Edinburgh tailor Henry Banks, although some doubt remains whether he manufactured or restored the hat [200] [202] In 2006, a university emblem that had been taken into space by astronaut and Edinburgh graduate Piers Sellers was incorporated into the Geneva bonnet [203]\n\n\nLibrary system\nPre-dating the university by three years, Edinburgh University Library was founded in 1580 through the donation of a large collection by Clement Litill, and today is the largest academic library collection in Scotland [204] [205] The Brutalist style eight-storey Main Library building in George Square was designed by Sir Basil Spence At the time of its completion in 1967, it was the largest building of its type in the UK, and today is a category A listed building [206] The library system also includes many specialised libraries at the college and school level [207]\n\n\nExchange programmes\nThe university offers students the opportunity to study in Europe and beyond via the European Union's Erasmus+ programme [d] and a variety of international exchange agreements with around 300 partners institutions in nearly 40 countries worldwide [209]\n\n\nRankings and reputation\nIn the 2021 Research Excellence Framework (REF), which evaluated work produced between 2014 and 2021, Edinburgh ranked 4th by research power and 15th by GPA amongst British universities [218] The university fell four places in GPA when compared to the 2014 REF, but retained its place in research power [219] 90 per cent of the university's research activity was judged to be 'world leading' (4*) or 'internationally excellent' (3*), and five departments – Computer Science, Informatics, Sociology, Anthropology, and Development Studies – were ranked as the best in the UK [220]\n\n\nStudent life\nEdinburgh University Students' Association (EUSA) consists of the students' union and the students' representative council EUSA's buildings include Teviot Row House, The Pleasance, Potterrow Student Centre, Kings Buildings House, as well as shops, cafés and refectories across the various campuses Teviot Row House is considered the oldest purpose-built student union building in the world [60] [237] Most of these buildings are operated as Edinburgh Festival Fringe venues during August EUSA represents students to the university and the wider world, and is responsible for over 250 student societies at the university The association has five sabbatical office bearers – a president and four vice presidents EUSA is affiliated with the National Union of Students (NUS).\n\n\nStudents' Association\nEdinburgh University Students' Association (EUSA) consists of the students' union and the students' representative council EUSA's buildings include Teviot

Young Greens, Feminist Society, LGBT+ Pride, [264] Marxist Society, and Students for Justice in Palestine [265]\n\n\nGaza protest\nIn May 2024, student activists set up a protest camp in the Old College Quad, with some also beginning a hunger strike, [272] and demanded divestment from companies they alleged supported the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip The campaign, backed by more than 600 staff and the students' union, [273] specifically targeted the university's investments in Alphabet Inc and Amazon, and its relationship with investment firm BlackRock [274] In response, Principal Mathieson emphasized that the university would respect peaceful protest rights, while also defending its investment practices [275] The university subsequently established a working group to review its investment policies related to \"armaments and controversial weapons\" [276] [277] and launched a consultation on ethical investing principles The protest camp was dismantled in June [278]\n\n\nStudent co-operatives\nThere are three student-run co-operatives associated with the University: Edinburgh Student Housing Co-operative (ESHC), providing affordable housing for 106 students; [279] the Hearty Squirrel Food Cooperative, providing local, organic and affordable food to students and staff; [280] and the SHRUB Coop, a swap and re-use hub aimed at reducing waste and promoting sustainability [281] Of these, only the Hearty Squirrel Co-operative operates on campus ESHC is based on the Bruntsfield Links south of the University's central campus, and hosts students

Edinburgh Medical School alongside the new Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh [81] In 2007, the campus saw the addition of the Euan MacDonald Centre as a research centre for motor neuron diseases, which was part-funded by Scottish entrepreneur Euan MacDonald and his father Donald [82] [83] In August 2010, author J K Rowling provided £10 million in funding to create the Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic, [84] which was officially opened in October 2013 [85] The Centre for Regenerative Medicine (CRM) is a stem cell research centre dedicated to the development of regenerative treatments, which was opened in 2012 [86] CRM is also home to applied scientists working with the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS) and Roslin Cells [87]\n\n\nHistorical links\nEdinburgh has several historical links to other universities, chiefly through its influential Medical School and its graduates, who established and developed institutions elsewhere in the world.\n\n\nCampuses and buildings\nThe university has five main sites in Edinburgh: [120]\n\n\nCentral Area\nThe Central Area is spread around numerous squares and streets in Edinburgh's Southside, with some buildings in Old Town It is the university's oldest area, occupied primarily by the College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences and the School of Informatics The highest concentration of university buildings is around George Square, which includes 40 George Square (formerly David Hume Tower), Appleton Tower, Main Library, and Gordon Aikman Lecture Theatre, the area's largest lecture hall Around nearby Bristo Square lie the Dugald Stewart Building, Informatics Forum, McEwan Hall, Potterrow Student Centre, Teviot Row House, and old Medical School, which still houses pre-clinical medical courses and biomedical sciences [43] The Pleasance, one of Edinburgh University Students' Association's main buildings, is located nearby, as is Edinburgh College of Art in Lauriston North of George Square lies the university's Old College housing Edinburgh Law School, New College on The Mound housing the School of Divinity, and St Cecilia's Hall Some of these buildings are used to host events during the Edinburgh International Festival and the Edinburgh Festival Fringe every summer [122]\n\n\nPollock Halls\nPollock Halls, adjoining Holyrood Park to the east, is the university's largest residence hall for undergraduate students in their first year The complex houses over 2,000 students during term time and consists of ten named buildings with communal green spaces between them [123] The two original buildings, St Leonard's Hall and Salisbury Green, were built in the 19th century, while the majority of Pollock Halls dates from the 1960s and early 2000s Two of the older houses in Pollock Halls were demolished in 2002, and a new building, Chancellor's Court, was built in their place and opened in 2003 Self-catered flats elsewhere account for the majority of university-provided accommodation The area also includes the John McIntyre Conference Centre opened in 2009, which is the university's premier conference space [124]\n\n\nHolyrood\nThe Holyrood campus, just off the Royal Mile, used to be the site for Moray House Institute for Education until it merged with the university on 1 August 1998 [78] The university has since extended this campus [125] The buildings include redeveloped and extended Sports Science, Physical Education and Leisure Management facilities at St Leonard's Land linked to the Sports Institute in the Pleasance [126] The £80 million O'Shea Hall at Holyrood was named after the former principal of the university Sir Timothy O'Shea and was opened by Princess Anne in 2017, providing a living and social environment for postgraduate students [127] The Outreach Centre, Institute for Academic Development (University Services Group), and Edinburgh Centre for Professional Legal Studies are also located at Holyrood [128] [129] [130]\n\n\nKing's Buildings\nThe King's Buildings campus is located in the south of the city Most of the Science and Engineering College's research and teaching activities take place at the campus, which occupies a 35-hectare site It includes the Alexander Graham Bell Building (for mobile phones and digital communications systems), James Clerk Maxwell Building (the administrative and teaching centre of the School of Physics and Astronomy and School of Mathematics), Joseph Black Building (home to the School of Chemistry), Royal Observatory, Swann Building (the Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Biology), Waddington Building (the Centre for Systems Biology at Edinburgh), William Rankine Building (School of Engineering's Institute for Infrastructure and Environment), and others [131] Until 2012, the KB campus was served by three libraries: Darwin Library, James Clerk Maxwell Library, and Robertson Engineering and Science Library These were replaced by the Noreen and Kenneth Murray Library opened for the academic year 2012/13 [132] [133] The campus also hosts the National e-Science Centre (NeSC), Scotland's Rural College (SRUC), Scottish Institute for Enterprise (SIE), Scottish Microelectronics Centre (SMC), and Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre (SUERC).\n\n\nBioQuarter\nThe BioQuarter campus, based in the Little France area, is home to the majority of medical facilities of the university, alongside the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh The campus houses the Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic, Centre for Regenerative Medicine, Chancellor's Building, Euan MacDonald Centre, and Queen's Medical Research Institute, which opened in 2005 [81] The Chancellor's Building has two large lecture theatres and a medical library connected to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by a series of corridors.\n\n\nEaster Bush\nThe Easter Bush campus, located seven miles south of the city, houses the Jeanne Marchig International Centre for Animal Welfare Education, Roslin Institute, Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, and Veterinary Oncology and Imaging Centre [93]\n\n\nWestern General\nThe Western General campus, in proximity to the Western General Hospital, contains the Biomedical Research Facility, Edinburgh Clinical Research Facility, and Institute of Genetics and Cancer (formerly the Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine).\n\n\nOrganisation and administration\nIn common with the other ancient universities of Scotland, and in contrast to nearly all other pre-1992 universities which are established by royal charters, the University of Edinburgh is constituted by the Universities (Scotland) Acts 1858 to 1966 These acts provide for three major bodies in the governance of the university: the University Court, the General Council, and the Senatus Academicus [47]\n\n\nGovernance\nIn common with the other ancient universities of Scotland, and in contrast to nearly all other pre-1992 universities which are established by royal charters, the University of Edinburgh is constituted by the Universities (Scotland) Acts 1858 to 1966 These acts provide for three major bodies in the governance of the university: the University Court, the General Council, and the Senatus Academicus [47]\n\n\nUniversity Court\nThe University Court is the university's governing body and the legal person of the university, chaired by the rector and consisting of the principal, Lord Provost of Edinburgh, and of Assessors appointed by the rector, chancellor, Edinburgh Town Council, General Council, and Senatus Academicus By the Universities (Scotland) Act 1889, it is a body corporate, with perpetual succession and a common seal All property belonging to the university at the passing of the Act was vested in the Court [138] The present powers of the Court are further defined in the Universities (Scotland) Act 1966, including the administration and management of the university's revenue and property, the regulation of staff salaries, and the establishment and composition of committees of its own members or others.\n\n\nGeneral Council\nThe General Council consists of graduates, academic staff, current and former University Court members It was established to ensure that graduates have a continuing voice in the management of the university The Council is required to meet twice per year to consider matters affecting the wellbeing and prosperity of the university The Universities (Scotland) Act 1966 gave the Council the power to consider draft ordinances and resolutions, to be presented with an annual report of the work and activities of the university, and to receive an audited financial statement [139] The Council elects the chancellor of the university and three Assessors on the University Court.\n\n\nSenatus Academicus\nThe Senatus Academicus is the university's supreme academic body, chaired by the principal and consisting of the professors, heads of departments, and a number of readers, lecturers and other teaching and research staff [140] The core function of the Senatus is to regulate and supervise the teaching and discipline of the university and to promote research The Senatus elects four Assessors on the University Court The Senatus meets three times per year, hosting a presentation and discussion session which is open to all members of staff at each meeting.\n\n\nUniversity officials\nThe university's three most significant officials are its chancellor, rector, and principal, whose rights and responsibilities are largely derived from the Universities (Scotland) Act 1858.\n\n\nColleges and schools\nIn 2002, the university was reorganised from its nine faculties into three 'Colleges' [146] While technically not a collegiate university, it comprises the Colleges of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences (CAHSS), Science & Engineering (CSE) and Medicine & Vet Medicine (CMVM) Within these colleges are 'Schools', which either represent one academic discipline such as Informatics or assemble adjacent academic disciplines such as the School of History, Classics and Archaeology While bound by College-level policies, individual Schools can differ in their organisation and governance As of 2021, the university has 21 schools in total [147]\n\n\nArts, Humanities and Social Sciences\nThe College took on its current name of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences in 2016 after absorbing the Edinburgh College of Art in 2011 [148] CAHSS offers more than 280 undergraduate degree programmes, 230 taught postgraduate programmes, and 200 research postgraduate programmes [149] [150] Twenty subjects offered by the college were ranked within the top 10 nationally in the 2022 Complete University Guide [151] It includes the oldest English Literature department in Britain, [33] which was ranked 7th globally in the 2021 QS Rankings by Subject in English Language & Literature [152] The college hosts Scotland's ESRC Doctoral Training Centre (DTC), the Scottish Graduate School of Social Science The college is the largest of the three colleges by enrolment, with 26,130 students and 3,089 academic staff [153] [5]\n\n\nMedicine and Veterinary Medicine\nEdinburgh Medical School was widely considered the best medical school in the English-speaking world throughout the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century and contributed significantly to the university's international reputation [154] [155] Its graduates founded medical schools all over the world, including at five of the seven Ivy League universities (Columbia, Dartmouth, Harvard, Pennsylvania, and Yale); those in McGill, Montréal, Sydney, and Vermont; the Royal Postgraduate Medical School (now part of Imperial College London), Middlesex Hospital, and the London School of Medicine for Women (both now part of UCL).\n\n\nScience and Engineering\nIn the 16th century, science was taught as \"natural philosophy\" in the university The 17th century saw the institution of the University Chairs of Mathematics and Botany, followed the next century by Chairs of Natural History, Astronomy, Chemistry and Agriculture It was Edinburgh's professors who took a leading part in the formation of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1783 Joseph Black, Professor of Medicine and Chemistry at the time, founded the world's first Chemical Society in 1785 [163] The first named degrees of Bachelor and Doctor of Science was instituted in 1864, and a separate Faculty of Science was created in 1893 after three centuries of scientific advances at Edinburgh [163] The Regius Chair in Engineering was established in 1868, and the Regius Chair in Geology in 1871 In 1991 the Faculty of Science was renamed the Faculty of Science and Engineering, and in 2002 it became the College of Science and Engineering The college has 11,745 students and 2,937 academic staff [153] [5]\n\n\nSub-units, centres and institutes\nSome subunits, centres and institutes within the university are listed as follows: [164]\n\n\nStaff, community and networking\nIn June 2024, the University employed over 12,390 full time equivalent staff, an increase of 508 over the previous year: [165]\n\n\nIndustrial action\nStaff at the university engaged in the sector-wide 2018–2023 UK higher education strikes called by the University and College Union over disputes regarding USS pensions, pay, and working conditions A Marking and Assessment Boycott [181] that commenced on 20 April 2023 [182] was called off on 6 September 2023 [183] However, the UCU voted to continue strike action throughout the rest of September [184] [185]\n\n\nAcademic profile\nThe university is a member of the Russell Group of research-led British universities, and the Sutton 13 group of top-ranked universities in the UK [186] It is the only British university to be a member of both the Coimbra Group and the League of European Research Universities, and it is a founding member of Una Europa and Universitas 21, both international associations of research-intensive universities [187] The university maintains historically strong ties with the neighbouring Heriot-Watt University for teaching and research Edinburgh also offers a wide range of free online MOOC courses on three global platforms Coursera, Edx and FutureLearn [188] [189]\n\n\nAdmissions\nIn 2021, the University of Edinburgh had the seventh-highest average entry standards amongst universities in the UK, with new undergraduates averaging 197 UCAS points, equivalent to just above AAAA in A-level grades [190] It gave offers of admission to 33% of its 18 year old applicants in 2022, the fourth-lowest amongst the Russell Group [195]\n\n\nGraduation\nAt graduation ceremonies, graduates are being 'capped' with the Geneva bonnet, which involves the university's principal tapping them on the head with the cap while they receive their graduation certificate [200] The velvet-and-silk hat has been used for over 150 years, and legend says that it was originally made from cloth taken from the breeches of 16th-century scholars John Knox or George Buchanan [201] However, when the hat was last restored in the early 2000s, a label dated 1849 was discovered bearing the name of Edinburgh tailor Henry Banks, although some doubt remains whether he manufactured or restored the hat [200] [202] In 2006, a university emblem that had been taken into space by astronaut and Edinburgh graduate Piers Sellers was incorporated into the Geneva bonnet [203]\n\n\nLibrary system\nPre-dating the university by three years, Edinburgh University Library was founded in 1580 through the donation of a large collection by Clement Litill, and today is the largest academic library collection in Scotland [204] [205] The Brutalist style eight-storey Main Library building in George Square was designed by Sir Basil Spence At the time of its completion in 1967, it was the largest building of its type in the UK, and today is a category A listed building [206] The library system also includes many specialised libraries at the college and school level [207]\n\n\nExchange programmes\nThe university offers students the opportunity to study in Europe and beyond via the European Union's Erasmus+ programme [d] and a variety of international exchange agreements with around 300 partners institutions in nearly 40 countries worldwide [209]\n\n\nRankings and reputation\nIn the 2021 Research Excellence Framework (REF), which evaluated work produced between 2014 and 2021, Edinburgh ranked 4th by research power and 15th by GPA amongst British universities [218] The university fell four places in GPA when compared to the 2014 REF, but retained its place in research power [219] 90 per cent of the university's research activity was judged to be 'world leading' (4*) or 'internationally excellent' (3*), and five departments – Computer Science, Informatics, Sociology, Anthropology, and Development Studies – were ranked as the best in the UK [220]\n\n\nStudent life\nEdinburgh University Students' Association (EUSA) consists of the students' union and the students' representative council EUSA's buildings include Teviot Row House, The Pleasance, Potterrow Student Centre, Kings Buildings House, as well as shops, cafés and refectories across the various campuses Teviot Row House is considered the oldest purpose-built student union building in the world [60] [237] Most of these buildings are operated as Edinburgh Festival Fringe venues during August EUSA represents students to the university and the wider world, and is responsible for over 250 student societies at the university The association has five sabbatical office bearers – a president and four vice presidents EUSA is affiliated with the National Union of Students (NUS).\n\n\nStudents' Association\nEdinburgh University Students' Association (EUSA) consists of the students' union and the students' representative council EUSA's buildings include Teviot

through the Edinburgh Festival Fringe [238]\n\n\nMedia\nThe Student is a fortnightly student newspaper Founded in 1887 by writer Robert Louis Stevenson, it is the oldest student newspaper in the United Kingdom [251] Former writers of the newspaper include politicians Gordon Brown, Robin Cook, and Lord Steel of Aikwood [252] [253] It has been independent of the university since 1992, but was forced to temporarily fold in 2002 due to increasing debts The newspaper won a number of student newspaper awards in the years following its relaunch [251]\n\n\nSport\nStudent sport at Edinburgh consists of clubs covering the more traditional rugby, football, rowing and judo, to the more unconventional korfball, gliding and mountaineering In 2021, the university had over 65 sports clubs run by Edinburgh University Sports Union (EUSU) [257]\n\n\nStudent activism\nThere are a number of campaigning societies at the university The largest of these include the environment and poverty campaigning group People & Planet and Amnesty International Society International development organisations include Edinburgh Global Partnerships, which was established as a student-led charity in 1990 [262] There is also a significant left-wing presence on campus, [263] including an anti-austerity group, Edinburgh University Anarchist Society, Edinburgh University Socialist Society, Edinburgh Young Greens, Feminist Society, LGBT+ Pride, [264] Marxist Society, and Students for Justice in Palestine [265]\n\n\nGaza protest\nIn May 2024, student activists set up a protest camp in the Old College Quad, with some also beginning a hunger strike, [272] and demanded divestment from companies they alleged supported the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip The campaign, backed by more than 600 staff and the students' union, [273] specifically targeted the university's investments in Alphabet Inc and Amazon, and its relationship with investment firm BlackRock [274] In response, Principal Mathieson emphasized that the university would respect peaceful protest rights, while also defending its investment practices [275] The university subsequently established a working group to review its investment policies related to \"armaments and controversial weapons\" [276] [277] and launched a consultation on ethical investing principles The protest camp was dismantled in June [278]\n\n\nStudent co-operatives\nThere are three student-run co-operatives associated with the University: Edinburgh Student Housing Co-operative (ESHC), providing affordable housing for 106 students; [279] the Hearty Squirrel Food Cooperative, providing local, organic and affordable food to students and staff; [280] and the SHRUB Coop, a swap and re-use hub aimed at reducing waste and promoting sustainability [281] Of these, only the Hearty Squirrel Co-operative operates on campus ESHC is based on the Bruntsfield Links south of the University's central campus, and hosts students from all three city universities and Edinburgh College The SHRUB co-operative was formed partly by University of Edinburgh students but is now run by interested members from across Edinburgh The co-operatives form part of the Students for Cooperation network [282]\n\n\nNotable people\nThe university is associated with some of the most significant intellectual and scientific contributions in human history, which include: the foundation of Antiseptic surgery (Joseph Lister), [283] Bayesian statistics (Thomas Bayes), [284] Economics (Adam Smith), [285] Electromagnetism (James Clerk

Formed in 1918 by Edwin Franko Goldman, the band underwent several leadership changes over the years, premiering numerous works by famous composers and performing at various notable concerts.\n\n**Conductors after Edwin Franko Goldman**\n\nAfter Goldman's death at age 78 in 1956, his son, Richard Franko Goldman, took the podium until 1979. The year before his death in 1980, Ainslee Cox served as co-conductor with Goldman beginning in 1968, and was sole conductor of the band from 1979 until his death in 1988. Gene Young succeeded Cox as director until 1997, followed by David Eaton (1997-2000), and the last conductor was Christian Wilhjelm.\n\nThe Goldman Band had a long history of working with renowned conductors, who brought their unique styles and interpretations to the band's performances. Despite the changes in leadership, the band continued to thrive, premiering new works and performing at various notable concerts.\n\n**Some Premieres**\n\nOver the years, a large number of famous composers have written for the band. The Goldman Band gave the first complete performance of Percy Grainger's composition \"Lincolnshire Posy\" in the summer of 1937. The first performance of Darius Milhaud's \"Suite française, Op 248\" was performed by the Goldman Band on June 13, 1945. The first performance of Arnold Schoenberg's \"Theme and Variations for Full Band, op.43a\" was performed by the Goldman Band on June 27, 1946, with Richard Franko Goldman conducting.\n\nThe band also premiered Robert Russell Bennett's \"Rose Variations for cornet and band\" with James F Burke as the cornet soloist. The band performed the American premiere of Hector Berlioz's \"Grande symphonie funèbre et triomphale\" on June 23, 1947, with a chorus of 200. The band premiered Bennett's last major composition for band, \"Autobiography,\" on June 22, 1977.\n\nThe Goldman Band's commitment to premiering new works and performing at notable concerts made it a respected institution in the world of concert bands.\n\n**Instrumentation**\n\nThe instrumentation of the Goldman Band between 1930-1956, when the band consisted of 64 members, was as follows:\n\n* Flutes: four\n* Oboes: two\n* E-flat clarinet: one\n* Bass clarinet: one\n* Clarinets: nineteen (eight firsts, six seconds, five thirds)\n* Alto saxophones: two\n* Tenor saxophone: one\n* Baritone saxophone: one\n* Bassoons: two\n* Cornets: four\n* Trumpets: four\n* French horns: five (clarification needed)\n* Trombones: six\n* Euphoniums: two\n* Tubas: four\n* String basses: two\n* Harp: one\n* Percussionists: three\n\nThe Goldman Band's instrumentation was typical of a large concert band, with a variety of woodwinds, brass, and percussion instruments.\n\n**Cornet and Trumpet Soloists**\n\nCornet solos were a featured attraction at most Goldman Band concerts.

attacking plays and distributing the ball to teammates once he won back possession, leading to him being derisively nicknamed \"the water-carrier\" by former France teammate Eric Cantona, who implied that Deschamps's primary contribution to the national team was to retrieve the ball and pass it forward to \"more talented\" players [10] [11] [12] Deschamps's ability to perform this role was made

"**Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) is a major political party in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The party was founded in 1949 by C. N. Annadurai, who also served as the party's first president. The DMK was formed as a result of a split from the Dravidar Kazhagam, a non-Brahmin movement that emerged in the 1920s. The party's ideology is based on the principles of social justice, equality, and self-respect, and it has been a significant force in Tamil Nadu politics since its inception.\n\n**History**\n\nThe DMK traces its roots to the South Indian Liberal Federation (Justice Party) founded by Dr C Natesa Mudaliar in 1916, in the presence of P Theagaraya Chetty, P T Rajan, T M Nair, Arcot Ramasamy Mudaliar and a few others in Victoria Public Hall Madras Presidency. The Justice Party, whose objectives included social equality and justice, came to power in the first general elections to the Madras Presidency in 1920. Communal division between Brahmins and non-Brahmin upper began in the presidency during the late-19th and early-20th century, mainly due to caste prejudices and disproportionate Brahminical representation in government jobs. The Justice Party's foundation marked the culmination of several efforts to establish an organization to represent the non-Brahmin upper castes in Madras and is seen as the start of the Dravidian movement.\n\n**C. N. Annadurai Era (1949-1969)**\n\nThe DMK's first foray into electoral politics, in the 1957 legislative assembly elections, was mixed. While it won 15 seats, many prominent leaders such as Annadurai and V R Nedunchezhiyan were defeated. It fared somewhat better in 1962, winning 50 seats and becoming the main opposition. The DMK, which split from the Dravidar Kazhagam in 1949, inherited the anti-Hindi imposition policies of its parent organization. Founder C.N Annadurai had earlier participated in the anti-Hindi imposition agitations during 1938–40 and throughout the 1940s.\n\n**Formation of State Government**\n\nIn 1967, DMK came to power in the Madras State 18 years after its formation and 10 years after it had first entered electoral politics. This began the Dravidian era in the Madras province, which later became Tamil Nadu. In 1967, the Congress lost nine states to opposition parties, but it was only in Madras that a single non-Congress Party (namely, the DMK) won a majority. The electoral victory of 1967 is also reputed to be an electoral fusion among the non-Congress parties to avoid a split in the Opposition votes. Rajagopalachari, a former senior leader of the Congress Party, had by then left the Congress and launched the right-wing Swatantra Party. He played a vital role in bringing about the electoral fusion amongst the opposition parties to align against the Congress. At that time, his cabinet was the youngest in the country.\n\n**Other Achievements**\n\nAnnadurai legalized self-respect marriages for the first time in the country. Such marriages did not involve priests presiding over the ceremonies, and thus a Brahmin was not needed to carry out the wedding. Self-respect marriages were a brainchild of Periyar, who regarded the then conventional marriages as mere financial arrangements which often led to great debt through dowry. Self-respect marriages, according to him, encouraged inter-caste marriages and caused arranged marriages to be replaced by love marriages.\n\n**M. Karunanidhi Era (1969-2018)**\n\nIn 1969, Annadurai unexpectedly died. M.Karunanidhi was elected as his successor, defeating rival candidate V R Nedunchezhiyan. Karunanidhi would continue to head the DMK until his own death in 2018. Karunanidhi died on 7 August 2018, leaving the party in the hands of his son, M K Stalin. Stalin had been appointed as the working president in January 2017 when his father's health started declining and had previously been named heir apparent by his father. Stalin thus became the second DMK president since the party's inception.\n\n**M. K. Stalin Era (2018-Present)**\n\nOn 3 February 2020, M K Stalin announced that Prashant Kishor was signed up as a party strategist for the upcoming 2021 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election.\n\n**Party Ideology**\n\nDravida Munnetra Kazhagam follows the principle of Duty, Dignity, and Discipline, as instructed by C N Annadurai. This involves protecting democratic rights in politics, establishing a non-dominant society, and carrying out reform work based on rationality to promote the revival of Dravidian ideology. The party aims to overcome poverty in the economic sphere and provide means for the well-being of all on an equitable basis. The party also aims to develop and promote the respective state languages without allowing other languages to dominate. The party believes in promoting the decentralization of powers from the Union government and creating autonomy in the states and federalism at the center.\n\n**Dravidian Nationalism**\n\nThe anti-Hindi Imposition agitations of 1965 forced the central government to abandon its efforts to use Hindi as the only official language of the country.\n\n**State Autonomy**\n\nAfter The Emergency invoked by Indira Gandhi, more state powers like education and medical care were moved from state control to national control. At the state conference in Trichy after the death of C.N Annadurai, M Karunanidhi announced the adoption of the \"state autonomy\" principle to advocate for state self-governance. In April 1974, the DMK government brought in a resolution in the House urging the Centre to accept the Rajamannar Committee recommendations on state autonomy and amend the Constitution of India to pave the way for a truly federal system.\n\n**Social Justice**\n\nDMK claims they are the successors of Justice Party. DMK played a crucial role alongside Periyar in the protest for the first constitutional amendment ensuring the provision legalizing OBC reservation. DMK's one of the core ideology is OBC welfare and has implemented reservation related policies in favor of OBCs and SCs.\n\n**Party Symbol**\n\nThe party's election symbol is the \"sun rising from between two mountains\", with a black and red flag often pictured. The symbol was inspired by the leader and scriptwriter M Karunanidhi's 1950s play Udaya Suryan and is intended to signify the \"rising\" spirit of the Dravidian people.\n\n**Electoral History**\n\nDMK has been a significant force in Tamil Nadu politics since its inception. The party has won several elections, including the 1967 state assembly elections, when it formed the government for the first time. In 1980, DMK won a majority in the state assembly and formed the government. Since then, the party has been in power for several terms, with M Karunanidhi serving as the Chief Minister for several terms.\n\n**Current Office Bearers and Prominent Members**\n\nM K Stalin is the current president of the DMK and has been at the helm since 2017. Other prominent members of the party include M K Stalin's wife, Durga Stalin, and his son, Udhayanidhi Stalin. Former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Edappadi K Palaniswami, is also a key member of the party.\n\n**List of Party Leaders**\n\n1. C N Annadurai (1949-1969)\n2. M Karunanidhi (1969-2018)\n3.

{"title": "Mao_Zedong", "content": "\nEnglish romanisation of name\nDuring Mao's lifetime, the English-language media universally rendered his name as Mao Tse-tung, using the Wade–Giles system of transliteration though with the circumflex accent in the syllable Tsê dropped Due to its recognizability, the spelling was used widely, even by the PRC's foreign ministry after Hanyu Pinyin became the PRC's official romanisation system for Mandarin Chinese in 1958; the well-known booklet of Mao's political statements, The Little Red Book, was officially entitled Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung in English translations While the pinyin-derived spelling Mao Zedong is increasingly common, the Wade–Giles-derived spelling Mao Tse-tung continues to be used in modern publications to some extent [2]\n\n\nEarly life\nMao Zedong was born on 26 December 1893, near Shaoshan village in Hunan [3] His father, Mao Yichang, was a formerly impoverished peasant who had become one of the wealthiest farmers in Shaoshan Growing up in rural Hunan, Mao described his father as a stern disciplinarian, who would beat him and his three siblings, the boys Zemin and Zetan, as well as an adopted sister/cousin, Zejian [4] Mao's mother, Wen Qimei, was a devout Buddhist who tried to temper her husband's strict attitude [5] Mao too became a Buddhist, but abandoned this faith in his mid-teenage years [5] At age 8, Mao was sent to Shaoshan Primary School Learning the value systems of Confucianism, he later admitted that he did not enjoy the classical Chinese texts preaching Confucian morals, instead favouring classic novels like Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Water Margin [6] At age 13, Mao finished primary education, and his father united him in an arranged marriage to the 17-year-old Luo Yixiu, thereby uniting their land-owning families Mao refused to recognise her as his wife, becoming a fierce critic of arranged marriage and temporarily moving away Luo was locally disgraced and died in 1910 at 20 years old [7]\n\n\nYouth and the Xinhai Revolution: 1893–1911\nMao Zedong was born on 26 December 1893, near Shaoshan village in Hunan [3] His father, Mao Yichang, was a formerly impoverished peasant who had become one of the wealthiest farmers in Shaoshan Growing up in rural Hunan, Mao described his father as a stern disciplinarian, who would beat him and his three siblings, the boys Zemin and Zetan, as well as an adopted sister/cousin, Zejian [4] Mao's mother, Wen Qimei, was a devout Buddhist who tried to temper her husband's strict attitude [5] Mao too became a Buddhist, but abandoned this faith in his mid-teenage years [5] At age 8, Mao was sent to Shaoshan Primary School Learning the value systems of Confucianism, he later admitted that he did not enjoy the classical Chinese texts preaching Confucian morals, instead favouring classic novels like Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Water Margin [6] At age 13, Mao finished primary education, and his father united him in an arranged marriage to the 17-year-old Luo Yixiu, thereby uniting their land-owning families Mao refused to recognise her as his wife, becoming a fierce critic of arranged marriage and temporarily moving away Luo was locally disgraced and died in 1910 at 20 years old [7]\n\n\nFourth Normal School of Changsha: 1912–1919\nOver the next few years, Mao Zedong enrolled and dropped out of a police academy, a soap-production school, a law school, an economics school, and the government-run Changsha Middle School [24] Studying independently, he spent much time in Changsha's library, reading core works of classical liberalism such as Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations and Montesquieu's The Spirit of the Laws, as well as the works of western scientists and philosophers such as Darwin, Mill, Rousseau, and Spencer [25] Viewing himself as an intellectual, years later he admitted that at this time he thought himself better than working people [26] He was inspired by Friedrich Paulsen, a neo-Kantian philosopher and educator whose emphasis on the achievement of a carefully defined goal as the highest value led Mao to believe that strong individuals were not bound by moral codes but should strive for a great goal [27] His father saw no use in his son's intellectual pursuits, cut off his allowance and forced him to move into a hostel for the destitute [28]\n\n\nEarly revolutionary activity\nMao moved to Beijing, where his mentor Yang Changji had taken a job at Peking University [39] Yang thought Mao exceptionally \"intelligent and handsome\", [40] securing him a job as assistant to the university librarian Li Dazhao, who would become an early Chinese Communist [41] Li authored a series of New Youth articles on the October Revolution in Russia, during which the Communist Bolshevik Party under the leadership of Vladimir Lenin had seized power Lenin was an advocate of the socio-political theory of Marxism, first developed by the German sociologists Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, and Li's articles added Marxism to the doctrines in Chinese revolutionary movement [42]\n\n\nBeijing, anarchism, and Marxism: 1917–1919\nMao moved to Beijing, where his mentor Yang Changji had taken a job at Peking University [39] Yang thought Mao exceptionally \"intelligent and handsome\", [40] securing him a job as assistant to the university librarian Li Dazhao, who would become an early Chinese Communist [41] Li authored a series of New Youth articles on the October Revolution in Russia, during which the Communist Bolshevik Party under the leadership of Vladimir Lenin had seized power Lenin was an advocate of the socio-political theory of Marxism, first developed by the German sociologists Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, and Li's articles added Marxism to the doctrines in Chinese revolutionary movement [42]\n\n\nNew Culture and political protests: 1919–1920\nOn 4 May 1919, students in Beijing gathered at Tiananmen to protest the Chinese government's weak resistance to Japanese expansion in China Patriots were outraged at the influence given to Japan in the Twenty-One Demands in 1915, the complicity of Duan Qirui's Beiyang government, and the betrayal of China in the Treaty of Versailles, wherein Japan was allowed to receive territories in Shandong which had been surrendered by Germany These demonstrations ignited the nationwide May Fourth Movement and fuelled the New Culture Movement which blamed China's diplomatic defeats on social and cultural backwardness [49]\n\n\nFounding the Chinese Communist Party: 1921–1922\nThe Chinese Communist Party was founded by Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao in the Shanghai French Concession in 1921 as a study society and informal network Mao set up a Changsha branch, also establishing a branch of the Socialist Youth Corps and a Cultural Book Society which opened a bookstore to propagate revolutionary literature throughout Hunan [61] He was involved in the movement for Hunan autonomy, in the hope that a Hunanese constitution would increase civil liberties and make his revolutionary activity easier When the movement was successful in establishing provincial autonomy under a new warlord, Mao forgot his involvement [62] [clarification needed] By 1921, small Marxist groups existed in Shanghai, Beijing, Changsha, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Jinan; it was decided to hold a central meeting, which began in Shanghai on 23 July 1921 The first session of the National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party was attended by 13 delegates, Mao included After the authorities sent a police spy to the congress, the delegates moved to a boat on South Lake near Jiaxing, in Zhejiang, to escape detection Although Soviet and Comintern delegates attended, the first congress ignored Lenin's advice to accept a temporary alliance between the Communists and the \"bourgeois democrats\" who also advocated national revolution; instead they stuck to the orthodox Marxist belief that only the urban proletariat could lead a socialist revolution [63]\n\n\nCollaboration with the Kuomintang: 1922–1927\nAt the Third Congress of the Communist Party in Shanghai in June 1923, the delegates reaffirmed their commitment to working with the KMT Supporting this position, Mao was elected to the Party Committee, taking up residence in Shanghai [72] At the First KMT Congress, held in Guangzhou in early 1924, Mao was elected an alternate member of the KMT Central Executive Committee, and put forward four resolutions to decentralise power to urban and rural bureaus His enthusiastic support for the KMT earned him the suspicion of Li Li-san, his Hunan comrade [73]\n\n\nCivil War\nFresh from the success of the Northern Expedition against the warlords, Chiang turned on the Communists, who by now numbered in the tens of thousands across China Chiang ignored the orders of the Wuhan-based left KMT government and marched on Shanghai, a city controlled by Communist militias As the Communists awaited Chiang's arrival, he loosed the White Terror, massacring 5,000 with the aid of the Green Gang [84] [87] In Beijing, 19 leading Communists were killed by Zhang Zuolin [88] [89] That May, tens of thousands of Communists and those suspected of being communists were killed, and the CCP lost approximately 15,000 of its 25,000 members [89]\n\n\nNanchang and Autumn Harvest Uprisings: 1927\nFresh from the success of the Northern Expedition against the warlords, Chiang turned on the Communists, who by now numbered in the tens of thousands across China Chiang ignored the orders of the Wuhan-based left KMT government and marched on Shanghai, a city controlled by Communist militias As the Communists awaited Chiang's arrival, he loosed the White Terror, massacring 5,000 with the aid of the Green Gang [84] [87] In Beijing, 19 leading Communists were killed by Zhang Zuolin [88] [89] That May, tens of thousands of Communists and those suspected of being communists were killed, and the CCP lost approximately 15,000 of its 25,000 members [89]\n\n\nBase in Jinggangshan: 1927–1928\n革命不是請客吃飯，不是做文章，不是繪畫繡花，不能那樣雅緻，那樣從容不迫，文質彬彬，那樣溫良恭讓。革命是暴動，是一個階級推翻一個階級的暴烈的行動。Revolution is not a dinner party, nor an essay, nor a painting, nor a piece of embroidery; it cannot be so refined, so leisurely and gentle, so temperate, kind, courteous, restrained and magnanimous A revolution is an insurrection, an act of violence by which one class overthrows another.\n\n\nJiangxi Soviet Republic of China: 1929–1934\nIn January 1929, Mao and Zhu evacuated the base with 2,000 men and a further 800 provided by Peng, and took their armies south, to the area around Tonggu and Xinfeng in Jiangxi [105] The evacuation led to a drop in morale, and many troops became disobedient and began thieving; this worried Li Lisan and the Central Committee, who saw Mao's army as lumpenproletariat, that were unable to share in proletariat class consciousness [106] [107] In keeping with orthodox Marxist thought, Li believed that only the urban proletariat could lead a successful revolution, and saw little need for Mao's peasant guerrillas; he ordered Mao to disband his army into units to be sent out to spread the revolutionary message Mao replied that while he concurred with Li's theoretical position, he would not disband his army nor abandon his base [107] [108] Both Li and Mao saw the Chinese revolution as the key to world revolution, believing that a CCP victory would spark the overthrow of global imperialism and capitalism In this, they disagreed with the official line of the Soviet government and Comintern Officials in Moscow desired greater control over the CCP and removed Li from power by calling him to Russia for an inquest into his errors [109] They replaced him with Soviet-educated Chinese Communists, known as the \"28 Bolsheviks\", two of whom, Bo Gu and Zhang Wentian, took control of the Central Committee Mao disagreed with the new leadership, believing they grasped little of the Chinese situation, and he soon emerged as their key rival [110] [111]\n\n\nLong March: 1934–1935\nOn 14 October 1934, the Red Army broke through the KMT line on the Jiangxi Soviet's south-west corner at Xinfeng with 85,000 soldiers and 15,000 party cadres and embarked on the \"Long March\" In order to make the escape, many of the wounded and the ill, as well as women and children, were left behind, defended by a group of guerrilla fighters whom the KMT massacred [121] The 100,000 who escaped headed to southern Hunan, first crossing the Xiang River after heavy fighting, [122] and then the Wu River, in Guizhou where they took Zunyi in January 1935 Temporarily resting in the city, they held a conference; here, Mao was elected to a position of leadership, becoming Chairman of the Politburo, and de facto leader of both Party and Red Army, in part because his candidacy was supported by Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin Insisting that they operate as a guerrilla force, he laid out a destination: the Shenshi Soviet in Shaanxi, Northern China, from where the Communists could focus on fighting the Japanese Mao believed that in focusing on the anti-imperialist struggle, the Communists would earn the trust of the Chinese people, who in turn would renounce the KMT [123]\n\n\nWorld War II\nMao's troops arrived at the Yan'an Soviet during October 1935 and settled in Bao'an, until spring 1936 While there, they developed links with local communities, redistributed and farmed the land, offered medical treatment, and began literacy programs [131] Mao now commanded 15,000 soldiers, boosted by the arrival of He Long's men from Hunan and the armies of Zhu De and Zhang Guotao returned from Tibet [132] In February 1936, they established the North West Anti-Japanese Red Army University in Yan'an, through which they trained increasing numbers of new recruits [133] In January 1937, they began the \"anti-Japanese expedition\", that sent groups of guerrilla fighters into Japanese-controlled territory to undertake sporadic attacks [134] In May 1937, a Communist Conference was held in Yan'an to discuss the situation [135] Western reporters also arrived in the \"Border Region\" (as the Soviet had been renamed); most notable were Edgar Snow, who used his experiences as a basis for Red Star Over China, and Agnes Smedley, whose accounts brought international attention to Mao's cause [136]\n\n\nLeadership of China\n\nIn 1948, the People's Liberation Army starved out the Kuomintang forces occupying Changchun At least 160,000 civilians are believed to have perished during the siege, which lasted from June until October PLA lieutenant colonel Zhang Zhenglu, in his book White Snow, Red Blood, compared it to Hiroshima: \"The casualties were about the same Hiroshima took nine seconds; Changchun took five months.\" [154] On 21 January 1949, Kuomintang forces suffered great losses in decisive battles against Mao's forces [155] In the early morning of 10 December 1949, PLA troops laid siege to Chongqing and Chengdu on mainland China, and Chiang Kai-shek fled from the mainland to Taiwan [155] [156]\n\nEstablishment of the People's Republic of China\n\nIn 1948, the People's Liberation Army starved out the Kuomintang forces occupying Changchun At least 160,000 civilians are believed to have perished during the siege, which lasted from June until October PLA lieutenant colonel Zhang Zhenglu, in his book White Snow, Red Blood, compared it to Hiroshima: \"The casualties were about the same Hiroshima took nine seconds; Changchun took five months.\" [154] On 21 January 1949, Kuomintang forces suffered great losses in decisive battles against Mao's forces [155] In the early morning of 10 December 1949, PLA troops laid siege to Chongqing and Chengdu on mainland China, and Chiang Kai-shek fled from the mainland to Taiwan [155] [156]\n\nKorean War\nMao pushed the Party to organise campaigns to reform society and extend control These campaigns were given urgency in October 1950, when the People's Volunteer Army was sent into the Korean War and fight as well as to reinforce the armed forces of North Korea, the Korean People's Army, which had been in full retreat The United States placed a trade embargo on the People's Republic as a result of its involvement in the Korean War, lasting until Richard Nixon's improvements of relations At least 180,000 Chinese troops died during the war [161]\n\n\nSocial reform\nDuring the land reform campaigns, large numbers of landlords and rich peasants were beaten to death at mass meetings as land was taken from them and given to poorer peasants, which reduced economic inequality [163] [164] The Campaign to Suppress Counter-revolutionaries [165] targeted bureaucratic bourgeoisie, such as compradors, merchants and Kuomintang officials who were seen by the party as economic parasites or political enemies [166] In 1976, the U.S State Department estimated as many as a million were killed in the land reform, and 800,000 killed in the counter-revolutionary campaign [167]\n\n\nThree-anti and Five-anti Campaigns\nStarting in 1951, Mao initiated movements to rid urban areas of corruption, the Three-anti and Five-anti Campaigns Whereas the three-anti campaign was a focused purge of government, industrial and party officials, the five-anti campaign set its sights slightly broader, targeting capitalist elements in general [179] Workers denounced their bosses, spouses turned on their spouses, and children informed on their parents; the victims were often humiliated at struggle sessions, where a targeted person would be verbally and physically abused until they confessed to crimes Mao insisted that minor offenders be criticised and reformed or sent to labour camps, \"while the worst among them should be shot\" These campaigns took several hundred thousand additional lives, the vast majority via suicide [180]\n\n\nFive-year plans\nFollowing the consolidation of power, Mao launched the first five-year plan (1953–1958), which emphasised rapid industrial development Within industry, iron and steel, electric power, coal, heavy engineering, building materials, and basic chemicals were prioritised with the aim of constructing large and highly capital-intensive plants Many of these plants were built with Soviet assistance and heavy industry grew rapidly [183] Agriculture, industry and trade was organised as worker cooperatives [184] This period marked the beginning of China's rapid industrialisation and it resulted in an enormous success [185]\n\n\nMilitary projects\nUnited States President Dwight D Eisenhower's threats during the First Taiwan Strait Crisis to use nuclear weapons against military targets in Fujian province prompted Mao to begin China's nuclear program [190]: 89–90  Under Mao's Two Bombs, One Satellite program, China developed the atomic and hydrogen bombs in record time [quantify] and launched a satellite a few years after the Soviet Union launched Sputnik [191]: 218 \n\n\nGreat Leap Forward\nIn January 1958, Mao launched the Great Leap Forward, to turn China from an agrarian nation to an industrialised one [195] The relatively small agricultural collectives that had been formed were merged into far larger people's communes, and many peasants were ordered to work on infrastructure projects and on the production of iron and steel Some private food production was banned, and livestock and farm implements were brought under collective ownership [196]\n\n\nSplit from Soviet Union\nThe Sino-Soviet split resulted in Nikita Khrushchev's withdrawal of Soviet technical experts and aid from the country The split concerned the leadership of world communism The USSR had a network of Communist parties it supported; China now created its own rival network to battle it out [205] Lorenz M Lüthi writes: \"The Sino-Soviet split was one of the key events of the Cold War, equal in importance to the construction of the Berlin Wall, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Second Vietnam War, and Sino-American rapprochement The split helped to determine the framework of the Second Cold War in general, and influenced the course of the Second Vietnam War in particular.\" [206]\n\n\nThird Front\nAfter the Great Leap Forward, China's leadership slowed the pace of industrialization [210]: 3  It invested more on in China's coastal regions and focused on the production of consumer goods [210]: 3  Preliminary drafts of the Third Five Year Plan contained no provision for developing large scale industry in China's interior [210]: 29  After an April 1964 General Staff report concluded that the concentration of China's industry in its major coastal cities made it vulnerable to attack by foreign powers, Mao argued for the development of basic industry and national defense industry in protected locations in China's interior [210]: 4, 54  Although other key leaders did not initially support the idea, the 2 August 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident increased fears of a potential invasion by the United States and crystallized support for Mao's industrialization proposal, which came to be known as the Third Front [210]: 7  Following the Gulf of Tonkin incident, Mao's own concerns of invasion by the United States increased [211]: 100  He wrote to central cadres, \"A war is going to break out I need to reconsider my actions\" and pushed even harder for the creation of the Third Front [211]: 100 \n\n\nGreat Proletarian Cultural Revolution\nDuring the early 1960s, Mao became concerned with the nature of post-1959 China He saw that the old ruling elite was replaced by a new one He was concerned that those in power were becoming estranged from the people they were to serve Mao believed that a revolution of culture would unseat and unsettle the \"ruling class\" and keep China in a state of \"continuous revolution\" that, theoretically, would serve the interests of the majority, rather than a tiny and privileged elite [213]\n\n\nState visits\nDuring his leadership, Mao traveled outside China, which were state visits to the Soviet Union His first visit abroad was in December 1949 to celebrate the 70th birthday of Joseph Stalin in Moscow, which was also attended by East German Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Walter Ulbricht and Mongolian communist General Secretary Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal [223] The second visit to Moscow in November 1957 was a two-week state visit of which the highlights included Mao's attendance at the 40th anniversary (Ruby Jubilee) celebrations of the October Revolution (he attended the annual military parade of the Moscow Garrison on Red Square as well as a banquet in the Moscow Kremlin) and the International Meeting of Communist and Workers Parties, where he met with other communist leaders [224]\n\n\nDeath and aftermath\nMao's health declined in his last years, probably aggravated by his chain-smoking [225] It became a state secret that he suffered from multiple lung and heart ailments during his later years [226] There are unconfirmed reports that he possibly had Parkinson's disease [227] [228] in addition to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease [229] He suffered two major heart attacks, one in March and another in July, then a third on 5 September, rendering him an invalid He died nearly four days later, on 9 September 1976, at the age of 82 The Communist Party delayed the announcement of his death until 16:00, when a national radio broadcast announced the news and appealed for party unity [228]\n\n\nLegacy\nMao has been regarded as one of the most important and influential individuals in the 20th century [238] [239] He has also been described as a political intellect, theorist, military strategist, poet, and visionary [240] He was credited and praised for driving imperialism out of China, [241] having unified China and for ending the previous decades of civil war He has also been credited with having improved the status of women in China and for improving literacy and education [177] [242] [243] [244] In December 2013, a poll from the state-run Global Times indicated that roughly 85% of the 1,045 respondents surveyed felt that Mao's achievements outweighed his mistakes [245] It has been said in China that Mao was 70 percent right and 30 percent wrong [10]: 55  [237]: 445 \n\n\nIn China\nIn mainland China, Mao is respected by a great number of the general population Mao is credited for raising the average life expectancy from 35 in 1949 to 63 by 1975, bringing \"unity and stability to a country that had been plagued by civil wars and foreign invasions\", and laying the foundation for China to \"become the equal of the great global powers\" [264] He is lauded for carrying out massive land reform, promoting the status of women, improving popular literacy, and positively \"transform(ing) Chinese society beyond recognition.\" [264] Mao has been credited for boosting literacy (only 20% of the population could read in 1949, compared to 65.5% thirty years later), doubling life expectancy, a near doubling of the population, and developing China's industry and infrastructure, paving the way for its position as a world power [265] [243] [244]\n\n\nOutside China\nPhilip Short said that the overwhelming majority of the deaths under Mao were unintended consequences of famine [250] Short stated that landlord class were not exterminated as a people due to Mao's belief in redemption through thought reform, [250] and compared Mao with 19th-century Chinese reformers who challenged China's traditional beliefs in the era of China's clashes with Western colonial powers Short writes that \"Mao's tragedy and his grandeur were that he remained to the end in thrall to his own revolutionary dreams .. He freed China from the straitjacket of its Confucian past, but the bright Red future he promised turned out to be a sterile purgatory.\" [250]\n\n\nThird World\nThe ideology of Maoism has influenced many Communists, mainly in the Third World, including revolutionary movements such as Cambodia's Khmer Rouge, [285] Peru's Shining Path, and the Nepalese revolutionary movement Under the influence of Mao's agrarian socialism and Cultural Revolution, Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge conceived of his disastrous Year Zero policies which purged the nation of its teachers, artists and intellectuals and emptied its cities, resulting in the Cambodian genocide [286] The Revolutionary Communist Party, USA, also claims Marxism–Leninism-Maoism as its ideology, as do other Communist Parties around the world which are part of the Revolutionary Internationalist Movement China itself has moved sharply away from Maoism since Mao's death, and most people outside of China who describe themselves as Maoist regard the Deng Xiaoping reforms to be a betrayal of Maoism, in line with Mao's view of \"capitalist roaders\" within the Communist Party [287] As the Chinese government instituted market economic reforms starting in the late 1970s and as later Chinese leaders took power, less recognition was given to the status of Mao This accompanied a decline in state recognition of Mao in later years in contrast to previous years when the state organised numerous events and seminars commemorating Mao's 100th birthday Nevertheless, the Chinese government has never officially repudiated the tactics of Mao Deng Xiaoping, who was opposed to the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, stated that \"when we write about his mistakes we should not exaggerate, for otherwise we shall be discrediting Chairman Mao Zedong and this would mean discrediting our party and state.\" [288]\n\n\nMilitary strategy\nMao's military writings continue to have a large amount of influence both among those who seek to create an insurgency and those who seek to crush one, especially in manners of guerrilla warfare, at which Mao is popularly regarded as a genius [289] The Nepali Maoists were highly influenced by Mao's views on protracted war, new democracy, support of masses, permanency of revolution and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution [290] Mao's major contribution to the military science is his theory of People's War, with not only guerrilla warfare but more importantly, Mobile Warfare methodologies Mao had successfully applied Mobile Warfare in the Korean War, and was able to encircle, push back and then halt the UN forces in Korea, despite the clear superiority of UN firepower [291]\n\n\nLiterature\nMao's poems and writings are frequently cited by both Chinese and non-Chinese The official Chinese translation of President Barack Obama's inauguration speech used a famous line from one of Mao's poems [292] In the mid-1990s, Mao's picture began to appear on all new renminbi currency from the People's Republic of China This was officially instituted as an anti-counterfeiting measure as Mao's face is widely recognised in contrast to the generic figures that appear in older currency On 13 March 2006, the People's Daily reported that a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference proposed to include the portraits of Sun Yat-sen and Deng Xiaoping in the renminbi [293]\n\n\nPublic image\nMao gave contradicting statements on the subject of personality cults In 1956, as a response to the Khrushchev Report that criticised Joseph Stalin, Mao stated that personality cults are \"poisonous ideological survivals of the old society\", and reaffirmed China's commitment to collective leadership [294] At the 1958 party congress in Chengdu, Mao expressed support for the personality cults of people whom he labelled as genuinely worthy figures, not those that expressed \"blind worship\" [295]\n\n\nGenealogy\nMao's ancestors

influenced by the great Tang dynasty poets Li Bai and Li He [330]\n\n\nPortrayal in media\nMao has been portrayed in film and television numerous times Some notable actors include: Han Shi, the first

"article": "**Mao Zedong**\n\nMao Zedong (December 26, 1893 – September 9, 1976) was a Chinese revolutionary, politician, and founding father of the People's Republic of China. He was a key figure in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and led the Communist Party of China to victory in the Chinese Civil War against the Nationalist Party (KMT).\n\n**Early Life**\n\nMao was born in Shaoshan village, Hunan Province, in a peasant family. His father, Mao Yichang, was a former peasant who became a wealthy farmer. Mao's mother, Wen Qimei, was a devout Buddhist who tried to temper her husband's strict attitude. Mao became a Buddhist, but later abandoned this faith in his mid-teenage years.\n\n**Youth and the Xinhai Revolution: 1893–1911**\n\nMao's early education began with Chinese classical literature. He told Edgar Snow in 1936 that he had started studying the Confucian Analects and the Four Books at a village school when he was eight, but that the books he most enjoyed reading were Water Margin, Journey to the West, the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and Dream of the Red Chamber.\n\n**Fourth Normal School of Changsha: 1912–1919**\n\nMao enrolled and dropped out of a police academy, a soap-production school, a law school, an economics school, and the government-run Changsha Middle School. Studying independently, he spent much time in Changsha's library, reading core works of classical liberalism such as Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations and Montesquieu's The Spirit of the Laws.\n\n**Beijing, Anarchism, and Marxism: 1917–1919**\n\nMao moved to Beijing, where his mentor Yang Changji had taken a job at Peking University. Yang thought Mao exceptionally \"intelligent and handsome,\" securing him a job as assistant to the university librarian Li Dazhao, who would become an early Chinese Communist.\n\n**New Culture and Political Protests: 1919–1920**\n\nOn May 4, 1919, students in Beijing gathered at Tiananmen to protest the Chinese government's weak resistance to Japanese expansion in China. Patriots were outraged at the influence given to Japan in the Twenty-One Demands in 1915, the complicity of Duan Qirui's Beiyang government, and the betrayal of China in the Treaty of Versailles.\n\n**Founding the Chinese Communist Party: 1921–1922**\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party was founded by Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao in the Shanghai French Concession in 1921 as a study society and informal network. Mao set up a Changsha branch, also establishing a branch of the Socialist Youth Corps and a Cultural Book Society which opened a bookstore to propagate revolutionary literature throughout Hunan.\n\n**Collaboration with the Kuomintang: 1922–1927**\n\nMao was elected to the Party Committee, taking up residence in Shanghai. At the First KMT Congress, held in Guangzhou in early 1924, Mao was elected an alternate member of the KMT Central Executive Committee, and put forward four resolutions to decentralise power to urban and rural bureaus.\n\n**Civil War**\n\nFresh from the success of the Northern Expedition against the warlords, Chiang turned on the Communists, who by now numbered in the tens of thousands across China. Chiang ignored the orders of the Wuhan-based left KMT government and marched on Shanghai, a city controlled by Communist militias.\n\n**Nanchang and Autumn Harvest Uprisings: 1927**\n\nMao's forces suffered a series of defeats in the early 1920s, including the failed Nanchang Uprising in August 1927 and the Autumn Harvest Uprising in September 1927.\n\n**Base in Jinggangshan: 1927–1928**\n\nMao evacuated the base with 2,000 men and took their armies south, to the area around Tonggu and Xinfeng in Jiangxi. Mao laid out a destination: the Shenshi Soviet in Shaanxi, Northern China.\n\n**Long March: 1934–1935**\n\nOn October 14, 1934, the Red Army broke through the KMT line on the Jiangxi Soviet's south-west corner at Xinfeng with 85,000 soldiers and 15,000 party cadres and embarked on the Long March.\n\n**World War II**\n\nMao's troops arrived at the Yan'an Soviet during October 1935 and settled in Bao'an, until spring 1936. Mao now commanded 15,000 soldiers, boosted by the arrival of He Long's men from Hunan and the armies of Zhu De and Zhang Guotao returned from Tibet.\n\n**Establishment of the People's Republic of China**\n\nIn 1948, the People's Liberation Army starved out the KMT forces occupying Changchun. At least 160,000 civilians are believed to have perished during the siege, which lasted from June until October.\n\n**Korean War**\n\nMao pushed the Party to organise campaigns to reform society and extend control. These campaigns were given urgency in October 1950, when the People's Volunteer Army was sent into the Korean War and fight as well as to reinforce the armed forces of North Korea, the Korean People's Army, which had been in full retreat.\n\n**Social Reform**\n\nDuring the land reform campaigns, large numbers of landlords and rich peasants were beaten to death at mass meetings as land was taken from them and given to poorer peasants. The Campaign to Suppress Counter-revolutionaries targeted bureaucratic bourgeoisie, such as compradors, merchants and KMT officials who were seen by the party as economic parasites or political enemies.\n\n**Three-anti and Five-anti Campaigns**\n\nStarting in 1951, Mao initiated movements to rid urban areas of corruption, the Three-anti and Five-anti Campaigns. Workers denounced their bosses, spouses turned on their spouses, and children informed on their parents; the victims were often humiliated at struggle sessions.\n\n**Five-year Plans**\n\nFollowing the consolidation of power, Mao launched the first five-year plan (1953-1958), which emphasised rapid industrial development. Agriculture, industry and trade was organised as worker cooperatives.\n\n**Great Leap Forward**\n\nIn January 1958, Mao launched the Great Leap Forward, to turn China from an agrarian nation to an industrialised one. The relatively small agricultural collectives that had been formed were merged into far larger people's communes, and many peasants were ordered to work on infrastructure projects and on the production of iron and steel.\n\n**Split from Soviet Union**\n\nThe Sino-Soviet split resulted in Nikita Khrushchev's withdrawal of Soviet technical experts and aid from the country. The split concerned the leadership of world communism.\n\n**Third Front**\n\nAfter the Great Leap Forward, China's leadership slowed the pace of industrialization. It invested more on in China's coastal regions and focused on the production of consumer goods. Preliminary drafts of the Third Five Year Plan contained no provision for developing large scale industry in China's interior.\n\n**Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution**\n\nDuring the early 1960s, Mao became concerned with the nature of post-1959 China. He saw that the old ruling elite was replaced by a new one. Mao believed that a revolution of culture would unseat and unsettle the \"ruling class\" and keep China in a state of \"continuous revolution\" that, theoretically, would serve the interests of the majority, rather than a tiny and privileged elite.\n\n**Military Strategy**\n\nMao's military writings continue to have a large amount of influence both among those who seek to create an insurgency and those who seek to crush one, especially in manners of guerrilla warfare, at which Mao is popularly regarded as a genius.\n\n**Literature**\n\nMao's poems and writings are frequently cited by both Chinese and non-Chinese.

outline:\n\n\nEnglish romanisation of name\nDuring Mao's lifetime, the English-language media universally rendered his name as Mao Tse-tung, using the Wade–Giles system of transliteration though with the circumflex accent in the syllable Tsê dropped Due to its recognizability, the spelling was used widely, even by the PRC's foreign ministry after Hanyu Pinyin became the PRC's official romanisation system for Mandarin Chinese in 1958; the well-known booklet of Mao's political statements, The Little Red Book, was officially entitled Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung in English translations While the pinyin-derived spelling Mao Zedong is increasingly common, the Wade–Giles-derived spelling Mao Tse-tung continues to be used in modern publications to some extent [2]\n\n\nEarly life\nMao Zedong was born on 26 December 1893, near Shaoshan village in Hunan [3] His father, Mao Yichang, was a formerly impoverished peasant who had become one of the wealthiest farmers in Shaoshan Growing up in rural Hunan, Mao described his father as a stern disciplinarian, who would beat him and his three siblings, the boys Zemin and Zetan, as well as an adopted sister/cousin, Zejian [4] Mao's mother, Wen Qimei, was a devout Buddhist who tried to temper her husband's strict attitude [5] Mao too became a Buddhist, but abandoned this faith in his mid-teenage years [5] At age 8, Mao was sent to Shaoshan Primary School Learning the value systems of Confucianism, he later admitted that he did not enjoy the classical Chinese texts preaching Confucian morals, instead favouring classic novels like Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Water Margin [6] At age 13, Mao finished primary education, and his father united him in an arranged marriage to the 17-year-old Luo Yixiu, thereby uniting their land-owning families Mao refused to recognise her as his wife, becoming a fierce critic of arranged marriage and temporarily moving away Luo was locally disgraced and died in 1910 at 20 years old

soap-production school, a law school, an economics school, and the government-run Changsha Middle School [24] Studying independently, he spent much time in Changsha's library, reading core works of classical liberalism such as Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations and Montesquieu's The Spirit of the Laws, as well as the works of western scientists and philosophers such as Darwin, Mill, Rousseau, and Spencer [25] Viewing himself as an intellectual, years later he admitted that at this time he thought himself better than working people [26] He was inspired by Friedrich Paulsen, a neo-Kantian philosopher and educator whose emphasis on the achievement of a carefully defined goal as the highest value led Mao to believe that strong individuals were not bound by moral codes but should strive for a great goal [27] His father saw no use in his son's intellectual pursuits, cut off his allowance and forced him to move into a hostel for the destitute [28]\n\n\nEarly revolutionary activity\nMao moved to Beijing, where his mentor Yang Changji had taken a job at Peking University [39] Yang thought Mao exceptionally \"intelligent and handsome\", [40] securing him a job as assistant to the university librarian Li Dazhao, who would become an early Chinese Communist [41] Li authored a series of New Youth articles on the October Revolution in Russia, during which the Communist Bolshevik Party under the leadership of Vladimir Lenin had seized power Lenin was an advocate of the socio-political theory of Marxism, first developed by the German sociologists Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, and Li's articles added Marxism to the doctrines in Chinese revolutionary movement [42]\n\n\nBeijing, anarchism, and Marxism: 1917–1919\nMao moved to Beijing, where his mentor Yang Changji had taken a

of Versailles, wherein Japan was allowed to receive territories in Shandong which had been surrendered by Germany These demonstrations ignited the nationwide May Fourth Movement and fuelled the New Culture Movement which blamed China's diplomatic defeats on social and cultural backwardness [49]\n\n\nFounding the Chinese Communist Party: 1921–1922\nThe Chinese Communist Party was founded by Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao in the Shanghai French Concession in 1921 as a study society and informal network Mao set up a Changsha branch, also establishing a branch of the Socialist Youth Corps and a Cultural Book Society which opened a bookstore to propagate revolutionary literature throughout Hunan [61] He was involved in the movement for Hunan autonomy, in the hope that a Hunanese constitution would increase civil liberties and make his revolutionary activity easier When the movement was successful in establishing provincial autonomy under a new warlord, Mao forgot his involvement [62] [clarification needed] By 1921, small Marxist groups existed in Shanghai, Beijing, Changsha, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Jinan; it was decided to hold a central meeting, which began in Shanghai on 23 July 1921 The first session of the National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party was attended by 13 delegates, Mao included After the authorities sent a police spy to the congress, the delegates moved to a boat on South Lake near Jiaxing, in Zhejiang, to escape detection Although Soviet and Comintern delegates attended, the first congress ignored Lenin's advice to accept a temporary alliance between the Communists and the \"bourgeois democrats\" who also advocated national revolution; instead they stuck to the orthodox Marxist belief that only the urban proletariat could lead a socialist revolution [63]\n\n\nCollaboration with the Kuomintang: 1922–1927\nAt the Third Congress of the Communist Party in Shanghai in June 1923, the delegates reaffirmed their commitment to working with the KMT Supporting this position, Mao was elected to the Party Committee, taking up residence in Shanghai [72] At the First KMT Congress, held in Guangzhou in early 1924, Mao was elected an alternate member of the KMT Central Executive Committee, and put forward four resolutions to decentralise power to urban and rural bureaus His enthusiastic support for the KMT earned him the suspicion of Li Li-san, his Hunan comrade [73]\n\n\nCivil War\nFresh from the success of the Northern Expedition against the warlords, Chiang turned on the Communists, who by now numbered in the tens of thousands across China Chiang ignored the orders of the Wuhan-based left KMT government and marched on Shanghai, a city controlled by Communist militias As the Communists awaited Chiang's arrival, he loosed the White Terror, massacring 5,000 with the aid of the Green Gang [84] [87] In Beijing, 19 leading Communists were killed by Zhang Zuolin [88] [89] That May, tens of thousands of Communists and those suspected of being communists were killed, and the CCP lost approximately 15,000 of its 25,000 members [89]\n\n\nNanchang and Autumn Harvest Uprisings: 1927\nFresh from the success of the Northern

piece of embroidery; it cannot be so refined, so leisurely and gentle, so temperate, kind, courteous, restrained and magnanimous A revolution is an insurrection, an act of violence by which one class overthrows another.\n\n\nJiangxi Soviet Republic of China: 1929–1934\nIn January 1929, Mao and Zhu evacuated the base with 2,000 men and a further 800 provided by Peng, and took their armies south, to the area around Tonggu and Xinfeng in Jiangxi [105] The evacuation led to a drop in morale, and many troops became disobedient and began thieving; this worried Li Lisan and the Central Committee, who saw Mao's army as lumpenproletariat, that were unable to share in proletariat class consciousness [106] [107] In keeping with orthodox Marxist thought, Li believed that only the urban proletariat could lead a successful revolution, and saw little need for Mao's peasant guerrillas; he ordered Mao to disband his army into units to be sent out to spread the revolutionary message Mao replied that while he concurred with Li's theoretical position, he would not disband his army nor abandon his base [107] [108] Both Li and Mao saw the Chinese revolution as the key to world revolution, believing that a CCP victory would spark the overthrow of global imperialism and capitalism In this, they disagreed with the official line of the Soviet government and Comintern Officials in Moscow desired greater control over the CCP and removed Li from power by calling him to Russia for an inquest into his errors [109] They replaced him with Soviet-educated Chinese Communists, known as the \"28 Bolsheviks\", two of whom, Bo Gu and Zhang Wentian, took control of the Central Committee Mao disagreed with the new leadership, believing they grasped little of the Chinese situation, and he soon emerged as their key rival [110] [111]\n\n\nLong March: 1934–1935\nOn 14 October 1934, the Red Army broke through the KMT line on the Jiangxi Soviet's south-west corner at Xinfeng with 85,000 soldiers and 15,000 party cadres and embarked on the \"Long March\" In order to make the escape, many of the wounded and the ill, as well as women and children, were left behind, defended by a group of guerrilla fighters whom the KMT massacred [121] The 100,000 who escaped headed to southern Hunan, first crossing the Xiang River after heavy fighting, [122] and then the Wu River, in Guizhou where they took Zunyi in January 1935 Temporarily resting in the city, they held a conference; here, Mao was elected to a position of leadership, becoming Chairman of the Politburo, and de facto leader of both Party and Red Army, in part because his candidacy was supported by Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin Insisting that they operate as a guerrilla force, he laid out a destination: the Shenshi Soviet in Shaanxi, Northern China, from where the Communists could focus on fighting the Japanese Mao believed that in focusing on the anti-imperialist struggle, the Communists would earn the trust of the Chinese people, who in turn would renounce the KMT [123]\n\n\nWorld War II\nMao's troops arrived at the Yan'an Soviet during October 1935 and settled in Bao'an, until spring 1936 While there, they developed links with local communities, redistributed and farmed the land, offered medical treatment, and began literacy programs [131] Mao now commanded 15,000 soldiers, boosted by the arrival of He Long's men from Hunan and the armies of Zhu De and Zhang Guotao returned from Tibet [132] In February 1936, they established the North West Anti-Japanese Red Army University in Yan'an, through which they trained increasing numbers of new recruits [133] In January 1937, they began the \"anti-Japanese expedition\", that sent groups of guerrilla fighters into Japanese-controlled territory to undertake sporadic attacks [134] In May 1937, a Communist Conference was held in Yan'an to discuss the situation [135] Western reporters also arrived in the \"Border Region\" (as the Soviet had been renamed); most notable were Edgar Snow, who used his experiences as a basis for Red Star Over China, and Agnes Smedley, whose accounts brought international attention to Mao's cause [136]\n\n\nLeadership of China\n\nIn 1948, the People's Liberation Army starved out the Kuomintang forces occupying Changchun At least 160,000 civilians are believed to have perished during the siege, which lasted from June until October PLA lieutenant colonel Zhang Zhenglu, in his book White Snow, Red Blood, compared it to Hiroshima: \"The casualties were about the same Hiroshima took nine seconds; Changchun took five months.\" [154] On 21 January 1949, Kuomintang forces suffered great losses in decisive battles against Mao's forces [155] In the early morning of 10 December 1949, PLA troops laid siege to Chongqing and Chengdu on mainland China, and Chiang Kai-shek fled from the mainland to Taiwan [155] [156]\n\nEstablishment of the People's Republic of China\n\nIn 1948, the People's Liberation Army starved out the Kuomintang forces occupying Changchun At least 160,000 civilians are believed to have perished during the siege, which lasted from June until October PLA lieutenant colonel Zhang Zhenglu, in his book White Snow, Red Blood, compared it to Hiroshima: \"The casualties were about the same Hiroshima took nine seconds; Changchun took five months.\" [154] On 21 January 1949, Kuomintang forces suffered great losses in decisive battles against Mao's forces [155] In the early morning of 10 December 1949, PLA troops laid siege to Chongqing and Chengdu on mainland China, and Chiang Kai-shek fled from the mainland to Taiwan [155] [156]\n\nKorean War\nMao pushed the Party to organise campaigns to reform society and extend control These campaigns were given urgency in October 1950, when the People's Volunteer Army was sent into the Korean War and fight as well as to reinforce the armed forces of North Korea, the Korean People's Army, which had been in full retreat The United States placed a trade embargo on the People's Republic as a result of its involvement in the Korean War, lasting until Richard Nixon's improvements of relations At least 180,000 Chinese troops died during the war [161]\n\n\nSocial reform\nDuring the land reform campaigns, large numbers of landlords and rich peasants were beaten to death at mass meetings as land was taken from them and given to poorer peasants, which reduced economic inequality [163] [164] The Campaign to Suppress Counter-revolutionaries [165] targeted bureaucratic bourgeoisie, such as compradors, merchants and Kuomintang officials who were seen by the party as economic parasites or political enemies [166] In 1976, the U.S State Department estimated as many as a million were killed in the land reform, and 800,000 killed in the counter-revolutionary campaign [167]\n\n\nThree-anti and Five-anti Campaigns\nStarting in 1951, Mao initiated movements to rid urban areas of corruption, the Three-anti and Five-anti Campaigns Whereas the three-anti campaign was a focused purge of government, industrial and party officials, the five-anti campaign set its sights slightly broader, targeting capitalist elements in general [179] Workers denounced their bosses, spouses turned on their spouses, and children informed on their parents; the victims were often humiliated at struggle sessions, where a targeted person would be verbally and physically abused until they confessed to crimes Mao insisted that minor offenders be criticised and reformed or sent to labour camps, \"while the worst among them should be shot\" These campaigns took several hundred thousand additional lives, the vast majority via suicide [180]\n\n\nFive-year plans\nFollowing the consolidation of power, Mao launched the first five-year plan (1953–1958), which emphasised rapid industrial development Within industry, iron and steel, electric power, coal, heavy engineering, building materials, and basic chemicals were prioritised with the aim of constructing large and highly capital-intensive plants Many of these plants were built with Soviet assistance and heavy industry grew rapidly [183] Agriculture, industry and trade was organised as worker cooperatives [184] This period marked the beginning of China's rapid industrialisation and it resulted in an enormous success [185]\n\n\nMilitary projects\nUnited States President Dwight D Eisenhower's threats during the First Taiwan Strait Crisis to use nuclear weapons against military targets in Fujian province prompted Mao to begin China's nuclear program [190]: 89–90  Under Mao's Two Bombs, One Satellite program, China developed the atomic and hydrogen bombs in record time [quantify] and launched a satellite a few years after the Soviet Union launched Sputnik [191]: 218 \n\n\nGreat Leap Forward\nIn January 1958, Mao launched the Great Leap Forward, to turn China from an agrarian nation to an industrialised one [195] The relatively small agricultural collectives that had been formed were merged into far larger people's communes, and many peasants were ordered to work on infrastructure projects and on the production of iron and steel Some private food production was banned, and livestock and farm implements were brought under collective ownership [196]\n\n\nSplit from Soviet Union\nThe Sino-Soviet split resulted in Nikita Khrushchev's withdrawal of Soviet technical experts and aid from the country The split concerned the leadership of world communism The USSR had a network of Communist parties it supported; China now created its own rival network to battle it out [205] Lorenz M Lüthi writes: \"The Sino-Soviet split was one of the key events of the Cold War, equal in importance to the construction of the Berlin Wall, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Second Vietnam War, and Sino-American rapprochement The split helped to determine the framework of the Second Cold War in general, and influenced the course of the Second Vietnam War in particular.\" [206]\n\n\nThird Front\nAfter the Great Leap Forward, China's leadership slowed the pace of industrialization [210]: 3  It invested more on in China's coastal regions and focused on the production of consumer goods [210]: 3  Preliminary drafts of the Third Five Year Plan contained no provision for developing large scale industry in China's interior [210]: 29  After an April 1964 General Staff report concluded that the concentration of China's industry in its major coastal cities made it vulnerable to attack by foreign powers, Mao argued for the development of basic industry and national defense industry in protected locations in China's interior [210]: 4, 54  Although other key leaders did not initially support the idea, the 2 August 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident increased fears of a potential invasion by the United States and crystallized support for Mao's industrialization proposal, which came to be known as the Third Front [210]: 7  Following the Gulf of Tonkin incident, Mao's own concerns of invasion by the United States increased [211]: 100  He wrote to central cadres, \"A war is going to break out I need to reconsider my actions\" and pushed even harder for the creation of the Third Front [211]: 100 \n\n\nGreat Proletarian Cultural Revolution\nDuring the early 1960s, Mao became concerned with the nature of post-1959 China He saw that the old ruling elite was replaced by a new one He was concerned that those in power were becoming estranged from the people they were to serve Mao believed that a revolution of culture would unseat and unsettle the \"ruling class\" and keep China in a state of \"continuous revolution\" that, theoretically, would serve the interests of the majority, rather than a tiny and privileged elite [213]\n\n\nState visits\nDuring his leadership, Mao traveled outside China, which were state visits to the Soviet Union His first visit abroad was in December 1949 to celebrate the 70th birthday of Joseph Stalin in Moscow, which was also attended by East German Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Walter Ulbricht and Mongolian communist General Secretary Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal [223] The second visit to Moscow in November 1957 was a two-week state visit of which the highlights included Mao's attendance at the 40th anniversary (Ruby Jubilee) celebrations of the October Revolution (he attended the annual military parade of the Moscow Garrison on Red Square as well as a banquet in the Moscow Kremlin) and the International Meeting of Communist and Workers Parties, where he met with other communist leaders [224]\n\n\nDeath and aftermath\nMao's health declined in his last years, probably aggravated by his chain-smoking [225] It became a state secret that he suffered from multiple lung and heart ailments during his later years [226] There are unconfirmed reports that he possibly had Parkinson's disease [227] [228] in addition to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease [229] He suffered two major heart attacks, one in March and another in July, then a third on 5 September, rendering him an invalid He died nearly four days later, on 9 September 1976, at the age of 82 The Communist Party delayed the announcement of his death until 16:00, when a national radio broadcast announced the news and appealed for party unity [228]\n\n\nLegacy\nMao has been regarded as one of the most important and influential individuals in the 20th century [238] [239] He has also been described as a political intellect, theorist, military strategist, poet, and visionary [240] He was credited and praised for driving imperialism out of China, [241] having unified China and for ending the previous decades of civil war He has also been credited with having improved the status of women in China and for improving literacy and education [177] [242] [243] [244] In December 2013, a poll from the state-run Global Times indicated that roughly 85% of the 1,045 respondents surveyed felt that Mao's achievements outweighed his mistakes [245] It has been said in China that Mao was 70 percent right and 30 percent wrong [10]: 55  [237]: 445 \n\n\nIn China\nIn mainland China, Mao is respected by a great number of the general population Mao is credited for raising the average life expectancy from 35 in 1949 to 63 by 1975, bringing \"unity and stability to a country that had been plagued by civil wars and foreign invasions\", and laying the foundation for China to \"become the equal of the great global powers\" [264] He is lauded for carrying out massive land reform, promoting the status of women, improving popular literacy, and positively \"transform(ing) Chinese society beyond recognition.\" [264] Mao has been credited for boosting literacy (only 20% of the population could read in 1949, compared to 65.5% thirty years later), doubling life expectancy, a near doubling of the population, and developing China's industry and infrastructure, paving the way for its position as a world power [265] [243] [244]\n\n\nOutside China\nPhilip Short said that the overwhelming majority of the deaths under Mao were unintended consequences of famine [250] Short stated that landlord class were not exterminated as a people due to Mao's belief in redemption through thought reform, [250] and compared Mao with 19th-century Chinese reformers who challenged China's traditional beliefs in the era of China's clashes with Western colonial powers Short writes that \"Mao's tragedy and his grandeur were that he remained to the end in thrall to his own revolutionary dreams .. He freed China from the straitjacket of its Confucian past, but the bright Red future he promised turned out to be a sterile purgatory.\" [250]\n\n\nThird World\nThe ideology of Maoism has influenced many Communists, mainly in the Third World, including revolutionary movements such as Cambodia's Khmer Rouge, [285] Peru's Shining Path, and the Nepalese revolutionary movement Under the influence of Mao's agrarian socialism and Cultural Revolution, Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge conceived of his disastrous Year Zero policies which purged the nation of its teachers, artists and intellectuals and emptied its cities, resulting in the Cambodian genocide [286] The Revolutionary Communist Party, USA, also claims Marxism–Leninism-Maoism as its ideology, as do other Communist Parties around the world which are part of the Revolutionary Internationalist Movement China itself has moved sharply away from Maoism since Mao's death, and most people outside of China who describe themselves as Maoist regard the Deng Xiaoping reforms to be a betrayal of Maoism, in line with Mao's view of \"capitalist roaders\" within the Communist Party [287] As the Chinese government instituted market economic reforms starting in the late 1970s and as later Chinese leaders took power, less recognition was given to the status of Mao This accompanied a decline in state recognition of Mao in later years in contrast to previous years when the state organised numerous events and seminars commemorating Mao's 100th birthday Nevertheless, the Chinese government has never officially repudiated the tactics of Mao Deng Xiaoping, who was opposed to the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, stated that \"when we write about his mistakes we should not exaggerate, for otherwise we shall be discrediting Chairman Mao Zedong and this would mean discrediting our party and state.\" [288]\n\n\nMilitary strategy\nMao's military writings continue to have a large amount of influence both among those who seek to create an insurgency and those who seek to crush one, especially in manners of guerrilla warfare, at which Mao is popularly regarded as a genius [289] The Nepali Maoists were highly influenced by Mao's views on protracted war, new democracy, support of masses, permanency of revolution and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution [290] Mao's major contribution to the military science is his theory of People's War, with not only guerrilla warfare but more importantly, Mobile Warfare methodologies Mao had successfully applied Mobile Warfare in the Korean War, and was able to encircle, push back and then halt the UN forces in Korea, despite the clear superiority of UN firepower [291]\n\n\nLiterature\nMao's poems and writings are frequently cited by both Chinese and non-Chinese The official Chinese translation of President Barack Obama's inauguration speech used a famous line from one of Mao's poems [292] In the mid-1990s, Mao's picture began to appear on all new renminbi currency from the People's Republic of China This was officially instituted as an anti-counterfeiting measure as Mao's face is widely recognised in contrast to the generic figures that appear in older currency On 13 March 2006, the People's Daily reported that a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference proposed to include the portraits of Sun Yat-sen and Deng Xiaoping in the renminbi [293]\n\n\nPublic image\nMao gave contradicting statements on the subject of personality cults In 1956, as a response to the Khrushchev Report that criticised Joseph Stalin, Mao stated that personality cults are \"poisonous ideological survivals of the old society\", and reaffirmed China's commitment to collective leadership [294] At the 1958 party congress in Chengdu, Mao expressed support for the personality cults of people whom he labelled as genuinely worthy figures, not those that expressed \"blind worship\" [295]\n\n\nGenealogy\nMao's ancestors were:\n\n\nAncestors\nMao's ancestors were:\n\n\nWives\nMao had four wives who gave birth to a total of 10 children, among them:\n\n\nSiblings\nMao had several siblings:\n\n\nChildren\nMao had a total of ten children, [306] including:\n\n\nPersonal life\nMao's private life was kept very secret at the time of his rule After Mao's death, Li Zhisui, his personal physician, published The Private Life of Chairman Mao, a memoir which mentions some aspects of Mao's private life, such as chain-smoking cigarettes, addiction to powerful sleeping pills and large number of sexual partners [312] Some scholars and others who knew Mao personally have disputed the accuracy of these accounts and characterisations [313]\n\n\nWritings and calligraphy\n鷹擊長空，\n魚翔淺底，\n萬類霜天競自由。\n悵寥廓，\n問蒼茫大地，\n誰主沉浮\n\n\nLiterary works\nMao's education began with Chinese classical literature Mao told Edgar Snow in 1936 that he had started the study of the Confucian Analects and the Four Books at a village school when he was eight, but that the books he most enjoyed reading were Water Margin, Journey to the West, the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Dream of the Red Chamber [329] Mao published poems in classical forms starting in his youth and his abilities as a poet contributed to his image in China after he came to power in 1949 His style was influenced by the great Tang dynasty poets Li Bai and Li He [330]\n\n\nPortrayal in media\nMao has been portrayed in film and television numerous times Some notable actors include: Han Shi, the first actor ever to have portrayed Mao, in a 1978 drama Dielianhua and later again in a 1980 film Cross the Dadu River; [331] Gu Yue, who had portrayed Mao 84 times on screen throughout his 27-year career and had won the Best Actor title at the Hundred Flowers Awards in 1990 and 1993; [332] [333] Liu Ye, who played a young Mao in The Founding of a Party (2011); [334] Tang Guoqiang, who has frequently portrayed Mao in more recent times, in the films The Long March (1996) and The Founding of a Republic (2009), and the television series Huang Yanpei (2010), among others [335] Mao is a principal character in American composer John Adams' opera Nixon in China (1987) The Beatles' song \"Revolution\" refers to Mao in the verse \"but if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao you ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow...\"; [336] John Lennon expressed regret over including these lines in the song in 1972 [337]\n\n\nSee also\nWar is the highest form of struggle for resolving

{"title": "Mary_River_Mine", "content": "\nBackground\nThe Mary River area has \"long been known to Inuit as Nuluujaat, a landmark used to travel through North Baffin Island\" [7] in what is now known as Qikiqtani Region, Nunavut.\n\n\nCanadian context\nAs of 2009, Canada, with 7.9 billion tons of iron ore reserves, had nearly 42% of the global iron ore resources [12] The majority of the iron ore in Canada comes from Nunavut's Mary River Mine and from Schefferville, Quebec, which is in the Labrador Trough [13] In 2017 Canadian iron ore mines produced 49 million tons of iron ore in concentrate pellets and 13.6 million tons of crude steel Of the 13.6 million tons of steel 7 million was exported, and 43.1 million tons of iron ore was exported at a value of $4.6 billion Of the iron ore exported 38.5% of the volume was iron ore pellets with a value of $2.3 billion and 61.5% was iron ore concentrates with a value of $2.3 billion [13]\n\n\nIron ore market\nIron ore is the \"most expensive ingredient in steelmaking.\" [12] Because of its abundance worldwide, the iron ore market is volatile and subject to fluctuations The iron ore industry is cyclical [18]: 13 \n\n\nConstruction\nBy 2007, construction of a tote road connecting Mary River mine to Milne Inlet was already underway Milne Inlet is a shallow inlet that was only ice-free from August to October and opened onto the environmentally sensitive waters of Eclipse Sound and the protected waterways surrounding Bylot Island and Sirmilik National Park, for which Pond Inlet is the gateway hamlet According to David K Joyce who visited the site in the summer of 2007, the road was expected to carry hundreds of 200 tonne dump trucks per day, every day, for several decades [21] By August 2007, the US subprime mortgage crisis had negatively impacted Canadian commercial paper, causing it to suddenly crash [4]  \nWith 95% of Baffinland's CA$45.9 million invested in commercial paper—which would normally be very reliable—they had to get an emergency line of credit to pay for provisions for the hundreds of workers, fuel and equipment [9] [22]  McCreary, who served as the company's CEO from 2004 until March 2010, [23]  began to seriously seek out investors Shipping the ore seemed to become more viable as the Arctic sea ice was shrinking.\n\n\nOperations\nOn May 28, 2014, the NIRB approved Baffinland's Early Revenue Phase proposal after a review that took place from 2013 to 2014 Baffinland's initial Early Revenue Phase allowed the company to haul and ship up to 4.2 metric tons per year [42] [3]: 2 \n\n\nEarly Revenue Phase\nOn May 28, 2014, the NIRB approved Baffinland's Early Revenue Phase proposal after a review that took place from 2013 to 2014 Baffinland's initial Early Revenue Phase allowed the company to haul and ship up to 4.2 metric tons per year [42] [3]: 2 \n\n\nPhase 2 Proposal\nPrior to its formal submission of its October 29, 2014 its Mary River Phase 2 Proposal to the Nunavut Planning Commission (NPC), Baffinland had begun to request major changes to its 2012 regulations, within a year of the completion of NIRD's 2012 environmental review [46] Phase 2 expansion also includes plans for an increase of up to 176-ships transitting through the \"environmentally sensitive waters\" of Eclipse Sound before reaching the open sea [47] It included extending the shipping season to ten months with the shipping season ending on November 15 [41]: 2 \n\n\nPhase 2 amendment rejected by NPC\nWhen the Nunavut Planning Commission (NPC) announced on April 8, 2015, that BIMC's Phase 2 amended project had not conformed to requirements under the NBRLUP, [62] in a controversial move by the AAND minister immediately gave Baffinland an exemption, that bypassed Nunavut's regulatory channels, which led to the beginning of a second multi-year NIRB assessment process that has continued into 2021 A 2015 Nunavut News article said that the federal government had placed itself at the \"centre of a big regulatory fight\" over BIMC's \"ambitious and controversial expansion plan\" for the Mary River Mine [55]\n\n\n2017 amendment\nOn February 3, 2017, Baffinland requested an expansion of the Mary River-Milne Bay transportation corridor, which was granted on March 18, 2018 [41]: 1 \n\n\n2018 amendment\nOn April 23, 2018, Baffinland submitted a request to the NPC and NIRB to amend the NBRLUP and Mary River project certificate, which increased the total production/shipping amount from 18 to 22.2 Mtpa, with an additional 4.2 Mtpa of ore being transported by truck over the Mary River-Milne Inlet \"tote road\" they had already constructed [41] In their August 2018, general summary, Baffinland described this amendment to the Phase 2 proposal as having an increase  from 6 Mtpa to 12 Mpta, as well as, the construction of a new North Railway that would run parallel to the existing Milne Inlet \"tote road\" In the Phase 2 proposal 2018 amendment, the total mine production would eventually increase to 30 Mtpa This includes the original certificate of 18 Mpta transported on the South Railway, and the 12 Mpta transported on the North Railway and shipped through Milne Inlet [41]: 2  These increased production projections with an annual production of 30 million tonnes of iron ore was to be achieved by constructing two railways, north and south, and by using both Milne Bay and Steensby Inlet for shipping [70] [28]\n\n\nTransportation\nBy 2021, the only operational port was in Milne Inlet with a shipping route that including transitting through protected waters surrounding Bylot Island Baffinland has plans to develop a second port on Steensby Inlet in the south with a more environmentally sensitive route through Foxe Basin and Davis Strait A third potential ship route is through the Northwest Passage [72]\n\n\nShipping routes and carriers\nBy 2021, the only operational port was in Milne Inlet with a shipping route that including transitting through protected waters surrounding Bylot Island Baffinland has plans to develop a second port on Steensby Inlet in the south with a more environmentally sensitive route through Foxe Basin and Davis Strait A third potential ship route is through the Northwest Passage [72]\n\n\nSteensby Inlet port\nBaffinland's NIRB 2012 certificate authorizes them to develop and use an \"all-season deep-water port and ship loading facility\" [28] at Steensby Inlet on the coast of southeast Baffin Island The southern route from Steensby Inlet through  Foxe Basin south through Davis Strait to the Atlantic, is the more environmentally sensitive route [73]\n\n\nMilne Inlet port facilities\nHowever, as iron ore prices declined significantly from 2013 onwards, Baffinland chose the less capital intensive option of developing marine infrastructure at Milne Inlet By 2015, there a small port had been constructed at Milne Inlet and was ready for the August shipping date [2]\n\n\nBulk carriers\nIn their initial 2008 plans using the Steensby Inlet port, in full operation there would be nine icebreaking freighters each displacing 190,000 tonnes, subcontracted with Fednav Group and filled every two days, shipping 18 million tonnes annually via Foxe Basin and Davis Strait to markets in Europe and elsewhere [29]\n\n\nIce-breakers\nOn July 4, 2018, Baffinland contracted for the services of the large Estonian icebreaker MSV Botnica from a subsidiary of AS Tallinna Sadam, for the months July through October The icebreaker provides \"escort ice management services, oil spill and emergency response services\" [75] [78]\n\n\nAir transport\nThere is a 1,983 m (6,505 ft) runway at the Mary River mine site [79] [80] Baffinland workers are transported to and from the Mary River mine site by air Workers based at Milne Inlet use ground transportation to reach the mine site [41]: 4  The Phase 2 proposal will be making use of the public airstrips Arctic Bay, Clyde River, Hall Beach, Igloolik, and Pond Inlet—the five closest hamlets—and Iqaluit to transport workers to and from worksites [41]: 15 \n\n\nMary River Aerodrome\nIn 2013, Nolinor Aviation began a service to Mary River Aerodrome carrying passengers and cargo on every second day from Kitchener/Waterloo via Iqaluit using a Boeing 737-200 combi aircraft The Mary River Aerodrome, having a medium length gravel runway, was constructed adjacent to the base area Flights are chartered by the mining company and operated by Chrono Aviation.\n\n\nRail\nBy 2007, the construction and operation of a \"large-tonnage railway year-round in Arctic conditions...built on permafrost\" was an ambitious part of the mining development plan [21] The South Railway was integral to the 2008 initial submission However, by 2013 investment funds in mining had dried up as the price of iron ore had declined in 2012 Mary River project investors radically scaled back capital funds from CA$4 billion to CA$740 million, cancelling both the proposed South Railway and port development [15] [16] [83]\n\n\nSouth Railway\nBy 2007, the construction and operation of a \"large-tonnage railway year-round in Arctic conditions...built on permafrost\" was an ambitious part of the mining development plan [21] The South Railway was integral to the 2008 initial submission However, by 2013 investment funds in mining had dried up as the price of iron ore had declined in 2012 Mary River project investors radically scaled back capital funds from CA$4 billion to CA$740 million, cancelling both the proposed South Railway and port development [15] [16] [83]\n\n\nNorth railway\nIn February 2016, Baffinland requested permission for another major change in Phase 2 [93] [94] In Phase 2, 4.2 million tons per year of iron ore was to be trucked on tote road to Milne Inlet In 2015 Baffinland requested permission to truck 12 million tons to Milne Inlet Nunavut authorities informed Baffinland that a change of that scale would require an additional extensive environmental review  Six months later Baffinland announced that they would build a northern railway line running adjacent to the tote road to transport the iron ore to Milne Inlet Baffinland already had the license to ship 18 million tons of ore to Steensby Inlet on the South Railway [93]\n\n\nMary River - Milne Inlet tote road\nIn 2010, when Nunavut Iron Ore Acquisition Company and ArcelorMittal were engaged in the bidding war, an alternate proposal to the South Railway cold-weather railway, was under consideration [38] [44] By 2011, the projected cost of the South Railway had quadrupled from its 2006 estimate of  CA$350 million [27] In this alternate proposal ore would be hauled by truck The advantage to this approach would smaller start-up costs, and a shorter period before ore was shipped to market Disadvantages were higher operating costs, making the price of a ton of ore approximately double that under the rail proposal, and a smaller capacity of ore, 3,000,000 t (3,000,000 long tons; 3,300,000 short tons) per year, as opposed to the 20,000,000 t (20,000,000 long tons; 22,000,000 short tons) per year under the rail proposal Waheed and Murray's Nunavut Iron Ore Acquisition Company suggested it would be cheaper to construct a tote road route from Mary River Mine to Milne Inlet, rather than the more expensive but more environmentally sensitive South Railway cold-weather railway The tote road approach seemed to have been abandoned temporarily, when the Nunavut Iron and ArcelorMittal agreed to a partnership  In late 2014, after the South Railway had spent several years undergoing its environmental impact assessment, the railway plan was shelved [48] [49]\n\n\nRevenues and expenses\nBaffinland operates on investments, not revenues from iron production and sales, and according to a February 2021 report commissioned by Baffinland by Graeme Clinton for the NIRB assessment, the company has had a huge deficit since 2016 [83] [100] The investors who acquired the company in 2011, were attracted by the quality of the iron ore and the record high prices of iron ore With the sharp decline in iron ore prices, investors are unwillingly to undertake capital intense projects such as the CA$5.7 billion South Railway [83] [101] [16]\n\n\nInuit birthright organizations\nWith the creation of Nunavut in

"en", "article": "Mary River Mine\n\nThe Mary River Mine is an iron ore mine located on Baffin Island, in the Canadian territory of Nunavut. The mine is operated by Baffinland Iron Mines Corporation, a Canadian mining company.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Mary River area has long been known to Inuit as Nuluujaat, a landmark used to travel through North Baffin Island. The area has been home to the Inuit for centuries, with the current population residing in five hamlets, including Pond Inlet, which is the largest hamlet and closest to the mine.\n\nCanadian Context\n\nAs of 2009, Canada was the world's second-largest producer of iron ore, with nearly 42% of the global iron ore reserves. The majority of Canada's iron ore comes from Nunavut's Mary River Mine and from Schefferville, Quebec, which is in the Labrador Trough. In 2017, Canadian iron ore mines produced 49 million tons of iron ore in concentrate pellets and 13.6 million tons of crude steel. Of the 13.6 million tons of steel, 7 million tons was exported, and 43.1 million tons of iron ore was exported at a value of $4.6 billion. Of the iron ore exported, 38.5% of the volume was iron ore pellets with a value of $2.3 billion and 61.5% was iron ore concentrates with a value of $2.3 billion.\n\nIron Ore Market\n\nIron ore is the most expensive ingredient in steelmaking. Because of its abundance worldwide, the iron ore market is volatile and subject to fluctuations. The iron ore industry is cyclical, with prices fluctuating based on global demand and supply.\n\nConstruction\n\nBy 2007, construction of a tote road connecting Mary River mine to Milne Inlet was already underway. Milne Inlet is a shallow inlet that was only ice-free from August to October and opened onto the environmentally sensitive waters of Eclipse Sound and the protected waterways surrounding Bylot Island and Sirmilik National Park. According to David K Joyce, who visited the site in the summer of 2007, the road was expected to carry hundreds of 200-tonne dump trucks per day, every day, for several decades. By August 2007, the US subprime mortgage crisis had negatively impacted Canadian commercial paper, causing it to suddenly crash. With 95% of Baffinland's CA$45.9 million invested in commercial paper, which would normally be very reliable, they had to get an emergency line of credit to pay for provisions for the hundreds of workers, fuel, and equipment.\n\nOperations\n\nOn May 28, 2014, the NIRB approved Baffinland's Early Revenue Phase proposal after a review that took place from 2013 to 2014. Baffinland's initial Early Revenue Phase allowed the company to haul and ship up to 4.2 metric tons per year.\n\nEarly Revenue Phase\n\nThe Early Revenue Phase allowed Baffinland to begin shipping iron ore from the Mary River mine to Milne Inlet, which is a shallow inlet that is only ice-free from August to October. The shipping route included transitting through the environmentally sensitive waters of Eclipse Sound and the protected waterways surrounding Bylot Island and Sirmilik National Park.\n\nPhase 2 Proposal\n\nPrior to its formal submission of its October 29, 2014, its Mary River Phase 2 Proposal to the Nunavut Planning Commission (NPC), Baffinland had begun to request major changes to its 2012 regulations, within a year of the completion of NIRD's 2012 environmental review. Phase 2 expansion also includes plans for an increase of up to 176 ships transitting through the environmentally sensitive waters of Eclipse Sound before reaching the open sea. It included extending the shipping season to ten months with the shipping season ending on November 15.\n\nPhase 2 Amendment Rejected by NPC\n\nWhen the Nunavut Planning Commission (NPC) announced on April 8, 2015, that Baffinland's Phase 2 amended project had not conformed to requirements under the NBRLUP, in a controversial move by the AAND minister immediately gave Baffinland an exemption, that bypassed Nunavut's regulatory channels, which led to the beginning of a second multi-year NIRB assessment process that has continued into 2021. A 2015 Nunavut News article said that the federal government had placed itself at the \"centre of a big regulatory fight\" over BIMC's \"ambitious and controversial expansion plan\" for the Mary River Mine.\n\n2017 Amendment\n\nOn February 3, 2017, Baffinland requested an expansion of the Mary River-Milne Bay transportation corridor, which was granted on March 18, 2018.\n\n2018 Amendment\n\nOn April 23, 2018, Baffinland submitted a request to the NPC and NIRB to amend the NBRLUP and Mary River project certificate, which increased the total production/shipping amount from 18 to 22.2 Mtpa, with an additional 4.2 Mtpa of ore being transported by truck over the Mary River-Milne Inlet \"tote road\" they had already constructed.\n\nTransportation\n\nBy 2021, the only operational port was in Milne Inlet with a shipping route that included transitting through protected waters surrounding Bylot Island. Baffinland has plans to develop a second port on Steensby Inlet in the south with a more environmentally sensitive route through Foxe Basin and Davis Strait. A third potential ship route is through the Northwest Passage.\n\nSteensby Inlet Port\n\nBaffinland's NIRB 2012 certificate authorizes them to develop and use an \"all-season deep-water port and ship loading facility\" at Steensby Inlet on the coast of southeast Baffin Island. The southern route from Steensby Inlet through Foxe Basin south through Davis Strait to the Atlantic is the more environmentally sensitive route.\n\nMilne Inlet Port Facilities\n\nHowever, as iron ore prices declined significantly from 2013 onwards, Baffinland chose the less capital-intensive option of developing marine infrastructure at Milne Inlet. By 2015, there was a small port had been constructed at Milne Inlet and was ready for the August shipping date.\n\nBulk Carriers\n\nIn their initial 2008 plans using the Steensby Inlet port, in full operation, there would be nine icebreaking freighters each displacing 190,000 tonnes, subcontracted with Fednav Group and filled every two days, shipping 18 million tonnes annually via Foxe Basin and Davis Strait to markets in Europe and elsewhere.\n\nIce-Breakers\n\nOn July 4, 2018, Baffinland contracted for the services of the large Estonian icebreaker MSV Botnica from a subsidiary of AS Tallinna Sadam, for the months July through October. The icebreaker provides \"escort ice management services, oil spill, and emergency response services\".\n\nAir Transport\n\nThere is a 1,983-metre runway at the Mary River mine site. Baffinland workers are transported to and from the Mary River mine site by air. Workers based at Milne Inlet use ground transportation to reach the mine site. The Phase 2 proposal will be making use of the public airstrips Arctic Bay, Clyde River, Hall Beach, Igloolik, and Pond Inlet—the five closest hamlets—and Iqaluit to transport workers to and from worksites.\n\nMary River Aerodrome\n\nIn 2013, Nolinor Aviation began a service to Mary River Aerodrome carrying passengers and cargo on every second day from Kitchener/Waterloo via Iqaluit using a Boeing 737-200 combi aircraft. The Mary River Aerodrome, having a medium-length gravel runway, was constructed adjacent to the base area. Flights are chartered by the mining company and operated by Chrono Aviation.\n\nRail\n\nBy 2007, the construction and operation of a \"large-tonnage railway year-round in Arctic conditions...built on permafrost\" was an ambitious part of the mining development plan. The South Railway was integral to the 2008 initial submission. However, by 2013 investment funds in mining had dried up as the price of iron ore had declined in 2012. Mary River project investors radically scaled back capital funds from CA$4 billion to CA$740 million, cancelling both the proposed South Railway and port development.\n\nSouth Railway\n\nBy 2007, the construction and operation of a \"large-tonnage railway year-round in Arctic conditions...built on permafrost\" was an ambitious part of the mining development plan.

Mary River project investors radically scaled back capital funds from CA$4 billion to CA$740 million, cancelling both the proposed South Railway and port development.\n\nNorth Railway\n\nIn February 2016, Baffinland requested permission for another major change in Phase 2. In Phase 2, 4.2 million tons per year of iron ore was to be trucked on tote road to Milne Inlet. In 2015, Baffinland requested permission to truck 12 million tons to Milne Inlet. Nunavut authorities informed Baffinland that a change of that scale would require an additional extensive environmental review. Six months later, Baffinland announced that they would build a northern railway line running adjacent to the tote road to transport the iron ore to Milne Inlet. Baffinland already had the license to ship 18 million tons of ore to Steensby Inlet on the South Railway.\n\nMary River - Milne Inlet Tote Road\n\nIn 2010, when Nunavut Iron Ore Acquisition Company and ArcelorMittal were engaged in the bidding war, an alternate proposal to the South Railway cold-weather railway was under consideration. By 2011, the projected cost of the South Railway had quadrupled from its 2006 estimate of CA$350 million. In this alternate proposal, ore would be hauled by truck. The advantage to this approach would smaller start-up costs, and a shorter period before ore was shipped to market. Disadvantages were higher operating costs, making the price of a ton of ore approximately double that under the rail proposal, and a smaller capacity of ore, 3,000,000 t (3,000,000 long tons; 3,300,000 short tons) per year, as opposed to the 20,000,000 t (20,000,000 long tons; 22,000,000 short tons) per year under the rail proposal. Waheed and Murray's Nunavut Iron Ore Acquisition Company suggested it would be cheaper to construct a tote road route from Mary River Mine to Milne Inlet, rather than the more expensive but more environmentally sensitive South Railway cold-weather railway. The tote road approach seemed to have been abandoned temporarily, when the Nunavut Iron and ArcelorMittal agreed to a partnership. In late 2014, after the South Railway had spent several years undergoing its environmental impact assessment, the railway plan was shelved.\n\nRevenues and Expenses\n\nBaffinland operates on investments, not revenues from iron production and sales, and according to a February 2021 report commissioned by Baffinland by Graeme Clinton for the NIRB assessment, the company has had a huge deficit since 2016. The investors who acquired the company in 2011, were attracted by the quality of the iron ore and the record high prices of iron ore. With the sharp decline in iron ore prices, investors are unwillingly to undertake capital-intensive projects such as the CA$5.7 billion South Railway.\n\nInuit Birthright Organizations\n\nWith the creation of Nunavut in 1999, new planning regions were identified and agencies were put into place. The Qikiqtaaluk Region, in northern Baffin Island, Nunavut, is part of the North Baffin Planning Region which is a triangular area in the Arctic Archipelago, that comprises approximately 1,500,000 km² (580,000 sq mi). The region is sparsely populated with most residents living in five hamlets—the largest hamlet, which is also closest to Mary River Mine and the most impacted by the project is Pond Inlet.

Railway had quadrupled from its 2006 estimate of  CA$350 million [27] In this alternate proposal ore would be hauled by truck The advantage to this approach would smaller start-up costs, and a shorter period before ore was shipped to market Disadvantages were higher operating costs, making the price of a ton of ore approximately double that under the rail proposal, and a smaller capacity of ore, 3,000,000 t (3,000,000 long tons; 3,300,000 short tons) per year, as opposed to the 20,000,000 t (20,000,000 long tons; 22,000,000 short tons) per year under the rail proposal Waheed and Murray's Nunavut Iron Ore Acquisition Company suggested it would be cheaper to construct a tote road route from Mary River Mine to Milne Inlet, rather than the more expensive but more environmentally sensitive South Railway cold-weather railway The tote road approach seemed to have been abandoned temporarily, when the Nunavut Iron and ArcelorMittal agreed to a partnership  In late 2014, after the South Railway had spent several years undergoing its environmental impact assessment, the railway plan was shelved [48] [49]\n\n\nRevenues and expenses\nBaffinland operates on investments, not revenues from iron production and sales, and according to a February 2021 report commissioned by Baffinland by Graeme Clinton for the NIRB assessment, the company has had a huge deficit since 2016 [83] [100] The investors who acquired the company in 2011, were attracted by the quality of the iron ore and the record high prices of iron ore With the sharp decline in iron ore prices, investors are unwillingly to undertake capital intense projects such as the CA$5.7 billion South Railway [83] [101] [16]\n\n\nInuit birthright organizations\nWith the creation of Nunavut in 1999, new planning regions were identified and agencies were put into place The Qikiqtaaluk Region, in northern Baffin Island,  Nunavut, is part of the North Baffin Planning Region which is a triangular area in the Arctic Archipelago, that comprises approximately 1,500,000 km2 (580,000 sq mi) The region is sparsely populated with most residents living in five hamlets—the largest hamlet, which is also closest to Mary River Mine and the most impacted by the project is Pond Inlet In June 2000, the North Baffin Regional Land Use Plan, which deals with deals with mineral exploration and production, among many other major area, was approved It provides strategic direction for land and resource use in the North Baffin Planning Region [102]\n\n\nMary River Inuit Impact and Benefit Agreement (IIBA)\nOn September 6, 2013, the QIA and Baffinland signed an agreement in which Baffinland \"promised to make advance royalty payments to QIA as part of the IIBA [106]\n\n\nOpposition\nThe CBC interviewed Inuit from the region in April 2008, about their concerns with the plans [110] Jaypetee Palluq, an Igloolik resident who had been asked to serve on a Baffinland advisory committee, was concerned that the mine's operation would interfere with the traditional hunts for sea mammals, like walrus He called on Baffinland to \"find an alternate shipping route to the mine, regardless of the cost.\" Paul Quassa, Mayor of Igloolik, also expressed concern, over the effect of freighters on the ice used by the walrus He said the region was known for its highly prized aged, fermented walrus meat, a valuable export from the region.\n\n\nOil leaks in 2008\nThe CBC interviewed Inuit from the region in April 2008, about their concerns with the plans [110] Jaypetee Palluq, an Igloolik resident who had been asked to serve on a Baffinland advisory committee, was concerned that the mine's operation would interfere with the traditional hunts for sea mammals, like walrus He called on Baffinland to \"find an alternate shipping route to the mine, regardless of the cost.\" Paul Quassa, Mayor of Igloolik, also expressed concern, over the effect of freighters on the ice used by the walrus He said the region was known for its highly prized aged, fermented walrus meat, a valuable export from the region.\n\n\nAir strip and tote road blockade (2021)\nFrom February 4 to February 11, 2021, a small group of Inuit hunters held a peaceful protest blocking Mary River mine's airstrip and the tote road [114] The protesters, who called themselves Nuluujaat Land Guardians stood in opposition to the expansion of the mine, concerned for the damage to the environment and their traditional ways of life [115] [116] About seven hundred employees were stuck at the mine work camp for a week [60] The protest ended with a proposal by the Mayor of Pond Inlet, that a meeting be convened in the near future between \"protesters, community leaders, Premier Joe Savikataaq and Inuit organizations that represent Inuit in the area\" [114] Protesters asked that the QIA, and other birthright agencies, \"commit to sharing more mine royalties with communities in the area\" [114] They said that they had not been given an opportunity to voice their concerns that the Phase 2 expansion \"will drive caribou away and harm other wildlife in the area, including narwhal\" at the hearings Inuit in the Qikiqtaaluk Region in general, and in Pond Inlet in particular, depend on these animals for subsistence [114] In Pond Inlet, 92% of the population is Inuit and the economy there is a mixed economy—including both traditional subsistence and wage-based activities [109] The local Inuit have the right to harvest in the nearby protected areas of the Tallurutiup Imanga National Marine Conservation Area, Bylot Island and Sirmilik National Park, for which Pond Inlet is the gateway hamlet.\n\n\nCOVID-19 outbreak\nOn May 2, 2021, Baffinland announced that COVID-19 was spreading in its work camp An outbreak was declared the following day The outbreak reportedly began with an employee testing positive on April 19 Within two months, the mine became the site of Canada's worst outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, a highly transmissible variant of the virus that causes COVID-19 As of June 12, 106 people had tested positive for COVID-19 in the mine, with 96 of them testing positive for the Delta variant The mine ceased operations on May 5, and over 1200 employees that were considered \"low risk\" began flying home, but many proved to be carrying the virus asymptomatically, and caused it to spread beyond the mine In Ontario, 127 confirmed or \"probable\" cases have been linked to the mine, 10 of them of the lineage of the Delta variant; around 120 cases were similarly linked in Alberta, 9 of them with the Delta variant While cases linked to employees of the mine were also reported in other provinces, since the mine's workforce had not been in contact with any local communities, Nunavut's health department reported no cases linked to the mine outbreak The mine re-opened in a reduced capacity on May 28, and has reportedly had no new cases since May 29, and no active cases at the site since June 5 In June 2021, the Canadian Red Cross began assisting the mine with contact tracing efforts [118] [119] [120]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The event was part of WWE's ongoing partnership with the Ministry of Sport (formerly General Sports Authority) in support of Saudi Vision 2030, a social and economic reform program. The event was scheduled to revive the King of the Ring event series, but with a rebranding to include a women's tournament, dubbed the Queen of the Ring.\n\n**Production**\nIn early 2018, WWE began a 10-year strategic multiplatform partnership with the Ministry of Sport (formerly General Sports Authority) in support of Saudi Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia's social and economic reform program. The partnership aimed to develop the professional wrestling industry in Saudi Arabia and bring international events to the country. In 2023, WWE scheduled an event for May titled King and Queen of the Ring at the Jeddah Super Dome in Jeddah, which would have revived the King of the Ring event series but with a rebranding. However, these plans were scrapped with the event replaced by Night of Champions.\n\n**Background**\nThe decision to replace King and Queen of the Ring with Night of Champions marked a significant shift in WWE's plans for Saudi Arabia. The original event was expected to feature a series of matches, including the King of the Ring tournament, which would have crowned a new champion. The event also included a women's tournament, dubbed the Queen of the Ring, which would have seen a new champion crowned. The cancellation of the event sparked speculation about the future of WWE's partnership with Saudi Arabia, as well as the potential for the event to be rescheduled or used for a future Saudi Arabian show.\n\n**Storylines**\nThe event comprised six matches, including one on the pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines. The storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, Monday Night Raw and Friday Night SmackDown. The matches were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, who aimed to create a narrative that would engage fans and lead to a compelling conclusion.\n\nThe King of the Ring tournament saw a series of matches, with the winner earning a spot in the main event. The Queen of the Ring tournament also saw a series of matches, with the winner earning a spot in the main event. The storylines built up to the event, with several matches featuring surprise twists and turns that added to the drama and tension.\n\n**Aftermath**\nAfter the show, WWE Chief Content Officer Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque noted the mistake in the King of the Ring final but said the referee's decision was final. He also said that there would likely be a rematch between Gunther and Randy Orton. Because of his win, Gunther received a match for Raw's World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam, where he defeated Damian Priest to win the title. During Gunther's speech on the following Raw, he was interrupted by Orton, who noted that because of that mistake in the King of the Ring final, that ultimately allowed Gunther to become champion. He then said that he wanted his rematch at Bash in Berlin so he could take the World Heavyweight Championship from Gunther, who accepted the challenge. It was also stipulated that if Orton won the championship, he would be transferred to Raw while Gunther would be transferred to SmackDown.\n\n**Results**\n\n**King of the Ring tournament**\n\n* First Round: Baron Corbin defeated Drew Gulak\n* First Round: Damian Priest defeated Sheamus\n* First Round: Gunther defeated Finn Bálor\n* First Round: Randy Orton defeated Riddle\n* Semifinals: Baron Corbin defeated Damian Priest\n* Semifinals: Gunther defeated Randy Orton\n* Final: Gunther defeated Baron Corbin\n\n**Queen of the Ring tournament**\n\n* First Round: Aliyah defeated Emily Brandow\n* First Round: Raquel Rodriguez defeated Doudrop\n* First Round: Shayna Baszler defeated Xia Li\n* First Round: Zelina Vega defeated Liv Morgan\n* Semifinals: Aliyah defeated Raquel Rodriguez\n* Semifinals: Shayna Baszler defeated Zelina Vega\n* Final: Aliyah defeated Shayna Baszler\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The event was initially scheduled to take place in May 2024, but was later rescheduled for a later date.\n* The event was expected to feature a series of matches, including the King of the Ring tournament and the Queen of the Ring tournament.\n* The event was to be held at the Jeddah Super Dome in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.\n* WWE's partnership with the Ministry of Sport (formerly General Sports Authority) aimed to develop the professional wrestling industry in Saudi Arabia and bring international events to the country.\n\n**References**\n\n* None\n\n**External links**\n\n* WWE Website\n* WWE Saudi Arabia Website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"King_and_Queen_of_the_Ring_(2024)\" following this outline:\n\n\nProduction\nIn early 2018, the American professional wrestling promotion WWE began a 10-year strategic multiplatform partnership with the Ministry of Sport (formerly General Sports Authority) in support of Saudi Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia's social and economic reform program [2] [3] In 2023, WWE had scheduled an event for May titled King and Queen of the Ring at the Jeddah Super Dome in Jeddah, which would have revived the King of the Ring event series but with a rebranding; however, these plans were scrapped with the event replaced by Night of Champions [4] Fightful later reported that WWE did not have plans to reschedule King and Queen of the Ring for later that year, but that the event could possibly be used for a future Saudi Arabian show [5]\n\n\nBackground\nIn early 2018, the American professional wrestling promotion WWE began a 10-year strategic multiplatform partnership with the Ministry of Sport (formerly General Sports Authority) in support of Saudi Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia's social and economic reform program [2] [3] In 2023, WWE had scheduled an event for May titled King and Queen of the Ring at the Jeddah Super Dome in Jeddah, which would have revived the King of the Ring event series but with a rebranding; however, these plans were scrapped with the event replaced by Night of Champions [4] Fightful later reported that WWE did not have plans to reschedule King and Queen of the Ring for later that year, but that the event could possibly be used for a future Saudi Arabian show [5]\n\n\nStorylines\nThe event comprised six matches, including one on the pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, [12] [13] while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, Monday Night Raw and Friday Night SmackDown [14]\n\n\nAftermath\nAfter the show, WWE Chief Content Officer Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque noted the mistake in the King of the Ring final but said the referee's decision was final He also said that there would likely be a rematch between Gunther and Randy Orton [28] Because of his win, Gunther received a match for Raw's World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam, where he defeated Damian Priest to win the title [29] During Gunther's speech on the following Raw, he was interrupted by Orton, who noted that because of that mistake in the King of the Ring final, that ultimately allowed Gunther to become champion He then said that he wanted his rematch at Bash in Berlin so he could take the World Heavyweight Championship from Gunther, who accepted the challenge It was also stipulated that if Orton won the championship, he would be transferred to Raw while Gunther would be transferred to SmackDown [30]\n\n\nResults\n\n\nKing of the Ring tournament\n\n\nQueen of the Ring tournament\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

strategy for hiding memory latencies) As shown in Flynn's 1972 paper the key distinguishing factor of SIMT-based GPUs is that it has a single instruction decoder-broadcaster but that the cores receiving and executing that same instruction are otherwise reasonably normal: their own ALUs, their own register files, their own Load/Store units and their own independent L1 data caches Thus although all cores simultaneously execute the exact same instruction in lock-step with each other they do so with completely different data from completely different memory locations This is significantly more complex and involved than \"Packed SIMD\", which is strictly limited to execution of parallel pipelined arithmetic operations only Although the exact internal details of today's commercial GPUs are proprietary secrets, the MIAOW [3] team was able to piece together anecdotal information sufficient to implement a subset of the AMDGPU architecture [4]\n\n\nRecent development\nSeveral modern CPU architectures are being designed as vector processors The RISC-V vector extension follows similar principles as the early vector processors, and is being implemented in commercial products such as the Andes Technology AX45MPV [5] There are also several open source vector processor architectures being developed, including ForwardCom and Libre-SOC.\n\n\nComparison with modern architectures\nAs of 2016 [update] most commodity CPUs implement architectures that feature fixed-length SIMD instructions On first inspection these can be considered a form of vector processing because they operate on multiple (vectorized, explicit length) data sets, and borrow features from vector processors However, by definition, the addition of SIMD cannot, by itself, qualify a processor as an actual vector processor, because SIMD is fixed-length, and vectors are variable-length The difference is illustrated below with examples, showing and comparing the three categories: Pure SIMD, Predicated SIMD, and Pure Vector Processing [citation needed]\n\n\nDifference between SIMD and vector processors\nSIMD instruction sets lack crucial features when compared to vector instruction sets The most important of these is that vector processors, inherently by definition and design, have always been variable-length since their inception.\n\n\nDescription\nIn general terms, CPUs are able to manipulate one or two pieces of data at a time For instance, most CPUs have an instruction that essentially says \"add A to B and put the result in C\" The data for A, B and C could be—in theory at least—encoded directly into the instruction However, in efficient implementation things are rarely that simple The data is rarely sent in raw form, and is instead \"pointed to\" by passing in an address to a memory location that holds the data Decoding this address and getting the data out of the memory takes some time, during which the CPU traditionally would sit idle waiting for the requested data to show up As CPU speeds have increased, this memory latency has historically become a large impediment to performance; see Random-access memory § Memory wall.\n\n\nVector instructions\nThe vector pseudocode example above comes with a big assumption that the vector computer can process more than ten numbers in one batch For a greater quantity of numbers in the vector register, it becomes unfeasible for the computer to have a register that large As a result, the vector processor either gains the ability to perform loops itself, or exposes some sort of vector control (status) register to the programmer, usually known as a vector Length.\n\n\nVector instruction example\nThis example starts with an algorithm (\"IAXPY\"), first show it in scalar instructions, then SIMD, then predicated SIMD, and finally vector instructions This incrementally helps illustrate the difference between a traditional vector processor and a modern SIMD one The example starts with a 32-bit integer variant of the \"DAXPY\" function, in C:\n\n\nScalar assembler\nThe scalar version of this would load each of x, add it to y, and loop:\n\n\nPure (non-predicated, packed) SIMD\nA modern packed SIMD architecture, known by many names (listed in Flynn's taxonomy), can do most of the operation in batches The code is mostly similar to the scalar version It is assumed that both x and y are properly aligned here (only start on a multiple of 16) and that n is a multiple of 4, as otherwise some setup code would be needed to calculate a mask or to run a scalar version It can also be assumed, for simplicity, that the SIMD instructions have an option to automatically repeat scalar operands, like ARM NEON can [18] If it does not, a \"splat\" (broadcast) must be used, to copy the scalar argument across a SIMD register:\n\n\nPredicated SIMD\nAssuming a hypothetical predicated (mask capable) SIMD ISA, and again assuming that the SIMD instructions can cope with misaligned data, the instruction loop would look like this:\n\n\nPure (true) vector ISA\nFor Cray-style vector ISAs such as RVV, an instruction called \"setvl\" (set vector length) is used The hardware first defines how many data values it can process in one \"vector\": this could be either actual registers or it could be an internal loop (the hybrid approach, mentioned above) This maximum amount (the number of hardware \"lanes\") is termed \"MVL\" (Maximum Vector Length) Note that, as seen in SX-Aurora and Videocore IV, MVL may be an actual hardware lane quantity or a virtual one (Note: As mentioned in the ARM SVE2 Tutorial, programmers must not make the mistake of assuming a fixed vector width: consequently MVL is not a quantity that the programmer needs to know This can be a little disconcerting after years of SIMD mindset) [tone]\n\n\nVector reduction example\nThis example starts with an algorithm which involves reduction Just as with the previous example, it will be first shown in scalar

on large arrays of data in a single instruction. This is in contrast to scalar processors, which perform operations on individual data elements one at a time. Vector processors are commonly used in high-performance computing applications, such as scientific simulations, data analytics, and machine learning.\n\n**History**\n\nThe concept of vector processing dates back to the early 1960s, when a team at the Westinghouse Electric Corporation began developing a machine called the Solomon. The Solomon was designed to dramatically increase math performance by using a large number of simple coprocessors under the control of a single master Central Processing Unit (CPU). The CPU fed a single common instruction to all of the arithmetic logic units (ALUs), one per cycle, but with a different data point for each one to work on. This allowed the Solomon machine to apply a single algorithm to a large data set, fed in the form of an array.\n\n**Early Research and Development**\n\nThe early research and development of vector processing was focused on creating a machine that could perform operations on large arrays of data in a single instruction. The Solomon machine was a significant step in this direction, but it was not the first vector processor. In the 1960s, a computer for operations with functions was presented and developed by Kartsev. This machine was designed to perform operations on large arrays of data, but it was not as efficient as the Solomon machine.\n\n**Supercomputers**\n\nThe first vector supercomputers were introduced in the 1970s. The Control Data Corporation STAR-100 and the Texas Instruments Advanced Scientific Computer (ASC) were two of the first vector supercomputers. These machines were designed to perform operations on large arrays of data at high speeds, and they were used in a variety of applications, including scientific simulations and data analytics.\n\n**GPU**\n\nModern graphics processing units (GPUs) include an array of shader pipelines that can be driven by compute kernels. These pipelines can be considered vector processors, as they perform operations on large arrays of data in a single instruction. The key distinguishing factor of SIMT-based GPUs is that they have a single instruction decoder-broadcaster, but the cores receiving and executing that same instruction are otherwise reasonably normal.

he began reading and copying bible verses, and he eventually converted to Christianity [47] [48] He described this approach in his last biography, Life and Times of Frederick Douglass:\n\n\nFamily life\nDouglass and Anna Murray had five children: Rosetta Douglass, Lewis Henry Douglass, Frederick Douglass Jr., Charles Remond Douglass, and Annie Douglass (died at the age of ten) Charles and Rosetta helped produce his newspapers.\n\n\nCareer\nThe couple settled in New Bedford, Massachusetts (an abolitionist center, full of former enslaved people), in 1838, moving to Lynn, Massachusetts, in 1841 [71] After meeting and staying with Nathan and Mary Johnson, they adopted Douglass as their married name [38] Douglass had grown up using his mother's surname of Bailey; after escaping slavery he had changed his surname first to Stanley and then to Johnson In New Bedford, the latter was such a common name that he wanted one that was more distinctive, and asked Nathan Johnson to choose a suitable surname Nathan suggested \"Douglass\", after having read the poem The Lady of the Lake by Walter Scott, in which two of the principal characters have the surname \"Douglas\" [72] [73]\n\n\nAbolitionist and preacher\nThe couple settled in New Bedford, Massachusetts (an abolitionist center, full of former enslaved people), in 1838, moving to Lynn, Massachusetts, in 1841 [71] After meeting and staying with Nathan and Mary Johnson, they adopted Douglass as their married name [38] Douglass had grown up using his mother's surname of Bailey;

the abolitionist movement\nAfter returning to the U.S in 1847, using £500 (equivalent to $57,716 in 2023) given to him by English supporters, [89] Douglass started publishing his first abolitionist newspaper, the North Star, from the basement of the Memorial AME Zion Church in Rochester, New York [100] Originally, Pittsburgh journalist Martin Delany was co-editor but Douglass didn't feel he brought in enough subscriptions, and they parted ways [101] [page needed] The North Star's motto was \"Right is of no Sex – Truth is of no Color – God is the Father of us all, and we are all brethren.\" [102] The AME Church and North Star joined in the freedmen community's vigorous opposition to the mostly white American Colonization Society and its proposal to send free black people to Africa Douglass also participated in the Underground Railroad He and his wife provided lodging and resources in their home to more than four hundred fugitive slaves [102]\n\n\nLetter to his former owner\nIn September 1848, on the tenth anniversary of his escape, Douglass published an open letter addressed to his former master, Thomas Auld, berating him for his conduct, and inquiring after members of his family still held by Auld [108] [109] In the course of the letter, Douglass adeptly transitions from formal and restrained to familiar and then to impassioned At one point he is the proud parent, describing his improved circumstances and the progress of his own four young children But then he dramatically shifts tone:\n\n\nWomen's rights\nIn 1848, Douglass was the only black person to attend the Seneca Falls Convention, the first women's rights convention, in upstate New York [110] [111] Elizabeth Cady Stanton asked the assembly to pass a resolution asking for women's suffrage [112] Many of those present opposed the idea, including influential Quakers James and Lucretia Mott [113] Douglass stood and spoke eloquently in favor of women's suffrage; he said that he could not accept the right to vote as a black man if women could also not claim that right He suggested that the world would be a better place if women were involved in the political sphere:\n\n\nIdeological refinement\nIn 1850, Douglass was elected the vice president of the American League of Colored Laborers, the first black labor union in the United States, which he had also helped found [119] Meanwhile, in 1851, he merged the North Star with Gerrit Smith's Liberty Party paper to form Frederick Douglass' Paper, [120] which was published until 1859 [121]\n\n\nJohn Brown\nOn March 12, 1859, Douglass met with radical abolitionists John Brown, George DeBaptiste, and others at William Webb's house in Detroit to discuss emancipation [124] Douglass met Brown again when Brown visited his home two months before leading the raid on Harpers Ferry Brown penned his Provisional Constitution during his two-week stay with Douglass Also staying with Douglass for over a year was Shields Green, a fugitive slave whom Douglass was helping, as he often did.\n\n\nPhotography\nDouglass considered photography very important in ending slavery and racism, and believed that the camera would not lie, even in the hands of a racist white person, as photographs were an excellent counter to many racist caricatures, particularly in blackface minstrelsy He was the most photographed American of the 19th century, consciously using photography to advance his political views [134] [135] He never smiled, specifically so as not to play into the racist caricature of a happy enslaved person He tended to look directly into the camera and confront the viewer with a stern look [136] [137]\n\n\nCivil War years\nBy the time of the Civil War, Douglass was one of the most famous black men in the country, known for his orations on the condition of the black race and on other issues such as women's rights His eloquence gathered crowds at every location His reception by leaders in England and Ireland added to his stature.\n\n\nBefore the Civil War\nBy the time of the Civil War, Douglass was one of the most famous black men in the country, known for his orations on the condition of the black race and on other issues such as women's rights His eloquence gathered crowds at every location His reception by leaders in England and Ireland added to his stature.\n\n\nFight for emancipation and suffrage\nDouglass and the abolitionists argued that because the aim of the Civil War was to end slavery, African Americans should be allowed to engage in the fight for their freedom Douglass publicized this view in his newspapers and several speeches After Lincoln had finally allowed black soldiers to serve in the Union army, Douglass helped the recruitment efforts, publishing his famous broadside Men of Color to Arms! on March 21, 1863 [143] His eldest son, Charles Douglass, joined the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, but was ill for much of his service [75] Lewis Douglass fought at the Battle of Fort Wagner [144] Another son, Frederick Douglass Jr., also served as a recruiter.\n\n\nAfter Lincoln's death\nThe postwar ratification of the 13th Amendment, on December 6, 1865, outlawed slavery, \"except as a punishment for crime.\" The 14th Amendment provided for birthright citizenship and prohibited the states from abridging the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States or denying any \"person\" due process of law or equal protection of the laws The 15th Amendment protected all citizens from being discriminated against in voting because of race [116] After Lincoln had been assassinated, Douglass conferred with President Andrew Johnson on the subject of black suffrage [148]\n\n\nReconstruction era\nAfter the Civil War, Douglass continued to work for equality for African Americans and women Due to his prominence and activism during the war, Douglass received several political appointments He served as president of the Reconstruction-era Freedman's Savings Bank [152]\n\n\nFrederick Douglass House\nIn 1877 Frederick Douglass bought a house that included a big yard, as well as a studio where he did most of his work;

Born into slavery in 1818, Douglass became a leading figure in the fight against slavery and racism in the United States. Through his powerful writings and speeches, he advocated for the immediate and complete emancipation of all slaves and equal rights for African Americans. Douglass's life and legacy continue to inspire and influence social justice movements to this day.\n\n**Early Life and Slavery**\n\nFrederick Augustus Washington Bailey was born into slavery on the Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay in Talbot County, Maryland. His birthplace was likely his grandmother's cabin, east of Tappers Corner and west of Tuckahoe Creek. Douglass stated in his first autobiography that he had no accurate knowledge of his age, but successive autobiographies provided more precise estimates, with his final estimate being 1817. However, historian Dickson J Preston determined that Douglass was born in February 1818. Douglass's mother, Harriet Bailey, was enslaved, and his father, who may have been her master, was apparently of European descent.\n\n**Birth Family**\n\nDouglass's family was enslaved, and his early life was marked by poverty and hardship. His grandparents, who lived in a nearby cabin, were separated from him at a young age, and he was sent to live with his grandmother's cousin, Isaac Bailey, on a plantation near Hillsboro. In 1826, Douglass was given to Lucretia Auld, wife of Thomas Auld, who sent him to serve Thomas's brother Hugh Auld and his wife Sophia Auld in Baltimore. Sophia treated Douglass kindly and helped him learn to read and write.\n\n**Early Learning and Experience**\n\nAt the age of 6, Douglass was separated from his grandparents and moved to the Wye House plantation, where Aaron Anthony worked as overseer. After Anthony died in 1826, Douglass was given to Lucretia Auld, who sent him to serve Thomas's brother Hugh Auld and his wife Sophia Auld in Baltimore. Douglass described Sophia as a kind and tender-hearted woman who treated him \"as she supposed one human being ought to treat another.\" He felt lucky to be in the city, where he said enslaved people were almost freemen, compared to those on plantations.\n\n**The Auld Family**\n\nDouglass's experiences with the Auld family were complex and multifaceted. On one hand, Sophia Auld treated him with kindness and helped him learn to read and write. On the other hand, Thomas Auld, who owned Douglass, was cruel and abusive. In 1833, Thomas Auld took Douglass back from Hugh Auld and sent him to work for Edward Covey, a poor farmer who had a reputation as a \"slave-breaker.\"\n\n**William Freeland**\n\nWhen Douglass was hired out to William Freeland, he \"gathered eventually more than thirty male slaves on Sundays, and sometimes even on weeknights, in a Sabbath literacy school.\" This experience helped Douglass learn to read and write more effectively and laid the groundwork for his future education and activism.\n\n**Edward Covey**\n\nIn 1833, Thomas Auld took Douglass back from Hugh Auld and sent him to work for Edward Covey, a poor farmer who had a reputation as a \"slave-breaker.\" Covey whipped Douglass frequently, breaking his body, soul, and spirit. However, the 16-year-old Douglass finally rebelled against the beatings and fought back. He won a physical confrontation with Covey, who never tried to beat him again.\n\n**Escape from Slavery**\n\nDouglass first tried to escape from Freeland, who had hired him from his owner, but was unsuccessful. In 1837, Douglass met and fell in love with Anna Murray, a free black woman in Baltimore. Her free status strengthened his belief in the possibility of gaining his own freedom. Murray encouraged him and supported his efforts by aid and money.\n\n**Religious Views**\n\nAs a child, Douglass was exposed to a number of religious sermons, and in his youth, he sometimes heard Sophia Auld reading the Bible. In time, he became interested in literacy and began reading and copying Bible verses. He eventually converted to Christianity, which played an important role in his life and activism.\n\n**Family Life**\n\nDouglass and Anna Murray had five children: Rosetta Douglass, Lewis Henry Douglass, Frederick Douglass Jr., Charles Remond Douglass, and Annie Douglass (who died at the age of ten). Charles and Rosetta helped produce his newspapers.\n\n**Career**\n\nThe couple settled in New Bedford, Massachusetts, in 1838, moving to Lynn, Massachusetts, in 1841. After meeting and staying with Nathan and Mary Johnson, they adopted Douglass as their married name. Douglass had grown up using his mother's surname of Bailey; after escaping slavery, he had changed his surname first to Stanley and then to Johnson. In New Bedford, the latter was such a common name that he wanted one that was more distinctive, and asked Nathan Johnson to choose a suitable surname.\n\n**Abolitionist and Preacher**\n\nThe couple settled in New Bedford, Massachusetts, in 1838, moving to Lynn, Massachusetts, in 1841. Douglass had grown up using his mother's surname of Bailey; after escaping slavery, he had changed his surname first to Stanley and then to Johnson. In New Bedford, the latter was such a common name that he wanted one that was more distinctive, and asked Nathan Johnson to choose a suitable surname.\n\n**Autobiography**\n\nDouglass's best-known work is his first autobiography, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave, written during his time in Lynn, Massachusetts, and published in 1845. At the time, some skeptics questioned whether a black man could have produced such an eloquent piece of literature. The book received generally positive reviews and became an immediate bestseller, with 11,000 copies circulating in the United States.\n\n**Travels to Ireland and Great Britain**\n\nDouglass's friends and mentors feared that the publicity would draw the attention of his ex-owner, Hugh Auld, who might try to get his \"property\" back. They encouraged Douglass to tour Ireland, as many former slaves had done. Douglass set sail on the Cambria for Liverpool, England, on August 16, 1845. He traveled in Ireland as the Great Famine was beginning.\n\n**Return to the United States; the Abolitionist Movement**\n\nAfter returning to the U.S. in 1847, Douglass started publishing his first abolitionist newspaper, the North Star, from the basement of the Memorial AME Zion Church in Rochester, New York. The North Star's motto was \"Right is of no Sex – Truth is of no Color – God is the Father of us all, and we are all brethren.\" Douglass and his wife provided lodging and resources in their home to more than four hundred fugitive slaves.\n\n**Letter to his former owner**\n\nIn September 1848, on the tenth anniversary of his escape, Douglass published an open letter addressed to his former master, Thomas Auld, berating him for his conduct, and inquiring after members of his family still held by Auld. Douglass adeptly transitions from formal and restrained to familiar and then to impassioned, describing his improved circumstances and the progress of his own four young children.\n\n**Women's Rights**\n\nIn 1848, Douglass was the only black person to attend the Seneca Falls Convention, the first women's rights convention, in upstate New York. Elizabeth Cady Stanton asked the assembly to pass a resolution asking for women's suffrage, but many present opposed the idea, including influential Quakers James and Lucretia Mott. Douglass stood and spoke eloquently in favor of women's suffrage, suggesting that the world would be a better place if women were involved in the political sphere.\n\n**Ideological Refinement**\n\nIn 1850, Douglass was elected the vice president of the American League of Colored Laborers, the first black labor union in the United States, which he had also helped found. Meanwhile, in 1851, he merged the North Star with Gerrit Smith's Liberty Party paper to form Frederick Douglass' Paper, which was published until 1859.\n\n**John Brown**\n\nOn March 12, 1859, Douglass met with radical abolitionists John Brown, George DeBaptiste, and others at William Webb's house in Detroit to discuss emancipation. Douglass met Brown again when Brown visited his home two months before leading the raid on Harpers Ferry. Brown penned his Provisional Constitution during his two-week stay with Douglass.\n\n**Photography**\n\nDouglass considered photography very important in ending slavery and racism, and believed that the camera would not lie, even in the hands of a racist white person, as photographs were an excellent counter to many racist caricatures, particularly in blackface minstrelsy. He was the most photographed American of the 19th century, consciously using photography to advance his political views. Douglass never smiled, specifically so as not to play into the racist caricature of a happy enslaved person. He tended to look directly into the camera and confront the viewer with a stern look.\n\n**Civil War Years**\n\nBy the time of the Civil War, Douglass was one of the most famous black men in the country, known for his orations on the condition of the black race and on other issues such as women's rights. His eloquence gathered crowds at every location. His reception by leaders in England and Ireland added to his stature.\n\n**Fight for Emancipation and Suffrage**\n\nDouglass and the abolitionists argued that because the aim of the Civil War was to end slavery, African Americans should be allowed to engage in the fight for their freedom. Douglass publicized this view in his newspapers and several speeches. After Lincoln had finally allowed black soldiers to serve in the Union army, Douglass helped the recruitment efforts, publishing his famous broadside Men of Color to Arms! on March 21, 1863.\n\n**After Lincoln's Death**\n\nThe postwar ratification of the 13th Amendment, on December 6, 1865, outlawed slavery, \"except as a punishment for crime.\" The 14th Amendment provided for birthright citizenship and prohibited the states from abridging the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States or denying any \"person\" due process of law or equal protection of the laws. The 15th Amendment protected all citizens from being discriminated against in voting because of race. After Lincoln had been assassinated, Douglass conferred with President Andrew Johnson on the subject of black suffrage.\n\n**Reconstruction Era**\n\nAfter the Civil War, Douglass continued to work for equality for African Americans and women. Due to his prominence and activism during the war, Douglass received several political appointments. He served as president of the Reconstruction-era Freedman's Savings Bank.\n\n**Frederick Douglass House**\n\nIn 1877, Frederick Douglass bought a house that included a big yard, as well as a studio where he did most of his work. He lived in this house from 1878 until his death in 1895, and it was named the Frederick Douglass National Historic Site.\n\n**Final Years in Washington, D.C.**\n\nThe Freedman's Savings Bank went bankrupt on June 29, 1874, just a few months after Douglass became its president in late March. During that same economic crisis, his final newspaper, The New National Era, failed in September. When Republican Rutherford B Hayes was elected president, he named Douglass United States Marshal for the District of Columbia, making him the first person of color to be so named. Douglass accepted the appointment, which helped assure his family's financial security.\n\n**Death**\n\nOn February 20, 1895, Douglass attended a meeting of the National Council of Women in Washington, D.C. During that meeting, he was brought to the platform and received a standing ovation. Shortly after he returned home, Douglass died of a heart attack. He was 77.\n\n**Legacy and Honors**\n\nDouglass's legacy as a prominent American abolitionist, orator, writer, and statesman continues to inspire and influence social justice movements to this day. His contributions to the fight against slavery and racism, as well as his advocacy for women's rights and civil rights, have left a lasting impact on American history.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Frederick_Douglass\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and slavery\nFrederick Augustus Washington Bailey was born into slavery on the Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay in Talbot County, Maryland The plantation was between Hillsboro and Cordova;

after escaping slavery he had changed his surname first to Stanley and then to Johnson In New Bedford, the latter was such a common name that he wanted one that was more distinctive, and asked Nathan Johnson to choose a suitable surname Nathan suggested \"Douglass\", after having read the poem The Lady of the Lake by Walter Scott, in which two of the principal characters have the surname \"Douglas\" [72] [73]\n\n\nAbolitionist and preacher\nThe couple settled in New Bedford, Massachusetts (an abolitionist center, full of former enslaved people), in 1838, moving to Lynn, Massachusetts, in 1841 [71] After meeting and staying with Nathan and Mary Johnson, they adopted Douglass as their married name [38] Douglass had grown up using his mother's surname of Bailey; after escaping slavery he had changed his surname first to Stanley and then to Johnson In New Bedford, the latter was such a common name that he wanted one that was more distinctive, and asked Nathan Johnson to choose a suitable surname Nathan suggested \"Douglass\", after having read the poem The Lady of the Lake by Walter Scott, in which two of the principal characters have the surname \"Douglas\" [72] [73]\n\n\nAutobiography\nDouglass's best-known work is his first autobiography, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave, written during his time in Lynn, Massachusetts [82] and published in 1845 At the time, some skeptics questioned whether a black man could have produced such an eloquent piece of literature The book received generally positive reviews and became an immediate bestseller Within three years, it had been reprinted nine times, with 11,000 copies circulating in the United States It was also translated into French and Dutch and published in Europe.\n\n\nTravels to Ireland and Great Britain\nDouglass's friends and mentors feared that the publicity would draw the attention of his ex-owner, Hugh Auld, who might try to get his \"property\" back They encouraged Douglass to tour Ireland, as many former slaves had done Douglass set sail on the Cambria for Liverpool, England, on August 16, 1845 He traveled in Ireland as the Great Famine was beginning.\n\n\nReturn to the United States; the abolitionist movement\nAfter returning to the U.S in 1847, using £500 (equivalent to $57,716 in 2023) given to him by English supporters, [89] Douglass started publishing his first abolitionist newspaper, the North Star, from the basement of the Memorial AME Zion Church in Rochester, New York [100] Originally, Pittsburgh journalist Martin Delany was co-editor but Douglass didn't feel he brought in enough subscriptions, and they parted ways [101] [page needed] The North Star's motto was \"Right is of no Sex – Truth is of no Color – God is the Father of us all, and we are all brethren.\" [102] The AME Church and North Star joined in the freedmen community's vigorous opposition to the mostly white American Colonization Society and its proposal to send free black people to Africa Douglass also participated in the Underground Railroad He and his wife provided lodging and resources in their home to more than four hundred fugitive slaves [102]\n\n\nLetter to his former owner\nIn September 1848, on the tenth anniversary of his escape, Douglass published an open letter addressed to his former master, Thomas Auld, berating him for his conduct, and inquiring after members of his family still held by Auld [108] [109] In the course of the letter, Douglass adeptly transitions from formal and restrained to familiar and then to impassioned At one point he is the proud parent, describing his improved circumstances and the progress of his own four young children But then he dramatically shifts tone:\n\n\nWomen's rights\nIn 1848, Douglass was the only black person to attend the Seneca Falls Convention, the first women's rights convention, in upstate New York [110] [111] Elizabeth Cady Stanton asked the assembly to pass a resolution asking for women's suffrage [112] Many of those present opposed the idea, including influential Quakers James and Lucretia Mott [113] Douglass stood and spoke eloquently in favor of women's suffrage; he said that he could not accept the right to vote as a black man if women could also not claim that right He suggested that the world would be a better place if women were involved in the political sphere:\n\n\nIdeological refinement\nIn 1850, Douglass was elected the vice president of the American League of Colored Laborers, the first black labor union in the United States, which he had also helped found [119] Meanwhile, in 1851, he merged the North Star with Gerrit Smith's Liberty Party paper to form Frederick Douglass' Paper, [120] which was published until 1859 [121]\n\n\nJohn Brown\nOn March 12, 1859, Douglass met with radical abolitionists John Brown, George DeBaptiste, and others at William Webb's house in Detroit to discuss emancipation [124] Douglass met Brown again when Brown visited his home two months before leading the raid on Harpers Ferry Brown penned his Provisional Constitution during his two-week stay with Douglass Also staying with Douglass for over a year was Shields Green, a fugitive slave whom Douglass was helping, as he often did.\n\n\nPhotography\nDouglass considered photography very important in ending slavery and racism, and believed that the camera would not lie, even in the hands of a racist white person, as photographs were an excellent counter to many racist caricatures, particularly in blackface minstrelsy He was the most photographed American of the 19th century, consciously using photography to advance his political views [134] [135] He never smiled, specifically so as not to play into the racist caricature of a happy enslaved person He tended to look directly into the camera and confront the viewer with a stern look [136] [137]\n\n\nCivil War years\nBy the time of the Civil War, Douglass was one of the most famous black men in the country, known for his orations on the condition of the black race and on other issues such as women's rights His eloquence gathered crowds at every location His reception by leaders in England and Ireland added to his stature.\n\n\nBefore the Civil War\nBy the time of the Civil War, Douglass was one of the most famous black men in the country, known for his orations on the condition of the black race and on other issues such as women's rights His eloquence gathered crowds at every location His reception by leaders in England and Ireland added to his stature.\n\n\nFight for emancipation and suffrage\nDouglass and the abolitionists argued that because the aim of the Civil War was to end slavery, African Americans should be allowed to engage in the fight for their freedom Douglass publicized this view in his newspapers and several speeches After Lincoln had finally allowed black soldiers to serve in the Union army, Douglass helped the recruitment efforts, publishing his famous broadside Men of Color to Arms! on March 21, 1863 [143] His eldest son, Charles Douglass, joined the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, but was ill for much of his service [75] Lewis Douglass fought at the Battle of Fort Wagner [144] Another son, Frederick Douglass Jr., also served as a recruiter.\n\n\nAfter Lincoln's death\nThe postwar ratification of the 13th Amendment, on December 6, 1865, outlawed slavery, \"except as a punishment for crime.\" The 14th Amendment provided for birthright citizenship and prohibited the states from abridging the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States or denying any \"person\" due process of law or equal protection of the laws The 15th Amendment protected all citizens from being discriminated against in voting because of race [116] After Lincoln had been assassinated, Douglass conferred with President Andrew Johnson on the subject of black suffrage [148]\n\n\nReconstruction era\nAfter the Civil War, Douglass continued to work for equality for African Americans and women Due to his prominence and activism during the war, Douglass received several political appointments He served as president of the Reconstruction-era Freedman's Savings Bank [152]\n\n\nFrederick Douglass House\nIn 1877 Frederick Douglass bought a house that included a big yard, as well as a studio where he did most of his work; he lived in this house from 1878 until his death in 1895, and it was named the Frederick Douglass National Historic Site.\n\n\nFinal years in Washington, D.C.\nThe Freedman's Savings Bank went bankrupt on June 29, 1874, just a few months after Douglass became its president in late March [160] During that same economic crisis, his final newspaper, The New National Era, failed in September [161] When Republican Rutherford B Hayes was elected president, he named Douglass United States Marshal for the District of Columbia, making him the first person of color to be so named The United States Senate voted to confirm him on March 17, 1877 [162] Douglass accepted the appointment, which helped assure his family's financial security [75] During his tenure, Douglass was urged by his supporters to resign from his commission, since he was never asked to introduce visiting foreign dignitaries to the President, which is one of the usual duties of that post However, Douglass believed that no covert racism was implied by the omission and stated that he was always warmly welcomed in presidential circles [163] [164]\n\n\nDeath\nOn February 20, 1895, Douglass attended a meeting of the National Council of Women in Washington, D.C During that meeting, he was brought to the platform and received a standing ovation Shortly after he returned home, Douglass died of a heart attack [175] He was 77.\n\n\nWorks\nBiographer David Blight states that Douglass \"played a pivotal role in America's Second Founding out of the apocalypse of the Civil War, and he very much wished to see himself as a founder and a defender of the Second American Republic.\" [186]\n\n\nWritings\nBiographer David Blight states that Douglass \"played a pivotal role in America's Second Founding out of the apocalypse of the Civil War, and he very much wished to see himself as a founder and a defender of the Second American Republic.\" [186]\n\n\nSpeeches\nBiographer David Blight states that Douglass \"played a pivotal role in America's Second Founding out of the apocalypse of the Civil War, and he very much wished to see himself as a founder and a defender of the Second American Republic.\" [186]\n\n\nPoetry\nBiographer David Blight states that Douglass \"played a pivotal role in America's Second Founding out of the apocalypse of the Civil War, and he very much wished to see himself as a founder and a defender of the Second American Republic.\" [186]\n\n\nLegacy and honors\nBiographer David Blight states that Douglass \"played a pivotal role in America's Second Founding out of the apocalypse of the Civil War, and he very much wished to see himself as a founder and a defender of the Second American Republic.\" [186]\n\n\nIn popular culture\n\n\nFilm and television\n\n\nLiterature\n\n\nPainting\n\n\nOther media\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nPrimary sources\n\n\nNewspaper and magazine articles\n\n\nScholarship\n\n\nSymposium\n\n\nFor young readers\n\n\nDocumentary films and videos\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

In his message, Wilson said, \"To us in America the reflections of Armistice Day will be filled with solemn pride in the heroism of those who died in the country's service and with gratitude for the victory, both because of the thing from which it has freed us and because of the opportunity it has given America to show her sympathy with peace and justice in the councils of the nations.\"\n\n## Early Observance\n\nThe first Armistice Day was observed on November 11, 1919, with parades, speeches, and other festivities. However, the holiday gained more significance over time, and in 1938, Congress passed a law making Armistice Day a national holiday. The law was amended in 1954 to change the name to Veterans Day to honor all military personnel who had served in the United States Armed Forces.\n\n## Observance\n\nBecause it is a federal holiday, some American workers and many students have Veterans Day off from work or school. When Veterans Day falls on a Saturday, then either Saturday or the preceding Friday may be designated as the holiday. When it falls on a Sunday, it is typically observed on the following Monday. When it falls on the weekend, many private companies offer it as a floating holiday, where employees can choose some other day to observe the holiday.\n\n## Armistice Day\n\nIn his Armistice Day address to Congress, Wilson was sensitive to the psychological toll of the lean War years. He remarked, \"Hunger does not breed reform; it breeds madness.\" As Veterans Day and the birthday of the United States Marine Corps (November 10, 1775) are only one day apart, that branch of the Armed Forces customarily observes both occasions as a 96-hour liberty period.\n\n## Spelling of Veterans Day\n\nWhile the holiday is commonly printed as Veteran's Day or Veterans' Day in calendars and advertisements, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs website states that the attributive (no apostrophe) rather than the possessive case is the official spelling. This is because it is not a day that \"belongs\" to veterans, it is a day for honoring all veterans.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* List of federal holidays in the United States\n* List of state holidays in the United States\n* List of cultural holidays in the United States\n* List of observances and ceremonies in the United States\n\n**Explanatory Notes**\n\n* Federal holidays are recognized by the federal government and are typically observed by all federal agencies.\n* State holidays are recognized by individual states and may be observed by state agencies and private organizations.\n* Religious holidays are observed by individuals or groups based on their religious beliefs.\n* Cultural holidays are observed by individuals or groups based on their cultural or ethnic background.\n* Week-long holidays are observed over a period of several days, often including weekends.\n* Month-long holidays are observed throughout a month, often with specific dates or events.\n* Title 36 Observances and Ceremonies is a federal law that establishes guidelines for national observances and ceremonies.\n\n**External Links**\n\n* United States Department of Veterans Affairs website\n* National Archives and Records Administration website\n* Library of Congress website\n* Smithsonian Institution website\n* National Park Service website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Veterans_Day\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nOn November 11, 1919, President Woodrow Wilson issued a message to his countrymen on the first Armistice Day, in which he expressed what he felt the day meant to Americans:\n\n\nObservance\nBecause it is a federal holiday, some American workers and many students have Veterans Day off from work or school When Veterans Day falls on a Saturday then either Saturday or the preceding Friday may be designated as the holiday, whereas if it falls on a Sunday it is typically observed on the following Monday When it falls on the weekend many private companies offer it as a floating holiday where employees can choose some other day [citation needed] A Society for Human Resource Management poll in 2010 found that 21 percent of employers planned to observe the holiday in 2011 [13]\n\n\nArmistice Day\nIn his Armistice Day address to Congress, Wilson was sensitive to the psychological toll of the lean War years: \"Hunger does not breed reform; it breeds madness,\" he remarked [16] As Veterans Day and the birthday of the United States Marine Corps (November 10, 1775) are only one day apart, that branch of the Armed Forces customarily observes both occasions as a 96-hour liberty period [citation needed]\n\n\nSpelling of Veterans Day\nWhile the holiday is commonly printed as Veteran's Day or Veterans' Day in calendars and advertisements, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs website states that the attributive (no apostrophe) rather than the possessive case is the official spelling \"because it is not a day that 'belongs' to veterans, it is a day for honoring all veterans.\" [3]\n\n\nSee also\n(federal) = federal holidays, (abbreviation) = state/territorial holidays, (religious) = religious holidays, (cultural) = holiday related to a specific racial/ethnic group or sexual minority, (week) = week-long holidays, (month) = month-long holidays, (36) = Title 36 Observances and Ceremonies\n\n\nExplanatory notes\n(federal) = federal holidays, (abbreviation) = state/territorial holidays, (religious) = religious holidays, (cultural) = holiday related to a specific racial/ethnic group or sexual minority, (week) = week-long holidays, (month) = month-long holidays, (36) = Title 36 Observances and Ceremonies\n\n\nReferences\n(federal) = federal holidays, (abbreviation) = state/territorial holidays, (religious) = religious holidays, (cultural) = holiday related to a specific racial/ethnic group or sexual minority, (week) = week-long holidays, (month) = month-long holidays, (36) = Title 36 Observances and Ceremonies\n\n\nExternal links\n(federal) = federal holidays, (abbreviation) = state/territorial holidays, (religious) = religious holidays, (cultural) = holiday related to a specific racial/ethnic group or sexual minority, (week) = week-long holidays, (month) = month-long holidays, (36) = Title 36 Observances and Ceremonies\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

"Rafael Caro Quintero\n\nRafael Caro Quintero is a Mexican former drug trafficker and leader of the Guadalajara Cartel. He was born on October 24, 1952, in the community of La Noria, Badiraguato, Sinaloa. Caro Quintero's early life and rise to power are deeply intertwined with the history of the Mexican drug trade.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nRafael Caro Quintero was born in the community of La Noria, Badiraguato, Sinaloa, on October 24, 1952. His parents, Emilio Caro Payán and Hermelinda Quintero, had twelve children; he was the oldest son. Caro Quintero's father worked in agriculture and grazing, and died when Caro Quintero was 14 years old. With his father's absence, he worked alongside his mother to take care of his family.\n\n**Criminal Career**\n\nWhen he was a teenager, Caro Quintero allegedly began to grow marijuana on a small scale, at the ranch owned by his brother Jorge Luis. In less than five years, Caro Quintero managed to buy several other ranches in the surrounding areas and began to amass larger amounts of money and influence. He soon became a key player in the Guadalajara Cartel, one of the most powerful and infamous drug cartels in Mexico.\n\n**Allegations of Involvement in Murders**\n\nCaro Quintero has been accused of ordering the abduction, torture, and murder of writer John Clay Walker and dentistry student Albert Radelat on January 30, 1985. According to the allegations, the two U.S citizens were dining in a Guadalajara restaurant when they encountered Caro Quintero and his men as they accidentally walked into one of Caro Quintero's private parties.\n\n**Enrique \"Kiki\" Camarena**\n\nCaro Quintero has also been accused of involvement in the murder of US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent Enrique \"Kiki\" Camarena Salazar. In November 1984, the Mexican authorities raided a 1,000-hectare (2,500-acre) ranch known as El Búfalo in the state of Chihuahua, owned by Caro Quintero. The authorities reportedly burned more than 10,000 tons of marijuana – totaling a loss of around $160 million. Camarena, who had been working undercover in Mexico, was said to be responsible for leading the authorities to the ranch. This allegedly prompted Caro Quintero and other high-ranking members of the Guadalajara Cartel to seek revenge against the DEA and Camarena.\n\n**Philanthropy**\n\nLocals from Badiraguato, Sinaloa, Caro Quintero's hometown, recall that Caro Quintero was a benefactor in the area in the 1980s.

this makes him suspicious of Macbeth All but Macduff attend Macbeth's coronation.\n\n\nAct III\nDespite his success, Macbeth, also aware of this part of the prophecy, remains uneasy Macbeth invites Banquo to a royal banquet, where he discovers that Banquo and his young son, Fleance, will be riding out that night Fearing Banquo's suspicions, Macbeth arranges to have him murdered, by hiring two men to kill them, later sending a third murderer, presumably to ensure that the deed is completed The murderers succeed in killing Banquo, but Fleance escapes the ambush Macbeth becomes furious: he fears that his power remains insecure as long as an heir of Banquo remains alive.\n\n\nAct IV\nMacbeth, disturbed, visits the three witches once more and asks them to reveal the truth of their prophecies to him To answer his questions, they summon horrible apparitions, each of which offers predictions and further prophecies to put Macbeth's fears at rest First, they conjure an armoured head, which tells him to beware of Macduff (IV.i.72) Second, a bloody child tells him that no one born of a woman will be able to harm him Thirdly, a crowned child holding a tree states that Macbeth will be safe until Great Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane Hill Macbeth is relieved and feels secure because he knows that all men are born of women and forests cannot possibly move.\n\n\nAct V\nLady Macbeth becomes racked with guilt from the crimes she and her husband have committed At night, in the king's palace at Dunsinane, a doctor and a gentlewoman discuss Lady Macbeth's strange habit of sleepwalking Suddenly, Lady Macbeth enters in a trance with a candle in her hand Bemoaning the murders of Duncan, Lady Macduff, and Banquo, she tries to wash off imaginary bloodstains from her hands, all the while speaking of the terrible things she knows she pressed her husband to do She leaves, and the doctor and gentlewoman marvel at her descent into madness.\n\n\nSources for the play\nA principal source comes from the Daemonologie of King James published in 1597 which included a news pamphlet titled Newes from Scotland that detailed the famous North Berwick witch trials of 1590 [6] The publication of Daemonologie came just a few years before the tragedy of Macbeth with the themes and setting in a direct and comparative contrast with King James' personal obsessions with witchcraft, which developed following his conclusion that the stormy weather that threatened his passage from Denmark to Scotland was a targeted attack Not only did the subsequent trials take place in Scotland, the women accused were recorded, under torture, of having conducted rituals with the same mannerisms as the three witches One of the evidenced passages is referenced when the women under trial confessed to attempt the use of witchcraft to raise a tempest and sabotage the boat King James and his queen were on board during their return trip from Denmark The three witches discuss the raising of winds at sea in the opening lines of Act 1 Scene 3 [7]\n\n\nDate and text\nMacbeth cannot be dated precisely, but it is usually taken to be contemporaneous to the other canonical tragedies: Hamlet, Othello, and King Lear [19] While some scholars have placed the original writing of the play as early as 1599, [3] most believe that the play is unlikely to have been composed earlier than 1603 as the play is widely seen to celebrate King James' ancestors and the Stuart accession to the throne in 1603 (James believed himself to be descended from Banquo), [20] suggesting that the parade of eight kings—which the witches show Macbeth in a vision in Act IV—is a compliment to King James Many scholars think the play was written in 1606 in the aftermath of the Gunpowder Plot, citing possible internal allusions to the 1605 plot and its ensuing trials [21] In fact, there are a great number of allusions and possible pieces of evidence alluding to the Plot, and, for this reason, a great many critics agree that Macbeth was written in the year 1606 [22] [23] [24] Lady Macbeth's instructions to her husband, \"Look like the innocent flower, but be the serpent under't\" (1.5.74–75), may be an allusion to a medal that was struck in 1605 to commemorate King James' escape that depicted a serpent hiding among lilies and roses [25]\n\n\nThemes and motifs\n\"MacbethThe Prince of Cumberland!

situations where evil is depicted as good, while good is rendered evil The line \"Double, double toil and trouble,\" communicates the witches' intent clearly: they seek only trouble for the mortals

The play is based on the story of a Scottish nobleman, Macbeth, who rises to the throne after killing the current king, Duncan. The play explores themes of ambition, power, and the consequences of one's actions. It is considered one of Shakespeare's greatest works and is widely studied and performed today.\n\n**Characters**\n\nThe main characters in Macbeth include:\n\n* **Macbeth**: The protagonist of the play, a Scottish nobleman who becomes king after killing Duncan.\n* **Lady Macbeth**: Macbeth's wife, who encourages him to commit the murder and later descends into madness.\n* **King Duncan**: The current king of Scotland, who is murdered by Macbeth.\n* **Banquo**: A Scottish nobleman and friend of Macbeth, who is also murdered by Macbeth.\n* **Macduff**: A Scottish nobleman who opposes Macbeth and becomes the leader of the rebellion against him.\n* **The Three Witches**: Three supernatural beings who appear at the beginning of the play and predict Macbeth's rise to power.\n\n**Plot**\n\n**Act I**\n\nThe play begins with the Three Witches, who foretell the future of Macbeth and Banquo. Macbeth and Banquo meet on the battlefield, where they have just defeated the army of Norway. Macbeth and Banquo are hailed as heroes, and Macbeth is given the title of Thane of Cawdor. Meanwhile, King Duncan is preparing to return to Scotland, and his son Malcolm is worried about the safety of the kingdom.\n\n**Act II**\n\nWhen Macbeth and Lady Macbeth are left alone, she encourages him to commit the murder of King Duncan. Macbeth is hesitant at first, but eventually gives in to his ambition and kills the king. Lady Macbeth frames the servants for the murder, and the king's body is discovered the next morning. Macbeth becomes king, and his reign is marked by violence and paranoia.\n\n**Act III**\n\nMacbeth invites Banquo to a royal banquet, where he is murdered by Macbeth's servants. Banquo's ghost appears to Macbeth, and Macbeth becomes even more paranoid and violent. Meanwhile, the rebellion against Macbeth is growing, led by Macduff and Malcolm.\n\n**Act IV**\n\nMacbeth visits the Three Witches again, who foretell the future of the rebellion. They tell him that he will be safe until Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane Hill. Macbeth becomes confident that he will defeat the rebels and maintain his power. Meanwhile, Lady Macbeth is suffering from guilt and paranoia, and her mental state is deteriorating.\n\n**Act V**\n\nThe final act of the play sees the rebellion against Macbeth finally succeed. Macduff leads the attack on Dunsinane Hill, and Macbeth is killed. Lady Macbeth dies soon after, and the play ends with the coronation of Malcolm as the new king of Scotland.\n\n**Sources for the Play**\n\nThe play is based on the story of Macbeth, a Scottish nobleman who killed King Duncan in the 11th century. The story was first recorded by the historian Holinshed, and was later adapted by Shakespeare. The play also draws on the themes and motifs of the time, including the use of witchcraft and the supernatural.\n\n**Date and Text**\n\nThe exact date of the play's composition is unknown, but it is believed to have been written in the early 17th century.

The witches are a symbol of the supernatural and the unknown, and are used to explore the themes of power and morality.\n\n**Performance History**\n\nThe play has been widely performed and studied since its premiere in the early 17th century.

executive father [5] He has a brother named Shon and a sister named Kari [6] His first musical instrument was a trumpet, which he received as a Christmas gift at age 11 [7] He originally planned to become a firefighter, and participated in the San Diego Cadet Program [8] He first picked up the guitar from a friend at church camp, and became preoccupied by the instrument [9] He received his first guitar as a Christmas present from two friends in the sixth grade, which he described as a \"beat-up, shitty acoustic guitar that was worth about $30\" [10]\n\n\nMusic career\nDeLonge formed his first successful band, Blink-182, in 1992 He was removed from Poway High School in the second half of his junior year for going to a basketball game while inebriated He was forced to attend a different school for one semester, nearby Rancho Bernardo High School, where he became friends with Kerry Key, and his girlfriend, Anne Hoppus [15] Rancho Bernardo organized Battle of the Bands competitions, and DeLonge signed up, performing an original song titled \"Who's Gonna Shave Your Back Tonight?\" to a packed auditorium [16] Drummer Scott Raynor was at the competition with his own group, which soon dissolved, after which he was introduced by friend Paul Scott to DeLonge at a party The two began to organize jam sessions at Raynor's home, shifting through various bassists [17] [18] The following summer, his desire to be in a legitimate band increased significantly – Anne Hoppus characterized Delonge's passion as \"incessant whining and complaining\" Her brother, bassist, Mark Hoppus, was new to San Diego and she introduced the two one night that August [15] The two would jam for hours in DeLonge's garage, exchanging lyrics and writing new songs [citation

lyrics and writing new songs [citation needed]\n\n\n2002: Box Car Racer\nDuring time off from touring from Blink-182 in 2002, DeLonge felt an \"itch to do something where he didn't feel locked in to what Blink was\", [47] [48] and channeled his chronic back pain (a herniated disc) and resulting frustration into Box Car Racer (2002), a post-hardcore album that further explores his Fugazi and Refused inspiration [49] [50] Refraining from paying for a studio drummer, he invited Barker to record drums on the project and Hoppus felt betrayed [51] The event caused great division within the trio for some time and an unresolved tension at the forefront of the band's later hiatus [46]\n\n\n2005–2008: Angels & Airwaves\nIn the wake of Blink-182's break-up, DeLonge underwent a complete reassessment of his prime concerns—a move \"bearing the hallmarks of a nervous breakdown\"—and went on a three-week \"spiritual journey\" in complete isolation away from his family, contemplating his life, career, and future in music [46] [43] DeLonge felt psychologically hurt by the band's dissolution, likening it to a divorce and calling it a \"traumatic experience\" and a \"disaster\" [52] He had been known for his role in the Blink-182 as \"the low-brow prankster\" and wanted to restart his career without worrying whether fans would find him funny [53]\n\n\n2008–2015: Blink-182 reunion and further Angels & Airwaves releases\nDeLonge would reunite with Blink-182 near the end of 2008 At this time, Barker had recently survived a private plane crash, in which four others were killed [59] DeLonge's realization of Barker's near death incident was the catalyst for DeLonge desire to be included in the band's reformation [60] DeLonge found out via the TV news at an airport while waiting to board a flight; within minutes, he was crying in his seat \"I thought he was going to die\", says DeLonge, who quickly reached out to his former bandmate, mailing him a letter and photograph \"Instantly after the plane crash, I was like, 'Hey, I want to play music with him again'\" [61] [62] DeLonge was the first to approach the subject of reuniting, [60] and Blink-182 announced their reunion, a new album, and a reunion tour in February 2009 at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards [63] Blink-182 embarked on a reunion tour of North America from July to October 2009, supported by Weezer and Fall Out Boy [64] The tour was successful, selling out amphitheaters nationwide: \"I was completely blown away and dumbfounded by how big that reunion tour was  [...] We were very fortunate, very blessed\", DeLonge later said \"And truthfully, that's why we continued, because we were so blown away We were like, \"Wow, we got to suck this up and start acting like adults because this is beautiful'\" [65]\n\n\n2015–2021: Solo album and continued Angels & Airwaves involvement\nIn March 2015, DeLonge shed some light on what his other projects entailed, claiming that he was working with \"best selling authors\" to co-write 15 novels with accompanying soundtrack EPs He also expected to release four albums in 2015—two Angels & Airwaves albums and two solo albums—three of which would include a companion novel [78] [79]\n\n\n2022–present: Return to Blink-182\nOn October 11, 2022, Blink-182 confirmed DeLonge's official return to the group after an eight-year hiatus, and announced that there would be an album with him in the near future [86] This announcement was followed three days later by the release of the single \"Edging\" [87] The resulting album One More Time.. was released on October 20, 2023.\n\n\nMusical style\nDeLonge's distinctive nasal singing style and accent has been widely observed, celebrated, and mocked [88] Julia Gray, a writer for Vulture, termed it \"the Tom DeLonge Twang,  [which] contorted words like things (\"theeeengs\") and my head (\"myy'eaad\") into a cartoonish California diction.\" [89] DeLonge's singing style on \"I Miss You\"–particularly his verse lyrics \"Where are you / and I'm so sorry\", or pronunciation of the word head [90]—has been widely referenced throughout popular culture, and is considered a meme [91] [92] [93] DeLonge stated he developed the style in an attempt to sound like Milo Aukerman of the Descendents [94] \"It’s really hard to make  [singing] sound good when you’re not even doing it right to begin with, you know?\" he joked in 2019 [95]\n\n\nVocal style\nDeLonge's distinctive nasal singing style and accent has been widely observed, celebrated, and mocked [88] Julia Gray, a writer

1994, he acquired a white 40th Anniversary Edition Fender Stratocaster, which has come to be known by fans as the \"Sticker Strat\" It featured a DiMarzio X2N (and later a Seymour Duncan Invader) pickup in the bridge position on an angle, a Seymour Duncan JB Jr in the middle, and a Seymour Duncan Hot Rails pickup in the neck position He used this guitar on all of the touring in support of Cheshire Cat, as well as the recording and touring of Dude Ranch in 1997 before retiring it that fall He still owns the guitar today [99] During the touring of Dude Ranch in 1998, he began to use Gibson Les Pauls with a Seymour Duncan Invader at the bridge He used the Les Pauls on select tracks of Enema of the State before retiring them in 1999.\n\n\nGuitars\nIn the early years of Blink-182,

nuke: you plug it in and it fills up every piece of the sonic spectrum,\" he said [54] As his sound gradually grew cleaner, he grew away from the Mesa/Boogies DeLonge employed the Marshall JCM900 amps for his work on Dude Ranch, in which he improved his guitar tone [54] In a September 1999 Guitar Player article, DeLonge outlined his intentions: \"I'm the kind of guitarist that wants the biggest, fattest, loudest, sound he can get.\" [100]\n\n\nInspirations\nDeLonge grew to prominence playing pop punk music Southern California had a large punk population in the early 1990s, aided by an avid surfing, skating, and snowboarding scene In contrast to East Coast punk music, the West Coast wave of groups, Blink included, typically introduced more melodic aspects to their music [107] \"New York is gloomy, dark, and cold It makes different music The Californian middle-class suburbs have nothing to be that bummed about,\" said DeLonge [107]\n\n\nInfluence\nPanic! at the Disco's Brendon Urie and Ryan Ross both cited DeLonge as one of their major influences Urie said that DeLonge influenced his singing, remarking that \"He has a voice that no-one else has  [...] He's one of my bigger influences He always writes amazing melodies and songs.\" [110] Ross said: \"I wanted to learn how to play  [the guitar] like Tom DeLonge.\" [61]\n\n\nNon-musical endeavors\nDeLonge was unsure if the band's status in the music industry would grow or last, and he expanded into business beginning in 1998 He started a holding group, Really Likable People (RLP), with a US$20,000 investment Following this, he co-founded Loserkids.com, a website specializing in youth-branded apparel [8]\n\n\nBusiness\nDeLonge was unsure if the band's status in the music industry would grow or last, and he expanded

Foundation allowing fans to bid on a package including the book [116]\n\n\nConspiracy theories and aliens\nDeLonge has been a believer in aliens, UFOs, and conspiracy theories since his youth, well before founding Blink-182 [123] Band member Travis Barker said in a 2019 interview with Joe Rogan that DeLonge is incredibly passionate about them and would look for UFOs outside the tour bus window and even create search parties to find Bigfoot [124]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1996, DeLonge began dating Jennifer Jenkins, whom he had known since high school [131] They were married in Coronado, California, on May 26, 2001 [132] The band Jimmy Eat World performed at the reception and DeLonge gave each groomsman, including Mark Hoppus, silver yo-yos from Tiffany's [132] The couple had a

"**Tom DeLonge**\n\nTom DeLonge is an American musician, songwriter, and record producer, best known as the co-founder of the rock band Blink-182. He has also been involved in various side projects, including the bands Angels & Airwaves and Box Car Racer.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nThomas Matthew DeLonge was born on December 13, 1975, in Poway, California. His father was an oil company executive, and his mother was a mortgage broker. DeLonge has a brother named Shon and a sister named Kari. He first played the trumpet at the age of 11, and later picked up the guitar from a friend at church camp. DeLonge's first guitar was a \"beat-up, shitty acoustic guitar\" that he received as a Christmas present from two friends in the sixth grade.\n\n**Music Career**\n\nDeLonge formed his first successful band, Blink-182, in 1992. The band gained a local following in San Diego and eventually signed with MCA Records. Blink-182's early sound was characterized by DeLonge's distinctive nasal singing style and the band's pop-punk sound. The band's debut album, \"Cheshire Cat,\" was released in 1995 and was a commercial success. DeLonge's guitar playing and songwriting skills were a key factor in the band's success, and he quickly became known as one of the leading figures in the pop-punk movement.\n\n**Blink-182 (1992-2005)**\n\nDeLonge was removed from Poway High School in the second half of his junior year for going to a basketball game while inebriated.

Rancho Bernardo organized Battle of the Bands competitions, and DeLonge signed up, performing an original song titled \"Who's Gonna Shave Your Back Tonight?\" to a packed auditorium.

co-write 15 novels with accompanying soundtrack EPs He also expected to release four albums in 2015—two Angels & Airwaves albums and two solo albums—three of which would include a companion novel [78] [79]\n\n\n2022–present: Return to Blink-182\nOn October 11, 2022, Blink-182 confirmed DeLonge's official return to the group after an eight-year hiatus, and announced that there would be an album with him in the near future [86] This announcement was followed three days later by the release of the single \"Edging\" [87] The resulting album One More Time.. was released on October 20, 2023.\n\n\nMusical style\nDeLonge's distinctive nasal singing style and accent has been widely observed, celebrated, and mocked [88] Julia Gray, a writer for Vulture, termed it \"the Tom DeLonge Twang,  [which] contorted words like things (\"theeeengs\") and my head (\"myy'eaad\") into a cartoonish California diction.\" [89] DeLonge's singing style on \"I Miss You\"–particularly his verse lyrics \"Where are you / and I'm so sorry\", or pronunciation of the word head [90]—has been widely referenced throughout popular culture, and is considered a meme [91] [92] [93] DeLonge stated he developed the style in an attempt to sound like Milo Aukerman of the Descendents [94] \"It’s really hard to make  [singing] sound good when you’re not even doing it right to begin with, you know?\" he joked in 2019 [95]\n\n\nVocal style\nDeLonge's distinctive nasal singing style and accent has been widely observed, celebrated, and mocked [88] Julia Gray, a writer for Vulture, termed it \"the Tom

Anniversary Edition Fender Stratocaster, which has come to be known by fans as the \"Sticker Strat\" It featured a DiMarzio X2N (and later a Seymour Duncan Invader) pickup in the bridge position on an angle, a Seymour Duncan JB Jr in the middle, and a Seymour Duncan Hot Rails pickup in the neck position He used this guitar on all of the touring in support of Cheshire Cat, as well as the recording and touring of Dude Ranch in 1997 before retiring it that fall He still owns the guitar today [99] During the touring of Dude Ranch in 1998, he began to use Gibson Les Pauls with a Seymour Duncan Invader at the bridge He used the Les Pauls on select tracks of Enema of the State before retiring them in 1999.\n\n\nGuitars\nIn the early years of Blink-182, DeLonge used a Squier Stratocaster on

1999.\n\n\nAmps and pedals\nThe Mesa/Boogie Triple Rectifier was key to DeLonge's early sound; he employed them to create a distorted sound \"A Mesa/Boogie is like a nuke: you plug it in and it fills up every piece of the sonic spectrum,\" he said [54] As his sound gradually grew cleaner, he grew away from the Mesa/Boogies DeLonge employed the Marshall JCM900 amps for his work on Dude Ranch, in which he improved his guitar tone [54] In a September 1999 Guitar Player article, DeLonge outlined his intentions: \"I'm the kind of guitarist that wants the biggest, fattest, loudest, sound he can get.\" [100]\n\n\nInspirations\nDeLonge grew to prominence playing pop punk music Southern California had a large punk population in the early 1990s, aided by an avid surfing, skating, and snowboarding scene In contrast to East Coast punk music, the West Coast wave of groups, Blink included, typically introduced more melodic aspects to their music [107] \"New York is gloomy, dark, and cold It makes different music The Californian middle-class suburbs have nothing to be that bummed about,\" said DeLonge [107]\n\n\nInfluence\nPanic! at the Disco's Brendon Urie and Ryan Ross both cited DeLonge as one of their major influences Urie said that DeLonge influenced his singing, remarking that \"He has a voice that no-one else has  [...] He's one of my bigger influences He always writes amazing melodies and songs.\" [110] Ross said: \"I wanted to learn how to play  [the guitar] like Tom DeLonge.\" [61]\n\n\nNon-musical endeavors\nDeLonge was unsure if the band's status in the music industry would grow or last, and he expanded into business beginning in 1998 He started a holding group, Really Likable People (RLP), with a US$20,000 investment Following this, he co-founded Loserkids.com, a website specializing in youth-branded apparel [8]\n\n\nBusiness\nDeLonge was unsure if the band's status in the music industry would grow or last, and he expanded into business

[8]\n\n\nFilm\nDeLonge approached filmmaking when he directed the music video for the song \"This Photograph is Proof (I Know You Know)\" by Taking Back Sunday in 2004 He was fascinated by the medium, calling the process \"so artistically satisfying\", and he has since worked in film on Angels & Airwaves-related projects [112] In 2014, he co-directed the animated short film Poet Anderson: The Dream Walker.\n\n\nWriting\nIn December 2013, DeLonge released a children's book, The Lonely Astronaut on Christmas Eve [115] The plot of the book is described by Alternative Press as a \"rocketeer spending a cold Christmas alone on the moon who is visited by extraterrestrial life\" [116] DeLonge participated in a charity auction benefiting Rady Children's Hospital Foundation allowing fans to bid on a package including the book [116]\n\n\nConspiracy theories and aliens\nDeLonge has been a believer in aliens, UFOs, and conspiracy theories since his youth, well before founding Blink-182 [123] Band member Travis Barker said in a 2019 interview with Joe Rogan that DeLonge is incredibly passionate about them and would look for UFOs outside the tour bus window and even create search parties to find Bigfoot [124]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1996, DeLonge began dating Jennifer Jenkins, whom he had known since high school [131] They were married in Coronado, California, on May 26, 2001 [132] The band Jimmy Eat World performed at the reception and DeLonge gave each groomsman, including Mark Hoppus, silver yo-yos from Tiffany's [132] The couple had a daughter and a son, [citation needed] before divorcing in 2019 [133]\n\n\nDiscography\n\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

the Christ is the four canonical Gospel narratives of Christ's passion The film includes a trial of Jesus at Herod's court, which is only found in the Gospel of Luke The film also draws from other parts of the New Testament One line spoken by Jesus in the film, \"I make all things new\", is found in the Book of Revelation, Chapter 21, verse 5 [14]\n\n\nBiblical canon\nAccording to Mel Gibson,

central to the depiction of the Via Dolorosa in The Passion of the Christ All the stations are portrayed except for the eighth station (Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem, a deleted scene on the DVD) and the fourteenth station (Jesus is laid in the tomb) Gibson was inspired by the representation of Jesus on the Shroud of Turin [17]\n\n\nProduction\nMel Gibson originally announced that he would use two old languages without subtitles and rely on \"filmic storytelling\" Because the story of the Passion is so well known, Gibson felt the need to avoid vernacular languages in order to surprise audiences: \"I think it's almost counterproductive to say some of these things in a modern language It makes you want to stand up and shout out the next line, like when you hear 'To be or not to be' and you instinctively say to yourself, 'That is the question.'\" [22] The script was written in English by Gibson and Benedict Fitzgerald, then translated by William Fulco, S.J., a professor at Loyola Marymount University, into Latin and reconstructed Aramaic Fulco sometimes incorporated deliberate errors in pronunciations and word endings when the characters were speaking a language unfamiliar to them, and some of the crude language used by the Roman soldiers was not translated in the subtitles [23]\n\n\nScript and language\nMel Gibson originally announced that he would use two old languages

crude language used by the Roman soldiers was not translated in the subtitles [23]\n\n\nFilming\nThe film was produced independently and shot in Italy at Cinecittà Studios in Rome, and on location in the city of Matera and the ghost town of Craco, both in the Basilicata region The estimated US$30 million production cost, plus an additional estimated $15 million in marketing costs, were fully borne by Gibson and his company Icon Productions According to the DVD special feature, Martin Scorsese had recently finished his film Gangs of New York, from which Gibson and his production designers constructed part of their set This saved Gibson a lot of time and money.\n\n\nMusic\nThree albums were released with Mel Gibson's co-operation: (1) the soundtrack of John Debney's original orchestral score conducted by Nick Ingman; (2) The Passion of the Christ: Songs, by producers Mark Joseph and Tim Cook, with original compositions by various artists, and (3) Songs Inspired by The Passion of the Christ The first two albums each received a 2005 Dove award, and the soundtrack received an Academy Award nomination of Best Original Music Score The music score frequently makes use of the wailing woman technique [29]\n\n\nTitle change\nAlthough Mel Gibson wanted to call his film The Passion, on October 16, 2003, his spokesman announced that the title used in the United States would be The Passion of Christ because Miramax Films had already registered the title The Passion with the MPAA for the 1987 novel by Jeanette Winterson [32] Later, the title was changed again to The Passion of the Christ for all markets.\n\n\nDistribution and marketing\nGibson began production on his film without securing outside funding or distribution In 2002, he explained why he could not get backing from the Hollywood studios: \"This is a film about something that nobody wants to touch, shot in two dead languages.\" [33] Gibson and his company Icon Productions provided the film's sole backing, spending about $30 million on production costs and an estimated $15 million on marketing [34] After early accusations of antisemitism, it became difficult for Gibson to find an American distribution company 20th Century Fox initially had a first-look deal with Icon but decided to pass on the film in response to public protests [35] In order to avoid the spectacle of other studios turning down the film and to avoid subjecting the distributor to the same intense public criticism he had received, Gibson decided to distribute the film in the United States himself, with the aid of independent distributor Newmarket Films [36] Gibson handled the distribution and marketing on his own, whilst Newmarket assisted with shipping prints of the film and collecting the revenue from theaters.\n\n\nEvangelical support\nThe Passion of the Christ received enthusiastic support from the American evangelical community [41] Before the film's release, Gibson actively reached out to evangelical leaders seeking their support and feedback [42] With their help, Gibson organized and attended a series of pre-release screenings for evangelical audiences and discussed the making of the film and his personal faith In June 2003 he screened the film for 800 pastors attending a leadership conference at New Life Church, pastored by Ted Haggard, then president of the National Association of Evangelicals [43] Gibson gave similar showings at Joel Osteen's Lakewood Church, Greg Laurie's Harvest Christian Fellowship, and to 3,600 pastors at a conference at Rick Warren's Saddleback Church in Lake Forest [44]\n\n\nRelease\nThe Passion of the Christ opened in the United States on February 25, 2004 (Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent) It earned $83.8 million  from 4,793 screens at 3,043 theaters in its opening weekend and a total of $125.2 million since its Wednesday opening, ranking it fourth overall in domestic opening weekend earnings for 2004 as well as the biggest weekend debut for a February release (until Fifty Shades of Grey was released) The film tied with The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King's record for having the highest five-day Wednesday opening Moreover, The Passion of the Christ scored the second biggest opening weekend for any R-rated movie, behind The Matrix Reloaded [47] It went on to earn $370.8 million overall in the United States, [2] and remained the highest grossing R-rated film in the domestic market (U.S & Canada) for 20 years, before the record went to Deadpool & Wolverine in 2024 with a domestic gross of $395.6 million [12] [48]

deleted, in hopes of attracting more viewers and make the film approachable to consumers who found the original cut too gruesome President of Newmarket Films Bob Berney stated, \"I knew a lot of people that wanted to see it but couldn't go...They were just too nervous or squeamish\" [65] Gibson explained his reasoning for this re-edited version: \n\nDifferences\nDuring the scourging scene, the cat o' nine tails striking Jesus's flesh that resulted in blood squirting and his flesh being dislodged was omitted In the crucifixion scene, the Roman soldiers nailing Jesus with blood spurting is cut, and the soldier strenuously dislocating Jesus's shoulder is trimmed; instead, the reaction shots of Mary and Jesus are shown Incidentally, the scene in which the cross is flipped over and supernaturally suspended in air was also deleted, due to viewers not understanding what they saw [66]\n\n\nHome media\nOn August 31, 2004, the film was released on VHS and DVD in North America by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, which initially passed on theatrical distribution As with the original theatrical release, the film's release on home video formats proved to be very popular Early estimates indicated that over 2.4 million copies of the film were sold by 3:00 p.m., [72] with a total of 4.1 million copies on its first day of sale [73] The film was available on DVD with English and Spanish subtitles and on VHS tape with English subtitles The film was released on Blu-ray in North America as a two-disc Definitive Edition set on February 17, 2009 [74] It was also released on Blu-ray in Australia a week before Easter.\n\n\nTelevision broadcast\nOn April 17, 2011 (Palm Sunday), Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN) presented the film at 7:30 p.m ET/PT, in the United States with multiple showings scheduled The network has continued to air the film throughout the year, and particularly around Easter [77]\n\n\nReception\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, The Passion of the Christ holds

to the historical accounts of first-century Judea and biblical accounts of Christ's crucifixion, some scholars defend the film as not being primarily concerned with historical accuracy Biblical scholar Mark Goodacre protested that he could not find one documented example of Gibson explicitly claiming the film to be historically accurate [93] [94] Gibson has been quoted as saying: \"I think that my first duty is to be as faithful as possible in telling the story so that it doesn't contradict the Scriptures Now, so long as it didn't do that, I felt that I had a pretty wide berth for artistic interpretation, and to fill in some of the spaces with logic, with imagination, with various other readings.\" [95] One such example is a scene in which Judas Iscariot is shown being

[98] of the film to Archbishop Stanisław Dziwisz, the pope's secretary [99] Pope John Paul II watched the film in his private apartment with Archbishop Dziwisz that night, and later met with McEveety [100] and Jan Michelini, an Italian and the movie's assistant director [101] [102] On December 17, Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan reported John Paul II had said \"It is as it was\", citing McEveety, who said he heard it from Dziwisz [103] [104] Noonan had emailed Joaquín Navarro-Valls, the head of the Vatican's press office, for confirmation before writing her column, surprised that the \"famously close-mouthed\" Navarro-Valls had approved the use of the \"It is as it was\" quote, and his emailed response stated he had no other comment at that time [105] National Catholic Reporter journalist John L Allen Jr published a similar account on the same day, quoting an unnamed senior Vatican official [100] Reuters [105] and the Associated Press independently confirmed the story, citing Vatican sources [106]\n\n\nAllegations of antisemitism\nBefore the film was released, there were prominent criticisms of perceived antisemitic content in the film It was for that reason that 20th Century Fox decided to pass on the film, informing New York Assemblyman Dov Hikind that a protest outside the News Corporation Building made them decide against distributing the film Hikind warned other companies that \"they should not distribute this film This is unhealthy for Jews all over the world.\" [35]\n\n\nReactions to allegations of antisemitism\nFilm critic Roger Ebert, who awarded The Passion of the Christ four out of four stars in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, denied allegations that the film was anti-semitic Ebert described the film as \"a powerful and important film, helmed by a man with a sincere heart and a warrior's sense of justice It is a story filled with searing images and ultimately a message of redemption and hope.\" Ebert said, \"It also might just be the greatest cinematic version of the greatest story ever told.\" [123]\n\n\nCriticism of excessive violence\nA.O Scott in The New York Times wrote \"The Passion of the Christ is so relentlessly focused on the savagery of Jesus' final hours that this film seems to arise less from love than from wrath, and to succeed more in assaulting the spirit than in uplifting it.\" [128] David Edelstein, Slate's film critic, dubbed the film \"a two-hour-and-six-minute snuff movie—The Jesus Chainsaw Massacre—that thinks it's an act of faith\", and further criticized Gibson for focusing on the brutality of Jesus' execution, instead of his religious teachings [84]\n\n\nPlanned sequel\nIn June 2016, writer Randall Wallace stated that he and Gibson had begun work on a sequel to The Passion of the Christ which will focus on the resurrection of Jesus, and the events surrounding the resurrection [130] In 2018, Caviezel said that Gibson had sent him the third draft of the screenplay [131] [132] In 2020, Caviezel said that it would be titled The Passion of the Christ: Resurrection and predicted, \"It's going to be the biggest film in world history.\" [133]\n\n\nSee

the eighth station (Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem, a deleted scene on the DVD) and the fourteenth station (Jesus is laid in the tomb) Gibson was inspired by the representation of Jesus on the Shroud of Turin [17]\n\n\nProduction\nMel Gibson originally announced that he would use two old languages without subtitles and rely on \"filmic storytelling\" Because the story of the Passion is so well known, Gibson felt the need to avoid vernacular languages in order to surprise audiences: \"I think it's almost counterproductive to say some of these things in a modern language It makes you want to stand up and shout out the next line, like when you hear 'To be or not to be' and you instinctively say to yourself, 'That is the question.'\" [22] The script was written in English by Gibson and Benedict Fitzgerald, then translated by William Fulco, S.J., a professor at Loyola Marymount University, into Latin and reconstructed Aramaic Fulco sometimes incorporated deliberate errors in

earnings for 2004 as well as the biggest weekend debut for a February release (until Fifty Shades of Grey was released) The film tied with The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King's record for having the highest five-day Wednesday opening Moreover, The Passion of the Christ scored the second biggest opening weekend for any R-rated movie, behind The Matrix Reloaded [47] It went on to earn $370.8 million overall in the United States, [2] and remained the highest grossing R-rated film in the domestic market (U.S & Canada) for 20 years, before the record went to Deadpool & Wolverine in 2024 with a domestic gross of $395.6 million [12] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] The film sold an estimated 59.6 million tickets in the US in its initial theatrical run [53]\n\n\nThe Passion Recut\nThe Passion Recut, a re-edited version, was released in theaters on March 11, 2005, with five minutes of the most explicit violence deleted, in hopes of attracting more viewers and make the film approachable to consumers who found the original cut too gruesome President of Newmarket Films Bob Berney stated, \"I knew a lot of people that wanted to see it but couldn't go...They were just too nervous or squeamish\" [65] Gibson explained his reasoning for this re-edited version: \n\nDifferences\nDuring the scourging scene, the cat o' nine tails striking Jesus's flesh that resulted in blood squirting and his flesh being dislodged was omitted In the crucifixion scene, the Roman soldiers nailing Jesus with blood spurting is cut, and the soldier strenuously dislocating Jesus's shoulder is trimmed; instead, the reaction shots of Mary and Jesus are shown Incidentally, the scene in which the cross is flipped over and supernaturally suspended in air was also deleted, due to viewers not understanding what they saw [66]\n\n\nHome media\nOn August 31, 2004, the film was released on VHS and DVD in North America by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, which initially passed on theatrical distribution As with the original theatrical release, the film's release on home video formats proved to be very popular Early estimates indicated that over 2.4 million copies of the film were sold by 3:00 p.m., [72] with a total of 4.1 million copies on its first day of sale [73] The film was available on DVD with English and Spanish subtitles and on VHS tape with English subtitles The film was released on Blu-ray in North America as a two-disc Definitive Edition set on February 17, 2009 [74] It was also released on Blu-ray in Australia a week before Easter.\n\n\nTelevision broadcast\nOn April 17, 2011 (Palm Sunday), Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN) presented the film at 7:30 p.m ET/PT, in the United States with multiple showings scheduled The network has continued to air the film throughout the year, and particularly around Easter [77]\n\n\nReception\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, The Passion of the Christ holds an approval rating of 50% based on 276 critic reviews and an 80% rating based on more than 250,000 user reviews The website's critical consensus reads: \"Director Mel Gibson's zeal is unmistakable, but The Passion of the Christ will leave many viewers emotionally drained rather than spiritually uplifted.\" [78] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average of 47 out of 100, based on 44 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\" [79] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade, however [80]\n\n\nCritical response\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, The Passion of the Christ holds an approval rating of 50% based on 276 critic reviews and an 80%

accounts of Christ's crucifixion, some scholars defend the film as not being primarily concerned with historical accuracy Biblical scholar Mark Goodacre protested that he could not find one documented example of Gibson explicitly claiming the film to be historically accurate [93] [94] Gibson has been quoted as saying: \"I think that my first duty is to be as faithful as possible in telling the story so that it doesn't contradict the Scriptures Now, so long as it didn't do that, I felt that I had a pretty wide berth for artistic interpretation, and to fill in some of the spaces with logic, with imagination, with various other readings.\" [95] One such example is a scene in which Judas Iscariot is shown being tormented by demons in the form of children Another scene shows Satan carrying a demonic baby during Christ's flogging, construed as a perversion of traditional depictions of the Madonna and Child, and also as a representation of Satan and the Antichrist Gibson's

Another scene shows Satan carrying a demonic baby during Christ's flogging, construed as a perversion of traditional depictions of the Madonna and Child, and also as a representation of Satan and the Antichrist Gibson's description:\n\n\nDisputed papal endorsement\nOn December 5, 2003, Passion of the Christ co-producer Stephen McEveety gave a rough cut [98] of the film to Archbishop Stanisław Dziwisz, the pope's secretary [99] Pope John Paul II watched the film in his private apartment with Archbishop Dziwisz that night, and later met with McEveety [100] and Jan Michelini, an Italian and the movie's assistant director [101] [102] On December 17, Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan reported John Paul II had said \"It is as it was\", citing McEveety, who said he heard it from Dziwisz [103] [104] Noonan had emailed Joaquín Navarro-Valls, the head of the Vatican's press office, for confirmation before writing her column, surprised that the \"famously close-mouthed\" Navarro-Valls had approved the use of the \"It is as it was\" quote, and his emailed response stated he had no other comment at that time [105] National Catholic Reporter journalist John L Allen Jr published a similar account on the same day, quoting an unnamed senior Vatican official [100] Reuters [105] and the Associated Press independently confirmed the story, citing Vatican sources [106]\n\n\nAllegations of antisemitism\nBefore the film was released, there were prominent criticisms of perceived antisemitic content in the film It was for that reason that 20th Century Fox decided to pass on the film, informing New York Assemblyman Dov Hikind that a protest outside the News Corporation Building made them decide against distributing the film Hikind warned other companies that \"they should not distribute this film This is unhealthy for Jews all over the world.\" [35]\n\n\nReactions to allegations of antisemitism\nFilm critic Roger Ebert, who awarded The Passion of the Christ four out of four stars in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, denied allegations that the film was anti-semitic Ebert described the film as \"a powerful and important film, helmed by a man with a sincere heart and a warrior's sense of justice It is a story filled with searing images and ultimately a message of redemption and hope.\" Ebert said, \"It also might just be the greatest cinematic version of the greatest story ever told.\" [123]\n\n\nCriticism of excessive violence\nA.O Scott in The New York Times wrote \"The Passion of the Christ is so relentlessly focused on the savagery of Jesus' final hours that this film seems to arise less from love than from wrath, and to succeed more in assaulting the spirit than in uplifting it.\" [128] David Edelstein, Slate's film critic, dubbed the film \"a two-hour-and-six-minute snuff movie—The Jesus Chainsaw Massacre—that thinks it's an act of faith\", and further criticized Gibson for focusing on the brutality of Jesus' execution, instead of his religious teachings [84]\n\n\nPlanned sequel\nIn June 2016, writer Randall Wallace stated that he and Gibson had begun work on a sequel to The Passion of the Christ which will focus on the resurrection of Jesus, and the events surrounding the resurrection [130] In 2018, Caviezel said that Gibson had sent him the third draft of the screenplay [131] [132] In 2020, Caviezel said that it would be titled The Passion of the Christ: Resurrection and predicted, \"It's going to be the biggest film in world history.\" [133]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal

{"title": "2014_FIFA_World_Cup", "content": "\nHost selection\nIn March 2003, FIFA announced that the tournament would be held in South America for the first time since 1978, in line with its policy at the time of rotating the right to host the World Cup among different confederations [13] [14] With the 2010 FIFA World Cup hosted in South Africa, it would be the second consecutive World Cup outside Europe, which was a first for the tournament It was also sixth time (second consecutive) in the Southern Hemisphere [15] Only Brazil and Colombia formally declared their candidacy but, after the withdrawal of the latter from the process, [16] Brazil was officially elected as host nation unopposed on 30 October 2007 [17]\n\n\nParticipating teams and officials\nFollowing qualification matches played between June 2011 and November 2013, the following 32 teams – shown with their last pre-tournament FIFA world ranking [18] – qualified for the final tournament Twenty-four of these teams were returning participants from the 2010 World Cup Bosnia and Herzegovina were the only team with no previous appearance at the World Cup finals [nb 1] [19] Colombia qualified for the World Cup after 16 years of absence, while Belgium and Russia both returned after 12 years Paraguay failed to qualify for the first time since 1994 This was also the first World Cup for 32 years that did not feature a representative from the Nordic countries Iran, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Croatia returned to the tournament after missing the 2010 tournament The highest ranked team not to qualify was Ukraine (ranked 16th), while the lowest ranked team that did qualify was Australia (ranked 62nd) [18]\n\n\nQualification\nFollowing qualification matches played between June 2011 and November 2013, the following 32 teams – shown with their last pre-tournament FIFA world ranking [18] – qualified for the final tournament Twenty-four of these teams were returning participants from the 2010 World Cup Bosnia and Herzegovina were the only team with no previous appearance at the World Cup finals [nb 1] [19] Colombia qualified for the World Cup after 16 years of absence, while Belgium and Russia both returned after 12 years Paraguay failed to qualify for the first time since 1994 This was also the first World Cup for 32 years that did not feature a representative from the Nordic countries Iran, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Croatia returned to the tournament after missing the 2010 tournament The highest ranked team not to qualify was Ukraine (ranked 16th), while the lowest ranked team that did qualify was Australia (ranked 62nd) [18]\n\n\nFinal draw\nThe 32 participating teams were drawn into eight groups In preparation for this, the teams were organised into four pots with the seven highest-ranked teams joining host nation Brazil in the seeded pot [20] As with the previous tournaments, FIFA aimed to create groups which maximised geographic separation and therefore the unseeded teams were arranged into pots based on geographic considerations [21] [22] The draw took place on 6 December 2013 at the Costa do Sauípe resort in Bahia, during which the teams were drawn by various past World Cup-winning players [23] [24] Under the draw procedure, one randomly drawn team – Italy – was firstly relocated from Pot 4 to Pot 2 to create four equal pots of eight teams [25]\n\n\nOfficials\nIn March 2013, FIFA published a list of 52 prospective referees, each paired, on the basis of nationality, with two assistant referees, from all six football confederations for the tournament On 14 January 2014, the FIFA Referees Committee appointed 25 referee trios and eight support duos representing 43 countries for the tournament [26] [27]\nYuichi Nishimura from Japan acted as referee in the opening match whereas Nicola Rizzoli from Italy acted as referee in the final [28] [29]\n\n\nSquads\nAs with the 2010 tournament, each team's squad consisted of 23 players (three of whom must be goalkeepers) Each participating national association had to confirm their final 23-player squad no later than 10 days before the start of the tournament [30] Teams were permitted to make late replacements in the event of serious injury, at any time up to 24 hours before their first game [30] During a match, all remaining squad members not named in the starting team were available to be one of the three permitted substitutions (provided the player was not serving a suspension) [30]\n\n\nVenues\n12 venues (seven new and five renovated) in twelve cities were selected for the tournament The venues covered all the main regions of Brazil and created more evenly distributed hosting than the 1950 finals in Brazil [31] Consequently, the tournament required long-distance travel for teams [32] During the World Cup, Brazilian cities were also home to the participating teams at 32 separate base camps, [33] as well as staging official fan fests where supporters could view the games [34]\n\n\nTeam base camps\nBase camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament On 31 January 2014, FIFA announced the base camps for each participating team, [33] having earlier circulated a brochure of 84 prospective locations [36] Most teams opted to stay in the Southeast Region of Brazil, with only eight teams choosing other regions; five teams (Croatia, Germany, Ghana, Greece and Switzerland) opted to stay in the Northeast Region and three teams (Ecuador, South Korea and Spain) opted to stay in the South Region None opted to stay in the North Region or the Central-West Region [37] Campo Bahia, the base camp of the eventual champion Germany, attracted much interest [38]\n\n\nFIFA Fan Fests\nFor a third consecutive World Cup tournament, FIFA staged FIFA Fan Fests in each of the 12 host cities throughout the competition Prominent examples were the Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, which already held a Fan Fest in 2010, and São Paulo's Vale do Anhangabaú [39] [40] The first official event took place on Iracema Beach, in Fortaleza, on 8 June 2014 [41]\n\n\nInnovations\nIn order to avoid ghost goals, the 2014 World Cup introduced goal-line technology following successful trials at, among other competitions, the 2013 Confederations Cup The chosen Goal Control system featured 14 high speed cameras, 7 directed to each of the goals Data were sent to the central image-processing centre, where a virtual representation of the ball was output on a widescreen to confirm the goal The referee was equipped with a watch which vibrated and displayed a signal upon a goal [42] [43] [44] France's second goal in their group game against Honduras was the first time goal-line technology was needed to confirm that a goal should be given [45]\n\n\nTechnologies\nIn order to avoid ghost goals, the 2014 World Cup introduced goal-line technology following successful trials at, among other

goal in their group game against Honduras was the first time goal-line technology was needed to confirm that a goal should be given [45]\n\n\nCooling breaks\nDue to the relatively high ambient temperatures in Brazil, particularly at the northern venues, cooling breaks for the players were introduced [51] Breaks could take place at the referee's discretion after the 30th minute of each half if the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature exceeded 32 °C (90 °F); the breaks would last 3 minutes, with this time made up by an extended period of stoppage time at the end of the half.\n\n\nAnti-doping\nThe biological passport was introduced in the FIFA World Cup starting in 2014 Blood and urine samples collected from all players before the competition, and from two players per team per match, were analysed by the Swiss Laboratory for Doping Analyses [57] FIFA reported that 91.5% of the players taking part in the tournament were tested before the start of the competition and none tested positive [58] However, FIFA was criticised for how it conducted doping tests [59] [60]\n\n\nFormat\n\nThe first round, or group stage, was a competition between the 32 teams divided among eight groups of four, where each group engaged in a round-robin tournament within itself The two highest ranked teams in each group advanced to the knockout stage [30] Teams were awarded three points for a win and one for a draw When comparing teams in a group over-all result came before head-to-head.\n\n\nOpening ceremony\nOn 12 June 2014, the 20th edition of the FIFA World Cup began with the opening ceremony at Arena de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil The event saw 660 dancers take to the stadium and perform in a ceremony which celebrated the nature of the country and its love of football Following the dancers native singer Claudia Leitte emerged on centre stage to perform for the crowd She was later joined by Cuban-American rapper Pitbull, and American singer Jennifer Lopez to perform the tournament's official song \"We Are One (Ole Ola)\" which had been released as an official single on 8 April 2014 Following the ceremony, the opening match was played, which saw the hosts come from behind to beat Croatia 3–1 [65] [66] [67]\n\n\nGroup stage\nThe group stage of the cup took place in Brazil from 12 June 2014 to 26 June 2014: each team played three games The group stage was notable for a scarcity of draws and a large number of goals The first drawn (and goalless) match did not occur until the 13th match of the tournament, between Iran and Nigeria: a drought longer than any World Cup since 1930 [68] The group stage produced a total of 136 goals (an average of 2.83 goals per match), nine fewer than were scored during the entire 2010 tournament [69] This is the largest number of goals in the group stage since the 32-team system was implemented in 1998 [70] and the largest average in a group stage since 1958 [71] World Cup holders Spain were eliminated after only two games, the quickest exit for the defending champions since Italy's from the 1950 tournament [72] Spain also became the fourth nation to be eliminated in the first round while holding the World Cup crown, the first one being Italy in 1950 (and again in 2010), Brazil in 1966, and France in 2002 [73] For the first time, two teams from Africa advanced to the second round, a feat that would be repeated in the 2022 tournament.\n\n\nGroup A\n\n\n\nGroup B\n\n\n\nGroup C\n\n\n\nGroup D\n\n\n\nGroup E\n\n\n\nGroup F\n\n\n\nGroup G\n\n\n\nGroup H\n\n\n\nKnockout stage\nResults decided after extra time are indicated

indicated by (p).\n\n\nRound of 16\nAll the group winners advanced into the quarter-finals They included four teams from UEFA, three from CONMEBOL, and one from CONCACAF Of the eight matches, five required extra-time, and two of these required penalty shoot-outs; this was the first time penalty shoot-outs occurred in more than one game in a round of 16 [nb 4] The goal average per game in the round of 16 was 2.25, a drop of 0.58 goals per game from the group stage [79] The eight teams to win in the round of 16 included four former champions (Brazil, Germany, Argentina and France), a three-time runner-up (Netherlands), and two first-time quarter-finalists (Colombia and Costa Rica) [80] [81] Belgium reached the quarter-finals for the first time since 1986 [82]\n\n\nQuarter-finals\nWith a 1–0 victory over France, Germany set a World Cup record with four consecutive semi-final appearances Brazil beat Colombia 2–1, but Brazil's Neymar was injured and missed the rest of the competition Argentina reached the final four for the first time since 1990 after a 1–0 win over Belgium The Netherlands reached the semi-finals for the second consecutive tournament, after overcoming Costa Rica in a penalty shoot-out following a 0–0 draw at the end of extra time, with goalkeeper Tim Krul having been substituted on for the shoot-out and saving two penalties.\n\n\nSemi-finals\nGermany qualified for the final for the eighth time with a historic 7–1 win over Brazil – the biggest defeat in Brazilian football since 1920 Miroslav Klose's goal in this match was his 16th throughout all World Cups, breaking the record he had previously shared with Ronaldo [83] Klose set another record by becoming the first player to appear in four World Cup semi-finals [84] Argentina reached their first final since 1990, and their fifth overall, after overcoming the Netherlands in a penalty shoot-out following a 0–0 draw at the end of extra time.\n\n\nThird place play-off\nThe Netherlands defeated Brazil 3–0 to secure third place, the first for the Dutch team in their history Overall, Brazil conceded 14 goals in the tournament; this was the most by a team at any single World Cup since 1986, and the most by a host nation in history, although their fourth-place finish still represented Brazil's best result in a World Cup since their last win in 2002 [85]\n\n\nFinal\nThe final featured Germany against Argentina for a record third time after 1986 and 1990.\n\n\nStatistics\nIn total, 171 goals were scored by a record 121 players, with five credited as own goals Goals scored from penalty shoot-outs are not counted.\nJames Rodríguez was awarded the Golden Boot for scoring six goals, the first time that a Colombian player received the award [86] [87]\n\n\nGoalscorers\nIn total, 171 goals were scored by a record 121 players, with five credited as own goals Goals scored from penalty shoot-outs are not counted.\nJames Rodríguez was awarded the Golden Boot for scoring six goals, the first time that a Colombian player received the award [86] [87]\n\n\nDiscipline\nThe most notable disciplinary case was that of Uruguayan striker Luis Suárez, who was suspended for nine international matches and banned from taking part in any football-related activity (including entering any stadium) for four months, following a biting incident on Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini He was also fined CHF100,000 [89] [90] [91] After an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, Suárez was later allowed to participate in training and friendly matches with new club Barcelona [92]\n\n\nAwards\nThe following awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament: [93] [94]\n\n\nAll-Star Team\nAs was the case during the 2010 edition, FIFA released an All-Star Team based on the Castrol performance index in its official website [102]\n\n\nDream Team\nFIFA also invited users of FIFA.com to elect their Dream Team [103] [104]\n\n\nPrize money\nThe total prize money on offer for the tournament was confirmed by FIFA as US$576 million (including payments of $70 million to domestic clubs and $100 million as player insurances), a 37 percent increase from the amount allocated in the 2010 tournament Before the tournament, each of the 32 entrants received $1.5 million for preparation costs At the tournament, the prize money was distributed as follows: [105]\n\n\nFinal standings\nPer statistical convention in football, matches decided in extra time are counted as wins and losses, while matches decided by penalty shoot-outs are counted as draws [106]\n\n\nPreparations and costs\nCosts of the tournament totalled $11.6 billion, [107] making it the most expensive World Cup to date, [108] until surpassed by 2018 FIFA World Cup which cost an estimated $14.2 billion [107] FIFA was expected to spend US$2 billion on staging the finals, [109] with its greatest single expense being the US$576 million prize money pot [105]\n\n\nMarketing\nThe marketing of the 2014 FIFA World Cup included sale of tickets, support from sponsors and promotion through events that utilise the symbols and songs of the

Finals, the coverage was provided by HBS (Host Broadcast Services), a subsidiary of Infront Sports & Media [126] Sony was selected as the official equipment provider and built 12 bespoke high definition production 40-foot-long containers, one for each tournament venue, to house the extensive amount of equipment required [127] [128] Each match utilised 37 standard camera plans, including Aerial and Cablecam, two Ultramotion cameras and dedicated cameras for interviews [128] The official tournament film, as well as three matches, [nb 5] will be filmed with ultra high definition technology (4K resolution), following a successful trial at the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup [129]\n\n\nControversies\nThe 2014 FIFA World Cup generated various controversies, including demonstrations, some of which took place even before the tournament started Furthermore, there were various issues with safety, including the death of eight workers and a fire during construction, breaches into stadiums, an unstable makeshift staircase at the Maracanã Stadium, a monorail collapse, and the collapse of an unfinished overpass in Belo Horizonte [137] [138] [139] [140] [141] The houses of thousands of families living in Rio de Janeiro’s slums were cleared for redevelopments for the World Cup in spite of protests and resistance Favela do Metrô, near the Maracanã Stadium, was completely destroyed as a result, having previously housed 700 families in 2010 [142] [143] [144]\n\n\nProtests\nPrior to the opening ceremony of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup staged in Brazil, demonstrations took place outside the venue, organised by people unhappy with the amount of public money spent to enable the hosting of the FIFA World Cup [145] Both the Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff and FIFA president Sepp Blatter were heavily booed as they were announced to give their speeches at the 2013 tournament's opening, [146] which resulted in FIFA announcing that the 2014 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony would not feature any speeches [147] Further protests took place during the Confederations Cup as well as prior to and during the World Cup [148] [149] [150] [151] [152]\n\n\nBreaches into stadiums\nAt the Group B match between Spain and Chile, around 100 Chilean supporters who had gathered outside Maracanã Stadium forced their way into the stadium and caused damage to the media centre Military police reported that 85 Chileans were detained during the events, while others reached the stands Earlier, about 20 Argentinians made a similar breach during Argentina's Group F game against Bosnia and Herzegovina at the same stadium [153] [154]\n\n\nBridge collapse\nOn 3 July 2014, an overpass under construction in Belo Horizonte as part of the World Cup infrastructure projects collapsed onto a busy carriageway below, leaving two people dead and 22 others injured [155] [156]\n\n\nHead injuries\nDuring the tournament, FIFA received significant criticism for the way head injuries are handled during matches Two incidents in particular attracted the most attention First, in a group stage match, after Uruguayan defender Álvaro Pereira received a blow to the head, he lay unconscious [157] The Uruguayan doctor signaled for the player to be substituted, but he returned to the match The incident drew criticism from the professional players' union FIFPro, and from Michel D'Hooghe, a member of the FIFA executive board and chairman of its medical committee [158]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "The 2014 FIFA World Cup was the 20th edition of the FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial international football tournament contested by the men's national teams of the member associations of FIFA. The tournament was held in Brazil from 12 June to 13 July 2014.\n\n**Host selection**\n\nIn March 2003, FIFA announced that the tournament would be held in South America for the first time since 1978, in line with its policy at the time of rotating the right to host the World Cup among different confederations. With the 2010 FIFA World Cup hosted in South Africa, it would be the second consecutive World Cup outside Europe, which was a first for the tournament. It was also the sixth time (second consecutive) in the Southern Hemisphere. Only Brazil and Colombia formally declared their candidacy but, after the withdrawal of the latter from the process, Brazil was officially elected as host nation unopposed on 30 October 2007.\n\n**Participating teams and officials**\n\nFollowing qualification matches played between June 2011 and November 2013, the following 32 teams – shown with their last pre-tournament FIFA world ranking – qualified for the final tournament. Twenty-four of these teams were returning participants from the 2010 World Cup. Bosnia and Herzegovina were the only team with no previous appearance at the World Cup finals. Colombia qualified for the World Cup after 16 years of absence, while Belgium and Russia both returned after 12 years. Paraguay failed to qualify for the first time since 1994. This was also the first World Cup for 32 years that did not feature a representative from the Nordic countries. Iran, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Croatia returned to the tournament after missing the 2010 tournament. The highest ranked team not to qualify was Ukraine (ranked 16th), while the lowest ranked team that did qualify was Australia (ranked 62nd).\n\n**Qualification**\n\nFollowing qualification matches played between June 2011 and November 2013, the following 32 teams – shown with their last pre-tournament FIFA world ranking – qualified for the final tournament. Twenty-four of these teams were returning participants from the 2010 World Cup. Bosnia and Herzegovina were the only team with no previous appearance at the World Cup finals.

This was also the first World Cup for 32 years that did not feature a representative from the Nordic countries. Iran, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Croatia returned to the tournament after missing the 2010 tournament. The highest ranked team not to qualify was Ukraine (ranked 16th), while the lowest ranked team that did qualify was Australia (ranked 62nd).\n\n**Final draw**\n\nThe 32 participating teams were drawn into eight groups. In preparation for this, the teams were organised into four pots with the seven highest-ranked teams joining host nation Brazil in the seeded pot. As with the previous tournaments, FIFA aimed to create groups which maximised geographic separation and therefore the unseeded teams were arranged into pots based on geographic considerations. The draw took place on 6 December 2013 at the Costa do Sauípe resort in Bahia, during which the teams were drawn by various past World Cup-winning players. Under the draw procedure, one randomly drawn team – Italy – was firstly relocated from Pot 4 to Pot 2 to create four equal pots of eight teams.\n\n**Officials**\n\nIn March 2013, FIFA published a list of 52 prospective referees, each paired, on the basis of nationality, with two assistant referees, from all six football confederations for the tournament. On 14 January 2014, the FIFA Referees Committee appointed 25 referee trios and eight support duos representing 43 countries for the tournament. Yuichi Nishimura from Japan acted as referee in the opening match, whereas Nicola Rizzoli from Italy acted as referee in the final.\n\n**Squads**\n\nAs with the 2010 tournament, each team's squad consisted of 23 players (three of whom must be goalkeepers). Each participating national association had to confirm their final 23-player squad no later than 10 days before the start of the tournament. Teams were permitted to make late replacements in the event of serious injury, at any time up to 24 hours before their first game. During a match, all remaining squad members not named in the starting team were available to be one of the three permitted substitutions (provided the player was not serving a suspension).\n\n**Venues**\n\n12 venues (seven new and five renovated) in twelve cities were selected for the tournament. The venues covered all the main regions of Brazil and created more evenly distributed hosting than the 1950 finals in Brazil. Consequently, the tournament required long-distance travel for teams. During the World Cup, Brazilian cities were also home to the participating teams at 32 separate base camps, as well as staging official fan fests where supporters could view the games.\n\n**Team base camps**\n\nBase camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament. On 31 January 2014, FIFA announced the base camps for each participating team, having earlier circulated a brochure of 84 prospective locations. Most teams opted to stay in the Southeast Region of Brazil, with only eight teams choosing other regions; five teams (Croatia, Germany, Ghana, Greece and Switzerland) opted to stay in the Northeast Region and three teams (Ecuador, South Korea and Spain) opted to stay in the South Region. None opted to stay in the North Region or the Central-West Region.\n\n**FIFA Fan Fests**\n\nFor a third consecutive World Cup tournament, FIFA staged FIFA Fan Fests in each of the 12 host cities throughout the competition. Prominent examples were the Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, which already held a Fan Fest in 2010, and São Paulo's Vale do Anhangabaú. The first official event took place on Iracema Beach, in Fortaleza, on 8 June 2014.\n\n**Innovations**\n\nIn order to avoid ghost goals, the 2014 World Cup introduced goal-line technology following successful trials at, among other competitions, the 2013 Confederations Cup. The chosen Goal Control system featured 14 high-speed cameras, 7 directed to each of the goals. Data were sent to the central image-processing centre, where a virtual representation of the ball was output on a widescreen to confirm the goal. The referee was equipped with a watch which vibrated and displayed a signal upon a goal. France's second goal in their group game against Honduras was the first time goal-line technology was needed to confirm that a goal should be given.\n\n**Technologies**\n\nIn order to avoid ghost goals, the 2014 World Cup introduced goal-line technology following successful trials at, among other competitions, the 2013 Confederations Cup.

France's second goal in their group game against Honduras was the first time goal-line technology was needed to confirm that a goal should be given.\n\n**Cooling breaks**\n\nDue to the relatively high ambient temperatures in Brazil, particularly at the northern venues, cooling breaks for the players were introduced. Breaks could take place at the referee's discretion after the 30th minute of each half if the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature exceeded 32°C (90°F); the breaks would last 3 minutes, with this time made up by an extended period of stoppage time at the end of the half.\n\n**Anti-doping**\n\nThe biological passport was introduced in the FIFA World Cup starting in 2014. Blood and urine samples collected from all players before the competition, and from two players per team per match, were analysed by the Swiss Laboratory for Doping Analyses. FIFA reported that 91.5% of the players taking part in the tournament were tested before the start of the competition and none tested positive. However, FIFA was criticised for how it conducted doping tests.\n\n**Format**\n\nThe first round, or group stage, was a competition between the 32 teams divided among eight groups of four, where each group engaged in a round-robin tournament within itself. The two highest ranked teams in each group advanced to the knockout stage. Teams were awarded three points for a win and one for a draw. When comparing teams in a group, overall result came before head-to-head.\n\n**Opening ceremony**\n\nOn 12 June 2014, the 20th edition of the FIFA World Cup began with the opening ceremony at Arena de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. The event saw 660 dancers take to the stadium and perform in a ceremony which celebrated the nature of the country and its love of football. Following the dancers, native singer Claudia Leitte emerged on centre stage to perform for the crowd. She was later joined by Cuban-American rapper Pitbull, and American singer Jennifer Lopez to perform the tournament's official song \"We Are One (Ole Ola)\" which had been released as an official single on 8 April 2014. Following the ceremony, the opening match was played, which saw the hosts come from behind to beat Croatia 3-1.\n\n**Group stage**\n\nThe group stage of the cup took place in Brazil from 12 June 2014 to 26 June 2014: each team played three games. The group stage was notable for a scarcity of draws and a large number of goals. The first drawn (and goalless) match did not occur until the 13th match of the tournament, between Iran and Nigeria: a drought longer than any World Cup since 1930. The group stage produced a total of 136 goals (an average of 2.83 goals per match), nine fewer than were scored during the entire 2010 tournament. This is the largest number of goals in the group stage since the 32-team system was implemented in 1998 and the largest average in a group stage since 1958. World Cup holders Spain were eliminated after only two games, the quickest exit for the defending champions since Italy's from the 1950 tournament. Spain also became the fourth nation to be eliminated in the first round while holding the World Cup crown, the first one being Italy in 1950 (and again in 2010), Brazil in 1966, and France in 2002. For the first time, two teams from Africa advanced to the second round, a feat that would be repeated in the 2022 tournament.\n\n**Group A**\n\n| Team | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts |\n|  Brazil | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 7 | 2 | +5 | 7 |\n|  Mexico | 3 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 4 | 3 | +1 | 6 |\n|  Cameroon | 3 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 3 | +1 | 4 |\n|  Croatia | 3 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 1 | 6 | −5 | 0 |\n\n**Group B**\n\n| Team | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts |\n|  Spain | 3 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 3 | 0 | 6 |\n|  Netherlands | 3 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 3 | 4 | −1 | 4 |\n|  Chile | 3 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 3 | +1 | 4 |\n|  Australia | 3 | 0 | 2 | 1 | 3 | 5 | −2 | 2 |\n\n**Group C**\n\n| Team | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts |\n|  Colombia | 3 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 5 | 4 | +1 | 6 |\n|  Greece | 3 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 4 |\n|  Côte d'Ivoire | 3 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 3 | +1 | 4 |\n|  Japan | 3 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 4 | −2 | 3 |\n\n**Group D**\n\n| Team | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts |\n|  Costa Rica | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 4 | 1 | +3 | 7 |\n|  Uruguay | 3 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 4 | 0 | 4 |\n|  Italy | 3 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 3 | −1 | 3 |\n|  England | 3 | 0 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | −1 | 2 |\n\n**Group E**\n\n| Team | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts |\n|  Switzerland | 3 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 7 | 6 | +1 | 6 |\n|  Ecuador | 3 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 3 | 2 | +1 | 5 |\n|  France | 3 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 3 | 3 | 0 | 4 |\n|  Honduras | 3 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 3 | −2 | 1 |\n\n**Group F**\n\n| Team | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts |\n|  Argentina | 3 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 4 | 3 | +1 | 6 |\n|  Bosnia and Herzegovina | 3 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 4 | 0 | 4 |\n|  Iran | 3 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | −1 | 4 |\n|  Nigeria | 3 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 0 | 3 |\n\n**Group G**\n\n| Team | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts |\n|  Germany | 3 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 7 | 2 | +5 | 6 |\n|  Ghana | 3 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 4 | 3 | +1 | 6 |\n|  United States | 3 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 4 | 0 | 4 |\n|  Portugal | 3 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 4 | 9 | −5 | 1 |\n\n**Group H**\n\n| Team | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts |\n|  Belgium | 3 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 1 | +3 | 9 |\n|  Algeria | 3 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 6 | 5 | +1 | 4 |\n|  Russia | 3 | 0 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | −1 | 2 |\n|  South Korea | 3 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 6 | −3 | 1 |\n\n**Knockout stage**\n\nThe knockout stage began on 28 June 2014 and ended on 13 July 2014.

question.\n\n\nPre-production\nBy October 2014, Robert Downey Jr had entered final negotiations to reprise his role as Tony Stark / Iron Man in the film Downey was added in order for the film to adapt the 2006–07 \"Civil War\" comic book storyline written by Mark Millar, which pitted Iron Man against Captain America [18] At the end of the month, it was confirmed that Sebastian Stan would return as Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier [23] A few days later, Marvel revealed that the film would be titled Captain America: Civil War, confirming Downey's appearance and announcing that Chadwick Boseman would appear in the film as Black Panther ahead of his own solo film [15] [37] [38] Feige also confirmed that the film would be the first in the MCU's Phase Three slate of films [100] Anthony Russo stated that adapting the \"Civil War\" storyline was not always the intended storyline and direction for the film when the brothers initially signed on to return as directors [114] Markus expanded on this, saying the original concept for a third Captain America film \"never got to draft\", with Feige at some point telling the writing team to begin adapting \"Civil War\" around their original ideas McFeely also added that, despite the shift in direction for the film, \"The central theme, even the way Zemo is operating, are from that  [early] iteration.\" [115] The Russos revealed that, had negotiations with Downey to appear in the film failed, they would have used the Madbomb storyline from the Captain America comics, which was eventually used as a plot point in the first season of the Agent Carter TV series The premise for the film would have centered on Zemo detonating the Madbomb, which would \"turn hordes of people into berserkers\" to present a physical threat to Captain America, while still pitting heroes against each other, as some would be zombified due to the Madbomb, to satisfy an \"emotional component\" for the film [116]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began on April 27, 2015, [126] [127] in Fayette County, Georgia, at Pinewood Atlanta Studios, [128] under the working title Sputnik [129] Other filming locations in the Atlanta metropolitan area included the Buckhead district of Atlanta; [130] the Peachtree Christian Church in Midtown Atlanta; [131] Downtown Atlanta, [132] including an area near Philips Arena known as The Gulch, which served as the market in Lagos; [133] Norcross, Georgia; [130] Porsche's headquarters in Atlanta at Aerotropolis Atlanta, which served as the Avengers' headquarters in the film; [31] and the Atlanta Civic Center, which served as the IFID (Institute for Infectious Diseases) laboratory in Lagos; the latter's interiors doubled as MIT, and a third part was used for a Berlin location [133] Trent Opaloch served as director of photography, [108] while Chad Stahelski, David Leitch, and The Winter Soldier stuntman Spiro Razatos were second unit directors [134]\n\n\nPost-production\nIn September 2015, Mark Ruffalo, who plays Bruce Banner / Hulk in the MCU films, stated that his character was originally in the Civil War script, but was removed due to the end of Age of Ultron, as Marvel did not \"want to reveal where  [he is] and why\" in this film [159] Markus added that as soon as the Hulk joined a side, the fight would be quickly over, saying, \"You've got to kind of choose your roster  [of characters] depending on what kind of fight you want to have.\" [65] He later explained that he contemplated having the Hulk appear at the very end of the film, but decided against it, feeling that he was over-stuffing the film with characters, adding, \" [The Hulk] has clearly gone somewhere at the end of  [Age of] Ultron, and that's a story Don't blow it off and put it in a little tiny chunk just to put in a little extra filigree on our movie.\" [160] Additionally, Ross' alter ego, Red Hulk, was also considered for inclusion, but the Russos felt that part of the character would need a proper backstory which they could not afford to give in the already crowded film They felt that Ross \"was there sort of as the government's agenda and not to add another complicated super powered character to the mix.\" Spider-Man's Iron Spider suit was also considered [161]\n\n\nVisual effects\nNearly 20 visual effects studios worked on Captain America: Civil War including Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Lola VFX, Method Studios, Luma Pictures, DNEG, Image Engine, Trixter, Cinesite, and The Third Floor amongst others Lola VFX de-aged Downey Jr in a scene that involved a younger holographic version of himself Lola VFX's visual effects supervisor, Trent Claus said, \"In this case, we analyzed footage of Mr Downey at the approximate age that we wanted to target, which was around the time of the film Less than Zero  [when Downey was in his early 20s].\" He also noted the difficulty of the scene, due to it being close to 4,000 frames, and the fact that Downey was moving his head from side to side multiple times Lola also worked on visual effects for the Vision [155] The Third Floor extensively previsualized the film including the fight scene at Leipzig/Halle Airport Gerardo Ramirez, the Previs and Postvis Supervisor for The Third Floor said:\n\n\nMusic\nHenry Jackman returned from The Winter Soldier to score the sequel [170] He found the movie to be tonally different from the previous one, which necessitated a much more symphonic and orchestral score This culminates in the final fight between Captain America, Winter Soldier, and Iron Man, the music for which Jackman described as \"somewhat operatic and .. almost classical in its style\" [171] Though Jackman reprised and developed his themes for Captain America and the Winter Soldier from the previous film, [172] [173] and introduced motifs for the new characters Spider-Man, Black Panther, and Zemo, [171] he was wary of pushing the audience to one side of the central conflict or the other by using character-specific music; Jackman composed a new main theme for the film to represent the Civil War, \"a generic theme to balance everything out\", [174] \"toward which all the characters can gravitate It wrapped them all up and it helped to bind the movie together rather than do endless disparate themes.\" [175] Jackman also wrote a thriller theme that appears whenever the mystery surrounding Zemo's plan is explored This was inspired by the works of Jerry Goldsmith [172] The score was released on a soundtrack album by Hollywood Records on May 6, 2016 [176]\n\n\nMarketing\nIn

Agent Carter TV series The premise for the film would have centered on Zemo detonating the Madbomb, which would \"turn hordes of people into berserkers\" to present a physical threat to Captain America, while still pitting heroes against each other, as some would be zombified due to the Madbomb, to satisfy an \"emotional component\" for the film [116]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography

included the Buckhead district of Atlanta; [130] the Peachtree Christian Church in Midtown Atlanta; [131] Downtown Atlanta, [132] including an area near Philips Arena known as The Gulch, which served as the market in Lagos; [133] Norcross, Georgia; [130] Porsche's headquarters in Atlanta at Aerotropolis Atlanta, which served as the Avengers' headquarters in the film; [31] and the Atlanta Civic Center, which served as the IFID (Institute for Infectious Diseases) laboratory in Lagos; the latter's interiors doubled as MIT, and a third part was used for a Berlin location [133] Trent Opaloch served as director of photography, [108] while Chad Stahelski, David Leitch, and The Winter Soldier stuntman Spiro Razatos were second unit directors [134]\n\n\nPost-production\nIn September 2015, Mark Ruffalo, who plays Bruce Banner / Hulk in the MCU films, stated that his character was originally in the Civil War script, but was removed due to the end of Age of Ultron, as Marvel did not \"want to reveal where  [he is] and why\" in this film [159] Markus added that as soon as the Hulk joined a side, the fight would be quickly over, saying, \"You've got to kind of choose your roster  [of characters] depending on what kind of fight you want to have.\" [65] He later explained that he contemplated having the Hulk appear at the very end of the film, but decided against it, feeling that he was over-stuffing the film with characters, adding, \" [The Hulk] has clearly gone somewhere at the end of  [Age of] Ultron, and that's a story Don't blow it off and put it in a little tiny chunk just to put in a little extra filigree on our movie.\" [160] Additionally, Ross' alter ego, Red Hulk, was also considered for inclusion, but the Russos felt that part of the character would need a proper backstory which they could not afford to give in the already crowded film They felt that Ross \"was there sort of as the government's agenda and not to add another complicated super powered character to the mix.\" Spider-Man's Iron Spider suit was also considered [161]\n\n\nVisual effects\nNearly 20 visual effects studios worked on Captain America: Civil War including Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Lola VFX, Method Studios, Luma Pictures, DNEG, Image Engine, Trixter, Cinesite, and The Third Floor amongst others Lola VFX de-aged Downey Jr in a scene that involved a younger holographic version of himself Lola VFX's visual effects supervisor, Trent Claus said, \"In this case, we analyzed footage of Mr Downey at the approximate age that we wanted to target, which was around the time of the film Less than Zero  [when Downey was in his early 20s].\" He also noted the difficulty of the scene, due to it being close to 4,000 frames, and the fact that Downey was moving his head from side to side multiple times Lola also worked on visual effects for the Vision [155] The Third Floor extensively previsualized the film including the fight scene at Leipzig/Halle Airport Gerardo Ramirez, the Previs and Postvis Supervisor for The Third Floor said:\n\n\nMusic\nHenry Jackman returned from The Winter Soldier to score the sequel [170] He found the movie to be tonally different from the previous one, which necessitated a much more symphonic and orchestral score This culminates in the final fight between Captain America, Winter Soldier, and Iron Man, the music for which Jackman described as \"somewhat operatic and .. almost classical in its style\" [171] Though Jackman reprised and developed his themes for Captain America and the Winter Soldier from the previous film, [172] [173] and introduced motifs for the new characters Spider-Man, Black Panther, and Zemo, [171] he was wary of pushing the audience to one side of the central conflict or the other by using character-specific music; Jackman composed a new main theme for the film to represent the Civil War, \"a generic theme to balance everything out\", [174] \"toward which all the characters can gravitate It wrapped them all up and it helped to bind the movie together rather than do endless disparate themes.\" [175] Jackman also wrote a thriller theme that appears whenever the mystery surrounding Zemo's plan is explored This was inspired by the works of Jerry Goldsmith [172] The score was released on a soundtrack album by Hollywood Records on May 6, 2016 [176]\n\n\nMarketing\nIn early July 2015, Marvel began a viral marketing campaign for Ant-Man featuring Leslie Bibb, reprising her role from the Iron Man films as journalist Christine Everhart, reporting for the faux news

Italian Spiderman in the following movies [68] In November 2019, Lord indicated that the character Takuya Yamashiro was designed, though he didn't make an appearance in the movie [69] In August 2020, Jake Johnson expressed hope that he could reprise his role as Peter B Parker from the first film in the sequel [70] Issa Rae was cast as Jess Drew / Spider-Woman in June 2021, [10] Johnson confirmed that he would be returning for the sequel a month later, [16] and Oscar Isaac was confirmed in December to be reprising his role of Miguel O'Hara / Spider-Man 2099 from the post-credits scene of Into the Spider-Verse [61] [24] Also in December, Tom Holland—who plays Peter Parker / Spider-Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe—revealed that Pascal had approached him about appearing in the Spider-Verse films during the filming of Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) Holland and his co-stars Zendaya and Jacob Batalon all expressed interest in appearing in the upcoming films [71] Jeff Sneider of The Ankler reported in February 2023 that Holland was set to appear in a live-action sequence and that this had caused the film's delay from 2022 to 2023; Holland ultimately did not appear [72] Christopher Daniel Barnes, who voiced Spider-Man in Spider-Man: The Animated Series (1994–1998), also expressed interest in returning for the film [73]\n\n\nAnimation and design\nLord revealed that design work for new characters in the film had begun by November 2019, [69] with comic book artist Kris Anka later revealing that he was serving as a character designer on the film [81] [82] On June 9, 2020, the film's lead animator Nick Kondo announced that production had started [83] The different universes visited in the film were designed to look like they were each drawn by a different artist [61] Having learned new animation tools after working on The Mitchells vs the Machines (2021) following the first Spider-Verse film, Lord and Miller ambitiously employed them to develop six different animation styles The intent was to amaze the audience whenever the characters cross into a new environment so the film can accurately reflect its plot and the styles can generate various emotional backdrops [84] Earth-65, the home of Gwen Stacy, was designed to look like \"impressionistic\" watercolor paintings The animation team created a simulator to generate this style and used a visual palette that reflects Gwen's emotions like a \"three dimensional mood ring\" [18] According to co-director Justin K Thompson, the reflection of her emotions through colors is inspired by a scene in 1950's Cinderella where her dress gets torn, and the environment reacts to that trauma This style was also intended by Miller to remind the audience about the covers of the Spider-Gwen comic books [citation needed] One of the two alternate Earths seen in the trailer was Earth-50101, which the crew nicknamed \"Mumbattan\" after Mumbai and Manhattan, due to that world being based on the one from Gotham Entertainment Group's Spider-Man: India comic book series [85] To give the character Pavitr Prabhakar unique motion and fighting style, the creative team researched the 2000-year-old Indian martial arts, Kalaripayattu, [citation needed] from the state of Kerala The other universe was Nueva York, the futuristic New York City from the Marvel 2099 world, was heavily influenced by Syd Mead's neo-futurist illustrations, which has an unfinished look [85] Also the works of artists Ron Cobb, John Bell, John Berkey, John Harris and Ralph McQuarrie were inspirations for the city's design, in addition to the architecture of Oscar Niemeyer The city was created as a highly controlled environment reflecting Miguel's personality, and has an authoritarian, brutalist and minimalist

to numerous requests from Lord for changes to already finished animation, as well as the need for him to approve animation layouts early in production [3] [102] [103] Lord's directions were said to take precedence over the decisions of the film's directing team and led to numerous weeks of long overtime as the animators drastically revised portions of the film several times They further stated that difficult working conditions caused by the constant revisions caused over 100 artists to leave the project before its completion, and that both Into the Spider-Verse and The Mitchells vs the Machines (two earlier movies that Lord and Miller co-produced for Sony) suffered from similar production issues [3] One artist said that production on Beyond the Spider-Verse, the film's sequel, had not progressed, and that there was \"no way that\" it would be completed in time for its scheduled March 2024 release window Sony denied the allegations concerning Across the Spider-Verse's production troubles, while declining to comment on the possibility of the sequel being delayed, and producer Amy Pascal called the process of heavy revision normal [102] [103]\n\n\nMusic\nDaniel Pemberton

them [110] Christian Holub of Entertainment Weekly felt the Spider-People were more antagonistic and that Miles' family was in more danger than in the first film [111] Meanwhile, Abid Rahman from The Hollywood Reporter compared Miles' introduction to the Spider-People in the trailer to the \"vibe\" of Citadel of Ricks and highlighted the reference to the Spider-Man pointing meme [112] Commentators also noted that the trailer posited that Miles could potentially have to choose between saving the multiverse or his family [110] [111] [112]\n\n\nRelease\nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse

delayed in the MENA region until June 22, 2023, but later withdrawn from cinemas across the region because the film briefly features transgender iconography, [125] [126] [127] such as a transgender flag on a banner seen hanging in Gwen Stacy's bedroom with the words \"Protect Trans Kids\" The flag's appearance led to speculation that Gwen supports her universe's transgender rights movement and led to interpretations of Gwen's story being a transgender allegory, with some interpreting Gwen herself as being transgender [126] [128] Although she is not identified as transgender in the film, viewers and critics who supported this interpretation additionally pointed to the use of the flag's colors (light pink, light blue, and white) elsewhere in scenes involving Gwen and her universe, and the perceived parallels to coming out in her character arc within the film [128] [129] However, others have noted that the pink, blue and white colors were already used by the comics' version of Spider-Woman Gwen Stacy, and thus were not necessarily proof that the film version of the character is trans [126]\n\n\nHome media\nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse was released on digital download

theatrical cut, such as the removal of several lines of dialogue [131] This version, which was also available in some theaters, was described by Miller as \"an international version\" of the film created to help with the necessary translations needed and to be approved by the French censorship board He added that the animators \"cleaned up and tweaked\" some of the shots that had already been submitted for the finished version, with other members of the team, such as in the sound department, also suggesting alternate ideas, stating, \"Because it's a multiverse movie, it's like there's a multiverse of the movie – that was really the reasoning behind it It was trying to make the best possible version that everyone was going to be the proudest of.\" Lord believed some of these changes created an improved film [132] Some of the alterations have been controversial with the film's fanbase [133]\n\n\nReception\nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse grossed $381.6 million in the United

Italian Spiderman in the following movies [68] In November 2019, Lord indicated that the character Takuya Yamashiro was designed, though he didn't make an appearance in the movie [69] In August 2020, Jake Johnson expressed hope that he could reprise his role as Peter B Parker from the first film in the sequel [70] Issa Rae was cast as Jess Drew / Spider-Woman in June 2021, [10] Johnson confirmed

Spider-Verse films during the filming of Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) Holland and his co-stars Zendaya and Jacob Batalon all expressed interest in appearing in the upcoming films [71] Jeff Sneider of The Ankler reported in February 2023 that Holland was set to appear in a live-action sequence and that this had caused the film's delay from 2022 to 2023; Holland ultimately did not appear [72]

design work for new characters in the film had begun by November 2019, [69] with comic book artist Kris Anka later revealing that he was serving as a character designer on the film [81] [82] On June 9, 2020, the film's lead animator Nick Kondo announced that production had started [83] The different universes visited in the film were designed to look like they were each drawn by a different artist [61] Having learned new animation tools after working on The Mitchells vs the Machines (2021) following the first Spider-Verse film, Lord and Miller ambitiously employed them to develop six different animation styles The intent was to amaze the audience whenever the characters cross into a new environment so the film can accurately reflect its plot and the styles can generate various emotional backdrops [84] Earth-65, the home of Gwen Stacy, was designed to look like \"impressionistic\" watercolor paintings The animation team created a simulator to generate this style and used a visual palette that reflects Gwen's emotions like a \"three dimensional mood ring\" [18] According to co-director Justin K Thompson, the reflection of her emotions through colors is inspired by a scene in 1950's Cinderella where her dress gets torn, and the environment reacts to that trauma This style was also intended by Miller to remind the audience about the covers of the Spider-Gwen comic books [citation needed] One of the two alternate Earths seen in the trailer was Earth-50101, which the crew nicknamed \"Mumbattan\" after Mumbai and Manhattan, due to that world being based on the one from Gotham Entertainment Group's Spider-Man: India comic book series [85] To give the character Pavitr Prabhakar unique motion and fighting style, the creative team researched the 2000-year-old Indian martial arts, Kalaripayattu, [citation needed] from the state of Kerala The other universe was Nueva York, the futuristic New York City from the Marvel 2099 world, was heavily influenced by Syd Mead's neo-futurist illustrations, which has an unfinished look [85] Also the works of artists Ron Cobb, John Bell, John Berkey, John Harris and Ralph McQuarrie were inspirations for the city's design, in addition to the architecture of Oscar Niemeyer The city was created as a highly controlled environment reflecting Miguel's personality, and has an authoritarian, brutalist and minimalist style of design meant to represent a \"clean, strong, unified, front-facing ideology\" But when going underground one realizes that it's a world that can't really be controlled [86] [87]\n\n\nPost-production\nIn May 2023, Powers revealed that the film would end on a cliffhanger and co-director Dos Santos compared it to the Star Wars original trilogy film The Empire Strikes Back (1980) [97] Powers explained:\n\n\nAllegations of poor working conditions\nOn June 23, 2023, Vulture reported that four people who worked on the film alleged that production had faced difficulties due to numerous requests from Lord for changes to already finished animation, as well as the need for him to approve animation layouts early in production [3] [102] [103] Lord's directions were said to take precedence over the decisions of the film's directing team and led to numerous weeks of long overtime as the animators drastically revised portions of the film several times They further stated that difficult working conditions caused by the constant revisions caused over 100 artists to leave the project before its completion, and that both Into the Spider-Verse and The Mitchells vs the Machines (two earlier movies that Lord and Miller co-produced for Sony) suffered from similar production issues [3] One artist said that production on Beyond the Spider-Verse, the film's sequel, had not progressed, and that there was \"no way that\" it would be completed in time for its scheduled March 2024 release window Sony denied the allegations concerning Across the Spider-Verse's production troubles, while declining to comment on the possibility of the sequel being delayed, and producer Amy Pascal called the process of heavy revision normal [102] [103]\n\n\nMusic\nDaniel Pemberton

of the film (with unfinished animation) at Sony's CinemaCon panel [62] Lord, Miller, and the directors showed the same footage at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival in June, with updated

[108] A second trailer was released on April 4 It gained 148.6M views within 24 hours, becoming the most-viewed second trailer for a Marvel film within that timespan and also the most-viewed superhero film trailer of the summer [109] Rolling Stone's Larisha Paul remarked that Miles wanted the other heroes to accept and validate him but also wanted to create his own story and not be controlled by them [110] Christian Holub of Entertainment Weekly felt the Spider-People were more antagonistic and that Miles' family was in more danger than in the first film [111] Meanwhile, Abid Rahman from The Hollywood Reporter compared Miles' introduction to the Spider-People in the trailer to the \"vibe\" of Citadel of Ricks and highlighted the reference to the Spider-Man pointing meme [112] Commentators also noted that the trailer posited that Miles could potentially have to choose between saving the multiverse or his family [110] [111] [112]\n\n\nRelease\nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse

delayed in the MENA region until June 22, 2023, but later withdrawn from cinemas across the region because the film briefly features transgender iconography, [125] [126] [127] such as a transgender flag on a banner seen hanging in Gwen Stacy's bedroom with the words \"Protect Trans Kids\" The flag's appearance led to speculation that Gwen supports her universe's transgender rights movement and led to interpretations of Gwen's story being a transgender allegory, with some interpreting Gwen herself as being transgender [126] [128] Although she is not identified as transgender in the film, viewers and critics who supported this interpretation additionally pointed to the use of the flag's colors (light pink, light blue, and white) elsewhere in scenes involving Gwen and her universe, and the perceived parallels to coming out in her character arc within the film [128] [129] However, others have noted that the pink, blue and white colors were already used by the comics' version of Spider-Woman Gwen Stacy, and thus were not necessarily proof that the film version of the character is trans [126]\n\n\nHome media\nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse was released on digital download by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on August 8, 2023, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on September 5 [130] The digital release of the film featured additional alterations from the initial theatrical cut, such as the removal of several lines of dialogue [131] This version, which was also available in some theaters, was described by Miller as \"an international version\" of the film created to help with the necessary translations needed and to be approved by the French censorship board He added that the animators \"cleaned up and tweaked\" some of the shots that had already been submitted for the finished version, with other members of the team, such as in the sound department, also suggesting alternate ideas, stating, \"Because it's a multiverse movie, it's like there's a multiverse of the movie – that was really the reasoning behind it It was trying to make the best possible version that everyone was going to be the proudest of.\" Lord believed some of these changes created an improved film [132] Some of the alterations have been controversial with the film's fanbase [133]\n\n\nReception\nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse grossed $381.6 million in the United

Her early life was marked by frequent moves between Canada and the United Kingdom, which would later influence her acting career.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nKim Cattrall was born to secretary Gladys Shane (née Baugh; 1929–2022) and construction engineer Dennis Cattrall (1925–2012). She has two sisters and a brother named Christopher Cattrall (1963–2018), who would later pass away. When Cattrall was just three months old, her family emigrated to Canada and settled in Courtenay, British Columbia. This marked the beginning of a series of moves between Canada and the UK, which would shape her early life.\n\nAt the age of 11, Cattrall returned to Liverpool when her grandmother became ill. This brief return to her hometown would prove significant, as she would later take acting examinations at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA).

how his stage name diverted attention away from his true identity, and decided to retire it [38] He opted to use his first and middle names professionally and regards the name change as part of his career growth.\" [39] For his eponymous debut extended play (2009), [40] Lamar eschewed the creative process of his mixtapes in favor of a project heavily focused on his songwriting over \"lovely yet doleful\" production [27] Reeves described the EP as the \"first standout project\" of his career, praising its melancholic tone [27] He felt that the project restored his reputation following the sting of criticism he received over C4 [27]\n\n\n2012–2013: Good Kid, M.A.A.D City\nLamar began planning his second album before Section.80 was released [63] From February to April 2012, he opened for

Drake re-escalated in March 2024 with his surprise appearance on Future and Metro Boomin's track \"Like That\" [255] The song spent three consecutive weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Lamar's third number-one single and his first song to debut at the top spot [256] From April to May, he released the Drake-aimed diss singles \"Euphoria\", [257] \"6:16 in LA\", [258] \"Meet the Grahams\",

marking the first time a rapper has led the performance as a solo act [263] Three days later, he released an untitled song to his Instagram account [264]\n\n\nArtistry\nTupac Shakur is Lamar's biggest influence, having impacted both his professional and personal lives [267] One of his earliest childhood memories is watching him and Dr Dre film the second music video for their single \"California Love\" with his father at the Compton Swap Meet [11] Lamar has described himself as an \"offspring\" of Shakur's artistry and sociopolitical views [268] Although some publications regard him as the

individuality [271]\n\n\nMusical style\nThe nature of Lamar's musical style has been described as \"anti-flamboyant, interior and complex.\" [289] He is rooted in West Coast hip hop, [290] and has continually reinvented his sound by branching out into other genres [291] Due to his contributions to its audience growth, through his appeal to mainstream listeners, music critics generally categorize Lamar as a progressive rap artist [292] He suggests that his music is genreless, explaining in a 2012 interview, \"You really can't categorize my music, it's human music.\" [293] PopDust opined that during the 2010s, a decade that was arguably defined by hip hop, Lamar constantly pushed the boundaries of what the genre could be [294]\n\n\nVoice\nSeveral media outlets consider Lamar to be the greatest and most important rapper of his generation [309] [310] Billboard, Forbes and Vibe named him the second-greatest rapper of all time, behind Jay-Z [311] [312] Described as a \"blazing\" technical rapper and \"relentless searcher\" by The New York Times, [289] Lamar's \"limber, dexterous\" flow switches from derivative to generative metrics, [313] [314] while incorporating internal and multisyllabic rhyme schemes [315] His rhymes are typically manipulated within common time, allowing him to subtly control his metrical phonology and suggest formal ambiguities similar to pop and rock repertoires [315] Some of his rhyme manipulations feature \"flexible\" new school styles evoking the 1990s, while others use \"rigid\" old school elements recalling the 1980s [315] Lamar frequently uses syncopation in his melodies to create contradictions between his lyrical content and rhythms [316] With Good Kid, M.A.A.D City, he liberally plays with pronunciation, inflections, and delivery to mirror the album's emotional range [317]\n\n\nSongwriting\nBranded as a \"master of storytelling\" by The New Yorker, [326] Lamar has been referred to as one of the greatest lyricists in modern hip hop by several publications and his peers [330] [331] Pharrell Williams suggests that what makes his songwriting stand out is because he \"knows how to be very disciplined with a subject matter, he knows that stickiness is important, and he knows that it has to be great.\" [332] American Songwriter notes that for as much as Lamar is a musician, lyricist, and emcee, he is also \"a playwright, a novelist, a short story author He's literary within the art form of music.\" [333] Lamar's reflective narrative songwriting pulls from a wide range of literary and cinematic techniques, such as hip hop skits and voice-overs, to allow his audience to follow internal and external storylines [334] His fusion of various film styles and his sonic influence has elevated his works to be some of the most \"consistently poignant\" in hip hop, and promoted the advancement of the narrative device [334]\n\n\nReception\nAs one of the most influential musicians of the 2010s decade, Lamar has been deemed a paradigm shift in contemporary hip hop and popular culture [358] [359] His discography became a catalyst in the upsurge of social conscience across multiple generations; challenging the status quo by encouraging listeners to reexamine social institutions [360] Throughout the Black Lives Matter movement and events following the 2016 U.S presidential election, his work has been used as protest anthems [361] According to American studies and media scholar William Hoynes, Lamar's progressive elements places him amongst other African American artists and activists who \"worked both inside and outside of the mainstream to advance a counterculture that opposes the racist stereotypes being propagated in white-owned media and culture.\" [362] He has been credited with reviving jazz rap and the music video as a form of social commentary [363] [364]\n\n\nLegacy\nAs one of the most influential musicians of the 2010s decade, Lamar has been deemed a paradigm shift in

journalists have complimented his \"Zen-like\" calmness and down to earth personality [387] [388] According to Lamar, he has become \"so invested in who I am outside of being famous, sometimes that's all I know I've always been a person that really didn't dive too headfirst into wanting and needing attention I mean, we all love attention, but for me, I don't necessarily adore it.\" [389] His

Lamar Duckworth is an American rapper, songwriter, and record producer. Born on June 17, 1987, in Compton, California, he is widely regarded as one of the most influential and critically acclaimed rappers of his generation.\n\nLife and Career\n\nKendrick Lamar Duckworth was born on June 17, 1987, in Compton, California. He is the first child of former gang hustler Kenneth \"Kenny\" Duckworth and hairdresser Paula Oliver. Both of his parents are African Americans from the South Side of Chicago. When they were teenagers, they relocated to Compton in 1984, due to his father's affiliation with the Gangster Disciples. Lamar was named after singer-songwriter Eddie Kendricks of the Temptations. He was an only child until the age of seven and was described as a loner by his mother. Eventually, his parents had his two younger brothers and younger sister, businesswoman Kayla Sawyer (née Duckworth). His cousins include basketball player Nick Young and rapper Baby Keem.\n\nEarly Life\n\nLamar grew up in Compton, where he was exposed to the harsh realities of gang violence and poverty. His father's involvement with the Gangster Disciples led to a tumultuous childhood, with Lamar often witnessing violent altercations and near-death experiences. Despite these challenges, Lamar found solace in music, particularly hip-hop, which became his escape and passion. He began freestyling and rapping at school, where he caught the attention of fellow student Dave Free, who would later become his manager and collaborator.\n\n2003–2008: Career Beginnings\n\nDuring high school, Lamar adopted the stage name K.Dot and began freestyling and battle rapping at school. His performances caught the attention of fellow student Dave Free, who traveled from Inglewood to watch him rap. They quickly formed a friendship over their love of hip hop and the television sitcom Martin.

Free was his hype man during that time, while his older brother was his manager and disc jockey.\n\n2009–2011: Overly Dedicated and Section.80\n\nLamar's third mixtape C4, released on January 30, 2009, is a tribute project to Lil Wayne's Tha Carter III (2008) and was supported by his co-sign.

Reeves described the EP as the \"first standout project\" of his career, praising its melancholic tone. He felt that the project restored his reputation following the sting of criticism he received over C4.\n\n2012–2013: Good Kid, M.A.A.D City\n\nLamar began planning his second album before Section.80 was released. From February to April 2012, he opened for Drake on his Club Paradise Tour. He began working with J Cole on a collaborative album around that time.

His first commercial single, \"The Recipe\" featuring Dr Dre, premiered on rhythmic crossover radio on April 2.\n\n2014–2016: To Pimp a Butterfly and Untitled Unmastered\n\nAfter his opening stint for the Yeezus Tour ended, Lamar started working on his third album. He earned seven nominations at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards (January 2014), including Best New Artist, Best Rap Album, and Album of the Year for Good Kid, M.A.A.D City.

During the awards ceremony, Lamar performed a mashup of \"M.A.A.D City\" and \"Radioactive\" with rock band Imagine Dragons, which was met with critical acclaim.\n\n2017–2019: Damn and Black Panther: The Album\n\nOn March 1, 2017, during a cover story for T, Lamar confirmed that he was working on his fourth album, Damn. He released the promotional single \"The Heart Part 4\" on March 23, before releasing the album's lead single \"Humble\" on March 30. The song debuted at number two on the Hot 100 and reached the top spot in its second week of charting. It is Lamar's second single, and first as a lead artist, to top the chart. Damn was released on April 14. It utilized a more mainstream musical palette than To Pimp a Butterfly, exploring R&B and pop elements. Rolling Stone described its sonics as a \"brilliant combination of the timeless and the modern, the old school and the next-level.\" Damn became Lamar's most commercially successful album. It spent four non-consecutive weeks atop the Billboard 200, marking his third consecutive number-one album, and debuted with 603,000 units sold. All of the album's 14 songs debuted on the Hot 100, including the top-20 singles \"Loyalty\" and \"Love.\" Damn was the seventh best-selling album of 2017, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), while \"Humble\" was the sixth best-selling single of the year. By June 2018, it became the first album by a rapper or solo artist to have every song featured earn a gold certification or higher from the Recording Industry Association of America.\n\n2020–2023: Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers\n\nOn March 5, 2020, Lamar and Dave Free launched the creative entity PGLang, which was described at the time as a multilingual, artist-friendly service company. In October, he signed a worldwide administration agreement with Universal Music Publishing Group. Lamar announced through an August 2021 blog post that he was in the process of producing his final album under TDE, confirming rumors that emerged last year that he would be leaving to focus on PGLang. The following week, he appeared on Baby Keem's single \"Family Ties,\" which won Best Rap Performance at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards. Lamar made additional contributions to Baby Keem's album The Melodic Blue by providing background vocals and appearing on the song \"Range Brothers.\" In November, he held a \"theatrical exhibition of his musical eras\" during his second headlining performance at Day N Vegas. He co-headlined the Super Bowl LVI halftime show alongside Dr Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, 50 Cent, and Mary J Blige on February 13, 2022, which won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Special (Live).\n\n2024–present: Feud with Drake, film projects, and Super Bowl LIX halftime show\n\nLamar's conflict with Drake re-escalated in March 2024 with his surprise appearance on Future and Metro Boomin's track \"Like That.\" The song spent three consecutive weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Lamar's third number-one single and his first song to debut at the top spot. From April to May, he released the Drake-aimed diss singles \"Euphoria,\" \"6:16 in LA,\" \"Meet the Grahams,\" and \"Not Like Us\"; all of which were either positively received or acclaimed by critics. The latter installment marked the first rap song to lead the Hot 100 with a limited tracking week. A celebratory one-off concert, titled The Pop Out: Ken & Friends, was held on Juneteenth. On September 8, 2024, it was announced that Lamar would headline the Super Bowl LIX halftime show, marking the first time a rapper has led the performance as a solo act. Three days later, he released an untitled song to his Instagram account.\n\nArtistry\n\nTupac Shakur is Lamar's biggest influence, having impacted both his professional and personal lives. One of his earliest childhood memories is watching him and Dr Dre film the second music video for their single \"California Love\" with his father at the Compton Swap Meet. Lamar has described himself as an \"offspring\" of Shakur's artistry and sociopolitical views. Although some publications regard him as the Shakur of his generation, he strives to maintain his individuality.\n\nMusical Style\n\nThe nature of Lamar's musical style has been described as \"anti-flamboyant, interior and complex.\" He is rooted in West Coast hip hop and has continually reinvented his sound by branching out into other genres. Due to his contributions to its audience growth, through his appeal to mainstream listeners, music critics generally categorize Lamar as a progressive rap artist. He suggests that his music is genreless, explaining in a 2012 interview, \"You really can't categorize my music, it's human music.\" PopDust opined that during the 2010s, a decade that was arguably defined by hip hop, Lamar constantly pushed the boundaries of what the genre could be.\n\nVoice\n\nSeveral media outlets consider Lamar to be the greatest and most important rapper of his generation. Billboard, Forbes, and Vibe named him the second-greatest rapper of all time, behind Jay-Z. Described as a \"blazing\" technical rapper and \"relentless searcher\" by The New York Times, Lamar's \"limber, dexterous\" flow switches from derivative to generative metrics, while incorporating internal and multisyllabic rhyme schemes. His rhymes are typically manipulated within common time, allowing him to subtly control his metrical phonology and suggest formal ambiguities similar to pop and rock repertoires. Some of his rhyme manipulations feature \"flexible\" new school styles evoking the 1990s, while others use \"rigid\" old school elements recalling the 1980s. Lamar frequently uses syncopation in his melodies to create contradictions between his lyrical content and rhythms. With Good Kid, M.A.A.D City, he liberally plays with pronunciation, inflections, and delivery to mirror the album's emotional range.\n\nSongwriting\n\nBranded as a \"master of storytelling\" by The New Yorker, Lamar has been referred to as one of the greatest lyricists in modern hip hop by several publications and his peers. Pharrell Williams suggests that what makes his songwriting stand out is because he \"knows how to be very disciplined with a subject matter, he knows that stickiness is important, and he knows that it has to be great.\" American Songwriter notes that for as much as Lamar is a musician, lyricist, and emcee, he is also \"a playwright, a novelist, a short story author. He's literary within the art form of music.\" Lamar's reflective narrative songwriting pulls from a wide range of literary and cinematic techniques, such as hip hop skits and voice-overs, to allow his audience to follow internal and external storylines. His fusion of various film styles and his sonic influence has elevated his works to be some of the most \"consistently poignant\" in hip hop, and promoted the advancement of the narrative device.\n\nReception\n\nAs one of the most influential musicians of the 2010s decade, Lamar has been deemed a paradigm shift in contemporary hip hop and popular culture. His discography became a catalyst in the upsurge of social conscience across multiple generations; challenging the status quo by encouraging listeners to reexamine social institutions. Throughout the Black Lives Matter movement and events following the 2016 U.S presidential election, his work has been used as protest anthems. According to American studies and media scholar William Hoynes, Lamar's progressive elements place him amongst other African American artists and activists who \"worked both inside and outside of the mainstream to advance a counterculture that opposes the racist stereotypes being propagated in white-owned media and culture.\" He has been credited with reviving jazz rap and the music video as a form of social commentary.\n\nLegacy\n\nAs one of the most influential musicians of the 2010s decade, Lamar has been deemed a paradigm shift in contemporary hip hop and popular culture.

He is notoriously reserved, reluctant to publicly discuss his personal life and generally avoids using social media. He is also decisive when engaging with mainstream media outlets, although journalists have complimented his \"Zen-like\" calmness and down-to-earth personality. According to Lamar, he has become \"so invested in who I am outside of being famous, sometimes that's all I know. I've always been a person that really didn't dive too headfirst into wanting and needing attention. I mean, we all love attention, but for me, I don't necessarily adore it.\" His lyrics have been a topic of media scrutiny, leading to both praise and controversy.\n\nOther Ventures\n\nLamar has been described as an \"authentic\" businessman who takes \"calculated steps to establish his brand from the ground-up\" and leaves nothing to chance. He approaches traditional album rollouts with an unorthodox method, using creative Easter eggs and leaving cryptic messages. Before releasing a studio album, Lamar shares a promotional single taken from \"The Heart,\" a timestamp song series designed to \"observe the beating pulse behind his music.\" The vulnerable themes explored on the non-album singles have strengthened his relationship with his \"inquisitive\" fanbase known as Kenfolk. His real estate portfolio includes properties in California and New York. In 2011, Lamar crafted an original song with record producer Nosaj Thing to promote Microsoft's Windows Phone. He starred alongside DJ Calvin Harris and singer Ellie Goulding in a marketing campaign for Bacardi in 2014.\n\nEntrepreneurship\n\nLamar has been described as an \"authentic\" businessman who takes \"calculated steps to establish his brand from the ground-up\" and leaves nothing to chance.

In 2012, he commended Frank Ocean for coming out and endorsed Barack Obama's presidential re-election campaign, claiming his opponent Mitt Romney does not have a \"good heart.\" Lamar developed a strong friendship with Obama, having worked on a promotional video for Obama's My Brother's Keeper initiative and performed at his Independence Day celebration at the White House. He was critical of Donald Trump's first presidency and the U.S Supreme Court's landmark decision to overturn Roe v Wade.\n\nAchievements\n\nThroughout his career, Lamar has won 17 Grammy Awards (the third-most by a rapper in history), a Primetime Emmy Award, four American Music Awards, 37 BET Hip Hop Awards (the most won by any artist), 11 MTV Video Music Awards (including two Video of the Year wins), six Billboard Music Awards, and a Brit Award. As a songwriter, he has received nominations for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award. At the 58th Annual Grammy Awards, Lamar received the most Grammy nominations by a rapper in one night, with 11. During the 65th ceremony, he became the first artist from any genre to be nominated for Album of the Year with four consecutive lead studio albums since Billy Joel (1979-1983).\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio Albums:\n\n* Section.80 (2011)\n* Good Kid, M.A.A.D City (2012)\n* To Pimp a Butterfly (2015)\n* DAMN.

Baby Keem [7] [8]\n\n\n2003–2008: Career beginnings\nDuring high school, Lamar adopted the stage name K.Dot and began freestyling and battle rapping at school [1] His performances caught the attention of fellow student Dave Free, who traveled from Inglewood to watch him rap [1] They quickly formed a friendship over their love of hip hop and the television sitcom Martin [1] They recorded music together at Free's makeshift garage studio and at his older brother's Hyde Park apartment [1] Lamar's earliest performances were held at a \"super hood\" comedy club and behind a tattoo parlor [1]

City Threat: Minor of the Year), was released on April 15, 2003, through Konkrete Jungle Musik [27] The mixtapes primarily consisted of freestyles over the production of popular hip hop songs [27]\n\n\n2009–2011: Overly Dedicated and Section.80\nLamar's third mixtape C4, released on January 30, 2009, is a tribute project to Lil Wayne’s Tha Carter III (2008) and was supported by his co-sign [35] Reeves felt that the mixtape was a \"wrongheaded homage to a year-old, well-worn album.\" [27] From February to July, he toured with the Game on his LAX Tour as a hype man for Jay Rock [36] [37]

part of his career growth.\" [39] For his eponymous debut extended play (2009), [40] Lamar eschewed the creative process of his mixtapes in favor of a project heavily focused on his songwriting over \"lovely yet doleful\" production [27] Reeves described the EP as the \"first standout project\" of his career, praising its melancholic tone [27] He felt that the project restored his reputation

The song marks a return to form for Eminem, who had been relatively quiet in the music scene in the preceding years. The song's release was accompanied by a music video, which features a unique blend of magic and hip-hop, and has received significant attention from fans and critics alike.\n\n**Release and Composition**\n\nIn April 2024, Eminem announced his twelfth studio album, The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce), to be released in mid-2024.

The date for the message read May 31, hinting at an upcoming release. On May 28, the rapper posted a joint video call between himself and magician David Blaine, in which the former asked Blaine for help and a magic trick to which the latter responds by drinking a glass of wine and then eating it; Eminem then states that for his \"last trick\", he was going to make his career \"disappear\". The rapper then previews the track by playing a short instrumental snippet. At the end of the clip, the song title and release date are revealed.\n\n**Music Video**\n\nThe music video for \"Houdini\", directed by Rich Lee, who previously directed Eminem's videos for \"Not Afraid\", \"Rap God\", \"The Monster\", \"Phenomenal\", \"Walk on Water\" and \"Venom\", was released alongside the single on May 31, 2024. In the music video, Eminem, dressed as his \"Rap Boy\" persona from \"Without Me\" (The Eminem Show, 2002), and Dr Dre drive around a Gotham City-esque city while tracking down and battling his alter ego Slim Shady, who time traveled through a portal from 2002 to the events of the music video. The music video features cameo appearances from fellow rappers 50 Cent, Snoop Dogg, Royce da 5′9″, Denaun Porter, along with Westside Boogie, Grip, and Ez Mil, signed at the time to Eminem's record label Shady Records, record producer the Alchemist, comedians Shane Gillis and Pete Davidson, adult film actresses Samantha Mack and Ryan Keely, Eminem's manager Paul Rosenberg, Interscope Records co-founder and executive Jimmy Iovine, and Eminem's own children.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe song received a mixed reaction from critics, with some praising its unique blend of magic and hip-hop, while others criticized its lyrics and production. Andrew R Chow of Time stated that the song was \"revolting his critics\", while Stereogum's Tom Breihan was not impressed, writing that it was \"truly amazing\" that Eminem had continued \"to find new ways to get even shittier\". Eddie Fu of Consequence wrote that Eminem \"sounds like ass\" on the track, opined that his customary potshots at celebrities were \"more predictable and boring than shocking and clever\", and stated that his publication \"could also do without his complaining about being 'targeted' by the TikTok backlash\" given that \"leaning into controversy\" had been his strategy throughout his entire career.\n\n**Commercial Performance**\n\n\"Houdini\" debuted at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100 on the chart dated June 15, 2024, with 48.8 million streams and 49,000 copies sold.

{"title": "Japanese_pitch_accent", "content": "\nStandard Japanese\nNormative pitch accent, essentially the pitch accent of the Tokyo Yamanote dialect, is considered essential in jobs such as broadcasting The current standards for pitch accent are presented in special accent dictionaries for native speakers such as the Shin Meikai Nihongo Akusento Jiten (新明解日本語アクセント辞典) and the NHK Nihongo Hatsuon Akusento Jiten (NHK日本語発音アクセント辞典) Newsreaders and other speech professionals are required to follow these standards.\n\n\nScalar pitch\nIn standard Japanese, pitch accent has the following effect on words spoken in isolation:\n\n\nAccent nuclei, defective morae and compound-induced accent shifts\nAn \"accent nucleus\" [3] (アクセント核 akusento kaku) or \"accent locus\" is another name for an accented mora, a mora that carries a high tone and is followed by a mora with a low tone In other words, the precipitous drop in pitch occurs right at the boundary between the accent nucleus and the mora immediately after it Unaccented words (of the heiban type) do not have an accent nucleus.\n\n\nCompoundified compound nouns vs noncompoundified compound nouns\nIn general, Japanese utterances can be syntactically split into discrete phrases (known in the Hashimoto school of grammar as bunsetsu (文節) [5]) For example, the utterance 母が料理をして父が皿を洗います (Haha-ga ryōri-o shite chichi-ga sara-o arai-masu \"My mother cooks and my father washes the dishes\") can be subdivided into the following phrases:\n\n\nBinary pitch\nThe foregoing describes the actual pitch In most guides, however, accent is presented with a two-pitch-level model In this representation, each mora is either high (H) or low (L) in pitch, with the shift from high to low of an accented mora transcribed HꜜL \n\n\nTertiary pitch\nEarlier phonologists made use of a three-tone system, with an additional \"mid\" tone (M) [9] For example, 端 (hashi \"edge\", heiban/unaccented) is considered to have a L-M pattern, while 橋 (hashi \"bridge\", odaka/final-accented) is to have a L-H pattern This contrast is supported by phonetic analyses, which show that the contrast in frequency between the \"low\" and \"high\" tones in, for example, 花 (hana \"flower\", odaka/final-accented), is much starker than the contrast between the \"low\" and \"mid\" tones in 鼻 (hana \"nose\", heiban/unaccented) [3] Moreover, the \"high\" tone in final-accented words is phonetically higher than the \"mid\" tone in unaccented words With respect to potential minimal pairs such as \"edge\" hashi vs \"bridge\" hashi and \"nose\" hana vs \"flower\" hana, the \"mid\" tone, in theory, should be considered phonemic, but it is now largely merged with the \"high\" tone [9] as phonologists claim there are no perceptible differences in pitch pattern between a final-accented word (odaka) without a following particle and an unaccented word (heiban):\n\n\nInitial lowering\nThe tone of the first mora in non-initial-accented (non-atamadaka) words is often underspecified Early versions of the NHK日本語発音アクセント新辞典 (NHK Nihongo Hatsuon Accent Jiten \"NHK Pronouncing Accent Dictionary\") always leave it unmarked This is owing to how what is known as \"initial lowering\" [3] [11] is not universally applied in natural speech, thus making the tone of the first mora indefinite and dependent on the nature of the second mora: [3]\n\n\nDownstep\nMany linguists [who?] analyse Japanese pitch accent somewhat differently In their view, a word either has a downstep or does not If it does, the pitch drops between the accented mora and the subsequent one; if it does not have a downstep, the pitch remains more or less constant throughout the length of the word: That is, the pitch is \"flat\" as Japanese speakers describe it The initial rise in the pitch of the word, and the gradual rise and fall of pitch across a word, arise not from lexical accent, but rather from prosody, which is added to the word by its context: If the first word in a phrase does not have an accent on the first mora, then it starts with a low pitch, which then rises to high over subsequent morae This phrasal prosody is applied to individual words only when they are spoken in isolation Within a phrase, each downstep triggers another drop in pitch, and this accounts for a gradual drop in pitch throughout the phrase This drop is called terracing The next phrase thus starts off near the low end of the speaker's pitch range and needs to reset to high before the next downstep can occur.\n\n\nAccent patterns\nMost of the following patterns are listed in the NHK日本語発音アクセント辞典.\n\n\n連用形\nAccording to the appendix アクセント to the Daijirin, here are the patterns for the 連用形 of monograde verbs without a trailing particle or auxiliary:\n\n\nNouns derived from other parts of speech\nThe accent of nouns derived from verbs is generally based on the accent of the dictionary forms of those verbs If the dictionary form is accentless, the derived noun is also accentless:\n\n\nNouns derived from single verbs\nThe accent of nouns derived from verbs is generally based on the accent of the dictionary forms of those verbs If the dictionary form is accentless, the derived noun is also accentless:\n\n\nNouns derived from compound verbs\nNouns derived from compound verbs tend to be accentless:\n\n\n-sa nouns derived from adjectives\n-sa forms derived from accentless dictionary forms of adjectives tend to also be accentless:\n\n\n-mi nouns derived from adjectives\n-mi forms derived from accentless dictionary forms of adjectives tend to also be accentless:\n\n\n-ke/ge nouns\n-ke/ge forms derived from accentless dictionary forms of adjectives, nouns and verbs tend to also be accentless:\n\n\nNominal affixes\nCertain highly productive affixes, often of Sino-Japanese origin, often result in compound nouns with predictable accent patterns.\n\n\nPrefixes\nProductive Sino-Japanese prefixes such as 以（い）、各（かく）、貴（き）、現（げん）、故（こ）、今（こん）、諸（しょ）、先（せん）、前（ぜん）、尊（そん）、当（とう）、同（どう）、某（ぼう）、本（ほん）、両（りょう） often result in atamadaka compounds: しょꜜけい（諸兄）、かꜜくじん（各人）、とꜜうしゃ（当社）、どꜜうこう（同校）、ぼꜜうじょ（某女）、ぼꜜうじつ（某日）.\n\n\nShort suffixes\nFor many native and Sino-Japanese suffixes, the accent falls on the last 自立拍 of the nouns before them This means that if the last mora is a 特殊拍, the accent must shift backward until it reaches a 自立拍 (see #Accent nuclei, defective morae and compound-induced accent shifts above).\n\n\nLong suffixes\nFor native suffixes derived from free words with more than 2 morae, or native and Sino-Japanese suffixes derived from free words with 2 morphemes (often spelt with 2 kanji), if the original free words are accentless, odaka or atamadaka, the first mora of the derived suffixes is often accented:\n\n\nProper name suffixes\nSome common proper name suffixes, such as 様（さま）、さん、ちゃん、殿（どの）、君（くん）, do not affect the names they suffix:\n\n\nParticle-like suffixes\nSome suffixes notably affect accentless and accented nouns differently, like a trailing particle:\n\n\nTrailing particles and auxiliaries\nThe lexical accents of words as shown in dictionaries may be modified if there is a trailing particle or auxiliary.\n\n\nNoun+particle\nThe particles are categorized in four groups based on how they modify the accent of the nouns the follow.\n\n\nNoun ending in 特殊拍+の\nThe table above shows that the particle の does not affect certain nakadaka nouns However, if a nakadaka noun ends in a special mora (特殊拍, see #Accent nuclei, defective morae and compound-induced accent shifts above), の deaccents it just like it does an odaka noun.\n\n\nNominal odaka exception+の\nCertain odaka words, including ancient place names, are not deaccented by の.\n\n\nNoun+の+noun fixed phrases\nAs noted above, the particle の can remove accent from odaka nouns, and nakadaka nouns ending in a 特殊拍, resulting in a accentless phrase Once the resulting noun+の phrase becomes accentless, when it is followed by another noun to form a fixed phrase, the second noun's accent often takes precedence:\n\n\nNoun with devoiced accentless mora followed by accented mora+の\nIf the accented mora of a odaka noun, or a noun ending in a special mora (特殊拍) as mentioned above, is preceded by a devoiced mora (voiceless consonant + i or u + voiceless consonant), and that noun may not be deaccented by の.\n\n\nNoun+auxiliary\nAuxiliaries can be categorized into four groups:\n\n\nAttributive phrase+noun+particle/auxiliary\nWhen certain accentless nouns (accentless), such as 日（ひ）, 上（うえ）, 下（した）, 家（うち）, 人（ひと）, 所（ところ）, etc are attributively modified by another accentless or odaka word and simultaneously followed by a particle or an auxiliary, the accent of the entire phrase may fall on the last mora of such nouns Some examples include:\n\n\nAdverbial+particle/auxiliary\nWhen an accentless adverbial (accentless) is followed by a particle or an auxiliary, the accent falls on the last mora of that adverbial (even if that adverbial already contains a particle to begin with).\n\n\nVerbal 連用形+particle\nFour groups of particles that can follow the 連用形 of verbs:\n\n\nVerbal dictionary form+particle\nFive groups of particles that can follow the dictionary forms of verbs:\n\n\nVerbal 仮定形+particle\nGroup O consists of ど、ば、ども When these particles follow the 仮定形 of a accentless verb, the last mora of such form is accented:\n\n\nVerbal 命令形+particle\nFor the spoken 命令形 of verbs with accentless accent, the last mora is accented:\n\n\nVerbal dictionary form+auxiliary\nThree groups of auxiliaries that can trail dictionary forms of verbs:\n\n\nVerbal 未然形+auxiliary\nThree groups of auxiliaries that can trail 未然形 of verbs:\n\n\nVerbal 連用形+auxiliary\nThree groups of auxiliaries that can trail 連用形 of verbs:\n\n\nAdjectival dictionary form+particle\nFive groups of particles that can trail dictionary forms of adjectives:\n\n\nAdjectival 連用形+particle\nThe -ku 連用形 of accentless adjectives are also accentless:\n\n\nAdjectival 仮定形+particle\nGroup W consists of the following particles: ば、ど、ども.\n\n\nAdjectival dictionary form+auxiliary\nFour groups of auxiliaries that can trail dictionary forms of adjectives:\n\n\nAdjectival 未然形+auxiliary\nThe only member of Group r is う, and it uniquely combines with the -karo forms of adjectives The mora ro in -karo is accented:\n\n\nParticle/auxiliary+particle\nWhen a particle or auxiliary follows a phrase that ends in another particle, if that phrase has accentless accent, its last mora is accented:\n\n\nList of particles and auxiliaries\nThe following list for Tokyo accent is not shown in the NHK日本語発音アクセント辞典, but slightly reworked from papers by Shiro Kori [13] [12] A few patterns for missing particles and auxiliaries are inferred from the appendix アクセント to the Daijirin.\n\n\nTrailing 補助動詞\nLike 助動詞 (\"auxiliaries\"), 補助動詞 also modify the accent of the verbs they trail According to the Daijirin and Kori (2020): [12]\n\n\nする and 来る\nThe NHK日本語発音アクセント辞典, the Daijirin and Shiro Kori do not explicitly describe the two irregular verbs する and 来る (the NHK dictionary only describes derived ～ずる verbs) The following are patterns for these two verbs which, respectively, are similar to those of accentless monograde verbs and accented monograde verbs (the aforementioned monograde verbs 居る and 射る, and 感ずる, are mentioned here again for comparison).\n\n\nNumerals\nThe following table lists some compounds of numerals and their accent.\n\n\nNumeral+counter\nCompounds formed from one or more numerals and a counter often obey certain rules Counters can be categorized into five groups, and multiple subgroups, depending on the resulting accent:\n\n\nExamples of words that differ only in pitch\nIn standard Japanese, about 47% of words are unaccented and around 26% are accented on the ante-penultimate mora However, this distribution is highly variable between word categories For example, 70% of native nouns are unaccented, while only 50% of kango and only 7% of loanwords are unaccented In general, most 1–2 mora words are accented on the first mora, 3–4 mora words are unaccented, and words of greater length are almost always accented on one of the last five morae [3]\n\n\nOther dialects\nAccent and tone are the most variable aspect of Japanese dialects Some have no accent at all; of those that do, it may occur in addition to a high or low word tone [21]\n\n\nKyushu (two-pattern type)\nIn western and southern Kyushu dialects (pink area on the map on the right), a high tone falls on a predictable syllable, depending only on whether the noun has an accent This is termed a two-pattern (nikei) system, as there are two possibilities, accented and not accented For instance, in the Kagoshima dialect unaccented nouns have a low tone until the final syllable, at which point the pitch rises In accented nouns, however, the penultimate syllable of a phonological word has a high tone, which drops on the final syllable (Kagoshima phonology is based on syllables, not on morae.) For example, irogami 'colored paper' is unaccented in Kagoshima, while kagaribi 'bonfire' is accented The ultimate or penultimate high tone will shift when any unaccented grammatical particle is added, such as nominative -ga or ablative -kara: \n\n\nNo accent versus one-pattern type\nIn Miyakonojō, Miyazaki (small black area on map), there is a single accent: all phonological words have a low tone until the final syllable, at which point the pitch rises That is, every word has the pitch pattern of Kagoshima irogami This is called an ikkei (one-pattern) accent Phonologically, it is the same as the absence of an accent (white areas on map), and is sometimes counted as such, as there can be no contrast between words based on accent However, speakers of ikkei-type dialects feel that they are accenting a particular syllable, whereas speakers of unaccented dialects have no such intuition.\n\n\nKeihan (Kyoto–Osaka type)\nNear the old capital of Kyoto, in Kansai, Shikoku, and parts of Hokuriku (the easternmost Western Japanese dialects), there is a more innovative system, structurally similar to a combination of these patterns There are both high and low initial tone as well as the possibility of an accented mora That is, unaccented nouns may have either a high or a low tone, and accented words have pitch accent in addition to this word tone This system will be illustrated with the Kansai dialect of Osaka.\n\n\nCorrespondences between dialects\nThere are regular correspondences between Tokyo-type and Keihan-type accents The downstep on high-tone words in conservative Keihan accents generally occurs one syllable earlier than in the older Tokyo-type accent For example, kokoro 'heart' is /kokoꜜro/ in Tokyo but /koꜜkoro/ in Osaka; kotoba 'word' is /kotobaꜜ/ in Tokyo but /kotoꜜba/ in Osaka; kawa 'river' is /kawaꜜ/ in Tokyo but /kaꜜwa/ in Osaka If a word is unaccented and high-tone in Keihan dialects, it is also unaccented in Tokyo-type dialects If a two-mora word has a low tone in Keihan dialects, it has a downstep on the first mora in Tokyo-type dialects.\n\n\nSyllabic and moraic\nJapanese pitch accent also varies in how it interacts with syllables and morae Kagoshima is a purely syllabic dialect, while Osaka is moraic For example, the low-tone unaccented noun shinbun 'newspaper' is  [ɕìm̀bɯ́ɴ́] in Kagoshima, with the high tone spread across the entire final syllable bun, but in Osaka it is  [ɕìm̀bɯ̀ɴ́], with the high tone restricted to the final mora n In Tokyo, accent placement is constrained by the syllable, though the downstep occurs between the morae of that syllable That is, a stressed syllable in Tokyo dialect, as in 貝 kai 'shell' or 算 san 'divining rod', will always have the pattern /kaꜜi/  [káì], /saꜜɴ/  [sáɴ̀], never */kaiꜜ/, */saɴꜜ/ [25] In Osaka, however, either pattern may occur: tonbi 'black kite' is  [tóm̀bì] in Tokyo but  [tòḿbì] in Osaka.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Japanese Pitch Accent\n\nJapanese pitch accent is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that plays a crucial role in the language's phonology and prosody.

In this article, we will delve into the various aspects of Japanese pitch accent, exploring its history, types, and applications.\n\n# Standard Japanese\n\nStandard Japanese, also known as the Tokyo Yamanote dialect, is considered the normative pitch accent of the Japanese language. It is the basis for the pitch accent used in formal and official contexts, such as broadcasting and education.

The standards for pitch accent are complex and nuanced, involving the use of high and low tones, as well as the placement of accent nuclei, defective morae, and compound-induced accent shifts.\n\n## Accent Nuclei, Defective Morae, and Compound-Induced Accent Shifts\n\nAn \"accent nucleus\" (アクセント核 akusento kaku) or \"accent locus\" is another name for an accented mora, a mora that carries a high tone and is followed by a mora with a low tone.

If the dictionary form is accentless, the derived noun is also accentless.\n\n## Nouns Derived from Compound Verbs\n\nNouns derived from compound verbs tend to be accentless.\n\n## -sa Nouns Derived from Adjectives\n\n-sa forms derived from accentless dictionary forms of adjectives tend to also be accentless.\n\n## -mi Nouns Derived from Adjectives\n\n-mi forms derived from accentless dictionary forms of adjectives tend to also be accentless.\n\n## -ke/ge Nouns\n\n-ke/ge forms derived from accentless dictionary forms of adjectives, nouns, and verbs tend to also be accentless.\n\n# Initial Lowering\n\nThe tone of the first mora in non-initial-accented (non-atamadaka) words is often underspecified. Early versions of the NHK日本語発音アクセント新辞典 (NHK Nihongo Hatsuon Accent Jiten \"NHK Pronouncing Accent Dictionary\") always leave it unmarked.\n\n# Downstep\n\nMany linguists analyze Japanese pitch accent somewhat differently. In their view, a word either has a downstep or does not. If it does, the pitch drops between the accented mora and the subsequent one; if it does not have a downstep, the pitch remains more or less constant throughout the length of the word.\n\n# Accent Shifts\n\nAccent shifts occur when a word is followed by a particle or auxiliary. The accent of the particle or auxiliary can modify the accent of the word.\n\n## Noun+Particle\n\nThe particles are categorized in four groups based on how they modify the accent of the nouns they follow.\n\n## Noun Ending in 特殊拍+の\n\nThe table above shows that the particle の does not affect certain nakadaka nouns. However, if a nakadaka noun ends in a special mora (特殊拍), の deaccents it just like it does an odaka noun.\n\n## Nominal Odaka Exception+の\n\nCertain odaka words, including ancient place names, are not deaccented by の.\n\n## Noun+の+noun Fixed Phrases\n\nAs noted above, the particle の can remove accent from odaka nouns, and nakadaka nouns ending in a 特殊拍, resulting in a accentless phrase. Once the resulting noun+の phrase becomes accentless, when it is followed by another noun to form a fixed phrase, the second noun's accent often takes precedence.\n\n## Noun with Devoiced Accentless Mora Followed by Accented Mora+の\n\nIf the accented mora of a odaka noun, or a noun ending in a special mora (特殊拍) as mentioned above, is preceded by a devoiced mora (voiceless consonant + i or u + voiceless consonant), and that noun may not be deaccented by の.\n\n## Noun+Auxiliary\n\nAuxiliaries can be categorized into four groups.\n\n## Attributive Phrase+Noun+Particle/Auxiliary\n\nWhen certain accentless nouns (accentless), such as 日（ひ）, 上（うえ）, 下（した）, 家（うち）, 人（ひと）, 所（ところ）, etc are attributively modified by another accentless or odaka word and simultaneously followed by a particle or an auxiliary, the accent of the entire phrase may fall on the last mora of such nouns.\n\n## Adverbial+Particle/Auxiliary\n\nWhen an accentless adverbial (accentless) is followed by a particle or auxiliary, the accent falls on the last mora of that adverbial (even if that adverbial already contains a particle to begin with).\n\n## Verbal 連用形+Particle\n\nFour groups of particles that can follow the 連用形 of verbs.\n\n## Verbal Dictionary Form+Particle\n\nFive groups of particles that can follow the dictionary forms of verbs.\n\n## Verbal 仮定形+Particle\n\nGroup O consists of ど、ば、ども. When these particles follow the 仮定形 of a accentless verb, the last mora of such form is accented.\n\n## Verbal 命令形+Particle\n\nFor the spoken 命令形 of verbs with accentless accent, the last mora is accented.\n\n## Verbal Dictionary Form+Auxiliary\n\nThree groups of auxiliaries that can trail dictionary forms of verbs.\n\n## Verbal 未然形+Auxiliary\n\nThree groups of auxiliaries that can trail 未然形 of verbs.\n\n## Verbal 連用形+Auxiliary\n\nThree groups of auxiliaries that can trail 連用形 of verbs.\n\n## Adjectival Dictionary Form+Particle\n\nFive groups of particles that can trail dictionary forms of adjectives.\n\n## Adjectival 連用形+Particle\n\nThe -ku 連用形 of accentless adjectives are also accentless.\n\n## Adjectival 仮定形+Particle\n\nGroup W consists of the following particles: ば、ど、ども.\n\n## Adjectival Dictionary Form+Auxiliary\n\nFour groups of auxiliaries that can trail dictionary forms of adjectives.\n\n## Adjectival 未然形+Auxiliary\n\nThe only member of Group r is う, and it uniquely combines with the -karo forms of adjectives. The mora ro in -karo is accented.\n\n## Particle/Auxiliary+Particle\n\nWhen a particle or auxiliary follows a phrase that ends in another particle, if that phrase has accentless accent, its last mora is accented.\n\n# List of Particles and Auxiliaries\n\nThe following list for Tokyo accent is not shown in the NHK日本語発音アクセント辞典, but slightly reworked from papers by Shiro Kori. A few patterns for missing particles and auxiliaries are inferred from the appendix アクセント to the Daijirin.\n\n## Trailing 補助動詞\n\nLike 助動詞 (\"auxiliaries\"), 補助動詞 also modify the accent of the verbs they trail. According to the Daijirin and Kori (2020):\n\n## する and 来る\n\nThe NHK日本語発音アクセント辞典, the Daijirin, and Shiro Kori do not explicitly describe the two irregular verbs する and 来る. The following are patterns for these two verbs, which, respectively, are similar to those of accentless monograde verbs and accented monograde verbs.\n\n# Numerals\n\nThe following table lists some compounds of numerals and their accent.\n\n## Numeral+Counter\n\nCompounds formed from one or more numerals and a counter often obey certain rules. Counters can be categorized into five groups, and multiple subgroups, depending on the resulting accent.\n\n# Other Dialects\n\nAccent and tone are the most variable aspect of Japanese dialects. Some have no accent at all; of those that do, it may occur in addition to a high or low word tone.\n\n## Kyushu (Two-Pattern Type)\n\nIn western and southern Kyushu dialects (pink area on the map on the right), a high tone falls on a predictable syllable, depending only on whether the noun has an accent. This is termed a two-pattern (nikei) system, as there are two possibilities, accented and not accented. For instance, in the Kagoshima dialect unaccented nouns have a low tone until the final syllable, at which point the pitch rises. In accented nouns, however, the penultimate syllable of a phonological word has a high tone, which drops on the final syllable.\n\n## No Accent versus One-Pattern Type\n\nIn Miyakonojō, Miyazaki (small black area on map), there is a single accent: all phonological words have a low tone until the final syllable, at which point the pitch rises. That is, every word has the pitch pattern of Kagoshima irogami. This is called an ikkei (one-pattern) accent.\n\n## Keihan (Kyoto–Osaka Type)\n\nNear the old capital of Kyoto, in Kansai, Shikoku, and parts of Hokuriku (the easternmost Western Japanese dialects), there is a more innovative system, structurally similar to a combination of these patterns. There are both high and low initial tone as well as the possibility of an accented mora.\n\n## Correspondences between Dialects\n\nThere are regular correspondences between Tokyo-type and Keihan-type accents. The downstep on high-tone words in conservative Keihan accents generally occurs one syllable earlier than in the older Tokyo-type accent.\n\n## Syllabic and Moraic\n\nJapanese pitch accent also varies in how it interacts with syllables and morae. Kagoshima is a purely syllabic dialect, while Osaka is moraic. For example, the low-tone unaccented noun shinbun 'newspaper' is  [ɕìm̀bɯ́ɴ́] in Kagoshima, with the high tone spread across the entire final syllable bun, but in Osaka it is  [ɕìm̀bɯ̀ɴ́], with the high tone restricted to the final mora n.\n\nNote: This article is a comprehensive overview of Japanese pitch accent, covering its various aspects, including standard Japanese, scalar pitch, accent patterns, initial lowering, downstep, accent shift, and other dialects. However, it is essential to note that the topic is complex, and this article is not exhaustive. Further research and study are necessary to fully understand the intricacies of Japanese pitch accent.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Japanese_pitch_accent\" following this outline:\n\n\nStandard Japanese\nNormative pitch accent, essentially the pitch accent of the Tokyo Yamanote dialect, is considered essential in jobs such as broadcasting The current standards for pitch accent are presented in special accent dictionaries for native speakers such as the Shin Meikai Nihongo Akusento Jiten (新明解日本語アクセント辞典) and the NHK Nihongo Hatsuon Akusento Jiten (NHK日本語発音アクセント辞典) Newsreaders and other speech professionals are required to follow these standards.\n\n\nScalar pitch\nIn standard Japanese, pitch accent has the following effect on words spoken in isolation:\n\n\nAccent nuclei, defective morae and compound-induced accent shifts\nAn \"accent nucleus\" [3] (アクセント核 akusento kaku) or \"accent locus\" is another name for an accented mora, a mora that carries a high tone and is followed by a mora with a low tone In other words, the precipitous drop in pitch occurs right at the boundary between the accent nucleus and the mora immediately after it Unaccented words (of the heiban type) do not have an accent nucleus.\n\n\nCompoundified compound nouns vs noncompoundified compound nouns\nIn general, Japanese utterances can be syntactically split into discrete phrases (known in the Hashimoto school of grammar as bunsetsu (文節) [5]) For example, the utterance 母が料理をして父が皿を洗います (Haha-ga ryōri-o shite chichi-ga sara-o arai-masu \"My mother cooks and my father washes the dishes\") can be subdivided into the following phrases:\n\n\nBinary pitch\nThe foregoing describes the actual pitch In most guides, however, accent is presented with a two-pitch-level model In this representation, each mora is either high (H) or low (L) in pitch, with the shift from high to low of an accented mora transcribed HꜜL \n\n\nTertiary pitch\nEarlier phonologists made use of a three-tone system, with an additional \"mid\" tone (M) [9] For example, 端 (hashi \"edge\", heiban/unaccented) is considered to have a L-M pattern, while 橋 (hashi \"bridge\", odaka/final-accented) is to have a L-H pattern This contrast is supported by phonetic analyses, which show that the contrast in frequency between the \"low\" and \"high\" tones in, for example, 花 (hana \"flower\", odaka/final-accented), is much starker than the contrast between the \"low\" and \"mid\" tones in 鼻 (hana \"nose\", heiban/unaccented) [3] Moreover, the \"high\" tone in final-accented words is phonetically higher than the \"mid\" tone in unaccented words With respect to potential minimal pairs such as \"edge\" hashi vs \"bridge\" hashi and \"nose\" hana vs \"flower\" hana, the \"mid\" tone, in theory, should be considered phonemic, but it is now largely merged with the \"high\" tone [9] as phonologists claim there are no perceptible differences in pitch pattern between a final-accented word (odaka) without a following particle and an unaccented word (heiban):\n\n\nInitial lowering\nThe tone of the first mora in non-initial-accented (non-atamadaka) words is often underspecified Early versions of the NHK日本語発音アクセント新辞典 (NHK Nihongo Hatsuon Accent Jiten \"NHK Pronouncing Accent Dictionary\") always leave it unmarked This is owing to how what is known as \"initial lowering\" [3] [11] is not universally applied in natural speech, thus making the tone of the first mora indefinite and dependent on the nature of the second mora: [3]\n\n\nDownstep\nMany linguists [who?] analyse Japanese pitch accent somewhat differently In their view, a word either has a downstep or does not If it does, the pitch drops between the accented mora and the subsequent one; if it does not have a downstep, the pitch remains more or less constant throughout the length of the word: That is, the pitch is \"flat\" as Japanese speakers describe it The initial rise in the pitch of the word, and the gradual rise and fall of pitch across a word, arise not from lexical accent, but rather from prosody, which is added to the word by its context: If the first word in a phrase does not have an accent on the first mora, then it starts with a low pitch, which then rises to high over subsequent morae This phrasal prosody is applied to individual words only when they are spoken in isolation Within a phrase, each downstep triggers another drop in pitch, and this accounts for a gradual drop in pitch throughout the phrase This drop is called terracing The next phrase thus starts off near the low end of the speaker's pitch range and needs to reset to high before the next downstep can occur.\n\n\nAccent patterns\nMost of the following patterns are listed in the NHK日本語発音アクセント辞典.\n\n\n連用形\nAccording to the appendix アクセント to the Daijirin, here are the patterns for the 連用形 of monograde verbs without a trailing particle or auxiliary:\n\n\nNouns derived from other parts of speech\nThe accent of nouns derived from verbs is generally based on the accent of the dictionary forms of those verbs If the dictionary form is accentless, the derived noun is also accentless:\n\n\nNouns derived from single verbs\nThe accent of nouns derived from verbs is generally based on the accent of the dictionary forms of those verbs If the dictionary form is accentless, the derived noun is also accentless:\n\n\nNouns derived from compound verbs\nNouns derived from compound verbs tend to be accentless:\n\n\n-sa nouns derived from adjectives\n-sa forms derived from accentless dictionary forms of adjectives tend to also be accentless:\n\n\n-mi nouns derived from adjectives\n-mi forms derived from accentless dictionary forms of adjectives tend to also be accentless:\n\n\n-ke/ge nouns\n-ke/ge forms derived from accentless dictionary forms of adjectives, nouns and verbs tend to also be accentless:\n\n\nNominal affixes\nCertain highly productive affixes, often of Sino-Japanese origin, often result in compound nouns with predictable accent patterns.\n\n\nPrefixes\nProductive Sino-Japanese prefixes such as 以（い）、各（かく）、貴（き）、現（げん）、故（こ）、今（こん）、諸（しょ）、先（せん）、前（ぜん）、尊（そん）、当（とう）、同（どう）、某（ぼう）、本（ほん）、両（りょう） often result in atamadaka compounds: しょꜜけい（諸兄）、かꜜくじん（各人）、とꜜうしゃ（当社）、どꜜうこう（同校）、ぼꜜうじょ（某女）、ぼꜜうじつ（某日）.\n\n\nShort suffixes\nFor many native and Sino-Japanese suffixes, the accent falls on the last 自立拍 of the nouns before them This means that if the last mora is a 特殊拍, the accent must shift backward until it reaches a 自立拍 (see #Accent nuclei, defective morae and compound-induced accent shifts above).\n\n\nLong suffixes\nFor native suffixes derived from free words with more than 2 morae, or native and Sino-Japanese suffixes derived from free words with 2 morphemes (often spelt with 2 kanji), if the original free words are accentless, odaka or atamadaka, the first mora of the derived suffixes is often accented:\n\n\nProper name suffixes\nSome common proper name suffixes, such as 様（さま）、さん、ちゃん、殿（どの）、君（くん）, do not affect the names they suffix:\n\n\nParticle-like suffixes\nSome suffixes notably affect accentless and accented nouns differently, like a trailing particle:\n\n\nTrailing particles and auxiliaries\nThe lexical accents of words as shown in dictionaries may be modified if there is a trailing particle or auxiliary.\n\n\nNoun+particle\nThe particles are categorized in four groups based on how they modify the accent of the nouns the follow.\n\n\nNoun ending in 特殊拍+の\nThe table above shows that the particle の does not affect certain nakadaka nouns However, if a nakadaka noun ends in a special mora (特殊拍, see #Accent nuclei, defective morae and compound-induced accent shifts above), の deaccents it just like it does an odaka noun.\n\n\nNominal odaka exception+の\nCertain odaka words, including ancient place names, are not deaccented by の.\n\n\nNoun+の+noun fixed phrases\nAs noted above, the particle の can remove accent from odaka nouns, and nakadaka nouns ending in a 特殊拍, resulting in a accentless phrase Once the resulting noun+の phrase becomes accentless, when it is followed by another noun to form a fixed phrase, the second noun's accent often takes precedence:\n\n\nNoun with devoiced accentless mora followed by accented mora+の\nIf the accented mora of a odaka noun, or a noun ending in a special mora (特殊拍) as mentioned above, is preceded by a devoiced mora (voiceless consonant + i or u + voiceless consonant), and that noun may not be deaccented by の.\n\n\nNoun+auxiliary\nAuxiliaries can be categorized into four groups:\n\n\nAttributive phrase+noun+particle/auxiliary\nWhen certain accentless nouns (accentless), such as 日（ひ）, 上（うえ）, 下（した）, 家（うち）, 人（ひと）, 所（ところ）, etc are attributively modified by another accentless or odaka word and simultaneously followed by a particle or an auxiliary, the accent of the entire phrase may fall on the last mora of such nouns Some examples include:\n\n\nAdverbial+particle/auxiliary\nWhen an accentless adverbial (accentless) is followed by a particle or an auxiliary, the accent falls on the last mora of that adverbial (even if that adverbial already contains a particle to begin with).\n\n\nVerbal 連用形+particle\nFour groups of particles that can follow the 連用形 of verbs:\n\n\nVerbal dictionary form+particle\nFive groups of particles that can follow the dictionary forms of verbs:\n\n\nVerbal 仮定形+particle\nGroup O consists of ど、ば、ども When these particles follow the 仮定形 of a accentless verb, the last mora of such form is accented:\n\n\nVerbal 命令形+particle\nFor the spoken 命令形 of verbs with accentless accent, the last mora is accented:\n\n\nVerbal dictionary form+auxiliary\nThree groups of auxiliaries that can trail dictionary forms of verbs:\n\n\nVerbal 未然形+auxiliary\nThree groups of auxiliaries that can trail 未然形 of verbs:\n\n\nVerbal 連用形+auxiliary\nThree groups of auxiliaries that can trail 連用形 of verbs:\n\n\nAdjectival dictionary form+particle\nFive groups of particles that can trail dictionary forms of adjectives:\n\n\nAdjectival 連用形+particle\nThe -ku 連用形 of accentless adjectives are also accentless:\n\n\nAdjectival 仮定形+particle\nGroup W consists of the following particles: ば、ど、ども.\n\n\nAdjectival dictionary form+auxiliary\nFour groups of auxiliaries that can trail dictionary forms of adjectives:\n\n\nAdjectival 未然形+auxiliary\nThe only member of Group r is う, and it uniquely combines with the -karo forms of adjectives The mora ro in -karo is accented:\n\n\nParticle/auxiliary+particle\nWhen a particle or auxiliary follows a phrase that ends in another particle, if that phrase has accentless accent, its last mora is accented:\n\n\nList of particles and auxiliaries\nThe following list for Tokyo accent is not shown in the NHK日本語発音アクセント辞典, but slightly reworked from papers by Shiro Kori [13] [12] A few patterns for missing particles and auxiliaries are inferred from the appendix アクセント to the Daijirin.\n\n\nTrailing 補助動詞\nLike 助動詞 (\"auxiliaries\"), 補助動詞 also modify the accent of the verbs they trail According to the Daijirin and Kori (2020): [12]\n\n\nする and 来る\nThe NHK日本語発音アクセント辞典, the Daijirin and Shiro Kori do not explicitly describe the two irregular verbs する and 来る (the NHK dictionary only describes derived ～ずる verbs) The following are patterns for these two verbs which, respectively, are similar to those of accentless monograde verbs and accented monograde verbs (the aforementioned monograde verbs 居る and 射る, and 感ずる, are mentioned here again for comparison).\n\n\nNumerals\nThe following table lists some compounds of numerals and their accent.\n\n\nNumeral+counter\nCompounds formed from one or more numerals and a counter often obey certain rules Counters can be categorized into five groups, and multiple subgroups, depending on the resulting accent:\n\n\nExamples of words that differ only in pitch\nIn standard Japanese, about 47% of words are unaccented and around 26% are accented on the ante-penultimate mora However, this distribution is highly variable between word categories For example, 70% of native nouns are unaccented, while only 50% of kango and only 7% of loanwords are unaccented In general, most 1–2 mora words are accented on the first mora, 3–4 mora words are unaccented, and words of greater length are almost always accented on one of the last five morae [3]\n\n\nOther dialects\nAccent and tone are the most variable aspect of Japanese dialects Some have no accent at all; of those that do, it may occur in addition to a high or low word tone [21]\n\n\nKyushu (two-pattern type)\nIn western and southern Kyushu dialects (pink area on the map on the right), a high tone falls on a predictable syllable, depending only on whether the noun has an accent This is termed a two-pattern (nikei) system, as there are two possibilities, accented and not accented For instance, in the Kagoshima dialect unaccented nouns have a low tone until the final syllable, at which point the pitch rises In accented nouns, however, the penultimate syllable of a phonological word has a high tone, which drops on the final syllable (Kagoshima phonology is based on syllables, not on morae.) For example, irogami 'colored paper' is unaccented in Kagoshima, while kagaribi 'bonfire' is accented The ultimate or penultimate high tone will shift when any unaccented grammatical particle is added, such as nominative -ga or ablative -kara: \n\n\nNo accent versus one-pattern type\nIn Miyakonojō, Miyazaki (small black area on map), there is a single accent: all phonological words have a low tone until the final syllable, at which point the pitch rises That is, every word has the pitch pattern of Kagoshima irogami This is called an ikkei (one-pattern) accent Phonologically, it is the same as the absence of an accent (white areas on map), and is sometimes counted as such, as there can be no contrast between words based on accent However, speakers of ikkei-type dialects feel that they are accenting a particular syllable, whereas speakers of unaccented dialects have no such intuition.\n\n\nKeihan (Kyoto–Osaka type)\nNear the old capital of Kyoto, in Kansai, Shikoku, and parts of Hokuriku (the easternmost Western Japanese dialects), there is a more innovative system, structurally similar to a combination of these patterns There are both high and low initial tone as well as the possibility of an accented mora That is, unaccented nouns may have either a high or a low tone, and accented words have pitch accent in addition to this word tone This system will be illustrated with the Kansai dialect of Osaka.\n\n\nCorrespondences between dialects\nThere are regular correspondences between Tokyo-type and Keihan-type accents The downstep on high-tone words in conservative Keihan accents generally occurs one syllable earlier than in the older Tokyo-type accent For example, kokoro 'heart' is /kokoꜜro/ in Tokyo but /koꜜkoro/ in Osaka; kotoba 'word' is /kotobaꜜ/ in Tokyo but /kotoꜜba/ in Osaka; kawa 'river' is /kawaꜜ/ in Tokyo but /kaꜜwa/ in Osaka If a word is unaccented and high-tone in Keihan dialects, it is also unaccented in Tokyo-type dialects If a two-mora word has a low tone in Keihan dialects, it has a downstep on the first mora in Tokyo-type dialects.\n\n\nSyllabic and moraic\nJapanese pitch accent also varies in how it interacts with syllables and morae Kagoshima is a purely syllabic dialect, while Osaka is moraic For example, the low-tone unaccented noun shinbun 'newspaper' is  [ɕìm̀bɯ́ɴ́] in Kagoshima, with the high tone spread across the entire final syllable bun, but in Osaka it is  [ɕìm̀bɯ̀ɴ́], with the high tone restricted to the final mora n In Tokyo, accent placement is constrained by the syllable, though the downstep occurs between the morae of that syllable That is, a stressed syllable in Tokyo dialect, as in 貝 kai 'shell' or 算 san 'divining rod', will always have the pattern /kaꜜi/  [káì], /saꜜɴ/  [sáɴ̀], never */kaiꜜ/, */saɴꜜ/ [25] In Osaka, however, either pattern may occur: tonbi 'black kite' is  [tóm̀bì] in Tokyo but  [tòḿbì] in Osaka.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film was released independently and has gained significant attention and controversy due to its claims of widespread voter fraud. This article provides an overview of the film's content and methodology, its reception, and the subsequent response from critics and the public.\n\n**Content and Methodology**\n\nThe film opens with a misleadingly edited clip from October 2020 of then-presidential candidate Joe Biden responding to a podcaster's question about boosting his election turnout. After replying, \"Republicans are doing everything they can to make it harder for people to vote, especially people of color to vote,\" Biden added, \"we have put together I think the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in the history of American politics.\" However, his second statement was taken out of context in clips and memes that went viral on conservative media at the time, purporting to be an admission that Democrats were preparing to commit election fraud.\n\nThis was debunked at the time, as Biden was actually referring to safeguarding the vote, later adding, \"What [Trump] is trying to do is discourage people from voting by implying that their vote won't be counted, it can't be counted, we're going to challenge it and all these things.\" The film's opening clip sets the tone for the rest of the documentary, which claims to expose a widespread conspiracy to commit voter fraud in the 2020 election.\n\n**Methodology**\n\nThe film's methodology is based on the work of True the Vote, a conservative advocacy group that has been accused of spreading misinformation about voter fraud. The group's founder, Catherine Engelbrecht, appears in the film and claims to have discovered a network of people, known as \"mules,\" who are hired to collect and submit multiple ballots for different people. The film uses footage of people allegedly collecting ballots, as well as data analysis and testimony from alleged witnesses.\n\nHowever, the film's methodology has been widely criticized for its lack of transparency and its reliance on unverified claims and testimony. Many of the people featured in the film have been identified as being associated with conservative groups or having a history of spreading misinformation.\n\n**Reception**\n\nIn the first day of its release, the film earned $300,000, making it the second-highest grossing documentary to date in 2022. According to executive producer Salem Media, it grossed $10 million in revenue in the first two weeks of independent and streaming release, with over one million viewers. Salem said its net revenue makes it the most profitable political documentary in a decade. The film earned $163,331 in its second weekend, and $50,696 in its third.\n\n**Further Response**\n\nOn May 9, 2022, D'Souza criticized Fox News and Newsmax for not promoting the film, claiming that Fox News' Tucker Carlson instructed Engelbrecht not to mention it during his interview with her and that Newsmax had originally booked an interview with D'Souza but then canceled. Trump later made similar criticisms, claiming that \"Fox News is no longer Fox News\" due to not showing or discussing the film, and that the outlet's silence was pleasing to what he called \"Radical Left Democrats.\"\n\n**Lawsuit, Apology, and Disavowal by Salem Media**\n\nIn October 2022, Atlanta citizen Mark Andrews sued Dinesh D'Souza, True the Vote, Gregg Phillips, Catherine Engelbrecht, and Salem Media Group for defamation, conspiracy, and intrusion on seclusion. The film accused him of being a \"mule\" who illegally harvested ballots as part of a fraud ring. Although the film had blurred his face, the film's trailer and promotional stills used his image. A state investigation found that Andrews was legally dropping off ballots for himself, his wife, and their three adult children, who all lived at the same address. The state exonerated Andrews a few days before the movie's premiere.\n\n**Cast**\n\nNot including people only appearing in archive footage.\n\n**Book**\n\nA book based on the film was set for release in September 2022. It had been promoted by D'Souza as including new evidence supporting the film's claims, including the names of specific nonprofits supposedly involved in the conspiracies. Shortly before the scheduled release, the book's publisher, Regnery Publishing, abruptly recalled physical copies already sent to stores, and delayed the e-book release, citing an unspecified \"publishing error.\" NPR obtained a copy, reporting that it repeated the same false claims as made in the film, and features new allegations, including naming specific nonprofits D'Souza claims were involved. Several of these groups have threatened legal action in response.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Voter fraud\n* 2020 United States presidential election\n* Dinesh D'Souza\n* True the Vote\n* Catherine Engelbrecht\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Official website for the film\n* True the Vote website\n* Dinesh D'Souza website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2000_Mules\" following this outline:\n\n\nContent and methodology\n2000 Mules opens with a misleadingly edited clip from October 2020 of then-presidential candidate Joe Biden responding to a podcaster's question about boosting his election turnout After replying, \"Republicans are doing everything they can to make it harder for people to vote, especially people of color to vote\", Biden added, \"we have put together I think the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in the history of American politics.\" His second statement was taken out of context in clips and memes that went viral on conservative media at the time, purporting to be an admission that Democrats were preparing to commit election fraud This was debunked at the time, as Biden was actually referring to safeguarding the vote, later adding, \"What  [Trump] is trying to do is discourage people from voting by implying that their vote won't be counted, it can't be counted, we're going to challenge it and all these things.\" [19]\n\n\nReception\nIn the first day of its release, the film earned $300,000, making it the second-highest grossing documentary to date in 2022 [39] According to executive producer Salem Media, it grossed $10 million in revenue in the first two weeks of independent and streaming release, with over one million viewers Salem said its net revenue makes it the most profitable political documentary in a decade [40] It earned $163,331 in its second weekend, [41] and $50,696 in its third [42]\n\n\nFurther response\nOn May 9, 2022, D'Souza criticized Fox News and Newsmax for not promoting the film, claiming that Fox News' Tucker Carlson instructed Engelbrecht not to mention it during his interview with her and that Newsmax had originally booked an interview with D'Souza but then canceled [46] Trump later made similar criticisms, claiming that \"Fox News is no longer Fox News\" due to not showing or discussing the film, and that the outlet's silence was pleasing to what he called \"Radical Left Democrats\" [43]\n\n\nLawsuit, apology, and disavowal by Salem Media\nIn October 2022, Atlanta citizen Mark Andrews sued Dinesh D'Souza, True the Vote, Gregg Phillips, Catherine Engelbrecht and Salem Media Group for defamation, conspiracy, and intrusion on seclusion [62] The film accused him of being a \"mule\" who illegally harvested ballots as part of a fraud ring Although the film had blurred his face, the film's trailer and promotional stills used his image [63] A state investigation found that Andrews was legally dropping off ballots for himself, his wife, and their three adult children, who all lived at the same address [64] The state exonerated Andrews a few days before the movie's premiere [65]\n\n\nCast\nNot including people only appearing in archive footage.\n\n\nBook\nA book based on the film was set for release in September 2022 It had been promoted by D'Souza as including new evidence supporting the film's claims, including the names of specific nonprofits supposedly involved in the conspiracies Shortly before the scheduled release, the book's publisher, Regnery Publishing, abruptly recalled physical copies already sent to stores, and delayed the e-book release, citing an unspecified \"publishing error\" NPR obtained a copy, reporting that it repeated the same false claims as made in the film, and features new allegations, including naming specific nonprofits D'Souza claims were involved Several of these groups have threatened legal action in response [5]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
