The judicial system is divided into several levels, including common courts, military courts, the Supreme Court, administrative courts, the Constitutional Tribunal, and the State Tribunal.\n\n**Structure**\n\n### Common Courts\n\nThe common courts in Poland are composed of district courts, regional courts, and the Supreme Court. District courts are the first instance courts and have jurisdiction over civil, penal, and administrative cases. Regional courts are appellate courts that hear appeals from district courts. The Supreme Court is the highest instance court and has jurisdiction over cases involving the interpretation of laws and the constitution.\n\n### Military Courts\n\nMilitary courts in Poland have jurisdiction over cases involving military personnel and civilians accused of crimes related to military service. Military courts are composed of military judges and court assessors.\n\n### Supreme Court\n\nThe Supreme Court is the highest instance court in Poland. It has jurisdiction over cases involving the interpretation of laws and the constitution. The Supreme Court also has jurisdiction over disciplinary cases involving judges and court assessors.\n\n### Administrative Courts\n\nAdministrative courts in Poland have jurisdiction over cases involving the administration of public law. Administrative courts hear cases related to the administration of public funds, the exercise of public powers, and the protection of individual rights.\n\n### Constitutional Tribunal\n\nThe Constitutional Tribunal is a constitutional court that has jurisdiction over cases involving the interpretation of the Constitution. The Constitutional Tribunal also has jurisdiction over cases involving the constitutionality of laws and government actions.\n\n### State Tribunal\n\nThe State Tribunal is a specialized court that has jurisdiction over cases involving crimes committed by public officials, including judges, prosecutors, and politicians.\n\n**Procedure**\n\nThe procedure for bringing a case to court in Poland typically begins with the filing of a complaint or indictment. The court then conducts a preliminary hearing to determine whether the case should proceed to trial. If the case proceeds to trial, the parties present evidence and arguments to the court, and the court delivers a verdict.\n\n**Staff**\n\n### Judges and Court Assessors\n\nJudges in Poland are appointed by the President, on the recommendation of the National Council of the Judiciary. Judges are responsible for hearing cases and delivering verdicts. Court assessors are lay judges who assist judges in hearing cases and delivering verdicts.\n\n### National Council of the Judiciary\n\nThe National Council of the Judiciary is a body responsible for the appointment and evaluation of judges. The National Council of the Judiciary is composed of representatives from the judiciary, the legislature, and the executive.\n\n#### Procedure of Appointment\n\nJudges are appointed by the President, on the recommendation of the National Council of the Judiciary. The procedure for appointment involves a nomination process, where the National Council of the Judiciary nominates candidates for the position of judge. The President then appoints the candidate to the position of judge.\n\n#### Rights and Duties\n\nJudges have the right to independence and impartiality in the exercise of their duties. Judges are also subject to disciplinary proceedings for misconduct or failure to perform their duties.\n\n### Judges Sitting in the Tribunals\n\nJudges sitting in the tribunals in Poland are responsible for hearing cases and delivering verdicts. Judges in the tribunals are appointed by the President, on the recommendation of the National Council of the Judiciary.\n\n### Other Judicial Positions\n\nOther judicial positions in Poland include court administrators and clerks. Court administrators are responsible for the administration of the court, including the management of court staff and facilities. Clerks are responsible for providing administrative support to judges and court staff.\n\n### Remuneration\n\nJudges and court assessors in Poland are remunerated according to their position and level of experience. Judges and court assessors are also entitled to benefits, including pensions and health insurance.\n\n**Minimal Requirements**\n\nTo become a judge in Poland, an individual must meet certain minimal requirements, including:\n\n* Age: at least 30 years old\n* Education: a law degree from a recognized university\n* Experience: at least 5 years of experience in the legal profession\n* Language skills: proficiency in Polish and English\n* Health: good physical and mental health\n\n**Issues**\n\n### Length of Proceedings\n\nOne of the issues facing the judiciary in Poland is the length of proceedings. Cases can take several years to come to trial, and some cases have been known to take over a decade to resolve.\n\n### Lack of Popular Support and Trust\n\nThe judiciary in Poland has faced criticism from the public and the media for being seen as out of touch with the needs and concerns of ordinary citizens. Some have accused the judiciary of being corrupt and biased in favor of the ruling party.\n\n### Other Issues\n\nOther issues facing the judiciary in Poland include:\n\n* Underfunding: the judiciary has faced significant funding cuts in recent years, which has put a strain on court resources and staff.\n* Lack of transparency: some have criticized the judiciary for lacking transparency and accountability in its decision-making processes.\n* Partisan control: some have accused the National Council of the Judiciary of being controlled by the ruling party, which has led to the appointment of judges who are seen as sympathetic to the party's ideology.\n\n### Rule of Law Concerns\n\nThe judiciary in Poland has faced concerns about the rule of law, including:\n\n* Capture of the Constitutional Tribunal: the Constitutional Tribunal has been criticized for being captured by the ruling party, which has led to the issuance of rulings that are seen as favorable to the party's interests.\n* Undue influence on judges: some have accused the National Council of the Judiciary of exerting undue influence on judges, which has led to the appointment of judges who are seen as sympathetic to the ruling party's ideology.\n* Partisan control of the National Council of the Judiciary: the National Council of the Judiciary has been accused of being controlled by the ruling party, which has led to the appointment of judges who are seen as sympathetic to the party's ideology.\n\n### Repercussions in Poland and Abroad\n\nThe concerns about the rule of law in Poland have had significant repercussions both in Poland and abroad. Some of the repercussions include:\n\n* International criticism: the European Union and other international organizations have criticized Poland for its treatment of the judiciary and its impact on the rule of law.\n* Economic consequences: the concerns about the rule of law have led to concerns about the stability of the Polish economy, which has had a negative impact on investors and businesses.\n* Social unrest: the concerns about the rule of law have led to social unrest and protests in Poland, which have been met with a heavy-handed response from the authorities.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Judiciary of the European Union\n* Law of Poland\n* Politics of Poland\n* Human rights in Poland\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on information available in the public domain and is intended for informational purposes only.\n* The information contained in this article may not be comprehensive or up-to-date.\n* The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of any organization or individual.\n\n**References**\n\n* None\n\n**External links**\n\n* Official website of the Supreme Court of Poland\n* Official website of the Constitutional Tribunal of Poland\n* Official website of the National Council of the Judiciary of Poland", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Judiciary_of_Poland\" following this outline:\n\n#Structure\n##Common courts\n##Military courts\n##Supreme Court\n##Administrative courts\n##Constitutional Tribunal\n##State Tribunal\n#Procedure\n#Staff\n##Judges and court assessors\n###National Council of the Judiciary\n####Procedure of appointment\n####Rights and duties\n##Judges sitting in the tribunals\n##Other judicial positions\n##Remuneration\n#Minimal requirements\n#Issues\n##Length of proceedings\n##Lack of popular support and trust\n##Other issues\n##Rule of law concerns\n###Capture of the Constitutional Tribunal\n###Undue influence on judges\n###Partisan control of the National Council of the Judiciary\n####Arbitrary secondment of judges\n###Repercussions in Poland and abroad\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The incident sparked a significant diplomatic crisis between the United States and China, and was widely covered in the media.\n\n**Background**\n\n### History and development of reconnaissance balloons\n\nReconnaissance balloons have been used by countries for military and intelligence gathering purposes for several decades. The first known use of reconnaissance balloons was by the United States during the Cold War, with the development of the U-2 spy plane in the 1950s. Since then, many countries, including China, have developed their own reconnaissance balloon capabilities.\n\n**Past Chinese balloons and unidentified objects**\n\nChina has been known to use reconnaissance balloons in the past. In 2019, a Chinese balloon was spotted over the United States, and in 2020, a similar incident occurred in the Philippines. In 2022, a Chinese balloon was detected over Japan, and a second incident occurred in the same year. These incidents have raised concerns about China's military capabilities and intentions.\n\n### U.S.–China tensions\n\nThe relationship between the United States and China has been strained in recent years, with both countries competing for influence in the Asia-Pacific region. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated tensions, with the United States accusing China of mishandling the outbreak and failing to provide adequate support to the international community. The balloon incident has added to these tensions, with the United States accusing China of violating its sovereignty and China denying any wrongdoing.\n\n**Incident**\n\n### Balloon\n\nThe balloon that was detected over the United States was a high-altitude surveillance balloon that was approximately 200 feet (60 meters) tall and 100 feet (30 meters) wide. It was equipped with a payload that included sensors and communication equipment, which allowed it to gather signals intelligence and transmit data back to China. The balloon was powered by a combination of solar panels and a battery, which allowed it to remain aloft for extended periods of time.\n\n### Signals intelligence capabilities\n\nThe balloon was equipped with a range of signals intelligence capabilities, including satellite communication systems and radar systems. These systems allowed the balloon to gather information on military and civilian communications, as well as to detect and track aircraft and ships. The balloon was also equipped with a range of sensors that allowed it to gather data on weather patterns, topography, and other environmental factors.\n\n### Detection\n\nThe balloon was first detected over the United States on January 28, 2023, by a U.S. Air National Guard unit in Hawaii. The unit detected the balloon using radar and visual observations, and immediately reported the sighting to U.S. military commanders. The balloon was tracked as it moved over the United States, with the U.S. military monitoring its movements and gathering intelligence on its capabilities.\n\n### Flight path\n\nThe balloon's flight path took it over several states in the United States, including Hawaii, Alaska, and the contiguous states. The balloon was tracked as it moved over these states, with the U.S. military monitoring its movements and gathering intelligence on its capabilities.\n\n### U.S. monitoring and counterintelligence\n\nThe U.S. military and intelligence agencies closely monitored the balloon's movements and gathered intelligence on its capabilities. The U.S. also took steps to counter the balloon's signals intelligence capabilities, including using electronic countermeasures to jam its communication systems.\n\n### Downing\n\nAfter tracking the balloon's movements for several days, the U.S. military decided to down the balloon using a missile. The balloon was shot down over the Atlantic Ocean on February 4, 2023, after it had moved over several states in the United States. The downing of the balloon was widely covered in the media, and sparked a significant diplomatic crisis between the United States and China.\n\n### Debris recovery\n\nAfter the balloon was shot down, the U.S. military recovered debris from the crash site. The debris was analyzed by U.S. military and intelligence agencies, who determined that it was consistent with the balloon's design and capabilities.\n\n**Legality of airspace and downing**\n\nThe downing of the balloon by the U.S. military raised questions about the legality of the incident. Under international law, countries have the right to shoot down aircraft that enter their airspace without permission. However, the incident also raised concerns about the potential for escalation and the impact on international relations.\n\n**Response and reactions**\n\n### United States\n\nThe United States responded to the incident by accusing China of violating its sovereignty and launching a surveillance balloon over its territory. The U.S. military and intelligence agencies closely monitored the balloon's movements and gathered intelligence on its capabilities. The U.S. also took steps to counter the balloon's signals intelligence capabilities, including using electronic countermeasures to jam its communication systems.\n\n### Canada\n\nCanada responded to the incident by issuing a statement condemning China's actions and expressing concern about the potential for escalation. Canada also joined the United States in calling for an explanation from China about the incident.\n\n### China\n\nChina responded to the incident by denying any wrongdoing and accusing the United States of hyping up the incident. China also claimed that the balloon was a civilian airship that had been blown off course by weather conditions.\n\n### NATO\n\nNATO responded to the incident by issuing a statement condemning China's actions and expressing concern about the potential for escalation. NATO also called for an explanation from China about the incident.\n\n### Australia\n\nAustralia responded to the incident by issuing a statement condemning China's actions and expressing concern about the potential for escalation. Australia also called for an explanation from China about the incident.\n\n### Japan\n\nJapan responded to the incident by issuing a statement condemning China's actions and expressing concern about the potential for escalation. Japan also called for an explanation from China about the incident.\n\n### Singapore\n\nSingapore responded to the incident by issuing a statement condemning China's actions and expressing concern about the potential for escalation. Singapore also called for an explanation from China about the incident.\n\n### United Kingdom\n\nThe United Kingdom responded to the incident by issuing a statement condemning China's actions and expressing concern about the potential for escalation. The UK also called for an explanation from China about the incident.\n\n### Venezuela\n\nVenezuela responded to the incident by issuing a statement condemning the actions of the United States and expressing support for China's sovereignty.\n\n### Media reactions\n\n#### Analysis\n\nThe media reaction to the incident was widespread, with many analysts and commentators offering their perspectives on the incident. Some commentators saw the incident as a significant escalation of tensions between the United States and China, while others saw it as a minor incident that had been blown out of proportion.\n\n#### Satire\n\nThe media reaction also included some satirical commentary, with some commentators and comedians using humor to poke fun at the incident. For example, some commentators joked about the balloon being a \"superman cape\" or a \"Chinese spy blanket\".\n\n**Other high-altitude objects in February 2023**\n\nIn addition to the Chinese balloon, there were several other high-altitude objects detected in February 2023. These objects included a U.S. Air Force satellite that was launched in January 2023, as well as a range of other satellites and aircraft that were detected by radar and visual observations.\n\n**Additional assessments of the balloon**\n\nAfter the incident, there were several additional assessments of the balloon and its capabilities. These assessments included analysis of the balloon's design and capabilities, as well as its potential impact on international relations.\n\n**See also**\n\n* 2019 Chinese balloon incident\n* 2020 Chinese balloon incident\n* 2022 Chinese balloon incident\n* U.S.–China relations\n* Signals intelligence\n\n**Notes**", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Chinese_balloon_incident\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##History and development of reconnaissance balloons\n###Past Chinese balloons and unidentified objects\n##U.S.–China tensions\n#Incident\n##Balloon\n###Size, propulsion, and payload\n###Signals intelligence capabilities\n##Detection\n##Flight path\n##U.S. monitoring and counterintelligence\n##Downing\n##Debris recovery\n#Legality of airspace and downing\n#Response and reactions\n##United States\n##Canada\n##China\n##NATO\n##Australia\n##Japan\n##Singapore\n##United Kingdom\n##Venezuela\n##Media reactions\n###Analysis\n###Satire\n#Other high-altitude objects in February 2023\n#Additional assessments of the balloon\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The team is controlled by the Royal Moroccan Football Federation, which is a member of FIFA and the Confederation of African Football (CAF).\n\n**History**\n\n### Pre-independence period\n\nThe history of the Moroccan national football team began in 1928, when a group of Moroccan players formed a team to represent the country in international competitions. However, it wasn't until 1955 that the team began to take shape, with the formation of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation.\n\n### Beginning of Morocco (1955–1963)\n\nIn the early years, the team faced stiff competition from other African nations, but they slowly began to make a name for themselves. Morocco's first major international appearance was at the 1957 Pan Arab Games, where they finished third. They also participated in the 1959 Arab Nations Cup, where they finished second.\n\n### First appearances in international competitions (1963–1976)\n\nMorocco's first major international tournament was the 1963 African Cup of Nations, where they finished third. They also participated in the 1965 Mediterranean Games, where they finished second. In the 1970s, Morocco began to make a name for themselves in international competitions, finishing second at the 1976 African Cup of Nations.\n\n### Between successes and defeats (1976–1986)\n\nThe 1970s and 1980s were a mixed bag for Morocco, with the team experiencing both success and defeat. They finished third at the 1978 African Cup of Nations, but were eliminated in the group stages of the 1982 World Cup. They also finished second at the 1988 African Cup of Nations.\n\n### Golden generation (1986–2000)\n\nThe 1990s saw the emergence of a golden generation of Moroccan players, including Mustapha Hadji, Hassan Nader, and Rachid Azzouzi. This team finished third at the 1992 African Cup of Nations and reached the quarterfinals of the 1998 World Cup.\n\n### Difficult years (2006–2017)\n\nIn the 2000s and 2010s, Morocco faced a period of decline, failing to qualify for the World Cup and struggling in African competitions. They finished third at the 2004 African Cup of Nations, but were eliminated in the group stages of the 2010 World Cup.\n\n### Second golden generation (2017–present)\n\nIn 2017, Morocco began to experience a resurgence in fortunes, with the emergence of a new generation of players, including Hakim Ziyech, Achraf Hakimi, and Amine Harit. This team finished third at the 2018 World Cup and won the 2018 African Nations Championship.\n\n**Home stadium**\n\nThe Morocco national football team plays their home matches at the Mohammed V Stadium in Casablanca, which has a capacity of 67,000. The stadium is one of the largest in Africa and has hosted several major international matches.\n\n**Kit suppliers**\n\nThe kit suppliers for the Morocco national football team are Adidas, who have been the team's kit supplier since 1976.\n\n**Results and fixtures**\n\n### 2023\n\nMorocco's results in 2023 include:\n\n* 2023 Africa Cup of Nations: Group stage\n* 2023 FIFA Arab Cup: Group

This issue has been a concern for the province of Alberta, with thousands of orphan wells remaining unplugged, posing environmental and economic risks.\n\n##Current overview\n\nAs of 2022, there are approximately 95,000 active oil and gas wells in Alberta, while an estimated 72,000 wells have been abandoned or are no longer producing. The number of orphan wells in Alberta is increasing, with the average annual abandonment rate exceeding 2,000 wells. The majority of these wells are located in the province's oil sands region.\n\n##Context\n\nThe abandonment of oil and gas wells has become a significant issue in Alberta due to a combination of factors. The decline in oil prices in 2014 led to a decrease in drilling and production activities, resulting in a large number of wells being abandoned. Additionally, many small and medium-sized oil and gas companies have gone bankrupt, leaving behind unplugged wells.\n\n##Landowners and municipalities\n\nLandowners and municipalities in Alberta are often affected by the presence of orphan wells on their properties. These wells can pose environmental hazards, such as fugitive gas emissions and surface casing vent flow (SCVF), which can contaminate soil and groundwater. Landowners may also be responsible for maintaining and plugging orphan wells, which can be a costly and time-consuming process.\n\n##Orphan Well Association\n\nThe Orphan Well Association (OWA) is a non-profit organization responsible for managing and plugging orphan wells in Alberta. The OWA was established in 2016 to address the growing number of unplugged wells and provide a framework for their management and abandonment. The OWA works with landowners, municipalities, and industry stakeholders to plug orphan wells and restore the environment.\n\n##OWA funding\n\nThe OWA relies on funding from various sources to plug orphan wells. This includes federal and provincial subsidies, as well as industry contributions.\n\n###Federal and provincial subsidies\n\nThe Canadian government has provided funding to the OWA through the Federal Orphan Wells Program. The program provides funding to provinces to plug orphan wells and restore the environment. In addition, the Government of Alberta has also provided funding to the OWA through the Orphan Well Remediation Program.\n\n##Alberta Energy Regulator\n\nThe Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) is responsible for regulating the oil and gas industry in Alberta, including the management and abandonment of oil and gas wells. The AER requires oil and gas companies to submit plans for well abandonment and plugging, and ensures that these plans are carried out in accordance with regulatory requirements.\n\n##Legal and regulatory considerations\n\nThe abandonment of oil and gas wells in Alberta is regulated by several laws and regulations, including the Oil and Gas Conservation Act and the Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act. These laws require oil and gas companies to take responsibility for the environmental impacts of their operations, including the abandonment of wells.\n\n###Polluter pays principle\n\nThe polluter pays principle is a key concept in Alberta's environmental laws and regulations. This principle requires companies to take responsibility for the environmental impacts of their operations and to pay for the costs associated with remediation and abandonment.\n\n###Suspended inactive wells\n\nSuspended inactive wells are wells that are no longer producing but have not yet been abandoned. These wells can pose environmental risks, including fugitive gas emissions and SCVF. The AER requires companies to submit plans for the abandonment of suspended inactive wells and ensures that these plans are carried out in accordance with regulatory requirements.\n\n##Bankruptcies and orphan wells\n\nBankruptcies have contributed to the growing number of orphan wells in Alberta. Many small and medium-sized oil and gas companies have gone bankrupt, leaving behind unplugged wells and a legacy of environmental and financial liabilities.\n\n###Strategic packaging of costly liabilities with productive assets\n\nSome oil and gas companies have been accused of strategic packaging of costly liabilities with productive assets. This involves packaging the abandonment costs of orphan wells with the value of productive assets, making it difficult for landowners and municipalities to determine the true costs of abandonment.\n\n##Environmental impacts of orphan wells\n\nOrphan wells can have significant environmental impacts, including fugitive gas emissions and SCVF. These impacts can contaminate soil and groundwater, posing risks to human health and the environment.\n\n###Fugitive gas emissions\n\nFugitive gas emissions occur when gas leaks from unplugged wells, posing risks to the environment and human health. These emissions can contribute to climate change and can also contaminate soil and groundwater.\n\n###Surface casing vent flow (SCVF) and gas migration (GM)\n\nSCVF and GM are terms used to describe the flow of gas from the surface casing of a well into the surrounding environment. These events can occur when a well is not properly plugged or abandoned, and can contaminate soil and groundwater.\n\n##Potential geothermal conversion of orphan wells in Alberta\n\nThere is potential for the conversion of orphan wells in Alberta into geothermal energy producers. This would involve retrofitting the wells to produce heat from the earth, rather than oil and gas. This approach could provide a new source of clean energy and reduce the environmental impacts associated with orphan wells.\n\n##Responses\n\nThe response to the issue of orphan wells in Alberta has been multifaceted, involving government, industry, and non-profit organizations. The Alberta government has developed policies and regulations to address the issue, while industry has taken steps to reduce the number of unplugged wells. Non-profit organizations, such as the OWA, have also played a critical role in addressing the issue.\n\n##See also\n\n* Oil and gas industry\n* Environmental impact of oil and gas\n* Abandoned well\n\n##Notes\n\n* The term \"orphan well\" refers to an abandoned oil or gas well that is no longer actively producing and has a well owner or operator that cannot be found or is unable to plug the well.\n\n##External links\n\n* Orphan Well Association\n* Alberta Energy Regulator\n* Government of Alberta, Orphan Well Remediation Program\n\nThis article has been written in a neutral, encyclopedic tone, following the exact outline structure provided, and including relevant details and explanations in each section.

The valley stretches for approximately 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) and is nestled in the heart of the park, surrounded by rolling hills and towering mountains. Chapel-le-Dale is a popular destination for hikers, nature lovers, and those seeking a tranquil retreat from urban life.\n\n**History**\n\nChapel-le-Dale has a rich and varied history dating back to the Roman era. The valley was an important route for traders and travelers, with the Romans constructing a road that passed through the valley. This road, known as the \"Roman Road,\" still exists today and is a popular route for hikers and cyclists.\n\n### River names\n\nThe valley is home to several rivers, including the River Wharfe and its tributaries. The River Wharfe is a significant watercourse that flows through the valley and is known for its crystal-clear waters and picturesque scenery. The river is popular for fishing, canoeing, and kayaking.\n\n### Etymology\n\nThe name \"Chapel-le-Dale\" is derived from the Old English words \"cæpel\" meaning \"chapel\" and \"dæl\" meaning \"valley.\" The name likely refers to a small chapel or place of worship that was located in the valley. Over time, the name has evolved to become \"Chapel-le-Dale,\" which is now widely recognized as the name of the valley.\n\n**Geology and geomorphology**\n\nChapel-le-Dale is a glacial valley, formed during the last ice age when glaciers carved out the landscape and created the valley's unique shape. The valley is surrounded by limestone cliffs, which are a testament to the region's rich geological history. The limestone rocks that underlie the valley date back to the Carboniferous period, over 300 million years ago.\n\n### Quarrying and mining\n\nThe valley has been quarried and mined for centuries, with limestone being the primary commodity extracted. The limestone was used for building materials, including stone walls, bridges, and buildings. The valley's unique geology also made it an ideal location for extracting other minerals, including lead, zinc, and copper.\n\n**Climate**\n\nChapel-le-Dale has a temperate maritime climate, characterized by mild winters and cool summers. The valley experiences a significant amount of rainfall throughout the year, with an average of over 1,000 mm (39 in) per year. The valley's climate is also influenced by its proximity to the Pennine Mountains, which creates a rain shadow effect and contributes to the region's unique microclimate.\n\n**Settlements and governance**\n\nThe valley is home to several small settlements, including the village of Chapel-le-Dale itself. The village is a popular destination for tourists, with its picturesque scenery, historic buildings, and welcoming community. The valley is also governed by the Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority, which is responsible for managing the park's natural and cultural resources.\n\n**Tourist attractions**\n\nChapel-le-Dale is a popular destination for tourists, with its scenic valleys, rolling hills, and picturesque villages. The valley is home to several tourist attractions, including the Chapel-le-Dale Village, the Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority Visitor Centre, and the Malham Cove Nature Reserve. Visitors can also explore the valley's many hiking trails, which offer stunning views and access to the region's unique wildlife and geology.\n\n**Wildlife and designations**\n\nChapel-le-Dale is home to a wide range of wildlife, including red grouse, curlew, and hen harrier. The valley is also a habitat for several rare plant species, including the limestone fern and the green-veined white butterfly. The valley has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) due to its unique geology and biodiversity.\n\n**Notable people**\n\nSeveral notable people have connections to Chapel-le-Dale, including the artist J.M.W. Turner, who painted several landscapes of the valley. The valley is also home to several notable writers and poets, including the poet W.H. Auden, who was inspired by the valley's natural beauty.\n\n**Notes**\n\nChapel-le-Dale is a unique and fascinating valley, with its rich history, stunning scenery, and diverse wildlife. The valley continues to be an important destination for tourists, hikers, and nature lovers, and its natural and cultural resources are protected and managed by the Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority.\n\n**References**\n\n* Sources:\n\n* Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority.

They are a significant portion of the population in the Nagpur district and have a distinct culture, language, and tradition that sets them apart from other ethnic groups in the region.\n\n**Names**\n\nThe term \"Nagpuria\" is derived from the name of the city of Nagpur, which was the capital of the Nagpur Kingdom in the 18th century. The Nagpuria people have been known by various names throughout history, including \"Nagpurkar\" and \"Nagpurwasi.\" They are also referred to as \"Nagpurais\" in some contexts.\n\n**History**\n\n### Prehistoric era\n\nThe Nagpur region has been inhabited since prehistoric times. Archaeological evidence suggests that the area was home to ancient civilizations, including the Neolithic and Mesolithic cultures. The Nagpuria people are believed to have descended from these early inhabitants, who were influenced by various cultures and traditions that arrived in the region over time.\n\n### Ancient period\n\nThe Nagpur region was a part of the ancient Indian kingdoms of Vidarbha and Maharashtra. The Nagpuria people were likely influenced by the culture and traditions of these kingdoms, which were known for their rich cultural heritage and architectural achievements. During this period, the Nagpuria people developed their own distinct culture, language, and traditions, which were shaped by their interactions with other ethnic groups in the region.\n\n### Medieval period\n\nIn the medieval period, the Nagpur region was ruled by various dynasties, including the Yadavas and the Bahamani Sultanate. The Nagpuria people were influenced by these rulers, who introduced new cultures, languages, and traditions to the region. The Nagpuria people also developed their own kingdoms and chieftainships during this period, which were known for their military prowess and administrative skills.\n\n### Modern period\n\nIn the modern period, the Nagpur region underwent significant changes due to British colonial rule. The Nagpuria people were influenced by British culture and traditions, which were introduced by the British East India Company. The Nagpuria people also developed their own modern culture, language, and traditions, which were shaped by their interactions with other ethnic groups in the region.\n\n### Post-Independence\n\nAfter India gained independence in 1947, the Nagpuria people continued to develop their own distinct culture, language, and traditions. The Nagpur region became a significant center for education, industry, and culture in Maharashtra, and the Nagpuria people played a key role in shaping the state's cultural and economic landscape.\n\n**Communities**\n\n### Lineages\n\nThe Nagpuria people are divided into various lineages, which are based on their ancestral origin and occupation.

The crisis was triggered by a combination of factors, including the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank, as well as the liquidation of Silvergate Bank.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe banking industry in the United States had been experiencing significant stress in the years leading up to the crisis, due to a combination of factors including high interest rates, declining profitability, and a surge in deposit outflows. Many banks had invested heavily in long-term bonds, which had become increasingly volatile in value due to rising interest rates. At the same time, there was a significant increase in deposit outflows, particularly among tech companies and venture capital firms, which had historically been major customers of Silicon Valley Bank.\n\n**Liquidation of Silvergate Bank**\n\n**Background**\n\nSilvergate Bank was a small, California-based bank that had specialized in serving the cryptocurrency and fintech industries. The bank had been experiencing significant losses due to its investments in the crypto market, which had declined sharply in value in 2022. In January 2023, the bank announced that it would be winding down its operations and selling off its assets.\n\n**Events**\n\nOn March 1, 2023, Silvergate Bank announced that it would be liquidating its assets and selling off its deposits. The bank's customers were informed that they would be able to access their deposits, but that the bank's branches would be closed and its operations would be phased out. The liquidation of Silvergate Bank was seen as a warning sign for the banking industry, and many analysts began to speculate about the potential for other banks to fail.\n\n**Collapse of Silicon Valley Bank**\n\n**Background**\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was a major bank based in California that had specialized in serving the tech industry. The bank had a significant client base among venture capital firms, tech startups, and other companies in the tech sector. The bank's deposits had grown rapidly in the years leading up to the crisis, but its investments in long-term bonds had become increasingly volatile in value due to rising interest rates.\n\n**Events**\n\nOn March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank announced that it was experiencing significant losses due to a decline in the value of its investments. The bank's shares plummeted in value, and its customers began to withdraw their deposits in large numbers. On March 11, 2023, the bank was placed into receivership by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, and its assets were seized by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).\n\n**Collapse of Signature Bank**\n\n**Background**\n\nSignature Bank was a New York-based bank that had specialized in serving the fintech and cryptocurrency industries. The bank had been experiencing significant losses due to its investments in the crypto market, which had declined sharply in value in 2022.\n\n**Events**\n\nOn March 12, 2023, Signature Bank announced that it was experiencing significant losses due to a decline in the value of its investments. The bank's shares plummeted in value, and its customers began to withdraw their deposits in large numbers. On March 13, 2023, the bank was placed into receivership by the New York State Department of Financial Services, and its assets were seized by the FDIC.\n\n**Collapse of First Republic Bank**\n\n**Background**\n\nFirst Republic Bank was a San Francisco-based bank that had specialized in serving the wealth management and private banking sectors. The bank had a significant client base among high-net-worth individuals and families, and had invested heavily in long-term bonds.\n\n**Events**\n\nOn March 16, 2023, First Republic Bank announced that it was experiencing significant losses due to a decline in the value of its investments. The bank's shares plummeted in value, and its customers began to withdraw their deposits in large numbers. On March 17, 2023, the bank was placed into receivership by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, and its assets were seized by the FDIC.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe collapse of the four banks had significant consequences for the US banking system and the broader economy.\n\n**Bank Term Funding Program**\n\nThe US Federal Reserve announced a Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) to provide emergency funding to banks, which would be collateralized by high-quality assets. The program was designed to help banks meet their short-term funding needs and prevent further bank failures.\n\n**Government discussion of other funding**\n\nThe US government began discussing other funding options to support the banking system, including a potential bailout package or a restructuring of the banks. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department held emergency meetings to discuss the crisis and potential solutions.\n\n**U.S. investigations**\n\nThe US government launched investigations into the collapse of the four banks, including the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The investigations focused on the banks' risk management practices, their investments in long-term bonds, and their handling of deposit outflows.\n\n**Economic impact**\n\nThe collapse of the four banks had significant economic implications, including a decline in the value of the US dollar, a rise in interest rates, and a decrease in consumer confidence. The crisis also led to a decline in the value of stocks and bonds, and a slowdown in economic growth.\n\n**International impact**\n\nThe collapse of the four banks had significant international implications, including a decline in the value of the US dollar, a rise in interest rates, and a decrease in global economic growth. The crisis also led to a decline in the value of stocks and bonds, and a slowdown in economic growth in other major economies.\n\n**See also**\n\nThe 2023 United States banking crisis has significant implications for the US banking system, the broader economy, and the global financial markets. The crisis highlights the need for greater regulation and oversight of the banking industry, as well as the need for banks to adopt more robust risk management practices.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_United_States_banking_crisis\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Liquidation of Silvergate Bank\n##Background\n##Events\n#Collapse of Silicon Valley Bank\n##Background\n##Events\n#Collapse of Signature Bank\n##Background\n##Events\n#Collapse of First Republic Bank\n##Background\n##Events\n#Aftermath\n##Bank Term Funding Program\n##Government discussion of other funding\n##U.S. investigations\n##Economic impact\n##International impact\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Chandru. The film stars Shiva Rajkumar, Kiccha Sudeepa, and Apoorva Asrani in the lead roles. The film was released on 31 August 2022 to positive reviews from critics and audiences alike.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe film revolves around the life of a forest guard named Demanna (played by Shiva Rajkumar), who is tasked with protecting a forest in the Western Ghats. Demanna is a simple man who is deeply connected to nature and is determined to protect the forest and its inhabitants. However, his life takes a dramatic turn when a group of loggers, led by a ruthless businessman named Bhairava (played by Kiccha Sudeepa), arrive in the forest to cut down trees.\n\nAs Demanna tries to stop the loggers, he discovers that they are not just ordinary loggers, but are actually involved in a sinister plot to destroy the forest and its inhabitants. Demanna must use all his skills and knowledge to protect the forest and its inhabitants from the loggers and their boss.\n\n#Cast\n\n* Shiva Rajkumar as Demanna\n* Kiccha Sudeepa as Bhairava\n* Apoorva Asrani as Mugil\n* Prakash Raj as Gnaneshwar\n* Achyuth Kumar as Karkala\n* V.

Ravi Shankar as Chandra\n\n#Production\n\n##Development\n\nKantara was first announced in 2019, with Shiva Rajkumar and Kiccha Sudeepa being cast in the lead roles. The film was initially supposed to be a remake of the 2016 Kannada film \"Bairavaa\", but it was later revealed that the film would be an original story written and directed by R. Chandru.\n\n##Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for Kantara began in December 2020 and wrapped up in February 2022. The film was shot in various locations across Karnataka, including the Western Ghats, Kukke Subrahmanya, and Karkala. The film's cinematography was handled by R. Chandru, and the editing was done by Srikanth 2.0.\n\n#Music\n\nThe music for Kantara was composed by Ravi Shankar and Anirudh Ravichander. The soundtrack features six songs, including the title track \"Kantara\", which was released in July 2022. The song was a huge hit and received positive reviews from critics and audiences alike.

The film's success can be attributed to its positive word-of-mouth and the fact that it was released in a time when there were no other big releases in Karnataka. The film's box office performance was also boosted by its strong opening in Bengaluru, where it grossed over ₹50 crore (US$7 million) in the first week.\n\n###Telugu version\n\nThe Telugu version of Kantara was released on 18 November 2022, and it grossed over ₹10 crore (US$1.4 million) in the first week. The film's success in Telugu can be attributed to the popularity of Shiva Rajkumar and Kiccha Sudeepa in the state.\n\n###Hindi version\n\nThe Hindi version of Kantara was released on 25 November 2022, and it grossed over ₹5 crore (US$690,000) in the first week. The film's success in Hindi can be attributed to the popularity of Shiva Rajkumar and Kiccha Sudeepa in the north.\n\n##Critical reception\n\nKantara received positive reviews from critics, with many praising the film's storyline, performances, and cinematography. The film holds a rating of 85% on BookMyShow, with many critics praising the film's emotional depth and the performances of the lead actors. The film also received praise from prominent film critics, such as Vijayalakshmi Retnachoudary and Sharadhaa.\n\n#Impact\n\nKantara has had a significant impact on the Kannada film industry, with many praising the film's storyline and performances. The film's success has also led to a surge in popularity for Shiva Rajkumar and Kiccha Sudeepa, who are now considered two of the most popular actors in the industry. The film's success has also led to a increase in the production of Kannada films, with many new films being released in the state.\n\n#Prequel\n\nA prequel to Kantara is currently in production, with Shiva Rajkumar and Kiccha Sudeepa reprising their roles. The film is expected to be released in 2023, and it is expected to be a huge hit, given the success of the original film.\n\n#Controversies\n\nKantara has been involved in several controversies, including a dispute between the film's cast and crew over the film's music rights. The film's music composer, Ravi Shankar, had claimed that the film's music was not released in a timely manner, leading to a delay in the film's release. The dispute was eventually resolved, but it led to a delay in the film's release.\n\n#Notes\n\nKantara is a Kannada-language action drama film that has been widely praised for its storyline, performances, and cinematography. The film has been a commercial success, grossing over ₹200 crore (US$28 million) in Karnataka alone.

The story takes place four years after the events of _Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom_ and follows the events of a global dinosaur resurgence.\n\n**Plot**\nThe film begins with a flashback sequence showing Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) and Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) visiting Isla Nublar, the site of the original Jurassic Park, to see the museum that has been built to house the dinosaurs. However, they soon discover that the island is overrun with dinosaurs, and they are forced to flee.\n\nThe story then jumps forward to the present day, where a new threat emerges in the form of a genetically modified locust that is threatening to destroy the world's food supply. A team of scientists, led by Dr. Kayla Watts (DeWanda Wise), tries to find a solution to the problem, but their efforts are hampered by the fact that the locusts are being controlled by a sinister organization known as Biosyn.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Owen and Claire team up with a new character, Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), to stop the locusts and uncover the truth about Biosyn. Along the way, they encounter a range of dinosaurs, including the Indominus rex and the Mosasaur.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Chris Pratt as Owen Grady\n* Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire Dearing\n* Sam Neill as Dr. Alan Grant\n* Laura Dern as Dr. Ellie Sattler\n* Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm\n* DeWanda Wise as Dr. Kayla Watts\n* Mamoudou Athie as Dr. Charles Riele\n* Campbell Scott as Senator Russell\n* Justice Smith as Franklin Webb\n* Daniella Pineda as Dr. Zia Rodriguez\n* BD Wong as Dr. Henry Wu\n* Omar Sy as Barry Sembène\n* Dichen Lachman as Dr. Viola Sinclair\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\nThe idea for _Jurassic World Dominion_ was first conceived by Colin Trevorrow in 2015, shortly after the release of _Jurassic World_. At the time, Trevorrow was planning to write and direct a sequel to the film, but the project was put on hold due to the success of _Star Wars: The Force Awakens_.\n\nIn 2017, Trevorrow announced that he would be returning to the _Jurassic Park_ franchise to write and direct _Jurassic World Dominion_, with a release date set for June 21, 2019. However, the film's production was delayed due to the success of _Avengers: Endgame_ and the subsequent box office performance of _Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker_.\n\n### Pre-production\nPre-production on _Jurassic World Dominion_ began in 2018, with a focus on developing the story and characters. Trevorrow worked closely with the film's cast, including Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, to ensure that their characters were well-developed and consistent with the tone of the film.\n\nThe film's script was written by Trevorrow and Emily Carmichael, who had previously worked together on _The Last Jedi_. The script underwent several revisions before Trevorrow was satisfied with the final product.\n\n### Writing\nThe script for _Jurassic World Dominion_ was influenced by a range of classic sci-fi films, including _The Terminator_ and _The Matrix_. Trevorrow wanted to create a film that would explore the consequences of playing god with genetic engineering and the impact on society.\n\nThe script also delved into the themes of colonialism and the exploitation of indigenous cultures, which were central to the original _Jurassic Park_ film. Trevorrow wanted to create a film that would explore the complexities of these issues in a way that was both thought-provoking and entertaining.\n\n### Casting\nCasting for _Jurassic World Dominion_ began in 2018, with Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard returning to reprise their roles as Owen Grady and Claire Dearing.

The opera tells the story of a young woman's tragic fate, set amidst the turmoil of the Crusades. The work was initially met with acclaim but later fell into neglect due to its perceived connection to Finland's language strife and Sibelius's own conservative views. However, in recent years, The Maiden in the Tower has experienced a posthumous revival, with performances and recordings reevaluating its significance in the context of Sibelius's oeuvre.\n\n**#History**\n\nThe composition of The Maiden in the Tower is a reflection of the tumultuous period in which Sibelius wrote it. The opera's premiere took place on January 26, 1913, at the Helsinki Music Hall, with the Finnish Opera Orchestra conducted by Wilho Ilomäki. The work was met with widespread acclaim, with many praising Sibelius's use of folk influences and his ability to weave a compelling narrative.\n\n### ##Composition\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower is scored for a large orchestra, including a prominent role for the chorus. Sibelius drew heavily from Finnish folk music, incorporating traditional melodies and rhythms into the opera's score. The work's musical language is characterized by its use of modal harmony and a sense of forward momentum, which was a hallmark of Sibelius's style.\n\n### ##Premiere\n\nThe premiere of The Maiden in the Tower was a major event in Finnish musical life. The opera was performed to a sold-out audience, with many in attendance expressing their enthusiasm for the work. The performance was met with widespread critical acclaim, with many praising Sibelius's ability to tell a compelling story through music.\n\n### ##Withdrawal and suppression\n\nDespite its initial success, The Maiden in the Tower eventually fell into neglect. This was due in part to Sibelius's own conservative views on art and culture, which were seen as out of step with the modernist trends of the time. Additionally, the opera's perceived connection to Finland's language strife, a period of intense cultural and linguistic debate in the country, made it a target for critics.\n\n### ##Posthumous revival\n\nIn recent years, The Maiden in the Tower has experienced a posthumous revival, with performances and recordings reevaluating its significance in the context of Sibelius's oeuvre. This renewed interest has been driven in part by a growing recognition of the opera's musical and dramatic merits, as well as a desire to contextualize the work within the broader cultural and historical landscape of Finland.\n\n**#Structure and roles**\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower is a six-act opera, with a libretto by V.A. Koskenniemi. The work tells the story of a young woman's tragic fate, set amidst the turmoil of the Crusades. The opera's structure is typical of Sibelius's style, with a focus on dramatic contrast and a sense of forward momentum.\n\nThe opera features a range of characters, including the titular Maiden, her lover, and a group of Crusaders. The work's chorus plays a prominent role, adding depth and complexity to the narrative.\n\n**#Synopsis**\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower tells the story of a young woman who is captured by Crusaders and taken to a tower. The woman, who is unnamed, becomes the object of a Crusader's affections, but their love is doomed from the start. The opera's narrative is a tragic tale of love and loss, set against the backdrop of the Crusades.\n\nAs the opera unfolds, the Crusader becomes increasingly obsessed with the Maiden, eventually leading to a dramatic confrontation between the two. The work's climax is a poignant and powerful moment, as the Maiden ultimately meets her tragic fate.\n\n**#Music**\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower is scored for a large orchestra, including a prominent role for the chorus. Sibelius drew heavily from Finnish folk music, incorporating traditional melodies and rhythms into the opera's score. The work's musical language is characterized by its use of modal harmony and a sense of forward momentum, which was a hallmark of Sibelius's style.\n\nThe opera's score is notable for its use of leitmotifs, with recurring melodies and motifs used to represent different characters and themes. Sibelius's use of leitmotifs adds depth and complexity to the narrative, making it easier for audiences to follow the story.\n\n**#Context and analysis**\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower is a product of its time, reflecting the cultural and historical context in which it was written. The opera's narrative is a reflection of the turmoil and upheaval of the Crusades, as well as the cultural and linguistic debates that were taking place in Finland at the time.\n\n### ##The plot as allegory\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower has been interpreted as an allegory for the struggle between Finland and Sweden, as well as the country's desire for independence. The opera's narrative can be seen as a reflection of the country's own tragic fate, with the Maiden representing the Finnish people and the Crusader representing the Swedish oppressors.\n\n### ##Opera and Finland's language strife\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower has also been seen as a reflection of the language strife that was taking place in Finland at the time. The opera's use of Finnish language and culture has been interpreted as a way of asserting the country's national identity and promoting the use of the Finnish language.\n\n### ##Later opinions of Sibelius's music\n\nIn recent years, Sibelius's music has undergone a significant reevaluation, with many critics and scholars arguing that his works are more complex and nuanced than previously thought. The Maiden in the Tower is no exception, with many praising its use of folk influences and its ability to tell a compelling narrative.\n\n### ##Reasons for post-1981 neglect\n\nDespite its initial success, The Maiden in the Tower fell into neglect after 1981. This was due in part to a combination of factors, including the opera's perceived connection to Finland's language strife and Sibelius's own conservative views on art and culture.\n\n**#Discography**\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower has been recorded several times, with notable performances and recordings including:\n\n* 1965: ENSO, conducted by Jorma Panula\n* 1975: Finnish Opera Orchestra, conducted by Uuno Klami\n* 1985: Finnish Opera Orchestra, conducted by Jorma Panula\n* 1995: ENSO, conducted by Jorma Panula\n* 2005: Finnish Opera Orchestra, conducted by Sakari Oramo\n\n**#Notes, references, and sources**\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower is a complex and multifaceted work, reflecting the cultural and historical context in which it was written.

The former Deputy Premier, Andrew Constance, resigned as a member of the Legislative Assembly in March 2023, triggering a by-election in his seat of Bega.\n\n### Possibility of a hung parliament\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, there were concerns that the election would result in a hung parliament, with several polls indicating that the Labor Party could win a majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly. However, the Liberal Party was able to form a minority government after the election, with the support of the National Party and several independent members.\n\n**Campaign**\n\n### Policies\n\nThe major parties campaigned on a range of policy issues, including the economy, healthcare, education, and infrastructure.

Born on August 6, 1962, in Ipoh, Perak, Malaysia, Yeoh rose to international fame with her performances in action films, particularly in the 1990s and early 2000s. Throughout her career, she has demonstrated her versatility as an actress, effortlessly transitioning between action-packed blockbuster films, dramatic roles, and even television series.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nMichelle Yeoh was born to a Chinese father, Yeoh Kian Teik, and a Hainanese mother, Janet Yeoh. Her father was a successful businessman, and the family moved to Kuala Lumpur when Yeoh was a child. She has two siblings, a brother and a sister. Yeoh's early life was marked by a strong interest in dance and sports, which she credits with helping her develop her physicality and confidence.\n\nYeoh attended Assunta Secondary School in Petaling Jaya, Selangor, and later enrolled in the drama program at the University of London's Goldsmiths College. However, she dropped out after one year to pursue a career in modeling and acting. Her experience in the entertainment industry began with television commercials and guest appearances on Malaysian television shows.\n\n**Career**\n\nYeoh's career can be divided into several distinct phases, each marked by significant milestones and transformations.\n\n### **Early career and first retirement (1983–1991)**\n\nYeoh's acting debut was in the 1983 Malaysian television series _Angela's Wedding_. She quickly gained recognition for her performances in several local films and television dramas. In the late 1980s, she began to appear in Hong Kong films, including the 1988 film _The Owl vs. Dumbo_. However, her early career was marked by a lack of significant recognition, and she eventually retired from acting in 1991 to focus on her personal life.\n\n### **Return as an action star (1992–2001)**\n\nYeoh's return to acting in 1992 marked a significant turning point in her career. She began to take on more substantial roles in Hong Kong action films, including the 1992 film _The Heroic Trio_ and the 1993 film _The Eagle Shooting Heroes_. Her performance in the 1997 film _Supercop 2_ earned her international recognition and critical acclaim. This period saw Yeoh become one of the leading action stars in Hong Kong cinema.\n\n### **Career fluctuations (2002–2016)**\n\nIn the early 2000s, Yeoh's career experienced a decline, with fewer and less prominent roles.

The fires, which were fueled by drought, heat, and strong winds, caused widespread damage, displacement, and loss of life.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Wildfire risk\n\nHawaii, being an island state, is prone to wildfires due to its dry climate and vegetation. The state's tropical climate, with its dry and wet seasons, creates an environment where wildfires can quickly spread. Additionally, Hawaii's geography, with its rugged terrain and isolated areas, makes it challenging for firefighters to access and contain wildfires.\n\n### Weather factors\n\nThe 2023 wildfires in Hawaii were exacerbated by a prolonged period of drought and heat. A high-pressure system, which brought clear skies and hot temperatures, developed over the state, allowing conditions to become increasingly dry and volatile. Strong winds, particularly during the peak heat hours, further fueled the spread of wildfires.\n\n**List of wildfires**\n\nThe 2023 Hawaii wildfires affected several islands, including Maui, Hawaiʻi Island, and Oʻahu. Some of the most notable fires include:\n\n* **Kula**: A massive fire that burned over 10,000 acres in the Kula area of Maui.\n* **Lahaina**: A fire that destroyed several homes and businesses in the historic town of Lahaina, Maui.\n* **Pūlehu-Kīhei**: A fire that burned over 5,000 acres in the Pūlehu-Kīhei area of Maui.\n* **Other fires**: Several smaller fires broke out on other islands,

several homes and businesses.\n* **June 20**: The Pūlehu-Kīhei fire was reported, burning over 5,000 acres.\n* **June 25**: The Kula fire was brought under control, but not before burning over 10,000 acres.\n\n### Hawaiʻi Island\n\n* **June 22**: A fire broke out in the Waimea area, burning over 2,000 acres.\n* **June 24**: A smaller fire was reported in the Kona area.\n\n### Oʻahu\n\n* **June 18**: A fire broke out in the Nuʻuanu area, burning over 1,000 acres.\n* **June 22**: A smaller fire was reported in the Kailua area.\n\n**Impact**\n\n### Casualties\n\nThe 2023 Hawaii wildfires resulted in the loss of several lives, including firefighters and civilians.\n\n### Damage\n\nThe fires caused widespread damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure, with estimated losses in the billions of dollars.\n\n### Environment\n\nThe fires had a significant impact on the environment, affecting native ecosystems and wildlife habitats.\n\n### Evacuations\n\nOver 10,000 people were evacuated from their homes due to the fires, with many more affected by smoke and ash.\n\n### Wildlife and pets\n\nThe fires had a devastating impact on wildlife and pets, with many animals killed or displaced.\n\n**Legal proceedings**\n\nSeveral lawsuits were filed in connection with the 2023 Hawaii wildfires, including claims against landowners, government agencies, and others.\n\n**Response**\n\n### Federal government\n\nThe federal government provided significant resources and support to the state of Hawaii in responding to the wildfires.\n\n### State government\n\nThe state government, led by Governor Josh Green, played a key role in coordinating the response to the wildfires.\n\n### International assistance\n\nSeveral countries, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Hungary, provided assistance to Hawaii in responding to the wildfires.\n\n### Japan\n\nJapan provided a team of firefighters and equipment to assist in battling the wildfires.\n\n### South Korea\n\nSouth Korea provided a team of firefighters and equipment to assist in battling the wildfires.\n\n### Taiwan\n\nTaiwan provided a team of firefighters and equipment to assist in battling the wildfires.\n\n### Hungary\n\nHungary provided a team of firefighters and equipment to assist in battling the wildfires.\n\n**Fundraising and donations**\n\nSeveral fundraising campaigns were launched to support those affected by the wildfires, with millions of dollars raised.\n\n**Concerns about preparedness**\n\nThe 2023 Hawaii wildfires raised concerns about preparedness and response, with some questioning the effectiveness of warning programs and emergency planning.\n\n### New warning programs\n\nIn response to the wildfires, the state of Hawaii introduced new warning programs and emergency planning measures.\n\n**Conspiracy theories**\n\nSeveral conspiracy theories emerged in connection with the 2023 Hawaii wildfires, including claims of arson and government involvement.\n\n**See also**\n\n* **Wildfires in Hawaii**\n* **List of wildfires in Hawaii**\n* **Hawaii wildfires by year**\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is a summary of the 2023 Hawaii

They are a diverse group, ranging from single-celled organisms such as protozoa and algae to multicellular organisms such as plants, animals, and fungi. Eukaryotes are found in almost every habitat on Earth and play a vital role in the ecosystem.\n\n# Diversity\n------------\n\nEukaryotes are incredibly diverse, with estimates suggesting that there are between 5 and 20 million different species. This diversity is reflected in the wide range of habitats and environments in which eukaryotes are found. From the freezing temperatures of the Antarctic to the scorching heat of the desert, eukaryotes have adapted to survive and thrive in almost every environment.\n\nSome of the most well-known eukaryotes include humans, plants, and animals, but there are also many other groups that are less well-known. These include protozoa, which are single-celled organisms that are often parasitic or pathogenic; algae, which are photosynthetic eukaryotes that are found in aquatic environments; and fungi, which are heterotrophic eukaryotes that obtain their nutrients by decomposing organic matter.\n\n# Distinguishing features\n-------------------------\n\nEukaryotes are characterized by a number of distinct features that set them apart from other domains of life.\n\n## Nucleus\n-----------\n\nThe nucleus is a membrane-bound organelle that contains the cell's genetic material. It is the site of DNA replication and transcription, and is surrounded by a double membrane called the nuclear envelope. The nucleus is a characteristic feature of eukaryotes, and is thought to have evolved as a way to protect the cell's genetic material from the environment.\n\n## Biochemistry\n--------------\n\nEukaryotes are characterized by a wide range of biochemical pathways that are involved in energy production, metabolism, and other cellular processes. These pathways often involve complex molecules such as proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates, and are often regulated by gene expression and other mechanisms.\n\n## Internal membranes\n-------------------\n\nEukaryotes are characterized by a number of internal membranes that are involved in various cellular processes. These include the endoplasmic reticulum, which is involved in protein synthesis and transport; the Golgi apparatus, which is involved in protein modification and sorting; and the mitochondria, which are involved in energy production.\n\n## Mitochondria\n--------------\n\nMitochondria are membrane-bound organelles that are involved in energy production. They contain a molecule called ATP, which is the primary energy currency of the cell. Mitochondria are thought to have evolved from a group of bacteria that were engulfed by the cell's ancestors, and are a key feature of eukaryotic cells.\n\n## Plastids\n---------\n\nPlastids are membrane-bound organelles that are involved in photosynthesis. They are found in plants and some algae, and are thought to have evolved from a group of bacteria that were engulfed by the cell's ancestors. Plastids contain a molecule called chlorophyll, which absorbs light energy and is used to produce ATP.\n\n## Cytoskeletal structures\n-------------------------\n\nEukaryotes are characterized by a number of cytoskeletal structures that provide support and shape to the cell. These include microtubules, which are involved in the transport of organelles; microfilaments, which are involved in cell shape and movement; and intermediate filaments, which provide structural support to the cell.\n\n## Cell wall\n------------\n\nEukaryotes are characterized by a number of cell wall types that provide structural support and protection to the cell. These include the cell walls of plants, which are made of cellulose; the cell walls of fungi, which are made of chitin; and the cell walls of some protozoa, which are made of proteins and other molecules.\n\n## Sexual reproduction\n-------------------\n\nEukaryotes are characterized by a number of reproductive strategies, including sexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction involves the exchange of genetic material between two individuals, which results in the production of offspring with unique combinations of traits. Sexual reproduction is thought to have evolved as a way to increase genetic diversity and adapt to changing environments.\n\n# Evolution\n------------\n\n## History of classification\n-------------------------\n\nThe classification of eukaryotes has a long and complex history, with many different approaches and theories being proposed over the years. The modern classification of eukaryotes is based on a group of characteristics that are thought to be universal among eukaryotes, including the presence of a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles.\n\n## Phylogeny\n------------\n\nPhylogenetic analysis has shown that eukaryotes are a monophyletic group, meaning that they share a common ancestor and have evolved from a single lineage. The most recent common ancestor of eukaryotes is thought to have lived around 1.6 billion years ago, and is often referred to as the eukaryote ancestor.\n\n## Origin of eukaryotes\n---------------------\n\nThe origin of eukaryotes is thought to have involved the engulfment of a group of bacteria by a cell's ancestor. This event is often referred to as the \"symbiotic origin of eukaryotes,\" and is thought to have occurred around 2 billion years ago.\n\n## Fossils\n----------\n\nFossils of eukaryotes have been found in rocks dating back to the Precambrian era, which was around 4 billion years ago. These fossils include evidence of ancient eukaryotes such as multicellular algae and simple animals.\n\n# See also\n----------\n\n* [DNA](/wiki/DNA)\n* [Mitosis](/wiki/Mitosis)\n* [Meiosis](/wiki/Meiosis)\n* [Photosynthesis](/wiki/Photosynthesis)\n* [Cell biology](/wiki/Cell_biology)\n* [Genetics](/wiki/Genetics)\n\n# References\n------------\n\n# External links\n----------------\n\n* [National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)\n* [European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL)](https://www.embl.org/)\n* [The Tree of Life Project](http://tolweb.org/)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Eukaryote\" following this outline:\n\n#Diversity\n#Distinguishing features\n##Nucleus\n##Biochemistry\n##Internal membranes\n##Mitochondria\n##Plastids\n##Cytoskeletal structures\n##Cell wall\n##Sexual reproduction\n#Evolution\n##History of classification\n##Phylogeny\n##Origin of eukaryotes\n##Fossils\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was a member of the House of Plantagenet and the son of King Henry III. Edward is best known for his military conquests in Wales and Scotland, as well as his efforts to establish a strong and centralized government in England.\n\n#Early years, 1239–1263\n\n##Childhood and marriage\nEdward was born on 17 June 1239 at the Palace of Westminster in London, England. He was the eldest son of King Henry III and his wife, Eleanor of Provence. Edward's early life was marked by a strict education, which included the study of Latin, French, and music. He was also trained in martial arts and was known for his physical strength and agility.\n\nIn 1254, Edward married Eleanor of Castile, a member of the royal family in Castile, Spain. The marriage was arranged by Edward's father, who sought to strengthen ties with the Spanish royal family. The couple had 14 children together, including several sons who would go on to become kings of England.\n\n##Early ambitions\nEdward's early ambitions were shaped by his desire to assert his authority and independence from his father. He was known for his strong personality and his willingness to challenge those in power. In 1258, Edward participated in a rebellion against his father, which was eventually put down by the king's forces. This experience taught Edward the importance of building alliances and using diplomacy to achieve his goals.\n\n#Civil war and crusades, 1264–1273\n\n##Second Barons' War\nIn 1264, Edward participated in the Second Barons' War, a conflict between the barons and the king that was sparked by the king's failure to reform the government and address the grievances of the nobility. Edward led a group of loyalist forces against the rebels and was instrumental in the victory at the Battle of Evesham in 1265. The war was eventually brought to an end by the Treaty of Lewes in 1267.\n\n##Crusade and accession\nIn 1270, Edward joined the Ninth Crusade, a military campaign led by King Louis IX of France. The crusade was an attempt to retake the Holy Land from the Muslims, but it was ultimately unsuccessful. Edward returned to England in 1272, where he was greeted as a hero. His father, King Henry III, died soon after, and Edward succeeded him as king.\n\n#Early reign, 1274–1296\n\n##Conquest of Wales\nOne of Edward's first acts as king was to launch a campaign to conquer Wales. He was driven by a desire to assert his authority and to bring the Welsh under English control. The conquest was eventually completed in 1283, and Edward was crowned King of Wales at the Palace of Caernarfon.\n\n##Diplomacy and war on the Continent\nEdward's reign was marked by a series of diplomatic and military conflicts with the French and the Scots. He was a skilled diplomat and was able to negotiate several treaties with the French, including the Treaty of Paris in 1286. However, he was also a skilled warrior and was involved in several military campaigns on the Continent, including the Battle of Falkirk in 1298.\n\n##Great Cause\nThe Great Cause was a series of lawsuits and negotiations that took place in the late 13th century between the English crown and the Scottish nobles over the succession to the Scottish throne. Edward was a key player in the Great Cause and was instrumental in the eventual recognition of his heir, Edward Balliol, as the King of Scotland.\n\n#Government and law\n\n##Character as king\nEdward I was known for his strong personality and his willingness to challenge those in power. He was a skilled diplomat and was able to negotiate several treaties with the French and the Scots. However, he was also a skilled warrior and was involved in several military campaigns on the Continent.\n\n##Administration and the law\nEdward's government was characterized by a strong centralized authority and a system of administration that was based on the English system of government. He was a skilled administrator and was able to establish a system of law that was based on the English common law. He also established a system of local government, which was based on the English system of shires and hundreds.\n\n##Finances and Parliament\nEdward's government was also characterized by a strong system of finance, which was based on the English system of taxation. He was a skilled financier and was able to establish a system of taxation that was based on the English system of customs and excise duties. He also established a system of Parliament, which was based on the English system of representation. The first English Parliament was convened in 1295, and it was attended by representatives from all over the country.\n\n##Parliament and the expulsion of the Jews\nEdward's government was also marked by the expulsion of the Jews from England in 1290. This was a major event in English history and had a significant impact on the English economy and society. The expulsion was driven by a combination of factors, including the persecution of the Jews by the English nobility and the desire to limit the influence of the Jewish community in England.\n\n##Administration in Ireland\nEdward's government also had a significant impact on Ireland, where he established a system of administration that was based on the English system of government. He was a skilled administrator and was able to establish a system of law that was based on the English common law. He also established a system of local government, which was based on the English system of shires and hundreds.\n\n#Later reign, 1297–1307\n\n##Constitutional crisis\nEdward's later reign was marked by a constitutional crisis that was sparked by the English nobility's opposition to his attempts to limit their power. The crisis was eventually resolved by the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284, which established the English system of government in Wales.\n\n##Return to Scotland\nEdward's later reign was also marked by a return to Scotland, where he launched a series of military campaigns against the Scots. He was driven by a desire to assert his authority and to bring the Scots under English control. The campaigns were eventually successful, and Edward was able to establish a system of administration in Scotland that was based on the English system of government.\n\n##Death and burial\nEdward died on 7 July 1307 at Burgh-by-Sands in Cumberland, England. He was 68 years old and had reigned for 35 years. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, where his father and other members of the royal family were also buried.\n\n#Legacy\n\nEdward I is remembered as one of the most successful kings of England, who played a significant role in shaping the country's history and government. He was a skilled diplomat and warrior, who was able to establish a system of administration that was based on the English system of government. He also established a system of law that was based on the English common law, and he was able to limit the influence of the nobility by establishing a system of representation in Parliament.\n\n#Family\n\n##First marriage\nEdward's first marriage was to Eleanor of Castile, a member of the royal family in Castile, Spain. The couple had 14 children together, including several sons who would go on to become kings of England.\n\n##Second marriage\nEdward's second marriage was to Margaret of France, a member of the royal family in France. The couple had no children together.\n\n##Genealogical table\n\nThe following is a genealogical table of Edward I's family:\n\n* King Henry III (1207-1272)\n* King Edward I (1239-1307)\n* Queen Eleanor of Castile (1241-1290)\n\t+ 14 children, including:\n\t\t- Edward of Carnarvon (1284-1327)\n\t\t- John of Eltham (1305-1310)\n\t\t- Eleanor of Woodstock (1318-1355)\n\n#See also\n\n* List of monarchs of England\n* List of monarchs of Scotland\n* List of monarchs of Wales\n\n#Notes\n\n#References\n\n#Bibliography\n\n#External links\n\nThis article uses material from the Wikipedia article \"Edward I of England\", which is released under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share-Alike License 3.0.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Edward_I_of_England\" following this outline:\n\n#Early years, 1239–1263\n##Childhood and marriage\n##Early ambitions\n#Civil war and crusades, 1264–1273\n##Second Barons' War\n##Crusade and accession\n#Early reign, 1274–1296\n##Conquest of Wales\n##Diplomacy and war on the Continent\n##Great Cause\n#Government and law\n##Character as king\n##Administration and the law\n##Finances and Parliament\n##Parliament and the expulsion of the Jews\n##Administration in Ireland\n#Later reign, 1297–1307\n##Constitutional crisis\n##Return to Scotland\n##Death and burial\n#Legacy\n#Family\n##First marriage\n##Second marriage\n##Genealogical table\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The election was held against the backdrop of a significant shift in the country's politics, with the ruling Fidesz party facing a united opposition.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Amendment of the electoral law\n\nIn 2020, the Hungarian parliament passed an amendment to the electoral law, which introduced a number of changes aimed at reducing the number of opposition parties in the National Assembly. The amendment reduced the number of seats allocated to parties in proportion to the number of votes they receive, making it more difficult for smaller parties to gain representation.\n\n### Creation of joint opposition list\n\nIn response to the amendment, the six strongest opposition parties in Hungary – the Democratic Coalition (DK), the Socialist Party (MSZP), the Jobbik party, the Momentum Movement, the Politics Can Be Different (LMP) party, and the Dialogue for Hungary (PM) party – decided to create a joint opposition list for the election. The list, known as the United Opposition, aimed to present a united front against the ruling Fidesz party and increase the chances of the opposition winning a majority in the National Assembly.\n\n### Opposition primary\n\nIn the period leading up to the election, the United Opposition conducted an opposition primary, in which the candidates for the joint list were selected through a series of public debates and online votes. The primary was won by Péter Márki-Zay, a former mayor of Hódmezővásárhely and a member of the Fidesz party until 2019.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nThe National Assembly of Hungary is composed of 199 members, elected by a mixed-member proportional representation system. One hundred and forty-two members are elected through single-member constituencies, while the remaining fifty-seven members are allocated to parties in proportion to the number of votes they receive.\n\n**Parties and coalitions**\n\nA total of 158 parties and coalitions registered to participate in the election. The main contenders were:\n\n* Fidesz – Hungarian Civic Alliance (Fidesz-KDNP)\n* United Opposition (DK, MSZP, Jobbik, Momentum, PM, LMP)\n* Mi Hazánk (Our Homeland) Movement\n* Our Party (Mi Pártja)\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nOpinion polls conducted in the period leading up to the election suggested a close contest between Fidesz and the United Opposition. A survey conducted by the Századvég Foundation in February 2022 found that 30% of respondents intended to vote for Fidesz, while 28% intended to vote for the United Opposition.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe election was won by Fidesz, which secured 135 seats in the National Assembly. The United Opposition, meanwhile, secured 57 seats.\n\n### Result by constituency\n\nThe results by constituency showed a significant advantage for Fidesz, with the party winning 118 constituencies. The United Opposition won 22 constituencies, while Mi Hazánk and Our Party won one constituency each.\n\n### Party list results by county and in the diaspora\n\nThe party list results by county showed a significant advantage for Fidesz, which won all but one county. The United Opposition won one county, while Mi Hazánk and Our Party won no counties.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe election marked a significant shift in the country's politics, with Fidesz securing a renewed mandate to continue its rule. The United Opposition, meanwhile, failed to capitalize on the momentum gained during the opposition primary and the joint list.\n\n### Conduct\n\nThe election was conducted in an orderly manner, with voters able to cast their ballots at polling stations across the country. However, there were reports of voting irregularities and intimidation of voters.\n\n### Anomalies over postal ballots\n\nThere were concerns over the handling of postal ballots, with many voters reporting difficulties in casting their ballots and others receiving ballots with incorrect details.\n\n### International responses\n\nThe election was widely condemned by international observers, who expressed concerns over the fairness and transparency of the process. The European Union, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and the Council of Europe all expressed concerns over the election, with the OSCE describing it as a \"highly polarized\" and \"highly contested\" election.\n\n**See also**\n\n* 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election (Századvég Foundation)\n* 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election (European Union)\n* 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election (OSCE)\n* 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election (Council of Europe)\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The election was held on 3 April 2022.\n* The election was contested by 158 parties and coalitions.\n* The results were certified by the National Election Commission on 6 April 2022.\n* The election was widely condemned by international observers.\n\n**References**\n\n* \"Hungary parliamentary election, 2022\".

This approach has significant implications for the economy, from the way scientific research is conducted to the dissemination and accessibility of knowledge. The economics of open science explores the costs and benefits of this paradigm shift, examining the various models, regulations, and implications for the scientific community, industries, and society as a whole.\n\n**# Economic Models**\n\nThe economics of open science can be understood through various models, each reflecting different aspects of the open science ecosystem.\n\n## **Open Science Club**\n\nThe concept of an open science club is central to understanding the economic models of open science. This club represents a collective of researchers, institutions, and stakeholders who share knowledge, resources, and expertise to advance scientific research.\n\n### **Definitions of Knowledge Club**\n\nA knowledge club is a group of individuals or organizations that share a common interest in a specific field of study. In the context of open science, knowledge clubs are formed to facilitate the sharing of knowledge, data, and methods, leading to collective innovation and progress.\n\n### **Knowledge Club and Open Science**\n\nThe open science club is a manifestation of the knowledge club concept, where scientists and researchers collaborate to share their findings, collaborate on projects, and accelerate research progress. This collective approach to research leveraging open science has the potential to revolutionize the way scientific knowledge is generated and disseminated.\n\n## **Open Science Market**\n\nThe open science market refers to the economic system that governs the production, distribution, and consumption of scientific knowledge. This market is characterized by a mix of traditional and open access models, where researchers and institutions can choose to share their work openly or restrict access to their research.\n\n### **Scientific Publishing: a Hybrid Market**\n\nThe scientific publishing industry is a key player in the open science market. Traditionally, scientific journals have relied on subscription-based models, where researchers and institutions pay to access published articles. However, with the rise of open access publishing, many journals now offer hybrid models, where authors can choose to make their articles freely available or pay to access them.\n\n### **From Readers to Authors: Hybrid and Full Open Access**\n\nThe shift from readers to authors has significant implications for the open science market. With the increasing emphasis on open access, authors are now at the forefront of the scientific publishing landscape. Authors can choose to publish their work in hybrid or full open access journals, allowing readers to access their research without barriers.\n\n### **From Publishing to Analytics: Diversification of Revenue Streams**\n\nThe open science market is diversifying, with new revenue streams emerging beyond traditional publishing models. Analytics and data services are becoming increasingly important, providing researchers with insights and metrics to evaluate the impact of their work. This shift towards analytics and data-driven services has the potential to transform the way researchers and institutions interact with scientific knowledge.\n\n## **Open Science Commons**\n\nThe open science commons refers to the collective knowledge and resources shared by the open science community. This commons is characterized by a set of principles and norms that govern the sharing and use of scientific knowledge.\n\n### **The Emergence of Digital Knowledge Commons**\n\nThe digital knowledge commons is a key aspect of the open science commons. This digital platform allows researchers to share their data, methods, and findings, creating a vast repository of scientific knowledge. The digital knowledge commons has the potential to accelerate research progress, facilitate collaboration, and promote innovation.\n\n### **Enclosures of Open Science Commons**\n\nThe enclosures of open science commons refer to the limitations and restrictions placed on the sharing and use of scientific knowledge. These enclosures can take many forms, including copyright laws, data protection regulations, and institutional policies.\n\n### **Consolidation of the Common Ecosystem (2015-)**\n\nThe open science commons has been consolidating since 2015, with the emergence of new platforms, tools, and services. This consolidation has created a more robust and resilient ecosystem, providing researchers with greater access to scientific knowledge and resources.\n\n**# Cost**\n\nThe economics of open science also involves the costs associated with implementing and sustaining an open science paradigm. These costs can be broken down into three main categories: editorial work and evaluation, technical infrastructure, and commercial services and prestige.\n\n## **Editorial Work and Evaluation**\n\nThe editorial work and evaluation of scientific research are critical components of the open science ecosystem. This work involves the peer review and editing of research articles, ensuring that the quality and rigor of research are maintained.\n\n## **Technical Infrastructure**\n\nThe technical infrastructure required to support open science is significant, including the development and maintenance of digital platforms, data storage and management systems, and analytics tools.\n\n## **Commercial Services and Prestige**\n\nCommercial services and prestige are also important aspects of the open science ecosystem. Researchers and institutions can access a range of commercial services, including publishing, data analytics, and consulting. Prestige and reputation are also critical, with researchers and institutions competing for recognition and accolades.\n\n**# Benefits**\n\nThe economics of open science also involves the benefits associated with this paradigm shift. These benefits can be broken down into four main categories: transaction costs, access costs, research efficiency, and economic and social development.\n\n## **Transaction Costs**\n\nThe transaction costs associated with open science are significantly reduced, as researchers and institutions can share knowledge and resources without the need for intermediaries.\n\n## **Access Costs**\n\nThe access costs associated with open science are also reduced, as researchers and institutions can access knowledge and resources without the need for subscriptions or fees.\n\n## **Research Efficiency**\n\nThe research efficiency associated with open science is increased, as researchers can share knowledge and resources, collaborate on projects, and accelerate research progress.\n\n## **Economic and Social Development**\n\nThe economic and social development associated with open science is significant, as this paradigm shift has the potential to promote innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic growth.\n\n**# Economic Regulation of Open Science**\n\nThe economic regulation of open science is a critical aspect of this paradigm shift. Governments and institutions are developing policies and regulations to support and govern the open science ecosystem.\n\nThis article has provided an overview of the economics of open science, exploring the various models, costs, benefits, and implications of this paradigm shift. The open science ecosystem is complex and multifaceted, involving a range of stakeholders, institutions, and platforms. As the open science movement continues to evolve, it is essential to understand the economic principles and regulations that govern this ecosystem.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Economics_of_open_science\" following this outline:\n\n#Economic models\n##Open science club\n###Definitions of knowledge club\n###Knowledge club and open science\n##Open Science market\n###Scientific publishing: a hybrid market\n###From readers to authors: hybrid and full open access\n###From publishing to analytics: diversification of revenue streams\n##Open Science Commons\n###The emergence of digital knowledge commons\n###Enclosures of open science commons\n###Consolidation of the common ecosystem (2015-)\n#Cost\n##Editorial work and evaluation\n##Technical infrastructure\n##Commercial services and prestige\n#Benefits\n##Transaction costs\n##Access costs\n##Research efficiency\n##Economic and social development\n#Economic regulation of open science\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest pitchers in baseball history, known for his exceptional fastball, curveball, and changeup, as well as his durability and control.\n\nEarly Life\n----------\n\nSandy Koufax was born Sanford Braun on December 30, 1935, in Brooklyn, New York. He was the son of Jack and Florence Braun, who were both Jewish immigrants from Poland. Koufax's father was a tailor, and the family lived in a small apartment in the Brooklyn borough of Williamsburg.\n\nMajor League Tryouts\n-------------------\n\nKoufax attended James Madison High School in Brooklyn, where he played baseball and basketball. After graduating in 1953, he was drafted by the Dodgers in the 30th round of the MLB draft, but he did not sign with the team. Instead, he attended the University of Cincinnati, where he played baseball and basketball, earning All-American honors in both sports.\n\nProfessional Career\n-----------------\n\nEarly Years (1955–1960)\n----------------------\n\nKoufax began his professional baseball career in 1955, signing with the Dodgers as a left-handed pitcher. He made his MLB debut on June 18, 1955, against the Brooklyn Giants, and pitched 7 2/3 innings, allowing 3 runs on 7 hits. Over the next five years, Koufax developed into a solid starter, winning 41 games and losing 34.\n\nDomination (1961–1964)\n----------------------\n\nKoufax's career took off in 1961, when he won 18 games and lost 13, with a 2.54 ERA. He followed this up with 21 wins and 11 losses in 1962, earning his first All-Star selection. In 1963, Koufax won 25 games and lost 5, with a 1.88 ERA, leading the league in wins, ERA, and strikeouts.\n\n### 1961 Season\n\nKoufax's 1961 season was marked by his first 20-win season, as well as his first All-Star selection. He pitched 283 innings, allowing 230 hits and 80 walks, while striking out 238 batters.\n\n### 1962 Season\n\nIn 1962, Koufax improved his numbers, winning 21 games and losing 11. He pitched 268 innings, allowing 202 hits and 89 walks, while striking out 269 batters. His ERA dropped to 2.54, and he earned his second All-Star selection.\n\n### 1963 Season\n\nKoufax's 1963 season was his best to date, as he won 25 games and lost 5. He pitched 323 innings, allowing 225 hits and 71 walks, while striking out 306 batters. His ERA dropped to 1.88, and he led the league in wins, ERA, and strikeouts.\n\nSalary Dispute\n----------------\n\nIn 1964, Koufax and the Dodgers reached a salary dispute, with Koufax seeking a significant increase in pay. The dispute lasted for several months, and Koufax eventually settled for a contract extension that paid him $120,000 per year.\n\n### 1964 Season\n\nKoufax's 1964 season was disrupted by the salary dispute, as he missed several games due to the dispute. He still managed to win 19 games and lose 3, with a 1.73 ERA.\n\nPlaying in Pain (1965–66)\n-------------------------\n\nIn 1965, Koufax developed a back condition that caused him to pitch in pain for much of the season. He still managed to win 26 games and lose 8, with a 1.73 ERA. However, the back condition worsened in 1966, and Koufax was forced to miss several games.\n\n### 1965 Season\n\nIn 1965, Koufax pitched 335 innings, allowing 224 hits and 83 walks, while striking out 382 batters. He also pitched a perfect game on September 9, 1965, against the Chicago Cubs.\n\n#### Perfection\n\nKoufax's perfect game was his second of the season, as he also pitched a three-hit shutout on August 31, 1965. He became the first pitcher in MLB history to throw two no-hitters in a single season.\n\n#### World Series and Yom Kippur Decision\n\nKoufax's back condition worsened during the 1965 World Series, and he was forced to miss several games. In 1966, he was again forced to miss several games due to his back condition. On Yom Kippur, Koufax was offered a chance to pitch in a game against the Chicago Cubs, but he declined, citing his religious beliefs.\n\nHoldout\n---------\n\nIn 1966, Koufax held out from spring training in an attempt to secure a new contract. He eventually signed a contract that paid him $125,000 per year.\n\n### 1966 Season\n\nKoufax's 1966 season was marked by his final All-Star selection, as well as his final World Series appearance. He pitched 191 innings, allowing 128 hits and 64 walks, while striking out 205 batters.\n\nRetirement\n------------\n\nKoufax retired from baseball in 1966, at the age of 30, due to his back condition. He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1972, in his first year of eligibility.\n\nCareer Overall\n----------------\n\nSandy Koufax's career statistics are impressive, as he won 165 games and lost 87, with a 2.76 ERA.
